<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Fifteen</span> years form a long space in a
man's lifetime; and during so many I have been from time to time
collecting and collating materials, and endeavouring to
accomplish the publication of the history which is now submitted
to the public. Four years since a portion was published in one of
our local journals; but failing health, and inability to use my
right hand, prevented its completion at the time;&mdash;a
circumstance which, however I may have suffered from its causes,
I cannot say that I regret. Time has been afforded for revision,
for additional information, and for the correction of conclusions
which, although not hastily formed, prove to have been arrived at
upon insufficient basis. Nevertheless, the diligence with which
facts had been sought out, and the care with which their alleged
authenticity was sifted, were, at the time I allude to, admitted
by those most entitled to express an opinion on such
matters;&mdash;the few who, having taken an active part in the
foundation of the colony, survived to witness the changes which
more than a quarter of a century has effected in its position,
and a growth flattering enough to the people, but owing more to
the beneficence of Providence than the foresight or wisdom of
man.</p>
<p>The division of the history into two parts was not decided
upon without careful consideration. Necessarily the growth of the
colony before and since its separation from New South Wales
differs in essential points;&mdash;a difference not so much due
to mere alteration in the administration of government as is
sometimes supposed. The changes wrought by the development of
material science within the last few years, have greatly
intensified those which might have been looked for in the
ordinary onward march of civilisation; and we have less to create
than to follow and grasp the benefits flowing from the succession
of discoveries. Since the year 1859 what marvellous applications
of science have we seen; and we can scarcely appreciate their
influence, unless we ask ourselves what, had they not been made,
would most probably have been the position of the colony at the
present hour. But we ought not to be blinded by the glare,
however dazzling, of scientific light, to the value of the
unobtrusive material which in other respects the earlier history
of the one time infant settlement offers to us. Men wrought,
toiled, suffered, were misgoverned, and endured; and after many
years, apparently, gained the independence that was the desire of
their hearts. And the student who watches the political
discussions which have now most interest to us will be amused by
finding how much of value in them was initiated in those early
days. Our schemes of government, our theories of finance, our
land legislation, our plans of settlement, seem the echoes, too
often faint and feeble, of the voices of those, not in reality so
remote, but yet which seem to us, far off years: and when we are
most proud of novelty we are often most certain to have been
anticipated in our inventions.</p>
<p>There are, moreover, some features in the early history of
Moreton Bay which cannot be repeated in any attempt at further
colonisation;&mdash;not likely to be fettered by such troubles as
beset the foundation of the colony in the obstacles presented by
the expiring struggles of the transportation system. It may be
suggested that the narration of those struggles imparts less of
dignity than degradation in the retrospect; but they left their
traces long after they ended, and they were so much mixed up with
the twin contest for representative institutions that it is
necessary to go into detail to some extent with respect to its
incidents. Nor will the successive changes which the formation of
parliamentary government underwent, from the time that a
fragmentary sort of self rule was first granted, until the final
embodiment of 'William 'Wentworth's most practical views of the
Constitution of New South Wales&mdash;the parent of our
own&mdash;be without interest to the thoughtful observer: and we
shall find that, had the suggestive recommendations fostered by
the late Earl Grey been given the weight due to them, we might
have been spared the trouble of discussing federal systems, and
local administration would have long since passed from the region
of experiment to complete fulfilment. These difficulties and
fluctuations indicate how important a revolution in the character
of the relations of the mother country with her Australian
colonies was, almost without observation, slowly and surely
making its way; and thus they became of historic value to
ourselves. Age and transition leave an authoritative stamp upon
many circumstances which, from a commercial or presently social
point of view, seem comparatively worthless; or those researches,
which occupy so much of modern industry and speculation, would be
only so many proofs of the perversion of intellectual power: he
who ignores the past simply deprecates the value of his own
existence to the future. And, apart from the philosophic interest
of the facts presented, there must be the local feeling,
connected with places and persons, incorporated in the
recollections of many of our people,&mdash;with the associations
and fortunes of the majority,&mdash;the preservation of which, in
a permanent form, cannot but be gratifying to them, of whatever
use it may be in educating the rising generation. Of the few
thousands of native Queenslanders living amongst us in 1881, how
many may be supposed to know anything of the history of the
country of their birth? Yet, surely, if it be essential that they
should be certain how much remains of the old Saxon laws in the
British constitution, and be familiar with the origin of the
British nation, it is, at least, equally so that they should not
be left in ignorance&mdash;fruitful parent of prejudice&mdash;as
to the origin of what may be called their own laws, of the growth
of their own people, and of the foundation of their native
land.</p>
<p>Again, there is much in the history of Australian geographical
exploration which belongs to the time before Moreton Bay expanded
into Queensland. The discoveries of Allan Cunningham, the
adventurous journey of Leichhardt, the patient perseverance and
mournful death of Kennedy, the keen logical induction and special
insight of Clarke, the unruffled endurance of Gregory:&mdash;all
belong to those early days. In whatever of triumph is due to the
foundation of the colony science surely has her share: whether
that is sufficiently vindicated in this history the reader must
judge. If it is not interesting it will not be from the absence
of eminent labourers or worthy achievement. The fault will rest
with the narrative, not with the work recorded.</p>
<p>I believe that, both in the old country and in the neighboring
colonies, as well as in Queensland, the early incidents of our
origin and growth will furnish a by no means useless contribution
to the great store of facts which concern the general progress of
humanity. Unfortunately, few amongst us have time or opportunity
to collect that portion which elucidates either; while day by day
the sources of information are decreasing, and those who could
either furnish it, or indicate where it could be found, are
silently passing away. Thus believing, and thus regretfully
observing, I have collected the material for the first volume,
and wrought as I have been enabled in its arrangement and
distribution.</p>
<p>The period since the separation of Moreton Bay from New South
Wales has been one of self-government, and necessarily presenting
a species of facts differing from those found in its predecessor,
requires a different kind of record. We have reached, although
few in numbers, a position in the colonies sufficiently marked to
justify more of analysis and less of narrative than was thought
desirable in the first instance. We have had twenty-one years of
the mimicry of politics, and of the reality of class and personal
interests and strife; we have arrived at the dignity of a public
debt equal to that of some sovereign states of almost secondary
eminence,&mdash;larger in proportion to our numbers than that of
our own neighbours,&mdash;and the questionable distinction of
being by far the most heavily taxed community in Australia. We
have constructed great public works; we have manufactured a
statute book which, after two successive purgations, offers the
reader four goodly volumes as the result of a third revision,
which, within a very moderate period, will require revising
itself; we have had three or four systems of land law, each at
first deemed perfection, each in its turn decried and condemned;
and are now casting about for another; and we have still to
discern a plan of immigration which will meet the wants, not only
of labor but of that class of employers having moderate means
which forms the most substantial buttress to the State. And we
are on the eve of great changes. Up to a very recent date, the
independence of this colony was, in some important respects, as I
have before suggested, more apparent than real. It labored, and
other men entered into its labors. It had the slightest direct
actual commercial status in the mother country; its trade was
filtered through New South Wales; its leading exports found no
recognition as from itself in the European markets; and its
financial concerns were in the hands of banks and agencies, most
of them having preponderating engagements and connections
elsewhere, and looking on our local interests as proportionately
subordinate and subsidiary. The first stroke at the fetters thus
imposed, was the establishment of a local bank; the second, the
securing of a direct steam service with Great Britain. The effect
of the freedom thus opened to us should be seen in insistence on
the quotation of our product as our own on the London market, and
in the initiation of a steady and efficient and, while
continuous, a self regulatory system of immigration. We are
brought into fair contact with the world of commerce, and of
culture as well, and it will be our own fault if we do not avail
ourselves of the opportunity thus presented.</p>
<p>And further, in that extraordinary impetus given to
enterprise, in one direction by the unexpected and simultaneous
disclosure in districts widely apart of enormous mineral
wealth&mdash;indeed offering "the potentiality of wealth beyond
the dreams of avarice,"&mdash;and in another, by the almost
sudden awakening to the possible magnitude of the sugar industry,
there is sufficient indication that we are emerging from the
condition in which weak and childish localisms can be allowed to
interfere with the general progress and the general good. More,
perhaps than either, the discovery of a process which opens an
ever growing market for our flocks and herds, has infused new
life into a pastoral industry which otherwise seemed likely to be
suffocated by its own luxuriance of production. The far seeing
judgment of that excellent man, the late Thomas S. Mort, has been
vindicated, if not in the kind of process, amply in the results
an efficient one is bringing about: it being in his case, as in
others, that "wisdom is justified in her children," although they
may not be permitted to see the fruition of their labour. I speak
then but the language of truth and soberness, when I say there is
no country on this earth&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Whatever clime the sun's bright
circle warms"</p>
<p>more certain, by the prudent use and husbandry of its
resources, by bold and high principled statesmanship, by wise and
just legislation, to become the fair and fruitful and happy home
of teeming millions, than this colony of Queensland. Let me add
that there is no country whose future may be more marred by the
greed of classes, or of individuals, who cloak an insatiable
avarice of power or wealth beneath the ample folds of an
ostensible patriotism; that there is no country in which it is
more necessary to cast class and even national prejudices on one
side, and to remember that if the earth was created for man to
replenish and subdue, the present inheritors of this vast
territory are not all mankind; nor are the interests of all
others of God's creatures to be subordinated to what a few
thousand souls, scattered over nearly seven hundred thousand
square miles, may be pleased to consider their own.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind these considerations, I have adopted, in the
second volume, a different distribution of matter from that
employed in the first. Instead of carrying on the narrative
generally I divide it under the separate heads under which, for
each subject to be thoroughly understood, it should naturally
fall. Our social progress, our great public works, our state
finance, our land legislation, our agricultural failures, and the
advance in the three great industries which furnish our staple
exports, require to be dealt with from the beginning as, so to
speak, separate wholes. The parliamentary history I include in
the ordinary narrative; because, when the legislative procedure
which relates to the other subjects is eliminated from the
general record, there is not much to be noticed, and what there
is runs easily enough along with the general current of the
history.</p>
<p>I am not unaware of the difficulties and dangers which may
beset a writer who ventures to bring his narrative down, as it
were, to the immediate present. I think it was old Fuller who
remarked, that he who holds a candle to lighten posterity, may
burn his fingers withal&mdash;a fate which might seem certainly
to await one who has mingled not inactively in the disputes of
the day. But as to this I must take my chance; being nevertheless
of opinion that the historian who becomes a partizan, to the
extent that he does so, discredits not only his judgment, but his
accuracy. What facts are necessary for the elucidation and
completeness of Queensland history, will be brought out with such
clearness and vigor as I can exert; what is unnecessary to that
main purpose, and would gratify only mere curiosity, or personal
spite, will be as vigorously suppressed. That some conclusions
should be deducted, some opinions expressed, is inevitable; but I
trust to escape the censure passed by one of our most brilliant
British critics upon a colonial author&mdash;in his day eminent
and useful nevertheless&mdash;that his history was one of his own
sayings and doings, with some references to the colony of which
he professed to write. In the first volume, the object is to
preserve what would be useful and interesting of what would
otherwise be lost; in the second, to present, in a connected and
available form, information enabling the reader, whether in the
colony or in the mother country, to understand how we arrived at
our present position; what that is; and what our possible future
may be; what is required to rectify the errors of our early
career, and to make even our failures contributory to our
success. On the accuracy of the statements made in both volumes,
I challenge the criticisms of my fellow colonists: as to the
value of conclusions drawn from them, that must be left to public
opinion to decide.</p>
<p>It would be ungrateful in me to close these remarks without
expressing my thanks to the friends who have so kindly assisted
me in the search after information. To the late Sir M. C.
O'Connell, the late Mr. Charles Coxen, and the Late Mr. G. H.
Davenport, I was largely indebted. To Mr. A. C. Gregory, Mr. C.
Barton, of Maryborough, Mr. Landsborough, Mr. George Bourne, Mr.
Wm. Thornton&mdash;I am under great obligations; and especially
to the Hon. James Swan for assistance which no other person in
the colony could have rendered. If I were to conclude by thanking
Mr. Petrie, Mr. Walter Hill (the late curator of our Botanical
Gardens), Mr. Warner, senr., Mr. P. Phillips, and the proprietors
of the <i>Queensland Times</i> for the aid rendered me in the
necessary researches into our earlier history, I trust I shall
not be thought ungrateful to many, who, from time to time,
supplied a fact or suggested a question which has been utilized,
although, with a negligence common to authors, the source has
been forgotten. To the President of the Legislative Council, and
the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, my thanks are due for
the access afforded me to the Parliamentary Library; and to many
of the Clergy&mdash;of whom particular mention will be found in
the proper place, I am indebted for facts which they only could
have given me the opportunity of tracing. The courtesy of the
official departments whenever I have had occasion to refer to
them, I gladly acknowledge. I can affirm for myself, that I have
spared no pains in the collection of information, and in testing
the accuracy of that which was obtained; and it only remains for
me to ask the indulgence of the reader for the faults he may find
in the use made of the material so kindly afforded.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">It</span> is difficult to forecast the future
of a colony which, possessing an area of 669,520 square miles,
and a coast line of 2.250, presents so great a variety of
climate, that in portions of its southern districts, it admits of
the successful growth of almost all the European vegetable
products, and in its central and northern territory, affords us
facilities for semi-tropical and tropical cultivation of all
kinds, while its geological formation is so abundantly prolific,
as to include within it almost every species of valuable
mineral&mdash;but which at the time I am writing, is estimated to
possess a population of little more than 213,000 souls. That with
such a population it raises an annual income of nearly two
millions sterling; that its exports (which now include antimony,
coal, gold, silver, tin, rum, sugar, tallow, timber, wool, and
many minor, but rapidly developing articles of native produce)
amounted in value in 1880 to £3,448,160, and its imports to
£3,087,296; that the average deposits in the ordinary banks for
that year amounted to £4,062,716; and in the savings bank, to
£747,089; that its sheep numbered 6,935,967, and its cattle,
3,162,572;&mdash;these facts indicate a present which may be
taken as foreshadowing, under wise legislation and well-devoted
energy, a brilliant future. Nor am I inclined to look upon its
public debt, incurred and authorized of some fourteen and a
quarter millions, as likely to depress the energy of the people,
or to interfere with the development of the colony, although its
increase, unless under a widely different system from the
existing one, would be much to be deplored. We shall have to
count on 1.406 miles of railway in return for the nine millions
of that debt expended upon them; and for the remainder, 5,768
miles of telegraph; costly and necessary, though sometimes
experimental, improvements in our harbors and rivers; many public
works; and an immigration expenditure of a million and a half:
and although some portion of the loans have been applied to what
public loans are too often required for&mdash;meeting the
difference between current income and current outlay, the amount
is comparatively small. When I add, that the colony possesses 345
public schools, employing 989 teachers of various grades in the
instruction of 43,303 pupils, besides 5 grammar schools, and 71
private schools, it may be imagined that material requirements do
not exclusively occupy the public attention.</p>
<p>The reader, who turns to the thirteenth chapter of this
volume, will see what a comparatively humble place Queensland
occupied on the list of British colonies in 1859 to that which
the figures I have quoted show that she does now; but even that
humble position had not been reached without much and persistent
toil and effort, perhaps, considering the small population and
their scanty facilities, more of both than has been shown in the
noisier, and at times obtrusive, interval between the two
periods. It is about a hundred and eleven years since the
occurrence of the first incident which was in due time to be
followed by the occupancy of Moreton Bay. Fifty-four years after
that, the first convict settlement was planted at Brisbane.
Eighteen years more elapsed before the district was proclaimed a
free settlement; and seventeen years of growth and grumbling
ended in 1859 by its creation into a colony. The history of these
periods, so far as it concerns Queensland, and the fluctuations
of condition, of effort, and of hope, which marked their later
years, until at length the colonists congratulated each other
that they were free to govern themselves, I have now to
narrate.</p>
<p>Within a comparatively recent period, proofs have been brought
forward which would give to the Portugese navigators a priority
of discovery on the northern shores of Australia. But whatever
might have been their success&mdash;of which but faint records
have been left&mdash;the Dutch are entitled to the credit of
being the first continuous explorers of the northern, western,
and southern coasts of Australia. Their discoveries have been so
often and so completely described, that it would seem something
like book-making to repeat the description.* The right of Cook to
be considered the first who made any definite investigation of
the greater part of the eastern coast, has been almost
universally conceded, although occasionally even his claims have
been questioned. In a memoir on the Chago Islands ** by Mr.
Dalrymple, a hydrographer of eminence at the commencement of the
present century, he adverts to a manuscript in his possession,
once belonging to Sir Joseph Banks, which, from internal
evidence, he considered to be not later than of the year
1575.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See "Lang's History of New South Wales," vol.
I., chap. i. London, 1832:&mdash;but more especially a series of
articles in the Brisbane weekly newspaper, the Week, for 1872,
well worthy of republication in a separate form.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Royal Geographical Society's Journal, vol.
II. (London, 1832).]</p>
<blockquote>"This very curious manuscript is painted on parchment
with the Dauphin's Arms and contains much lost knowledge.
Kerguelen's Land seems plainly denoted, and the east coast of New
Holland&mdash;as in name it is expressed&mdash;with some curious
circumstances of correspondence to Captain Cook's narrative. What
he names Bay of Inlets, is in the manuscript, called Bay Perdue:
Bay of Isles, R. de beaucoup d'Iles, and where the
<i>Endeavour</i> struck, Caste Dangereuse; so that we may say
with Solomon, there is nothing new under the sun.'"</blockquote>
<p>It would not be just to Cook to hastily accept, in its
entirety, the conclusion here indicated. It is not impossible,
however, that the Dauphin's map may have been shown by Banks, to
whose exertions the sending of Cook was mainly due, to that
navigator, although Hawkesworth's ignorance of its existence may
have prevented its acknowledgement by him in his account of the
voyage.&mdash;All that we know of Cook's character goes to
negative the supposition that he would deliberately appropriate
without acknowledgement the discoveries of a predecessor.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the circumstances
which led to Cook's voyage, for they are over and over again
detailed in a variety of publications readily accessible to the
general reader. I therefore confine myself to such a reference to
Hawkesworth's account of that expedition as may connect its
discoveries with the general narrative of the exploration and
settlement of the colony.</p>
<p>In May, 1770, Cook was on the east coast of Australia, sailing
past "a bay or harbour in which there appeared to be good
anchorage, and which I called Port Jackson," and on the 16th of
that month, he was off Point Danger, the commencement of our
present southern boundary. On the 17th, he was abreast Cape
Moreton.</p>
<blockquote>"From Cape Moreton the land trends away further than
can be seen, for there is a small space where, at this time, no
land is visible, and some on board, having also observed that the
sea looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of
Moreton Bay opened into a river: we had then thirty-four fathoms
of water, and a fine sandy bottom; this alone would have produced
the changes that had been observed in the colour of the water;
and it was by no means necessary to suppose a river to account
for the land at the bottom of the bay not being visible, for
supposing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a
hundred other parts of the coast, it would have been impossible
to see it from the station of the ship. However, if any future
navigator should be disposed to determine the question whether
there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would
not permit us to do, the situation may always be found by three
hills which lie to the northward of it, in latitude of 26° 53'.
These hills lie but a little way inland, and not far from each
other; they are remarkable for the singular form of their
elevation, which very much resembles a glasshouse, and for which
reason I called them the Glass Houses;' the northernmost of the
three is the highest and largest. There are also several other
peaked hills inland, to the northward of these, but they are not
nearly so remarkable."</blockquote>
<p>The mixture of accuracy and error in this extract is curious.
Cook was right in supposing that a river did not flow in the
direction which he named, and wrong in his conjecture as to the
position of that which actually did open into Moreton Bay. It is
quite possible that his suggestions may have influenced Flinders
in his subsequent search, for his name stood then as high in
geographical investigation as Nelson's afterwards did in war.</p>
<p>Leaving Moreton Bay, Cook ran along the north eastern coast of
Australia. Hervey's Bay and Keppel Bay were successively
discovered and named. The little intermediate inlet of Bustard
Bay was named in honor of</p>
<blockquote>"a species of bustard, one of which was shot, as
large as a turkey, and weighing seventeen pounds and a half. We
all agreed that this was the best bird we had eaten since we had
left England."</blockquote>
<p>Port Curtis he appears to have passed in the night. Broad
Sound and Cape Palmerston owe their names to him, as do also
Halifax Bay and Rockingham Bay, "where there appears to be good
shelter and good anchorage, but I did not stay to examine it."
Without much more than mere nautical examination he continued his
voyage to the northern extremity of the coast, and left Booby
Island on the 23rd of August, 1770, having, in the name of the
King of Great Britain, claimed possession of "the entire eastern
coast from latitude 33° to this place, latitude 10½° S." The
territory thus taken he named New South Wales. The island upon
which the ceremony was performed he named Possession Island.</p>
<p>The eighth chapter of the third volume of Hawkesworth's
account is occupied with</p>
<blockquote>"a particular description of the country, its
products and people, a specimen of the language, and some
observations on the currents and tides."</blockquote>
<p>The curious in such matters may find it interesting to compare
Cook's observations with the recorded experience of travellers
and explorers in our own day. His speculations upon the habits of
the aboriginal inhabitants and the natural character and produce
of the country, seem to me to have shared the natural fate which
befalls almost all early theories&mdash;supercession by
conclusions that are derived from more recent and more detailed
investigation.</p>
<p>After the voyage of Captain Cook no thoroughly organised
attempt was made for nearly thirty years at further discovery on
our coasts; but a combination of individual enterprise and public
curiosity, led to an effort, in 1801, to find some river which
should afford access to the interior of the vast island of
Australia. Accordingly, on June 21, in that year, the Lords of
the Admiralty issued their official instructions to</p>
<blockquote>"Matthew Flinders, Esq., commander of His Majesty's
sloop <i>Investigator</i>, at Spithead," to "proceed in her to
the coast of New Holland for the purpose of making a complete
examination and survey of the said coast, on the eastern side of
which His Majesty's colony of New South Wales is
situated."</blockquote>
<p>The circumstances which led to this step are interesting, and
their record can scarcely fail to be instructive.</p>
<p>Shortly after the first settlement of criminals at Port
Jackson, in 1788, Captain Hunter, who had accompanied Phillip,
the first Governor of New South Wales, made a survey of Botany
and Broken Bays and Port Jackson, with most of the rivers falling
into them. In 1795, Hunter returned to New South Wales, as
Governor. He brought with him two vessels of war, the
<i>Reliance</i> and the <i>Supply</i>, and arrived at Sydney in
December of that year. Flinders was then a midshipman, and Bass,
a navigator equally intrepid, was surgeon in the <i>Reliance</i>.
The two joined in various expeditions&mdash;sometimes in an open
boat, sometimes in a vessel hardly better, and together made
their explorations along the coast. In this way they discovered
that Van Diemen's Land, as it was then termed, was an island; and
made the passage of the straits, between it and Australia, named
after Bass by Governor Hunter, at Flinders' express desire.
Shortly after this, and upon Bass's return to England, Flinders,
on his own proposition, was sent on the eastern coast in the
<i>Norfolk</i>, a colonial sloop, of twenty-four tons. His
principal object was</p>
<blockquote>"to explore the Glass House and Hervey's Bays, two
large openings to the northward, of which the entrances only were
known. He had some hope of finding some river discharging itself
at one of these openings, and of being able by its means to
penetrate further into the interior of the country than had been
before effected."</blockquote>
<p>It is this voyage that first connects Flinders with the
history of Queensland. We have two accounts of it written at
different periods by him, by collating which we are enabled to
gain a tolerably clear sight into the facilities he obtained and
the difficulties he encountered. On his return to Sydney he gave
his journal to Governor King, and its substance was published in
1802, by Collins, in his "Account of the English Colony in New
South Wales, from its first settlement in January, 1788, to
August, 1801."</p>
<p>In Flinders' own "Introduction" to the narrative of his second
voyage, he only briefly and technically refers to this one. I
have there, fore adopted the journal as most useful to my
purpose.</p>
<p>Flinders sailed from Sydney on July 8, 1799, and, on the 11th,
discovered, but cannot be said to have explored, Shoal Bay,
inasmuch as he saw nothing of the Clarence River. On the evening
of the 16th, he dropped anchor in Moreton, which he terms Glass
House, Bay&mdash;"about two miles from a low sandy shore on the
west side." The next day he landed with a Port Jackson native
named "Bong-ree," or, as we should now spell it, "Bungaree," and
endeavoured to enter into amicable communication with some of the
natives, who were watching their procedure; but, unfortunately,
the overture on both sides ended in a skirmish, in which one or
two of the aborigines were wounded. From this circumstance
Flinders gave the place the name of Point Skirmish, it being in
fact the southernmost point of Bribie Island. Leaving that point,
he moved up the opening between Bribie Island and the mainland,
which he mistook for a river, and from the quantity of pumice
stone found at high water, called it the Pumice Stone River. The
sloop, which had sprung a leak on he 10th, was examined in the
meantime, and a temporary stoppage having been effected, he again
made sail on the 17th, anchoring off a point which, front the
redness of its cliffs, he called Redcliff Point. He then pulled
over to a "green headland about two miles to the westward," but
found nothing noticeable save a native fishing net. Returning
thence, he combined endeavouring to get further up the bay, and
landed on an island thirty-four miles from Cape Moreton, in
latitude 27° 33' 59" S. This he found to be two or three miles in
circumference, the central part higher than the rest, and covered
with a coat of fine vegetable mould of a reddish colour.</p>
<blockquote>"The trees upon it, among which was the new pine,
were large and luxuriant; beyond this island the bay was
contracted into a river of considerable width indeed, but it
appeared to be so shoal, or, if there was any deep channel, so
difficult of access, that Mr. Flinders gave up all idea of
pursuing it further&mdash;especially as the winds were
obstinately adverse."</blockquote>
<p>He, therefore, returned to Point Skirmish. It was probably the
island of St. Helena on which he landed.</p>
<p>On July 22, he got his sloop into the Pumice Stone. Here he
had her laid on shore and her cargo removed. By the 25th, he had
stopped the leak, reshipped the supplies, and made ready for
sailing again. Out of the six weeks allotted to him, one was
entirely lost through the defects of the <i>Norfolk</i>.</p>
<p>This necessary work being effected, he landed and started for
the Glass House Peaks, and, ascending one of the smaller ones,
took a view of the bay. He seems to have derived little benefit
from his fatigues in the way of discovery; and he returned to the
<i>Norfolk</i> on the 28th. He was detained by bad weather two
more days, and then sailed for Hervey's Bay.</p>
<blockquote>"Having passed fifteen days in Glass House Bay, Mr.
Flinders was enabled to form his judgment of it. It was so full
of shoals that he could not attempt to point out any passage that
would lead a ship into it without danger. The east side of the
bay had not been sounded&mdash;if any existed, it would probably
be found on that side."</blockquote>
<p>His visit to Hervey's Bay at this time was so cursory, that it
is scarcely worth referring to; and, after a hurried inspection,
he sailed for Sydney, where he arrived on August 20.</p>
<p>Fifteen years elapsed between this voyage and the publication
of Flinders' narrative of his second exploration. It is a curious
instance of the fallibility of human observation and memory,
however keen and tried they may be, that we find this experienced
navigator, when recalling his impression of so many years back,
in the epitome of his first voyage prefixed to his "narrative"
thus concluding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I must acknowledge myself to have been disappointed
in not being able to penetrate into the interior of New South
Wales by either of the openings examined in this expedition; but,
however mortifying the conviction might be, it was then an
ascertained fact, that no river of importance intersected the
east coast between the 24th and 39th degrees of south
latitude."</blockquote>
<p>The language of his journal, written on the spot, is much less
positive, and in fact, leaves the question favorably open as
regards the shores of Moreton Bay. Some censure has been visited
on Flinders for a presumed negligence in his search; but in this
it does not seem just to concur. His sloop was leaky, and unfit
for the dangers which so intricate a navigation as that of the
entrance to the Brisbane must have involved. His crew was
small&mdash;only eight men&mdash;his time limited to six weeks,
of which one was lost in the necessary repairs to his crazy
craft, and the winds were adverse. Looking to his orders and his
means, he had not the time or the power for the exploration
required. What is, however, to be regretted, is, that the habit
of acquiescence in the directions of his superiors, seems to have
led him to consider them as comprehending all that it was
desirable he should do. What means he had he used well, but it
did not follow that those means were adequate; had they been so,
and had he been less restricted, the "ascertained fact" might
have been the River Brisbane&mdash;not the absence of any river
on a thousand miles of coast.</p>
<p>Shortly after Flinders returned to Sydney, the <i>Reliance</i>
was ordered home, and on her arrival in England, in 1800,</p>
<blockquote>"the charts of the new discoveries were published,
and a plan was proposed to the Right Honorable Sir Joseph Banks,
for completing the investigation of the coast of Terra Australis;
the plan was approved by that distinguished patron of science and
useful enterprise; it was laid before Earl Spencer, then First
Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, and finally received the
sanction of His Majesty, who was graciously pleased to direct
that the voyage should be undertaken; and I had the honor of
being appointed to the command." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Introduction to narrative, p. 204.]</p>
<p>On June 21, as I have before said, the Admiralty instructions
were issued to Flinders. They were a strange jumble of
inconsistencies. He was to use his best endeavours to discover
harbors, and in case he found any "creek or opening" likely to
lead to an inland sea, he was left at liberty to examine it, or
not, as he should judge expedient or as opportunity might serve.
Much solicitude was expressed touching a plant cabin for the
purpose of sheltering boxes of earth in which were to be placed
"during the survey, such plants, trees, shrubs, etc., as might be
thought suitable for the Royal Gardens at Kew." An ancient sloop,
the <i>Xenophon</i>, crazy and unsound, became the
<i>Investigator</i> for the purpose of the voyage, and was,
without doubt, deemed quite good enough for the employment to
which it was devoted; and the <i>Lady Nelson</i> tender, then at
Sydney, a vessel of similar character, was to be placed under
Flinders' command. An astronomer, a naturalist, a natural history
painter, a landscape painter, a gardener, and a miner, were
amongst the party who accompanied Flinders; but, considering the
official piety of those days, I am somewhat surprised at not
finding a chaplain. William Westall, an artist of no mean note,
was the landscape painter, and some of the illustrations to the
narrative do not detract from either his reputation, or that of
Woolnoth, the engraver. The whole number on board was
eighty-eight. Flinders, with a forethought, whose motive must
excite a smile at the present day, took "salt meat for eighteen
months, knowing how little reliance could be placed on the colony
of New South Wales for that article;" and, to guard against any
contingencies, he left an application to the Admiralty for a
twelve month's general supply, "to be sent after me, and lodged
in the store-houses at Port Jackson for our own use."</p>
<p>On July 18, 1801, the <i>Investigator</i> sailed from
Spithead, and on December 7, was off Cape Leeuwin. Flinders then
leisurely surveyed the southern and eastern coasts&mdash;just
missing the honor of being the discoverer of Port
Phillip&mdash;until he dropped anchor in Sydney Cove on Sunday,
May 9, 1802. Here he found the <i>Lady Nelson</i> waiting for
him. His preparations for the remainder of his voyage occupied
some time, and such amusement as was to be enjoyed he and his
scientific friends participated in. He records with decorous
gravity, that on June 4, being His Majesty's Birthday, Governor
King gave "a splendid dinner to the colony, and the number of
ladies, and civil, military, and naval officers was not less than
forty." But he seems to have neglected none of the more necessary
details of his preliminary work. Some deficiencies in his own
crew were made up by probably "old salts," who were promised
conditional pardon should the report of their behaviour be
favourable. The crew of the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was composed
almost entirely of prisoners. The re-victualling of his ship
occasioned him some perplexity.</p>
<blockquote>"The price of fresh meat at Port Jackson was so
exorbitant, it was impossible to think of purchasing it on the
public account. I obtained one quarter of beef for the ship's
company in exchange for salt meat, and the Governor furnished us
with some baskets of vegetables from his garden. . . In
purchasing a sea stock for the cabin. I paid £3 a-head for sheep,
weighing from thirty to fifty pounds each when dressed. Pigs were
bought at 9d. per pound, weighed alive; geese at 10s. each, and
fowls at 3s.: and Indian corn for the stock cost 5s. a bushel. .
. . From two American vessels which arrived, I purchased 1,483
gallons of rum at 6s. 6d. per gallon, which, with what remained
of our former stock was a proportion for twelve
months."</blockquote>
<p>And thus provided and recruited, he set sail from Sydney for
the northern coast, on July 22, 1802, appointing Hervey's Bay as
a port of <i>rendezvous</i> for the <i>Lady Nelson</i>.</p>
<p>Acting upon his impression that no rivers debouched into
either Shoal Bay or Moreton Bay, he sailed past those openings,
and reached Hervey's Bay in nine days. Port Curtis was his first
noticeable discovery, and with some pains he explored the channel
between that harbor and Keppel Bay. Of the soil in the
neighbourhood he gave a cautious approval. Occasionally the
explorers had communications with the natives, of whom Flinders
speaks in friendly and almost flattering terms. He spent a short
time at Port Bowen, of which Westall gives a spirited drawing;
but was of opinion that not much could be said in praise of the
country around it. Shoal Water Bay met with little higher
appreciation; but Broad Sound he examined with more care. He
appears to have considered the neighbourhood between the sound
and the bay as worth attention:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"There seems, indeed, to be a considerable extent of
land about Broad Sound, and on the peninsula between it and Shoal
Water Bay, which, if not calculated to give a rich return to the
cultivator in wheat, would support much cattle, and produce
maize, sugar, and tobacco; and cotton and coffee would grow upon
the more rocky sides of the hills&mdash;and, probably, even on
Long Island."</blockquote>
<p>He discusses, at some length, the best site for docks, the
value of the timber, and the probability of metallic production,
with a terse directness that contrasts favorably with the flowing
platitudes of the bulk of exploratory descriptions. Having
finished his examination, he sailed for Torres Straits&mdash;thus
missing the Fitzroy and the fine country to the north&mdash;in
order to commence the survey of the now well-known Gulf of
Carpentaria. When he reached the Cumberland Isles, he was
compelled to send the <i>Lady Nelson</i> back to Sydney.</p>
<blockquote>"Instead of saving the crew of the
<i>Investigator</i> in case of accident, which was one of the
principal objects of her attendance, it was too probable we might
be called upon to render that assistance."</blockquote>
<p>There is something odd in the comparison of craziness in these
vessels which such a remark suggests.</p>
<p>Sailing round Cape York, Flinders coasted down the Gulf, and
on November 22, anchored in the channel between Bentinck's and
Sweer's Islands, which he named Investigator Roads. Here he had
his ship examined, when to his alarm and vexation, he found her
rotten from stem to stern. The master and the carpenter
reported</p>
<blockquote>"as their joint opinion, that in less than twelve
months, there will scarcely be a sound timber in her, but that if
she remain in fine weather, and happen no accident, she may run
six months without much risk."</blockquote>
<p>It is impossible not to sympathise with the enthusiastic
navigator in his annoyance.</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot," he says, "express the surprise and sorrow
which this statement occasioned me. According to it, a return to
Port Jackson was almost immediately necessary, as well to secure
the journals and charts of the examinations already made as to
preserve the lives of the ship's company; and my hopes of
ascertaining, completely the exterior form of this immense and,
in many points, interesting country, it not destroyed, would at
least be deferred to an unknown period."</blockquote>
<p>But reflection brought back that determination which formed so
prominent a feature in Flinders' character. He resolved to
finish, if possible, his survey of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
"when the fair wind should come to proceed by the west to Port
Jackson, if the ship should prove capable of a winter's passage
along the south coast; and if not, to make for the nearest port
in the East Indies." He therefore coasted past the Groote
Eylandte and Cape Arnheim, examining the bays as he passed, and
exploring and naming Arnheim Bay, of which he speaks slightingly;
and then, driven by sickness and fear of his vessel, he sailed
for Timor on March 6, 1803, to recruit his health and refit, so
far as refitment might avail. On the 10th of the following June
he arrived in Port Jackson, when, on a survey of the
<i>Investigator</i> she was pronounced to be "not worth repairing
in any country, and impossible to be made fit for sea."</p>
<p>His first purpose was to renew his voyage, but unable to
obtain a fitting ship, he took passage for England. The vessel in
which he sailed was wrecked, and he escaped with some difficulty,
reaching Sydney in September. Here he obtained a small
brig&mdash;the <i>Cumberland</i>&mdash;and proceeded on his
homeward voyage through Torres Straits. He was compelled to put
into the Mauritius by the leaky condition of his ship, and
anchored on December 17, 1803, in Port Louis. There he found ir
command one of the obnoxious products thrown up from the depths
by the French Revolution&mdash;a man of coarse manners, narrow
mind, and ignorant assumption, named De Caen. He, at once
availing himself of the pretext that the pass given by the French
Government was for the <i>Investigator</i>, and not for the
<i>Cumberland</i>, professed to doubt Flinders' identity, treated
him with great harshness, and detained him as a prisons] for
nearly seven years, taking possession of the <i>Cumberland</i>,
and appropriating his papers as well. It was not till towards the
end of October, 1810, that Flinders reached home, having been
released in the previous June. Various circumstances so hindered
him, that his narrative was not published till May, 1814.</p>
<p>Here, so far as Queensland is concerned, the immediate
interest of that narrative terminates; but his connection with
the early surveys of our colony, the accuracy of his charts, and
the value of his investigation as data for succeeding navigators
and explorers on the coast of Australia secure for Flinders a
very high place in the list of those from whose labors we have
benefited. His remarks upon the nature of the country and upon
the natives with whom he came in contact, are interesting in
themselves, but not sufficiently important to warrant quotation,
especially as his conjectures have long been superseded by the
knowledge and experience of the explorers and settlers of our own
day.</p>
<p>After the termination, in 1815, of the long war which followed
the French Revolution, the attention of the British Government
was again turned to the examination of the Australian coasts, and
Lieutenant Phillip Parker King was chosen for the work. He was
directed to proceed to Sydney, where the then Governor,
Major-General Macquarie, was to provide him with a vessel and
crew; and the well-known Allan Cunningham, the botanist and
explorer, was sent with him. The old notion of discovering some
river likely to lead to an interior navigation of Australia,
seems, from the instructions given to King, to have strongly
impressed itself on the Admiralty. King sailed from Sydney in the
<i>Mermaid</i> on December 22, 1817, to survey Bass' Straits and
the western coast. Returning, he started for the eastern coast in
May, 1820, Rodd's Bay seems the only special discovery made by
him on this voyage. On a third survey he simply amplified and
corrected his preceding work, finishing his cruise on April, 25,
1822. His painstaking diligence and accuracy of observation, have
secured him a high reputation among our best hydrographers, and a
considerable mass of valuable material was collected by him and
Cunningham. One result of these voyages was the attempt to form a
British settlement at Port Essington on the northern coast,
which, after much outlay and trouble, was abandoned. Beyond
casual mention, its history scarcely deserves connection with
that of Queensland; although of late years, and in connection
with South Australia, it has acquired some notoriety as Port
Darwin.</p>
<p>After King's voyage the desirability of further exploration on
our eastern and northern coast&mdash;except as it presented
itself to a few enthusiastic geographers&mdash;seems to have
faded away. What, however, the love of science or the demands of
curiosity could not obtain, was at length granted to the
necessities of a penal settlement. Twenty-one years after
Flinders entered Port Curtis, the existing establishments under
the Government of New South Wales proving inadequate to the
demands created by the increasing shipment of criminals from the
home country, his discoveries were turned to, in the hope of
finding a suitable spot towards the north for a new penal depôt.
He had spoken not unfavourably of the country in that
neighbourhood, and after some consideration, the then
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Lieutenant Oxley was
despatched in the old <i>Mermaid</i>, repaired and fitted for the
purpose, in quest of an available site. He left Sydney on October
23, 1823, and anchored in Port Curtis on the 5th of the following
November. There he occupied sixteen days in "a minute examination
of the south-west coast of this port, extending from the north
head of Bustard Bay to Mount Lawson." South from Gatcombe Head he
"discovered a rapid mountain stream, which received the name of
the Boyne, and then examined the country around;" but as the
result of his minute researches, he came to the opinion that Part
Curtis afforded no site eligible for a settlement.* The country
in the vicinity of Road's Bay, he viewed with like disapproval,
and disappointed and discontented, sailed for Moreton Bay, where
he anchored on November 25. Here an unexpected consolation
awaited him.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The value of Oxley's opinion on such points is
questionable. On another occasion he is found saying, "We had
demonstrated beyond a doubt that no river could fall into the sea
between Cape Otway and Spencer's Gulf&mdash;at least none
deriving its waters from the eastern coast&mdash;and that the
country south of the parallel of 34° and west of the meridian
141° 30' east was uninhabitable and useless for the purposes of
civilised man." The country thus condemned by wholesale,
comprises one of the finest portions of the present colony of
Victoria, including Gippsland and its lakes.]</p>
<blockquote>"Early on the 2nd of December following," says his
report, "when examining Moreton Bay, we had the satisfaction to
find the tide sweeping us up a considerable inlet between the
first mangrove island and the mainland. The muddiness and the
taste of the water, together with the abundance of fresh water
molluscs, assured us we were entering a large river, and a few
hours ended our anxiety on that point by the water becoming quite
fresh, while no diminution had taken place in the size of the
river after passing what I called 'Sea Roach.' "</blockquote>
<p>The river thus entered was the Brisbane.</p>
<p>But there was a good deal of disingenuousness, and almost
dishonesty, in this report. The first fresh water molluscæ appear
to me to have been two poor fishermen named Pamphlet and
Finnigan, who had left Sydney with two others in the previous
March, to fetch cedar from the Five Islands, to the south of Port
Jackson. A gale of wind drove them out to sea; and after
suffering great hardships&mdash;one of the party dying of
thirst&mdash;the survivors were cast upon Bribie Island. One of
them started to find his way to New South Wales, and was never
more heard of, and the two named were compelled to stay with the
blacks. From these men Oxley received intelligence of a large
river falling into the south end of the bay which they had
crossed. He immediately acted upon it, and taking Finnigan with
him, met with the fresh water molluscæ, and the usual phenomenon
of fresh water, also in the Brisbane itself, only twenty miles
from its mouth.** It would not have detracted from Mr. Oxley's
reputation had he frankly admitted the value of the information
gained from Pamphlet and Finnigan, and been content with the
merit of perseveringly following up their accidental discovery.
His report was silent upon that portion of the business; and he
returned to Sydney to receive the thanks of the Government, and
the congratulations of his friends. Whether the two poor
fishermen ever even knew the value of the service they had
rendered, has not, that I can find, been recorded.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Narrative of Oxley's Expedition, by
Uniacke in "New South Wales." London 1820.]</p>
<p>Oxley's report&mdash;exaggerated and incorrect as it
was&mdash;produced considerable sensation, not only in the
colony, but on its publication at home, in much wider and better
informed circles. He told the world of a noble river&mdash;not
subject to floods, probably navigable for vessels of burden fifty
miles beyond the termination of his journey, and that termination
seventy miles from Bribie Island. The width of the river at the
point where he commenced his return, he reported as half-a-mile,
and its depth at eight fathoms. Exaggerations like these render
it difficult to determine how far he really did ascend the
Brisbane, or whether he reached its first large
tributary&mdash;the Bremer&mdash;as subsequently supposed by
Major Lockyer. The Brisbane is a noble and beautiful stream
without being able to lay claim to all the attributes with which
Mr. Oxley's imagination invested it. His theory as to its source,
being based upon the assumption that it did not take its rise in
mountainous country, need not be further alluded to.</p>
<p>But upon all these points, no contradiction could be, or at
all events was, at the time given to him: nor did it much matter
to the then Governor of New South Wales, whether the river was a
mile or a quarter of a mile wide sixty miles from its mouth. Sir
Thomas Brisbane was relieved from a difficulty by the discovery
of a suitable locality for his new penal settlement, and probably
not displeased that the newly-discovered river was named in his
honor. So Moreton Bay was fixed upon as a fit position for a
fresh prison, and the process of civilisation, according to the
custom of those days, began. Fifty-five years had passed since
Cook first saw and named Cape Moreton; sixteen years of miserable
occupancy by a wretched population were to come.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">To</span> a great extent, the history of one
penal settlement is the history of all penal settlements. The
line of demarkation between keeper and criminal was strong and
distinct, and it became gradually a settled thing that, whether a
convict might or might not be occasionally right, the master
could never be wrong. The result was natural. The consciousness
of impunity for the governor, and of degradation in the governed,
could not but tend to lessen the care with which authority was
exercised, and the perception of just cause for its exertion. The
beginning of wrong, as much as of strife, is like the pouring
forth of water; and when the personal feeling which, in a small
community, and more in such a community, must result from every
punishment, whether inflicted justly or unjustly, was once
roused, every repetition of offence and its consequent suffering,
not only widened the distance between the judge and the offender,
but deadened the sense of justice and appreciation of guilt; and
thus, by insensible degrees, a hardness of feeling has been found
to spring up in all these settlements, equally in the gaoler as
in the prisoners. They became "stern to inflict and stubborn to
endure," without much reference to anything but facility of
infliction and capacity of endurance. The authorities drifted
into cruelty, and the criminals deepened in crime.</p>
<p>Looking at such influences as almost inseparable from the
system upon which the penal settlement of Moreton Bay was
governed, I am not so much inclined to consider the successive
commandants as either naturally or consciously the tyrants they
have been described, and possibly in some cases were; or all the
prisoners as the refuse of human kind. What a different
discipline might have resulted in, it is useless now to speculate
upon. The Christian virtues are not. I presume, supposed to grow
naturally in any purgatory, or the moral perceptions to be
quickened by an enforced abstinence from every ostensible kind of
mental occupation. That, from 1824 to 1839, Moreton Bay must have
been a place of torment to every conscientious man of right
feeling in it, can scarcely be doubted, when we consider the
facts as to either Government or conduct which have been allowed
to escape from the dark secrecy at first enforced to conceal
still darker deeds, and since acquiesced in from a sense of
common disgrace.</p>
<p>It may be admitted, without offence to the feelings of those
who remain of the advocates or opponents of transportation during
the long struggle which preceded its abolition, that the general
raault of that system was deteriorative of the moral sense of the
colonies in the same manner as the existence of slavery, while
oppressive and degrading to the slave, was gradually lowering the
moral perceptions of the slave-holder. In the newspapers of
Moreton Bay, for instance, subsequent to the cessation of
transportation to New South Wales. I see more than one record of
meetings held in favor of the introduction of exiles, as it was
called, at which that introduction was enforced wholly from a
presumed necessity for cheap labor.* And I am quite sure that,
whatever might be the fashionable phraseology in the then
colonial circles, where full publicity obtained, the advocacy of
transportation as a secondary punishment arose more from a belief
in its value as furnishing a supply of cheap labor than from any
other cause. A species, if not of contempt, at least of
disregard, for the feelings and rights of their servants,
naturally are among those accustomed to the enforced labor of
prisoners. On the other hand, the servitude thus compiled was, in
the great majority of instances, a series of deceptions and
shifts to avoid the labour imposed, When a harsh employer
resorted to extreme measures, so did his servants; the one
appealed to the magistrates for vengeance, the other ran away.
This state of relation between employer and employed was a sad
contrast to the freedom of engagement and reciprocity of
obligation which prevails in a free community, and it is quite
impossible that it could have existed so long without a
mischievous influence on both classes. It is fortunate that the
absolute isolation of Moreton Bay during the penal portion of its
existence, and the cessation of the penal transportation system
prior to its being thrown open as a free settlement, greatly
mitigated the effects of that system to this colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I take from a report in the <i>Moreton Bay
Courier</i> of February 27, 1847, the following in
illustration:&mdash;It was absolutely that labourers should be
introduced into this district. It was only those who resided in
the squatting districts who felt severely the present deficiency
of labor: it was the great expense to which they were subjected
in procuring that, had induced him, and others with energetic
measures for facilitating the introduction of laborers from North
Australia or Van Dieman's Land into this district."&mdash;Speech
at a meeting held at Ipswich, February 22, 1847. North Australia
was the name proposed for an intended new penal settlement.]</p>
<p>But that isolation, while it lasted, led to great cruelty. I
have heard narratives of punishment so ingenious in their
refinement of torture, that I am almost disinclined to give
credence to the facts they embodied; and yet, from the general
concurrence of testimony, can hardly refuse assent And, moreover,
statements of the kind involve the citation of authority&mdash;a
citation in most cases from the evidence of sufferers, and,
therefore, it these days, almost as grievous as the original
infliction, It seems almost indispensable to abstain from
particular instances, although the general conclusions I have
derived are exceedingly unfavourable to the commandants of the
day. Only, therefore, when proved by independent evidence of the
neglect or cruelty of officials, will either be alluded to.</p>
<p>As I have said, Oxley's report of his discoveries met with
high admiration; but whether from the superior weight attached to
the authority of Flinders, or from his own misgivings, the first
settlement was ordered to be not on the shores of the Brisbane,
but on the land named by Flinders, Redcliff Point. The brig Amity
was sent from Sydney in September, 1824, having on board Mr.
Oxley and Lieutenant Millar, with detachment of the 40th, having
in charge thirty prisoners, to make the necessary preparations.
But the site being found objectionable, a party was sent up the
Brisbane to find a more eligible spot. They landed some where in
what we now call Petrie's Bight, and found what they were it
search of. The establishment was accordingly removed, and the
first stet towards the foundation of the City of Brisbane was
thus taken. Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane shortly after visited
the infant settlement and approved of the new site, ordering,
however, that the buildings already erected at Redcliff
Point&mdash;such as they were&mdash;should be left for the use of
the natives. The natives showed their matter-of-fact appreciation
of the legacy by naming the abandoned place "Humpy Bong," which
may be freely translated "the dead houses;" and in process of
time the "dead houses" disappeared: I believe but few traces of
them remain.</p>
<p>For little more than a year the settlement went on in the
usual slow process of receiving additional drafts of convicts,
and settling them to the useless and monotonous employments of
the day: but in 1825, Captain Logan, of the 57th regiment, was
sent to take charge. He seems to have been a man of great energy
and indomitable will, but, as is often the case with men thus
endowed, of irritable temperament, and when excited, of
ungovernable passion. During his government most of the old
convict buildings were erected. The prisoners' barracks&mdash;the
inscrutable looking structure we call our observatory, then used
as a windmill&mdash;a treadmill in close proximity, an hospital,
a receiving store, and four separate convict stations, were all
due to his energetic activity. He first discovered the river
named after him on the south-eastern side of the bay, on the
banks of which we have now a considerable and thriving
population. I am sorry to have to record, that on his return from
this discovery, wearied and hungry, some breach of discipline
being reported to him, his success inspired no feeling of lenity
towards the unhappy prisoners. A few years ago there was still in
South Brisbane an old pine stump, the remnants of a tree to
which, on this occasion, all who were complained of were tied,
and suffered the unsparing infliction of the lash.</p>
<p>Logan's energy was not well seconded, nor indeed, was his own
zeal always according to knowledge. Valueless land was cleared
because the overseers, being rewarded in proportion to quantity,
chose the worst and most lightly wooded, and sometimes useful
timber was destroyed to obtain worthless land, for, as in our
pine forests, the two are often found together. There are
well-established anecdotes of one of his superintendents sowing
the dressed rice of commerce on Eagle Farm in full expectancy of
a crop; and of another, on being asked for a saw-set, referring
the applicant to the grindstone. With such assistants, it is not
to be wondered at, that jetties were built where they were
unapproachable by vessels, and vessels completed where it was
impossible to launch them. There was much in all this, in
accordance with the practice of all penal colonies, which seems
to have been to find employment for the convicts; how, or upon
what, being quite a secondary question.</p>
<p>In the first year of Logan's commandantship, he was visited by
Major Lockyer, an officer of his own regiment. During his stay in
the settlement, Lockyer explored the Brisbane to its junction
with one of its principal tributaries, although which, seems
uncertain. The creek now named after him can scarcely have been
the one, for he represents the Brisbane and the Lockyer as
navigable for a whale boat for one hundred and thirty miles from
the mouth of the former, the last fifty miles being upon the
Lockyer itself. Only in very rainy seasons would the Lockyer be
navigable one mile continuously, and, at these times, the
strength of the flood would be such as to render the passage of a
boat up it altogether impossible. It is not improbable that he
rowed up the Bremer, and mistook it for the higher tributary.
But, accuracy was by no means a necessary attribute of the
narratives of some of the travellers of those early days.</p>
<p>While Logan was alternately exploring and botanising, and
flogging, in the Moreton Bay district, Allan Cunningham
penetrated the interior from another direction, and discovered
the Darling Downs. Previously to the year 1827, the large tract
of country "lying on the western side of the Great Dividing
Range, between Hunter's River, in latitude 32°. and Moreton Bay,
latitude 27° south," was unknown. Oxley had, at one time,
contemplated an expedition in that direction, but sickness and
infirmity had gained upon him apace, and prevented his active
participation in the work. The Government of New South Wales,
seeing the possible advantages that might result, furnished an
adequate equipment for five months, and placed the expedition
under the direction of Cunningham. On April 20, 1827, he started
from a station on the Upper Hunter. New South Wales, thence
skirting the Liverpool Plains, and crossing a river which he at
first thought the Peel River of Oxley, but subsequently named the
Gwydir, he continued in a northerly, and afterwards in a
north-easterly, direction through a country parched by drought,
until he reached a second river, which he named the Dumaresq.
Thence being driven by the sterility of the district in a more
easterly direction, he reached, on June 5,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"the confines of a superior country. It was
exceedingly cheering to my people, after they had traversed a
waste, oftentimes of the most forbiddingly arid character, for a
space more or less of eighty miles, and had borne with no
ordinary patience a degree of privation to which I had well nigh
sacrificed the weaker of my horses, to observe from a ridge which
lay on our course, that they were within a day's march of open
clowns of unknown extent, which stretched easterly to the base of
a lofty range of mountains, distant apparently about twenty-five
miles. On the 6th and following day, we travelled throughout the
whole extent of these plains to the following of the mountains
extending along their eastern side, and the following is the
substance of my observation on their extent, soil, and
capability.
<p>"These extensive tracts of clear pastoral country, which were
subsequently named Darling Downs, in honor of His Excellency the
Governor, are situated on or about the mean parallel of 28° S.,
along which they stretch east eighteen statute miles to the
meridian of 152°. Deep ponds, supported by streams from the high
lands immediately to the eastward, extend along their central
lower flats, and these, when united in a wet season, become an
auxiliary to the Condamine river, a stream which winds its course
along the south-western margin. The downs, we remarked, varied in
breadth in different parts of their lengthened surface; at their
western extremity they appeared not to exceed a mile and a half,
while towards their eastern limits their width might be estimated
at three miles. The lower ground, thus permanently watered,
presents flats which furnish an almost inexhaustible range of
cattle pasture at all seasons of the year: the grasses and
herbage generally exhibiting, in the depth of winter, an
extraordinary luxuriance of growth. From these central grounds,
rise downs of a rich black and dry soil, and of very ample
surface; and as they furnish an abundance of grass, and are
conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the reach of those
floods which take place on the flats in a season of rains, they
constitute a valuable and sound sheep pasture. We soon reached
the base of some hills connected laterally with that stupendous
chain of mountains, the bold outline of which we had beheld with
so much interest during the three preceding days. These hills we
found clothed from their foot upwards with an underwood of the
densest description, in the midst of which, and especially on the
ridges, appeared a pine which I immediately discovered to be the
same species as that observed in 1842, on the Brisbane river.
Encamping, I ascended a remarkable square-topped mount, which
formed the termination of one of these ridges, and from its
summit had a very extensive view of the country lying between
north and south towards the west. At N. and N.N.W., we observed a
succession of heavily timbered ridges extending laterally from
the more elevated chain of mountains immediately to the east,
which evidently forms the great dividing range in this part of
the country, whilst from the north-west to west and thence to
south, within a range of twenty miles, a most beautifully
diversified landscape, made up of hill and dale, woodland and
plain, appeared before us.</p>
<p>"Large patches of land, perfectly clear of trees, lying to the
north of Darling Downs, were named Peel's Plains, whilst others,
bearing to the south and south-east, and which presented an
undulated surface, with a few scattered trees, were named after
the late Mr. Canning. Directing our view beyond Peel's Plains to
the north-west, an expanse of flooded country met the eye,
evidently a continuation of those vast levels which we had
frequently observed in the progress of our journey, extending to
the westward of our line of route, and which, it was now
perceived, were continued northerly, at least to the parallel of
27°.</p>
<p>"In a valley which led to the immediate base of the mountain
barrier, I fixed my northernmost encampment, determining, as I
had not the means of advancing further in consequence of the
state of my provisions, and the low condition of my horses, to
employ a short period in a partial examination of the principal
range, to the western base of which we had penetrated from the
southward through a considerable portion of barren interior. In
exploring the mountains immediately above our tents, with a view
more especially of ascertaining how far a passage could be
effected over them to the shores of Moreton Bay, a remarkable
excavated part of the Main Range was discovered, which appeared
likely to prove a very practicable pass through these mountains
to the eastward.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Interior discovery of New South Wales, by
Allan Cunningham, Esq., Journal of Royal Geographical Society,
vol. ii., p. 3.&mdash;The "excavated part," mentioned in the
text, is the remarkable one in the Main Range, visible from
Windmill Hill, Brisbane, and now very properly named
"Cunningham's Gap."]</p>
<p>I have been thus copious in extracting Cunningham's
description of the Darling Downs, although it has been frequently
quoted before, not only because its unassuming accuracy contrasts
so remarkably with the inflated glorification of so many other
explorers, but also because his discovery exerted a far greater
influence upon the progress of the colony than any made by his
contemporaries, or almost by his successors. In fact, I know of
none in Australia that can be compared to it in that respect,
save, perhaps, the finding of gold upon the advance of Victoria.
It was really the opening of that vast expanse of territory
which, running northerly and to the west of the Dividing Range,
now supports its sheep in millions, and is yet in the infancy of
development. I am not aware whether the gentlemen whose stations
spread over the Downs have paid the fitting tribute to
Cunningham's memory of a memorial on the spot where his
northernmost camp was fixed; but, if not, it is to be presumed
that want of the requisite information has alone prevented this
being done. That such an obstacle shall exist no longer, I notice
that the site of that camp was determined by Cunningham to be
latitude 28° 10" 45' S.; longitude 152° 7" 45' E.; variation of
the compass 8° 18" E.</p>
<p>On June 16, Cunningham put his people in motion on his return
homeward. He attempted to shape a more easterly course than that
he had arrived by, but soon became involved in a mountainous and
frightful region from which he had some difficulty in extricating
his party. At length, attaining a lower level, he was enabled to
pursue his journey, and reached his point of departure, thirteen
weeks after leaving it. On reporting his discoveries to the
Government, they directed their attention to a search for some
communication between the new country and the coast, and an
expedition to test its practicability was resolved upon, the
conduct of which was again committed to Cunningham.</p>
<p>In the meantime Logan had not been idle. He traced the Bremer
River from its junction with the Brisbane to the site of the
present town of Ipswich, which, from the nature of the hills in
its vicinity, he designated the Limestone Hills. To utilise the
limestone was the next step, and a kiln was built, and
lime-burning commenced. These operations were disturbed by the
aborigines, to protect the burners from whom a few soldiers were
stationed at the place. Logan found the lime useful in his
building operations, and Cunningham narrates, that from 300 to
400 bushels were burned weekly at the station, and conveyed to
Brisbane by boats. Coal was also found, both above and below the
homestead station, and on the banks of creeks dipping to the
Bremer, as well as in the bed of the river itself.</p>
<p>In 1828, Cunningham left Port Jackson for Moreton Bay, to
ascertain the possibility of connecting the coast with the
interior. Immediately on his arrival, Logan and himself attempted
to reach the Gap by following up the course of the Logan River,
and by Mount Lindsay. In this they were foiled; but, after a
short interval of rest, Cunningham again started&mdash;this time
alone&mdash;following up the line of the Bremer, and its main
tributary, in a westerly direction. He left the settlement on
August 18, and in a week reached the Gap.</p>
<blockquote>"The summit of the pass appeared before us, bounded
on each side by most stupendous heads, towering at least 2,000
feet above it. Here the difficulties of the passage commenced. We
had now penetrated to the actual foot of the pass without the
smallest difficulty; it now remained to ascend by a steep slope
to the level of its entrance. This slope is occupied by a very
close wood in which red cedar, sassafras, palms, and other
ornamental intertropical trees are frequent. Through this shaded
wood we penetrated, climbing up a steep bank of very rich loose
earth in which large fragments of a very compact rock (a
whinstone) are bedded. At length we gained the foot of a wall of
bare rock which we found stretching from the southward into the
pass. This face of naked rock we perceived (by tracing its base
northerly) gradually to fall to the common level, so that,
without the smallest difficulty, and to my utmost surprise, we
found ourselves on the highest part of the pass, having fully
ascertained the extent of the difficult part from the entrance
into the wood to this point not to exceed 400 yards. We now
pushed our way through this extraordinary defile, and in less
than half a mile of level surface, clothed with a thick brush of
plants common to the Brisbane River, reached the opposite side of
the Main Range, when I observed the water fall westerly to
Miller's Valley beneath us. Climbing the northern summit of Mount
Mitchell, which bounds the pass on the south, it was with no
small pleasure that I passed my eye over the beautiful tract of
country at which my labors of last year had closed."

<p>Having thus established the practicability of communication
from the Downs to the sea-board, Cunningham returned to Sydney,
and laid the journal of his expedition before the Governor, Sir
Ralph Darling. In the following year he again made a voyage to
Moreton Bay, botanical research being the main object of his
journey; but he&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"found a short period of his leisure to devote to
geographical enquiry; and accordingly, in an excursion to the
north-west, I explored that stream (the Brisbane) far towards its
source, through an irregular country, which presented much
diversity of surface to interest the geographer. During that
short journey, in which I employed a small party about six weeks,
I traced the principal branch of the river as far as latitude 26°
52', until the channel assumed the character of a chain of very
shallow stagnant pools. In this excursion I made such
observations as fully established two facts, viz.&mdash;That the
Brisbane River, at one period supposed ** to be the outlet of the
marshes of the Macquarie, &amp;c., originates on the eastern side
of the Dividing Range, its chief sources being in elevated lands
lying almost on the coast line between the parallels of 26° and
27°; and that the main ranges which separate the coast waters
from those that flow inland continue to the north in one unbroken
chain as far as the eye could discern from a commanding station
near my most distant encampment up the river, and present no
opening or hollow part in their elevated ridge through which to
admit of a road being made to the interior beyond them. My pass,
therefore, through those lofty mountains&mdash;the mean elevation
of which above the shores of Moreton Bay, cannot be less than
4,000 feet&mdash;seems thus the only opening to the interior
country, from the coast, between the parallels of 26° and 29°
south." ***</blockquote>

<p class="foot">[*** Interior discovery in New South Wales,
R.G.S. Journal, vol. ii., pp. 117, 118.]</p>
<p>In this last journey of Cunningham in the Moreton Bay
district, he had three collisions with the natives, seemingly
without the slightest provocation on his side. His humanity was
as conspicuous as his courage in these encounters, which resulted
in no great damage to the explorers or their assailants. His
opinion as to the impracticability of reaching the Downs from the
seaward, except by the "Gap," has been refuted by subsequent
experience, which will be narrated in its proper place. But I am
not surprised that he arrived at that erroneous conclusion, for,
from the peculiar overlapping of the spurs which project eastward
from the Main Range&mdash;in some cases for many
miles&mdash;there is not, that I am aware, a single break
perceptible from the plains below, except the "Gap" in the
mountain wall, between the parallels he mentions.</p>
<p>When Cunningham had completed his task, in the discovery of a
line of communication between Brisbane and the Downs, and thus
increased a hundredfold the value of that great pastoral
interior, the zeal of the Government seems to have cooled, and
nothing was done till long afterwards to improve the natural
facilities, or reduce the natural difficulties of the route. The
principal object of the local authorities appears to have been
the perfect isolation of the settlement (approach to which,
within fifty miles, was strictly prohibited), and this so far as
they could they vigorously maintained. Captain Logan continued
his botanical and exploratory surveys, and his iron severity
until October, 1830, when he was murdered while absent on a short
expedition. He had left his camp in the morning, and, not
returning, the men attached to his party, searching without
effect, returned and reported his loss. Captain Clunie, the next
in command, sent a party out, who, on the fifth day of their
search, came upon the dead body of Logan, pierced with a spear,
and beaten with waddies. Much indignation has been levelled at
the "cruel and ferocious blacks," who were assumed to have been
the murderers; but there seems reason to suppose that the
contemporary rumours of participation in the murder, by some of
the white criminals, were not altogether unfounded. So far as I
have been able to ascertain, that impression still remains among
the few survivors of that period. Logan's body was conveyed to
Sydney and received the honor of a public funeral.</p>
<p>After Logan's death, Captain Clunie (of the 17th) succeeded to
the commandantship, which he held about four years, during which
time the course of events in the settlement proper, presented
nothing but its ordinary monotonous round. On his removal in
1835, he was succeeded by Captain Fyans (of the 4th), who
remained only two years. Some of the most interesting memoranda I
have been able to collect touching the penal period, I have
derived from the journal of a visit to Moreton Bay during his
tenure of office, published in London in 1843. The writer, James
Backhouse, a benevolent Quaker, accompanied by his friend George
Washington Walker, who afterwards settled in Tasmania, left
England in 1831, and spent nearly seven years in travelling
through the known Australian settlements of the day. Actuated, in
the quaint language of the recommendatory letters of the society,
by an apprehension of religions duty resting on their minds to
visit in the love of the Gospel some of the inhabitants of the
British colonies of New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and South
Africa, these benevolent minded men did not spare themselves in
the execution of their design. At some risk, and with some
personal fatigue they travelled during nearly seven years through
New South Wales and Tasmania, and visited Norfolk Island, and the
result of their impressions, while not wanting in shrewdness, is
singularly free from acrimonious or unnecessary censure. In the
fourth year of their journeyings, they obtained permission from
Sir Richard Bourke, at the time Governor of the colony, to visit
Moreton Bay, where they arrived in 1836, and were received by
Captain Fyans with "all the attention and accommodation our
circumstances required." Their attention was first directed to
the settlement, and I extract their description of Brisbane as it
appeared to them.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>3rd month, 29th day:</i>&mdash;After making a
hearty breakfast, we set out to inspect the settlement of what is
called Brisbane Town: it consists of the houses of the Commandant
and other officers, the barracks for the military, and those for
the male prisoners, a treadmill, stores, &amp;c. It is prettily
situated on the north bank of the River Brisbane, which is
navigable fifty miles further up for small sloops, and has some
fine cleared and cultivated land on the south side bank opposite
the town. Adjacent to the Government House, are the Commandant's
garden, and twenty-two acres of Government gardens for the growth
of sweet potatoes, cabbages, and other vegetables for the
prisoners. Bananas, grapes, guavas, pine apples, citrons, lemons,
shaddocks, etc., thrive luxuriantly in the open ground. The
climate being nearly tropical, sugar canes are grown for fencing,
and there are a few thriving coffee plants, but not old enough to
bear fruit. The bamboo and Spanish reed have been introduced. . .
Coffee and sugar will probably at some time be cultivated as
crops. The surrounding country is undulating and covered with
trees. To the west there is a range of high woody hills distant,
in a direct line, four miles. . . . The treadmill is generally
worked by twenty-five prisoners at a time, but when it is used as
a special punishment, sixteen are kept upon it fourteen hours,
with only the interval of release afforded by four being off at a
time in succession. They feel this extremely irksome at first,
but, notwithstanding the warmth of the climate, they become so
far accustomed to the labour by long practice as to bear the
treadmill with comparatively little disgust, after working upon
it for a considerable number of days. Many of the prisoners were
occupied in landing cargoes of maize or Indian corn from a field
down the river, and others in divesting it of the husks. To our
regret, we heard an officer swearing at the men, and using other
improper and exasperating language. The practice is forbidden by
the Commandant; but it is not uncommon, and, in its effects, is,
perhaps, equally hardening to those who are guilty of it, and
those who are under them. . . . We visited the prisoners'
barracks&mdash;a large stone building, calculated to accommodate
1,000 men, but now occupied by 311. We also visited the
penitentiary for female prisoners, seventy-one of whom are here.
Most of them, as well as of the men, have seen re-transported for
crimes that have been nurtured by strong drink. The women were
employed in washing, needlework, picking oakum, and nursing. A
few of them were very young. Many of them seemed far from
sensible of their miserable condition." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Narrative of a visit to the Australian
Colonies, by James Backhouse. London, 1843.]</p>
<p>We read at this day, with some surprise, not unmixed with
pity, that at the Eagle Farm establishment there were forty
females employed in field labor. They were kept in close
confinement during the night, and strictly watched in the day
time; yet it was found very difficult to maintain order. Some
wore chains to keep them from absconding. What the life must have
been that rendered association with the blacks of Moreton Bay
preferable to its endurance, must be left to those who choose to
dwell upon the subject to conceive. Any reformatory effect must
have been equally beyond expectation and possibility; and to say
the truth, there seems to have been little effort in that
direction. Backhouse nowhere mentions an official religious
instructor as resident on the settlement.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>4th month, 1st day</i>, being the day called Good
Friday,' no work was exacted from the prisoners, but they, with
the military and civil officers, whether Protestant or Roman
Catholic, assembled as on First days in the chapel,** when the
prayers and lessons of the Episcopal Church, with a few omissions
in deference to the Roman Catholics, were read in a becoming
manner by the superintendent of convicts." And, "at Eagle Farm,
we again visited the female prisoners, for whom a selection of
tracts were left with their superintendent; they expressed
thankfulness for them, being very destitute of books&mdash;even
of Bibles, which the prisoners generally have not access to even
on First days."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** For many years used as a Supreme Court House,
and for other official purposes, but now (1881) pulled down and
the site sold.]</p>
<p>When leaving the settlement Messrs. Backhouse and Walker were
detained at the Pilot Station by contrary winds, and they landed
at Amity Point for change, as well as for the performance of
their self-imposed duties. This occurring in April, the weather
was hot, and the travellers gave some handkerchiefs to the boat's
crew in acknowledgment of their services.</p>
<blockquote>"Though prisoners, they may be allowed to wipe the
perspiration from their faces with them; but so strict is the
discipline, that they would not be allowed to tie them round
their necks Some of the soldiers and prisoners applied for
tracts, which they received gratefully along with a few
books&mdash;including a Testament. They are very destitute of
books, the only Bible I heard of at the station belonging to the
pilot." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* "While in Moreton Bay we were surprised by
hearing the blacks call biscuits 'five islands'; this, we
learned, arose from some men who, several years ago, were driven
from the part of the Illawarra coast, called the Five Islands,
having held up biscuit to the blacks, and sail 'five islands,' in
the hope of learning from them the direction of their lost home.
The blacks, however, mistook this for the name of the biscuits,
and hence have continued to call them by that
name."&mdash;<i>Narrative, page 377</i>. These men were, no
doubt, Pamphlet Finnegan, and Parsons, before referred to in
connection with the discovery of the Brisbane.]</p>
<p>Messrs. Backhouse and Walker left the shores of Moreton Bay on
April 17, 1836; after their departure, as far as I can find, the
settlement remained, with one exception, unvisited until the
opening of the district for immigration, save by prisoners and
officials and small vessels bringing the necessary supplies; and,
at a later period, a favoured few who obtained permission to
reside for purposes of trade.</p>
<p>From the time of Messrs. Backhouse and Walker's visit, the
district seems for a time to have slept the dead sleep of inane
criminality. No improvement was made in its material condition,
and no labour was entered upon tending towards it. At the time
the convict establishment was formally broken up, every record
that might have thrown light upon the procedure of the preceding
sixteen years, was carefully removed, and the miserable
dilapidation of the buildings left, was the sole testimony that
remained of the indolent apathy with which the resources of a
dying-out system were employed in the latter days of its
existence. I have seen one book of memoranda, by which it would
seem, from the kind and quantity of tailoring and cobbling
recorded, that the higher class of officials were not unmindful
of the value of an economically supplied wardrobe. In fact, from
all I can learn, the prisoners when not employed on such
cultivation as was indispensable, were generally engaged in the
most useless possible avocations. As to moral improvement, we may
judge of the effort made towards it by the good Quakers'
narrative. When even the formality of an official religious
instruction was omitted, books almost unknown, and all labour
reduced to a mere mechanical routine of the simplest and dullest
kind, it is not to be wondered at, that the criminal became
desperately wicked, the simple idiotic, and the active mad. They
who emerged from that slough fit for association with the
ordinary society of a civilised community, deserve far greater
credit than most of their one-time gaolers; for such an escape
must be rewarded as in direct opposition to the inevitable
influences of the system those gaolers were appointed to, and
did, encourage and enforce.</p>
<p>What, however, was denied to the criminal population, the
enthusiasm of some German missionaries, aided by a man whose name
is identified with the history of Australia&mdash;the late Rev.
Dr. Lang&mdash;attempted to supply to the aborigines.</p>
<blockquote>"Two regularly ordained ministers, both married, and
ten lay missionaries, most of whom were also married, and all of
whom had been for some time in training for the work of
missionaries to the heathen," *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Lang's Cooksland, p. 465.]</p>
<p>formed a party, who arrived in Moreton Bay in 1838. £450 was
obtained from the Imperial Government towards their expenses, and
by an arrangement made by Dr. Lang with a relative, another £150
became available under the then immigration laws of New South
Wales. A moderate quantity of land was set aside for the purposes
of the mission, about seven miles from the settlement, and there,
under circumstances of much hardship, and sometimes of absolute
privation, the German mission commenced its work.</p>
<p>During all this time the general tendency of circumstances was
towards the opening of the district as a free settlement. The
rapid increase in the flocks and herds of the New South Wales
squatters drove them to enlarge their borders, and the
discoveries of Cunningham were turned to with longing eyes. The
vigorous efforts made in England, as well as in the colonies, for
the abolition of transportation to New South Wales, were fast
reaching the wished for end, and it became evident that this
result being arrived at, the occupation of the Darling Downs, and
their connection with Moreton Bay, must necessarily compel the
cessation of the system there as much as at Port Jackson. To
those, and they are not a few, amongst us, who are apt to
depreciate the labours of science, I may commend the fact, that
to the exertions of a single explorer, is primarily due the
contemporaneous deliverance of this district with that of the
parent colony, from the evils of the convict system. Had no
overland route been found by Cunningham between the Upper Hunter
River and Moreton Bay, the isolation of the Brisbane district
would have left it open to the importation of criminals, just as
Van Diemen's Land was left, and in all probability for as long a
period.</p>
<p>Captain Fyans left in the year 1837, and was succeeded by
Major Cotton, who, during his two years' stay, did, and left,
nothing worthy of record. After him a three months command was
held by Lieutenant Gravatt, and in 1839 the last commandant,
Lieutenant Gorman (of the 80th), commenced the task of gradually
clearing away the remnants of a convict condition. The vessel
which came for the remaining prisoners brought the officials to
whom were entrusted the task of regularly surveying the country
and laying out the future City of Brisbane. A good deal had been
done towards the exploration of the surrounding districts by the
late Mr. A. Petrie, who was sent in 1837 to take charge of the
Government buildings, and to whom this colony is indebted for
valuable information which, although not always well employed,
tended to the promotion of its ultimate settlement. And thus the
ground was gradually clearing for that opening of the district to
a population which the first abolition of transportation to New
South Wales in 1840 necessitated. No criminals were sent to
Moreton Bay for penal punishment after 1839, and on May 5, in
that year, every convict, save such as were thought indispensable
for the settlement, and to make up the surveyors' parties, was
withdrawn. I am therefore inclined to consider 1839 as the real
termination of the penal era in this district, and the period
between that year and the formal proclamation of Moreton Bay as a
free settlement in 1842, as one of preparation for the
requirements which the new state of things would involve. The
grub had passed into the chrysalis condition. What the full
development would result in remained to be seen.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">We</span> now arrive at a period of the
narrative whose interest, not, perhaps immediately apparent,
grows upon us as it proceeds. The process of free settlement
commenced under no small difficulties, arising partly from
previous conditions of existence, partly from remoteness of
position, and partly from misconception of the probable future of
the district&mdash;a misconception which sometimes by the arts of
speculators unduly anticipated a rapid growth and early
prosperity: but most persons understood Moreton Bay as destined
to remain, except as a profitable appanage to the parent colony,
a mere outpost of a not very refined civilisation. The actual
state of the place afforded little to contradict the more
depreciating supposition.</p>
<p>At the time when the convict rule was supposed to be nigh its
end, Brisbane existed almost only in name. There were no streets,
and nothing that could by any stretch of the imagination, be
tortured into a town. Fronting the river, adjoining what is now
called William Street, stood the modest wooden residence of the
Commandant.* In its rear was a long row of old rubble buildings
for the minor officials and servants immediately attached to him;
some of these rooms are still remaining behind an hotel in George
Street, close to Telegraph Lane. At some distance further up the
river, were the commissariat quarters, now the office of the
Colonial Secretary, and next to them the military barracks, at
present occupied by the Colonial Treasurer and a host of the
Civil Service. The hospital, transformed into a police barracks,
has recently been removed for our new Law Courts. The old
prisoners' barracks, which successively accommodated our
legislature, our law courts, and I know not what besides, were
as, until recently, we saw them&mdash;odd-looking and ugly. The
wind-mill usefully occupied the building now called the
Observatory, and on another and slighter eminence, stood the
female factory, until of late the Police Court and Lock-up, now
removed to make way for the Telegraph Office. Farther on the road
to Breakfast Creek&mdash;for Fortitude Valley then had no
name&mdash;was the house of the clerk of the works. Beyond these
and a few temporary huts, there was nothing to indicate a town;
and with the exception of the garden and cultivated ground
mentioned in "Backhouse's Journal," all was "bush."</p>
<p class="foot">[* This, with much of the wood work of the old
hospital was prepared in Sydney, and sent to Moreton Bay to be
fixed, although timber a ply suited for the purpose was growing
all around. The only advantage resulting from this&mdash;if it
could be so called&mdash;was an entomological one. A peculiarly
large venomous spider, a native of Ceylon, came in the timber,
part of which was teak and took up its quarters in the old
hospital, where the species long flourished, to the annoyance of
the inmates.]</p>
<p>Three surveyors, Messrs. Dixon, Stapylton, and Warner, were
sent to survey the country round the bay, prior to active
measures being taken for its settlement; but the course adopted
under the direction of the Sydney Government was marked by
vacillation and inutility. The first attempt made, in July, 1840,
was to survey the coast, in order to connect Moreton Bay with the
Richmond River, a work whose immediate value it is difficult to
perceive. Messrs. Dickson and Warner were to commence at the Bay,
while Mr. Stapylton was to go overland, and run the Richmond down
to an agreed point of junction. It is exceedingly doubtful
whether at the time, Stapylton could have penetrated the
frightful country into which this useless work would have led
him; he and his party were, however, unfortunately surprised by
the blacks near Mount Lindsay, and, with the exception of one
man, cruelly murdered. The survivor had been left apparently dead
on the coals used to destroy the rest, on the remains of which he
was found, but was recovered by care and attention, and, a few
years since, I believe, was still living. This misfortune
terminated the survey of the coast. The next proceeding was to
measure off a base line on Normanby Plains, a few miles west of
Ipswich, for a trigonometrical survey, which was persevered in
for some time; and then a similar work was commenced near
Brisbane. Meanwhile, Mr. Dixon was recalled, and a Mr. Wade sent
in his stead; the plans and records of the work done being
forwarded to New South Wales, and, so far as the district of
Moreton Bay was concerned, never more heard of. An expenditure of
time, skill, and money, so little calculated to advantage the
settlement, was thus fitly concluded.</p>
<p>During this time the prohibition of approach within fifty
miles of Brisbane remained in force, although occasional
permissions were obtained from the New South Wales Government for
its suspension. The absence of surveys for the town rendered it
impossible for any intending trader to secure a permanent site,
and those who came, had to take their chance, while, in fact,
considerable hesitancy was shown in permitting free settlers to
come at all. A small schooner called the John, commenced trading
between Sydney and Brisbane in 1840, but, when we know that it
was only of sixty tons burthen, we may imagine the limited extent
of the traffic.</p>
<p>While the course of change, slow but sure, was thus advancing
in the immediate district of Moreton Bay, the progress of
pastoral settlement on the Darling Downs was more rapid. The
Messrs. Leslie, two enterprising settlers of position and means,
formed the station of Canning Downs, in 1840. Shortly afterwards,
that of Rosenthal was settled upon for the Peel River Company,
and the sound of occupying footsteps fell continuously upon the
ear of the dismayed savage, until he had no longer a spot on all
those fertile plains which he could look upon as his own.</p>
<p>It was impossible that this rapid work of settlement should be
effected without dispute and conflict with the native tribes.
Robbery and murder by the blacks, and retaliatory indiscriminate
slaughter by the whites, followed in quick succession. Station
after station was formed, and every new occupancy drove the
aborigines backwards, or might, perhaps, more truly be said to
have hastened their extermination. In the mass of conflicting
statements, it is difficult to determine with whom actual
hostilities began; but it seems consistent with probability that
the natives of the Darling Downs had long before been warned by
the gossip of the tribes of the unfriendly nature of the white's
occupation; and looking upon it at the very commencement as an
aggression, acted, according to their light, in self-defence,
when they killed his flocks and assailed himself. When did
civilization and barbarism come into contact without such a
result? It is more easy to deplore the evils of the collision
than to see how they might have been prevented. That they were
incalculably increased by the unreasoning and wicked course
pursued by some of the settlers, it seems to me impossible to
doubt.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of the conduct of the settlers towards
the blacks, there can be no question as to their energy in making
the most of the opportunities presented for their own immediate
purposes. The facilities of passage through Cunningham's Gap were
examined, when it was found that the difficulties were far
greater than his memoir left reason to expect, although it is but
right to say that the oldest surveyor we have in this colony (Mr.
Warner) has expressed strong doubts to me whether the precise
line of Cunningham's real route has ever yet been found. But
however great the difficulty might be, yet, in the judgment of
the pioneers of settlement, it was thought better to encounter it
than the dangers and distance of an overland journey from Sydney.
In 1840, the first drays passed through Cunningham's Gap, and
early in 1841, Mr. Patrick Leslie, made the first family journey
from Brisbane to the Darling Downs. By this time the trade had so
far increased, as to justify the occasional despatch of a steamer
from Sydney by the then Hunter River Steam Navigation Company,
and Mr. Leslie and his family came in the <i>Shamrock</i>.</p>
<p>When Mr. Leslie and his party arrived at Brisbane, his first
care was accommodation for the night, which, when hotels as yet
were not, was a matter of some moment. The hospitality of the
Commandant, due probably as well to the respectability of his
visitors as to the claims of a stranger, provided for them in
various ways. My informant, with some of his companions, found
their quarters in the outbuildings of the modest Residence, the
blankets they carried with them forming couch and coverlet on the
boarded floors. The following day they swam their stock across
the Brisbane, with the exception of one valuable horse which had
been purchased for stud purposes. There was no punt available for
his passage, and one had to be obtained from the station at
Woogaroo. Once fairly across the river, they went on to Limestone
(now Ipswich), and found quarters with one of the officials in
charge, at a place half barn half barracks, in which he was
permitted to entertain the few who came his way. In those
primitive days the master was almost invariably his own ostler,
happy if he was not as well his own cook and laundress; and the
young traveller seeing a tall good humoured looking man busy in
the primitive stables, asked him who he might be. The answer was
a little enigmatical, and a good deal jocose; and a sort of
general conversation followed, in which the past of the one, and
the expectations of the other, were freely communicated. A little
surprise was felt by the new comer when entering the place
appropriated for meals, he saw his recently gained friend take
the head of the table, and, in a strong Yorkshire accent, bid the
travellers make themselves at home. The embarrassment did not,
however, affect his appetite or his rest. The next day the
travellers continued their route across Normanby Plains towards
the almost unknown interior, when they began their upward toil.
The progress was naturally slow, and camping out at
night&mdash;no unpleasant experience in a climate like that of
Queensland when the weather is favourable&mdash;was the rule. On
one occasion the horse of which I have spoken, was left in charge
of the youth to whom he was accustomed, while the remainder of
the party went their different ways to provide the necessary
contingencies to the night's rest. Wearied by his day's toil, and
lulled by the dreamy solitude by which he was surrounded, he fell
asleep. The pawing and snorting of the beast awoke him to an
unaccustomed sight&mdash;that of three tall sinewy savages; their
heads wreathed with feathers, and their bodies striped with the
yellow earth in which they delighted&mdash;all armed with spears
and other weapons, strange enough in the eyes of him whom they
had surprised. He was unsuspicious of danger, and a parley, such
as could be maintained, began. They made him understand they
wanted "bread," "bacca," and "five allan." *. The two former he
had not with him, the last demand he did not understand. He was
beginning to get a little embarrassed, when, to his great relief,
Mr. Walter Leslie returned; and, at sight of an armed man, the
blacks fled. The full extent of the youth's danger was then
explained to him, and the whole party put upon their guard. As
night came on, one of their number, without experience in bush
travel, and seeing lights flickering in the thick scrub, became
greatly alarmed, fancying them the signals of an army of natives.
One of more travel, after enjoying the joke, dispelled his fears
by quietly informing him that what he saw was nothing more
dreadful than the flashing of the fire-flies. Still they were
sufficiently prudent to keep strict watch till daylight came.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Five allan," see note, Chapter ii., p.
26.]</p>
<p>With the light came hunger, and darkness and fear departing
together, one of the Messrs. Leslie took the youth with him in
search of game. They fell in with a bustard&mdash;similar, I
suppose, to that which delighted the hearts of Cook and his
companions seventy-one years before&mdash;which, having to carry
for four miles, naturally still occurs to the bearer as one of
the largest, if not the largest, he has ever met with. The flavor
was equal in its way to its size; and cheered and strengthened by
the meal and a subsequent rest, they commenced the main ascent.
What Cunningham thought easy, they, if they really hit upon his
track, found difficult; and not without much hard work&mdash;for
the toil of twelve bullocks during fourteen hours, brought a
light dray only six miles further on the way&mdash;did they
overcome the last "pinch." From that to Canning Downs was easy
travelling, and eight days after leaving Brisbane, they found
themselves settled to their respective avocations.</p>
<p>While the pastoral settlement of the western interior was thus
progressing, and the Government of New South Wales becoming more
alive to the value of the district, the progress of discovery was
not unimportant in other directions. The discoveries and surveys
of Flinders and King had left many portions of our northern coast
yet unknown. Those able navigators, not less than their
cotemporaries and many of their followers, were firm in believing
that the deep bays known to indent a large portion of the
north-western shores, received the waters of extensive rivers,
the discovery of which would not only open a route to the
interior, but afford facilities for colonizing a part of
Australia so near to India, as to render its occupation a matter
of evident importance. The English Government determined
therefore to despatch another expedition to survey and explore
those parts of our shores which were wholly or in part unknown to
Flinders and King. For this purpose, early in July, 1837, they
despatched the <i>Beagle</i>, sloop of war, under the command of
Captain Wickham. Lieutenant Stokes, whose history I have before
me, accompanying him in the first instance as first lieutenant
and assistant surveyor. The little importance attached to Moreton
Bay at that time, is evidenced by the circumstance, that I do not
find any allusion to it as a settlement throughout the narrative,
although the <i>Beagle's</i> first visit to our shores was in
June, 1838, in which month she was off Breaksea Spit. There is,
indeed, little of Stokes' narrative of special value in this
history, until it brings us to his discoveries in the Gulf of
Carpentaria, where the <i>Beagle</i> arrived in June, 1841; the
now rapid spread of settlement and flow of enterprise invest them
with such interest as to justify somewhat extended quotation.</p>
<p>After some casual surveying, the voyagers determined to
ascertain if the supply of water found by Flinders on Sweer's
Island continued available, and with that view they sailed for
the island, where they arrived on July 8, in the same year.</p>
<blockquote>"The <i>Investigator's</i> old well was discovered
half-a-mile eastward of the point, on the SE. extreme of the
island, to which I gave the name of Point Inscription, from a
very interesting discovery we made of the name of Flinders' ship
cut in a tree near the well, and still perfectly legible,
although nearly forty years old. . . . On the opposite side of
the trunk the <i>Beagle's</i> name and the date of our visit was
cut. . . . I forthwith resolved that the first river we
discovered in the Gulf should be named the Flinders, as the
tribute to his memory which it was best becoming in his humble
follower to bestow, and that which would most successfully serve
the purpose of recording his services on this side of the
continent." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Stokes' Discoveries in Australia, vol. ii., p.
271.]</p>
<p>I hope rather than expect, that those who may have followed
Lieutenant Stokes, have displayed equal good feeling, and spared
the old tree which records the visits of the <i>Beagle</i> and
<i>Investigator</i>.</p>
<p>Stokes dug another well at what he thought a more convenient
spot, and, at the extreme of Point Inscription, found excellent
water at a depth of twenty-five feet,** "pouring through a rock
of concreted sand, pebbles, and shells." His observations at this
portion of his narrative are well worthy of extract.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ibid., pp. 271 and 274.]</p>
<blockquote>"This was a very important discovery, as Investigator
Road is the only anchorage for vessels of all sizes at the head
of the Gulf in either monsoon, and possesses an equal supply of
wood, fish, and birds. . . . And lastly, I should observe, that
in case of our being fortunate enough to find rivers or fertile
country on the southern shores of the Gulf, we at once saw we
might look forward to the time when Investigator Road (the road
fully deserves the name of a good port, being four miles in
length by one in breadth, with a depth of from four to six
fathoms; and sheltered at all points, except from south to SSE.,
in which direction the shoalness of the shore prevents any sea
from getting up), should be the port from which all the produce
of the neighbouring parts of the continent must be shipped."
*</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Stokes' Discoveries in Australia, vol. ii.,
pp. 271 and 274.]</p>
<p>A careful and accurate survey was therefore made, and the
results were in every respect satisfactory.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 28, the explorers discovered the mouth
of the first river they found in the Gulf, and which they named
the Flinders; and on August 1, they entered another river, which
we know as the Albert. I regret that the demands on my space
prevent my extraction of the whole of the very vivid account
which Stokes gives of the two discoveries, but I cannot deny
myself the pleasure of laying before my readers a few especially
eloquent and suggestive passages. The opening of the Albert had
seemed so favorable, that Stokes made up a party and left the
<i>Beagle</i> with the gig and the whale boat on the evening of
the day he returned from Flinders.</p>
<blockquote>"The prospects that lay before us raised our spirits
to the highest, and the weather clear, cool, and bracing, could
not be more favourable, the temperature being 60°. The ripples
rolled rapidly, expanding from the boat's bows over the smooth
glassy surface of the water, whilst the men stretched out as if
unconscious of the exertion of pulling, every one of them feeling
his share of the excitement. From the western sky the last
lingering rays of the sun shot athwart the way, turning it, as it
were, by the alchemy of light into a flood of gold. Over head the
cope of heaven was gradually growing soberer in hue from the
withdrawal of these influences, which lately had warmed and
brightened it; but in the west a brilliant halo encircled the
decling [sic] ruler of the day. The sunset as brief as beautiful,
night rapidly came on, and presently the masts of the ship could
no longer be seen, and we were pursuing our way in darkness
towards the mouth of the opening. After vainly endeavouring to
get on the bank extending off the mouth, in the dark, we anchored
the boats outside. The awnings were spread, and the kettle for
our evening's meal was soon hissing over a blazing fire. Of all
things tea is the most refreshing after a day's fatigue; there is
nothing that so soon renovates the strength and cheers the
spirits, and on this occasion, especially, we experienced a due
portion of its invigorating effects. The grog was afterwards
served out, pipes and cigars were lighted, the jest was uttered,
and the tale went round; some fished, though with little success,
and the officers busied themselves with preparations for the
morrow's work. But all things must end.; the stories at length
flagged; the fishermen grew tired, and getting into our
blanket-bags, with a hearty good night we resigned ourselves with
the exception of the look-out, to the arms of slumber The general
direction we pursued was still south, for six miles by the
windings of the stream, which was so reduced in breadth and
volume, as to be scarcely a hundred yards wide, and not a fathom
deep. There was now little hope that it would lead into fresh
water, although, from the number of trials that were made, I am
sure there was salt water enough drank, to have physicked a whole
village. . . Nothing now remained but to retrace our steps and
try the other branch. . . . At the end of three miles in a W. by
S. direction, nearly doubled by the windings, we passed an island
on the left, the depth at low water so far being nearly two
fathoms, and the width about 250 yards, promised well.
Water-tasting had now become nearly out of fashion; however, it
so happened, that one of the whaler's crew put his hand over and
gave us the delightful news that the stream was quite fresh! A
general tasting followed, each being anxious to get the first
draught of the water of our new found river; and the agreeable
intelligence was confirmed. Of the importance of our discovery,
there could now no longer be any doubt, and the exhilarating
effect it produced on all was quite magical, every arm stretching
out as if the fatigue they had experienced had suddenly passed
away. . . . . The country was gradually becoming perceptibly
higher, and the scenery extremely picturesque. Tall palm trees
and bamboos were now to be seen among the rich foliage on the
lower slope of the banks that rose here to an elevation of fifty
feet, and were much intersected with water courses. Onwards we
hurried, the influence of the tide being scarcely felt, and the
river preserving its SW½S. direction, with a width of two hundred
yards, and a depth of two fathoms and a-half. At the end of three
miles no change was perceptible, and we began to congratulate
ourselves on at last having found a stream that would carry the
boats far towards the point it was always my ambition to
reach&mdash;the centre of the continent. . . . It was in truth as
glorious a prospect as could greet the eye. A magnificent sheet
of water lay before us, one unbroken expanse, resembling a smooth
translucent lake. Its gentle repose harmonised exquisitely with
the slender motionless boughs of the drooping gums, palms, and
acacias, that clustered on the banks, and dipped their feathery
foliage in the limpid stream, that, like a polished mirror, bore
within its bosom the image of the graceful vegetation by which it
was bordered. The report of our guns as they dealt destruction
among the quails that here abounded, rolled for the first time
along the waters of the Albert, breaking in on the hush of
stillness that appeared to reign over all like the presence of a
spirit. The country that stretched away from either bank was an
extensive plain, covered with long coarse grass, above which was
occasionally seen the head of a kangaroo listening with his acute
ear for our approach. . . . In our eagerness to proceed, we moved
off rapidly up the river, after a hasty meal. All beyond was
mystery, and it seemed that we were destined to remain in
suspense: for the day soon closed in, leaving only the pale light
of the moon to guide us. The depth continued regular at two and
a-half fathoms, and the width two hundred yards. We hastened on,
the night scenery being almost more beautiful than the day; the
heavens seemed more deep, the water more glittering, the trees
more graceful and feathery, and here and there a tall palm raised
its thin and spectral form above the dense foliage through which
the moonlight broke at intervals, and fell, as it were, in
showers of silver on the placid waters." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Stokes' Discoveries, vol. ii., p. 303.]</p>
<p>Seven miles of progress further, and they were obstructed by
fallen timber, they then returned and took another branch, where
they were again stopped by the same hindrance. Here they landed,
it being now clear that all hope of water carriage to the
interior was at an end.</p>
<blockquote>"The boats were at this time above fifty miles from
the entrance, and our provisions only admitting of the remainder
of the day being spent in land exploration, a party was
immediately selected for the purpose. Following up a short woody
valley, and reaching the summit of the level, a view burst upon
me. . . A vast boundless plain lay before us, here and there
dotted with woodland isles. . The river could be traced to the
southward by a waving line of green trees; the latter were larger
at this spot than in any other part, and consisted of tall palms,
and three kinds of gums. No trace of the western branch could be
discovered. . . The line of verdure still pointed out the
southerly course of the river across the endless plains, and it
became natural to speculate on its source or origin; whether it
was the drainage of a swamp, or the outlet of some lagoon fed by
the Cordillera to the eastward. But to speculation alone was I
reduced, it not being permitted to me to clear the point: all I
could do, was to give one lingering look to the southward before
I returned. In that direction, however, no curling smoke denoted
the presence of the savage; all was lonely and still; and yet
even in these deserted plains, equally wanting in the redundance
of animal as in the luxuriance of vegetable life, I could
discover the rudiments of future prosperity, and ample
justification of the name which I had bestowed upon them.** I
gazed around despite my personal disappointment, with feelings of
hopeful gratitude to Him who had spared not so fair a dwelling
place for his creatures, and could not help breathing a prayer,
that ere long the now level horizon would be broken by a
succession of tapering spires rising from the many Christian
hamlets that must ultimately stud this country, and pointing
through the calm depths of the intensely blue and gloriously
bright skies of Imperial Australia, to a still calmer and
brighter and more glorious region beyond, to which all our
sublimest aspirations tend, and where all our holiest desires may
be satisfied." ***</blockquote>

enough name. But, as showing how strongly difference of season

<p class="foot">[*** Stokes' Discoveries, vol. ii., p. 316.]</p>
<p>Stokes ascertained his position to be in latitude 17° 58½' S.,
longitude 7° 12½' E. of Port Essington, or 129° 25' E. of
Greenwich; and an admirable "point of departure" for exploratory
expeditions to the interior. Thus terminated his exploration of
the southern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, nearly two
hundred miles of which had been minutely examined in the boats.
Twenty-six inlets had been discovered, of which two proved to be
rivers, whilst three more were nearly as promising.</p>
<p>After leaving the Gulf of Carpentaria, the <i>Beagle</i>
proceeded on her way, and after touching at various points,
arrived at Spithead on September 30, 1843, after an absence of
more than six years. The additions made by this voyage to the
geographical knowledge of our coasts, were of considerable
importance, and the clear and sometimes eloquent language in
which the discoveries made are described, places Stokes'
narrative beyond the ordinary level of the "travels" of those
days. More extraordinary is the continuously generous feeling
which I find in all these narratives, from Flinders' downwards.
The respect paid by Flinders to Cook, was reflected again upon
him by King, and Stokes never fails to render the fitting tribute
to the labours of his illustrious predecessors. Not what each
might claim for himself, but what he might best learn was the
rightful possession of those who went before him, seems to have
been the principle observed by all. They were all men who wrought
for the work's sake, and while not unconscious of the value of
personal reputation, thought less of it than of the honest
performance of duty by which it was necessarily followed. I do
not doubt that the perceptible existence of this spirit amongst
them has gone far to impart that authority to their
investigations and narratives which they have long and deservedly
possessed.</p>
<p>The discoveries of Stokes on the north-western coast were
unknown to the little community struggling into existence on the
shores of Moreton Bay; but the exertions of Cunningham were now
to bear due fruit. The growth of the settlements on the Darling
Downs, and the gradual extension to the seaward, together with
the favourable reports from the officials of the locality,
stimulated the New South Wales Government to a tardy recognition
of its value. In May, 1842, the whole district was proclaimed
open for free settlement. The proclamation was preceded by a
visit from the then Governor, Sir George Gipps, who came to look
at the new district himself, and to determine, from personal
inspection, upon the plans preparing for the two towns of
Brisbane and Ipswich&mdash;to which latter name that of Limestone
was to be changed.</p>
<p>When the plans of the town of Brisbane were submitted to Sir
George Gipps, he evidently looked at them as for simply an
ordinary provincial settlement. That it should at any time become
the capital of the district or its permanent port, seems never to
have distinctly presented itself to his mind&mdash;or, indeed, at
that time, to the mind of any one. Four or five years afterwards,
Dr. Lang, in his "Cooksland," discussed the claims to that
distinction of Cleveland, between the outlets of the Brisbane and
the Logan, and Toorbal, in that passage between the main land and
Bribie Island, which Flinders had called the Pumice Stone
River&mdash;giving the preference to the latter. Even in 1860 the
idea of making Cleveland the commercial port of the district had
not been abandoned. I am, therefore, prepared to believe, that at
the time of Sir George Gipps' visit, when, as yet, no town was,
the attention of the few officials was directed more to the
extraction of revenue from the site they had than to the
investigation of its value as a port or capital. In fact, the
natural thought of any one who merely casually considered the
subject then would have been, that for a port, the settlement was
too far up a river, supposed to be encumbered by shoals and bars
like the Brisbane; and that where almost everything was in the
future, the final selection of the harbor necessarily belonged to
the future also.</p>
<p>The level ground available for the town was very small, and
hence a difference arose as to the width of the streets, and the
size of the allotments. Assuming that the population would always
be inconsiderable, Governor Gipps wished for the ordinary
arrangement of an Australian village&mdash;roads sixty-six feet
wide, and allotments of a quarter of an acre each; but,
ultimately, after some opposition from the local surveyors, the
width of the principal street was increased to about eighty feet,
and the general town allotments were diminished in size to admit
of the change. A public quay was left on the north side, which,
commencing where the natural facilities admitted, near to the end
of Queen Street, was to be continued as time required&mdash;the
necessary reserve being made&mdash;to Breakfast Creek. The open
space in the centre of the town, on which the female factory
stood, was left as a sort of place or square, which, either for
health or effect, would have been of great value to its
appearance. The cupidity of some prominent residents subsequently
teased the New South Wales Government into the idea of abandoning
the idea of the quay, and selling its site. In revenge for an
electoral defeat, the first Queensland Ministry deprived the town
of its central square, and divided most of the space into small
and crowded allotments, to the permanent damage and discomfort of
the whole city. The principal initiators of these several
injuries still enjoy the reputation due to wisdom and
disinterestedness, while very generally Sir George Gipps bears
the blame of proceedings directly in the teeth of his own wishes
and decisions.</p>
<p>The facility of water carriage from Limestone, as compared
with the then difficulties of land transit, joined to the
existence of a convict settlement there, led Sir George Gipps to
examine the suitability of its position for an inland town. Other
sites were suggested&mdash;one where the Bremer swells into a
large kind of basin close to the present town, another at the
debouchure of that river in the Brisbane. The last suggestion was
considered inadvisable, for reasons which may have seemed good
enough at the time; but, in the "Minute of Instructions" left by
the Governor, the site now occupied by the town of Ipswich was
evidently considered as an alternative one only.</p>
<blockquote>"An accurate survey should first he made of all the
country on the right bank of the Bremer, for about a mile above,
and two or three miles below Mr. Thorn's house, and for about
three miles along the high road in each direction&mdash;that is
to say, towards Brisbane on the one side, and towards Darling
Downs on the other. . . . The broken nature of the ground is the
only difficulty which opposes itself to the selection of the site
for the town. The plateau on which the shearing sheds stand,
seems to be the best, and this must be adopted, unless Mr. Wade
should find one lower down the river, <i>to which</i> a decided
preference should be given." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* I am indebted to Mr. Warner for the use of his
official copy of this minute, as well as for much general
information.]</p>
<p>Special directions are given in the same minute, that the main
road leading to Brisbane and to the Darling Downs, should be
properly laid out, and the errors in their then direction
rectified. Unfortunately these instructions met with the usual
fate of even gubernatorial wishes when the central authority is
remote. The district surveyor did not look for a site lower down
the river, and did not lay out the roads; but local personal
interests and influences were allowed by him to supersede the
essential considerations suggested by the Governor's minute, and
the present inferior site for the town was retained. It has been
the fashion to lay all the blame of all the deficiences in the
plans of both Brisbane and Ipswich upon the shoulders of Governor
Gipps, but the most authentic information I could obtain leads me
to very different conclusions. A careful inquiry into the facts
would rather tend to the belief, that the stereotyped routine of
the New South Wales Survey Office in such matters, and the
influences, to which its subordinates were subject, were too
powerful even for a Governor; a belief, strengthened by the fact,
that in nineteen out of twenty, of the towns laid out since
Gipps' time&mdash;and even since Separation&mdash;the very
courses whose adoption led to the defects alleged to exist in
Brisbane and Ipswich, have been continued, and their evils
multiplied and perpetuated.</p>
<p>One procedure of Sir George Gipps at this time was certainly
opposed to every dictate of sound policy, and even of common
gratitude. I have before mentioned the establishment of the
German mission to the aborigines within a few miles of Brisbane.
It seems never to have been popular with the class who most
easily found access to the higher official circles, or with the
bulk of the debased population of Moreton Bay; and hostile
suggestions were not wanting. And, moreover, the Governor looked
upon the very moderate quantity of land allotted for its use with
the eye rather of a rapacious landlord than of a philanthropist
or statesman. It came within the boundary of what he thought
might, at some time, be deemed suburban lands. So, without giving
direct orders for the removal of the mission, he suggested to its
head a journey to the interior, ostensibly for the discovery of a
more useful, but really of a less permanent, and apparently less
valuable location. It might have occurred to him, that even were
the missionaries unsuccessful in their efforts to Christianise
the aborigines, their services could have been well retained for
the imported population; and that something was due to the
self-denial which marked the attempt, even though the results had
fallen below anticipation. I am the more surprised at this
conduct, because a belief in the possibility of colonizing the
aborigines now caused an effort towards that end in a very
opposite quarter to that whence the first proceeded. Dr. Polding,
the late Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, endeavoured, in
1842, to establish a mission for the purpose at Dunwich, once a
convict station, on Stradbroke Island. I do not, however, find
that any beneficial results followed from it, and it was
subsequently abandoned. And, to close the subject here, I may as
well mention that the small external support which had been at
first given by the New South Wales Government, having been about
this time withdrawn from the Moravians, one of the clerical heads
left the station sometime in 1843, and his colleague followed him
a year afterwards. The lay missionaries, however, retained their
position, and, being assisted by three new ones sent in 1844,
made such effort as was practicable, either in their original
enterprise or in visiting their white neighbours. In time a
prosperous little settlement arose, known as the German Station,
and some of our most useful colonists have descended from those
pioneers of civilization. In the failure of both Roman Catholics
and Moravians to carry out their original purpose, there is
nothing to be surprised at. The enormous chasm between the
complexity of faculty and the amount of knowledge of a savage of
so low a type as the Australian aborigine, and those of his
would-be civilizers, which has to be bridged before either can
arrive at even a remote idea of the other's meaning in such
matters as faith and worship, presents difficulties which, the
more they are apprehended, the more insurmountable they
become.</p>
<p>Shortly after Sir George Gipps' return to New South Wales, the
map of Brisbane was sent to the Central Survey Office, and the
sale of the first sections advertised at Sydney for December 7,
1842. The plans exhibited have been described to me by a
looker-on as scarcely surpassed by those gorgeous and imaginative
documents, which, in the wild days of the Victorian diggings,
flaunted in the windows and doorways of speculative and alluring
Melbourne auctioneers. There was a good deal of curiosity about
the district, and, as is usual in the Australian
colonies&mdash;and to an outside observer unaccountably
so&mdash;when land in a new settlement, which not a single buyer
has ever seen or known anything of, save in a meagre official
account or a Government map, is offered for sale, there was a
vigorous competition. Some years since I was much amused with a
lively description by one of the ablest public men in Australia,*
who was residing in Sydney at the time of the sale, of the
imaginative values affixed by grave lawyers and money-wise
merchants to the new town allotments of Moreton Bay; and of the
zeal with which they bid against each other for land whose title
deeds they, in time, and with equal judgment, treated almost as
waste paper. One allotment has been pointed out to me, for which
more money was paid in 1842 than it would have realized ten years
ago. Some of us have witnessed more extravagant instances in our
own time, for we have known a town allotment in one of our
extreme northern possessions purchased at a Government land sale
for nearly £100, and, three years afterwards, sold for £2. Nor in
this case had either of the purchasers seen, or had even a chance
of seeing, what he had bought, although it may be presumed that
the last price was probably far higher the real value of the
allotment than the first. Such was the influence on speculative
investment of the puffery of Government despatches, in giving
fictitious importance, nearly twenty years ago, to a solitary
island, which may become a settlement some time during the next
generation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir Archibald Mitchie.]</p>
<p>While Sir George Gipps was thus unconsciously laying the
foundations of a capital, the wisdom of the English
Parliament&mdash;or rather that portion of it which took any
interest in colonial affairs&mdash;was engaged on an experiment
in government for the colony of which Moreton Bay then formed a
very unimportant portion. For some years before, there had been
more or less of agitation in New South Wales in favour of
representative institutions, and the subject having been
repeatedly brought before the home Government, Lord John Russell,
in 1841, prepared a draft of an Act for its settlement. A change
of ministry took place, and it then fell to the lot of Lord
Stanley (the late Earl of Derby) in the session of 1842, to lay a
bill for the purpose before the Parliament. There were some
differences between that bill and the measure of Lord John
Russell, which Lord Stanley stated he had been induced to make by
the representations of Sir George Gipps and some other
influential persons connected with the colony. The main
provisions of the Act, as finally passed, prove the hesitancy
with which the privileges it did confer, were granted, as it
while embodying a principle, its application was falteringly and
feebly made. By this instrument of government, a Legislative
Council was created, consisting of fifty-four members, thirty-six
of whom were elective, and eighteen nominees of the Crown. Five
of the eighteen were the Colonial Treasurer, the Auditor-General,
the Attorney-General, the Collector of Customs, and the Commander
of the Forces. The elective qualification was fixed at the
possession of a freehold of the value of £200, or occupancy at a
rate of not less than £20 per annum, while the representative one
was constituted by the ownership of freeholds worth at least
£2,000, or an income of £100 per annum derivable from property.
The duration of the Council was to be five years; all money bills
were to originate with the Governor, and a civil list of £81,000
per annum, as well as the regulation of the Crown lands, was
reserved from Legislative control. One remarkable provision was,
that in the event of a new colony being formed to the northward
of Sydney, no territory lower than 26° S. should be detached from
New South Wales. The Act arrived in Sydney on January 1, 1843,
and no time was lost in bringing it into active operation.</p>
<p>There was a large party who viewed the measure with little
favour. The power of the purse remained with the Governor and his
advisers, and responsibility in any shape seemed a mere
assumption. The reservation of the Crown lands from the control
of the Council met with special disapprobation; and the Act,
which was intended as a peace offering by the Imperial
authorities, became rather a text for the harangued of a very
clever and not very scrupulous opposition. But, looking at the
peculiar social condition of New South Wales at that time, it
seems quite possible that, had Lord Stanley's Act been more
liberal, it might have been productive of a very great deal of
mischief. It was an experiment, and as an experiment, was
necessarily limited and tentative. In the elections which
followed its promulgation, Moreton Bay, joined to the electoral
districts of the Macquarie and the Upper Hunter, had a very
insignificant influence on he return of the successful
candidate&mdash;Mr. Alexander Macleay&mdash;many years speaker of
the old nominee Council, which, nominally as legislators, but
really as a consultative body, assisted the Governors of New
South Wales in their gubernatorial functions.</p>
<p>The people of Moreton Bay left the dissensions and
controversies of Sydney, on these points, to take care of
themselves. What was of far more immediate interest to them, was
the quick following of the initiatory land sales at Sydney by
others at Brisbane, the first being held there on August 9, 1843,
and the second, for the sale of allotments at Ipswich, on October
11, in the same year. These sales were on the auction system, and
conducted on the same plan as the primary sales under our present
Crown Lands Alienation Acts. The districts were divided into
town, suburban, and country allotments, the minimum price of the
two former varying at the discretion of the Government, and of
the latter being £1 per acre, to which, to the great discontent
of the colonists, it had only recently been raised by the home
authorities from twelve shillings. But prior to this, the
attention excited by the proclamation of the district as free,
and the Governor's visit, had led to a great increase in the
progress of squatting settlement, and both sides of the Brisbane
and its tributaries were rapidly occupied; the usual skirmishes
between the pioneers and the natives accompanying the occupancy
of every fresh station.</p>
<p>Government here, during this time, was gradually drifting into
the ordinary quietude of a district administration. In March,
1842, the last of the penal Commandants&mdash;Lieutenant
Gorman&mdash;had resigned his authority into the hands of the
late Dr. Simpson, who had been previously sent as Crown Land
Commissioner for the district, and in November of that year,
Captain J. C. Wickham was appointed Police Magistrate. They had
very little difficulty in the performance of their respective
duties, for the population was small&mdash;properly impressed
with the propriety of submission to those in authority over them,
and disposed to take things easily. Their chief disquietude arose
from the continuous conflicts between the squatters and the
blacks, which, before the close of the year 1843, began to assume
rather formidable proportions. In the districts bordering on the
Wide Bay, in the neighbourhood of the Brisbane, and all along the
passages over the Dividing Range, the attacks on the settlers
were determined and vigorous. A carrier named Phipps discovered a
practicable pass from the northern portion of the Darling Downs
by way of the township of Drayton, then and long afterwards known
as "The Springs." As this route reached the foot of the
mountains, after it crossed the Upper Lockyer, it ran along a
gorge, gradually narrowing, nowhere of great width, intersected
by wide and very deep gullies imperceptible at a small distance,
and bounded on both sides by an impenetrable scrub. A station was
formed near it, called Helidon. In this small flat, a party
escorting a number of drays with stores, were suddenly attacked
by a considerable number of blacks, with such ferocious vigour,
that the escort lost heart and fled, and the drays and their
contents became the spoil of the savages. In revenge of this, a
large party of squatters and their dependents made a general raid
upon the blacks, a number of whom were driven into the singular
isolated table mountain, named by Cunningham, Hay's Peak. Towards
the summit this consists mainly of large basaltic boulders, and I
was told by a friend, who was present at the fray, that when the
natives were forced back to its ascent, they rolled the boulders
down the precipitous slopes with great effect, and to the
discomforture of their assailants. No small number of the savages
were, however, shot at the time. Their hostility was not
decreased, nor their readiness to show it, at length a small
party of soldiers was permanently quartered at the entrance of
the gorge I have described&mdash;thence named Soldiers' Flat.
This step I presume to have been effectual, as I do not read of
any general or preconcerted attack afterwards upon the soldiers,
or upon parties travelling in that direction. In the year 1861 I
was camped close to the spot, and the half-ruined hut and remains
of the soldiers' little garden&mdash;then occasionally occupied
by a care-taker from the neighbouring station&mdash;looked sad
and solitary beneath the shadows of the mountains and the gloom
of the surrounding forest. Now a township has been settled at a
short distance from it, and the whistle of the locomotive and the
rush of the railway trains mingle with the more pleasing notes of
the ancient inhabitants of the woods.</p>
<p>But, prior to this ceaseless and indiscriminate hostility, one
of those almost incredible crimes which disgrace our efforts at
colonization, is said to have occurred at Kilcoy&mdash;a station
on the north of the Brisbane&mdash;and to have had a marked
effect in stimulating the revengeful passions of the aborigines,
already sufficiently provoked by the outrages to which, in this
as well as in adjoining districts, they had been exposed almost
ever since penal settlements began. I allude to the poisoning of
a considerable number of blacks by the admixture of arsenic with
food given them for the purpose&mdash;a crime so atrocious in
every aspect as to appear almost incredible. I am afraid that, to
the disgrace of humanity, the accusation was in this, as in not a
few other cases, too true.</p>
<p>In the few historical or semi-historical works relative to the
colony that I have seen, the subject has been vigorously dealt
with. Dr. Lang, in his "Cooksland," and subsequently in his
"Queensland," accepts the murder as a fact, and discusses it with
his customary indiscriminate vehemence. Mr. Clement Hodgkinson,
at one time connected with the Survey Office of New South Wales,
in a small work of his on the Macleay River and the northern
settlements of New South Wales, treated the charge as one of
"ridiculous improbability." Mr. Pugh, in his slight but valuable
condensation, prefixed to his Almanac for 1859, does not refer to
it. But, as bearing on an important question connected with that
policy of precipitating settlement at all hazards which has
formed the subject of so much administrative panegyric here, the
whole matter is one of too great importance to be passed lightly
by.</p>
<p>Nearly contemporaneously with the date of the alleged
poisoning at Kilcoy in 1842, a similar instance, but on a larger
scale,* occurred in the Clarence River district. The
circumstances provoked such comment, that the presumed principal
delinquent was, as I am informed by a member of our Legislature
long resident here, with whom I have conversed on the subject,
apprehended and sent to Sydney, where, after some detention, he
was discharged from the want of available legal evidence against
him. Now, in 1839, and not with reference to that case, "<i>An
Act to allow the aboriginal natives of New South Wales to be
received as competent witnesses in criminal cases</i>," ** was
passed by the then Council during the government of Sir George
Gipps *** This Act was disallowed by the Home Government; but
surely no greater proof of the admitted prevalence of outrages
upon the aborigines can be furnished than the enactment of such a
statute. The provision of a remedy proves the existence of an
evil. Again, in the evidence of an old settler and magistrate of
the territory, when examined before a Select Committee of our
Legislative Assembly, on the Native Police Force in 1861, I find
a curious confirmation of the practice. In reply to the
question:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* More than seventy of all sexes and ages are
said to have been poisoned at once by the admixture of poison in
cakes given to the unsuspecting victims.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** New South Wales Statutes, 3 Vic., No.
16.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In 1850, again the Attorney-General of that
colony, in a debate upon a bill for legalizing aboriginal
evidence, treated the fact of the poisoning as indisputable.]</p>
<blockquote>"You have stated, that it is through fear that many
of the cruelties are perpetrated upon the blacks, which appears
to me rather inconsistent&mdash;will you explain your meaning
more clearly?"</blockquote>
<p>He answers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have known in former times on the Macintyre, where
two or three men might be living at a station together, who would
employ the blacks, and give them rations and tobacco&mdash;well
these men would be frightened out of their lives by the blacks,
and not being strong enough to go out and fight them, and being
always in a state of fear, they would pop a gun through the slabs
of the hut and fire upon them, and perhaps kill a blackfellow;
<i>at other times they would put poison in a damper and give it
to the blacks</i>. It was never the case when the stations were
strongly manned, and therefore, as I said before, fear of the
blacks was the chief cause of these murders." ****</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[**** Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative
Assembly of Queensland, 1861, p. 481.]</p>
<p>And many hundreds of miles from Moreton Bay, Mr. Robinson, the
protector of aborigines for the district of Port Phillip,
officially declared in 1845, that there was "reason to fear that
the aborigines have been poisoned, and the ends of justice
defeated for want of legal evidence." I might easily multiply
proof on this head by the testimony of settlers of long standing
and unexceptional character, but I prefer citation of notorious
facts, and from official documents, and to extend this further
would be a waste of time. What has been given at least disposes
of the "ridiculous improbability" of the charge.</p>
<p>We now come to the facts peculiar to the case itself. When the
Rev. Mr. Schmidt&mdash;at the time head of the German mission to
the aborigines&mdash;in compliance with the wishes of Sir George
Gipps, set out to visit the Bunya Bunya country to see how far
the removal of the mission was practicable, he was accompanied by
some natives of the tribe resident in the mission locality who
acted as guides. Upon reaching a portion of the country inhabited
by another tribe, he found his companions unwilling to proceed
further, and, upon enquiry, they alleged as a reason, that a
considerable number of the natives, through whose district they
were going, had been poisoned at a station settled amongst them,
and that, in revenge, the life of strangers, either white or
black, coming in that direction, would be unsafe. Ultimately, the
good offices of some of the aggrieved tribe were obtained, and
the journey was prosecuted in safety. But in the official report
of Mr. Schmidt to Dr. Lang&mdash;who was then secretary to the
mission&mdash;the fact was alluded to, although in such a very
quiet and off-hand manner, as to create an impression in the mind
of the reader, that the circumstances were not so uncommon as to
require detailed comment.</p>
<blockquote>"There was also another reason which influenced
greatly our natives against going any further&mdash;viz., a large
number of natives (about fifty or sixty) having been poisoned at
one of the squatter's stations. The neighbouring tribes are
going, we are told, to attack and kill the whites whenever they
meet with any."</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Lang moreover states&mdash;and he has not been
contradicted&mdash;that the same report had not only been brought
to the mission by lay brethren who had received it from another
and distinct tribe, but that Mr. Schmidt had himself heard it
talked of by the residents in Brisbane. In consequence of the
publication of Mr. Schmidt's report, and the comments it
occasioned, Mr. Schmidt was officially interrogated on the
subject, and reiterated his former statement. No further enquiry
was entered into&mdash;it may be from the Government finding no
legal evidence available; but an unexpected confirmation of Mr.
Schmidt's truthfulness was afterwards afforded from widely
different quarters. The late Mr. Andrew Petrie made, in 1842, an
expedition to Wide Bay, in the course of which he rescued two
runaway convicts, named Davis or Davies, and Bracefield, from the
aborigines, with whom they had associated for some years. Their
designations in the tribe were Darumboy and Wandie. Both these
men and their black companions dissuaded Mr. Petrie from any
attempt at interior exploration, urging that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"the blacks were determined to attack us, as they
would have revenge for the poisoning of their friends at some of
the stations to the south."</blockquote>
<p>The Wide Bay blacks at the same time told Wandie "that the
white-fellows had poisoned a number of their tribe." Mr. Petrie's
truthfulness has never been impugned, and inasmuch as his
narrative has stood thus for more than thirty-seven years, it is
impossible not to regard its concurrence with that of Mr. Schmidt
as of great weight in establishing the fact that the poisoning
did occur.</p>
<p>This concurrent testimony was unexpectedly, but most
emphatically, supported in 1861, by the evidence taken before the
Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly, to which I have
before referred. One of the witnesses examined, who had been on
the Kilcoy station at the time of the alleged poisoning, after
informing the committee that the blacks had been troublesome, two
of his hands having been killed during his stay, although neither
he nor the owner, Sir Evan Mackenzie, came personally into
collision with them, gave the following replies to the questions
quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"During your residence there, were any of the blacks
poisoned, or reported to be poisoned?&mdash;I heard something of
that, but not until after we left. I first heard of it from Mr.
Merewether. I travelled with him in the same steamer with Sir
George Gipps. Mr. Merewether began talking with me about the
blacks, and gave me all the particulars. I had not the slightest
idea before, that such a thing had occurred at all, <i>but it
must have happened whilst I was there</i>.
<p>"Do you remember hearing of anything of the sort while you
were at the station?&mdash;I remember the overseer saying to me
one day, Don't you think it would be a good thing to give those
fellows a dose?' Of course I expressed my abhorrence of the
suggestion, and no more was said about it. I never heard anything
further on the subject." *</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Votes and Proceedings of the Assembly, 1861,
p. 477. Evidence of John Ker Wilson, Esq.]</p>
<p>The enquiry of the overseer appears to me of great
significance. It pointed not to an experiment, but a
method&mdash;something already tried and found sufficient for the
purpose, and intended to be repeated as occasion might seem to
require. Taking the whole of the evidence in conjunction with the
narratives of Schmidt and Petrie, it would be difficult, in the
absence of stronger proof to the contrary, to doubt the truth of
the charge brought.</p>
<p>Mr. Hodgkinson, indeed, suggests, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"according to the account of the squatters, it would
appear that some sheep, diseased and scabby, had been dressed, as
usual, with arsenic, which, with corrosive sublimate, is the
ordinary remedy for scab. These sheep had been rushed by the
blacks, and a number of them carried off, and it is supposed that
the arsenic caused the death of some of the
thieves."</blockquote>
<p>Kilcoy station was not even formed at the time, and squatters
do not usually want to take up new country with diseased and
scabby sheep. The evidence from which I have quoted refers to no
such circumstance. And the savages were always keen enough to
distinguish between injuries caused by what they had stolen, and
those resulting from what had been given them. The form of death
was entirely new to them. Had they "rushed" the
sheep&mdash;stolen them with violence&mdash;in the teeth of the
shepherd's resistance&mdash;and some then died from eating them,
the survivors would hardly have confounded such a consequence
with death following from a gift, which was the essence of their
statement. The intercourse of the particular tribe with white men
was of very recent date&mdash;limited to a few occasions during a
month or two, and the very fact, that they did so discover the
mode of destruction may be taken to afford strong internal
evidence of the fact.</p>
<p>I am by no means inclined to concur in Dr. Lang's sweeping and
indiscriminate censure of the squatters as a class. I do not
suppose that Sir Evan Mackenzie was at the time personally
cognizant of the atrocity of his men, or that he would not always
have forbidden its practice. But what every right-minded man must
regret, is the determined opposition to any real enquiry by which
every charge of the kind was met&mdash;the palliations offered on
behalf of the accused, and the half-defiant and slighting manner
with which the accusations were put by. From this sort of
procedure the actual murderers derived encouragement. They
concluded, that while their employers prohibited the crime, they
had little anxiety to secure its detection, and less scruple in
profiting by its commission. Had the squatters of Moreton Bay in
1842 been wise in their generation, they would have insisted on
an investigation, which would have rendered impossible the
suspicions which were not infrequently and ungenerously directed
against them from hostile quarters. It might have been
troublesome; but the convenient is one thing, the prudent and
far-seeing another.</p>
<p>Long after this poisoning, rumours periodically arose of
similar occurrences in the district, but apparently without
tangible foundation. As time passed, and population increased, a
better and more powerful public opinion arose, and he would he,
indeed, a bold man who ventured now on&mdash;any such crime;
although, until within the last few years, the slaughter of a
native was too often looked upon, and is sometimes now&mdash;and
by men who have been taught and ought to have known
better&mdash;as of little more moment than that of his dog. The
mischievous result of that crime was long apparent. The tribes
did not lack means of rapid and correct communication. Their
dialects may differ, as the dialect of uneducated Yorkshire
differs from that of uneducated Kent, but there is always
sufficient homogeneity in the language of contiguous districts,
to enable their inhabitants to understand each other; * and from
all that I have learned I can arrive at no other conclusion than
that very many of the murders perpetrated by the blacks for years
afterwards were more or less in consequence, or in revenge, of
the wholesale poisoning at Kilcoy.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Thus, in 1841, Mr. Leslie's party, travelling

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">I gladly</span> turn from the enquiry in the
preceding chapter&mdash;one, however, which could not have been
omitted in any full and honest history of the colony&mdash;to
matters of less gloomy aspect. After Sir George Gipps returned to
Sydney, he soon found himself involved in disputes on a variety
of subjects with his new Council, while the asperity of
opposition was not softened by the monetary depression under
which the colony of New South Wales then laboured.* One result of
that time of trial, was the enactment of the "<i>Preferable Liens
Act, 7 Victoria, No. 3, of New South Wales</i>," since modified
in various ways, but still, in its main principle, the law in all
the colonies. Its object was to facilitate the giving security
upon stock and wool without actual delivery to the lender. As a
measure of relief, its beneficial effect was soon felt, and its
operation has been, on the whole, of great advantage to the
squatting community, and the monetary establishments immediately
connected with their interests. Another, and still more
beneficial consequence, was the introduction of the "boiling
down" process, by which unsaleable sheep and cattle were
converted into saleable tallow, and a staple article of export at
once created. In the advantages of both these improvements, the
settlers of Moreton Bay necessarily participated; the political
disputes concerned them little, and they cared for them in
proportion.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Lang's "New South Wales," vol. i.]</p>
<p>In the midst of political strife and monetary struggle, the
desire for geographical discovery increased in vigour. The nature
of the vast interior of this island-continent to the west and
north of New South Wales, remained a problem which geographers
were intent upon solving. Nor were there wanting men of
considerable weight in New South Wales, who fully concurred in
the opinions which had been repeatedly expressed in England,
relative to the important benefits to the colonies, as well as to
the empire, which a near connection between Australia and India
would confer. The attempted settlement at Port Essington
originated in such a conviction by the Imperial Government, which
indeed, has seldom been wanting in colonial support from those
who desired to improve their means or their position by a
convenient acquiescence. It is pleasing to trace the first
practical efforts towards penetrating Australia with the purpose
of testing the practicability of the connection I have referred
to, to a combination of parties in New South Wales, which, from
the usually antagonistic nature of its elements, may reasonably
be supposed to have been genuine. On October 3, 1843, and on the
motion of Dr. (now Sir Charles) Nicholson, the following votes
were carried in the Legislative Council:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That, whereas, the establishment of an overland
route between the settled parts of New South Wales and Port
Essington, will be attended with important additions to our
geographical knowledge of the interior of Australia, and is an
object the accomplishment of which is likely to be attended with
great advantages to the commercial and other interests of this
colony, by opening a direct line of communication with the
islands of tile Eastern Archipelago, with India and other parts
of Asia: Resolved, That a committee be appointed for the purpose
of enquiring into the practicability of such a design, and the
means whereby it may be carried into effect, and that they do
report to the Council the result of such inquiry with as little
delay as possible."<br>
<br>
"Question put and passed, and committee, consisting of the
following members, appointed:&mdash;Mr. Elwin, Dr. Lang, Mr.
Suttor, Mr. Wentworth, Mr. Macarthur, and Dr.
Nicholson."</blockquote>
<p>As is usual before all Parliamentary committees, a good deal
of evidence not directly bearing upon the question, although
probably of value in other respects, was taken, but ultimately
there seemed to be no reason to doubt the desirability of some
such expedition as that suggested, although opinions were divided
as to the exact route to be adopted. Sir Thomas Mitchell, the
then Surveyor-General, whose previous success in exploration in
the western and southern districts of the colony imparted
considerable weight to his opinion&mdash;was decisive in his
recommendation of Fort Bourke on the Darling River as a starting
point. The only alternative suggested&mdash;that of Moreton Bay
as a point of departure&mdash;the committee rejected, because of
the "formidable difficulties" likely to attend such a
commencement.</p>
<blockquote>"The Dividing Range," the committee observed, "would
have to be surmounted, occasioning to the cattle and horses at
starting a degree fatigue and exhaustion, which would probably
much impair their strength and usefulness in the subsequent part
of the journey"&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>an opinion which now can only occasion a smile. They
recommended the route by Fort Bourke, and an expenditure of
£1,000 by the Colonial Government in support of the undertaking.
Sir George Gipps, with a hesitancy scarcely consistent with
"Imperial interests," although concurring in the desirability of
the attempt, referred the recommendation for the approval of the
Secretary for the Colonies, alleging the "present circumstances"
of the colony as justifying his doubts.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang describes the general feeling at this unexpected
result as one of great disappointment, for which, however, a
solace was not long in presenting itself. Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt&mdash;a name mournfully associated with much of
disinterested enterprise, and of that kind of patient endurance
under suffering which calls for qualities far beyond ordinary
heroism&mdash;was then in Sydney awaiting the result of the
committee's recommendation. He was desirous of attaching himself
to the proposed expedition as a naturalist, and, finding himself
deprived of that opportunity, he conceived the idea of leading
one himself. He had previously spent some time in the district of
Moreton Bay, to which he had travelled overland, and had been
gratified and surprised by the novelties of its physical
characteristics. His personal means were small; but this was more
than compensated by an enthusiasm and a perseverance sometimes
scarcely compatible with prudence. He proposed to start from
Moreton Bay with a small party, and thence to push for the Gulf
of Carpentaria, intending then to follow the coast to Port
Essington. However great may have been the sorrows of the New
South Wales public that the £1,000 was not forthcoming for Sir
Thomas Mitchell's journey, they showed in the expression of a
very limited sympathy, the extent of their assistance to
Leichhardt. The help he received was paltry; and never having
been connected with official circles, or with an influential
clique of any kind, he seems to have been generally regarded as a
singularly bold intruder on a work equally beyond his province
and his powers.</p>
<p>Leichhardt had been educated as a physician, but, with a not
unusual divergence of pursuit, extended his studies to other and
kindred branches of physical science, somewhat to the neglect of
his original profession. He was a good naturalist awl botanist,
of temperate habits and well fitted to bear fatigue. A passion
for exploration was combined in him with an intense and jealous
avarice of fame to be derived from the accomplishment of supposed
impossibilities. To state a difficulty or to suggest an
obstruction was simply to stimulate him to effort. Writing to
Professor Owen (from whom he had received a letter of
introduction to Sir Thomas Mitchell), in 1844, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Living here, as the bird lives, who flies from tree
to tree, living on the kindness of a friend fond of my science,
or on the hospitality of the settler and the squatter, with a
little mare I travelled more than 2,500 miles zigzag from
Newcastle to Wide Bay, being often groom and cook, washerwoman,
geologist, and botanist at the same time; and I am delighted in
this life, but I feel too deeply that ampler means would enable
me to do more and do it better. When you next hear of me, it will
be either that I am lost and dead, or that I have succeeded to
penetrate through the interior to Port Essington."</blockquote>
<p>I know nothing that could give a more graphic idea of the
spirit that animated this, in many respects, extraordinary
man.</p>
<p>With a slender equipment, which he somewhat hurriedly
completed, Leichhardt left Sydney in August, 1844. He was
accompanied by two young Englishmen, named Calvert and Roper,
John Murphy (a lad sixteen years old), Phillips (a convict), and
an aboriginal called Harry Brown. A rather protracted voyage in
the old <i>Sovereign</i> steamer, impoverished his horses, and he
was glad to rest on his arrival in Brisbane, where he was
hospitably received by Sir Evan Mackenzie, the late Mr. Pemberton
Hodgson, and others, who felt an interest in his intended
journey. During the short delay thus occasioned, he sought
opportunities of profiting by the greater knowledge possessed by
his friends of the country through which the proposed
commencement of his travel would lead. His first idea seems to
have been to keep to the eastern slopes of the Dividing Range, as
near to the coast as was compatible with heading the rivers
taking their sources on that side. The result of many friendly
discussions was that, with some reluctance, he abandoned that
intention, and crossed the Range to Westbrook, and thus, while
keeping to its west, but in a nearly parallel line to the coast,
escaped a very difficult and dangerous country, which might have
then presented obstacles insurmountable even to him. Some
alterations, dictated by the experience of the settlers, were
made in his equipment while resting at Westbrook, and the number
of the party was increased by the addition of Mr. Pemberton
Hodgson, Mr. Gilbert (a naturalist, who had been with Gould, the
great ornithologist), a negro, and another aboriginal, named.
Charley. Bullocks were substituted for pack horses for carrying
the stores.</p>
<blockquote>"Neither my companions nor myself knew much about
bullocks, and it was a long time before we were reconciled to the
dangerous vicinity of their horns. By means, however, of iron
nose-rings, with ropes attached, we obtained a tolerable command
over their movements, and at last, by dint of habit, became
familiar with, and even got attached to, our blunt and often
refractory <i>compagni de voyage</i>. *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* "Leichhardt's Journal:" Introduction, p. 13.
London, 1847.]</p>
<blockquote>"By a present from Messrs. Campbell and Stephens of
four young steers and one old bullock, and of a fat bullock from
Mr. Isaacs, our stock of cattle consisted now of sixteen head. Of
horses we had seventeen, and our party consisted of ten
individuals. Of provisions we had 1,200 lbs. of flour, 200 lbs.
of sugar, 80 lbs. of tea, 20 lbs. of gelatine, and other articles
of less consideration, but adding much to our comfort during the
first few weeks of our journey. Of ammunition we had about 30
lbs. of powder and eight bags of shot of different sizes, chiefly
of No. 4 and No. I. Every one, at my desire, had provided himself
with two pairs of strung trousers, three strong shirts, and two
pairs of shoes, and I may further remark, that some of us were
provided with ponchos, made of light, strong calico, saturated
with oil, which proved very useful to us by keeping out the wet,
and made us independent of the weather, so that we were well
provided for seven months, which I was sanguine enough to think
would be sufficient time for our journey. The result proved that
our calculations as to the provisions were nearly correct; for
even our flour, much of which was destroyed by accident, lasted
to the end of May&mdash;the eighth month of our
journey&mdash;but, as to the time it occupied, we were very much
deceived."</blockquote>
<p>By the end of September, 1844, the preparations of the party
were completed, and on October 1, they left Jimbour, the then
farthest occupied station, and "launched; buoyant with hope, into
the wilderness of Australia." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Leichhardt's Journal:" Introduction, p.
6.]</p>
<p>Leichhardt himself divided his route into eight sections,
justifying the division by the varying character of the country
through which he travelled. The first was from the Darling Downs
to the Peak Range, including the Dawson and Mackenzie Rivers
(latitude 27° to 23°); the second, the plains of the Peak Range,
including the rivers Isaacs and Suttor (between 23° and 23° 50');
the third, the Lower Suttor, the Burdekin, and its table land
(21° to 18°); the fourth, the Lynd, the Mitchell, and the east
coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria (between 18° and 10°); the
fifth, the Plains of Promise, of Captain Stokes, at the head of
the Gulf, with the Flinders. Albert, and Nicholson Rivers (in
latitude 18°): the sixth, the west coast of the Gulf (between 18°
and 15°); the seventh, the River Roper and Arnheim's Land
(between 13° and 13° 50'); and the eighth, the Alligator River
and Coburg Peninsula (13° 40' to 11° 21'). Adopting his own
division, we shall be able to connect the narrative of his
travels with the more condensed and systematic description given
in the lectures which, after his return, he delivered at the
School of Arts in Sydney, in August and September, 1846.</p>
<p>Starting from Jimbour on October 1, Leichhardt reached the
Condamine River in six days, and, after following it a short
time, left it trending to the west. On the 11th, in forcing their
way through a scrub, the bullocks upset their loads, and tearing
the bags, lost about 143 lbs. of flour, Still keeping in a
north-westerly direction, he reached the Dawson on November 5;
but two days before he had reduced the number of his party.</p>
<blockquote>"It had now become painfully evident to me, that I
had been too, sanguine in my calculations as to our finding
sufficiency of game to furnish my party with animal food; and the
want of it was impairing our strength.* We had also been
compelled to use our flour to a greater extent than I wished; and
I saw clearly that my party, which I had reluctantly increased on
my arrival at Moreton Bay, was too large for our provisions. I
therefore communicated to my companions the absolute necessity
for reducing our number. All, however, appeared equally desirous
to continue the journey, and it was therefore but just, that
those who had joined last should leave. Mr. Gilbert, however, who
would, under this arrangement, have had to retire, found a
substitute in Mr. Hodgson, who had, perhaps, suffered most by
additional fatigues; so, that he and Caleb, the American negro,
prepared for their return to Moreton Ray. Previous, however, to
their departure, they assisted in killing one of our steers, the
meat of which we cut into thin slices and dried in the sun. This,
our first experiment, on the favourable result of which our
expedition entirely depended, kept us during the process in a
state of great excitement. It succeeded, however, to our great
joy, and inspired us with confidence for the future. . . . The
daily ration of the party was now fixed at six pounds of flour
per day, with three pounds of dried meat, which we found
perfectly sufficient to keep up our strength."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Yet, at this time (1881), we are paying a
bounty on poor kangaroo and wallaby heads. The extermination of
natives and dingoes has resulted in a plague of marsupials.]</p>
<p>We shall see, that in a short time, this allowance was again
lessened, as to flour, by one-half.</p>
<p>The party thus reduced, Leichhardt and his companions
proceeded on their journey. On November 5, as I have said, they
came upon the head waters of the Dawson, which river they
followed until the 14th. Then striking in a northerly direction,
they crossed a system of tributaries; naming Palm Tree Creek and
Robinson's Creek; but falling into the very natural error of
giving a westerly course to the latter. Leichhardt himself had
considerable doubt as to the propriety of this decision, for he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I could not decide to my entire satisfaction whether
my views were right, for the country was difficult for
reconnoitring, and I was necessarily compelled to move quickly on
to accomplish the object of my expedition; but it is a very
interesting point for geographical research, and I hope, if not
anticipated by other explorers, to ascertain at some future
period, the course of these creeks and rivers."</blockquote>
<p>Still pursuing their intended direction over a rather
difficult country, they came in sight of Expedition Range on the
27th, having by this time become fully inured to the hardship and
privation incidental to such a journey. Iguanas, opossums, and
birds of all kinds they gladly consigned to the stew-pot as
choice variations from the usual meal of dried beef or kangaroo.
Some flour, accidentally spilled on the ground, was carefully
scraped up with dry gum tree leaves, and a small quantity which
became mixed with those natural spoons and an unavoidable portion
of dust, was converted into porridge, which, with the addition of
a little gelatine, the travellers considered they enjoyed. On the
28th they discovered the Boyd, another tributary of the Dawson,
but which Leichhardt seems to have thought wended in the same
westerly direction that he had assigned to Robinson's Creek. By
December 7, they reached Zanica Creek, whose bed they found
entirely dry, and here they had their first encounter with the
blacks, which fortunately ended in no more mischief than the
wounding of a horse. On the 10th, they crossed Expedition Lange,
and travelling with varying incident, passed over Albinia Downs,
and reached the Comet Creek on the 28th. On the banks of this
they found "the remains of a hut, consisting of a ridge pole and
two forked stakes about six feet high, both having been cut with
a sharp tomahawk." This, they did not doubt, was the work of some
unhappy runaway from Moreton Bay, but they do not seem to have
observed or looked for any other sign of a white man's existence.
Still following the creek, they came, on January 10, 1845, to its
junction with a river which Leichhardt named the Mackenzie. This
they travelled along for some time; and on the 14th, found in its
broad and sandy bed the creeper which we now know as the
Leichhardt or Mackenzie bean. The seeds of this they roasted and
used as a substitute for coffee. On the 18th they left the
Mackenzie flowing to the north-east, and pursued the course of
the expedition.</p>
<p>Of the country thus travelled over, Leichhardt's impression
was, upon the whole, favourable. The frequency and peculiarity of
the scrubs through which he passed struck him as one of its most
prominent characteristics. Geologically, he found it of
sandstone, which, from its accompanying coal beds and other
indications, he considered identical with the formation of the
Lower Hunter District of New South Wales&mdash;although, in
several localities it had been broken by basalt as in the spine
of the Expedition Range. Generally speaking, he thought the
country well-watered; and, unless where the brigalow scrub was
more than usually thick, well calculated for pastoral settlement,
more especially on the heads of the Dawson and its tributaries,
and between Expedition Range and the Mackenzie River. This river
he supposed to disembogue into Broad Sound; a very natural
conjecture to anyone unaware of the coast range by which it is
diverted into the Fitzroy. We must, moreover, not forget that the
main object of Leichhardt was not the discovery of country for
settlement, but the practicability of communication between the
southern colonies and the north coast of Australia. That he
effected so much in the way of what may be termed alongside
exploration, beyond the mere line of his route, is as creditable
to him as it was ultimately advantageous to the public.</p>
<p>I now return to his journey. Leaving his party engaged in the
process of drying and packing the carcass of one of their
bullocks, he proceeded on a reconnoitring expedition on January
18, accompanied by one of his blacks. In this he got entangled in
the scrubs, and narrowly escaped losing his track&mdash;but the
wonderful quickness and accuracy of observation which his
companion possessed, in common with all the aborigines, was of
great service in enabling him to regain his camp. They then went
on their way through a country of alternate flats and scrub,
varied by some rich plains. The wild marjoram which they found
here they collected, adding it to their tea, as well as using it
frequently as a condiment in their soup. On January 26, they
crossed Newman's Creek&mdash;a tributary of the
Mackenzie&mdash;and here Leichhardt planted his last peach
stones, with some apprehension, however, that the frequent fires
that overran the country would prevent them reaching maturity. On
the same day he came on the magnificent downs, out of which rise
the "succession of almost isolated gigantic conical and
dome-topped mountains, seeming to rest with a flat unbroken base
on the plains below," which last he named, and we know as, the
Peak Downs. Unfortunately, the season was one of drought, and on
a reconnoitring expedition on the 27th, both Leichhardt and
Calvert suffered greatly from thirst, finding all the
watercourses dried up. In another expedition, Gilbert, the
botanist, found little water, but observed the sign of an anchor
or broad arrow cut into a tree with a stone tomahawk. Keeping
their camp stationary for about a week, but still exploring round
the range, he met fresh objects of admiration every day. On
February 6, they again started in a north-westerly direction, and
got involved in a series of ranges, probably spurs from a
secondary range connected with the Peak Mountains. Travelling
across them, with their thick vegetation and deep valleys and
ravines, was exceedingly difficult. "The bullocks upset their
loads frequently in climbing up and down the rocky slope, and our
progress was consequently slow." On the 10th he therefore altered
his direction to NNE., and came to the head of Hughes' Creek in
latitude 22° 23'. On the 13th, he reached a river, which he named
the Isaacs, whose bed he found dry. Here he camped by a water
hole on the bank, intending to examine the country in advance,
and by this time he had reduced the six pounds of flour per diem,
firstly, to three, and then to one and a-half. He had been
troubled by the desertion of his two blacks, who had grown
discontented and left him, but after a short interval, returned.
Still reconnoitring the country as he went, he examined Coxen's
Peak and Range, and after a short rest on the Isaacs, continued
his journey along that river, his blacks occasionally
insubordinate and troublesome. Now and then he met with the
natives, with whom he seems to have kept on kindly terms. By
March 7, he had come to the heads of the Suttor, down which he
travelled for several days, passed its junction by the Cape or
Belyando, until he reached the point, at which it ran into a
large river which he named the Burdekin. This he considers to
have formed the boundary of the second division of his journey,
and here he found the most northern habitat of the black
swan.</p>
<p>Of the country thus passed over, he formed a higher opinion
than of the previous division. The basaltic character of the
plains and open downs, thinly timbered with open forest, and the
luxuriance of the grass excited his admiration. He, however,
expressed fear that the supply of water would be inadequate to
the wants of the settler. In his lecture, before alluded to,
delivered at Sydney, on August 18, 1846, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"If, at a close examination, a sufficient quantity of
water should be found, a wide extent of country will be opened to
the squatter, who will travel with his herds without difficulty
over the level country along the Isaacs and its tributaries, and
will ascend on gentle ridges to the plains of Peak Range, and,
probably, still further to the westward, beyond another range of
peaks which we perceived in that direction. He will strike the
beautiful country at the head of the Isaacs and the Suttor, over
which at present numerous flocks of emus roam, and fill with
animation that immense tract of country which spreads out round
the foot of Coxen's Peaks."</blockquote>
<p>How far and how beneficially these predictions have been
realised, we shall by and by see.</p>
<p>His course was next up the Burdekin, through a hilly tract,
and on April 5, he had reached Robey's Range. Porter's Range
being visible, and the soil improving, until he came upon a large
field of basalt, in latitude 19° 58'. Still following the course
of the Burdekin, and through a country of very variable levels,
but which he believed to be well adapted for grazing purposes, he
arrived at the junction of the Clark on the 22nd of the same
month, and of the Perry on the 24th. Crossing the Valley of
Lagoons, and the heads of the Burdekin, he journeyed over the
ranges which divide the heads of the Lynd from those of that
river with no greater trouble than the loss of a horse, which,
however, he turned to account by drying the flesh of the animal
for eating. This he thought equal to that of a bullock, supposing
both to be in equal condition but hunger may have had something
to do with such an apposition. He suffered considerable privation
in his reconnoitring, being on one occasion fifty hours without
water, but the increasing prospect of success seems to have
stimulated himself and his companions to renewed exertion; and
they had now reached the end of what he considered his third
stage, and were on the verge of the plains whose coast line is
formed by the Gulf of Carpentaria. He considered this part of the
country to be "characterised by its supply of running water, by
its primitive rocks, its limestone, its numerous ranges, and its
fine, open, well-grassed forest." If a settlement were
established on the east coast, he thought it should be "at the
mouth of the Burdekin, which I suppose to be at Cape Upstart on
the southern extremity of Halifax Bay"&mdash;a supposition,
unfortunately, not borne out by subsequent exploration. He
noticed the difficulty of communication from the coast to the
interior, but rightly suggested that "practicable roads will no
doubt be found in the progress of colonization." The lapse of
twenty-eight years has seen strange changes in the condition and
prospects of the country traversed by Leichhardt.</p>
<p>Resting awhile, the travellers celebrated the 24th of May (the
Queen's Birthday) with a "fat cake," made of four pounds of flour
and some suet, and with a pot of sugared tea. Sugar they had been
without, except for luxury or as a medicine, for a long time, and
their salt was now exhausted. In a little while they became
accustomed to relish their food without either. But privation
increased upon them. They pursued their journey along the Lynd,
past Kirchner's Range, over rugged country, and, with
considerable difficulty, falling in with frequent native camping
places, until, on June 18, they rested to kill and cure one of
their cattle.</p>
<blockquote>"Although," (says Leichhardt), "we were most willing
to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, and to
revive our own ambitious feelings at the memory of the deeds of
our illustrious heroes, we had nothing left but the saturated
rags of our sugar bags, which, however, we kept for the purpose,
and which we now boiled up with our tea; our last flour was
consumed three weeks ago, and the enjoyment of fat cake therefore
was not to be thought of."</blockquote>
<p>The position was far from enviable, but they had not yet
arrived at the worst. In the lower part of the Lynd they first
met with the green tree ant, a spiteful insect, living in small
societies in rude nests constructed between the green leaves of
shady trees: and here they came across the tracks of an
alligator. When they arrived at latitude 15° 51' 26", they
determined to leave the Lynd and strike to the west, having first
discovered and named its supposed tributary the Mitchell. After
travelling a few days, they began to experience significant
indications of the hostility of the natives, which, on the 28th,
culminated in a night attack, in which Gilbert, the botanist, was
killed, and Calvert and Roper severely wounded. After burying
Gilbert, Leichhardt and the remainder of his party wearily
continued their task, and on July 5, to their great joy, came in
sight of the salt water of the Gulf of Carpentaria. A line of
communication between the south-eastern coast of Australia and
the Gulf was at length opened. Then, by slow stages, they reached
the "Albert" of Stokes in about a month; crossed the Plains of
Promise, and ascertained their extent, and on September 8, still
keeping to the coast line, passed the line which now marks the
western boundary of the colony of Queensland. They had thus
traversed the fourth and fifth of the divisions in which
Leichhardt arranged his journey.</p>
<p>His observations on these portions are clear and of
considerable interest. He found&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"the same succession of rocks, granite, talc[s]histe,
porphyry, and sandstone in descending to the Gulf which he found
at the east coast in ascending to the table-land. But limestone
was not to be met with on the west side of the York Peninsula,
though it appeared extensively developed on the Burdekin. Basalt
has broken through the various rocks, but the level country
itself is formed of a clayey ironstone with grains of quartz,
which extended all round the Gulf to Port Essington, and may be
considered of a newer formation. The Lynd was joined by several
running creeks, and was, in its whole course, well supplied with
water. The country was openly timbered and well
grassed."</blockquote>
<p>Of the Plains of Promise, he remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Should a harbour be found at the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, which might allow ships to approach and moor in
safety, it would not only open this fine country to colonization,
but would allow the produce of the high land of the York
Peninsula to be brought clown to the Gulf of Carpentaria, as well
as to the east coast. Cattle and horses could be easily driven
from coast to coast, and they would even fatten, as water and
feed are everywhere abundant."</blockquote>
<p>The Plains of Promise have been opened to colonization, and
are now occupied by herds of cattle, and even the produce of the
high land of York's Peninsula seems to be no longer
problematical.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary in a history of Queensland, to extend
the narrative of this remarkable journey. Its interest, from the
point at which Leichhardt had arrived, is confined to mere
personal adventure, for the character of the country did not vary
much from that of the regions which he had recently passed, or,
where it did, only repeated the features of other rugged country
over which he had travelled. How far his party were harassed, may
be conceived from their preserving only one of their bullocks,
losing all their dogs, having been compelled to destroy many
valuable ornithological specimens, and being almost indebted for
the preservation of their lives to the offices of friendly
natives, whom they met as they neared Port Essington. On December
17, they reached that settlement weary and worn, having travelled
3,000 miles over a previously unknown country, and been nearly
fifteen months absent from every trace of civilised society. No
overland explorer in Australia has achieved so much as
Leichhardt, and many of them had far more ample means.</p>
<p>He stayed a month at Port Essington, when, a small schooner
calling at the settlement, he embarked for Sydney, where his
arrival was welcomed, first with surprise, and then with the
enthusiasm which anticipated success is apt to generate. "All
classes pressed forward to testify their joy at our
re-appearance, which we found had been long despaired of, and to
offer their aid in supplying our wants." The adventurer of 1844
was the hero of 1846. Rather more than £2,500&mdash;the joint
contribution of the Government and of public
subscriptions&mdash;was divided in suitable proportions between
the party, and the gold medals of the Royal Geographical
Societies of London and Paris were awarded to Leichhardt when the
news reached Europe. Unhappily, he did not live to receive them.
There was something of the spirit of Alexander in the
man&mdash;conquests achieved only stimulated to enterprises of
greater difficulty.</p>
<p>During all this time the progress of the infant settlement had
not been slow. As I have said, the pressure of the times had
compelled the squatters of New South Wales to turn their
attention to fresh modes of utilizing their flocks and herds than
the sale of wool, or of sheep and cattle for ordinary
consumption. Accident had combined with experiment to perfect the
process of boiling down carcases for the production of tallow,
and an establishment for such a purpose was founded at Kangaroo
Point, then a suburb of Brisbane, and now a ward of the
municipality. A seam of coal was opened&mdash;although with no
tangible result&mdash;at Red-bank, on the banks of the Bremer
River, the mineral having been previously discovered, both by
Allan Cunningham and Mr. Andrew Petrie, to extend over a large
area of country from that locality in the direction of the Pine
Mountain, about twelve miles north of Ipswich. There was, in
fact, a good deal of general advancement, as well as a spasmodic
sort of energy, which looked promising for the prospects of the
district. And, in the fulness of time, that indispensable
accessory of civilization&mdash;the newspaper, was to be
established.</p>
<p>For some time, Mr. Arthur Sydney Lyon, a gentleman of good
education, indomitable energy, and respectable connections, had
contemplated commencing a newspaper in Moreton Bay. The want of
such a convenience was beginning to be felt, inasmuch as, save in
official reports or infrequent private correspondence, the
condition, wants, and resources of the district were almost
unnoticed in the parent colony, while its very existence was
tacitly ignored or forgotten in the more distant ones. Many of
the residents who had been accustomed elsewhere to the advantage
which a public journal affords, began to talk of its necessity,
and an active canvass for subscribers resulted in such
encouragement to Mr. Lyon, that he entered into arrangements with
Mr. James Swan, a printer, resident at that time in Sydney, for
the printing and publication of the proposed newspaper. The
inducements held out by him, however, seemed to Mr. Swan, when he
arrived, little likely to be realised. There were but few houses
in Brisbane, and the streets existed only in name. But the
assurances of the settlers calmed his apprehensions. He was told
that the interior would afford advertisements, subscribers, and
cash. By degrees the faith necessary to enterprise was instilled
into him, and the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i> commenced its
existence on June 20, 1846. It was a modest weekly sheet of four
pages, about half the size of an ordinary newspaper, and was
printed in the garrets of a brick building, afterwards occupied
as an inn, and since burned down, at the north-west corner of
Queen and Albert Streets, Brisbane. From such a small beginning
it has grown with the growth of the colony into a valuable and
important property, and in connection with the
<i>Queenslander</i>, its worthy accompaniment, continues to hold
what Johnson would have called a considerable position amongst
the colonial press.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I am indebted to Mr. Swan for the almost
inestimable advantage of the perusal of a complete file of the
<i>Courier</i> from its commencement, which I gratefully
acknowledge.]</p>
<p>The motto chosen by the editor was: "I am in the place where I
am demanded of conscience to speak the truth;" and in his first
leading article be became somewhat grandiloquent.</p>
<blockquote>"The <i>Courier</i> has been established, in
compliance with the almost unanimous wish of every resident of
character, property, and intelligence in this extensive district.
The unfounded impressions that prevail elsewhere respecting the
climate, capabilities, and resources of this portion of the
colony, and the absence of those beneficial moral influences
which have their origin in the press, have long rendered a local
journal necessary. The commercial importance of the community
indeed demands its introduction. Churches, schools, stores,
shops, inns, dwelling, houses, and erections for various
purposes, have rapidly risen; settlements have become villages,
villages towns. Our staple articles of export&mdash;wool and
tallow&mdash;have strikingly increased; and with their increase
fresh incitement has been afforded to industry and enterprise.
And, as the position of the grazing and trading classes, who form
the bulk of our infant society, has improved, and population has
augmented prosperity has placed requirements that can only
appertain to an advanced state of society. Perhaps none is so
urgent as that which we aim to supply."</blockquote>
<p>A week afterwards the heading of the leading article
is&mdash;"We want a Bank."</p>
<p>The statistics of Moreton Bay at this time will probably
provoke a smile from the reader, if sought for to substantiate
"the commercial importance of the community." The number of
houses in the then County of Stanley&mdash;which comprised all
the country east of the Great Dividing Range&mdash;was, according
to a census taken in the preceding March, 255, of which 41 were
of stone or brick, and 214 of wood. But of these, 50 were
unfinished, although only 6 were uninhabited. The population of
North Brisbane was 483; of South Brisbane, 346; of Ipswich, 103;
of the squatting stations, 452; and the military and government
establishments numbered 185. There was the usual disproportion of
the sexes&mdash;1,122 males, and 477 females. 538 could not read,
and 857 could read and write. There were 6 lawyers and 6 doctors,
14 clergymen, and 13 "other educated persons"&mdash;a rather
ambiguous description. Only 23 were engaged in agriculture. On
the Darling Downs 551 males and 107 females formed the
population; 1 doctor served for the diseases of the people; and
no lawyer being mentioned there, it is to be presumed that none
existed at that time to vex the souls of clients with costs. Of
"other professions"&mdash;a puzzling sort of
nomenclature&mdash;there was 1; 147 out of the whole number could
neither read nor write; and upon the whole, it does not seem to
have been a very literate community. As to religion, the numbers
of the various denominations stood thus:&mdash;Church of England,
1,110; Church of Scotland, 338; Roman Catholics, 575; Wesleyan
Methodists, 24; other Protestants, 59; Jews, 10; Pagans and
Mohammedans (coolies), 28; other persuasions, 13.</p>
<p>Official documents are not always the safest data to adopt. A
letter in the <i>Courier</i>, of July 11, adverting to the number
of clergymen supposed to be in the County of Stanley, affirms
that there were only two ministering in the district, one a Roman
Catholic, another of the Episcopal Church. The others had either
left the colony, or abandoned their functions for more lucrative
or less laborious pursuits. The Anglican minister seems to have
had an active time of it, for it is said that he&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"not having any residence in town, and having to make
frequent tours of duty among the squatting stations, can only
come in occasionally on Saturday night, perform service on Sunday
morning, and start off again to his labours in the bush either
immediately after service or on Monday morning."</blockquote>
<p>As a pendant to this description, I may add, that I do not
find any schoolmaster or teacher specially mentioned in the
census returns. Such persons were probably either non-existent or
not thought worthy of mention. But the Darling Downs district
even then had 14,000 cattle and 210,000 sheep grazing on its
fertile plains.</p>
<p>As a natural consequent, the tax-gatherer came on the heels of
the prosperity which the editor of the <i>Courier</i> depicted in
his inaugural article. A Collector of Customs arrived on June 13,
1846, and his satellites soon followed. The establishment was not
a very profitable one, the expenses of the first year amounting
to more than the collections.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with the new paper, a steamer called the
<i>Experiment</i> was started to ply on the river between
Brisbane and Ipswich, and a flour mill and a new saw mill were
projected. The steamer fares between the two townships were, by
the cabin, six shillings; by the fore-cabin, four shillings;
freight, per ton, was seven shillings and sixpence, afterwards
reduced to six shillings, and wool was charged at two shillings
per bale. Considering the difficulties which beset the effort,
the owner of the <i>Experiment</i> was singularly moderate,
although the fares between Brisbane and Sydney at the time ranged
from £2 to £4. Few of the older residents of the southern
districts will fail to remember the energy and spirit, which, in
a chequered and sorrowful struggle through life, marked every
enterprise of poor Pearce. The greater part of his career in
Moreton Bay may be fitly described as one of experiment. Towards
the end of his life, pain and poverty imparted a querulous
irritability to a temper naturally active and impatient, but it
is not easy to appreciate the advantages which his spirit and
example, displayed at a critical time, conferred upon a community
far more willing to complain of defects than to recognise
exertion.</p>
<p>And having thus seen the struggling settlement endowed with a
newspaper, a custom house, and a steamer, I close the
chapter.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">While</span> the labours of explorers and the
exertions of the settlers were thus extending the boundaries and
disclosing the capabilities of the district of Moreton Bay, the
Home Government were not unmindful of the facilities it offered
to relieve them of one difficulty&mdash;that of dealing with
their convicts. Lord Stanley, on March 3, 1846, describing the
proposals of the Colonial Office, said, in the House of
Lords&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"the Government to which he belonged had thought
proper to appoint an additional colony to the north of the Colony
of New South Wales, beyond the limits assigned to that colony,
the new colony not being too near the tropics to prevent its
being healthy. It was intended that a number of these convicts
who had reached the most advanced&mdash;that was the
lightest&mdash;stage of penal discipline, should go to that
colony, where they would be furnished with provisions for a
limited period, and also a portion of land. They would also be
permitted, if they thought proper, after a certain interval, to
emigrate to the adjoining colonies and become the servants of the
outlying population of these colonies. The class of convicts who
would be sent to the new colony, would be those, who, when they
arrived there, would be in the position of having received a
conditional pardon."</blockquote>
<p>This proposal met with great favour in the district. The
squatters saw, or thought they saw, a chance of obtaining an
almost unlimited supply of that labour, from the want of which
they had suffered severely, as well as in the new settlement an
outlet for their surplus stock. But one part of the plan was
strenuously objected to&mdash;the giving land to the convicts;
thus, in the language of the <i>Courier</i>: "placing them in a
much better position than the men of virtuous character." The
inducement to the "exiles," as they were called, to stay in the
new settlement, which such a gift presented, was, it appears to
me, more appreciable by the employers of labour than any argument
derived from merely moral considerations. But whatever might have
been their opinion, the scheme once set on foot was prosecuted
with vigour. The permanent Under Secretary for the Colonies laid
a minute before the Lords of the Treasury, containing a summary
of the principal points; and, "My Lords'" reply:</p>
<blockquote>"The necessity of affording relief to Van Diemen's
Land is so urgent, and the obligation upon the Government of
finding for the better class of exiles who have made some
progress in reform, a relief from that contamination to which the
present state of Van Diemen's Land exposes them, is so
imperative, that my Lords do not feel justified in refusing their
acquiescence in the formation of the new settlement, as proposed
by the Secretary of State for the Colonies&mdash;approved as it
has also been by the Secretary of State for the Home
Department."</blockquote>
<p>And so the necessary measures were proceeded with.</p>
<p>By this plan the classes to be sent were two; all exiles (that
is, convicts transported with pardons, to take effect immediately
on their landing), and all pardoned convicts in Van Dieman's Land
unable to earn an independent subsistence. Measures were also to
be adopted to secure a proper proportion of the sexes. Rations,
bedding, etc., were to be provided for the convicts for one year,
after which they were to maintain themselves, professedly on land
granted to them for cultivation. £10,000 was to be expended on
public works, the settlers contributing labour. Free emigration
was permitted but not encouraged. The staff by which this
population was to be governed, was thus settled:&mdash;A
superintendent, at £800 per annum; a colonial secretary, at £300;
a clerk, at £200; a chairman of quarter sessions, at £300; a
clerk of the peace, at £200; a sheriff, at £100; a chaplain, at
£250; a land surveyor, at £300; and three magistrates, at £100
each. The cost would not have been great on the whole, while the
relative importance attached to the offices, as indicated by the
salaries, seems curiously at variance with common routine; but
the plan contained within itself the elements of failure.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Barney, of the Royal Engineers, was
appointed superintendent, and arrived in Sydney in September,
1846. Early in the following November, he called in at Moreton
Bay in the <i>Cornubia</i> steamer, having on board with him a
surveying staff to assist in determining the locality of the new
settlement. The New South Wales Government was in the mean time
busy in selecting his subordinates. When he had chosen a site, in
the vicinity of Port Curtis, the superintendent returned to
Sydney, and in January, 1847, left for his Government in the
<i>Lord Auckland</i>, which was to be followed by the <i>Thomas
Lowry</i> with the remainder of the military stores and other
necessaries. Sanguine anticipations were indulged in of success
in the formation of the settlement, which, it was hoped, would
terminate the perplexities of the squatters of Moreton Bay, and
at once supply them with labour and furnish them with a
market.</p>
<p>These anticipations were, perhaps happily, not realised. The
first proceeding indicated the unfitness of the new Governor for
his task. In order to strike terror into the solitude, cannon
were brought on deck for a salute in honor of the special
landing; and such pomp and circumstance as military and official
uniforms, receptions, presentations, and the like could ensure,
were enjoined. In the midst of these preparations, the ship
struck on a sandbank off Fairy Island, and the whole ceremony was
disarranged. The crew and passengers landed as best they might,
and the arrival of two small vessels from Brisbane prevented any
danger of starvation. After much irresolution, Colonel Barney got
to the main land, was rowed up a creek, and is understood to have
decided upon a site for the town he was not even to lay out; for
here his authority ceased. While waiting in helpless uncertainty
whether to stay, or to return to Sydney, a despatch was received
from the Imperial Government announcing that the letters patent
under which North Australia had been created into a separate
colony, would be revoked, and directing that the establishment
formed there should be immediately broken up. Colonel Barney and
his officers were to be employed, as occasion might serve, in the
Colony of New South Wales. There was nothing to be done but to
comply with these directions; the philanthropic plan of
converting "exiles" into agriculturists was abandoned, and, with
that abandonment, the hopes which had been formed of the supply
of labour, and the consumption of stock for Moreton Bay, faded
away also. The only tangible result of the whole, was a bill for
£20,000, the cost of the experiment.</p>
<p>Before Colonel Barney had arrived in Sydney, a change of
Governors had taken place. Sir G. Gipps had become involved in
acrimonious controversies with his new Council, which destroyed
all hopes of amicable administration; his health began to give
way, and at length, on July 11, 1846, he left for England. Very
much of the acerbity which marked the disputes prevalent during
the latter portion of his governorship, arose upon questions
connected partially with the right of taxation, and prominently
with the interests of the pastoral community. These questions,
however, belong more immediately to the history of New South
Wales, and having been discussed at length in the works of Dr.
Lang and Mr. Flanagan, it is scarcely necessary here to repeat a
twice-told tale. Sir George Gipps was succeeded by Sir Charles
Augustus Fitzroy, a member of the ducal family of Grafton, who
had previously filled appointments of a similar nature, and, as
is usual under circumstances like those we have described, was
credited with all the qualifications in which his predecessors
had been supposed to be deficient. He landed in Sydney on August
3, being received with enthusiasm: his "manly and dignified
deportment," according to the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, of
that day, "seeming to presage golden auguries of his future
popularity among us." By way. I suppose, of enforcing this
opinion, the same journal thus describes the subject of its
prophecy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In person, Sir Charles is dignified and commanding;
his countenance agreeable and intelligent; while his manner and
bearing eminently display that dignified courtesy and chastened
affability which form the distinguishing characteristics of a
high-born British gentleman."</blockquote>
<p>Had the new Governor's qualifications for government been
equal to the personal ones thus flatteringly attributed to him,
he would have found full occupation for all. The whole colony was
in a state of ferment, and its principal leaders were more or
less in collision with the Colonial Office, on the subjects which
provoked it, Foremost of these, was that of the land laws, which
were, at that time, in a very chaotic condition, and on whose
proper nature, then as now, the most contradictory opinions
prevailed. Whether the upset price of land on alienation should
be five shillings or twenty; whether of the two&mdash;total
alienation or sale at a quit rent&mdash;would be most desirable:
what sort of tenure should be given to the squatters, or whether
any certain tenure should be given to them at all; what should be
done with the land revenue, or who should have the disposal of
it?&mdash;these were the questions on which the colonial mind was
sorely exercised, and in which a very puzzling inconsistency was
displayed by both the home authorities and colonial politicians.*
Next to this question, came that of transportation, in which,
from the nature of the community, disputes were constant and
bitter, while the ill feeling thus engendered, was at times
exasperated by the tantalizing course pursued by the Colonial
Office, whose authorities clung with great tenacity to the idea
of substituting for the penal system, which had been abandoned, a
reformatory one, in which the colonies should complete the
amendment&mdash;which Pentonville and Portland, it was hoped, had
commenced. And behind the two, and soon to assume equal
proportions, was the framing of the new Constitution, on which
the colony was to be governed; on which as great a variety of
opinion prevailed as there were politicians to express it. The
position of an Australian Governor was, at that time, one of much
greater weight and responsibility than it is now; and I can very
well imagine that Sir Charles Fitzroy's, between the Colonial
Office and the colony, was not one through whose difficulties a
fine person and commanding deportment would prove sufficient
guides.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Robert Lowe, then a barrister in Sydney,
now haling a commanding position in the House of Commons, began
by advocating the quit rent system. In a few months afterwards he
was a warm defender of alienation by sale.]</p>
<p>In the question of dealing with the Crown lands, the district
of Moreton Bay was seriously interested, and that its importance
was thoroughly apprehended, may be gathered from the meetings and
discussions which constantly took place. Not in the hope of
supplying anything approaching to a complete view of the subject,
but rather as an assistance to the reader in estimating its
nature, I propose to devote some space to a review of the
legislation connected with it.</p>
<p>Originally the lands of Australia seem to have been dealt with
without reference to any sound or even deliberately arrived-at
principle of distribution. In New South Wales they were evidently
looked upon as constituting a fund from which to reward
services&mdash;real or supposed&mdash;to subsidize a favourite,
or to supply gratuities to convicts, who by their good behaviour,
seemed to have merited encouragement. After the first
establishment of the convict settlement, in 1788, Governor
Phillip made grants to some free immigrants and a few convicts,
on condition of residence and cultivation. His successors, Hunter
and Macquarie, continued the system on a large scale. When
Governor Brisbane was appointed in 1821, the Home Government
desired to provide employment for the necessary number of
convicts whom its own opportunities were not sufficient to find
work for; and emigrants who could show that they had an available
capital of from £500 upwards, were encouraged to go to the colony
by the promise of grants of land&mdash;the grunts varying from
one hundred acres to two thousand acres&mdash;the grantee
undertaking to employ prisoners at the rate of one for every
hundred acres that he received. While this system was in
operation, the speculative mania of 1825 broke out in England,
and one of its results was the formation of the Australian
Agricultural Company, with a nominal capital of £1,000,000
sterling. To this company the Home Government granted a million
of acres, with unrestricted right of selection; ** and the
example they set was followed by not a few persons of influence
in the old country who wanted an opening for spare capital or
speculative energy. But the evils arising from the favouritism or
corrupt practices, which such a system engendered, led to a
change, when Sir Richard Bourke&mdash;one of the ablest governors
that the colonies have yet seen&mdash;was appointed in 1831. Sale
by auction was fixed upon as a method of alienation, the
general', upset price being five shillings per acre. This was
increased to twelve shillings in the administration of his
successor, Sir George Gipps, and I believe, on his
recommendation&mdash;that Governor having a somewhat exaggerated
idea of the value of land as a revenue producing commodity,
especially town allotments, on which the most absurdly high
prices were fixed. The Wakefield theory of "the sufficient
price," on which the colony of South Australia was founded, had,
at this time, many supporters amongst the liberal philosophic
economists of the old country, who almost alone turned their
attention to colonial subjects; and, as that was fixed by its
author at £1 per acre, the Government of the day, influenced by
the reasonings of the school to which I have alluded, and the
pertinacious representations of Sir George Gipps as well,
increased the upset price to that amount&mdash;a maximum which
may be considered to have acquired a species of historic tenure,
after the passing of the 5 and 6 Victoria, c. 36, in 1842.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This, however, was moderate, having regard to
the Western Australian precedent. On the settlement of that
colony, enormous grants were made to individuals on very slight
grounds&mdash;the Governor, Sir James Stirling, getting many
thousands of acres, Some of the fortunate recipients afterwards
hawked their territories amongst the London speculators, selling
some at threepence and fourpence per acre. [Indistinct word]
differences of a farthing per acre were not despised.]</p>
<p>But, contemporaneously with the settlement by alienation of
land in the counties or districts which had been proclaimed
within the limits of government in the colony of New South Wales,
another species of occupation had grown up, which, at first
permissive, gradually assumed something of the appearance of a
vested interest, and led to the existence of a class between
which and the ordinary settlers on the soil, and the inhabitants
of the towns, there has been, for many years and throughout the
Australias, a continuous and sometimes bitter hostility. These
were the squatters, or in the more courteous designation adopted
by themselves, the pastoral tenants of the Crown&mdash;a body
whose industry has exerted a vast influence both on the
settlement of the colonies and the trade and prosperity of the
empire at large.</p>
<p>Its commencement was the result of an accident, or rather a
combination of accidents, unexpectedly assisting the development
of a premeditated plan. Captain Macarthur, an officer of the then
102nd regiment of the line&mdash;or New South Wales
corps&mdash;was, in 1803, sent home from New South Wales by
Governor King in punishment for his conduct in a duel with a
brother officer. Before this he had paid considerable attention
to the breeding of sheep, having obtained a few pure merinos,
which he crossed with the ordinary coarse-wooled sheep of the
colony, and by degrees formed what would now be considered a very
small flock. Some of the wool from their fleeces he took home
with him, and shortly after his arrival, memorialised the
Government on the subject, simply asking leave to "occupy a
sufficient tract of unoccupied lands to feed his flocks." His
request might possibly have shared the fate of ninety-nine
hundredths of similar applications, had it not been for a quarrel
in England between the woolen manufacturers and their workmen,
the latter objecting to the employment of anyone who had not been
apprenticed to the trade, and relying on an old prohibitory
statute of Queen Elizabeth's in their favour. Ultimately, the
question turned on, whether wool was an article of
limited&mdash;interpreting that as of local&mdash;production. Mr.
Macarthur's specimens were submitted to the manufacturers, who,
finding that they afforded the contradictory proof required,
became instant and zealous in his support. In consequence of
that, instead of a license to occupy, he received a grant of
5,000 acres of land, and a promise of 5,000 more if he succeeded
in proving the possibility of the export of fine wool in quantity
from New South Wales. He returned to that colony with some
carefully selected sheep from the royal flocks, and continued his
efforts, selling annually a moderate quantity of his produce to
settlers who were desirous of following his example. But he had
to bear the discouragement and ridicule which is the natural lot
of pioneers who are venturesome enough to turn from the common
path, and have much or all to learn. By 1820, his flock had
reached about two thousand in number, three hundred of which were
said to be pure merinos; the whole number of sheep at that time
in New South Wales being about one hundred thousand. Into the
difficulties resulting to him from his participation in the
quarrels which unhappily occurred at the time of Governor Bligh's
administration, and hindered his operations, it is not necessary
for me to enter.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See "Lang's History of New South Wales."
Through the kindness of the late Mr. Fitz, Clerk of the
Legislative Council, I have read the original report of
Macarthur's trial in England for mutiny in the arrest of Bligh,
and Lang's statement seems to me to be thoroughly borne out. The
report gives one a curious notion of the state of Government and
of morals in those days.]</p>
<p>Macarthur, however, was not, as has been generally claimed for
him, and believed, entitled to claim the sole honor of founding
the greatest industry in Australia. The late venerable Samuel
Marsden, the first colonial chaplain in Australia, harassed by
the difficulties of his situation, returned to England from New
South Wales with a retiring Governor (Captain King) early in
1806.</p>
<blockquote>"He had" (says his biographer), "discerned the
wonderful capacities of Australia for sheep farming, and having
brought home some wool and found it much approved of by the
manufacturers, he therefore ventured to petition George III. for
a couple of merino sheep from the Royal Farm at Windsor to
improve the breed."</blockquote>
<p>The king gave him five, which he carried with him on his
return, and found all the resultant advantages he anticipated.
The objects to which the royal gift was to be applied, are
described at length in the thirteenth chapter of this volume; but
that he is entitled to share with Macarthur all the honors of a
pioneer in the growth of colonial wool for British manufacturers,
there cannot be a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>When Macarthur and Marsden had demonstrated that wool of the
required quality could be produced, they became prophets in the
eyes of those who had derided them. The age of testimonials not
having then arrived, their admirers desired to recognise their
sagacity by participating in their success. The Government
encouraged the pursuit by granting annual licenses for free
occupation. One of the most ultra of the old squatting school
thus summarises the progress it made, and the aims that progress
suggested:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The lands were lying waste; the Government very
wisely encouraged their occupation, and licensed any free and
respectable person who wished to occupy them. Commissioners were
appointed to manage these waste lands, and the occupants
voluntarily paid an assessment to defray the Commissioners'
expenses and that of the police under their direction, so that
their occupation might not cost the Government anything. But in
the course of time when nearly all the available lands within a
practicable distance were occupied, great evils were experienced
from the arbitrary acts of these functionaries, who assumed great
power in defining the extent of runs by lessening one run to
enlarge another. They were accused of receiving bribes, and of
acting very unfairly between man and man. The occupants were
powerless against the Government, as they had only an annual
license&mdash;they could not be otherwise than
dissatisfied&mdash;they required a better tenure to secure them
against the irresponsible acts of an arbitrary Governor and his
needy subordinates." **</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** The Crown Lands of Australia. By William
Campbell, M.L.C. Blackwood, London and Edinburgh, 1855, p. 10.
Campbell went to England as the representative of the Victorian
squatters, to advocate their right to a "preferable right of
purchase" over the whole or any part of their runs, and this book
was part of his advocacy.]</p>
<p>The squatting license fee was £10 per annum. Sir George Gipps
wished to compel the licensee, in addition to the payment of his
fee and assessment, to buy annually 320 acres of his run, at a £1
per acre, the revenue thus raised to be applied to the increase
of immigration. This was felt as a great grievance by the
squatters, and was protested against as illegal and
unconstitutional by many who had little general sympathy with
them&mdash;foremost among whom was the Rev. Dr. Lang. When the
squatters published their counter proposals, he, with equal
vigour, contested their justice; they in turn resented his
opposition and forgot his advocacy.</p>
<p>Whether their wishes were reasonable or not, the industry had
grown to such dimensions by the period of which I am now writing,
that direct legislation was acknowledged on all sides to be
required. The export of wool, which had been under eighty
thousand pounds weight in 1819, reached in 1845, 17,364,734 lbs.,
and the time had obviously arrived for dealing with tenure of the
land, of which so large a production necessitated the occupation.
After much petitioning, wrangling, and correspondence, the Act 9
and 10 Victoria, c. 104, was passed in 1846, and, under that Act,
the celebrated orders in Council, which have been regarded as the
Magna Charta of the squatters' tenure, were issued in March of
the following year.</p>
<p>The orders were simple enough in arrangement, but not always
clear in expression. By them the colony of New South Wales was
divided into "settled," "intermediate," and "unsettled"
districts. In Moreton Bay the settled districts comprised the
then County of Stanley, and all lands lying within three miles
from the sea "measured in a straight line;" it had no
"intermediate" district, and therefore the great bulk of the land
was treated as "unsettled." By the rules to be enforced in such a
district, leases of runs for fourteen years were authorised to be
granted for pastoral purposes, the lessee having permission to
cultivate for his own use, but not for sale or barter. The
minimum annual rent to be paid for any run was to be £10, the
carrying capability not being allowed to be less than for four
thousand sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle, according to a
scale to be fixed by the Governor; and £2 10s. per annum was to
be added for every additional thousand that the run might be
estimated as able to carry. The mode of estimate and payment I
need not trouble the reader with. During the continuance of the
lease of a run, the land was not to be open to purchase by any
other person than the lessee, and to him in quantities of not
less than one hundred and sixty acres at a time, and at a minimum
price of £1 per acre, the Governor having the power of increasing
it if he saw fit. No lot thus sold was to have a water frontage
of greater proportion than 440 yards, "reckoned in a straight
line," to 160 acres in quantity. The ninth section of the second
chapter reserved to the Government the power of granting or
selling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"any lands within the limits of the run, or lands
comprised in such lease, for public purposes, or disposing of, in
such other manner as far as the public interest may seem best,
such lands as may be required for the sites of churches, schools,
or parsonages, or for the construction of high roads, railways,
and railway stations, or other internal communications, whether
by land or water; or for the use or benefit of the aboriginal
inhabitants of the country, or for public buildings, or as places
for the interment of the dead, or places for the recreation and
amusement of the inhabitants of any town or village, or as the
sites of public quays, or landing-places on the sea coast or
shores of navigable streams; or for the purpose of sinking
shafts, and digging for coal, iron, copper, lead, or other
minerals; or for any other purpose of public defence, safety,
utility, convenience, or enjoyment, or for otherwise facilitating
the improvement and settlement of the colony; but so that the
quantity of land which may be granted er sold to any railway
company shall not exceed in all the rate of one hundred acres for
every mile thereof in length." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Compare this with modern land grant
schemes.]</p>
<p>In the case of a railway being made through an unsettled
district, all lands within two miles of the line might be
resumed, and sold "at the end" of each successive year "from the
date of the lease. Occupants of Crown lands who had been in
licensed occupation foe one year before the order in Council came
into effect, and all who had been occupants for a shorter period
were, at the expiration of twelve months from the date of their
license, declared entitled to demand leases of their respective
runs. There were several provisions for tenders for new runs, and
for determination of the right as between competitors for a run,
which it is not necessary to recount here; but one of those
relating to forfeiture is worth quoting, as illustrative of the
supposed, or, as some say, the real character of the
times:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the event of his (the lessee's) conviction by a
justice of the district for any offence against the law, the case
may be enquired into within three months after the conviction by
two or more justices who, if they think fit, may judge the lease
to be forfeited, with or without compensation for the value of
the improvements, according to the nature of the
offence."</blockquote>
<p>It must have been consolatory to the possible subjects of such
a regulation to know that any forfeiture thus decreed required
the sanction of the Governor before it could be put in force. The
fifteenth section was of more general importance. Upon the
expiration of a lease, the lessee was to have the option of
buying the run at a valuation of it in its unimproved state,
starting with a minimum of twenty shillings per acre. If declined
by the previous lessee, the improvements were to be valued and
the upset price was to be calculated on the joint value of the
land and improvements, the worth of the latter to be paid to the
previous occupant. If no part of the run were sold, the lessee
was entitled to a renewal at a rent estimated on its carrying
capability in its improved state, but not to be increased by more
than fifty per cent. on the old rent; if not more than one-fourth
were sold, he was entitled to a renewal for the remainder on the
same conditions, but nothing was said of what was to be done if
more than one-fourth were alienated. In the intermediate
districts the leases were to be for only eight years, power being
reserved of resumption at any time on compensation for
improvements, and sixty days' previous notice. In the settled
districts the leases were to be from year to year.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with giving effect to these orders within
the colony, an Act to regulate the assessment on stock depastured
outside the settled districts, was passed in the Legislative
Council. The rate was fixed at a halfpenny for every sheep, three
halfpence for every head of cattle, and threepence for every
horse; the owners of runs being required to make returns of the
numbers of each description depastured by them.</p>
<p>I have gone more into detail on this subject than may at first
sight be interesting to the general reader; but it is to be
remembered, that these orders formed the grounds for agitation
and dispute up to the time that responsible Government was
conceded to the colonies; that they were long after that time
resorted to as a sort of text book of land legislation; and that
a correct apprehension of their bearing is essential to a right
understanding of the disputes which, for years, raged between the
pastoral lessees and their opponents, as to the rights of
run-holders, and the most just and expedient method of dealing
with the public lands. I have not, however, thought it necessary
to overload this history by any recapitulation of the numerous
subsidiary regulations that were issued subsequently as to the
detailed method of carrying the Orders and Assessment Act into
effect.</p>
<p>Looking back at the orders, after a lapse of nearly
thirty-five years, they seem to me to have been framed in a very
indulgent spirit towards the class most interested. It had
substantially what it asked&mdash;security of tenure until the
public requirements called for the resumption of the land; and it
had leases of a length which, to men who had been subject to a
yearly and uncertain license&mdash;and in the colonies where the
long terms, general in the old country, were then, and are even
now, unknown&mdash;must have been more favourable than could
reasonably have been, or, in fact, was, anticipated.
Nevertheless, the orders were received with a good deal of
grumbling in the district of Moreton Bay; but in some respects,
on grounds directly opposite to those taken up by the class who
had been most clamorous for the settlement, with which they now
professed to be discontented. The restriction of the lease to a
minimum,&mdash;which, as the carrying capacity of the land was
then estimated, involved large areas on whose extension no
limitation was set, and the prohibition of cultivation, were
specially attacked.</p>
<blockquote>"We had long indulged" (wrote the <i>Courier</i>,
with great pertinency) "the hope, that some encouragement would
have been given to agriculturists as well as sheep farmers. Why
the two classes should not have been put on the same footing with
respect to the licensed occupation of the land, we are at a loss
to comprehend; or why the poor man, with his 500 or 1,000 sheep,
should not have been permitted to occupy a portion of this vast
territory, we are likewise unable to conjecture. The small farm
system, which has found many able advocates in this colony and
elsewhere, is thus effectually knocked on the head, and the poor,
industrious man can never hope to rise to a higher grade than
that of a labourer."</blockquote>
<p>More weight than would otherwise attach to this objection,
accrues from the fact, that it was urged by what was regarded as
a squatter's advocate at the time. The forfeiture clause, which
made the legally unimpeached moral character of a lessee&mdash;as
determinable by, it might be, hostile Justices of the Peace, who
could try him for "any offence," and on their own mere
motion&mdash;an essential condition to the retention of a run,
improved or not, was regarded as a covert insult to the whole
class of squatters. What was most to be regretted, was the
careless and blundering phraseology of the ninth or general
reservation clause in the second chapter of the orders, which
left an opening for those claims by lessees as against the public
to the freehold of their runs, when the discovery of gold had
enormously increased their value, which formed the subject of
that lengthened controversy which has left behind it so much
distrust and ill-feeling. Great outcry was made by the "Liberal"
party against the fourteen years' leases, as what was called
locking-up the country from settlement, but, perhaps, with
insufficient reason. When the country was wanted, as in Victoria,
it was taken. No one could at the time have anticipated the gold
discoveries, and had not they occurred, it is questionable if the
leases might not have been renewed in the majority of instances
for another fourteen years without detriment to the public
interest.</p>
<p>This, however, was the condition in which the new Governor
found the land laws&mdash;a settlement like the conclusion of
Rasselas&mdash;in which nothing was concluded, at least in the
estimation of the public, who were supposed to be satisfied. They
were displeased with the upset price, and discontented with the
auction system; some thinking the land laws too liberal, and the
great majority denouncing them as narrow in principle and unjust
in operation. Earl Grey looked at his work with considerable
complacency&mdash;he had, as he thought, got rid of a troublesome
agitation, in reality he had laid the foundation for half a
dozen, each still more troublesome.</p>
<p>On the transportation question, there was at this time, little
outward difference of opinion in the district of Moreton Bay. The
introduction of the convict, fresh from conviction and sentence,
all agreed on objecting to; but the establishment of some scheme
for the admission of prisoners who had served a portion of their
time, and, by apparent good conduct, earned some remission of
punishment, met with favour by the majority of the then scanty
population. Transportation in its old form had been discontinued
since 1840, and it was so well understood by the colonists that
it was never to be renewed, that Mr. Gladstone, in opening the
subject, did not care to controvert the reasonableness of the
impression. But his successor, Earl Grey, had his own view on the
subject, and most of the squatters and a considerable number of
the population of New South Wales, headed by the celebrated
William Charles Wentworth (a lawyer of extraordinary force of
character and splendid oratorical powers), were not wanting in
effort to assist him in carrying them into effect. Judging from
the tone of the <i>Courier</i> of that day, I should judge, that
in this part of the then colony, the friends of the "exiles," the
mild term then in fashion, were in the ascendant.</p>
<p>That the want of labour had a principal effect in determining
the course pursued by the settlers in the then outlying districts
of New South Wales, I cannot, doubt. In their despair they turned
to all quarters whence they had reason to suppose it might be
obtained&mdash;to China, to the South Seas, to India; but while
they were thus troubled, a despatch from Mr. Gladstone, dated
April 30, 1846, to the Governor of New South Wales, gave a new
direction to their efforts. In that letter, while disclaiming
anything like a renewal of the old system of transportation, or
suggesting any definite plan, he stated that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"it would be acceptable to Her Majesty's Government
if the members of the Legislative Council of the colony should
show a disposition to concur in the opinion, that a modified and
carefully regulated introduction of convict labour into New South
Wales, or into some part of it, may, under present circumstances,
be advisable."</blockquote>
<p>The hint was sufficient to arouse the anxious squatters into
immediate activity. The Legislative Council sittings commenced on
October 8, and a select committee to enquire into and report upon
the despatch was immediately appointed. The committee brought up
their report on the 31st. In that document they recommended the
annual importation of five thousand male and an equal number of
female convicts of the milder kind; a simultaneous free
immigration being carried out to a similar extent. A few days
afterwards, and immediately before the Council was prorogued, the
report was ordered to be printed for general information and
discussion, a similar privilege being denied to a petition
against transportation in any shape, which had been presented by
Mr. Charles Cowper.</p>
<p>While the main matter was thus left in abeyance, the
stockholders of the district held a meeting at Ipswich, at which
it was resolved to petition the superintendent of the intended
colony of North Australia to permit "the departure of a certain
number of expirees from North Australia in search of work
immediately on their arrival at the seat of your Government." A
strong article appeared in the <i>Courier</i>, advocating the
course recommended, but as the proposed settlement fell through,
nothing came of the meeting, or of the dinner which followed, or
of the article which may be supposed to have derived some vigour
from that convivial termination. Disappointed so far, the
squatters held another meeting at Brisbane on May 31, to consider
a proposition made for the importation of labour&mdash;from Van
Diemen's Land, and from the South Sea Islands, when resolutions
approving the plan were carried, and subscriptions entered into,
but I do not see that anything further was done in the matter.
Subsequently an Imperial circular, prohibiting the transportation
of criminals from one colony to another, was sent to the
Government of New South Wales, and thus anything like the forced
introduction of labour from the other colonies became
impracticable. The importation, however, of "exiles" kept hold of
the attention both of the home and colonial governments. When the
Legislative Council re-assembled in Sydney in April, 1848, the
subject was again alluded to in the Governor's speech, and a
despatch of Earl Grey's, relative to it, was laid before the
Council. His lordship, although not assenting to the views
previously stated by that body in the report of their committee,
yet adopted the principles it embodied, and the Council lost no
time in meeting his wishes. On April 6, they passed a set of
resolutions pledging themselves to co-operate with Her Majesty's
Government in carrying out the policy
recommended&mdash;unconscious that the Secretary for the Colonies
had anticipated their resolve by despatching in the previous
December a small detachment of "exiles" in the <i>Mount Stuart
Elphinstone</i>, which reached Sydney, <i>viâ</i> Hobarton, on
June 6. This does not, however, seem to have disturbed the
friendly feeling now apparently established&mdash;and the renewal
of this modified form of transportation seems to have been
accepted as a certainty.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously, as I have said, great efforts were made to
devise means for bringing free immigrants to the district, and
constant complaints were made that its wants did not receive due
attention from New South Wales. The complaints seem to me to have
been louder than the efforts to remove their cause were genuine.
Immigration to New South Wales, which had been for some time
intermittent, was resumed in August, 1847, but the intelligence
did not deter the stockholders and employers of labour from
meeting in Brisbane in January, 1848, to form an association for
the importation of labour from India. Between three and four
hundred labourers were subscribed for, and the Governor was
memorialised to assist in getting some of the restrictions which
were in force in India on that sort of traffic removed. The
Government, however, refused to interfere, on the ground that the
proposed conjoint introduction of "exiles" and free immigrants
rendered that of Indian Labour unnecessary&mdash;a conclusion
which the deputation, charged with presenting the memorial,
combatted, because "the Indian immigrant was more adapted than
the European one for the purposes of shepherding"&mdash;an
argument whose force the New South Wales Government declined to
admit. Whether discouraged by this reception, or hopeful of the
arrival of "exiles," I cannot say, but as far as practical
results are concerned, the Indian Labour Association went the way
of its predecessors. The station of Burrandowan, in the Burnett
District, was, I am told on undoubted authority, formed during
this year, by Mr. Gordon Sandeman, one of our oldest and most
respected colonists, entirely with Coolie labour imported by
himself. The experiment he regarded as altogether successful, and
not the least noteworthy incident connected with it, is, that one
of the Coolies marrying, is now in an independent position in
business in Queensland, while two of his sons carried off prizes
more than once at their school examination. Twenty-seven free
immigrants arrived from Sydney in April, but although described
as "decent and orderly," they do not seem to have been received
as if their coming had been very anxiously looked for, and while
the residents were pondering over the best means of getting a
cheaper description of labour, the dissolution of the Legislative
Council gave a new direction to their thoughts. But before it
broke up, the Governor laid before it a despatch from Earl Grey,
recommending a colonial loan for free immigration, not exceeding
in the whole, £400,000, and re-payable by instalments in two or
three years. The only interesting portion of that document to the
historian of Queensland, is the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Bearing in mind the probability of a future
separation of the northern from the southern districts of the
colony, a separate account should be kept of the expenditure
incurred for immigration into each, in order that the debt may
eventually be divided between them in the same
proportion."</blockquote>
<p>This shows that even then an early division was not unfamiliar
to his lordship's mind.</p>
<p>But before that question could assume any definite shape, that
of the constitution under which both the parent colony and those
separated from it were to be governed, called for settlement. It
was quite evident that the system which prevailed at the time was
one which could not last. The people were becoming more and more
discontented with it; the leading politicians of the colony were
dissatisfied with its partial exclusion of them from any higher
function than that of mere assent or dissent; and they found
every avenue to political power closed against them. In the
Legislative Council they exercised the slightest possible control
over either taxation or expenditure, and none whatever in the
choice of the ministers of the day, by whom they were outvoted at
will. All legislation on the most important matters affecting the
public interest was denied to them, and their influence was in
reality confined to the extent to which they might act upon
public opinion&mdash;an opinion, whose expression found its way
to the Home Government almost as, and when, the Governor and his
advisers thought proper. But while few denied the grievance,
there was scant agreement as to the precise form the remedy
should assume. There were, of course, multitudinous and
irreconcileable suggestions, and the Abbe Sieyes might have found
work after his own heart in their incorporation into one or other
of the constitutions, of which he was so prolific an author.
Besides, the distribution of the population had very much changed
since the establishment of the 1843 Council, and as it was
understood that the new one now to be elected would have to deal,
at least suggestively, with electoral legislation in all its
branches, there was, in the centres of population, no small
agitation and controversy on the main points at issue. To assist
the colonists, Earl Grey transmitted a despatch to Governor
Fitzroy, in July, 1847, in which, while announcing the intention
of the Home Government to separate the Port Phillip District from
the colony of New South Wales, he discussed at some length the
leading principles upon which representative institutions should
be carried into effect. Very few of his conclusions&mdash;to some
of which more detailed reference will be required
hereafter&mdash;were acted upon, but there is one paragraph which
I think worth quotation, as the evils and complaints it
describes, were very much like those with which, after an
interval of nearly thirty years, we are familiar at the present
time.</p>
<blockquote>"Local self-government" (says Earl Grey), "if
necessary for the good of the whole colony, is not less necessary
for the good of the several districts of which it is composed.
For this reason it was that Parliament provided for the erection
throughout New South Wales of municipal corporations, which
should, in various respects, balance and keep in check the powers
of the Legislative Council. By this method it was supposed that
the more remote districts would be able to exercise their fair
share of power, and to enjoy their proper influence, in the
general policy of the whole province. But the result has
disappointed this expectation. The municipalities have only a
nominal existence&mdash;the Legislative Council has absorbed all
the other powers of the colonial state. The principle of
self-government in the districts most remote from Sydney, is
therefore acted upon almost as imperfectly as if the conduct of
local affairs had remained under the same management and
institutions as those which the existing system superseded.
Members, it is true, are chosen to represent those districts in
the Legislature; but it is shown that such of the inhabitants of
Port Phillip as are really qualified for this trust, are unable
to undertake it at the expense of abandoning their residences and
their pursuits in the southern division of the colony. Thus the
Port Philip representation has become an unreal and illusory, not
a substantial, enjoyment of government." *</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Earl Grey to Governor Fitzroy. Downing Street,
July 21, 1847.]</p>
<p>It does not seem as if these observations, weighty and
well-founded as they were, sank to any depth in the minds of
colonial statesmen at the time, or ever bore much fruit
afterwards.</p>
<p>If we turn from public topics general to the colony to those
which specially concerned the district, we shall find something
to interest us. In so small a community the local events would
almost, as a matter of course, be comparatively unimportant, but,
nevertheless, not to be passed without notice. One of the
principal wants&mdash;a bank&mdash;from time to time engaged
attention. A regulation agreed to by the Sydney institutions,
that they would honour no cheque payable otherwise than to
"bearer," or for a less sum than £2, and suggesting that, to
prevent loss, all cheques should be crossed through some bank,
excited great wrath in the district, especially the restriction
to £2, which, it was alleged, would be productive of great
inconvenience to employers and small storekeepers. Some mouths
afterwards the limitation was lowered to £1. The absence of a
bank and the want of silver, led to the adoption of a system of
what were called "calabashes"&mdash;orders drawn upon some agent
of the drawer, payable at various dates after presentation, and
often for very small amounts. If the drawer were a squatter of
anything approaching to established character, the order would
remain in circulation for a long time; and I recollect that so
late as 1860, I received in change at an hotel in Toowoomba an
order for thirteen shillings and sixpence, drawn upon a Sydney
firm by a late Colonial Treasurer&mdash;which order was then
three rears old, and in the multitude of its endorsements, looked
like a collection of autographs, not of the most intelligible
kind. Considerable loss was sometimes sustained by the holders of
these documents, who compensated themselves occasionally by high
charges for discounting them for the first possessors; and the
establishment of a branch bank was, from various motives,
longingly looked for.</p>
<p>The want of one did not, however, abate the appetite or seem
to cramp the means available of the residents for pleasure. Horse
racing then, as now, was a leading amusement.; and in the first
number of the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i> the leading description
is of the Moreton Bay annual races. Unfortunately, the account
does not specify the total values of the prizes run for; but for
the edification of the curious in such matters, I can give a list
of the stakes at the Anniversary Meeting in May, 1847. The races
lasted three days. On the first day there were the Brisbane Town
Plate of £25, entrance, £2 10s.; the Maiden Plate of £20,
entrance, £2; and the Welter Stakes of £20, entrance, £2. The
second day offered a Hurdle Race for £20, entrance, £2; and a
Hack Hurdle Race of £15, entrance, £1 10s. The third day seems to
have been the busiest: there was the Publicans' Purse of £25,
entrance, £2 10s.; the Ladies' Purse of £20, entrance, £2; the
Tally-ho Stakes of £20, entrance, £2; the Beaten Stakes of £10;
and the Hack Race of £5, entrance, 10s. The little community
squeezed out £180 for prizes, although the <i>Courier</i>
complains that Ipswich and the back country had held aloof.*
About six months after these races, a regatta was carried out
with great spirit, but although the Brisbane Race Committee have
had a plentiful series of successors throughout the colony,
aquatic sport seems to have been rather intermittently
pursued.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the evening the "boys" kept it up in North
Brisbane in grand style, under the able leadership of a gent
well-known to the sporting fraternity. It so happened on this
particular night that a hogshead of beer was quietly reposing
under the verandah of the Victoria Hotel, when it was observed by
the boys aforesaid. The word was passed, and the cask was set in
motion down Queen Street, as far as the corner of Albert Street.
Finding the amusement highly exhilarating, our heroes commenced
rolling it back again up the hill, and got it as far as the green
opposite the Post Office (nearly to George Street). Here a
council of war was held, and it was decided to make a manful
attack upon the head, as being the most vulnerable part of the
cask. This was soon accomplished, and a general invitation was
given to imbibe the contents, which was accepted by numbers who
had assembled to witness the fun. "Capital stuff, Ned, is it
not?" said one. "Old Tooth is a brick," said another; and all
agreed that it was an excellent remedy for cold. Suffice it to
say, that nearly the whole was drunk by our Bacchanalian and
their guests, without the slightest compunctious visitings or wry
faces.&mdash;<i>Moreton Bay Courier</i>, May 29, 1847.]</p>
<p>Business and pleasure were subjected to a sad interruption in
March, 1847, by the wreck of the <i>Sovereign</i> steamer, at the
Southern Passage to Moreton Bay, when on her voyage to Sydney. In
crossing the bar at that passage, her machinery, which appears to
have been originally unfit for the work required of it, broke
down, and the vessel drifted until it struck, breaking up, from
the unsound condition of the timbers and planking, immediately it
touched the ground. Out of fifty-four persons on board, only ten
were saved; and of these, three were severely injured. Judging by
the contemporary accounts, it is difficult to say where most
blame was attached&mdash;to the culpable overloading of the
steamer, or to the carelessness, or something worse, of the
Hunter River Company in employing so crazy a vessel on such a
service. Protest seems to have been of little avail, as, on more
than one occasion subsequently, I find that overloading was
compelled to be thrown overboard from the company's steamers, to
save the vessels and the lives of the passengers. There were no
Plimsolls in those days; but it resulted from the loss of the
<i>Sovereign</i>, that an agitation was set on foot for the
survey of Moreton Bay, in order that a safer entrance might be,
if possible, discovered. The New South Wales Government were
disinclined to defray the expense, or to undertake the work; but,
as Captain Wickham was willing to superintend the
survey,&mdash;they graciously permitted him to do what they were
too parsimonious or too careless to attempt themselves.</p>
<p>In one thing the interest, or the patriotism, of New South
Wales, was industrious. There was no slackness, since the success
of Leichhardt, in forwarding exploration, although sometimes the
zeal displayed was more conspicuous than discretion. Leichhardt
himself was restless and eager, after the novelty of his welcome
had worn off, to adventure once more into the unknown regions to
the westward, but now with the intention of crossing the
continent from the Moreton Bay District to Swan River. He pursued
his design with characteristic energy. On September 21, 1846, he
attended a meeting at Sydney to receive a testimonial there
presented to him, and in less than a fortnight afterwards, was
heard of as starting from Raymond Terrace in New South Wales, to
join the other members of his company, who were to conic to
Moreton Bay by sea, and meet him on the Darling Downs. His party
and equipment were mustered at Oakey Creek, on November 21. He
left on December 2 for Jimbour (then spelt Jimba, which is
probably the correct orthography), which was to be his point of
departure. He took with him Mr. John Mann, Mr. Hovenden Hely, Mr.
Bunce (a well-known botanist), Mr. Turnbull, and a saddler and a
tanner, and two aboriginals. His travelling stock were fourteen
horses, sixteen mules, 270 goats, 90 sheep, and 40 head of
cattle, as well as a moderate supply of stores. His intention was
to follow on his old tracks until he reached the Peak Downs, and
then to turn westward on his new exploration. Vague reports of
his movements reached the settlement occasionally, but nothing
definite was known until certain news came that he had returned
with his party to the Condamine on July 31. From the narrative
given in the <i>Courier</i>, I gather that all of the party, with
the exception of Leichhardt himself and his blacks, had been
attacked by fever at the Comet River, where they were detained by
floods. When these had gone down, he pushed on for the Mackenzie,
which the party crossed, and camped on the north bank. Here they
turned their goats adrift, but persevered in reaching the Peak
Downs, where they anticipated a bracing atmosphere and renewed
health: but fresh misfortune befel them in the loss of most of
their bullocks and a considerable number of their mules and
horses. Discouraged by these repeated disappointments, Leichhardt
determined to return to the Condamine, and, with new associates,
attempt to discover some more favourable route; so they turned
back, leaving behind a quantity of their stores, which might have
encumbered them, and, after a miserable journey, arrived at Mr.
Bligh's station in a very pitiable condition.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell, then Surveyor-General, had started in
November, 1845, on an expedition for the purpose of ascertaining
the nature of the country to the west and north-west of Moreton
Bay, and, skirting the centre of Australia, of reaching Port
Essington, which last attempt was, however, abandoned. In the
course of his journey he discovered the country which he named
Fitzroy Downs, and the Maranoa River. Further on he found the
sources of the Warrego, and thereafter followed down the bed of a
river falling north-west, which he named the Victoria, and
believed would find its estuary in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In
portions of his journey he crossed the route which had been
previously pursued by Leichhardt, although of course not aware of
that at the time, and hence arose some confusion of names which
for a time perplexed geographers. His descriptions were vivid,
his language vigorous, his anticipations sanguine, especially as
to the great river on which he lavished all his eloquence. But a
subsequent exploration by Mr. Kennedy, who had been one of his
assistants, proved Sir Thomas to have been premature in his
conclusions. The Victoria was by no means a permanent stream,
and, ultimately turning in a south-western direction, became
dissipated in a number of small channels, and was finally lost in
the sandy plains of the interior. Kennedy identified it with the
Cooper's Creek of Captain Sturt, which had been discovered by
that explorer in his South Australian Expedition. Sir Thomas's
glowing descriptions induced the late Mr. Charles Coxen,
accompanied by Mr. Pinnock and a native black, to venture on an
explanatory tour to the Fitzroy Downs, which, however, they
thought, did not justify Mitchell's eulogies, and their
subsequent report seems to have deterred some who intended to
form stations on that part of the country from making the
attempt, at least, at that time.</p>
<p>But Sir Thomas Mitchell's narrative induced Leichhardt to
start after a day or two's rest, on an expedition to the Fitzroy
Downs to examine the nature of the country. It seems tolerably
clear that he did not then find them, although more than once on
the tracks of both Mitchell and Kennedy. He does not appear to
have thought very highly of the country for settlement; and,
having returned to the Condamine, hastened to Sydney to renew his
preparations for a final start. Here, too, he met with a
relative, a Mr. Classen, touching whose real fate there has been
much painful uncertainty. The two left Sydney on December 4;
arrived at Rosenthal on the Darling Downs about February 1, 1848;
and, on the 13th, were in Brisbane, completing their equipment.
On the 16th, they left on their last journey. Leichhardt had with
him, besides Mr. Classen, a Mr. Entinck, formerly of the Hunter
River District; a man named Donald Stuart, who had been in the
service of the Messrs. Leslie at Canning Downs; another man named
Kelly; and two aboriginals. The party had with them fifty fat
bullocks, twenty mules and six horses, with what was described at
the time as a complete equipment. He proposed to follow a river,
called, by Mitchell, the Cogoon, to the Victoria River, following
that explorer's tracks as far as might be necessary to enable him
to discover the course of the northern waters, and then bearing
off westerly for Swan River. The last heard from him was a letter
to the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, dated April 4, 1848, and
written at a sheep station not far from Mount Abundance. A day or
two afterwards, he left Mount Abundance with his party&mdash;and,
thenceforward, was no more seen of his fellows, and became a
memory and a name.</p>
<p>Some comments were made after his departure on the change in
his associates, and Mr. Bunce vindicated himself as to his
secession in a letter of some bitterness, on the ground that it
was by Leichhardt's own wish that the connection was broken off.
Mr. Classen, Leichhardt's relative, took Bunce's place; and,
irrespective of what causes of dispute might have arisen in the
first and abortive attempt. Leichhardt might have preferred a
solitary friend, and beyond him only subordinates who were that
and nothing more, to associates of sufficient standing and
position to form and act upon their own opinions. Modest in
bearing reputation, he seems to have been avaricious in
engrossing it&mdash;a failing the more to be regretted in his
case, because it is possible, that under different arrangements,
his danger might have been lessened, and his fate more fortunate;
but no one can deny his general disinterestedness, his
indefatigable energy, his indifference to privation, and his zeal
in the pursuit of that branch of knowledge of which he was so
devoted a follower, and in which his fame stands second to
none.</p>
<p>While Leichhardt was thus engaged in the task of scientific
exploration, what may be called exploration for settlement, was
being vigorously pushed on. Mr. Burnett, an assistant surveyor in
the New South Wales survey department, left Brisbane for the
Downs country, on March 1, 1841, with the intention of tracing
the waters of the Boyne River, to its supposed mouth in Hervey's
Bay. In this, however, he was prevented by the difficulties
resulting from the nature of the country, and, after travelling
as far as his means admitted, returned to Brisbane. He again left
there on July 20, in his boat, with a crew of seven men, and
reaching Hervey's Bay, proceeded up the "shallow inlets" of
Flinders', which he found to be the openings he was in search of.
Journeying up the river, he at length connected it with the point
he had reached by land, and having, satisfactorily ascertained
this, he examined Wide Bay, and the river debouching into it. Of
the Boyne, or of the country on its banks, he thought little, but
the Wide Bay River, as it was called, he considered the opening
for some future important settlement. On receipt of his report,
the Governor directed that the name of the River Boyne should be
changed to the "Burnett," and of the Wide Bay River to the
"Mary." Thus was the first step taken towards the location of the
now important town of Maryborough.</p>
<p>While the work of exploration was thus going on, new roads and
new settlements were following its tracks, and new stations
forming. In May, 1847, a new road over the Range, and south of
Cunningham's Gap, was found and marked; and, farther north, a
road was traced from the head of the Mary River to a station
about seventy miles farther inland. So far as their limited
numbers permitted, the settlers were assiduous in the discovery
and use of such facilities as by degrees opened upon them, and
the condition of the district seems to have been, if not
violently prosperous, at least progressive. Gradually it was
provided with the usual means for the administration of the law.
A Court of Petty Sessions was established at Brisbane, on March
1, 1847, and another at Ipswich, on July 5. Messrs. M'Connell's
station, at Cressbrook; Cambooya, on the Darling Downs; and
Canning Downs (near Warwick) had been appointed places for the
same purpose, early in the year; but Cressbrook was soon
abandoned. The Government of New South Wales dealt rather harshly
with the residents in closing the old hospital, but an
arrangement was soon come to by which the public subscriptions
were to be supplemented by an annual grant from the revenue, and
the buildings, now swept away for the new Law Courts, were
granted as a hospital for the settlement. The provision of a
decorous building for a church was also attended to, a visit from
the Anglican Bishop of the diocese&mdash;then that of Newcastle,
New South Wales&mdash;materially assisting in the work. The site
now occupied by St. John's, Brisbane, was secured, and plans
obtained by which what now partially forms the south side of the
present building was afterwards erected. There was a slight
agitation about the best locality for the permanent capital, some
turning their faces towards Cleveland, some suggesting the
present site of Maryborough; and there were the usual local and
petty jealousies inseparable from small communities. It was
seldom that any great crime startled them from the generally
quiet though somewhat jovial tenor of their way; and the conduct
of the people seems to have been at least as good as that of
their elder neighbours. I should almost feel justified in
considering it better, could I give the weight which may,
nevertheless, be due to the testimony of Mr. Arthur Hodgson,
then, as now, a large run-holder on the Darling Downs, in behalf
of the settlers in the outlying districts, not usually considered
the most straight-laced in their behaviour. When on a visit to
England in 1848, he informed a meeting, held at the Shire Hall,
Stafford, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"his experience led him to declare, that what was
said respecting the vice and immorality which were represented as
taking place there, was very incorrect. He assured them that he
knew no well-conducted establishment where the master did not
every Sunday assemble together his servants and read prayers to
them, and also, in some instances, a sermon. This was done in
every well-regulated establishment in the colony; and besides,
that he had frequently seen men congregated under a gum tree,
listening to the words of everlasting life."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hodgson spoke from personal observation, and I am
therefore compelled to believe that well-regulated establishments
of the kind he described were not numerous, and that such gum
trees, like the poppies in the old song, <i>were</i> rare,*
although he might frequently have seen the few that did
exist.</p>
<p class="poem">[* Poppies like these. I own, are rare;<br>
But nightingales' songs like his, beware.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">In</span> tracing the history of the
successive efforts at shaping a new constitution for the
Australian Colonies, it is necessary to turn back to Earl Grey's
despatch of July, 1847, which I have before mentioned. The scheme
it embodied had at least the merit of consistency; and, as a mere
theoretical effort, and considered without reference to the
scanty and scattered population of the country and its
dissimilarity of character to that of the older communities for
which the system was suggested might have been suitable, had much
to recommend it. His lordship proposed, in the first place, that
the Legislatures should consist of two Chambers&mdash;one
elective, the other of nominees of the Crown. In the next place,
he recommended the establishment of district Councils, observing
that "evils of a very serious kind result from committing the
inclusive management of the affairs, both general and local, of a
whole province to a central legislature, unaided and unbalanced
by any description of local organization." And he then propounds
the question, whether these councils might not "be made to bear
to the House of Assembly&mdash;the relation of constituents and
representatives." Not the least important proposition, was that
of devising a method for "enabling the various Legislatures of
the several Australian Colonies to co-operate with each other in
the enactment of such laws as may be necessary for regulating the
interests common to their possessions collectively," as, for
instance, customs duties, postal procedure, roads, railways, and
analogous matters.</p>
<p>It will be obvious that much of the value of the bicameral
arrangement, and all of its acceptance with the people to be
governed, would depend upon the conditions attached to the
exercise of the nominatory power on which the second chamber was
to be constituted; and as to these nothing was indicated. Again,
it is by no means clear that such district councils as could have
been obtained in New South Wales at that time, or could be now in
Australia, would afford constituent bodies in any wise more
qualified to select representatives than the general electorates
in the ordinary manner. It is even very questionable whether the
very different character of the duties to be performed by the two
bodies would not so dissimilarize the qualifications of the
members as to impair, if not prevent, that sort of transitional
and gradual exaltation, a notion of which seemed to be floating
in Earl Grey's mind. The worm&mdash;the grub&mdash;the
butterfly&mdash;are pretty as illustrations; but, in the working
of Governments, the supposedly analogous human subject does not
always occupy the analogous situation. As to the federal
suggestion made by his lordship, it is greatly to be regretted
that his firmness in persevering in a provision for that was not
equal to the foresight which dictated so wise a suggestion.</p>
<p>The reception with which the despatch met was by no means
encouraging. The proposal for district councils was encountered
by a storm of opposition from all parties. The country residents
objected that they had not leisure to spend the time away from
their homes that would be required for conciliar duties, or means
to afford the expense of attendance. The members of the
Legislature would have found their powers shorn in the most vital
point to them&mdash;their use in the gratification of local
wishes" and the corresponding maintenance of political position.
And these feelings soon found expression. The Legislative Council
of the colony met on March 21, when the Governor laid before them
a despatch from Earl Grey, stating the terms on which the Home
Government would send out "exiles and ticket-of-leave holders, to
be subsequently followed by their wives and families, and by a
number of free immigrants equal to the number of such exiles and
ticket-of-leave holders at the expense of the British
Government." The other despatch to which I have just referred,
and which had been "published for general information," was also
commended to their attention. On April 6, Mr. Wentworth moved the
co-operation of the Council with the Home Government, in carrying
out Earl Grey's emigration scheme, which was carried after a warm
debate. On May 9, the same gentleman moved a series of
resolutions condemnatory in almost violent terms of Earl Grey's
proposal as to the form of the new constitution, but did not
succeed in carrying them; the Council, on the suggestion of Mr.
Charles Cowper&mdash;long a leading politician in New South
Wales&mdash;determining to frame resolutions for themselves. When
the time came for this, an animated discussion took place, when
at length Mr. Wentworth moved, that the further consideration of
the matter be postponed to that day six months, which motion was
characteristically enough carried, and, for the time, the subject
dropped.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, little opportunity for its renewal, except
as a hustings topic. On June 21, the Council expired by effluxion
of time, and the elections once more occupied the attention of
the district. On that point all that need be said, is, that on
Mr. M'Leay's resignation, from continued ill health, Colonel
Snodgrass and Mr. A. Boyd contested the seat. The total number of
electors for the three counties (Gloucester, Stanley, and
Macquarie) constituting the electorate, was 301, of whom Brisbane
contributed 83, and Ipswich 21. The local journal was complacent
on the increased electoral importance of the district, which was
not sufficient, however, to induce a visit from the candidates,
of whom Colonel Snodgrass was elected on August 22.</p>
<p>The district itself continued to advance quietly but steadily,
and, as a sign of the times, I may note, that at the commencement
of 1848, the <i>Courier</i> had been enlarged to meet the public
and advertising requirements of the improved order of things. In
July, of the same year, the proprietorship passed from Mr. Lyon
to Mr. Swan, and thereupon a change in the politics of the paper
became every day more marked. From a mild advocacy of the exiles,
it gradually altered to a very warm opposition of their
introduction, and thus kept pace with the growing changes around
it. And the old Anglo-Saxon tendency to association began to
display itself amongst the people. The first Oddfellows' lodge
was established in Brisbane on December 8, 1847, to be, in due
time, followed by a temperance society, inaugurated at a public
meeting held in May, 1849. Ever and anon, too, the necessity for
a bank crops up in the reports of the times. On July 8, 1848, the
inhabitants of the settlement memorialised the directors of the
Union Bank of Australia, asking them to establish a branch in
this "rapidly increasing town and district." Their statements in
support possess an historic value in the history of the
settlement, and I, therefore, quote some of them. They affirmed
that the value of the exports for the year 1847, was £72,297, and
that for the current year, they estimated the amount at £100,000.
"The live stock on which our prosperity at present principally
relies, consisted, on January 1, 1848, of 698,938 sheep, 48,267
cattle, and 2,189 horses." It is worth noting, that they suggest
that the growth of cotton "would give an immense impetus to
trade," in which, however, they were mistaken, and they were
pathetic upon the distance all had to travel who had banking
business to transact, and the inconvenience they sustained by
their lengthened journey. But the memorialists addressed a board
which seems fully to have realised Lord Stowell's description of
such bodies&mdash;they never received the courtesy of an
acknowledgment of their application. The want of roads and
bridges seems to have excited a sort of spasmodic attempt at
improvement in the means of transit, for I find a transit company
announced, and much interest evinced in some plans for the
construction of cheap bridges, apparently on the lattice
principle, which, however, resulted in nothing practical. The
scarcity of labour was also a sore trouble. Wages, indeed, seem
to have been moderate, reckoning by present standards. Married
couples received £30 a year and double rations, single men £20
and single rations; the wages of a domestic servant were £14 a
year; shearers fared better in the season, 2s. 9d. per score, or
£3 3s. per week being the current quotation. The absolute absence
rather than the price of labour seems to have been the great
cause of complaint; squatters, "magistrates withal," as the
notice of the occurrence complains, having occasionally to drive
their own bullock-teams. It may easily be conceived, therefore,
that the arrival of fifty-six Chinese immigrants did not much
mend the state of affairs; but that of the <i>Artemesia</i>, in
December, 1848, with 210 male and female immigrants, gave the
inhabitants some satisfaction. "The arrival of the first
immigrant vessel direct from England, is an important event in
the annals of Moreton Bay," observes the <i>Courier</i> of that
date; "an epoch to be often reverted to by the future historians
of the northern colony." I therefore note the fact with a good
grace encouraged by such a prediction.</p>
<p>In other respects the colonists were tolerably active in the
advancement of the district. An application was made to the
central government, that Brisbane might be declared a free
warehousing port, which received scant courtesy at the hands of
the Colonial Secretary, and a peremptory refusal. Nothing
daunted, the petitioners went to the Home Government, and, as a
result, obtained a concession that the town should be made a
warehousing, in distinction from a free warehousing, port. They
followed this up by petitioning for the erection of a building
for a Custom House, and in this, after an acrimonious dispute
with the local authorities as to the best site, they were
successful. The melancholy condition of the old Government
garden&mdash;described as fast sinking into dilapidation and
ruin&mdash;was a reflection upon the economy and taste of the New
South Wales authorities, who would neither preserve it
themselves&mdash;although the collection of plants is said to
have been valuable&mdash;nor allow anyone else to preserve it for
them. But the Roman Catholic body contributed a valuable addition
to the attractions of the place in a church, small in dimensions,
but marked by character and spirit of style, whose loss a later
structure of infinitely more ambitious pretension will not
prevent the architectural connoisseur from regretting. In the
interior the progress of building foreshadowed the townships of
Drayton and Warwick, and Mr. Bunce, making a successful journey
to the Fitzroy Downs, found them, in his opinion, to justify Sir
Thomas Mitchell's description, and reported accordingly. But the
little growing settlement had its discouragements. A heavy fall
in the price of wool "created in the large pastoral districts a
death-like depression, and public opinion&mdash;flying, as usual,
from one extreme to the other&mdash;already predicts the
annihilation of the squatting interest." Over production was
assigned by some as the cause of the fall, but more accurate
observers traced it to the commercial depression in the old
world, following upon the political disquietude of the times; and
the squatters and their supporters took courage&mdash;perhaps
because it was useless doing otherwise. The blacks added to the
vexation of their souls, almost every number of the
<i>Courier</i> containing some account of predatory aboriginal
attacks. These, as a matter of course, were met by such
retaliation as was possible. The whole squatting frontier became
a line of perpetual conflict, in which it is to be feared no
small cruelty was exercised on both sides. Why the hostile
feelings, which found vent in such barbarities, should have been
caused, is a question involving no great profundity of
speculation. There is a selfishness in civilization as in
savagery; each grasping enough in its own development, and
certain to become bitter when the two are opposed&mdash;opposite
as are their special wants, natures, and perceptions. I know of
no better explanation of the foundation of such hostility than
was given many years ago by a South Australian native, when asked
why he killed the settlers' sheep&mdash;"White fellow kill black
fellows' kangaroo; all same black fellow kill white fellows'
kangaroo." The justification to his mind at least was
complete.</p>
<p>The social difficulties of the residents were not altogether
confined to the troubles arising from the natives. They had some
experience of the conduct of the "exiles," who were the objects
of Earl Grey's commiseratory sympathy, and thoroughly apprehended
what might be the consequences of that increased immigration with
which they were threatened, They therefore petitioned for the
return of military protection, in which they were successful. On
November 13, a detachment of the 11th regiment arrived, and took
up their quarters in the old barracks, much to the content of the
people. The next object of their request, was the appointment of
a resident judge, or at least the establishment of a circuit of
the Supreme Court. For this, however, they had yet to wait, and
to endure the miscarriage or prevention of justice, which the
reference to Sydney of all cases for trial could not but involve.
In one respect they were not forgotten&mdash;a remembrance which,
I suspect, the realisation of revenue had as much to do with as
any higher motive. The extension of squatting occupancy rendered
the subdivision of old, and the proclamation of new, pastoral
districts necessary; and in November, 1848, those of Moreton,
Darling Downs, Gwydir, Wide Bay, Burnett, and Maranoa, were
proclaimed accordingly; the late President of our Queensland
Legislative Council, Sir M. C. O'Connell, being appointed
commissioner for the Burnett District. The probability of a
township at Maryborough was spoken of, although influenced, it is
said, by evil reports, there was a disinclination on the part of
new arrivals to take employment in the district, with which,
moreover, communication seems to have been of a very irregular
kind. Early in the following year, a post office was established
at the locality of the proposed town, the mails being carried by
sailing vessel as opportunity offered.</p>
<p>The first number of the <i>Courier</i> in the year 1849,
startled the quietude of what seemed to be sinking into a sort of
sleepy-hollow, with the news of the Californian gold discoveries.
They were received, at first, with a quiescent incredulity,
which, by and by, changed into an active desire, on the part of
some of the more adventurous spirits, to try their chance in the
varying fortunes of a miner's life; but although, from time to
time, the residents were amused or excited by the continuous
reports of increasing yields, I find the influence exerted upon
the district was comparatively small.</p>
<p>What was of far greater moment to the people of Moreton Bay,
was the commencement and partial success of a scheme for
comprehensive and systematic immigration, of which the late Rev.
John Dunmore Lang was the author. That exceedingly energetic man
had long before this time exerted himself very efficiently in the
promotion of free, as distinguished from convict, colonization;
and, in pursuing that course, had brought himself into
ill-favour, not only with a large class in the colony whose
feelings and prejudices were offended by hostility always open
and exasperating, but with the Colonial Office in England, and
with the New South Wales officials, who, with mare or less
feebleness, reflected the opinions and endeavoured to serve the
wishes of their employers. He had, to a great extent, identified
himself with the public and social progress of the colony, and I
remember very well the influence his "History of New South Wales"
* exercised on its first publication on the commercial and
emigrating public in the old country at a time when a great deal
had been written upon, and something done in the way of
colonization, and the merits of rival systems were discussed,
sometimes with more temper than philosophy. I do not think it too
much to say, speaking from my own recollection, that the
exertions of Dr. Lang, at that time, in great measure,
popularised the Eastern colonies of Australia with the British
public. It sometimes belongs to men of great energy to misdirect
it&mdash;of great determination of purpose to mistake the motives
and underrate the integrity of their opponents. And the greater
their appreciation of their object, the more impatient will they
be of opposition, and intolerant of those by whom they are
opposed. Any man of such qualities living and acting in the early
times of these colonies, would, no doubt, find full exercise for
their most extreme development. And I am not at all surprised,
that in the eyes of those who profited, or wished to profit, by
such a state of things as seems to have existed during many years
prior to the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, Dr.
Lang was a very unpopular man.</p>
<p class="foot">[* First edition published in 1839.]</p>
<p>And there were other antagonistic influences exerted by Dr.
Lang's public career. He had visited this district in 1845, and
had then formed a high opinion of its capabilities&mdash;so high
as to induce him to consider that it would soon be as desirable
to separate it from the parent colony as the district of Port
Phillip; and he threw himself with characteristic energy into the
advocacy of separation for both. This did not increase his
popularity with the leading residents of New South Wales, but, on
the contrary, added new intensity to their dislike. It appears to
me, that he practically undervalued the effect all this might
have upon his emigration schemes, and thus became involved in
responsibilities, and exposed to insinuations, against which a
more accurate estimate of the forces he had to contend with, and
a consequently more cautious procedure on his own part, might
have protected him; a judgment, however, which those who
benefited in no small degree by an opposite line of conduct, can
have no right to pronounce. But what was more unfortunate still,
was the absolute intolerance and injustice which he at all times
displayed, not only towards all ecclesiastical systems which
differed from what might be his ideal at the time, but towards
every person who could be supposed to be identified with them, or
who refused to admit the value of his own. He did not scruple to
denounce, with all the vigour of an infallible controversialist,
Roman Catholicism as "the Beast" of prophecy, and what would now
be regarded as a moderate high churchman, as "the image of the
Beast;" the Wesleyan as lukewarm; and, almost as vigorously, the
members of the elder Presbyterian body to which he once belonged,
as "Erastians." And he carried into these disputes, and, in his
later years, into too many of his political contests, an amount
of personal vituperation, of insinuation as to motive, and
suspicion as to dealing, which are hardly to be accounted for on
any possible hypothesis; except, that in all his plans he could
bear,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Like the Grand Turk, no rival
near his throne.</p>
<p>Public men of integrity of purpose, equal to any that he could
claim for himself, found themselves assailed with all the weapons
employed against the most abandoned "emancipist" of ancient
times, and with equal bitterness, until at last it almost seemed
that an Anglican Bishop and a convict editor stood on the same
level in his estimation. Unhappily, this grew upon him with
time&mdash;as, when we compare his latest published works with
the first history to which I have alluded, becomes painfully
apparent. Undoubtedly, his influence on colonial progress was
great&mdash;his exertions, such as no man without great force of
character and strength of constitution, could have been equal to;
but the effect would have been far greater had he admitted the
rights of others to form and act upon their opinions, and not
always declined any estimate but his own.</p>
<p>Different systems of emigration had been tried previously to
this experiment. For a time the New South Wales Government
adopted one of bounties&mdash;so much per adult for the
immigrants imported&mdash;a plan which naturally led to great
abuses in the efforts of holders of bounty
orders&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., orders for the introduction of a given
number of immigrants&mdash;to sell them to advantage, and of
shippers, to recoup themselves by abridging as far as they could,
the convenience and comfort of their passengers. Then the
proceeds of the land sales were applied, sometimes directly, and
sometimes in anticipation, by way of mortgage raised on the
security of the land fund, for the payment of passages. And, in
aid of either, the home Government occasionally paid the cost of
chartering vessels and of provisions and other necessary
equipment from the English Treasury. In addition to this,
intending purchasers of colonial land acquired by a deposit of
their money with the home authorities, a right to nominate
emigrants for free passages in the Government vessels, at the
rate of one adult or two children for every £20 so deposited. But
in every case the approval of the emigrants and of the
arrangements connected with their voyage, was subject to the
control of a board, called the Land and Emigration Commissioners,
sitting in London, whose notions of the actual wants and wishes
of the colonists seem to have been not infrequently of a vague
and shadowy nature.</p>
<p>At this time various efforts had been made to test the
suitability of the soil and climate of Moreton Bay to the growth
of cotton. Small samples submitted to Manchester manufacturers
had obtained their approval, and it seemed probable, that could
the plant he cultivated economically and profitably, there was an
opening for a large trade, and for the settlement of a
considerable and prosperous population. Dr. Lang was persuaded,
or persuaded himself, that it could, and his enthusiasm was tired
by the prospect. He thought that he saw the starving poor and
anxious middle classes of the old country brought into
remunerative competition with the slave holding cotton growers of
the Southern United States, and a doubly philanthropic purpose
carried out, not only without drawing upon, but in reality to the
great assistance of, British commercial and manufacturing
industry. We may assume that he was in error, but at that time,
and afterwards, until experience supplied a refutation, the great
majority of our people were of the like opinion. Estimates
showing a more than average profit were given to him, and
well-informed men of sanguine temperament vouched their
correctness. To create a new industry, to form a new colony, to
deal to slavery no slight blow, and to relieve his
fellow-countrymen from poverty and suffering, were, singly,
objects worthy of all the energy that could be thrown into the
support of their combination, and assuredly, in the doctor's
case, that energy was in nowise spared.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang, after his visit to the district in 1845, left New
South Wales for England in the following year, and arrived there
in December, when he immediately commenced what may be termed an
emigration crusade; lecturing, writing in the public journals,
corresponding and employing all the means that an enthusiast
would be most likely to adopt in furtherance of his objects.
After some time thus occupied, he attempted the formation of a
company, called the "Cooksland Colonization Company," * and while
engaged in that, applied to the Colonial Office for free passages
for one hundred emigrants, to be selected by himself at Glasgow,
and to be employed in the cultivation of cotton in Moreton Bay.
On November 2, 1847, a reply to the application was given, to the
effect, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dr. Lang had previously published a volume,
entitled "Cooksland," descriptive Of the district.]</p>
<blockquote>"if an association shall be actually formed for
trying the cultivation of cotton, and should agree to purchase
land belonging to the Crown on such terms as would be compatible
with the existing law on the subject, there would be every
disposition on the part of Her Majesty's Government to meet the
association in the selection and despatch of emigrants to that
land, but that Earl Grey could not begin by promising to send out
the people, leaving it to be afterwards settled whether the body
upon whom they were to be dependent, would be organised and would
acquire the land upon which they were to be
employed."</blockquote>
<p>He lost no time in answering this by a long letter, dated
three days afterwards, in which he asked that the proposed
association should be entitled to lease land, with liberty to
select and purchase at the upset price, such as might be found
most suitable for their purposes; the cost of carrying out the
experiment, as well as the purchase money of the land bought,
being allowed by the Government to go against the passages of the
immigrants. To this proposal a flat negative was given by Mr.
Hawes, the Under-Secretary for the Colonies. He persevered,
however, in his efforts for the formation of a company, and for
an arrangement with the Government, finding, as I infer, from a
diligent perusal of the papers before me, great difficulty in
providing such a return as would give a commercial profit to
shareholders, and yet keep within the limits imposed by the
imperial and Local Acts and Regulations touching the sale of
Crown lands, and the selection and passage of emigrants. His
first efforts at the formation of a company, met with many
obstructions, and wore finally abortive, in the face of the
difficulty I have referred to; but he nevertheless persevered,
and chartered the <i>Fortitude</i>, ship, for the conveyance of
passengers to Moreton Bay, committing most of the business
arrangements to Mr. Arnold, a well-known and respectable London
ship broker. In his own letters, and in his evidence before a
Select Committee of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, in 1860,
he states that, prior to the departure of the vessel, in
September, 1846, he had a personal interview with Mr. Hawes, then
Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and received from that
gentleman, if not an assurance, at least what amounted to almost
as much, that the local government would allow to immigrants sent
out by him a quantity of land equal, in proportion, to that made
in the case of those sent out by purchasers under the Land and
Emigration Commissioners. Mr. Hawes did not, when called upon,
recollect any conversation of the kind. These facts, however, are
certain: Dr. Lang undertook the personal responsibility of
sending out the emigrants, and was a heavy loser by the
transaction; and he gave to them land orders at the rate of £16
for every £20 received from them, which orders he had no official
authority&mdash;no authority that he could make legally
available&mdash;to give. But I am unable to come to any other
conclusion, than that he fully believed those orders would be
duly honoured by the local government, unless I assume him to be
something akin to an idiot; for it is in the evidence of some of
the most respectable of the passengers themselves that in not a
few cases only a portion&mdash;sometimes half, or not so
much&mdash;of the passage-money was paid to him or to his agent.
He himself asserts that his loss by the <i>Fortitude</i> was
£1,300, most of which he had paid in London before his return. It
is admitted now, on all sides, that he took great pains to
promote both the physical and moral welfare of the emigrants
while on board. One witness, before the committee I have
mentioned, declared the accommodation in the <i>Fortitude</i> to
have been quite equal to that given to what were termed
intermediate passengers, the ordinary charge to whom at the time
was £35; and I am unable to find any trace of complaint touching
the vessel, or the provisions, or any other matter incidental to
the voyage, Nor is there, in the local records of those days,
anything that can be construed into a charge of wilful deception
made by a single person who came out by the first vessel.</p>
<p>But when the <i>Fortitude</i> arrived in Moreton Bay, on
January 20, 1849, the people on board found that no local
preparation had been made to receive them, and that the gentleman
to whom the vessel had been sent, repudiated the agency. The
local authorities had received no warning, and the local
newspaper complained that no previous notification of the precise
nature of Dr. Lang's plans had been forwarded, or of the time
when the first arrivals might be expected, and that he had
committed the local charge of the whole matter "to a gentleman
whom he had never consulted on the subject, who had never
received, we believe, a line from the doctor since he left the
colony;" and it trusted that he would be able to exonerate
himself from the charge of indiscretion which it considered,
under the circumstances, attached to him. The local authorities
acted with promptitude and consideration, in which they were well
seconded by the residents. On examination by the health officer,
it was found that two cases of fever had occurred within one
month of the arrival of the vessel, and she was placed in
quarantine. The sickness could not have been formidable, for, in
a week the removal of the passengers to Brisbane was ordered by
the Police Magistrate. It does not appear, that on their arrival,
they suffered any unexpected inconvenience. "We gather from the
statements made, that no expectations were raised of an immediate
possession of land, and that the passengers were fully aware that
they must shift for themselves for the present." I quote from the
<i>Moreton Bay Courier</i> of February 19, 1849, from which I
also gather that the character and conduct of the immigrants and
their value to the district were fully appreciated by the
residents, who were not slow to express their satisfaction; while
the immigrants, in their turn, seemed quite content with the
prospects before them.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang had sent out by the vessel a statement of claims on
behalf of the immigrants, and on his own account, which was
forwarded to Sydney, and in the meantime, the new settlers were
provided with accommodation in various ways. In a very short time
almost all were engaged in business or in service, a few
remaining to see when the promised land would be allotted to
them, and they might commence their proposed agricultural
pursuits. But in this their expectations were vain. The New South
Wales Government gave prompt orders for the removal of such of
them as remained on the Crown lands they had been permitted to
occupy, and the right to obtain land at all was peremptorily
repudiated. In fact, the immigrants were most unjustly made to
feel the consequences of the almost vindictive animosity which
Dr. Lang had excited in the minds of Earl Grey and the then
Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy; and I regret to be compelled to
say, that the official correspondence connected with this
immigration scheme, was not in any way creditable to the writers.
For instance, in his statement of the circumstances attendant
upon the arrival of the <i>Fortitude</i>, Sir Charles brought out
the fact, that the vessel had been placed in quarantine; but he
did not say, that within one week from the time this was done,
the passengers were declared fit to be removed to Brisbane. Earl
Grey caught with alacrity at the insinuated mischief, and,
answering Sir Charles's letter, observes, "that they (the
immigrants) arrived <i>with fever prevailing in their ships, and
that there had been several deaths an board</i>. I cannot but
fear," he sympathetically adds, "that this has arisen from the
imperfect arrangements which had been made for the health and
comfort of the passengers, as such an occurrence is so
exceedingly rare in Australian emigration when properly conducted
under the superintendence of the commissioners." The total number
of deaths on board the <i>Fortitude</i> in a voyage of 123 days,
were eight out of two hundred and fifty-six&mdash;three adults
and five children, and only a single death from fever is stated
to have occurred in the bay. It proved an odd commentary on the
Earl's eulogium on the commissioners, that in the <i>Courier</i>
of August 10, 1850, in which his despatch was published, the
arrival of the first emigrant vessel, afterwards sent under their
auspices to the district, was announced with this
addendum:&mdash;"We believe that there were seventeen deaths on
the passage from typhus fever; that fifteen of the immigrants
were reported sick; and that a death occurred yesterday."
Fourteen days afterwards, the vessel having been placed in
quarantine, the surgeon's report was:&mdash;Sick, 56;
convalescent, 63; and, ultimately, the number of deaths reached
10. I find no trace of official sympathy for the sufferers on
this occasion; and not a word of rebuke to the commissioners or
their agents. Earl Grey's animus towards the doctor was somewhat
unworthily exhibited by what was practically a recommendation to
Sir Charles, to encourage any disappointed immigrant to commence
a criminal prosecution against him.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the <i>Fortitude</i> emigrants got settled in
their places when the <i>Chasely</i>, bringing, in all, 225
passengers, arrived in the bay. The same negligence had been
shown, and the same taking for granted that what was necessary
would be done without preparation, just as if every possible
precaution had been taken to secure it&mdash;as had characterised
the want of arrangement in the case of the <i>Fortitude</i>. The
passengers, therefore, had to pay for their own conveyance from
the bay to Brisbane. The Government gave them no welcome beyond a
temporary accommodation in the empty barracks, and what else they
required they had to find for themselves; but no sickness
occurred on this occasion to excite the humane suspicions of
either Colonial or Imperial officials. The doctor forwarded a
characteristic letter with the <i>Chasely</i>, addressed through
the <i>Courier</i> to the inhabitants of Moreton Bay. Reverting
to the <i>Fortitude</i> immigrants, he expresses misgivings as to
their obtaining their lands, but as to those by the
<i>Chasely</i>, he explicitly states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have succeeded, however, in making such an
arrangement with the authorities here as will leave no
uncertainty in regard to the acquisition of land for the
immigrants per the <i>Chasely</i>, as was unavoidable iii the
case of the <i>Fortitude</i>. We have already deposited a certain
amount in the Bank of England to the credit of the Commissioners
of Land and Emigration for the purchase of land in the colony for
those emigrants; and we expect to deposit so much more as will be
necessary when the decision of the Commissioners upon the
emigrants by that vessel generally will be given. They were only
examined this day (December 22) by Lieutenant Lean, on account of
the Commissioners; and the result of that examination will be
known in a few days. It will be transmitted by the mail packet to
the local government at Sydney, and the matter will only be
subject to the delays arising from the official routine in regard
to land."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Lean expressed himself on board as highly satisfied
with all he saw; and, on turning to the Commissioner's memorandum
to Earl Grey, of November 30, 1849, I find that £500 was
deposited on account of the <i>Chasely</i> with them. The
<i>Chasely</i> left the Downs on December 27, 1848; and, as it
was not till June, 1849, that they informed Dr. Lang that they
would in future pass no emigrants for whom the deposit had not
been previously paid, I infer that in the case of that vessel
this prudent condition had not been enforced. It would follow,
then, that the non-completion of the deposit was the cause of the
non-availability of the promised land.</p>
<p>An explanation of this, satisfactory or not, may be supplied
from the obstacles found in the way of establishing the proposed
Cooksland Colonization Company. As far as I can gather from the
published correspondence, that company was left by Dr. Lang, as
stated by him, on some disagreement as to the locality of the
management, and the exact status of the emigrants; but
undoubtedly the disputes with the Colonial Office were not
without effect. Another company was then initiated by him, of
which the prospectus is before me, to be called the Port Phillip
and Clarence River Colonization Company, and he signs the letter
I have quoted from as secretary <i>pro tem</i>. to it. But I am
unable to trace it any farther than a prospectus. No money seems
to have been received on account of shares, and no payments made
on account of the company. Actually, the whole arrangements seem
to have been directed by Dr. Lang. His motive for associating the
district of Port Phillip with his enterprise, I can readily
understand; that was a portion of Australia then popular in
England, and the climate believed to be pleasant and healthy,
whereas Moreton Bay was generally looked upon as an almost
tropical country, not easily endurable from its heat, while its
connection with the "exile" question, prejudiced it with the
general public. To unite the two in one enterprise, would, of
course, benefit that which was least known; but the reason for
adopting the Clarence River as the conjunctive name, is not so
easily perceived. Be this as it may, I have no doubt that, with
his sanguine temperament, Dr. Lang assumed the company as certain
to be formed when he had drawn the prospectus, and the result
was, that he had to bear all the consequences that followed from
acting on such an assumption. The <i>Chasely</i> immigrants at
all events got no land. Of the appropriation of the deposit
acknowledged by the Commissioners. I am not aware.</p>
<p>A curious proof of the sanguine and impetuous nature of the
man, will be found in connection with the <i>Chasely</i>. A Mr.
Bowden, who had been a long time engaged in the management of
sugar estates in Jamaica. A believed the cultivation of the cane
to be practicable here. He agreed with the doctor to come to the
district in that vessel with the purpose of forming a company for
the growth of sugar, but being of limited means, Dr. Lang
guaranteed a promissory note he gave in payment for the passage
of himself and his family. In the letter forwarded by the Cha
say, the doctor warmly urged upon the residents in Moreton Bay
the formation of a company, with a capital of £10,000, in a
thousand shares of £10 each, to carry on the project. He
suggested that Mr. Bowden's expenses should be paid out of the
first deposits, and that a call of £1 per share would be
sufficient for preliminary operations. He deprecated any
application for capital to New South Wales, and dilated upon the
importance of purely local control, and waved before the eyes of
the prosaic workers in the little settlement the glory of
striking a blow at the slave-holders of Brazil and the United
States, by the establishment of the sugar industry in Moreton
Bey. The history of the attempt to form a company which followed,
will be given in its proper place. What is more pertinent to my
present purpose, is, that the doctor's responsibility seems to
have been enforced, while the planters of Australia remained yet
in the imaginative future, on which he loved to dwell.</p>
<p>Carrying on the history of this scheme, I next come to the
arrival of the Lima, on November 3, 1849, bringing eighty-four
passengers. In the letters which accompanied her, Dr. Lang did
not allude to either land orders or emigration companies, but the
passengers brought out with them orders to the value of about
£900, which were, with but a trifling exception, honoured. There
was some imputation made against him from transactions connected
with the payment for the vessel, in which these orders were used
for a time, but, as it appears to me, with but a very shadowy
foundation. With the Lima, the introduction of immigrants on the
proposed system, terminated here, and Dr. Lang found, in
avocations involving less personal risk and pecuniary
responsibility, full employment for the energy of which he had so
superabundant a share.</p>
<p>His conduct in his colonization schemes, has been attacked and
defended with extraordinary virulence. A portion of the
Legislative Council of New South Wales censured him in strong
terms; but, considering the party asperities of that day, and the
nature of the majority against him, I attach little value to
their condemnation. The constituency of Sydney were as warm in
their eulogy; and, for similar reasons, I am inclined to give
only its due weight to that. Earl Grey and others in his train,
accused him of a greed of personal gain, and of a desire to
aggrandise his friends by the proposed enterprise, but we must
take the facts as we find them. Had every emigrant paid the
intended company in full, if all the vessels employed had been as
well fitted and found as the <i>Fortitude</i> and <i>Chasely</i>,
competent judges have deliberately affirmed, that the margin
would have been very small. In the draft charter, which was drawn
up and submitted to the Board of Trade, the dividend was
restricted to ten per cent., a return which, looking at the rate
of colonial interest, and of dividends of colonial institutions,
must be pronounced moderate. His friends, therefore, were not to
be enriched. But as an individual, in the management of his
immigration, he seems to have thrown profit and prudence alike to
the winds. The <i>Courier</i> of the day, gave as a fact, derived
from information supplied by the <i>Fortitude</i> immigrants
themselves, that more than £2,000 had been paid by them to him,
and, considering the source, we may suppose the amount was not
understated. Equal to two hundred and two adults came out in her,
and at the lowest calculation I do not think £15 per head could
be below the cost. If the doctor received about £2,000, he would
have been a heavy loser by that transaction, a loss that would be
increased by his giving credit for portions of passage money to
impecunious passengers. I see nothing extraordinary, under such
circumstances, in his sinking £1,300 on the <i>Fortitude</i>
alone, or losing £3,000 or £4,000 in the six ships sent by him to
this district and to Port Phillip. It is not denied that all his
obligations in England arising from the expenses incurred with
them were discharged, nor that some who anticipated with
eagerness a different conclusion, were not a little astonished at
such a result.</p>
<p>On the precise nature of the understanding between Dr. Lang
and the emigrants, as to the land orders, or their mutual
misapprehensions, I presume not to judge. Both sides have made
their own statement. Dr. Lang, in a letter in the Melbourne
<i>Argus</i>, of May 14, affirms substantially that they had full
value for their money in their passages, the land orders being a
guarantee that they should receive certain portions of land in
addition; and that they were told and knew that, although they
might be put in occupation of the land, no deeds would be granted
until the proposed company was fully formed, and a uniform system
of allotment established. That no land at all was obtained for
some of them, he blames the Colonial Office for. The immigrants,
on the other hand, declared that they paid this money for the
purchase of land, and received a "right to nominate for free
passages themselves and families, or other eligible persons, in
the proportion of one adult for every pound expended." * However
this might be, as to those who paid in full, it could hardly
apply to those who paid half, or less, or to those, who, with a
wise precaution, did, in their own language, "advance deposits
sufficient to cover the cost of their respective passages out;
the remainder being stipulated to be paid on receiving the land
for which they held an order." ** The reader, however, has both
sides of the question. And there is one remarkable fact, with the
parties principally concerned&mdash;with the great majority of
the immigrants assumed to have been defrauded&mdash;Dr. Lang
undoubtedly maintained a good opinion and friendly relations.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Resolutions at meeting held at Ipswich, June
4, 1849.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ibid.]</p>
<p>The conduct of the Colonial Office is another matter. If its
authorities determined to adhere to their routine under any
circumstances, they were right in abiding by their decision; but
the wisdom of the decision itself may well be open to question.
The austere autocracy which could listen to nothing that involved
a chance of profit to associations engaged in an enterprise
that&mdash;as experience of what was substantially the same
system has abundantly proved&mdash;must even, without the
successful cultivation of cotton, have materially assisted the
settlement and industry of the colonies, and with them the trade
of the mother country, melted into a gushing compassion when it
proposed to give to probationary "exiles" a three years' lease of
land rent free, and, at the termination of that, a pre-emptive
right of purchase at the upset price. Dr. Lang asked for
respectable industrious associations one year's lease, to enable
them to select and settle their people, and was, in effect, told,
by the peremptory refusal he met with, that in the eyes of the
Colonial Office of that day, the promotion of free industry was
of infinitely less importance than the reward of a probation for
which an opportunity had been made by previous crime.</p>
<p>If, in thus entering at length into the particulars of an
immigration which exerted a very marked influence upon the
character and course of the district, and of Dr. Lang's
connection with it, I appear to the reader to have dwelt too
minutely or too long upon the various points, I have only to say,
that in the space occupied is condensed the pith of a most
voluminous correspondence, of many debates, of reports,
resolutions, pamphlets, leading articles, and every form of
controversy, extending over more than twelve years. And it was
due to the memory of the eminent man, now no more, whose
character has been impugned, but whose services to the colony of
Queensland cannot be denied&mdash;if the value of independent
government, free from the convict taint which beset the parent
colony, be admitted&mdash;and were formally recognised by its
first, and to him, undoubtedly hostile Parliament&mdash;that his
conduct should be placed in as clear a light as it was in my
power to throw upon it. Not less was it due to the large body of
our population who are connected directly or indirectly, with the
immigrants he was the means of introducing, whose beneficial
influence, at a critical time, upon the moral and social future
of the colony, is beyond dispute. I am neither his defender nor
his apologist&mdash;dissent very strongly from many of his
expressed opinions; have no sympathy with his prejudices,
religious or political&mdash;and in his life time had but the
slightest possible communication with him: and in the course of
this inquiry, have been guided by published documentary
evidence&mdash;admitted by all parties&mdash;bearing upon the
case, and by that alone. If there had been one reason wanting to
induce me to enter upon it, I should have found it in the fact,
that at last his great age, not only left the services of his
vigorous manhood behind the recollection of the great majority of
those who are now engaged in the ever changing hurry of colonial
life, but enfeebled his own perceptions of self-respect, and
called for an indulgence&mdash;not always extended to
him&mdash;which the best of us may well pray may never be
required for ourselves. Few who saw him only in the late years of
his life, would have imagined him the competitor of Donaldson, of
Manning, of the towering and vehement Wentworth, of the acute and
brilliant Lowe. When we remember what he effected, and what he
underwent, something may be conceded even by
enmity&mdash;something forgiven for what appears the pertinacity
of an expiring egotism. Is it wonderful, that when we
persistently discharge our memories of the past services of
public men, they do now and then remember them: if the reminder
sounds like a reproach, whose fault is it but our own?</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the defects of Dr. Lang's emigration
schemes, little vas done to supplement his efforts or remedy
their defects. The total number of immigrants sent out by the
Commissioners, and landed in Brisbane, during the year 1849, was
104. In addition to these, 43 orphan girls, who formed part of a
number shipped to Australia by a philanthropic committee, and
mostly, I believe, from Ireland, were forwarded from Sydney. To
counterbalance these, 306 prisoners were sent to complete their
term of punishment, or, as Lord Grey expressed it, of
probationary reform. It is not surprising that the free residents
began to agitate for the total cessation of transportation, even
though, at the close of the year, I find very bitter discontent
expressed at the scarcity of labour, and the consequent hindrance
to the industries of the district. That discontent was aggravated
by the conduct of the Sydney Government in doling out a miserable
and fractional portion of the Large immigration to New South
Wales since its resumption in 1848. From that time to the middle
of May, fifty-four ships, bringing out 13,601 souls, had arrived,
and of the whole number this district appears to have received
only about 400.</p>
<p>That Earl Grey was resolutely bent on the continuance of
Eastern Australia as a reformatory colony in some shape or other,
I gather from his despatch of September 8, 1848&mdash;published
here in March, 1849&mdash;in which he informed Sir Charles
Fitzroy that the Order in Council, by which New South Wales was
made no longer a place for receiving convicts under sentence for
transportation, would be revoked. As, he wrote, it seemed
improbable that funds would be available from the British
Treasury for the conveyance of a number of free immigrants, equal
to that of the male convicts, he requested the concurrence of the
colonists to the permanent establishment of the proposed system,
irrespective of free immigration; believing that they "would
prefer, to the entire abandonment of the measure proposed,
receiving a moderate number of convicts;" that there would be "no
difficulty in disposing of all the convicts, for whom it is
necessary to provide;" and that it would be of so "much advantage
to the several British colonies, where there is a great demand
for labour, as to induce them gladly to receive all the convicts
that can be sent to them." Having wrought up his convictions to
that pitch, he concluded the despatch by saying, that he should
immediately commence carrying out his plan, and continue to do so
until he received an answer; if that were unfavourable, he should
fall back upon the system of equal immigration. The delusion
under which he seems to have laboured, as to the real feeling of
the colonists, must have been soon dispelled. The inhabitants of
Port Phillip became so violent in their opposition, that the
Governor was induced to promise, that all prison ships sent
there, should be ordered on to Sydney, at which the wrath of the
Sydney population blazed vehemently out. They were not soothed by
Sir Charles Fitzroy's assurance, that should the Legislative
Council decline to concur with Earl Grey in the matter, the new
scheme would be abandoned. A meeting of upwards of 4,000 persons
was held in Sydney, when a strong protest against the renewal of
transportation, supported by Mr. Robert Lowe, was carried
unanimously, as well as resolutions requesting that the first
convict ship&mdash;the <i>Hashemy</i>, just arrived&mdash;should
be at once sent back to London at the Home Government's
expense.</p>
<p>The protest in due time bore fruit&mdash;the resolutions
floated away. The cargo of the <i>Hashemy</i> was discharged, and
fifty-four of her convict passengers were sent to Moreton Bay,
where their arrival was acknowledged by a petition to the Queen
for the abolition of transportation. A sort of grim merriment was
caused by the mixture of economy and discipline exhibited by
another despatch from the Secretary of State, in which it was
ordered that none of the ticket-of-leave holders should receive a
conditional pardon, however apparently exemplary might be their
lives, unless they re-paid the cost of their involuntary passage,
fixed at £20. And when, on November 1, the <i>Mount Stuart
Elphinstone</i> arrived with 225 male supposed candidates for
their purchased pardons, there was fresh food for cynicism
furnished by a new regulation, that employers desirous to get
their services, should engage them on board, whereby the
Government saved the cost of passage from the bay, and of housing
and feeding them the day longer, which, placing them in barracks,
would have involved. Immediately upon the ship's arrival being
notified, a notice was published, calling a meeting of the
residents to consider "the best means of receiving exiles." and
to petition the Government to send out a "fair proportion of free
immigrants;" but under this appeared another advertisement,
entreating the attendance of the inhabitants, that a full
expression of public opinion on the whole subject might be
obtained. A meeting was accordingly held in Brisbane on November
13, when a resolution was proposed, preferring a request to the
Home Government for adequate military and police protection, as
the district was to become a convict colony, and for the "fair"
proportion of free immigrants to be sent as well. On this, an
amendment was moved, embodying a protest against the renewal of
transportation in any form, and carried with scarcely any
dissent. The majority at once prepared for a larger and more
authoritative meeting, which was held four days
afterwards&mdash;when resolutions were unanimously carried
objecting to transportation in any form; protesting against the
unnecessary delays to which immigrants were subjected in the
acquisition of land, and against any scheme which might tend to
discourage the immigration of capital and labour. A memorial, in
an argumentative form, embodying the resolutions, and, in
vigorous language, depicting the unvarying evil conduct of the
recently-arrived convicts, was adopted on the motion of Mr.
Robert Little, a well-known colonist of moderate views (who has
been Crown Solicitor to this colony ever since it became one),
and directed to be forwarded to the Home Government. The close of
the year brought with it an intended consolatory despatch from
Earl Grey, to the effect that, in future, it was the intention of
Her Majesty's Government to send out a number of free immigrants
equal to that of the male convicts shipped to the
colony&mdash;but the residents manifested little joy on this
assurance, qualified as it was by a notification, that the wives
and families of the convicts would be counted as part of the free
emigration. The pro-transportation party, however, mustered at
Ipswich, as a meeting of squatters and other employers of
labour&mdash;but resolutions submitted in favour of convict
immigration were decidedly rejected. Some of the leading
proprietors of stations on the Darling Downs, however,
volunteered a solitary drop of comfort to the Minister, and
memorialised him for the importation of "exiles," assuring him
that from 1,000 to 1,500 could be absorbed; "and by none more
readily" than the memorialists, said to be employers of more than
500 men. They were especially severe upon the new arrivals in Dr.
Lang's ships, who had, in reality, given life and strength to the
opponents of the system sought to be enforced.</p>
<p>The boon of Separation from New South Wales had, indeed, been
insinuated as a sort of sop for the conversion of the district
into a penal colony, or rather of a colony for the reception of
persons supposed to have reached the half-way house to
reformation. It would be idle to attempt to conceal that at
first, to the established men of business and the
large&mdash;employers of labour, the prospect had not its bright
side. "Highly respectable individuals declare," (said the
<i>Courier</i>) "that if Moreton Bay is to be the capital of a
colony, it is immaterial to consider the elements from which the
colony is to be formed; and many persons maintain that some of
the first colonies have arisen from the seeds of criminal
transportation." The tactics of the anti-transportationists, as
we have seen, pledged the district as such against the reception
of convicts; and, so far, a step was gained to the promoters of a
free, as distinguished from a semi-penal, independence. As to the
extended constitution for New South Wales and Victoria, nothing
was done; the bill introduced by Lord John Russell in the House
of Commons being postponed and ultimately abandoned. The measure
was based upon a Report from a Committee of the Privy
Council&mdash;an able and statesmanlike paper&mdash;whose
recommendations, had they been carried into effect, would have
been of the very greatest benefit to all Australia. The citation
of some of them appears so apposite to the discussions which are
now every-day day matters with the self-elected patrons of the
colonies in the old country, and to the philosophic discoveries
of our own local world, that it would be inexcusable to omit the
reference.</p>
<p>In dealing with the functions proposed to be given to what may
be termed the Colonial Legislature, the suggestions as to their
power of altering the local constitutions, or modifying the
reserved monetary appropriations, were precautionary and yet
liberal; but it was in consideration of questions that might
concern all the Australian colonies, that a wise and legislative
spirit was most displayed. After disposing of the minor subjects,
the report went on to deal with the possibility of different
tariffs in different colonies&mdash;a difference even then
existing between South Australia and New South Wales&mdash;which,
as the number of provinces increased, might be supposed to
multiply also; and assuming that such would be the case, it
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"So great indeed would be the evil, and such the
obstruction of the intercolonial trade, and so great the check to
the development of the resources of each of these colonies, that
it seems to us necessary that there should be one tariff common
to them all, so that goods might be carried from the one into the
other with the same absolute freedom as between any two adjacent
counties in England."</blockquote>
<p>Adopting the primary principle involved in this position, the
committee recommended that one of the Australian governors should
be constituted Governor-General of Australia; that he should have
power to convene a body, to be called the General Assembly of
Australia, who should be enabled to legislate in the matters
thereafter enumerated, but that the first meeting should not be
convoked until at least two of the Australian Legislatures had
requested the Governor-General to exercise his powers of
convocation. The Assembly was to consist of delegates elected by
the several Legislatures, and premising that the first
tariff&mdash;an uniform one&mdash;was to be fixed by the Imperial
Parliament, it was to have power to deal with&mdash;(1) the
imputation of duties on imports and exports; (2) postage; (3)
internal communication, roads, railways, etc.; (4) coast lights
and beacons; (5) shipping and harbour dues; (6) the establishment
of a general Supreme Court, either as an original one or of
appeal from the courts of separate colonies; (7) the
determination of jurisdiction and procedure in each Supreme
Court; (8) weights and measures; (9) such other subjects as they
might be asked to consider by address from the Legislatures of
separate colonies; and (10) the appropriation, by equal levy upon
all the colonies, of the sums necessary to carry its enactments
into effect. When Lord John Russell moved the second reading of
the bill, he further proposed to leave to the Assembly the
initiation of the uniform tariff and&mdash;a point of equal
importance&mdash;the regulation of the price of Crown lands. It
is exceedingly to be regretted, that any cause should have
operated to the abandonment of a scheme so comprehensive in
outline, and so just in its general principle. Yet, that regret
may be qualified by the reflection that, had it been adopted,
what trickling rills of wise suggestions would have been dried
up; what volumes of indignant eloquence at their permitted
sterility would have been neither spoken nor thought of. A
metropolis is the grave of small reputations&mdash;equally so is
retrospection the executioner of mediocre originality; and we
need not, therefore, feel so very much surprise that almost all
the best points in multitudinous later schemes for Customs
unions, and federal association, were anticipated more than a
quarter of a century ago. More singular to me is the mean and
stunted dimensions into which&mdash;from what influence I cannot
learn&mdash;the effective measure for conferring constitutions on
these colonies ultimately shrunk.</p>
<p>The transition from tariffs to trade is natural. The first
detailed table of exports that I find, is on April 7, 1849, and
it gives the values for the six months ending March 31 of that
year, as £58,480, of which all but about £500 worth, was pastoral
produce. Among the smaller items was 210 tons of coal, value, £94
10s. For the three months ending June 30, the total export was
£32,651; for the next quarter, £14,281, and for the last quarter
of 1849, £34,888&mdash;the whole for fifteen months being
£140,103. The estimate of the applicants for a branch bank was
more than confirmed by the results of the year's industry. The
stock in the district was estimated to have increased during the
year 1848, by 1,069 horses, 27,768 cattle, and 410,874
sheep&mdash;cattle, 58 per cent., and sheep, 62. In other
industries I am unable to rind any success. Mr. Bowden's efforts
at the establishment of a sugar company, met with a good deal of
expressed, but hardly the shadow of any practical, sympathy,
although the capital required was fixed at the modest sum of
£3,000, to be subscribed in two or three years; and partial
ordinary cultivation was promised to assure the shareholders from
loss. On trying Sydney, he met with a little better reception at
first, but the ultimate result was the same, and in his letter
announcing his failure, he complained bitterly of the apathy with
which his exertions had been encountered. Some canes, obtained at
Tahiti, were distributed, but nothing practical followed from the
growth of the few planted. The cultivation of cotton was
discussed with some energy, and estimates were given of great
profits to be realised, and the readers having congratulated
themselves on the promising aspect of the industry, left others
to realise it. A company for running steamboats on the Brisbane
was announced, and there seems to have died out; but the
enterprise of two residents, Messrs. Reid and Boyland, was shown
in the employment of Mr. Winship in the construction of the
<i>Hawk</i>, a steamer of seventy tons burden, which ran for many
years with varying success. "Awfully short of cash," according to
the local journal, was the great complaint. It is, therefore,
creditable to the people that local subscriptions were entered
into for the building of a Presbyterian Church, the Rev. C.
Stewart, who had arrived in the <i>Chasely</i>, taking an active
part in promoting the design. The Brisbane School of Arts was
also started on September 24 of this year, and the first
discussion opened on October 11, following. There was much
advance in interior settlement, as distinguished from mere
occupation. Although Drayton was proclaimed a township in the
same month, and vague rumours came of fine pastoral country
behind Port Curtis, wistful glances were now and then thrown
towards the slopes of the Dividing Range, and even northwards,
where gold was supposed to await the miner, but no one seemed
inclined to face the dangers of the search. The fate of poor
Kennedy had thrown great discouragement on exploration.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who was an assistant surveyor under the New South
Wales Government, and, although a young man of moderate
experience, had distinguished himself under Sir Thomas Mitchell,
and, as we have seen in verifying that officer's discoveries, was
landed at Rockingham Bay on May 24, 1848, with instructions to
penetrate thence to Albany Island, off Cape York, where he was to
be met by a schooner from Sydney, with supplies. He was then to
make his way back on the western side of the peninsula, and
return to Sydney. The probable obstacles seem to have been
overlooked, and some of the men sent with him&mdash;eleven, and
an aboriginal named "Jacky Jacky"&mdash;were utterly unfit for
such an enterprise; one was nearly an idiot, and another (the
storekeeper), a vagabond and a thief. The country was
mountainous, and for the most part, covered with dense scrub, and
the blacks numerous and savage. From their starting from the
landing place, to November 10, they travelled painfully and
wearily over 450 miles of the country I have characterised, when
they reached the neighbourhood of Weymouth Bay, having been
compelled to leave their carts and a portion of their stores
behind them. During the whole of this journey they were harassed
by the natives, and, towards its end, suffered sorely from both
hunger and thirst, and yet were compelled to cut great part of
their way through dense scrubs. On reaching Weymouth Bay (in
latitude about 13° 40'), Kennedy determined to push on the
remaining 150 miles to Cape York with three men and the
aboriginal, leaving his second&mdash;Mr. Canon&mdash;with the
remaining seven, to "spell" at the camp. The miseries he endured
on this journey, up to the time of his death, were, as narrated
by Jacky Jacky, extreme. About three weeks after leaving Weymouth
Bay, one of his party accidentally shot himself near Shelbourne
Bay, and Kennedy decided to leave him with the other two men,
both in a state of considerable weakness, while he travelled, as
rapidly as possible, over the remaining eighty or ninety miles to
meet the schooner, and bring her back to take them on board. He
took Jacky Jacky with him. On the evening of the seventh day from
leaving them, and having reached a point near Escape River, at
which they could see Albany, their destination, they were
surrounded by natives, who had tracked them on their journey.
Kennedy, who was exhausted by hunger and fatigue, had been left
for a few seconds by Jacky Jacky, who was intent on getting at
the back of the tribe, to scare them with his gun, but, before he
could accomplish what he intended, the unfortunate explorer was
pierced by three spears, and his watch and other articles taken
from him. Jacky cut out the weapons and carried him into the
scrub, where, faint and dying, he asked for paper and pencil that
he might scrawl a few lines to the captain of the schooner, and,
in the effort to use them, fell back into his companion's arms
and expired. Jacky Jacky stayed, stupified with grief, for about
an hour, "until I got well," and then buried the body, with the
rude means he had&mdash;digging the earth with his tomahawk, and
covering it with logs, his own shirt and trousers, and earth and
leaves. Then, starting in the dark, and often driven to conceal
himself in the creeks he waded along, he, after thirteen days,
reached Albany in a wretched plight, and was taken on board the
<i>Ariel</i>, schooner, lying there expecting the traveller. The
schooner set sail for Shelbourne Bay, but on arrival there, the
seamen refused to attempt the rescue of the three men left;
little doubt, however, exists as to their fate, the blacks being
seen with part of their clothing. The trousers in which Jacky
Jacky had buried his master were found in a canoe. The
<i>Ariel</i> then went on to Weymouth Bay, near where, after
reaching the camp at the hazard of their lives, Captain Dobson,
Dr. Vallagh, a seaman named Barrett, and Jacky Jacky, found Mr.
Canon and one companion named Goddard, mere skeletons, from
starvation and anxiety, sole survivors of the party. The rest had
one by one sunk under their sufferings. All that was gained by so
much misery and sacrifice of life, was the confirmation of what
had been before supposed&mdash;the impracticable nature of the
country, and a verbose panegyric on the survivors in the
<i>Government Gazette</i>. It is questionable how much the
passion for exploration may outrun necessity, or a just regard
for even common humanity. Leichhardt, Kennedy, Cunningham, remind
us of the cost of its indulgence.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">I have</span> so far endeavoured to narrate,
with, perhaps, greater minuteness than their apparent importance
would demand, the incidents which may be said to have decided for
a long time the character of the district; but because they did
so decide it I was thus minute. What followed up to the discovery
of gold in New South Wales, and subsequently in Victoria, was
what might have been anticipated in the history of such a
settlement. The immigration during the year 1850 was small. In
January "fifty orphans and thirty other immigrants" were sent
from Sydney, and in March ten more females. In August, the
<i>Emigrant</i>, to which vessel I have before referred, arrived
direct from England, having on board, when she left Plymouth, 272
souls, bringing with her typhus fever, of which sixty-four cases
had occurred since May 12. These are all of which I have found
record. It transpired, however, that some of the leading
squatters had not been idle, on a recent visit to London, in
representing to the Home Government the difficulties which the
want of labour interposed in the way of industrial progress, and
in strengthening Earl Grey's hands by applications for the
shipment of "exiles," a course which, however distasteful it
might have been to the majority in 1850, was certainly not at
variance with the current of public opinion as it ran in 1848.
They and their friends may therefore be supposed to have been not
ungratified by the arrival of the Bangalore, in May, with 292
convicts and 104 free meet, women, and children, including the
guard of twenty-nine pensioners, their wives and relatives, and
some of those of previous probationers. Of the reforming
passengers, it is written "with few exceptions there was much
less sorrow and repentance for past offences than was more to
seize future opportunities of repeating them." Forty-five were
shipped to Wide Bay, in nowise to their discontent, there being
no constables there. Having thus incurred the necessity for
increased protection, the Secretary of State directed the removal
of the small military force then in the district, to the great
dissatisfaction of the residents, who memorialised the New South
Wales Government against the step, but without effect. On the
general question of transportation, resolutions condemnatory of
the system were carried in the Legislative Council, early in
October, the then Attorney-General&mdash;the late Mr.
Plunkett&mdash;making a vigorous speech in their favour. Dr.
Lang, who had returned to New South Wales, and been elected for
Sydney, had the satisfaction of voting in the majority.</p>
<p>The Separation Question gradually strengthened, and began to
occupy the leading columns of the newspapers; and the
intelligence, that a clause had been embodied in the new
Constitution Bill, authorising the Queen to create a new colony
northward of the 30th degree of south latitude, which would have
included the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, served to
quicken the attention of the residents to the subject. At a
meeting of the reading squatters, at Drayton, it was recommended,
amongst other things, that accounts of the revenue and
expenditure in the district should be moved for in the
Legislative Council, and that an effort should be made to secure
direct shipment of produce to England, instead of by way of
Sydney. But when the resignation by Colonel Snodgrass of his seat
in the Legislative Council necessitated an election, there was
little energy displayed in the gloved contest that ensued. The
one point looked to was Separation, and as a means towards it,
the securing a due share of representation in any new Council
when the electoral districts were extended. Not one-third of the
electors recorded their votes, but sufficient were polled to
return Mr. Robert Jones, a resident of Brisbane, in opposition to
Mr. Robert Campbell, of Sydney. While the election was still
pending, a public meeting was held at Brisbane to adopt a
petition to the Queen, praying for Separation, at which it
appeared plainly enough that, however strongly the feeling in
favour of that object might be, it was not sufficiently so to
induce any lasting compromise between the friends and opponents
of the reception of prisoners. The petition made no reference to
that question, and was adopted by a large majority; but both
sides were preparing for a vigorous struggle. Mr. Lyon, who had
always defended the introduction of "exiles" as necessary for the
supply of labour, had been assisted by the great employers, and
those whom they could influence, to the establishment of a second
newspaper to advocate their own views. His connection with the
<i>Moreton Bay Free Press</i>, as it was called, seems to have
been short, and a succession of editors followed one another,
equally zealous in the same cause.* The whole question was soon
debated with no small virulence, both by the journals and the two
sections into which the public were divided.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I may mention here, that the <i>Free Press</i>
was continued up to the time of Separation, and during the period
of its existence, is said to have displayed in its leading
columns, ability of no ordinary kind, At that time, I believe,
Mr. Watts, afterwards for some mouths editor of the Melbourne
<i>Argus</i>, was connected with the <i>Press</i> in a similar
capacity. I regret, that having male diligent search, I have not
been able to find a single copy of the <i>Free Press</i> in the
colony&mdash;a fact, however, not to be taken in derogation of
its value. Few colonial newspapers seem to be looked upon with
any very affectionate regard except by their own proprietors. I
doubt if I should have been able to find a file of the
<i>Courier</i>, but for the conservative forethought of it, first
published, Mr. Swan.]</p>
<p>Along with this the probable form of the new Australian
constitution was discussed with some keenness. In opening the
Legislative Council on June 4, the Governor informed them, that
it was the intention of the Home Government to press the proposed
measure through Parliament; and a bill, based in great measure
upon the report I have described in the preceding chapter, was
early in the session once more brought in by Lord John Russell.
In the course of its passage it suffered cruel curtailment, and
some able English statesmen protested energetically against the
emasculated product, Mr. Roebuck deriving consolation from the
"hope, that when the bill arrived in the colony, it would create
such a degree of discontent, that Parliament would be obliged to
reconsider the whole subject"&mdash;a hope in the nature of a
prophecy, and one of which its author soon saw the
fulfilment.</p>
<p>The Act in its final shape provided for the separation of the
district of Port Phillip from New South Wales, and its erection
into the colony of Victoria. As respected New South Wales, it
continued a Legislative Council, one third being nominees of the
Crown. It lowered the minimum franchise, which had been the £20
householder, to one of £10, and extended the right of voting to
the squatters (described by Lord John Russell as a wealthy and
most respectable body) in virtue of their leases. After
provisions respecting the Australian Colonies generally, not
necessary to be here noticed, it conferred on the Legislature of
New South Wales the power of creating new electoral districts and
increasing the numbers of the members, providing, however, that
the relative proportions of nominated and elected members should
be preserved. The Council were to impose taxes, and direct
appropriation, but a civil list of £72,000 was reserved from
their control, and the management and sale of the Crown lands,
and their revenues were still retained by the Crown; while the
provision for the payment of the police by assessment was
abolished, and the cost directed to be defrayed out of the
general revenue. What was of infinitely greater importance, the
Act left the construction of new constitutions, whenever any of
the colonies grew tired of that now given them, with their own
legislatures, subject to approval by the Imperial Parliament; and
it provided, as I have said, for separation by the Queen in
Council, of any territory lying northward of the 30th degree of
south Latitude from New South Wales, conditionally upon the
petition for such a severance from the resident householders of
the territory. So far as it went, it was a step in advance; but
in entrusting to each of the local legislatures the power of
forming a constitution for its own colony, it afforded
encouragement to that notion of diverse conditions and interests
which has worked so much mischief throughout Australia. Had the
suggestions of the committee of the Privy Council been carried
out in their entirety, there might at this day have been a united
Australia, instead of a collection of disputatious and jealous
communities, with their different tariffs, their conflicting
legislation, and their apparent incapacity of acting in concert
for any purpose tending towards the common welfare. Such as it
was, however, it was to be acted upon. The principal anxiety of
the Moreton Bay people, was to secure a just proportion of power
in the new electoral distribution, and they awaited the meeting
of the Legislative Council, by whom the adjustment was to be
made, with some anxiety.</p>
<p>The Act did not arrive in time for the Council to carry out
its provisions during the year, but while it did sit some motions
were adopted, in which the district was more or less interested.
In September, Mr. Donaldson obtained a committee to inquire into
the expediency of establishing steam mail communication with
Europe by way of Singapore, which, as I find no further trace of
it, must have lapsed by the prorogation. It is worth noting, as
showing how strongly the idea of northern colonization and
connection with the East was impressed upon the colonial mind
before the goldfields drove every other topic from public
attention&mdash;an idea which found further expression in the
confidence repeatedly shown in the annexation and colonization of
New Guinea. Some further matters, mostly of temporary interest,
were mooted by the same gentleman, who seems to have acted for
the then retiring local member, incapacitated by age and
infirmity, and some returns were obtained bearing upon the
Separation Question. The Moreton Bay people were very sanguine as
to the early erection of the district into a separate colony, and
began to dispute as to whom the principal merit of bringing about
such a consummation was due, and as to the form it should assume.
They did not imagine that they would have nine years delay in
which they might have time to arrive at conclusions on both
points.</p>
<p>But in one thing the residents had occasion to congratulate
themselves. On February 12, in this year, a notice appeared in
the <i>Gazette</i>, of the establishment of a circuit of the
Supreme Court for Moreton Bay; and on the 13th of the following
May, it was opened by the late Mr. Justice Therry, in the chapel
of the old convict barracks. There could have been little of
dignity in the room or its surroundings, but the judge addressed
a preliminary charge which made a great impression at the time,
and was afterwards reprinted and published. He rapidly traced the
progress of the district, and then went on to point out very
lucidly, the principles which should guide jurors and witnesses
in the discharge of their obligations. One illustration which he
gave of the evils that may follow from the negligence or
incapacity of a witness, appears worthy of preservation, and I
append it in a note.* And it is a fact, more suggestive than
remarkable, that after twenty-three years of experience in the
criminal practice of the Courts, he gave it as his deliberate
judgment, that in the colonies emphatically intoxication was the
hot bed of crime; "directly or indirectly, all crime is traceable
to it&mdash;the exceptions being so few as to establish the
general rule." It was a significant comment on the habits of the
times amongst the classes usually most productive of criminals,
that there were none but criminal cases for trial at the sitting.
One was of two men for a murder in the Wide Bay District. They
were both convicted, and executed on the 8th of July following,
protesting their innocence up to the last moment. Only four
executions had previously occurred in Moreton Bay&mdash;one, of
two natives for aiding in the murder of Mr. Stapleton, the
surveyor&mdash;who were hanged at the old windmill; and the
second, of two convicts, who suffered death behind the barracks,
for the murder of two fellow prisoners. These were in the penal
times; but after them and prior to the establishment of the
Circuit Court, offenders were tried at Sydney, and the gaol there
was the place of execution, from which, on this occasion, the
executioner's apparatus had to be procured.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "About the year 1835. when I happened to hold
the office of Assistant Crown Prosecutor, it was allotted to sue
to conduct a prosecution against several persons, servants on an
estate near Berrima, charged with the murder of a man in the same
employment. The trial lasted the whole day, and the evidence
variously affected the prisoners; but there was one of
them&mdash;John Lynch, on whom it had fixed a more prominent part
in the perpetration of the deed than the others. Towards the
close of the trial a very material witness, and one who was to
have proved that Lynch had been seen on the day of the murder
within a short distance of the spot on which an attempt had been
made to consume the body by fire, and on other points, to bring
guilt completely home to him, appeared in the witness box in such
a state of intemperance, that his testimony was valueless. Owing
to that incident I attributed&mdash;and did not hesitate at the
time to avow it&mdash;the prosecution failed, and Lynch, with the
others, was acquitted. The presiding judge (the present Sir
William Burton) most deservedly imposed a fine of £50 on the
delinquent witness, who was the overseer of the estate, on which
the prisoners were convicts. This occurred in 1835, and six years
afterwards, during the absence of the present respected
Attorney-General in England, his office devolved on me, and it
became my duty at the Berrima assizes of that year, to prosecute
this same Lynch for a murder perpetrated under circumstances of
great enormity. For that murder he was tried, convicted, and
executed. But the worst respecting him remains to be told. In the
interval between his acquittal in 1835, and his conviction in
1842, he committed nine distinct murders, making the sum of Iris
terrible guilt to amount to eleven murders, to which he confessed
previous to his execution; and in this admitted catalogue of his
crimes, he acknowledged that the murder of his fellow servant on
the estate near Berrima, was one in which he had a principal
share. To all the greater guilt to deeds so horrible, these deeds
were perpetrated under circumstances of atrocity to which, from
his own narrative taken down from his lips, which I have read,
the records of crime in this or any other country, furnish no
parallel. A memorable and dreadful example of the calamity that
may befal a community when a man, charged with a serious crime,
of which he is guilty, is tried and acquitted, and let loose
again upon society&mdash;a far inure dangerous pest than
before&mdash;emboldened by impunity with fresh desperation and
augmented hardihood to enter anew upon a career of crime, and
calculating upon the difficulty of the proof of guilt, of which
his experience of the ordeal through which he has lately passed,
inspires a natural assurance."&mdash;<i>Charge of Mr. Justice
Therry, at the opening of the Moreton Bay Circuit of the Supreme
Court, May 23, 1859</i>.]</p>
<p>Another and somewhat remarkable trial, was that of three
soldiers of the 11th regiment of the line (a detachment of which
was quartered here at the time), for wounding a native. A false
alarm was given one night that the blacks were spearing cattle
close to Brisbane, and rumour and fright, as usual, exaggerating
the danger, the military were called out, and marched in pursuit,
the officer in command directing his men not to fire without
orders. When they came to the place where the blacks were camped,
they found no signs of marauding, but there seems to have been
same unnecessary outcry, on which three or four hasty shots were
fired, and some of the natives hurt, and with this offence the
men were charged. One of them was found guilty, and sentenced to
six months' imprisonment. Some blame appears to have attached to
the police, and the chief constable was dismissed: I mention the
matter simply as showing that justice was not invariably withheld
in the case of wrong done to the aborigines.</p>
<p>Out of one of the minor trials arose a point as to the
legality of the "calabashes," which I have before described. Two
orders for insignificant amounts had been stolen, whereupon the
question of value was started, the indictment having been so
framed as to charge the accused with the theft of property of
value equal to the amount which the orders nominally represented.
The judge was of opinion, that the documents being illegal under
the Act forbidding the making of notes or bills for amounts under
twenty shillings&mdash;the prisoner might be acquitted, but
reserved the point: the Attorney-General thought the makers of
all such orders liable to prosecution. At the final judgment of
the full court, in the following July, the orders were declared
to be valueless&mdash;whether their issue was criminal, the
judges declined to say, that question not being before them. The
Act (5 Geo. IV., No. 1) then in force, imposed a penalty of not
less than £5 or more than £10 upon the maker for every order or
note he might issue. Nevertheless they continued to be made long
after the time I am now referring to, and, in fact, in the
interior, formed almost all the small currency of the country.
The old adage, that necessity has no law, may be supposed to be
thus illustrated.</p>
<p>One practical result from this trial, was an increased desire
for the facilities and protection afforded by a bank. A request
to the Bank of Australasia for the establishment of a branch, was
courteously acknowledged, and promised to be laid before the
directors, but before their reply could be obtained, the Bank of
New South Wales cheered the hearts of the residents by opening a
branch in Brisbane, on November 14, and have since had no reason
to regret the step thus taken; the trade of the district, indeed,
justified it. Comparing the exports from Moreton Bay for the year
1830, with those of the preceding year, they exhibited a very
satisfactory increase&mdash;that on the last quarter of the year
being £15,033 over the amount of the corresponding quarter in
1849, the year showing a total of £149,819. A very curious
coincidence of figures occurs in the comparison&mdash;the advance
in the year over its predecessor being exactly the same as that
of the last quarter of 1850 over the last quarter of 1849. The
export was, as beforetime, almost wholly confined to pastoral
produce. In other industries there was some talk, but not much
real progress. I notice that a bale of cotton was shipped from
Sydney in January by Mr. Stuart A. Donaldson, and the news of
this seems to have somewhat stimulated the Moreton Bay people.
That the plant would grow was established clearly enough, and
much industry was evinced in calculations to prove that it might
be cultivated profitably. The estimates varied, but gave as a
tolerably certain permanent return about £15 per acre. The few
samples which had reached the old country, had been highly spoken
of, and Mr. Donaldson, who took considerable interest in the
experiment, procured seed from America, and sent a small quantity
for distribution among the settlers of Moreton Bay. Dr. Lang had,
I believe, preceded him in rendering, that kind of assistance.
There was plenty of hope, not much enterprise, and, as usual, a
great deal of doubt, latent if not expressed.</p>
<p>In its social progress the district kept steadily on. In
Brisbane, the School of Arts had so far advanced that plans for a
new building were called for&mdash;lectures and entertainments of
various kinds showing the spirit of its supporters. The Roman
Catholic Church was finished; the Anglican Church commenced; and
other religious denominations began to house themselves. The
hospital was well managed, and appreciated as a valuable
institution. A new Custom House, which still forms part of the
modest looking structure which shrinks from notice in the hollow
between Queen Street and the river near Petrie's Bight, was
built; and the people began then to grumble at the deficient
supply of pure water.. The education question, even in those
early days, supplied topic of debate, and lectures were delivered
by the advocates of the then rival systems, "denominational" and
"national," the more cosmopolitan comprehensiveness of the
"secular" not having been yet attained to. But in the fervour of
their intellectual dissipation, the residents showed that they
retained "a frugal mind," and established a building society; and
they, moreover, had the advantage of an extension of legal
blessings in the shape of the establishment of a branch of the
Insolvent Court, the Police Magistrate acting as local
Commissioner. In the interior, and towards the north, the process
of settlement was quietly carried on, and Government sales were
held at Ipswich, Drayton, and Warwick, of the lands in their
respective vicinities. A township was established, at least in
name, at Cleveland; and clerks of petty session were appointed
for the districts of Wide Bay, and the Maranoa, and at Gayndah.
Wide Bay was gradually creeping into some importance as an outlet
for the pastoral districts of the same name and for the Burnett,
and some impatience was manifested for the survey of a township
and the sale of allotments.</p>
<p>The great trouble of the residents&mdash;especially in the
interior&mdash;was the blacks; and the native police&mdash;a
force of natives who have undergone a certain amount of training
for the purpose, and are officered by Europeans&mdash;were in
pretty constant requisition. At Mr. Dangar's station, on the
Condamine, a concerted attack was made, the hut-keeper killed,
and damage inflicted to the extent of £250 in value. The whole
district was described by the Commandant of the Police as in a
most disturbed state, several stations having been abandoned and
twelve men killed. The condition of the frontier was, in fact,
one of war, and we read of set encounters between the police and
the aborigines, much as of those between the troops and the
Basutos in the Cape Colony. Mr. Frederick Walker, the then
Commandant, writes:&mdash;"I am convinced, that if properly
officered by white persons, the natives of the colony would make
as good troops as the natives of India. I know that as long as
their officers stood none of the Native Police would stir." He
had little difficulty in establishing a more quiet state of
things than he found&mdash;though at what cost I see no record
of&mdash;and established his head quarters at Callandoon, on the
Macintyre River. But from the Wide Bay and Burnett, there arose
wailing and protest. Sheep were driven off, and shepherds
murdered, [missing ~nine indecipherable words], some of the sheep
were recovered, and the blacks were reported as, under their
vigorous regime, becoming "more tractable:" there needs no
interpreter to explain what that means. Farther north, an
adventurous traveller appears to have taken advantage of this
ameliorated condition. A Mr. G. Francis, then recently from Port
Phillip, reached a distance of about ninety miles north of the
Burnett fiver, and seems to have discovered the Fitzroy.</p>
<p>There was grievance, too, in the higher walks of civilization.
A New South Wales Postal Act had imposed a charge of one penny
for the carriage of a newspaper, at which the wrath of the press
was excited. But the proprietor of the <i>Courier</i> derived
consolation from an unusual source. He informed his subscribers
that, "as some inducement to them to pay up their accounts before
they become deeply stricken in years, the postage will be
deducted from all accounts with this journal that are not
suffered to run more than six months"&mdash;which suggests a
halcyon period when credit and impecuniosity were twins. The
editor fell foul of the authorities because, although £35 had
been voted for the salary of a letter carrier, none had been
appointed&mdash;to the great discomfort of the mercantile and
trading community; and protest and representation were suggested.
In due time the required official was appointed, and a ray of
peace shone upon the editorial and mercantile mind.</p>
<p>The year 1851 commenced in heat, meteorologically and
politically: the thermometer on New Year's Day stood at 101°
within doors; and the friends and opponents of convict labour
took up their respective sides in undisguised hostility. A
meeting of stockholders and others in favour of separation with
"exiles," was called for January 11; and the notice was
immediately followed by another from the opposite party, for a
second or rather contemporaneous meeting, to protest against such
an accompaniment of the main object. The followers of each were
numerous, and I confess that I find some names on the list of the
advocates of "exile" labour, which I should almost as readily
expect at the present day, to see in a committee for the
introduction of Kanakas. These went to work in a business-like
way; formed themselves at their meeting into what they termed the
Moreton Bay and Northern Districts Separation Association:
adopted a petition to the Queen in furtherance of their object;
and resolved upon a canvass of the district, to raise
subscriptions towards the expenses they incurred. But,
prohibiting all dissent from their resolutions, and refusing
admission at their meeting to any one opposed to their views,
they gave a colouring to their procedure which it would have
shown better tactics to have avoided. "The high price and extreme
scarcity of labour," was the burden of their cry. Their opponents
assembled in public meeting, and adopted a petition in which,
setting forth the claims and prospects of the districts, they
"humbly but solemnly protest against the resumption of
transportation in any form, or upon any condition whatever." In
this course they were stimulated and encouraged by the success
with which the Victorians were combating against what they
considered a great evil. But the advocates of forced labour were
united and persevering. While a new Electoral Bill was passing
through the Legislative Council, which met early in April, they
were canvassing and collecting, and preparing for an election
campaign. When that bill was laid on the table, it appeared that
the Council was to consist of forty-eight members, sixteen of
whom were to be nominees of the Crown. Three members were to be
given to the Moreton Bay districts; one to the County Stanley;
one for the united districts of Clarence and Darling Downs; and
one for the united districts of Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett, and
Maranoa. As the bill passed through the House, additions were
made, bringing up the total number of elective members to
thirty-six; and Moreton Bay secured one of these for an
electorate called the Stanley Boroughs, comprising North and
South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, and Ipswich&mdash;an addition
opposed oddly enough by Dr. Lang, on the supposition that it
would give another member to the squatting party in the House.
And it is curious to read how not the bases of electoral
right&mdash;whether of population or of property&mdash;were
considered in the discussion, but simply the use that might be
made of it if granted. That the boroughs were constituted an
electorate only made the exile separationists more eager; and, on
May 17&mdash;less than a month after the passage of the electoral
bill&mdash;the Northern Districts Association held another
meeting in Brisbane, at which they passed a resolution affirming
that the majority of the people concurred in their views, and
appointed two delegates&mdash;the Hon. Louis Hope and Mr. Colin
Mackenzie&mdash;to wait upon Earl Grey with copies of the
resolutions adopted. Mr. A. Hodgson, who had taken an active part
in the formation and advocacy of the association, with
considerable energy avowed his attachment to, and interest in,
the district which was his home; and soon after, with some
complacency, published a letter from Earl Grey, in reality a
reply to one addressed to the Earl by that gentleman, his
lordship suggesting, that if the Legislature of New South Wales
proved obdurate, the district residents could apply for
separation, and so get the labour of which they stood in need.
But some of the electors of the Stanley Boroughs thought
otherwise, and, at a public meeting, unanimously nominated Mr. R.
Jones, who had been member for the former county, as their
candidate, he being distinctly pledged as a strong
anti-transportationist. The association put forward Mr. Hughes,
of Gowrie&mdash;a station on the Darling Downs&mdash;in
opposition to Mr. Jones, and Mr. W. Wilson, of the Peak Mountain
Station, as their nominee for the county. This was followed up by
a meeting at Ipswich, at which resolutions in favour of both
gentlemen were carried. To meet Mr. Wilson, Mr. John Richardson,
a merchant of Brisbane, was induced to enter the field. In the
Darling Downs and Wide Bay electorates, it was known that there
would be no contest&mdash;the purely pastoral character of the
district, and the small number of votes, leaving the choice in
fact in the hands of the station proprietors. Dr. Lang, in a
letter addressed to the residents in Moreton Bay, suggested, that
practically, the discovery of the goldfields had destroyed all
prospect of any portion of Eastern or Southern Australia becoming
in any shape a convict colony, and that separation was the
principal object for which to fight; but the people thought that
they could appreciate the work to be done, and declined to
abandon either of the grounds on which they had based their
selection of members. There is no doubt, that the abandonment of
the pro-transportation party by Mr. Wentworth, and the weight
thrown by his great ability and high reputation into the opposite
scale, was no small encouragement to them in their course,
although the discovery of gold was alleged by him as the sole
ground for his change of opinion. A powerful argument was
afforded them by a notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, that
no less than a hundred and thirty-seven ticket-of-leave holders,
in Moreton Bay, had had their tickets cancelled, for absence from
their allotted districts, a fact which spoke volumes, both as to
the value and certainty of the labour, which the system contended
for, was likely to supply. Both sides put forward their utmost
strength, and the result was that, at the election in September,
Mr. Jones and Mr. Richardson were both elected. Whether or not,
it was from a conviction that the transportation cause had become
hopeless, that the other two members&mdash;Messrs. Bigge and
Leslie&mdash;remained quietly at home, I cannot say, but their
two colleagues formed part of a majority which, in the new
Legislative Council of New South Wales, passed strong resolutions
against "the continuance of transportation, in any form whatever,
to any of Her Majesty's Australasian possessions." Before this,
the Order-in-Council for its revival had been revoked by the Home
Government; but, in November, a despatch was received from Earl
Grey, in reply to the petitions of the stockholders, which I have
before described, in which his lordship referred to the
impossibility of the Home Government acting in such a matter, in
opposition to the wishes expressed by the local Legislature, and
almost despairingly suggested that if the&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Legislature, which must be regarded as authorised to
express the wishes of the community it represents, should think
it right to reconsider the opinion it has declared, and to
request that convicts should again be sent, in limited numbers,
to the above-mentioned district only, I am not aware of any
reason why this should not be done."&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>Seed thrown by a skilful hand, but on barren ground.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang, who had during the year, involved himself in
proceedings for libel by some ill-advised remarks upon the
supposed conduct of a member of the old Legislative Council, who
had concurred in a vote of censure on himself for his procedure
in his immigration scheme, and been visited with fine and
imprisonment, as a consequent punishment, emerged from his
confinement to be placed, at the general election, at the head of
the poll as one of the three members for the City of Sydney. It
was not long before he visited the Moreton Bay District, where
his first political step was to deliver a characteristic lecture
on separation, proposing that the northern boundary of the colony
should be kept at the Tropic of Capricorn; * the southern one
remaining, as it was understood it would be, at the 30th parallel
of south latitude. A public meeting was held at Brisbane, a few
days afterwards, when a temperate and argumentative petition for
separation was adopted, and Dr. Lang was requested to take charge
of it, and to act as delegate on behalf of the district. A set of
resolutions, affirming practicability of the profitable growth of
cotton at Moreton Bay, and recommending a scheme of immigration
on the same plan as that employed by Dr. Lang, was carried
without dissent, and committed to his care to lay before the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce, and such other parties in Great Britain as might be
likely to aid in carrying out the system proposed. The doctor
then addressed the meeting, and is recorded to have met with
unanimous applause, both at the commencement and conclusion of
his speech. At Ipswich, the proceedings took a more business-like
shape. The petition adopted by the Brisbane people was somewhat
altered, on the motion of Mr. Macalister, then emerging into
public life, so as to ask specifically for semi-representative
institutions analogous to those of New South Wales. The thanks of
the meeting were voted to the doctor for his past efforts, and
about £100 subscribed towards the expenses of his journey to
England. It was understood that he declined further pecuniary
connection with emigration schemes, the last one having, as he
reiterated&mdash;and he was not contradicted&mdash;involved him
in heavy monetary loss; and he returned to Sydney, sanguine of
being able to influence a large and continuous stream of
immigration to the district for the cultivation of cotton, and
the planting a new industrial colony, prosperous in itself, and a
source of prosperity to the empire of which it formed a part.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This was on the assumption, that the Clarence
and Richmond Rivers districts were included in the colony, whose
coast line would then have been less than 500 miles.]</p>
<p>But the discovery of gold, to which I have before incidentally
referred, not only did more than any other circumstance or agency
could have effected in terminating transportation to the eastern
and southern Australian: Colonies, but exerted an effect scarcely
dreamed of by Dr. Lang and his friends at the time: it, so to
speak, snuffed out the claims of the non-auriferous colonies in
the eyes of the emigrating British public, who rushed with one
accord to those where the precious metal was to be found. The
Eagle, steamer, brought the news of Hargreaves' discovery on May
23, and "it seemed," (says the <i>Courier</i>). "to have made the
Sydney people half mad, which only shows how excitable they are."
In another week, there were symptoms of the lunacy having
extended when the news was confirmed, and the extent and value of
the discovery found to be beyond all expectations. It was
remembered that the Dividing or "Main" Range, as it was called,
was a continuation of that near which the gold had been found at
Bathurst, and exploration was forthwith exhorted, while
speculation was rife and hope strong, as to the investment of
fortunate diggers from the south of their new capital and
remaining energies in a field so favourable as the northern
districts for all industrial enterprises. There was some present
drawback to these pleasurable imaginings, in the immediate rise
in the prices of flour and bread, whereby the bakers fell on
troublous times, and combinations to import for private use were
threatened and not formed. The labouring portion of the community
spoke of an increased wage, on the unreasonableness of which,
they were lectured, both orally and in leading articles, but to
no purpose. The fever was not allayed by the continuous tidings
of new "finds," which crowded the columns of the journals; and I
notice that sixty-six steerage passengers left Moreton Bay, for
Sydney, on June 19. A party was formed in Ipswich to prospect the
range at once&mdash;a judicious step if the condition of the town
were as forlorn as described. "Business is at a complete
stand-still" (writes a correspondent): "the auctioneer's bell is
often heard, but it is perfect labour in vain. Not a single buyer
can be found, for <i>all</i> are sellers." [The italics are not
mine.] The discoveries of gold are daily increasing" (wrote the
<i>Bathurst Free Press</i>); and one consequence was, that in
Sydney, great distress arose among the wives and families of
absent diggers, on which the <i>Herald</i> is reported in the
<i>Courier</i> of June 26, to have advocated an Act of Council
"to compel those worthless men to return to their families."
They, who, in Moreton Bay, were, in their own Language, "firmly
impressed with the opinion, that the goldfield of New South Wales
extends to the districts of Stanley and Darling. Downs," gave
expression to it in the shape of promised subscriptions, to the
extent of about £900, towards a reward to be paid to the finder
of a field equal to that of Bathurst. Then came news that Sydney
had become dull at a temporary cessation of mining activity; and
in another fortnight, that the people of Bathurst were wild with
delight at new discoveries, in which the find of a hundred weight
of gold by one fortunate prospector, stood prominently out. The
excitement here rose high, at the end of July, at intelligence
that the Government had received information of the finding of
gold on the Darling Downs, and that the <i>Herald</i> reported
"that there was no doubt of a goldfield being discovered in that
locality." Men went to bed at night dreaming of glittering sands
and nuggetty ravines, and rose in the morning to calculate their
possible gains if those dreams were realised. We sometimes go
afar to learn news of home, and the Moreton Bay people were
edified in August by what was news to them, that a fine specimen
of auriferous quartz, sent from their district, had reached
Sydney. The <i>Courier</i> of the 9th of that month was radiant
with "finds." A specimen had been brought in from a spot near
Brisbane&mdash;possibly one of the gullies running easterly from
Taylor's Range. Another was affirmed to have been picked up on
the banks of the river, at a place to which, being easy of
access, a miscellaneous "rush" on a small scale, took place, with
an odd assortment of digging tools, which included a colander and
a baby's cradle, but nothing was found. What looked more serious
was information&mdash;apparently authoritative&mdash;that gold
had been found on Canning Downs, and specimens sent to the late
Rev. W. B. Clarke, the celebrated geologist, and that the finder
intended to claim the reward. To wind up the week, the discoverer
of the quartz turned up, and declared himself to be sanguine that
there was more where that came from. A Government surveyor found
gold at Thanes Creek, on the Darling Downs, and it was next
reported, that it had been discovered in quantity, in the Wide
Bay District: but Gympie was reserved for a future and more
exigent period. Amidst the alternate exultation and depression
which rumour and contradiction excited, the extraordinary
richness of the newly-opened fields in Victoria added to the
excitement, and gave cause for despondency to those residents who
were compelled to remain to deplore a possible exodus, which
realised, would to them be ruin. They plucked up spirit again at
reported fresh discoveries at Mount Brisbane and Widgee Widgee,
but the reports did not prevent a continuous
migration&mdash;especially from the localities nearest the
port&mdash;and I read of an unfortunate station holder on the
Logan commencing shearing, himself and one shearer being the
total available amount of labour. The rumours did not abate up to
the end of the year, but with no tangible result, except that
their multiplicity awakened the attention of the New South Wales
Government, who, to the gratification of the residents proposed
to send Mr. Hargreaves to Moreton Bay, early in 1852. Nobody had
the slightest doubt of there being plenty of gold in the
district, but most people wanted faith in those who were looking
for it. Here was the right man coming to unlock the treasures
which only awaited a discerning eye and skilful hand to be thrown
open to the people.</p>
<p>But all was not neglected for gold. The cultivation of cotton
was pursued, but with a caution which must have seemed cold to
the enthusiasm of Dr. Lang. The bale which had been sent to
England from Sydney by Mr. Donaldson, in the preceding year, was
reported upon favourably by Mr. Boothman, the secretary to the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce; but one point was dwelt upon
which seems scarcely to have received sufficient attention by the
cotton growers of this colony; the importance of avoiding mixture
of staple. Another matter referred to, was the evident desire to
rival the Sea Island variety of the United States, which was
strongly deprecated as not required by the nature of the home
demand; not more than thirty thousand bags of that particular
kind being consumed in England out of the whole vast import. The
suggestiveness of this latter advice was, I fear, suffered to
pass unnoticed, for, in our first Land Act after Separation, the
bonus authorised to be paid on the export of Sea Island cotton,
was just twice that for the export of the more common varieties.
The Government of New South Wales threw out a little
encouragement. They offered premiums of £50 for the best fifty
pounds weight of cotton wool, and of £25 for the same quantity of
the next best. Dr. Hobbs was amongst our foremost
experimentalists, and produced good samples from some of the seed
which had been forwarded by Mr. Donaldson for distribution. Mr.
Robert Douglas was similarly hopeful, and similarly successful;
and while their efforts indicated faith, news came to inspire
hope. Mr. Poole, of Brisbane, had sent samples to Messrs. Young
and Co., of London, who, in reply, stated their value at 9d. to
1s. per lb., and authorised immediate purchases to the amount of
£1000, if they could be made. On this, it was proposed to form a
cotton-growing company, on the principle on which building
societies are founded; but I do not see that anything came of the
proposition. The first really commercial transaction that I find
recorded, was the purchase by Mr. Poole, from Mr. Douglas, of
about half a ton of cotton, which was shipped in September,
although, from the difficulty of ginning in the seed, the
practical result of Mr. Douglas' experiment was not very
encouraging, the profit on the unginned cotton from an acre of
ground being reported as under £5; had facilities for proper
ginning existed, the profit would have been greater. Another
agricultural product, which now receives the attention it
deserves at the hands of cultivators, also crept into no rice.
Mr. Childs, of Breakfast Creek, had turned his attention to
arrowroot, at his farm there, and this year had half a ton of
roots in the ground. The samples of the previous year's produce
sent to Sydney were liked, and readily disposed of, but in this,
as in most new industries, want of experience and paucity of
capital were hindrances in the way of that success which entitles
them to be considered national. Mining for coal was struggling to
assert itself as a profitable pursuit. Mr. John Williams, who had
been a Chartist of some note, at a time when the once celebrated
"five points" were not in such favour as, in the guise of liberal
principles, they have since been, opened the first mine in
Moreton Bay, on the south side of the river Brisbane, about four
miles from Wolston. The mine was worked four years, and then, by
the rising of the river, flooded out, the seam dipping as it was
opened. Williams then commenced another pit at Moggill, on the
north side of the river, about sixteen miles from Brisbane by the
read which he worked with sufficient success to induce him this
year to establish a depôt for the sale of his coal in the town.
Another coal mine on the western bank of the Bremer, and a short
distance front Ipswich, is also noticed as having been opened by
Messrs. Heed and Boyland, and with promising prospects.</p>
<p>In other matters, the residents worked tolerably well
together. A School of Arts building was completed in Brisbane.
The simple accommodation it afforded was sufficient for some
years for the wants of the members: but its nondescript style of
architecture could have exerted but a perverse influence on
artistic education. A market was proclaimed and trustees chosen;
a new Evangelical chapel was completed and opened, as well as a
Wesleyan chapel and a Presbyterian church at South Brisbane.
Ipswich was not behind hand in effort towards the establishment
of a literary institution of a more permanent character titan the
library and reading room. Nor were pleasure and health neglected:
the capabilities of the bay coast, near Cabbage Tree Creek, were
examined, and the first step taken towards the settlement of
Sandgate. In the outlying districts, the progress was moderate.
Maryborough was proclaimed a township, and the settlers had at
length the luxury of bidding against each other for town
allotments.</p>
<p>While in matters that savoured of speculation, there was
little of co-operative spirit in the people of Brisbane, they
united readily enough where the benefit to be secured was
tangible and certain, and in nothing were they more
anxious&mdash;except for the discovery of gold&mdash;than for the
improvement of the port. £100 had been voted by the Legislative
Council towards a survey of the obstructions at the mouth of the
river, in aid of which some subscriptions were invited, but, not
mind to the credit of the up-country inhabitants, the invitation
was responded to by the residents of Brisbane only. A committee
was organised to superintend the expenditure, and Mr. Donaldson,
on their application, sent them a civil engineer&mdash;Mr.
Debenham&mdash;to make the necessary surveys and reports. By the
end of June that gentleman had completed his task. I am unable to
quote his report at length, but it was of sufficient merit to
deserve analysis, if only for purposes of reference hereafter.
His first question was, whether the formation of a channel across
the bar was practicable; his second, the best method of effecting
that object. The first he answered affirmatively; and, as to the
second, recommended dredging&mdash;but he was emphatic in
insistence on the necessity for a preliminary improvement of the
river navigation by damming up the boat and other channels, and,
as far as possible, contracting the bed of the river to a uniform
width. This done, he considered the dredging of the bar would be
greatly facilitated, and the maintenance of the channel easy. The
cost he estimated at £30,000; and the time required, six years.
The late Mr. A. Petrie, upon the publication of this report,
suggested marking the line of channel by beacons, and the use of
a simple machine to break up the bottom surface, leaving the
disturbed matter to be carried off by the current. And with that,
for a time, the matter dropped.</p>
<p>The circuit courts sat twice in the year&mdash;an application
for a resident judge having been refused&mdash;and the calendar
was heavy in both instances. At the May assize, thirty-one
prisoners were in gaol awaiting their trials; and of these two
were for murder, one for a mail robbery, and a considerable
number for crimes of a grave character. At the November sittings,
a Chinese and an aboriginal were both found guilty of murder.
There seems to have been a good deal of minor criminality in the
district&mdash;and of a kind which might have been expected from
the class from which the criminals principally came. The
additions to the population by immigration were small. On
February 8, the <i>Duchess of Northumberland</i> brought 227
immigrants, some of whom immediately left to join relatives in
New South Wales. Some discussion took place on a proposed
introduction of Germans, and a more angry one on the results of
the Chinese importations which had been made by some of the
larger employers, with results that led to a general condemnation
of that kind of labour. The settlers were sorely straightened,
and the policy of the Colonial Office, equally with that of the
New South Wales Government towards them, was not of a kind to
afford them aid, or induce their respect.</p>
<p>The blacks continued a source of annoyance, and loss of both
life and property. A party of between four and five hundred
attacked an outstation on M'Encroe's run, in the Maranoa
District, drove off a mob of cattle, and tried to fire the hut,
so as a get at the overseer&mdash;an attempt which cost four of
them their lives. They were afterwards followed, and a number of
the cattle recovered, after a fight, in which nine blacks were
killed. In the Burnett District they were again unremitting in
their attacks, and the life of the outlying settler must have
been one of continuous anxiety and alarm. It is not surprising
that squatting settlement was not, under such circumstances, much
extended, or exploration attempted. Rumours came in that
Leichhardt and his party had been murdered before they had quite
got through the Maranoa District; but nothing of a definite
nature could be arrived at, and, at length, it was determined to
send a party in search of him in charge of Mr. Hovenden Hely, who
had been with Leichhardt in the abortive attempt which terminated
at the Peak Downs.</p>
<p>I have now arrived at a period when a halting place may well
be marked in the progress of this history. On March 1, 1851, the
census of the colony of New South Wales was taken: on April 3,
1881, the last one of the colony of Queensland was collected;
thirty years separating the two dates. It will not be
uninteresting or uninstructive to note, with more than usual
detail, the numbers, conditions, and avocations of the people of,
what we may call, our own country at the earlier time. I omit the
district of Clarence, then included in the northern
districts.</p>
<p>The total area of those districts as proclaimed, was 58,860
square miles. On that area there were living 8,575 souls, divided
into 6,012 males, and 2,563 females, of whom 1,558 males and
1,180 females were more than twenty-one years of age, and only 68
above sixty; 1,169 of the males were set down as married, and
1,026 of the females, being an exceedingly small proportion. As
to their civil condition, 3,895 males had arrived free or were
natives of the colony, and 3,656 females; 1,469 males and 105
females had become free, and there were 473 ticket-of-leave
holders&mdash;males; and two females of the same class. I
scarcely attach much value to some of the statistics as to
religion; but the analysis would not be complete without them,
and the large numbers of Mohammedans and Pagans possess a certain
significance. The numbers stand thus:&mdash;Professing, members
of the Church of England, 3,639; of the Church of Scotland, 930;
Wesleyans, 293; other Protestants, 522; Roman Catholics, 2,318;
Jews, 13; Mohammedans and Pagans, 571; and other
persuasions&mdash;including, I suppose, those of no persuasion at
all&mdash;24. The educational return was a melancholy
one&mdash;3,678 males could read and write, and 1,251
females&mdash;in all, 4,929, not much more than half the entire
population, 1,322, could read; the rest were destitute of any
semblance of education. The nationalities of the inhabitants are
worth glancing at: 1,847 were born in the colony of New South
Wales; 3,075 were English; 38 Welsh; 1,939 Irish; 793 Scotch; 145
came from other British possessions; and the remainder, almost
wholly males, from foreign countries. For convenience sake, I
tabulate the occupations in which they were said to be
engaged:&mdash;</p>

<p>The preponderance of residents employed in connection with
pastoral pursuits, was in accordance with the then character of
the local industries; but I confess I am puzzled by the number of
horticulturists and of educated persons with no special
avocation. The returns as to houses will afford opportunity for
some curious contrasts. There were 1,021 in all the northern
districts, 718 of which were in the county of Stanley, I presume
mostly in Brisbane and Ipswich. Of the whole number, 111 were of
stone or brick, and not one had a slated roof. The town
populations comprised, at that time, more than half the grand
total. In Brisbane and the suburbs there were 2,543; in Ipswich,
932; in Maryborough, 299; in Warwick, 267; in Drayton, 200; and
in Gayndah, 92. All the legal fraternity, and seventeen of the
medical men, were collected in Brisbane and Ipswich. It may
possibly be, that the entire absence of legal aid was conducive
to that peace of mind which tends so much to the promotion of
physical health, and so, in the interior, medical assistance was
less required.</p>
<p>The progress since 1846 had been great, the population had
been nearly doubled in every one of the old districts, and new
ones had been added; but the preponderance of the towns was not a
healthy sign, and the continued restriction to a solitary staple
was no subject for congratulation. The value of the exports for
the year was £181,038, an increase of £31,219 on those of 1850,
the items still showing but a small amount attributable to other
than pastoral pursuits, timber being the principal, and a by no
means remarkable, exception. So far, figures afforded
encouragement, yet, at the close of the year, the editor of the
<i>Courier</i> declared&mdash;despite the abolition of the
newspaper postages, and removal to better quarters,* that "times
were dull." What will the historian of the future collect from
the statistics and the journalistic opinions of 1881?</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="">With</span> the year 1852 the desire for gold
increased, and the wish took practical expression in finding
funds by public subscription for the equipment of prospecting
parties in various directions, whose researches invariably
resulted in failure. It may be doubted whether any of the efforts
made were of a kind to determine the gold-bearing qualities of
the districts tried with anything like certainty, but at the
time, either from want of money or from absolute despair, the
conclusions arrived at were generally accepted. There was one
enquiry which had been looked to with considerable hope, and
whose futility therefore caused more than ordinary vexation. Mr.
Hargreaves came with all the prestige of past discovery, and of
Government authority, and assistance, but the promised
examination can scarcely be considered other than a flying visit
of the most cursory description. It was, in fact, little more
than an ordinary journey by the routes to the principal townships
on the Downs, and then through Cunningham's Gap to Ipswich,
thence to Mount Brisbane and back, and so to Brisbane itself. For
all useful purposes the trip might well be regarded as valueless,
and his report, when published, met with not a little
uncomplimentary criticism. Later in the year the settlement was
agitated by a rumour that an extensive goldfield had been found
at Bingara Creek, a tributary of the Gwydir River, and not very
far west of the township of Warialda. As this was within the
boundary understood to be determined upon whenever Separation
should take place, no small excitement followed the intelligence,
and it was not long before parties were formed and travelled from
Brisbane, Ipswich, and other localities, towards the supposed
golden region. So strong was the belief in its importance, that
those who did not go themselves, experienced its influence in a
variety of forms. Employers found the possibility of high wages
staring them in the face, and labourers gleefully anticipated
that contingency. The police applied for an increase of their pay
and allowances. Unfortunately all their hopes and fears were
premature. It was soon discovered that there was no
field&mdash;that the gold was insignificant in quantity and
uncertain in deposit, and the wayfarers having seen the nakedness
of the land, returned weary, disappointed, and angry. The sole
consolatory fact that I find in the hopeful predictions and
hopeless failures of the year, is that a former resident, who had
been successful in his mining adventures, realised the suggestion
to which I have before referred, and showed his faith in the
district by sending money to purchase land for future
occupation.</p>
<p>The cotton industry languished for want, as some said, of
enterprise, or, as others said, of labour. If reports on quality
and price could stimulate, those received from time to time,
should have made men sanguine, but the reporters seem in all
cases to have confined themselves to approval, and to have turned
a deaf ear to any suggestions as to aid in capital or machinery.
Dr. Hobbs, an old colonist, and long a member of our Legislative
Council, sent samples to the editor of the Economist, who, in his
turn, submitted them to a Manchester cotton spinner, who was
"delighted" with them, and valued them at 19d. per lb., further
bestowing such encouragement as might be derived from his
opinion, that "the Board of Trade and the Colonial Office should
know the important fact that Moreton Bay can produce very
superior and truly beautiful cotton wool." Other samples
forwarded to different quarters were appraised at about the same
value, but I am unaware of the precise extent of eulogy which
their merits elicited. However, the cultivation began to assume a
definite appearance&mdash;about twenty-seven acres of Land being
spoken of as preparing for the purpose in August. Dr. Lang, who
had arrived in England, busied himself with characteristic energy
in submitting samples, obtaining estimates and reports, and
pressing the suitability of the soil and climate of Moreton Bay
upon the attention of the British public. Towards the close of
the year, the hearts of the experimentalists were cheered by a
final and elaborate report, obtained at his instance, from the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in which the secretary wound up
by saying, "I believe the cultivation of cotton in Moreton
Bay&mdash;if that cultivation be pushed with energy&mdash;stands
a better chance of success than any new industry of which I have
heard or read." Could encouragement be more direct, except,
perhaps, the accompaniment of a moderate amount of capital, to
lay the foundation of so profitable an enterprise? And while on
the subject of local industries, I may notice that Dr. Hobbs also
commenced the trial of coffee growing on a small scale this year.
There seems all through these trials to have been an ignorance of
what had been effected under the old convict regime by some of
the most intelligent of the officers, which can only be accounted
for on the supposition that there was so much of the bad in the
work to be forgotten, that what was really good perished in the
general disinclination to recollect.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the year, the residents had enough to
trouble them as to labour. During the previous twelve months the
supply had been, as we have seen, scanty, to the suspension of
all but indispensable work, and the squatter contemplated his
chances rather sadly; but as time rolled on, their long continued
remonstrances and petitions began to bear fruit, the more
grateful since the Chinese importations had become nuisances;
and, while adding slightly to the effective industrial power,
lengthened beyond all reasonable proportion the calendar of
crime. The <i>Maria Soames</i>, the <i>Argyle</i>, the
<i>Meridian</i>, and <i>Rajah Gopaul</i>, immigrant vessels,
brought 1,119 souls, the greater number from Ireland, to add to
the population of the district, at which the people were glad;
but the Gopaul brought, also, typhus fever, the discovery of
which led to quite an opposite feeling, and to the very proper
visitation of the captain and surgeon with severe penalties.
Sixty-four German immigrants came by way of Sydney, and, by their
quiet industry, gave general satisfaction. The relief afforded
was perceptible; but Dr. Lang's assiduous exertions appear to
have been none the less appreciated. At this period, too, the
attention of the Colonial Legislature was directed, with no
little perseverance, to the consideration of the whole system of
immigration, and various schemes were suggested, which may
generally be dismissed with the remark that their complex
details, elaborated with much ingenuity, could have only resulted
in proportionate failure. The principal recommendation of a
select committee, that immigrants to whom a free passage had been
granted, should re-pay the colony at the rate of £13 per head,
exhibited about as little policy as justice, and more of faith
than precaution.</p>
<p>Neither the want of labour, nor its ultimate supply, diverted
the attention of the people from the two questions of separation
and the renewal of transportation. The annual revenue derivable
from the whole of the northern districts, directly and
indirectly, was not more than about £30,000; but the advocates of
separation urged that the public income of Western Australia was
considerably less: and the long withholding of a fair proportion
of the immigrants sent to the colony generally, was a standing
grievance; while it was alleged that this district gut by no
means its just share of the colonial outlay. And, as the
injustice complained of led to discontent, so the perpetual
fluctuations of report engendered anxiety. One day the people
were told that separation only wanted some legal technicalities
to be formally proclaimed; on another, that, not only would
transportation be continued in its most objectionable form to Van
Diemen's Land, but, that Earl Grey had told Mr. King, the
Victorian anti-transportation delegate, that "nearly every
respectable man in the Moreton Bay District had signed the
petition for separation&mdash;of course, with the coveted exile
accompaniment. The Northern Districts Association, to promote
separation with "exiles," sprang into renewed activity, and on
May 19, held a meeting of their supporters, at which Mr. Arthur
Hodgson moved the adoption of a petition to the Queen for
separation, "on the terms proposed"&mdash;I presume in the former
memorial&mdash;and Mr. T. L. M. Prior, a resolution that a letter
should be sent to the Secretary of State, deprecating any further
delay. The interference of the Australasian Anti-Transportation
League in the question was strongly censured, and it was affirmed
that the non-discovery of gold here having resulted in a draft of
labour to the more fortunate districts, the introduction of
exiles was absolutely necessary. All the resolutions were carried
without dissent, and it was supposed that the Association had
achieved a success; but a few weeks after, the flattering notion
was dispelled. In June a despatch from Earl Grey to Sir Charles
Fitzroy was published, acknowledging the receipt of the two
petitions described in my last chapter, and replying in detail to
the requests embodied in each. Admitting, that Her Majesty would
have been justified from them in at once dividing the colony, his
lordship urged that separation would be best deferred until the
inhabitants of Moreton Bay had been able to test, by experience,
the value of the increased representation which they had in the
newly-elected Legislative Council; but he distinctly gave as his
opinion that, if after that, they continued dissatisfied, he
should feel justified in advising that the division should take
place. As respected transportation, he stated, that if the colony
were divided, and the representatives of the new
province&mdash;not the Legislative Council of New South Wales, as
Sir Charles Fitzroy's Executive had assumed&mdash;asked for the
continuance or revival of that system, the request might be
granted, although some of the conditions mentioned in the
petition for it already sent were inadmissible. Earl Grey ended
by reminding the Governor, that the Executive minute which
accompanied the petitions, and was adverse to their prayer, was
in error in confining the estimate of the probable Customs
revenue of the new settlement to the amount actually received at
the existing ports, as that was manifestly open to increase by
the sums received in Sydney on dutiable goods consumed in the
Moreton Bay District. It was tolerably clear from this, that
there was little chance of a renewal in any shape of
transportation to the district, and that most certainly it would
not be considered a condition precedent to the granting of
separation. After some mutual remonstrance and explanation, a
meeting of the inhabitants was called to petition the Queen at
once for separation, without any condition, and the feeling that
prompt action was required, was strengthened by a misapprehension
of a speech at Sydney, by a member of the Stanley Boroughs, Mr.
B. Jones, in which he was supposed to have said, that if
transportation were definitely abolished, his constituents would
not so much press for separation. When the meeting was held in
August, it was apparent that two dulcifying influences had been
at work&mdash;one, the despatch I have alluded to, which showed
that the hope of "exiles" had become an evanescent one&mdash;the
other, that the arrival of the immigrant vessels had rendered
them less immediately necessary. Mr. Hodgson's capacity of
spontaneous conversion was powerfully developed, and the late Mr.
St. George Gore found himself moving a resolution for separation,
which was to be seconded by one of the most ardent
anti-transportationists of the day, Mr. W. Munro Smith. Dr.
Cannan and Mr. R. Cribb were at accord in supporting a petition
to Her Majesty for separation, in which&mdash;no doubt, to the
great content of the latter&mdash;neither exiles, military,
police establishments, or compensating immigration, found
mention. There was at last unanimity, no doubt, promoted by the
unusual presence of ladies at the meeting, even in adopting the
practical suggestion of Mr. Little, that funds should be
subscribed to provide for the expenses attendant upon, and of
publishing what had been done, and of procuring the necessary
signatures to, the petition. Everybody seemed in good humour, but
everybody was not. There were a few who either could not or would
not understand the true bearing of Earl Grey's despatch, and
protested against the absence of stipulations against
"convictism" in the petition, not seeing that any such
stipulation would be fatal to its reception. But they had their
growl, and so the controversy ended. Henceforth the contest was
to be for separation alone.</p>
<p>A fair consideration of the difficulties and nature of the
subject will, I think, exonerate both parties to that protracted
and sometimes bitter dispute from much of the blame of opposite
kinds that each has sustained. I do not think that the squatters
alone desired the renewal of transportation. The names which
appear of its advocates prove the contrary&mdash;although, as the
largest employers of labour, they naturally attracted the most
attention. Custom deadens sensitiveness, and necessity suggests
excuses. Those who, in the old country in advertising for a
groom, would have made it a condition, that u[n]exceptionable
references "should be given, became familiarised by use with the
attendance upon their friends of servants whose sole reference
was their ticket-of-leave. And when men, who had become tolerant
by that kind of saw their credit, and even their profitable
chance of living, gradually melting away from the want of labour,
it is not wonderful that they exerted themselves to get that kind
which appeared to be most easily retained and controlled. As to
the philanthropic claim of becoming reformatory instruments which
some paraded, as I never saw the effort in action I need not
discuss its validity. The hostility shown to, and the abuse
lavished on, the anti-transportation party, seems to have been
exceedingly indefensible. Not so directly interested in the
question, their prosperity depended upon that of the great staple
industry of the settlement, for if that failed, their customers
were gone. This they perilled, and they had at least an
intelligent principle upon which to take a stand. Their suspicion
of the squatters was, however, unpalatable to those who had
nothing but the instincts of self-preservation or the desire of
wealth at the bottom of their procedure, as well as to those who
felt it really unjust; still they saw, that under the old
Orders-in-Council, the possibility of legal offence by some of
them was treated as a not improbable contingency, and that only
recently had a squatting license conferred a vote, so that
whatever might be the characters of some leading stockowners,
there might be little reason to respect the rank and file. Not
having seen that prisoners might be employed without danger, they
retained dislikes which, in a colony termed prejudices, in the
society they had left were simply so natural as not even to be
discussed. It is creditable to both sides, that when the final
and wise determination of Earl Grey was given, both forgot their
dissensions, and heartily co-operated in a cause of whose justice
neither could entertain a doubt.</p>
<p>After the first congratulations on the settlement of the
question were over, there was, as usual, some discussion as to
whom it was to be really attributed. Making every allowance for
the weight attached to local opinion, we are not to forget the
great influence exercised by the united and energetic
remonstrances of the gold-producing colonies upon the final
determination of the Colonial Office. Whether Moreton Bay were a
Crown colony or a representative one, it was clear that great and
general discontent would be excited throughout Australia, were
convicts sent there. The effect of the new discoveries upon the
public feeling of the old country upon this question&mdash;at one
time very languid&mdash;was rapid and strong; and, pressed by
these converging furces, without in form abandoning his own
conviction, Earl Grey adopted a constitutional opening for its
practical disappearance. Thus many causes tended to the same end;
although, and in no wise detracting from the good service of what
had before time been a forlorn hope, there is no doubt that, so
far as the expression of opinion in the district itself was
concerned, the settlers who came out in Dr. Lang's ships turned
the scale.</p>
<p>It was soon evident, that on the remaining question of
separation, both exertion and unanimity would be required. The
minute of the New South Wales Executive Council forwarded to Earl
Grey upon the petitions for the erection of the district into a
separate colony had, as I have before implied, been hostile in
tone, and not very fair in statement. There was now to be added
to the opposition already experienced, that of the leading press
and of the Legislature of the parent colony. The <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>, of August 18, referring to the meeting I have
described, observes:&mdash;"It is difficult to mete out the
portions of laughter, pity, and contempt which must be awarded to
our misguided fellow-colonists lying to the northward of the 30th
degree of latitude;" and Mr. Wentworth, in the new Constitution
Bill, which he introduced this year, with characteristic
dexterity, inserted a clause, which, if adopted, would have left
the Imperial Government no discretion as to the boundaries to be
fixed whenever separation did take place. For that clause
declared that those "of the colony of New South Wales shall not
be curtailed on the north side within the 26th degree of south
latitude." He would thus have included all the most populous
portion of the district&mdash;the proposed line being east and
west to the north of Gympie, and half-way between that goldfield
and Maryborough. The influence and character of the man caused
this attempt to be viewed with considerable alarm, not lessened
by the discovery that some Sydney residents interested in the
Clarence River Districts had been endeavouring to get up a
petition there against separation. On November 2, a meeting was
held in Brisbane, at which a short, but well-argued, petition to
the Council was unanimously adopted. It pointed out, that it was
in fact, an attempt to override the Imperial Act, 13 and 14 Vic.,
chap. 5, by which the Council itself was constituted, and to
abrogate the rights conferred by that Act upon the petitioners,
in which they had now a vested interest. Some strong terms were
made use of with reference to the conduct of the Sydney press,
and a hope was expressed that the appeal to the justice of the
Council would not be in vain&mdash;a hope whose futility
experience soon demonstrated. The adjournment of the Council left
the petitioners unanswered till the following year. As to the
general legislation of the colony, I find nothing worth notice,
except that the control and expenditure of its gold revenues were
conceded to it by the Crown. The end of the year found Moreton
Bay at the beginning of a contested election for the Stanley
Boroughs, Mr. R. Jones, their representative, dying on November
G. Mr. Jones had been in the colony altogether thirty-three
years, and had reached the seventieth year of his age, and was
much regretted in the district in which the later period of his
life had been spent. Dr. Lang and Mr. H. Stewart Russell, a
respectable squatter of "liberal" tendencies, were spoken of as
candidates for the vacancy thus created, and ultimately, Dr. Lang
being in England, his name was withdrawn, and Mr. Russell
elected.</p>
<p>There had been, from time to time, much anxiety expressed, and
probably some felt, as to the fate of Leichhardt. Rumours of
various kinds had reached the boundaries of the settlement, all
tending to show that the intrepid explorer had died either from
privation or violence, but none sufficiently reliable to call for
serious attention. To arrive, however, at some conclusion on the
subject, as I have before said, the New South Wales Government
determined to send an expedition on the route he had indicated,
and Mr. Hovenden Hely left Sydney on January 1 of this year, with
a party for that purpose. The bulk of his supplies were sent to
Brisbane by sea, to meet him on the Darling Downs, he travelling
overland from the Hunter. He had with him six white companions,
the usual labour, and Brown, the aboriginal, who accompanied
Leichhardt on his first expedition. They arrived at Westbrook on
March 2, and thence proceeded to Surat, where they found rumours,
that about a hundred miles to the north-west of Mount Abundance,
Leichhardt and his associates had been murdered. These rested on
no better authority than the statements of the natives, but their
particularity extending to a pretending power of identifying the
spot of the catastrophe where the bones and other relics of the
party might be found, gave them some force. Mr. Hely therefore
resolved to proceed, taking with him six weeks' provisions,
leaving some of his party behind him to ascertain, if possible,
in the locality itself, the correctness of the rumour. He reached
Mount Bindango with some difficulty, more from want of water than
from any other circumstance, and was then compelled to return. He
again started upon what may be called the main expedition, taking
with him a black of the district, named "Billy," as an
interpreter, and now and then picking up a native or two, from
whom only indefinite information could be extracted. All,
however, concurred in the assertion, that Leichhardt had been
murdered, and in their description of the circumstances attendant
upon his death. The limit of Mr. Hely's journey was a chain of
water holes, apparently on the Warrego or one of its tributaries,
situated in latitude 25° 30' S., and longitude 146° 35' E., where
he fixed his twenty-second camp. From this and his preceding camp
as centres, he states that he explored the country for forty-five
miles north, east, and west, finding no tracks of Leichhardt but
the site of two camps, whose positions appear to have been
correctly indicated to him by the natives, and at short distances
from his own route. At the first were still&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"the tent poles and forks, the heavy saplings upon
which he had placed his packs (showing that the ground must have
been very wet and damp), and even the forked sticks and cross
pieces in front of the fire at which they had most probably
roasted part of a kangaroo, the bones of which were lying about.
There was also in one place a large quantity of cattle dung,
showing where the bullocks had been bedded, but though Brown and
Billy, who were also with me, looked carefully for tracks coming
to or departing from, this camp, they could find no new the soil
being, as I have found it ever since we reached the Maranoa,
loose and sandy. The most probable reason for our never having
seen any of his camps before, is, that at the time he left Mount
Abundance, the whole country was in a state of inundation,
consequently he could travel in any direction, always sure of
plenty of water; whereas, it has been so scarce since I have been
out, that we have been compelled to follow water courses, and
even then had to encamp more than once without any."</blockquote>
<p>In the second camp he found very much the same kind of marks,
but an equal absence of tracks; both were distinguished by a tree
marked XXA in the lower part of a capital L. In the course of his
last exploratory excursions from the camp, he was deserted by his
interpreter "Billy" (who found his way safely back); and his
provisions falling short, one of his companions being ill, and
the information as to the actual scene of the supposed murder, at
least uncertain, he resolved to re-trace his steps, and arrived
at Surat on July 20, having achieved nothing beyond ascertaining
the direction in which Leichhardt had actually gone, and a
repetition of the rumours upon which the expedition had been
originally determined What might have been done at that time by a
man of greater resolution and resource, is another question.</p>
<p>The life of the district (apart from political matters and
natural accident) must have been what is generally called
humdrum." There was now and then a spurt of excitement at the
supposed practicability of discovering a goldfield; there were
meetings at the School of Arts, and there wag a debating or
discussion class, whose subjects and whose eloquence were of the
usual kind. There seems, moreover, to have been already a sort of
nascent rivalry between the township at "the head of navigation,"
and that which was the port&mdash;a rivalry not extinguished by a
flood at Ipswich characterised at the time as the highest known
there for eight or nine years, the Bremer rising twenty-five
feet. Brisbane was, of course, not left unvisited, and the damage
on the western tracks was considerable. A proposal to blow up the
Seventeen Mile Rocks, on the river Brisbane, was one of the forms
in which the natural resultant grumbling found vent But both
townships had their dignity increased&mdash;Ipswich actually, and
Brisbane in prospect&mdash;for a Police Magistrate was appointed
to the former, while Captain Wickham, it was understood, was to
be promoted to the higher title of Government Resident, thus
giving to the latter, besides its advantages of situation, the
character of a provincial metropolis, The Brisbane Hospital went
on its useful and unostentatious way, and, as now, afforded
considerable accommodation to patients from all parts of the
country, without receiving a corresponding support. The general
traffic on the then main roads I should imagine to have been
small, from the prices realised at the annual sale of the ferries
across the Brisbane. There were but two, and the principal
one&mdash;that whose approaches from Queen Street so long vexed
horsemen and drivers, was sold in April for £113; the other to
Kangaroo Point for £19. The Circuit Courts gave a relief to, the
general monotony. There were forty-eight prisoners in gaol for
trial at the May circuit&mdash;a considerable number being
Chinese, and that nationality was, to use a diplomatic phrase of
modern invention, "adequately represented" at the second court
held in November; but the residents no longer looked upon the
court as the benevolent novelty it was when originally given to
them, and wanted a resident judge for themselves, for which
higher blessing they had to wait&mdash;a bill for the purpose
being rejected in the Legislative Council by nineteen to sixteen.
There was a little jealousy of Cleveland; and Cabbage Tree Creek
began to assume a position of some importance. The value of the
anchorage at a moderate distance from the shore, and the
consequent rapidity with which news might be brought to Brisbane
from vessels newly-arrived in the bay, being insisted upon, as
well as the probability that masters of whalers would avail
themselves of the facilities thus presented, to secure supplies
from Brisbane, rather than run the risk of losing their men by
calling at Sydney. I have read worse reasons in behalf of better
places&mdash;but Sandgate is not yet the Sandridge of
Brisbane.</p>
<p>The natives, as usual, were fertile sources of complaint, and
soon became equally so of controversy. In and close to the towns
they stole what they could; in the outside districts they both
stole and murdered. In the Burnett District, a Mr. Trevethan, an
extensive stockholder, was killed by them, and many of his sheep
driven off. Station after station is reported as having been
attacked with similar results, and on the Pine their depredations
were frequent, and murder sometimes followed. But in what may be
called the reverse side to that which I have had to present, it
is stated, that at one station on the Burnett, that of the
Messrs. Strathden, the natives were employed as shepherds, and
that not a single sheep was lost; and in the <i>Courier</i> of
June 15, in the communication from its Burnett correspondent I
find the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The inhabitants were lately indulged with an
aboriginal fight, when several were killed, and their bodies
roasted and eaten inside of the town; Mr. Wilmot, the
storekeeper, being the only gentleman whose stomach was strong
enough to bear the spectacle of this disgusting
feast."</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to say, in this case, who were the greater
barbarians, nor should I insert an anecdote of such revolting
barbarity on all sides, but that I find its truth no where
challenged. Additional native police was called for, and in the
same breath their utility was dialled. In the mass of conflicting
statement&mdash;inference and opinion, he would be a bold man who
presumed to pronounce any certain judgment as to the truth or
value of either.</p>
<p>There is not much to record in the way of the establishment of
new industries. It will be a surprise to some of my readers to be
told that, in this year (1852), Mr. D. M'Connell attempted the
cultivation of wheat at Bulimba, to the extent of about twenty
acres, and, it is stated in the local journals, got twenty
bushels to the acre. Mr. Lumsden, of Moggill Creek, placed in the
same year a small quantity of similar grain of good quality in
the hands of Mr. Robert Cribb, of Brisbane. And, in this year,
Mr. Pettigrew is recorded as being engaged in the erection of
premises for the saw mills which first occupied the site of the
present establishment. I read that some news had arrived of the
possibility of establishing an Australian company for making
Australian preserved meats, and that the Admiralty looked
favourably upon the notion; moreover, the Torres Straits route
was warmly advocated as essential to the interests of this
portion of the then colony. And as, perhaps, a prophetic example,
both of enterprise and failure, a Moreton Bay Steam Navigation
Company was started in April, to run a boat between Brisbane and
Sydney. A meeting was held in May at the old Sovereign Hotel,
when resolutions affirmatory both of the desirability and
practicability of the company were carried. The capital was to be
£15,000, in shares of £10 each, no one to hold more than fifty
shares, a half to be paid on allocation, the other half in twelve
months from that time. It was stated then, that the required boat
could be got, for £10,000, and that £6,000 had already been
subscribed, and a committee was forthwith appointed to carry the
project out. Ipswich followed the example of Brisbane in the way
of resolution and subscription. By the end of August, more than
two-thirds of the required capital were subscribed for, and it
was resolved to proceed at once to allotment. In October a
further meeting was held, when a call of £4 10s. per share was
made, estimates produced, and the usual preliminaries to definite
action gone through. I regret to add, that as became so
respectable a predecessor in the way of local
communication&mdash;for this company was initiated under the most
satisfactory auspices&mdash;very early in the following year a
meeting being called, it was resolved to proceed no further,
except to pay necessary expenses. The failure was another weapon
in the hands of the Sydney opponents of separation.</p>
<p>Such an ignominious break-down may have resulted, as was
suggested at the time, from the dissensions between the country
and town shareholders, or it may have been that subscription was
more easy than payment. I am inclined to think that the latter
had something to do with it, for the export for the year showed a
very poor increase on that of 1851, the total being £185,183, and
the advance only £4,146. I am now able to give the export for the
six months ending December 31, 1852&mdash;from the Clarence
River, £23,850; the Richmond, £16,[blank]; the Tweed, £960; and
the Mary, £10,568. Statistics are valuable sometimes, as
indicating motion, and it is not wonderful that Mr. Wentworth
treated Wide Bay with such indifference&mdash;or that when
separation became inevitable, the New South Wales interests,
considering half a loaf better than no bread, contrived to get
the original boundaries between the two colonies altered, and so
kept the Clarence and Richmond for themselves.</p>
<p>There is one important topic upon which I have been most
inexcusably silent. It is said that whenever two Englishmen meet,
and are at a loss for a subject, they invariably find one in the
weather, and on that I have said nothing. In its first magistrate
and resident, Captain Wickham, the district was fortunate in
having a man of scientific and observant mind; and I find, that
for some time he was in the habit of contributing what he termed
a "weather journal," to the <i>Courier</i> with
regularity&mdash;such omissions as occur not being, I think,
attributable to him. His observations comprise the period from
1840 to April, 1850 inclusive, at which last date they, for
unexplained reasons, ceased to be communicated, and I have
tabulated them mostly in an abridged form, as perpetuating a
valuable contribution to meteorological facts, and in the hope
that some generous man of science may fill up the interval
between April, 1850. and the time when meteorological
observations were officially and regularly taken, I believe, by
the late Dr. Barton in 1859 or '60.</p>
<p>I first give the rainfall during each month in
inches:&mdash;</p>

<p>From these records we are able to see that, between 1839 and
April 1850, in three years, 1841, 1843 and 1844, a more than
usual downpour took place, that in 1844 being extraordinary; and
we are not surprised to find it remembered, that a great flood
took place in Ipswich in January of that year, and that the
country was continuously flooded for a long time, when the
rainfall in December, 1843, and January and February, 1844, was
more than equal to that of all 1840, and 1842, and nearly equal
to the fall of 1846. I trust to be able to connect these
observations with those of Dr. Barton, as we shall then have a
table of the rainfall in the district for a period of thirty-six
years, and the deductions to be collected will be of great value
to the colonists in the East and West Moretons, and the Darling
Downs. Further north or west, I fear no records exist up to the
time when the official ones began to be taken.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> petition of the residents of
Moreton Bay against the separation clause in Mr. Wentworth's new
Constitution Bill, met with very contemptuous treatment at the
hands of that gentleman and his supporters, On the motion for its
being printed, in the Legislative Council, on December 10, 1852,
Mr. Wentworth, in the scornful and haughty tone he could so well
employ&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"had no hesitation in stating that the express object
of the clause alluded to, was to prevent the separation of
Moreton Bay and the erection of that insignificant depôt into an
entrepôt for the convicts of the mother country. He did not
suppose there could be any question as to the policy of
preventing a few individuals from becoming the tools of the
Colonial Minister, and thereby aiding the stealthy introduction
to this colony of that class of persons."</blockquote>
<p>Even great talents cannot cover inconsistency like that thus
shown by a politician who had been one of the most prominent
advocates of transportation during the best years of his life.
Whether his oratory or other feelings prevailed most, cannot be
even conjectured now, but the language generally used towards the
petitioners can scarcely be described as other than most
insulting, and the printing of the petition was negatived on a
miserable technicality by a vote of twenty-six to six. As soon as
information of these proceedings reached Brisbane, a meeting was
held, and another petition adopted on the same subject, to be
presented when the Council should meet again.</p>
<p>There were in those days subjects of mirth, as well as of
grave consideration to be derived from politics. The resignation
of Mr. F. E. Bigge having left the electoral districts of Wide
Bay, the Burnett, and Maranoa, unrepresented, a nomination
meeting was called, to be held at Ipswich, and on the day
appointed, the returning officer and three electors are said to
have attended, who were assisted by the counsel of two legal
gentlemen. Mr. R. J. Smith, happening to come that way, held a
conversation with one elector and one lawyer, and the result of
their deliberations was, that Mr. Cameron proposed, and Mr.
Douyere seconded that gentleman as a fit and proper person to
represent the constituency. Mr. W. B. Tooth then nominated Mr.
Foster, of Wide Bay, but, as there were only two electors present
besides himself, and both were pledged to the first nominee, he
failed to find a seconder. Mr. R. J. Smith was therefore declared
duly elected. That gentleman, in returning thanks, expressed
himself as determined to perform the duties of a representative
faithfully and assiduously, and said that he only came forward at
the eleventh hour to rescue the electorate from
non-representation. It is reported that those present gave three
cheers for him. It would not, I imagine, in so small an assembly,
be difficult to secure unanimity, but how they could maintain the
necessary gravity, it is not so easy to conceive. The whole
procedure, coupled with the failure of the steam company, was
made good use of thereafter, in Sydney, against the district and
its claims. What sort of feeling there was as to the position and
duties of a member of Parliament, may be gathered from the fact,
that the journals deplored that at the impending meeting of the
Council, on May 10, only two out of the five members for the
district, were likely to attend the opening.</p>
<p>This paucity of attendance was the more to be regretted,
inasmuch as it was known that, in that coming session, the New
South Wales Constitution would, in all probability, be finally
settled for submission to the Imperial Parliament, and the
publication of some very important despatches from the Colonial
Office rendered the settlement of its terms a matter of more than
ordinary care. One from Sir John Pakington, in answer to the
petition for separation, intimated that the Government "did not,
at present, see any sufficient reason for separation." The
second, in reply to a memorial from the Legislative Council of
New South Wales, proposed to concede to the local Government the
power of dealing with the waste lands of the Crown, denying any
absolute right in those lands, on the part of the inhabitants of
a colony, but treating the matter as one of expediency. With
reference to the constitution of the Legislature, the
desirability of a nominee Council and an elective Assembly, was
admitted&mdash;"assuming that this is a change as to the
expediency of which general agreement prevails." Suggestions were
made as to the kind of civil list which it would be necessary to
preserve, and the despatch concluded by expressing a hope with
reference to the colony, that the proposed measure would "cement
and perpetuate the ties of kindred, affection, and mutual
confidence which connect its people with those of the United
Kingdom." A subsequent despatch from the Duke of Newcastle, who,
when the Derby Ministry went out, succeeded to the Colonial
Office, in general terms confirmed that of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Somewhat in limitation of the complaints I have mentioned, Mr.
J. Smith took the oaths and his seat about a fortnight after the
opening of the Legislature, and in time for the discussions on
the new Constitution Bill, for the framing of which a Committee
of the Council had been appointed on the motion of Mr. Wentworth.
As the Act, resulting from the Bill, is that by which practically
the colony is now governed, its reception and progress may be of
some interest. In its proper place, an abstract of our actual
constitution will be given, and I do not propose to anticipate
that, but simply to describe the changes which occurred in the
measure during its progress, and on its final submission to the
Imperial Parliament, as illustrative of the temper which
prevailed in most men's minds, and of the judgment that was
applied to such subjects, at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth still persisted in the clause which absolutely
fixed the boundary I have before described, and which had so
disquited the people of Moreton Bay. But in the bill, as
originally laid before the Sydney Council, was a proposal which,
as a curiosity in its way, it may be as well to particularize.
The fourth, fifth, and sixth clauses ran, in their abstracted
form, thus:&mdash;4. Power to vest in Her Majesty of appointing
Legislative Councils, provided that no minister of religion or
judge of the Supreme Court shall be eligible. 5. Hereditary
titles may have a seat awarded them for life in the Legislative
Council. 6. When the holders of such hereditary titles amount in
number to fifty or upwards, the present Legislative Council to
cease, and a Council composed of patentees for life, and of a
certain number of elected persons holding such titles, to be
thenceforward the Legislative Council. There were the usual
provisions as to absence, resignation, insolvency, and other
causes by which a seat could be vacated.</p>
<p>It might be difficult now to find any one courageous enough to
bring forward such a proposal. Mr. Wentworth and his
committee&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;were theorists of no
mean order, and did not lack argument in support of their
legislation.</p>
<blockquote>"Your committee," they say, "are not prepared to
recommend the introduction into this colony of a right by descent
to a seat in the Upper House; but are of opinion that the
erection of hereditary titles, leaving it to the option of the
Crown to annex to the title of the first patentee a seat in the
Upper House, and conferring on the original patentees and their
descendants, inheritors of their titles, a power to elect a
certain number of their order, to form in conjunction with the
original patentees then living, the Upper House of Parliament,
would be a great improvement upon any form of Government hitherto
tried or recommended in any British colony. They conceive that an
Upper House, framed on this principle, whilst it would be free
from the objections which have been urged against the House of
Lords, on the ground of the hereditary right of legislation which
they exercise, would lay the foundation of an aristocracy which,
from their fortune, birth, leisure, and the superior education
their advantages would superinduce, would soon supply elements
for the formation of an Upper House, modelled, as far as
circumstances will admit, upon the analogies of the British
Constitution. Such a House would be a close imitation of the
elective portion of the House of Lords, which is supplied from
the Irish and Scottish peerage. Nor is it the least of the
advantages which would arise from the creation of a titled order,
that it would necessarily form one of the strongest inducements
not only to respectable families to remain in the colony, but to
the upper classes of the United Kingdom and other countries who
are desirous to emigrate, to choose it for their future
home."</blockquote>
<p>I can scarcely think that, had the authors of this proposal
read the speeches delivered in the House of Lords in the
discussion on the Canadian Constitution, they could seriously
have thought that it would ever pass the Imperial Parliament; but
Mr. Wentworth was a man of imperious character; and there is
something which strongly warps the perceptions of men in the
intoxication of merely local success. That able politician is not
the only one who, despite of really great powers, finds in a
strange audience the fate of Æsop's musician.</p>
<p>The suggestion to give another representative for the Stanley
Boroughs, and a resident judge for the district, did not
reconcile the settlers to the proposed extinction of their hopes
of separate government, or to the quasi territorial aristocracy
which it was intended to make. A nominee Council in any shape was
indeed highly unpopular throughout New South Wales, and
especially so in Sydney, and delay was asked for an expression of
public opinion before the bill was read a second time. All that
could be obtained, however, was a consent, that were the second
reading agreed to, so that the desirability of two chambers could
be affirmed, the discussion in committee might be postponed for a
moderate period. The feeling in this district against the bill
and its author, was in nowise allayed by his language on the
presentation of the renewed petition for the omission of the
boundaries clause.</p>
<blockquote>"The result of the miserable policy of separation
would be the creation of a federal government, and would
inevitably end in the overthrow of the British throne. If the
people of Moreton Bay had a surplus revenue now, how long had
they been a drag to the Sydney Government? The first thing they
should do with their surplus revenue would be to pay their just
debts before they set up for themselves. The clause in 13 and 14
Vic. he considered to be a degradation of the rights of the
colony and it was the manifest duty of the House to restore the
old boundaries."</blockquote>
<p>It is hardly possible to conceive anger more unreasoning, or
argument more illogical. The debate on the second reading of the
Constitution Bill itself took place on August 31, when Mr.
Wentworth closed it with the last of his great efforts&mdash;a
speech which is said to have drawn cheers from all parts of the
House, the strangers in the gallery included. The second reading
was carried by a majority of twenty-five to a minority of eight,
and the Council soon afterwards adjourned.</p>
<p>About this time news was received in the district, that the
Home Government had received the unanimous petition at whose
adoption the advocacy of transportation had been finally
abandoned, and that no decision had been arrived at. A public
meeting to consider of further representations to the Home
Government, was then proposed; and, accordingly, on November 5,
one described as the largest that had yet been seen in the
district, was held in Brisbane, when men of all classes were
unanimous in their resolutions, and another and lengthy petition
to the Queen was adopted. In support of its prayer, it set forth
that, in all, the revenue derivable from the northern districts
was not less than £70,000 per annum; that the market value of the
stock in them was nearly £2,000,000; that the freehold interest
of the inhabitants was valued at £700,000; that the mineral
wealth was ascertained to be extensively distributed, and only
needed population for its development, and that for this a system
of local self-government was indispensable. This was the eighth
meeting in favour of separation. At a subsequent stage of the
proceedings, a petition against a nominee Council was adopted,
but destined to have little effect.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Council resumed their sittings in
December, when the Constitution Bill was committed. Acting, I
suppose, upon more mature consideration of the law and of the
course that would probably be pursued by the Imperial Parliament;
the hereditary titles clauses were struck out, and the one fixing
thd boundaries of the colony in the event of separation brought
into conformity with the Imperial Act under which the Council was
then sitting. A clause disqualifying ministers of religion was
inserted, and finally the bill, thus amended, passed by a large
majority. It is not to be denied, that the measure thus arrived
at after so much debate and controversy was drawn in a very able
manner. Some few alterations were made in its passage through the
Imperial Parliament, and portions of it have since been repealed,
especially those relating to the suffrage, but in the main it is,
as I have said, the basis of our own Constitution, a short
analysis of its principal provisions may now therefore be
advisable,</p>
<p>In place of the one Legislative Council then existing, it
substituted two chambers, the members of the first or Council,
being nominated by the Crown, and of the second, or Assembly,
elected by the constituencies created by the bill. The electoral
qualification was either the possession of a freehold worth £100,
or a household of an annual value of £10, or a leasehold of like
annual value, or a grazing license, or a salary of £100 per
annum, or the payment of £40 per annum for board and lodging, or
of £10 per annum for lodging only; and the payment of all rates
and taxes, or license fees, that might attach to the property
qualification was made a condition precedent to the exercise of a
vote. The members of the first Legislative Council were to hold
their seats for five years only from the date of appointment, but
all future members summoned after the expiration of the first
five years, were to be members for life, subject to the ordinary
provision for the regulation of vacancies. Any one qualified to
vote in the election of members of the Assembly, was declared
eligible for choice to that body. The President of the Council
was to be appointed by the Crown, the Speaker of the Assembly
being elected by the members. No person occupying a place of
profit under the Crown was to be deemed capable of holding a seat
in the Assembly, unless he were one of the five responsible
Ministers authorised by the Act, or of such additional members
not being more than five as the Governor-in-Council might declare
qualified. The sittings of the Parliament were to be held, at
least, once in each year, and more than twelve months was not to
intervene between any two sittings. The duration of the
Legislative Assembly was to be five years, subject to prorogation
or dissolution by the Governor. The minimum number of the Council
was fixed at twenty-one, one-third of the whole forming a quorum.
The Legislative Assembly was to consist of fifty-four members,
twenty forming a quorum. Power was given to both Chambers to
prepare and adopt such standing orders and regulations as might
seem advisable, and to alter or re-construct the Legislature
itself upon the vote of a majority of the Council, and of
two-thirds of the Assembly. The control of the Crown lands and
revenues derivable from them was vested in the Legislature thus
created, and all duties and revenues were to form a consolidated
fund, out of which the expenditure of the colony was to be
provided, a civil list of £64,300 being reserved, including
£28,000 for public worship. All taxation was to originate in the
Assembly upon message from the Governor, and all payments on
public account were directed to be made by Governor's warrant to
the Treasurer of the colony for the time being. There were
limitations as to the amount of pensions to be granted, and
provisions as to the Courts of Law, with which, as possessing no
special Interest for us at the present time. I shall not trouble
the reader. The Act itself was to come into force one month after
receipt in the colony of the Royal assent to it, and the first
Parliament was to be called within six months from the
proclamation of the measure as law. There was one remarkable
point in the bill. Before that time the land revenues of the
colony had been in great measure specially reserved for purposes
of immigration: thenceforward they would be mingled with the rest
of the public income, and so, gradually, their proceeds passed
into the general routine of appropriation, as the deficiency in
taxation or the temporary exigencies of the public service might
seem to require. That such a plan might be a great relief to a
hard-pressed Treasurer, there can be little doubt. The equal
value of its operation either on the land laws or the financial
administration of the colony, may be more open to question.</p>
<p>The Act once passed, the interest in the new constitution died
out. It went to the mother country, where, after a rather long
interval, it was confirmed by the Imperial Parliament in July,
1855, in the meantime, the attention of the residents in the
northern districts was concentrated more and more upon their own
local matters. The want of labour was still sorely felt, although
six immigrant vessels arrived in the year, and added rather more
than two thousand souls to the population. There was some talk of
obtaining labour from Victoria, but it resulted in nothing;
meantime, wages were high, and the trade of the settlement seems
to have been improving. A new Immigration Act, which was passed
during the session, was expected to effect a great deal in the
way of initiating a self-supporting stem; but it was harsh in
spirit and stringent in regulation. It enacted that every
assisted, or free, immigrant, who should not, within fourteen
days after arrival in the colony, have re-paid in full the cost
of his or her passage out, might be indented to any competent
employer, for the period of two years, whether such immigrant
consented to the arrangement or not. The employer was to pay half
the cost of the passage at the time of hiring, and the other half
at the expiration of twelve months; the servant was not allowed
to cancel the engagement until a year's service had been
rendered, and then only if the amount due for the passage had
been fully paid-up. The system soon failed, very few of the
immigrants paying the money, and the forced indenting being
highly unpopular with them&mdash;as was indeed only to be
expected. The regulations of the Colonial Office did, to some
extent, neutralize the bad impressions thus created, purchasers
of land in the colony being entitled to have eighty per cent. of
their purchase money applied towards the passage of such
emigrants as they might nominate, provided that the rules as to
eligibility in other respects were observed. As to those who had
arrived in the district, there was a deficiency in the number of
single male adults, and some difficulty being temporarily
experienced in placing out the families and single females, it
was suggested that the latter should be transhipped to Sydney
where there was a great demand for domestic servants. Captain
Wickham, however, was able to dispense with this assistance.
There was considerable reluctance on the part of New South Wales
to admit the labour absorbing power of the district, and the
representations of the Government had an influence with the land
and emigration commissioners, which all the exertions of Mr. Hope
and Mr. Leslie, although vigorously and persistently made, could
not quite overcome.</p>
<p>There were still longing eyes cast towards the goldfields of
the neighbouring colonies, and much hope was entertained that the
visits of the Rev. W. B. Clarke and Mr. Stutchbury, the
Government geologist, would result in some discovery of note, but
the hope proved a vain one. To stimulate exertion, a number of
the residents subscribed towards a reward fund, amounting in the
whole to more than £2,800, to any one who could produce proof of
the existence of a payable gold mining district. Now and then a
strong rumour quickened the public attention&mdash;Pikedale,
Cunningham's Gap, and the Burnett, all furnished their quota of
report, but in report it ended. In the steady pursuit of less
sensational industries, the settlers found some consolation. The
yield of cotton increased; agriculture began to assume something
like a definite position, the late Mr. Donald Coutts, who had
purchased Bulimba from Mr. McConnell, being recorded as a
successful cultivator, and raising at the rate of thirty bushels
of wheat to the acre on his farm there. A horticultural society
was formed, and a horticultural show held, which is reported as
successful. The saw mills got into working order. Lemonade and
soda water had hitherto been imported from Sydney, but this year
a machine was brought to Brisbane, and a manufactory established;
soap boiling, candle-making, and brewing were added to the
industries of the place; and Mr. T. B. Stephens saw his way to
the establishment of a local fellmongery; while ever and anon I
note the triumphant tone with which the local journals record the
rise in the value of town property, and of stations in the
interior. The fine station of Westbrook changed hands this year,
having been purchased from Mr. Hughes by the late Mr. J. D.
M'Lean, for £15,000&mdash;the rate per sheep being about fifteen
shillings. For Canning Downs £50,000 is said to have been offered
and refused. The then restless activity of Dr. Hobbs brought the
dugong oil into notice as a curative agent in consumption, and
with some share of success. Whatever might be the opinion
entertained of them by the Sydney people, the residents showed
their faith in their own district by a ready purchase of Crown
lands whenever an opportunity offered. At one sale I read of
£15,000 being invested in that direction&mdash;no small sum for
so limited a population. Nor did the capitalists of the parent
colony neglect the opportunities opening to them. The Joint Stock
Bank, the Union Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Australasia,
all found their way here, and that it paid them to do so. Moreton
Bay began to figure conspicuously upon the Government estimates;
the total vote for the year was nearly £25,000 for local
purposes, including £3,000 towards the erection of a lighthouse
at Cape Moreton&mdash;a vote indicative of the increased
importance of the port. Less satisfactory was the appropriation
of £9,139 to the native police. The blacks seem to have been upon
the whole less troublesome. One of them, confined in Brisbane
gaol, on a charge of murder, contrived to escape, and made his
way to the Maranoa, where he was again caught and brought back.
More alarming to the district, was the news of a desperate gang
of convicts who had escaped in an open boat from Norfolk Island,
having landed in the bay and commenced a new career of robbery
and violence. Immediate and energetic measures were adopted for
their capture, which, after some delay, was effected; and they
were tried at the Circuit Court and sentenced to what must have
been, in effect, a life-long imprisonment. What that class of men
attempted by open violence, others, and on a much larger scale,
did by fraud; and what is, perhaps, one of the most impudent
deceptions on record, is exposed in the newspapers of the day.
When the gold discoveries in New South Wales had sufficiently
stirred the English public, a Sydney speculator prepared to take
advantage of the excitement. Assuming to be the owner of a large
extent of auriferous country, which had twenty miles frontage to
the Hunter River, and was exceedingly rich in the precious metal,
he issued a prospectus of a company, with, I think, 100,000
shares of £1 each, to work the favoured locality. He found no
difficulty in disposing of seventy-five thousand shares, and made
a bargain that he should be credited with twenty-five thousand
fully paid-up as in purchase of his interest. Of these he
realised £11,000 worth, and depositing £4,000 worth of scrip with
the directors, borrowed £2,000 more. He then returned to New
South Wales, to which colony he was followed by two
representatives of the company, who were sent out to protect its
interests. They soon found that they were appointed to a
sinecure. There was no gold on the Hunter River, and no twenty
miles of frontage available. What they did find, was an
unprofitable equity suit, and a great deal of sympathy, which did
not restore the lost capital, and merely left them to bewail
their own and their friends' credulity.</p>
<p>The comparative merits of Cleveland and Brisbane were still
debated, the Ipswich people and the Darling Downs squatters
taking most interest in Cleveland. At this day we look back upon
the bitterness with which the question was disputed with
something like wonder, but the controversy was waged with great
heat then, and as if the existence of the older township was
really endangered. Town allotments at Cleveland found a ready
sale, as indeed did land of every description, and the
disposition to buy was helped by the facilities which the
establishment of local land offices afforded. There was some
discontent felt at the refusal of the Government to hold the Port
Curtis land sales at Brisbane, instead of at Sydney, a great deal
of interest being felt in that portion of the country at the
time. Intending squatters pushed out; the Fitzroy was explored
for some distance, and the country declared good, while the
beauties of the harbour at Gladstone were highly eulogised. The
reports of the Government surveyors were more than usually
favourable, even as to the capabilities of the soil for
cultivation. Some curiosity was excited by Mr. W. B. Tooth's
bringing into Brisbane samples of wheat grown by him at Widgee
Widgee, and Woonga, in the Wide Bay District&mdash;the next to
the Port Curtis one&mdash;of whose qualities the local journal
speaks well; but I do not learn that the experiment was followed
up. It is, nevertheless, now that the country in that direction
is being rapidly occupied by selectors, worth recording; for what
has been done once might be done again. Westward the township of
Dalby was proclaimed, and the little village of Gayndah began to
hold up its head and talk of its central position. Cabbage Tree
Creek had now become Sandgate; but improvement had its perils in
those days. Mr. Thos. Dowse and his sons, camping there
preliminary to more permanent occupation, were attacked by the
blacks, and compelled, after some sharp fighting, in which Mr.
Dowse was much hurt, to leave the place.</p>
<p>Altogether, there was no little activity in the settlement
about this time, and promise of what it might, under good
government, become. The exports for the year more than realised
the anticipations of the Separation Committee, who had estimated
them at £400,000, the summary being as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The increase in the export from Brisbane was more than
£80,000, but the bulk of all the trade was still pastoral
produce; the number of bales of wool from this port alone being
7,968 in the year whose history I am writing. With so growing a
trade the impediments in the two rivers&mdash;the Bremer and the
Brisbane&mdash;began to be felt as serious hindrances, and
meetings were held, and petitions to the Sydney Government
signed, for a grant of money for their removal. This was refused,
but a survey was promised to obtain data for estimating what the
cost would really be.</p>
<p>I have said that the little town of Gayndah began to put forth
it pretensions, but the fact would be hardly worth mentioning,
were it not that one of our foremost public men of the present
day, Mr. W. H. Walsh, made the first entry into his public life,
which I find on record, at the meeting held there to protest
against the claims of Brisbane to be the metropolis. Those of
Port Curtis were insisted upon with considerable
vehemence&mdash;a vehemence which redoubled when the demerits of
Moreton Bay were descanted upon. A petition was addressed to Her
Majesty praying that Port Curtis might be the capital, which,
seeing that Separation itself was at yet far distant, was, at
least, taking time by the forelock It is amusing to read the
grave statement in that petition, that "the site of the town of
Brisbane is universally allowed to have been so ill-chosen as to
forbid its ever rising into a city of any importance."
Politicians and historians may well be wary of prediction. Mr.
Walsh and his co-adjutors had been preceded by much more rash
prophets. In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for September, 1786,
I read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It has been seen in the public prints, that a plan
for forming a settlement in New Holland, for the restriction of
transported criminals, is actually to be carried into execution,
but the plan is so wild and extravagant, that we can hardly
believe it would be countenanced by any professional man after a
moment's reflection. Not the distance only, but the almost
impracticability of crossing the line with a number of male and
female criminals, who, in their cleanliest state, and as much at
large as can with safety be allowed them in prison and with
frost, are hardly to be kept from putrid disorders, must for ever
render such a plan abortive. The rains, tornadoes, and heats that
accompany these tempests near and under the line, are often fatal
to the hardiest navigator, besides the mountainous seas that are
almost always to be encountered in passing the Cape and in the
latitude which the transports must pursue their course to New
Holland. No man, surely, who had a life to lose, of a relative or
a friend that he wished ever again to see, would engage in so
hazardous an undertaking. . . . Add to these objections that the
natives are the most savage and ferocious that Captain Cook met
with in exploring the coast of New Holland!"</blockquote>
<p>And yet the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> was wont to be
considered sedate, scholarly, and trustworthy periodical.</p>
<p>The year 1854 was not an eventful one in the history of the
district Complaints of a deficiency of labour became rife once
more, and the usual consequences of such a condition followed.
Land was bought only to remain idle on the hands of the
purchaser. Houses were scarce and rents exorbitant, while skilled
mechanics were in great request, and in some localities not to be
obtained. Hope was entertained of an introduction of Germans,
through the exertions of Mr. Lord, of Drayton, who went to Europe
with the intention of initiating a regular emigration from the
German States, but the ultimate result remained to be disclosed.
Some interest, therefore, was felt in the possible success of Dr.
Lang's Moreton Bay Land and Emigration Company, which he once
more pushed forward with his usual vigour, and with more than his
usual discretion. While in England, from which he had not long
returned, he had corresponded and talked with all classes of
intending emigrants, and he brought with him petitions to the
Legislative Council of New South Wales, from a variety of
associated bodies, who, having been informed by him that a fund,
arising from the sales of Crown lands, was available for the
assistance of emigrants, desired to benefit by it in payment of
the cost of their passages. He now proposed specially, in the
interest of the district, the establishment of the company I have
named, with a capital of £250,000&mdash;capable of increase, as
circumstances might seem to justify&mdash;in shares of £25 each,
one half being reserved for allotment in the mother country, the
remaining half to be sold in the colony. Taking advantage of the
land regulations I have before described, the capital was to be
applied to the purchase of land, so that eighty per cent., at
least, of the purchase money should be appropriated to the
introduction of immigrants. The profit of the company, would, it
was supposed, accrue from the gradual increase in the value of
the land thus bought. Reputable emigrants, he suggested, should
be allowed to buy land at an advance of twenty-five per cent. on
the price paid by the Company to the Government, but the
shareholders were to be allowed, if they thought proper, to take
up land to the amount of their shares at the cost price. There
was a good deal of sound sense and thorough security in the plan;
and it met with general approval here. He found no difficulty in
organising a provisional committee, of which Mr. James Gibbon,
now a member of our Legislative Council, was secretary; Mr.
Macalister, lately Premier, and afterwards Agent-General of the
colony, solicitor; and Mr. R. D. Somerset, treasurer. He
addressed large audiences both at Brisbane and Ipswich, in
speeches in which strong common sense and vigorous argument were
mixed up with, and damaged by, much unnecessary virulence and
sarcasm, but still with great success. The company seems to have
got, so far as preliminaries were concerned, into something like
a workable shape, and in due time a bill for its incorporation
was brought into the Legislative Council, when a warm debate took
place, which, unfortunately, resulted in its rejection by a
majority of two. Nine elective members&mdash;amongst them the
late Sir C. Cowper, Sir James Martin, and Mr. Parkes&mdash;voted
for it; the majority was composed, with the exception of two, of
members of the Government and nominees. Dr. Lang informed the
people of Moreton Bay of the result in a characteristic letter,
more angry than usual in its terms, and therefore more
mischievous in its results.</p>
<p>But in his first election for the County of Stanley, he had
had to sustain a struggle which, if experienced by many, would
have caused them to exclaim, in the language of the prophet, of
old, "I do well to be angry." Mr. John Richardson, who had, from
the commencement, represented the county, having resigned his
seat, the most ardent advocates of separation nominated Dr. Lang,
while the squatters and their friends put forward Mr. Arthur
Hodgson in opposition to him. Dr. Lang left the district before
the nomination on April 24, and Mr. Hodgson had the hustings to
himself. At the polling, the opposition between Brisbane and
Ipswich, which had been for some time increasing, became more
strongly marked, the doctor, who had a large majority in
Brisbane, obtaining only one vote in Ipswich. The result gave him
a majority of nine; but, at a later period, it was discovered
that Drayton, on the Darling Downs, had been made a polling
place, although it was outside the electoral boundary; and, by
some extraordinary process, votes were ordered to be taken there
on May 23&mdash;the day appointed for the election in the writ
being April 28. As was expected, Mr. Hodgson obtained the greater
number, and the votes became equal, upon which the returning
officer gave his casting vote in favour of that gentleman. The
whole procedure gives one an odd notion of what could be done in
those days.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang petitioned the Council against the return, and the
result was, that Mr. Hodgson was unseated. At the nomination
which preceded the consequent fresh election in August, both
candidates were present, and both spoke at length; Mr. Hodgson
complaining of Dr. Lang's coarse vituperation in language still
more coarse, and Dr. Lang retorting with more vigour than grace.
At the poll, finally, Dr. Lang was returned by a majority of one.
There was some talk of petitioning against the election, but it
died out; what the doctor complained most of, and I think with
justice, was, that after he had been successful in his petition
to annul the first return, he had been mulct in £121 for
costs&mdash;which was the penalty, I presume, for an unpalatable
success.</p>
<p>He was not long in exerting himself on behalf of separation.
On September 18, he moved for an address of the Legislative
Council to Her Majesty, praying for the immediate separation of
the Moreton Bay District from the colony of New South Wales. Mr.
Stuart Russell seconded the motion, but Mr. Leslie opposed it,
and Mr. R. J. Smith moved the previous question. On a division,
the doctor was defeated by a majority of twenty-three to
seven.</p>
<p>Reverting to the subject of immigration, some slight relief to
the demand for labour was afforded by the arrival, in August, of
two immigrant ships in the bay&mdash;the <i>Monsoon</i>, with
304, and the <i>Genghis Kahn</i>, with 474, immigrants. They were
soon all engaged, with little perceptible diminution in the
requirements of the district. In December, another vessel, the
<i>General Hewitt</i> arrived with 331 more, who were rapidly
absorbed in the general population. These were all "assisted"
immigrants, liable to engagement on the terms I have before
described, and were not so well contented with the new system as
were its framers, which is not much to be wondered at. In his
speech at the opening of the Council in June, Sir Charles Fitzroy
stated that the Emigration Commissioners in London found such
great difficulty in carrying that system out, that the old one
would have to be returned to. What was of more present value to
the residents, was an allusion, in the same speech, to the wants
of the district, and a recommendation of a provision for at least
some of them.</p>
<p>Such a reference, no doubt, sprang from a visit paid to
Moreton Bay by the Governor in the preceding March. On the 20th
of that month he arrived in the bay in the <i>Calliope</i>,
man-of-war; landed at Newstead, the then residence of Captain
Wickham, and rode next day into Brisbane, where he received
deputations, made quiet and guarded speeches, and went through
the tribulations incidental to Governors' progresses. Thence he
travelled on horseback, by way of Drayton, to the Darling Downs,
returning through Warwick and by Cunningham's Gap to Brisbane,
where he was entertained at what is described as "the first
public dinner given in Moreton Bay," and waited upon by the
earnest advocates of separation, and upon both occasions managed
to steer clear of embarrassing promises. After nearly three
weeks' stay in the district, he left for Port Curtis, and, after
a short inspection, returned to Sydney. One good result of his
visit, was the restoration of the old botanic garden to its
former use, and the commencement for it of a career of utility
which has gone on increasing till the present time.</p>
<p>Visitors of lower station, but of greater service, came to the
district. Mr. Moore, the director of the Botanic Gardens. Sydney,
visited Brisbane, both to extend his own knowledge and to
determine what was required to restore the gardens here. The Rev.
W. B. Clarke, the celebrated geologist, made an exploratory tour
through the Darling Downs, down the range, and on the lower part
of the route to Brisbane. Primarily, his visit was to ascertain
the probability of a payable goldfield being found. On that head
he reports:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing but the overlying deposits of the
carboniferous formation and the trappean alluvia, which cover
nearly the whole of the Darling Downs District, and, as before
stated, the country beyond, about the heads of the waters falling
into the Fitzroy Downs, &amp;c., prevent the occurrence of a
goldfield in the parallel of 28°. . . . As respects the lower
regions in the Downs, it is possible for gold to be found here
and there, but, if it is ever obtained in more than
inconsiderable quantity, it will require far more energy and
determination than the talkers about it have yet
exhibited."</blockquote>
<p>There should be encouragement to the old deep-sinking miners
in these observations. On the existence of tin ore Mr. Clarke was
far more decided:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I may, however, remark, that though gold be wanting,
there are gems and tin ore in many localities, of which little
account is taken; but which may, perhaps, be one day as valuable
as gold. Respecting the tin ore, I may state that I found it in
almost every mass of drift in every portion of the country I have
explored for gold, and that it is frequently abundant where gold
is wanting. It exists in all the western streams, from the Peel
to the Condamine, and it was equally common in the southern
districts."</blockquote>
<p>It seems odd, that seventeen years should have been allowed to
elapse before the value of this opinion was tested; and even
then, only to a partial extent.</p>
<p>The land sales went on with unabated vigour. When the Port
Curtis lots were sold in Sydney, there was the usual
<i>furore</i> to buy on rumour what few or none of the purchasers
had seen. The prices realised were very large, many of the town
lots selling for £200 each. One lot of twenty-two perches brought
£270; another of thirty-three perches, £370; and another, a
little larger, £455. It was calculated that the aggregate upset
price of all the land offered at the first day's sale, was about
£340, but the total proceeds that day were £9,368. On the second
day the amount realised was £3,497, making a total of £12,865.
Cleveland, the other possible rival of Brisbane, as it was once
deemed, seems to have commenced its decline&mdash;a mercantile
firm, which had established itself there, leaving the place, and
the bonded store being removed. In the district itself, land was
always a marketable commodity. In Brisbane, for instance, on one
day at a sale of town and suburban lots at that town and at
Sandgate&mdash;land to the value of £5,136 was purchased. There
were several suburban lots at Bulimba advertised, but withdrawn
on a report from Mr. Stutchbury, the Government Geologist, that
coal existed there. Land seems, indeed, to have been nearly the
only opening for the investment of savings. In 1854, there were
no theatres, no musical or public entertainments, no cabs, but
few hotels, and, apparently, little or no extravagance. The
surplus earnings of the industrious went into the purchase of
property, and if, from the want of labour, they could not utilize
that property as rapidly as some of them wished, they at least
escaped the risk of over expenditure, and enjoyed the pleasure of
accumulation.</p>
<p>The efforts at what may be called local improvement, now began
to take a more decided and definite shape than they had hitherto
done, and the criticisms on local and Governmental management
became more precise and stringent. After many applications a road
surveyor&mdash;Mr. Vigors&mdash;was appointed for the district by
the Government. A Savings Bank Bill was introduced into the
Council and passed, and the estimates bore token that the
northern country, as it was then called, was gradually improving
in the esteem of the Central Government, as they rose from about
£25,000 in the preceding year to nearly £33,000 in this. A
superintendent for the floating light at the northern entrance of
the bay&mdash;it is said to have been a discarded vessel, which
had been used for a similar purpose in Port Jackson&mdash;and
four light keepers are among the items. The expenses of the
Native Police bore a large proportion to the total, more than
£16,000 being voted for them from the Clarence River to Port
Curtis. But, excepting £500 for improving the town of Brisbane,
there was little or nothing for what might be called public
works. These were in anticipation, especially for the bay and the
river. A memorial was sent, praying for a grant of £10,000
towards clearing the bar, and £5,000 for a dredge,&mdash;and on
November 7, the Governor, by message, recommended that £15,000
should be so appropriated. In a reference to the requirements of
the harbour, in a report of the committee of the Legislative
Council upon the state of the public works of the colony, I find
the deepening of the channel described as of "such importance as
to demand the most favourable consideration." The Government
Resident here recommended a further survey, and it was suggested
that £1,000 should be placed on the estimates, in order that that
might be first completed. A jetty at Cleveland had been
commenced, and to this the committee also turned their attention.
They found that £1.000 had already been voted for the work, and
that £5,197 more would be required. They, therefore, proposed a
suspension of the undertaking until it had been ascertained that
the jetty would afford to the public advantages commensurate with
its large cost. Although of more general interest, still as
having a local application, I may refer to another, although
merely a progress report, from a committee appointed to enquire
into the operation of the laws and regulations respecting the
Crown lands of the colony, in which they embody and approve of
the opinions held by Earl Grey in 1846. In the perusal of that
extract, I can almost imagine myself to be reading a leading
article in a Queensland journal, or a report of the speech of a
Queensland member of Parliament of the present day.</p>
<blockquote>"It is obvious," says his Lordship, "that if those
who now employ the Large runs which are required for the support
of considerable flocks and herds, while the country remains in a
state of Nature, were allowed to acquire a permanent property in
those vast tracts of land, there would very soon indeed be no
land of moderately easy access available for new settlers. I am
aware that, under existing, regulations, complaints have been
made, and not without much apparent foundation, that a difficulty
is experienced by persons, who have accumulated small capitals,
in finding means of purchasing allotments of land of size
suitable to their circumstances, owing to the manner in which the
extensive tracts have been appropriated by large capitalists. In
justice, therefore, to the poorer class of settlers, I consider
it of vital importance, that in allowing wild lands to be
occupied for pasturage, the property of the Crown in those lands
should be effectually protected, so that as they are wanted for
settlement, they may be sold at a price which, while it is too
high to admit of large tracts being obtained possession of by
grasping speculators, is yet sufficiently moderate to throw no
difficulty in the way of the industrious settler, who desires to
purchase and to improve a farm of moderate extent."</blockquote>
<p>I have said that criticism was becoming more precise and
stringent, but it was not so one day before it was required. Two
men in the Harbour Master's Department were sent down the bay in
a boat, manned by six blacks of a tribe known to be hostile to
the whites. They took with them a keg of spirits. All that was
found thereafter was the signs of a sanguinary struggle near
Sandgate, and the men were no more seen. Although large sums of
money had been spent in the purchase of land there, no one dare
build or improve for fear of assaults from the
aborigines&mdash;Mr. Dowse, as I have related, having been
compelled to abandon the attempt. Roads there were none, and the
inhabitants of the two principal towns were unable to obtain
leave to place their streets in a passable condition, while
anything in the shape of assistance from Government was denied
them, or, if promised, never forthcoming. They derived little
consolation from the discovery that, however small the profit
derived from the land they bought, those who sold had the
privilege of skimming the cream from what they paid. The
commissions paid to the Government officers, holding positions
somewhat analogous to those of the Crown Lands Commissioners of
our own time, were so large, as at last to attract the attention
of the Executive Council. Between January 1, and December 19,
1854, Captain Wickham received £973 6s. 8d.&mdash;£473 more than
his salary as Government Resident; and Colonel Gray, at Ipswich,
between June 13, 1853, and June 31, 1854, £236 1s. 10d. The
public justly thought that those gentlemen would have been well
remunerated by much less sums for attending two or three hours
half a dozen times in the year, and that the balance might have
been devoted to some of the local wants which pressed so heavily
upon them. I forbear multiplying instances, but I am constrained
to say, that in most of the official appointments of those days,
the indirect emolument was often more than the direct salary, and
the public service suffered accordingly. The liberality of the
Government to its officials at length became limited to a
commission of five per cent. on all sales below £5,000 in one
year, and two and a-half per cent. on all sales beyond that sum.
It was worth while being a Crown Lands Commissioner, in addition
to other official functions, in the colony of New South Wales in
those days, the Land sales in 1854 having reached more than
£211,000.</p>
<p>The remnant of the exile element and the aboriginal
criminality combined to disturb the generally uniform social
quietude of the place. A brutal murder was committed at Kangaroo
Point, in January, by a man named Hanley, the victim being known
as Stevie Swords. There had been some drinking, and Swords had
left the hut in which it occurred, when Hanley followed him,
felled him to the ground with a heavy paling, and was seen to
strike him afterwards several heavy blows upon the head. The
blows penetrated to the brain. Hanley then went for the police,
and accused one of his companions, who was helplessly drunk, of
the murder. The proof was perfect at the trial, but the presiding
judge, Mr. Justice Dickenson, suggested that "it might be a
matter for the jury how far Irishmen, accustomed to using sticks
in their quarrels, might be supposed to strike a person about the
head without intending to cause death or grievous bodily harm."
The jury did not seem to appreciate the suggestion, and found
Hanley guilty. He was accordingly sentenced to death; but the
Sydney Executive commuted the punishment to five years' labour on
the roads. Perhaps they gave more weight to the assumption of
that well-intentioned kind of beating, suggested by Judge
Dickenson, than the jury could be induced to do. Whether they
did, of not I have thought the case worth noting as one of the
most singular of those old eccentricities of justice with which
the historian of those times gradually becomes familiar; and
which, in equally grotesque form, do occasionally startle us
now.</p>
<p>A more satisfactory instance of the ultimate triumph of the
law was shown in the capture and conviction of a notorious
aboriginal of great strength and cunning, named Dundalli, who,
for years past, had been the terror of the district. In 1845, he
had assisted in robbing the Rev. Mr. Hausmann at Noogan Creek,
and in burning his hut down with the charitable purpose of
burning the inmate as well. He was identified as the murderer of
Mr. Gregor, at Caboolture Creek, as one concerned in the murder
at the same time of a woman named Mary Shannon, and as the actual
murderer of two persons, named Waller and Boller, on the Pine
River. His connection with many other outrages was more than
suspected, but the evidence was difficult to collect. He was
tried at the Circuit Court on November 25, found guilty, and
condemned to death At his execution, in the early part of the
ensuing year, a number of blacks congregated on the Windmill Hill
(overlooking the then town of Brisbane), to whom he called in his
own language with great vehemence, and, as was subsequently
found, exhorted them to revenge his own death. It seems to have
been as if a great burden had been removed from the residents
when it was known that he was really dead. One "Davy," another
aboriginal identified as the murderer of Mr. Trevethan, whose
death I have before mentioned, was also found guilty, sentenced
to death, and hung. There were at that time, two paid chaplains
to the gaol, and other ministers of religion in the town; but it
is related, with the exception of one visit from a Roman Catholic
clergyman, he was left unattended and uncared for, "pushed up the
ladder by the hangman, and precipitated into death," as men would
hang a noisome beast of which they wished to get rid. The
occurrence caused much comment at the time, and deservedly so.
These executions did not deter the blacks from&mdash;perhaps
stimulated them to&mdash;further crime. I find two more murders
by them, recorded during the year.</p>
<p>I turn from these gloomy records, which, however, could not,
as characterizing a particular period, have been well omitted, to
more cheerful topics. The Horticultural Society of Brisbane held
another show, which is said to have been successful; and an
attempt was made towards the establishment of an Agricultural and
Pastoral Association. The Ipswich Library and Reading Room took a
more definite shape, and subscriptions were readily forthcoming
in its support; and, as if the genii of joint stock companies had
been propitiated to the infusion of fresh energy by Dr. Lang's
emigration scheme, the Moreton Coal Company was started at
Ipswich, to commence with a capital of £25,000, in shares of £25
each. The provisional committee was strong in local celebrities,
and Mr. Macalister was secretary, but no locality of operation
was indicated in the prospectus, which seems to have been rather
vague in its tenor. Another company was attempted to be formed,
for the purpose of working the mines opened by Mr. Williams, and
a few land owners co-operated to try the strata asserted by Mr.
Stutchbury to be coal-bearing at Bulimba. Coal seems for a time
to have been as much thought of as gold; unfortunately the
working of the first was for a long time attended with as little
permanent result as the search for the second. Occasional notices
of cotton are met with, mostly in the way of experiment and
report, but about twenty-five bales in all were exported, and
some samples of Moreton Bay cotton, having won the prizes offered
by the New South Wales Government, received the further approval
of the Manchester manufacturers; but, as yet, the industry
remained within its usual limits. There were great speculations
as to what it might result in, but that was a speculative
period&mdash;in theory. I am sorry to have to deprive any of our
local politicians of the least possible claim to originality, and
it is with some regret that I record finding the really first
idea of a railway to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the <i>Australian
and New Zealand Gazette</i> of July 1, 1854&mdash;the proposers
having the usual incorrect notions of our geographical positions,
for they speak of a short line from Carpentaria to Port
Curtis.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical organisations were getting into active
systematic work. After long delays, the Anglican Church of St.
John was consecrated by the Bishop of Newcastle on October 29,
and a district association was formed to co-operate with the
central one at Newcastle for church objects. The Rev. E. Griffith
arrived to take charge of the Independent Church at Ipswich;
there was a movement made towards the establishment of a Baptist
congregation; the Wesleyan had their usual church and missionary
meetings; and the Rev. Mr. M'Ginty went on the usual tenor of his
way in earning the good will of his Roman Catholic flock in
Ipswich, and in initiating subscriptions towards a new chapel for
their accommodation. Turning to more temporal matters, I find
that the first Moreton Bay Building Society ended very
satisfactorily, and the shareholders having received their final
cheques, forthwith proceeded to prepare for the formation of a
second.</p>
<p>In the way of exploration nothing was done. The fate of
Leichhardt created some speculation, but no effort. The closing
speech of Sir Charles Fitzroy on the prorogation of the
Legislative Council referred to some scheme for exploring the
interior of this island-continent by an expedition under the
Imperial Government, and he expressed a hope that, with that, a
search for the lost traveller would be combined. What, perhaps,
more interested the residents of Moreton Bay, was the
announcement, that with reference to the examination of the
Moreton Bay bar, and other public works, he, having received
notice of his recall, left their initiation to his
successors.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, that with the quarter ending March 30,
1854, the usual table of exports ceased for a time, and there
exist no official documents in this colony relating to the years
prior to separation. I gather from the returns published for that
quarter, that from the five districts the totals were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Making a total of nearly ninety-eight thousand pounds, in
addition to which there were the cargoes of two ships in the
Brisbane, loaded, and waiting to sail for London, valued at about
£50,000. The calculation was, that the total export in the year
would exceed in value half a million sterling. The general
character remained the same as in preceding years. Of the
pastoral wealth of the district in 1853, I am able to give a more
authoritative account from the New South Wales statistics, which
were available at that time about seven months after the
termination of the year to which they related. The total live
stock in the districts generally considered as the probable new
northern colony, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the then newly-formed pastoral district of the
Leichhardt, no returns had been received; but the eight districts
enumerated contained a little more than one-fourth of the whole
number of sheep in the entire colony.</p>
<p>Not as directly belonging to the history of this colony, but
as connected with it, I refer to the disastrous result of a
scientific expedition, in which Mr. Strange, formerly a resident
in Moreton Bay, and Mr. Walter Hill, the Superintendent of our
Botanic Gardens, were engaged. On September 12, the ketch Vision,
of fifty tons burden, left Brisbane, having been chartered by Mr.
Strange, who had recently returned from England,</p>
<blockquote>"for the purpose of searching to the northward for
specimens of natural history. . . . The party consists in all of
ten persons, and it is proposed at present to proceed as far as
Cape York, returning, probably, in three or four months. Should
they be sufficiently adventurous, we shall not be at all
surprised to hear of some rich gold discoveries as the result of
their expedition."</blockquote>
<p>Thus far the <i>Courier</i> of the 16th of the same month. The
vessel arrived at the Percy Islands on October 14, and the next
day Mr. Strange, with Mr. Hill, a Moreton Island black named
Deliapy, Mr. Shenks, an assistant, the mate Spurling, and the
cook Gittings, landed to get water. There they met the natives,
and had some apparently friendly intercourse. Fortunately for
himself, Mr. Hill left the party on a solitary excursion, and was
absent about an hour. On his return, he found a naked body
amongst the mangroves, which turned out to be that of Spurling,
who was quite dead; he next came upon Deliapy, who was hidden in
a cleft of the rocks, and who, by degrees, managed to inform him
that the others had been murdered. Mr. Strange having in the
struggle shot one of them. Only that gentleman, as I gather, was
armed at the time. The two managed to get to the boat, and pulled
to the vessel. On proposing a further search, none but the master
would venture, and, after lying off the island four days, without
seeing any sign either of the natives or of their late
companions, they made sail for Brisbane, where they arrived on
November 14, to narrate their melancholy tale.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> year 1855 was, in some respects, a
memorable one in the history of Moreton Bay. During its progress
the local animosities, which had for some time past been
smouldering, broke out into an open flame, heightened by the
efforts of some who hoped to reap their own profit from the
dissension; by others in the narrow-mindedness that can see no
world beyond the limits of its own circle, and no praise worthier
than the little adulation that it can offer for a short hour; and
by some who, in pure ignorance, followed the guidance of those
who should have read them a better lesson. In the face of a
formidable opposition to the separation which all professed to
wish for&mdash;an opposition which was certain to tax their
united energies, they began to squabble over the distribution of
the good which, when it did come, it might bring. In their mutual
depreciatory vituperation, the common opponent found argument
against their common interest, and I do not doubt that the
accomplishment of the desired end was delayed at least a year by
these unfortunate dissensions. They were, in some respects, the
natural result of the old system of government, in which the
central authorities were not only the dispensers of all
patronage, but teachers of the people to hug their dependence in
the hope of getting their full share of what was to be dispensed;
the nearer the capital, and the more closely connected with it,
the greater the chance of a satisfactory participation. The
combatants for that distinction did not see that it would take
long years, even after separation might be granted, to finally
determine the point in dispute, and that the course of trade and
its ultimate development would have far more influence in fixing
the permanent site of the metropolis than the new locality of
political administration. They had not read the manly and
sagacious reply of an old Lord Mayor of London to James I., when,
in a fit of ill-humour at the absence of an expected subsidy, the
king threatened to remove the capital. "Your Majesty," said the
stout old dignitary, "will at least please to leave us the river
Thames."</p>
<p>Sir William Denison who had been Governor of Tasmania, landed
in Sydney in January, to take the place of Sir Charles Fitzroy,
who had been recalled. Sir Charles left Sydney by the
<i>Madras</i> on the 28th. Little or no manifestation of feeling
is said to have greeted him the last time he traversed the city,
where he had represented the Sovereign of Great Britain for
nearly eight years; and the adulation which, as I have related in
a former chapter, broke forth on his arrival, no longer swelled
from the lips of would-be parasites, impatient for the good
things to come. Something has been written, and more insinuated,
as to his personal character and conduct, which might have been
partially induced by a weak indulgence to his own family, and was
said to have had some weight with the Imperial authorities from
whom, consequently, he received no further employment. But it
would be unjust to draw too authoritative an inference of that
kind, for there were others of higher capacity and stainless
reputation&mdash;Sir Richard Bourke, for instance&mdash;upon whom
the same fate fell.</p>
<p>Sir William Thomas Denison was a man of a very different
character. Conscientious to the extent of thoroughly carrying out
what he believed to be his duty, not equally accurate in his
perception of what that duty was, or nice in the choice of means
to secure its performance, he was quick in arriving at a
decision, dogged in maintaining it when made&mdash;unless a
superior authority supplied him with the instructions that stood
to him in the place of knowledge&mdash;and impatient both of
opposition and opponents. An indefatigable worker, he meddled
with almost every conceivable branch of government, and
sometimes&mdash;as in his suggestions as to taxation&mdash;with
little benefit to himself or to his Ministers. From engineering
to political science&mdash;from political science to
theology&mdash;from theology back to the details of
administration, his mind was busy, his pen fluent; but his
industry in mastering a subject was less apparent than his
confidence in deciding upon it. These were qualities sure to
bring him into collision with those who were entrusted with
office in what is called responsible Government, who, with
equally strong convictions, had not only to consider the
expediency of forcing, but to question their right to force,
their own views on a people as free to judge as themselves. He
had never appreciated the condition, so pithily expressed by Sir
Henry Barkley, that, in the face of Parliamentary institutions,
he reigned, but did not govern. In demeanour, he was somewhat
abrupt, kindly to his dependents, staunch to his supporters, but
severe and almost vindictive to those who questioned his course.
Ostensibly almost radical in his political principles, he was
thoroughly autocratic in his colonial tendencies. Temperate,
moral, and strict in the observance of his religious duties, and
charitable to the poor, his example was, perhaps, more felt than
followed; but his virtues stood him in good stead with those who
looked only on the surface. The mischiefs that resulted from his
defects we shall trace as this history goes on.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the district, however, seemed content to
anticipate good things from his administration. Addresses of
congratulation upon his accession to office, were the order of
the day. In that from Brisbane, the inhabitants congratulated
themselves on his arrival, dilated on the importance of the
district, and solicited an early visit. Those of the country
localities generally followed the example thus set, but the
Ipswich one was more demonstrative. It assumed that "superhuman
qualifications" would be required to "steer between the Scylla of
Downing Street bureaucracy on the one hand, and the Charybis of
popular discontent and incessant grumbling of the colonists on
the other," but modestly stated that the subscribers would hope
for the best under Sir William's administration, and believed
that he was, "in short, well qualified to put the rusty machinery
of the present colonial Government to rights." Finally, it
pointed out one cause of the unhappy differences between former
Governors and the colonists in the want of sympathy between them.
"Her Majesty's representatives have been amongst us, but not of
us; Government House has ever been surrounded by a
<i>Chevaux-de-frise</i> of conventionalism that has continued to
hold the bulk of intelligence and industry throughout the colony
aloof." I can imagine the grim smile with which a man of Sir
William Denison's character received this combination of lecture
and confidence.</p>
<p>Having discharged these duties, the people betook themselves
to matters of more immediate interest. Mr. Leslie's resignation
rendered an election for the district of Clarence and Darling
Downs necessary, when four candidates appeared&mdash;Mr. Holt, of
Sydney; Mr. Hood, of Talgai; Mr. Gordon Sandeman, and the late
Mr. Thomas de Lacy Moffatt. There was a good deal of acerbity
displayed during the contest; and, before the nomination, it
became narrowed to one between Mr. Hood and Mr. Sandeman, the
others having retired. At the nomination, Mr. John Douglas made
his first appearance in local politics, as the proposer of Mr.
Hood, and met with a negligence, according to the report, which
would indicate that he was not then as well listened to as he
usually is now. The final result of the election was, that Mr.
Hood was returned, by a majority of fifty-six. The constituency
of the Maranoa does not seem to have been well satisfied with the
efforts of its representative. A number of the electors obtained
from him an appointment to meet and discuss certain questions, on
which his conduct was alleged to have been unsatisfactory; but,
when the time came, he failed to attend. A numerously-signed
requisition was then sent to him to resign; but, during the year,
I find no trace of any response&mdash;a sort of acknowledgement,
which produced great discontent amongst the malcontent electors,
but does not seem to have impaired the good humour of their
nominal representative.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council was opened by Sir William Denison, on
June 5, in a speech which travelled over a great variety of
topics. Education, local government, the management of roads and
railways, steam communication with Europe, immigration, convict
discipline, the administration of justice with a special
reference to the establishment of a permanent court at Brisbane,
the defences of Sydney, marriage and registration bills,
goldfields management, payment for public works by loans rather
than by current revenue; these formed some of the subjects to
which he called attention in a speech described as of the
soundest practical character. In his observations, with reference
to railway construction, he advocated a system which should give
an average speed of ten or twelve miles an hour, "by employing
the material which nature has placed at our disposal,"
anticipating that, by these means, the cost of the roads would be
so far reduced, that in some few years, the number of miles of
railway in the colony "may be reckoned by thousands." He
certainly had in his mind the American system, which, in the
States, had been in extensive use, and which, since that time,
has been employed with great success in Canada. The system which
was adopted in America in 1855, has been but slightly modified
since for localities whose population is scattered, and
communication difficult; and it is somewhat deprecatory of our
usual complacency on our progress, to find that it was twenty-six
years after that time before we began to think of the practical
experience of countries in circumstances analogous to those of
our own colony, instead of listening to the theories and
judgments of professional men who never once saw these methods in
their working application.</p>
<p>While the Council was intent on discussing these matters, a
portion of the ceiling of their Chamber fell in, and they were
compelled to adjourn; but not before a bill for the better
administration of justice at Moreton Bay had been brought
in&mdash;that object being supposed to be secured by the
appointment of a judge, to be called the Recorder of Brisbane,
with a primary jurisdiction similar to that of the Supreme Court
(to which a right of appeal was given), and a variety of minor
jurisdictions; the requisite subordinates being duly provided
for. On the reassembling of the Council, Dr. Lang introduced his
bill for the incorporation of the Moreton Bay Land and
Immigration Company, which was referred to a select committee.
Another select committee&mdash;one on immigration, moved for by
Dr. Lang&mdash;was denied, as it is said, because the right
measure had been proposed by the wrong person.</p>
<p>A financial minute of Sir William Denison's, accompanying the
estimates, was submitted to the Council, when the singular
spectacle was exhibited of the Colonial Treasurer, moving that
the House go into committee for Supply, being met by the adverse
motion from the Solicitor-General, that both the minute and
estimates should be referred to a select committee. This
occurrence has always struck me as a curious instance of what
might be attempted by a power which, believing itself to be
right, was not always careful of the means by which the right
might be attained. Sir William Denison, as I have said, was an
autocrat, especially in the Cabinet, and select committees are
more easily manipulated than a whole Assembly; and, looking to
the records of that Governor's career, I am compelled to believe
that the subsequent interpellations of Mr. Parkes, as to who
really was the leader of the Government, were called for. In
these days no such man&oelig;uvres could be attempted, and no
such curious exhibitions be made. Whether the Solicitor-General's
motion was carried or not, I can find no records within the
colony to show, but I infer that it was defeated from the
scattered reports I have. The amounts proposed in the northern
estimates were large, and included some unusual items. For signal
stations between the entrance to the river and the town, £1,000
was set down; £20,000 for a new gaol at Brisbane; £3,000 for a
bridge over Lockyer's Creek; and nearly £800 for wages of men
employed in the construction of works for the provision of water
for the township of Gladstone. But a general feeling seemed to
prevail, that the favourite system of Sir William Denison, local
assessment, was carried too far, and that much was imposed upon
that which might have been upon loan. In the Council itself, a
very determined opposition was made to some of the proposals of
the Government, thirty-four divisions taking place on a proposed
vote of £12,018 for a volunteer artillery corps. As a placebo to
the indignation which Sir William Denison might feel at this
determined opposition, his salary was raised from £5,000 to
£7,000 per annum by a very large majority. A petition from
Ipswich, praying that the lands of Moreton Bay might not be
pledged in a general loan for the public works of the whole
colony, was ordered to be printed, and on September 18, Mr. Hood
moved for the sum of £3,000 "for the purpose of obtaining a
survey and estimate for the construction of a tramroad from the
head of the navigation of the river Brisbane, at Ipswich, to the
Darling Downs, and thence, by way of Warwick, to Tenterfield and
New England," which, however, he had to withdraw. The Moreton Bay
District Court Bill was abandoned, to the great regret of the
inhabitants, but the estimate for the Brisbane gaol was
carried&mdash;the ultimate punishment of offenders being thus,
apparently, of more importance than the adequacy of means to
ensure the justice of their conviction. The last of the old
Legislative Councils, having shown its characteristic obstinacy
in refusing, as far as possible, adequate provision for the
requirements of the district, was prorogued on December 17, and
on the last day of the year, became a recollection. Henceforth
the value of responsible government was to be tried in the colony
of New South Wales. The share of representation allotted to the
north was not very large&mdash;five out of fifty-four.</p>
<p>While these events were passing, a vacancy occurred in the
representation of the Stanley Boroughs, by the resignation of Mr.
Stuart Russell, which was filled up by the election of the former
member, Mr. Richardson, in his place. The principal argument in
his favour, was his uniform adherence to separation, a question,
concerning which the most lively interest continued to be felt in
the district, and which began to attract more and more attention
in Sydney. The Empire newspaper, in an able and temperate
article, advocated the principle; but the dependence of the
residents upon the ultimate decision of the Colonial Office, was
much shaken by advises from England, in which the circumstance of
the previous question having been moved by Mr. R. J. Smith, in
opposition to the resolutions for separation I have described in
a previous chapter, was referred to as exerting a discouraging
effect. The <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> attempted to show the
utter unfitness of the district for self-government, censuring in
very strong terms the apathy of its people as shown in the
failure of all attempts to use their own material resources, and
instancing in most sarcastic terms their inability to work
together in the promotion of even a steamboat company. If I cite
a portion of these observations, I do so in no spirit of
reflection either upon the people of that time or of this;
retrospection may be usefully exercised, and there have been
circumstances, even since separation, to which those censures of
twenty-five years ago might be usefully applied.</p>
<blockquote>"They have never been able to establish a steam
communication with Sydney, but, as much as they desire to be
independent of the middle district, are forced to rely upon a
Sydney company to furnish them with steamboats, and upon Sydney
merchants to undertake their whole external commerce. And even
when an enterprising public company in Sydney comes forward at
considerable risk to provide the lazy folks of Brisbane with
regular steam communication, they cannot do even so much on their
part as to find coals for the use of their steamers. Their great
staple of wool is endangered by the presence of a dangerous
epidemic amongst their sheep, and yet they cannot agree among
themselves as to what measures should be taken to check the evil
and provide against its recurrence. A stock insurance
company&mdash;the obvious remedy&mdash;was talked of, and went so
far as to be organised, but like every similar movement of the
kind in the north, it never survived the issue of the
prospectus."</blockquote>
<p>The local journals met the charges thus made, by insisting
that the want of self-government was the real cause of the apathy
thus charged against Moreton Bay&mdash;a reply that was apposite
enough at the time. It was, however, elicited in the Council,
that despatches had been re-received from Lord John Russell, then
Secretary for the Colonies, requesting the Governor to report
upon the expediency of separating Moreton Bay from New South
Wales, and the erection of it into a separate colony; to which
the Governor had replied that he would report as directed. The
opponents of the measure in New South Wales at once took the
alarm, and the <i>Herald</i> was the first to assist Sir William
Denison in the formation of his opinion, suggesting that extended
municipal institutions would meet all the requirements of the
district; to which a powerful reply was given by the
<i>Courier</i>, in an article, whose merits are such, that I
regret my limits will not permit its extraction; and there, for
the year, the discussion ended. The principle of separation was
regarded on all sides as settled.</p>
<blockquote>"Parliament," said the <i>Sydney Herald</i>, with
regretful bitterness, "has even gone so far as to devise a form
of government for this colony in embryo, and no doubt it would
have performed the same kind office for Pinchgut Island, had Lord
John Russell made the request."</blockquote>
<p>The two questions of the dividing line between the old and new
colonies, and the adjustment of the debt, were all that remained
to be decided; the second has never yet been determined; as to
the first, the unhappy local dissensions were availed of by
watchful opponents to lessen the extent and value of the boon
when it ultimately came.</p>
<p>I have said that the discussion for the time ended; but there
are a few figures which may be well quoted, as showing the
knowledge of the subject and the care with which the late Mr.
Wilkes&mdash;for some years, and at a critical period, editor of
the <i>Courier</i>&mdash;went into the subject. Assuming that the
districts were united in a separate colony, he estimated the
revenue for 1856, at £120,082; the expenditure&mdash;allowing for
a single chamber only&mdash;£3,000 per annum for a Governor;
£1,500 a year for a Judge; £1,500 for a Colonial Secretary;
£1,000 a year for a Treasurer; and for all that was in the Sydney
votes as well&mdash;he calculated £82,154, leaving £39,000
available for immigration. The population, from Port Curtis to
the then supposed southern boundary, including the Clarence and
Richmond Districts, he estimated at 20,000. In the year
1860&mdash;the first after separation&mdash;when our population
was 29,000, the revenue was £182,317, the land returns being
£41,000 more than Mr. Wilkes' estimate; the other increase
arising from miscellaneous items accruing from the great activity
of settlement then displayed. The expenditure of the year 1850,
was £161,000, but £41,000 was allowed for that in the Lands and
Works Department, bringing the remaining outlay down to about
£120,000, which, allowing for the greater extent of country
occupied, and the increase by nearly one-half in the numbers of
the population, may be considered as peculiarly confirmatory of
the soundness of Mr. Wilkes' views. I never had the pleasure of
what may be called a personal acquaintance with that very clever
writer; but it is equally a gratification and a duty to me to pay
this tribute to the care, caution, and accuracy, of which I have
given an instance, with which Mr. Wilkes, during some years, may
be said to have led the contest for separation in the district;
and none the less, that when the usual formal compliment has been
paid to the "Press." the members who have illustrated its value
and adorned its history, are thereupon, and as a matter of
course, forgotten. They may, of all men, apply to themselves the
somewhat mournful language of Edmund Burke&mdash;"What shadows we
are and what shadows we pursue."</p>
<p>Immigration came in more regularly, but yet not in sufficient
quantity to meet the growing requirements of the times. Seven
vessels, in all, arrived from the United Kingdom, bringing about
2,500 souls to add to the population; and to these were added a
considerable influx of Germans, mainly through the agency of a
Hamburg firm&mdash;Messrs. Godefroy and Sons. Mr. Lord, who left
Moreton Bay for the purpose of engaging a continuous supply in
Germany, upon a special agreement, found, after he had been some
time in that country, that his authority had been superseded,
through the agency of the Messrs. Godefroy's representative in
Sydney, and that, so far from that firm co-operating with him,
they were, in reality, acting in direct opposition to his
efforts; his mission, therefore, was a failure. In all, four
German vessels seem to have arrived in Moreton Bay, bringing
nearly a thousand souls. There were great complaints macre as to
the victualling of some of these ships, and the general
arrangement appears to have been defective. One of them, the
Aurora, coming into the bay by the South Passage, went on shore
on the sea-side of Moreton Island, where she became a total
wreck, but no lives were lost.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang was active in the promotion of his own scheme, and
the bill for its realisation, as I have said, was introduced into
the Council, and referred to a select committee, who reported
unanimously in its favour, and it passed through its subsequent
stages by the assiduous exertions of the late Sir Charles Cowper.
It had been deprived of the energetic advocacy of its originator
through a series of misfortunes which caused great excitement at
the time, and on one at least of those subjected to them,
exercised a very melancholy and depressing influence. Two young
men, one of whom was, I think, the sole surviving son of Dr.
Lang, were placed in charge of the branch Bank of New South Wales
at Ballarat, Victoria, and while so acting, it was discovered
that a very large sum of money, at least £10,000, was missing.
The two were immediately arrested. There was also a man named
Burchell, in whose care the bank had been left at various times,
but who was not interfered with, and soon disappeared; a
circumstance which ought to have directed suspicion towards him,
especially as no trace of the missing money, in connection with
the accused, was ever found. The prosecution, however, was
pressed on with a haste and severity that gave to it a character
of unnecessary vindictiveness, and was strongly commented upon in
the journals of the time; while Dr. Lang, never very reticent in
the expression of his feelings, was more than usually outspoken
in defence of his son. Ultimately, both the young men were found
guilty&mdash;after a trial which seems to have provoked no small
angry and hostile comment&mdash;and sentenced to a long term of
imprisonment with hard labour. The exasperated father, for some
bitter observations on the conduct of the case, was tried before
the Supreme Court, at Melbourne, and acquitted. Subsequently, Dr.
Lang was prosecuted by Mr. Stewart, the manager of the Bank of
New South Wales in Sydney, for libel, arising from a like cause,
and sentenced by the Chief Justice, Sir Alfred Stephen, in an
address savouring far more of the animosity of an offended
opponent than the dignified impartiality of a judge, to six
months' imprisonment&mdash;a sentence which, under all the
circumstances, caused no small surprise and censure. Petitions
soon flowed in to the Governor for a remission, but Sir William
Denison was one of those whose righteous anger against an offence
was in no way diminished by the fact, that the criminal was also
an offender against himself, and he was proof against every
appeal. The doctor offered to resign his seat in the Council as
one of the representatives of this district, but his
constituents, so far from accepting his resignation, were urgent
in remonstrances in his favour. Nor was the general sympathy with
him decreased by the unexpected discovery of the real plunderer
of the bank in the man Burchell, before referred to. A chain of
irrefragable proofs, originating in a chance visit of a
well-known Melbourne merchant and auctioneer to the West of
Ireland, and confirmed by one of the fellow passengers of
Burchell on his voyage home, established his guilt, and the
innocence of the two young men, who were shortly afterwards
released. In no place was this result hailed with more pleasure
than in the locality of their presumed crime, in which I am
aware&mdash;and I speak from personal knowledge&mdash;not one in
a thousand ever considered them guilty. I do not read that any
species of compensation was ever tendered to either father or son
for the sufferings to both, which a more careful and patient
investigation at the first trial, and less haste to secure a
conviction, would probably have prevented.</p>
<p>These troubles, however, never lessened Dr. Lang's ardent zeal
in the cause of immigration; and it was in the midst of his
arrangements for the full organisation of the new company, that
he was called to Melbourne, by the intelligence of the strange
discovery, which ultimately led to the establishment of his son's
innocence. He was not, however, to remain without a competitor.
Sir William Denison submitted a minute to the Executive Council,
embodying his own views. His scheme referred only to the
introduction of labour, providing for the importation by
employers in the colony of what they might require on a prior
payment of a sum equal to about one-fifth of the expense of the
passage, the labourers to be sent being selected by either
friends of the importer, or Government agents appointed for the
purpose. His Executive Council were not quite as receptive as he
was complacent; they would only recommend that the scheme should
be submitted to the Legislature as an experiment, and that the
Immigration Agent should be directed to report upon it. His
report, which was careful and guarded, together with the
Executive minute, were sent to the Legislative Council, and
became embodied in that limbo of suggestions, the annual volume
of Parliamentary papers.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical circles of the district were disturbed this
year in the two leading denominations in the colony. The first
interruption to its ordinary peace occurred in Ipswich, when
certain men, Roman Catholics, were brought up on the charge of
refusing to work on a given day&mdash;the day on which the Feast
of the Epiphany fell. The answer was, that by the doctrine and
discipline of the Roman Catholic Church, that day was a religious
holiday on which no servile work might be done. The course of the
bench, before which the case was tried, was arbitrary and
irregular. They insulted the solicitor&mdash;Mr.
Macalister&mdash;employed by the men; told him before the
complainants' evidence had been half heard, that their minds were
made up; treated what was at most a condonable breach of contract
as a criminal offence, and sentenced the men to a fine of 10s.
each, or seven days' confinement in the cells. The provocation
given by their observations, brought the clergy into the field,
and a very acrimonious controversy on the civil and religious
rights involved, raged for some time, greatly to the advantage of
the newspapers, through their advertising columns, but less to
that of theological information or social peace. I refer to the
case simply as an instance of the arbitrary tendencies of
magisterial courts in those clays. The relative positions of
magistrates and counsel are somewhat altered at the present
time.</p>
<p>In the Anglican Church, a dispute arose among its own members,
which, in its nature, illustrates the changes in opinion which
time silently works on such points. The then clergyman of St.
John's, the Rev. Mr. Irwin, early in the year, introduced the
practice of what is called the offertory into the morning
service. To this certain of the attendants there objected, and in
a meeting&mdash;reported as of twenty-five
persons&mdash;stigmatised the offertory as an "unseemly
observance:" a reflection upon the prayer book itself, in which
it appears as a part of the service. Whether the peculiar
practice might or might not be regarded as unseemly, the
wrangling which took place was certainly not undeserving of the
epithet. The bishop and incumbent were firm; the custom took
root; and I believe, that in every Anglican Church in this
colony, the offertory has become the rule, while in most the
payment for seats is exceptional. While the controversy was going
on, a new Independent Chapel was opened at Ipswich, when it was
announced that the congregation "had adopted the plan of making
all the sittings free, leaving it to each to contribute as God
had prospered him." Thus do extremes meet.</p>
<p>In August of this year, the first steps towards the
establishment of a Baptist congregation were taken, it being
understood that the Rev. C. Smith, of Parramatta, in New South
Wales, would probably become its pastor; and in October I notice
the acceptance of the tender of Messrs. Jeays and Thompson, for
the then new Wesleyan Church in Albert Street, for the sum of
£1,650; while £1,310 had been paid towards the erection of a
Roman Catholic chapel at Ipswich. In all this there was activity,
although at times the zeal might be greater than the
discretion.</p>
<p>But if I am to judge by the newspapers, the anxieties and
interests of the residents were not confined to matters
immediately affecting themselves. The Crimean War was then at its
height, and the journals are not only full of the details of that
varying contest, and the disasters and mismanagement which, at
one period existed, or were supposed to exist, in its conduct,
but the criticisms were as keen, the regrets as pungently
expressed, and the successes as enthusiastically applauded as
they could have been in England itself. And when the Royal
Letter, recommending to her subjects the sufferings and heroisms
of her soldiers as a just cause for subscriptions towards the
relief of their widows and orphans, was read in the colonies, the
response of these districts was warm and free. The duty of the
colonists to subscribe, was insisted upon in language arising
above the usual newspaper level.</p>
<blockquote>"All the events of this campaign," said the
<i>Courier</i>, "are such as to inspire admiration and sympathy,
and his heart must be cold indeed, and hopelessly estranged from
his nation, who would not, to the utmost of his ability, aid the
hapless beings who have been left widows or orphans by the
ravages of disease, or the desperate resistance of a fierce and
warlike enemy, against whom our seamen and troops directed their
arms at the command of their country. In no part of Her Majesty's
dominions are her subjects exempt from this obligation. The
security which has been given to commerce and trade throughout
the British territories by the terror of the British name, and
the adherence of our gallant allies, demands the gratitude of the
Australian colonist no less than that of the British merchant. We
rejoice, therefore, to find that Brisbane is no longer to be left
behind in the race of patriotic emulation."</blockquote>
<p>A meeting was summoned at Brisbane, and immediately followed
by others at Ipswich, Warwick, Drayton, and other portions of the
northern districts, exclusive of the Clarence and Richmond, when
committees, who were working ones in the true sense of the term,
were formed. The news that Mr. Cooper, of Sydney (now Sir Daniel
Cooper), had headed the list there by a contribution of £1,000,
should have been inspiritive of emulation, and was followed here
by one from the late Mr. W. Butler Tooth, of £100. In all, not
including sums paid in Sydney by squatters holding runs in these
districts, £2,570 14s. 4d. were contributed from the districts
immediately connected with Moreton Bay and Wide Bay, in 1855.
Just at the close of the year, the public enthusiasm reached its
height at the news of the fall of Sebastopol.</p>
<blockquote>"The <i>Boomerang</i> steamed up to Brisbane this
afternoon (December 15) gaily decorated with flags, and having
the glorious ensign of old England flying over the Russian flag
at the peak. The repeated firing of cannon as the welcome steamer
came up the river, the cheers of the crew and passengers, and the
enlivening strains of a brass band on board, playing martial and
patriotic airs, prepared the inhabitants, who had assembled in
great numbers, for the glorious news of the fall of Sebastopol,
which they received with hearty cheers."</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, there came no more such sanguinary victories to
raise their ardour; fortunate for us, if in our own time we have
none such at once to welcome and` to mourn.</p>
<p>The blacks and the native police were, as usual, vexatious
topics. An enquiry into the management of the force, disclosed
irregularities, which at one time, threatened its abolition; but
the influence brought to bear for its continuance were too
weighty for such a step to be seriously entertained, and Mr.
Walker, the former Commandant, having been dismissed, Mr.
Marshall was appointed in his stead. In a short time a sergeant
and six troopers were sent to Brisbane to protect the
inhabitants, and to act as a check upon the natives in the
immediate district, a force which was not, however, uniformly
successful in the attainment of the object proposed; and after a
few months' stay, and just as the blacks were becoming more
troublesome, was withdrawn. In the Burnett District the natives
waxed bold and attacked a camp of troopers, killing two and
wounding three; and great discontent was both felt and expressed
at the want of protection to the pioneers in the north and west,
while a war of reprisals, which would necessarily be one of
extermination, seemed imminent. Two white men were murdered at
Wide Bay; two more were attacked with almost as lamentable
results, and stations were robbed and teams plundered, the New
South Wales authorities looking on with the serenity which
exemption from danger inspires, not forgetting to see carefully
to the assessment on stock, the alleged motive for which, was the
payment of a sufficient force to prevent such outrages. The Rev.
W. Ridley, a missionary from the Aborigines Friends' Society, was
not discouraged by all this from making a long journey to the
interior in his endeavours to Christianise the natives, though it
may be doubted whether ethnological science did not benefit more
by his exertions than aboriginal civilization.</p>
<p>In the general progress of the district, there was, as usual,
more of suggestion for the future than positive advance in the
present. Some slight dispute arose over the speech of Mr.
Hodgson, at a farewell dinner given to him in January, previously
to his departure for England. He was eloquent on the rights of
the squatters, inferring from the Orders-in-Council, that they
had acquired a sort of prescriptive permanency of tenure in the
lands they held under lease&mdash;a notion advocated with great
pertinacity at the time in New South Wales and Victoria, although
it had been fully controverted by the late Duke of Newcastle, in
his celebrated despatch of November 23, 1853. But he went still
further, and asserted the utter uselessness of the greater part
of the country for anything else but pastoral purposes.</p>
<blockquote>"Take, for instance," said he, "that immense tract of
country known as the Darling Downs, which feeds nearly one
million of sheep, exclusive of cattle and horses&mdash;who would
be mad enough to attempt cultivation there?" "If it were
practicable, do you think that we would not one and all grow
wheat for our own consumption?"</blockquote>
<p>"Time will not fail to arrive," said the <i>Courier</i>, in
reply, "when the Darling Downs will become as famous for their
agricultural produce as their wool," and time has undoubtedly
proved which was the truer prophet of the two twenty-six years
ago. There was more excuse for Mr. Hodgson in 1855 than for Mr.
Anthony Trollope's foolish dictum, "They can't grow wheat in
Queensland." The Horticultural Society's exhibitions proved even,
in the year of which I am writing, that fruit and vegetables
could be successfully grown on the Downs, and both the soil and
climate were more favourable to the cultivation of those cereals,
which had flourished under less favourable conditions in the
vicinity of Brisbane.</p>
<p>The Port Curtis settlement declined in popularity. The land
sales fell off, and a sharp attack, made by Mr. Parkes, both on
the place and its cost, drew more attention to the settlement
than acquiescence in its utility. A select committee of the
Legislative Council, appointed to inquire into the question,
brought up a report which, on debate, was affirmed as to the
following resolutions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That the appointment of a Government Resident at
Port Curtis by Sir Charles Fitzroy, was an error, which has
already involved the colony in a loss of several thousand pounds
without any determinable public benefit:<br>
<br>
"That the appointment of a Police Magistrate to the town of
Gladstone would be a sufficient provision for securing the ends
of justice and the preservation of order at Port Curtis under
present circumstances:<br>
<br>
"That supposing this change was immediately effected, the
capabilities of the district would have an equal chance of
development, and the progress of the port would be in no respect
retarded."</blockquote>
<p>The Port Curtis establishment had, up to the date of the
report in 1855, cost £22,535. The land sales had realised
£113,729, and there seemed little prospect of further increase of
population; but with the report, I believe, the matter so far
ended. Some compensation was supposed to be in store for this, by
the setting apart of two village reserves on the road from
Ipswich to Drayton&mdash;Alfred and Gatton&mdash;which remained
villages&mdash;on the map&mdash;for some years afterwards.</p>
<p>The residents of Moreton Bay were not unmindful of its wants,
although somewhat antagonistic as to their respective nature and
exigency. The people of Brisbane began to talk about a bridge
across the river, connecting the north and south sides. The first
notion was to form a sort of pontoon bridge, sufficiently high to
admit of river craft passing under the platforms, and to float a
company for its construction. After about a month's
consideration, a meeting was held, at which it was stated that a
capital of £10,000 would be sufficient for the construction of
such a passage way, and a return of £1,000 a year might be
calculated upon, on which the inevitable committee was appointed.
The Governor was appealed to, when it appeared that he
disapproved of the bridge, and suggested a steam ferry. A week's
consideration of this, allowed the enthusiasm to cool
considerably, and the end of the year simply left a record of one
of those numerous commencements which marked the history of
enterprise in Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>However this apathy might be deplored, the people could unite
in welcoming the arrival of Mr. Grundy, an engineering surveyor,
employed by the Sydney Government to make the necessary survey of
the river bar, in order to ascertain the practicability and
probable cost of deepening the channel. Sanguine anticipations of
the advantages that would follow were indulged in. "The survey is
to be commenced immediately, and when, aided by the practical
skill of His Excellency the Governor-General as an engineer, will
set at rest, and, no doubt, favourably, a question of vast
interest to the district." It is necessary here to mention, in
explanation, that in reply to a memorial to Sir William Denison,
respecting the sites of public buildings, he had intimated his
intention of visiting the district and deciding upon them
himself&mdash;a sort of interference with the responsible
executive, which he did not find so practicable as it no doubt
seemed to him necessary. Towards the close of the year it was
announced that other proposals than those suggested in Mr.
Grundy's report, had been laid before the Governor, and that the
consideration of the whole matter would be deferred until he had
had an opportunity of making a personal inspection of the
locality.</p>
<p>The Winter Circuit Court afforded fresh cause of discontent
with the people. It was officially appointed to be held on May
21, but the Australasian Steam Navigation Company having detained
the only steamer available, the Bench and the Bar did not arrive
till the 25th, and plaintiffs, defendants, jurors, and witnesses
were kept dancing attendance fruitlessly during the week. The
advocates of separation found in this circumstance a new argument
in favour of independence. A case at Ipswich strengthened them in
their convictions. Mr. Gill, a storekeeper in that town, had been
convicted before the local board, of using threatening language
to Mr. W. H. Gray, and sentenced to a fine of £5, with the
alternative of three months' imprisonment. The language
complained of formed part of a wordy war in Mr. Gill's own shop,
and not in any public place or thoroughfare. Mr. Gill appealed to
the Supreme Court in Sydney, when the conviction was quashed, but
he had his own costs to pay, a result which proved that, in some
cases, immediate oppression is dearly got rid of by distant
justice; and the inference in favour of a local court was
irresistable. As to the Circuit Court itself, beyond the
annoyance caused by its delay, there was nothing worth noticing
about it.</p>
<p>There was more room for congratulation in the established
practicability of direct shipment from Brisbane to London. The
<i>Gazehound</i>&mdash;a vessel carrying about 600 tons of
cargo&mdash;was loaded at the Messrs. Raff's wharf, fitted and
found for sea, and successfully crossed the bar without, as it
was triumphantly said, the aid of a steamer. The port of Moreton
Bay had already found notice in the Liverpool and London shipping
lists, and it began to be hoped, that to Brisbane itself, a
similar distinction would soon be accorded. The capabilities of
the river&mdash;at one time scornfully stigmatised as a
ditch&mdash;were now not only admitted, but the claims of the
Bremer, at any rate, to the "head of navigation," as Ipswich
began to be called, were put forward. This year may also be
distinguished as the first in which direct shipment from a
Brisbane wharf to a British port, and in a full-rigged ship, was
proved to be practicable. The achievement drew fresh attention to
the defective arrangements for lighting and pilotage. Whether a
buoy-boat, or light-ship, or a pilot were wanting, local
knowledge and requirements were equally overlooked by the Sydney
authorities. A pilot being required, applications were called
for&mdash;and, in due time, notices were issued to the applicants
to attend at the Harbour Master's Office, in Sydney, on a given
day, the notices reaching Brisbane on the day fixed for
attendance. The person ultimately appointed, was a comparative
stranger, and knew nothing of the river channels, his chief
recommendation being, apparently, that he had lost a ship in the
bay. There was some occasion for the sarcastic local
recommendation, that, if ever a new iron lighthouse, said to have
been ordered for Moreton Island, did arrive in Sydney, it should
forthwith be appropriated there, and some old worn-out grate sent
from Newcastle or Port Jackson instead. I do not know whether
this principle was applied in all local appointments; but, I
notice, that this year the district first had the benefit of the
services of a resident clerk of works. About the same time, Dr.
Kemball was appointed Immigration Agent, and the late Sir R. R.
Mackenzie, Mr. Duncan, and Mr. T. Jones, a committee of
management for the Botanical Gardens, of which Mr. Hill was
placed in charge as superintendent. The committee may be presumed
to have been laudably anxious for the preservation of their
trust, for they locked the gates against the public on Sundays,
at which the public were very reasonably discontented. A local
committee was also appointed for the management of the Savings
Bank; and although its operations were hindered, in consequence
of delay in the appointment of an accountant, it did not prevent
the military ardour of the people from finding vent in the
formation of a Brisbane rifle corps.</p>
<p>The sales of public lands, when held, met with the usual
response of ready buyers. One return gives the proceeds, during
fifteen months, from April 1, 1854, to June 30, 1855, at
Brisbane, at £25,347; at Ipswich, £14,355 18s. During the period,
from July 31, 1854, to June 30, 1855&mdash;eleven
months&mdash;the commissions paid to the officers managing the
sales at the two places, were, to Captain Wickham, £1,156 8s.
1d., and to Colonel Gray, £851 15s. 7d. Thus, the income of the
then Government Resident at Moreton Bay, was more than that of
the Premier of Queensland now, and of the Police Magistrate at
Ipswich equal to it. These kinds of indirect official emoluments
were of the sort that&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Do good by stealth, and blush to
find it fame."</p>
<p>A slight movement was made towards a petition for the
incorporation of Brisbane, the lamentable condition of the
streets and roads rendering some measure of local
self-preservation desirable, but beyond discussion, nothing
appears to have been done to provide for a traffic which must now
have been considerable&mdash;the annual tolls on the ferries
having sold for £300. In local industries, there was not much
attempted. Now and then I see a notice of new coal discoveries,
but the hope of gold had died out; and, except in society
meetings of various kinds, there was little local activity. In
one respect, the year exhibited a novelty in the shape of the
first really enjoyable public entertainment given in the colony.
The celebrated violinist, Miska Hauser, visited the district,
which rose, as it were, at the music he produced from his
instrument, and went wild with delight at the unaccustomed
strains. Minor performances followed, but none obliterated the
recollection of the effect produced by that exquisite player.
Less pleasant is it to record, that Mr. Pettigrew's saw mills
were burnt down on July 14, the fire being chronicled as the
first serious one in Brisbane. Much sympathy was felt for the
owner, and an immediate subscription entered into to help him in
their re-building. Later in the year, I find the erection of a
similar establishment near Ipswich, by Mr. Fleming, recorded;
but, on the whole, local industries seem to have been confined in
their application to local requirements. In that view we may
regard the establishment of the first Ipswich newspaper&mdash;the
<i>North Australian</i>&mdash;the first number of which was
issued on October 2 of this year. I have a vivid recollection of
the pungency and bitterness of the articles it occasionally
contained some four years after this period; but such was the
hold of the public press upon the public affections in this
district, that I have not been able to find a single copy of the
paper itself prior to its removal from Ipswich to Brisbane.</p>
<p>There were some circumstances of especial interest to those
readers of this history who may happen to be engaged in pastoral
pursuits, which should make this year memorable to them. In the
wool market a question unexpectedly arose, mooted by the buyers,
with respect to the allowance of "draft," in addition to tare. On
the London market a deduction of 1 lb. per cwt. had been always
made in addition to 10 lbs. per bale for tare; in the Sydney
market the 10 lbs. tare had been the only allowance. At a meeting
of the buyers in Sydney, a resolution was carried, "that the
London allowance of 1 lb. per cwt. be demanded on all wools
purchased at auction or otherwise, and also on actual tare, not
less in all cases than 10 lbs. per bale." Mr. H. Mort stigmatised
the London practice as iniquitous, and protested against the
resolution; but, as he was the only dissentient, the resolution
was carried, and ultimately, from the combination of the buyers,
had to be submitted to. As the question at issue in 1855, has
been recently one of acrimonious dispute between the producers
and brokers in London, I thought its origin in the New South
Wales market worth recording. Another circumstance, which
occurred here, led to an alteration in the law relating to
diseases in sheep. Early in the year, Mr. Tamm, a well-known
importer of merino sheep, had landed a number of rams of
considerable value, which he intended to sell to the stock owners
of the district, and while absent on that business, the disease
called scab, broke out amongst them. The whole were, under the
then existing law, destroyed, and the only compensation available
for him when he returned, was the sum of four shillings per
sheep, each of which were worth from twenty to thirty pounds.
This was felt as a great injustice, and likely to be a hindrance
in the way of improvement. A clause in the new Act, therefore,
provided for such cases. Imported animals were to be inspected,
and if supposed to be diseased, were to be shorn and dressed, and
not to be removed from the place when landed until reported to be
cured. Many alterations have since been made in the details of
the law, but this was the first discriminating legislation on the
subject.</p>
<p>At the close of the year, the old plan of publishing the
returns of exports, so far as they were available, was resumed,
but, it is to be regretted, only for its last quarter. This
however, will be enough to show the increase in the trade of the
northern ports. The totals stood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The export from Brisbane alone, for the last quarter of 1855,
was about equal to the whole yearly trade of the northern
districts six years before, a fact not to be forgotten hereafter;
but its character remained the same&mdash;pastoral produce,
principally&mdash;and I find no mention of cotton. The tonnage of
shipping inwards, to Moreton Bay, was 9,237 tons.</p>
<p>To complete the year's history, I have only now to refer to
what may be called the initiation of Mr. Gregory's first
exploratory expedition. Flying rumours had been heard of tracks
of Leichhardt, though none had been found to possess any
substantial foundation; but his friends seem to have hoped that
were another expedition sent to the north, something might
possibly be found of his route had he survived, far beyond the
point reached by Mr. Hely. The discovery of country on the
north-west coast and interior that might be available for
connecting the colonies of Western Australia and South Australia
with our own coast line and settlements, seems to have been the
leading idea in the mind of Sir William Denison, to whom
sentimentality of any kind was unknown, and who probably thought
that Leichhardt had been lost long enough to leave his fate no
longer a matter of uncertainty. When the expedition was
determined on, Mr. A. C. Gregory, afterwards, and for many years,
Surveyor-General of this colony, and at that time known as a
successful traveller and explorer in Western Australia, was
appointed to take command of it. It was proposed to complete the
equipment of the party at Moreton Bay, whence the necessary
vessels were to sail for the mouth of the Victoria river, on the
north-west coast of Australia, and then disembark on their
perilous voyage. Mr. H. Gregory, a brother of the leader, arrived
in Brisbane in April, for the purchase of horses, and to make
other necessary arrangements, and in July the necessary official
instructions were handed to Mr. Gregory himself. These directed
him, after disembarkation, to penetrate inland in a southerly
direction, by such a course as might seem most advisable, in
order to obtain as extensive a knowledge of the north-west
interior as was possible, taking note of the geographical
features, the habits of the natives, and generally of such
natural characteristics of the country and its inhabitants as
might be turned to future advantage. If a navigable river,
debouching on the north-west coast, were found, its outlet was to
be examined, and the facilities presented by it for navigation
ascertained. In the next place, a connection was, if practicable;
to be established with the former route of Sir Thomas Mitchell on
the Victoria river; or, if that were found impossible, Mr.
Gregory was directed to attempt the discovery of a more direct
line than that of Leichhardt's to the eastward, so as to connect
the settlements on the east coast with the Gulf of
Carpentaria&mdash;meeting one of the vessels at any point of
rendezvous he might fix upon. Not one reference to Leichhardt's
possible fate, or to its ascertainment, occurs in the
instructions; and the general ones are of the usual nature.</p>
<p>The arrangements being complete, the <i>Monarch</i> and <i>Tom
Tough</i> left Sydney on July 18, and anchored in the bay on the
23rd; and on August 12, having got all the equipment and stores
on board, they sailed for the north. As its main interest belongs
to the following year, I defer the complete history of the
expedition to the proper place in the following chapter. I say
complete, because Mr. Gregory has, with great kindness, placed
his journal at my disposal for use in the compilation of this
narrative.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This gentleman&mdash;not one of the least
abused in this colony&mdash;has had the honor of C.M.G. conferred
upon him for his geographical explorations and services to
science generally. Thus, a prophet has honour, etc.&mdash;but the

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> initiation of elective
Parliamentary Government was the first public business of the
year; the elections to the new Legislative Assembly required
immediate attention, and the people of the Moreton Bay district
were not slow in preparing for the exercise of their privilege.
For the Stanley boroughs Mr. H. Buckley was first requested to
stand, but a technicality arising from his having sat in the
Revision Court for that electorate, induced him to withdraw, and
to contest the seat for the Stanley county instead, where he
found an opponent in Mr. W. M. Dorsey. For the boroughs, which
returned two members, Mr. Richardson, the former member, Mr. F.
A. Forbes, Mr. A. Macalister, and Mr. T. Holt, a Sydney Merchant
and capitalist, were candidates. Mr. Gordon Sandeman was
solicited to accept the suffrages of the Burnett, Wide Bay, and
Maranoa. Mr. Clark Irving and Mr. Colin Mackenzie stood for the
Clarence and Darling Downs. There was no variety of opinion
expressed as to the question of separation or of convictism; but
on the other subjects on which differences might exist, there
were several shades apparent, and some little equivocation
employed. The programme of Messrs. Richardson and Forbes might be
described as ultra-radical on the questions of education,
State-aid to religion, the constitution of the Legislative
Council, the suffrage, the ballot, and the duration of
Parliament. Mr. Macalister was what would now be considered as a
tolerably well pronounced conservative. He objected to a nominee
Council, and to the two-thirds clause restrictive of alterations
in the Constitution; he was urgent upon the necessity for a cheap
system of tramroads, to take the place of common roads; he
advocated selling the public lands by auction, but was in favour
of a reduction of the upset price, observing that the general
question in its various relations "must be met in a spirit of
equity, and while doing no damage to any special interest, be
made to advance the general interest of the
colony"&mdash;language vague enough to avoid criticism and leave
action free. The national system of education he regarded as to
be applied to "remote and very scattered districts of the
colony," adding, "but as I am strong in the belief that education
ought always to have a religious foundation, I should, where such
is practicable, be favourable to the establishment of
denominational schools." And on the great question of State-aid
to religion, he expressed a decided opinion that the Legislature
of a country may offer voluntary contributions for religious
purposes equally with individuals, and [I] "have therefore yet to
be convinced of the propriety of withdrawing the support now
given to ministers of religion." It is curious and not
uninstructive to trace the political beginnings of men, who in a
lengthened political career, have exercised a leading influence
on the course of public events, and in that view I have thought
these early political utterances of Mr. Macalister worth
recording. Mr. Sandeman, in reply to the requisition sent him,
pointed with some pride to the fact that in the district he was
asked to represent, he "was the earliest settler," and he dealt
naturally with topics upon which his neighbours and possible
constituents were most immediately interested:&mdash;the
management of the native police, the local administration of
justice, and the fair distribution of the revenue in the
improvement of roads and bridges. He objected to the purely
nominee element in the Legislative Council, for which defect he
hoped some remedy might be found in the Constitution Act itself.
Mr. Holt was vehemently protesting in a profusion of italics and
capital letters. On local wants he would be guided by local
wishes; on education he expressed similar opinions to those put
forth by Mr. Macalister; and, regarding "prudent habits" as part
of public education, put in a word for the Australian Mutual
Provident Society, of which he claimed to be the founder. He
advocated the resumption of leased waste lands on compensation to
the lessee; an elective Upper House, because the majority of the
people were opposed to nomineeism; and the repeal of the
two-thirds clause. I should say that there was a good deal of
vivacity about Mr. Holt's candidature on the part of the
candidate and his supporters.</p>
<p>The election for the boroughs was carried on with no small
acerbity and soon resolved itself into a question of Brisbane
against Ipswich. When the poll closed it was found, that Mr. Holt
and Mr. Richardson were returned by majorities of two to one over
their competitors, Brisbane almost to a man polling for them, and
Ipswich for their opponents. In the county, Mr. Buckley polled
305 to Mr. Dorsey's 100, Mr. Sandeman was returned without
opposition, and Mr. Clarke Irving, mainly through his influence
in the Clarence and New England districts, defeated Mr. John
Mackenzie. Mr. Macalister, in rather an angry address, attributed
his defeat to the treachery and tergiversation of his supposed
Brisbane supporters.</p>
<p>Before the elections Mr. E. Deas Thompson had returned from
England, which he had visited on leave, and to the duties of his
office as Colonial Secretary, it being understood that both he
and his colleagues held office only until there was an
opportunity of selecting a Ministry from the new Parliament. In
due time the Legislative Council was constituted, the three
judges of the Supreme Court being amongst the members, and the
Chief Justice the President; the roll of elected members
completed; a new Ministry formed; and the great game, of what I
can scarcely regard as other than political see-saw, began. The
first Ministry was&mdash;Mr. S. A. Donaldson, Premier; Mr.
MacArthur, Colonial Treasurer; Mr. W. M. Manning,
Attorney-General: Mr. Darvall, Solicitor-General; and Mr.
Nicholls, Auditor-General&mdash;a combination not very likely to
be favourable to the claims or interests of Moreton Bay. The bulk
of the old leading officials found a dignified retirement on the
cushions of the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Prior to the opening of the new Parliament, and on May 7, a
meeting was summoned at his residence by Mr. D. Cooper, to
consider the course to be pursued by what were by implication to
be considered as independent members of the Assembly, and after
seven hours' consultation they seem to have arrived at a
determinate course. On the 22nd the House met formally, when Mr.
Cooper was elected Speaker by a majority of one over Mr. Parker,
the Ministerial candidate. The next day the Governor opened
Parliament in state, much to the admiration, and somewhat to the
amusement, of spectators unaccustomed to such a ceremony. On the
usual address in reply to his speech being moved, it was met by
an amendment, affirming that the former Executive were not
entitled to their pensions under the Constitution Act, until
relieved from office by Parliamentary action, and that the
assumption of the position of responsible Ministers by the
members of the new cabinet was premature and unconstitutional. On
these questions the Ministry obtained substantial majorities. Mr.
Macarthur almost immediately resigned the Colonial Treasurership,
which was taken by Mr. Holt. Dr. Lang forthwith addressed a
letter to the electors of the Stanley boroughs, warning them that
if separation in any form were to meet with the slightest support
from a cabinet, which he stigmatised as a "repetition of the old
sham under E. Deas Thomson &amp; Co.," it would only be on
condition of retaining for New South Wales the Clarence and
Richmond River districts. This warning, however well founded
subsequent events proved it to be, fell on deaf ears, and Mr.
Holt was re-elected on June 23, without opposition, to a short
and troubled ministerial career. On August 12 a motion by Mr.
Forster, condemnatory of the presence of the judges in the
Legislative Council, was carried against the Ministry by the
Speaker's casting vote. On the 14th Mr. Donaldson moved that the
vote be rescinded, but was defeated by a majority of one.
Subsequent divisions on leading questions leaving the Ministry in
scarcely any better position, they resigned, and were succeeded
by one of which Mr. Cowper was Premier, having Messrs. Campbell,
Murray, Martin, and Mr. A. J. P. Lutwyche (the late Mr. Justice
Lutwyche) for his colleagues. No sooner had the new Ministry been
re-elected, than they were met by a vote of want of confidence,
which was carried on September 24, by a vote of 26 to 24. On this
they resigned, when a third cabinet was formed&mdash;the third in
four months&mdash;Mr. Parker being Premier, with Mr. Donaldson as
Treasurer, Mr. Hay as Auditor, Mr. Murray as Attorney-General,
and Mr. Darvall as Solicitor-General; and with this change the
end of the year found the Parliament apparently acquiescent, if
not satisfied. In every point of view the new Ministry might be
considered as inimical to the separation of the northern
districts from the parent colony.</p>
<p>Indeed the year was one of continuous excitement on the
subject. The reference of the matter to Sir William Denison by
the home Government excited some uneasiness, and a public meeting
was held on January 22, at which a fresh petition to the
Queen&mdash;drawn with great ability by Dr. Lang&mdash;was
adopted, in which the resources of the district were set forth at
some length, and the neglect which it had suffered from was
enlarged upon in strong but not unjustifiable terms. It alleged
that the export from the northern districts was one-eighth of the
total of that of New South Wales; that their area was equal to
the united areas of eight of the minor British colonies, all of
which enjoyed independent government; and that neither South
Australia or Van Diemen's Land was equal to Moreton Bay when they
had that right conceded to them. It is to be regretted that the
language used at the meeting towards Mr. E. Deas Thomson was
ill-timed and discourteous. Mr. Thomson, as it afterwards
appeared, had, so far from opposing separation when in London,
given his assistance to the then Secretary of State for the
Colonies, Mr. Labouchere, in the determination of the
boundary-line between New South Wales and the new colony, which
was fixed at the 30th parallel, so as to include the Richmond and
Clarence River districts. Undoubtedly Dr. Lang rendered very
great service in the cause of separation; and it is therefore the
more to be lamented that anything should have resulted, even
indirectly, from his vehemence to mar the success already sure of
attainment, or interfere with the completeness of the detailed
arrangements.</p>
<p>There was greater reason for regret, since it soon appeared
that the opponents of separation were both active and insidious.
The jealousy felt towards Brisbane by the outlying districts, and
the rival claims of Ipswich to be the future capital, were
sedulously fostered by those who desired nothing better than to
see such a disunion between the inhabitants as would give them,
at least, some technical hold against the creation of a new
colony. Some of the inhabitants of Grafton, on the Clarence
River, were induced to meet and petition against the separation
of that district from New South Wales, and this was followed up
by another meeting at Tenterfield, in New England. There was no
question as to by whom, or why, these meetings were got up. One
thing to be regretted is that the people of the more populous
districts of the then North were not more active and conciliatory
to their southern neighbours in securing the goodwill of those
whose co-operation was so essential to the common good.</p>
<p>The necessity for this should have been more apparent, when in
June the Government Resident informed the memorialists to a
preceding petition that Her Majesty's Government had resolved,
for the present, to "abstain from any measures for the purpose of
separation," this resolution having been formed presumedly on the
Governor-General's report. The presumption became assurance in a
few weeks, when a letter was published which by the pertinacity
of Mr. M. H. Marsh, had been obtained in England from the
Colonial Office, and was forwarded by him to Mr. Gordon Sandeman.
In this letter he was informed that "in a despatch which has been
lately received from the Governor on this subject, he reports
against the plan of separation, and that, consequently, Her
Majesty's Government do not at present intend to take any further
proceedings on the subject." To still further cheer the hearts of
the separationists, a letter was addressed by Mr. Clark Irving to
the electors of the Clarence and Darling Downs district, for
which he was member, in which he, in guarded language, but with
unmistakeable intention, declared that the Clarence and Richmond
River districts would suffer injury were they included within the
boundary of the proposed new colony; that those districts were
politically and commercially connected with Sydney; and that they
would be adequately protected as to both interests in the new
Parliament. Mr. Clark Irving was a great man, according to that
kind of great men, in his day, and as is their wont, went astray
of the public welfare, when his immediate purposes were
concerned. He forgot that by a new postal route the Richmond was
brought within 150 miles of Brisbane by land, while it was 600
miles from Sydney, and his predictions, as to the increasing
prosperity of the country he sought to exclude from independence,
have been signally falsified by events. I hardly think that the
advance of the Clarence and Richmond districts since 1856 can be
considered as worth recording beside that of Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>Close upon the publication of this letter came that of the
correspondence between Sir William Denison and the Home
Government on the subject, when the wrath of the people rose to
fever height; and with every disposition to lean lightly upon the
memory of an able man no longer alive to defend himself, I am
compelled to think justly. The statement of facts, meagre as it
was in his report, was, when definite, incorrect, and when
accurate, incomplete. Questions of import or export trade he did
not touch. The actual or possible customs revenue he did not even
allude to. The freehold interest on the amount of capital sunk in
buildings and trade he passed by. He saw only that four hundred
and twenty squatters held two millions five hundred thousand
acres of land at a rent of £13,608 per annum, and he threw doubt
upon even the lasting character of that settlement, because of
the small expenditure they had made in permanent improvements. It
never seems to have occurred to him that the nature of the
pursuit did not require them, but that so long as a single
station, and that not of the largest, would command a price of
£60,000 in the market, the profitable character of the avocation
itself must enforce permanency of occupation without respect to
the personality of the occupant. He might as well have said
because by reason of death there is a succession of tenants a
tenancy is valueless. But I regret to have to say that he was as
disingenuous as illogical; and, that I may not be supposed to
write what is unfair, I quote his own language, less in the way
of censure than of warning, and to show my fellow colonists not
only what their predecessors had to fight against, but how easily
and justly the discrimination of English statesmen detected the
misstatements and sophistry which had been presented for their
acceptance, and how, so far as their knowledge enabled them, they
dealt fairly and uprightly throughout this transaction.</p>
<blockquote>"I have looked," he says, in his despatch of October
18, 1855, "over the former correspondence with relation to the
proposed scheme of separation, by which it would appear that the
expediency of such a step was first advocated by the inhabitants
of the Northern districts, principally with the view of inducing
the Government to send a supply of convict labour to that part of
the colony. It is true that this was objected to by a portion of
the population, but still it formed the main feature in most of
the petitions. I am, therefore, I think, justified in expressing
my belief that the large squatters were the persons whost
interests were most consulted in the matter. In the later
petitions the question of the continuance of transportation has
been omitted, the policy of the Home Government having been too
clearly explained as regard: it to allow of any hope that
convicts would be sent to Moreton Bay, ever were it made a
separate colony; but the persons who petition are the same, with
the addition, perhaps, of the trading population of the town of
Brisbane and Ipswich. To those the prospect of a large local
expenditure is probably the inducement which has caused them to
apply for separation from New South Wales."</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has read this history so far with
attention&mdash;and I have spared no trouble in ascertaining the
truth of the facts stated in it, and have ample proof of their
correctness in the records and documents of the time&mdash;will
judge for himself of the accuracy of this statement&mdash;one
reflecting discredit equally upon the judgment and truthfulness
of the writer.</p>
<p>That nothing should be wanting to show how local jealousies
could interfere to thwart the general good, the petition for a
separate member for the town of Ipswich was now presented to the
Legislature. It did not rest upon the actual claims of the town
itself to distinct representation, which were in themselves
sufficient, but it declared that the interests of Ipswich and
Brisbane were "altogether antagonistic;" it urged with great
vehemence of language, the superior claims of the petitioners to
have the public buildings of the colony erected in their own
town, and asserted "a strong probability that the Ipswich roll of
electors will soon outnumber that of Brisbane," and on those
groundi enforced the desirability of separating the electorate.
In the prayer of their petition few would have refused to join,
but in connection with the argument it illustrated the famous
description by Lord Mansfield of popular conclusions which,
whenever they were right in themselves, he said, were seldom so
from a right reason. And the time at which it was presented was
singularly inopportune. The people of Ipswich were, in fact,
playing into the hands of the opponents of separation.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang was active and impetuous as if the days of his youth
had returned. He left Sydney and arrived at Grafton on August 22,
and two days after met the people there, when he answered all Mr.
Clark Irving's arguments promptly and lucidly, and apparently to
the satisfaction of his auditors. Then, as if to demonstrate the
facility of communication between the Clarence and Richmond and
Moreton Bay, he travelled overland to Brisbane, and, on September
11, delivered one of the best of his many lectures, in the School
of Arts there; and I have no doubt that the exceedingly vigorous
and yet temperate reply of the Moreton Bay Separation Committee
to the report of Sir William Denison owed very much of its pith
to his pen.</p>
<p>While these active steps were taken, rumours arose that Sir
William Denison's report had not had quite the weight which, from
its curt and dogmatic tone, he seems to have expected. Mr. Arthur
Hodgson had then recently arrived in Sydney from a lengthened
visit to England, and in a letter, addressed to the inhabitants
of the Northern districts, narrating the particulars of two
interviews with Mr. Labouchere, gave them fresh courage, and much
annoyance to those who thought the opinion of the
Governor-General decisive upon the separation question. With the
first interview Mr. Hodgson was not quite satisfied, and with the
impulsiveness which seems part of his nature, he asked a second
for himself and the colonists, then in London, acting with him.
That interview, he said,</p>
<blockquote>"was entirely satisfactory. . . Mr. Labouchere, had
had time to consider the subject well, and I know that he worked
up the question and consulted with other gentlemen as to the
propriety of our demands. . . He gave us to understand that our
demands were just&mdash;our arguments good, and although he
declined giving us there and then a distinct pledge&mdash;we left
Downing-street with an impression that separation would take
place almost immediately."</blockquote>
<p>We may forgive Mr. Hodgson much vacillation and inconsistency,
and even his heresy on the wheat question, for the good service
he did the colony on that occasion on the main
question&mdash;tempered as it was by volunteer advice upon the
future constitution which, I have no doubt, the Secretary of
State listened to with patience, and with equal equanimity
forgot. As to the probable boundary, Mr. Labouchere suggested
that, were the Home Government to settle it, it would relieve the
Government and Parliament of New South Wales of an invidious
duty. It is a pity that that suggestion was not acted upon.</p>
<p>How bitter the feeling had grown in New South Wales against
separation we may collect from the speeches of leading men, and
the tone of the leading press there. As one, though by no means a
solitary instance, I quote from the speech of Mr. Darvall, the
Solicitor-General, at his nomination for the North Riding of
Cumberland. In strong terms he denounced what he termed the
amputation of the richest province of the colony.</p>
<blockquote>"Millions of acres of some of the finest Land in our
colony have thus been torn from us, while we have incurred all
the expense of finding, surveying, settling, and rendering them
valuable. . . To my mind, never was there so weak, so
mischievous, so insane a measure as this proposed separation.
Then again, look at the expense that must be incurred from the
necessary Government staff that will be required. At least
£100,000 a year will be required to cover this; and this will
entail a burden of taxation of at least £5 per head on the whole
population. And all this at a time when the revenue of Moreton
Bay, at the present time, is hardly sufficient to support a
corporal's guard in a watch-house. It appears to me a most wicked
and most mischievous act to cut off from us a thriving settlement
that has cost us so much to bring to its present state of
prosperity."</blockquote>
<p>When the violence of partizanship could carry an experienced
lawyer and politician to such lengths, we may well imagine what
men of less character and caution might write or say. Yet, at the
census of 1855, the population of the northern
districts&mdash;exclusive of that of New England included within
the proposed boundary&mdash;was 19,321, and a fair estimate of
the revenue derivable from duties, on their consumption and other
ordinary sources, and from land sales and assessments, was about
£140,000. The assessment alone was close upon £15,000; surely
more than adequate to the support of many corporals' guards.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this wrangling came a despatch front Mr.
Labouchere which finally settled the question of separation
itself, and left only details to be arranged. The importance of
this State paper in the history of the colony is sufficient to
justify my quoting the most weighty paragraphs; more especially
as two leading questions discussed in them&mdash;the southern
boundary, and the arrangement of the public debt&mdash;cannot
even now be regarded as sufficiently determined to be without
interest to us.</p>
<blockquote>"I have now," writes Mr. Labouchere, addressing the
Governor. General, "to inform you that Her Majesty's Government
have determined that the time has arrived when this separation
would be desirable. They have not failed to give their fullest
attention to the arguments adduced by yourself as well as by Sir
Charles Fitzroy against this determination. But they feel that
those arguments rest on premises which are every day more and
more set aside by the progress of events. And on the whole they
believe that it is better to run the risk of forming into a
colony a community as yet in some respects immature, but rapidly
advancing to maturity, than of letting the partial difficulties
of separation and the ill-feeling, which the present state of
things is calculated to engender, grow stronger from day to day.
In addition to these views of their own they have been urged by
the strong and repeated representations of parties possessing the
confidence of the inhabitants of the northern districts and also
by statements directly proceeding from what they believe to be
the majority of the inhabitants of the northern districts, . . .
The following are the most important questions, as it occurs to
me, which remain to be decided:&mdash;1. The boundary between the
two future provinces: On this point I have had the valuable
assistance of a memorandum drawn up by Mr. E. Deas Thomson, when
in England, as well as of the statements of gentlemen interested
in the northern provinces. With the materials thus before them,
Her Majesty's Government will have no difficulty in fixing on a
line which will run not far to the south of 30 S. latitude; but
will be accommodated to suit the natural features of the country.
2. The future government of the separated portion:&mdash;The
necessary powers for this purpose have been conferred on Her
Majesty by the Act of Parliament enabling her to confirm the New
South Wales Bill, and I shall address you further on the subject
on another occasion. 3. The division of the debt of the province
am in correspondence with the Law advisers of the Crown on the
subject of the legal method by which this division may be
effected. But, whatever their opinion on this point may be, there
can be no doubt that the basis of arrangement should be an
equitable division according to the several contributions to the
revenue of the two portions; and the benefit which they
respectively derived or expected from the public services to
which the loans thus contracted were appropriated. On this
subject, especially, I am anxious to receive, as soon as
practicable, a report from yourself, with the advice of your
Council."</blockquote>
<p>The publication of this despatch was received with the
liveliest expressions of joy. So many flags never flaunted in
Brisbane before. The day, however, was dark and lowering, and
towards noon there was a heavy storm of wind and rain. Dr. Lang
was loud in his congratulations, although dissenting from any
boundary that might be fixed lower than the 30th parallel&mdash;a
dissent rather premature, and, as it subsequently proved,
ineffectual. A public meeting was held in Brisbane on the 20th,
when an address of gratitude to the Queen was adopted, and thanks
voted to the gentlemen who had exerted themselves in London, as
well as specially to Dr. Lang for his great and long continued
efforts to secure to the district the desired boon of separation.
But all was not joy and gratitude. The disunion I have before
referred to had borne fruit, and the warning of Dr. Lang against
Mr. Holt had been abundantly justified. On November 3 Mr.
Hargreaves, member for the Macleay and New England districts,
brought forward a motion in the Legislative Assembly, which,
while generally censuring the conduct of the Imperial
authorities, was principally condemnatory of the boundary line
suggested, and deprecated any settlement until the opinion of the
inhabitants of the Clarence and Richmond and New England
districts had been ascertained. In the course of the debate very
acrimonious language was employed towards the Imperial
authorities, and the proposed new colony. Mr. Holt, while
professing himself a separationist, objected to the boundary, and
was one of the thirty-five who voted in favour of Mr. Hargreaves'
resolutions against a minority of four. At the meeting great
indignation was displayed at this conduct&mdash;most of the
speakers, however, assuming the question to be settled beyond all
fear of change. In this they were, unfortunately both for the new
colony and for the districts sought to be excluded from it,
altogether premature. They undervalued the force against them,
and do not seem to have appreciated the pertinacity of Sir
William Denison, or the skill and organisation which were
combined to secure the retention of the country in dispute to New
South Wales. As was natural, Mr. Holt's constituents met and
condemned his conduct, and a requisition was at once put in
circulation calling upon him to resign. Mr. Holt, hearing of
this, entered upon explanations in the Legislative Assembly, in
which he employed language for which he was reprimanded by the
Speaker, and which in nowise increased his favour in the eyes of
his constituents; for those explanations simply amounted to
this&mdash;that while he meant what he did say at the time of his
election, he did not by any means say all that he meant. Mr.
Hargreaves' resolutions being sent to the Legislative Council for
their concurrence, Mr. E. Deas Thomson took occasion to express
regret at having given the advice he did to Mr. Labouchere, and
voted in their favour. The honourable gentleman had had many
years' experience in the colony, and knew all the circumstances
surrounding the question well. Either he gave that advice on due
deliberation or he did not. If he did so, no circumstance had
occurred since the time it was given to change the character of
the facts upon which it was presumedly based, and there was no
valid reason for the course he adopted. If he did not, he
insulted the Government, to whom the opinion was tendered, and
the colony in whose interests he was presumedly acting. In either
case he had the melancholy satisfaction of setting a precedent
for that weak vacillation, so nearly akin to a worse fault of
which since that day there has been no lack of followers. The
resolutions were of course carried, and there, with the exception
of some letters of Dr. Lang's, deprecatory of any alteration from
his favourite 30th parallel, the matter for the present
rested.</p>
<p>The stream of immigration flowed rather slackly during the
year, and there was unfortunately a considerable migration
southward from the district. The direct arrivals from Great
Britain were 1.258, and of these some, despite the remonstrances
of the inhabitants, were transhipped to Sydney. About 350 Germans
were brought, of whom a portion was also forwarded to Sydney. The
Moreton Bay Land and Emigration Company assumed what may be
termed a definitely passive shape; a board of directors being
formed, and a call of half-a-crown per share being made, but only
for the purpose of defraying the preliminary expenses incurred in
passing the Act. All further action, it was announced, would be
delayed until the result of an effort to be made in England to
obtain the co-operation of capitalists there was seen.</p>
<p>The pastoral industry of the district continued to extend, but
on other matters there was more talk than action. The cultivation
of cotton, which had languished, began again to be discussed,
especially after the prizes gained by Mr. Eldridge for his
exhibit at the Paris Industrial Exposition became known.
Estimates were published from time to time showing theoretic
profits, but varying in return from thirty to fifty per cent. Mr.
Eldridge utilised his practical experience in the matter by
furnishing one for the cultivation of 640 acres. The capital
invested he fixed at £8,810, the annual expenditure at £4,085,
the gross annual return at £8,250, but the selling price of the
product he took at one shilling and sixpence per lb.&mdash;one
which was thought by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce to be
below that which could be readily obtained for cotton of equal
quality to that submitted to them. A lecture on the subject,
delivered by Mr. Wm. Brookes in August, was supposed likely to
impart a stimulus to the very little effort then making to
forward the industry. News of a proposed company forming in
Sydney for the cultivation of cotton in Moreton Bay excited a
little curiosity, but it proved to be of intention only; although
a series of questions asked by Mr. T. S. Mort, of Sydney, pointed
to a more business like effort than had yet been made. These were
placed in Dr. Hobbs's hands for reply, and his answers were
practical and comprehensive, but what beneficial result followed
I am unable to say. The late Mr. Panton made some experiments,
but expressed an opinion that coolie labour would be required if
extensive cultivation were entered upon; an opinion which did not
increase either his popularity or that of the industry.
Coal-mining was pursued in a sort of intermittent fashion, new
pits being opened&mdash;always with promises of success; and
wheat growing was still continued, between fifty and sixty acres
being reported as under crop by several persons in the vicinity
of Brisbane; but there does not seem to have been any systematic
or combined effort at testing the suitability of the soil and
climate for the growth of cereals or for ascertaining the best
methods of deriving a certain remuneration from it.</p>
<p>The exports for the first nine months of the year exhibited a
steady increase. From Brisbane alone the values were calculated
at £301,392; but with the exception of a few tons of coal, the
articles were almost entirely confined to merely pastoral
products. There were occasional spurts of rumour as to gold
deposits, and isolated parties were fitted out, to return
sanguine in hope and empty in performance. Upon the whole the
period was one of doubt and depression&mdash;not lessened by a
long and severe drought to which the district was this year
subjected.</p>
<p>Some effort was made by the New South Wales Government to
ascertain what was really required for the improvement of the
river navigation. Mr. Grundy, the engineer employed, sent in two
reports, one on the obstructions between the towns of Brisbane
and Ipswich, the other on the works required between Brisbane and
the Bay. His report was not favourable to the navigation of the
Brisbane by vessels of any tonnage beyond the barrier formed by
what are called the Seventeen-mile Rocks. "It would be necessary,
ere vessels arriving in Moreton Bay could proceed to Ipswich, to
deepen almost the entire bed of the river" from that point to the
junction of the Bremer with it. With respect to the river below
Brisbane, he proposed to deepen a main channel through the flats
in it, and use the material thus obtained to fill up the minor
ones, so as to produce a greater current, and one strong enough
to keep that open. The bar at the mouth of the river, he
suggested, should be dredged, so as to continue the channel
existing up to it in a straight course through. The cost he
estimated&mdash;employing one dredge&mdash;at £13,662, and the
time at eight years. The report did not pass without criticism,
and, in truth, it added little or nothing to that of Mr.
Debenham, to which I have before referred. As nothing practical
followed from it, it is needless to recapitulate the comment it
provoked. The energies of the then Government seem to have been
so exhausted by the effort made to obtain information that no
strength was left to utilise it when got.</p>
<p>The progress of improvement in other respects was gradual. The
depression to which I have alluded was less apparent towards the
end of the year than it had been in its earlier part, and strong
articles condemnatory of the banks for "putting on the screw,"
were followed by others announcing the appearance of "blue sky"
in the commercial atmosphere. But the lugubrious mixed with the
congratulatory. The want of some "suitable means of conveying
their dead to the place of interment" was bewailed by the local
journals, and it was gravely suggested that "a small hearse,
drawn by one horse, would not involve any serious outlay." The
late Captain Towns, then on a visit to Brisbane, seems to have
been so deeply impressed with the want that he offered to head a
subscription for the provision of the required accommodation with
£20, I am unable to trace any response to this cheerful
invitation. It is possible that the minds of the people ran
rather upon the wants of the living than ceremonial for the dead,
for, on March 8, a meeting was held, at which the grievances of
the people were discussed and a committee appointed to bring
under the notice of the Government the necessity of proceeding
with the public works of the district, the gaol, the lighthouse
at Moreton Bay, and two semaphore telegraph stations&mdash;but
there was as much grumbling at the common apathy of the people as
at the treatment they received from their rulers. Whether the
action of the authorities was at all expedited by such procedure
it is not easy to say, but tenders were at length accepted for
the construction of the lighthouse at Moreton Island, and the
works were commenced, not without some discontent that they were
not entrusted to the local contractor, which expanded into a
desire that tenders for local works should be received and
decided upon by a local board, instead of being sent on to
Sydney. The sudden activity of Brisbane started Ipswich into
life, and the people in their turn petitioned the Government that
the gaol and other public buildings should be erected there; in
reply to which they were told that their request could not be
complied with, and on another application for a local immigration
depôt they were similarly unsuccessful. The spirit of association
spread to the stockholders, who had been alarmed at the
appearance of a disease called "catarrh" in the flocks on the
Clifton run, and who now formed a society for mutual protection.
A common subscription was entered into, and the Northern District
Mutual Protection Society was formed. Mr. Tooth agreed that the
diseased sheep were at once to be killed and boiled down on the
run&mdash;the cost of carrying the skins and tallow to the
shipping port being borne by the new society, and thus peace was
restored, protection provided, and the danger for the time got
rid of.</p>
<p>About this time, a survey for a line of railway to connect the
coast with the Darling Downs was talked of as to be provided for
amongst similar undertakings for which a vote was asked; and the
mere proposal was the signal for further discord. It was
contended that the termination of the line at Ipswich would be
adequate for every purpose, and that the facilities of water
carriage presented by the Bremer and Brisbane rivers were ample
for the accommodation of any traffic that could result from its
construction. That nothing should be wanting in support of this
theory, the residents of the Downs were moved, and, in public
meeting at Drayton, adopted petitions, alike in language, to the
Governor-General, the Legislative Council, and the Legislative
Assembly, in which they asserted that to make a railway
"beneficial and advantageous to the northern districts and the
interests thereof, it will be necessary to make the terminus of
such railway at the head of the navigation of the rivers Brisbane
and Bremer." It is unnecessary to detail arguments of which the
course of events have since proved the fallacy; but it shows how
far local prejudice could cloak local ignorance when we find the
country from Ipswich to the foot of the great dividing range
described as "offering no engineering difficulty,"&mdash;the very
abrupt and jagged mountainous spurs of the Little Liverpool
range, requiring a costly tunnel, intervening&mdash;while it was
gravely affirmed that, from an inland terminus, at the foot of
the main range, "good roads could diverge in all directions;" the
fact being that but one pass for ordinary traffic over the range,
and that difficult and dangerous, has been found up to this date
in a length of very many miles. All this was exceedingly pitiable
and exceedingly mischievous.</p>
<p>There was some consolation for the well wishers of the new
province in the real progress quietly, but effectually, made in
other respects. The savings bank was found of great benefit
throughout the northern districts, and I find it recorded as a
proof of the extent to which it was appreciated, that £300 was
sent down by the Messrs. Royds, for deposit on account of their
men employed at the Juandah station, in the Leichhardt. The
Botanic Gardens began to assume a grateful aspect, and their long
career of usefulness was fairly started. The Ipswich library and
reading room met with efficient support, and the Brisbane School
of Arts added to its books, and was enlivened by debates of the
usual speculative kind. In a report of one upon the question, "Is
it expedient to abolish capital punishment?" I find the names of
two gentlemen who have since occupied prominent positions in our
local, political, and official world&mdash;those of Mr. Charles
Lilley and Mr. T. P. Pugh. Was it indicative of their future
career that they were on that occasion&mdash;as in those times on
most occasions&mdash;in a majority? And amidst the signs of
progress and coming prosperity with which the <i>Courier</i>
cheered its readers at the close of the year, was the, at least,
tolerable certainty that a branch of the Supreme Court, with a
resident judge, would now soon be fixed at Moreton Bay, as
indicated not only by the introduction of a Bill to carry out
that object, but by a sum of £4,861 being placed on the estimates
for the next year on account of the expenses that would be
incurred. In rather odd contrast to these increased facilities
for law, the value of forbearance and Christian love was
emphatically inculcated. Had the advice been literally adopted,
the legal blessings might have been less felt, though possibly
quite as fully appreciated.</p>
<p>Not the least memorable event of the year was the successful
completion by Mr. Gregory of the exploration committed to his
charge. He returned to Brisbane on December 16, after an absence
of sixteen months, having performed the service enjoined upon
him, and bringing much valuable information as to the nature of
the country traversed. It will be remembered that the two
vessels, the <i>Monarch</i> and the <i>Tom Tough</i>, left
Moreton Bay on August 12, 1855. On September 2, they were near to
Vernon Island, in Van Diemen's Gulf, on the northern coast, when
the <i>Monarch</i> grounded on a coral bank, and was not floated
until the 10th. On the 16th Mr. Gregory landed at Blunder Bay, on
the mouth of the Victoria River, when he found the country unfit
for camping. Finding no improvement as he proceeded, he turned
back, and two days after joined the <i>Monarch</i> in Treachery
Bay, when he learned that some of the horses had been landed. On
the 22nd he formed the first camp at Providence Hill, an
elevation on Point Pearce, on the north-east shore of the
entrance to the Victoria. The stores, sheep, and horses being all
removed from the <i>Monarch</i>, that vessel sailed for Singapore
on the 24th, the <i>Tom Tough</i> being directed to proceed up
the river as far as she could, that a camp might be established
on a suitable site, and there the vessel was to await the land
party. After a reconnoitring expedition by Mr. Gregory to
ascertain the probably best route towards the supposed point of
rendezvous, the party started to examine the country on the east
banks of the Victoria on September 28. Of the fifty horses taken
from Moreton Bay, nine had died from various causes, and many
were so weak that they fell down, and had to be lifted up before
they could feed. The sheep taken with the explorers on this trip
were abandoned the first day from like causes. On October 16 they
sighted the Victoria River, about six miles below Kangaroo Point,
and camping, met with a misfortune in the firing of the grass by
the carelessness of the cook. On October 20 they fell in with Mr.
Elsey, the surgeon, one of those who had remained on board the
<i>Tom Tough</i>, and learned from him that the vessel had
grounded on a ledge of rocks on a southern bank of the river, and
sustained serious damage. Many of the stores had been destroyed,
and of the sheep only fifty-four remained and in a miserable
condition. After much hard work the schooner was moved on October
29, close to the bank and to the camp. In the course of the
removals and shiftings, more sheep were lost or compelled to be
abandoned, until only twenty-six remained. The general weakness
of the animals and the necessity for providing shelter for the
stores, which had to be removed from the damaged vessel, delayed
the explorers; but on November 24 Mr. Gregory, his brother Mr. H.
Gregory, Dr. Müller, and Mr. Wilson left with seven horses and
twenty days' provisions to examine the country through which the
main party would have to travel on the route to the interior.
They continued their examination until December 6, when, having
ermined the country sufficiently to enable an advance through a
whole degree of latitude, they commenced their return, and
reached their principal camp (lat. 15 degs. 34 mins. S., long.
130 degs. 22 min. E.) on the 13th. Upon consideration, and
finding that owing to the nature of the vegetation, the whole
equipment would have to be carried on pack-horses, it was
determined that the exploring party should consist of nine,
taking with them five months' provisions and necessaries; the
remaining members of the expedition having full employment in the
repair of the schooner and the care of the stores. The wet
weather which now bcfel them impeded their preparations, and it
was not until January 3, 1856, that the adventurers could fairly
start. They were&mdash;Mr. A. C. Gregory, commander; Mr. H.
Gregory, assistant-commander; Mr. T. Baines, artist; Dr. F.
Müller&mdash;now the Baron Von Müller&mdash;botanist; Mr. T.
Flood, collector, and four assistants; the geologist, Mr. J. S.
Wilson; the surgeon, Mr. Elsey; and some others, remained at the
principal camp on the Victoria River. For those who are curious
on such matters, I give a copy of Mr. Gregory's memorandum of
their arrangements and equipment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The exploring party has with it 27 pack-horses with
packsaddles; * 3 pack-horses with riding-saddles; 6 riding
horses, or in all 36 horses. Flour, 1,470 lbs.; pork, 1,200 lbs.;
rice, 200 lbs.; sago, 44 lbs.; sugar, 280 lbs.; tea, 36 lbs.;
coffee, 28 lbs.; tobacco, 21 lbs.; soap, 51 lbs.&mdash;or in all,
3,330 lbs. Instruments, clothing, tents, ammunition, horse-shoes,
tools, &amp;c., 800 lbs.; saddle-bags and packages, 400 lbs.;
saddles, bridles, hobbles, &amp;c., 900 lbs.&mdash;total, 5430
lbs. The total weight of the equipment of the party was thus
about two and a-half tons, which, distributed on 30 horses, gave
an average load of 180 lbs. each. Each person had a stated number
of horses in his special charge, and was responsible for the
proper care of the loads and equipment, the saddles and loads
being all marked with corresponding numbers. A watch was
constantly kept through the night, each person being on sentry
for two hours in regular rotation, except myself, as I had to
make astronomical observations at uncertain hours. The cook was
on watch from 2 till 4 a.m., and having prepared breakfast,
<i>the party concluded this meal before daybreak, and thus the
most valuable part of the day was not lost</i>."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* "The pack-saddles were made after a model by
Mr. Gregory, and are the best I have seen yet. Two boards of
light wood are connected by bows of iron 1.5-inch wide and ¼inch
thick, with books inserted in either side for the pack-bags to
hook on to. The straps for the breasting, breechings and girths
were screwed on to the boards; the crupper passed through a ring
on the after bow; and a light pad&mdash;which could easily be
taken out to be re-stuffed&mdash;was secured by small thongs,
passed through holes in the ends of the boards. We had two
girths, which crossed each other under the horse. (In unloading,
the neck-strap is unbuckled on the near side, also the breasting
and girths; and the whole is drawn off behind.) The pack-bags
were made of one width of canvas, turned so as to have no seam on
the bottom; pear-shaped pieces were sewn in to form ends, and
rope was stitched along the seams, having eyes above, by which
the bag was hung upon the hooks. The flour-bags were made of
canvas, of the usual width, with a round bottom stitched into
them. The mouth was sewn up when full, and an oiled bag, of the
same size, drawn over it. . . . Our waterproof-bags were of
leather, lined with waterproof cloth, just large enough to fill
one of the canvas pack-bags. They had a brass neck, with a worm
inside, in which we screwed a plug of soft wool. Each pair of
bags was carefully balanced one against the other, that the
horses might not be unequally loaded."&mdash;<i>Mr. Baines'
Description in Dalton's" Cut of Travel.</i>"]</p>
<p>On January 22 they arrived at a point where advanced
exploration seemed necessary; and after this had been made, a
depôt camp was formed on the 29th, near to a hill called Mount
Sanford, about latitude 17 deg. 30 sec. Then leaving Mr. Barnes
and the men in charge, Mr. Gregory, his brother, Dr. Müller, and
the harness-maker, Charles Dean, taking eleven of the strongest
horses and a moderate supply of provisions, pushed into the
unknown interior, continuing generally in a southerly direction,
until February 10, when they were stopped by a sandy desert
country. On this they turned in a north-easterly direction until
the 15th, when they struck off, steering an average south-west
course, following the line of a creek called by Mr. Gregory,
Sturt's Creek, which they travelled for nearly three hundred
miles, when they traced it into the bed of a then dry salt lake;
beyond which the whole country to the south seemed one vast
desert, destitute of any indications of the existence of water.
They, therefore, on March 5, abandoned all hope of penetrating
further in a southerly direction, and started on their return.
After leaving Sturt's Creek, they crossed a ridge about 1,700
feet above the sea, and then came upon another creek, which they
named Sterling Creek, and supposed to fall into Cambridge Gulf.
Thence they pushed on for the depôt camp, where they arrived on
the 28th, and found all the party left in charge in good health
and order. The ration of the explorers per diem had been 1 lb. of
flour, 1-5th lb. of pork, and 2 ozs. of sugar&mdash;not exactly
the diet of a Sybarite. After three days rest, Mr. Gregory again
started to examine the country to the eastward of the depôt camp,
returning on April 17, and thence after some minor investigation,
reaching the principal camp on the Victoria River on May 9. The
schooner was yet completing her repairs&mdash;the carpenter had
died, some of the crew were sick, but the men connected with the
expedition were all in good health. The result of this portion of
the exploration had been to conclusively demonstrate the
uselessness of the Victoria River for reaching the interior, and
to dissipate the expectations that had been founded on a contrary
supposition.</p>
<p>On a review of his own position, Mr. Gregory determined that
it would be best to send the schooner&mdash;reinforcing her crew
by some of his own men&mdash;to Coepang, in the island of Timor,
where a supply of rice, sugar, and other stores could be got.
These obtained, he directed that she should sail for the Albert
River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, he and his party pursuing
their journey together by land in the discharge of the second
portion of their task&mdash;the connection of the Albert with the
Victoria by a practicable route. This expedition finally
consisted of Mr. Gregory and his brother, Dr. Müller, Mr. Elsey,
and three others. Amongst the preparations for a start, I notice
the making of meat biscuits, thus described&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"6 lbs. of flour were added to each 6 lb. tin of
preserved beef with the whole of the fat and gravy, and 1 oz. of
salt (no water being required); the whole being worked up into a
stiff dough, and baked in the ordinary form and size of sea
biscuit, the whole weight of which was 8 lbs. Thus 11 lb. of
biscuit was equal to 1 lb. of meat and 1 lb. of
flour."</blockquote>
<p>On June 21 they started; and, after a journey marked by no
particular occurrence, reached the Albert on August 31, when they
were disappointed at not finding any sign of the <i>Tom
Tough</i>.* Marking a tree, therefore, and burying a tin
cannister with some papers, in case she should arrive,
they&mdash;abandoning any idea of connecting their route with the
termination of Sir Thomas Mitchell's journey as impracticable
with the means at their disposal&mdash;entered upon the last part
of their exploration: the tracing a route from the Albert
easterly to Moreton Bay. Crossing the Plains of Promise of
Stokes, they turned northward to the Gilbert River, which they
reached on September 21. They then struck in a south-easterly
direction, and by October 30 arrived at the junction of the
Suttor with the Burdekin. By November 15 they came upon the
Mackenzie, which they followed up until they reached the coast,
and, just below the junction of the two, found the remains of a
camp of Leichhardt's, in his second expedition. Thence steering
east, by the 21st they reached the Dawson, and, on the next day,
a station then held by Messrs. Fitz and Connor. The journey to
Brisbane was then comparatively easy, and Mr. Gregory reached
Brisbane, as I have said, on December 16. Of the thirty-four
horses with which he left the Victoria River, he had twenty-nine
remaining, and had sold one; and his stores and equipment
generally bail been found more than sufficient.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This vessel left the Victoria River on July
22, reached Coepang on the 25th, and, being found unfit for the
further service of the expedition, was sent to Sourabaya, and
sold.]</p>
<p>As to the geological nature of the country travelled over, or
its value for pastoral or agricultural settlement, it will be
sufficient to say that Mr. Gregory's contributions at the time
were valuable and interesting, and added much to the then
existing limited stock of knowledge. More noteworthy was the
deliberate caution, yet at no sacrifice of time, with which every
step was taken, and the general immunity from sickness or
accident which characterised the expedition under his immediate
charge throughout its course. He added to his reputation as a
cool and courageous explorer, and established what was of equal
importance, his character as eminently a safe one. There was
nothing sensational attempted; none of what is generally termed
"dash"; but what was to be done, and how, were fully weighed, and
when determined carried thoroughly out; and thus the expedition
was not the least useful, while it certainly was one of the best
conducted and successful of our Australian explorations.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">It</span> may seem somewhat in contradiction
to my usual course that I have grouped the occurrences of the
last three years of this narrative into a single chapter, but in
the history of a district like Moreton Bay, there are periods of
what may be called repetition&mdash;when the current of events in
one year so recalls those of its predecessor, and prefigures what
may be expected in the next, that the monotony of recapitulation
becomes tiresome, and the reader longs for variety of incident
and rapidity of action. I do not conceal from myself that the
years 1857-8-9 afford little, except towards the end of 1859,
that would excite the attention of nine-tenths of the present
population of Queensland. They were years of suspense, and not
unfrequently of tantalizing uncertainty. The people felt that
separation was secured, but its precise shape and the details of
its final accomplishment were still subjects for conjecture. The
delays of Sir William Denison in reporting on the questions
submitted to him, as to details, by the Colonial Office, the
hindrances opposed at every step by the New South Wales
Government, and the extraordinary misapprehension by the Imperial
authorities as to the legal and formal measures to be taken,
together with Ministerial changes in England, combined to delay
the actual proclamation of the new colony for nearly three years
after its separation had been determined upon.</p>
<p>The feeling towards the district, of the legislature and the
leading public men of New South Wales, was one of exasperation,
tending to obstruction in every possible form; but there were
some administrative measures so obviously necessary, as well as
just, that they could not be withheld. The bill for the
establishment of a branch of the Supreme Court, with a resident
judge in the district, having been at length passed, Mr. Justice
Milford was appointed to the judgeship, and formally opened his
court in Brisbane on April 15, 1857. But, this Act proving
defective, another was enacted, by which the former one, with the
exception of the clause under which Mr. Justice Milford was made
a resident judge, was repealed. The new measure authorised, in
addition, the appointment of a Crown prosecutor, a sheriff, a
registrar of the Supreme Court in Moreton Bay, an official
assignee in insolvency, and a curator of intestate estates. The
judge himself was to act as commissioner in insolvency for the
district; whence arose the absurdity, long continued, of an
appeal from the decisions of the commissioner to the same person
as judge. Mr.&mdash;now Mr. Justice&mdash;Ratcliffe Pring, whose
professional and political career forms no inconsiderable portion
of the subsequent history of the colony, was appointed Crown
Prosecutor; the late Mr. W. A. Brown, Sheriff; and the late Mr.
Pickering, Official Assignee. In the course of time, grumblings
arose in Brisbane at the frequent absences of Mr. Justice Milford
from the seat of his jurisdiction, and in Sydney there was a mild
jocularity at his expense, touching his supposed angling
achievements, in which pursuit it pleased the wits of that
metropolis to assume that the Judge found his almost sole
employment. It was well understood that he did not himself
particularly enjoy his residence in this locality, and was not
sorry when legal exigencies, real or supposed, compelled his
return to the more varied enjoyments which Sydney could afford.
Whether it was sympathy with Mr. Justice Milford's banishment, or
a real desire for his aid on the Sydney judicial bench, that
moved Mr. Plunkett, I cannot say, but in the session of 1858-9 he
brought in a bill "to enable the Governor, from time to time, to
appoint a barrister to act temporarily as assistant district
judge at Moreton Bay, and for other purposes therein mentioned."
Whatever might have been the motive for this attempt, it failed;
but it was not long before a change took place, acceptable enough
to the parties most concerned, although assailed by others with
all the bitterness of personal dislike, as well as of political
hostility.</p>
<p>For, in September, 1857, the Parker administration of New
South Wales resigned, and a new Ministry was formed, on what were
called "liberal" principles. The late Sir Charles&mdash;then Mr.
Charles&mdash;Cowper (afterwards Agent-General in London for New
South Wales) was the Premier; Mr. R. Campbell, Colonial
Treasurer; Mr. T. A. Murray, Secretary for Lands; Mr. James
Martin&mdash;now Sir James, and Chief Justice of New South
Wales&mdash;Attorney-General; and Mr. A. J. P. Lutwyche,&mdash;
Solicitor-General. A hostile vote led to a dissolution, and
ultimately to a change&mdash;Mr. John Robertson&mdash;now Sir
John, but familiarly known as "Free Selection Jack"&mdash;taking
the Lands portfolio. Towards the end of 1858 dissensions ensued
between the Attorney-General and his colleagues, partly from,
what were called, his conservative tendencies&mdash;which were
said to have manifested themselves in a carelessness and
inattention to his official duties, which, in one instance, led
to a vote of censure on the whole Ministry&mdash;and partly, as
he is reported to have explained, from dislike to the direction
which he saw Mr. Cowper's politics were taking. At the request of
the Premier, Mr. Martin resigned; and Mr. Lutwyche succeeded him
as Attorney-General. At this time it was understood that Mr.
Justice Therry was about to resign, contemplating a visit to
Europe, and there immediately arose a fierce party contest as to
who should take his place; but it was soon known that Mr. Justice
Milford would be recalled to Sydney, while the Attorney-General
would, in the ordinary course of succession, be appointed to his
seat. In due time these appointments were made, Mr. Lutwyche
being sworn in and gazetted on February 22, 1859, as judge of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales, and arriving in Brisbane on
March 8. His elevation to the Bench was the cause of some
exceedingly bitter debates in the New South Wales Parliament, in
which private, as well as political, animosity seems to have
prevailed with his assailants, to the exclusion of all sense of
public justice. That he would fail as a judge, was predicted with
a confidence as full as the contradiction which his more than
twenty years subsequent judicial career abundantly furnished.</p>
<p>The legislation of this period possesses but a slight interest
for Queensland. The Electoral Act, to which I have before
referred, was, from the causes I have mentioned, inoperative
here, except as to the interim elections between its passing and
the formal separation of the district from New South Wales. It
gave nine members to the then northern districts, but was
received with only a slight degree of attention which what
feeling could be evoked by a temporary representation, could not
fan into enthusiasm&mdash;even when the influence that a present
success might exercise in the choice of members for the future
local Legislative Assembly was accorded the weight supposed to be
its due. The New South Wales Legislative Assembly was dissolved
in April 1859; the writs for the new one were issued in the
following May, but the news of the formal completion of the
separation arrangements arrived before the date at which the last
was returnable. Mr. Robertson, however, had expounded his land
policy&mdash;which in our colonial legislation has something more
than historic value. Its principal points were:&mdash;a reduction
in the upset price of lands sold by auction to five shillings per
acre; a right of free selection over all country lands, surveyed
or unsurveyed, at a fixed price of £1 per acre, half the purchase
money being paid on selection, the remainder by deferred
payments; and the determination of the minimum area open to
selection by any one person at 80 acres, and the maximum at 320.
Commenting upon this Mr. Macalister, at Ipswich, on June 25,
said, "Though I have a very favourable leaning to the Cowper
Ministry I object to the Land Bill, which, if passed, would be
ruin to the country;" nor was he unsupported in this opinion,
even by the most popular candidates of the day. But separation
left the remodelling of the land policy of the new colony to its
own legislature; and, except as indications of the direction that
might be taken, these expressions of opinion were of no
importance. The elections resulted in the return of Mr.
Richardson for Brisbane, Mr. R. Cribb for East Moreton, Mr.
Macalister for Ipswich, Mr. John Douglas and Mr. Wm. Handcock for
the Darling Downs, and Mr. W. H. Walsh for the Leichhardt. Mr.
Clarke Irving was again elected for the Clarence district, and
Mr. Hodgson, who had taken the management of the Australian
Agricultural Company's business in New South Wales, now found an
aristocratic refuge amongst the colliers of Newcastle, adjoining
which port the coal mines of the Company were situated.</p>
<p>The new Assessment Act was, as was natural, received with no
small dissatisfaction, open and unexpressed. The rates paid by
the pastoral lessees up to this time were a halfpenny for every
sheep (or twenty-one shillings and eightpence per thousand),
three halfpence for every head of cattle, and threepence for
every horse which were upon any run, or which the run was
estimated to be capable of carrying. These rates were now
increased to seven pounds ten shillings for every thousand sheep,
and proportionately for cattle and horses. And the method of
fixing the rents on new and renewed leases in the settled
districts was also altered. Under the Orders in Council they had
been £10 for the first four thousand sheep and £2 10s. for every
additional thousand: they were now to be charged for renewal at
the rate of £2 per square mile, and for new leases at £1. These
increases were calculated to add considerably to the revenue, and
abridge more than was liked the squatter's profits, and the
squatters were proportionately angry. Some of them had recourse
to Mr. Martin, who gave a legal opinion that the Act was illegal,
he having been nevertheless Attorney-General in the Ministry by
whom it was brought in. Mr. Lutwyche, his successor, effectually
controverted that opinion, and the Act was carried out in the
usual way. A somewhat amusing incident occurred in the course of
the opposition to this measure. Several gentlemen in the Burnett
district met at Gayndah in January, 1859, and were valorous in
their protests against it. They pledged themselves to resist the
Act by every means in their power&mdash;they even agreed to raise
a fund to defray the costs of an appeal to the law courts, by
contributions proportionate it amount to the number of sheep upon
their runs; they made an immediate call of half-a-crown per
thousand sheep to defray current expenses&mdash;and their
fellow-squatters who read the advertisements in which these
proceedings were published, were no doubt much comforted by the
valiancy of their volunteer defenders. In due time the owners of
222,000 sheep and 2,560 cattle signed the required undertaking.
The following July witnessed the entire collapse of the alliance:
it met with no outside support and the Assessment Act was
therefore safe. Tho sole memorial of their patriotism left to the
members were the advertisements and the receipts for payment for
their insertion. The impression I derive from a careful
consideration of all the facts is, that the runs were known to be
generally assessed at a carrying power much below their real
capacity and that the Act was designed to meet a contingency
which could not otherwise be easily, if at all, provided for.</p>
<p>Municipal institutions were pet topics for eulogy with Sir
William Denison, who regarded them as academies wherein men
rising in social position amongst their fellows might in time
learn to become legislators and in this opinion he found a
subsequent and earnest supporter in Sir George Bowen. Undoubtedly
as regards forms and method in public business, and as developing
readiness for co-operation and a proportionate sacrifice of
individual will in administrative matters, the value of such
institutions was not overrated by these Governors; but, as
fitting the persons engaged in them for the higher and in some
respects opposite business of general legislation, their
influence may be questioned, as more likely to produce a
deteriorative than a beneficial effect. Mill, in his admirable
treatise on representative government, has discussed the question
with his accustomed logical and analytical power, and in a more
that usually practical direction, and his conclusions seem
directly contrary to those I have indicated as arrived at by Sir
William Denison and Sir George Bowen. Those who desire to see in
how masterly a manner he dealt with the subject will find their
time well spent in a careful perusal of the great logician and
economist's essay.</p>
<p>But Sir William Denison was not content to be a theorist, and
the first Municipalities Act in these colonies (22 Vic., No. 13,
N.S.W.) understood to have been pushed forward all the more
vigorously for hearty exertions towards its enactment. It was
assented to on October 27, 1858, and, running to ninety-six
clauses, dealt with a variety of power: and duties which it is
unnecessary to refer to in detail, inasmuch as we had our own Act
emendatory of that, and which itself supplied another instance of
the ordinary character of legislation by, in its turn, requiring
further amendment. The residents of Brisbane and Ipswich were
soon engaged in discussing the desirability of availing
themselves of the provisions of the new measure, and assuming the
management of their own local affairs. It was necessary to
petition the Governor in Council to proclaim a municipality, to
fix its boundaries, and to provide for the first election of a
Municipal Council. The people of Ipswich were first in the field,
and met on December 9, 1858, when the necessary petition was
submitted to the meeting; but the meeting was not in accord from
the beginning, a suggestion to divide the proposed municipality
into three wards being condemned by some, and the titles of
chairman and councillors being preferred by others to those of
mayor and aldermen&mdash;the latter falling for the time into
disfavour as savouring of turtle-eating propensities. After some
discussion a committee was appointed to correspond with the
Government respecting the retention of wharfage and ferry dues,
and other reservations; to consider if a municipality were
desirable, and to report the result to a subsequent meeting. An
adjournment then took place to the following February, to afford
time for the committee to perfect their work. They were, however,
ready on January 19, 1859, when they reported in favour of a
municipality and its division into three wards, and the
designation of the new municipal representatives as chairman and
councillors. On the adoption of this report being moved at a
meeting called to receive it, great dissension arose, and an
amendment was moved that a municipality would be premature. When
the chairman of the meeting declared the amendment to be carried
a division was called for, and a scene of confusion arose which
rendered a further adjournment necessary. A third meeting was
held in a few days, when no satisfactory decision seems to have
been arrived at, although the opponents of a municipality claimed
the victory. Ultimately, a petition in favour of incorporation,
signed by the principal holders of property in the town, was sent
to the Governor of New South Wales, who left it as a matter to be
dealt with by the authorities of the new colony, and it was not
until March, 1860, that Ipswich was proclaimed a
municipality.</p>
<p>The first Brisbane meeting was held in the School of Arts on
December 13, 1853, and, in the words of the notice, to consider
the propriety of petitioning for the application of the Act to
Brisbane. The petition brought forward was opposed on the ground
that the then prospect of speedy separation rendered it
inexpedient to take any such step. The opposition, however, was
for the time fruitless. Much public correspondence then took
place on the value of the properties to be assessed, and the
probable expense of a corporation, the modest sum of £550 per
annum being set down by one side for salaries, of which the mayor
was to receive £200; while on the other it was predicted that the
cost of administration would absorb the proceeds of the rates. A
counter petition was prepared, circulated, signed, and forwarded;
the signatures for and against incorporation being 181 and 240.
On the publication of the protesting document in the
<i>Government Gazette</i>, a large and noisy meeting was held in
the School of Arts, ostensibly for the purpose of enquiring into
the genuineness of the signatures attached to it, but principally
to carry a memorial to the Government, in which that genuineness
was denied. Some effect was produced by the reading of a letter
from the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, in reply to an
application for a grant of money towards the repair of the
water-reservoir. It was a curiosity in its way&mdash;erroneous in
its premises, logical in its conclusions, terse and dogmatic in
its expression. Starting with the assumption that "any place
possessing a considerable share of population would necessarily
incorporate itself under the Municipalities Act, in which case
water supply would properly fall within the duties of the
Corporation, and that when a district was not sufficiently
advanced for the purpose, expenditure of the kind would be
unjustifiable." It proceeded,&mdash;"either Brisbane is in such
an advanced state or it is not; if it is, then it should be
incorporated&mdash;and if it is not, money should not be expended
in supplying it with water." Ultimately, the meeting condemned
the counter petition; and a memorial to the Governor, denying its
integrity, was decided upon. This, apparently, had the desired
weight&mdash;for after some delay, and on September 7, 1859, the
Municipality of Brisbane was proclaimed. The first election took
place on October 12, and the poll, declared on the 13th, gave
names of the following gentlemen as those of the first Municipal
Council in Queensland:&mdash;John Petrie, Patrick Mayne, T. B.
Stephens, Joshua Jeays, A. J. Hockings, G. Edmondstone, R. Cribb,
Geo. Warren, and W. S. Sutton. Of these at this time four
survive&mdash;Messrs. T. B. Stephens, Jeays, Mayne, Warren, and
Sutton no longer live to see the result of the labours they
assisted in initiating. At the first meeting of the Council Mr.
Petrie was unanimously elected Mayor.</p>
<p>I have given more space to the preliminary proceedings of the
first two municipalities than I should have done had they not
been the first, for generally the course in such matters is so
nearly the same in all cases that it requires very special
circumstances to justify special notice of any particular one.
Here, as it seemed to me, an unusual interest did attach to the
two in question, because they were the first in the colony; and,
perhaps, their not least noticeable characteristic was that, even
at a period when the desire for self-government was apparently
most intense, there was no inconsiderable number in the two
principal towns in the district who were averse to the
responsibilities it involved, while the rest, if disposed to
enjoy the privilege, were equally so to, if possible, enjoy it
with as little of the expense it might incur as could well be
managed.</p>
<p>During this, what may be called anticipatory, period, there
was a sort of feverish excitement as to the existence of a
payable goldfield within, or nigh to, the boundaries of the
district. Occasional finds, as at Boonoo Boonoo and Tooloom on
the New England side, roused the public anticipations, only to
disappoint them; but the year 1858 was remarkable for one of the
most extraordinary manias that has ever raged since the first
discovery of gold in New South Wales. From a letter to the
Government from Captain O'Connell, who, on the abolition of the
Government residentship at Port Curtis, had been appointed
Commissioner of Crown lands, it appears that that gentleman
having occasion to make an official tour in the North, in
November, 1857, took with him a practical miner, and in the
course of his explorations obtained about a pennyweight of fine
gold. Following upon this, the people of Gladstone subscribed a
fund to enable a party of six persons to prosecute the search. On
July 28, 1858, the Commissioner was enabled to say, from private
information, that an easily accessible and remunerative goldfield
was discovered. Other correspondence with mercantile firms spoke
in sanguine language of the diggings as the best in the colony.
In the <i>Courier</i> of the same date it was reported that gold
in good-sized nuggets had been found at Canoona; and that at a
meeting held at Gladstone to receive the report of the explorers,
who attended with their specimens, they gave as their opinion
that men could on those diggings earn from fifteen to twenty
shillings per day. As the site of the goldfield was only seven
miles from the Fitzroy River, and thirty from the then forming
township of Rockhampton, considerable excitement was caused by
the intelligence. Towards the end of August came "reliable news."
The miners on the spot, who now numbered about eighty, were
reported to be in good spirits, and positive of success&mdash;one
of them making sixteen ounces in as many days; and soon after
Gladstone was described as deserted. Early in September about
eighty ounces of gold arrived in Sydney, and immediately the
<i>Yarra Yarra</i> and <i>Pirate</i>, steamers, and nine sailing
vessels, were laid on for the diggings, and the newspapers began
to speculate on the result; the <i>Sydney Herald</i> suggesting
that Gladstone would probably be the capital of the proposed
northern colony, and the <i>Courier</i> finding strong reasons
for believing that, "in the final adjustment of the colonial
boundaries, New South Wales would be bounded, on the north, by
the 30th parallel, and that Port Curtis would be a new political
centre for a colony immediately to the northward of Cooksland."
Private letters continued to bring, in vague terms, favourable
accounts of the capabilities of the new field, and fresh parties
of diggers began to pour in. Nine vessels were laid on at
Melbourne, and both from that port and Sydney a rush of a most
formidable character set in. By September 21, fifteen hundred
persons had left Sydney for the new field. On the 27th, the
arrival in Brisbane of Mr. Hamilton Ramsay (lately a Northern
goldfields warden), who had travelled overland from Canoona, with
one hundred ounces of gold, startled the people from their usual
staid propriety, and a meeting was proposed to concert measures
for establishing a regular line of communication between
Rockhampton and Moreton Bay, commencing with a steamer and at
least two schooners. In vain was it pointed out that, after all,
the yield of gold was insignificant compared with the number
engaged in searching for it; the warning was received with a
pitying incredulity. But the news began to fluctuate in its
character before the crowds who had left Victoria began to
arrive; the excitement on the goldfields of that colony, caused
by the first and most flattering intelligence, being only to be
described as intense. From Sandhurst, from Castlemaine, from
Ballarat, and from their tributary goldfields, continuous lines
of diggers were encountered on the roads to the ports. When they
were questioned why, they could only say that they were going to
the Canoona; but, as to the nature of that goldfield, or the
yield that had been, or was likely to be, obtained from it, vague
rumours and ridiculous exaggerations were all that was to be got
from them. Men left claims returning them an average wage,
withdrew their money from the Savings Bank, shouldered their
swags, and started on the tramp, without being able to assign the
most remote approach to a tangible cause for their procedure. The
Victorian journals denounced this folly, and insisted upon the
prudence of waiting for more certain information, while some of
them had recourse to such intimidation as might be obtained from
doleful descriptions of the climate and general unhealthiness of
the new field; indeed, from some accounts by travellers
professing to have had personal experience in the north of
Australia, Moreton Bay generally, and its northern country
especially, might be supposed as fertile in only two
products&mdash;sweet potatoes and snakes. But it was all in vain.
Twenty-five sailing vessels and three steamers were reported as
laid on at one time at Melbourne for Rockhampton, and on the
miners continued to pour, until the news reached Melbourne that
the first arrivals found only a small and worked-out field. In
the meantime, the influx of population rendered some attempt at
government indispensable. An assistant gold commissioner, a
sub-gold commissioner, a sub-collector of customs, and a
landing-waiter and tide-surveyor, and a small police force, were
sent to Rockhampton, which had been proclaimed a township.
Captain O'Connell, who had been gazetted, on September 17, as a
gold commissioner, forwarded a report on the 27th, in which,
while still expressing faith in the field, he confessed that he
looked with some alarm at the unusual numbers said to be on their
way, and feared that much disappointment and individual distress
would be the result. By the middle of October it was known, both
in Brisbane and Sydney, that the supposed auriferous wealth of
the district existed principally in the imagination, and that
great misery existed there; while a considerable number of the
later arrivals returned by the vessels in which they came. There
was some tendency to riot, and much wrath indulged in, at, what
was termed, a swindling imposition. The inexcusable and
unaccountable folly of the angry men was really most to blame.
Captain O'Connell had much trouble in dealing with the
disappointed adventurers, and his treatment of them was eulogised
in the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, at the time, as equally firm and
conciliatory. On October 7 the numbers on the diggings were
reduced to between four and five hundred; by the 15th they were
reduced to two hundred and fifty, and thereafter, by degress, the
field became deserted. In all, not less than ten thousand people
were reported as having been attracted to the shores of the
Fitzroy by this extraordinary delusion. One good resulted from
it. A site was surveyed for a township at Rockhampton, and the
first land sales were held in Sydney on November 17 and 18.
Captain O'Connell became again Resident at Port Curtis, and the
other gold commissioners, I presume, went their ways. When the
land sale was held a great number of lots were offered, and
nearly all were sold. The average prices were, for half an
allotment facing the river, £70; and for back allotments,
£17.</p>
<p>During, and after, this, efforts were made, from time to time,
to fit out searching parties, and rewards were offered for the
discovery of gold, but without any tangible result. Reports more
or less encouraging came in, and there the matter usually ended.
Accident, then as now, had most to do in confirming the
inferences of science; and, as yet, no lucky traveller stumbled
over a nugget half-buried in his track, and brown with the
colouring with which long exposure had invested it. I imagine
that desire so quickened credulity that, in some instances, the
gold seekers, real or supposed, traded not unprofitably on the
product.</p>
<p>Disappointed, as they might be at the failure of every
experimental search for gold, and by the rapid exhaustion of such
fields as, from time to time, excited their hopes, the people of
the then northern districts still had, in the gradual development
of their trade springing from the extending occupation of the
country, some consolation. They were able to point to their
tables of exports with the satisfaction that their increasing
columns might be supposed calculated to produce. Although,
possibly, it was somewhat dimmed by the monotonous character of
the articles exported&mdash;a monotony which scarcely bespoke the
existence of an intelligent enterprise in the community in which
it occurred. Still, if we look at the progress made in the
interval between the time that the district was opened for
settlement and the date of separation, it had, under all the
disadvantages which had to be contended against, been quite
sufficient to justify the anticipation that when they were
removed there awaited the young colony a busy and prosperous
career.</p>
<p>There had, to be sure, been little effort at increasing the
varieties of industry of which the soil and climate and natural
product were susceptible. Cotton languished of good symptoms, and
when Mr. Fleming established a flour-mill in connection with his
saw-mill on the Bremer River, near Ipswich, he imported wheat
from Adelaide for grinding. Dr. Hobbs utilised the oil of the
dugong (a marine animal sufficiently curious to justify a
particular description in a future chapter) for medical purposes,
and at one time indulged in the hope that it would become a
valuable export; but no sooner were its qualities appreciated
than wretched imitations were manufactured to such an extent,
that a greater quantity was sold in Melbourne alone than was
procured in Moreton Bay. Immigration to the district was languid.
Dr. Lang's land and immigration bill was brought before the New
South Wales Parliament once more, and some extension of the
powers conferred by it seems to have been sought, but the advent
of Separation left the scheme a legacy to the future Queensland
Parliament, before whom it never, as a project, came; and
finally, except as to its value as indicating a system, it
vanished in the limbo which awaits the efforts of all who have
the misfortune to be a little in advance of their time, and to
have sufficient enthusiasm or folly not to perceive their
position. The irregularity, fraud, and inhumanity which
characterised much of the management of the German immigration to
the colony evoked Legislative inquiry and Legislative censure,
but too late to exert any effect upon the system as respected
Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>The black population were, during this period of transition,
at constant war with the squatters and settlers. In October,
1857, they attacked a station at Hornet Bank, on the Dawson,
where they murdered eleven persons, only one of the unfortunate
family who were settled there being left. In the Burnett and the
Leichhardt districts they were continual causes of terror. A
committee of the New South Wales Legislative Council was
appointed to enquire into and report upon this most
unsatisfactory state of things; but their labours had no
practical result; philanthropy and economy combining to leave the
aboriginal marauders to work their will, and thus a war of
reprisals, sometimes ending in extermination, became almost a
matter of necessity. The outlying districts were left, in great
measure, unprotected, or only intermittently and inefficiently
guarded, up to the date of separation.</p>
<p>In the towns the efforts at social advancement were, if not
always judicious, yet not without zeal. There was sometimes a
plethora of lectures at the Brisbane School of Arts, some of
which, if I am to judge by the printed reports&mdash;in the
majority of cases apparently verbatim&mdash;would have been
instructive, had they awakened interest. A choral society was
formed, and seems to have been at least temporarily successful.
Another School of Arts was inaugurated at Ipswich, not without
much dispute and bickering; and a third at Toowoomba, where a
gift by Mr. Handcock of a site tended greatly to dulcify the
proceedings. The religious element in the little society was
stimulated to unwonted activity by the late Rev. B. G. Wilson's
arrival in Brisbane to take charge of the Baptist congregation
there on September 12, 1858; and about that time considerable
energy was shown in advocating the indispensability to the
Christian of adult baptism and immersion. Whether it was that the
tenet itself was unwelcome to Mr. Wilson's clerical
contemporaries, or the way in which it was enforced by its
adherents, disliked, it is not now necessary to enquire; whatever
might be the cause, the air became darkened with controversy;
sermons, lectures, pamphlets, and advertisements followed each
other in quick and inharmonious succession. One pamphlet, in
particular, entitled "Whither are we drifting?" in which the
resources of typography, in capitals and italics, were
emphatically "displayed" in illustration of the arguments,
eliciting a running fire of replies and rejoinders highly
profitable to the proprietors of newspapers, whose theology was
not ardent enough to induce them to insert the rival productions
in any other guise than that of advertisements. Possibly, from
this cause, the dispute in time languished, and the
ecclesiastical condition resumed its usual quietude. Yet all the
energy was not of one kind. The building of chapels proceeded.
St. Paul's Church, Ipswich, was finished and opened; and if the
new buildings did not add much to the architectural beauty of
their respective localities, they bore much testimony to the
liberality of those who subscribed towards their erection.
Unconnected with the circumstances I have just alluded to, though
connected with the general subject, was the erection of Brisbane
into a Roman Catholic See, and the election of Dr. James Quinn as
its Bishop, both of which were duly notified by Archbishop
Polding in a pastoral dated August 28, 1859.</p>
<p>The contributions of the New South Wales Government to the
public progress were few. The harbour of Moreton Bay remained as
it was, but some efforts were made to improve the navigation of
the Brisbane and Bremer by the removal of fallen timber and other
obstructions. A new Court-house was built at Ipswich, and the
long-promised new gaol at Brisbane was commenced. It may be
regretted that the chronic procrastination of the authorities had
not been still more marked as to the gaol, which might well have
claimed the bad eminence of being about the worst for its purpose
of such buildings in the colonies&mdash;whether as regards
health, convenience, or supervision. The colonial architect's
office in Sydney was not at that time distinguished by any
special ability, either in invention or copyism, but it is fair
to add that the Governor was said to have assisted in deciding
upon the arrangement of the unlucky structure. In the Lands
Department a proposal to lease the islands of Moreton Bay was
resisted with more than usual vigour, and the attempt was
abandoned. An application for a Recreation Reserve and Botanic
Gardens at Ipswich was more successful.</p>
<p>Some changes took place consequent upon the appointment of Mr.
Justice Lutwyche as the resident Judge. On October 12, 1859,
circuit courts were proclaimed at Ipswich, Drayton, and
Maryborough, to the great relief of all who were interested in
litigation in the places named; and the salaries of the Crown
Prosecutor and the Sheriff, which had been fixed at absurdly low
amounts, were raised to sums more proportionate to the
responsibility of their positions: the first from £200 per annum
to £500, the second from £150 to £450. Outside legal promotions,
I notice the advancement of Mr. Duncan, who had been many years
Collector of Customs here, to the headship of the department in
Sydney, his place being taken by Mr. Wm. Thornton, who has
retained it ever since.</p>
<p>From law and government to literature is a transition more
easy than the reverse one; and I now chronicle the issue of two
new journals in the colony&mdash;the <i>Darling Downs
Gazette</i>, the first number of which was published in Drayton,
on June 11, 1858; and the <i>Ipswich Herald</i>, which commenced
a not very lengthened career on July 4, 1859. The <i>Darling
Downs Gazette</i> was started by Mr. Lyons, the originator, as I
have narrated, of the <i>Courier</i>, but his new speculation
seems to have resulted in as little profit to himself as credit
to some of his supporters. The <i>Courier</i> itself twice
changed its management during the period whose history is
comprised within this chapter. Mr. Charles Lilley, the present
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in partnership with Mr.
Belbridge, a printer of some reputation, rented it from Mr. Swan,
on October 1, 1857 (fifteen months after Mr. Labouchere's
despatch announcing the determination of the Imperial Government
to separate Moreton Bay from New South Wales), but after a year's
trial surrendered it back into his hands. The only good that
seemed to have resulted from this, said the <i>North
Australian</i>, was that the issue had become tri-weekly, and the
circulation had increased&mdash;not a singular instance of how a
sneer sometimes unintentionally conveys a compliment. On October
1, 1859, Mr. Swan sold the paper to the late Mr. T. B. Stephens,
in whose hands it remained about fifteen years. I have omitted to
mention that Mr. Wilkes had retired from the
editorship&mdash;leaving the district for Sydney. The year 1859
is also noticeable as that in which the first issue of the
well-known <i>Pugh's Almanac</i> took place&mdash;a work which,
well commenced, was carried on with great completeness and
success by Mr. Pugh for some years, and under its present
management maintains its reputation as one of the best
periodicals of its kind in the colonies.</p>
<p>The year 1858 was marked by one of the most bold and
successful explorations in the history of Australian adventure.
The anxiety expressed as to the fate of Leichhardt had
strengthened with the lapse of time, until, at length, the
Government of New South Wales determined on an expedition in
search of what traces might remain of him and his party. The
expedition was placed in charge of Mr. A. C. Gregory, who, after
some unavoidable delays, collected his party and completed his
arrangements towards the end of March. The expedition comprised
eight persons besides himself, and they took with them thirty-one
pack-horses and nine saddle horses&mdash;the pack-horses carrying
at first an average load of 150 lbs. each. The provisions for the
journey were the dried meat of two bullocks and four sheep,
reduced by removing the bones and drying to 300 lbs.; 500 lbs.
bacon, 160 lbs. flour, 100 lbs. rice, 350 lbs. sugar, 60 lbs.
tea, 40 lbs. tobacco, and some minor articles. The other
equipments were of the simplest and lightest practicable kind.
Leaving Juandah, the Messrs. Royds' station, on the Dawson, they
crossed the basaltic ridge that divides the eastern waters
flowing to that river from those trending to the west into the
basin of the Maranoa, a tributary of which they followed
westward, and reached the river itself in latitude 25 deg. 41
min. Thence they found a practicable route to the tributaries of
the Warrego, and pursued their course to the Nive, and NNW. until
they reached the Victoria of Mitchell, when they found the bed of
the river scarcely ten yards wide, and perfectly dry. Continuing
their route along the Victoria, and examining the country on both
sides, they came not far from latitude 24 deg. 27 min. longitude
146 deg. 13 min., on a marked tree, and other traces of one of
Leichhardt's camps. They then struck upon the Alice River, and
followed it clown to its junction with the Thompson, up which
they continued their route&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing could be more desolate than the aspect of
the country. Except the few trees which grew on the immediate
bank of the river, there was scarcely a tree left alive, while
the plains were quite bare of vegetation, except a few
salsolaceous bushes. At the distance of five miles low ridges of
red drift sand showed the desert character of all around; even
the lower surfaces of the clouds assumed a lurid tinge from the
reflection of the bare surface of red sand. . . We however,
succeeded in reaching latitude 23 degs. 47 mins., when the
absence of water and grass&mdash;the rain not having extended so
far north, and the channels of the river separating into small
gullies, and spreading on the wide plains&mdash;precluded our
progressing further north or west, and the only prospect of
saving our horses was to return south as quickly as
possible."</blockquote>
<p>They then determined to follow the Thompson down to trace its
outlet, thinking that Leichhardt, under similar circumstances,
might have been driven to the south-west. The journey was
harassing and toilsome; but, at length, reaching the branch of
Cooper's Creek, named by Sturt Streletzki Creek, they travelled
mostly along it until its junction with Lake Torrens, and thence
to Adelaide, where they were received with great enthusiasm. I
regret that my space will not admit of copious extracts from Mr.
Gregory's report of the journey whose results, with reference to
the physical geography of Australia, were most important; but his
conclusion as to the fate of Leichhardt cannot well be
omitted&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"With reference to the probable fate of Dr.
Leichhardt, it is evident from the existence of the marked camp
nearly eighty miles beyond those seen by Mr. Hely, that the
account given to that gentleman by the natives of the murder of
the party was untrue, and I am inclined to think only a revival
of the report current during Leichhardt's first journey to Port
Essington. Nor is it probable that they were destroyed until they
had left the Victoria, as, if killed by the natives, the
scattered bones of the horses and cattle would have been observed
during our search. I am therefore of opinion that they left the
river at the junction of the Alice, and, favoured by thunder
showers, penetrated the level desert country to the north-west,
in which case, on the cessation of the rain, the party would not
only be deprived of a supply of water for the outward journey,
but be unable to retreat, as the shallow deposits of rain water
would evaporate in a few days, and it is not likely that they
would commence a retrograde movement until the strength of the
party had been severely taxed in the attempt to
advance."</blockquote>
<p>In 1859, a party was fitted out, headed by the late George
Elphinstone Dalrymple, to explore the country on the Burdekin,
and ascertain its suitability for pastoral occupation. They were,
I believe, well satisfied with the capabilities of the district;
but the early land legislation of the colony interfered with the
realization of their views as to investment or occupation.</p>
<p>I have said that although the general question of separation
was settled by Mr. Labouchere's despatch, there was much
uncertainty as to the adjustment of its details. To this result
the resolutions initiated by Mr. Hargreaves, and carried through
the Sydney Legislature, as I have before described, in no small
degree contributed. These were reinforced by petitions from the
border districts, whose appropriation was in dispute and hostile
to separation from the parent colony; in that of New England,
especially, great efforts were made to procure signatures, and,
in many instances, with a total disregard of honesty in attaching
them&mdash;a considerable number of those who signed, or were
supposed to have signed, living to the south of the boundary
suggested, and having, in reality, no status in the matter. A
counter petition from the Clarence district, signed by the great
majority of the residents there, seems to have been treated as so
much waste paper. Early in 1858, a petition from the people of
Brisbane was prepared for presentation to the Queen, in which
they asked that the final appropriation of the disputed districts
might be deferred until their population reached ten thousand
souls. To this, most of the members for the Moreton Bay
constituencies demurred, as likely to be productive of further
delay. The local committee at first stood firm, and adhered to
their petition; but, in a few weeks, reflection brought about a
more practical view of affairs. On November 3, 1858, a large
meeting was held in Brisbane, at which the local members
attended, and a new memorial to Her Majesty was adopted, in which
the petitioners stated that they did not wish, by pressing the
question of boundary, to occasion further delay. This meeting was
followed by another at Ipswich, on the 17th, at which all the
questions connected with separation were entered into temperately
and deliberately. With reference to the necessity for the
immediate completion of the arrangements promised by the Imperial
Government, a strong representation to the Colonial Office, by
gentlemen in London connected with Moreton Bay, of the evils
resulting from the existing uncertainty was quoted, and its
statements and arguments reiterated. A petition to the Queen,
more elaborate and detailed than that of the Brisbane meeting,
was adopted, the boundary question being dealt with in a similar
manner; and a memorial to the Governor-General, protesting
against the manufactured petitions to which I have referred, and
asking for a reconsideration of the subject, was agreed to. After
these meetings the agitation subsided, and the people settled
down into an attitude of dull expectation.</p>
<p>In May, 1859, this torpor was disturbed by news that the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the then Derby
administration, was about to bring in a Bill for the immediate
separation from New South Wales of all the country east of the
South Australian boundary, north of a line drawn westerly from
Point Danger, granting the people a government analogous to that
of the parent colony, and appointing commissioners to arrange the
settlement of the public debt. That such a notion could have
existed seems, to me, extraordinary, inasmuch as no such bill was
necessary, the Constitution Authorization Act giving full power
to the Queen in Council to adopt such measures as might be
necessary towards the creation of a new colony. There was little
time left for those who really understood the subject to digest
the perplexity which the intelligence was calculated to cause. On
July 10 came the welcome news, and none the less welcome because
unanticipated, that an Order in Council had been issued, by which
the long desired boon was conferred. In the new colony it was
received with wildness of delight: in New South Wales with a
sullen captiousness, which found vent in grumbling over the
possible apportionment of the public debt. Letters patent
creating the colony of Queensland, and appointing Sir George
Ferguson Bowen its first Governor, were approved by an Order in
Council of May 13, 1859, and on June 6 a second order was made,
empowering the Governor to make laws, and provide for the
administration of justice within the territory. The long
struggle, which had been fought with such fluctuating results,
was entirely at an end.</p>
<p>The boundaries adopted satisfied neither the old colony nor
the new one. The Clarence and Richmond and New England districts
were left to their old connection; but the hope that had been
once entertained by New South Wales of compensation for the
withdrawal of Moreton Bay in the formation of new settlements in
the extreme north was extinguished by the extension of the
Queensland boundary to the Gulf of Carpentaria. One result of the
alteration of the line to the south was discovered when it was
too late to remedy its mischievous consequences. The residents on
the border between New England and the Darling Downs districts
not infrequently found their properties divided by the boundary
adopted, and were exposed to all the disadvantages which such a
division entailed. They complained that to have the simplest
petty sessions case tried they had to journey two hundred miles,
being driven by the rugged nature of the country to travel over a
portion of the Queensland territory before getting to an
available route to the nearest court in New South Wales, while a
Queensland one might have been reached by a better road and in a
fourth of the distance. An official representation of these
difficulties was made to the elder government, accompanied by a
proposal for readjustment, but with no result.</p>
<p>As to the debt the Duke of Newcastle&mdash;who in the changes
of home politics had succeeded the late Lord
Lytton&mdash;suggested that its apportionment was a matter
"strictly of a domestic nature," and therefore best dealt with at
least in the first instance by the Legislature of the two
colonies. The appointment of a Commissioner by each with power to
name an umpire, seemed to his Grace a convenient procedure,
looking at the local nature of the subjects to be determined
upon, and the Legislature of New South Wales should, he thought,
take the initiative. Should it decline there would then be a case
for parliamentary interference. In that position the Imperial
authorities left the question, and in that position it has
practically remained ever since.</p>
<p>On the third point, the form of government,&mdash;that in
force in the parent colony at the time&mdash;was, except as to
the suffrage, adopted, with some peculiarities in the details and
initiation. By the Order in Council of June 6, the Governor of
New South Wales was authorised to summon as the nucleus for the
Legislative Council of Queensland such persons, being not less in
number than five, as he should think fit, and these were to hold
their seats for four years only. The Governor of Queensland was
empowered to add to the original number at his discretion, his
nominees having a life tenure. In order to constitute the first
Legislative Assembly the Governor of New South Wales was directed
to fix the number of members, the extent of the several electoral
districts, and the distribution of the representation; and to
take all necessary measures preliminary to, and for, the conduct
of the first elections. While the arrangements requisite for
these purposes were being made a question arose as to the
qualification for the suffrage. By an electoral Act passed in New
South Wales in 1858 that qualification was practically reduced to
one of attainment of the legal majority and a six months'
residence prior to registration. But by the 8th clause of the
Order in Council the qualification of electors in the new colony
was fixed at that defined in the New South Wales Constitution
Act, the minimum of which was a lodgers's tenancy at a ten
pounds' annual rental for six months previous to registration. On
reference to the judges they were unanimously of opinion that the
qualification fixed by the Constitution Act had to be adhered to,
and thus the new colony began with what those who call themselves
advanced politicians would look upon, as regards the electoral
right, as a retrograde step. In his official letter to Sir George
Bowen on the subject Sir William Denison seemed to regret that
such a course had to be adopted; but from subsequent
correspondence I gather that he was in reality firmly opposed to
Universal Suffrage, and deprecated&mdash;especially under our
possible local circumstances&mdash;its introduction into
Queensland.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1839, Sir William Denison issued a
proclamation by which he constituted sixteen electoral districts
in Queensland, and allotted to them twenty-six members. I give
the list, not exactly in the order in which they appear in the
proclamation, but in that of the adult male population of the
electorates, as shown by the first census taken of the colony a
year afterwards. The electorates then stood thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is impossible to acquit Sir William Denison of the charges
of unfairness and inconsistency brought against him when this
distribution of electoral power was published. That it was
purposely designed to give the then pastoral interest an
overwhelming preponderance in the legislature, and thus to
strengthen the hold which their connection with the banks and
agency houses of New South Wales gave that colony upon
Queensland, was freely asserted, and there were few who doubted
the fact. Brisbane and its suburb Fortitude Valley were the only
constituencies that could be said to be at all independent of
that interest&mdash;with perhaps a portion of East Moreton; and
one can hardly help challenging the equity which allotted to the
Western Downs with its small population two members, while the
Burnett with four times the number of residents had only equal
representation. The Governor-General's conduct was the more
inconsistent in that, but a few months before, he had deprecated
separation, because he considered the interest he now favoured to
have no fixed or abiding hold in the country;&mdash;but he had
been sharply criticized by the townspeople for the unfair
statement, which had brought upon him the tacit rebuke of the
Colonial Office, under which he still smarted, and forgiveness
was not a prominent virtue of Sir William Denison's.</p>
<p>Although in point of date after the assumption of the
governorship of Queensland by Sir George Bowen, I record as a
part of the initiatory procedure, directed under the Orders in
Council, the appointment to our Legislative Council, by Sir
William Denison, in May 1860, of Sir Charles Nicholson, the late
Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell, and Messrs. John Balfour, Francis
Edward Bigge, Alfred Edward Compaigne, George Fullarton, John
James Galloway, James Laidley, John Frederic Macdougall, Robert
George Massie, and William Henry Yaldwyn. And thus ended the
official connection of the Governor and Government of New South
Wales with the districts comprised in the colony of
Queensland.</p>
<p>The people of that colony were quite willing to forget their
lately dependent state in the exhilaration which accompanied the
preparations for initiating their new condition with due
ceremony, and for the reception of their Governor, who was
expected to arrive towards the close of 1859. A house belonging
to Dr. Hobbs (and now that gentleman's residence), at that time
the best in the town, was taken for Sir George Bowen's occupation
until a suitable residence could be built, and was properly
furnished. Reception committees were formed, addresses prepared,
entertainments arranged, and all seemed anxious to show his
Excellency how highly they appreciated his presence, and more
highly its cause. And leaving them thus occupied I close the
general narrative of this volume.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> date at which the district was
elevated into a colony affords a termination and a starting
point, and we have therefore arrived at a suitable stage of this
history for recapitulation and review. Necessarily some matters
have been omitted&mdash;some could not conveniently be introduced
in the general course of the narrative&mdash;which is, therefore,
so far, incomplete. I propose, therefore, in this chapter, to
summarize the progress of the district up to December, 1859, and
to exhibit as clearly as I can its actual condition at that time,
Such a review affords an opportunity for a divisional
arrangement, which, while admitting of continuity in each
section, will not interfere with an accurate appreciation of
general results, and the student who has his special subject of
inquiry will find this information available, grouped under its
special section. Some repetition it will be impossible to avoid,
but I venture to think that the shape in which it occurs, will
not be found tedious, while the concentration of facts will
facilitate reference.</p>
<p>The New South Wales census of 1846 gave the total population
of the districts, which were to form the foundation of our
colony, as 2.257; in 1857 another census stated the area of the
territory available for occupation as 58,860 square miles, and
the population as 8,575. On March 1, 1856, the area proclaimed
was 174,600 square miles, and the population 17,082, the occupied
country having increased threefold and the numbers of the people
having doubled. On December 31, 1859, the population was
estimated with a near approach to accuracy at 25,020, showing a
considerable falling off in the proportionate rate of increase.
The area of the Queensland territory was stated in the Queensland
Statistical Register, issued by Sir George Bowen, at 1,209,800
square miles; but that calculation being made upon the assumption
that the western boundary of this colony would be the eastern one
of Western Australia, and include the large area since allotted
to South Australia, was an erroneous one. Practically the country
occupied was about the same in extent as at the census of
1850.</p>
<p>Of the wealth of the colony at the period of its creation it
is only possible to speak approximately, as for an accurate
estimate the statistics I have referred to are valueless; for
instance, they take no account of the pastoral riches scattered
over the land. Taking the rate of increase maintained for some
years, and the number of horses, sheep, and cattle, as
ascertained in 1860, as bases, I calculate that at the close of
1859 there must have been about 20,000 horses, 300,000 cattle,
and 2,000,000 sheep in Queensland. The live stock on January 1,
1848, was, as we have seen estimated at 698,938 sheep, 48,207
cattle, and 2,189 horses. The money value of the stock in 1859,
not taking the exceptional rates of 1860, might be set down at
two millions and the values of the properties comprised within
the two municipalities of Brisbane and Ipswich, at the then
current rates, I could not estimate as more than £900,000, and in
the gradually-growing townships in the interior and on the
coast&mdash;in all seven&mdash;at £350,000 more. The small
quantity of land actually in cultivation, the insignificant
mining works, and the moveable property employed in industrial
processes would be liberally valued at another £100,000. As to
the alienated land, of which no use was made, and the theoretical
worth of runs, it is impossible to arrive at a valuation which
would not appear absurdly high to some, and as ridiculously low
to others. At the close of 1859 the real prices were very much
under what was asked and obtained in the latter end of 1860,
which, in their turn, greatly increased in 1861. if I were to
take the whole at half a million, it would be what, at the time I
am writing of, would have been found&mdash;a fair appraisement.
In all, the actual wealth of the community then presently
available was about four millions and a quarter sterling. For a
population of 20,000 souls this could not be pronounced other
than a fair condition for a starting point.</p>
<p>Agriculture was at an exceedingly low ebb. I do not think that
more than 2,000 acres out of 80,000 alienated from the Crown were
under cultivation.* Maize was the principal crop. Potatoes, and
oats for hay were next, but at a long interval; and about a fifth
of the whole area might be set down at what in England would be
called orchards, in which banana: occupied no small portion.
There was a notion much encouraged in those days by leading
squatters, whose interest might be supposed to have been promoted
by the depreciation of agricultural settlement, that cultivation
in Queensland must necessarily result in failure&mdash;especially
as to cereal: and fruit and vegetables of European
origin&mdash;and from constant reiteration it received
considerable acceptance. In the two hotels, which accommodated
the more exclusive visitors to Brisbane in 1859-60, a
considerable portion of the vegetables used were imported from
Sydney&mdash;certainly from an indolent acquiescence and not from
necessity. As to cereals even in 1860 there were only eighteen
acres of wheat in the Brisbane district, and not a single acre
anywhere else. Agriculture, if not altogether despised, was
generally looked upon as, in the main, experimental, and the
agriculturalist as an enthusiast or a weak-minded mistaken man
"Farming will never pay" was the authoritative enunciation of the
wise and prudent, and the babes received it with the submission
that became them. I was visiting at a station on the Darling
Downs in 1860, and was much surprised and disappointed when
chatting in the evening with my hospitable host at being told
that the fine country over which I had been riding was utterly
unsuitable for anything but grazing. "It will not grow a
cabbage." Taking an early stroll the following morning I found a
well-kept garden, in which some fine cabbages were not the least
conspicuous objects, but on mentioning this at breakfast I was
assured that the growth was exceptional and expensive, and if
cabbage-growing could be done again, which was doubtful, it would
not be worth the doing. And this was the general burden of the
song. It is but two days since that we bought in Brisbane as fine
cabbages as cook would desire to see at little more than a
halfpenny each. Some of us had faith in vegetables in 1860; now
we know them experimentally, which some colonial Tyndall might
claim as a triumph of proof over belief; but then no shower o
Chinese gardeners had fallen upon the land.</p>
<p class="foot">[* On April 1, 1861, when a great start had been
made, there were only 3,351 acres.]</p>
<p>The growth of the trade of the district is less easily traced
than that of its population. The colonial Registrar-General in
1860 regretted that he had "access to no reliable records of our
commerce in former years," but as we have seen the <i>Courier</i>
gave occasional statements, and as these were never effectively
challenged, we are justified in accepting them as bases for our
estimates. The exports then may be calculated for the respective
years named in the following table at the values set against
them&mdash;excluding those from the Clarence and Richmond, which
up to the issue of the Orders in Council constituting the new
colony were included in what were called the northern
districts&mdash;</p>

<p class="foot">[* Probably from local causes, such as
impediments to traffic, including a large quantity of the
preceding year's produce.]</p>
<p>and the Statistical Register for the last month of 1839, which
was the first of Sir George Bowen's governorship, gives the value
of the exports for that month at £50,738, of which 1,254 bales of
wool contributed £48,410; coal, to the East Indies, £330, and
timber £430. Taking the ratio of export value to population it
would seem to have been about £20 per head per annum. As to the
imports I know of no means of obtaining any information.</p>
<p>In so small a community one would hardly expect to find
banking transactions on any but the smallest scale. Four English
and New South Wales establishments had branches in the
district&mdash;the Bank of Australasia, the Union Bank of
Australia, the Australian Joint Stock Bank, and the Bank of New
South Wales. The average note circulation of the whole may be
taken at about £30,000; the deposits, £180,000; the liabilities,
£357,000; the notes and bills and debts due, £390,000. The coin
was about £50,000, and the bullion, apparently, <i>nil</i>. The
Bank of Australasia had the largest share of the business, the
Australian Joint Stock Bank, the Bank of New South Wales, and the
Union Bank of Australia following in due order. There were
offices in Brisbane and Ipswich, those in the latter
town&mdash;in which at that time most business was
transacted&mdash;being finer buildings than in the capital, on
which the Ipswichians congratulated themselves and looked
scornfully on the Brisbane claims. There are no returns which
show the operation of the Act authorizing liens on stock or on
wool, those effected in the district being registered in Sydney
up to the date of separation from New South Wales, as far as I
can learn.</p>
<p>There was not much room for the energies of the Protectionist
in Queensland in December 1859. There were at that time four
steam sawmills, one soap manufactory (recorded as having made 5
tons of soap in the year 1); one candle factory, which turned out
fifty thousand pounds weight of candles; a struggling salt works;
two coal mines, the output being about 5,000 tons, valued at
£3,500; and a dugong fishery whose returns are not extant.
Population was wanted to develop the resources of the country,
and concerning the most effective methods of establishing a
speedy and useful immigration there was much discussion, and some
curious theories were propounded.</p>
<p>The system of civil government in the district at this time
was simple enough. The constitution had not, of course, come into
direct operation, and the departments were merely branches of the
central government of New South Wales. Captain Wickham ruled over
Brisbane and its connected districts; Captain O'Connell presided
at Gladstone over whatever was supposed to require supervision in
the district of Port Curtis. The number of employes did not then
form a subject of uneasiness to liberal politicians jealous for
the liberty of the subject. At the head office there was the
superintendent and one clerk. The Crown lands found work for five
commissioners and eight land agents; the survey office for seven
surveyors and one clerk and draughtsman. The Customs employed one
sub-collector and four subordinates, and there was a board of
works of two. The steam navigation board numbered six officials
and the immigration board three. The Botanic gardens were
entrusted to a committee of three and a superintendent. There was
one coroner to enquire into suspicious deaths, and two police
magistrates and twelve clerks of petty sessions to look after the
suspected amongst the living; while for every description of
ultimate jurisdiction there was a judge of the Supreme Court and
twelve officials of various kinds. The post office did not too
severely tax the energies of four departmental officers, twelve
local postmasters, and two letter-carriers. The native police
corps seems to have been a favourite one with the Government of
New South Wales. It had a commandant and a secretary, and its
five divisions were thus officered:&mdash;Port Curtis and
Leichhardt, a first lieutenant and six second lieutenants; Wide
Bay and Burnett, a first and second lieutenant; Maranoa and
Condamine, a first and two second lieutenants; and the Moreton
Buy district one second lieutenant. Of the ordinary police I find
eleven chief constables set down for various places, and I
believe the ordinary corps could not have mustered more than
thirty. The gaol required the services of five superior
officials, two chaplains, and seven turnkeys. Two sheep
inspectors were supposed to guard against disease and infection
in stock. Port Curtis had, besides Captain O'Connell, nine
officials, one being a police magistrate. The whole of the
official staff was not much beyond a hundred. If my readers fear
for the protection of the country with so small an administrative
corps they may perhaps take heart at the cloud of magistrates
which hovered over the land, for there were even then one hundred
and fifty-three gentlemen on the commission of the peace.</p>
<p>It will be observed that this very moderate administrative
strength left a fine field for official organisation by the new
Government. How this was taken advantage of will be seen
hereafter. But the enthusiasts for further separation may derive
a warning and a lesson from a comparison between the executive
strength of December, 1859, and that of December, 1860. To be
sure, there was not much activity to call forth the energies of
the public service. The expenditure on public works of all kinds
could not have been more than £10,000 in the eleven months before
separation, most of which seems to have been devoted to the gaol.
The collection of the then taxes must have been easy. Spirits,
wines, ale, porter, tea, sugar, treacle, molasses, coffee,
chicory, cigars, tobacco, and snuff comprising all the dutiable
articles. The other sources of revenue were of a kind that were
brought, rather than collected. Altogether, there must have been
a good deal of placid resignation, accompanied by an occasional
folding of the hands and leisure for quiet introspection&mdash;if
that were enjoyable&mdash;amongst the civil service of those
days; and if its salaries had not attained the high level in
which some of its members rejoice now, the duties were
light&mdash;the responsibilities, for the most part, nominal, and
the plague of ministerial supervision and patronage was as yet
unknown.</p>
<p>The social condition of the people was, in great measure, what
one might suppose it would be, that of a quiet colonial country
locality almost unexpectedly roused to a mild excitement by the
prospect of capital, population, and enterprise, long worked for
and wished for in vain. The course of life was monotonous, unless
a flood, or a drought, or an election disturbed it. Public
amusements, there were none, save such as might be derived from
the infrequent visits of a stroller or two&mdash;more seldom, of
a musical star. A School of Arts, with a small, but good,
library, was kept up in Brisbane with some success, and now and
then a lecturer drew a few people together, as much from
curiosity as from taste. There was another institution of the
kind lodged in a temporary building at Ipswich, and a feeble
reflection at Toowoomba; and, moreover, there was a volunteer
mounted corps, whose evolutions certainly had the merit of
keeping the spectators in good humour. As in most such
communities, there was a sort of sectional division; in this case
having the superior portion of the official element&mdash;the
leading squatters, the older professional men, the bank managers,
some of the clergy, and one or two wholesale dealers on the
higher level. The middle stratum had its notabilities, and
amongst these arose most of the disputes which occasionally, to
use a now proverbial phrase, made things lively, when not varied
by the eccentricities of lesser legal and clerical lights. The
general mass were, for the most part, quiet in habit, moderate in
expense, and, earning good wages, while the cost of living was
low, had less ground for real, than imaginary, discontent.
Leaving on one side those who found enjoyment in low
pleasures&mdash;and they were inconsiderable in
number&mdash;there must have been a good deal of self-contained
life in those days. In truth, there could have been little room
for anything else. Travelling was slow, sometimes difficult,
mostly expensive, and in wet weather well nigh impracticable. I
question whether, outside of Brisbane, there was a mile of road
in the colony&mdash;few of the creeks were bridged, and, in more
than one case, the bridge, however good in itself, was
unapproachable, unless by a long detour from the main track. Even
in Brisbane the streets, so called, were, in great part, passages
between allotments where, sometime or other, buildings were
thought likely to be erected; and their surfaces were as soft as
their verdure was fresh. They did not need watering, for there
was no dust&mdash;the luxuries of which primitive condition, I
suppose, stimulated a candidate for aldermanic honours, some
months afterwards, when increasing traffic had made the roads
more friable, to recommend that they should be laid with turf to
prevent the spread of the nascent nuisance&mdash;and the new
municipality had not commenced the work of road formation. As
were the ways of the metropolis, so were those of the interior
townships, with a plentiful admixture of stumps. Intercourse
between the interior and the coast towns was, in great part,
dependent upon the weather, because of the difficulties
presented, not only by the usual tracks and by swollen creeks,
but by the passage of the Great Dividing Range and its spurs; at
whose base or summit, teams have been kept for months unable to
start upon the ascent or descent. There was, in fact, every
motive existent for the colonist to seek his amusement at home,
not the least being, sometimes, the impossibility of getting far
away from it; and, sometimes, the improbability of finding any
improvement in his lot by going farther. The arrival or departure
of the steamer from or to Sydney&mdash;especially the
arrival&mdash;was a periodical source of amusement in Brisbane,
at least to the people, but the passengers occasionally viewed
the matter in a different light. A trip, now and then, on the
river afforded a little variety; omnibuses and cabs being then
unknown. One source of amusement, however, existed in the
newspapers, whose weekly or tri-weekly issues were eagerly looked
for. There was only one in Brisbane&mdash;the old
<i>Courier</i>&mdash;whose politics at the time were professedly
liberal, which meant anti-squatting, in the district, and of the
Manchester school in other respects. It neither meddled, nor
assumed to meddle, with literature, properly so called, and as to
ecclesiastical matters, seemed to have inherited the feelings
prevalent when&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Oyster women locked their fish up,<br>
And trudged away to cry no bishop.</p>
<p>The <i>North Australian</i> at Ipswich, fierce in defence of
its own town, and defiant of opposition, was, nevertheless,
menaced by the rivalry of the <i>Herald</i>, in the formation of
which Mr. Macalister and some pastoral friends took a leading
part; and at Drayton the <i>Darling Downs Gazette</i> sneered at
the shopkeepers below the range, and advocated the claims of the
squatters. The principal peculiarity attached to this last
journal at the time was the curious nature of its
accommodation&mdash;a wooden shanty elevated on some piles, apart
from the few houses of the place, and where the music of the
waving trees and the trickling waters of a creek: below were
favourable to meditation, if not to comfort.</p>
<p>Of art there was nothing to notice; no one looked for it, and
no one was disappointed. There had been neither call nor room for
its development. One exception might have been found in the
little Roman Catholic Chapel at Brisbane, which possessed some
real character in the later pointed style. Nevertheless, it was
currently believed that there were "fine buildings," and a
traveller desirous of peace would not have ventured to disturb
the belief. No auctioneer offered pictures which, supposing them
to have been genuine, would have been priceless, and "chromos"
and oleographs, and the photograph in its more modern aspect,
were all unknown. The <i>Illustrated News</i> supplied, at once,
art and criticism for the people.</p>
<p>The community was not a litigious one. I remember only six or
seven solicitors in the Moreton Bay district, and, generally,
legal proceedings were carried on with a great deal of good
humour on all sides, except when the payment of costs ruffled the
surfaces and, still more, the depths below. There was not more
than the average of criminality, when we consider the special
class from which it principally arose. 217 were
committed&mdash;mostly for minor offences&mdash;during the year
1859; of whom, 7 were minors, 117 could not read, 6 had been
convicted once before 16 twice, and 39 three times or more. At
Michaelmas, 1859, there were only 32 in confinement, all of whom
had been tried&mdash;11 for felonies. As to the physical health
of the people, I have scarcely any available record to turn to.
There were only two hospitals in the colony&mdash;one in
Brisbane, and one in Maryborough&mdash;both sustained by
Government grants, by voluntary subscriptions, and by a portion
of the fines received at some police courts. At the Brisbane
institution, 176 patients were admitted during the year, 24
seeming the average number of inmates; while at Maryborough, 14
and 4 were the numbers respectively. I think there were only
three or four medical men in Brisbane, including the hospital
surgeon; two in Ipswich, two or three on the Darling Downs, and
one in Maryborough. Accident, more than disease, was the source
of practice, and there were no earth-closets and no boards of
health to squabble over their unsavory merits or defects.</p>
<p>The educational system, inherited by the colony from New South
Wales, was, to a small extent, on what was called the National
system, under a Board incorporated by the Act, 11 Vic., No. 48,
the preamble whereof recited the desirability of "establishing
schools to be conducted under Lord Stanley's system of National
education." The regulations issued by the Board were not very
voluminous; the books directed to be used seem to have been
similar to those of the Irish National Schools, including four
sets of Scripture lessons, and lessons on the truths of
Christianity; and for reading these, or for direct religious
instruction by ministers of religion, one hour each day was
directed to be set apart. I find no reference to matters special
to Australia, to whose geographical and physical characteristics
it appears to hive been thought unnecessary to refer. The
expenses of the National schools were defrayed partly by the
State, and partly by school fees and subscriptions, the striking
peculiarity in this part of the arrangement being the miserable
stipends paid to the teachers. Working contemporaneously with
this system, was a denominational one, in which the teachers'
salaries were supplemented by the State, but the teacher seems to
have been more at the discretion of the authorities of the
denomination under whose supervision the school immediately was,
provided a certain degree of efficiency were kept up. The
National system had not attained any great degree of public
favour, for I gather from the statistics for 1859, that there
were in the new colony at the time of its creation, six schools
connected with the Church of England, attended by 337 scholars;
four in connection with the Church of Rome, whose scholars were
354; one National school at the little village&mdash;if village
it could be called&mdash;of Drayton, with 78 scholars; and thirty
private schools, which obtained between them 698 pupils. In all,
1,517 children were taught in the different schools, and of that
number all but 180 belonged to the towns. The ratio of attendance
I am, from the absence of statistics, unable to give. The general
prevalence of the denominational system spoke well for the
exertions of those in the churches with whom the primary steps
for the establishment of schools rested&mdash;they began well;
the future, at least with respect to the Church of England, had
to tell a very different tale.</p>
<p>I now come to a division of my subject, into which I have gone
more particularly than may appear necessary to some of my
readers; but I found in the course of my enquiries for the
requisite facts that they were to be collected from such a
variety of sources, were so scattered, and, in consequence, so
little known, and, when known, lightly appreciated, that it was
indispensable, if anything approaching to an intelligent and
useful account was to be arrived at, to deal with the subject
with more than usual care, and in more than usual detail. I have
never met with a connected history of religious progress in
Queensland, or any effort at tracing its rise, and to this the
difficulty of getting at the facts, as well as of discriminating
between different versions of the same fact, may in no small
degree have tended. I venture to think that the neglect which has
been betrayed by some, to whom the subject might be supposed to
legitimately belong, and the virulent partizanship of others,
have contributed largely to the mingled ignorance and
indifference with which these important matters are often treated
in this colony. I have, therefore, endeavoured to arrive at a
clear apprehension of the religious condition of the community in
1859, and of the origin and progress of its different churches
and denominations amongst us; so that, at least, some of the
reproach which attaches to an indolent non-appreciation should be
wiped away.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly that condition was one, as exhibited in the
contemporaneous statistics, to excite considerable surprise. Out
of a population of 25,020, the number of attendants on divine
service was set down at 3,523,* and this was divided
into&mdash;Wesleyans, 875; Church of Rome, 745; Church of
England, 643; Presbyterians, 460; Baptists, 325;
Congregationalists, 250; and Lutherans, 230. Eighteen churches
and chapels are enumerated, most of them recently built
structures of wood, of an exceedingly primitive and unsubstantial
kind, and where these were not forthcoming court-houses and
school-rooms, not more solid or attractive, were used instead. In
the whole district there were sixteen clergymen of various
denominations. The figures I quote from show only the condition
of the townships; of services in the bush, on the stations, and
at mere outside places I have found no reliable record, and
indeed they must have been from the small number of ministers,
irregular and infrequent.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Queensland Statistics, December, 1859.]</p>
<p>The population returns are in direct contrariety to those of
religious attendance. At least, one-third of the whole number
were nominally members of the Church of England, a fourth Roman
Catholics, about 13 per cent. Presbyterians, the Wesleyans coming
next. Yet the Wesleyans ranked the highest in the scale of
religious activity&mdash;not a very creditable fact to the
principal churches, even giving due weight to the concentration
of congregations in townships, whence it arose that 630 of the
Wesleyan worshippers were set down for Brisbane alone.</p>
<p>State endowments for religious purposes were recognized by the
Legislation of New South Wales at the time in force in Moreton
Bay, and applied according to a system embodied in a series of
acts known as Sir Richard Bourke's Acts, passed in 1836-7. Sir
Richard, who assumed the Governorship of the colony in 1831, was
not long in finding that the jealousies of different churches and
denominations, as well as the injustice which had from time to
time followed upon the whims and caprices of some of his
predecessors, were likely to be productive of serious evils, and
that the exclusive connection of the State with any particular
church was, in the local circumstances of the day, altogether out
of the question. A man of distinguished intellectual powers,
great administrative ability, and unswerving integrity and
independence, he was the ablest statesman the colonies have yet
seen as a Governor.** After two years' deliberation he laid
before the Imperial Government a scheme for the settlement of the
question, which in due time met with approval, and was soon after
brought into operation by the General Churches Act (7 Wm. 4, No.
2, N.S.W.), passed in 1836. By this Act aid was authorized to be
granted to churches and religious bodies who might desire it in
the following way:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir Richard was by descent in a collateral
line connected with the celebrated Edmund Burke, and was marked
by much similarity of character to that of that illustrious man,
four volumes of whose correspondence with the leading statesmen
of his day Sir Richard edited in conjunction with, I think, the
late Earl Fitzwilliam.]</p>
<p>Towards the erection of churches, chapels, or Ministers'
dwellings, in sums equal to private contributions up to £1000 in
each case.</p>
<p>Towards the stipend of a minister of religion&mdash;vested
interests in stipends being had regard to&mdash;if there were a
resident population of 100 adults subscribing a declaration of a
desire to attend his church, £100 per annum; if there were 200
such adults, £200; if 500 such adults, £300. When no church or
chapel existed it was to be discretional in the Government to pay
any sum not exceeding £100 in aid of private contributions,
which, however, were not to be less than £50.</p>
<p>Trustees were to be appointed to hold the real estate and to
receive and account for moneys issued under the Act.</p>
<p>Free sittings for the poor to the extent of one-fourth of the
whole were to be reserved in every church or chapel.</p>
<p>Subsequently the requirements of different churches led to
supplementary legislation to meet them in accordance with the
specialities of their organization; but before describing how
this was effected it is necessary to enter more fully into the
early history of each of the various churches and denominations,
which, so far as I am enabled, I proceed to do in the order of
their seniority or proportion to population.</p>
<p>The Church of England was planted in Australia in an
uncongenial soil and in troublous times. In the year 1793, eight
years after the establishment of the convict settlement under
Captain Phillip in Port Jackson, some people in England, amongst
whom was the celebrated William Wilberforce, bethought themselves
that when no provision had been made for religious ordinances or
instruction in a professedly reformatory system something had
been forgotten; and, as in a community of criminals and gaolers,
the voluntary principle was not likely to meet with much support,
the Government of the day were urged to make some effort towards
supplying the deficiency. But that Government, occupied by the
troubles and cost of the first French revolutionary war, and it
is to be supposed not unaffected by the general religious
indifference of the times, could only offer to provide for two
chaplains on an economical or rather parsimonious scale. Thus
much achieved, a new difficulty arose. At first no one at all
suitable for such an appointment could be induced to accept it,
and after one was found his coadjutor was not forthcoming. At
this time, however, there was at St. John's College, Cambridge, a
young student waiting for holy orders named Samuel Marsden, in
all time to come to be inseparably identified with the
commencement of Maori civilization in New Zealand. Marsden was
the son of a Yorkshire farmer of small means, by whom he had been
sent to the free Grammar School at Hull. On leaving this he was
started in life as a tradesman in Leeds, but his vivacity and
clearness of intellect had gained for him the notice of a society
called the Elland Society, formed to aid in the education for the
ministry of young men of limited means, but of exceptionally good
character and ability, and of which Wilberforce, Simeon, and
Thornton were prominent members. By this Society he was sent to
St. John's, where he was waiting for his degree, when, at the
suggestion of Mr. Wilberforce, one of the proposed chaplaincies
was offered to him. He at first shrank from it, but no one being
found to take the place, he undertook its duties, and in the
spring of 1793 was ordained. Shortly afterwards, being then
twenty-nine years of age, he married and started for his
destination. He soon had a foretaste of what he was to encounter
in the opposition made to the performance of his ministerial
duties, by the master of the convict ship in which he took his
voyage, and when he had some experience in the new settlement,
then governed by Captain Hunter, he discovered that that
foretaste was but a mild indication of what he had to undergo.
His fellow-chaplain, after having had his house burned down in
return for his services, abandoned the task in despair. Hunter
himself found the state of things so unendurable that he returned
to England in&mdash;the year 1800 to attempt the attainment of
some reform, but he did not come back to the colony, nor do I
think that he met with much sympathy at home. His successor,
Captain King, encountered like evils and difficulties, and on his
return to England in, I believe, 1806, Marsden, who foresaw the
results of the condition which culminated afterwards in the
revolt against, and deposition of, Governor Bligh by his own
officers, accompanied him in the hope of obtaining some
amelioration and improvement. The utmost he could then secure was
that the convicts should be taught trades, and that three
chaplains and two schoolmasters should be sent back with him. Any
other suggestions, especially in a moral or educational
direction, were rejected as enthusiastic or visionary by the
practical men of the day. Yet, at that time there were probably
10,000 inhabitants, mostly convicts, or, too frequently when not
so, very little better, in New South Wales.</p>
<p>In another direction he was successful beyond his hopes, and,
as I have said in an early chapter of this history, is entitled
to share with Macarthur the honour generally claimed solely for
him of laying the foundation of the growth of the great staple
export of the Australian colonies&mdash;wool. What he valued more
was that the profit from his farseeing enterprise helped, in no
small degree, to supply means for carrying into effect his
schemes for the improvement of the prisoners, and the promotion
of his missionary enterprises in New Zealand, which he at this
time originated. Into the history of his efforts in that
direction, his various trials and considerable success, the
nature of this work precludes me from entering. In the opinion of
those capable of judging, he is declared to have been a worthy
predecessor of the great and good Selwyn. What is there to be
added of eulogy to such praise?</p>
<p>It was not long after his return to New South Wales that he
found himself in collision with Governor Macquarie, who, for
twelve years, ruled the colony with vigour, not infrequently
diverging into despotism. He would have been ecclesiastical
director, as well as civil superior, and often endeavoured to
interfere in religious matters over which he had no rightful
control. These attempts were steadfastly resisted by Marsden,
who, at the same time, saw much to be dissatisfied with in the
way in which Macquarie too frequently postponed moral reform to
mere material prosperity in his estimate of the character of his
hybrid population. And Macquarie was not one to tolerate
opposition. A system of detraction and abuse on his part, and, at
last, of direct accusation by himself, resulted in the issue of
two commissioners from England, from whose enquiries Marsden came
out, not only with acquittal, but with approval and reward. He
did not escape disagreement with Governor Brisbane, but after
that governor's recall lived in peace and honour, and to the end
in useful activity until May 23, 1838, when, after nearly half a
century of ministerial and missionary labour, he died at Windsor,
in New South Wales. Forty years afterwards I heard him spoken of
with affectionate respect by some whose age was such that, in
their early days, they had participated in a kindness which they
still appreciated, while they remembered a goodness which they
had not forgotten to reverence.</p>
<p>But, before his death, Marsden had one great wish gratified,
and it befel thus: In the year 1813, the exertions of Wilberforce
and his friends had enlisted the public interest in the condition
of the East Indian possessions of Great Britain, and the
responsibility of the Church of England with regard to them. In
1814 the first Bishop of Calcutta&mdash;Thomas Fanshaw Middleton,
beforetime Archdeacon of Huntington&mdash;was appointed, not
without many misgivings, on the part of that excellent man, as to
his ability to discharge the duties of so novel and so arduous a
position. He was to be assisted by three archdeacons, one in each
of the cities of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. In 1821, as I
collect, he received a petition from Marsden, bringing before him
the requirements of New South Wales; and arrangements were made
for the establishment of an archdiaconate of Australia in
subordination to the See of Calcutta. The Bishop dying in 1822,
there arose some delay in making the necessary appointment, and
it was not until 1825 that the Reverend Thomas Hobbes Scott
received it; but of the character or results of his
administration, I have no record. He was succeeded in 1829 or
1830, by Archdeacon, afterwards Bishop, Broughton, a man of sound
judgment, an ardent churchman, but with greater liberality of
feeling than he has been generally credited, and, withal, of
quiet sustained energy and determination of
purpose&mdash;qualities all called into action by the
transitional circumstances of the times, and by the discontent
felt at the special advantages then accorded to the Church of
England. He was fortunate in that the inevitable changes were, so
to speak, in the hands of Sir R. Bourke. Partly in connection
with these matters, and, partly, in consequence of the
inconvenience and increasing inadequacy of the then episcopal
arrangements, Archdeacon Broughton found it necessary to visit
England in 1835, when it was determined to create an Australian
See, of which he was consecrated the first bishop, in February,
1836. Some of Marsden's friends complained that he was passed by,
but the good old man, then more than seventy years of age,
participated in no such vain regrets. He knew that the fullest
possible vigour, both of mind and body, is required in our
colonial episcopate, especially in the formation and settlement
of new dioceses, and that an infirm frame and enfeebled intellect
are poor endowments for the performance of the duties which that
work entails.</p>
<p>The reader will have observed that, subsequently to the
passing of the General Churches Act, supplementary legislation
was found necessary to meet the special requirements of the
several ecclesiastical bodies interested in it. That legislation
was in 1859, and, in part, is at present in force in the colony;
and it may be as well at this stage to recapitulate, as briefly
as possible, its principal provisions as respects the Anglican
Church in Queensland.</p>
<p>The Acts in which they are embodied are technically known as
the 8 Wm. IV., No. 5, N.S.W., 1837, and the 21 Vic., No. 4,
N.S.W., 1857. The first Act empowers any person or persons
providing at his or their own expense a church or chapel approved
by the bishop of the diocese, or any minister's dwelling, glebe
land, or burial ground, to nominate five persons as trustees
thereof; or any number of persons subscribing not less than three
hundred pounds towards such purposes to elect like trustees by
the voting qualification&mdash;until, in the case of a church or
chapel, the completion of the building&mdash;being a subscription
of not less than £1, and the perpetual one for the trusteeship
membership of the church&mdash;the member frequenting its public
services and not being known publicly to impugn any of its
doctrines." A trustee absent from the colony for six months
continuously, or becoming insolvent, or "disqualified as
hereinbefore mentioned"&mdash;I presume by cessation of
membership or by impugning the doctrines of the church&mdash;was
to be removed by the remaining trustees, and the vacancy was then
to be filled up in like manner as in the first nomination or
election&mdash;supposing the church or chapel to be still
incomplete. If it were finished the elective right was vested in
the pew-holders, renters, and annual contributors, being members
of the church one-sixth of the sittings in any church or chapel
being reserved as free, The pew-holders and renters were to have
as many votes, not exceeding six, as they held or rented seats,
the contributors one vote for every pound sterling subscribed.
The same constituency was to elect the churchwardens at the
annual Easter meeting. Power was reserved to the "Bishop of
Australia" to be the sole trustee of any church property and in
the event of non-election, to nominate churchwardens; and
direction were laid clown for the regulation of elections, for
the keeping and auditing of trustees and churchwardens' accounts;
for provision for the maintenance of buildings, and "for the due
and orderly celebration of public worship and the administration
of the sacraments" in accordance with the ceremonial and
discipline agreed to in the Synod of London of 1603, as well as
for sundry minor matters with which it is unnecessary to trouble
the reader. When any glebe became likely to yield more than £150
per annum the trustees were empowered to lease it for any term
not exceeding twenty-eight years, and to apply the
proceeds&mdash;after securing the incumbent £150 per
annum&mdash;for purposes of church extension generally. By the
subsequent Act of 1857 the maximum term was very injudiciously
lengthened to ninety years&mdash;a most absurd provision in a
colony in which not infrequently a quarter of the period
quadruples the value of property, and one which has been almost
fraudulently taken advantage of to the damage of the Church but
to great private emolument in New South Wales. The same Act
forbade the mortgaging or encumbering the property of the Church,
and the trustees were directed to furnish annual accounts of
receipt and expenditure to the bishop of the diocese.</p>
<p>The value of legislation must be collected from its results,
and to those which followed that which I have described I shall
have hereafter to refer. But, despite the impediments thrown in
his way by the Act of 1837, Bishop Broughton worked with energy,
and, indeed, with no small measure of success, insomuch that in a
few years' time he found himself in a position to recommend a
re-arrangement of his diocese, by which two new bishoprics would
be created; and he offered, in order to facilitate this being
done, to give up a fourth of his own salary towards their
support. Accordingly, in June 1847, his desire was fulfilled in
the consecration of Dr. Perry as Bishop of Melbourne, and of Dr.
Tyrell as Bishop of Newcastle&mdash;the latter including, with
other of the northern portions of New South Wales, the district
of Moreton Bay. In fifteen years the Anglican Church increased
under Bishop Broughton's administration from an archdeacon with
fifteen chaplains and three catechists to three bishops with an
archdeacon and sixty clergymen, and it was not always good ground
on which the sower went forth to sow.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay as an entirely outside district was for some years
left very much to itself, but when Captain Wickham came, in 1842,
to take the civil government, Bishop Broughton sent the Rev. John
Gregor with him, who found a scattered and not very sympathizing
flock. He was bred originally in the Presbyterian Church, his
secession from which exposed him to much unmerited vituperation
from Dr. Lang, who accused him of being actuated by mercenary
motives. If the work he came to satisfied him the work he left,
must have been the very wretchedness of penury. He at first held
occasional services in the room formerly used as a chapel in the
old convict barracks, and subsequently in an abandoned prisoners'
workshop, which the Bishop leased at a shilling per annum for the
purpose. There being no residence, he took lodgings in the
Moravian Missionary Station, not far from Brisbane, and thence
started on many a weary journey, in the performance of his
duties, in the bush and at the squatting stations formed at the
time. His was a position of toil and privation, not unmixed with
personal danger, obscure and poorly paid, and productive less of
thanks than of disappointment and mortification.</p>
<p>After four years of continuous and harassing work, Mr. Gregor
was accidently drowned while bathing in a waterhole at the
Moravian Station, and news of the sad occurrence met Dr. Tyrrell
on his arrival at Sydney, on his way to take charge of his
diocese&mdash;a diocese which, thenceforward, he may be said
never to have left, and which will ever remain indebted to his
powerful intellect, unwearied energy, and noble
disinterestedness, during an episcopate of thirty-two years. He
at once sent the Rev. B. Glennie&mdash;now Archdeacon
Glennie&mdash;to take Mr. Gregor's place. During his residence in
Brisbane, and in 1849, the Rev. I. Bodenham, then living
temporarily at what is now the suburb of Kangaroo Point,
collected money for the erection of the old wooden church in that
locality, and it was opened about September in the same year.
From the ill-kept records of St. John's (the mother church of the
diocese), and from such other information as I have been able to
collect, Mr. Glennie must have left for the Darling Downs
sometime in (?) July, 1850, the Rev. John Wallace taking his
place for Brisbane and Ipswich. This gentleman is recorded to
have presided at a meeting of the church in August of that year;
after which time, I find no entry until November 8, 1851; but,
from other sources, I gather that the Rev. H. O. Irwin took
charge of Brisbane in 1851 or 1852; Mr. Wallace being transferred
to Ipswich, where a temporary wooden building had been, or was
about to be, built. At what date Mr. Irwin's connection with the
parish ceased, I am unable to find; but in an entry of a meeting
on February 7, 1856, the name of the Rev. &mdash; Yeatman occurs;
and he appears to have continued at St. John's until September,
1858, when he left the district. Mr. Wallace had preceded him in
December, 1851, and was succeeded by the late Rev. John Moseley,
who, throwing his whole soul into his parochial work, was the
principal instrument in procuring the erection of the large,
though not very ecclesiastical looking, church of St. Paul's is
Ipswich. On Mr. Yeatman leaving, Mr. Moseley was transferred to
Brisbane, being succeeded in Ipswich by the Rev. L. H. Rumsey;
and at the date at which this portion of this history terminates,
the services of the three clergymen seem to have been thus
distributed:&mdash;Mr. Mosely had charge of the Brisbane
district, in which was included, besides the duties at St.
John's, occasional services in the buildings which accommodated
both congregations and scholars in Fortitude Valley, South
Brisbane,* and, I presume, when he could find time, at Kangaroo
Point as well; Mr. Rumsey attended to St. Paul's, Ipswich, and
the districts around that town; while Mr. Glennie travelled over
the Darling Downs, his district including Drayton and Toowoomba,
Dalby, Leyburn, and Warwick&mdash;an area of at least 8,000
square miles. This memoir would be exceedingly imperfect were I
not to record my admiration of the unostentatious unceasing
labours of Mr. Glennie, who, colporteur, schoolmaster, and
priest, walked and rode, with pack well stored with the books he
thought most likely to be useful, many thousands of miles in the
course of his long, unassisted, and solitary ministrations over
that large extent of territory, labouring alike for the present
and the future, and, on his retirement, carrying with him the
affectionate respect of those most familiar with his self-denying
unselfish toil, and his kindly simple advocacy of the cause he
loved so well. It is proper also to mention the aid frequently
given, in Brisbane and its vicinity, by the Rev. R. Creyke, at
the time too invalided to take a regular cure&mdash;but now
incumbent of the suburban parish of Toowong.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Both the buildings, wonderfully unlovely in
their way, seem to have been put up in 1857.]</p>
<p>I do not, in the slightest degree, infer any want of
earnestness or ability in the clergymen who successively
attempted to minister to the congregations of the Anglican Church
during the period over which I have gone, when I admit that the
result of their labours in the Moreton Bay district appears to
have been far from successful. The imperfect nature of the Church
Acts greatly contributed to cripple their efforts. In prescribing
the voting qualifications, those acts exhibit a temporizing
timidity, significant of changing and uncertain times, of which
indifference was a prominent characteristic. When they supplied
no readily available corrective for any breach of their own
provisions, or of the internal laws of the body to which they
were intended to apply, their inevitable tendency to subordinate
the collective church to the individual congregation became
exceedingly mischievous. Their framer had, no doubt, to some
extent, the disciplinary powers of the mother church impressed
upon his mind, but he did not give due weight to the altered
circumstances around him, which, in great measure, neutralised
their operation; neither did he attempt to supply the deficiency
thus created, and it is quite possible that the excellent
prelate, who seems to have exerted himself in procuring this
legislation, was unacquainted with the technicalities which were
necessary to carry his intentions fully into effect. It is easy
to see what the real purpose of these acts was; it is equally
apparent that the machinery provided was inadequate to the
proposed end.</p>
<p>But whatever might have been the imperfections of the law, the
obedience rendered to it in the Moreton Bay district was
intermittent and desultory. The notions generally entertained as
to what the real doctrines or discipline of the Anglican Church
might be were exceedingly vague, while the intense localism
incidental to small communities had generated a spirit adverse to
its constitution. Its members became impressed with a sense of
responsibility which sometimes exhibited itself in rather
eccentric directions. For all practical purposes the canons of
1603 might as well have been the Institutes of Justinian, and had
any priest of the church attempted in 1859 to impose the
thirtieth upon his congregation, they would have stopped their
ears with their fingers and fled. But too often in the zeal to
discuss theology, plain, administrative duties were forgotten,
and the haste to criticise was more apparent than the critical
faculty or the knowledge essential to its beneficial employment.
The minister became less a teacher than a candidate for approval,
and churchwardens and trustees forgot their minute-books and
their accounts to rush into controversy over offertories and
responses with their Bishop. The records directed to be kept by
the Church Acts were scandalously neglected, even in churches of
metropolitan pretensions. In one case I found a period of four
years without a minute; in another a period of two, while not a
vestige of account was discoverable amongst the records of the
church, and the visitations of the Bishop were not only left
without specific notice, but were not even alluded to. Whatever
any minister might have attempted, it appears to me that, as to
the other officers of the church, "there being no king in Israel,
every man did that which was right in his own eyes," the natural
result being that in most cases every man thought all other men
more or less in the wrong.</p>
<p>To a church thus disorganized was appointed, as the first
Anglican Bishop in Queensland, the Right Reverend Edward Wyndham
Tuffnell, of Wallham College, Oxon, a man of old family and
considerable attainments, and a Prebendary of Salisbury. He came
to exchange for a life of learned leisure and dignified
association, under the shadow and amidst the eloquent, though
silent, grandeur of one of England's most magnificent cathedrals,
an existence embittered by a covert hostility, exhibited in
little suspicions and insulting insinuation. I have said in
Queensland, because the boundaries of the colony and of Dr.
Tuffnell's diocese were not co-terminous. At the creation of the
diocese of Newcastle its northern limit was found at the 21st
parallel of latitude, the western at 141° E. longitude; the
letters patent creating the new diocese limited it to such
portions of that of Newcastle as was comprised within the
boundaries of the new colony, and hence it followed that all of
Queensland beyond the old diocese was left under the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Sydney&mdash;an
arrangement subsequently productive of great inconvenience.
However, for this there was no remedy, and under the
circumstances I have described the Anglican Church awaited its
reorganization and its head.</p>
<p>I regret that I could not obtain the information necessary to
enable me to give as detailed an account of the establishment of
the Roman Catholic Church in Moreton Bay as I desired. I gather
from the <i>Courier</i> that in 1846 one priest had been sent
here whose name does not appear, but that he was a man of
considerable energy I should infer from the commencement of a
chapel in 1848. The ministrations of whatever clergy were here
seem to have been uneventful, and the peace of the church,
undisturbed by internal dissension, although the spirit of
localism was said to have been stronger than in later days, was
thought consistent with ecclesiastical discipline. The late
Archbishop Polding visited the district in September, 1858, but
the journals of the day make no special mention of the causes or
results of his visitation; in fact, I do not think that Roman
Catholicism found much favor in the eyes of the newspapers of
those times. In 1859 there were two clergy here&mdash;the Very
Reverend. Dean Rigny&mdash;one of a class now well nigh extinct,
mingling with not a little of the polish of the old French Abbe,
a frank and kindly courtesy that won the hearts of all who came
in contact with him&mdash;was resident in Brisbane. Father
M'Ginty, an active, energetic, warm-hearted priest, of a
different type, was devoting himself to his duties&mdash;not the
least being the erection of a chapel somewhat in advance of the
ordinary taste of the times&mdash;at Ipswich, and in the interior
districts to the west of that town. Both of them were popular,
and from what I remember of the circumstances and the people, I
should say, deservedly so. Their church was, from its
constitution, left unfettered by special legislation, but partook
of the advantages offered by the General Churches Act, and at the
time of separation were each left in receipt from the state of
£150 a year. In view of the new colony a diocese of concurrent
extent had been created, to which the late Right Reverend James
O'Quinn had been nominated Bishop, of whom, as he did not arrive
until some months after the new Government began, I defer further
mention.</p>
<p>The settlement of the Scottish Presbyterian Church in
Queensland may be traced to three sources. In the parent colony
of New South Wales a variety of causes, detailed at some length
in Dr. Lang's history of New South Wales, led to the existence at
this time of three Synods: the Synod of Australia, connected with
the Established Church of Scotland; the Synod of Eastern
Australia, erected by the Free Church party in the colony in
connection with that church in the old country; and the Synod of
New South Wales, called into existence by Dr. Lang, when he
disavowed the Established Church, and held himself aloof from, or
was held at arms length by, the church of the secession. It is
unnecessary to detail the disputes and troubles that perplexed
those times, and did little credit to the controversialists;
whoever has a taste for that peculiar sort of polemics will find
in the history I have alluded to a pungent enough description of
the whole&mdash;of course from the writer's own point of
view&mdash;which I do not think it necessary to repeat or
abridge.</p>
<p>The branch of the Established Church of Scotland in Australia
was, as regards all grants made to it from the State, placed
under the operation of the General Churches Act before referred
to. But, subsequently to the passing of that Act it was, as in
the case of the Anglican Church, found necessary to adopt special
legislation adapted to its circumstances and ecclesiastical
peculiarities. By the 8 Wm. IV., No. 7, more detailed provision
was made than had before been for the nomination of trustees of
property or moneys given to, or held for, the Church; for
defining the manner in which the trusts created shall be
fulfilled, and for otherwise regulating the temporal affairs of
churches, chapels, and ministers' dwellings over which the then
Presbytery had or might have control. Without repeating the
technicalities of this Act&mdash;in many respects similar to
those of the Anglican Act before cited&mdash;I may note that the
minister in each case might be present and vote at the meeting of
trustees; that land appertaining to any church or chapel might,
under certain conditions, be let on twenty-eight years' leases,
provided that £150 a year was reserved oat of the income for the
minister, and if he resided on the land a portion not exceeding
one-fifth of the area in addition; and that the powers and duties
of the trustees were specifically confined to the temporal
matters connected with the church or chapel in connection with
which they were appointed. In 1840, when the Presbytery was
converted into the Synod of Australia, a further Act&mdash;the 4
Victoria, No. 18&mdash;was passed, by which the powers before
given to the Presbytery were transferred to the Synod, and
practically all State aid to the Church made contingent on
conformity to the legislation then adopted. Under this Synod the
Rev. W. L. Nelson, D.D.,* was, in 1859, minister of the Scottish
Church of St. Stephen's, Ipswich, he having taken charge of the
district in 1853, and he received, I believe, £150 per annum in
aid of his stipend.</p>
<p class="foot">[* To whose kindness I am indebted for much of
the information given on this subject.]</p>
<p>The Synod of Eastern Australia&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., the Free
Church&mdash;was represented in 1859 by the Rev. C. Ogg, who
officiated at the church in Ann-street, of the date of whose
settlement here I have no record, but who still lives and labours
amongst us.</p>
<p>The Synod of New South Wales had, in 1859, two
representatives&mdash;one Mr. J. Kingsford, who seems to have had
a church and small congregation at Warwick, and the other, a Mr.
G. Wagner, who is described in the statistics as an "itinerating"
minister. The life of this sprout from the Presbyterian stem
seems to have been weakly, and its comprehensiveness far beyond
its strength; accordingly, in due time, it became defunct.</p>
<p>Judging by the statistics of attendance the Scottish
Presbyterian Church seems to have retained its hold upon the
people who came from the land of its birth;&mdash;principally of
a class whom Dr. Tulloch would net have been much in love with,
although he might have admired their consistency even in the
hatred of whistle kists and the preference of precentors. On the
doctrines taught I am neither qualified or called upon to say
more than that, at that time at least, the hearers appeared to
rejoice in an orthodoxy and hatred of Erastianism on one side,
and of Roman Catholicism and prelacy on the other, sufficient to
meet the requirements of the strictest presbytery of the old
nursery of Calvanism. What some might consider their narrowness
in theology did not nevertheless prevent their forming a very
valuable section in the general community.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Church showed its usual activity from the first
in the Moreton Bay district. So early as the year 1846 the Rev.
Wm. Moore was on a mission here, but after a time was succeeded
by the Rev. &mdash; Lightbody. In 1848 it was stated in the
Australian, Circuit Record that a small chapel had been erected
by Mr. George Little, on leasehold ground in North Brisbane, and
that three allotments had been granted as sites for a chapel, a
schoolroom, and a minister's dwelling&mdash;I presume the ground
at the angle of Albert and Adelaide streets, Brisbane, on which
the principal chapel now stands. The official report for 1848-9
stated that the attendance was good, that the building was always
filled, and sometimes crowded, and that a Sunday-school of forty
children had been established. In 1850 the Rev. John Watsford was
appointed to the ministry in Moreton Bay; how long he remained I
know not, but I infer that he had some assistance, since services
were held at Ipswich and at the German Station, as well as at
Brisbane. At this date all the Wesleyan circuits were mission
stations under the English Wesleyan Foreign Missionary Society,
but in 1855 the whole of the circuits in Australasia, New
Zealand, and the South Sea Islands were formed into a Conference,
affiliated to the British Conference. The return from Moreton Bay
to the new Conference showed that there were then three churches,
forty-two preaching places, and two Sunday-schools in the
district, in which five ministers and assistant ministers and ten
teachers ministered to six hundred hearers and one hundred and
twenty scholars. I am unable to give the names of their
successors up to 1859, but at the end of that year the Colonial
Statistics enumerate three ministers:&mdash;the Rev. Samuel
Wilkinson, who preached at Albert-street church, and is recorded
to have "held service at seven other places;" the Rev. William
Curnow, whose church was in Limestone-street, Ipswich; and the
Rev. Wm. Fallon, who was stationed at Warwick. The number of
persons generally attending is set down at 675, but no mention is
made of assistant ministers, Sunday-schools, teachers, or
scholars, nor am I sure that the statistics are to be implicitly
relied upon. It is however certain that the condition of the
church was solid and prosperous, as the astonishing advances made
during the next five or six years assuredly showed.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For the most valuable portion of the
information I have been able to record I am indebted to the
courtesy of the Rev. F. T. Brentnall, who took some trouble in
preparing the notes from which it has been compiled.]</p>
<p>There is an old proverb that "poverty makes men acquainted
with strange bedfellows," and the circumstances attendant upon
the early settlement of the Baptists in Queensland, to some
extent, illustrate it, although it might seem that the
co-operative spirit displayed in the first instance was
subsequently, at least for a time, lost sight of in what was
termed the genuineness of church membership. Be that as it may,
the series of events is too valuable as showing the spirit of the
times to be omitted from this record.</p>
<p>Before the arrival of the ship <i>Fortitude</i>, in 1849,
there were only two Baptists in Brisbane, but with that vessel
came the Reverend Charles Stewart&mdash;himself a Baptist
minister, and about five other members of the same denomination.
These, with a like number of Independents and Presbyterians,
formed a small but united congregation, of which Mr. Stewart
became the pastor, who held their services in the old
Court-house, in Brisbane, whose varying transformations I have
described, and the use of which was granted by Captain Wickham
for the purpose. The congregation grew and prospered under Mr.
Stewart's care, and in time £113 was collected, with which a
piece of land was bought fronting William-street and running back
to George-street, as a site for a chapel, and a further sum of
£600 was then raised, which was applied to the erection on part
of the ground of the first and, as it proved, the last church of
the united congregation. With prudent foresight it was agreed
that so soon as either of the three denominations considered
itself strong enough to, in the words of my informant, "set up
upon its own account," the church property was to be sold and the
proceeds equally divided. The services, however, were still
conducted by Mr. Stewart for three or four years, when failing
health compelled his retirement, and he returned to England where
he shortly afterwards died. After his departure the Baptists
thought that they had within themselves the elements of
stability, and the property was then sold to the late Dr. Lang
for £1,500, out of which they received their third share of
£500.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** That part of the ground on which the chapel
was built was, with the chapel, sold by Dr. Lang to the
Queensland Government for £2000. The building was for some years
used as a Telegraph Office, and then was converted into a
residence for the Government Printer, and so remains.]</p>
<p>After this separation, the Baptists were granted the use of
the oldest police court, then held in the same old building, in
which they had first met, and afterwards converted into offices
for the Crown Solicitor, the Attorney-General occupying the
lock-up and keeper's quarters, during which time the Rev. Smith
became the pastor; but, says my informant, "from either a defect
in the man himself, or a want of appreciation on the part of the
people, he remained only about a year." After he left, the church
remained without a minister until the arrival of the Rev. B. G.
Wilson, 1858, who remained its head until his death&mdash;nearly
twenty years afterwards. During the first year of his ministry,
the church in Wharf-street, which had been commenced the year
before, was completed at a cost of about £2,300; and, in the
statistics of the colony, I find the attendance stated as at 200,
besides which the denomination had a chapel at the German
Station, and a room at Ipswich; accommodation hereafter to expand
with the prosperity of the colony, and in fair proportion to
it.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I am obliged to my friend Mr. Wm. Bell and to
the Hon. James Swan for the greater portion of the information
thus condensed&mdash;the authenticity of which, I presume, will
not be challenged.]</p>
<p>Into what haven the Presbyterian division of the thus
separated congregation drafted, I am not aware, but the building
seems to have been occasionally availed of for divine service,
sometimes by the Lutheran body (Germans), as I find the Rev. C.
F. A. F. Schermeister described as officiating in it to an
attendance of forty, and sometimes in the tolerance of Dr. Lang,
by whomsoever being like-minded with himself required its
use.</p>
<p>The Independents formed a separate congregation, for some time
availing themselves of the old School of Arts, until the
completion of the then new church in Wharf-street, North
Brisbane, and, in 1859, the statistics register the name of the
Reverend George Wight as the minister, the attendance being
stated as 150. Another entry informs us that the Reverend J. J.
Waraker was the pastor of a congregation of 100 at Ipswich, the
origin of which was in some respects akin to that of those I have
just described. Briefly, the incidents seem to have been these:
Up to March, 1857, there was, outside the Anglican and Roman
Catholic Churches, no settled minister of any denomination in
Ipswich; in that month the Reverend Thomas Deacon, a Baptist
minister, arrived there, and shortly afterwards a temporary place
of worship was fitted up, in which service was carried on by him
for two years, when a meeting was held, at which it was resolved
to form a "Congregational Church which should include the two
denominations usually called the Baptist and Independent," and to
cement the union that the subjects of infant and adult baptism
should not be introduced into the pulpit, nor should any other
means be employed for the purpose of making Baptists Independents
or Independents Baptists." The compromise, unlike its predecessor
in Brisbane, was of short duration, for in about nine months both
resolutions were rescinded, for reasons which it is said "do not
transpire on the records of the Church." Mr. Deacon resigned his
pastorate, receiving the thanks of his late congregation for "the
excellent spirit he had displayed," and the Reverend E. Griffith,
who had been sent for from New South Wales, took his place; but,
after a brief pastorate of two years and four months, left to
take charge of the congregation at Maitland, in that colony.
Meanwhile, in 1855, a new chapel on which £100 had been expended,
and which is now used as a school-room, was opened with much
rejoicing, and in this the Reverend Mr. Waraker was officiating
at the creation of the colony. Nothing of moment arose after
this, unless the question whether the use of the harmonium was
permissible in public worship be deemed so. They to whom that
instrument is a source of pleasure will be gratified to learn
that after due deliberation the doubtful tendencies of
instrumental music were provided against by a stipulation that it
should be employed "to assist and not to supersede the
congregational psalmody," and that the harmonium was thereupon
admitted. Nothing thereafter seems to have disturbed the harmony
of the church, which went on its useful works quietly prospering,
yet not without energy withal.</p>
<p>I have thus gone through the early history of the settlement
of the different churches prior to the creation of the
colony&mdash;more in detail than by some may be thought
necessary; but to those who appreciate the glimpses of life and
thought and character which it affords, surely not without
interest or use. We may easily see how the difficulty of
organization and of adherence to the distinct lines of creed and
practice&mdash;which mark the separation between churches as
bodies beget indifference to both&mdash;to be succeeded in some
cases by a violent reaction, in others by a continued apathy to
what had been so forgotten from long disuse that, when recalled,
it was looked upon less as a return than as an obtrusive and
dangerous narrative. I suspect that the leaven thus raised did in
some measure, and to a greater extent than many would imagine,
leaven the whole mass of religious and political working in the
times that were to come, and, if so, the retrospect will have its
value.</p>
<p>To those who take the trouble to reflect on the circumstances
presented by this history it will be clear that the surface
agitation, which appeared to exert so marked an influence in
bringing about the separation from New South Wales, was without
doubt inferior in reality to the less evident undercurrent
excited by self-interest and selfish fear. The rapid progress of
those principles in land legislation which first found embodiment
in the measures of Sir John Robertson (the "Free-selection Jack"
of the period) alarmed the squatters&mdash;the leading and almost
the sole producing class of the little community&mdash;who
conceived that their share in the resources of the country was
threatened, and that their tenure would be almost extinguished by
his bill. And accordingly, while the popular platform was adopted
in Moreton Bay as one of the most efficient instruments in
arriving at the desired end, a persistent worrying of the
Colonial Office was kept up in London by men who were not popular
here, but there were received as the exponents of the wealthiest
and most influential class of the community, and who, ostensibly
fighting for that, found their zeal intensified by the
remembrance that they were especially fighting for themselves.
The almost invariable neglect of the district by the central
authorities was, without doubt, a special subject for invective,
but dissimilarity in general interest was an efficient cause of
separation; a fact which should act as a warning to ourselves,
although the local government Acts of recent years have done much
to remove the causes of that discontent at partial and unfair
expenditure, which was so deeply felt in the district prior to
1860. Whenever differences in climate, or cultivation in the
industries which result from them, attain their natural
development the obstacles to general legislation which must
naturally follow from them will exert much the same sort of
influence that similar ones did in the times we are reviewing.
Not even the telegraph itself can fully counteract the laxity
which distance permits to official administration remote from the
superior authority. We may, therefore, contemplate the ultimate
separation of the northern districts from the south more as a
sequence than as a calamity&mdash;as the necessary outcrop of
natural causes; and so viewing it may avert a bitterness which
the severance of Queensland from New South Wales left behind it,
to the damage and discredit of both.</p>
<p>Great anticipations of vast and indefinite advantages to
follow from separation were, no doubt, indulged
in&mdash;anticipations only just now beginning to be realised.
The right of self-government had been obtained, but, beyond that,
for many years afterwards, commerce ran in the old channels, and
the commercial dependance upon New South Wales was steadily
enforced and tacitly acquiesced in. With but a brief interval,
the greater part of the carrying trade of the colony was left in
the hands of a company in which our people had the slightest
possible interest; and, for a considerable period, up to the year
1880, the direct trade of the colony with Europe was steadily,
and yet almost unobservedly, decaying. In 1879; the import from
New South Wales was nearly fifty per cent. more than in 1877,
although our numbers increased but slightly; while from Great
Britain it had fallen rather more than twenty per cent. in the
same time, and was only a fifteenth of the whole. Administrative
independence may co-exist with commercial bondage, but they who
pointed this out were, for a long time, as voices crying in the
wilderness; and when, at last, the fact and its consequences were
brought home to the public appreciation, the conviction was
received as an unwelcome guest. It has taken a long time to
emancipate public thought and action from the old trammels, in
spite of the influx of population, in itself not nearly so great
or so continuous as was both possible and desirable. Those who
came were unacquainted with the local circumstances, seldom
concerned themselves in our politics, such as they were, and soon
became permeated with the ideas of the older residents, possibly
from deference to their presumedly greater experience&mdash;a
term more abused than most terms in the language. We may, in the
words of the old Greek, grow old considering many things, and yet
have learned little&mdash;and the bulk of mankind don't consider.
One thing the colony has been a long time discovering&mdash;the
value of self-dependence&mdash;the other, which it has yet to
learn, is the adjustment of ends to means.</p>
<p>In the early history of the district, the combination of
patience and skill was not often found, and, like that of the
later period, it presents us with abundance of beginnings on a
large scale, and endings on a small one; of miscalculations of
power; of want of unanimity; and of that natural trust between
classes and individuals which is necessary to make a nation
happy, and keep it so. Perhaps this was natural to the paucity of
numbers, agreement in opinion being always fractional in the body
amongst whom it is formed; and what ten men out of a thousand may
find impossible, 100 in 10,000 may easily carry out. But it is
impossible to glance over the period from 1842 to 1859 without
feeling a thrill of admiration at the persistent endurance with
which the early settlers confronted the difficulties of a varying
fortune, consolidated their social strength against the
introduction of a criminal, servile, and degraded element, and
rejected the independence they craved if it were to be clogged by
such a weight. That there should have been some narrowness of
mind, some local jealousies, and some class hostility was, under
all the circumstances, as natural as to be regretted. But thus
much may be asserted in favor of the old colonists of Moreton
Bay: when Sir George Bowen came to assume the government of
Queensland he found a community second to none in the British
dominions in their unaffected hospitality, in their natural
propriety of conduct, in the support of their religious and
educational institutions, and in their desire to see their
adopted country placed on the road to, what they believed ought
to be, its position in the great empire of which it formed a
part. And if, with these qualities, the defects arising from long
repression and comparative isolation and small numbers did
display themselves, we may, while congratulating ourselves upon a
wider sphere and greater breadth of thought, sometimes question
whether both have not been gained by the sacrifice of the less
showy virtues of our predecessors, and unhappily in some cases to
their extinction.</p>
