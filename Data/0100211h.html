<h2><a name="foreword" id="foreword">FOREWORD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">To Jason Gridley</span> of
Tarzana, discoverer of the Gridley Wave, belonged the credit of
establishing radio communication between Pellucidar and the outer
world.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to be much in his laboratory while he was
carrying on his experiments and to be, also, the recipient of his
confidences, so that I was fully aware that while he hoped to
establish communication with Pellucidar he was also reaching out
toward an even more stupendous accomplishment&mdash;he was groping
through space for contact with another planet; nor did he attempt
to deny that the present goal of his ambition was radio
communication with Mars.</p>

<p>Gridley had constructed a simple, automatic device for
broadcasting signals intermittently and for recording whatever
might be received during his absence.</p>

<p>For a period of five minutes the Gridley Wave carried a simple
code signal consisting of two letters, "J.G.," out into the ether,
following which there was a pause of ten minutes. Hour after hour,
day after day, week after week, these silent, invisible messengers
sped out to the uttermost reaches of infinite space, and after
Jason Gridley left Tarzana to embark upon his expedition to
Pellucidar, I found myself drawn to his laboratory by the lure of
the tantalizing possibilities of his dream, as well as by the
promise I had made him that I would look in occasionally to see
that the device was functioning properly and to examine the
recording instruments for any indication that the signals had been
received and answered.</p>

<p>My considerable association with Gridley had given me a fair
working knowledge of his devices and sufficient knowledge of the
Morse Code to enable me to receive with moderate accuracy and
speed.</p>

<p>Months passed; dust accumulated thickly upon everything except
the working parts of Gridley's device, and the white ribbon of
ticker tape that was to receive an answering signal retained its
virgin purity; then I went away for a short trip into Arizona.</p>

<p>I was absent for about ten days and upon my return one of the
first things with which I concerned myself was an inspection of
Gridley's laboratory and the instruments he had left in my care. As
I entered the familiar room and switched on the lights it was with
the expectation of meeting with the same blank unresponsiveness to
which I was by now quite accustomed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, hope of success had never been raised to
any considerable degree in my breast, nor had Gridley been over
sanguine&mdash;his was merely an experiment. He considered it well
worth while to make it, and I considered it equally worth while to
lend him what small assistance I might.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with feelings of astonishment that assumed
the magnitude of a distinct shock that I saw upon the ticker tape
the familiar tracings which stand for the dots and dashes of
code.</p>

<p>Of course I realized that some other researcher might have
duplicated Jason's discovery of the Gridley Wave and that the
message might have originated upon earth, or, again, it might be a
message from Jason himself in Pellucidar, but when I had deciphered
it, all doubts were quickly put to rest. It was from Ulysses
Paxton, one time captain,&mdash;the U.S. Infantry, who,
miraculously transported from a battlefield in France to the bosom
of the great Red Planet, had become the right hand man of Ras
Thavas, the mastermind of Mars, and later the husband of Valla Dia,
daughter of Kor San, Jeddak of Duhor.</p>

<p>In brief, the message explained that for months mysterious
signals had been received at Helium, and while they were unable to
interpret them, they felt that they came from Jasoom, the name by
which the planet Earth is known upon Mars.</p>

<p>John Carter being absent from Helium, a fast flier had been
dispatched to Duhor bearing an urgent request to Paxton to come at
once to the twin cities and endeavor to determine if in truth the
signals they were receiving actually originated upon the planet of
his birth.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at Helium, Paxton immediately recognized the
Morse Code signals and no doubt was left in the minds of the
Martian scientists that at last something tangible had been
accomplished toward the solution of inter-communication between
Jasoom and Barsoom.</p>

<p>Repeated attempts to transmit answering signals to Earth proved
fruitless and then the best minds of Helium settled down to the
task of analyzing and reproducing the Gridley Wave.</p>

<p>They felt that at last they had succeeded. Paxton had sent his
message and they were eagerly awaiting an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>I have since been in almost constant communication with Mars,
but out of loyalty to Jason Gridley, to whom all the credit and
honor are due, I have made no official announcement, nor shall I
give out any important information, leaving all that for his return
to the outer world; but I believe that I am betraying no confidence
if I narrate to you the interesting story of Hadron of Hastor,
which Paxton told me one evening not long since.</p>

<p>I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did.</p>

<p>But before I go on with the story a brief description of the
principal races of Mars, their political and military organization
and some of their customs may prove of interest to many of my
readers. The dominant race in whose hands rest the progress and
civilization&mdash;yes, the very life of Mars&mdash;differ but
little in physical appearance from ourselves. The fact that their
skins are a light reddish copper color and that they are oviparous
constitute the two most marked divergences from Anglo-Saxon
standards. No, there is another&mdash;their longevity. A thousand
years is the natural span of life of a Martian, although, because
of their war-like activities and the prevalence of assassination
among them, few live their allotted span.</p>

<p>Their general political organization has changed little in
countless ages, the unit still being the tribe, at the head of
which is a chief or jed, corresponding in modern times to our king.
The princes are known as lesser jeds, while the chief of chiefs, or
the head of consolidated tribes, is the jeddak, or emperor, whose
consort is a jeddara.</p>

<p>The majority of red Martians live in walled cities, though there
are many who reside in isolated, though well walled and defended,
farm homes along those rich irrigated ribbons of land that we of
earth know as the Canals of Mars.</p>

<p>In the far south, that is in the south polar region, dwells a
race of very handsome and highly intelligent black men. There,
also, is the remnant of a white race; while the north polar regions
are dominated by a race of yellow men.</p>

<p>In between the two poles and scattered over all the and waste
lands of the dead sea bottoms, often inhabiting the ruined cities
of another age, are the feared green hordes of Mars.</p>

<p>The terrible green warriors of Barsoom are the hereditary
enemies of all the other races of this martial planet. They are of
heroic size and in addition to being equipped with two legs and two
arms apiece, they have an intermediary pair of limbs, which may be
used at will either as arms or legs. Their eyes are set at the
extreme sides of their heads, a trifle above the center, and
protrude in such a manner that they may be directed either forward
or back and also independently of each other, thus permitting these
remarkable creatures to look in any direction, or in two directions
at once without the necessity of turning their heads.</p>

<p>Their ears, which are slightly above the eyes and closer
together are small cupped-shape antennae, protruding several inches
from the head, while their noses are but longitudinal slits in the
center of their faces, midway between their mouths and ears.</p>

<p>They have no hair on their bodies, which are of a very light
yellowish-green color in infancy, deepening to an olive green
toward maturity, the adult males being darker in color than the
females.</p>

<p>The iris of the eyes is blood red, as an Albino's, while the
pupil is dark. The eyeball itself is very white, as are the teeth
and it is these latter which add a most ferocious appearance to an
otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance, as the lower tusks
curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of
earthly human beings are located. The whiteness of the teeth is not
that of ivory, but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china.
Against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand
out in a most striking manner, causing these weapons to present a
singularly formidable appearance.</p>

<p>They are a cruel and taciturn race, entirely devoid of love,
sympathy or pity.</p>

<p>They are an equestrian race, never walking other than to move
about their camps.</p>

<p>Their mounts, called thoats, are great savage beasts' whose
proportions harmonize with those of their giant masters. They have
eight legs and broad flat tails larger at the tips than at the
roots. They hold these tails straight out while running. Their
mouths are enormous, splitting their heads from their snouts to
their long, massive necks. Like their masters, they are entirely
devoid of hair, their skins being a dark slate color and
exceedingly smooth and glossy, with the exception of the belly,
which is white, and the legs, which shade from the slate of the
shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet. The feet are
heavily padded and nailless.</p>

<p>Like the red men, the green hordes are ruled by jeds and
jeddaks, but their military organization is not carried to the same
detail of perfection as is that of the red men.</p>

<p>The military forces of the red men are highly organized, the
principal arm of the service being the navy, an enormous air force
of battleships, cruisers and an infinite variety of lesser craft
down to one-man scout fliers. Next in size and importance is the
infantry branch of the service, while the cavalry, mounted on a
breed of small thoats, similar to those used by the green Martian
giants, is utilized principally in patrolling the avenues of the
cities and the rural districts that border the irrigating
systems.</p>

<p>The principal basic unit, although not the smallest one of the
military organization, is a utan, consisting of one hundred men,
which is commanded by a dwar with several padwars or lieutenants
junior to him. An odwar commands a umak of ten thousand men, while
next above him is a jedwar, who is junior only to the jed or
king.</p>

<p>Science, literature, art and architecture are in some of their
departments further advanced upon Mars than upon Earth, a
remarkable thing when one considers the constant battle for
survival which is the most marked characteristic of life upon
Barsoom.</p>

<p>Not only are they waging a continual battle against Nature,
which is slowly diminishing their already scant atmosphere, but
from birth to death they are constantly faced by the stern
necessity of defending themselves against enemy nations of their
own race and the great hordes of roving green warriors of the dead
sea bottom; while within the walls of their own cities are
countless professional assassins, whose calling is so well
recognized that in some localities they are organized into
guilds.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all the grim realities with which they have
to contend, the red Martians are a happy, social people. They have
their games, their dances and their songs, and the social life of a
great capital of Barsoom is as gay and magnificent as any that may
be found in the rich capitals of Earth.</p>

<p>That they are a brave, noble and generous people is indicated by
the fact that neither John Carter nor Ulysses Paxton would return
to Earth if they might.</p>

<p>And now to return to the tale that I had from Paxton across
forty-three million miles of space.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; SANOMA TORA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THIS is the story of Hadron of Hastor, Fighting
Man of Mars, as narrated by him to Ulysses Paxton:</p>

<p><br>
I am Tan Hadron of Hastor, my father is Had Urtur, Odwar of the 1st
Umak of the Troops of Hastor. He commands the largest ship of war
that Hastor has ever contributed to the navy of Helium,
accommodating as it does the entire ten thousand men of the 1st
Umak, together with five hundred lesser fighting ships and all the
paraphernalia of war. My mother is a princess of Gathol.</p>

<p>As a family we are not rich except in honor, and, valuing this
above all mundane possessions, I chose the profession of my father
rather than a more profitable career. The better to further my
ambition I came to the capital of the empire of Helium and took
service in the troops of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, that I
might be nearer the great John Carter, Warlord of Mars.</p>

<p>My life in Helium and my career in the army were similar to
those of hundreds of other young men. I passed through my training
days without notable accomplishment, neither heading nor trailing
my fellows, and in due course I was made a Padwar in the 91st Umak,
being assigned to the 5th Utan of the 11th Dar.</p>

<p>What with being of noble lineage by my father and inheriting
royal blood from my mother, the palaces of the twin cities of
Helium were always open to me and I entered much into the gay life
of the capital. It was thus that I met Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor
Hatan, Odwar of the 91st Umak.</p>

<p>Tor Hatan is only of the lower nobility, but he is fabulously
rich from the loot of many cities well invested in farm land and
mines, and because here in the capital of Helium riches count for
more than they do in Hastor, Tor Hatan is a powerful man, whose
influence reaches even to the throne of the Jeddak.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the occasion upon which I first laid eyes
upon Sanoma Tora. It was upon the occasion of a great feast at the
marble palace of The Warlord. There were gathered under one roof
the most beautiful women of Barsoom, where, notwithstanding the
gorgeous and radiant beauty of Dejah Thoris, Tara of Helium and
Thuvia of Ptarth, the pulchritude of Sanoma Tora was such as to
arrest attention. I shall not say that it was greater than that of
those acknowledged queens of Barsoomian loveliness, for I know that
my adoration of Sanoma Tora might easily influence my judgment, but
there were others there who remarked her gorgeous beauty which
differs from that of Dejah Thoris as the chaste beauty of a polar
landscape differs from the beauty of the tropics, as the beauty of
a white palace in the moonlight differs from the beauty of its
garden at midday.</p>

<p>When at my solicitation I was presented to her, she glanced
first at the insignia upon my armor, and noting therefrom that I
was but a Padwar, she vouchsafed me but a condescending word and
turned her attention again to the Dwar with whom she had been
conversing.</p>

<p>I must admit that I was piqued and yet it was, indeed, the
contumelious treatment she accorded me that fixed my determination
to win her, for the goal most difficult of attainment has always
seemed to me the most desirable.</p>

<p>And so it was that I fell in love with Sanoma Tora, the daughter
of the commander of the Umak to which I was attached.</p>

<p>For a long time I found it difficult to further my suit in the
slightest degree; in fact I did not even see Sanoma Tora for
several months after our first meeting, since when she found that I
was poor as well as low in rank I found it impossible to gain an
invitation to her home and it chanced that I did not meet her
elsewhere for a long time, but the more inaccessible she became the
more I loved her until every waking moment of my time that was not
actually occupied by the performance of my military duties was
devoted to the devising of new and ever increasingly rash plans to
possess her. I even had the madness to consider abducting her, and
I believe that I should eventually have gone this far had there
been no other way in which I could see her, but about this time a
fellow officer of the 91st, in fact the Dwar of the Utan to which I
was attached, took pity on me and obtained for me an invitation to
a feast in the palace of Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>My host, who was also my commanding officer, had never noticed
me before this evening and I was surprised to note the warmth and
cordiality of his greetings.</p>

<p>"We must see more of you here, Hadron of Hastor," he had said.
"I have been watching you and I prophesy that you will go far in
the military service of the Jeddak."</p>

<p>Now I knew he was lying when he said that he had been watching
me, for Tor Hatan was notoriously lax in his duties as a commanding
officer, all of which were performed by the senior Teedwar of the
Umak. While I could not fathom the cause of this sudden interest in
me, it was nevertheless very pleasing since through it I might in
some degree further my pursuit of the heart and hand of Sanoma
Tora.</p>

<p>Sanoma Tora herself was slightly more cordial than upon the
occasion of our first meeting, though she noticeably paid more
attention to Sil Vagis than she did to me.</p>

<p>Now if there is any man in Helium whom I particularly detest
more than another it is Sil Vagis, a nasty little snob who holds
the title of Teedwar, though so far as I was ever able to ascertain
he commands no troops, but is merely on the staff of Tor Hatan,
principally, I presume, because of the great wealth of his
father.</p>

<p>Such creatures we have to put up with in times of peace, but
when war comes and the great Warlord takes command it is the
fighting men who rank and riches do not count.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, while Sil Vagis spoiled this evening for
me as he would spoil many others in the future, nevertheless I left
the palace of Tor Hatan that night with a feeling bordering upon
elation, for I had Sanoma Tora's permission to see her again in her
father's home when my duties would permit me to pay my respects to
her.</p>

<p>Returning to my quarters I was accompanied by my friend, the
Dwar, and when I commented on the warmth of Tor Hatan's reception
of me he laughed.</p>

<p>"You find it amusing," I said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Tor Hatan, as you know," he said, "is very rich and powerful,
and yet it is seldom, as you may have noticed, that he is invited
to any one of the four places of Helium in which ambitious men most
crave to be seen."</p>

<p>"You mean the palaces of the Warlord, the Jeddak, the Jed and
Carthoris?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied. "What other four in Helium count for so
much as these? Tor Hatan," he continued, "is supposed to come from
the lower nobility, but there is a question in my mind as to
whether there is a drop of noble blood in his veins, and one of the
facts upon which I base my conjecture is his cringing and fawning
reverence for anything pertaining to royalty&mdash;he would give
his fat soul to be considered an intimate of any one of the
four."</p>

<p>"But what has that to do with me?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"A great deal," he replied; "in fact, because of it you were
invited to his palace tonight."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," I said.</p>

<p>"I chanced to be talking with Tor Hatan the morning of the day
you received your invitation and in the course of our conversation
I mentioned you. He had never heard of you, and as a Padwar in the
5th Utan you aroused his interest not a particle, but when I told
him that your mother was a princess of Gathol, be pricked up his
ears, and when he learned that you were received as a friend and
equal in the palaces of the four demigods of Helium, he became
almost enthusiastic about you. Now do you understand?" he concluded
with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied, "but none the less, I thank you. All
that I wanted was the opportunity and inasmuch as I was prepared to
achieve it criminally if necessary, I cannot quibble over any means
that were employed to obtain it, however unflattering they may be
to me."</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>For months I haunted the palace of Tor Hatan, and being
naturally a good conversationalist and well schooled in the stately
dances and joyous games of Barsoom, I was by no means an unwelcome
visitor. Also I made it a point often to take Sanoma Tora to one or
another of the four great palaces of Helium. I was always welcome
because of the blood relationship which existed between my mother
and Gahan of Gathol, who had married Tara of Helium.</p>

<p>Naturally I felt that I was progressing well with my suit, but
my progress was not fast enough to keep pace with the racing
desires of my passion. Never had I known love before and I felt
that I should die if I did not soon possess Sanoma Tora, and so it
was that upon a certain night I visited the palace of her father
definitely determined to lay my heart and sword at her feet before
I left, and, although the natural complexes of a lover convinced me
that I was an unworthy worm, that she would be wholly justified in
spurning, I was yet determined to declare myself so that I might
openly be accounted a suitor, which, after all, gives one greater
freedom even though he be not entirely a favored suitor.</p>

<p>It was one of those lovely nights that transform old Barsoom
into a world of enchantment. Thuria and Cluros were racing through
the heavens casting their soft light upon the garden of Tor Hatan,
empurpling the vivid, scarlet sward and lending strange hues to the
gorgeous blooms of pimalia and sorapus, while the winding walks,
graveled with semi-precious stones, shot back a thousand
scintillant rays that, clothed in ever-changing colors, danced at
the feet of the marble statuary that lent an added artistic charm
to the ensemble.</p>

<p>In one of the spacious halls that overlooked the garden of the
palace, a youth and a maiden sat upon a massive bench of rich
sorapus wood, such a bench as might have graced the halls of the
great Jeddak himself, so intricate its rich design, so perfect the
carving of the master craftsman who produced it.</p>

<p>Upon the leathern harness of the youth were the insignia of his
rank and service&mdash;a Padwar in the 91st Umak. The youth was I,
Hadron of Hastor, and with me was Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor
Hatan. I had come filled with the determination boldly to plead my
cause, but suddenly I had become aware of my unworthiness. What had
I to offer this beautiful daughter of the rich Tor Hatan? I was
only a Padwar, and a poor one at that. Of course, there was the
royal blood of Gathol in my veins, and that, I knew, would have
weight with Tor Hatan, but I am not given to boasting and I could
not have reminded Sanoma Tora of the advantages to be derived
because of it even had I known positively that it would influence
her. I had, therefore, nothing to offer but my great love, which
is, perhaps, after all, the greatest gift that man or woman can
bring to another, and I had thought of late that Sanoma Tora might
love me. Upon several occasions she had sent for me, and, although
in each instance she had suggested going to the palace of Tara of
Helium, I had been vain enough to hope that this was not her sole
reason for wishing to be with me.</p>

<p>"You are uninteresting tonight, Hadron of Hastor," she said
after a particularly long silence, during which I had been
endeavoring to formulate my proposal in some convincing and
graceful phrases.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I replied, "it is because I am trying to find the
words in which to clothe the most interesting thought I have ever
entertained."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" she asked politely, though with no great
show of interest.</p>

<p>"I love you, Sanoma Tora," I blurted awkwardly.</p>

<p>She laughed. It was like the tinkling of silver upon
crystal&mdash;beautiful but cold. "That has been apparent for a
long while," she said, "but why speak of it?"</p>

<p>"And why not?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because even if I returned your love, I am not for you, Hadron
of Hastor," she replied coldly.</p>

<p>"You cannot love me then, Sanoma Tora?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I did not say that," she replied.</p>

<p>"You could love me?"</p>

<p>"I could love you if I permitted myself the weakness," she said,
"but what is love?"</p>

<p>"Love is everything," I told her.</p>

<p>Sanoma Tora laughed. "If you think that I would link myself for
life to a threadbare Padwar even if I loved him, you are mistaken,"
she said haughtily. "I am the daughter of Tor Hatan, whose wealth
and power are but little less than those of the royal families of
Helium. I have suitors whose wealth is so great that they could buy
you a thousand times over. Within the year an emissary of the
Jeddak Tul Axtar of Jahar waited upon my father; he had seen me and
he said that he would return, and, merely for love, you would ask
me, who may some day be Jeddara of Jahar to become the wife of a
poor Padwar."</p>

<p>I arose. "Perhaps you are right," I said. "You are so beautiful
that it does not seem possible that you could be wrong, but deep in
my heart I cannot but feel that happiness is the greatest treasure
that one may possess, and love the greatest power. Without these,
Sanoma Tora, even a Jeddara is poor indeed."</p>

<p>"I shall take my chance," she said.</p>

<p>"I hope that the Jeddak of Jahar is not as greasy as his
emissary," I remarked rather peevishly, I am afraid.</p>

<p>"He may be an animated grease-pot for all I care if he will make
me his Jeddara," said Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>"Then there is no hope for me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not while you have so little to offer, Padwar," she
replied.</p>

<p>It was then that a slave announced Sil Vagis, and I took my
leave. I had never before plumbed such depths of despondency as
that which engulfed me as I made my unhappy way back to my
quarters, but even though hope seemed dead I had not relinquished
my determination to win her. If wealth and power were her price,
then I would achieve wealth and power. Just how I was going to
accomplish it was not entirely clear, but I was young and to youth
all things are possible.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>I had tossed in wakefulness upon my sleeping silks and furs for
some time when an officer of the guard burst suddenly into my
quarters.</p>

<p>"Hadron!" he shouted, "are you here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Praised be the ashes of my ancestors!" he exclaimed. "I feared
that you were not."</p>

<p>"Why should I not be?" I demanded. "What is this all about?"</p>

<p>"Tor Hatan, the fat old treasure bag, is gone mad," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Tor Hatan gone mad? What do you mean? What has that got to do
with me?"</p>

<p>"He swears that you have abducted his daughter."</p>

<p>In an instant I was upon my feet. "Abducted Sanoma Tora!" I
cried. "Has something happened to her? Tell me, quickly."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is gone, all right," said my informant, "and there is
something mighty mysterious about it."</p>

<p>But I did not wait to hear more. Seizing my harness, I adjusted
it as I ran up the spiral runway toward the hangars on the roof of
the barracks. I had no authority or permit to take out a flier, but
what did that mean to me if Sanoma Tora was in danger?</p>

<p>The hangar guards sought to detain and question me. I do not
recall what I told them; I know that I must have lied to them, for
they let me run out a swift one-man flier and an instant later I
was racing through the night toward the palace of Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>As it stands but little more than two haads from the barracks, I
was there in but a few moments, and, as I landed in the garden,
which was now brilliantly lighted, I saw a number of people
congregated there, among whom were Tor Hatan and Sil Vagis.</p>

<p>As I leaped from the deck of the flier, the former came angrily
toward me. "So it is you!" he cried. "What have you to say for
yourself? Where is my daughter?"</p>

<p>"That is what I have come to ask, Tor Hatan," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are at the bottom of this," he cried. "You abducted her.
She told Sil Vagis that this very night you had demanded her hand
in marriage and that she had refused you."</p>

<p>"I did ask for her hand," I said, "and she refused me. That part
is true; but if she has been abducted, in the name of your first
ancestor, do not waste time trying to connect me with the
diabolical plot. I had nothing to do with it. How did it happen?
Who was with her?"</p>

<p>"Sil Vagis was with her. They were walking in the garden,"
replied Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>"You saw her abducted," I asked, turning to Sil Vagis, "and you
are here unwounded and alive?"</p>

<p>He started to stammer. "There were many of them," he said. "They
overpowered me."</p>

<p>"You saw them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was I among them?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"It was dark. I could not recognize any of them, perhaps they
were disguised."</p>

<p>"They overpowered you?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"You lie!" I exclaimed. "Had they laid hands upon you they would
have killed you. You ran away and hid, never drawing a weapon to
defend the girl."</p>

<p>"That is a lie," cried Sil Vagis. "I fought with them, but they
overpowered me."</p>

<p>I turned to Tor Hatan. "We are wasting time," I said. "Is there
no one who can give us a clue as to the identity of these men and
the direction they took in their flight? How and whence came they?
How and whence did they depart?"</p>

<p>"He is trying to throw you off the track, Tor Hatan," said Sil
Vagis. "Who else could it have been but a disgruntled suitor? What
would you say if I should tell you that the metal of the men who
stole Sanoma Tora was the metal of the warriors of Hastor?"</p>

<p>"I would say that you are a liar," I replied. "If it was so dark
that you could not recognize faces, how could you decipher the
insignia upon their harness?"</p>

<p>At this juncture another officer of the 91st Umak joined us. "We
have found one who may, perhaps, shed some light upon the subject,"
he said, "if he lives long enough to speak."</p>

<p>Men had been searching the grounds of Tor Hatan and that portion
of the city adjacent to his palace, and now several approached
bearing a man, whom they laid upon the sward at our feet. His
broken and mangled body was entirely naked, and as he lay there
gasping feebly for breath, he was a pitiful spectacle.</p>

<p>A slave dispatched into the palace returned with stimulants, and
when some of these had been forced between his lips, the man
revived slightly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>"I am a warrior of the city guard," replied the man feebly.</p>

<p>An officer approached Tor Hatan excitedly. "My men have just
found six more bodies close to the point at which we discovered
this man," he said. "They are all naked and similarly broken and
mangled."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall get to the bottom of this yet," said Tor
Hatan, and, turning again to the poor, broken thing upon the
scarlet sward, he directed him to proceed.</p>

<p>"We were on night patrol over the city when we saw a craft
running without lights. As we approached it and turned our
searchlight upon it, I caught a single, brief glimpse of it. It
bore no colors or insignia to denote its origin and its design was
unlike that of any ship I have ever seen. It had a long, low,
enclosed cabin upon either side of which were mounted two peculiar
looking guns. This was all I had time to note, except that I saw a
man directing one of the guns in our direction. The padwar in
command of our ship immediately gave orders to fire upon the
stranger, and at the same time he hailed him. At that instant our
ship dissolved in mid-air; even my harness fell from me. I remember
falling, that is all," and with these words he gasped once and
died.</p>

<p>Tor Hatan called his people around him. "There must have been
someone about the palace or the grounds who saw something of this
occurrence," he said. "I command that no matter who may be
involved, whoever has any knowledge whatsoever of this affair,
shall speak."</p>

<p>A slave stepped forward, and as he approached Tor Hatan eyed him
with haughty arrogance.</p>

<p>"Well," demanded the odwar, "what have you to say? Speak!"</p>

<p>"You have commanded it, Tor Hatan," said the slave; "otherwise I
should not speak, for when I have told what I saw I shall have
incurred the enmity of a powerful noble," and he glanced quickly
toward Sil Vagis.</p>

<p>"And if you speak the truth, man, you will have won the
friendship of a padwar whose sword is not so mean but that it may
protect you even from a powerful noble," I said quickly, and I,
too, glanced at Sil Vagis, for it was in my mind that what the
fellow had to tell might be none too flattering to the soft fop who
masqueraded beneath the title of a warrior.</p>

<p>"Speak!" commanded Tor Hatan impatiently. "And see to it that
thou dost not lie."</p>

<p>"For fourteen years I have served faithfully in your palace, Tor
Hatan," replied the man, "ever since I was brought to Helium a
prisoner of war after the fall and sack of Kobol, where I served in
the bodyguard of the Jed of Kobol, and in all that time you have
had no reason to question my truthfulness. Sanoma Tora trusted me,
and had I had a sword this night she might still be with us."</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" cried Tor Hatan; "get to the point. What saw
you?"</p>

<p>"The fellow saw nothing," snapped Sil Vagis. "Why waste time
upon him? He seeks but to glory in a little brief notoriety.</p>

<p>"Let him speak," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I had just ascended the first ramp to the second level of the
palace," explained the slave, "on my way to the sleeping quarters
of Tor Hatan to arrange his sleeping silks and furs for the night
as is my custom, and, pausing for a moment to look out into the
garden, I saw Sanoma Tora and Sil Vagis walking in the moonlight.
Conscious that I should not thus observe them, I was about to
continue on my way about my duties when I saw a flier dropping
silently out of the night toward the garden. Its motors were
noiseless, it showed no light. It seemed a spectral ship and of
such strange design that even if for no other reason it would have
arrested my attention, but there were other reasons. Unlighted
ships move through the night for no good purpose, and so I paused
to watch it.</p>

<p>"It landed silently and quickly behind Sanoma Tora and Sil
Vagis; nor did they seem aware of its presence until their
attention was attracted by the slight clanking of the accoutrements
of one of the several warriors who sprang from its low cabin as it
grounded. Then Sil Vagis wheeled about. For just an instant he
stood as though petrified and then as the strange warriors leaped
toward him, he turned and fled into the concealing shrubbery of the
garden."</p>

<p>"It is a lie," cried Sil Vagis.</p>

<p>"Silence, coward!" I commanded.</p>

<p>"Continue, slave!" directed Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>"Sanoma Tora was not aware of the presence of the strange
warriors until she was seized roughly from behind. It all happened
so quickly that I scarce had time to realize the purpose of the
sinister visitation before they laid hands upon her. When I
comprehended that my mistress was the object of this night attack,
I rushed hurriedly down the ramp, but ere I reached the garden they
had dragged her aboard the flier. Even then, however, had I had a
sword I might at least have died in the service of Sanoma Tora, for
I reached the ship of mystery as the last warrior was clambering
aboard. I seized him by the harness and attempted to drag him to
the ground, at the same time shouting loudly to attract the palace
guard, but ere I did so one of his fellows on the deck above me
drew his long sword and struck viciously at my head. The blade
caught me but a glancing blow which, however, sufficed to stun me
for a moment, so that I relaxed my hold upon the strange warrior
and fell to the sward. When I regained consciousness the ship had
gone and the tardy palace guard was pouring from the guard room. I
have spoken&mdash;and spoken truthfully."</p>

<p>Tor Hatan's cold gaze sought out the lowered eyes of Sil Vagis.
"What have you to say to this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The fellow is in the employ of Hadron of Hastor," shouted Sil
Vagis. "He speaks nothing but lies. I attacked them when they came,
but there were many and they overpowered me. This fellow was not
present."</p>

<p>"Let me see thy head," I said to the slave, and when he had come
and knelt before me I saw a great red welt the length of one side
of his head above the ear, just such a welt as a glancing blow from
the flat side of a long sword might have made. "Here," I said to
Tor Hatan, pointing to the great welt, "is the proof of a slave's
loyalty and courage. Let us see the wounds received by a noble of
Helium who by his own testimony engaged in single- handed combat
against great odds. Surely in such an encounter he must have
received at least a single scratch."</p>

<p>"Unless he is as marvelous a swordsman as the great John Carter
himself," said the dwar of the palace guard with a thinly veiled
sneer.</p>

<p>"It is all a plot," cried Sil Vagis. "Do you take the word of a
slave, Tor Hatan, against that of a noble of Helium?"</p>

<p>"I rely on the testimony of my eyes and my senses," replied the
odwar, and he turned his back upon Sil Vagis and again addressed
the slave. "Didst thou recognize any of those who abducted Sanoma
Tora," he demanded, "or note their harness or their metal?"</p>

<p>"I got no good look at the face of any of them, but I did see
the harness and the metal of him whom I tried to drag from the
flier."</p>

<p>"Was it the metal of Hastor?" asked Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>"By my first ancestor, it was not," replied the slave
emphatically; "nor was it the metal of any other city of the Empire
of Helium. The design and the insignia were unknown to me, and yet
there was a certain familiarity about them that tantalizes me. I
feel that I have seen them before, but when and where I cannot
recall. In the service of my jed I fought invaders from many lands
and it may be that upon some of these I saw similar metal many
years ago."</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, Tor Hatan," I demanded, "that the aspersions
cast upon me by Sil Vagis are without foundation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hadron of Hastor," replied the odwar.</p>

<p>"Then with your leave, I shall depart," I said.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To find Sanoma Tora," I replied.</p>

<p>"And if you find her," he said, "and return her safely to me,
she is yours."</p>

<p>I made no other acknowledgment of his generous offer than to bow
deeply, for I had it in my mind that Sanoma Tora might have
something to say about that, and whether she had or not, I wished
no mate who came not to me willingly.</p>

<p>Leaping to the deck of the flier that brought me I rose into the
night and sped in the direction of the marble palace of the Warlord
of Barsoom, for, even though the hour was late, I was determined to
see him without an instant's unnecessary loss of time.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; BROUGHT DOWN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS I approached the warlord's palace I saw signs
of activity unusual for that hour of the night. Fliers were
arriving and departing, and when I alighted upon that portion of
the roof reserved for military ships, I saw the fliers of a number
of high officers of the Warlord's staff.</p>

<p>Being a frequent visitor at the palace and being well known by
all the officers of the Warlord's bodyguard, I had no difficulty in
gaining admission to the palace, and presently I was waiting in the
hall, just off the small compartment in which the Warlord is
accustomed to give small, private audiences, while a slave
announced me to his master.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I waited. It could not have been a long
while, yet it seemed to me a veritable eternity, because my mind
was harassed by the conviction that the woman I loved was in dire
danger. I was possessed by a conviction, ridiculous perhaps, but
none the less real, that I alone could save her and that every
instant I was delayed reduced her chances for succor before it was
too late.</p>

<p>But at last I was invited to enter, and when I stood in the
presence of the great Warlord I found him surrounded by men high in
the councils of Helium.</p>

<p>"I assume," said John Carter, coming directly to the point,
"that what brings you here tonight, Hadron of Hastor, pertains to
the matter of the abduction of the daughter of Tor Hatan. Have you
any knowledge or any theory that might cast any light upon the
subject?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "I have come merely to obtain your authority to
depart at once in an attempt to pick up the trail of the abductors
of Sanoma Tora."</p>

<p>"Where do you intend to search?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I do not yet know, sir," I replied, "but I shall find her."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Such assurance is at least an asset," he said, "and
knowing as I do what prompts it, I shall grant you the permission
you desire. While the abduction of a daughter of Helium is in
itself of sufficient gravity to warrant the use of every resource
to apprehend her abductors and return her to her home, there is
also involved in this occurrence an element that may portend high
danger to the empire. As you doubtless know, the mysterious ship
that bore her away mounted a gun from which emanated some force
that entirely disintegrated all the metal parts of the patrol flier
that sought to intercept and question it. Even the weapons and the
metal portions of the harness of the crew were dissipated into
nothing, a fact that was easily discernible from an examination of
the wreck of the patrol flier and the bodies of its crew. Wood,
leather, flesh, everything of the animal and vegetable kingdom that
was aboard the flier, has been found scattered about the ground
where it fell, but no trace of any metallic substance remains.</p>

<p>"I am impressing this upon you because it suggests to my mind a
possible clue to the general location of the city of these new
enemies of Helium. I am convinced that this is but the first blow,
since any navy armed with such guns could easily hold Helium at its
mercy, and few indeed are the cities of Barsoom outside the empire
that would not seize with avidity upon any instrument that would
give them the sack of the Twin Cities.</p>

<p>"For some time now we have been deeply concerned by the
increasing number of missing ships of the navy. In nearly all
instances these were ships engaged in charting air currents and
recording atmospheric pressures in different parts of Barsoom far
from the empire, and recently it has become apparent that the vast
majority of these ships which never return were those cruising in
the southern part of the western hemisphere, an unhospitable
portion of our planet concerning which we have unfortunately but
little knowledge owing to the fact that we have developed no trade
with the unfriendly people inhabiting this vast domain.</p>

<p>"This, Hadron of Hastor, is only a suggestion; only the vaguest
of clues, but I offer it to you for what it is worth. A thousand
one-man scout fliers will be dispatched between now and noon
tomorrow in search of the abductors of Sanoma Tora; nor will these
be all. Cruisers and battleships will take the air as well, for
Helium must know what city or what nation has developed a weapon of
destruction such as that used above Helium this night.</p>

<p>"It is my belief that the weapon is of very recent invention and
that whatever power possesses it, must be bending every effort to
perfect it and produce it in such quantities as to make them
masters of the world. I have spoken. Go, and may fortune be with
you."</p>

<p>You may believe that I lost no time in setting out upon my
mission now that I had authority from John Carter. Going to my
quarters I hastened my preparation for departure, which consisted
principally of making a careful selection of weapons and of
exchanging a rather ornate harness I had been wearing for one of
simpler design and of heavier and more durable leather. My fighting
harness is always the best and plainest that I can procure and is
made for me by a famous harness maker of Lesser Helium. My
equipment of weapons was standard, consisting of a long sword, a
short sword, a dagger and a pistol. I also provided myself with
extra ammunition and a supply of the concentrated ration used by
all Martian fighting men.</p>

<p>As I gathered together these simple necessities which, with a
single sleeping fur, would constitute my equipment, my mind was
given over to consideration of various explanations for the
disappearance of Sanoma Tora. I searched my brain for any slightest
memory that might suggest an explanation, or point toward the
possible identity of her abductors. It was while thus engaged that
I recalled her reference to the jeddak, Tul Axtar of Jahar nor was
there within the scope of my recollection any other incident that
might point a clue. I distinctly recalled the emissary of Tul Axtar
who had visited the court of Helium not long since. I had heard him
boast of the riches and power of his jeddak and the beauty of his
women. Perhaps, then, it might be as well to search in the
direction of Jahar as elsewhere, but before departing I determined
once again to visit the palace of Tor Hatan and question the slave
who had been the last to see Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>As I was about to set out, another thought occurred to me. I
knew that in the Temple of Knowledge might be found either
illustrations or replicas of the metal and harness of every nation
of Barsoom, concerning which aught was known in Helium. I therefore
repaired immediately to the temple and with the assistance of a
clerk I presently found a drawing of the harness and metal of a
warrior of Jahar. By an ingenious photostatic process a copy of
this illustration was made for me in a few seconds, and with this I
hastened to the palace of Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>The odwar was absent, having gone to the palace of the Warlord,
but his major-domo summoned the slave, Kal Tavan, who had witnessed
the abduction of Sanoma Tora and grappled with one of her
abductors.</p>

<p>As the man approached I noticed him more particularly than I had
previously. He was well built, with clear cut features and that air
which definitely bespeaks the fighting man.</p>

<p>"You said, I believe, that you were from Kobol?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I was born in Tjanath," he replied. "I had a wife and daughter
there. My wife fell before the hand of an assassin and my daughter
disappeared when she was very young. I never knew what became of
her. The familiar scenes of Tjanath reminded me of happier days and
so increased my grief that I could not remain. I turned panthan
then and sought service in other cities; thus I served in
Kobol."</p>

<p>"And there you became familiar with the harness and the metal of
many cities and nations?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"What harness and metal are these?" I demanded, handing him the
copy of the illustration I had brought from the Temple of
Knowledge.</p>

<p>He examined it briefly and then his eyes lighted with
recognition. "It is the same," he said. "It is identical."</p>

<p>"Identical with what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With the harness worn by the warrior with whom I grappled at
the time that Sanoma Tora was stolen," he replied.</p>

<p>"The identity of the abductors of Sanoma Tora is established," I
said, and then I turned to the major-domo. "Send a messenger at
once to the Warlord informing him that the daughter of Tor Hatan
was stolen by men from Jahar and that it is my belief that they are
the emissaries of Tul Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar," and without more
words I turned and left the palace, going directly to my flier.</p>

<p>As I arose above the towers and domes and lofty landing stages
of Greater Helium, I turned the prow of my flier toward the west
and opening wide the throttle sped swiftly through the thin air of
dying Barsoom toward that great unknown expanse of her remote
southwestern hemisphere, somewhere within the vast reaches of which
lay Jahar toward which, I was now convinced, Sanoma Tora was being
borne to become not the Jeddara of Tul Axtar, but his slave, for
jeddaks take not their jeddaras by force upon Barsoom.</p>

<p>I believed that I understood the explanation of Sanoma Tora's
abduction, an explanation that would have caused her intensive
chagrin since it was far from flattery. I believed that Tul Axtar's
emissary had reported to his master the charm and beauty of the
daughter of Tor Hatan, but that she was not of sufficiently noble
birth to become his jeddara, and so he had adopted the only
expedient by which he might possess her. My blood boiled at the
suggestion, but my judgment told me that it was doubtless
right.</p>

<p>During the past few years&mdash;I should say the last ten or
twenty&mdash;greater strides have been taken in the advancement of
aeronautics than had been previously achieved in the preceding five
hundred years.</p>

<p>The perfection of the destination control compass by Carthoris
of Helium is considered by many authorities to have marked the
beginning of a new era of invention. For centuries we seemed to
have stagnated in a quiet pond of self sufficiency, as though we
had reached the acme of perfection beyond which it was useless to
seek for improvement upon what we considered the highest possible
achievements of science.</p>

<p>Carthoris of Helium, inheriting the restless, inquiring mind of
his earth-born sire, awoke us. Our best minds took up the challenge
and the result was rapid improvement in design and construction of
air ships of all classes, leading to a revolution in motor
building.</p>

<p>We had thought that our light, compact, powerful radium motors
never could be improved upon and that man never would travel,
either safely or economically, at a speed greater than that
attained by our swift one-man scout fliers&mdash;about eleven
hundred haads per zode,[*] when a virtually unknown padwar in the
navy of Helium announced that he had perfected a motor that, with
one-half the weight of our present motors, would develop twice the
speed.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Note: Approximately one hundred and
sixty-six earth miles per hour]</p>
<br>

<p>It was this type of motor with which my scout flier was
equipped&mdash;a seemingly fuelless motor, since it derived its
invisible and imponderable energy from the inexhaustible and
illimitable magnetic field of the planet.</p>

<p>There are certain basic features of the new motor that only the
inventor and the government of Helium are fully conversant with and
these are most jealously guarded. The propeller shaft, which
extends well within the hull of the flier, is constructed of
numerous lateral segments insulated from one another. Around this
shaft and supporting it is a series of armature-like bearings,
through the center of which it passes.</p>

<p>These are connected in series with a device called an
accumulator through which the planet's magnetic energy is directed
to the peculiar armatures which encircle the propeller shaft.</p>

<p>Speed is controlled by increasing or diminishing the number of
armature bearings in series with the accumulator&mdash;all of which
is simply accomplished by a lever which the pilot moves from his
position on deck where he ordinarily lies upon his stomach, his
safety belt snapped to heavy rings in the deck.</p>

<p>The limit of speed, the inventor claims, is dependent solely
upon the ratio of strength to weight in the construction of the
hull. My one-man scout flier easily attains a speed of two thousand
haads per zode,* nor could it have withstood the tremendous strain
of a more powerful motor, though it would have been easy to have
increased both the power of one and the speed of the other by the
simple expedient of a longer propeller shaft carrying an additional
number of armature bearings.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Note: Approximately three hundred miles per
hour.]</p>

<p>In experimenting with the new motor at Hastor last year, an
attempt was made to drive a scout flier at the exceptional speed of
thirty-three hundred haads per zode,[*] but before the ship had
attained a speed of three thousand haads per zode it was torn to
pieces by its own motor. Now we are trying to attain the greatest
strength with the minimum of weight and as our engineers succeed we
shall see speed increased until, I am sure, we shall easily attain
to seven thousand haads per zode,[&dagger;] for there seems to be
no limit to the power of these marvelous motors.</p>

<p class="footnote">[&dagger; Note: Over one thousand miles per

<p>Little less marvelous is the destination control compass of
Carthoris of Helium. Set your pointer upon any spot on either
hemisphere; open your throttle and then lie down and go to sleep if
you will. Your ship will carry you to your destination, drop within
a hundred yards or so of the ground and stop, while an alarm
awakens you. It is really a very simple device, but I believe that
John Carter has fully described it in one of his numerous
manuscripts.</p>

<p>In the adventure upon which I had embarked the destination
control compass was of little value to me, since I did not know the
exact location of Jahar. However, I set it roughly at a point about
thirty degrees south latitude, thirty-five degrees east longitude,
as I believed that Jahar lay somewhere to the southwest of that
point.</p>

<p>Flying at high speed I had long since left behind the cultivated
areas near Helium and was crossing above a desolate and deserted
waste of ocher moss that clothed the dead sea bottoms where once
rolled a mighty ocean bearing upon its bosom the shipping of a
happy and prosperous people, now but a half- forgotten memory in
the legends of Barsoom.</p>

<p>Upon the edges of plateaus that once had marked the shore line
of a noble continent I passed above the lonely monuments of that
ancient prosperity, the sad, deserted cities of old Barsoom. Even
in their ruins there is a grandeur and magnificence that still has
power to awe a modern man. Down toward the lowest sea bottoms other
ruins mark the tragic trail that that ancient civilization had
followed in pursuit of the receding waters of its ocean to where
the last city finally succumbed, bereft of commerce, shorn of
power, to fall at last an easy victim to the marauding hordes of
fierce, green tribesmen, whose descendants now are the sole rulers
of many of these deserted sea bottoms. Hating and hated, ignorant
of love, laughter or happiness, they lead their long, fierce lives
quarreling among themselves and their neighbors and preying upon
any chance adventurers who happen within the confines of their
bitter and desolate domain.</p>

<p>Fierce and terrible as are all green men, there are few whose
cruel natures and bloody exploits have horrified the minds of red
men to such an extent as have the green hordes of Torquas.</p>

<p>The city of Torquas, from which they derive their name, was one
of the most magnificent and powerful of ancient Barsoom. Though it
has been deserted for ages by all but roaming tribes of green men,
it is still marked upon every map, and as it lay directly in the
path of my search for Jahar and as I had never seen it, I had
purposely laid my course to pass over it, and when, far ahead, I
saw its lofty towers and battlements I felt the thrill of
excitement and the lure of adventure which these dead cities of
Barsoom proverbially exert upon us red men.</p>

<p>As I approached the city I reduced my speed and dropped lower
that I might obtain a better view of it. What a beautiful city it
must have been in its time! Even today, after all the ages that
have passed since its broad avenues surged with the life of happy,
prosperous throngs, its great palaces still stand in all their
glorious splendor, that time and the elements have softened and
mellowed, but not yet destroyed.</p>

<p>As I circled low above the city I saw miles of avenues that have
not known the foot of man for countless ages. The stone flagging of
their pavement was overgrown with ocher moss, with here and there a
stunted tree or a grotesque shrub of one of those varieties that
somehow find sustenance in the arid wasteland. Silent, deserted
courtyards looked up at me, gorgeous gardens of another happier
day. Here and there the roof of a building had fallen in, but for
the most part they remained intact, dreaming, doubtless, of the
wealth and beauty that they had known in days of yore, and in
imagination I could see the gorgeous sleeping silks and furs spread
out in the sunlight, while the women idled beneath gay canopies of
silks, their jeweled harnesses scintillating with each move of
their bodies. I saw the pennons waving from countless thousands of
staffs and the great ships at anchor in the harbor rose and fell to
the undulations of the restless sea. There were swaggering sailors
upon the avenues, and burly, fighting men before the doors of every
palace. Ah, what a picture imagination conjured from the deathlike
silence of that deserted city, and then, as a long, swinging circle
brought me above the courtyard of a splendid palace that faced upon
the city's great central square, my eyes beheld that which
shattered my beautiful dream of the past. Directly below me I saw a
score of great thoats penned in what once may have been the royal
garden of a jeddak.</p>

<p>The presence of these huge beasts meant but one thing, and that
was that their green masters were to be found nearby.</p>

<p>As I passed above the courtyard one of the restless, vicious
beasts looked up and saw me and instantly he commenced to squeal
angrily. Immediately the other thoats, their short temper aroused
by the squealing of their fellow and their attention directed by
his upward gaze, discovered me and set up a perfect pandemonium of
grunts and squeals, which brought the result that I had immediately
foreseen. A green warrior leaped into the courtyard from the
interior of the palace and looked up just in time to see me before
I passed from his line of vision above the roof of the
building.</p>

<p>Realizing immediately that this was no place for me to loiter, I
opened my throttle and at the same time rose swiftly toward a
greater altitude. As I passed over the building and out across the
avenue in front of it, I saw some twenty green warriors pour out of
the building, their upward gaze searching the skies. The warrior on
guard had apprised them of my presence.</p>

<p>I cursed myself for a stupid fool in having taken this
unnecessary chance merely to satisfy my idle curiosity. Instantly I
took a zig-zag, upward course, rising as swiftly as I could, while
from below a savage war cry rose plainly to my ears. I saw long,
wicked looking rifles aimed at me. I heard the hiss of projectiles
hurtling by me, but, though the first volley passed close to us,
not a bullet struck the ship. In a moment more I would be out of
range and safe and I prayed to a thousand ancestors to protect me
for the few brief minutes that would be necessary to place me
entirely out of harm's way. I thought that I had made it and was
just about to congratulate myself upon my good luck when I heard
the thud of a bullet against the metal of my ship and almost
simultaneously the explosion of the projectile, and then I was out
of range.</p>

<p>Angry cries of disappointment came faintly to my ears as I sped
swiftly toward the southwest, relieved that I had been so fortunate
as to be able to get away without suffering any damage.</p>

<p>I had already flown about seventy karads from Helium, but I was
aware that Jahar might still be fifty to seventy-five karads
distant and I made up my mind that I would take no more chances
such as those from which I had just so fortunately escaped.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Note: A karad is equivalent to a degree of
longitude.]</p>

<p>I was now moving at great speed again and I had scarcely
finished congratulating myself upon my good fortune when it
suddenly became apparent to me that I was having difficulty in
maintaining my altitude. My flier was losing buoyancy and almost
immediately I guessed, what investigation later revealed, that one
of my buoyancy tanks had been punctured by the explosive bullet of
the green warriors.</p>

<p>To reproach myself for my carelessness seemed a useless waste of
mental energy, though I can assure you that I was keenly aware of
my fault and of its possible bearing upon the fate of Sanoma Tora,
from the active prosecution of whose rescue I might now be entirely
eliminated. The results as they affected me did not appall me half
so much as did the contemplation of the unquestioned danger in
which Sanoma Tora must be, from which my determination to rescue
her had so obsessed me that there had not entered into my thoughts
any slightest consideration of failure.</p>

<p>The mishap was a severe blow to my hopes and yet it did not
shatter them entirely, for I am so constituted that I know I shall
never give up hope of success in any issue as long as life remains
to me.</p>

<p>How much longer my ship would remain afloat it was difficult to
say, and, having no means of making such repairs as would be
necessary to conserve the remaining contents of the punctured
buoyancy tank, the best that I could do was to increase my speed so
that I might cover as much distance as possible before I was forced
down. The construction of my ship was such that at high speed it
tended to maintain itself in the air with a minimum of the Eighth
Ray in its buoyancy tanks; yet I knew that the time was not far
distant when I should have to make a landing in this dreary,
desolate wasteland.</p>

<p>I had covered something in the neighborhood of two thousand
haads since I had been fired upon above Torquas, crossing what had
been a large gulf when the waters of the ocean rolled over the vast
plains that now lay moss covered and arid beneath me. Far ahead I
could see the outlines of low hills that must have marked the
southwestern shore line of the gulf. Toward the northwest the dead
sea bottom extended as far as the eye could reach, but this was not
the direction I wished to take, and so I sped on toward the hills
hoping that I might maintain sufficient altitude to cross them, but
as they swiftly loomed closer this hope died in my breast and I
realized that the end of my flight was now but a matter of moments.
At the same time I discerned the ruins of a deserted city nestling
at the foot of the hills; nor was this an unwelcome sight since
water is almost always to be found in the wells of these ancient
cities, which have been kept in repair by the green nomads of the
wasteland.</p>

<p>By now I was skimming but a few ads* above the surface of the
ground. I had greatly diminished my speed to avoid a serious
accident in landing and because of this the end was hastened so
that presently I came gently to rest upon the ocher vegetation
scarcely a haad from the water-front of the deserted city.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Note: An ad is about 9.75 earth feet.]</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; CORNERED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MY landing was most unfortunate in that it left me
in plain sight of the city without any place of concealment in the
event that the ruins happened to be occupied by one of the numerous
tribes of green men who infest the dead sea bottoms of Barsoom,
often making their headquarters in one or another of the deserted
cities that line the ancient shore.</p>

<p>The fact that they usually choose to inhabit the largest and
most magnificent of the ancient palaces and that these ordinarily
stand back some little distance from the water-front rendered it
quite possible that even in the event that there were green men in
the city I might reach the concealing safety of one of the nearer
buildings before I was discovered by them.</p>

<p>My flier being now useless, there was nothing to do but abandon
it, and so, with only my weapons, ammunition and a little
concentrated rations, I walked quickly in the direction of the age
old water-front. Whether or not I reached the buildings unobserved,
I was unable to determine, but at any rate I did reach them without
seeing any sign of a living creature about.</p>

<p>Portions of many of these ancient, deserted cities are inhabited
by the great white apes of Barsoom, which are in many respects more
to be feared than the green warriors themselves, for not only are
these man-like creatures endowed with enormous strength and
characterized by intense ferocity, but they are also voracious
man-eaters. So terrible are they that it is said that they are the
only living creatures that can instill fear within the breasts of
the green men of Barsoom.</p>

<p>Knowing the possible dangers that might lurk within the
precincts of this ruin, it may be wondered that I approached it at
all, but as a matter of fact there was no safe alternative. Out
upon the dead monotony of the ocher moss of the sea bottom, I
should have been discovered by the first white ape or green Martian
that approached the city from that direction, or that chanced to
come from the interior of the ruins to the water- front. It was,
therefore, necessary for me to seek concealment until night had
fallen, since only by night might I travel in safety across the sea
bottom, and, as the city offered the only concealment nearby, I had
no choice but to enter it. I can assure you that it was not without
feelings of extreme concern that I clambered to the surface of the
broad avenue that once skirted the shore of a busy harbor. Across
its wide expanse rose the ruins of what once had been shops and
warehouses, but whose eyeless windows now looked down upon a scene
of arid desolation. Gone were the great ships! Gone the busy,
hurrying throngs! Gone the ocean!</p>

<p>Crossing the avenue I entered one of the taller buildings, which
I noticed was surmounted by a high tower. The entire structure,
including the tower, seemed to be in an excellent state of
preservation and it occurred to me that if I could ascend into the
latter, I should be able to obtain an excellent view of the city
and of the country that lay beyond it to the southwest, which was
the direction in which I intended to pursue my search for Jahar I
reached the building apparently unobserved, and, entering, found
myself in a large chamber, the nature and purpose of which it was
no longer possible to determine, since such decorations as may
possibly have adorned its walls in the past were no longer
discernible and whatever furniture it may have contained to give a
clue to its identity had long since been removed. There was an
enormous fireplace in the far end of the room and at one side of
this fireplace a ramp led downward, and upon the other a similar
ramp led upward.</p>

<p>Listening intently for a moment I heard no sound, either within
or without the building, so that it was with considerable
confidence that I started to ascend the ramp.</p>

<p>Upward I continued from floor to floor, each of which consisted
of a single large chamber, a fact which finally convinced me that
the building had been a warehouse for the storing of goods passing
through this ancient port.</p>

<p>From the upper floor a wooden ladder extended upward through the
center of the tower above. It was of solid skeel, which is
practically indestructible, so that though I knew it might be
anywhere from five hundred thousand to a million years old, I did
not hesitate to trust myself to it.</p>

<p>The circular interior core of the tower, upward through which
the ladder extended, was rather dark. At each landing there was an
opening into the tower chamber at that point, but as many of these
openings were closed only a subdued light penetrated to the central
core.</p>

<p>I had ascended to the second level of the tower when I thought
that I heard a strange noise beneath me.</p>

<p>Just the suggestion of a noise it was, but such utter silence
had reigned over the deserted city that the faintest sound must
have been appreciable to me.</p>

<p>Pausing in my ascent, I looked down, listening; but the sound
which I had been unable to translate was not repeated, and I
continued my way on upward.</p>

<p>Having it in my mind to climb as high up in the tower as
possible, I did not stop to examine any of the levels that I
passed.</p>

<p>Continuing upward for a considerable distance my progress was
finally blocked by heavy planking that appeared to form the ceiling
of the shaft. Some eight or ten feet below me was a small door that
probably led to one of the upper levels of the tower and I could
not but wonder why the ladder had been continued on upward above
this doorway, since it could serve no practical purpose if it
merely ended at the ceiling. Feeling above me with my fingers I
traced the outlines of what appeared to be a trap door. Obtaining a
firm footing upon the ladder as high up as I could climb, I placed
a shoulder against the barrier. In this position I was able to
exert considerable pressure upward with the result that presently I
felt the planking rise above me and a moment later, to the
accompaniment of subdued groans, the trap door swung upward upon
ancient wooden hinges long unused. Clambering into the apartment
above I found myself upon the top level of the tower, which rose to
a height of some two hundred feet above the avenue below. Before me
were the corroded remains of an ancient and long obsolete
beacon-light, such as were used by the ancients long before the
discovery of radium and its practical and scientific application to
the lighting requirements of modern civilization upon Barsoom.
These ancient lamps were operated by expensive machines which
generated electricity, and this one was doubtless used as a beacon
for the safe guidance of ancient mariners into the harbor, whose
waters once rolled almost to the foot of the tower.</p>

<p>This upper level of the tower afforded an excellent view in all
directions. To the north and northeast stretched a vast expanse. To
the south was a range of low hills that curved gently in a
northeasterly direction, forming in by-gone days the southern shore
line of what is still known as the Gulf of Torquas. Toward the west
I looked out over the ruins of a great city, which extended far
back into low hills, the flanks of which it had mounted as it
expanded from the sea shore. There in the distance I could still
discern the ancient villas of the wealthy, while in the nearer
foreground were enormous public buildings, the most pretentious of
which were built upon the four sides of a large quadrangle that I
could easily discern a short distance from the water-front. Here,
doubtless, stood the official palace of the jeddak who once ruled
the rich country of which this city was the capital and the
principal port. There, now, only silence reigns. It was indeed a
depressing sight and one fraught with poignant prophecy for us of
present day Barsoom.</p>

<p>Where they battled valiantly but futilely against the menace of
a constantly diminishing water supply, we are faced with a problem
that far transcends theirs in the importance of its bearing upon
the maintenance of life upon our planet. During the past several
thousand years only the courage, resourcefulness and wealth of the
red men of Barsoom have made it possible for life to exist upon our
dying planet, for were it not for the great atmosphere plants
conceived and built and maintained by the red race of Barsoom, all
forms of air breathing creatures would have become extinct
thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>As I gazed out over the city, my mind occupied with these dismal
thoughts, I again became aware of a sound coming from the interior
of the tower beneath me, and, stepping to the open trap, I looked
down into the shaft and there, directly below me, I saw that which
might well make the stoutest Barsoomian heart quail&mdash;the
hideous, snarling face of a great white ape of Barsoom.</p>

<p>As our eyes met the creature voiced an angry growl and,
abandoning its former stealthy approach, rushed swiftly up the
ladder. Acting almost mechanically I did the one and only thing
that might even temporarily stay its rush upon me&mdash;I slammed
down the heavy trap door above its head, and as I did so I saw for
the first time that the door was equipped with a heavy wooden bar,
and you may well believe that I lost no time in securing this, thus
effectually barring the creature's ascent by this route into the
veritable cul de sac in which I had placed myself.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, was I in a pretty predicament&mdash;two hundred
feet above the city with my only avenue of escape cut off by one of
the most feared of all the savage beasts of Barsoom.</p>

<p>I had hunted these creatures in Thark as a guest of the great
green Jeddak, Tars Tarkas, and I knew something of their cunning
and resourcefulness as well as of their ferocity. Extremely
man-like in conformation, they also approach man more closely than
any other of the lower orders in the size and development of their
brain. Occasionally these creatures are captured when young and
trained to perform, and so intelligent are they that they can be
taught to do almost anything that man can do that lies within the
range of their limited reasoning capacity. Man has, however, never
been able to subdue their ferocious nature and they are always the
most dangerous of animals to handle, which probably accounts more
even than their intelligence for the interest displayed by the
large audiences that they unfailingly attract.</p>

<p>In Hastor I have paid a good price to see one of these creatures
and now I found myself in a position where I should very gladly pay
a good deal more not to see one, but from the noise he was making
in the shaft beneath me it appeared to me that he was determined
that I should have a free show and he a free meal. He was hurling
himself as best he could against the trap door, above which I stood
with some misgivings which were presently allayed when I realized
that not even the vast strength of a white ape could avail against
the still staunch and sturdy skeel of the ancient door.</p>

<p>Finally convinced that he could not come at me by this avenue, I
set about taking stock of my situation. Circling the tower I
examined its outward architecture by the simple expedient of
leaning far outward above each of the four sides. Three sides
terminated at the roof of the building a hundred and fifty feet
below me, while the fourth extended to the pavement of the
courtyard two hundred feet below. Like much of the architecture of
ancient Barsoom, the surface of the tower was elaborately carved
from top to bottom and at each level there were window embrasures,
some of which were equipped with small stone balconies. As a rule
there was but a single window to a level, and as the window for the
level directly beneath never opened upon the same side of the tower
as the window for the level above, there was always a distance of
from thirty to forty feet between windows upon the same side, and,
as I was examining the outside of the tower with a view to its
offering me an avenue of escape, this point was of great importance
to me, since a series of window ledges, one below another, would
have proved a most welcome sight to a man in my position.</p>

<p>By the time I had completed my survey of the exterior of the
tower the ape had evidently come to the conclusion that he could
not demolish the barrier that kept him from me and I hoped that he
would abandon the idea entirely and depart. But when I lay down on
the floor and placed an ear close to the door I could plainly hear
him just below as he occasionally changed from one uncomfortable
position to another upon the small ladder beneath me. I did not
know to what extent these creatures might have developed
pertinacity of purpose, but I hoped that he might soon tire of his
vigil and his thoughts be diverted into some other channel.
However, as the day wore to a close this possibility seemed to grow
more and more remote until at last I became almost convinced that
the creature had determined to lay siege until hunger or
desperation forced me from my retreat.</p>

<p>How longingly I gazed at the beckoning hills beyond the city
where lay my route toward the southwest&mdash;toward fabled
Jahar.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the west. Soon would come the sudden
transition from daylight to darkness, and then what? Perhaps the
creature would abandon its vigil; hunger or thirst might attract it
elsewhere, but how was I to know? How easily it might descend to
the bottom of the tower and await me there, confident that sooner
or later I must come down.</p>

<p>One unfamiliar with the traits of these savage creatures might
wonder why, armed as I was with sword and pistol, I did not raise
the trap door and give battle to my jailer. Had I known positively
that he was the only white ape in the vicinity I should not have
hesitated to do so, but experience assured me that there was
doubtless an entire herd of them quartered in the ruined city. So
scarce is the flesh they crave that it is their ordinary custom to
hunt alone, so that in the event that they make a kill they may be
more certain of retaining the prize for themselves, but if I should
attack him he would most certainly raise such a row as to attract
his fellows, in which event my chance for escape would have been
reduced to the ultimate zero.</p>

<p>A single shot from my pistol might have dispatched him, but it
was equally possible that it would not, for these great white apes
of Barsoom are tremendous creatures, endowed with almost
unbelievable vitality. Many of them stand fully fifteen feet in
height and are endowed by nature with tremendous strength. Their
very appearance is demoralizing to an enemy; their white, hairless
bodies are in themselves repulsive to the eye of a red man; the
great shock of white hair bristling erect upon their pates
accentuates the brutality of their countenances, while their
intermediary set of limbs, which they use either as arms or legs as
necessity or whim suggests, render them most formidable
antagonists. Quite generally they carry a club, in the use of which
they are terribly proficient. One of them, therefore, seemed
sufficiently a menace in itself, so that I had no desire to attract
others of its kind, though I was fully aware that eventually I
might be forced to carry the battle to him.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was setting my attention was attracted toward
the water-front where the long shadows of the city were stretching
far out across the dead sea bottom. Riding up the gentle acclivity
toward the city was a party of green warriors, mounted upon their
great savage thoats. There were perhaps twenty of them, moving
silently over the soft moss that carpeted the bottom of the ancient
harbor, the padded feet of their mounts giving forth no sound. Like
specters, they moved in the shadows of the dying day, giving me
further proof that Fate had led me to a most unfriendly shore, and
then, as though to complete the trilogy of fearsome Barsoomian
menaces, the roar of a banth rolled down out of the hills behind
the city.</p>

<p>Safe from observation in the high tower above them, I watched
the party as it emerged from the hollow of the harbor and rode out
upon the avenue below me, and then for the first time I noted a
small figure seated in front of one of the warriors. Darkness was
coming swiftly now, but before the little cavalcade passed out of
sight momentarily behind the corner of the building, as it entered
another avenue leading toward the heart of the city, I thought that
I recognized the little figure as that of a woman of my own race.
That she was a captive was a foregone conclusion and I could not
but shudder as I contemplated the fate that lay in store for her.
Perhaps my own Sanoma Tora was in equal jeopardy. Perhaps&mdash;but
no, that could not be possible&mdash;how could Sanoma Tora have
fallen into the clutches of warriors of the fierce horde of
Torquas?</p>

<p>It could not be she. No, that was impossible. But the fact
remained that the captive was a red woman, and whether she were
Sanoma Tora or another, whether she were from Helium or Jahar, my
heart went out in sympathy to her and I forgot my own predicament
as something within me urged me to pursue her captors and seek to
snatch her from them; but, alas, how futile seemed my fancy. How
might I, who might not even save himself, aspire to the rescue of
another?</p>

<p>The thought galled me, it hurt my pride, and forthwith I
determined that if I would not chance dying to save myself, I might
at least chance it for a woman of my own race, and always in the
back of my head was the thought that perhaps the object of my
solicitude might, indeed, be the woman I loved.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen as I pressed my ear again to the trap door.
All was silent below so that presently I became assured that the
creature had departed. Perhaps he was lying in wait for me further
down, but what of that? I must face him eventually if he elected to
remain. I loosened my pistol in its holster and was upon the point
of slipping the bar that secured the door when I distinctly heard
the beast directly beneath me.</p>

<p>For an instant I paused. What was the use? It meant certain
death to raise that door, and in what way might I be profiting
either myself or the poor captive if I gave my life thus uselessly?
But there was an alternative&mdash;one that I had been planning to
adopt in case of necessity from the moment that I had first
examined the exterior construction of the tower. It offered a
slender chance of escape from my predicament and even a very
slender chance was better than what would confront me should I
raise the trap door.</p>

<p>I stepped to one of the windows of the tower and looked down
upon the city. Neither moon was in the sky; I could see nothing.
Toward the interior of the city I heard the squealing of thoats.
There would the camp of the green men be located. Thus by the
squealing of their vicious mounts would I be guided to it. Again a
hunting banth roared in the hills. I sat upon the sill and swung
both legs across and then turning on my belly slipped silently over
the edge until I hung only by my hands. Groping with my sandaled
toes, I felt for a foothold upon the deep-cut carvings of the
tower's face. Above me was a blue-black void shot with stars; below
me a blank and empty void. It might have been a thousand sofads to
the roof below me, or it might have been one; but though I could
see nothing I knew that it was one hundred and fifty and that at
the bottom lay death if a foot or a hand slipped.</p>

<p>In daylight the sculpturing had seemed large and deep and bold,
but by night how different! My toes seemed to find but hollow
scratches in a smooth surface of polished stone. My arms and
fingers were tiring. I must find a foothold or fall, and then, when
hope seemed gone, the toe of my right sandal slipped into a
horizontal groove and an instant later my left found a hold.</p>

<p>Flattened against the sheer wall of the tower I lay there
resting my tired fingers and arms for a moment and when I felt that
they would bear my weight again I sought for hand holds. Thus
painfully, perilously, monotonously, I descended inch by inch. I
avoided the windows, which naturally greatly increased the
difficulty and danger of my descent; yet I did not care to pass
directly in front of them for fear that by chance the ape might
have descended from the summit of the ladder and would see me.</p>

<p>I cannot recall that ever in my life I felt more alone than I
did that night as I was descending the ancient beacon-tower of that
deserted city for not even hope was with me. So precarious were my
holds upon the rough stone that my fingers were soon numb and
exhausted. How they clung at all to those shallow cuts, I do not
know. The only redeeming feature of the descent was the darkness,
and a hundred times I blessed my first ancestors that I could not
see the dizzy depths below me; but on the other hand it was so dark
that I could not tell how far I had descended; nor did I dare to
look up where the summit of the tower must have been silhouetted
against the starlit sky for fear that in doing so I should lose my
balance and be precipitated to the courtyard or the roof below. The
air of Barsoom is thin; it does not greatly diffuse the starlight,
and so, while the heavens above were shot with brilliant points of
light, the ground beneath was obliterated in darkness.</p>

<p>Yet I must have been nearer the roof than I thought when that
happened which I had been assiduously endeavoring to prevent the
scabbard of my long sword pattered noisily against the face of the
tower. In the darkness and the silence it seemed a veritable din,
but, however exaggerated it might appear to me, I knew that it was
sufficient to reach the ears of the great ape in the tower. Whether
a suggestion of its import would occur to him, I could not
guess&mdash;I could only hope that he would be too dull to connect
it with me or my escape.</p>

<p>But I was not to be left long in doubt, for almost immediately
afterward a sound came from the interior of the tower that sounded
to my over-wrought nerves like a heavy body rapidly descending a
ladder. I realize now that imagination might easily have construed
utter silence into such a sound, since I had been listening so
intensely for that very thing that I might easily have worked
myself into such a state of nervous apprehension that almost any
sort of an hallucination was possible.</p>

<p>With redoubled speed and with a measure of recklessness that was
almost suicidal, I hastened my descent and an instant later I felt
the solid roof beneath my feet.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief, but it was destined to be but a
short sigh and but brief relief, for almost instantly I was made
aware that the sound from the interior of the tower had been no
hallucination as the huge bulk of a great white ape loomed suddenly
from a doorway not a dozen paces from me.</p>

<p>As he charged me he gave forth no sound. Evidently he had not
held his solitary vigil this long with any intention of sharing his
feast with another. He would dispatch me in silence, and, with
similar intent I drew my long sword, rather than my pistol, to meet
his savage charge.</p>

<p>What a puny, futile thing I must have appeared confronting that
towering mountain of bestial ferocity.</p>

<p>Thanks be to a thousand fighting ancestors that I wielded a long
sword with swiftness and with strength; otherwise I must have been
gathered into that savage embrace in the brute's first charge. Four
powerful hands were reached out to seize me, but I swung my long
sword in a terrific cut that severed one of them cleanly at the
wrist and at the same instant I leaped quickly to one side, and as
the beast rushed past me, carried onward by its momentum, I ran my
blade deep into its body. With a savage scream of rage and pain it
sought to turn upon me, but its foot slipped upon its own
dismembered hand and it stumbled awkwardly on trying to regain its
equilibrium, but that it never accomplished, and still stumbling
grotesquely it lunged over the edge of the roof to the courtyard
below.</p>

<p>Fearing that the beast's scream might attract others of its kind
to the roof, I ran swiftly to the north edge of the building where
I had noted from the tower earlier in the afternoon a series of
lower buildings adjoining, over the roofs of which I might possibly
accomplish my descent to the street level.</p>

<p>Cold Cluros was rising above the distant horizon, shedding his
pale light upon the city so that I could plainly see the roofs
below me as I came to the north edge of the building. It was a long
drop, but there was no safe alternative, since it was quite
probable that should I attempt to descend through the building, I
would meet other members of the ape's herd who had been attracted
by the scream of their fellow.</p>

<p>Slipping over the edge of the roof I hung an instant by my hands
and then dropped. The distance was about two ads, but I alighted
safely and without injury. Upon your own planet, with its larger
bulk and greater gravity, I presume that a fall of that distance
might be serious, but not so, necessarily, upon Barsoom. From this
roof I had a short drop to the next, and from that I leaped to a
low wall and thence to the ground below.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the fleeting glimpse of the girl captive
that I had caught just at sunset, I should have set out directly
for the hills west of the town, banth or no banth, but now I felt
strongly upon me a certain moral obligation to make the best
efforts that I could for succoring the poor unfortunate that had
fallen into the clutches of these cruelest of creatures.</p>

<p>Keeping well within the shadows of the buildings I moved
stealthily toward the central plaza of the city, from which
direction I had heard the squealing of the thoats.</p>

<p>The plaza was a full haad from the water-front and I was
compelled to cross several intersecting avenues as I cautiously
made my way toward it, guided by an occasional squeal from the
thoats quartered in some deserted palace courtyard.</p>

<p>I reached the plaza in safety, confident that I had not been
observed.</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side I saw light within one of the great
buildings that faced it, but I dared not cross the open space in
the moonlight and so still clinging to the shadows I moved to the
far end of the quadrangle where Cluros cast his densest shadows,
and thus at last I won to the building in which the green men were
quartered. Directly before me was a low window that must have
opened into a room adjoining the one in which the warriors were
congregated. Listening intently I heard nothing within the chamber
and slipping a leg over the sill I entered the dark interior with
the utmost stealth.</p>

<p>Tiptoeing across the room to find a door through which I might
look into the adjoining chamber, I was suddenly arrested as my foot
touched a soft body and I froze into rigidity, my hand upon my long
sword, as the body moved.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; TAVIA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THERE are occasions in the life of every man when
he becomes impressed by the evidence of the existence of an
extraneous power which guides his acts, which is sometimes
described as the hand of providence, or is again explained on the
hypothesis of a sixth sense which transports to the part of our
brain that controls our actions, perceptions of which we are not
objectively aware; but, account for it as one may, the fact remains
that as I stood there that night in the dark chamber of the ancient
palace of the deserted city I hesitated to thrust my sword into the
soft body moving at my feet. This might after all have been the
most reasonable and logical course for me to pursue. Instead I
pressed my sword point firmly against yielding flesh and whispered
a single word: "Silence!"</p>

<p>A thousand times since then have I given thanks to my first
ancestors that I did not follow my natural impulse, for, in
response to my admonition a voice whispered: "Do not thrust, red
man; I am of your own race and a prisoner," and the voice was that
of a girl.</p>

<p>Instantly I withdrew my blade and kneeled beside her. "If you
have come to help me, cut my bonds," she said, "and be quick for
they will soon return for me."</p>

<p>Feeling rapidly over her body I found that her wrists and ankles
were secured with leather thongs and drawing my dagger I quickly
severed these. "Are you alone?" I asked as I helped her to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "In the next room they are playing for me to
decide to which one I shall belong." At that moment there came the
clank of side arms from the adjoining room. "They are coming," she
said. "They must not find us here."</p>

<p>Taking her by the hand I moved to the window through which I had
entered the apartment, but fortunately I reconnoitered before
stepping out into the avenue and it was well for us that I did so,
for as I looked to the right along the face of the building, I saw
a green Martian warrior emerging from the main entrance. Evidently
it had been the rattling of his side arms that we had heard as he
moved across the adjoining apartment to the doorway.</p>

<p>"Is there another exit from this room?" I asked in a low
whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "Opposite this window there is a doorway
leading into a corridor. It was open when they brought me in, but
they closed it."</p>

<p>"We shall be better off inside the building than out for a while
at least," I said. "Come!" And together we crossed the apartment,
groping along the wall for the door which I soon located. With the
utmost care I drew it ajar, fearing that its ancient hinges might
betray us by their complaining. Beyond the doorway lay a corridor
dark as the depths of Omean and into this I drew the girl, closing
the door silently behind us. Groping our way to the right away from
the apartment occupied by the green warriors, we moved slowly
through a black void until presently we saw just ahead a faint
light, which investigation revealed as coming through the open
doorway of an apartment that faced upon the central courtyard of
the edifice. I was about to pass this doorway and seek a hiding
place further within the remote interior of the building when my
attention was attracted by the squealing of a thoat in the
courtyard beyond the apartment we were passing.</p>

<p>From earliest boyhood I have had a great deal of experience with
the small breed of thoats used as saddle animals by the men of my
race and while I was visiting Tars Tarkas of Thark I became quite
familiar with the methods employed by the green men in controlling
their own huge vicious beasts.</p>

<p>For travel over the surface of the ground the thoat compares to
other methods of land transportation as the one-man scout flier
does to all other ships of the air in aerial navigation. He is at
once the swiftest and the most dangerous, so that, faced as I was
with a problem of land transportation, it was only natural that the
squeal of the thoats, should suggest a plan to my mind.</p>

<p>"Why do you hesitate?" asked the girl. "We cannot escape in that
direction since we cannot cross the courtyard."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I replied, "I believe that in this direction
may lie our surest avenue of escape."</p>

<p>"But their thoats are penned in the courtyard," she
remonstrated, "and green warriors are never far from their
thoats."</p>

<p>"It is because the thoats are there that I wish to investigate
the courtyard," I replied.</p>

<p>"The moment they catch our scent," she said, "they will raise a
disturbance that will attract the attention of their masters and we
shall immediately be discovered and captured."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I said; "but if my plan succeeds it will be well
worth the risk, but if you are very much afraid I will abandon
it."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it is not for me to choose or direct. You have
been generous enough to help me and I may only follow where you
lead, but if I knew your plan perhaps I might follow more
intelligently."</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said; "it is very simple. There are thoats. We
shall take one of them and ride away. It will be much easier than
walking and our chances for escape will be considerably greater, at
the same time we shall leave the courtyard gates open, hoping that
the other thoats will follow us out, leaving their masters unable
to pursue us."</p>

<p>"It is a mad plan," said the girl, "but is a brave one. If we
are discovered, there will be fighting and I am unarmed. Give me
your short sword, warrior, that we may at least make the best
account of ourselves that is possible."</p>

<p>I unsnapped the scabbard of my short sword from my harness and
attached it to hers at her left hip, and, as I touched her body in
doing so, I could not but note that there was no sign of trembling
such as there would have been had she been affected by fright or
excitement. She seemed perfectly cool and collected and her tone of
voice was almost reassuring to me. That she was not Sanoma Tora I
had known when she had first spoken in the darkness of the room in
which I had stumbled upon her, and while I had been keenly
disappointed I was still determined to do the best that I could to
assist in the escape of the stranger, although I was confident that
her presence might greatly delay and embarrass me while it
subjected me to far greater danger than would have fallen to the
lot of a warrior traveling alone. It was, therefore reassuring to
find that my unwelcome companion would not prove entirely
helpless.</p>

<p>"I trust you will not have to use it," I said as I finished
hooking my short sword to her harness.</p>

<p>"You will find," she said, "that if necessity arises I can use
it."</p>

<p>"Good," I said. "Now follow me and keep close to me."</p>

<p>A careful survey of the courtyard from the window of the chamber
overlooking it revealed about twenty huge thoats, but no green
warriors, evidence that they felt perfectly secure against
enemies.</p>

<p>The thoats were congregated in the far end of the courtyard; a
few of them had lain down for the night, but the balance were
moving restlessly about as is their habit. Across the courtyard
from us and at the same end stood a pair of massive gates. As far
as I could determine they barred the only opening into the
courtyard large enough to admit a thoat and I assumed that beyond
them lay an alley leading to one of the avenues nearby.</p>

<p>To reach the gates unobserved by the thoats, was the first step
in my plan and the better to do this I decided to seek an apartment
near the gate, on either side of which I saw windows similar to
that from which we were looking. Therefore, motioning my companion
to follow me, I returned to the corridor and again groping through
the darkness we made our way along it. In the third apartment which
I explored I found a window letting into the courtyard close beside
the gate. And in the wall which ran at right angles to that in
which the window was set I found a doorway that opened into a large
vaulted corridor upon the opposite side of the gate. This discovery
greatly encouraged me since it harmonized perfectly with the plan I
had in mind, at the same time reducing the risk which my companion
must run in the attempted adventure of escape.</p>

<p>"Remain here," I said to her, placing her just behind the gate.
"If my plan is successful I shall ride into this corridor upon one
of the thoats and as I do so you must be ready to seize my hand and
mount behind me. If I am discovered and fail I shall cry out 'For
Helium!' and that must be your signal to escape as best you
may."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon my arm. "Let me go into the courtyard
with you," she begged. "Two swords are better than one."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Alone I have a better chance of handling the
thoats than if their attention is distracted by another."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, and with that I left her, and re-entering
the chamber, went directly to the window. For a moment I
reconnoitered the interior of the courtyard and finding conditions
unchanged, I slipped stealthily through the window and edged slowly
toward the gate. Cautiously I examined the latch and discovering it
easy to manipulate, I was soon silently pushing one of the gates
back upon its hinges. When it was opened sufficiently wide to
permit the passage of a thoat, I turned my attention to the beasts
within the enclosure. Practically untamed, these savage creatures
are as wild as their uncaptured fellows of the remote sea bottoms,
and, being controlled solely by telepathic means, they are amenable
only to the suggestion of the more powerful minds of their masters
and even so it requires considerable skill to dominate them.</p>

<p>I had learned the method from Tar Tarkas himself and had come to
feel considerable proficiency so that I approached this crucial
test of my power with the confidence that was absolutely requisite
to success.</p>

<p>Placing myself close beside the gate, I concentrated every
faculty of my mind to the direction of my will, telepathically,
upon the brain of the thoat I had selected for my purpose, the
selection being determined solely by the fact that he stood nearest
to me. The effect of my effort was immediately apparent. The
creature, which had been searching for the occasional tufts of moss
that grew between the stone flags of the courtyard, raised his head
and looked about him. At once he became restless, but he gave forth
no sound since I was willing him to silence. Presently his eyes
moved in my direction and halted upon me. Then, slowly, I drew him
toward me. It was slow work, for he evidently sensed that I was not
his master, but on he came. Once, when he was quite near me, he
stopped and snorted angrily. He must have caught my scent then and
realized that I was not even of the same race as that to which he
was accustomed. Then it was that I exerted to their fullest extent
every power of my mind. He stood there shaking his ugly head to and
fro, his snarling lips baring his great fangs. Beyond him I could
see that the other thoats, had been attracted by his actions. They
were looking toward us and moving about restlessly, always drawing
closer. Should they discover me and start to squeal, which is the
first and always ready sign of their easily aroused anger, I knew
that I should have their riders upon me in no time, since because
of his nervous and irritable nature the thoat is the watchdog as
well as the beast of burden of the green Barsoomians.</p>

<p>For a moment the beast I had selected hesitated before me as
though undecided whether to retreat or to charge, but he did
neither; instead he came slowly up to me and as I backed through
the gate into the vaulted corridor beyond, he followed me. This was
better than I had expected for it permitted me to compel him to lie
down, so that the girl and I were able to mount with ease.</p>

<p>Before us lay a long vaulted corridor at the far end of which I
could discern a moonlit archway, through which we presently passed
onto a broad avenue.</p>

<p>To the left lay the hills, and, turning this way, I urged the
fleet animal along the ancient deserted thoroughfare between rows
of stately ruins toward the west and&mdash;what?</p>

<p>Where the avenue turned to wind upward into the hills, I glanced
back; nor could I refrain a feeling of exultation as I saw strung
out behind us in the moonlight a file of great thoats, which I was
confident would well know what to do with their new found
liberty.</p>

<p>"Your captors will not pursue us far," I said to the girl,
indicating the thoats with a nod of my head.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors are with us tonight," she said. "Let us pray that
they may never desert us."</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, I had a fairly good look at my
companion, for both Cluros and Thuria were in the heavens and it
was quite light. If I revealed my surprise it is not to be wondered
at for, in the darkness, having only my companion's voice for a
guide, I had been perfectly confident that I had given aid to a
female, but now as I looked at that short hair and boyish face I
did not know what to think; nor did the harness that my companion
wore aid me in justifying my first conclusion, since it was quite
evidently the harness of a man.</p>

<p>"I thought you were a girl," I blurted out.</p>

<p>A fine mouth spread into a smile that revealed strong, white
teeth. "I am," she said.</p>

<p>"But your hair&mdash;your harness&mdash;even your figure belies
your claim."</p>

<p>She laughed gayly. That, I was to find later, was one of her
chiefest charms&mdash;that she could laugh so easily, yet never to
wound.</p>

<p>"My voice betrayed me," she said. "It is too bad."</p>

<p>"Why is it too bad?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because you would have felt better with a fighting man as a
companion, whereas now you feel that you have only a burden."</p>

<p>"A light one," I replied, recalling how easily I had lifted her
to the thoat's back. "But tell me who you are and why you are
masquerading as a boy."</p>

<p>"I am a slave girl," she said; "just a slave girl who has run
away from her master. Perhaps that will make a difference," she
added a little sadly. "Perhaps you will be sorry that you have
defended just a slave girl."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "that makes no difference. I myself, am only a
poor padwar, not rich enough to afford a slave. Perhaps you are the
one to be sorry that you were not rescued by a rich man."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I ran away from the richest man in the world," she
said. "At least I guess he must have been the richest man in the
world, for who could be richer than Tul Axtar, Jeddak of
Jahar?"</p>

<p>"You belong to Tul Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I was stolen when I was very young from a city
called Tjanath and ever since I have lived in the palace of Tul
Axtar. He has many women&mdash;thousands of them. Sometimes they
live all their lives in his palace and never see him. I have seen
him," she shuddered; "he is terrible. I was not unhappy there for I
had never known my mother; she died when I was young, and my father
was only a memory. You see I was very, very young, indeed, when the
emissaries of Tul Axtar stole me from my home in Tjanath. I made
friends with everyone about the palace of Tul Axtar. They all liked
me, the slaves and the warriors and the chiefs, and because I was
always boyish it amused them to train me in the use of arms and
even to navigate the smaller fliers; but then came a day when my
happiness was ended forever&mdash;Tul Axtar saw me. He saw me and
he sent for me. I pretended that I was ill and did not go, and when
night came I went to the quarters of a soldier whom I knew to be on
guard and stole harness and I cut off my long hair and painted my
face that I might look more like a man, and then I went to the
hangars on the palace roof and by a ruse deceived the guards there
and stole a one-man flier.</p>

<p>"I thought," she continued, "that if they searched for me at all
they would search in the direction of Tjanath and so I flew in the
opposite direction, toward the northeast, intending to make a great
circle to the north, turning back toward Tjanath. After I passed
over Xanator I discovered a large grove of mantalia growing out
upon the dead sea bottom and I immediately descended to obtain some
of the milk from these plants, as I had left the palace so
hurriedly that I had no opportunity to supply myself with
provisions. The mantalia grove was an unusually large one and as
the plants grew to a height of from eight to twelve sofads, the
grove offered excellent protection from observation. I had no
difficulty in finding a landing place well within its confines. In
order to prevent detection from above, I ran my plane in among the
concealing foliage of two over-arching mantalias and then set about
obtaining a supply of milk.</p>

<p>"As near objects never appear as attractive as those more
distant, I wandered some little distance from my flier before I
found the plants that seemed to offer a sufficiently copious supply
of rich milk.</p>

<p>"A band of green warriors had also entered the grove to procure
milk, and, as I was tapping the tree I had selected, one of them
discovered me and a moment later I was captured. From their
questions I became assured that they had not seen me enter the
grove and that they knew nothing of the presence of my flier. They
must have been in a portion of the grove very thickly overhung by
foliage while I was approaching from above by making my landing;
but be that as it may, they were ignorant of the presence of my
flier and I determined to keep them in ignorance of it.</p>

<p>"When they had obtained as much milk as they required they
returned to Xanator, bringing me with them. The rest you know."</p>

<p>"This is Xanator?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"And what is your name?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tavia," she replied. "And what is yours?"</p>

<p>"Tan Hadron of Hastor," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is a nice name," she said. There was a certain boyish
frankness about the way she said it that convinced me that she
would have been just as quick to tell me had she not liked my name.
There was no suggestion of brainless flattery in her tone and I was
to learn, as I became better acquainted with her, that honesty and
candor were two of her marked characteristics, but at the moment I
was giving such matters little thought since my mind was occupied
with a portion of her narrative that had suggested to me an easy
and swift method of escape from our predicament.</p>

<p>"Do you believe," I asked, "that you can find the mantalia grove
where you hid your flier?"</p>

<p>"I am positive of it," she replied.</p>

<p>"Will the craft carry two?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is a one-man flier," she replied, "but it will carry both of
us, though both its speed and altitude will be reduced."</p>

<p>She told me that the grove lay to the southeast of Xanator and
accordingly I turned the thoat's head toward the east. After we had
passed well beyond the limits of the city we moved in a southerly
direction down out of the hills onto the dead sea bottom.</p>

<p>Thuria was winging her swift flight through the heavens, casting
strange and ever moving shadows upon the ocher moss that covered
the ground, while far above cold Cluros took his slow and stately
way. The light of the two moons clearly illuminated the landscape
and I was sure that keen eyes could easily have detected us from
the ruins of Xanator, although the swiftly moving shadows cast by
Thuria were helpful to us since the shadows of every shrub and
stunted tree produced a riot of movement upon the surface of the
sea bottom in which our own moving shadow was less conspicuous, but
the hope that I entertained most fondly was that all of the thoats,
had followed our beast from the courtyard and that the green
Martian warriors were left dismounted, in which event no pursuit
could overtake us.</p>

<p>The great beast that was carrying us moved swiftly and silently
so that it was not long before we saw in the distance the shadowy
foliage of the mantalia grove and shortly afterward we entered its
gloomy confines. It was not without considerable difficulty,
however, that we located Tavia's flier, and mighty glad was I, too,
when we found it in good condition for we had seen more than a
single shadowy form slinking through the forest and I knew that the
fierce animals of the barren hills and the great white apes of the
ruined cities were equally fond of the milk of the mantalia and
that we should be fortunate, indeed, if we escaped an
encounter.</p>

<p>I rode as close to the flier as possible, and, leaving Tavia on
the thoat, slipped quickly to the ground and dragged the small
craft out into the open. An examination of the controls showed that
they had not been tampered with, which was a great relief to me as
I had feared that the flier might have been damaged by the great
apes, which are inclined to be both inquisitive and
destructive.</p>

<p>Assured that all was well I assisted Tavia to the ground, and a
moment later we were upon the deck of the flier. The craft
responded satisfactorily, though a little sluggishly, to the
controls, and immediately we were floating gently upward into the
temporary safety of a Barsoomian night.</p>

<p>The flier, which was of a design now almost obsolete in Helium,
was not equipped with a destination control compass, which rendered
it necessary for the pilot to be constantly at the controls. Our
quarters on the narrow deck were exceedingly cramped and I foresaw
a most uncomfortable journey ahead of us. Our safety belts were
snapped to the same deck ring as we lay almost touching one another
upon the hard skeel. The cowl which protected our faces from the
rush of the wind that was generated even by our relatively slow
speed was not sufficiently high to permit us to change our
positions to any considerable degree, though occasionally we found
it a relief to sit up with our backs toward the bow and thus
relieve the tedium of remaining constantly prone in one position.
When I thus rested my cramped muscles, Tavia guided the flier, but
the cold wind of the Barsoomian night always brought me down behind
the cowl in a very few moments.</p>

<p>By mutual consent, we were heading in a south-westerly direction
while we discussed our eventual destination.</p>

<p>I had told Tavia that I wished to go to Jahar and why. She
appeared much interested in the story of the abduction of Sanoma
Tora, and, from her knowledge of Tul Axtar and the customs of
Jahar, she thought it most probable that the missing girl might be
found there, but as to the possibility of rescuing her, that was
another matter over which she shook her head dubiously.</p>

<p>It was obvious to me that Tavia did not desire to return to
Jahar, yet she put no obstacles in the path of my search for this
my great objective; in fact, she gave me Jahar's position and
herself set the nose of the flier upon the right course.</p>

<p>"Will there be any great danger to you in returning to Jahar?" I
asked her.</p>

<p>"The danger will be very great," she said, "but where the master
goes, the slave must follow."</p>

<p>"I am not your master," I said, "and you are not my slave. Let
us consider ourselves rather as comrades in arms."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," she said simply, and then after a pause,
"and if we are to be comrades then let me warn you against going
directly to Jahar. This flier would be recognized immediately. Your
harness would mark you as an alien and you would accomplish nothing
more toward rescuing your Sanoma Tora than to achieve the pits of
Tul Axtar and sooner or later the games in the great arena, where
eventually you must be slain."</p>

<p>"What would you suggest then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Beyond Jahar, to the southwest, lies Tjanath, the city of my
birth. Of all the cities upon Barsoom that is the only one where I
may hope to be received in a friendly manner and as they receive
me, so will they receive you. There you may better prepare to enter
Jahar, which you may only accomplish by disguising yourself as a
Jaharian, for Tul Axtar permits no alien within the confines of his
empire other than those who are brought as prisoners of war and as
slaves. In Tjanath you can obtain the harness and metal of Jahar
and there I can coach you in the customs and manners of the empire
of Tul Axtar so that in a short time you may enter it with some
reasonably slight assurance that you may deceive them as to your
identity. To enter without proper preparation would be fatal."</p>

<p>I saw the wisdom of her counsel and accordingly we altered our
course so as to pass south of Jahar, as we headed straight toward
Tjanath, six thousand haads away.</p>

<p>All the balance of the night we traveled steadily at the rate of
about six hundred haads per zode&mdash;a slow speed when compared
with that of the good one-man flier that I had brought out of
Helium.</p>

<p>As the sun rose the first thing that attracted my particular
attention was the ghastly blue of the flier.</p>

<p>"What a color for a flier!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tavia looked up at me. "There is an excellent reason for it,
though," she said; "a reason that you must fully understand before
you enter Jahar."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; TO THE PITS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BELOW us, in the ever-changing light of the two
moons, stretched the weird landscape of Barsoomian night as our
little craft sorely overloaded, winged slowly away from Xanator
above the low hills that mark the southwestern boundary of the
fierce, green hordes of Torquas. With the coming of the new day we
discussed the advisability of making a landing and waiting until
night before proceeding upon our journey, since we realized that
should we be sighted by an enemy craft we could not possibly hope
to escape.</p>

<p>"Few fliers pass this way," said Tavia, "and if we keep a sharp
lookout I believe that we shall be as safe in the air as on the
ground for although we have passed beyond the limits of Torquas,
there would still be danger from their raiding parties, which often
go far afield."</p>

<p>And so we proceeded slowly in the direction of Tjanath, our eyes
constantly scanning the heavens in all directions.</p>

<p>The monotony of the landscape, combined with our slow rate of
progress, would ordinarily have rendered such a journey unendurable
to me, but to my surprise the time passed quickly, a fact which I
attributed solely to the wit and intelligence of my companion for
there was no gainsaying the fact that Tavia was excellent company.
I think that we must have talked about everything upon Barsoom and
naturally a great deal of the conversation revolved about our own
experiences and personalities, so that long before we reached
Tjanath I felt that I knew Tavia better than I had ever known any
other woman and I was quite sure that I had never confided so
completely in any other person.</p>

<p>Tavia had a way with her that seemed to compel confidences so
that, to my own surprise, I found myself discussing the most
intimate details of my past life, my hopes, ambitions and
aspirations, as well as the fears and doubts which, I presume,
assail the minds of all young men.</p>

<p>When I realized how fully I had unbosomed myself to this little
slave girl, I experienced a distinct shock of embarrassment, but
the sincerity of Tavia's interest dispelled this feeling as did the
realization that she had been almost as equally free with her
confidences as had I.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>We were two nights and a day covering the distance between
Xanator and Tjanath and as the towers and landing stages of our
destination appeared upon the distant horizon toward the end of the
first zode of the second day, I realized that the hours that
stretched away behind us to Xanator were, for some unaccountable
reason, as happy a period as I had ever experienced.</p>

<p>Now it was over. Tjanath lay before us, and with the realization
I experienced a distinct regret that Tjanath did not lie upon the
opposite side of Barsoom.</p>

<p>With the exception of Sanoma Tora, I had never been particularly
keen to be much in the company of women. I do not mean to convey
the impression that I did not like them, for that would not be
true. Their occasional company offered a diversion, which I enjoyed
and of which I took advantage, but that I could be for so many
hours in the exclusive company of a woman I did not love and
thoroughly enjoy every minute of it would have seemed to me quite
impossible; yet such had been the fact and I found myself wondering
if Tavia had shared my enjoyment of the adventure.</p>

<p>"That must be Tjanath," I said nodding in the direction of the
distant city.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"You must be glad that the journey is over," I ventured.</p>

<p>She looked up at me quickly, her brows contracting suddenly in
conjecture. "Perhaps I should be," she replied enigmatically.</p>

<p>"It is your home," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"I have no home," she replied.</p>

<p>"But your friends are here," I insisted.</p>

<p>"I have no friends," she said.</p>

<p>"You forget Hadron of Hastor," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I do not forget that you have been kind to me,
but I remember that I am only an incident in your search for Sanoma
Tora. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be gone and we shall never see
each other again."</p>

<p>I had not thought of that and I found that I did not like to
think about it, and yet I knew that it was true. "You will soon
make friends here," I said.</p>

<p>"I hope so," she replied; "but I have been gone a very long time
and I was so young when I was taken away that I have but the
faintest of memories of my life in Tjanath. Tjanath really means
nothing to me. I could be as happy anywhere else in Barsoom
with&mdash;with a friend."</p>

<p>We were now close above the outer wall of the city and our
conversation was interrupted by the appearance of a flier,
evidently a patrol, bearing down upon us. She was sounding an
alarm&mdash;the shrill screaming of her horn shattering the silence
of the early morning. Almost immediately the warning was taken up
by gongs and shrieking sirens throughout the city. The patrol boat
changed her course and rose swiftly above us, while from landing
stages all about rose scores of fighting planes until we were
entirely surrounded.</p>

<p>I tried to hail the nearer of them, but the infernal din of the
warning signals drowned my voice. Hundreds of guns covered us,
their crews standing ready to hurl destruction upon us.</p>

<p>"Does Tjanath always receive visitors in this hostile manner?" I
inquired of Tavia.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I do not know," she replied. "Had we
approached in a strange ship of war, I might understand it; but why
this little scout flier should attract half the navy of Tjanath
is&mdash;Wait!" she exclaimed suddenly. "The design and color of
our flier mark its origin as Jahar. The people of Tjanath have seen
this color before and they fear it; yet if that is true, why is it
that they have not fired upon us?"</p>

<p>"I do not know why they did not fire upon us at first," I
replied, "but it is obvious why they do not now. Their ships are so
thick about us that they could not fire without endangering their
own craft and men."</p>

<p>"Can't you make them understand that we are friends?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Immediately I made the signs of friendship and of surrender, but
the ships seemed afraid to approach. The alarms had ceased and the
ships were circling silently about us.</p>

<p>Again I hailed a nearby ship. "Do not fire," I shouted; "we are
friends."</p>

<p>"Friends do not come to Tjanath in the blue death ships of
Jahar," replied an officer upon the deck of the ship I had
hailed.</p>

<p>"Let us come alongside," I insisted, "and at least I can prove
to you that we are harmless."</p>

<p>"You will not come alongside my ship," he replied. "If you are
friends you can prove it by doing as I instruct you."</p>

<p>"What are your wishes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Come about and take your flier beyond the city walls. Ground
her at least a haad beyond the east gate and then, with your
companion, walk toward the city."</p>

<p>"Can you promise that we will be well received?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You will be questioned," he replied, "and if you are all right,
you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied, "we will do as you say. Signal your
other ships to make way for us," and then, through the lane that
they opened, we passed slowly back above the walls of Tjanath and
came to the ground about a haad beyond the east gate.</p>

<p>As we approached the city the gates swung open and a detachment
of warriors marched out to meet us. It was evident that they were
very suspicious and fearful of us. The padwar in charge of them
ordered us to halt while there were yet fully a hundred sofads
between us.</p>

<p>"Throw down your weapons," he commanded, "and then come
forward."</p>

<p>"But we are not enemies," I replied. "Do not the people of
Tjanath know how to receive friends?"</p>

<p>"Do as you are told or we will destroy you both," was his only
reply.</p>

<p>I could not refrain a shrug of disgust as I divested myself of
my weapons, while Tavia threw down the short sword that I had
loaned her. Unarmed we advanced toward the warriors, but even then
the padwar was not entirely satisfied, for he searched our harness
carefully before he finally conducted us into the city, keeping us
well surrounded by warriors.</p>

<p>As the east gate of Tjanath closed behind us I realized that we
were prisoners rather than the guests that we had hoped to be, but
Tavia tried to reassure me by insisting that when they had heard
our story we would be set at liberty and accorded the hospitality
that she insisted was our due.</p>

<p>Our guards conducted us to a building that stood upon the
opposite side of the avenue, facing the east gate, and presently we
found ourselves upon a broad landing stage upon the roof of the
building. Here a patrol flier awaited us and our padwar turned us
over to the officer in charge, whose attitude toward us was marked
by ill-concealed hatred and distrust.</p>

<p>As soon as we had been received on board the patrol flier rose
and proceeded toward the center of the city.</p>

<p>Below us lay Tjanath, giving the impression of a city that had
not kept abreast of modern improvements. It was marked by signs of
antiquity; the buildings reflected the architecture of the ancients
and many of them were in a state of disrepair, though much of the
city's ugliness was hidden or softened by the foliage of great
trees and climbing vines, so that on the whole the aspect was more
pleasing than otherwise. Toward the center of the city was a large
plaza, entirely surrounded by imposing public buildings, including
the palace of the Jed. It was upon the roof of one of these
buildings that the flier landed.</p>

<p>Under a strong guard we were conducted into the interior of the
building and after a brief wait were ushered into the presence of
some high official. Evidently he had already been advised of the
circumstances surrounding our arrival at Tjanath, for he seemed to
be expecting us and was familiar with all that had transpired up to
the present moment.</p>

<p>"What do you at Tjanath, Jaharian?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am not from Jahar," I replied. "Look at my metal."</p>

<p>"A warrior may change his metal," he replied, gruffly.</p>

<p>"This man has not changed his metal," said Tavia. "He is not
from Jahar; he is from Hastor, one of the cities of Helium. I am
from Jahar."</p>

<p>The official looked at her in surprise. "So you admit it!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"But first I was from Tjanath," said the girl.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"As a little child I was stolen from Tjanath," replied Tavia.
"All my life since I have been a slave in the palace of Tul Axtar,
Jeddak of Jahar. Only recently I escaped in the same flier upon
which we arrived at Tjanath. Near the dead city of Xanator I landed
and was captured by the green men of Torquas. This warrior, who is
Hadron of Hastor, rescued me from them. Together we came to
Tjanath, expecting a friendly reception."</p>

<p>"Who are your people in Tjanath?" demanded the official.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Tavia; "I was very young. I remember
practically nothing about my life in Tjanath."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Tavia."</p>

<p>The man's interest in her story, which had seemed wholly
perfunctory, seemed suddenly altered and galvanized.</p>

<p>"You know nothing about your parents or your family?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Tavia.</p>

<p>He turned to the padwar who was in charge of our escort. "Hold
them here until I return," he said, and, rising from his desk, he
left the apartment.</p>

<p>"He seemed to recognize your name," I said to Tavia.</p>

<p>"How could he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Possibly he knew your family," I suggested; "at least his
manner suggested that we are going to be given some
consideration."</p>

<p>"I hope so," she said.</p>

<p>"I feel that our troubles are about over, Tavia," I assured her;
"and for your sake I shall be very happy."</p>

<p>"And you, I suppose," she said, "will endeavor to enlist aid in
continuing your search for Sanoma Tora?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," I replied. "Could anything less be expected of
me?"</p>

<p>"No," she admitted in a very low voice.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that something in the demeanor of the
official who had interrogated us had raised my hope for our future,
I was still conscious of a feeling of depression as our
conversation emphasized the near approach of our separation. It
seemed as though I had always known Tavia, for the few days that we
had been thrown together had brought us very close indeed. I knew
that I should miss her sparkling wit, her ready sympathy and the
quiet companionship of her silences, and then the beautiful
features of Sanoma Tora were projected upon memory's screen and,
knowing where my duty lay, I cast vain regrets aside, for love, I
knew, was greater than friendship and I loved Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>After a considerable lapse of time the official re-entered the
apartment. I searched his face to read the first tidings of good
news there, but his expression was inscrutable; however, his first
words, addressed to the padwar, were entirely understandable.</p>

<p>"Confine the woman in the East Tower," he said, "and send the
man to the pits."</p>

<p>That was all. It was like a blow in the face. I looked at Tavia
and saw her wide eyes upon the official. "You mean that we are to
be held as prisoners?" she demanded; "I, a daughter of Tjanath, and
this warrior who came here from a friendly nation seeking your aid
and protection?"</p>

<p>"You will each have a hearing later before the Jed," snapped the
official. "I have spoken. Take them away."</p>

<p>Several of the warriors seized me rather roughly by the arms.
Tavia had turned away from the official and was looking at me.
"Good-bye, Hadron of Hastor!" she said. "It is my fault that you
are here. May my ancestors forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Do not reproach yourself, Tavia," I begged her, "for who might
have foreseen such a stupid reception?"</p>

<p>We were taken from the apartment by different doorways and there
we turned, each for a last look at the other, and in Tavia's eyes
there were tears, and in my heart.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>The pits of Tjanath, to which I was immediately conducted, are
gloomy, but they are not enveloped in impenetrable darkness as are
the pits beneath most Barsoomian cities. Into the dungeon dim light
filtered through the iron grating from the corridors, where ancient
radium bulbs glowed faintly. Yet it was light and I gave thanks for
that, for I have always believed that I should go mad imprisoned in
utter darkness.</p>

<p>I was heavily fettered and unnecessarily so, it seemed to me, as
they chained me to a massive iron ring set deep in the masonry wall
of my dungeon, and then, leaving me, locked also the ponderous iron
grating before the doorway.</p>

<p>As the footfalls of the warriors diminished to nothingness in
the distance I heard the faint sound of something moving nearby me
in my dungeon. What could it be? I strained my eyes into the gloomy
darkness.</p>

<p>Presently, as my eyes became more accustomed to the dim light in
my cell, I saw the figure of what appeared to be a man crouching
against the wall near me. Again I heard a sound as he moved and
this time it was accompanied by the rattle of a chain, and then I
saw a face turn toward me, but I could not distinguish the
features.</p>

<p>"Another guest to share the hospitality of Tjanath," said a
voice that came from the blurred figure beside me. It was a clear
voice&mdash;the voice of a man&mdash;and there was a quality to its
timbre that I liked.</p>

<p>"Do our hosts entertain many such as we?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In this cell there was but one," he replied; "now there are
two. Are you from Tjanath or elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"I am from Hastor, city of the Empire of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of
Helium."</p>

<p>"You are a long way from home," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied; "and you?"</p>

<p>"I am from Jahar," he answered. "My name is Nur An."</p>

<p>"And mine is Hadron," I said. "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner because I am from Jahar," he replied. "What is
your crime?"</p>

<p>"It is that they think I am from Jahar," I told him.</p>

<p>"What made them think that? Do you wear the metal of Jahar?"</p>

<p>"No, I wear the metal of Helium, but I chanced to come to
Tjanath in a Jaharian flier."</p>

<p>He whistled. "That would be hard to explain," he said.</p>

<p>"I found it so," I admitted. "They would not believe a word of
my story, nor of that of my companion."</p>

<p>"You had a companion, then?" he asked. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"It was a woman. She was born in Tjanath, but for long years had
been a slave in Jahar. Perhaps later they will believe her story,
but for the present we are in prison. I heard them order her to the
East Tower, while they sent me here to the prison."</p>

<p>"And here you will stay until you rot, unless you are lucky
enough to be called for the games, or unlucky enough to be
sentenced to The Death."</p>

<p>"What is The Death?" I asked, my curiosity piqued by his
emphasis of the words.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he replied. "The warriors who come here often
speak of it as though it was something quite horrible. Perhaps they
do it to frighten me, but if that is true, then they have had very
little satisfaction, for, whether or not I have been frightened, I
have not let them see it."</p>

<p>"Let us hope for the games, then," I said.</p>

<p>"They are dull and stupid people here in Tjanath," said my
companion. "The warriors have told me that sometimes many years
elapse between games in the arena, but we may hope at least, for
surely it would be better to die there with a good long sword in
one's hand rather than to rot here in the darkness, or die The
Death, whatever it may be."</p>

<p>"You are right," I said. "Let us beseech our ancestors that the
Jed of Tjanath decrees games in the near future."</p>

<p>"So you are from Hastor," he said, musingly, after a moment's
silence. "That is a long way from Tjanath. Pressing must have been
the service that brought you so far afield!"</p>

<p>"I was searching for Jahar," I replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are as well off that you found Tjanath first," he
said, "for, though I am a Jaharian, I cannot boast the hospitality
of Jahar."</p>

<p>"You think I would not have been accorded a cordial welcome
there, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By my first ancestor, no," he exclaimed most emphatically. "Tul
Axtar would have had you in the pits before he asked your name, and
the pits of Jahar are not as light nor as pleasant as these."</p>

<p>"I did not intend that Tul Axtar should know that I was visiting
him," I said.</p>

<p>"You are a spy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "The daughter of the commander of the umak to
which I was attached was abducted by Jaharians, and, I have reason
to believe, by the orders of Tul Axtar himself. To effect her
rescue was the object of my journey."</p>

<p>"You tell this to a Jaharian?" he asked lightly.</p>

<p>"With perfect impunity," I replied. "In the first place, I have
read in your words and your tone that you are no friend to Tul
Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar, and, secondly, there is evidently little
chance that you ever will return to Jahar."</p>

<p>"You are right in both conjectures," he said. "I most assuredly
have no love for Tul Axtar. He is a beast, hated by all decent men.
The cause of my hatred for him so closely parallels your own reason
to hate Tul Axtar that we are indeed bound by a common tie."</p>

<p>"How is that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"All my life I have never felt aught but contempt for Tul Axtar,
Jeddak of Jahar, but this contempt was not transmuted into hatred
until he stole a woman, and it was the stealing of a woman, also,
that directed your venom against him."</p>

<p>"A woman of your family?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My sweetheart, the woman I was to marry," replied Nur An. "I am
a noble. My family is of ancient lineage and great wealth. For
these reasons Tul Axtar knew that he had good cause to fear me, and
urged on by this fear, he confiscated my property and sentenced me
to death, but I have many friends in Jahar and one of these, a
common warrior of the guard, connived at my escape after I had been
imprisoned in the pits.</p>

<p>"I made my way to Tjanath and told my story to Haj Osis, the
Jed, and, laying my sword at his feet, I offered him my services,
but Haj Osis is a suspicious old fool and saw in me only a spy from
Jahar. He ordered me to the pits and here I have lain for a long
time."</p>

<p>"Jahar must be, indeed, an unhappy country," I said, "ruled
over, as she is, by such a man as Tul Axtar. Recently I have heard
much of him, but as yet I have not heard him credited with a single
virtue."</p>

<p>"He has none," said Nur An. "He is a cruel tyrant, rotten with
corruption and vice. If any of the great powers of Barsoom could
have guessed what was in his mind, Jahar would have been reduced
long ago and Tul Axtar destroyed."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For at least two hundred years Tul Axtar has fostered a
magnificent dream, the conquest of all Barsoom. During all this
time he has made manpower his fetish; no eggs might be destroyed,
each woman being compelled to preserve all that she laid.* An army
of officials and inspectors took a record of the production of each
female. Those that had the greatest number of males were rewarded;
the unproductive were destroyed. When it was discovered that
marriage tended to reduce the productivity of the females of Jahar,
marriage among any classes beneath the nobility was proscribed by
imperial edict.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Note: Martians are oviparous.]</p>

<p>"The result has been an appalling increase in population until
many of the provinces of Jahar cannot support the incalculable
numbers that swarm like ants in a hill. The richest agricultural
land upon Barsoom could not support such numbers; every natural
resource has been exhausted; millions are starving, and in large
districts cannibalism is prevalent.</p>

<p>"During all this time Tul Axtar's officers have been training
the males for war. From earliest consciousness the thought of war
has been implanted within their minds. To war and to war alone do
they look for relief from the hideous conditions which oppress them
until today countless millions are clamoring for war, realizing
that victory means loot, and that loot means food and riches.
Already Tul Axtar commands an army of such vast proportions that
the fate of Barsoom might readily lie in the palm of his hand were
it not for but a single obstacle."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tul Axtar is a coward," replied Nur An. "Having fulfilled his
dream of manpower, he is afraid to use it lest by some accident of
fate his military plans should fail and his troops meet defeat.
Therefore, he has waited while he urged on the scientists of Jahar
to produce some weapon that would be so far superior in its
destructive power to anything possessed by any other nation of
Barsoom that his armies would be invincible.</p>

<p>"For years the best minds of Jahar labored with the problem
until at last one of our most eminent scientists, an old man named
Phor Tak, developed a rifle of amazing properties.</p>

<p>"The success of Phor Tak aroused the jealousies of other
scientists, and though the old man had given Tul Axtar what he
sought, yet the tyrant showed no gratitude, and Phor Tak was
subjected to such indignities and oppressions that eventually he
fled from Jahar.</p>

<p>"That, however, is of no import; all that Phor Tak could do for
Tul Axtar he had done, and with the new rifle in his possession,
the Jeddak was glad to be rid of the old scientist."</p>

<p>Naturally I was much interested in the rifle which Nur An had
mentioned and I hoped that he would go into a further and more
detailed description of it, but I dared not suggest that for fear
that the natural loyalty which every man feels for the country of
his birth might restrain him from divulging her military secrets to
a stranger. I was to learn, however, that those lofty sentiments of
patriotism, which are a part of every man of Helium, were induced
as much by the love and respect in which we held our great jeddaks
as by our natural attachment to the land of our birth; while, upon
the other hand, the Jaharians looked only with contempt and
loathing upon the head of their state and feeling no loyalty for
him, who was in effect the state, they looked upon patriotism as
nothing more than an empty catchword, which an unworthy master had
used to his own end until it had become meaningless, and so, while
at the moment I was surprised, I later came to understand why it
was that Nur An voluntarily explained in detail to me all that he
knew about the strange new weapon of Jahar and the means of defense
against it.</p>

<p>"This new rifle," he continued after a moment's silence, "would
render all the other armies and navies of Barsoom impotent before
us. It projects an invisible ray, the vibrations of which effect
such a change in the constitution of metals as to cause them to
disintegrate. I am not a scientist; I do not fully understand the
exact explanation of the phenomenon, but from what I was able to
gather while the new weapon was being discussed in Jahar I am under
the impression that these rays change the polarity of the protons
in metallic substances, releasing the whole mass as free electrons.
I have also heard the theory expounded that Phor Tak, in his
investigation, discovered that the fundamental principle underlying
time, matter and space are identical, and that what the rays
projected from his rifle really accomplish is to translate any mass
of metal upon which it is directed into the most elementary
constituents of space.</p>

<p>"But be that as it may, Tul Axtar had the manpower and the
weapon, yet still he hesitated. He was afraid and he sought for
some excuse further to delay the war of conquest and loot which his
millions of subjects now demanded, and to this end he hit upon the
plan of insisting upon some medium of defense against this new
rifle, basing his demands upon the possibility that some other
power might also have discovered a similar weapon or would
eventually, by the use of spies or informers, learn the secret from
Jahar. Probably greatly to his surprise and unquestionably to his
embarrassment, a man who had been an assistant in Phor Tak's
laboratory presently developed a substance which dissipated the
rays of the new weapon, rendering them harmless. With this
substance, which is of a bluish color, the metal portions of the
ships, weapons and harness of Jahar are now painted.</p>

<p>"But yet again Tul Axtar postponed his war, insisting upon the
production of an enormous quantity of the new rifles and a mighty
fleet of warships upon which to mount them. Then, he says, he will
sail forth and conquer all Barsoom."</p>

<p>The destruction of the patrol boat above Helium the night of the
abduction of Sanoma Tora was now quite clear to me, and when Nur An
told me later that Tul Axtar had sent experimental fliers to attack
Tjanath, I understood why it was that the blue flier in which Tavia
and I had arrived had caused such consternation, but the thought
that upset my mind almost to the exclusion of the plight of Sanoma
Tora was that somewhere in the thin air of dying Barsoom a great
Heliumetic fleet was moving to attack Jahar, or at least that was
what I supposed since I had no reason to doubt that the message
that I had given to the major domo of Tor Hatan's palace had not
been delivered to the Warlord. To lie here enchained in the pits of
Tjanath, while the great fleet of Helium sped to its destruction,
filled me with horror. With my own eyes had I seen the effects of
this terrible new weapon and I knew that it was no idle dream upon
the part of Nur An when he had stated that with it Tul Axtar could
conquer a world; but there was a defense against it. If I could but
regain my freedom, I might not only warn the ships of Helium and
save them from inevitable doom, but also in connection with my
quest for Sanoma Tora in the city of Jahar, I might discover the
secret of the defense against the weapon which the Jaharians had
evolved.</p>

<p>Freedom! Before it had only seemed the most desirable thing in
the world; now it had become imperative.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; SENTENCED TO DIE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS not long in the pits of Tjanath before
warriors came, and, removing my fetters, led me from my dungeon.
There were only two of them and I could not but note their
carelessness and the laxness of their discipline as they escorted
me to an upper level of the palace, but at the time I thought it
meant only that the attitude of the officials had altered and that
I was to be free.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about the palace of the Jed of
Tjanath. It was a poor place by comparison with the palaces of some
of the great nobles of Helium, yet never before, I imagined, had I
challenged with greater interest every detail of architecture,
every corridor and doorway, or the manners, harness and decorations
of the people that passed us, for, though in my heart was the hope
that I was about to be free, yet I considered this place my prison
and these people my jailers, and, as my one object in life was to
escape, I was determined to let no detail elude my eye that might
possibly in any way aid me if the time should come when I must make
a break for liberty.</p>

<p>It was such thoughts that were uppermost in my mind as I was
ushered through wide portals into the presence of a bejeweled
warrior. As my eyes first alighted upon him I knew at once that I
was in the presence of Haj Osis, Jed of Tjanath.</p>

<p>As my guard halted me before him, the Jed scrutinized me
intently with that air of suspicion which is his most marked
characteristic.</p>

<p>"Your name and country?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am Hadron of Hastor, padwar in the navy of Helium," I
replied.</p>

<p>"You are from Jahar," he accused. "You came here from Jahar with
a woman of Jahar in a flier of Jahar. Can you deny it?"</p>

<p>I told Haj Osis in detail everything that had led up to my
arrival at Tjanath. I told him Tavia's story as well, and I must at
least credit him with listening to me in patience, though I was
constantly impressed by a feeling that my appeal was being directed
at a mind already so prejudiced against me that nothing that I
might say could alter its convictions.</p>

<p>The chiefs and courtiers that surrounded the Jed evidenced open
skepticism in their manner until I became convinced that fear of
Tul Axtar so obsessed them that they were unable to consider
intelligently any matter connected with the activities of the
Jeddak of Jahar. Terror made them suspicious and suspicion sees
everything through distorted lenses.</p>

<p>When I had finished my story, Haj Osis ordered me removed from
the room and I was held in a small ante-chamber for some time
while, I imagined, he discussed my case with his advisors.</p>

<p>When I was again ushered into his presence I felt that the whole
atmosphere of the chamber was charged with antagonism, as for the
second time I was halted before the dais upon which the Jed sat in
his carved throne-chair.</p>

<p>"The laws of Tjanath are just," proclaimed Haj Osis, glaring at
me, "and the Jed of Tjanath is merciful. The enemies of Tjanath
shall receive justice, but they may not expect mercy. You, who call
yourself Hadron of Hastor, have been adjudged a spy of our most
malignant enemy, Tul Axtar of Jahar, and as such I, Haj Osis, Jed
of Tjanath, sentence you to die The Death. I have spoken." With an
imperious gesture he signaled the guards to remove me.</p>

<p>There was no appeal. My doom was sealed, and in silence I turned
and left the chamber, escorted by a guard of warriors, but for the
honor of Helium I may say that my step was firm and my chin
high.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>On my return to the pits I questioned the padwar in charge of my
escort relative to Tavia, but if the fellow knew aught of her, he
refused to divulge it to me and presently I found myself again
fettered in the gloomy dungeon by the side of Nur An of Jahar.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Death," I replied.</p>

<p>He extended a manacled hand through the darkness and placed it
upon one of mine. "I am sorry, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>"Man has but one life," I replied; "if he is permitted to give
it in a good cause, he should not complain."</p>

<p>"You die for a woman," he said.</p>

<p>"I die for a woman of Helium," I corrected.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall die together," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"While you were gone a messenger came from the major domo of the
palace advising me to make peace with my ancestors as I should die
The Death in a short time."</p>

<p>"I wonder what The Death is like," I said.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Nur An, "but from the awe-hushed tones
in which they mention it, I imagine that it must be very
terrible."</p>

<p>"Torture, do you imagine?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he replied.</p>

<p>"They will find that the men of Helium who know so well how to
live, know also how to die," I said.</p>

<p>"I shall hope to render a good account of myself also," said Nur
An. "I shall not give them the satisfaction of knowing that I
suffer. Still, I wish I might know beforehand what it is like that
I might better be prepared to meet it."</p>

<p>"Let us not depress our thoughts by dwelling upon it," I
suggested. "Let us rather take the part of men and consider only
plans for thwarting our enemies and effecting our escape."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that is hopeless," he said.</p>

<p>"I may answer that," I said, "in the famous words of John
Carter: 'I still live!'"</p>

<p>"The blind philosophy of absolute courage," he said admiringly,
"but yet futile."</p>

<p>"It served him well many a time," I insisted, "for it gave him
the will to attempt the impossible and to succeed. We still live,
Nur An; do not forget that&mdash;we still live!"</p>

<p>"Make the best of it while you can," said a gruff voice from the
corridor, "for it will not long be true."</p>

<p>The speaker entered our dungeon&mdash;a warrior of the guard,
and with him was a single companion. I wondered how much of our
conversation they had overheard, but I was soon reassured, for the
very next words of the warrior that had first spoken revealed the
fact that they had heard nothing but my assertion that we still
lived.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by that," he asked, "'remember, Nur An, we
still live?'"</p>

<p>I pretended not to hear his question and he did not repeat it,
but came directly to me and unlocked my fetters. As he turned to
unlock those which held Nur An, he turned his back to me and I
could not but note his inexcusable carelessness. His companion
lolled at the doorway while the first warrior bent over the padlock
that held the fetters of Nur An.</p>

<p>My ancestors were kind to me; little had I expected such an
opportunity as this, yet I waited&mdash;like a great banth ready to
spring I waited until he should have released Nur An, and then, as
the fetters fell away from my companion, I flung myself upon the
back of the warrior. He sprawled forward upon his face on the stone
flagging, falling heavily beneath my weight, and as he did so I
snatched his dagger from its sheath and plunged it between his
shoulder blades. With a single cry he died, but I had no fear that
the echo of that cry would carry upward out of the gloomy pits of
Tjanath to warn his fellows upon the level above.</p>

<p>But the fellow's companion had seen and heard and with a bound
he was across the dungeon, his long sword ready in his hand, and
now I was to see the mettle of which Nur An was made.</p>

<p>The affair had occurred so quickly, like a bolt of lightning out
of a clear sky, that any man might have been excused had he been
momentarily stunned into inactivity by the momentousness of my act,
but Nur An was guilty of no fatal delay. As though we had planned
the thing together it seemed that he leaped forward the instant
that I sprang for the warrior and ran to meet his companion.
Barehanded, he faced the long sword of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The gloom of the dungeon reduced the advantage of the armed man.
He saw a figure leaping to meet his attack and in the excitement of
the moment and in the dark of the cell, he did not know that Nur An
was unarmed. He hesitated, paused and stepped back to receive the
impetuous attack coming out of the darkness, and in that instant I
had whipped the long sword of the fallen warrior from its scabbard
and was charging the fellow at a slightly different angle from Nur
An.</p>

<p>An instant later we were engaged and I found the fellow no mean
swordsman; yet from the instant that our blades crossed I knew that
I was his master and he must soon have realized it, too, for he
fell back, fully on the defensive, evidently bent upon escaping to
the corridor. This, however, I was determined not to permit and so
I pressed him so closely that he dared not turn to run; nor did he
call for help, and this, I guess, was because he realized the
futility of so doing.</p>

<p>With the desperation of caged animals Nur An and I were fighting
for our lives. There could be no question here of the scrupulous
observance of the niceties of combat. It was his life or ours.
Realizing this, Nur An snatched the short sword from the corpse of
the fallen warrior and an instant later the second man was lying in
a pool of his own blood.</p>

<p>"And now what?" asked Nur An.</p>

<p>"Are you familiar with the palace?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then we must depend upon what little I was able to glean from
my observation of it," I said. "Let us get into the harnesses of
these two men at once. Perhaps they will offer a sufficient
disguise to permit us to reach one of the upper levels at least,
for without an intimate knowledge of the pits it is useless for us
to try to seek escape below ground."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, and a few moments later we emerged
into the corridors, to all intents and purposes, two warriors of
the guard of Haj Osis, Jed of Tjanath. Believing that up to a
certain point boldness of demeanor would be our best safeguard
against detection, I led the way toward the ground level of the
palace without attempting in any way to resort to stealth or
secrecy.</p>

<p>"There are many warriors at the main entrance of the palace," I
told Nur An, "and without knowing something of the regulations
governing the coming and going of the inmates of the building, it
would be suicidal to attempt to reach the avenue beyond the palace
by that route."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The ground level of the palace is a busy place, people are
coming and going constantly through the corridors. Doubtless some
of the upper levels are less frequented. Let us therefore seek a
hiding place higher up and from the vantage point of some balcony
we may be able to work out a feasible plan of escape."</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "Lead on!"</p>

<p>Ascending the winding ramp from the lower pits, we passed two
levels before we reached the ground level of the palace, without
meeting a single person, but the instant that we emerged upon the
ground level we saw people everywhere; Officers, courtiers,
warriors, slaves and merchants moved to and fro upon their various
duties or in pursuit of the business that had brought them to the
palace, but their very numbers proved a safeguard for us.</p>

<p>Upon the side of the corridor opposite from the point at which
we entered it lay an arched entrance to another ramp running
upward. Without an instant's hesitation I crossed through the
throng of people, and, with Nur An at my side, passed beneath the
arch and entered the ascending ramp.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we started upward when we met a young officer
descending. He accorded us scarcely a glance as we passed and I
breathed more easily as I realized that our disguises did, in fact,
disguise us.</p>

<p>There were fewer people on the second level of the palace, but
yet far too many to suit me and so we continued on upward to the
third level, the corridors of which we found almost deserted.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the ramp lay the intersection of two main
corridors. Here we hesitated for an instant to reconnoiter. There
were people approaching from both directions along the corridor
into which we had emerged, but in one direction the transverse
corridor seemed deserted and we quickly entered it. It was a very
long corridor, apparently extending the full length of the palace.
It was flanked at intervals upon both sides by doorways, the doors
to some of which were open, while others were closed or ajar.
Through some of the open doorways we saw people, while the
apartments revealed through others appeared vacant. The location of
these we noted carefully as we moved slowly along, carefully
observing every detail that might later prove of value to us.</p>

<p>We had traversed about two-thirds of this long corridor when a
man stepped into it from a doorway a couple of hundred feet ahead
of us. He was an officer, apparently a padwar of the guard. He
halted in the middle of the corridor as a file of warriors emerged
from the same doorway, and, forming in a column of twos, marched in
our direction, the officer bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Here was a test for our disguises that I did not care to risk.
There was an open doorway at our left; beyond it I could see no
one. "Come!" I said to Nur An, and without accelerating our speed
we walked nonchalantly into the chamber, and as Nur An crossed the
threshold, I closed the door behind him and as I did so I saw a
young woman standing at the opposite side of the apartment looking
squarely at us.</p>

<p>"What do you here, warriors?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was an embarrassing situation. In the corridor
without I could hear the clank of the accoutrements of the
approaching warriors and I knew that the girl must hear it, too. If
I did aught to arouse her suspicion, she had but to call for help,
and how might I allay her suspicion when I had not the faintest
conception of what might pass for a valid excuse for the presence
of two warriors in this particular apartment, which for all I knew,
might be the apartment of a princess of the royal house, to enter
which without permission might easily mean death to a common
warrior. I thought quickly, or perhaps I did not think at all;
often we act rightly upon impulse and then credit the result to
super-intelligence.</p>

<p>"We have come for the girl," I stated brusquely. "Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"What girl?" demanded the young woman in surprise.</p>

<p>"The prisoner, of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"The prisoner?" she looked more puzzled than before.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Nur An, "the prisoner. Where is she?" and I
almost smiled for I knew that Nur An had not the faintest idea of
what was in my mind.</p>

<p>"There is no prisoner here," said the young woman. "These are
the apartments of the infant son of Haj Osis."</p>

<p>"The fool misdirected us," I said. "We are sorry that we
intruded. We were sent to fetch the girl, Tavia, who is a prisoner
in the palace."</p>

<p>It was only a guess. I did not know that Tavia was a prisoner,
but after the treatment that had been accorded me I surmised as
much.</p>

<p>"She is not here," said the young woman, "and as for you, you
had better leave these apartments at once for if you are discovered
here it will go ill with you."</p>

<p>Nur An, who was standing beside me, had been looking at the
young woman intently. He stepped forward now, closer to her.</p>

<p>"By my first ancestor," he exclaimed in a low voice, "it is
Phao!"</p>

<p>The girl stepped back, her eyes wide with surprise and then
slowly recognition dawned within them. "Nur An!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Nur An came close to the girl and took her hand in his. "All
these years, Phao, I have thought that you were dead," he said.
"When the ship returned the captain reported that you and a number
of others were killed."</p>

<p>"He lied," said the girl. "He sold us into slavery here in
Tjanath; but you, Nur An, what are you doing here in the harness of
Tjanath?"</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," replied my companion, "as is this warrior
also. We have been confined in the pits beneath the palace and
today we were to have died The Death, but we killed the two
warriors who were sent to fetch us and now we are trying to find
our way out of the palace."</p>

<p>"Then you are not looking for the girl, Tavia?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "we are looking for her, too. She was made a
prisoner at the same time that I was."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you," said Phao; "perhaps," she added
wistfully, "we may all escape together."</p>

<p>"I shall not escape without you, Phao," said Nur An.</p>

<p>"My ancestors have been good to me at last," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Where is Tavia?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She is in the East Tower," replied Phao.</p>

<p>"Can you lead us there, or tell us how we may reach it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It would do no good to lead you to it," she replied, "as the
door is locked and guards stand before it. But there is another
way."</p>

<p>"And that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I know where the keys are," she said, "and I know other things
that will prove helpful."</p>

<p>"May our ancestors protect and reward you, Phao," I said. "And
now tell me where I may find the keys."</p>

<p>"I shall have to lead you to the place myself," she replied,
"but we shall stand a better chance to succeed if there are not too
many of us. I, therefore, suggest that Nur An remain here. I shall
place him in hiding where he will not be found. I will then lead
you to the prisoner, and, if possible, we will make our way back to
this apartment. I am in charge here. Only at regular hours, twice a
day, night and morning, does any other visit the apartment of the
little prince. Here I can hide you and feed you for a long time and
perhaps eventually we shall be able to evolve some feasible plan
for escape."</p>

<p>"We are in your hands, Phao," said Nur An. "If there is to be
fighting, though, I should like to accompany Hadron."</p>

<p>"If we succeed there will be no fighting," replied the girl. She
stepped quickly across the room to a door, which she opened,
revealing a large closet. "Here, Nur An," she said, "is where you
must remain until we return. There is no reason why anyone should
open this door, and in so far as I know, it never has been opened
since I have occupied these quarters, except by me."</p>

<p>"I do not like the idea of hiding," said Nur An with a grimace,
"but&mdash;I have had to do many things recently that I did not
like," and without more words he crossed the apartment and entered
the closet. Their eyes met for an instant before Phao closed the
door, and I read in the depth of both that which made me wonder,
remembering as I did the story that Nur An had told me of the other
woman whom Tul Axtar had stolen from him. But such matters were no
concern of mine, nor had they any bearing upon the business at
hand.</p>

<p>"Here is my plan, warrior," said Phao as she returned to my
side. "When you entered this apartment you came saying that you
were looking for the prisoner, Tavia. Although she was not here, I
believed you. We will go, therefore, to Yo Seno, the keeper of the
keys, and you will tell him the same story that you have been sent
to fetch the prisoner, Tavia. If Yo Seno believes you, all will be
well, for he will go himself and release the prisoner, turning her
over to you."</p>

<p>"And if he does not believe me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is a beast," she said, "who is better dead than alive.
Therefore you will know what to do."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said. "Lead the way."</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>The office of Yo Seno, the keeper of the keys, was upon the
fourth level of the palace, almost directly above the quarters of
the infant prince. At the doorway Phao halted, and drawing my ear
down to her lips, whispered her final instructions. "I shall enter
first," she said, "upon some trivial errand. A moment later you may
enter, but pay no attention to me. It must not appear that we have
come together."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said, and walked a few paces along the
corridor so that I should not be in sight when the door opened. She
told me afterward that she asked Yo Seno to have a new key made for
one of the numerous doors in the apartment of the little
prince.</p>

<p>I waited but a moment, and then I, too, entered the apartment.
It was a gloomy room without windows. Upon its walls hung keys of
every imaginable size and shape. Behind a large desk sat a
coarse-looking man, who looked up quickly and scowled at the
interruption as I entered.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have come for the woman, Tavia," I said, "the prisoner from
Jahar."</p>

<p>"Who sent you? What do you want of her?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have orders to bring her to Haj Osis," I replied.</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously. "You bring a written order?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not," I replied, "it is not necessary. She is not to
be taken out of the palace; merely from one apartment to
another."</p>

<p>"I must have a written order," he snapped.</p>

<p>"Haj Osis will not be pleased," I said, "when he learns that you
have refused to obey his command."</p>

<p>"I am not refusing," said Yo Seno. "Do not dare to say that I
refuse. I cannot turn a prisoner over without a written order. Show
me your authority and I will give you the keys."</p>

<p>I saw that the plan had failed; other measures must be taken. I
whipped out my long sword. "Here is my authority!" I exclaimed,
leaping toward him.</p>

<p>With an oath he drew his own sword, but instead of facing me
with it he stepped quickly back, the desk still between us and,
turning, struck a copper gong heavily with the flat of his
blade.</p>

<p>As I rushed toward him I heard the sound of hurrying feet and
the clank of metal from an adjoining room. Yo Seno, still backing
away, sneered sardonically, and then the lights went out and the
windowless room was plunged into darkness. Soft fingers grasped my
left hand and a low voice whispered in my ear, "Come with me."</p>

<p>Quickly I was drawn to one side and through a narrow aperture
just as a door upon the opposite side of the chamber was flung
open, revealing the forms of half a dozen warriors silhouetted
against the light from the room behind them. Then the door closed
directly in front of my face and I was again in utter darkness, but
Phao's fingers still grasped my hand.</p>

<p>"Silence!" a soft voice whispered.</p>

<p>From beyond the panels I heard angry and excited voices. Above
the others one voice rose in tones of authority. "What is wrong
here?"</p>

<p>There were muttered exclamations and curses as men bumped
against pieces of furniture and ran into one another.</p>

<p>"Give us a light," cried a voice, and a moment later, "That is
better."</p>

<p>"Where is Yo Seno? Oh, there you are, you fat rascal. What is
amiss?"</p>

<p>"By Issus! he is gone." The voice was that of Yo Seno.</p>

<p>"Who is gone?" demanded the other voice. "Why did you summon
us?"</p>

<p>"I was attacked by a warrior," explained Yo Seno, "who came
demanding the key to the apartment where Haj Osis keeps the
daughter of &mdash;&mdash;" I could not hear the rest of the
sentence.</p>

<p>"Well, where is the man?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"He is gone&mdash;and the key, too. The key is gone," Yo Seno's
voice rose almost to a wail.</p>

<p>"Quick, then, to the apartment where the girl is kept," cried
the first speaker, doubtless the officer of the guard, and almost
at once I heard them hasten from the apartment.</p>

<p>The girl at my side moved a little and I heard a low laugh.
"They will not find the key," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because I have it," she replied.</p>

<p>"Little good it will do us," I said ruefully. "They will keep
the door well guarded now and we cannot use the key."</p>

<p>Phao laughed again. "We do not need the key," she said. "I took
it to throw them off the track. They will watch the door while we
enter elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," I said.</p>

<p>"This corridor leads between the partitions to the room where
the prisoner is kept. I know that because, when I was a prisoner in
that room, Yo Seno came thus to visit me. He is a beast. I hope he
has not visited this girl&mdash;I hope it for your sake, if you
love her."</p>

<p>"I do not love her," I said. "She is only a friend." But I
scarcely knew what I was saying, the words seemed to come
mechanically for I was in the grip of such an emotion as I never
before had experienced or endured. It had seized me the instant
that Phao had suggested that Yo Seno might have visited Tavia
through this secret corridor. I experienced a sensation that was
almost akin to a convulsion&mdash;a sensation that left me a
changed man. Before, I could have killed Yo Seno with my sword and
been glad; now I wanted to tear him to pieces; I wanted to mutilate
him and make him suffer. Never before in my life had I experienced
such a bestial desire. It was hideous, and yet I gloated in its
possession.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" exclaimed Phao. "I thought I felt you
tremble then."</p>

<p>"I trembled," I said.</p>

<p>"For what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"For Yo Seno," I replied, "but let us hasten. If this corridor
leads to the apartment where Tavia is in prison, I cannot reach her
to soon, for when Haj Osis learns that the key has been stolen he
will have her removed to another prison."</p>

<p>"He will not learn it if Yo Seno and the padwar of the guard can
prevent," said Phao, "for if this reached the ears of Haj Osis it
might easily cost them both their lives. They will wait for you to
come that they may kill you and get the key, but they will wait
outside the prison door and you will not come that way."</p>

<p>As she spoke she started to walk along the narrow, dark
corridor, leading me by the hand behind her. It was slow work for
Phao had to grope her way slowly because the corridor turned
sharply at right angles as it followed the partitions of the
apartments between which it passed, and there were numerous
stairways that led up over doorways and finally a ladder to the
level above.</p>

<p>Presently she halted. "We are there," she whispered, "but we
must listen first to make sure that no one has entered the
apartment with the prisoner."</p>

<p>I could see absolutely nothing in the darkness, and how Phao
knew that she had reached her destination, I could not guess.</p>

<p>"It is all right," she said presently, and simultaneously she
pushed a wooden panel ajar and in the opening I saw a portion of
the interior of a circular apartment with narrow windows heavily
barred. Opposite the opening, upon a pile of sleeping silks and
furs, I saw a woman reclining. Only a bare shoulder, a tiny ear and
a head of tousled hair were visible. At the first glance I knew
that they were Tavia's.</p>

<p>As we stepped into the apartment Phao closed the panel behind
us. Attracted by the sound of our entrance, quietly executed though
it was, Tavia sat up and looked at us and then, as she recognized
me, sprang to her feet. Her eyes were wide with surprise and there
was an exclamation upon her lips, which I silenced by a warning
forefinger placed against my own. I crossed the apartment toward
her, and she came to meet me, almost running. As I looked into her
eyes I saw an expression there that I have never seen in the eyes
of any other woman&mdash;at least not for me&mdash;and if I had
ever doubted Tavia's friendship, such a doubt would have vanished
in that instant, but I had not doubted it and I was only surprised
now to realize the depth of it. Had Sanoma Tora ever looked at me
like that I should have read love in the expression, but I had
never spoken of love to Tavia and so I knew that it was only
friendship that she felt. I had always been too much engrossed in
my profession to make any close friendships so that I had never
realized until that moment what a wonderful thing friendship might
be.</p>

<p>As we met in the center of the room her eyes, moist with tears
were upturned to mine. "Hadron," she whispered, her voice husky
with emotion, and then I put my arm about her slender shoulders and
drew her to me and something that was quite beyond my volition
impelled me to kiss her upon the forehead. Instantly she disengaged
herself and I feared that she had misunderstood that impulsive kiss
of friendship, but her next words reassured me.</p>

<p>"I thought never to see you again, Hadron of Hastor," she said.
"I feared that they had killed you. How comes it that you are here
and in the metal of a warrior of Tjanath?"</p>

<p>I told her briefly of what had occurred to me since we had been
separated and of how I had temporarily, at least, escaped The
Death. She asked me what The Death was, but I could not tell
her.</p>

<p>"It is very horrible," said Phao.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the girl, "only that it is horrible.
There is a deep pit, some say a bottomless pit, beneath the lower
pits of the palace; horrible noises&mdash;groans and moans arise
perpetually from it and into this pit those that are to die The
Death are cast, but in such a way that the fall will not kill them.
They must reach the bottom alive to endure all the horrors of The
Death that await them there. That the torture is almost
interminable is evidenced by the fact that the moans and groans of
the victims never cease, no matter how long a period may have
elapsed between executions."</p>

<p>"And you have escaped it," exclaimed Tavia. "My prayers have
been answered. For days and nights have I been praying to my
ancestors that you might be spared. Now if you can but escape this
hateful place. Have you a plan?"</p>

<p>"We have a plan that with the help of Phao here may prove
successful. Nur An, of whom I told you, is hiding in a closet in
one of the apartments of the little prince. We shall return to that
apartment at the first opportunity and here Phao will hide all
three of us until some opportunity for escape presents itself."</p>

<p>"And we should lose no more time in returning," said Phao.
"Come, let us go at once."</p>

<p>As we turned toward the panel through which we had entered I saw
that it was ajar, though I was confident that Phao had closed it
after us when we entered and simultaneously I could have sworn that
I saw an eye glued to the narrow crack, as though someone watched
us from the dark interior of the secret corridor.</p>

<p>In a single bound I was across the room and had drawn the panel
aside. My sword was ready in my hand, but there was no one in the
corridor beyond.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE DEATH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITH Phao in the lead and Tavia between us, we
traversed the dark corridor back toward the apartment of Yo Seno.
When we reached the panel marking the end of our journey, Phao
halted and together we listened intently for any sound that might
evidence the presence of an occupant in the room beyond. All was
silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Phao, "that it will be safer if you and Tavia
remain here until night. I shall return to my apartment and go
about my duties in the usual manner and after the palace has
quieted down, these levels will be almost deserted; then I can come
and get you with far less danger of detection than were I to take
you to the apartment now."</p>

<p>We agreed that her plan was a good one, and bidding us a
temporary farewell, she opened the panel sufficiently to permit her
to survey the apartment beyond. It was quite empty. She stepped
from the corridor, closing the panel behind her, and once again
Tavia and I were plunged into darkness.</p>

<p>The long hours of our wait in the darkness of the corridor
should have seemed interminable, but they did not. We made
ourselves as comfortable as possible upon the floor, our backs
against one of the walls, and, leaning close together so that we
might converse in low whispers, we found more entertainment than I
should have guessed possible, both in our conversation and in the
long silences that broke it, so that it really did not seem a long
time at all before the panel was swung open and we saw Phao in the
subdued light of the apartment beyond. She motioned us to follow
her, and, in silence, we obeyed. The corridor beyond the chamber of
Yo Seno was deserted, as also was the ramp leading to the level
below and the corridor upon which it opened. Fortune seemed to
favor us at every step and there was a prayer of thanksgiving upon
my lips as Phao pushed open the door leading into the apartment of
the prince and motioned us to enter.</p>

<p>But at the same instant my heart sank within me, for, as I
entered the apartment with Tavia, I saw warriors standing upon
either side of the room awaiting us. With an exclamation of warning
I drew Tavia behind me and backed quickly toward the door, but as I
did so I heard a rush of feet and the clank of accoutrements in the
corridor behind me, and, casting a quick glance over my shoulder, I
saw other warriors running from the doorway of an apartment upon
the opposite side of the corridor.</p>

<p>We were surrounded. We were lost, and my first thought was that
Phao had betrayed us, leading us into this trap from which there
could be no escape. They hustled us back into the room and
surrounded us, and for the first time I saw Yo Seno. He stood
there, a sneering grin upon his face, and but for the fact that
Tavia had assured me that he had not harmed her I should have
leaped upon him there, though a dozen swords had been at my vitals
the next instant.</p>

<p>"So!" sneered Yo Seno. "You thought to fool me, did you? Well, I
am not so easily fooled. I guessed the truth and I followed you
through the corridor and overheard all your plans as you discussed
them with the woman, Tavia. We have you all now," and turning to
one of the warriors, he motioned to the closet upon the opposite
side of the chamber. "Fetch the other," he commanded.</p>

<p>The fellow crossed to the door and, opening it, revealed Nur An
lying bound and gagged upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Cut his bonds and remove the gag," ordered Yo Seno. "It is too
late now for him to thwart my plans by giving the others a
warning."</p>

<p>Nur An came toward us, with a firm step, his head high and a
glance of haughty contempt for our captors.</p>

<p>The four of us stood facing Yo Seno, the sneer upon whose face
had been replaced by a glare of hatred.</p>

<p>"You have been sentenced to die The Death," he said. "It is the
death for spies. No more terrible punishment can be inflicted.
Could there be, it would be meted to you two," as he looked first
at me and then at Nur An, "that you might suffer more for the
murder of our two comrades."</p>

<p>So they had found the warriors we had dispatched. Well, what of
it? Evidently it had not rendered our position any worse than it
had been before. We were to die The Death and that was the worst
that they could accord us.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say?" demanded Yo Seno.</p>

<p>"We still live" I exclaimed, and laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Before long you will be beseeching your first ancestors for
death," hissed the keeper of the keys, "but you will not have death
too soon, and remember that no one knows how long it takes to die
The Death. We cannot add to your physical suffering, but for the
torment of your mind let me remind you that we are sending you to
The Death without letting you know what the fate of your
accomplices will be," and he nodded toward Tavia and Phao.</p>

<p>That was a nice point, well chosen. He could not have hit upon
any means more certain to inflict acute torture upon me than this,
but I would not give him the satisfaction of witnessing my true
emotion, and so, once again, I laughed in his face. His patience
had about reached the limit of its endurance, for he turned
abruptly to a padwar of the guard and ordered him to remove us at
once.</p>

<p>As we were hustled from the room, Nur An called a brave good-bye
to Phao.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Tavia!" I cried, "and remember that we still
live."</p>

<p>"We still live, Hadron of Hastor!" she called back. "We still
live!" and then she was swept from my view as we were pushed along
down the corridor.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>Down ramp after ramp we were conducted to the uttermost depths
of the palace pits and then into a great chamber where I saw Haj
Osis sitting upon a throne, surrounded again by his chiefs and his
courtiers as he had been upon the occasion that he had interviewed
me. Opposite the Jed, and in the middle of the chamber, hung a
great iron cage, suspended from a heavy block set in the ceiling.
Into this cage we were roughly pushed; the door was closed and
secured with a large lock. I wondered what it was all about and
what this had to do with The Death, and while I wondered a dozen
men pushed a huge trap door from beneath the cage. A rush of cold,
clammy air enveloped us and I experienced a chill that seemed to
enter my marrow, as though I lay in the cold arms of death. Hollow
moans and groans came faintly to my ears and I knew that we were
above the pits where The Death lay.</p>

<p>No word was spoken within the chamber, but at a signal from Haj
Osis strong men lowered the cage slowly into the aperture beneath
us. Here the cold and the damp were more obvious and penetrating
than before, while the ghastly sounds appeared to redouble in
volume.</p>

<p>Down, down we slid into an abyss of darkness. The horror of the
silence in the chamber above was forgotten in the horror of the
pandemonium of uncanny sounds that rose from beneath.</p>

<p>How far we were lowered thus I may not even guess, but to Nur An
it seemed at least a thousand feet and then we commenced to detect
a slight luminosity about us. The moaning and the groaning had
become a constant roar. As we approached, it seemed less like moans
and groans and more like the sound of wind and rushing waters.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without the slightest warning, the bottom of the cage,
which evidently must have been hinged upon one side, and held by a
catch that could be sprung from above, swung downward. It happened
so quickly that we hardly had time for conjecture before we were
plunged into rushing water.</p>

<p>As I rose to the surface I discovered that I could see. Wherever
we were, it was not shrouded in impenetrable darkness, but was
lighted dimly.</p>

<p>Almost immediately Nur An's head bobbed up at arm's length from
me. A strong current was bearing us onward and I realized at once
that we were in the grip of a great underground river, one of those
to which the remaining waters of dying Barsoom have receded. In the
distance I descried a shoreline dimly visible in the subdued light,
and, shouting to Nur An to follow me, I struck out toward it. The
water was cold, but not sufficiently so to alarm me and I had no
doubt but that we would reach the shore.</p>

<p>By the time that we had attained our goal and crawled out upon
the rocky shore, our eyes had become accustomed to the dim light of
the interior, and now, with astonishment, we gazed about us. What a
vast cavern! Far, far above us its ceiling was discernible in the
light of the minute radium particles with which the rock that
formed its walls and ceiling was impregnated, but the opposite bank
of the rushing torrent was beyond the range of our vision.</p>

<p>"So this is The Death!" exclaimed Nur An.</p>

<p>"I doubt if they know what it is themselves," I replied. "From
the roaring of the river and the moaning of the wind, they have
conjured something horrible in their own imaginations."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the greatest suffering that the victim must endure lies
in his anticipation of what awaits him in these seemingly horrid
depths," suggested Nur An, "whereas the worst that realization
might bring would be death by drowning."</p>

<p>"Or by starvation," I suggested.</p>

<p>Nur An nodded. "Nevertheless," he said, "I wish I might return
just long enough to mock them and witness their disappointment when
they find that The Death is not so horrible after all."</p>

<p>"What a mighty river," he added after a moment's silence. "Could
it be a tributary of Iss?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is Iss herself," I said.</p>

<p>"Then we are bound upon the last long pilgrimage down to the
lost sea of Korus in the valley Dor," said Nur An gloomily. "It may
be a lovely place, but I do not wish to go there yet."</p>

<p>"It is a place of horror," I replied.</p>

<p>"Hush," he cautioned; "that is sacrilege."</p>

<p>"It is sacrilege no longer since John Carter and Tars Tarkas
snatched the veil of secrecy from the valley Dor and disposed of
the myth of Issus, Goddess of Life Eternal." Even after I had told
him the whole tragic story of the false gods of Mars, Nur An
remained skeptical, so closely are the superstitions of religion
woven into every fiber of our being.</p>

<p>We were both a trifle fatigued after our battle with the strong
current of the river, and perhaps, too, we were suffering from
reaction from the nervous shock of the ordeal through which we had
passed. So we remained there, resting upon the rocky shore of the
river of mystery. Eventually our conversation turned to what was
uppermost in the minds of both and yet which each hesitated to
mention&mdash;the fate of Tavia and Phao.</p>

<p>"I wish that they, too, had been sentenced to The Death," I
said, "for then at least we might be with them and protect
them."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that we shall never see them again," said Nur An
gloomily. "What a cruel fate that I should have found Phao only to
lose her again irretrievably so quickly."</p>

<p>"It is indeed a strange trick of fate that after Tul Axtar stole
her from you, he should have lost her too, and then that you should
find her in Tjanath."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a slightly puzzled expression for a moment
and then his face cleared. "Phao is not the woman of whom I told
you in the dungeon at Tjanath," he said. "Phao I loved long before;
she was my first love. After I lost her I thought that I never
could care for a woman again, but this other one came into my life
and, knowing that Phao was gone forever, I found some consolation
in my new love, but I realize now that was not the same, that no
love could ever displace that which I felt for Phao."</p>

<p>"You lost her irretrievably once before," I reminded him, "but
you found her again; perhaps you will find her once more."</p>

<p>"I wish that I might share your optimism," he said.</p>

<p>"We have little else to buoy us up," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, and then with a laugh, added, "we
still live!"</p>

<p>Presently, feeling rested, we set out along the shore in the
direction that the river ran, for we had decided that that would be
our course if for no other reason than that it would be easier
going down hill than up. Where it would lead, we had not the
slightest idea; perhaps to Korus; perhaps to Omean, the buried sea
where lay the ships of the First Born.</p>

<p>Over tumbled rock masses we clambered and along level stretches
of smooth gravel we pursued our rather aimless course, knowing not
whither we were going, having no goal toward which to strive. There
was some vegetation, weird and grotesque, but almost colorless for
want of sunlight. There were tree-like plants with strange, angular
branches that snapped off at the lightest touch, and as the trees
did not look like trees, there were blossoms that did not look like
flowers. It was a world as unlike the outer world as the figments
of imagination are unlike realities.</p>

<p>But whatever musing upon the flora of this strange land I may
have been indulging in was brought to a sudden termination as we
rounded the shoulder of a jutting promontory and came face to face
with as hideous a creature as ever I had laid my eyes upon. It was
a great white lizard with gaping jaws large enough to engulf a man
at a single swallow. At sight of us it emitted an angry hiss and
advanced menacingly toward us.</p>

<p>Being unarmed and absolutely at the mercy of any creature that
attacked us, we pursued the only plan that our intelligence could
dictate&mdash;we retreated&mdash;and I am not ashamed to admit that
we retreated rapidly.</p>

<p>Running quickly around the end of the promontory, we turned
sharply up the bank away from the river. The bottom of the cavern
rose sharply and as I clambered upward I glanced behind me
occasionally to note the actions of our pursuer. He was now in
plain sight, having followed us around the end of the promontory
and there he stood looking about as though in search of us. Though
we were not far from him, he did not seem to see us, and I soon
became convinced that his eyesight was faulty; but not wishing to
depend upon this I kept on climbing until presently we came to the
top of the promontory, and, looking down upon the other side, I saw
a considerable stretch of smooth gravel, stretching out into the
dim distance along the river shore. If we could clamber down the
opposite side of the barrier and reach this level stretch of
gravel, I felt that we might escape the attentions of the huge
monster. A final glance at him showed him still standing, peering
first in one direction and then in another as though in search of
us.</p>

<p>Nur An had followed close behind me and now together we slipped
over the edge of the escarpment, and, though the rough rocks
scratched us severely, we finally reached the gravel below,
whereupon, having eluded our menacer, we set out upon a brisk run
down the river. We had covered scarcely more than fifty paces when
Nur An stumbled over an obstacle and as I stooped to give him a
hand up, I saw that the thing that had tripped him was the rotting
harness of a warrior and a moment later I saw the hilt of a sword
protruding from the gravel. Seizing it, I wrenched it from the
ground. It was a good long sword and I may tell you that the feel
of it in my hand did more to restore my self-confidence than aught
else that might have transpired. Being made of noncorrosive metal,
as are all Barsoomian weapons, it remained as sound today as the
moment that it had been abandoned by its owner.</p>

<p>"Look," said Nur An, pointing, and there at a little distance we
saw another harness and another sword. This time there were two, a
long sword and a short sword, and these Nur An took. No longer did
we run. I have always felt that there is little upon Barsoom that
two well-armed warriors need run from.</p>

<p>As we continued along our way across the level stretch of gravel
we sought to solve the mystery of these abandoned weapons, a
mystery that was still further heightened by our discovery of many
more. In some cases the harness had rotted away entirely, leaving
nothing but the metal parts, while in others it was comparatively
sound and new. Presently we discerned a white mound ahead of us,
but in the dim light of the cavern we could not at first determine
of what it consisted. When we did, we were filled with horror, for
the white mound was of the bones and skulls of human beings. Then,
at last, I thought I had an explanation of the abandoned harness
and weapons. This was the lair of the great lizard. Here he took
his toll of the unhappy creatures that passed down the river, but
how was it that armed men had come here. We had been cast into the
cavern unarmed, as I was positive all of the condemned prisoners of
Tjanath must have been. From whence came the others? I do not know,
doubtless I shall never know. It was a mystery from the first. It
will remain a mystery to the last.</p>

<p>As we passed on we found harness and weapons scattered all
about, but there was infinitely more harness than weapons.</p>

<p>I had added a good short sword to my equipment, as well as a
dagger, as had also Nur An, and I was stooping to examine another
weapon which we had found&mdash;a short sword with a beautifully
ornamented hilt and guard&mdash;when Nur An suddenly voiced an
exclamation of warning.</p>

<p>"On guard," he cried, "Hadron! It comes!"</p>

<p>Leaping to my feet, I wheeled about, the short sword still in my
hand, and there, bearing down upon us at considerable speed and
with wide distended jaws, came the great white lizard hissing
ominously. He was a hideous sight, a sight such as to make even a
brave man turn and run, which I am now convinced is what
practically all of his victims did; but here were two who did not
run. Perhaps he was so close that we realized the futility of
flight without giving the matter conscious thought, but be that as
it may, we stood here&mdash;Nur An with his long sword in his hand,
I with the ornately carved short sword that I had been examining,
though instantly I realized that it was not the weapon with which
to defend myself against this great hulking brute.</p>

<p>Yet I could not bear to waste a weapon already in my hand,
especially in view of an accomplishment of mine in which I took
considerable pride.</p>

<p>In Helium, both officers and men often wager large amounts upon
the accuracy with which they can hurl daggers and short swords and
I have seen considerable sums change hands within an hour, but so
proficient was I that I had added considerably to my pay through my
winning until my fame had spread to such an extent that I could
find no one willing to pit his skill against mine.</p>

<p>Never had I hurled a weapon with a more fervent prayer for the
accuracy of my throw than now as I launched the short sword swiftly
at the mouth of the oncoming lizard. It was not a good throw. It
would have lost me money in Helium, but in this instance, I think,
it saved my life. The sword, instead of speeding in a straight
line, point first, as it should have, turned slowly upward until it
was traveling at an angle of about forty-five degrees, with the
point forward and downward. In this position the point struck just
inside of the lower jaw of the creature, while the heavy hilt,
carried forward by its own momentum, lodged in the roof of the
monster's mouth.</p>

<p>Instantly it was helpless; the point of the sword had passed
through its tongue into the bony substance of its lower jaw, while
the hilt was lodged in its upper jaw behind its mighty fangs. It
could not dislodge the sword, either forward or backward, and for
an instant it halted in hissing dismay, and simultaneously Nur An
and I leaped to opposite sides of its ghastly white body. It tried
to defend itself with its tail and talons, but we were too quick
for it and presently it was lying in a pool of its own purple blood
in the final spasmodic muscular reaction of dissolution.</p>

<p>There was something peculiarly disgusting and loathsome about
the purple blood of the creature, not only in its appearance, but
in its odor, which was almost nauseating, and Nur An and I lost no
time in quitting the scene of our victory. At the river we washed
our blades and then continued on upon our fruitless quest.</p>

<p>As we had washed our blades we had noticed fish in the river and
after we had put sufficient distance between the lair of the lizard
and ourselves, we determined to bend our energies for awhile toward
filling our larder and our stomachs.</p>

<p>Neither one of us had ever caught a fish or eaten one, but we
knew from history that they could be caught and that they were
edible. Being swordsmen, we naturally looked to our swords as the
best means for procuring our flesh and so we waded into the river
with drawn long swords prepared to slaughter fish to our heart's
content, but wherever we went there was no fish. We could see them
elsewhere, but not within reach of our swords.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Nur An, "fish are not such fools as they appear.
They may see us approaching and question our motive."</p>

<p>"I can readily believe that you are right," I replied. "Suppose
we try strategy."</p>

<p>"How?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Come with me," I said, "and return to the bank." After a little
search down stream I found a rocky ledge overhanging the river. "We
will lie here at intervals," I said, "with only our eyes and the
points of our swords over the edge of the bank. We must not talk or
move, lest we frighten the fish. Perhaps in this way we shall
procure one," for I had long since given up the idea of a general
slaughter.</p>

<p>To my gratification my plan worked and it was not long before we
each had a large fish.</p>

<p>Naturally, like other men, we prefer our flesh cooked, but being
warriors we were accustomed to it either way, and so we broke our
long fast upon raw fish from the river of mystery.</p>

<p>Both Nur An and I felt greatly refreshed and strengthened by our
meal, however unpalatable it might have been. It had been some time
since we had slept and though we had no idea whether it was still
night upon the outer surface of Barsoom, or whether dawn had
already broken, we decided that it would be best for us to sleep
and so Nur An stretched out where we were while I watched. After he
awoke, I took my turn. I think that neither one of us slept more
than a single zode, but the rest did us quite as much good as the
food that we had eaten and I am sure that I have never felt more
fit than I did when we set out again upon our goalless journey.</p>

<p>I do not know how long we had been traveling after our sleep,
for by now the journey was most monotonous, there being little
change in the dimly seen landscape surrounding us and only the
ceaseless roar of the river and the howling of the wind to keep us
company.</p>

<p>Nur An was the first to discern the change; he seized my arm and
pointed ahead. I must have been walking with my eyes upon the
ground in front of me, else I must have seen what he saw
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"It is daylight," I exclaimed. "It is the sun."</p>

<p>"It can be nothing else," he said.</p>

<p>There, far ahead of us, lay a great archway of light. That was
all that we could see from the point at which we discovered it, but
now we hastened on almost at a run, so anxious were we for a
solution, so hopeful that it was indeed the sunlight and that in
some inexplicable and mysterious way the river had found its way to
the surface of Barsoom. I knew that this could not be true and Nur
An knew it, and yet each knew how great his disappointment would be
when the true explanation of the phenomenon was revealed.</p>

<p>When we approached the great patch of light it became more and
more evident that the river had broken from its dark cavern out
into the light of day, and when we reached the edge of that mighty
portal we looked out upon a scene that filled our hearts with
warmth and gladness, for there, stretching before us, lay a
valley&mdash;a small valley it is true&mdash;a valley hemmed in, as
far as we could see, by mighty cliffs, but yet a valley of life and
fertility and beauty bathed in the hot light of the sun.</p>

<p>"It is not quite the surface of Barsoom," said Nur An, "but it
is the next best thing."</p>

<p>"And there must be a way out," I said. "There must be. If there
is not, we will make one."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Hadron of Hastor," he cried. "We will make a
way. Come!"</p>

<p>Before us the banks of the roaring river were lined with lush
vegetation; great trees raised their leafy branches far above the
waters; the brilliant, scarlet sward was lapped by the little
wavelets and everywhere bloomed gorgeous flowers and shrubs of many
hues and shapes. Here was a vegetation such as I had never seen
before upon the surface of Barsoom. Here were forms similar to
those with which I was familiar and others totally unknown to me,
yet all were lovely, though some were bizarre.</p>

<p>Emerging, as we had, from the dark and gloomy bowels of the
earth, the scene before us presented a view of wondrous beauty,
and, while doubtless enhanced by contrast, it was nevertheless such
an aspect as is seldom given to the eyes, of a Barsoomian of today
to view. To me it seemed a little garden spot upon a dying world
preserved from an ancient era when Barsoom was young and
meteorological conditions were such as to favor the growth of
vegetation that has since become extinct over practically the
entire area of the planet. In this deep valley, surrounded by lofty
cliffs, the atmosphere doubtless was considerably denser than upon
the surface of the planet above. The sun's rays were reflected by
the lofty escarpment, which must also hold the heat during the
colder periods of night, and, in addition to this, there was ample
water for irrigation which nature might easily have achieved
through percolation of the waters of the river through and beneath
the top soil of the valley.</p>

<p>For several minutes Nur An and I stood spellbound by the
bewitching view, and then, espying luscious fruit hanging in great
clusters from some of the trees, and bushes loaded with berries we
subordinated the aesthetic to the corporeal and set forth to
supplement our meal of raw fish with the exquisite offerings which
hung so temptingly before us.</p>

<p>As we started to move through the vegetation we became aware of
thin threads of a gossamerlike substance festooned from tree to
tree and bush to bush. So fine as to be almost invisible, yet they
were so strong as to impede our progress. It was surprisingly
difficult to break them, and when there were a dozen or more at a
time barring our way, we found it necessary to use our daggers to
cut a way through them.</p>

<p>We had taken only a few steps into the deeper vegetation,
cutting our way through the gossamer strands, when we were
confronted by a new and surprising obstacle to our advance&mdash;a
large, venomous-looking spider that scurried toward us in an
inverted position, clinging with a dozen legs to one of the
gossamer strands, which served both as its support and its pathway,
and if its appearance was any index to its venomousness it must,
indeed, have been a deadly insect.</p>

<p>As it came toward me, apparently with the most sinister
intentions, I hastily returned my dagger to its scabbard and drew
my short sword, with which I struck at the fearsome looking
creature. As the blow descended, it drew back so that my point only
slightly scratched it, whereupon it opened its hideous mouth and
emitted a terrific scream so out of proportion to its size and to
the nature of such insects with which I was familiar that it had a
most appalling effect upon my nerves. Instantly the scream was
answered by an unearthly chorus of similar cries all about us and
immediately a swarm of these horrid insects came racing toward us
upon their gossamer threads. Evidently this was the only position
which they assumed in moving about and their webs the only means to
that end, for their twelve legs grew upward from their backs,
giving them a most uncanny appearance.</p>

<p>Fearing that the creatures might be poisonous, Nur An and I
retreated hastily to the mouth of the cavern, and as the spiders
could not go beyond the ends of their threads, we were soon quite
safe from them and now the luscious fruit looked more tempting than
ever, since it seemed to be denied to us.</p>

<p>"The road down the river is well guarded," said Nur An with a
rueful smile, "which might indicate a most desirable goal."</p>

<p>"At present that fruit is the most desirable thing in the world
to me," I replied, "and I am going to try to discover some means of
obtaining it."</p>

<p>Moving to the right, away from the river, I sought for an
entrance into the forest that would be free from the threads of the
spiders and presently I came to a point where there was a
well-defined trail about four or five feet wide, apparently cut by
man from the vegetation. Across the mouth of it, however, were
strung thousands of gossamer strands. To touch them, we knew, would
be the signal for myriads of the angry spiders to swarm upon us.
While our greatest fear was, of course, that the insects might be
poisonous, their cruelly fanged mouths also suggested that,
poisonous or not, they might in their great numbers constitute a
real menace.</p>

<p>"Do you notice," I said to Nur An, "that these threads seem
stretched across the entrance to the pathway only. Beyond them I
cannot detect any, though of course they are so tenuous that they
might defy one's vision even at a short distance."</p>

<p>"I do not see any spiders here," said Nur An. "Perhaps we can
cut our way through with impunity at this point."</p>

<p>"We shall experiment," I said, drawing my long sword.</p>

<p>Advancing, I cut a few strands, when immediately there swarmed
out of the trees and bushes upon either side great companies of the
insects, each racing along its own individual strand. Where the
strands were intact the creatures crossed and recrossed the trail,
staring at us with their venomous, beady eyes, their powerful,
gleaming fangs bared threateningly toward us.</p>

<p>The cut strands floated in the air until borne down by the
weight of the approaching spiders who followed to the severed ends
but no further. Here they either hung glaring at us or else
clambered up and down excitedly, but not one of them ever ventured
from his strand.</p>

<p>As I watched them, their antics suggested a plan. "They are
helpless when their web is severed," I said to Nur An. "Therefore
if we cut all their webs they cannot reach us." Whereupon,
advancing, I swung my long sword above my head and cut downward
through the remaining strands. Instantly the creatures set up their
infernal screaming. Several of them, torn from their webs by the
blow of my sword, lay upon the ground upon their bellies, their
feet sticking straight up into the air. They seemed utterly
helpless, and though they screamed loudly and frantically waved
their legs, they were clearly unable to move; nor could those
hanging, at either side of the trail reach us. With my sword I
destroyed those that lay in the path and then, followed by Nur An,
I entered the forest. Ahead of us I could see no webs; the way
seemed clear, but before we advanced further into the forest I
turned about to have a last look at the discomfited insects to see
what they might be about. They had stopped screaming now and were
slowly returning into the foliage, evidently to their lairs, and as
they seemed to offer no further menace we continued upon our way.
The trees and bushes along the pathway were innocent of fruit or
berries, though just beyond reach we saw them growing in profusion,
behind a barrier of those gossamer webs that we had so quickly
learned to avoid.</p>

<p>"This trail appears to have been made by man," said Nur An.</p>

<p>"Whoever made it, or when," I said, "there is no doubt but that
some creature still uses it. The absence of fruit along it would
alone be ample proof of that."</p>

<p>We moved cautiously along the winding trail, not knowing at what
moment we might be confronted by some new menace in the form of man
or beast. Presently we saw ahead of us what appeared to be an
opening in the forest and a moment later we emerged into a
clearing. Looming in front of us at a distance of perhaps less than
a haad was a towering pile of masonry. It was a gloomy pile,
apparently built of black volcanic rock. For some thirty feet above
the ground there was a blank wall, pierced by but a single
opening&mdash;a small doorway almost directly in front of us. This
part of the structure appeared to be a wall, beyond it rose
buildings of weird and grotesque outlines and dominating all was a
lofty tower, from the summit of which a wisp of smoke curled upward
into the quiet air.</p>

<p>From this new vantage point we had a better view of the valley
than had at first been accorded us, and now, more marked than ever,
were the indications that it was the crater of some gigantic and
long extinct volcano. Between us and the buildings, which suggested
a small walled city, the clearing contained a few scattered trees,
but most of the ground was given over to cultivation, being
traversed by irrigation ditches of an archaic type which has been
abandoned upon the surface for many ages, having been superseded by
a system of subirrigation when the diminishing water supply
necessitated the adoption of conservation measures.</p>

<p>Satisfied that no further information could be gained by
remaining where we were, I started boldly into the clearing toward
the city. "Where are you going?" asked Nur An.</p>

<p>"I am going to find out who dwells in that gloomy place," I
replied. "Here are fields and gardens, so they must have food and
that, after all, is the only favor that I shall ask of them."</p>

<p>Nur An shook his head. "The very sight of the place depresses
me," he said. But he came with me as I knew he would, for Nur An is
a splendid companion upon whose loyalty one may always depend.</p>

<p>We had traversed about two-thirds of the distance across the
clearing toward the city before we saw any signs of life and then a
few figures appeared at the top of the wall above the entrance.
They carried long, thin scarfs, which they seemed to be waving in
greeting to us and when we had come yet closer I saw that they were
young women. They leaned over the parapet and smiled and beckoned
to us.</p>

<p>As we came within speaking distance below the wall, I halted.
"What city is this," I asked, "and who is jed here?"</p>

<p>"Enter, warriors," cried one of the girls, "and we will lead you
to the jed." She was very pretty and she was smiling sweetly, as
were her companions.</p>

<p>"This is not such a depressing place as you thought," I said in
a low voice to Nur An.</p>

<p>"I was mistaken," said Nur An. "They seem to be a kindly,
hospitable people. Shall we enter?"</p>

<p>"Come," called another of the girls; "behind these gloomy walls
lie food and wine and love."</p>

<p>Food! I would have entered a far more forbidding place than this
for food.</p>

<p>As Nur An and I strode toward the small door, it slowly withdrew
to one side. Beyond, across a black paved avenue, rose buildings of
black volcanic rock. The avenue seemed deserted as we stepped
within. We heard the faint click of a lock as the door slid into
place behind us and I had a sudden foreboding of ill that made my
right hand seek the hilt of my long sword.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE SPIDER OF
GHASTA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a moment we stood undecided in the middle of
the empty avenue, looking about us, and then our attention was
attracted to a narrow stairway running up the inside of the wall,
upon the summit of which the girls had appeared and welcomed
us.</p>

<p>Down the stairway the girls were coming. There were six of them.
Their beautiful faces were radiant with happy smiles of welcome
that instantly dispelled the gloom of the dark surroundings as the
rising sun dissipates night's darkness and replaces her shadows
with light and warmth and happiness.</p>

<p>Beautifully wrought harness, enriched by many a sparkling jewel,
accentuated the loveliness of faultless figures. As they approached
a vision of Tavia sprang to my mind. Beautiful as these girls
unquestionably were, how much more beautiful was Tavia!</p>

<p>I recall distinctly, even now, that in that very instant with
all that was transpiring to distract my attention, I was suddenly
struck by wonder that it should have been Tavia's face and figure
that I saw rather than those of Sanoma Tora. You may believe that I
brought myself up with a round turn and thereafter it was a vision
of Sanoma Tora that I saw, and that, too, without any disloyalty to
my friendship for Tavia&mdash;that blessed friendship which I
looked upon as one of my proudest and most valuable
possessions.</p>

<p>As the girls reached the pavement they came eagerly toward us.
"Welcome, warriors," cried one, "to happy Ghasta. After your long
journey you must be hungry. Come with us and you shall be fed, but
first the great jed will wish to greet you and welcome you to our
city, for visitors to Ghasta are few."</p>

<p>As they led us along the avenue I could not but note the
deserted appearance of the city. There was no sign of life about
any of the buildings that we passed nor did we see another human
being until we had come to an open plaza, in the center of which
rose a mighty building surmounted by the lofty tower that we had
seen when we first emerged from the forest. Here we saw a number of
people, both men and women&mdash;sad, dejected looking people, who
moved with bent shoulders and downcast eyes. There was no animation
in their step and their whole demeanor seemed that of utter
hopelessness. What a contrast they presented to the gay and happy
girls who so joyously conducted us toward the main entrance of what
I assumed to be the palace of the jed. Here, burly warriors were on
guard&mdash;fat, oily looking fellows, whose appearance was not at
all to my liking. As we approached them an officer emerged from the
interior of the building. If possible, he was even fatter and more
greasy looking than his men, but he smiled and bowed as he welcomed
us.</p>

<p>"Greetings!" he exclaimed. "May the peace of Ghasta be upon the
strangers who enter her gates."</p>

<p>"Send word to Ghron, the great jed," said one of the girls to
him, "that we are bringing two strange warriors who wish to do
honor to him before partaking of the hospitality of Ghasta."</p>

<p>As the officer dispatched a warrior to notify the jed of our
coming, we were escorted into the interior of the palace. The
furnishings were striking, but extremely fantastic in design and
execution. The native wood of the forests had been used to fine
advantage in the construction of numerous pieces of beautifully
carved furniture, the grain of the woods showing lustrously in
their various natural colors, the beauties of which were sometimes
accentuated by delicate stain and by high polishes, but perhaps the
most striking feature of the interior decorations was the
gorgeously painted fabric that covered the walls and ceilings. It
was a fabric of unbelievable lightness, which gave the impression
of spun silver. So closely woven was it that, as I was to learn
later, it would hold water and of such great strength that it was
almost impossible to tear it.</p>

<p>Upon it were painted in brilliant colors the most fantastic
scenes that imagination might conceive. There were spiders with the
heads of beautiful women, and women with the heads of spiders.
There were flowers and trees that danced beneath a great red sun,
and great lizards, such as we had passed within the gloomy cavern
on our journey down from Tjanath. In all the figures that were
depicted there was nothing represented as nature had created it. It
was as though some mad mind had conceived the whole.</p>

<p>As we waited in the great entrance hall of the palace of the
jed, four of the girls danced for our entertainment&mdash;a strange
dance such as I had never before seen upon Barsoom. Its steps and
movements were as weird and fantastic as the mural decorations of
the room in which it was executed, and yet with all there was a
certain rhythm and suggestiveness in the undulations of those lithe
bodies that imparted to us a feeling of well-being and content.</p>

<p>The fat and greasy padwar of the guard moistened his thick lips
as he watched them and though he had doubtless seen them dance upon
many occasions, he seemed to be much more affected than we, but
perhaps he had no Phao or Sanoma Tora to occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p>Sanoma Tora! The chiseled beauty of her noble face stood out
clearly upon the screen of memory for a brief instant and then
slowly it began to fade. I tried to recall it, to see again the
short, haughty lip and the cold, level gaze, but it receded into a
blur from which there presently emerged a pair of wondrous eyes,
moist with tears, a perfect face and a head of tousled hair.</p>

<p>It was then that the warrior returned to say that Ghron, the
Jed, would receive us at once. Only the girls accompanied us, the
fat padwar remaining behind, though I could have sworn that it was
not through choice.</p>

<p>The room in which the jed received us was upon the second level
of the palace. It was a large room, even more grotesquely decorated
than those through which we had passed. The furniture was of weird
shapes and sizes, nothing harmonized with anything else and yet the
result was a harmony of discord that was not at all unpleasing.</p>

<p>The jed sat upon a perfectly enormous throne of volcanic glass.
It was, perhaps, the most ornate and remarkable piece of furniture
that I have ever seen and was the outstanding specimen of
craftsmanship in the entire city of Ghasta, but if it caught my eye
at the time it was only for an instant as nothing could for long
distract one's attention from the jed himself. In the first glance
he looked more like a hairy ape than a man. He was massively built
with great, heavy, stooping shoulders and long arms covered with
shaggy, black hair, the more remarkable, perhaps, because there is
no race of hairy men upon Barsoom. His face was broad and flat and
his eyes were so far apart that they seemed literally to be set in
the corners of his face. As we were halted before him, he twisted
his mouth into what I imagined at the time was intended for a
smile, but which only succeeded in making him look more horrible
than before.</p>

<p>As is customary, we laid our swords at his feet and announced
our names and our cities.</p>

<p>"Hadron of Hastor, Nur An of Jahar," he repeated. "Ghron, the
Jed, welcomes you to Ghasta. Few are the visitors who find their
way to our beautiful city. It is an event, therefore, when two such
illustrious warriors honor us with a visit. Seldom do we receive
word from the outer world. Tell us, then of your journey and of
what is transpiring upon the surface of Barsoom above us."</p>

<p>His words and his manner were those of a most solicitous host
bent upon extending a proper and cordial welcome to strangers, but
I could not rid myself of the belying suggestion of his repulsive
countenance, though I could do no less than play the part of a
grateful and appreciative guest.</p>

<p>We told our stories and gave him much news of those portions of
Barsoom with which each of us was familiar and as Nur An spoke, I
looked about me at the assemblage of the great chamber. They were
mostly women and many of them were young and beautiful. The men,
for the most part, were gross-looking, fat and oily, and there were
certain lines of cruelty about their eyes and their mouths that did
not escape me, though I tried to attribute it to the first
depressing impression that the black and somber buildings and the
deserted avenues had conveyed to my mind.</p>

<p>When we had finished our recitals, Ghron announced that a
banquet had been prepared in our honor and in person he led the
procession from the throne-room down a long corridor to a mighty
banquet hall, in the center of which stood a great table, down the
entire length of which was a magnificent decoration consisting
entirely of the fruits and flowers of the forest through which we
had passed. At one end of the table was the jed's throne and at the
other were smaller thrones, one for Nur An and one for me. Seated
on either side of us were the girls who had welcomed us to the city
and whose business, it seemed, now was to entertain us.</p>

<p>The design of the dishes with which the table was set was quite
in keeping with all the other mad designs of the palace of Ghron.
No two plates or goblets or platters were of the same shape or size
or design and nothing seemed suited to the purpose for which it was
intended. My wine was served in a shallow, triangular-shaped
saucer, while my meat was crammed into a tall, slender-stemmed
goblet. However, I was too hungry to be particular, and, I hoped,
too well conversant with the amenities of polite society to reveal
the astonishment that I felt.</p>

<p>Here, as in other parts of the palace, the wall coverings were
of the gossamer-like silver fabric that had attracted my attention
and admiration the moment that I had entered the building and so
fascinated was I by it that I could not refrain from mentioning it
to the girl who sat at my right.</p>

<p>"There is no such fabric anywhere else in Barsoom," she said.
"It is made here and only here."</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful," I said. "Other nations would pay well
for it."</p>

<p>"If we could get it to them," she said, "but we have no
intercourse with the world above us."</p>

<p>"Of what is it woven?" I asked.</p>

<p>"When you entered the valley Hohr," she said, "you saw a
beautiful forest, running down to the banks of the river Syl.
Doubtless you saw fruit in the forest and, being hungry, you sought
to gather it, but you were set upon by huge spiders that sped along
silver threads, finer than a woman's hair."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "that is just what happened."</p>

<p>"It is from this web, spun by those hideous spiders, that we
weave our fabric. It is as strong as leather and as enduring as the
rocks of which Ghasta is built."</p>

<p>"Do women of Ghasta spin this wonderful fabric?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The slaves," she said, "both men and women."</p>

<p>"And from whence come your slaves?" I asked, "if you have no
intercourse with the upper world?"</p>

<p>"Many of them come down the river from Tjanath, where they have
died The Death, and there are others who come from further up the
river, but why they come or from whence we never know. They are
silent people, who will not tell us, and sometimes they come from
down the river, but these are few and usually are so crazed by the
horrors of their journey that we can glean no knowledge from
them."</p>

<p>"And do any ever go on down the river from Ghasta?" I asked; for
it was in that direction that Nur An and I hoped to make our way in
search of liberty, as deep within me was the hope that we might
reach the valley Dor and the lost sea of Korus, from which I was
convinced I could escape, as did John Carter and Tars Tarkas.</p>

<p>"A few, perhaps," she said, "but we never know what becomes of
these, for none returns."</p>

<p>"You are happy here?" I asked.</p>

<p>She forced a smile to her beautiful lips, but I thought that a
shudder ran through her frame.</p>

<p>The banquet was elaborate and the food delicious. There was a
great deal of laughter at the far end of the table where the jed
sat, for those about him watched him closely, and when he laughed,
which he always did at his own jokes, the others all laughed
uproariously.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the meal a troupe of dancers entered the
apartment. My first view of them almost took my breath away, for,
with but a single exception, they were all horribly deformed. That
one exception was the most beautiful girl I have ever
seen&mdash;the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, with the
saddest face that I have ever seen. She danced divinely and about
her hopped and crawled the poor, unhappy creatures whose sad
afflictions should have made them the objects of sympathy rather
than ridicule and yet it was obvious that they had been selected
for their part for the sole purpose of giving the audience an
opportunity to vent its ridicule upon them. The sight of them
seemed to incite Ghron to a pitch of frenzied mirth, and, to add to
his own pleasure and to the discomforts of the poor, pathetic
performers, he hurled food and plates at them as they danced about
the banquet table.</p>

<p>I tried not to look at them, but there was a fascination in
their deformities which attracted my gaze and presently it became
apparent to me that the majority of them were artificially
deformed, that they had been thus broken and bent at the behest of
some malign mind and as I looked down the long board at the horrid
face of Ghron, distorted by maniacal laughter, I could not but
guess the author of their disfigurement.</p>

<p>When at last they were gone, three large goblets of wine were
borne into the banquet hall by a slave; two of them were red
goblets and one was black. The black goblet was set before Ghron
and the red ones before Nur An and me. Then Ghron rose and the
whole company followed his example.</p>

<p>"Ghron, the jed, drinks to the happiness of his honored guests,"
announced the ruler, and, raising the goblet to his lips, he
drained it to the bottom.</p>

<p>It seemed obvious that this little ceremony would conclude the
banquet and that it was intended Nur An and I should drink the
health of our host. I, therefore, raised my goblet. It was the
first time that anything had been served to me in the proper
receptacle and I was glad that at last I might drink without
incurring the danger of spilling most of the contents of the
receptacle into my lap.</p>

<p>"To the health and power of the great jed, Ghron," I said, and
following my host's example, drained the contents of the
goblet.</p>

<p>As Nur An followed my example with some appropriate words, I
felt a sudden lethargy stealing over me and in the instant before I
lost consciousness I realized that I had been given drugged
wine.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>When I regained consciousness I found myself lying upon the bare
floor of a room of a peculiar shape that suggested it was the
portion of the arc of a circle lying between the peripheries of two
concentric circles. The narrow end of the room curved inward, the
wider end outward. In the latter was a single, grated window; no
door or other openings appeared in any of the walls, which were
covered with the same silver fabric that I had noticed upon the
walls and ceilings of the palace of the jed. Near me lay Nur An,
evidently still under the influence of the opiate that had been
administered to us in the wine.</p>

<p>Again I looked about the room. I arose and went to the window.
Far below me I saw the roofs of the city. Evidently we were
imprisoned in the lofty tower that rose from the center of the
palace of the jed, but how had we been brought into the room?
Certainly not through the window, which must have been fully two
hundred feet above the city. While I was pondering this seemingly
unanswerable problem, Nur An regained consciousness. At first he
did not speak; he just lay there looking at me with a rueful smile
upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>Nur An shook his head. "We still live," he said dismally, "but
that is about the best that one may say."</p>

<p>"We are in the palace of a maniac, Nur An," I said. "There is no
doubt in my mind as to that. Every one here lives in constant
terror of Ghron and from what I have seen today they are warranted
in feeling terror."</p>

<p>"Yet I believe we saw little or nothing at that," said Nur
An.</p>

<p>"I saw enough," I replied.</p>

<p>"Those girls were so beautiful," he said after a moment's
silence. "I could not believe that such beauty and such duplicity
could exist together."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were the unwilling tools of a cruel master," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"I shall always like to think so," he said.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>The day waned and night fell; no one came near us, but in the
meantime I discovered something. Accidentally leaning against the
wall at the narrow end of our room I found that it was very warm,
in fact quite hot, and from this I inferred that the flue of the
chimney from which we had seen the smoke issuing rose through the
center of the tower and the wall of the chimney formed the rear
wall of our apartment. It was a discovery, but at the moment it
meant nothing to us.</p>

<p>There were no lights in our apartment, and, as only Cluros was
in the heavens and upon the opposite side of the tower, our prison
was in almost total darkness. We were sitting in gloomy
contemplation of our predicament, each wrapped in his own unhappy
thoughts, when I heard footsteps apparently approaching from below.
They came nearer and nearer until finally they ceased in an
adjoining apartment, seemingly the one next to ours. A moment later
there was a scraping sound and a line of light appeared at the
bottom of one of the side walls. It kept growing in width until I
finally realized that the entire partition wall was rising. In the
opening we saw at first the sandaled feet of warriors, and finally,
little by little, their entire bodies were revealed&mdash;two
stalwart, brawny men, heavily armed. They carried manacles and with
them they fastened our wrists behind our backs. They did not speak,
but with a gesture one of them directed us to follow him, and, as
we filed out of the room, the second warrior fell in behind us. In
silence we entered a steep, spiral ramp, which we descended to the
main body of the palace, but yet our escorts conducted us still
lower until I knew that we must be in the pits beneath the
palace.</p>

<p>The pits! Inwardly I shuddered. I much preferred the tower for I
have always possessed an inherent horror of the pits. Perhaps these
would be utterly dark and doubtless overrun by rats and
lizards.</p>

<p>The ramp ended in a gorgeously decorated apartment in which was
assembled about the same company of men and women that had partaken
of the banquet with us earlier in the day. Here, too, was Ghron
upon a throne. This time he did not smile as we entered the room.
He did not seem to realize our presence. He was sitting, leaning
forward, his eyes fixed upon something at the far end of the room
over which hung a deadly silence that was suddenly shattered by a
piercing scream of anguish. The scream was but a prelude to a
series of similar cries of agony.</p>

<p>I looked quickly in the direction from which the screams came,
the direction in which Ghron's gaze was fastened. I saw a naked
woman chained to a grill before a hot fire. Evidently they had just
placed her there as I had entered the room and it was her first
shrill scream of agony that had attracted my attention.</p>

<p>The grill was mounted upon wheels so that it could be removed to
any distance from the fire that the torturer chose, or completely
turned about presenting the other side of the victim to the
blaze.</p>

<p>As my eyes wandered back to the audience I saw that most of the
girls sat there glaring straight ahead, their eyes fixed with
horror upon the horrid scene. I do not believe that they enjoyed
it; I know that they did not. They were equally the unwilling
victims of the cruel vagaries of Ghron's diseased mind, but like
the poor creature upon the grill they were helpless.</p>

<p>Next to the torture itself, the most diabolical conceit of the
mind that had directed it was the utter silence enjoined upon all
spectators against the background of which the shrieks and moans of
the tortured victim evidently achieved their highest effectiveness
upon the crazed mind of the jed.</p>

<p>The spectacle was sickening. I turned my eyes away. Presently
one of the warriors who had fetched us touched me on the arm and
motioned me to follow him.</p>

<p>He led us from this apartment to another and there we witnessed
a scene infinitely more terrible than the grilling of the human
victim. I cannot describe it; it tortures my memory even to think
of it. Long before we reached that hideous apartment we heard the
screams and curses of its inmates. In utter silence, our guard
ushered us within. It was the chamber of horrors in which the Jed
of Ghasta was creating abnormal deformities for his cruel dance of
the cripples.</p>

<p>Still in silence, we were led from this horrid place and now our
guide conducted us upward to a luxuriously furnished apartment.
Upon divans lay two of the beautiful girls who had welcomed us to
Ghasta.</p>

<p>For the first time since we had left our room in the tower one
of our escort broke the silence.</p>

<p>"They will explain," he said, pointing to the girls. "Do not try
to escape. There is only one exit from this room. We will be
waiting outside." He then removed our manacles and with his
companion left the apartment, closing the door after them.</p>

<p>One of the occupants of the room was the same girl who had sat
at my right during the banquet. I had found her most gracious and
intelligent and to her I now turned.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" I demanded. "Why are we made
prisoners? Why have we been brought here?"</p>

<p>She beckoned me to come to the divan on which she reclined and
as I approached she motioned to me to sit down beside her.</p>

<p>"What you have seen tonight," she said, "represents the three
fates that lie in store for you. Ghron has taken a fancy to you and
he is giving you your choice."</p>

<p>"I do not yet quite understand," I said.</p>

<p>"You saw the victim before the grill?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Would you care to suffer that fate?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely."</p>

<p>"You saw the unhappy ones being bent and broken for the dance of
the cripples," she pursued.</p>

<p>"I did," I answered.</p>

<p>"And now you see this luxurious room&mdash;and me. Which would
you choose?"</p>

<p>"I cannot believe," I replied, "that the final alternative is
without conditions, which might make it appear less attractive than
it now seems, for otherwise there could be no possible question as
to which I would choose."</p>

<p>"You are right," she said. "There are conditions."</p>

<p>"What are they?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You will become an officer in the palace of the jed and as such
you will conduct tortures similar to those you have witnessed in
the pits of the palace. You will be guided by whatever whim may
possess your master."</p>

<p>I drew myself to my full height. "I choose the fire," I
said.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would," she said sadly, "and yet I hoped that
you might not."</p>

<p>"It is not because of you," I said quickly. "It is the other
conditions which no man of honor could accept."</p>

<p>"I know," she said, "and had you accepted them I must eventually
have despised you as I despise the others."</p>

<p>"You are unhappy here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said. "Who but a maniac could be happy in this
horrid place? There are, perhaps, six hundred people in the city
and there is not one who knows happiness. A hundred of us form the
court of the jed; the others are slaves. As a matter of fact, we
are all slaves, subject to every mad whim or caprice of the maniac
who is our master."</p>

<p>"And there is no escape?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I shall escape," I said.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"The fire," I replied.</p>

<p>She shuddered. "I do not know why I should care so much," she
said, "unless it is that I liked you from the first. Even while I
was helping to lure you into the city for the human spider of
Ghasta, I wished that I might warn you not to enter, but I was
afraid, just as I am afraid to die. I wish that I had your courage
to escape through the fire."</p>

<p>I turned to Nur An, who had been listening to our conversation.
"You have reached your decision?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "There could be but one decision for a man
of honor."</p>

<p>"Good!" I exclaimed, and then I turned to the girl. "You will
notify Ghron of our decision?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said; "ask for time in which to consider it. I know
that it will make no difference in the end, but yet&mdash;Oh, even
yet there is a germ of hope within me that even utter hopelessness
cannot destroy."</p>

<p>"You are right," I said. "There is always hope. Let him think
that you have half persuaded us to accept the life of luxury and
ease that he has offered as an alternative to death or torture, and
that if you are given a little more time you may succeed. In the
meantime we may be able to work out some plan of escape."</p>

<p>"Never," she said.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; PHOR TAK OF JHAMA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BACK in our quarters in the chimney tower, Nur An
and I discussed every mad plan of escape that entered our brains.
For some reason our fetters had not been replaced, which gave us at
least as much freedom of action as our apartment afforded and you
may rest assured that we took full advantage of it, examining
minutely every square inch of the floor and the walls as far up as
we could reach, but our combined efforts failed to reveal any means
for raising the partition which closed the only avenue of escape
from our prison, with the exception of the window which, while
heavily barred and some two hundred feet above the ground, was by
no means, therefore, eliminated from our plans.</p>

<p>The heavy vertical bars which protected the window withstood our
combined efforts when we sought to bend them, though Nur An is a
powerful man, while I have always been lauded for my unusual
muscular development. The bars were set a little too close together
to permit our bodies to pass through, but the removal of one of
them would leave an opening of ample size; yet to what purpose?
Perhaps the same answer was in Nur An's mind that was in
mine&mdash;that when hope was gone and the sole alternative
remaining was the fire within the grill, we might at least cheat
Ghron could we but hurl ourselves from this high window to the
ground far below.</p>

<p>But whatever end each of us may have had in view, he kept it to
himself and when I started digging at the mortar at the bottom of
one of the bars with the prong of a buckle from my harness, Nur An
asked no questions but set to work similarly upon the mortar at the
top of the same bar. We worked in silence and with little fear of
discovery, as no one had entered our prison since we had been
incarcerated there. Once a day the partition was raised a few
inches and food slipped in to us beneath it, but we did not see the
person who brought it, nor did anyone communicate with us from the
time that the guards had taken us to the palace that first night up
to the moment that we had finally succeeded in loosening the bar so
that it could be easily removed from its seat.</p>

<p>I shall never forget with what impatience we awaited the coming
of night, that we might remove the bar and investigate the
surrounding surface of the tower, for it had occurred to me that it
might offer a means of descent to the ground below, or rather to
the roof of the building which it surmounted, from where we might
hope to make our way to the summit of the city wall undetected.
Already, in view of this possibility, I had planned to tear strips
from the fabric covering our walls wherewith to make a rope down
which we might lower ourselves to the ground beyond the city
wall.</p>

<p>As night approached I commenced to realize how high I had built
my hopes upon this idea. It already seemed as good as accomplished,
especially when I had utilized the possibilities of the rope to its
fullest extent, which included making one of sufficient length to
reach from our window to the bottom of the tower. Thus every
obstacle was overcome. It was then, just at dusk, that I explained
my plan to Nur An.</p>

<p>"Fine," he exclaimed. "Let us start at once making our rope. We
know how strong this fabric is and that a slender strand of it will
support our weight. There is enough upon one wall to make all the
rope we need."</p>

<p>Success seemed almost assured as we started to remove the fabric
from one of the larger walls, but here we met with our first
obstacle. The fabric was fastened at the top and at the bottom with
large headed nails, set close together, which withstood our every
effort to tear it loose. Thin and light in weight, this remarkable
fabric appeared absolutely indestructible and we were almost
exhausted by our efforts when we were finally forced to admit
defeat.</p>

<p>The quick Barsoomian night had fallen and we might now, with
comparative safety, remove the bar from the window and reconnoiter
for the first time beyond the restricted limits of our cell, but
hope was now low within our breasts and it was with little
anticipation of encouragement that I drew myself to the sill and
projected my head and shoulders through the aperture.</p>

<p>Below me lay the somber, gloomy city, its blackness relieved by
but a few dim lights, most of which shone faintly from the palace
windows. I passed my palm over the surface of the tower that lay
within arm's reach, and again my heart sank within me. Smooth,
almost glass-like volcanic rock, beautifully cut and laid, offered
not the slightest handhold&mdash;indeed an insect might have found
it difficult to have clung to its polished surface.</p>

<p>"It is quite hopeless," I said as I drew my head back into the
room. "The tower is as smooth as a woman's breast."</p>

<p>"What is above?" asked Nur An.</p>

<p>Again I leaned out, this time looking upward. Just above me were
the eaves of the tower&mdash;our cell was at the highest level of
the structure. Something impelled me to investigate in that
direction&mdash;an insane urge, perhaps, born of despair.</p>

<p>"Hold my ankles, Nu An," I said, "and in the name of your first
ancestor, hold tightly!"</p>

<p>Clinging to two of the remaining bars I raised myself to a
standing position upon the window ledge, while Nur An clung to my
ankles. I could just reach the top of the eaves with my extended
fingers. Lowering myself again to the sill, I whispered to Nur An.
"I am going to attempt to reach the roof of the tower," I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>I laughed. "I do not know," I admitted, "but something within my
inner consciousness seems insistently to urge me on."</p>

<p>"If you fall," he said, "you will have escaped the
fire&mdash;and I will follow you. Good luck, my friend from
Hastor!"</p>

<p>Once again I raised myself to a standing position upon the sill
and reached upward until my fingers bent above the edge of the
lofty roof. Slowly I drew myself upward; below me, two hundred
feet, lay the palace roof and death. I am very strong&mdash;only a
very strong man could have hoped to succeed, for I had at best but
a precarious hold upon the flat roof above me, but, at last, I
succeeded in getting an elbow over and then I drew my body slowly
over the edge until, at last, I lay panting upon the basalt
flagging that topped the slender tower.</p>

<p>Resting a few moments, I arose to my feet. Mad, passionate
Thuria raced across the cloudless sky; Cluros, her cold spouse,
swung his aloof circle in splendid isolation; below me lay the
valley of Hohr like some enchanted fairyland of ancient lore; above
me frowned the beetling cliff that hemmed in this madman's
world.</p>

<p>A puff of hot air struck me suddenly in the face, recalling to
my mind that far below in the pits of Ghasta an orgy of torture was
occurring. Faintly a scream arose from the black mouth of the flue
behind me. I shuddered, but my attention was centered upon the
yawning opening now and I approached it. Almost unbearable waves of
heat were billowing upward from the mouth of the chimney. There was
little smoke, so perfect was the combustion, but what there was
shot into the air at terrific velocity. It almost seemed that were
I to cast myself upon it I should be carried far aloft.</p>

<p>It was then that a thought was born&mdash;a mad, impossible
idea, it seemed, and yet it clung to me as I lowered myself
gingerly over the outer edge of the tower and finally regained the
greater security of my cell.</p>

<p>I was about to explain my insane plan to Nur An when I was
interrupted by sounds from the adjoining chamber and an instant
later the partition started to rise. I thought they were bringing
us food again, but the partition rose further than was necessary
for the passing of food receptacles beneath it and a moment later
we saw the ankles and legs of a woman beneath the base of the
rising wall. Then a girl stooped and entered our cell. In the light
from the adjoining room I recognized her&mdash;she who had been
selected by Ghron to lure me to his will. Her name was Sharu.</p>

<p>Nur An had quickly replaced the bar on the window and when the
girl entered there was nothing to indicate that aught was amiss, or
that one of us had so recently been outside our cell. The partition
remained half raised, permitting light to enter the apartment, and
the girl, looking at me, must have noticed my gaze wandering to the
adjoining room.</p>

<p>"Do not let your hopes rise," she said with a rueful smile.
"There are guards waiting at the level next below."</p>

<p>"Why are you here, Sharu?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ghron sent me," she replied. "He is impatient for your
decision."</p>

<p>I thought quickly. Our only hope lay in the sympathy of this
girl, whose attitude in the past had at least demonstrated her
friendliness. "Had we a dagger and a needle," I said in a low
whisper, "we could give Ghron his answer upon the morning of the
day after tomorrow."</p>

<p>"What reason can I give him for this further delay?" she asked
after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Nur An, "that we are communing with our
ancestors and that upon their advice shall depend our
decision."</p>

<p>Sharu smiled. She drew a dagger from its sheath at her side and
laid it upon the floor and from a pocket pouch attached to her
harness she produced a needle, which she laid beside the dagger. "I
shall convince Ghron that it is best to wait," she said. "My heart
had hoped, Hadron of Hastor, that you would decide to remain with
me, but I am glad that I have not been mistaken in my estimate of
your character. You will die, my warrior, but at least you will die
as a brave man should and undefiled. Good-bye! I look upon you in
life for the last time, but until I am gathered to my ancestors
your image shall remain enshrined within my heart."</p>

<p>She was gone; the partition dropped, and again we were left in
the semi-darkness of a moonlit night, but now we had the two things
that I most desired&mdash;a dagger and a needle.</p>

<p>"Of what good are those?" asked Nur An as I gathered the two
articles from the floor.</p>

<p>"You will see," I replied, and immediately I set to work cutting
the fabric from the walls of our cell and then, standing upon Nur
An's shoulders, I removed also that which covered the ceiling. I
worked quickly for I knew that we had little time in which to
accomplish that which I had set out to do. A mad scheme it was, and
yet withal within the realms of practicability.</p>

<p>Working in the dark, more by sense of feel than by sight, I must
have been inspired by some higher power to have accomplished with
any degree of perfection the task that I had set myself.</p>

<p>The balance of that night and all of the following day Nur An
and I labored without rest until we had fashioned an enormous bag
from the fabric that had covered the walls and ceiling of our cell
and from the scraps that remained we fashioned long ropes and when
night fell again our task was completed.</p>

<p>"May luck be with us," I said.</p>

<p>"The scheme is worthy of the mad brain of Ghron himself," said
Nur An; "yet it has within it the potentialities of success."</p>

<p>"Night has fallen," I said; "we need not delay longer. Of one
thing, however, we may be sure, whether we succeed or fail we shall
have escaped the fire and in either event may our ancestors look
with love and compassion upon Sharu, whose friendship has made
possible our attempt."</p>

<p>"Whose love," corrected Nur An.</p>

<p>Once again I made the perilous ascent to the roof, taking one of
our new-made ropes with me. Then, from the summit, I lowered it to
Nur An, who fastened the great bag to it; after which I drew the
fruits of our labors carefully to the roof beside me. It was as
light as a feather, yet stronger than the well-tanned hide of a
zitidar. Next, I lowered the rope and assisted Nur An to my side,
but not until he had replaced the bar that we had removed from the
window.</p>

<p>Attached to the bottom of our bag, which was open, were a number
of long cords, terminating in loops. Through these loops we passed
the longest rope that we had made&mdash;a rope so long that it
entirely encircled the circumference of the tower&mdash;when we
lowered it below the projecting eaves. We made it fast there, but
with a slip knot that could be instantly released with a single
jerk.</p>

<p>Next, we slid the loops at the end of the ropes attached to the
bottom of the bag along the cord that encircled the tower below the
eaves until we had maneuvered the opening of the bag directly over
the mouth of the flue leading down into the furnace of death in the
pits of Ghasta. Standing upon either side of the flue Nur An and I
lifted the bag until it commenced to fill with the hot air rushing
from the chimney. Presently it was sufficiently inflated to remain
in an erect position, whereupon, leaving Nur An to steady it, I
moved the loops until they were at equal distances from one
another, thus anchoring the bag directly over the center of the
flue. Then I passed another rope loosely through the loops and
secured its end together, and to opposite sides of this rope Nur An
and I snapped the boarding hooks that are a part of the harness of
every Barsoomian warrior, the primary purpose of which is to lower
boarding parties from the deck of one ship to that of another
directly below, but which in practice are used in countless ways
and numerous emergencies.</p>

<p>Then we waited; Nur An ready to slip the knot that held the rope
around the tower beneath the eaves and I, upon the opposite side,
with Sharu's sharp dagger prepared to cut the rope upon my
side.</p>

<p>I saw the great bag that we had made filling with hot air. At
first, loosely inflated, it rocked and swayed, but presently, its
sides distended, it strained upward. Its fabric stretched tightly
until I thought that it should burst. It tugged and pulled at its
restraining cords, and yet I waited.</p>

<p>Down in the valley of Hohr there was little or no wind, which
greatly facilitated the carrying out of our rash venture.</p>

<p>The great bag, almost as large as the room in which we had been
confined, bellied above us. It strained upon its guy ropes in its
impatience to be aloft until I wondered that they held, and then I
gave the word.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Nur An slipped his knot and I severed the rope
upon the opposite side. Freed, the great bag leaped aloft, snapping
us in its wake. It shot upward with a velocity that was astounding
until the valley of Hohr was but a little hollow in the surface of
the great world that lay below us.</p>

<p>Presently a wind caught us and you may be assured that we gave
thanks to our ancestors as we realized that we were at last
drifting from above the cruel city of Ghasta. The wind increased
until it was blowing rapidly in a northeasterly direction, but
little did we care where it wafted us as long as it took us away
from the river Syl and the valley of Hohr.</p>

<p>After we had passed beyond the crater of the ancient volcano,
which formed the bed of the valley in which lay somber Ghasta, we
saw below us, in the moonlight, a rough volcanic country that
presented a weird and impressive appearance of unreality; deep
chasms and tumbled piles of basalt seemed to present an
unsurmountable barrier to man, which may explain why in this remote
and desolate corner of Barsoom the valley of Hohr had lain for
countless ages undiscovered.</p>

<p>The wind increased. Floating at a great altitude we were being
carried at considerable speed, yet I could see that we were very
slowly falling as the hot air within our bag cooled. How much
longer it would keep us up I could not guess, but I hoped it would
bear us at least beyond the uninviting terrain beneath us.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn we were floating but a few hundred feet
above the ground; the volcanic country was far behind us and as far
as we could see stretched lovely, rolling hills, sparsely timbered
with the drought resisting skeel upon which it has been said the
civilization of Barsoom has been erected.</p>

<p>As we topped a low hill, passing over it by a scant fifty sofads
we saw below us a building of gleaming white. Like all the cities
and isolated buildings of Barsoom, it was surrounded by a lofty
wall, but in other respects it differed materially from the usual
Barsoomian type of architecture. The edifice, which was made up of
a number of buildings, was not surmounted by the usual towers,
domes and minarets that mark all Barsoomian cities and which only
in recent ages have been giving way slowly to the flat landing
stages of an aerial world. The structure below us was composed of a
number of flat roofed buildings of various heights, none of which,
however, appeared to rise over four levels. Between the buildings
and the outer walls and in several open courts between the
buildings, there was a profusion of trees and shrubbery with
scarlet sward and well kept paths. It was, in fact, a striking and
beautiful sight, yet having so recently been lured to near
destruction by the beauties of Hohr and the engaging allurements of
her beautiful women, we had no mind to be deceived again by
external appearances. We would float over the palace of enchantment
and take our chances in the open country beyond.</p>

<p>But fate willed otherwise. The wind had abated; we were dropping
rapidly; beneath us we saw people in the garden of the building and
simultaneously, as they discovered us, it was evident that they
were filled with consternation. They hastened quickly to the
nearest entrances and there was not a human being in sight when we
finally came to rest upon the roof of one of the taller sections of
the structure.</p>

<p>As we extricated ourselves from the loops in which we had been
sitting, the great bag, relieved of our weight, rose quickly into
the air for a short distance, turned completely over and dropped to
the ground just beyond the outer wall. It had served us well and
now it seemed like a living thing that had given up its life for
our salvation.</p>

<p>We were to have little time, however, for sentimental regrets,
for almost immediately a head appeared through a small opening in
the roof upon which we stood. The head was followed by the body of
a man, whose harness was so scant as to leave him almost nude. He
was an old man with a finely shaped head, covered with scant, gray
locks.</p>

<p>Apparent physical old age is so rare upon Barsoom as always to
attract immediate attention. In the natural span of life we live
often to a thousand years, but during that long period our
appearance seldom changes but little. It is true that most of us
meet violent death long before we reach old age, but there are some
who pass the allotted span of life and others who do not care for
themselves so well and these few constitute the physically old
among us; evidently of such was the little old man who confronted
us.</p>

<p>At sight of him Nur An voiced an exclamation of pleased
surprise. "Phor Tak!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" cackled the old man in a high falsetto. "Who cometh
from the high heavens who knows old Phor Tak?"</p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;Nur An!" exclaimed my friend.</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" cried Phor Tak. "Nur An&mdash;one of Tul Axtar's
pets."</p>

<p>"As you once were, Phor Tak."</p>

<p>"But not now&mdash;not now," almost screamed the old man. "The
tyrant squeezed me like some juicy fruit and then cast the empty
rind aside. Heigh-oo! He thought it was empty, but I pray daily to
all my ancestors that he may live to know that he was wrong. I can
say this with safety to you, Nur An, for I have you in my power and
I promise you that you shall never live to carry word of my
whereabouts to Tul Axtar."</p>

<p>"Do not fear, Phor Tak," said Nur An. "I, too, have suffered
from the villainy of the Jeddak of Jahar. You were permitted to
leave the capital in peace, but all my property was confiscated and
I was sentenced to death."</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo! Then you hate him, too," exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>"Hate is a weak word to describe my feeling for Tul Axtar,"
replied my friend.</p>

<p>"It is well," said Phor Tak. "When I saw you descending from the
skies I thought that my ancestors had sent you to help me, and I
know that it was indeed true. Be this another warrior from Jahar?"
he added, nodding his old head toward me.</p>

<p>"No, Phor Tak," replied Nur An. "This is Hadron of Hastor, a
noble of Helium, but he, too, has been wronged by Jahar."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the old man. "Now there are three of us.
Heretofore I have had only slaves and women to assist me, but now
with two trained warriors, young and strong, the goal of my triumph
appears almost in sight."</p>

<p>As the two men conversed I had recalled that part of the story
that Nur An had told me in the pits of Tjanath which related to
Phor Tak and his invention of the rifle that projected the
disintegrating rays which had proved so deadly against the patrol
boat above Helium the night of Sanoma Tora's abduction. Strange,
indeed, was fate that it should have brought me into the palace of
the man who held the secret that might mean so much to Helium and
to all Barsoom. Strange, too, and devious had been the path along
which fate had led me, yet I knew that my ancestors were guiding me
and that all must have been arranged to some good end.</p>

<p>When Phor Tak had heard only a portion of our story he insisted
that we must be both fatigued and hungry and, like the good host
that he proved to be, he conducted us down to the interior of his
palace and, summoning slaves, ordered that we be bathed and fed and
then permitted to retire until we were rested. We thanked him for
his kindness and consideration, of which we were glad to avail
ourselves.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>The days that followed were both interesting and profitable.
Phor Tak, surrounded only by a few faithful slaves who had followed
him into his exile, was delighted with our company and with the
assistance which we could give him in his experiment, which, once
assured of our loyalty he explained to us in detail.</p>

<p>He told us the story of his wanderings after he had left Jahar
and of how he had stumbled upon this long deserted castle, whose
builder and occupants had left no record other than their bones. He
told us that when he discovered it skeletons had strewn the
courtyard and in the main entrance were piled the bones of a score
of warriors, attesting the fierce defense that the occupants had
waged against some unknown enemy, while in many of the upper rooms
he had found other skeletons&mdash;the skeletons of women and
children.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that the place was beset by members of
some savage horde of green warriors that left not a single
survivor. The courts and gardens were overgrown with weeds and the
interior of the building was filled with dust, but otherwise little
damage had been done. I call it Jhama, and here I am carrying on my
life's work."</p>

<p>"And that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Revenge upon Tul Axtar," said the old man. "I gave him the
disintegrating ray; I gave him the insulating paint that protects
his own ships and weapons from it, and now some day I shall give
him something else&mdash;something that will be as revolutionary in
the art of war as the disintegrating ray itself; something that
will cast the fleet of Jahar broken wrecks upon the ground;
something that will search out the palace of Tul Axtar and bury the
tyrant beneath its ruins."</p>

<p>We had not been long at Jhama before both Nur An and I became
convinced that Phor Tak's mind was at least slightly deranged from
long brooding over the wrongs inflicted upon him by Tul Axtar;
though naturally possessed of a kindly disposition he was obsessed
by a maniacal desire to wreak vengeance upon the tyrant with utter
disregard of the consequences to himself and to others. Upon this
single subject he was beyond the influence of reason and having
established to his own satisfaction that Nur An and I were
potential factors in the successful accomplishment of his design,
he would fly into a perfect frenzy of rage whenever I broached the
subject of our departure.</p>

<p>Fretting as I was beneath the urge to push on to Jahar and the
rescue of Sanoma Tora, I could but illy brook this enforced delay,
but Phor Tak was adamant&mdash;he would not permit me to
depart&mdash;and the absolute loyalty of his slaves made it
possible for him to enforce his will. In our hearing he explained
to them that we were guests, honored guests as long as we made no
effort to depart without his permission, but should they discover
us in an attempt to leave Jhama surreptitiously they were to
destroy us.</p>

<p>Nur An and I discussed the matter at length. We had discovered
that four thousand haads of difficult and unfriendly country lay
between us and Jahar. Being without a ship and without thoats there
was little likelihood that we should be able to reach Jahar in time
to be of service to Sanoma Tora, if we ever reached it at all, and
so we agreed to bide our time, impressing Phor Tak with our
willingness to aid him in the hope that eventually we should be
able to enlist his aid and support, and so successful were we that
within a short time we had so won the confidence of the old
scientist that we began to entertain hope that he would take us
into his innermost confidence and reveal the nature of the
instrument of destruction which he was preparing for Tul Axtar.</p>

<p>I must admit that I was principally interested in his invention
because I was confident that in order to utilize it against Tul
Axtar he must find some means of transporting it to Jahar and in
this I saw an opportunity for reaching the capital of the tyrant
myself.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>We had been in Jhama about ten days during which time Phor Tak
exhibited signs of extreme nervousness and irritability. He kept us
with him practically all of the time that he was not closeted in
the innermost recesses of his secret laboratory.</p>

<p>During the evening meal upon the tenth day Phor Tak seemed more
distraught than ever. Talking, as usual, interminably about his
hatred of Tul Axtar, his countenance assumed an expression of
maniacal fury.</p>

<p>"But I am helpless," he almost screamed at last. "I am helpless
because there is no one to whom I may entrust my secret, who also
has the courage and intelligence to carry out my plan. I am too
old, too weak to undergo the hardships that would mean nothing to
young men like you, but which must be undergone if I am to fulfill
my destiny as the savior of Jahar. If I could but trust you! If I
could but trust you!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can, Phor Tak," I suggested.</p>

<p>The words or my tone seemed to soothe him. "Heigh-oo!" he
exclaimed. "Sometimes I almost think that I can."</p>

<p>"We have a common aim," I said; "or at least different aims
which converge at the same point&mdash;Jahar. Let us work together
then. We wish to reach Jahar. If you can help us, we will help
you."</p>

<p>He sat in silent thought for a long moment. "I'll do it," he
said. "Heigh-oo! I'll do it. Come," and rising from his chair he
led us toward the locked doorway that barred the entrance to his
secret laboratory.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; THE FLYING DEATH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">PHOR TAK'S laboratory occupied an entire wing of
the building and consisted of a single, immense room fully fifty
feet in height. His benches, tables, instruments and cabinets,
located in one corner, were lost in the great interior. Near the
ceiling and encircling the room was a single track from which was
suspended a miniature cruiser, painted the ghastly blue of Jahar.
Upon one of the benches was a cylindrical object about as long as
one's hand. These were the only noticeable features of the
laboratory other than its immense emptiness.</p>

<p>As Phor Tak ushered us within he closed the door behind him and
I heard the ominous click of the ponderous lock. There was
something depressing in the suggestiveness of the situation
induced, perhaps, by our knowledge that Phor Tak was mad and
accentuated by the eerie mystery of the vasty chamber.</p>

<p>Leading us to the bench upon which lay the cylindrical object
which had attracted my attention, he lifted it carefully, almost
caressingly, from its resting place. "This," he said, "is a model
of the device that will destroy Jahar. In it you behold the
concentrated essence of scientific achievement. In appearance it is
but a small metal cylinder, but within it is a mechanism as
delicate and as sensitive as the human brain and you will perceive
that it functions almost as though animated by a mind within
itself, but it is purely mechanical and may be produced in
quantities quickly and at low cost. Before I explain it further I
shall demonstrate one phase of its possibilities. Watch!"</p>

<p>Still holding the cylinder in his hand, Phor Tak stepped to a
shallow cabinet against the wall and opening it revealed an
elaborate equipment of switches, levers and push buttons. "Now
watch the miniature flier suspended from the track near the
ceiling," he directed, at the same time closing a switch.
Immediately the flier commenced to travel along the track at
considerable speed. Now Phor Tak pressed a button upon the top of
the cylinder, which immediately sped from his extended palm, turned
quickly in the air and rushed straight for the speeding flier.
Slowly the distance between the two closed; the cylinder, curving
gradually into the line of flight of the flier, was now trailing
directly behind it, its pointed nose but a few feet from the stern
of the miniature ship. Then Phor Tak pulled a tiny lever upon his
switchboard and the flier leaped forward at accelerated speed.
Instantly the speed of the cylinder increased and I could see that
it was gaining in velocity much more rapidly than the flier. Half
way around the room again its nose struck the stem of the fleeing
craft with sufficient severity to cause the ship to tremble from
stem to stern; then the cylinder fell away and floated gently
toward the floor. Phor Tak opened a switch that stopped the flier
in its flight and then, running forward, caught the descending
cylinder in his hand.</p>

<p>"This model," he explained, as he returned to where we stood,
"is so constructed that when it makes contact with the flier it
will float gently downward to the floor, but as you have doubtless
fully realized ere this, the finished product in practical use will
explode upon contact with the ship. Note these tiny buttons with
which it is covered. When any one of these comes in contact with an
object the model stops and descends, whereas the full-sized device,
properly equipped, will explode, absolutely demolishing whatever it
may have come in contact with. As you are aware every substance in
the universe has its own fixed vibratory rate. This mechanism can
be so attuned as to be attracted by the vibratory rate of any
substance. The model, for example, is attracted by the blue
protective paint with which the flier is covered. Imagine a fleet
of Jaharian warship moving majestically through the air in battle
formation. From an enemy ship or from the ground and at a distance
so far as to be unobservable by the ships of Jahar, I release as
many of these devices as there are ships in the fleet, allowing a
few moments to elapse between launchings. The first torpedo rushes
toward the fleet and destroys the nearest ship. All the torpedoes
in the rear, strung out in line, are attracted by the combined
masses of all the blue protecting coverings of the entire fleet.
The first ship is falling to the ground and though all of its paint
may not have been destroyed, it has not the power to deflect any of
the succeeding torpedoes, which one by one destroy the nearest of
the remaining ships until the fleet has been absolutely erased. I
have destroyed a great fleet without risking the life of a single
man of my own following."</p>

<p>"But they will see the torpedoes coming," suggested Nur An, "and
they will devise some defense. Even gunfire might stop many of
them."</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo! But I have thought of that," cackled Phor Tak. He
laid the torpedo upon a bench and opened another cabinet.</p>

<p>In this cabinet were a number of receptacles, some tightly
sealed and others opened, revealing their contents which appeared
to be different colored paints. From a number of these receptacles
protruded the handles of paint brushes. One such handle, however,
appeared to hang in midair, a few inches above one of the shelves,
while just beneath it was a section of the rim of a receptacle that
also appeared to be resting upon nothing. Phor Tak placed his open
hand directly beneath this floating rim and when he removed his
hand from the cabinet, the rim of the receptacle and the portion of
the handle of the paint brush, floating just above it, followed,
hovering just over his extended fingers, which were cupped in the
position that they might assume were they holding a glass jar, such
as would ordinarily have belonged to a rim like that which I could
see floating about an inch above his fingers.</p>

<p>Going to the bench where he had laid the cylinder, Phor Tak went
through the motions of setting a jar upon it, and, though there was
no jar visible other than the floating rim, I distinctly heard a
noise that was identical with the sound which the bottom of a glass
jar would have made in coming in contact with the bench.</p>

<p>I can assure you that I was greatly mystified, but still more so
by the events immediately following. Phor Tak seized the handle of
the paint brush and made a pass a few inches above the metal
torpedo. Instantly a portion of the torpedo, about an inch wide and
three or four inches long, disappeared. Pass after pass he made
until finally the whole surface of the torpedo had disappeared.
Where it had rested the bench was empty. Phor Tak returned the
handle of the paint brush to its floating position just above the
floating jar rim and then he turned to us with an expression of
child-like pride upon his face, as much to say, "Well, what do you
think of that? Am I not wonderful?" And I was certainly forced to
concede that it was wonderful and that I was entirely baffled and
mystified by what I had seen.</p>

<p>"There, Nur An," exclaimed Phor Tak, "is the answer to your
criticism of The Flying Death."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Nur An with a puzzled expression
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" cried Phor Tak. "Have you not seen me render the
device invisible?"</p>

<p>"But it is gone," said Nur An.</p>

<p>Phor Tak laughed his high cackling laugh. "It is still there,"
he said, "but you cannot see it. Here," and he took Nur An's hand
and guided it toward the spot where the device had been.</p>

<p>I could see Nur An's fingers apparently feeling over the surface
of something several inches above the top of the table. "By my
first ancestor, it is still there!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful," I exclaimed. "You did not even touch it; you
merely made passes above it with the handle of a paint brush and it
disappeared."</p>

<p>"But I did touch it," insisted Phor Tak. "The brush was there,
but you did not see it because it was covered by the substance
which renders the Flying Death invisible. Notice this transparent
glass receptacle in which I keep the compound of invisibility and
all that you can see of it is that part of the rim which, by
chance, has not been coated with the compound."</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" I exclaimed. "Even now, although I have witnessed
it with my own eyes I can scarce conceive of the possibility of
such a miracle."</p>

<p>"It is no miracle," said Phor Tak. "It is merely the application
of scientific principles well known to me for hundreds of years.
Nothing moves in straight lines; light, vision, electromagnetic
forces follow lines that curve. The compound of invisibility merely
bows outward the reflected light, which, entering our eyes and
impinging upon our optic nerves, results in the phenomenon which we
call vision, so that they pass around any object which is coated
with the compound. When I first started to apply the compound to
The Flying Death, your line of vision was deflected around the
small portions so coated, but when I coated the entire surface of
the torpedo, the curve of your vision passed completely around it
on both sides so that you could plainly see the bench upon which it
was resting precisely as though the device had not been there."</p>

<p>I was astounded at the apparent simplicity of the explanation,
and, naturally, being a soldier, I saw the tremendous advantage
that the possession of these two scientific secrets would impart to
the nation which controlled them. For the safety; yes, for the very
existence of Helium, I must possess them and if that were
impossible, then Phor Tak must be destroyed before the secret of
this infernal power could be passed on to any other nation. Perhaps
I could so ingratiate myself with old Phor Tak as to be able to
persuade him to turn these secrets over to Helium in return for
Helium's assistance in the work of wreaking his vengeance upon Tul
Axtar.</p>

<p>"Phor Tak," I said, "you hold here within your grasp two secrets
which in the hands of a kindly and beneficent power would bring
eternal peace to Barsoom."</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" he cried. "I do not want peace. I want war. War!
War!"</p>

<p>"Very well," I agreed, realizing that my suggestion had not been
in line with the mad processes of his crazed brain. "Let us have
war then, and what country upon Barsoom is better equipped to wage
war than Helium? If you want war, form an alliance with
Helium."</p>

<p>"I do not need Helium," he cried. "I do not need to form
alliances. I shall make war&mdash;I shall make war alone. With the
invisible Flying Death I can destroy whole navies, whole cities,
entire nations. I shall start with Jahar. Tul Axtar shall be the
first to feel the weight of my devastating powers. When the fleet
of Jahar has tumbled upon the roofs of Jahar and the walls of Jahar
have fallen about the ears of Tul Axtar, then shall I destroy
Tjanath. Helium shall know me next. Proud and mighty Helium shall
tremble and bow at the feet of Phor Tak. I shall be Jeddak of
Jeddaks, ruler of a world." As he spoke his voice rose to a
piercing shriek and he trembled in the grip of the frenzy that held
him.</p>

<p>He must be destroyed, not alone for the sake of Helium, but for
the sake of all Barsoom; this mad mind must be removed if I found
that it was impossible to direct or cajole it to my own ends. I
determined, however, to omit no sacrifice that might tend to bring
about a satisfactory conclusion to this strange adventure. I knew
that mad minds were sometimes fickle minds and I hoped that in a
moment of insane caprice Phor Tak might reveal to me the secret of
the Flying Death and the compound of invisibility. This hope was
his temporary reprieve from death; its fulfillment would be his
pardon, but I knew that I must work warily&mdash;that at the
slightest suggestion of duplicity, Phor Tak's suspicions would be
aroused and that I should then be the one to be destroyed.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>I tossed long upon my sleeping silks and furs that night in
troubled thought and planning. I felt that I must possess these
secrets; yet how? That they existed within his brain alone, I knew,
for he had told me that there were no written formulas, or plans or
specifications for either of them. Somehow I must wheedle them out
of him and the best way to start was to ingratiate myself with him.
To this end I must further his plans insofar as I possibly
could.</p>

<p>Just before I fell asleep my thoughts reverted to Sanoma Tora
and to the urgent mission that had led me to enter upon what had
developed into the strangest adventure of my career. I felt a
twinge of self-reproach as I suddenly realized that Sanoma Tora had
not been uppermost in my mind while I had lain there making plans
for the future, but now with recollection of her a plan was
suggested whereby I might not only succor her but also advance
myself in the good graces of Phor Tak at the same time, and, thus
relieved, I fell asleep.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>It was late the following morning before I had an opportunity to
speak with the old inventor when I immediately broached the subject
that was uppermost in my mind. "Phor Tak," I said, "you are
handicapped by lack of knowledge of conditions existing in Jahar
and the size and location of the fleet. Nur An and I will go to
Jahar for you and obtain the information that you must have if your
plans are to be successful. In this way, Nur An and I will also be
striking a blow at Tul Axtar while we will be in a position to
attend to those matters which require our presence in Jahar."</p>

<p>"But how will you get to Jahar?" demanded Phor Tak.</p>

<p>"Could not you let us take a flier?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have none," replied Phor Tak. "I know nothing about them. I
am not interested in them. I could not even build one."</p>

<p>To say that I was both surprised and shocked would be putting it
mildly, but if I had previously entertained any doubts that Phor
Tak's brain was abnormally developed, it would have vanished with
his admission that he knew nothing about fliers, for it seemed to
me that there was scarcely a man, woman or child in any of the
flying nations of Barsoom but could have constructed some sort of a
flier.</p>

<p>"But how without fliers did you expect to transport The Flying
Death to the vicinity of the Jaharian fleet? How did you expect to
demolish the palace of Tul Axtar, or reduce the city of Jahar to
ruins?"</p>

<p>"Now that you and Nur An are here to help me, I can set my
slaves to work under you and easily turn out a dozen torpedoes a
day. As these are completed they will immediately be launched and
eventually they will find their way to Jahar and the fleet. Of that
there is no doubt, even if it takes a year they will eventually
find their prey."</p>

<p>"If nothing chances to get in their way," I suggested; "but even
so what pleasure will you derive from your revenge if you are
unable to witness any part of it?"</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo! I have thought of that," replied Phor Tak, "but one
may not have everything."</p>

<p>"You may have that," I told him.</p>

<p>"And how?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"By taking your torpedoes aboard a ship and flying to Jahar," I
replied.</p>

<p>"No," he exclaimed stubbornly, "I shall do it my own way. What
right have you to interfere with my plans?"</p>

<p>"I merely want to help you," I said, attempting to mollify him
by a conciliatory tone and attitude.</p>

<p>"And there is another thought," said Nur An, "that suggests that
it might be expedient to follow Hadron's plans."</p>

<p>"You are both against me," said Phor Tak.</p>

<p>"By no means," Nur An assured him. "It is our keen desire to aid
you that prompts the suggestion."</p>

<p>"Well, what is yours then?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Your plan contemplates the destruction of the navies of Tjanath
and Helium following the fall of Jahar," exclaimed Nur An. "This,
at least in respect to the navy of Helium, you cannot possibly hope
to accomplish at so great a distance and without any knowledge of
the number of ships to be destroyed, nor will your torpedoes be
similarly attracted to them as they are to the ships of Jahar
because the ships of these other nations are not protected by the
blue paint of Jahar. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to
proceed to the vicinity of Tjanath and later to Helium and for your
own protection you will use the blue paint of Jahar upon your ship,
for you may never be certain unless you are on the ground at the
time that you have destroyed all of the navy of Jahar, or all of
their disintegrating ray rifles."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Phor Tak thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And furthermore," continued Nur An, "if you dispatch more than
the necessary number of torpedoes, those that remain at large will
certainly be attracted by the blue paint of your own ship and you
will be destroyed by your own devices."</p>

<p>"You ruin all my plans," screamed Phor Tak. "Why did you think
of this?"</p>

<p>"If I had not thought of it you would have been destroyed," Nur
An reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well, what am I to do about it? I have no ship. I cannot build
a ship."</p>

<p>"We can get you one," I said.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>The conversation between Nur An and Phor Tak had suggested a
plan to me and this I now explained roughly to them. Nur An was
enthusiastic over the idea, but Phor Tak was not particularly keen
for it. I could not understand the grounds for his objection, nor,
as a matter of fact, did they interest me greatly since he finally
admitted that he would be compelled to act in accordance with my
suggestion.</p>

<p>Immediately adjacent to Phor Tak's laboratory was a well
equipped machine shop and here Nur An and I labored for weeks
utilizing the services of a dozen slaves until we had succeeded in
constructing what I am sure was the most remarkable looking airship
that it had ever fallen to my lot to behold. Briefly, it was a
cylinder pointed at each end and closely resembled the model of The
Flying Death. Within the outer shell was another smaller cylinder;
between the walls of these two we placed the buoyancy tanks. The
tanks and the sides of the two envelopes were pierced by
observation ports along each side of the ship and at the bow and
stern. These ports could be completely covered by shutters hinged
upon the outside, but operated from within. There were two
hatchways in the keel and two above which led to a narrow walkway
along the top of the cylinder. In turrets, forward, and aft were
mounted two disintegrating ray rifles. Above the controls was a
periscope that transmitted an image of all that came within its
range to a ground glass plate in front of the pilot. The entire
outside of the ship was first painted the ghastly blue that would
protect it from the disintegrating ray rifles of Jahar, while over
this was spread a coating of the compound of invisibility. The
shutters that covered the ports being similarly coated, the ship
could attain practically total invisibility by closing them, the
only point remaining visible being the tiny eye of the
periscope.</p>

<p>Not possessing sufficient technical knowledge to enable me to
build one of the new type motors, I had to content myself with one
of the old types of much less efficiency.</p>

<p>At last the work was done. We had a ship that would accommodate
four with ease and it was uncanny to realize this fact and yet, at
the same time, be unable to see anything but the tiny eye of the
periscope when the covers were lowered over the ports, and even the
eye of the periscope was invisible unless it was turned in the
direction of the observer.</p>

<p>As the work neared completion I had noticed that Phor Tak's
manner became more marked by nervousness and irritability. He found
fault with everything and on several occasions he almost stopped
the work upon the ship.</p>

<p>Now, at last, we were ready to sail. The ship was stocked with
ammunition, water and provisions, and at the last minute I
installed a destination control compass for which I was afterward
to be devoutly thankful.</p>

<p>When I suggested immediate departure, however, Phor Tak
demurred, but would give me no reason for his objection. Presently,
however, I lost patience and told the old man that we were going
anyway whether he liked it or not.</p>

<p>He did not fly into a rage as I had expected, but laughed
instead, and there was something in the laugh that seemed more
terrible than anger.</p>

<p>"You think I am a fool," he said, "and that I will let you go
and carry my secrets to Tul Axtar, but you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"So are you," I snapped. "You are mistaken in thinking that we
would betray you and you are also mistaken in thinking that you can
prevent our departure."</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" he cackled. "I do not need to prevent your
departure, but I can prevent your arrival at Jahar or elsewhere. I
have not been idle while you worked upon this ship. I have
constructed a full-size Flying Death. It is attuned to search out
this ship. If you depart against my wishes, it will follow and
destroy you. Heigh-oo! What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"I think that you are an old fool," I cried in exasperation.
"You have the opportunity to enlist the loyal aid of two honorable
warriors and yet you choose to turn them into enemies."</p>

<p>"Enemies who cannot harm me," he reminded me. "I hold your lives
in the hollow of my hand. Well have you concealed your thoughts
from me, but not quite well enough. I have read enough of them to
know that you think me mad and I have also received the impression
that you would stop at nothing to prevent me from using my power
against Helium. I have no doubt but that you will help me against
Jahar, and against Tjanath, too, perhaps, but Helium, the mightiest
and proudest empire of Barsoom, is my real goal. Helium shall
proclaim me Jeddak of Jeddaks if I have to wreck a world to
accomplish my design."</p>

<p>"Then all our work has been for nothing?" I demanded. "We are
not going to use the ship we have constructed?"</p>

<p>"We may use it," he said, "but under my terms."</p>

<p>"And what are they?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You may go alone to Jahar, but I shall keep Nur An here as
hostage. If you betray me, he dies."</p>

<p>There was no moving him; no amount of argument could alter his
determination. I tried to convince him that one man could
accomplish little, that, in fact, he might not be able to
accomplish anything, but he was adamant&mdash;I should go alone or
not at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; "LET THE FIRE BE
HOT!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS I arose that night into the starlit splendor of
a Barsoomian night, the white castle of Phor Tak lay a lovely gem
below me bathed in the soft light of Thuria. I was alone; Nur An
remained behind the hostage of the mad scientist. Because of him I
must return to Jhama. Nur An had exacted no promise from me, but he
knew that I would return.</p>

<p>Twenty-five hundred haads to the east lay Jahar and Sanoma Tora.
Fifteen hundred haads to the southwest were Tjanath and Tavia. I
turned the nose of my flier toward the goal of duty, toward the
woman I loved, and, with throttle wide, my invisible craft sped
toward distant Jahar.</p>

<p>But my thoughts I could not control. Despite my every effort to
keep them concentrated upon the purpose of my adventure, they
persisted in wandering to a prison tower, to a tousled head of
refractory hair, to a rounded shoulder that had once pressed mine.
I shook myself to be rid of the vision as I sped through the night,
but it constantly returned and in its wake came harrowing thoughts
of the fate that might have overtaken Tavia during my absence.</p>

<p>I set my destination control compass upon Jahar, the exact
position of which I had obtained from Phor Tak, and thus relieved
of the necessity of constantly remaining at the controls, I busied
myself about the interior of the ship. I looked to the ammunition
of the disintegrating ray rifles and rearranged it to suit my own
ideas.</p>

<p>Phor Tak had equipped me with three types of rays; one would
disintegrate metal, another would disintegrate wood and the third
would disintegrate human flesh. I had also brought along something
which Phor Tak had refused me when I had asked him for it. I
pressed the pocket pouch in which I had placed it to make sure that
I still had the vial, the contents of which I imagined might prove
of inestimable value to me.</p>

<p>I raised all the port shutters and adjusted the ventilators, for
at best the interior of this strange ship seemed close and stuffy
to one who was accustomed to the open deck of the fast scout fliers
of Helium. Then I spread my sleeping silks and furs and settled
myself down to rest, knowing that when I arrived at Jahar my
destination control compass would stop the ship and an alarm would
awaken me if I still slept, but sleep would not come. I thought of
Sanoma Tora. I visualized her cold and stately beauty, but always
her haughty eyes dissolved into the eyes of Tavia, sparkling with
the joy of life, soft with the light of friendship.</p>

<p>I was far from Jhama when at last I sprang determinedly from my
sleeping silks and furs, and going to the controls, I cut off the
destination control compass and with a single, swift turn swung the
nose of the flier toward Tjanath.</p>

<p>The die was cast. I felt that I should experience remorse and
self loathing, but I experienced neither. I joyed in the thought
that I was rushing to the service of a friend and I knew in the
most innermost recesses of my heart that of the two, Tavia had more
claim upon my friendship than had Sanoma Tora, from whom I had
received at best only scant courtesy.</p>

<p>I did not again try to sleep. I did not feel like sleeping;
instead I remained at the controls and watched the desolate
landscape as it rushed forward to pass beneath me. With the coming
of dawn I saw Tjanath directly ahead of me and as I approached the
city it was difficult for me to realize that I could do so with
utter impunity and that my ship with its closed ports was entirely
invisible. Moving slowly now, I circled above the palace of Haj
Osis. Those portions of the palace that were topped by flat roofs
revealed sleepy guardsmen. At the main hangar a single guardsman
watched.</p>

<p>I floated above the east tower; beneath me, cuddled in her
sleeping silks and furs, I could picture Tavia. How surprised she
would be could she know that I hovered thus close above her.</p>

<p>Dropping lower I circled the tower, coming to a stop finally
opposite the windows of the room in which Tavia had been confined.
I maneuvered the ship to bring one of the ports opposite the window
and close enough to give me a view of the interior of the room. But
though I remained there for some time, I could see no one and at
last I became convinced that Tavia had been removed to other
quarters. I was disappointed for this must necessarily greatly
complicate my plans for rescue. I had foreseen but little
difficulty in transferring Tavia by night through the tower window
to the flier; now I must make my plans all anew. Everything hinged,
of course, upon my ability to locate Tavia. To do that it was
evident that I must enter the palace. The moment that I quitted the
invisibility of my flier, I should be menaced by the greatest
danger at every turn, and, clothed as I was in home-made harness
fashioned by the hands of the slaves of Phor Tak, I should arouse
the active suspicion of the first person who laid eyes upon me.</p>

<p>I must enter the palace and to do it in any degree of safety I
must have a disguise.</p>

<p>All my ports were now closed, the periscope being my only eye. I
turned it slowly about as I tried to plan some method of procedure
that might have within it some tiny seed of success.</p>

<p>As the panorama slowly unfolded itself upon the ground glass
before me there appeared the main palace hangar and the single
warrior upon watch. Here my periscope came to rest, for here was an
entrance to the palace and here a disguise.</p>

<p>Slowly maneuvering my ship in the direction of the hangar, I
brought it down upon the roof of that structure. I should have been
glad to moor it, but here there were no means at hand. I must
depend upon its own weight and hope that no high wind would
rise.</p>

<p>Realizing that the instant that I emerged from the interior of
the flier I should be entirely visible, I waited, watching through
my periscope until the warrior upon the roof just below me turned
his back; then I emerged quickly from the ship through one of the
upper hatches and dropped to the roof upon the side closest to the
warrior. I was about four feet from the edge of the roof and he was
standing almost below me, his back toward me. Should he turn he
would discover me instantly and would give an alarm before I could
be upon him. My only hope of success, therefore, was to silence him
before he realized that he was menaced.</p>

<p>I have learned from the experiences of John Carter that first
thoughts are often inspirations, while sober afterthought may lead
to failure, or so delay action as to nullify all its effect.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this instance, I acted upon inspiration. I did not
hesitate. I stepped quickly to the edge of the roof and hurled
myself straight at the broad shoulders of the sentry. In my hand
was a slim dagger.</p>

<p>The end came quickly. I think the poor fellow never knew what
happened to him. Dragging his body to the interior of the hangar I
stripped the harness from it, at the same time, though almost
mechanically, I noted the ships within the hangar. With the
exception of one, a patrol boat, they all bore the personal
insignia of the Jed of Tjanath. They were the king's ships&mdash;an
ornate cruiser heavily armed, two smaller pleasure crafts, a
two-man scout flier and a one-man scout flier. They were not much,
of course, by comparison with the ships of Helium, but I was quite
sure that they were absolutely the best that Tjanath could afford.
However, having my own ship, I was not particularly concerned with
these other than that I am always interested in ships of all
descriptions.</p>

<p>Not far from where I stood was the entrance to a ramp leading
down into the palace. Realizing that only through boldness might I
succeed, I walked directly to the ramp and entered it. As I rounded
the first turn I was appalled to see that the ramp passed directly
through a guard room. Upon the floor fully a score of warriors were
stretched upon their sleeping silks and furs.</p>

<p>I did not dare to pause; I must keep on. Perhaps I could pass
them without arousing their curiosity. I had had but a brief
glimpse of the room before I entered it and in that glimpse I had
seen only men apparently wrapped in sleep and an instant later, as
I emerged into the room itself, I saw that it contained only those
whom I had first seen. No one within it was awake, but I heard
voices in an adjoining room. Hurrying quickly across the apartment
I entered the ramp upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>I think my heart had stood still as I strode silently across
that room among those sleeping men, for had a single one of them
awakened he would have inevitably known that I was no fellow member
of the guard.</p>

<p>Further down within the palace itself I should be in less
danger, for so great is the number of retainers in the palace of a
jed that no one may know them all by sight, so that strange and
unfamiliar faces are almost as customary as they are upon the
avenues of a city.</p>

<p>My plan was to try to reach the tower room in which Tavia had
been confined, for I was positive that, from my position in the
flier, I could not see the entire interior and it was just possible
that Tavia was there.</p>

<p>Owing to the construction of my ship I had been unable to
attract her attention without raising a hatch and taking the chance
of revealing my presence, which would have, I felt, jeopardized
Tavia's chances for escape far too greatly to warrant my doing
so.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have waited until night; perhaps I was
overanxious and in my zeal I might be running far greater risks
than were necessary. I thought of these things now and perhaps I
upbraided myself, but I had gone too far now to retreat. I was
properly in for it, whatever might follow.</p>

<p>As I followed the ramp down to different levels I tried to
discover some familiar landmark that might lead me to the east
tower, and as I emerged into a corridor at one of the levels I saw
almost directly in front of me a door which I instantly
recognized&mdash;it was the door to the office of Yo Seno, the
keeper of the keys.</p>

<p>"Good!" I thought. "Fate certainly has led me here."</p>

<p>Crossing to the door I opened it and stepped quickly within the
room, closing the door behind me. Yo Seno was sitting at his desk.
He was alone. He did not look up. He was one of those arrogant
men&mdash;a small man with a little authority&mdash;who liked to
impress his importance upon all inferiors. Therefore, doubtless, it
was his way to ignore his visitors for a moment or two. This time
he made a mistake. After quietly locking the door behind me I
crossed to the door at the opposite end of the room and bolted it,
too.</p>

<p>It was then that, doubtless compelled by curiosity, Yo Seno
looked up. At first he did not recognize me. "What do you want?" he
demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>"You, Yo Seno," I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a moment with growing astonishment,
then with his eyes wide he leaped to his feet. "You?" he screamed.
"By Issus, no! You are dead!"</p>

<p>"I have returned from the grave, Yo Seno. I have come back to
haunt you," I said.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he demanded. "Stand aside! You are under
arrest."</p>

<p>"Where is Tavia?" I asked.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You are the keeper of the keys, Yo Seno. Who should know better
than you where the prisoners are?"</p>

<p>"Well, what if I do know? I shall not tell," he said.</p>

<p>"You shall tell, Yo Seno, or you shall die." I warned him.</p>

<p>He had walked from behind his desk and was standing not far from
me when, without warning and with far greater celerity than I gave
him credit for possessing, he snatched his long sword from its
scabbard and was upon me.</p>

<p>I was forced to jump backward quickly to avoid his first cut,
but when he swung the second time my own sword was out and I was on
my guard. Yo Seno proved himself no mean antagonist. He was clever
with the sword and he knew that he was fighting for his life. I
wondered at first why he did not call for help and then I came to
the conclusion that it was because there were no warriors in the
adjoining room, as there had been upon my previous visit to Yo
Seno's quarters. We fought in silence, only the din of metal upon
metal reflecting the deadliness of the combat.</p>

<p>I was in a hurry to be done with him and I was pressing him
closely when he resorted to a trick which came near to proving my
undoing. I had backed him up against his desk and thought that I
had him where he could not escape. I could not see his left hand
behind him; nor the heavy vase for which it was groping, but an
instant later I saw the thing flying straight at my head and I also
saw the opening which Yo Seno made in the instant that he cast the
missile, for so occupied was he with his aim that he let his point
drop. Stooping beneath the vase I sprang into close quarters,
driving my sword through the heart of Yo Seno.</p>

<p>As I wiped the blood from my blade upon the hair of my victim I
could not repress a feeling of elation that it had been my hand
that had cut down the seducer of Phao and in some measure avenged
the honor of my friend, Nur An.</p>

<p>Now, however, was no time for meditation. I heard footsteps
approaching in the corridor without and hastily seizing the harness
of the corpse, I dragged it toward the panel which hid the entrance
to the secret corridor that led to the room in the east
tower&mdash;that familiar corridor where I had passed happy moments
alone with Tavia.</p>

<p>With more haste than reverence, I dumped the corpse of Yo Seno
into the dark interior and then, closing the panel after me, I
groped my way through the darkness toward the tower room, my heart
high with the hope that I might find Tavia still there.</p>

<p>As I approached the panel at the tower end of the corridor I
could feel my heart beating rapidly&mdash;a sensation to which I
was unaccustomed and which I could not explain. I was positive that
I was in excellent physical condition, and, while it is not at all
unusual that surprise or imminent danger causes the heart of some
men to palpitate, even though they may be endowed with exceptional
courage, yet, for my part, I had never experienced such a sensation
and I must admit that I was deeply mystified.</p>

<p>The anticipation of seeing Tavia again soon caused me to forget
the unpleasant sensation and as I stopped behind the panel my whole
mind was occupied with pleasurable consideration of what I hoped
awaited me beyond&mdash;the longed for reunion with this best of
friends.</p>

<p>I was upon the point of springing the catch and opening the
panel when my attention was attracted by voices from the room
beyond. I heard a man's voice and that of a woman, but I could
understand no words. Cautiously, I opened the panel sufficiently to
permit me to view the interior of the apartment.</p>

<p>The scene that met my gaze sent the hot fighting blood surging
through my frame. In the center of the room a young warrior in rich
trappings had Tavia in his grasp and was dragging her across the
room toward the doorway. Tavia struggled, striking at him.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," snarled the man. "Haj Osis has given you to
me. You will lead a better life as my slave than most free women
live."</p>

<p>"I prefer prison or death," replied Tavia.</p>

<p>Phao was standing helplessly at one side, her eyes filled with
compassion for Tavia. It was obvious that she could do nothing to
defend her friend, for the trappings of the warrior proclaimed him
of high rank, but just what that rank was I did not discern at the
time for I was not interested. In a bound I was in the center of
the room and seizing the warrior roughly by the shoulder, I hurled
him backward so heavily that he fell sprawling to the floor. I
heard gasps of astonishment from both Phao and Tavia and my name
breathed in the soft accents of the latter.</p>

<p>As I drew my sword the warrior scrambled to his feet, but did
not draw. "Fool! Idiot! Knave!" he shrieked. "Do you not realize
what you have done? Do you not know who I am?"</p>

<p>"In a moment it will be 'who you were'," I told him in a low
voice. "On guard!"</p>

<p>"No," he cried, backing away. "You wear the harness and the
metal of a warrior of the guard. You cannot dare draw your sword
against the son of Haj Osis. Back, fellow, I am Prince Haj
Alt."</p>

<p>"I could pray to Issus that you might be Haj Osis himself," I
replied, "but at least there will be some recompense in the
knowledge that I have destroyed his spawn. On guard, you fool,
unless you wish to die like a sorak."</p>

<p>He was still backing away and now he looked about him with every
evidence of terror written upon his weak countenance. He espied the
panel door that I had inadvertently left open and before I could
prevent he had darted through and closed it behind him. I leaped in
pursuit, but the lock had clicked and I did not know where to find
the mechanism to release it.</p>

<p>"Quick, Phao!" I cried. "You know the secret of the panel. Open
it for me. We must not permit this fellow to escape or he will
sound the alarm and we shall all be lost."</p>

<p>Phao ran quickly to my side and placed her thumb upon a button
cleverly hidden in the ornate carving of the wood paneling that
covered the wall. I waited in breathless expectancy, but the panel
did not open. Phao pushed frantically again and again, and then she
turned to me with a gesture of helplessness and defeat.</p>

<p>"He has tampered with the lock upon the other side," she said.
"He is a clever rogue and he would have thought of that."</p>

<p>"We must follow," I said, and raising my long sword I struck the
panel a heavy blow that would have shattered much thicker planking,
but I only made a scratch upon it, tearing away a little piece
scarce thicker than a fingernail, but the scar that I had made
revealed the harrowing truth&mdash;the panel was constructed of
forandus, the hardest and the lightest metal known to Barsoomians.
I turned away.</p>

<p>"It is useless," I said "to attempt to pierce forandus with cold
steel."</p>

<p>Tavia had crossed to us and was standing in silence, looking up
into my face. Her eyes were bathed with unshed tears and I saw her
lips tremble. "Hadron!" she breathed. "You have come back from the
dead. Oh, why did you come, for this time they will make no
mistake."</p>

<p>"You know why I came, Tavia," I told her.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, very soft and low.</p>

<p>"For friendship, Tavia," I replied; "for the best friend that a
man ever had."</p>

<p>At first she seemed surprised and then an odd little smile
curved her lips. "I would rather have the friendship of Hadron of
Hastor," she said, "than any other gift the world might give
me."</p>

<p>It was a nice thing for her to say and I certainly appreciated
it, but I did not understand that little smile. However, I had no
time then in which to solve riddles; the problem of our safety was
the all important question, and then it was that I thought of the
vial in my pocket pouch. I looked quickly about the room. In one
corner I espied a pile of sleeping silks and furs; something there
might answer my purpose; the contents of the vial might yet give us
all freedom if I had but time enough. I ran quickly across the room
and searched rapidly until I had found three pieces of fabric that
were at least best suited to my purpose than any of the others. I
opened my pocket pouch to withdraw the vial and at the same instant
I heard the pounding of running feet and the clank and clatter of
arms.</p>

<p>Too late! They were already at the door. I closed my pocket
pouch and waited. At first it was in my mind to take them on in
combat as they entered, but I put that idea aside as worse than
useless, since it could result in nothing but my death, whereas
time might conjure an opportunity to use the contents of the
vial.</p>

<p>The door swung open, fully fifty warriors were revealed in the
corridor without. A padwar of the guard entered followed by his
men. "Surrender!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"I have not drawn," I replied. "Come and take it."</p>

<p>"You admit that you are the warrior who attacked the prince, Haj
Alt?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I do," I replied.</p>

<p>"What have these women to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I do not know them. I followed Haj Alt here because I
thought that it would give me the opportunity that I have long
sought to kill him."</p>

<p>"Why did you want to kill him?" demanded the padwar. "What
grievance have you against the prince?"</p>

<p>"None," I replied. "I am a professional assassin and I was hired
by others."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I laughed at him, for I knew that he knew better than to ask a
professional assassin of Barsoom such a question as that. The
members of this ancient fraternity are guided by a code of ethics
which they scrupulously observe and seldom, if ever, can anything
persuade or force one of their number to divulge the name of his
principal.</p>

<p>I saw Tavia's eyes upon me and it seemed to me that there was a
little questioning expression in them, but I knew that she must
know that I was lying thus to protect her and Phao.</p>

<p>I was hustled from the chamber and as I was being conducted
along the corridors and down the ramps of the palace, the padwar
questioned me in an endeavor to learn my true identity. I was
greatly relieved to discover that they did not recognize me and I
hoped that I might continue to escape recognition, not that it
would make any difference in my fate for I realized that the direst
would be inflicted upon one who had attempted to assassinate the
prince of the house of Haj Osis, but I was afraid that were I to be
recognized they might accuse Tavia of complicity in the attack upon
Haj Alt and that she would be made to suffer accordingly.</p>

<p>Presently I found myself in the pits again and by chance in the
very cell that Nur An and I had occupied. I experienced almost the
sensations of a homecoming, but with variations. Once again I was
alone, fettered to a stone wall. My only hope, the vial which they
had overlooked and which still reposed at the bottom of my pocket
pouch. But this was no time or place to use its contents, nor had I
the requisite materials at hand even had I been unfettered.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>I was not long in the pits this time before warriors came and,
unlocking my fetters, conducted me to the great throne room of the
palace, where Haj Osis sat upon his dais surrounded by the high
officers and functionaries of his army and his court.</p>

<p>Haj Alt, the prince, was there and when he saw me being led up
toward the throne he trembled with rage. As I was halted in front
of the jed, he turned to his son. "Is this the warrior who attacked
you, Haj Alt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"This is the scoundrel," replied the younger man. "He took me by
surprise and would have stabbed me in the back had I not managed to
outwit him."</p>

<p>"He drew his sword against you," demanded Haj
Osis&mdash;"against the person of a prince?"</p>

<p>"He did and he would have killed me with it, too, as he did kill
Yo Seno, whose corpse I found in the corridor that leads from Yo
Seno's office to the tower."</p>

<p>So, they had found the body of Yo Seno. Well, they would not
kill me any deader for that crime than for menacing the life of the
prince.</p>

<p>At this juncture an officer entered the throne room rather
hurriedly. He was breathing rapidly as he stopped at the foot of
the throne. He was standing right beside me and I saw him turn and
look quickly at me, his eyes running rapidly up and down me between
head and feet. Then he addressed the man upon the throne.</p>

<p>"Haj Osis, Jed of Tjanath," he said, "I came quickly to tell you
that the body of a warrior of the hangar guard was just found
within the Jed's hangar. His harness had been stripped from him and
his weapons, while strange harness and strange weapons were left
beside his corpse and as I approached your throne, Haj Osis, I
recognized the harness of my dead warrior upon the body of this man
here," and he pointed an accusing finger at me.</p>

<p>Haj Osis was scrutinizing me very carefully now. There was a
strange look in his eyes that I did not like. It betokened half
recognition and then of a sudden I saw the dawning of full
recognition there, and the Jed of Tjanath swore a loud oath that
resounded through the great throne room.</p>

<p>"Breath of Issus!" he shouted. "Look at him! Do you not know
him? He is the spy from Jahar who called himself Hadron of Hastor.
He died The Death. With my own eyes I saw him, and yet he is back
here in my palace murdering my people and threatening my son, but
this time he shall die." Haj Osis had arisen from his throne and
with upraised hands that seemed to claw the air above me he
appeared like some hideous corphal pronouncing a curse upon its
victim. "But first we shall know who sent him here. He did not come
of his own volition to kill me and my son; behind him is some
malignant mind that yearns to destroy the Jed of Tjanath and his
family. Burn him slowly, but do not let him die until he has
divulged the name. Away with him! Let the fire be hot, but
slow."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE CLOAK OF
INVISIBILITY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Haj Osis, Jed of Tjanath, pronounced sentence
of death upon me I knew whatever I might do to save myself must be
done at once, for the instant that the guards laid hold upon me
again my final hope would have vanished for it was evident that the
torture and the death would take place immediately.</p>

<p>The warriors forming the guard that had escorted me from the
pits were lined up several paces behind me. The dais upon which Haj
Osis stood was raised but a little over three feet above the floor
of the throne room. Between me and the Jed of Tjanath there was no
one, for as he had sentenced me he had advanced from his throne to
the very edge of the platform.</p>

<p>The action that I took was not delayed as long as it has taken
me to tell it. Had it been, it could never have been taken for the
guards would have been upon me. Instantly the last word fell from
his mouth my plan was formulated and in that instant I leaped
cat-like to the dais, full upon Haj Osis, Jed of Tjanath. So
sudden, so unexpected was my attack that there was no defense. I
seized him by the throat with one hand and with the other I
snatched his dagger from its sheath and raising it above him I
shouted my warning in a voice that all might hear.</p>

<p>"Stand back, or Haj Osis dies!" I cried.</p>

<p>They had started to rush me, but as the full import of my threat
came home to them, they halted.</p>

<p>"It is my life, or yours, Haj Osis," I said, "unless you do what
I tell you to do."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, his face black with terror.</p>

<p>"Is there an anteroom behind the throne?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"Take me there alone," I said. "Command your people to stand
aside."</p>

<p>"And let you kill me when you get me there?" he demanded,
trembling.</p>

<p>"I shall kill you now if you do not," I replied. "Listen, Haj
Osis, I did not come here to kill you or your son. What I told the
padwar of the guard was a lie. I came for another purpose, far
transcending in importance to me the life of Haj Osis or that of
his son. Do as I tell you and I promise that I shall not kill you.
Tell your people that we are going into the anteroom and that I
promise not to harm you if we are left alone there for five xats
(about fifteen minutes)."</p>

<p>He hesitated. "Make haste," I said, "I have no time to waste,"
and I let the point of his own dagger touch his throat.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he screamed, shrinking back. "I will do whatever you
say. Stand back all of you!" he shouted to his people. "I am going
to the anteroom with this warrior and I command you upon pain of
death not to enter there for five xats. At the end of that time,
come; but not before."</p>

<p>I took a firm hold upon Haj Osis' harness between his shoulders
and I kept the point of his dagger pressed against the flesh
beneath his left shoulder blade as I followed him toward the
anteroom, while those who had crowded the dais behind the throne
fell back to make an aisle for us. At the doorway I halted and
turned toward them.</p>

<p>"Remember," I said, "five full xats and not a tal before."</p>

<p>Entering the anteroom I closed and bolted the door, and then,
still forcing Haj Osis ahead of me, I crossed the room and closed
and bolted the only other door to the chamber. Then I pushed the
Jed to one side of the room.</p>

<p>"Lie down here upon your face," I said.</p>

<p>"You promised not to kill me," he wailed.</p>

<p>"I shall not kill you unless they come before the five xats are
up and you do otherwise than as I bid you so as not to delay me. I
am going to bind you, but it will not hurt you."</p>

<p>With poor grace he lay down upon his belly and with his own
harness I strapped his arms together behind his back. Then I
blindfolded him and left him lying there.</p>

<p>As I had entered the room I had taken in its contents with a
single, quick glance and I had seen there precisely the things that
I most needed, and now that I had disposed of Haj Osis I crossed
quickly to one of the windows and tore down a part of the silk
hangings that covered it. It was a full length of fine, light silk
and very wide, since it had been intended to hang in graceful folds
as an under-drape with heavier hangings. At the ornate desk where
the Jed of Tjanath signed his decrees, I went to work. First I took
the vial from my pocket pouch and unstoppered it; then I wadded the
silk into a ball and because of its wonderful fineness I could
compress it within my two hands. Fastening the ball of silk into a
loosely compressed mass with strips torn from another hanging, I
slowly poured the contents of the vial over it, turning the ball
with the point of Haj Osis' dagger. Remembering Phor Tak's warning,
I was careful not to let any of the contents of the vial come in
contact with my flesh and I could readily see why one had to be
careful as I watched the ball of silk disappear before my eyes.</p>

<p>Knowing that the compound of invisibility would dry almost as
rapidly as it impregnated the silk, I waited only a brief instant
after emptying about half the contents of the vial upon the ball.
Then, groping with my fingers, I found the strings that held it
into its roughly spherical shape and cut them, after which I shook
the silk out as best I could. For the most part it was invisible,
but there were one or two spots that the compound had not reached.
These I quickly daubed with some of the liquid remaining in my
pocket pouch.</p>

<p>So much depended upon the success of my experiment that I almost
feared to put it to the test, but it must be tested and there could
be only a few xats remaining before the warriors of Haj Osis would
burst into the antechamber.</p>

<p>By feel alone I draped the silk over my head so that it fell all
about me. Through its thin and delicate meshes I could see objects
at close range quite well enough to make my way about. I crossed to
Haj Osis and took the blind from his eyes, at the same time
stepping quickly back. He looked hurriedly and affrightedly about
him.</p>

<p>"Who did that?" he demanded, and then half to himself, "he is
gone." For a moment he was silent, rolling his eyes about in all
directions, searching every nook and corner of the apartment. Then
an expression that was part hope and part relief came to his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he shouted in a loud voice. "The guard! He has
escaped!"</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief&mdash;if Haj Osis could not see me,
no one could&mdash;my plan had succeeded.</p>

<p>I dared not return to the throne room and make my escape that
way along corridors with which I was familiar for I could already
hear the rush of feet toward the anteroom door and I was well aware
that, although they could not see me, they could feel me and that
unquestionably in the rush my mantle of invisibility, or at least a
portion of it, would be torn from me, which would indubitably spell
my doom.</p>

<p>I ran quickly to the other doorway and unbolted it and as I
opened it I looked back at Haj Osis. His eyes were upon the doorway
and they were wide with incredulity and horror. For an instant I
did not realize the cause and looked quickly behind me to see if I
could see what had caused Haj Osis' fright and then it dawned upon
me and I smiled. He had seen and heard the bolt shot and the door
open as though by ghostly hands.</p>

<p>He must have sensed a vague suspicion of the truth, for he
turned quickly toward the other door and screamed a warning in a
high falsetto voice. "Do not enter," he cried, "until the five xats
are up. It is I who commands&mdash;Haj Osis, the Jed."</p>

<p>Closing the door after me and still smiling, I hastened along
the corridor, searching for a ramp that would carry me to the upper
levels of the palace from which I could easily locate the guard
room and the hangar where I had left my ship.</p>

<p>The corridor I had entered led directly into the royal
apartments.</p>

<p>At first it was difficult to accustom myself to my invisibility
and as I suddenly entered an apartment in which there were several
people, my first impulse was to turn and flee, but though I had
stepped directly into the view of one of the occupants of the room
and at a distance of little more than five or six feet without
attracting his attention, although his eyes were apparently
directly upon me, my confidence was quickly restored. I continued
on across the room as nonchalantly as though I had been in my own
quarters in Helium.</p>

<p>The royal apartments seemed interminable and though I was
constantly seeking a way out of them into one of the main corridors
of the palace, I was instead constantly stumbling into places where
I did not care to be and where I had no business, sometimes with
considerable embarrassment, as when I entered a cozy, private
apartment in the women's quarters at a moment when I was convinced
they were not expecting strange gentlemen.</p>

<p>I would not turn back, however, for I had no time to lose, and
crossing the room I followed another short corridor only to leap
from the frying pan into the fire&mdash;I had entered the forbidden
apartment of the Jeddara herself. It is a good thing for the royal
lady that it was I and not Haj Osis who came thus unexpectedly upon
her, for her position was most compromising, and from his harness I
judged that her good looking companion was a slave. In disgust I
retreated, for there was no other exit from the apartment, and
presently I stumbled, entirely by accident, upon one of the main
corridors of the palace&mdash;a busy corridor filled with slaves,
warriors and courtiers, with men, women and children passing to and
fro upon whatever business called them, or perhaps seated upon the
carved benches that lined the walls.</p>

<p>I was not yet accustomed to my new and surprising state of
invisibility. I could see the people about me and it seemed
inevitable that I must be seen. For a moment I had hesitated in the
doorway that had led me to the corridor. A slave girl, approaching
along the corridor, turned suddenly toward the doorway where I
stood. She was looking directly at me, yet her gaze appeared to
pass entirely through me. For an instant I was filled with
consternation, and then, realizing that she was about to collide
with me, I stepped quickly to one side. She passed by me, but it
was evident that she sensed my presence for she paused and looked
quickly about, an expression of surprise in her eyes. Then, to my
immense relief, she passed through the doorway. She had not seen
me, though doubtless she had heard me as I stepped aside. With a
feeling of renewed confidence I now joined the throng in the
corridor, threading my way in and out among the people to avoid
contact with them and searching diligently all the while for the
entrance to a ramp leading upward. This I presently discovered, and
it was not long thereafter that I reached the upper level of the
palace, where a short search brought me to the guard room at the
foot of the ramp leading to the royal hangars.</p>

<p>Idling in the guard room, the warriors then off duty were
engaged in various pursuits. Some where cleaning their harness and
polishing their metal; two were playing at jetan, while others were
rolling tiny numbered spheres at a group of numbered holes&mdash;a
fascinating game of chance, called yano, which is, I presume,
almost as old as Barsoomian civilization. The room was filled with
the laughter and oaths of fighting men. How alike are warriors the
world over! But for their harness and their metal they might have
been a detachment of the palace guard at Helium.</p>

<p>Passing among them I ascended the ramp to the roof where the
hangars stood. Two warriors on duty at the top of the ramp almost
blocked my further progress. It would be a narrow squeeze to pass
between them and I feared detection. As I paused I could not but
overhear their conversation.</p>

<p>"I tell you that he was struck from behind," said one. "He never
knew what killed him," and I knew that they were talking about the
guardsman I had killed.</p>

<p>"But from whence came his assassin?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"The padwar believes it may have been a fellow member of the
guard. There will be an investigation and we shall all be
questioned."</p>

<p>"It was not I," said the other. "He was my best friend."</p>

<p>"Nor was it I."</p>

<p>"He had a way with women. Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>My attention was distracted and their conversation terminated by
the footsteps of a warrior running rapidly up the ramp. My position
was now most precarious. The ramp was narrow and the man coming
from behind might easily bump into me. I must, therefore, pass the
sentries immediately and make my way to the roof. There was just
sufficient room between the warrior at my left and the sidewall of
the ramp for me to pass through, if he did not step back, and with
all the stealth that I could summon I edged myself slowly behind
him and you may rest assured that I breathed a sigh of relief when
I had passed him.</p>

<p>The warrior ascending the ramp had now reached the two men. "The
assassin of the hangar sentry has been discovered," he said.</p>

<p>"He is none other than the spy from Jahar who called himself
Hadron of Hastor and who, with the other spy, Nur An, was sentenced
to die The Death. Through some miracle he escaped and has returned
to the palace of Haj Osis. Besides the hangar sentry, he has slain
Yo Seno, but he was captured after attacking the prince, Haj Alt.
Again he has escaped and he is now at large in the palace. The
padwar of the guard has sent me to direct you to redouble your
watchfulness. Great will be the reward of him who captures Hadron
of Hastor, dead or alive."</p>

<p>"By my metal, I'd like to see him try to escape this way," said
one of the sentries.</p>

<p>"He'll never come here by daylight."</p>

<p>I smiled as I walked quickly toward the hangar. To reach the
roof without disarranging my robe of invisibility was difficult,
but I finally accomplished it. Before me lay the empty roof; no
ship was in sight, but I smiled again to myself, knowing well that
it was there. I looked about for the eye of the periscope that
would reveal the craft's presence to me, but it was not visible.
However, that did not concern me greatly since I realized that it
might be turned in the opposite direction. It was only necessary
for me to walk where I had left the ship, and this I did, feeling
ahead of me with extended hands.</p>

<p>I crossed the roof from one side to the other, but found no
ship. That I was perplexed goes without saying. I most certainly
knew where I had left the ship, but it no longer was there. Perhaps
a wind had moved it slightly, and with this thought in mind I
searched another section of the roof, but with equal
disappointment. By now I was truly apprehensive, and thereupon I
set about a systematic search of the roof until I had covered every
square foot of it and was convinced beyond doubt that the worst of
disasters had befallen me&mdash;my ship was gone; but where? Indeed
the compound of invisibility had its drawbacks. My ship might be
and probably was at no great distance from me, yet I could not see
it. A gentle wind was blowing from the southwest. If my ship had
risen from the roof, it would drift in a northeasterly direction,
but though I strained my eyes toward that point of the compass I
could discern nothing of the tiny eye of the periscope.</p>

<p>I must admit that for a moment I was well-nigh discouraged. It
seemed that always when success was about within my grasp some
malign fate snatched it from me, but presently I shook this weak
despondency from me and with squared shoulders faced the future and
whatever it might bring.</p>

<p>For a few moments I considered my position in all its aspects
and sought to discover the best solution of my problem. I must
rescue Tavia, but I felt that it would be useless to attempt to do
so without a ship, therefore I must have a ship, and I knew that
ships were just beneath me in the royal hangars. At night these
hangars would be closed and locked and watched over by sentries in
the bargain. If I would have a ship I must take it now and depend
upon the swiftness and boldness of my act for its success.</p>

<p>Royal fliers are usually fast fliers and if the ships of Haj
Osis were no exception to this general Barsoomian rule, I might
hope to outdistance pursuit could I but pass the hangar sentry.</p>

<p>Of one thing I was certain, I could not accomplish that by
remaining upon the roof of the hangar and so I cautiously
descended, choosing a moment when the attention of the sentries was
directed elsewhere, for there was always danger that my robe might
blow aside, revealing my limbs.</p>

<p>Once on the roof again I slipped quickly into the hangar and
inspecting the ships I selected one that I was sure would carry
four with ease, and which, from its lines, gave token of
considerable speed.</p>

<p>Clambering to the deck I took my place at the controls; very
gradually I elevated the ship about a foot from the floor; then I
opened the throttle wide.</p>

<p>Directly ahead of me, through the open doorways of the hangar,
the sentries were standing upon the opposite side of the room. As
the ship leaped into the sunlight they voiced simultaneously a cry
of surprise and alarm. Like brave warriors they sprang forward with
drawn long swords and I could see that they were going to try to
board me before I could gain altitude, but presently one of them
halted wide-eyed and stood aside.</p>

<p>"Blood of our first ancestors!" he cried. "There is no one at
the controls."</p>

<p>The second man had evidently discovered this simultaneously, for
he, too, shrank aside, and with whirling propeller I shot upward
from the royal hangar of the Jed of Tjanath.</p>

<p>But only for an instant were the two sentries overwhelmed by
astonishment. Immediately I heard the shriek of sirens and the
clang of great gongs and then, glancing behind, I saw that already
they had launched a flier in pursuit. It was a two-man flier and
almost immediately I realized that it was far swifter than the one
I had chosen, and then to make matters even worse for me I saw
patrol boats arising from hangars located elsewhere upon the palace
roof. That they all saw my ship and were converging upon it was
evident; escape seemed impossible; each way I turned a patrol boat
was approaching; already I had been driven into an ascending
spiral, my eyes constantly alert for any avenue of escape that
might open to me.</p>

<p>How hopeless it looked! My ship was too slow; my pursuers too
many.</p>

<p>It would not be long now, I thought, and at that very instant I
saw something off my port bow at a little greater altitude that
gave me one of the greatest thrills I had ever experienced in my
life. It was only a little round eye of glass, but to me it meant
life and more than life, for it might mean also life and happiness
for Tavia&mdash;and of course for Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>A patrol boat coming diagonally from below was almost upon me as
I drew my flier beneath that floating eye, judging the distance so
nicely that I just had clearance for my head beneath the keel of my
own ship. Locating one of the hatches, which were so constructed
that they opened either from the inside or the out, I scrambled
quickly into the interior of the Jhama, as Phor Tak had christened
it.</p>

<p>Closing the hatch and springing to the controls, I rose quickly
out of immediate danger. Then, standing to one side, I watched my
former pursuers.</p>

<p>I could read the consternation in their faces as they came
alongside the royal flier that I had stolen, and realized that it
was unmanned. Not having seen either me or my ship, they must have
been hard put to it to find any sort of an explanation for the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>As I watched them I found it constantly necessary to change my
position, owing to the number of patrol boats and other craft that
were congregating. I did not wish to leave the vicinity of the
palace entirely for it was my intention to remain here until after
dark when I should make an attempt to take Tavia and Phao aboard
the Jhama. I also had it in my mind to reconnoiter the east tower
during the day and try to get into communication with Tavia if
possible. It was already the fifth zode. In fifty xats (three
hours) the sun would set.</p>

<p>I wished to initiate my plan of rescue as soon after dark as
possible, as experience had taught me that plans do not always
develop as smoothly in execution as they do in contemplation.</p>

<p>A warrior from one of the patrol ships had boarded the royal
craft that I had purloined and was returning it to the hangar. Some
of the ships were following and others were returning to their
stations. A single patrol boat remained cruising about and as I
watched it I suddenly became aware that a young officer standing
upon its deck had espied the eye of my periscope. I saw him
pointing toward it and immediately thereafter the craft altered its
course and came directly toward me. This was not so good and I lost
no time in moving to one side, turning the eye of my periscope away
from them so that they could not see it or follow me.</p>

<p>I moved a short distance out of their course and then swung my
periscope toward them again. To my astonishment I discovered that
they, too, had altered their course and were following me.</p>

<p>Now I rose swiftly and took a new direction, but when I looked
again the craft was bearing down upon me and not only that, but she
was training a gun on me.</p>

<p>What had happened? It was evident that something had gone wrong
and that I was no longer clothed in total invisibility, but
whatever it was, it was too late now to rectify it even if I could.
I had but a single recourse and I prayed to my first ancestor that
it might not now be too late to put it into execution. Should they
fire upon me, I was lost.</p>

<p>I brought the Jhama to a full stop and sprang quickly aft to
where the rear rifle was mounted on a platform just within the
after turret.</p>

<p>In that instant I had occasion to rejoice in the foresight that
had prompted me to rearrange the projectiles properly against the
necessity for instant use in such an emergency as this. Selecting
one, I jammed it into the chamber and closed the breech block.</p>

<p>The turret, crudely and hastily constructed though it had been,
responded to my touch and an instant later my sight covered the
approaching patrol vessel, and through the tiny opening provided
for the sight I witnessed the effect of my first shot with Phor
Tak's disintegrating ray rifle.</p>

<p>I had used a metal disintegrating projectile and the result was
appalling.</p>

<p>I loved a ship and it tore my heart to see that staunch craft
fall apart in midair as its metal parts disappeared before the
disintegrating ray.</p>

<p>But that was not all, as wood and leather and fabric sank with
increasing swiftness toward the ground, brave warriors hurtled to
their doom. It was horrifying.</p>

<p>I am a true son of Barsoom; I joy in battle; armed conflict is
my birthright, and war the goal of my ambition, but this was not
war; it was murder.</p>

<p>I took no joy in my victory as I had when I laid Yo Seno low in
mortal combat, and now, more than ever, was I determined that this
frightful instrument of destruction must in some way be forever
banned upon Barsoom. War with such a weapon completely hidden by
the compound of invisibility would be too horrible to contemplate.
Navies, cities, whole nations could be wiped out by a single battle
thus equipped. The mad dream of Phor Tak might easily come true and
a maniac yet rule all Barsoom.</p>

<p>But meditation and philosophizing were not for me at this time.
I had work to do and though it necessitated wiping out all Tjanath,
I purposed doing it.</p>

<p>Again the sirens and the gongs raised their wild alarm; again
patrol boats gathered. I felt that I must depart until after
nightfall, for I had no stomach to again be forced to turn that
deadly rifle upon my fellow men while any alternative existed.</p>

<p>As I started to turn back to the controls my eyes chanced to
fall upon one of the stern ports and, to my surprise, I saw that
the shutter was raised. How this occurred I do not know; it has
always remained a mystery, but at least it explained how it had
been possible for the patrol boat to follow me. That round port
hole moving through the air must have filled them with wonder, but
at the same time it was a clue to follow and though they did not
understand it, they, like the brave warriors that they were,
followed it in the line of their duty.</p>

<p>I quickly closed it, and, after examining the others and finding
them all closed, I was now confident that, with the exception of
the small eye of my periscope, I was entirely surrounded by
invisibility and hence under no immediate necessity for leaving the
vicinity of the palace, as I could easily maneuver the ship to keep
out of the way of the patrol boats that were now again congregating
near the royal hangar.</p>

<p>I think they were pretty much upset by what had happened and
evidently there was no unanimity of opinion as to what should be
done. The patrol ships hovered about, evidently waiting orders, and
it was not until almost dark that they set out in a systematic
search of the air above the city; nor had they been long at this
before I understood their orders as well as though I had read them
myself. The lower ships moved at an altitude of not over fifty feet
above the higher buildings; two hundred feet above these moved the
second line. The ships at each level cruised in a series of
concentric circles and in opposite directions, thereby combing the
air above the city so closely that no enemy ship could possibly
approach. The air below was watched by a thousand eyes; at every
point of vantage sentries were on watch and upon the roof of every
public building guns appeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>I began to be quite apprehensive that even the small eye of my
periscope might not go undetected and so I dropped my ship into a
little opening among some lofty trees that grew within the palace
garden, and here I waited some twenty feet above the ground, my
periscope completely screened from view, unseen and, in
consequence, myself unseeing, until the swift night of Barsoom
descended upon Tjanath; then I rose slowly from my leafy
retreat.</p>

<p>Above the trees I paused to have a look about me through the
periscope. Far above me were the twinkling lights of the circling
patrol boats and from a thousand windows of the palace shone other
lights. Before me rose the dark outlines of the east tower
silhouetted against the starry sky.</p>

<p>Rising slowly I circled the tower until I had brought the Jhama
opposite Tavia's window.</p>

<p>My ship carried no lights, of course, and I had not switched on
any of the lights within her cabin, so that I felt that I might
with impunity raise one of the upper hatches, and this I did. The
Jhama lay with her upper deck a foot or two beneath the sill of
Tavia's window. Before venturing from below I replaced my cloak of
invisibility about me.</p>

<p>There was no light in Tavia's room. I placed my ear close
against the iron bars and listened. I could hear no sound. My heart
sank within me. Could it be that they had removed her to some other
part of the palace? Could it be that Haj Alt had come and taken her
away? I shuddered at the mere suggestion and cursed the luck that
had permitted him to escape my blade.</p>

<p>With all those eyes and ears straining through the darkness I
feared to make the slightest sound, though I felt that there was
little likelihood that the open hatch would be noticed in the
surrounding darkness; yet I must ascertain whether or not Tavia was
within that room. I leaned close against the bars and whispered her
name. There was no response.</p>

<p>"Tavia!" I whispered, this time much louder, and it seemed to me
that my voice went booming to high heaven in tones that the dead
might hear.</p>

<p>This time I heard a response from the interior of the room. It
sounded like a gasp and then I heard someone
moving&mdash;approaching the window. It was so dark in the interior
that I could see nothing, but presently I heard a voice close to
me.</p>

<p>"Hadron! Where are you?"</p>

<p>She had recognized my voice. For some reason I thrilled to the
thought of it. "Here at the window, Tavia," I said.</p>

<p>She came very close. "Where?" she asked. "I cannot see you."</p>

<p>I had forgotten my robe of invisibility. "Never mind," I said.
"You cannot see me, but I will explain that later. Is Phao with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And no one else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am going to take you with me, Tavia&mdash;you and Phao. Stand
aside well out of line of the window so that you will not be hurt
while I remove the bars. Then be ready to board my ship
immediately."</p>

<p>"Your ship!" she said. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind now. There is a ship here. Do just as I tell you. Do
you trust me?"</p>

<p>"With my life, Hadron, forever," she whispered.</p>

<p>Something within me sang. It was more than a mere thrill; I
cannot explain it; nor did I understand it, but now there were
other things to think of.</p>

<p>"Stand aside quickly, Tavia, and keep Phao away from the window
until I call you again." Dimly I could see her figure for a moment
and then I saw it withdraw from the window. Returning to the
controls I brought the forward turret of the ship opposite the
window, upon the bars of which I trained the rifle. I loaded it and
pressed the button. Through the tiny sight aperture and because of
the darkness I could see nothing of the result, but I knew
perfectly well what had happened, and when I lowered the ship again
and went on deck I found that the bars had vanished in thin
air.</p>

<p>"Quick, Tavia," I said. "Come!"</p>

<p>With one foot upon the deck of the flier and the other upon the
sill of the window, I held the ship close to the wall of the tower
and as best I could I held the cloak of invisibility like a canopy
to shield the girls from sight as they boarded the Jhama.</p>

<p>It was difficult and risky business. I wished I might have had
grappling hooks, but I had none and so I must do the best I could,
holding the cloak with one hand and assisting Tavia to the sill
with the other.</p>

<p>"There is no ship," she said in slightly frightened tone.</p>

<p>"There is a ship, Tavia," I said. "Think only of your confidence
in me and do as I bid." I grasped her firmly by the harness where
the straps crossed upon her back.</p>

<p>"Have no fear," I said and then I swung her out over the hatch
and lowered her gently into the interior of the Jhama.</p>

<p>Phao was behind her and I must give her credit for being as
courageous as Tavia. It must have been a terrifying experience to
those two girls to feel that they were being lowered into thin air
a hundred feet above the ground, for they could see no
ship&mdash;only a darker hole within the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>As soon as they were both aboard, I followed them, closing the
hatch after me.</p>

<p>They were huddled in the darkness on the floor of the cabin,
weak and exhausted from the brief ordeal through which they had
just passed, but I could not take the time then to answer the
questions with which I knew their heads must be filled.</p>

<p>If we passed the watchers on the roofs and the patrol boats
above, there would be plenty of time for questions and answers. If
we did not, there would be no need for either.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; TUL AXTAR'S
WOMEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITH propellers moving only enough to give us
headway, we moved slowly and silently from the tower. I did not
dare to rise to the altitude of the circling fliers for fear of
almost inevitable collision, owing to the limited range of
visibility permitted by the periscope, and so I held to a course
that carried me only above the roof of the lower part of the palace
until I reached a broad avenue that led in an easterly direction to
the outer wall of the city. I kept well down below the roofs of the
buildings, where there was little likelihood of encountering other
craft. Our only danger of detection now, and that was slight
indeed, was that our propeller might be overheard by some of the
watchers on the roofs, but the hum and drone of the propellers of
the ships above the city must have drowned out whatever slight
sound our slowly revolving blades gave forth, and at last we came
to the gate at the end of the avenue, and rising to top its
battlements, we passed out of Tjanath into the night beyond. The
lights of the city and of the circling patrol boats above grew
fainter and fainter as we left them far behind.</p>

<p>We had maintained absolute silence during our escape from the
city, but as soon as our escape appeared assured, Tavia unlocked
the flood gates of her curiosity. Phao's first question was
relative to Nur An. Her sigh of relief held as great assurance of
her love for him as could words have done. The two listened in
breathless attention to the story of our miraculous escape from The
Death. Then they wanted to know all about the Jhama, the compound
of invisibility and the disintegrating ray with which I had
dissolved the bars from their prison window. Nor was it until their
curiosity had been appeased that we were able to discuss our plans
for the future.</p>

<p>"I feel that I should go at once to Jahar," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tavia in a low voice. "It is your duty. You must go
there first and rescue Sanoma Tora."</p>

<p>"If there was only some place where I might leave you and Phao
in safety, I should feel that I could carry on this mission with
far greater peace of mind, but I know of no other place than Jhama
and I hesitate to return there and let Phor Tak know that I failed
to go immediately to Jahar as I had intended. The man is quite
insane. There is no telling what he might do if he learns the
truth; nor am I certain that you two would be safe there in his
power. He trusts only his slaves and he might easily become
obsessed with an hallucination that you are spies."</p>

<p>"You need not think of me at all," said Tavia, "for no matter
where you might find a place to leave us, I should not remain. The
place of the slave is with her master."</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Tavia. You are not my slave."</p>

<p>"I am a slave girl," she replied. "I must be someone's slave. I
prefer to be yours."</p>

<p>I was touched by her loyalty, but I did not like to think of
Tavia as a slave; yet however much I might loathe the idea the fact
remained that she was one. "I give you your freedom, Tavia," I
said.</p>

<p>She smiled. "I do not want it and now that it is decided that I
am to remain with you" (she had done all the deciding), "I wish to
learn all that I can about navigating the Jhama, for it may be that
in that way I may help you."</p>

<p>Tavia's knowledge of aerial navigation made the task of
instructing her simple indeed; in fact she had no trouble
whatsoever in handling the craft.</p>

<p>Phao also manifested an interest and it was not long before she,
too, took her turn at the controls, while Tavia insisted upon being
inducted into all the mysteries of the disintegrating ray
rifle.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>Long before we saw the towers of Tul Axtar's capital, we sighted
a one-man flier painted the ghastly blue of Jahar, and then far to
the right and to the left we saw others. They were circling slowly
at a great altitude. I judged that they were scouts watching for
the coming of an expected enemy fleet. We passed below them and a
little later encountered the second line of enemy ships. These were
all scout cruisers, carrying from ten to fifteen men. Approaching
one of them quite closely I saw that it carried four disintegrating
ray rifles, two mounted forward and two aft. As far as I could see
in either direction these ships were visible, and if, as I
presumed, they formed a circle entirely about Jahar, they must have
been numerous indeed.</p>

<p>Passing on beyond them we presently encountered the third line
of Jaharian ships. Here were stationed huge battleships, carrying
crews of a thousand men and more and fairly bristling with big
guns.</p>

<p>While none of these ships was as large as the major ships of
Helium, they constituted a most formidable force and it was obvious
that they had been built in great numbers.</p>

<p>What I had already seen impressed me with the fact that Tul
Axtar was entertaining no idle dream in his contemplated subjection
of all Barsoom. With but a fraction of the ships I had already seen
I would guarantee to lay waste all of Barsoom, provided my ships
were armed with disintegrating ray rifles, and I felt sure that I
had seen but a pitiful fraction of Tul Axtar's vast armament.</p>

<p>The sight of all these ships filled me with the direct
forebodings of calamity. If the fleet of Helium had not already
arrived and been destroyed, it certainly must be destroyed when it
did arrive. No power on earth could save it. The best that I could
hope, had the fleet already arrived, was that an encounter with the
disintegrating ray rifles of the first line might have proved
sufficient warning to turn the balance of the fleet back.</p>

<p>Far behind the line of battleships I could see the towers of
Jahar rising in the distance, and as we reached the vicinity of the
city I descried a fleet of the largest ships I have ever seen,
resting upon the ground just outside the city wall. These ships,
which completely encircled the city wall that was visible to us,
must have been capable of accommodating at least ten thousand men
each, and from their construction and their light armaments, I
assumed them to be transports. These, doubtless, were to carry the
hordes of hungry Jaharian warriors upon the campaign of loot and
pillage that it was planned should destroy a world.</p>

<p>Contemplation of this vast armada prompted me to abandon all
other plans and hasten at once to Helium, that the alarm might be
spread and plans be made to thwart the mad ambition of Tul Axtar.
My mind was a seething caldron of conflicting demands upon me.
Countless times had I risked my life to reach Jahar for but a
single purpose and now that I had arrived I was called upon to turn
back for the fulfillment of another purpose&mdash;a larger, a more
important one, perhaps, but I am only human and so I turned first
to the rescue of the woman that I loved, determined immediately
thereafter to throw myself wholeheartedly into the prosecution of
the other enterprise that duty and inclination demanded of me. I
argued that the slight delay that would result would in no way
jeopardize the greater cause, while should I abandon Sanoma Tora
now there was little likelihood that I would ever be able to return
to Jahar to her succor.</p>

<p>With the great ghastly blue fleet of Jahar behind us, we topped
the city's walls and moved in the direction of the palace of the
jeddak.</p>

<p>My plans were well formulated. I had discussed them again and
again with Tavia, who had grown up in the palace of Tul Axtar.</p>

<p>At her suggestion we were to maneuver the Jhama to a point
directly over the summit of a slender tower, upon which there was
not room to land the flier, but through which I could gain ingress
to the palace at a point close to the quarters of the women.</p>

<p>As we had passed through the three lines of Jaharian ships,
protected by our coating of the compound of invisibility, so we
passed the sentries on the city wall and the warriors upon watch in
the towers and upon the ramparts of the palace of the towers and
upon the ramparts of the palace of the jeddak, and without incident
worthy of note I stopped the Jhama just above the summit of the
tower that Tavia indicated.</p>

<p>"In about ten xats (<i>approximately thirty minutes</i>) it will
be dark," I said to Tavia. "If you find it impractical to remain
here constantly, try and return when dark has fallen, for whether I
am successful in finding Sanoma Tora I shall not attempt to return
to the Jhama until night has fallen."</p>

<p>She had told me that there was a possibility that the women's
quarters might be locked at sunset and for this reason I was
entering the palace by daylight, though I should have much
preferred not to risk it until after nightfall. Tavia had also
assured me that if I once entered the women's quarters I would have
no difficulty in leaving even after they were locked, as the doors
could be opened from the inside, the precaution of locking being
taken not for fear that the inmates would leave the quarters, but
to protect them against the dangers of assassins and others with
evil intent.</p>

<p>Adjusting the robe of invisibility about me, I raised the
forward keel hatch, which was directly over the summit of the tower
that had once been used as a lookout in some distant age before
newer and loftier portions of the palace had rendered it useless
for this purpose.</p>

<p>"Good-bye and good luck," whispered Tavia. "When you return I
hope that you will bring your Sanoma Tora with you. While you are
gone I shall pray to my ancestors for your success."</p>

<p>Thanking her, I lowered myself through the hatch to the summit
of the tower, in which was set a small trap door.</p>

<p>As I raised this door I saw below me the top of the ancient
ladder that long dead warriors had used and which evidently was
seldom, if ever, used now as was attested by the dust upon its
rungs. The ladder led me down to a large room in the upper level of
this portion of the palace&mdash;a room that had doubtless
originally been a guard room, but which was now the receptacle for
odds and ends of discarded furniture, hangings and ornaments.
Filled as it was with specimens of the craftsmanship of ancient
Jahar, together with articles of more modern fabrication, it would
have been a most interesting room to explore; yet I passed through
it with nothing more than a single searching glance for live
enemies. Closely following Tavia's instructions I descended two
spiral ramps, where I found myself in a most ornately decorated
corridor, opening upon which were the apartments of the women of
Tul Axtar. The corridor was long, stretching away fully a thousand
sofads to a great, arched window at the far end, through which I
could see the waving foliage of trees.</p>

<p>Many of the countless doors that lined the corridor on either
side were open or ajar, for the corridor itself was forbidden to
all but the women and their slaves, with the exception of Tul
Axtar. The foot of the single ramp leading to it from the level
below was watched over by a guard of picked men, composed
exclusively of eunuchs, and Tavia assured me that short shrift was
made of any adventurous spirit who sought to investigate the
precincts above; yet here was I, a man and an enemy, safely within
the forbidden territory.</p>

<p>As I looked about me in attempt to determine where to commence
my investigation, several women emerged from one of the apartments
and approached me along the corridor. They were beautiful women,
young and richly trapped, and from their light conversation and
their laughter I judged that they were not unhappy. My conscience
pricked me as I realized the mean advantage that I was taking of
them, but it could not be avoided and so I waited and listened,
hoping that I might overhear some snatch of conversation that would
aid me in my quest for Sanoma Tora; but I learned nothing from them
other than that they referred to Tul Axtar contemptuously as the
old zitidar. Some of their references to him were extremely
personal and none was complimentary.</p>

<p>They passed me and entered a large room at the end of the
corridor. Almost immediately thereafter other women emerged from
other apartments and followed the first party into the same
apartment.</p>

<p>It soon became evident to me that they were congregating there
and I thought that perhaps this might be the best way in which to
start my search for Sanoma Tora&mdash;perhaps she, too, might be
among the company.</p>

<p>Accordingly I fell in behind one of the groups and followed it
through the large doorway and a short corridor, which opened into a
great hall that was so gorgeously appointed and decorated as to
suggest the throne room of a jeddak, and in fact such appeared to
have been a part of its purpose, for at one end rose an enormous,
highly-carved throne.</p>

<p>The floor was highly polished wood, in the center of which was a
large pool of water. Along the sides of the room were commodious
benches, piled with pillows and soft silks and furs. Here it was
that Tul Axtar occasionally held unique court, surrounded solely by
his women. Here they danced for him; here they disported themselves
in the limpid waters of the pool for his diversion; here banquets
were spread and to the strains of music high revelry persisted long
into the night.</p>

<p>As I looked about me at those who had already assembled I saw
that Sanoma Tora was not among them and so I took my place close to
the entrance where I might scrutinize the face of each who
entered.</p>

<p>They were coming in droves now. I believe that I have never seen
so many women alone together before. As I watched for Sanoma Tora I
tried to count them, but I soon gave it up as hopeless, though I
estimated that fully fifteen hundred women were congregated in the
great hall when at last they ceased to enter.</p>

<p>They seated themselves upon the benches about the room, which
was filled with a babel of feminine voices. There were women of all
ages and of every type, but there was none that was not beautiful.
The secret agents of Tul Axtar must have combed the world for such
an aggregation of loveliness as this.</p>

<p>A door at one side of the throne opened and a file of warriors
entered. At first I was surprised because Tavia had told me that no
men other than Tul Axtar ever were permitted upon this level, but
presently I saw that the warriors were women dressed in the harness
of men, their hair cut and their faces painted, after the fashion
of the fighting men of Barsoom. After they had taken their places
on either side of the throne, a courtier entered by the same
door&mdash;another woman masquerading as a man.</p>

<p>"Give thanks!" she cried. "Give thanks! The Jeddak comes!"</p>

<p>Instantly the women arose and a moment later Tul Axtar, Jeddak
of Jahar, entered the hall, followed by a group of women disguised
as courtiers.</p>

<p>As Tul Axtar lowered his great bulk into the throne, he signaled
for the women in the room to be seated. Then he spoke in a low
voice to a woman courtier at his side.</p>

<p>The woman stepped to the edge of the dais. "The great Jeddak
designs to honor you individually with his royal observation," she
announced in stilted tones. "From my left you will pass before him,
one by one. In the name of the Jeddak, I have spoken."</p>

<p>Immediately the first woman at the left arose and walked slowly
past the throne, pausing in front of Tul Axtar long enough to turn
completely about, and then walked slowly on around the apartment
and out through the doorway beside which I stood. One by one in
rapid succession the others followed her. The whole procedure
seemed meaningless to me. I could not understand it&mdash;then.</p>

<p>Perhaps a hundred women had passed before the Jeddak and come
down the long hall toward me when something in the carriage of one
of them attracted my attention as she neared me, and an instant
later I recognized Sanoma Tora. She was changed, but not greatly
and I could not understand why it was that I had not discovered her
in the room previously. I had found her! After all these long
months I had found her&mdash;the woman I loved. Why did my heart
not thrill?</p>

<p>As she passed through the doorway leading from the great hall, I
followed her and along the corridor to an apartment near the far
end, and when she entered, I entered behind her. I had to move
quickly, too, for she turned immediately and closed the door after
her.</p>

<p>We were alone in a small room, Sanoma Tora and I. In one corner
were her sleeping silks and furs; between two windows was a carved
bench upon which stood those toilet articles that are essential to
a woman of Barsoom.</p>

<p>It was not the apartment of a Jeddara; it was little better than
the cell of a slave.</p>

<p>As Sanoma Tora crossed the room listlessly toward a stool which
stood before the toilet bench, her back was toward me and I dropped
the robe of invisibility from about me.</p>

<p>"Sanoma Tora!" I said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Startled, she turned toward me. "Hadron of Hastor!" she
exclaimed; "or am I dreaming?"</p>

<p>"You are not dreaming, Sanoma Tora. It is Hadron of Hastor."</p>

<p>"Why are you here? How did you get here? It is impossible. No
men but Tul Axtar are permitted upon this level."</p>

<p>"Here I am, Sanoma Tora, and I have come to take you back to
Helium&mdash;if you wish to return."</p>

<p>"Oh name of my first ancestor, if I could but hope," she
cried.</p>

<p>"You may hope, Sanoma Tora," I assured her. "I am here and I can
take you back."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it," she said. "I cannot imagine how you
gained entrance here. It is madness to think that two of us could
leave without being detected."</p>

<p>I threw the cloak about me. "Where are you, Tan Hadron? What has
become of you? What has happened?" cried Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>"This is how I gained entrance," I explained. "This is how we
shall escape." I removed the cloak from about me.</p>

<p>"What forbidden magic is this?" she demanded, and, as best I
might in few words, I explained to her the compound of invisibility
and how I had come by it.</p>

<p>"How have you fared here, Sanoma Tora?" I asked her. "How have
they treated you?"</p>

<p>"I have not been ill treated," she replied; "no one has paid any
attention to me." I could scent the wounded vanity in her tone.
"Until tonight I had not seen Tul Axtar. I have just come from the
hall where he holds court among his women."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I know. I was there. It was from there that I
followed you here."</p>

<p>"When can you take me away?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Very quickly now," I replied.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that it will have to be quickly," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"When I passed Tul Axtar he stopped me for a moment and I heard
him speak to one of the courtiers at his side. He told her to
ascertain my name and where I was quartered. The women have told me
what happens after Tul Axtar has noticed one of us, and I am
afraid; but what difference does it make, I am only a slave."</p>

<p>What a change had come over the haughty Sanoma Tora! Was this
the same arrogant beauty who had refused my hand? Was this the
Sanoma Tora who had aspired to be a jeddara? She was humbled
now&mdash;I read it in the droop of her shoulders, in the trembling
of her lips, in the fear-haunted light that shone from her
eyes.</p>

<p>My heart was filled with compassion for her, but I was
astonished and dismayed to discover that no other emotion
overwhelmed me. The last time that I had seen Sanoma Tora I would
have given my soul to have been able to take her into my arms. Had
the hardships that I had undergone so changed me? Was Sanoma Tora,
a slave, less desirable to me than Sanoma Tora, daughter of the
rich Tor Hatan? No; I knew that that could not be true. I had
changed, but doubtless it was only a temporary metamorphosis
induced by the nervous strain which I was undergoing consequent
upon the responsibility imposed upon me by the necessity for
carrying word to Helium in time to save her from destruction at the
hands of Tul Axtar&mdash;to save not only Helium, but a world. It
was a grave responsibility. How might one thus burdened have time
for thoughts of love? No, I was not myself; yet I knew that I still
loved Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>Realizing the necessity for haste, I made a speedy examination
of the room and discovered that I could easily effect Sanoma Tora's
rescue by taking her through the window, just as I had taken Tavia
and Phao from the east tower at Tjanath.</p>

<p>Briefly, but carefully, I explained my plan to her and bid her
prepare herself while I was gone that there might be no delay when
I was ready to take her aboard the Jhama.</p>

<p>"And now, Sanoma Tora," I said, "for a few moments, goodbye! The
next that you will hear will be a voice at your window, but you
will see no one nor any ship. Extinguish the light in your room and
step to the sill. I will take your hand. Put your trust in me then
and do as I bid."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Hadron!" she said. "I cannot express now in adequate
words the gratitude that I feel, but when we are returned to Helium
there is nothing you can demand of me that I shall not grant you,
not only willingly, but gladly."</p>

<p>I raised her fingers to my lips and had turned toward the door
when Sanoma Tora laid a detaining hand upon my arm. "Wait!" she
said. "Someone is coming."</p>

<p>Hastily I resumed my cloak of invisibility and stepped to one
side of the room as the door, leading into the corridor, was thrown
open, revealing one of the female courtiers of Tul Axtar in
gorgeous harness. The woman entered the room and stepped to one
side of the doorway which remained opened.</p>

<p>"The Jeddak! Tul Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar!" she announced.</p>

<p>A moment later Tul Axtar entered the room, followed by half a
dozen of his female courtiers. He was a gross man with repulsive
features, which reflected a combination of strength and weakness,
of haughty arrogance, of pride and of doubt&mdash;an innate
questioning of his own ability.</p>

<p>As he faced Sanoma Tora his courtiers formed behind him.</p>

<p>They were masculine looking women, who had evidently been
selected because of this very characteristic. They were good
looking in a masculine way and their physiques suggested that they
might prove a very effective bodyguard for the Jeddak.</p>

<p>For several minutes Tul Axtar examined Sanoma Tora with
appraising eyes. He came closer to her and there was that in his
attitude which I did not like, and when he laid a hand upon her
shoulder, I could scarce restrain myself.</p>

<p>"I was not wrong," he said. "You are gorgeous. How long have you
been here?"</p>

<p>She shuddered, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"You are from Helium?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"The ships of Helium are on their way to Jahar." He laughed. "My
scouts bring word that they will soon be here. They will meet with
a warm welcome from the great fleet of Tul Axtar." He turned to his
courtiers. "Go!" he said, "and let none return until I summon
her."</p>

<p>They bowed and retired, closing the door after them, and then
Tul Axtar laid his hand again upon the bare flesh of Sanoma Tora's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "I shall not war with all of Helium&mdash;with
you I shall love&mdash;by my first ancestor, but you are worthy the
love of a jeddak."</p>

<p>He drew her toward him. My blood boiled&mdash;so hot was my
anger that it boiled over and without thought of the consequences I
let the cloak fall from me.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE CANNIBALS OF
U-GOR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS I dropped the cloak of invisibility aside I
drew my long sword and as it slithered from its sheath, Tul Axtar
heard and faced me. His craven blood rushed to his heart and left
his face pale at the sight of me. A scream was in his throat when
my point touched him in warning.</p>

<p>"Silence!" I hissed.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>Even in the instant my plans were formed. I made him turn with
his back toward me and then I disarmed him, after which I bound him
securely and gagged him.</p>

<p>"Where can I hide him, Sanoma Tora?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There is a little closet here," she said, pointing toward a
small door in one side of the room, and then she crossed to it and
opened it, while I dragged Tul Axtar behind her and cast him into
the closet&mdash;none too gently I can assure you.</p>

<p>As I closed the closet door I turned to find Sanoma Tora white
and trembling. "I am afraid," she said. "If they come back and find
him thus, they will kill me."</p>

<p>"His courtiers will not return until he summons them," I
reminded her. "You heard him tell them that such were his
wishes&mdash;his command."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Here is his dagger," I told her. "If worse comes to worst you
can hold them off by threatening to kill Tul Axtar," but the girl
seemed terrified, she trembled in every limb and I feared that she
might fail if put to the test. How I wished that Tavia were here. I
knew that she would not fail, and, in the name of my first
ancestor, how much depended upon success!</p>

<p>"I shall return soon," I said, as I groped about the floor for
the robe of invisibility. "Leave that large window open and when I
return, be ready."</p>

<p>As I replaced the cloak about me I saw that she was trembling so
that she could not reply; in fact, she was even having difficulty
in holding the dagger, which I expected momentarily to see drop
from her nerveless fingers, but there was naught that I could do
but hasten to the Jhama and try to return before it was too
late.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>I gained the summit of the tower without incident. Above me
twinkled the brilliant stars of a Barsoomian night, while just
above the palace roof hung the gorgeous planet, Jasoom (Earth).</p>

<p>The Jhama, of course, was invisible, but so great was my
confidence in Tavia that when I stretched a hand upward I knew that
I should feel the keel of the craft and sure enough I did. Three
times I rapped gently upon the forward hatch, which was the signal
that we had determined upon before I had entered the palace.
Instantly the hatch was raised and a moment later I had clambered
aboard.</p>

<p>"Where is Sanoma Tora?" asked Tavia.</p>

<p>"No questions now," I replied. "We must work quickly. Be ready
to take over the controls the moment that I leave them."</p>

<p>In silence she took her place at my side, her soft shoulder
touching my arm, and in silence I dropped the Jhama to the level of
the windows in the women's quarters. In a general way I knew the
location of Sanoma Tora's apartment, and as I moved slowly along I
kept the periscope pointed toward the windows and presently I saw
the figure of Sanoma Tora upon the ground glass before me. I
brought the Jhama close to the sill, her upper deck just below
it.</p>

<p>"Hold her here, Tavia," I said. Then I raised the upper hatch a
few inches and called to the girl within the room.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice she trembled so that she almost dropped
the dagger, although she must have known that I was coming and had
been awaiting me.</p>

<p>"Darken your room," I whispered to her. I saw her stagger across
to a button that was set in the wall and an instant later the room
was enveloped in darkness. Then I raised the hatch and stepped to
the sill. I did not wish to be bothered with the enveloping folds
of the mantle of invisibility and so I had folded it up and tucked
it into my harness, where I could have it instantly ready for use
in the event of an emergency. I found Sanoma Tora in the darkness
and so weak with terror was she that I had to lift her in my arms
and carry her to the window, where with Phao's help I managed to
draw her through the open hatch into the interior. Then I returned
to the closet where Tul Axtar lay bound and gagged. I stopped and
cut the bonds which held his ankles.</p>

<p>"Do precisely as I tell you, Tul Axtar," I said, "or my steel
will have its way yet and find your heart. It thirsts for your
blood, Tul Axtar, and I have difficulty in restraining it, but if
you do not fail me perhaps I shall be able to save you yet. I can
use you, Tul Axtar, and upon your usefulness to me depends your
life, for dead you are no value to me."</p>

<p>I made him rise and walk to the window and there I assisted him
to the sill. He was terror-stricken when I tried to make him step
out into space, as he thought, but when I stepped to the deck of
the Jhama ahead of him and he saw me apparently floating there in
the air, he took a little heart and I finally succeeded in getting
him aboard.</p>

<p>Following him I closed the hatch and lighted a single dim light
within the hull. Tavia turned and looked at me for orders.</p>

<p>"Hold her where she is, Tavia," I said.</p>

<p>There was a tiny desk in the cabin of the Jhama where the
officer of the ship was supposed to keep his log and attend to any
other records or reports that it might be necessary to make. Here
were writing materials, and as I got them out of the drawer in
which they were kept, I called Phao to my side.</p>

<p>"You are of Jahar." I said. "You can write in the language of
your country?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said.</p>

<p>"Then write what I dictate," I instructed her.</p>

<p>She prepared to do my bidding.</p>

<p>"If a single ship of Helium is destroyed," I dictated, "Tul
Axtar dies. Now sign it Hadron of Hastor, Padwar of Helium."</p>

<p>Tavia and Phao looked at me and then at the prisoner, their eyes
wide in astonishment, for in the dim light of the ship's interior
they had not recognized the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Tul Axtar of Jahar!" breathed Tavia incredulously. "Tan Hadron
of Hastor, you have saved Helium and Barsoom tonight."</p>

<p>I could not but note how quickly her mind functioned, with what
celerity she had seen the possibilities that lay in the possession
of the person of Tul Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar.</p>

<p>I took the note that Phao had written, and, returning quickly to
Sanoma Tora's room, I laid it upon her dressing table. A moment
later I was again in the cabin of the Jhama and we were rising
swiftly above the roofs of Jahar.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>Morning found us beyond the uttermost line of Jaharian ships,
beneath which we had passed, guided by their lights&mdash;evidence
to me that the fleet was poorly officered, for no trained man,
expecting an enemy in force, would show lights aboard his ships at
night.</p>

<p>We were speeding now in the direction of far Helium, following
the course that I hoped would permit us to intercept the fleet of
the Warlord in the event that it was already bound for Jahar as Tul
Axtar had announced.</p>

<p>Sanoma Tora had slightly recovered her poise and control of her
nerves. Tavia's sweet solicitude for her welfare touched me deeply.
She had soothed and quieted her as she might have soothed and
quieted a younger sister, though she herself was younger than
Sanoma Tora, but with the return of confidence Sanoma Tora's old
haughtiness was returning and it seemed to me that she showed too
little gratitude to Tavia for her kindliness, but I realized that
that was Sanoma Tora's way, that it was born in her and that
doubtless deep in her heart she was fully appreciative and
grateful. However that may be, I cannot but admit that I wished at
the time that she would show it by some slight word or deed. We
were flying smoothly, slightly above the normal altitude of
battleships. The destination control compass was holding the Jhama
to her course, and after all that I had passed through, I felt the
need of sleep. Phao, at my suggestion, had rested earlier in the
night, and as all that was needed was a lookout to keep a careful
watch for ships, I entrusted this duty to Phao, and Tavia and I
rolled up in our sleeping silks and furs and were soon asleep.</p>

<p>Tavia and I were about mid-ship, Phao was forward at the
controls, constantly swinging the periscope to and fro searching
the sky for ships. When I retired Sanoma Tora was standing at one
of the starboard ports looking out into the night, while Tul Axtar
lay down in the stern of the ship. I had long since removed the gag
from his mouth, but he seemed too utterly cowed even to address us
and lay there in morose silence, or perhaps he was asleep, I do not
know.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly fatigued and must have slept like a log from
the moment that I laid down until I was suddenly awakened by the
impact of a body upon me. As I struggled to free myself, I
discovered to my chagrin that my hands had been deftly bound while
I slept, a feat that had been rendered simple by the fact that it
is my habit to sleep with my hands together in front of my
face.</p>

<p>A man's knee was upon my chest, pressing me heavily against the
deck and one of his hands clutched me by the throat. In the dim
light of the cabin I saw that it was Tul Axtar and that his other
hand held a dagger.</p>

<p>"Silence!" he whispered. "If you would live, make no sound," and
then to make assurance doubly sure he gagged me and bound my
ankles. Then he crossed quickly to Tavia and bound her, and as he
did so my eyes moved quickly about the interior of the cabin in
search of aid. On the floor, near the controls, I saw Phao lying
bound and gagged as was I. Sanoma Tora crouched against the wall,
apparently overcome by terror. She was neither bound nor gagged.
Why had she not warned me? Why had she not come to my help? If it
had been Tavia who remained unbound instead of Sanoma Tora, how
different would have been the outcome of Tul Axtar's bid for
liberty and revenge.</p>

<p>How had it all happened? I was sure that I had bound Tul Axtar
so securely that he could not possibly have freed himself, and yet
I must have been mistaken and I cursed myself for the carelessness
that had upset all my plans and that might easily eventually spell
the doom of Helium.</p>

<p>Having disposed of Phao, Tavia and me, Tul Axtar moved quickly
to the controls, ignoring Sanoma Tora as he passed by her. In view
of the marked terror that she displayed, I could readily understand
why he did not consider her any menace to his plans&mdash;she was
as harmless to him free as bound.</p>

<p>Putting the ship about he turned back toward Jahar and though he
did not understand the mechanism of the destination control compass
and could not cut it out, this made no difference as long as he
remained at the controls, the only effect that the compass might
have being to return the ship to its former course should the
controls be again abandoned while the ship was in motion.</p>

<p>Presently he turned toward me. "I should destroy you, Hadron of
Hastor," he said, "had I not given the word of a jeddak that I
would not."</p>

<p>Vaguely I had wondered to whom he had given his word that he
would not kill me, but other and more important thoughts were
racing through my mind, crowding all else into the background.
Uppermost among them, of course, were plans for regaining control
of the Jhama and, secondarily, apprehension as to the fate of
Tavia, Sanoma Tora and Phao.</p>

<p>"Give thanks for the magnanimity of Tul Axtar," he continued,
"who exacts no penalty for the affront you have put upon him.
Instead you are to be set free. I shall land you." He laughed.
"Free! I shall land you in the province of U-Gor!"</p>

<p>There was something nasty in the tone of his voice which made
his promise sound more like a threat. I had never heard of U-Gor,
but I assumed that it was some remote province from which it would
be difficult or impossible for me to make my way either to Jahar or
Helium. Of one thing I was confident&mdash;that Tul Axtar would not
set me free any place that I might become a menace to him.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>For hours the Jhama moved on in silence. Tul Axtar had not had
the decency or the humanity to remove our gags. He was engrossed
with the business of the controls, and Sanoma Tora, crouching
against the side of the cabin, never spoke; nor once in all that
time did her eyes turn toward me. What thoughts were passing in
that beautiful head? Was she trying to find some plan by which she
might turn the tables upon Tul Axtar, or was she merely crushed by
the hopeless outlook&mdash;the prospect of being returned to the
slavery of Jahar? I did not know; I could not guess; she was an
enigma to me.</p>

<p>How far we traveled or in what direction, I did not know. The
night had long since passed and the sun was high when I became
aware that Tul Axtar was bringing the ship down. Presently the
purring of the motor ceased and the ship came to a stop. Leaving
the controls he walked back to where I lay.</p>

<p>"We have arrived in U-Gor," he said. "Here I shall set you at
liberty, but first give me the strange thing that rendered you
invisible in my palace."</p>

<p>The cloak of invisibility! How had he learned of that? Who could
have told him? There seemed but one explanation, but every fiber of
my being shrank even from considering it. I had rolled it up into a
small ball and tucked it into the bottom of my pocket pouch, its
sheer silk permitting it to be compressed into a very small space.
He took the gag from my mouth.</p>

<p>"When you return to your palace at Jahar," I said, "look upon
the floor beneath the window in the apartment that was occupied by
Sanoma Tora. If you find it there you are welcome to it. As far as
I am concerned it has served its purpose well."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave it there?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I was in a great hurry when I quit the palace and accidents
will happen." I will admit that my lie may not have been very
clever, but neither was Tul Axtar and he was deceived by it.</p>

<p>Grumbling, he opened one of the keel hatches and very
unceremoniously dropped me through it. Fortunately the ship lay
close to the ground and I was not injured. Next he lowered Tavia to
my side, and then he, himself, descended to the ground. Stooping,
he cut the bonds that secured Tavia's wrists.</p>

<p>"I shall keep the other," he said. "She pleases," and somehow I
knew that he meant Phao. "This one looks like a man and I swear
that she would be as easy to subdue as a she banth. I know the
type. I shall leave her with you." It was evident that he had not
recognized Tavia as one of the former occupants of the women's
quarters in his palace and I was glad that he had not.</p>

<p>He re-entered the Jhama, but before he closed the hatch he spoke
to us again. "I shall drop your weapons when we are where you
cannot use them against me and you may thank the future Jeddara of
Jahar for the clemency I have shown you!"</p>

<p>Slowly the Jhama rose. Tavia was removing the cords from her
ankles and when she was free she came and fell to work upon the
bonds that secured me, but I was too dazed, too crushed by the blow
that had been struck me to realize any other fact than that Sanoma
Tora, the woman I loved, had betrayed me, for I fully realized now
what any one but a fool would have guessed before&mdash;that Tul
Axtar had bribed her to set him free by the promise that he would
make her Jeddara of Jahar.</p>

<p>Well, her ambition would be fulfilled, but at what a hideous
cost. Never, if she lived for a thousand years could she look upon
herself or her act with aught but contempt and loathing, unless she
was far more degraded than I could possibly believe. No; she would
suffer, of that I was sure; but that thought gave me no pleasure. I
loved her and I could not even now wish her unhappiness.</p>

<p>As I sat there on the ground, my head bowed in misery, I felt a
soft arm steal about my shoulders and a tender voice spoke close to
my ear. "My poor Hadron!"</p>

<p>That was all; but those few words embodied such a wealth of
sympathy and understanding that, like some miraculous balm, they
soothed the agony of my tortured heart.</p>

<p>No one but Tavia could have spoken them. I turned and taking one
of her little hands in mine, I pressed it to my lips. "Loved
friend," I said. "Thanks be to all my ancestors that it was not
you."</p>

<p>I do not know what made me say that. The words seemed to speak
themselves without my volition, and yet when they were spoken there
came to me a sudden realization of the horror that I would have
felt had it been Tavia who had betrayed me. I could not even
contemplate it without an agony of pain. Impulsively I took her in
my arms.</p>

<p>"Tavia," I cried, "promise me that you will never desert me. I
could not live without you."</p>

<p>She put her strong, young arms about my neck and clung to me.
"Never this side of death," she whispered, and then she tore
herself from me and I saw that she was weeping.</p>

<p>What a friend! I knew that I could never again love a woman, but
what cared I for that if I could have Tavia's friendship for
life.</p>

<p>"We shall never part again, Tavia," I said. "If our ancestors
are kind and we are permitted to return to Helium, you shall find a
home in the house of my father and a mother in my mother."</p>

<p>She dried her eyes and looked at me with a strange wistful
expression that I could not fathom, and then, through her tears,
she smiled&mdash;that odd, quizzical little smile that I had seen
before and that I did not understand any more than I understood a
dozen of her moods and expressions, which made her so different
from other girls and which, I think, helped to attract me toward
her. Her characteristics lay not all upon the surface&mdash;there
were depths and undercurrents which one might not easily fathom.
Sometimes when I expected her to cry, she laughed; and when I
thought she should be happy, she wept, but she never wept as I have
seen other women weep&mdash;never hysterically, for Tavia never
lost control of herself, but quietly as though from a full heart
rather than from over-wrought nerves, and through her tears there
might burst a smile at the end.</p>

<p>I think that Tavia was quite the most wonderful girl that I have
ever known and as I had come to know her better and see more of
her, I had grown to realize that despite her attempt at mannish
disguise to which she still clung, she was quite the most beautiful
girl that I had ever seen. Her beauty was not like that of Sanoma
Tora, but as she looked up into my face now the realization came to
me quite suddenly, and for what reason I do not know, that the
beauty of Tavia far transcended that of Sanoma Tora because of the
beauty of the soul that, shining through her eyes, transfigured her
whole countenance.</p>

<p>Tul Axtar, true to his promise, dropped our weapons through a
lower hatch of the Jhama and as we buckled them on we listened to
the rapidly diminishing sound of the propellers of the departing
craft. We were alone and on foot in a strange and, doubtless, an
unhospitable country.</p>

<p>"U-Gor!" I said. "I have never heard of it. Have you,
Tavia?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "This is one of the outlying provinces of
Jahar. Once it was a rich and thriving agricultural country, but as
it fell beneath the curse of Tul Axtar's mad ambition for man
power, the population grew to such enormous proportions that U- Gor
could not support its people. Then cannibalism started. It began
justly with the eating of the officials that Tul Axtar had sent to
enforce his cruel decrees. An army was dispatched to subdue the
province, but the people were so numerous that they conquered the
army and ate the warriors. By this time their farms were ruined.
They had no seed and they had developed a taste for human flesh.
Those who wished to till the ground were set upon by bands of
roving men and devoured. For a hundred years they have been feeding
upon one another until now it is no longer a populous province, but
a wasteland inhabited by roving bands, searching for one another
that they may eat."</p>

<p>I shuddered at her recital. It was obvious that we must escape
this accursed place as rapidly as possible. I asked Tavia if she
knew the location of U-Gor and she told me that it lay southeast of
Jahar, about a thousands haads and about two thousand haads
southwest of Xanator.</p>

<p>I saw that it would be useless to attempt to reach Helium from
here. Such a journey on foot, if it could be accomplished at all,
would require years. The nearest friendly city toward which we
could turn was Gathol, which I estimated lay some seven thousand
haads almost due north. The possibility of reaching Gathol seemed
remote in the extreme, but it was our only hope and so we turned
our faces toward the north and set out upon our long and seemingly
hopeless journey toward the city of my mother's birth.</p>

<p>The country about us was rolling, with here and there a range of
low hills, while far to the north I could see the outlines of
higher hills against the horizon. The land was entirely denuded of
all but noxious weeds, attesting the grim battle for survival waged
by its unhappy people. There were no reptiles; no insects; no
birds&mdash;all had been devoured during the century of misery that
had lain upon the land.</p>

<p>As we plodded onward through this desolate and depressing waste,
we tried to keep up one another's spirit as best we could and a
hundred times I had reason to give thanks that it was Tavia who was
my companion and no other.</p>

<p>What could I have done under like circumstances burdened with
Sanoma Tora? I doubt that she could have walked a dozen haads,
while Tavia swung along at my side with the lithe grace of perfect
health and strength. It takes a good man to keep up with me on a
march, but Tavia never lagged; nor did she show signs of fatigue
more quickly than I.</p>

<p>"We are well matched, Tavia," I said.</p>

<p>"I had thought of that&mdash;a long time ago," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>We continued on until almost dusk without seeing a sign of any
living thing and were congratulating ourselves upon our good
fortune when Tavia glanced back, as one of us often did.</p>

<p>She touched my arm and nodded toward the rear. "They come!" she
said simply.</p>

<p>I looked back and saw three figures upon our trail. They were
too far away for me to be able to do more than identify them as
human beings. It was evident that they had seen us and they were
closing the distance between us at a steady trot.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Tavia. "Stand and fight, or try to
elude them until night falls?"</p>

<p>"We shall do neither," I said. "We shall elude them now without
exerting ourselves in the least."</p>

<p>"How?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Through the inventive genius of Phor Tak, and the compound of
invisibility that I filched from him."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Tavia. "I had forgotten your cloak. With
it we should have no difficulty in eluding all dangers between here
and Gathol."</p>

<p>I opened my pocket pouch and reached in to withdraw the cloak.
It was gone! As was the vial containing the remainder of the
compound. I looked at Tavia and she must have read the truth in my
expression.</p>

<p>"You have lost it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, it has been stolen from me," I replied.</p>

<p>She came again and laid her hand upon my arm in sympathy and I
knew that she was thinking what I was thinking, that it could have
been none other than Sanoma Tora who had stolen it.</p>

<p>I hung my head. "And to think that I jeopardized your safety,
Tavia, to save such as she."</p>

<p>"Do not judge her hastily," she said. "We cannot know how sorely
she may have been tempted, or what threats were used to turn her
from the path of honor. Perhaps she is not as strong as we."</p>

<p>"Let us not speak of her," I said. "It is a hideous sensation,
Tavia, to feel love turned to hatred."</p>

<p>She pressed my arm. "Time heals all hurts," she said, "and some
day you will find a woman worthy of you, if such a one exists."</p>

<p>I looked down at her. "If such a one exists," I mused, but she
interrupted my meditation with a question.</p>

<p>"Shall we fight or run, Hadron of Hastor?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I should prefer to fight and die," I replied, "but I must think
of you, Tavia."</p>

<p>"Then we shall remain and fight," she said; "but Hadron, you
must not die."</p>

<p>There was a note of reproach in her tone that did not escape me
and I was ashamed of myself for having seemed to forget the great
debt that I owed her for her friendship.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said. "Tavia, I could not wish to die while you
live."</p>

<p>"That is better," she said. "How shall we fight? Shall I stand
upon your right or upon your left?"</p>

<p>"You shall stand behind me, Tavia," I told her. "While my hand
can hold a sword, you will need no other defense."</p>

<p>"A long time ago, after we first met," she said, "you told me
that we should be comrades in arms. That means that we fight
together, shoulder to shoulder, or back to back. I hold you to your
word, Tan Hadron of Hastor."</p>

<p>I smiled, and, though I felt that I could fight better alone
than with a woman at my side, I admired her courage. "Very well," I
said; "fight at my right, for thus you will be between two
swords."</p>

<p>The three upon our trail had approached us so closely by this
time that I could discern what manner of creatures they were and I
saw before me naked savages with tangled, unkempt hair, filthy
bodies and degraded faces. The wild light in their eyes, their
snarling lips exposing yellow fangs, their stealthy, slinking
carriage gave them more the appearance of wild beasts than men.</p>

<p>They were armed with swords which they carried in their hands,
having neither harness nor scabbard. They halted at a short
distance from us, eyeing us hungrily, and doubtless they were
hungry for their flabby bellies suggested that they went often
empty and were then gorged when meat fell to their lot in
sufficient quantities. Tonight these three had hoped to gorge
themselves; I could see it in their eyes. They whispered together
in low tones for a few minutes and then they separated to rush us
from different points simultaneously.</p>

<p>"We'll carry the battle to them, Tavia," I whispered. "When they
have taken their positions around us, I shall give the word and
then I shall rush the one in front of me and try to dispatch him
before the others can set upon us. Keep close beside me so that
they cannot cut you off."</p>

<p>"Shoulder to shoulder until the end," she said.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE BATTLE OF
JAHAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GLANCING across my shoulder I saw that the two
circling to our rear were already further away from us than he who
stood facing us and realizing that the unexpectedness of our act
would greatly enhance the chances of success, I gave the word.</p>

<p>"Now, Tavia," I whispered, and together we leaped forward at a
run straight for the naked savage facing us.</p>

<p>It was evident that he had not expected this and it was also
evident that he was a slow witted beast, for as he saw us coming
his lower jaw dropped and he just stood there, waiting to receive
us; whereas if he had had any intelligence he would have fallen
back to give his fellows time to attack us from the rear.</p>

<p>As our swords crossed I heard a savage growl from behind, such a
growl as might issue from the throat of a wild beast. From the
corner of my eye I saw Tavia glance back and then before I could
realize what she intended, she sprang forward and ran her sword
through the body of the man in front of me as he lunged at me with
his own weapon, and now, wheeling together, we faced the other two
who were running rapidly toward us and I can assure you that it was
with a feeling of infinite relief that I realized that the odds
were no longer so greatly against us.</p>

<p>As the two engaged us, I was handicapped at first by the
necessity of constantly keeping an eye upon Tavia, but not for
long.</p>

<p>In an instant I realized that a master hand was wielding that
blade. Its point wove in and out past the clumsy guard of the
savage and I knew, and I guessed he must have sensed, that his life
lay in the hollow of the little hand that gripped the hilt. Then I
turned my attention to my own antagonist.</p>

<p>These were not the best swordsmen that I have ever met, but they
were far from being poor swordsmen. Their defense, however, far
excelled their offense and this, I think, was due to two things,
natural cowardice and the fact that they usually hunted in packs,
which far outnumbered the quarry. Thus a good defense only was
required, since the death blow might always be struck from behind
by a companion of the one who engaged the quarry from in front.</p>

<p>Never before had I seen a woman fight and I should have thought
that I should have been chagrined to have one fighting at my side,
but instead I felt a strange thrill that was partly pride and
partly something else that I could not analyze.</p>

<p>At first, I think, the fellow facing Tavia did not realize that
she was a woman, but he must have soon as the scant harness of
Barsoom hides little and certainly did not hide the rounded
contours of Tavia's girlish body. Perhaps, therefore, it was
surprise that was his undoing, or possibly when he discovered her
sex he became overconfident, but at any rate Tavia slipped her
point into his heart just an instant before I finished my man.</p>

<p>I cannot say that we were greatly elated over our victory. Each
of us felt compassion for the poor creatures who had been reduced
to their horrid state by the tyranny of cruel Tul Axtar, but it had
been their lives or ours and we were glad it had not been ours.</p>

<p>As a matter of precaution I took a quick look about us as the
last of our antagonists fell and I was glad that I had, for I
immediately discerned three creatures crouching at the top of a low
hill not far distant.</p>

<p>"We are not done yet, Tavia," I said. "Look!" and pointed in the
direction of the three.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they do not care to share the fate of their fellows,"
she said. "They are not approaching."</p>

<p>"They can have peace if they want it as far as I am concerned,"
I said. "Come, let us go on. If they follow us, then will be time
enough to consider them."</p>

<p>As we walked on toward the north we glanced back occasionally
and presently we saw the three rise and come down the hill toward
the bodies of their slain fellows, and as they did so we saw that
they were women and that they were unarmed.</p>

<p>When they realized that we were departing and had no intention
of attacking them, they broke into a run and, uttering loud,
uncanny shrieks, raced madly toward the corpses.</p>

<p>"How pathetic," said Tavia sadly. "Even these poor degraded
creatures possess human emotions. They, too, can feel sorrow at the
loss of loved ones."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Poor things, I am sorry for them."</p>

<p>Fearing that in the frenzy of their grief they might attempt to
avenge their fallen mates, we kept a close eye upon them or we
might not have witnessed the horrid sequel of the fray. I wish that
we had not.</p>

<p>When the three women reached the corpses they fell upon them,
but not with weeping and lamentation&mdash;they fell upon them to
devour them.</p>

<p>Sickened, we turned away and walked rapidly toward the north
until long after darkness had descended.</p>

<p>We felt that there was little danger of attack at night since
there were no savage beasts in a country where there was nothing to
support them and also that it was reasonable to assume that the
hunting men would be abroad by day rather than by night, since at
night they would be far less able to find quarry or follow it.</p>

<p>I suggested to Tavia that we rest for a short time and then push
on for the balance of the night, find a place of concealment early
in the day and remain there until night had fallen again, as I was
sure that if we followed this plan we would make better time and
suffer less exhaustion by traveling through the cool hours of
darkness and at the same time would greatly minimize the danger of
discovery and attack by whatever hostile people lay between us and
Gathol.</p>

<p>Tavia agreed with me and so we rested for a short time, taking
turns at sleeping and watching.</p>

<p>Later we pushed on and I am sure that we covered a great
distance before dawn, though the high hills to the north of us
still looked as far away as they had upon the previous day.</p>

<p>We now set about searching for some comfortable place of
concealment where we might spend the daylight hours. Neither of us
was suffering to any extent from either hunger or thirst, as the
ancients would have done under like circumstances, for with the
gradual diminution of water and vegetable matter upon Mars during
countless ages all her creatures have by a slow process of
evolution been enabled to go for long periods without either food
or drink and we have also learned so to control our minds that we
do not think of food or drink until we are able to procure it,
which doubtless greatly assists us in controlling the cravings of
our appetite.</p>

<p>After considerable search we found a deep and narrow ravine
which seemed a most favorable place in which to hide, but, scarcely
had we entered it, when I chanced to see two eyes looking down upon
us from the summit of one of the ridges that flanked it. As I
looked, the head in which the eyes were set was withdrawn below the
summit.</p>

<p>"That puts an end to this place," I said to Tavia, telling her
what I had seen. "We must move on and look for a new
sanctuary."</p>

<p>As we emerged from the ravine at its upper end I glanced back,
and again I saw the creature looking at us and once again he tried
to hide himself from us. As we moved on I kept glancing back and
occasionally I would see him&mdash;one of the hunting men of U-Gor.
He was stalking us as the wild beast stalks its prey. The very
thought of it filled me with disgust. Had he been a fighting man
stalking us merely to kill, I should not have felt as I did, but
the thought that he was stealthily trailing us because he desired
to devour us was repellent&mdash;it was horrifying.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the thing kept upon our trail; doubtless he
feared to attack because we outnumbered him, or perhaps he thought
we might become separated, or lie down to sleep or do one of the
number of things that travelers might do that would give him the
opportunity he sought, but after awhile he must have given up hope.
He no longer sought to conceal himself from us and once, as he
mounted a low hill, he stood there silhouetted against the sky and
throwing his head back, he gave voice to a shrill, uncanny cry that
made the short hairs upon my neck stand erect. It was the hunting
cry of the wild beast calling the pack to the kill.</p>

<p>I could feel Tavia shudder and press more closely to me and I
put my arm about her in a gesture of protection, and thus we walked
on in silence for a long time.</p>

<p>Twice again the creature voiced his uncanny cry until at last it
was answered ahead of us and to the right.</p>

<p>Again we were forced to fight, but this time only two, and when
we pushed on again it was with a feeling of depression that I could
not shake off&mdash;depression for the utter hopelessness of our
situation.</p>

<p>At the summit of a higher hill than we had before crossed, I
halted. Some tall weeds grew there. "Let us lie down here, Tavia,"
I said. "From here we can watch; let us be the watchers for a
while. Sleep, and when night comes we shall move on."</p>

<p>She looked tired and that worried me, but I think she was
suffering more from the nervous strain of the eternal stalking than
from physical fatigue. I know that it affected me and how much more
might it affect a young girl than a trained fighting man. She lay
very close to me, as though she felt safer thus and was soon
asleep, while I watched.</p>

<p>From this high vantage point I could see a considerable area of
country about us and it was not long before I detected figures of
men prowling about like hunting banths and often it was apparent
that one was stalking another. There were at least a half dozen
such visible to me at one time. I saw one overtake his prey and
leap upon it from behind. They were at too great a distance from me
for me to discern accurately the details of the encounter, but I
judged that the stalker ran his sword through the back of his
quarry and then, like a hunting banth, he fell upon his kill and
devoured it. I do not know that he finished it, but he was still
eating when darkness fell.</p>

<p>Tavia had had a long sleep and when she awoke she reproached me
for having permitted her to sleep so long and insisted that I must
sleep.</p>

<p>From necessity I have learned to do with little sleep when
conditions are such that I cannot spare the time, though I always
make up for it later, and I have also learned to limit my sleep to
any length of time that I choose, so that now I awoke promptly when
my allotted time had elapsed and again we set out toward far
Gathol.</p>

<p>Again this night, as upon the preceding one, we moved unmolested
through the horrid land of U-Gor and when morning dawned we saw the
high hills rising close before us.</p>

<p>"Perhaps these hills mark the northern limits of U-Gor," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"I think they do," replied Tavia.</p>

<p>"They are only a short distance away now," I said; "let us keep
on until we have passed them. I cannot leave this accursed land
behind me too soon."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tavia. "I sicken at the thought of what I have
seen."</p>

<p>We had crossed a narrow valley and were entering the hills when
we heard the hateful hunting cry behind us. Turning, I saw a single
man moving across the valley toward us. He knew that I had seen
him, but he kept steadily on, occasionally stopping to voice his
weird scream. He heard an answer come from the east and then
another and another from different directions. We hastened onward,
climbing the low foothills that led upward toward the summit far
above, and as we looked back we saw the hunting men converging upon
us from all sides. We had never seen so many of them at one time
before.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if we get well up into the mountains we can elude
them," I said.</p>

<p>Tavia shook her head. "At least we have made a good fight,
Hadron," she said.</p>

<p>I saw that she was discouraged; nor could I wonder; yet a moment
later she looked up at me and smiled brightly. "We still live,
Hadron of Hastor!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"We still live and we have our swords," I reminded her.</p>

<p>As we climbed they pressed upward behind us and presently I saw
others coming through the hills from the right and from the left.
We were turned from the low saddle over which I had hoped to cross
the summit of the range, for hunting men had entered it from above
and were coming down toward us. Directly ahead of us now loomed a
high peak, the highest in the range as far as I could see, and only
there, up its steep side, were there no hunting men to bar our
way.</p>

<p>As we climbed, the sides of the mountain grew steeper until the
ascent was not only most arduous, but sometimes difficult and
dangerous; yet there was no alternative and we pressed onward
toward the summit, while behind us came the hunting men of U-Gor.
They were not rushing us and from that I felt confident that they
knew that they had us cornered. I was looking for a place in which
we might make a stand, but I found none and at last we reached the
summit, a circular, level space perhaps a hundred feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>As our pursuers were yet some little distance below us, I walked
quickly around the outside of the table-like top of the peak. The
entire northern face dropped sheer from the summit for a couple of
hundred feet, definitely blocking our retreat. At every other point
the hunting men were ascending. Our situation appeared hopeless; it
was hopeless, and yet I refused to admit defeat.</p>

<p>The summit of the mountain was strewn with loose rock. I hurled
a rock down at the nearest cannibal. It struck him upon the head
and sent him hurtling down the mountain side, carrying a couple of
his fellows with him. Then Tavia followed my example and together
we bombarded them, but more often we scored misses than hits and
there were so many of them and they were so fierce and so hungry
that we did not even stem their advance. So numerous were they now
that they reminded me of insects, crawling up there from
below&mdash;huge, grotesque insects that would soon fall upon us
and devour us.</p>

<p>As they came nearer they gave voice to a new cry that I had not
heard before. It was a cry that differed from the hunting call, but
was equally as terrible.</p>

<p>"Their war-cry," said Tavia.</p>

<p>On and on with relentless persistency the throng swarmed upward
toward us. We drew our swords; it was our last stand. Tavia pressed
closer to me and for the first time I thought I felt her
tremble.</p>

<p>"Do not let them take me," she said. "It is not death that I
fear."</p>

<p>I knew what she meant and I took her in my arms. "I cannot do
it, Tavia," I said. "I cannot."</p>

<p>"You must," she replied in a firm voice. "If you care for me
even as a friend, you cannot let these beasts take me alive."</p>

<p>I know that I choked then so that I could not reply, but I knew
that she was right and I drew my dagger.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Hadron&mdash;my Hadron!"</p>

<p>Her breast was bared to receive my dagger, her face was upturned
toward mine. It was still a brave face with no fear upon it, and oh
how beautiful it was.</p>

<p>Impulsively, guided by a power I could not control, I bent and
crushed my lips to hers. With half closed eyes she pressed her own
lips upward more tightly against mine.</p>

<p>"Oh, Issus!" she breathed as she took them away, and then, "They
come! Strike now, Hadron, and strike deep!"</p>

<p>The creatures were almost at the summit. I swung my hand upward
that I might bury the slim dagger deeply in that perfect breast. To
my surprise my knuckles struck something hard above me. I glanced
upward. There was nothing there; yet something impelled me to feel
again, to solve that uncanny mystery even in that instant of high
tragedy.</p>

<p>Again I felt above me. By Issus, there was something there! My
fingers passed over a smooth surface&mdash;a familiar surface.</p>

<p>It could not be, and yet I knew that it must be&mdash;the Jhama.
I asked no questions of myself nor of fate at that instant. The
hunting men of U-Gor were almost upon us as my groping fingers
found one of the mooring rings in the bow of the Jhama. Quickly I
swung Tavia above my head.</p>

<p>"It is the Jhama. Climb to her deck," I cried.</p>

<p>The dear girl, as quick to seize upon the fortuitous
opportunities as any trained fighting man, did not pause to
question, but swung herself upward to the deck with the agility of
an athlete, and as I seized the mooring ring and drew myself upward
she lay flat upon her belly and reaching down assisted me; nor was
the strength in that slender frame unequal to the task.</p>

<p>The leaders of the horde had reached the summit. They paused in
momentary confusion when they saw us climb into thin air and stand
there apparently just above their heads, but hunger urged them on
and they leaped for us, clambering upon one another's back and
shoulders to seize us and drag us down.</p>

<p>Two almost gained the deck as I fought them all back
single-handed while Tavia had raised a hatch and leaped to the
controls.</p>

<p>Another foul-faced thing reached the deck upon the opposite side
and only chance revealed him to me before he had run his sword
through my back. The Jhama was already rising as I turned to engage
him. There was little room there in which to fight, but I had the
advantage in that I knew the extent of the deck beneath my feet,
while he could see nothing but thin air. I think it frightened him,
too, and when I rushed him he stepped backward out into space and,
with a scream of terror, hurtled downward toward the ground.</p>

<p>We were saved, but how in the name of all our ancestors had the
Jhama chanced to be at this spot.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tul Axtar was aboard! The thought filled me with alarm
for Tavia's safety and with my sword ready I leaped through the
hatchway into the cabin, but only Tavia was there.</p>

<p>We tried to arrive at some explanation of the miracle that had
saved us, but no amount of conjecture brought forth any thing that
was at all satisfactory.</p>

<p>"She was there when we needed her most," said Tavia; "that fact
should satisfy us."</p>

<p>"I guess it will have to for the time being at least," I said,
"and now once more we can turn a ship's nose toward Helium."</p>

<p>We had passed but a short distance beyond the mountains when I
sighted a ship in the distance and shortly thereafter another and
another until I was aware that we were approaching a great fleet
moving toward the east. As we came closer I descried the hulls
painted with the ghastly blue of Jahar and I knew that this was Tul
Axtar's formidable armada.</p>

<p>And then we saw ships approaching from the east and I knew that
it was the fleet of Helium. It could be no other; yet I must make
certain, and so I sped in the direction of the nearest ship of this
other fleet until I saw the banners and pennons of Helium floating
from her upper works and the battle insignia of the Warlord painted
upon her prow. Behind her came the other ships&mdash;a noble fleet
moving to inevitable doom.</p>

<p>A Jaharian cruiser was moving toward the first great battleship
as I raced to intercept them and bring one of my rifles into
action.</p>

<p>I was forced to come close to my target as was the Jaharian
cruiser, since the effective range of the disintegrating ray rifle
is extremely limited.</p>

<p>Everything aboard the battleship of Helium was ready for action,
but I knew why they had not fired a gun. It has ever been the boast
of John Carter, Warlord of Barsoom, that he would not start a war.
The enemy must fire the first shot. If I could have reached them in
time he would have realized the fatal consequences of this
magnanimous and chivalrous code and the ships of Helium, with their
long range guns, might have annihilated Jahar's entire fleet before
it could have brought its deadly rifles within range, but fate had
ordained otherwise and now the best that I could hope was that I
might reach the Jaharian ship before it was too late.</p>

<p>Tavia was at the controls. We were racing toward the blue
cruiser of Jahar. I was standing at the forward rifle. In another
moment we should be within range and then I saw the great
battleship of Helium crumble in mid-air. Its wooden parts dropped
slowly toward the ground and a thousand warriors plunged to a cruel
death upon the barren land beneath.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the other ships of Helium were brought to a
stop. They had witnessed the catastrophe that had engulfed the
first ship of the line and the commander of the fleet had realized
that they were menaced by a new force of which they had no
knowledge.</p>

<p>The ships of Tul Axtar, encouraged by this first success, were
now moving swiftly to the attack. The cruiser that had destroyed
the great battleship was in the lead, but now I was within range of
it.</p>

<p>Realizing that the blue protective paint of Jahar would
safeguard the ship itself against the disintegrating ray, I had
rammed home a cartridge of another type in the chamber and swinging
the muzzle of the rifle so that it would rake the entire length of
the ship, I pressed the button.</p>

<p>Instantly the men upon deck dissolved into thin air&mdash;only
their harness and their metal and their weapons were left.</p>

<p>Directing Tavia to run the Jhama alongside, I raised the upper
hatch and leaped to the deck of the cruiser and a moment later I
had raised the signal of surrender above her. One can imagine the
consternation aboard the nearer ships of Jahar as they saw that
signal flying from her forward mast, for there was none
sufficiently close to have witnessed what actually transpired
aboard her.</p>

<p>Returning to the cabin of the Jhama I lowered the hatch and went
at once to the periscope. Far in the rear of the first line of
Jaharian ships I could just discern the royal insignia upon a great
battleship, which told me that Tul Axtar was there, but in a safe
position. I should have liked to reach his ship next, but the fleet
was moving forward toward the ships of Helium and I dared not spare
the time.</p>

<p>By now the ships of Helium had opened fire and shells were
exploding about the leading ships of the Jaharian
fleet&mdash;shells so nicely timed that they can be set to explode
at any point up to the extreme range of the gun that discharges
them. It takes nice gunnery to synchronize the timing with the
target.</p>

<p>As ship after ship of the Jaharian fleet was hit, the others
brought their big guns into action. Temporarily, at least, the
disintegrating ray rifles had failed, but that they would succeed I
knew if a single ship could get through the Heliumetic line, where
among the great battleships she could destroy a dozen in the space
of a few minutes.</p>

<p>The gunnery of the Jaharians was poor; their shells usually
exploded high in air before they reached their target, but as the
battle continued it improved; yet I knew that Jahar never could
hope to defeat Helium with Helium's own weapons.</p>

<p>A great battleship of Tul Axtar's fleet was hit three times in
succession almost alongside of me. I saw her drop by the stern and
I knew that she was done for, and then I saw her commander rush to
the bow and take the last long dive and I knew that there were
brave men in Tul Axtar's fleet as well as in the fleet of Helium,
but Tul Axtar was not one of them, for in the distance I could see
his flagship racing toward Jahar.</p>

<p>Despite the cowardice of the jeddak, the great fleet pushed on
to the attack. If they had the courage they could still win, for
their ships outnumbered the ships of Helium ten to one and as far
as the eye could reach I could see them speeding from the north,
from the south and from the west toward the scene of battle.</p>

<p>Closer and closer the ships of Helium were pressing toward the
ships of Jahar. In his ignorance the Warlord was playing directly
into the hands of the enemy. With their superior marksmanship and
twenty battleships protected by the blue paint of Jahar, Helium
could wipe out Tul Axtar's great armada; of that I was confident,
and with that thought came an inspiration. It might be done and
only Tan Hadron of Hastor could do it.</p>

<p>Shells were falling all about us. The force of the explosions
rocked the Jhama until she tossed and pitched like an ancient ship
upon an ancient sea. Again and again were we perilously close to
the line of fire of the Jaharian disintegrating ray rifles. I felt
that I might no longer risk Tavia thus, yet I must carry out the
plan that I had conceived.</p>

<p>It is strange how men change and for what seemingly trivial
reasons. I had thought all my life that I would make any sacrifice
for Helium, but now I knew that I would not sacrifice a single hair
of that tousled head for all Barsoom. This, I soliloquized, is
friendship.</p>

<p>Taking the controls I turned the bow of the Jhama toward one of
the ships of Helium, that was standing temporarily out of the line
of fire, and as we approached her side I turned the controls back
over to Tavia, and, raising the forward hatch, sprang to the deck
of the Jhama, raising both hands above my head in signal of
surrender in the event that they might take me for a Jaharian.</p>

<p>What must they have thought when they saw me apparently floating
upright upon thin air? That they were astonished was evident by the
expressions on the faces of those nearest to me as the Jhama
touched the side of the battleship.</p>

<p>They kept me covered as I came aboard, leaving Tavia to maneuver
the Jhama.</p>

<p>Before I could announce myself I was recognized by a young
officer of my own umak. With a cry of surprise he leaped forward
and threw his arms about me. "Hadron of Hastor!" he cried. "Have I
witnessed your resurrection from death; but no, you are too real,
too much alive to be any wraith of the other world."</p>

<p>"I am alive now," I cried, "but none of us will be unless I can
get word to your commander. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Here," said a voice behind me and I turned to see an old odwar
who had been a great friend of my father's. He recognized me
immediately, but there was no time even for greetings.</p>

<p>"Warn the fleet that the ships of Jahar are armed with
disintegrating ray rifles that can dissolve every ship as you saw
the first one dissolve. They are only effective at short range.</p>

<p>"Keep at least a haad distance from them and you are relatively
safe. And now if you will give me three men and direct the fire of
your fleet away from the Jaharian ships on the south of their line,
I will agree to have twenty ships for you in an hour&mdash;ships
protected by the blue of Jahar in which you may face their
disintegrating ray rifles with impunity."</p>

<p>The odwar knew me well and upon his own responsibility he agreed
to do what I asked.</p>

<p>Three padwars of my own class guaranteed to accompany me. I
fetched Tavia aboard the battleship and turned her over to the
protection of the old odwar, though she objected strenuously to
being parted from me.</p>

<p>"We have gone through so much together, Hadron of Hastor," she
said, "let us go on to the end together."</p>

<p>She had come quite close to me and spoken in a low voice that
none might overhear. Her eyes, filled with pleading, were upturned
to mine.</p>

<p>"I cannot risk you further, Tavia," I said.</p>

<p>"There is so much danger then, you think?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We shall be in danger, of course," I said; "this is war and one
can never tell. Do not worry though. I shall come back safely."</p>

<p>"Then it is that you fear that I shall be in the way," she said,
"and another can do the work better than I."</p>

<p>"Of course not," I replied. "I am thinking only of your
safety."</p>

<p>"If you are lost, I shall not live. I swear it," she said, "so
if you can trust me to do the work of a man, let me go with you
instead of one of those."</p>

<p>I hesitated. "Oh, Hadron of Hastor, please do not leave me here
without you," she said.</p>

<p>I could not resist her. "Very well, then," I said, "come with
me. I would rather have you than any other," and so it was that
Tavia replaced one of the padwars on the Jhama, much to the
officer's chagrin.</p>

<p>Before entering the Jhama I turned again to the old odwar. "If
we are successful," I said, "a number of Tul Axtar's battleships
will move slowly toward the Helium line beneath signals of
surrender. Their crews will have been destroyed. Have boarding
parties ready to take them over."</p>

<p>Naturally every one aboard the battleship was intensely
interested in the Jhama though all that they could see of her was
the open hatch and the eye of the periscope. Officers and men lined
the rail as we went aboard our invisible craft and as I closed the
hatch, a loud cheer rang out above me.</p>

<p>My first act thoroughly evidenced my need of Tavia, for I put
her at the after turret in charge of the rifle there, while one of
the padwars took the controls and turned the prow of the Jhama
toward the Jaharian fleet.</p>

<p>I was standing in a position where I could watch the changing
scene upon the ground glass beneath the periscope and when a great
battleship swung slowly into the miniature picture before me, I
directed the padwar to lay a straight course for her, but a moment
later I saw another battleship moving abreast of her. This was
better and we changed our course to pass between the two.</p>

<p>They were moving gallantly toward the fleet of Helium, firing
their big guns now and reserving their disintegrating ray rifles
for closer range. What a magnificent sight they were, and yet how
helpless. The tiny, invisible Jhama, with her little rifles,
constituted a greater menace to them than did the entire fleet of
Helium. On they drove, unconscious of the inevitable fate bearing
down upon them.</p>

<p>"Sweep the starboard ship from stem to stern," I called to
Tavia. "I will take this fellow on our port," and then to the
padwar at the controls, "Half speed!"</p>

<p>Slowly we passed their bows. I touched the button upon my rifle
and through the tiny sighting aperture I saw the crew dissolve in
the path of those awful rays, as the two ships passed. We were very
close&mdash;so close that I could see the expressions of
consternation and horror on the faces of some of the warriors as
they saw their fellows disappear before their eyes, and then their
turn would come and they would be snuffed out in the twinkling of
an eye, their weapons and their metal clattering to the deck.</p>

<p>As we dropped astern of them, our work completed, I had the
padwar bring the Jhama about and alongside one of the ships, which
I quickly boarded, running up the signal of surrender. With the
death of the officer at her controls she had fallen off with the
wind, but I quickly brought her up again and, setting her at half
speed, her bow toward the ships of Helium, I locked the controls
and left her.</p>

<p>Returning to the Jhama we crossed quickly to the other ship and
a few moments later it, too, was moving slowly toward the fleet of
the Warlord, the signal of surrender fluttering above it.</p>

<p>So quickly had the blow been struck that even the nearer ships
of Jahar were some time in realizing that anything was amiss.
Perhaps they were unable to believe their own eyes when they saw
two of their great battleships surrender before having been struck
by a single shot, but presently the commander of a light cruiser
seemed to awaken to the seriousness of the situation, even though
he could not fully have understood it. We were already moving
toward another battleship when I saw the cruiser speeding directly
toward one of our prizes and I knew that it would never reach the
fleet of Helium if he boarded it, a thing which I must prevent at
all costs. His course would bring him across our bow and as he
passed I raked him with the forward rifle.</p>

<p>I saw that it would be impossible for the Jhama to overtake this
swift cruiser, which was moving at full speed and so we had to let
her go her way. At first I was afraid she would ram the nearer
prize and had she hit her squarely at the rate that she was
traveling, the cruiser would have plowed half way through the hull
of the battleship. Fortunately, she missed the great ship by a hair
and went speeding on into the midst of the fleet of Helium.</p>

<p>Instantly she was the target for a hundred guns, a barrage of
shells was bursting about her and then there must have been a dozen
hits simultaneously, for the cruiser simply disappeared&mdash;a
mass of flying debris.</p>

<p>As I turned back to our work I saw the havoc being wrought by
the big guns of Helium upon the enemy ships to the north of me. In
the instant that I glanced I saw three great battleships take the
final dive, while at least four others were drifting helplessly
with the wind, but other ships of that mighty armada were swinging
into action. As far as I could see they were coming from the north,
from the south and from the west. There seemed no end to them and
now, at last, I realized that only a miracle could give victory to
Helium.</p>

<p>In accordance with my suggestion our own fleet was holding off,
concentrating the fire of its big guns upon the nearer ships of
Jahar&mdash;constantly seeking to keep those deadly rifles out of
range.</p>

<p>Again we fell to work&mdash;to the grim work that the god of
battle had allotted to us. One by one, twenty great battleships
surrendered their deserted decks to us and as we worked I counted
fully as many more destroyed by the guns of the Warlord.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of our work we had been compelled to destroy
at least half a dozen small craft, such as scout fliers and light
cruisers, and now these were racing erratically among the remaining
ships of the Jaharian fleet, carrying consternation and doubtless
terror to the hearts of Tul Axtar's warriors, for all the nearer
ships must have realized long since that some strange, new force
had been loosed upon them by the ships of Helium.</p>

<p>By this time we had worked so far behind the Jaharian first line
that we could no longer see the ships of Helium, though bursting
shells attested the fact that they were still there.</p>

<p>From past experience I realized that it would be necessary to
protect the captured Jaharian ships from being re-taken and so I
turned back, taking a position where I could watch as many of them
as possible and it was well that I did so, for we found it
necessary to destroy the crews of three more ships before we
reached the battle line of Helium.</p>

<p>Here they had already manned a dozen of the captured battleships
of Jahar, and, with the banners and pennons of Helium above them,
they had turned about and were moving into action against their
sister ships.</p>

<p>It was then that the spirit of Jahar was broken. This, I think,
was too much for them as doubtless the majority of them believed
that these ships had gone over to the enemy voluntarily with all
their officers and crews, for few, if any, could have known that
the latter had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Their Jeddak had long since deserted them. Twenty of their
largest ships had gone over to the enemy and now protected by the
blue of Jahar and manned by the best gunners of Barsoom, were
plowing through them, spreading death and destruction upon every
hand.</p>

<p>A dozen of Tul Axtar's ships surrendered voluntarily and then
the others turned and scattered; very few of them headed toward
Jahar and I knew by that that they believed that the city must
inevitably fall.</p>

<p>The Warlord made no effort to pursue the fleeing craft; instead
he stationed the ships that we had captured from the enemy, more
than thirty all told now, entirely around the fleet of Helium to
protect it from the disintegrating ray rifles of the enemy in the
event of a renewed attack, and then slowly we moved on Jahar.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; DESPAIR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IMMEDIATELY after the close of the battle the
Warlord sent for me and a few moments later Tavia and I stepped
aboard the flagship.</p>

<p>The Warlord himself came forward to meet us. "I knew," he said,
"that the son of Had Urtur would give a good account of himself.
Helium can scarcely pay the debt of gratitude that you have placed
upon her today. You have been to Jahar; your work today convinces
me of that. May we with safety approach and take the city?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, and then briefly I explained the mighty force
that Tul Axtar had gathered and the armament with which he expected
to subdue the world. "But there is a way," I said.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Send one of the captured Jaharian ships with a flag of truce
and I believe that Tul Axtar will surrender. He is a coward. He
fled in terror when the battle was still young."</p>

<p>"Will he honor a flag of truce?"</p>

<p>"If it is carried aboard one of his own ships, protected by the
blue paint of Jahar, I believe that he will," I said; "but at the
same time I shall accompany the ship in the invisible Jhama.</p>

<p>"I know how I may gain entrance to the palace. I have abducted
Tul Axtar once and perchance I may be able to do it again. If you
have him in your hands, you can dictate terms to the nobles, all of
whom fear the terrific power of the hungry multitude that is held
in check now only by the instinctive terror they feel for their
Jeddak."</p>

<p>As we waited for the former Jaharian cruiser that was to carry
the flag of truce to come alongside, John Carter told me what had
delayed the expedition against Jahar for so many months.</p>

<p>The major domo of Tor Hatan's palace, to whom I had entrusted
the message to John Carter and which would have led immediately to
the descent upon Jahar, had been assassinated while on his way to
the palace of the Warlord. Suspicion, therefore, did not fall upon
Tul Axtar and the ships of Helium scoured Barsoom for many months
in vain search for Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>It was only by accident that Kal Tavan the slave, who had
overheard my conversation with the major domo, learned that the
ships of Helium had not been dispatched to Jahar, for a slave
ordinarily is not taken into the confidences of his master and the
arrogant Tor Hatan was, of all men, least likely to do so; but Kal
Tavan did hear eventually and he went himself to the Warlord and
told his story.</p>

<p>"For his services," said John Carter, "I gave him his freedom
and as it was apparent from his demeanor that he had been born to
the nobility in his native country, though he did not tell me this,
I gave him service aboard the fleet. He has turned out to be an
excellent man and recently I have made him a dwar. Having been born
in Tjanath and served in Kobol, he was more familiar with this part
of Barsoom than any other man in Helium. I, therefore, assigned him
to duty with the navigating officer of the fleet and he is now
aboard the flagship."</p>

<p>"I had occasion to notice the man immediately after Sanoma
Tora's abduction," I said, "and I was much impressed by him. I am
glad that he has found his freedom and the favor of the
Warlord."</p>

<p>The cruiser that was to bear the flag of truce was now
alongside. The officer in command reported to the Warlord and as he
received his instructions, Tavia and I returned to the Jhama. We
had decided to carry on our part of the plan alone, for if it
became necessary to abduct Tul Axtar again I had hoped, also, that
I might find Phao and Sanoma Tora, and if so the small cabin of the
Jhama would be sufficiently crowded without the addition of the two
padwars. They were reluctant to leave her for I think they had had
the most glorious experience of their lives during the short time
that they had been aboard her, but I gained permission from the
Warlord for them to accompany the cruiser to Jahar.</p>

<p>Once again Tavia and I were alone. "Perhaps this will be our
last cruise aboard the Jhama," I said.</p>

<p>"I think I shall be glad to rest," she replied.</p>

<p>"You are tired?" I asked.</p>

<p>"More tired than I realized until I felt the safety and security
of that great fleet of Helium about me. I think that I am just
tired of being always in danger."</p>

<p>"I should not have brought you now," I said. "There is yet time
to return you to the flagship."</p>

<p>She smiled. "You know better than that, Hadron," she said.</p>

<p>I did know better. I knew that she would not leave me. We were
silent for a while as the Jhama slid through the air slightly
astern of the cruiser. As I looked at Tavia's face, it seemed to
reflect a great weariness and there were little lines of sadness
there that I had not seen before. Presently she spoke again in a
dull tone that was most unlike her own.</p>

<p>"I think that Sanoma Tora will be glad to come away with you
this time," she said.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I said. "It makes no difference to me whether
she wishes to come or not. It is my duty to fetch her."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Perhaps it is best," she said; "her father is a
noble and very rich."</p>

<p>I did not understand what that had to do with it and not being
particularly interested further in either Sanoma Tora or her
father, I did not pursue the conversation. I knew that it was my
duty to return Sanoma Tora to Helium if possible, and that was the
only interest that I had in the affair.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>We were well within sight of Jahar before we encountered any
warships and then a cruiser came to meet ours which bore the flag
of truce. The commanders of the two boats exchanged a few words and
then the Jaharian craft turned and led the way toward the palace of
Tul Axtar. It moved slowly and I forged on ahead, my plans already
made, and the Jhama, being clothed with invisibility, needed no
escort. I steered directly to that wing of the palace which
contained the women's quarters and slowly circled it, my periscope
on a line with the windows.</p>

<p>We had rounded the end of the wing, in which the great hall lay
where Tul Axtar held court with his women, when the periscope came
opposite the windows of a gorgeous apartment. I brought the ship to
a stop before it, as I had before some of the others which I wished
to examine, and while the slowly moving periscope brought different
parts of the large room to the ground glass plate before me I saw
the figures of two women and instantly I recognized them. One was
Sanoma Tora and the other Phao, and upon the figure of the former
hung the gorgeous trappings of a Jeddara. The woman I had loved had
achieved her goal, but it caused me no pang of jealousy. I searched
the balance of the apartment and finding no other occupant, I
brought the deck of the Jhama close below the sill of the window.
Then I raised a hatch and leaped into the room.</p>

<p>At sight of me Sanoma Tora arose from the divan upon which she
had been sitting and shrank back in terror. I thought that she was
about to scream for help, but I warned her to silence, and at the
same instant Phao sprang forward and, seizing Sanoma Tora's arm,
clapped a palm over her mouth. A moment later I had gained her
side.</p>

<p>"The fleet of Jahar has gone down to defeat before the ships of
Helium," I told Sanoma Tora, "and I have come to take you back to
your own country."</p>

<p>She was trembling so that she could not reply. I had never seen
such a picture of abject terror, induced no doubt by her own guilty
conscience.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come, Hadron of Hastor," said Phao, "for I
know that you will take me, too."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said. "The Jhama lies just outside that window.
Come! We shall soon be safe aboard the flagship of the
Warlord."</p>

<p>While I had been talking I had become aware of a strange noise
that seemed to come from a distance and which rose and fell in
volume and now it appeared to be growing nearer and nearer. I could
not explain it; perhaps I did not attempt to, for at best I could
be only mildly interested. I had found two of those whom I sought.
I would get them aboard the Jhama and then I would try to locate
Tul Axtar.</p>

<p>At that instant the door burst open and a man rushed into the
room. It was Tul Axtar. He was very pale and he was breathing hard.
At sight of me he halted and shrank back and I thought that he was
going to turn and run, but he only looked fearfully back through
the open door and then he turned to me, trembling.</p>

<p>"They are coming!" he cried in a voice of terror. "They will
tear me to pieces."</p>

<p>"Who is coming?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"The people," he said. "They have forced the gates and they are
coming. Do you not hear them?"</p>

<p>So that was the noise that had attracted my attention&mdash;the
hungry hordes of Jahar searching out the author of their
misery.</p>

<p>"The Jhama is outside that window," I said. "If you will come
aboard her as a prisoner of war, I will take you to the Warlord of
Barsoom."</p>

<p>"He will kill me, too," wailed Tul Axtar.</p>

<p>"He should," I assured him.</p>

<p>He stood looking at me for a moment and I could see in his eyes
and the expression of his face the reflection of a dawning idea.
His countenance lightened. He looked almost hopeful. "I will come,"
he said; "but first let me get one thing to take with me. It is in
yonder cabinet."</p>

<p>"Hasten," I said.</p>

<p>He went quickly to the cabinet, which was a tall affair reaching
from the floor almost to the ceiling, and when he opened the door
it hid him from our view.</p>

<p>As I waited I could hear the crash of weapons upon levels below
and the screams and shrieks and curses of men and I judged that the
palace guard was holding the mob, temporarily at least. Finally I
became impatient. "Hasten, Tul Axtar," I called, but there was no
reply. Again I called him, with the same result, and then I crossed
the room to the cabinet, but Tul Axtar was not behind the door.</p>

<p>The cabinet contained many drawers of different sizes, but there
was not one large enough to conceal a man, nor any through which he
could have passed to another apartment. Hastily I searched the
room, but Tul Axtar was nowhere to be found and then I chanced to
glance at Sanoma Tora. She was evidently trying to attract my
attention, but she was so terrified that she could not speak. With
trembling fingers she was pointing toward the window. I looked in
that direction, but I could see nothing.</p>

<p>"What is it? What are you trying to say, Sanoma Tora?" I
demanded as I rushed to her side.</p>

<p>"Gone!" she managed to say. "Gone!"</p>

<p>"Who is gone?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Tul Axtar."</p>

<p>"Where? What do you mean?" I insisted.</p>

<p>"The hatch of the Jhama&mdash;I saw it open and close."</p>

<p>"But it cannot be possible. We have been standing here
looking&mdash;" and then a thought struck me that left me almost
dazed. I turned to Sanoma Tora. "The cloak of invisibility?" I
whispered.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>Almost in a single bound I crossed the room to the window and
was feeling for the deck of the Jhama. It was not there. The ship
had gone. Tul Axtar had taken it and Tavia was with him.</p>

<p>I turned back and crossed the room to Sanoma Tora. "Accursed
woman!" I cried. "Your selfishness, your vanity, your treachery has
jeopardized the safety of one whose footprints you are not fit to
touch." I wanted to close my fingers upon that perfect throat, I
yearned to see the agony of death upon that beautiful face; but
only turned away, my hands dropping at my sides, for I am a
man&mdash;a noble of Helium&mdash;and the women of Helium are
sacred, even such as Sanoma Tora.</p>

<p>From below came the sounds of renewed fighting. If the mob broke
through I knew that we should all be lost. There was but one hope
for even temporary safety and that was the slender tower above the
women's quarters.</p>

<p>"Follow me," I said curtly. As we entered the main corridor I
caught a glimpse of the interior of the great hall where Tul Axtar
had held court. It was filled with terrified women. Well they knew
what the fate of the women of a Jeddak would be at the hands of an
infuriated mob. My heart went out to them, but I could not save
them. Lucky, indeed, should I be if I were able to save these
two.</p>

<p>Crossing the corridor we ascended the spiral ramp to the
storeroom, where, after entering, I took the precaution to bolt the
door, then I ascended the ladder toward the trap door at the summit
of the tower, the two women following me. As I raised the trap and
looked about me I could have cried aloud with joy, for circling low
above the roof of the palace was the cruiser flying the flag of
truce. I apprehended no danger of discovery by Jaharian warriors
since I knew that they were all well occupied below&mdash;those who
were not fleeing for their lives&mdash;and so I sprang to the
summit of the tower and hailed the cruiser in a voice that they
might well hear above the howling of the mob. An answering hail
came from the deck of the craft and a moment later she dropped to
the level of the tower roof. With the help of the crew I assisted
Phao and Sanoma Tora aboard.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the cruiser stepped to my side. "Our
mission here is fruitless," he said. "Word has just been brought me
that the palace has fallen before the onslaught of a mob of
infuriated citizens. The nobles have commandeered every craft upon
which they could lay hands and have fled. There is no one with whom
we can negotiate a peace. No one knows what has become of Tul
Axtar."</p>

<p>"I know," I told him, and then I narrated what had happened in
the apartment of the Jeddara.</p>

<p>"We must pursue him," he said. "We must overtake him and carry
him back to the Warlord."</p>

<p>"Where shall we look?" I asked. "The Jhama may lie within a
dozen sofads of us and even so we could not see her. I shall search
for him; never fear, and some day I shall find him, but it is
useless now to try to find the Jhama. Let us return to the flagship
of the Warlord."</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>I do not know that John Carter fully realized the loss that I
had sustained, but I suspect that he did for he offered me all the
resources of Helium in my search for Tavia.</p>

<p>I thanked him, but asked only for a fast ship; one in which I
might devote the remainder of my life in what I truly believed
would prove a futile search for Tavia, for how could I know where
in all wide Barsoom Tul Axtar would elect to hide. Doubtless there
were known to him many remote spots in his own empire where he
could live in safety for the balance of his allotted time on
Barsoom. To such a place he would go and because of the Jhama no
man would see him pass; there would be no clue by which to follow
him and he would take Tavia with him and she would be his slave. I
shuddered and my nails sank into my palms at the thought.</p>

<p>The Warlord ordered one of the newest and swiftest fliers of
Helium to be brought alongside the flagship. It was a trim craft of
the semi-cabin type that would easily accommodate four or five in
comfort. From his own stores he had provisions and water
transferred to it and he added wine from Ptarth and jars of the
famous honey of Dusar.</p>

<p>Sanoma Tora and Phao had been sent at once to a cabin by the
Warlord, for the deck of a man-of-war on duty is no place for
women. I was about to depart when a messenger came saying that
Sanoma Tora wished to see me.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to see her," I replied.</p>

<p>"Her companion also begged that you would come," replied the
messenger.</p>

<p>That was different. I had almost forgotten Phao, but if she
wished to see me I would go, and so I went at once to the cabin
where the two girls were. As I entered Sanoma Tora came forward and
threw herself upon her knees before me.</p>

<p>"Have pity on me, Hadron of Hastor," she cried. "I have been
wicked, but it was my vanity and not my heart that sinned. Do not
go away. Come back to Helium and I will devote my life to your
happiness. Tor Hatan, my father, is rich. The mate of his only
child may live forever in luxury."</p>

<p>I am afraid that my lips curled to the sneer that was in my
heart. What a petty soul was hers! Even in her humiliation and her
penitence she could see no beauty and no happiness greater than
wealth and power. She thought that she was changed, but I knew that
Sanoma Tora never could change.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Tan Hadron," she cried. "Come back to me, for I
love you. Now I know that I love you."</p>

<p>"Your love has come too late, Sanoma Tora," I said.</p>

<p>"You love another?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"The Jeddara of some of the strange countries you have been
through?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A slave girl," I replied.</p>

<p>Her eyes went wide in incredulity. She could not conceive that
one might choose a slave girl to the daughter of Tor Hatan.
"Impossible," she said.</p>

<p>"It is true, though," I assured her; "a little slave girl is
more desirable to Tan Hadron of Hastor than is Sanoma Tora, the
daughter of Tor Hatan," and with that I turned my back upon her and
faced Phao. "Good-bye, dear friend," I said. "Doubtless we shall
never meet again, but I shall see to it that you have a good home
in Hastor. I shall speak to the Warlord before I leave and have him
send you directly to my mother."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon my shoulder. "Let me go with you, Tan
Hadron," she said, "for perhaps while you are searching for Tavia
you will pass near Jhama."</p>

<p>I understood instantly what she meant, and I reproached myself
for having even temporarily forgotten Nur An. "You shall come with
me, Phao," I said, "and my first duty shall be to return to Jhama
and rescue Nur An from poor old Phor Tak."</p>

<p>Without another glance at Sanoma Tora I led Phao from the cabin,
and after a few parting words with the Warlord we boarded my new
ship and with friendly farewells in our ears, headed west toward
Jhama.</p>

<p>Being no longer protected by the invisibility compound of Phor
Tak, or the disintegrating ray resisting paint of Jahar, we were
forced to keep a sharp lookout for enemy ships, of which I had but
little fear if we sighted them in time for I knew that I could
outdistance any of them.</p>

<p>I set the destination control compass upon Jhama and opened the
throttle wide; the swift Barsoomian night had fallen; the only
sound was the rush of thin air along our sides which drowned out
the quiet purring of our motor.</p>

<p>For the first time since I had found her again in the quarters
of the Jeddara at Jahar, I had an opportunity to talk with Phao and
the first thing I asked her was for an explanation of the
abandonment of the Jhama after Tul Axtar had grounded Tavia and me
in U-Gor.</p>

<p>"It was an accident," she said, "that threw Tul Axtar into a
great fit of rage. We were headed for Jahar when he sighted one of
his own ships, which took us aboard as soon as they discovered the
identity of the jeddak. It was night and in the confusion of
boarding the Jaharian warship Tul Axtar momentarily forgot the
Jhama which must have drifted away from the larger craft the moment
that we left her. They cruised about searching for her for awhile,
but at last they had to give it up and the ship proceeded toward
Jahar."</p>

<p>The miracle of the presence of the Jhama at the top of the peak,
where we had so providentially found it in time to escape from the
hunting men of U-Gor, was now no longer a miracle. The prevailing
winds in this part of Barsoom are from the northwest at this time
of year. The Jhama had merely drifted with the wind and chanced to
lodge upon the highest peak of the range.</p>

<p>Phao also told me why Tul Axtar had originally abducted Sanoma
Tora from Helium. He had had his secret agents at Helium for some
time previous and they had reported to him that the best way to
lure the fleet of Helium to Jahar was to abduct a woman of some
noble family. He had instructed them to select a beautiful one, and
so they had decided upon the daughter of Tor Hatan.</p>

<p>"But how did they expect to lure the fleet of Helium to Jahar if
they left no clue as to the identity of the abductors of Sanoma
Tora?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They left no clue at the time because Tul Axtar was not ready
to receive the attack of Helium," explained Phao; "but he had
already sent his agents word to drop a hint as to the whereabouts
of Sanoma Tora when John Carter learned through other sources the
identity of her abductors."</p>

<p>"So it all worked out the way Tul Axtar had planned," I said,
"except the finish."</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>We passed the hours with brief snatches of conversation and long
silences, each occupied with our own thoughts&mdash;Phao's
doubtless a mixture of hope and fear, but there was little room for
hope in mine. The only pleasant prospects that lay before me lay in
rescuing Nur An and reuniting him and Phao. After that I would take
them to any country to which they wished to go and then return to
the vicinity of Jahar and prosecute my hopeless search.</p>

<p>"I heard what you said to Sanoma Tora in the cabin of the
flagship," said Phao after a long silence, "and I was glad."</p>

<p>"I said a number of things," I reminded her; "to which do you
refer?"</p>

<p>"You said that you loved Tavia," she replied.</p>

<p>"I said nothing of the kind," I rejoined rather shortly, for I
almost loathed that word.</p>

<p>"But you did," she insisted. "You said that you loved a little
slave girl and I know that you love Tavia. I have seen it in your
eyes."</p>

<p>"You have seen nothing of the kind. Because you are in love, you
think that everyone must be."</p>

<p>She laughed. "You love her and she loves you."</p>

<p>"We are only friends&mdash;very good friends," I insisted, "and
furthermore I know that Tavia does not love me."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Let us not speak of it any more," I said, but though I did not
speak of it, I thought about it. I recalled that I had told Sanoma
Tora that I loved a little slave girl and I knew that I had had
Tavia in my mind at the time, but I thought that I had said it more
to wound Sanoma Tora than for any other purpose. I tried to analyze
my own feelings, but at last I gave it up as a foolish thing to do.
Of course, I did not love Tavia; I loved no one; love was not for
me&mdash;Sanoma Tora had killed it within my breast, and I was
equally sure that Tavia did not love me; if she had, she would have
shown it and I was quite sure that she had never demonstrated any
other feeling for me than the finest of comradeship. We were just
what she had said we were&mdash;comrades in arms and nothing
else.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>It was still dark when I saw the gleaming white palace of Phor
Tak shining softly in the moonlight far below us. Late as it was,
there were lights in some of the rooms. I had hoped that all would
be asleep, for my plans depended upon my ability to enter the
palace secretly. I knew that Phor Tak never kept any watch at
night, feeling that none was needed in such an isolated spot.</p>

<p>Silently I dropped the flier until it rested upon the roof of
the building where Nur An and I had first landed, for I knew that
there I would find a passage to the palace below.</p>

<p>"Wait here at the controls, Phao," I whispered. "Nur An and I
may have to come away in a hurry and you must be ready."</p>

<p>She nodded her head understandingly, and a moment later I had
slipped quietly to the roof and was approaching the opening that
led down into the interior.</p>

<p>As I paused at the top of the spiral ramp I felt quickly of my
weapons to see that each was in its place. John Carter had fitted
me out anew. Once more I stood in the leather and metal of Helium,
with a full complement of weapons such as belong to a fighting man
of Barsoom. My long sword was of the best steel, for it was one of
John Carter's own. Beside this, I carried a short sword and a
dagger, and once again a heavy radium pistol hung at my hip. I
loosened the latter in its holster as I started down the spiral
ramp.</p>

<p>As I approached the bottom I heard a voice. It was coming from
the direction of Phor Tak's laboratory, the door of which opened
upon the corridor at the bottom of the ramp. I crept slowly
downward. The door leading to the laboratory was closed. Two men
were conversing. I could recognize the thin, high voice of Phor
Tak; the other voice was not that of Nur An; yet it was strangely
familiar.</p>

<p>"&mdash;riches beyond your dream," I heard the second man
say.</p>

<p>"I do not need riches," cackled Phor Tak. "Heigh-oo! Presently I
shall own all the riches in the world."</p>

<p>"You will need help," I could hear the other man say in a
pleading tone. "I can give you help; you shall have every ship of
my great fleet."</p>

<p>That remark brought me upstanding&mdash;"every ship of my great
fleet!" It could not be possible and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Gently I tried the door. To my surprise it swung open revealing
the interior of the room. Beneath a bright light stood Tul Axtar.
Fifty feet from him Phor Tak was standing behind a bench upon which
was mounted a disintegrating ray rifle, aimed full at Tul
Axtar.</p>

<p>Where was Tavia? Where was Nur An? Perhaps this man alone knew
where Tavia was and Phor Tak was about to destroy him. With a cry
of warning I leaped into the room. Tul Axtar and Phor Tak looked at
me quickly, surprise large upon their countenances.</p>

<p>"Heigh-oo!" screamed the old inventor. "So you have come back!
Knave! Ingrate! Traitor! But you have come back only to die."</p>

<p>"Wait," I cried, raising my hand. "Let me speak."</p>

<p>"Silence!" screamed Phor Tak. "You shall see Tul Axtar die. I
hated to kill him without someone to see&mdash;someone to witness
his death agony. I shall have my revenge on him first and then on
you."</p>

<p>"Stop!" I cried. His finger was already hovering over the button
that would snatch Tul Axtar into oblivion, perhaps with the secret
of the whereabouts of Tavia.</p>

<p>I drew my pistol. Phor Tak made a sudden motion with his hands
and disappeared. He vanished as though turned to thin air by his
own disintegrating rays, but I knew what had happened. I knew that
he had thrown a mantle of invisibility around himself and I fired
at the spot where he had last been visible.</p>

<p>At the same instant the floor opened beneath me and I shot into
utter darkness.</p>

<p>I felt myself hurtling along a smooth surface which gradually
became horizontal and an instant later I shot into a dimly lighted
apartment, which I knew must be located in the pits beneath the
palace.</p>

<p>I had clung to my pistol as I fell and now, as I arose to my
feet, I thrust it back into its holster; at least I was not
unarmed.</p>

<p>The dim light in the apartment, which was little better than no
light at all, I discovered, came from a ventilator in the ceiling
and that aside from the shaft that had conducted me to the cell,
there was no other opening in the wall or ceiling or floor. The
ventilator was about two feet in diameter and led straight up from
the center of the ceiling to the roof of the building, several
levels above. The lower end of the shaft was about two feet above
my finger tips when I extended them high above my head. This avenue
of escape, then, was useless, but, alas, how tantalizing. It was
maddening to see daylight and an open avenue to the outer world
just above me and be unable to reach it. I was glad that the sun
had risen, throwing its quick light over the scene, for had I
fallen here in utter darkness my plight would have seemed
infinitely worse than now, and my first ancestor knew that it was
bad enough. I turned my attention now to the chute through which I
had descended and I found that I could ascend it quite a little
distance, but presently it turned steeply upward and its smoothly
polished walls were unscalable.</p>

<p>I returned to the pits. I must escape, but now, as my eyes
became accustomed to the dim light, I saw strewn about the floor,
that which snatched away my last hope and filled me with horror.
Everywhere upon the stone flagging were heaps and mounds of human
bones picked clean by gnawing rats. I shuddered as I contemplated
the coming of night. How long before my bones, too, would be
numbered among the rest?</p>

<p>The thought made me frantic, not for myself but for Tavia. I
could not die. I must not die. I must live until I had found
her.</p>

<p>Hastily I circled the room, searching for some clue to hope, but
I found only rough-hewn stone set in soft mortar.</p>

<p>Soft mortar! With the realization, hope dawned anew. If I could
remove a few of these blocks and pile them one on top of the other,
I might easily reach the shaft that terminated in the ceiling above
my head. Drawing my dagger I fell to work, scraping and scratching
at the mortar about one of the stones in the nearest wall. It
seemed slow work, but in reality I had loosened the stone in an
incredibly short time. The mortar was poor stuff and crumbled away
easily. As I drew the block out my first plan faded in the light of
what I saw in front of me. Beyond the opening I saw a corridor at
the foot of a spiral ramp leading upward, and from somewhere above,
daylight was filtering down.</p>

<p>I knew that if I could remove three more of those stones before
I was detected I could worm my body through the opening into the
corridor beyond, and you may well believe that I worked
rapidly.</p>

<p>One by one the blocks were loosened and removed and it was with
a feeling of exultation that I slipped through into the corridor.
Above me rose a spiral ramp. Where it led, I did not know, but at
least it led out of the pits. Cautiously, and yet without any
hesitation, I ascended. I must try to reach the laboratory before
Phor Tak had slain Tul Axtar. This time I would make sure of the
old inventor before I entered the room and I prayed to all my
ancestors that I should be in time.</p>

<p>Doors, leading from the ramp to various levels of the palace,
were all locked and I was forced to ascend to the roof. As it
chanced the wing upon which I found myself was more or less
detached, so that at first glance I could see no way whereby I
could make my way from it to any of the adjoining roofs.</p>

<p>As I walked around the edge of the building hurriedly, looking
for some means of descent to the roof below, I saw something one
level below me that instantly charged my attention. It was a man's
leg protruding from a window, as though he had thrown one limb
across the sill. A moment later I saw an arm emerge, and the top of
a man's head and his shoulders were visible as he leaned out. He
reached down and up and I saw something appear directly beneath him
that had not been there before, and at the same instant I caught a
glimpse of a girl, lying a few feet further down, and then I saw
the man slide over the sill quickly and drop down and disappear,
and all that lay below me was the flagging of a courtyard.</p>

<p>But in that brief instant I knew precisely what I had seen. I
had seen Tul Axtar raise the hatch of the Jhama. I had seen Tavia
lying bound upon the floor of the ship beneath the hatch. I had
seen Tul Axtar enter the interior of the craft and close the hatch
above his head.</p>

<p>It takes a long while to tell it when compared with the time in
which it actually transpired; nor was I so long in acting as I have
been in telling.</p>

<p>As the hatch closed, I leaped.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; I FIND A
PRINCESS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT would be as unreasonable to aver that I fully
visualized the outcome of my act as I leaped out into space with
nothing visible between me and the flagstones of the courtyard
forty feet below as it would be to assume that I acted solely upon
unreasoning impulse. There are emergencies in which the mind
functions with inconceivable celerity. Perceptions are received,
judgments arrived at and reason operates to a definite conclusion
all so swiftly that the three acts appear simultaneous. Thus must
have been the process in this instance.</p>

<p>I knew where the narrow walkway upon the upper deck of the Jhama
must lie in the seemingly empty space below me, for I had jumped
almost the instant that the hatch had closed. Of course I know now,
and I knew then, that it would have been a dangerous feat and
difficult of achievement even had I been able to see the Jhama
below me; yet as I look back upon it now there was nothing else
that I could have done. It was my one, my last chance to save Tavia
from a fate worse than death&mdash;it was perhaps my last
opportunity ever to see her again. As I jumped then I should jump
again under like conditions even though I knew that I should miss
the Jhama, for now as then I know that I should rather die than
lose Tavia; although then I did not know why, while now I do.</p>

<p>But I did not miss. I landed squarely upon my feet upon the
narrow walkway. The impact of my weight upon the upper deck of the
craft must have been noticeable to Tul Axtar, for I could feel the
Jhama drop a little beneath me. Doubtless he wondered what had
happened, but I do not think that he guessed the truth. However, he
did not raise the hatch as I hoped he would, but instead he must
have leaped to the controls at once for almost immediately the
Jhama rose swiftly at an acute angle, which made it difficult for
me to cling to her since her upper deck was not equipped with
harness rings. By grasping the forward edge of the turret, however,
I managed to hold on.</p>

<p>As Tul Axtar gained sufficient altitude and straightened out
upon his course he opened the throttle wide so that the wind
rushing at me at terrific velocity seemed momentarily upon the
point of carrying me from my precarious hold and hurtling me to the
ground far below. Fortunately I am a strong man&mdash;none other
could have survived that ordeal&mdash;yet how utterly helpless I
was.</p>

<p>Had Tul Axtar guessed the truth he could have raised the after
hatch and had me at his mercy, for though my pistol hung at my side
I could not have released either hand to use it, but doubtless Tul
Axtar did not know, or if he did he hoped that the high speed of
the ship would dislodge whoever or whatever it might have been that
he felt drop upon it.</p>

<p>I had hung there but a short time before I realized that
eventually my hold must weaken and be torn loose. Something must be
done to rectify my position. Tavia must be saved and because I
alone could save her, I must not die.</p>

<p>Straining every thew I dragged myself further forward until I
lay with my chest upon the turret. Slowly, inch by inch, I wormed
myself forward. The tubular sheeting of the periscope was just in
front of me. If I could but reach that with one hand I might hope
to attain greater safety. The wind was buffeting me, seeking to
tear me away. I sought a better hold with my left forearm about the
turret and then I reached quickly forward with my right hand and my
fingers closed about the sheathing.</p>

<p>After that it was not difficult to stretch a part of my harness
about the front of the turret. Now I found that I could have one
hand free, but until the ship stopped I could not hope to
accomplish anything more.</p>

<p>What was transpiring beneath me? Could Tavia be safe even for a
brief time in the power of Tul Axtar? The thought drove me frantic.
The Jhama must be stopped, and then an inspiration came to me.</p>

<p>With my free hand I unsnapped my pocket pouch from my harness
and drawing myself still further forward, I managed to place the
opened pouch over the eye of the periscope.</p>

<p>Immediately Tul Axtar was blind; he could see nothing, nor was
it long before the reaction that I had expected and hoped for
came&mdash;the Jhama slowed down and finally came to a stop.</p>

<p>I had been lying partially upon the forward hatch and now I drew
myself away from and in front of it. I hoped that it would be the
forward hatch that he would open. It was the closer to him. I
waited, and then glancing forward I saw that he was opening the
ports. In this way he could see to navigate the ship and my plan
was blocked.</p>

<p>I was disappointed, but I would not give up hope. Very quietly I
tried the forward hatch, but it was locked upon the inside. Then I
made my way swiftly and silently to the after hatch. If he should
start the Jhama again at full speed now, doubtless I should be
lost, but I felt that I was forced to risk the chance. Already the
Jhama was in motion again as I laid my hand upon the hatch cover.
This time I was neither silent nor gentle. I heaved vigorously and
the hatch opened. Not an instant did I hesitate and as the Jhama
leaped forward again at full speed, I dropped through the hatchway
to the interior of the craft.</p>

<p>As I struck the deck Tul Axtar heard me and wheeling from the
controls to face me, he recognized me. I think I never before
beheld such an expression of mingled astonishment, hatred and fear
as convulsed his features. At his feet lay Tavia, so quietly still
that I thought her dead, and then Tul Axtar reached for his pistol
and I for mine, but I had led a cleaner life than Tul Axtar had. My
mind and muscles coordinate with greater celerity than can those of
one who has wasted his fiber in dissipation.</p>

<p>Point blank I fired at his putrid heart and Tul Axtar, Jeddak
and tyrant of Jahar, lunged forward upon the lower deck of the
Jhama dead.</p>

<p>Instantly I sprang to Tavia's side and turned her over. She had
been bound and gagged and, for some unaccountable reason,
blindfolded as well, but she was not dead. I almost sobbed for joy
when I realized that. How my fingers seemed to fumble in their
haste to free her; yet it was only a matter of seconds ere it was
done and I was crushing her in my arms.</p>

<p>I know that my tears fell upon her upturned face as our lips
were pressed together, but I am not ashamed of that, and Tavia wept
too and clung to me and I could feel her dear body tremble. How
terrified she must have been, and yet I know she had never shown it
to Tul Axtar. It was the reaction&mdash;the mingling of relief and
joy at the moment that the despair had been blackest.</p>

<p>In that instant, as our hearts beat together and she drew me
closer to her, a great truth dawned upon me. What a stupid fool I
had been! How could I ever have thought that the sentiment that I
entertained for Sanoma Tora was love? How could I ever believe that
my love for Tavia had been such a weak thing as friendship? I drew
her closer, if such were possible.</p>

<p>"My princess," I whispered.</p>

<p>Upon Barsoom those two words, spoken by man to maid, have a
peculiar and unalterable significance, for no man speaks thus to
any woman that he does not wish for wife.</p>

<p>"No, no," sobbed Tavia, "Take me, I am yours; but I am only a
slave girl. Tan Hadron of Hastor cannot mate with such."</p>

<p>Even then she thought only of me and my happiness, and not of
herself at all. How different she was from such as Sanoma Tora? I
had risked my life to win a clod of dirt and I had found a
priceless jewel.</p>

<p>I looked her in the eyes, those beautiful, fathomless wells of
love and understanding. "I love you, Tavia," I said. "Tell me that
I may have the right to call you my princess."</p>

<p>"Even though I be a slave?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Even though you were a thousand times less than a slave," I
told her.</p>

<p>She sighed and snuggled closer to me. "My chieftain," she
whispered in a low, low voice.</p>

<p>That, as far as I, Tan Hadron of Hastor, is concerned, is the
end of the story. That instant marked the highest pinnacle to which
I may ever hope to achieve, but there is more that may interest
those who have come thus far with me upon adventures that have
carried me half way around the southern hemisphere of Barsoom.</p>

<p>When Tavia and I could tear ourselves apart, which was not soon,
I opened the lower hatch and let the corpse of Tul Axtar find its
last resting place upon the barren ground below. Then we turned
back toward Jhama, where we discovered that earlier in the morning
Nur An had come to one of the roofs of the palace and been
discovered by Phao.</p>

<p>When Nur An had learned that I had entered the palace just
before dawn, he had become apprehensive and instituted a search for
me. He had not known of the coming of Tul Axtar and believed that
the Jeddak must have arrived after he had retired for the night;
nor had he known how close Tavia had been, lying bound in the Jhama
close beside the palace wall.</p>

<p>His search of the palace, however, had revealed the fact that
Phor Tak was missing. He had summoned the slaves and a careful
search had been made, but no sign of Phor Tak was visible.</p>

<p>It occurred to me then that I might solve the question as to the
whereabouts of the old scientist. "Come with me," I said to Nur An;
"Perhaps I can find Phor Tak for you."</p>

<p>I led him to the laboratory. "There is no use searching there,"
he said, "we have looked in a hundred times today. A glance will
reveal the fact that the laboratory is deserted."</p>

<p>"Wait," I said. "Let us not be in too much of a hurry. Come with
me; perhaps yet I may disclose the whereabouts of Phor Tak."</p>

<p>With a shrug he followed me as I entered the vast laboratory and
walked toward the bench upon which a disintegrating rifle was
mounted. Just back of the bench my foot struck something that I
could not see, but that I had rather expected to find there, and
stooping I felt a huddled form beneath a covering of soft
cloth.</p>

<p>My fingers closed upon the invisible fabric and I drew it aside.
There, before us on the floor, lay the dead body of Phor Tak, a
bullet hole in the center of his breast.</p>

<p>"Name of Issus!" cried Nur An. "Who did this?"</p>

<p>"I," I replied, and then I told him what had happened in the
laboratory as the last night waned.</p>

<p>He looked around hurriedly. "Cover it up quickly," he said. "The
slaves must not know. They would destroy us. Let us get out of here
quickly."</p>

<p>I drew the cloak of invisibility over the body of Phor Tak
again. "I have work here before I leave," I said.</p>

<p>"What?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Help me gather all of the disintegrating rays shells and rifles
into one end of the room."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am going to save a world, Nur An," I said.</p>

<p>Then he fell to and helped me and when they were all collected
in a pile at the far end of the laboratory, I selected a single
shell and returning to the rifle mounted upon the bench I inserted
it in the chamber, closed the block and turned the muzzle of the
weapon upon that frightful aggregation of death and disaster.</p>

<p>As I pressed the button all that remained in Jhama of Phor Tak's
dangerous invention disappeared in thin air, with the exception of
the single rifle, for which there remained no ammunition. With it
had gone his model of The Flying Death and with him the secret had
been lost.</p>

<p>Nur An told me that the slaves were becoming suspicious of us
and as there was no necessity of risking ourselves further, we
embarked upon the flier that John Carter had given me, and, taking
the Jhama in tow, set our course toward Helium.</p>

<p>We overtook the fleet shortly before it reached the Twin Cities
of Greater Helium and Lesser Helium and upon the deck of John
Carter's flagship we received a welcome and a great ovation, and
shortly thereafter there occurred one of the most remarkable and
dramatic incidents that I have ever beheld. We were holding
something of an informal reception upon the forward deck of the
great battleship. Officers and nobles were pressing forward to be
presented and numerous were the appreciative eyes that admired
Tavia.</p>

<p>It was the turn of the Dwar, Kal Tavan, who had been a slave in
the palace of Tor Hatan. As he came face to face with Tavia, I saw
a look of surprise in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Your name is Tavia?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and yours is Tavan. They are similar."</p>

<p>"I do not need to ask from what country you are," he said. "You
are Tavia of Tjanath."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because you are my daughter," he replied. "Tavia is the name
your mother gave you. You look like her. By that alone I should
have known my daughter anywhere."</p>

<p>Very gently he took her in his arms and I saw tears in his eyes,
and hers too, as he pressed his lips against her forehead, and then
he turned to me.</p>

<p>"They told me that the brave Tan Hadron of Hastor had chosen to
mate with a slave girl," he said; "but that is not true. Your
princess is in truth a princess&mdash;the granddaughter of a jed.
She might have been the daughter of a jed had I remained in
Tjanath."</p>

<p>How devious are the paths of fate! How strange and unexpected
the destinations to which they lead. I had set out upon one of
these paths with the intention of marrying Sanoma Tora at the end.
Sanoma Tora had set out upon another in the hopes of marrying a
Jeddak. At the end of her path, she had found only ignominy and
disgrace. At the end of mine I had found a princess.</p>
