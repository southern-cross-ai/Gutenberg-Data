  <h2><a name="c01"
     id="c01">I. &mdash; THE THREE HORSEMEN OF APOCALYPSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The curious and sometimes creepy effect which Mr. Pond
produced upon me,
  despite his commonplace courtesy and dapper decorum, was possibly connected
  with some memories of childhood; and the vague verbal association of his
  name. He was a Government official who was an old friend of my father; and I
  fancy my infantile imagination had somehow mixed up the name of Mr. Pond with
  the pond in the garden. When one came to think of it, he was curiously like
  the pond in the garden. He was so quiet at all normal times, so neat in shape
  and so shiny, so to speak, in his ordinary reflections of earth and sky and
  the common daylight. And yet I knew there were some queer things in the pond
  in the garden. Once in a hundred times, on one or two days during the whole
  year, the pond would look oddly different; or there would come a flitting
  shadow or a flash in its flat serenity; and a fish or a frog or some more
  grotesque creature would show itself to the sky. And I knew there were
  monsters in Mr. Pond also: monsters in his mind which rose only for a moment
  to the surface and sank again. They took the form of monstrous remarks, in
  the middle of all his mild and rational remarks. Some people thought he had
  suddenly gone mad in the midst of his sanest conversation. But even they had
  to admit that he must have suddenly gone sane again.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, again, this foolish fantasy was fixed in the youthful mind
  because, at certain moments, Mr. Pond looked rather like a fish himself. His
  manners were not only quite polite but quite conventional; his very gestures
  were conventional, with the exception of one occasional trick of plucking at
  his pointed beard which seemed to come on him chiefly when he was at last
  forced to be serious about one of his strange and random statements. At such
  moments he would stare owlishly in front of him and pull his beard, which had
  a comic effect of pulling his mouth open, as if it were the mouth of a puppet
  with hairs for wires. This odd, occasional opening and shutting of his mouth,
  without speech, had quite a startling similarity to the slow gaping and
  gulping of a fish. But it never lasted for more than a few seconds, during
  which, I suppose, he swallowed the unwelcome proposal of explaining what on
  earth he meant.</p>

  <p>He was talking quite quietly one day to Sir Hubert Wotton, the well-known
  diplomatist; they were seated under gaily-striped tents or giant parasols in
  our own garden, and gazing towards the pond which I had perversely associated
  with him. They happened to be talking about a part of the world that both of
  them knew well, and very few people in Western Europe at all: the vast flats
  fading into fens and swamps that stretch across Pomerania and Poland and
  Russia and the rest; right away, for all I know, into the Siberian deserts.
  And Mr. Pond recalled that, across a region where the swamps are deepest and
  intersected by pools and sluggish rivers, there runs a single road raised on
  a high causeway with steep and sloping sides: a straight path safe enough for
  the ordinary pedestrian, but barely broad enough for two horsemen to ride
  abreast. That is the beginning of the story.</p>

  <p>It concerned a time not very long ago, but a time in which horsemen were
  still used much more than they are at present, though already rather less as
  fighters than as couriers. Suffice it to say that it was in one of the many
  wars that have laid waste that part of the world&mdash;in so far as it is
  possible to lay waste such a wilderness. Inevitably it involved the pressure
  of the Prussian system on the nation of the Poles, but beyond that it is not
  necessary to expound the politics of the matter, or discuss its rights and
  wrongs here. Let us merely say, more lightly, that Mr. Pond amused the
  company with a riddle.</p>

  <p>"I expect you remember hearing," said Pond, "of all the excitement there
  was about Paul Petrowski, the poet from Cracow, who did two things rather
  dangerous in those days: moving from Cracow and going to live in Poznan; and
  trying to combine being a poet with being a patriot. The town he was living
  in was held at the moment by the Prussians; it was situated exactly at the
  eastern end of the long causeway; the Prussian command having naturally taken
  care to hold the bridgehead of such a solitary bridge across such a sea of
  swamps. But their base for that particular operation was at the western end
  of the causeway; the celebrated Marshal Von Grock was in general command;
  and, as it happened, his own old regiment, which was still his favourite
  regiment, the White Hussars, was posted nearest to the beginning of the great
  embanked road. Of course, everything was spick and span, down to every detail
  of the wonderful white uniforms, with the flame-coloured baldrick slung
  across them; for this was just before the universal use of colours like mud
  and clay for all the uniforms in the world. I don't blame them for that; I
  sometimes feel the old epoch of heraldry was a finer thing than all that
  epoch of imitative colouring, that came in with natural history and the
  worship of chameleons and beetles. Anyhow, this crack regiment of cavalry in
  the Prussian service still wore its own uniform; and, as you will see, that
  was another element in the fiasco. But it wasn't only the uniforms; it was
  the uniformity. The whole thing went wrong because the discipline was too
  good. Grock's soldiers obeyed him too well; so he simply couldn't do a thing
  he wanted."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that's a paradox," said Wotton, heaving a sigh. "Of course,
  it's very clever and all that; but really, it's all nonsense, isn't it? Oh, I
  know people say in a general way that there's too much discipline in the
  German army. But you can't have too much discipline in an army."</p>

  <p>"But I don't say it in a general way," said Pond plaintively. "I say it in
  a particular way, about this particular case. Grock failed because his
  soldiers obeyed him. Of course, if <i>one</i> of his soldiers had obeyed him,
  it wouldn't have been so bad. But when <i>two</i> of his soldiers obeyed
  him&mdash;why, really, the poor old devil had no chance."</p>

  <p>Wotton laughed in a guttural fashion. "I'm glad to hear your new military
  theory. You'd allow one soldier in a regiment to obey orders; but two
  soldiers obeying orders strikes you as carrying Prussian discipline a bit too
  far."</p>

  <p>"I haven't got any military theory. I'm talking about a military fact,"
  replied Mr. Pond placidly. "It is a military fact that Grock failed, because
  two of his soldiers obeyed him. It is a military fact that he might have
  succeeded, if one of them had disobeyed him. You can make up what theories
  you like about it afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I don't go in much for theories myself," said Wotton rather stiffly, as
  if he had been touched by a trivial insult.</p>

  <p>At this moment could be seen striding across the sun-chequered lawn, the
  large and swaggering figure of Captain Gahagan, the highly incongruous friend
  and admirer of little Mr. Pond. He had a flaming flower in his buttonhole and
  a grey top-hat slightly slanted upon his ginger-haired head; and he walked
  with a swagger that seemed to come out of an older period of dandies and
  duellists, though he himself was comparatively young. So long as his tall,
  broad-shouldered figure was merely framed against the sunlight, he looked
  like the embodiment of all arrogance. When he came and sat down, with the sun
  on his face, there was a sudden contradiction of all this in his very soft
  brown eyes, which looked sad and even a little anxious.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond, interrupting his monologue, was almost in a twitter of
  apologies: "I'm afraid I'm talking too much, as usual; the truth is I was
  talking about that poet, Petrowski, who was nearly executed in
  Poznan&mdash;quite a long time ago. The military authorities on the spot
  hesitated and were going to let him go, unless they had direct orders from
  Marshal Von Grock or higher; but Marshal Von Grock was quite determined on
  the poet's death; and sent orders for his execution that very evening. A
  reprieve was sent afterwards to save him; but as the man carrying the
  reprieve died on the way, the prisoner was released, after all."</p>

  <p>"But as&mdash;" repeated Wotton mechanically.</p>

  <p>"The man carrying the <i>reprieve,"</i> added Gahagan somewhat
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Died on the way," muttered Wotton.</p>

  <p>"Why then, of course, the prisoner was released," observed Gahagan in a
  loud and cheerful voice. "All as clear as clear can be. Tell us another of
  those stories, Grandpapa."</p>

  <p>"It's a perfectly true story," protested Pond, "and it happened exactly as
  I say. It isn't any paradox or anything like that. Only, of course, you have
  to know the story to see how simple it is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Gahagan. "I think I should have to know the story, before
  realizing how simple it is."</p>

  <p>"Better tell us the story and have done with it," said Wotton
  shortly.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Paul Petrowski was one of those utterly unpractical men who
  are of prodigious importance in practical politics. His power lay in the fact
  that he was a national poet but an international singer. That is, he happened
  to have a very fine and powerful voice, with which he sang his own patriotic
  songs in half the concert halls of the world. At home, of course, he was a
  torch and trumpet of revolutionary hopes, especially then, in the sort of
  international crisis in which practical politicians disappear, and their
  place is taken by men either more or less practical than themselves. For the
  true idealist and the real realist have at least the love of action in
  common. And the practical politician thrives by offering practical objections
  to any action. What the idealist does may be unworkable, and what the man of
  action does may be unscrupulous; but in neither trade can a man win a
  reputation by doing nothing. It is odd that these two extreme types stood at
  the two extreme ends of that one ridge and road among the marshes&mdash;the
  Polish poet a prisoner in the town at one end, the Prussian soldier a
  commander in the camp at the other.</p>

  <p>For Marshal Von Grock was a true Prussian, not only entirely practical but
  entirely prosaic. He had never read a line of poetry himself; but he was no
  fool. He had the sense of reality which belongs to soldiers; and it prevented
  him from falling into the asinine error of the practical politician. He did
  not scoff at visions; he only hated them. He knew that a poet or a prophet
  could be as dangerous as an army. And he was resolved that the poet should
  die. It was his one compliment to poetry; and it was sincere.</p>

  <p>He was at the moment sitting at a table in his tent; the spiked helmet
  that he always wore in public was lying in front of him; and his massive head
  looked quite bald, though it was only closely shaven. His whole face was also
  shaven; and had no covering but a pair of very strong spectacles, which alone
  gave an enigmatic look to his heavy and sagging visage. He turned to a
  Lieutenant standing by, a German of the pale-haired and rather pudding-faced
  variety, whose blue saucer-eyes were staring vacantly.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Von Hocheimer," he said, "did you say His Highness would reach
  the camp to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Seven forty-five, Marshal," replied the Lieutenant, who seemed rather
  reluctant to speak at all, like a large animal learning a new trick of
  talking.</p>

  <p>"Then there is just time," said Grock, "to send you with that order for
  execution, before he arrives. We must serve His Highness in every way, but
  especially in saving him needless trouble. He will be occupied enough
  reviewing the troops; see that everything is placed at His Highness's
  disposal. He will be leaving again for the next outpost in an hour."</p>

  <p>The large Lieutenant seemed partially to come to life and made a shadowy
  salute. "Of course, Marshal, we must all obey His Highness."</p>

  <p>"I said we must all serve His Highness," said the Marshal.</p>

  <p>With a sharper movement than usual, he unhooked his heavy spectacles and
  rapped them down upon the table. If the pale blue eyes of the Lieutenant
  could have seen anything of the sort, or if they could have opened any wider
  even if they had, they might as well have opened wide enough at the
  transformation made by the gesture. It was like the removal of an iron mask.
  An instant before, Marshal Von Grock had looked uncommonly like a rhinoceros,
  with his heavy folds of leathery cheek and jaw. Now he was a new kind of
  monster: a rhinoceros with the eyes of an eagle. The bleak blaze of his old
  eyes would have told almost anybody that he had something within that was not
  merely heavy; at least, that there was a part of him made of steel and not
  only of iron. For all men live by a spirit, though it were an evil spirit, or
  one so strange to the commonalty of Christian men that they hardly know
  whether it be good or evil.</p>

  <p>"I said we must all serve His Highness," repeated Grock. "I will speak
  more plainly, and say we must all save His Highness. Is it not enough for our
  kings that they should be our gods? Is it not enough for them to be served
  and saved? It is we who must do the serving and saving."</p>

  <p>Marshal Von Grock seldom talked, or even thought, as more theoretical
  people would count thinking. And it will generally be found that men of his
  type, when they do happen to think aloud, very much prefer to talk to the
  dog. They have even a certain patronizing relish in using long words and
  elaborate arguments before the dog. It would be unjust to compare Lieutenant
  Von Hocheimer to a dog. It would be unjust to the dog, who is a much more
  sensitive and vigilant creature. It would be truer to say that Grock in one
  of his rare moments of reflection, had the comfort and safety of feeling that
  he was reflecting aloud in the presence of a cow or a cabbage.</p>

  <p>"Again and again, in the history of our Royal House, the servant has saved
  the master," went on Grock, "and often got little but kicks for it, from the
  outer world at least, which always whines sentimentalism against the
  successful and the strong. But at least we were successful and we were
  strong. They cursed Bismarck for deceiving even his own master over the Ems
  telegram; but it made that master the master of the world. Paris was taken;
  Austria dethroned; and we were safe. To-night Paul Petrowski will be dead;
  and we shall again be safe. That is why I am sending you with his
  death-warrant at once. You understand that you are bearing the order for
  Petrowski's instant execution&mdash;and that you must remain to see it
  obeyed?"</p>

  <p>The inarticulate Hocheimer saluted; he could understand that all right.
  And he had some qualities of a dog, after all: he was as brave as a bulldog;
  and he could be faithful to the death.</p>

  <p>"You must mount and ride at once," went on Grock, "and see that nothing
  delays or thwarts you. I know for a fact that fool Arnheim is going to
  release Petrowski to-night, if no message comes. Make all speed."</p>

  <p>And the Lieutenant again saluted and went out into the night; and mounting
  one of the superb white chargers that were part of the splendour of that
  splendid corps, began to ride along the high, narrow road along the ridge,
  almost like the top of a wall, which overlooked the dark horizon, the dim
  patterns and decaying colours of those mighty marshes.</p>

  <p>Almost as the last echoes of his horse's hoofs died away along the
  causeway, Von Grock rose and put on his helmet and his spectacles and came to
  the door of his tent; but for another reason. The chief men of his staff, in
  full dress, were already approaching him; and all along the more distant
  lines there were the sounds of ritual salutation and the shouting of orders.
  His Highness the Prince had come.</p><br>

  <p class="first">His Highness the Prince was something of a contrast, at
  least in externals, to the men around him; and, even in other things,
  something of an exception in his world. He also wore a spiked helmet, but
  that of another regiment, black with glints of blue steel; and there was
  something half incongruous and half imaginatively appropriate, in some
  antiquated way, in the combination of that helmet with the long, dark,
  flowing beard, amid all those shaven Prussians. As if in keeping with the
  long, dark, flowing beard, he wore a long, dark, flowing cloak, blue with one
  blazing star on it of the highest Royal Order; and under the blue cloak he
  wore a black uniform. Though as German as any man, he was a very different
  kind of German; and something in his proud but abstracted face was consonant
  with the legend that the one true passion of his life was music.</p>

  <p>In truth, the grumbling Grock was inclined to connect with that remote
  eccentricity the, to him, highly irritating and exasperating fact that the
  Prince did not immediately proceed to the proper review and reception by the
  troops, already drawn out in all the labyrinthine parade of the military
  etiquette of their nation; but plunged at once impatiently into the subject
  which Grock most desired to see left alone: the subject of this infernal
  Pole, his popularity and his peril; for the Prince had heard some of the
  man's songs sung in half the opera-houses of Europe.</p>

  <p>"To talk of executing a man like that is madness," said the Prince,
  scowling under his black helmet. "He is not a common Pole. He is a European
  institution. He would be deplored and deified by our allies, by our friends,
  even by our fellow-Germans. Do you want to be the mad women who murdered
  Orpheus?"</p>

  <p>"Highness," said the Marshal, "he would be deplored; but he would be dead.
  He would be deified; but he would be dead. Whatever he means to do, he would
  never do it. Whatever he is doing, he would do no more. Death is the fact of
  all facts; and I am rather fond of facts."</p>

  <p>"Do you know nothing of the world?" demanded the Prince.</p>

  <p>"I care nothing for the world," answered Grock, "beyond the last black and
  white post of the Fatherland."</p>

  <p>"God in heaven," cried His Highness, "you would have hanged Goethe for a
  quarrel with Weimar!"</p>

  <p>"For the safety of your Royal House," answered Grock, "without one
  instant's hesitation."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence and the Prince said sharply and suddenly: "What
  does this mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means that I had not an instant's hesitation," replied the Marshal
  steadily. "I have already myself sent orders for the execution of
  Petrowski."</p>

  <p>The Prince rose like a great dark eagle, the swirl of his cloak like the
  sweep of mighty wings; and all men knew that a wrath beyond mere speech had
  made him a man of action. He did not even speak to Von Grock; but talking
  across him, at the top of his voice, called out to the second in command,
  General Von Voglen, a stocky man with a square head, who had stood in the
  background as motionless as a stone.</p>

  <p>"Who has the best horse in your cavalry division, General? Who is the best
  rider?"</p>

  <p>"Arnold Von Schacht has a horse that might beat a racehorse," replied the
  General promptly. "And rides it as well as a jockey. He is of the White
  Hussars."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the Prince, with the same new ring in his voice. "Let
  him ride at once after the man with this mad message and stop him. I will
  give him authority, which I think the distinguished Marshal will not dispute.
  Bring me pen and ink."</p>

  <p>He sat down, shaking out the cloak, and they brought him writing
  materials; and he wrote firmly and with a flourish the order, overriding all
  other orders, for the reprieve and release of Petrowski the Pole.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Then amid a dead silence, in the midst of which old Grock
  stood with an unblinking stare like a stone idol of prehistoric times, he
  swept out of the room, trailing his mantle and sabre. He was so violently
  displeased that no man dared to remind him of the formal reviewing of the
  troops. But Arnold Von Schacht, a curly-haired active youth, looking more
  like a boy, but wearing more than one medal on the white uniform of the
  Hussars, clicked his heels, and received the folded paper from the Prince;
  then, striding out, he sprang on his horse and flew along the high, narrow
  road like a silver arrow or a shooting star.</p>

  <p>The old Marshal went back slowly and calmly to his tent, slowly and calmly
  removed his spiked helmet and his spectacles, and laid them on the table as
  before. Then he called out to an orderly just outside the tent; and bade him
  fetch Sergeant Schwartz of the White Hussars immediately.</p>

  <p>A minute later, there presented himself before the Marshal a gaunt and
  wiry man, with a great scar across his jaw, rather dark for a German, unless
  all his colours had been changed by years of smoke and storm and bad weather.
  He saluted and stood stiffly at attention, as the Marshal slowly raised his
  eyes to him. And vast as was the abyss between the Imperial Marshal, with
  Generals under him, and that one battered non-commissioned officer, it is
  true that of all the men who have talked in this tale, these two men alone
  looked and understood each other without words.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant," said the Marshal, curtly, "I have seen you twice before. Once,
  I think, when you won the prize of the whole army for marksmanship with the
  carbine."</p>

  <p>The sergeant saluted and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"And once again," went on Von Grock, "when you were questioned for
  shooting that damned old woman who would not give us information about the
  ambush. The incident caused considerable comment at the time, even in some of
  our own circles. Influence, however, was exerted on your side. My
  influence."</p>

  <p>The sergeant saluted again; and was still silent. The Marshal continued to
  speak in a colourless but curiously candid way.</p>

  <p>"His Highness the Prince has been misinformed and deceived on a point
  essential to his own safety and that of the Fatherland. Under this error, he
  has rashly sent a reprieve to the Pole Petrowski, who is to be executed
  to-night. I repeat: who is to be executed to-night. You must immediately ride
  after Von Schacht, who carried the reprieve, and stop him."</p>

  <p>"I can hardly hope to overtake him, Marshal," said Sergeant Schwartz. "He
  has the swiftest horse in the regiment, and is the finest rider."</p>

  <p>"I did not tell you to overtake him. I told you to stop him," said Grock.
  Then he spoke more slowly: "A man may often be stopped or recalled by various
  signals: by shouting or shooting." His voice dragged still more ponderously,
  but without a pause. "The discharge of a carbine might attract his
  attention."</p>

  <p>And then the dark sergeant saluted for the third time; and his grim mouth
  was again shut tight.</p>

  <p>"The world is changed," said Grock, "not by what is said, or what is
  blamed or praised, but by what is done. The world never recovers from what is
  done. At this moment the killing of a man is a thing that must be done." He
  suddenly flashed his brilliant eyes of steel at the other, and added: "I
  mean, of course, Petrowski."</p>

  <p>And Sergeant Schwartz smiled still more grimly; and he also, lifting the
  flap of the tent, went out into the darkness and mounted his horse and
  rode.</p>

  <p>The last of the three riders was even less likely than the first to
  indulge in imaginative ideas for their own sake. But because he also was in
  some imperfect manner human, he could not but feel, on such a night and such
  an errand, the oppressiveness of that inhuman landscape. While he rode along
  that one abrupt ridge, there spread out to infinity all round him something a
  myriad times more inhuman than the sea. For a man could not swim in it, nor
  sail boats on it, nor do anything human with it; he could only sink in it,
  and practically without a struggle. The sergeant felt vaguely the presence of
  some primordial slime that was neither solid nor liquid nor capable of any
  form; and he felt its presence behind the forms of all things.</p>

  <p>He was atheist, like so many thousands of dull, clever men in Northern
  Germany; but he was not that happier sort of pagan who can see in human
  progress a natural flowering of the earth. That world before him was not a
  field in which green or living things evolved and developed and bore fruit;
  it was only an abyss in which all living things would sink for ever as in a
  bottomless pit; and the thought hardened him for all the strange duties he
  had to do in so hateful a world. The grey-green blotches of flattened
  vegetation, seen from above like a sprawling map, seemed more like the chart
  of a disease than a development; and the land-locked pools might have been of
  poison rather than water. He remembered some humanitarian fuss or other about
  the poisoning of pools.</p>

  <p>But the reflections of the sergeant, like most reflections of men not
  normally reflective, had a root in some subconscious strain on his nerves and
  his practical intelligence. The truth was that the straight road before him
  was not only dreary, but seemed interminably long. He would never have
  believed he could have ridden so far without catching some distant glimpse of
  the man he followed. Von Schacht must indeed have the fleetest of horses to
  have got so far ahead already; for, after all, he had only started, at
  whatever speed, within a comparatively short time. As Schwartz had said, he
  hardly expected to overtake him; but a very realistic sense of the distances
  involved had told him that he must very soon come in sight of him. And then,
  just as despair was beginning to descend and spread itself vaguely over the
  desolate landscape, he saw him at last.</p>

  <p>A white spot, which slightly, slowly, enlarged into something like a white
  figure, appeared far ahead, riding furiously. It enlarged to that extent
  because Schwartz managed a spurt of riding furiously himself; but it was
  large enough to show the faint streak of orange across the white uniform that
  marked the regiment of the Hussars. The winner of the prize for shooting, in
  the whole army, had hit the white of smaller targets than that.</p>

  <p>He unslung his carbine; and a shock of unnatural noise shook up all the
  wild fowl for miles upon the silent marshes. But Sergeant Schwartz did not
  trouble about them. What interested him was that, even at such a distance, he
  could see the straight, white figure turn crooked and alter in shape, as if
  the man had suddenly grown deformed. He was hanging like a humpback over the
  saddle; and Schwartz, with his exact eye and long experience, was certain
  that his victim was shot through the body; and almost certain that he was
  shot through the heart. Then he brought the horse down with a second shot;
  and the whole equestrian group heeled over and slipped and slid and vanished
  in one white flash into the dark fenland below.</p>

  <p>The hard-headed sergeant was certain that his work was done. Hard-headed
  men of his sort are generally very precise about what they are doing; that is
  why they are so often quite wrong about what they do. He had outraged the
  comradeship that is the soul of armies; he had killed a gallant officer who
  was in the performance of his duty; he had deceived and defied his sovereign
  and committed a common murder without excuse of personal quarrel; but he had
  obeyed his superior officer and he had helped to kill a Pole. These two last
  facts for the moment filled his mind; and he rode thoughtfully back again to
  make his report to Marshal Von Grock. He had no doubts about the thoroughness
  of the work he had done. The man carrying the reprieve was certainly dead;
  and even if by some miracle he were only dying, he could not conceivably have
  ridden his dead or dying horse to the town in time to prevent the execution.
  No; on the whole it was much more practical and prudent to get back under the
  wing of his protector, the author of the desperate project. With his whole
  strength he leaned on the strength of the great Marshal.</p>

  <p>And truly the great Marshal had this greatness about him; that after the
  monstrous thing he had done, or caused to be done, he disdained to show any
  fear of facing the facts on the spot or the compromising possibilities of
  keeping in touch with his tool. He and the sergeant, indeed, an hour or so
  later, actually rode along the ridge together, till they came to a particular
  place where the Marshal dismounted, but bade the other ride on. He wished the
  sergeant to go forward to the original goal of the riders, and see if all was
  quiet in the town after the execution, or whether there remained some danger
  from popular resentment.</p>

  <p>"Is it here, then, Marshal?" asked the sergeant in a low voice. "I fancied
  it was further on; but it's a fact the infernal road seemed to lengthen out
  like a nightmare."</p>

  <p>"It is here," answered Grock, and swung himself heavily from saddle and
  stirrup, and then went to the edge of the long parapet and looked down.</p>

  <p>The moon had risen over the marshes and gone up strengthening in splendour
  and gleaming on dark waters and green scum; and in the nearest clump of
  reeds, at the foot of the slope, there lay, as in a sort of luminous and
  radiant ruin, all that was left of one of those superb white horses and white
  horsemen of his old brigade. Nor was the identity doubtful; the moon made a
  sort of aureole of the curled golden hair of young Arnold, the second rider
  and the bearer of the reprieve; and the same mystical moonshine glittered not
  only on baldrick and buttons, but on the special medals of the young soldier
  and the stripes and signs of his degree. Under such a glamorous veil of
  light, he might almost have been in the white armour of Sir Galahad; and
  there could scarcely have been a more horrible contrast than that between
  such fallen grace and youth below and the rocky and grotesque figure looking
  down from above. Grock had taken off his helmet again; and though it is
  possible that this was the vague shadow of some funereal form of respect, its
  visible effect was that the queer naked head and neck like that of a
  pachyderm glittered stonily in the moon, like the hairless head and neck of
  some monster of the Age of Stone. Rops, or some such etcher of the black,
  fantastic German schools, might have drawn such a picture: of a huge beast as
  inhuman as a beetle looking down on the broken wings and white and golden
  armour of some defeated champion of the Cherubim.</p>

  <p>Grock said no prayer and uttered no pity; but in some dark way his mind
  was moved, as even the dark and mighty swamp will sometimes move like a
  living thing; and as such men will, when feeling for the first time faintly
  on their defence before they know not what, he tried to formulate his only
  faith and confront it with the stark universe and the staring moon.</p>

  <p>"After and before the deed the German Will is the same. It cannot be
  broken by changes and by time, like that of those others who repent. It
  stands outside time like a thing of stone, looking forward and backward with
  the same face."</p>

  <p>The silence that followed lasted long enough to please his cold vanity
  with a certain sense of portent; as if a stone figure had spoken in a valley
  of silence. But the silence began to thrill once more with a distant whisper
  which was the faint throb of horsehoofs; and a moment later the sergeant came
  galloping, or rather racing, back along the uplifted road, and his scarred
  and swarthy visage was no longer merely grim but ghastly in the moon.</p>

  <p>"Marshal," he said, saluting with a strange stiffness, "I have seen
  Petrowski the Pole!"</p>

  <p>"Haven't they buried him yet?" asked the Marshal, still staring down and
  in some abstraction.</p>

  <p>"If they have," said Schwartz, "he has rolled the stone away and risen
  from the dead."</p>

  <p>He stared in front of him at the moon and marshes; but, indeed, though he
  was far from being a visionary character, it was not these things that he
  saw, but rather the things he had just seen. He had, indeed, seen Paul
  Petrowski walking alive and alert down the brilliantly illuminated main
  avenue of that Polish town to the very beginning of the causeway; there was
  no mistaking the slim figure with plumes of hair and tuft of Frenchified
  beard which figured in so many private albums and illustrated magazines. And
  behind him he had seen that Polish town aflame with flags and firebrands and
  a population boiling with triumphant hero-worship, though perhaps less
  hostile to the government than it might have been, since it was rejoicing at
  the release of its popular hero.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," cried Grock with a sudden croaking stridency of voice,
  "that they have dared to release him in defiance of my message?"</p>

  <p>Schwartz saluted again and said:</p>

  <p>"They had already released him and they have received no message."</p>

  <p>"Do you ask me, after all this," said Grock, "to believe that no messenger
  came from our camp at all?"</p>

  <p>"No messenger at all," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>There was a much longer silence, and then Grock said, hoarsely: "What in
  the name of hell has happened? Can you think of anything to explain it
  all?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen something," said the sergeant, "which I think does explain it
  all."</p>

  <p>When Mr. Pond had told the story up to this point, he paused with an
  irritating blankness of expression.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Gahagan impatiently, "and do <i>you</i> know anything that
  would explain it all?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I do," said Mr. Pond meekly. "You see, I had to worry it
  out for myself, when the report came round to my department. It really did
  arise from an excess of Prussian obedience. It also arose from an excess of
  another Prussian weakness: contempt. And of all the passions that blind and
  madden and mislead men, the worst is the coldest: contempt.</p>

  <p>"Grock had talked much too comfortably before the cow, and much too
  confidently before the cabbage. He despised stupid men even on his own staff;
  and treated Von Hocheimer, the first messenger, as a piece of furniture
  merely because he looked like a fool; but the Lieutenant was not such a fool
  as he looked. He also understood what the great Marshal meant, quite as well
  as the cynical sergeant, who had done such dirty work all his life. Hocheimer
  also understood the Marshal's peculiar moral philosophy: that an act is
  unanswerable even when it is indefensible. He knew that what his commander
  wanted was simply the corpse of Petrowski; that he wanted it anyhow, at the
  expense of any deception of princes or destruction of soldiers. And when he
  heard a swifter horseman behind him, riding to overtake him, he knew as well
  as Grock himself that the new messenger must be carrying with him the message
  of the mercy of the Prince. Von Schacht, that very young but gallant officer,
  looking like the very embodiment of all that more generous tradition of
  Germany that has been too much neglected in this tale, was worthy of the
  accident that made him the herald of a more generous policy. He came with the
  speed of that noble horsemanship that has left behind it in Europe the very
  name of chivalry, calling out to the other in a tone like a herald's trumpet
  to stop and stand and turn. And Von Hocheimer obeyed. He stopped, he reined
  in his horse, he turned in his saddle; but his hand held the carbine levelled
  like a pistol, and he shot the boy between the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then he turned again and rode on, carrying the death-warrant of the Pole.
  Behind him horse and man had crashed over the edge of the embankment, so that
  the whole road was clear. And along that clear and open road toiled in his
  turn the third messenger, marvelling at the interminable length of his
  journey; till he saw at last the unmistakable uniform of a Hussar like a
  white star disappearing in the distance, and he shot also. Only he did not
  kill the second messenger, but the first.</p>

  <p>"That was why no messenger came alive to the Polish town that night. That
  was why the prisoner walked out of his prison alive. Do you think I was quite
  wrong in saying that Von Grock had two faithful servants, and one too
  many?"</p>

  <h2><a name="c02"
     id="c02">II. &mdash; THE CRIME OF CAPTAIN GAHAGAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It must be confessed that some people thought Mr. Pond a
bore. He had a
  weakness for long speeches, not out of self-importance, but because he had an
  old-fashioned taste in literature; and had unconsciously inherited the habit
  of Gibbon or Butler or Burke. Even his paradoxes were not what are called
  brilliant paradoxes. The word brilliant has long been the most formidable
  weapon of criticism; but Mr. Pond could not be blasted and withered with a
  charge of brilliancy. Thus, in the case now to be considered, when Mr. Pond
  said (referring, I grieve to say, to the greater part of the female sex, at
  least in its most modern phase): "They go so fast that they get no farther,"
  he did not mean it as an epigram. And somehow it did not sound epigrammatic;
  but only odd and obscure. And the ladies to whom he said it, notably the Hon.
  Violet Varney, could see no sense in it. They thought Mr. Pond, when he was
  not boring, was only bewildering.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, Mr. Pond did sometimes indulge in long speeches. Triumph therefore
  and great glory belongs to anyone who could successfully stop Mr. Pond from
  making long speeches; and this laurel is for the brows of Miss Artemis
  Asa-Smith, of Pentapolis, Pa. She came to interview Mr. Pond for <i>The Live
  Wire,</i> touching his alleged views on the Haggis Mystery; and she did not
  let him get a word in edgeways.</p>

  <p>"I believe," began Mr. Pond, rather nervously, "that your paper is
  inquiring about what some call Private Execution, and I call murder,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forget it," said the young lady briefly. "It's just too wonderful for me
  to be sitting here next to all secrets of your government; why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She continued her monologue; though in a style of dots and dashes. As she
  would not let Mr. Pond interrupt her, she seemed to think it only fair to
  interrupt herself. Somehow it seemed at once as if her speech would never
  end; and not one sentence of it was ever ended.</p>

  <p>We have all heard of American interviewers who rip up family secrets,
  break down bedroom doors and collect information in the manner of burglars.
  There are some; but there are also others. There are, or were, when the
  writer remembers them, a very large number of intelligent men ready to
  discuss intelligent things; and there was Miss Asa-Smith. She was small and
  dark; she was rather pretty and would have been very pretty if she had not
  dipped her lipstick in hues of earthquake and eclipse. Her finger-nails were
  painted five different colours, looking like the paints in a child's
  paintbox; and she was as innocent as a child. She was also as garrulous as a
  child. She felt something paternal about Mr. Pond and told him everything. He
  did not have to tell her anything. No buried tragedies of the Pond family
  were dug up; no secrets of the crimes committed behind Mr. Pond's bedroom
  door. Conversation, so to describe it, revolved largely round her early days
  in Pennsylvania; her first ambitions and ideals; which two things, like many
  of her local traditions, she seemed to imagine to be the same. She was a
  Feminist and had stood up with Ada P. Tuke against clubs and saloons and the
  selfishness of man. She had written a play; and she just longed to read it to
  Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>"About that question of Private Execution," said Mr. Pond politely, "I
  suppose we've all been tempted in desperate moments&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm just desperate to read you this play, and&mdash;you know how it
  is. You see, my play's awfully <i>modern.</i> But even the modernest people
  haven't done just that&mdash;I mean, beginning in the water and
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Beginning in the water?" inquired Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it just too&mdash;oh, you know. I suppose they will have all
  characters in bathing dresses soon&mdash;but they'll only just enter L. or
  R.; come on at the side, you know&mdash;and all the old stuff. My characters
  enter from above, diving, with a splash&mdash;Well, that'll be a splash,
  won't it? I mean to say, it begins like that." She began to read very
  rapidly:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><i>"Scene,</i> sea outside the Lido.</p>

  <p>"Voice of Tom Toxin (<i>from above</i>): 'See me make a splash, if&mdash;'
  (<i>Toxin dives from above to stage in pea-green bathing-suit</i>).</p>

  <p>"Voice of Duchess (<i>from above</i>): 'Only sort of splash you'll ever
  make, you&mdash;' (<i>Duchess dives from above in scarlet
  bathing-suit</i>).</p>

  <p>"Toxin (<i>coming up spluttering</i>): 'Splutter as splutter . . . splosh
  is the only splash by your&mdash;.'</p>

  <p>"Duchess: 'Oh, Grandpa!'"</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>"She calls him Grandpa, you see, because 'splosh' means money in that
  ever-so-old comic song&mdash;they're quite young really, of course, and
  rather . . . you know. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond interposed with delicacy and firmness: "I wonder whether you
  would be so very kind, Miss Asa-Smith, as to leave the manuscript with me or
  send me a copy, so that I can enjoy it at leisure. It reads rather quickly
  for old buffers like me; and nobody ever seems to finish a sentence. But do
  you think you can persuade our leading actors and actresses to dive from
  great heights into a stage sea?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dare say some of the old-stagers would be stuffy about it," she
  replied, "because&mdash;can't fancy your great tragedienne, Olivia
  Feversham&mdash;though she's not so old really and just lovely still,
  only&mdash;but so Shakespearian! But I've got the Honourable Violet Varney to
  <i>promise,</i> and her sister's quite a friend of mine, though of course not
  so&mdash;and lots of amateurs would do it for fun. That Gahagan guy is a good
  swimmer, and he's acted, too, and&mdash;oh, well, he'd click if Joan Varney's
  in it."</p>

  <p>The face of Mr. Pond, hitherto patient and stoical, became quite silently
  alert and alive. He said with a new gravity:</p>

  <p>"Captain Gahagan is a great friend of mine, and he has introduced me to
  Miss Varney. As to her sister, the one on the stage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a patch on Joan, is she? But&mdash;" said Miss Asa-Smith.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond had formed an impression. He liked Miss Asa-Smith. He liked her
  very much. And the thought of the Honourable Violet Varney, that English
  aristocrat, made him like the American even more. The Honourable Violet was
  one of those wealthy women who pay to act badly; and blackleg the poorer
  people who might have been paid to act well. She certainly was quite capable
  of diving in a bathing dress, or in anything or nothing, if it were the only
  way to the stage and the spot-light. She was quite capable of helping Miss
  Asa-Smith in her absurd play and talking similar nonsense about being modern
  and independent of selfish man. But there was a difference; and it was not to
  the advantage of the Honourable Violet. Poor Artemis followed idiotic
  fashions because she was a hard-working journalist who had to earn her
  living; and Violet Varney only took away other people's living. They both
  spoke in the style that was a string of unfinished sentences. It was the one
  language Mr. Pond thought that might truly be called broken English. But
  Violet dropped the tail of a sentence as if she were too tired to finish it;
  Artemis did so as if she were really too eager to get on to the next. There
  was within her, somehow, a thing, a spirit of life, which survives every
  criticism of America.</p>

  <p>"Joan Varney's much nicer," continued Artemis, "and you bet your friend
  Gahagan thinks so. Do you think they'll really hitch up? He's a queer fellow,
  you know."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond did not deny it. Captain Gahagan, that swaggering and restless
  and sometimes sullen man-about-town, was queer in many ways; and in none more
  than in his almost incongruous affection for the precise and prosaic Mr.
  Pond.</p>

  <p>"Some say he's a rotter," said the candid American. "I don't say that; but
  I do say he's a dark horse. And he does shilly-shally about Joan Varney,
  doesn't he? Some say he's really in love with the great Olivia&mdash;your
  only tragic actress. Only she's so jolly tragic."</p>

  <p>"God send she doesn't play in a real tragedy," said Pond.</p>

  <p>He knew what he meant; but he had not the faintest foreshadowing of the
  awful tragedy of real life and death in which Olivia Feversham was to play
  within the next twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>He was only thinking of his Irish friend as he knew him; and he was near
  enough to know all that he did not know. Peter Patrick Gahagan lived the
  modern life, perhaps to excess, was a prop of nightclubs and a driver of
  sports cars, still comparatively young; but, for all that, he was a survival.
  He belonged to the times of a more Byronic pose. When Mr. W. B. Yeats wrote:
  "Romantic Ireland's dead and gone; it's with O'Leary in the grave," he had
  never met Gahagan, who was not yet in the grave. He was of that older
  tradition by a hundred tests; he had been a cavalry soldier and also a member
  of Parliament; the last to follow the old Irish orators with their rounded
  periods. Like all these, for some reason, he adored Shakespeare. Isaac Butt
  filled speeches with Shakespeare; Tim Healy could quote the poet so that his
  poetry seemed part of the living talk at table; Russell of Killowen read no
  other book. But he, like they, was Shakespearian in an eighteenth-century
  way: the way of Garrick; and that eighteenth century that he recalled had a
  pretty pagan side to it. Pond could not dismiss the chances of Gahagan having
  an affair with Olivia or anyone else; and if so a storm might be brewing. For
  Olivia was married; and to no complaisant husband, either.</p>

  <p>Frederick Feversham was something worse than an unsuccessful actor; he was
  one who had been successful. He was now forgotten in the theatre and
  remembered only in the law-courts. A dark and crabbed man, still haggardly
  handsome, he had become famous, or familiar, as a sort of permanent litigant.
  He was eternally bringing actions against people whom he charged with trivial
  tricks and distant and disputable wrongs: managers and rivals and the rest.
  He had as yet no special quarrel with his wife, younger than himself and
  still popular in the profession. But he was much less intimate with his wife
  than with his solicitor.</p>

  <p>Through court after court Feversham passed, pursuing his rights and
  followed like a shadow by his solicitor, Luke, of the firm of Masters, Luke
  and Masters; a young man with flat, yellow hair and a rather wooden face.
  What he thought of his client's feuds and how far he ventured to restrain
  them, that wooden face would never reveal. But he worked well for his client;
  and the two had necessarily become in a way companions-in-arms. Of one thing
  Pond was certain. Neither Feversham nor Luke was likely to spare Gahagan, if
  that erratic gentleman put himself in the wrong. But this part of the problem
  was destined to find a worse solution than he dreamed of. Twenty-four hours
  after Pond's talk with the interviewer, he learned that Frederick Feversham
  was dead.</p>

  <p>Like other litigious persons, Mr. Feversham had left a legal problem
  behind him, to feed many lawyers with fees. But it was not the problem of an
  ill-drawn will or a dubious signature. It was the problem of a stiff and
  staring corpse, lying just inside a garden-gate and nailed there by a
  fencing-sword with the button broken off. Frederick Feversham, that legalist,
  had suffered at least one final and indisputable illegality; he had been
  stabbed to death as he entered his own home.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Long before certain facts, slowly collected, were put before
  the police, they were put before Mr. Pond. This may seem odd, but there were
  reasons; indeed Mr. Pond, like many other Government officials, had rather
  secret and unsuspected spheres of influence; his public powers were very
  private. Younger and more conspicuous men had even been known to stand in a
  certain awe of him, owing to special circumstances. But to explain all that
  is to explore the labyrinth of the most unconstitutional of all
  constitutions. In any case, his first warning of the trouble took the
  commonplace form of an ordinary legal letter, with the heading of the
  well-known firm of Masters, Luke and Masters, expressing the hope that Mr.
  Luke might be allowed to discuss certain information with Mr. Pond, before it
  was necessary for it to reach the police authorities or the Press. Mr. Pond
  replied equally formally that he would be delighted to receive Mr. Luke at a
  certain hour upon the following day. Then he sat and stared into vacancy,
  with that rather goggling expression which led some of his friends to compare
  him to a fish.</p>

  <p>He had already thought of about two-thirds of what the solicitor was going
  to tell him.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, Mr. Pond," said the solicitor, in a confidential but still
  careful voice, when he was at length deposited on the other side of Mr.
  Pond's table next day. "The truth is that the possibilities of this affair,
  painful in any case, may be specially painful for you. Most of us find it
  impossible to imagine that a personal friend might come under suspicion in
  such matters."</p>

  <p>The mild eyes of Mr. Pond opened very wide, and even his mouth made the
  momentary movement which some thought so very fishy. The lawyer probably
  assumed that he was shocked at the first suggestion of his friend being
  affected; in fact, he was mildly amazed to suppose that anybody had not
  entertained the idea long ago. He knew that words to that effect were common
  in the more conventional detective stories, which he heartily enjoyed, as a
  change from Burke and Gibbon. He could see the printed words on a hundred
  pages: "None of us could believe that this handsome young cricketer had
  committed a crime," or: "It seemed absurd to connect murder with a man like
  Captain Pickleboy, the most popular figure in Society." He had always
  wondered what the words meant. To his simple and sceptical eighteenth-century
  mind, they seemed to mean nothing at all. Why should not pleasant and
  fashionable men commit murders, like anybody else? He was very much upset
  himself, inside, about this particular case; but he still did not understand
  that way of talking.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say," continued the lawyer in a low voice, "that private
  investigation which we have already made, on our own account, places your
  friend, Captain Gahagan, in a position requiring explanation."</p>

  <p>"Yes," thought Pond, "and, my God, Gahagan really does require
  explanation! That's exactly the difficulty about him&mdash;but, Lord, how
  slow this fellow is!" In short, the real trouble was that Pond was very fond
  of Captain Gahagan; but in so far as one could ask whether men were capable
  of murder, he was rather inclined to think that Gahagan <i>was</i> capable of
  murder&mdash;more capable of murder than of meanness to a cabman.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, with extraordinary vividness, the image of Gahagan himself
  sprang up in Pond's memory: Gahagan as he had last seen him lounging with his
  large shoulders and long stride, and strange dark-red hair under the rather
  rakishly tilted grey top-hat, and behind him a space of sunset where the
  evening clouds passed in a sort of crumbling purple pomp, rather like the
  pomp of poor Gahagan himself. No; the Irishman was a man seventy-and-seven
  times to be forgiven; but not a man to be lightly acquitted.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luke," said Pond suddenly, "will it save time if I tell you, to start
  with, what I know there is against Gahagan? He was hanging round Mrs.
  Feversham, the great actress; I don't know why he was; my own belief is that
  he is really in love with another woman. Yet he did unquestionably give the
  actress a huge amount of his time: hours and hours and late hours too. But if
  Feversham caught him doing anything unconventional, Feversham was not the man
  to let him off without a lawsuit and a scandal and God knows what. I don't
  want to criticize your client; but, speaking crudely, he almost lived on
  lawsuits and scandals all his life. And if Feversham was the man to threaten
  or blackmail, I give it you frankly that Gahagan was the man to hit him back
  in a bodily fashion; and perhaps kill him, especially if a lady's name were
  involved. That is the case against Captain Gahagan; and I tell you at the
  start that I don't believe in it."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately it is not the whole case against Captain Gahagan," replied
  Luke smoothly, "and I fear the full statement may make even you believe it.
  Perhaps the most serious result of our investigations is this. It is now
  quite clearly established that Captain Gahagan gave three quite contrary and
  inconsistent accounts of his movements, or proposed movements, on the evening
  of the murder. Allowing him the highest possible marks for truthfulness in
  the matter, he must at least have told two lies to one truth."</p>

  <p>"I have always found Gahagan truthful enough," replied Pond, "except when
  he was telling lies for amusement; which is really rather the mark of a man
  who doesn't prostitute the sublime art of lying to the base uses of
  necessity. About all ordinary practical things, I have found him not only
  frank but also rather precise."</p>

  <p>"Even accepting what you say," answered Mr. Luke dubiously, "we should
  still have to answer: If he was commonly candid and truthful, it must have
  been a mortal and desperate occasion that made him lie."</p>

  <p>"To whom did he tell these lies?" asked Pond.</p>

  <p>"That is where the whole matter is so painful and delicate," said the
  lawyer, shaking his head. "That afternoon, it seems, Gahagan had been talking
  to several ladies."</p>

  <p>"He generally has," said Pond. "Or was it they who were talking to him? If
  one of them happened, for instance, to be that very charming lady, Miss
  Asa-Smith of Pentapolis, I would venture to guess that it was she who was
  talking to him."</p>

  <p>"This is rather extraordinary," said Luke in some surprise. "I do not know
  if it was a guess; but one of them certainly was a Miss Asa-Smith of
  Pentapolis. The other two were the Hon. Violet Varney and, last but not
  least, the Hon. Joan Varney. As a matter of fact, it was the last that he
  spoke to first; which, I suppose, was only natural. It is notable, on your
  own suggestion, that he is really attached to this last lady, that his
  statement to her was apparently much the nearest to the truth."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Pond, and pulled his beard thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Joan Varney," observed the lawyer gravely, "stated most definitely,
  before she knew that there was any trouble or tragedy in this case, that
  Captain Gahagan had left the house saying: 'I am going round to the
  Fevershams'.'"</p>

  <p>"And you say that is contradicted by his statement to the others," said
  Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>"Most emphatically," replied Luke. "The other sister, well known on the
  stage as Violet Varney, stopped him as he was going out and they exchanged a
  little light conversation. But, as he left, he distinctly said to her: 'I'm
  not going to the Fevershams'; they're still at Brighton,' or something like
  that."</p>

  <p>"And now we come," said Mr. Pond, smiling, "to my young friend from
  Pentapolis. What was she doing there, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"He found her on the doorstep when he opened the front door," replied Mr.
  Luke, also smiling. "She had arrived in a rush of enthusiasm to interview
  Violet Varney as 'Comedienne and Social Leader.' Neither she nor Gahagan are
  the sort of people not to be noticed; or to fail to notice each other. So
  Gahagan had a little talk with her, too; at the end of which he departed,
  with a flourish of his grey top-hat, telling her that he was going
  immediately to the club."</p>

  <p>"Are you certain of that?" asked Pond, frowning.</p>

  <p>"She was certain of it; because she was in a red-hot rage about it,"
  replied Luke. "It seems that she has some feminist fad on the subject. She
  thinks all male persons who go to clubs go there to tell slanderous anecdotes
  about women and then drink themselves under the table. She may have had a
  little professional feeling about it too; perhaps she would have liked to
  have a longer interview, either for herself or <i>The Live Wire.</i> But I'll
  swear she's quite honest."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Pond emphatically but rather gloomily, "she's
  absolutely honest."</p>

  <p>"Well, there it is," said Luke, speaking also not without a decent gloom.
  "It seems to me that the psychology's only too obvious under the
  circumstances. He blurted out where he was really going to the girl he was
  accustomed to confide in; perhaps he didn't really plan the crime till later;
  or perhaps it wasn't entirely planned or premeditated. But by the time he
  talked to less friendly people he saw how unwise it would be to say he was
  going to the Fevershams'. His first impulse is to say, hastily and too
  crudely, that he was <i>not</i> going to the Fevershams'. Then, by the third
  interview, he thinks of a really good lie, normal and sufficiently vague, and
  says he is going to the club."</p>

  <p>"It might be like that," replied Pond, "or it might&mdash;" And Mr. Pond
  fell for the first time into the lax habit of Miss Asa-Smith, and failed to
  finish his sentence. Instead he sat staring at the distance with his rather
  goggle-eyed and fish-like gaze; then he put his head on his hands, said
  apologetically: "Please pardon me if I think for a minute," and buried his
  bald brows once more.</p>

  <p>The bearded fish came to the surface again with a somewhat new expression,
  and said with a brisk and almost sharp tone:</p>

  <p>"You seem very much bent on bringing the crime home to poor Gahagan."</p>

  <p>For the first time Luke's features stiffened to hardness, or even
  harshness. "We naturally wish to bring the murderer of our client to
  justice."</p>

  <p>Pond bent forward and his eyes were penetrating as he repeated: "But you
  will have it that the murderer was Gahagan."</p>

  <p>"I've given you the evidence," said Luke, lowering; "you know the
  witnesses."</p>

  <p>"And yet, oddly enough," said Pond very slowly, "you haven't mentioned the
  really damning thing against him in the report of those witnesses."</p>

  <p>"It's damning enough&mdash;what do you mean?" snapped the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I mean the fact that they are <i>unwilling</i> witnesses," replied Pond.
  "It couldn't be a conspiracy. My little Yank is as honest as the day and
  would never join a conspiracy. He's the sort of man women like. Even Violet
  Varney likes him. Joan Varney loves him. And yet they all give evidence to
  contradict him or, at least, show he contradicted himself. And yet they're
  all wrong."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean," cried Luke with sudden impatience, "by
  saying they're all wrong?"</p>

  <p>"They're all wrong about what he said," answered Pond. "Did you ask them
  if he said anything else?"</p>

  <p>"What else is needed?" cried the lawyer, now really angry. "They could all
  swear he said what I say. Going to the Fevershams'; not going to the
  Fevershams'; going to some unnamed club&mdash;and then bolting down the
  street so as to leave a lady in a rage."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Pond. "You say he said three different things. I say he
  said the same thing to all three. He turned it the other way round and made
  it the same."</p>

  <p>"He turned it the other way round all right," retorted Luke almost
  viciously. "But if he goes into the witness-box, he'll find out whether the
  law of perjury says that turning a thing round makes it the same."</p>

  <p>There was a pause and then Mr. Pond said serenely:</p>

  <p>"So now we know all about the Crime of Captain Gahagan."</p>

  <p>"Who says we know all about anything? I don't. Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Pond. "The Crime of Captain Gahagan was that he didn't
  understand women; especially modern women. These men with a vague air of
  being lady-killers seldom do. Don't you know that dear old Gahagan is really
  your great-great-grandfather?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Luke made a movement as of sudden and sincere alarm; he was not the
  first man to fancy for a moment that Mr. Pond was mad.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see," went on Pond, "that he belongs to the school of the old
  bucks and beaux who called her 'Woman, Lovely Woman,' and knew nothing
  whatever about her&mdash;to the considerable increase of her power? But how
  they could pay compliments! 'Stand close about, you Stygian set. . . .' But
  perhaps, as you seem to suggest, it is not quite relevant. But you see what I
  mean by Gahagan being the old sort of lady-killer?"</p>

  <p>"I know he's a very old sort of gentleman-killer," cried Luke quite
  violently, "and that he killed the worthy and greatly wronged gentleman who
  was my client and friend!"</p>

  <p>"You seem a little annoyed," said Mr. Pond. "Have you tried reading Dr.
  Johnson's <i>Vanity of Human Wishes?</i> Very soothing. Believe me, those
  eighteenth-century writers I wanted to quote are very soothing. Have you read
  Addison's play about Cato?"</p>

  <p>"You appear to be mad," said the lawyer, now positively pale.</p>

  <p>"Or again," continued Mr. Pond in a chatty way, "have you read Miss
  Asa-Smith's play about the duchess in the bathing-suit? All the sentences
  curiously cut short&mdash;like the bathing-suit."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean anything whatever?" asked the lawyer in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I mean a great deal," replied Pond. "But it takes quite a long
  time to explain&mdash;like the Vanity of Human Wishes. What I mean is this.
  My friend Gahagan is very fond of those old wits and orators, just as I am;
  speeches where you have to wait for the peroration; epigrams with the sting
  in the tail. That's how we first became friends, by both being fond of the
  eighteenth-century style; balance and antithesis and all that. Now if you
  have this habit and read, say, the hackneyed lines in <i>Cato</i>: ''Tis not
  in mortals to command success; but we'll do more, Sempronius, we'll deserve
  it'&mdash;well, it may be good or bad; but you've got to wait for the end of
  the sentence; because it begins with a platitude and ends with a point. But
  the modern sort of sentence never ends; and nobody waits for it to end.</p>

  <p>"Now women were always a little like that. It isn't that they don't think,
  they think quicker than we do. They often talk better. But they don't
  <i>listen</i> so well. They leap so quickly upon the first point; they see so
  much more in it; and go off in a gallop of inference about it&mdash;so that
  they sometimes don't notice the rest of the speech at all. But Gahagan, being
  of the other sort, the old oratorical sort, would always end his sentence
  properly, and be as careful to say what he meant at the end as the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>"I suggest to you, as the barristers say, that what Captain Gahagan really
  said to Joan in the first case was this: 'I'm going round to the Fevershams';
  I don't believe they are back from Brighton yet, but I'll just look in and
  see. If they're not. I'll go on to the club.' That is what Peter Gahagan
  said; but that is not what Joan Varney heard. She heard about going to the
  Fevershams' and felt at once that she knew all about it&mdash;far too much
  about it&mdash;to the not unnatural tune of 'He's going to see that woman';
  even though his next words were that the woman almost certainly wasn't there.
  Stuff about Brighton and the club didn't interest her, and she didn't even
  remember it. Very well, let us go on to the next case. What Gahagan said to
  Violet Varney was this: 'It's no good going to the Fevershams' really;
  they're not back from Brighton; but perhaps I'll look in and see; if they're
  not back, I shall go on to the club.' Violet is much less truthful and
  careful than Joan; and she was jealous of Olivia herself, but in a much
  shallower way, Violet supposing herself to be an actress. She also heard the
  word Feversham and remembered vaguely that he said it was no good going
  there; that is, that he was not going there. She was pleased at this and
  condescended to chat with him; but did not condescend to pay any attention
  whatever to anything else he said.</p>

  <p>"Now for the third case. What Gahagan said to Miss Artemis Asa-Smith on
  the doorstep was this: 'I'm going to the club; I promised to look in on some
  friends of mine on the way, the Fevershams; but I don't believe they're back
  from Brighton.' That's what he said. What Artemis heard, saw and blasted with
  her blazing eye, was a typical insolent, selfish, self-indulgent male
  brazenly bragging in the open street of his intention to go to his infamous
  club, where women are slandered and men drugged with alcohol. After the shock
  of this shameless avowal, of course she could not stoop to pick up the pieces
  of any other silly things he had said. He was simply the man who went to the
  club.</p>

  <p>"Now all those three real statements of Gahagan are exactly the same. They
  all mean the same thing; map out the same course of action; give the same
  reasons for the same acts. But they sound totally different according to
  which sentence comes first; especially to these rather jumpy modern girls,
  accustomed only to jump at the sentence that comes first&mdash;very often
  because there isn't any thing at all to come after it. The Asa-Smith school
  of drama, in which every sentence stops as soon as it starts, if it doesn't
  strike you as having much to do with the Tragedy of Cato, has had a very
  great deal to do with the Tragedy of Captain Gahagan. They might have hanged
  my friend between them, with the best intentions in the world, simply and
  solely because they will think only in half-sentences. Broken necks, broken
  hearts, broken lives, and all because they won't learn any language but
  broken English. Don't you think there's something to be said for that musty
  old taste of his and mine, for the sort of literature that makes you read all
  that a man writes and listen to all that he says? Wouldn't you rather have an
  important statement made to you in the language of Addison or Johnson than in
  the splutterings of Mr. Toxin and the Diving Duchess?"</p>

  <p>During this monologue, certainly rather long, the lawyer had grown more
  and more restless and full of nervous irritation.</p>

  <p>"This is all fancywork," he said almost feverishly. "You haven't proved
  any of this."</p>

  <p>"No," said Pond gravely, "as you say, I fancied it. At least I guessed it.
  But I did ring up Gahagan and hear something of the truth of his words and
  movements that afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Truth!" cried Luke, with very extraordinary bitterness.</p>

  <p>Pond looked at him curiously. That woodenness of visage which was the
  first impression produced by Mr. Luke was found on examination to consist
  mostly of a rather forced look of fixity, combined with the rigid smoothness
  of his head and hair, the latter looking as if it had been painted on with
  some rather sticky yellow paint: a gummy gamboge. His eyelids indeed were
  cold and often partially closed; but inside them the grey-green eyes seemed
  strangely small, as if they were distant; and they were dancing and darting
  about like microscopic green flies. The more Mr. Pond looked at those veiled
  but restless eyes, the less he liked them. The old fancy came back to him
  about an actual conspiracy against Gahagan; though certainly not one worked
  by Artemis or Joan. At last he broke the silence very abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luke," he said, "you are naturally concerned for your late client;
  but some might feel you had a more than professional interest. Since you
  study his interests so deeply, can you give me a piece of information about
  him? <i>Did</i> Mr. Feversham and his wife come back from Brighton that day?
  Was Mrs. Feversham at the house that afternoon, whether Gahagan went there,
  or not?"</p>

  <p>"She was not," said Luke shortly. "They were both expected to return next
  morning. I have no idea why Feversham himself did return that night."</p>

  <p>"Looks almost as if somebody had sent for him," said Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>Mr. Luke the solicitor rose abruptly from his seat and turned away. "I
  cannot see any use in all these speculations of yours," he said, and, making
  a stiff salute, he took his top-hat and was gone from the house with a
  swiftness that seemed hardly normal.</p>

  <p>Next day Mr. Pond clad himself even more conventionally and carefully than
  usual, and proceeded to pay a round of calls on a series of ladies: a
  frivolous solemnity which with him was by no means usual. The first lady he
  waited upon was the Hon. Violet Varney, whom he had hitherto only seen in the
  distance, and was gently depressed at having to see so close. She was what he
  believed, in these latter days, to be described as a platinum blonde. It was
  doubtless a graceful reminiscence of her own name which led her to tint her
  mouth and cheeks with a colour that was rather violet than purple, giving an
  effect which her friends called ghostly and her foes ghastly. Even from this
  listless lady he did extract some admissions lending to help in the
  reconstruction of Gahagan's real remarks; though the lady's own remarks had
  their usual air of expiring with a gasp before they were really finished.
  Then he had another interview with her sister, Joan, and marvelled inwardly
  at the strange thing which is human personality and stands apart from modes
  and manners. For Joan had very much the same tricks of style; the same rather
  high, well-bred voice, the same sketchy, uncompleted sentences; but,
  fortunately, not the same purple powder and not in the least the same eyes or
  gestures or mind or immortal soul. Mr. Pond, with all his old-fashioned
  prejudices, knew at once that in this other girl the new virtues were
  virtues, whether or not they were new. She really was brave and generous and
  fond of the truth, though the Society papers did say so. "She's all right,"
  said Mr. Pond to himself. "She's as good as gold. A great deal better than
  gold. And oh, how much better than platinum!"</p>

  <p>Stopping at the next stage of his pilgrimage, he visited the monstrous and
  ludicrous large hotel which had the honour of housing Miss Artemis Asa-Smith
  of Pennsylvania. She received him with the rather overwhelming enthusiasm
  which bore her everywhere through the world; and Mr. Pond had very little
  difficulty in her case in extracting an admission that even a man who goes to
  a club may happen not to be a murderer. Though this explanation was naturally
  less personal and intimate than his interview with Joan (about which he
  always refused to say a word to anybody), the ardent Artemis continued to
  earn his approval by her reserves of good sense and good nature. She saw the
  point about the order of the topics mentioned, and its probable effect on her
  own mind; and so far the diplomacy of Mr. Pond had been successful. All the
  three ladies, with whatever degrees of seriousness or concentration, had
  listened to his theory of what Gahagan had said; and had all agreed that he
  might very probably have said it. This part of his task being done, Mr. Pond
  paused a little, and perhaps rather pulled himself together, before
  approaching his last duty&mdash;which also took the form of calling on a
  lady. He might be excused; for it also involved passing through that grim
  garden where a man had lain murdered, to that high and sinister house where
  his widow was still living alone: the great Olivia, queen of tragedy, now
  tragic by a double claim.</p>

  <p>He stepped, not without repugnance, across that dark corner inside the
  gate and under the holly tree where poor Fred Feversham had been spiked to
  the earth by a mere splinter of a sword; and as he climbed the crooked path
  to the doorway in the narrow and bare brick house that stood above him like a
  tower, dark against the stars, he revolved difficulties much deeper than had
  yet troubled him in the more trifling matter of the supposed inconsistencies
  of Gahagan's conversation. There was a real question behind all that
  nonsense; and it demanded an answer. Somebody had murdered the unfortunate
  Frederick Feversham; and there were some real reasons for directing the
  suspicion upon Gahagan. After all, he had been in the habit of spending whole
  days, or half of the nights as well, with this actress; nothing seemed more
  horribly natural, more repulsively probable, than that they had been
  surprised by Feversham and had taken the bloody way out. Mrs. Feversham had
  often been compared to Mrs. Siddons. Her own external behaviour had always
  been full of dignity and discretion. A scandal for her was not an
  advertisement, as it would be for Violet Varney. She had really the stronger
  motive of the two . . . but, good God, this would never do! Suppose Gahagan
  really was innocent&mdash;but at that price! Whatever his weaknesses, he was
  just the man to be hanged like a gentleman rather than let The Lady&mdash;He
  looked up with growing terror at the tower of dark brick, wondering if he
  were to meet the murderess. . . . Then he furiously flung off the morbidity,
  and tried again to fix himself on the facts. After all, what was there
  against Gahagan or the widow? It seemed to him, as he forced himself to
  colder considerations, that it really resolved itself into a matter of
  time.</p>

  <p>Gahagan had certainly spent a huge amount of <i>time</i> with Olivia; that
  was really the only external proof of his passion for her. The proofs of his
  passion for Joan were very external indeed. Pond could have sworn that the
  Irishman was really in love with Joan. He threw himself at her head; and she,
  on the accepted standards of modern youth, threw herself back at him. But
  these encounters, one might say collisions, were as brief as they were
  brilliant. Why did a lover full of such triumphs want to go off and spend
  such a lot of <i>time</i> with a much older woman? . . . These broodings had
  turned him into an automaton and brought him unconsciously past the servants
  and up the stairs and into the very room where he was asked to wait for Mrs.
  Feversham. He nervously picked up an old battered book, apparently dating
  from the time when the actress was a schoolgirl, for the flyleaf showed in a
  very schoolgirl hand: "Olivia Malone." Perhaps the great Shakespearian
  actress claimed descent from the great Shakespearian critic. But, anyhow, she
  must be Irish&mdash;at least by tradition. . . .</p>

  <p>As he bent over the shabby book in the dusky anteroom, there shot into his
  mind a white ray of serene and complete understanding: so far as this tale
  goes, the last of the paradoxes of Mr. Pond. He felt full and complete
  certainty; and yet the only words to express it wrote themselves rapidly
  across his brain with the bewildering brevity of a hieroglyphic.</p>

  <p>"Love never needs time. But Friendship always needs time. More and more
  and more time, up to long past midnight."</p>

  <p>When Gahagan had done those crazy things that blazoned his devotion to
  Joan Varney, they had hardly occupied any time. When he fell on her from a
  parachute as she came out of church at Bournemouth, the fall was naturally
  very rapid. When he tore up a return ticket costing hundreds of pounds to
  stay with her half an hour longer in Samoa, it was only half an hour longer.
  When he swam the Hellespont in imitation of Leander, it was only for exactly
  thirty-five minutes' conversation with Hero. But Love is like that. It is a
  thing of great moments; and it lives on the memory of moments. Perhaps it is
  a fragile illusion; perhaps, on the other hand, it is eternal and beyond
  time. But Friendship eats up time. If poor Gahagan had a real intellectual
  friendship, then he would go on talking till long past midnight. And with
  whom would Gahagan be so likely to have one as with an Irish actress who was
  chiefly interested in Shakespeare? Even as he had the thought, he heard the
  rich and faintly Irish voice of Olivia welcoming him; and he knew he was
  right.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know," asked the widow with a mournful smile, when he had
  tactfully steered the conversation past condolences to Captain Gahagan,
  "don't you know we poor Irishes have a secret vice? It's called Poetry; or
  perhaps I ought to say it's generally called Recitation. It's been suppressed
  by the police in all the English salons; and that's the worst of the Irish
  wrongs. People in London are not allowed to recite poems to each other all
  night, as they do in Dublin. Poor Peter used to come to me and talk
  Shakespeare till morning; but I had to turn him out at last. When a man calls
  on <i>me,</i> and tries to recite the whole of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> it
  gets past a joke. But you see how it was. The English won't allow the poor
  fellow to recite Shakespeare."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond did indeed see how it was. He knew enough about men to know that
  a man must have a friend, if possible a female friend, to talk to till all is
  blue. He knew enough about Dubliners to know that neither devils nor dynamite
  will stop them from reciting verse. All the black clouds of morbid brooding
  on the murder which had oppressed him in the garden had rolled away at the
  first sound of this strong, good-humoured Irishwoman's voice. But after a
  little while they began to gather again, though more remotely. After all, as
  he had said before, <i>somebody</i> had killed poor Fred Feversham.</p>

  <p>He was quite certain now that it was not Feversham's wife. He was
  practically certain it was not Gahagan. He went home that night turning the
  question over and over; but he had only one night's unrest. For the next
  day's paper contained the news of the unexplained suicide of Mr. Luke, of the
  well-known firm of Masters, Luke and Masters; and Mr. Pond sat gently chiding
  himself, because he had not thought of the obvious fact that a man who is
  always tearing and rending people because he has been swindled, may possibly
  discover one day that he has been swindled by his own solicitor. Feversham
  had summoned Luke to that midnight meeting in the garden, in order to tell
  him so; but Mr. Luke, a man careful of his professional standing, had taken
  very prompt steps to prevent Mr. Feversham telling anybody else.</p>

  <p>"It makes me feel very bad," said Mr. Pond, meekly and almost tremulously.
  "At that last meeting of ours I could see he was awfully frightened already;
  and, do you know, I'm very much afraid that it was I who frightened him."</p>

  <h2><a name="c03"
     id="c03">III. &mdash; WHEN DOCTORS AGREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Pond's paradoxes were of a very peculiar kind. They
were indeed
  paradoxical defiances even of the law of paradox. Paradox has been defined as
  "Truth standing on her head to attract attention." Paradox has been defended;
  on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their
  feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that
  writers, like other mendicants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract
  attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the
  head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr.
  Bernard Shaw wrote: "The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule"; or
  Oscar Wilde observed: "I can resist everything except temptation"; or a
  duller scribe (not to be named with these and now doing penance for his
  earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond) said
  in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: "If a
  thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly." To these things do writers
  sink; and then the critics tell them that they "talk for effect"; and then
  the writers answer: "What the devil else should we talk for?
  Ineffectualness?" It is a sordid scene.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Pond belonged to a more polite world and his paradoxes were quite
  different. It was quite impossible to imagine Mr. Pond standing on his head.
  But it was quite as easy to imagine him standing on his head as to imagine
  him trying to attract attention. He was the quietest man in the world to be a
  man of the world; he was a small, neat Civil Servant; with nothing notable
  about him except a beard that looked not only old-fashioned but vaguely
  foreign, and perhaps a little French, though he was as English as any man
  alive. But, for that matter, French respectability is far more respectable
  than English; and Mr. Pond, though in some ways cosmopolitan, was completely
  respectable. Another thing that was faintly French about him was the level
  ripple of his speech: a tripping monotone that never tripped over a single
  vowel. For the French carry their sense of equality even to the equality of
  syllables. With this equable flow, full of genteel gossip on Vienna, he was
  once entertaining a lady; and five minutes later she rejoined her friends
  with a very white face; and whispered to them the shocking secret that the
  mild little man was mad.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of his conversation was this: in the middle of a steady
  stream of sense, there would suddenly appear two or three words which seemed
  simply to be nonsense. It was as if something had suddenly gone wrong with
  the works of a gramophone. It was nonsense which the speaker never seemed to
  notice himself; so that sometimes his hearers also hardly noticed that speech
  so natural was nonsensical. But to those who did notice, he seemed to be
  saying something like, "Naturally, having no legs, he won the walking-race
  easily," or "As there was nothing to drink, they all got tipsy at once."
  Broadly speaking, two kinds of people stopped him with stares or questions:
  the very stupid and the very clever. The stupid because the absurdity alone
  stuck out from a level of intelligence that baffled them; it was indeed in
  itself an example of the truth in paradox. The only part of his conversation
  they could understand was the part they could not understand. And the clever
  stopped him because they knew that, behind each of these queer compact
  contradictions, there was a very queer story&mdash;like the queer story to be
  narrated here.</p>

  <p>His friend Gahagan, that ginger-haired giant and somewhat flippant Irish
  dandy, declared that Pond put in these senseless phrases merely to find out
  whether his listeners were listening. Pond never said so; and his motive
  remained rather a mystery. But Gahagan declared that there is a whole tribe
  of modern intellectual ladies, who have learned nothing except the art of
  turning on a talker a face of ardour and attention, while their minds are so
  very absent that some little phrase like, "Finding himself in India, he
  naturally visited Toronto," will pass harmlessly in at one ear and out at the
  other, without disturbing the cultured mind within.</p>

  <p>It was at a little dinner given by old Wotton to Gahagan and Pond and
  others, that we first got a glimpse of the real meaning of these wild
  parentheses of so tame a talker. The truth was, to begin with, that Mr. Pond,
  in spite of his French beard, was very English in his habit of assuming that
  he ought to be a little dull, in deference to other people. He disliked
  telling long and largely fantastic stories about himself, such as his friend
  Gahagan told, though Pond thoroughly enjoyed them when Gahagan told them.
  Pond himself had had some very curious experiences; but, as he would not turn
  them into long stories, they appeared only as short stories; and the short
  stories were so very short as to be quite unintelligible. In trying to
  explain the eccentricity, it is best to begin with the simplest example, like
  a diagram in a primer of logic. And I will begin with the short story, which
  was concealed in the shorter phrase, which puzzled poor old Wotton so
  completely on that particular evening. Wotton was an old-fashioned
  diplomatist, of the sort that seemed to grow more national by trying to be
  international. Though far from militarist, he was very military. He kept the
  peace by staccato sentences under a stiff grey moustache. He had more chin
  than forehead.</p>

  <p>"They tell me," Wotton was saying, "that the Poles and Lithuanians have
  come to an agreement about Wilno. It was an old row, of course; and I expect
  it was six to one and half a dozen to the other."</p>

  <p>"You are a real Englishman, Wotton," said Gahagan, "and you say in your
  heart, 'All these foreigners are alike.' You're right enough if you mean that
  we're all unlike you. The English are the lunatics of the earth, who know
  that everybody else is mad. But we do sometimes differ a little from each
  other, you know. Even we in Ireland have been known to differ from each
  other. But you see the Pope denouncing the Bolshevists, or the French
  Revolution rending the Holy Roman Empire, and you still say in your hearts,
  'What can the difference be betwixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee?'"</p>

  <p>"There was no difference," said Pond, "between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
  You will remember that it is distinctly recorded that they agreed. But
  remember what they agreed about."</p>

  <p>Wotton looked a little baffled and finally grunted: "Well, if these
  fellows have agreed, I suppose there will be a little peace."</p>

  <p>"Funny things, agreements," said Pond. "Fortunately people generally go on
  disagreeing, till they die peacefully in their beds. Men very seldom do fully
  and finally agree. I did know two men who came to agree so completely that
  one of them naturally murdered the other; but as a rule . . ."</p>

  <p>"'Agreed so completely,'" said Wotton thoughtfully. "Don't you&mdash;are
  you quite sure you don't mean: 'Disagreed so completely'?"</p>

  <p>Gahagan uttered a sort of low whoop of laughter. "Oh, no," he said, "he
  doesn't mean that. I don't know what the devil he does mean; but he doesn't
  mean anything so sensible as that."</p>

  <p>But Wotton, in his ponderous way, still attempted to pin down the narrator
  to a more responsible statement; and the upshot of it was that Mr. Pond was
  reluctantly induced to explain what he really meant and let us hear the whole
  story.</p>

  <p>The mystery was involved at first in another mystery: the strange murder
  of Mr. James Haggis, of Glasgow, which filled the Scottish and English
  newspapers not many years ago. On the face of it, the thing was a curious
  story; to introduce a yet more curious sequel. Haggis had been a prominent
  and wealthy citizen, a bailie of the city and an elder of the kirk. Nobody
  denied that even in these capacities he had sometimes been rather unpopular;
  but, to do him justice, he had often been unpopular through his loyalty to
  unpopular causes. He was the sort of old Radical who is more rigid and
  antiquated than any Tory; and, maintaining in theory the cause of
  Retrenchment and Reform, he managed to suggest that almost any Reform was too
  expensive for the needs of Retrenchment. Thus he had stood alone in
  opposition to the universal support given to old Dr. Campbell's admirable
  campaign for fighting the epidemic in the slums during the slump. But to
  deduce from his economics that he was a demon delighting in the sight of poor
  children dying of typhoid was perhaps an exaggerated inference. Similarly, he
  was prominent in the Presbyterian councils as refusing all modern compromise
  with the logic of Calvinism; but to infer that he actually hoped all his
  neighbours were damned before they were born is too personal an
  interpretation of theological theory.</p>

  <p>On the other side, he was admittedly honest in business and faithful to
  his wife and family; so that there was a general reaction in favour of his
  memory when he was found stabbed to the heart in the meagre grass of the grim
  little churchyard that adjoined his favourite place of worship. It was
  impossible to imagine Mr. Haggis as involved in any romantic Highland feud
  calling for the dirk, or any romantic assignation interrupted with the
  stiletto; and it was generally felt that to be knifed and left unburied among
  the buried dead was an exaggerated penalty for being a rather narrow Scottish
  merchant of the old school.</p>

  <p>It happened that Mr. Pond himself had been present at a little party where
  there was high debate about the murder as a mystery. His host, Lord
  Glenorchy, had a hobby of reading books on criminology; his hostess, Lady
  Glenorchy, had the less harmful hobby of reading those much more solid and
  scientific books which are called detective stories. There were present, as
  the society papers say, Major MacNabb, the Chief Constable, and Mr. Lancelot
  Browne, a brilliant London barrister who found it much more of a bore to be a
  lawyer than to pretend to be a detective; also, among those present, was the
  venerable and venerated Dr. Campbell, whose work among the poor has already
  been inadequately commended, and a young friend of his named Angus, whom he
  was understood to be coaching and instructing generally for his medical
  examinations and his scientific career.</p>

  <p>Responsible people naturally love to be irresponsible. All these persons
  delighted to throw theories about in private which they need not answer for
  in public. The barrister, being a humane man, was delighted to prosecute
  somebody whom he would not have to hang. The criminologist was enchanted to
  analyse the lunacy of somebody he could never have proved to be a lunatic.
  And Lady Glenorchy was charmed at the chance of considering poor Mr. Haggis
  (of all people) as the principal character in a shocker. Hilarious attempts
  were made to fix the crime on the United Presbyterian minister, a notorious
  Sublapsarian, naturally, nay inevitably, impelled to stick a dirk in a
  Supralapsarian. Lord Glenorchy was more serious, not to say monotonous.
  Having learnt from his books of criminology the one great discovery of that
  science, that mental and moral deformity are found only among poor people, he
  suspected a plot of local Communists (all with the wrong-shaped thumb and
  ear) and picked for his fancy a Socialist agitator of the city. Mr. Angus
  made bold to differ; his choice was an old lag, or professional criminal,
  known to be in the place, who had been almost everything that is alarming
  except a Socialist agitator. Then it was that the point was referred, not
  without a certain reverence, to the white-haired and wise old physician, who
  had now behind him a whole lifetime of charity and good works. One of the
  many ways in which Dr. Campbell seemed to have emerged from an elder and
  perhaps honester world was the fact that he not only spoke with a Scottish
  accent but he spoke Scottish. His speech will, therefore, be rendered here
  with difficulty and in doubt and trembling.</p>

  <p>"Weel, ye will a' be asking wha dirked Jamie Haggis? And I'll tell ye fair
  at the start that I winna gie a bawbee to ken wha dirked Jamie Haggis. Gin I
  kent, I wadna' say. It's a sair thing, na doot, that the freens and
  benefactors o' puir humanity should no be named and fitly celebrated; but
  like the masons that built our gran' cathedral and the gran' poets that wrote
  our ballads of Otterburn and Sir Patrick Spens, the man that achieved the
  virtuous act o' killing Jamie Haggis will ha'e nae pairsonal credit for't in
  this world; it is even possible he might be a wee bit inconvenienced. So
  ye'll get nae guesses out of me; beyond saying I've lang been seekin' a man
  of sic prudence and public spirit."</p>

  <p>There followed that sort of silence in which people are not certain
  whether to laugh, at a deliberate stroke of wit; but before they could do so,
  young Angus, who kept his eyes fixed on his venerable preceptor, had spoken
  with the eagerness of the ardent student.</p>

  <p>"But you'll not say, Dr. Campbell, that murder is right because some acts
  or opinions of the murdered man are wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, if they're wrang enough," replied the benevolent Dr. Campbell
  blandly. "After all, we've nae ither test o' richt and wrang. <i>Salus populi
  suprema lex.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Aren't the Ten Commandments a bit of a test?" asked the young man, with a
  rather heated countenance, emphasized by his red hair, that stood up on his
  head like stiff flames.</p>

  <p>The silver-haired saint of sociology continued to regard him with a wholly
  benevolent smile; but there was an odd gleam in his eye as he answered:</p>

  <p>"Aye, the Ten Commandments are a test. What we doctors are beginning to
  ca' an Intelligence Test."</p>

  <p>Whether it was an accident, or whether the intuitions of Lady Glenorchy
  were a little alarmed by the seriousness of the subject, it was at this point
  that she struck in.</p>

  <p>"Well, if Dr. Campbell won't pronounce for us, I suppose we must all stick
  to our own suspicions. I don't know whether you like cigarettes in the middle
  of dinner; it's a fashion I can't get used to myself."</p>

  <p>At this point in his narrative, Mr. Pond threw himself back in his chair
  with a more impatient movement than he commonly permitted himself.</p>

  <p>"Of course, they will do it," he said, with a mild explosiveness. "They're
  admired and thought very tactful when they do it."</p>

  <p>"When who do what?" said Wotton. "What on earth are you talking about
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I'm talking about hostesses," said Pond, with an air of pain. "Good
  hostesses. Really successful hostesses. They will cut into conversation, on
  the theory that it can be broken off anywhere. Just as it's quite the
  definition of a good hostess to make two people talk when they hate it, and
  part them when they are beginning to like it. But they sometimes do the most
  deadly and awful damage. You see, they stop conversations that are not worth
  starting again. And that's horrible, like murder."</p>

  <p>"But if the conversation's not worth starting again, why is it horrible to
  stop it?" asked the conscientious Wotton, still laboriously in pursuit.</p>

  <p>"Why, <i>that's</i> why it's horrible to stop it," answered Pond, almost
  snappishly for so polite a person. "Talk ought to be sacred because it is so
  light, so tenuous, so trivial, if you will; anyhow, so frail and easy to
  destroy. Cutting short its life is worse than murder; it's infanticide. It's
  like killing a baby that's trying to come to life. It can never be restored
  to life, though one rose from the dead. A good light conversation can never
  be put together again when it's broken to pieces; because you can't get all
  the pieces. I remember a splendid talk at Trefusis's place, that began
  because there was a crack of thunder over the house and a cat howled in the
  garden, and somebody made a rather crude joke about a catastrophe. And then
  Gahagan here had a perfectly lovely theory that sprang straight out of cats
  and catastrophes and everything, and would have started a splendid talk about
  a political question on the Continent."</p>

  <p>"The Catalonian question, I suppose," said Gahagan, laughing, "but I fear
  I've quite forgotten my lovely theory."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I say," said Pond, gloomily. "It could only have been
  started then; it ought to have been sacred because it wasn't worth starting
  again. The hostess swept it all out of our heads, and then had the cheek to
  say afterwards that we could talk about it some other time. Could we? Could
  we make a contract with a cloud to break just over the roof, and tie a cat up
  in the garden and pull its tail at the right moment, and give Gahagan just
  enough champagne to inspire him with a theory so silly that he's forgotten it
  already? It was then or never with that debate being started; and yet bad
  results enough followed from it being stopped. But that, as they say, is
  another story."</p>

  <p>"You must tell it to us another time," said Gahagan. "At present I am
  still curious about the man who murdered another man because he agreed with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," assented Wotton, "we've rather strayed from the subject, haven't
  we?"</p>

  <p>"So Mrs. Trefusis said," murmured Mr. Pond sadly. "I suppose we can't all
  feel the sanctity of really futile conversation. But if you're really
  interested in the other matter, I don't mind telling you all about it; though
  I'd rather not tell you exactly how I came to know all about it. That was
  rather a confidential matter&mdash;what they call a confession. Pardon my
  little interlude on the tactful hostess; it had something to do with what
  followed and I have a reason for mentioning it.</p>

  <p>"Lady Glenorchy quite calmly changed the subject from murder to
  cigarettes; and everybody's first feeling was that we had been done out of a
  very entertaining little tiff about the Ten Commandments. A mere trifle, too
  light and airy to recur to our minds at any other time. But there was another
  trifle that did recur to my own mind afterwards; and kept my attention on a
  murder of which I might have thought little enough at the time, as De Quincey
  says. I remembered once looking up Glenorchy in <i>Who's Who,</i> and seeing
  that he had married the daughter of a very wealthy squire near Lowestoft in
  Suffolk."</p>

  <p>"Lowestoft, Suffolk. These are dark hints," said Gahagan. "Do these in
  themselves point to some awful and suspicious fact?"</p>

  <p>"They point," said Pond, "to the awful fact that Lady Glenorchy is not
  Scottish. If she had introduced the cigarettes at her father's dinner-table
  in Suffolk, such trifles as the Ten Commandments would instantly have been
  tossed away from everyone's mind and memory. But I knew I was in Scotland and
  that the story had only just begun. I have told you that old Campbell was
  tutoring or coaching young Angus for his medical degree. It was a great
  honour for a lad like Angus to have Campbell for a coach; but it must have
  been quite agreeable even to an authority like Campbell to have Angus for a
  pupil. For he had always been a most industrious and ambitious and
  intelligent pupil, and one likely to do the old man credit; and after the
  time I speak of, he seemed to grow more industrious and ambitious than ever.
  In fact, he shut himself up so exclusively with his coach that he failed in
  his examination. That was what first convinced me that my guess was
  right."</p>

  <p>"And very lucid, too," said Gahagan with a grin. "He worked so hard with
  his coach that he failed in his examination. Another statement that might
  seem to some to require expansion."</p>

  <p>"It's very simple, really," said Mr. Pond innocently. "But in order to
  expand it, we must go back for a moment to the mystery of Mr. Haggis's
  murder. It had already spread a sort of detective fever in the neighbourhood;
  for all the Scots love arguing and it really was rather a fascinating riddle.
  One great point in the mystery was the wound, which seemed at first to have
  been made by a dirk or dagger of some kind but was afterwards found by the
  experts to demand a different instrument of rather peculiar shape. Moreover,
  the district had been combed for knives and daggers; and temporary suspicion
  fixed on any wild youths from beyond the Highland line, who might retain an
  historic tenderness for the possession of dirks. All the medical authorities
  agreed that the instrument had been something more subtle than a dirk, though
  no medical authorities would consent even to guess what it was. People were
  perpetually ransacking the churchyard and the church in search of clues. And
  just about this time young Angus, who had been a strict supporter of this
  particular church, and had even once induced his old tutor and friend to sit
  under its minister for one evening service, suddenly left off going there;
  indeed, he left off going to any church at all. So I realized that I was
  still on the right track."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Wotton blankly, "so you realized that you were still on the
  right track."</p>

  <p>"I fear I did not realize that you were on any track," said Gahagan. "To
  speak with candour, my dear Pond, I should say that of all the trackless and
  aimless and rambling human statements I have ever heard, the most rambling
  was the narrative we have just been privileged to hear from you. First you
  tell us that two Scotsmen began a conversation about the morality of murder
  and never finished it; then you go off on a tirade against society hostesses;
  then you reveal the horrid fact that one of them came from Lowestoft; then
  you go back to one of the Scotsmen and say he failed to pass his examination
  because he worked so hard with his tutor; then, pausing for a moment upon the
  peculiar shape of an undiscovered dagger, you tell us that the Scotsman has
  left off going to church and you are on the right track. Frankly, if you
  really do find something sacred about futile conversation, I should say that
  you were on the track of that all right."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mr. Pond patiently, "all I've said is quite relevant to
  what really happened; but, of course, you don't know what really happened. A
  story always does seem rambling and futile if you leave out what really
  happened. That's why newspapers are so dull. All the political news, and much
  of the polite news (though rather higher in tone than the other), is made
  quite bewildering and pointless by the necessity of telling stories without
  telling the story."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Gahagan, "let us try to get some sense out of all this
  nonsense, which has not even the excuses of newspaper nonsense. To take one
  of your nonsense remarks as a test, why do you say that Angus failed to pass
  because he worked so much with his coach?"</p>

  <p>"Because he didn't work with his coach," replied Pond. "Because I didn't
  say he worked with his coach. At least I didn't say he worked for the
  examination. I said he was with his coach. I said he spent days and nights
  with his coach; but they weren't preparing for any examination."</p>

  <p>"Well, what were they doing?" asked Wotton gruffly.</p>

  <p>"They were going on with the argument," cried Pond, in a squeak that was
  almost shrill. "They hardly stopped to sleep or eat; but they went on with
  the argument; the argument interrupted at the dinner-table. Have you never
  known any Scotsmen? Do you suppose that a woman from Suffolk with a handful
  of cigarettes, and a mouthful of irrelevance, can stop two Scotsmen from
  going on with an argument when they've started it? They began it again when
  they were getting their hats and coats; they were at it hammer and tongs as
  they went out of the gate, and only a Scottish poet can describe what they
  did then:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    And the tane went hame with the ither; and then,<br>
    The tither went hame with the ither again.
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>"And for hours and weeks and months they never turned aside from the same
  interminable debate on the thesis first propounded by Dr. Campbell: that when
  a good man is well and truly convinced that a bad man is actively bad for the
  community, and is doing evil on a large scale which cannot be checked by law
  or any other action, the good man has a moral right to murder the bad man,
  and thereby only increases his own goodness."</p>

  <p>Pond paused a moment, pulling his beard and staring at the table; then he
  began again:</p>

  <p>"For reasons I've already mentioned but not explained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what's the matter with you, my boy," said Gahagan genially. "There
  are always such a damned lot of things you have mentioned but not
  explained."</p>

  <p>"For those reasons," went on Pond deliberately, "I happen to know a great
  deal about the stages of that stubborn and forcible controversy, about which
  nobody else knew anything at all. For Angus was a genuine truth-seeker who
  wished to satisfy his soul and not merely to make his name; and Campbell was
  enough of a great man to be quite as anxious to convince a pupil as to
  convince a crowd in a lecture-room. But I am not going to tell you about
  those stages of the controversy at any great length. To tell the truth, I am
  not what people call impartial on this controversy. How any man can form any
  conviction, and remain what they call impartial on any controversy, is more
  than I have ever understood. But I suppose they would say I couldn't describe
  the debate fairly; because the side I sympathize with was not the side that
  won.</p>

  <p>"Society hostesses, especially when they come from near Lowestoft, do not
  know where an argument is tending. They will drop not only bricks but
  bombshells; and then expect them not to explode. Anyhow, I knew where that
  argument at Glenorchy's table was tending. When Angus made a test of the Ten
  Commandments, and Campbell said they were an Intelligence Test, I knew what
  would come next. In another minute, he would be saying that nobody of
  intelligence now troubles about the Ten Commandments.</p>

  <p>"What a disguise there is in snowy hair and the paternal stoop of age!
  Dickens somewhere describes a patriarch who needed no virtue except his white
  hair. As Dr. Campbell smiled across the table at Angus, most people saw
  nothing in that smile but patriarchal and parental kindness. But I happened
  to see also a glint in the eye, which told me that the old man was quite as
  much of a fighter as the red-haired boy who had rashly challenged him. In
  some odd way, indeed, I seemed suddenly to see old age itself as a
  masquerade. The white hair had turned into a white wig, the powder of the
  eighteenth century; and the smiling face underneath it was the face of
  Voltaire.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Andrew Glenlyon Campbell was a real philanthropist; so was Voltaire.
  It is not always certain whether philanthropy means a love of men, or of man,
  or of mankind. There is a difference. I think he cared less about the
  individual than about the public or the race; hence doubtless his gentle
  eccentricity of defending an act of private execution. But anyhow, I knew he
  was one of the grim line of Scottish sceptics, from Hume down to Ross or
  Robertson. And, whatever else they are, they are stubborn and stick to their
  point. Angus also was stubborn, and as I have already said, he was a devout
  worshipper in the same dingy kirk as the late James Haggis; that is, one of
  the extreme irreconcilable sectaries of the seventeenth-century Puritanism.
  And so the Scottish atheist and the Scottish Calvinist argued and argued and
  argued, until milder races might have expected them to drop down dead with
  fatigue. But it was not of disagreement that either of them died.</p>

  <p>"But the advantage was with the older and more learned man in his attack;
  and you must remember that the younger man had only a rather narrow and
  provincial version of the creed to defend. As I say, I will not bore you with
  the arguments; I confess they rather bore me. Doubtless Dr. Campbell said
  that the Ten Commandments could not be of divine origin, because two of them
  are mentioned by the virtuous Emperor Foo Chi, in the Second Dynasty; or one
  of them is paraphrased by Synesius of Samothrace and attributed to the lost
  code of Lycurgus."</p>

  <p>"Who was Synesius of Samothrace?" inquired Gahagan, with an appearance of
  sudden and eager curiosity.</p>

  <p>"He was a mythical character of the Minoan Age first discovered in the
  twentieth century A.D.," replied the unruffled Pond. "I made him up just now;
  but you know the sort of thing I mean&mdash;the mythical nature of Mount
  Sinai proved from the parallel myth that the ark rested on Mount Ararat, and
  the mountain that would not come to Mahomet. But all this textual criticism
  really affects a religion only founded on texts. I knew how the fight was
  going; and I knew when it ended. I knew when Robert Angus left off going to
  kirk on the Sabbath."</p>

  <p>The end of the debate may best be described more directly; for, indeed,
  Mr. Pond described it himself with a strange sort of directness; almost as if
  he had unaccountably been present, or had seen it in a vision. Anyhow, it
  appears that the operating-theatre of the medical schools was the scene of
  the final phase of disagreement and agreement. They had gone back there very
  late at night, when the schools were closed and the theatre deserted, because
  Angus fancied he had left some of his instruments there, which it would be
  more neat and proper to lock up. There was no sound in that hollow place but
  the echo of their own footsteps, and very little light save a faint moonshine
  that trickled through the cracks between the curtained windows. Angus had
  retrieved his operating-tool, and was turning again towards the steep stairs
  that climbed through the semi-circular rows of seats, when Campbell said to
  him casually.</p>

  <p>"Ye'll find the facts I mentioned aboot the Aztec hymns in the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Angus tossed the tool on the table like a man throwing down his sword, and
  turned on his companion with a new and transfigured air of candour and
  finality.</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble about hymns any more; I may as well tell you that
  I've done with them, for one. You're too strong for me&mdash;or, rather, the
  truth is too strong for me. I've defended my own nursery nightmare as long as
  I could; but you've woken me up at last. You are right, you must be right; I
  don't see any way out of it."</p>

  <p>After a silence, Campbell answered very softly: "I'll no mak' apologies
  for fighting for the truth; but, man, ye made a real bonny fight for the
  falsehood."</p>

  <p>It might well have seemed that the old blasphemer had never spoken on the
  topic in a tone so delicate and respectful; and it seemed strange that his
  new convert did not respond to the appeal. Looking up, Campbell saw that his
  new convert's attention had been abruptly abstracted; he was standing staring
  at the implement in his hand: a surgical knife made upon an odd pattern for
  special purposes. At last he said in a hoarse and almost inaudible voice:</p>

  <p>"A knife of an unusual shape."</p>

  <p>"See report o' inquest on Jamie Haggis," said the old man, nodding
  benevolently. "Aye, ye've guessed richt, I'm thinking." Then, after a pause,
  he added, with equal calm:</p>

  <p>"Noo that we are agreed, and a' of one mind, aboot the need for sic social
  surgery, it's as weel ye should know the hale truth. Aye, lad, I did it
  mysel'; and with a blade like yon. That nicht ye took me to the
  kirk&mdash;weel, it's the fairst time, I hope, I've ever been hypocreetical;
  but I stayed behind to pray, and I think ye had hopes of my convairsion. But
  I prayed because Jamie prayed; and when he rose from his prayers, I followed
  him and killed him i' the kirkyard."</p>

  <p>Angus was still looking at the knife in silence; then he said suddenly:
  "Why did you kill him?"</p>

  <p>"Ye needna ask, noo we are agreed in moral philosophy," replied the old
  doctor simply. "It was just plain surgery. As we sacrifice a finger to save
  the body, so we maun sacrifice a man to save the body politic. I killed him
  because he was doing evil, and inhumanly preventing what was guid for
  humanity: the scheme for the slums and the lave. And I understand that, upon
  reflection, ye tak the same view."</p>

  <p>Angus nodded grimly.</p>

  <p>The proverb asks: "Who shall decide when doctors disagree?" But in that
  dark and ominous theatre of doctoring the doctors agreed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Angus, "I take the same view. Also, I have had the same
  experience."</p>

  <p>"And what's that?" inquired the other.</p>

  <p>"I have had daily dealings with a man I thought was doing nothing but
  evil," answered Angus. "I still think you were doing evil; even though you
  were serving truth. You have convinced me that my beliefs were dreams; but
  not that dreaming is worse than waking up. You brutally broke the dreams of
  the humble, sneered at the weak hopes of the bereaved. You seem cruel and
  inhuman to me, just as Haggis seemed cruel and inhuman to you. You are a good
  man by your own code, but so was Haggis a good man by his code. He did not
  pretend to believe in salvation by good works, any more than you pretended to
  believe in the Ten Commandments. He was good to individuals, but the crowd
  suffered; you are good to the crowd and an individual suffered. But, after
  all, you also are only an individual."</p>

  <p>Something in the last words, that were said very softly, made the old
  doctor stiffen suddenly and then start backwards towards the steps behind.
  Angus sprang like a wildcat and pinned him to his place with a choking
  violence; still talking, but now at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Day after day, I have itched and tingled to kill you; and been held back
  only by the superstition you have destroyed tonight. Day after day, you have
  been battering down the scruples which alone defended you from death. You
  wise thinker; you wary reasoner; you fool! It would be better for you
  to-night if I still believed in God and in his Commandment against
  murder."</p>

  <p>The old man twisted speechlessly in the throttling grip, but he was too
  feeble, and Angus flung him with a crash across the operating-table, where he
  lay as if fainting. Round them and above them the empty tiers of concentric
  seats glimmered in the faint and frigid moonlight as desolate as the
  Colosseum under the moon; a deserted amphitheatre where there was no human
  voice to cry <i>"Habet!"</i> The red-haired slayer stood with the knife
  uplifted, as strange in shape as the flint knife of some prehistoric
  sacrifice; and still he talked on in the high tones of madness.</p>

  <p>"One thing alone protected you and kept the peace between us: that we
  disagreed. Now we agree, now we are at one in thought&mdash;and deed, I can
  do as you would do. I can do as you have done. We are at peace."</p>

  <p>And with the sound of that word he struck; and Andrew Campbell moved for
  the last time. In his own cold temple, upon his own godless altar . . . he
  stirred and then lay still; and the murderer bent and fled from the building
  and from the city and across the Highland line at night, to hide himself in
  the hills.</p><br>

  <p class="first">When Pond had told this story, Gahagan rose slowly to his
  gigantic height and knocked out his cigar in an ashtray: "I darkly suspect,
  Pond," he said, "that you are not quite so irrelevant as you sound. Not quite
  irrelevant, I mean, even to our opening talk about European affairs."</p>

  <p>"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed&mdash;to have a battle," said Pond. "We
  are rather easily satisfied with saying that some people like Poles or
  Prussians or other foreigners have agreed. We don't often ask what they've
  agreed on. But agreement can be rather risky, unless it's agreement with the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Wotton looked at him with a smouldering suspicion; but finally decided,
  with a sigh of relief, that it was only metaphysics.</p>

  <h2><a name="c04"
     id="c04">IV. &mdash; POND THE PANTALOON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"No, no, no," said Mr. Pond, with a gentle shrillness which
he
  occasionally showed, when any doubt was thrown on the prosaic precision of
  his statements or arguments. "I did not say it was a red pencil, and that was
  why it made such black marks. I said it was relatively a red pencil, or
  resembled a red pencil, as compared with Wotton's view in regarding it as a
  blue pencil; and <i>that</i> was why it made such black marks. The
  distinction may seem a small one; but I assure you the most enormous errors
  arise out of this habit of taking a remark out of its context, and then
  stating it not quite correctly. The most ordinary and obvious truths, when
  reported in that way, may be made to sound almost absurd."</p>

  <p>"Almost," said Captain Gahagan, nodding gravely and gazing at the little
  man opposite him, rather as if he were a mysterious monster in a tank.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond was in his private tank, or private office, in a hive of
  Government offices, sitting at a desk and busy at the work of blue-pencilling
  the proofs of some official report; whence had arisen the talk about the
  colour of the pencil. Pond, in short, was doing his morning's work as usual;
  Peter Gahagan was doing nothing, also as usual; his large figure lounged in a
  chair that looked too small for him; he was attached to Mr. Pond and even
  more attached to watching other people work.</p>

  <p>"I may resemble Polonius," said Pond, modestly; and, indeed, his
  old-fashioned beard, owlish expression and official courtliness made the
  comparison almost apt. "I may be like Polonius; but I am not
  Polonius&mdash;which is just the point I wish to illustrate. Hamlet told
  Polonius that a cloud in the sky was like a camel. The effect would have been
  somewhat different if Hamlet had stated, seriously and scientifically, that
  he had seen a camel in the sky. In that case, Polonius might have been
  pardoned in regarding the Prince's madness as finally proved. Touchy
  officials have been known to express the view that you, my dear Gahagan, come
  into this office like a buffalo, and there 'lie wallowing through the long
  summer day,' as an outmoded poet puts it. But if the authorities of the Zoo
  sent for you on the ground that you actually <i>were</i> a buffalo, the
  department would hardly move in the matter without further inquiries."</p>

  <p>"No doubt you have my <i>dossier</i>," said Gahagan, "with official
  calculations and statistics about the number of my legs, not to mention my
  horns; all annotated with blue and red pencil&mdash;and most certainly with
  some very black marks against my name. But that brings me back to the
  original subject of my simple wonder. You hardly seem to have noticed what
  was really peculiar in your own remark. In any case, I do not quite
  understand what you mean by a pencil being relatively red. . . ."</p>

  <p>"Even that phrase might be defended," observed Mr. Pond, with a faint
  smile. "You would say, for instance, that my notes on this proof are in blue
  pencil; and yet&mdash;" He held out a pencil with its red chalk point towards
  the other. It looked like a mild conjuring trick, until he twiddled it so as
  to show it was one of those pencils sold by most stationers, with red at one
  end and blue at the other. "Now suppose I wear down the blue point till it
  has nearly gone (and really the misprints they can put into a simple report
  on Baluchistan Bimetallism are incredible), then you would say the pencil was
  relatively red, though still perhaps rather blue. If the red end were worn
  away, you would say it was mostly blue, though a little red."</p>

  <p>"I should say nothing of the sort," exclaimed Gahagan with abrupt
  impatience. "I should say what I said before; that the queer thing about you
  is that you are quite blind to what was really mad in your statement. You
  can't see the paradox in your own remark. You can't see the point of your own
  remark."</p>

  <p>"The point of my remark," said Mr. Pond, with dignity, "which I thought I
  had made sufficiently clear, was that people are very inexact in reporting
  statements, as in cases like a camel and 'something like a camel.'"</p>

  <p>Peter Gahagan continued to stare with round eyes at his friend, like a
  buffalo in a very ruminant phase; and eventually heaved himself up,
  collecting his grey top-hat and walking-stick with a sort of clatter.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I will not point out the point. It would be breaking a
  crystal or shattering a perfectly rounded soap-bubble. To pierce the pure and
  spherical perfection of your maniacal calm would be like invading the
  innocence of a child. If you really and truly do not know when you are
  talking nonsense, if you do not even notice what part of it is nonsense, I
  feel I must leave your nonsensical intellect intact. I will go and talk it
  over with Wotton. As he has often breezily observed, there is no nonsense
  about him."</p>

  <p>And he sauntered out of the room, swinging his stick, in the direction of
  the very important department presided over by Sir Hubert Wotton; that he
  might enjoy the inspiriting spectacle of another friend doing his day's work
  and being interrupted by an idle man.</p>

  <p>Sir Hubert Wotton, however, was of a type somewhat different from Mr.
  Pond; in that, even if he was busy, he was never fussy. Mr. Pond was bent
  over the poised point of his blue pencil; Sir Hubert was first visible behind
  the red end of a cigar, which he was puffing, with a frown of reflection, as
  he turned over the papers on his desk. He recognized the entry of the beaming
  Captain with a grim but not ungracious smile, and waved him to a seat.</p>

  <p>Gahagan sat down with his hands crossed on his stick and thumped it on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Wotton," he said, "I've solved the problem of the Paradoxes of Pond. He
  doesn't know when he's said these crazy things. There's a blind spot on his
  excellent brain, or a cloud comes over his mind for a moment; and he forgets
  that he's even said anything peculiar. He goes on arguing about the
  reasonable part of his speech; he never stops to explain the only thing that
  was really unreasonable. He talked to me quite sensibly about a pencil that
  was bright red, or something like it, and therefore marked very black on the
  paper. I tried to nail him to that piece of inconsequence; and he completely
  eluded me. He went on talking about when a blue pencil was not a blue pencil;
  but he somehow forgot all about the black marks."</p>

  <p>"Black marks!" said Wotton; and sat up so abruptly that he spilt the ash
  of his cigar over his usually immaculate waistcoat. He dusted off the
  defilement with a frown; and then, after a pause, spoke in the staccato
  fashion that occasionally revealed that he was much less conventional than he
  looked.</p>

  <p>"Most fellows who talk paradoxes are only trying to show off. It's not
  like that with Pond; he does it because he's trying <i>not</i> to show off.
  You see&mdash;he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss, as if he'd
  never been unhooked from a desk or a typewriter; but he's really had some
  very extraordinary experiences. He doesn't talk about them; he doesn't want
  to talk about them; but he does want to talk about reason and philosophy and
  theoretical things in books; you know he loves reading all the rational
  eighteenth-century literature. But when, in the course of talking in the
  abstract, he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually
  <i>done</i>&mdash;well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush
  it into a small space and it simply sounds contradictory. Almost every one of
  those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would
  be called by most people a very unadventurous life."</p>

  <p>"I think I see what you mean," said Gahagan, after a pause of radiant
  reflection. "Yes, you're right. You can't expect me to be taken in, mind you,
  by most of your swagger of stoicism in the English public-school man. Half
  the time they are simply showing off by not showing off. But in Pond it's
  genuine. He really does hate the limelight; in that way you may say he was
  made for the Secret Service. And you mean that he only becomes mysterious, in
  this particular manner, when he really does want to keep the secret of his
  services. In other words, you mean there is a story behind every paradox of
  Pond. Certainly that is true&mdash;of all those cases when I have been told
  the story."</p>

  <p>"I know all about this story," said Wotton, "and it was one of the most
  remarkable things that Pond ever did. It was a matter of immense
  importance&mdash;the sort of public affair that has to be kept a very private
  affair. Pond gave two pieces of advice, which some thought very odd and which
  turned out exactly right; and he ended by making a rather extraordinary
  discovery. I don't know how he came to mention it just now; but I'm pretty
  sure it was by accident. When it turned up, he tried to tuck it away again in
  a hurry and change the subject. But he certainly saved England; also he
  nearly got killed."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Gahagan with some astonishment.</p>

  <p>"The fellow must have fired five times at him," said Wotton reminiscently,
  "before he turned the sixth shot on himself."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm blowed," said the Captain elegantly. "I always thought Pond the
  most charming of tea-table comedies; I never knew he figured in a melodrama.
  I should as soon have thought of his figuring in a fairy-pantomime. But he
  seems somehow associated with theatrical things at the moment. He asked me
  himself if he was like Polonius; and I suppose some malicious people would
  say he was more like Pantaloon. I like the notion of you and he magically
  transplanted to a Christmas pantomime: 'Harlequin Hubert and the Fairies'
  Pond,' all ending with a real Harlequinade, with red fire and the Pantaloon
  falling over the Policeman. Pardon my talking nonsense&mdash;you know my
  unfortunate mind only becomes fertile about impossible things."</p>

  <p>"It's curious you should call it impossible," said Sir Hubert Wotton,
  knitting his brows, "because that's almost exactly what really happened to
  us."</p>

  <p>Sir Hubert Wotton showed a certain reticence and deliberate vagueness
  about the official details of the story; even in telling it after so many
  years to an intimate friend. In England especially, there are enormous events
  which never get into the newspapers, and are apparently intended never to get
  into the history-books. It may be enough to say here that there was at one
  time under the surface, but very near to the surface, a conspiracy aiming at
  a <i>coup d'état,</i> which was backed by a Continental Power of similar
  leanings. Gun-running, secret drilling and plans for stealing State documents
  were involved; and it was feared that a certain number of minor officials had
  been corrupted or converted by the conspirators. Hence, when it was a
  question of sending certain very private official documents (about the nature
  of which Wotton remained somewhat hazy to the end) from one of the great
  northern ports to a particular Government department in London, the first
  Council was a very small and select one, presided over by Sir Hubert and held
  in the smaller office of Mr. Pond. Indeed, Mr. Pond was the official in
  charge of the job. The only other person permanently present was one of the
  first officials from Scotland Yard; Wotton had brought his clerk with him to
  arrange and explain certain matters; but had later made an excuse for sending
  the man out on an errand. Dyer, the detective from the Yard, a
  heavy-shouldered, hard-headed person with a toothbrush moustache, explained
  methodically, if a little mechanically, the precautions and arrangements he
  would consider necessary for protecting the transport of the papers to their
  destination. He wanted an armoured car with a machine-gun, a certain number
  of men carrying concealed arms, a police search of everybody involved in
  first dispatching and in finally receiving the box or parcel&mdash;and
  several other conditions of the kind.</p>

  <p>"Pond will think all this terribly expensive," said Wotton, with a sad
  smile. "Pond is quite the Old Liberal in the matter of economy and
  retrenchment. But he will agree that we are all bound to show particular care
  in this case."</p>

  <p>"N-no," said Mr. Pond, pursing his lips dubiously. "I don't think I should
  show any particular care in this case."</p>

  <p>"Not show any particular care!" repeated the astonished Wotton.</p>

  <p>"I certainly shouldn't <i>show</i> it," said Mr. Pond. "In such cases,
  nobody of sense would take such particular precautions, any more than anybody
  would send an important letter by registered post."</p>

  <p>"Well, you must pardon my dullness," said Sir Hubert, "but, as a matter of
  fact, I have heard of people sending an important letter by registered
  post."</p>

  <p>"It is done, I believe," said Mr. Pond, with distant disparagement. "But
  that is when you are trying to prevent a letter being lost. Just now you are
  trying to prevent a letter being found."</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather interesting," said Dyer, with some restrained
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? It's quite simple," answered Pond. "If you want to prevent
  a document from being dropped down a drain, or thrown into a dustbin, or used
  to light the fire or to make a bird's nest, or any other accident of neglect,
  then it is a good thing to draw attention to it, by stamping or sealing or
  safeguarding it in some particular way. But if you want to prevent it from
  being tracked and spotted and snatched out of your hands, by violence or
  stratagem, then it's the worst thing in the world to mark it in a particular
  way. Registration, for instance, doesn't mean that your messenger can't be
  knocked on the head or have his pocket picked. It only means that your
  messenger or his department can be held responsible; may have to apologize or
  compensate. But you don't want apologies or compensations; you want the
  letter. I should say it would be far safer from a watchful enemy, if it were
  unmarked and sent along with a thousand others looking exactly the same."</p>

  <p>It is a tribute to the essential shrewdness, underlying the apparent
  woodenness of Wotton and Dyer, that the paradox of Pond prevailed. The
  documents, however, were too bulky to be treated as ordinary letters; and
  after some discussion, they were placed in one of a large number of white
  wooden boxes, light and not very large, which were in general use for sending
  chocolate and other provisions to the army or navy or some branches of the
  public service. The only part of his original program on which the
  hard-headed Dyer continued to insist was that of putting guards and searchers
  at essential points of the route of travel.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there'll be some damned fuss about it afterwards," he said,
  "and people will pester us about interfering with the liberty of the subject.
  We're handicapped in this confounded constitutional country. Now if we were
  in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shut his mouth rather sharply, as a discreet knock sounded on the door,
  and Sir Hubert's clerk glided in to say he had discharged his commission. Sir
  Hubert did not see him at first, his frowning gaze being fixed on the
  railway-map of the route to be pursued; and Dyer happened at the moment to be
  examining very closely the white deal box, which had already been selected
  and sent in as a sample. But Mr. Pond noticed the clerk; and could not help
  thinking that he was rather worth noticing. He was a young man named Franks,
  with fair hair correctly flattened, and neat enough in figure and costume;
  but his wide face had that indescribable look which is sometimes seen, of
  which we can only say that it suggests the large head on the little figure of
  a dwarf, or perhaps that sunken between the shoulders of a hunchback; the
  face is not normal, even upon a normal figure. But the other causes which
  arrested Mr. Pond's eye for a moment were, first, the fact that the clerk was
  noticeably ill at ease when he silently handed papers to his superior; and,
  last but not least, that he had started visibly when he saw the detective
  from Scotland Yard.</p><br>

  <p class="first">The second Council, if it may be called so, was held in what
  all agreed was the strategical centre of the whole man&oelig;uvre: a certain
  railway-junction in the Midlands. It so happened that the consignment of
  boxes, along with mailbags and similar things, had to be shifted here from
  one train to another, which came up afterwards to the same platform. It was
  at this point that there was most possibility of any interference from
  outside; and it is to be feared that Dyer stretched several points in his
  reluctant compromise with the British Constitution, in the matter of police
  orders which stopped, detained or examined persons attempting to enter or
  leave the station.</p>

  <p>"I have told our people they mustn't even let <i>us</i> out of the
  station," he said, "without close examination, for fear somebody should have
  a fancy for dressing up as Mr. Pond."</p>

  <p>"It has quite a festive sound, so near Christmas," said Mr. Pond
  dolefully. "So I take it that for the present we must stay on the station;
  and one can hardly say it looks particularly festive."</p>

  <p>Nothing, indeed, can well look more desolate than one of the numerous side
  platforms of an empty railway-station on a dreary winter day; unless it is
  the empty Third Class Waiting-Room which is provided to be a human refuge
  from the winter blast. Somehow the waiting-room looks even less human than
  the platform from which it is a refuge; hung with a few printed notices that
  nobody could possibly read, tables of trains or dusty plans of railways,
  equipped in one corner with broken pens with which nobody could write, and
  dried inkstands containing no ink to write with; with one dab of dull
  colours, the faded advertisement of an insurance company. It certainly seemed
  to the casual mind a godforsaken place to be spending any part of Christmas;
  but Mr. Pond had a stoical cheerfulness under such circumstances which rather
  surprised those who only knew his catlike love of comfortable domestic
  routine.</p>

  <p>He entered this empty and unsightly apartment with a brisk step, stopping
  for a moment to stare reflectively at the dried ink and broken pens on the
  corner table.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, turning away, "they couldn't do very much with those,
  anyhow; but, of course, they might have pencils or fountain-pens. I'm rather
  glad I did it, on the whole."</p>

  <p>"Pond," said Wotton gravely, "this is in your department anyhow; and I'm
  sure that Dyer will agree that we've done well to follow your advice so far.
  But I hope you don't mind my having a mild curiosity about what it is that
  you've done."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Pond. "Perhaps I ought to have told you about it
  before. Very likely I ought to have done it before. But just after you'd been
  good enough to let me have my own way, about sending it along with all the
  other stuff in plain identical boxes, I sat down and had a hard think about
  what would be the next best precaution following on that. I'm pretty certain
  that if it had been taken in a special car by armed men, that car would have
  been wrecked and those armed men perhaps robbed by force of arms; anyhow,
  there was too much of a risk of it. There's a much more elaborate gangster
  organization working against us already than most people have any notion of;
  and to multiply purchases and preparations is to multiply clues and
  transactions for their spies to trail. But I don't think the gangs could
  possibly get in here, especially now that the police are holding the gates of
  all these stations like fortresses. An isolated man or so could do very
  little against them. But what could an isolated man do?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Wotton rather impatiently. "What could he do?"</p>

  <p>"As I say," continued Mr. Pond calmly, "I sat down and had a good think
  about what a spy or stray intruder might do, in a quiet way without any noise
  of battle, murder or sudden death, if he did manage somehow to spot the right
  box. So I got on to the private telephone to headquarters; and told them to
  see that the postal and transport authorities held up every one of the boxes
  or packages on which the address seemed to have been altered; anything
  crossed out or anything substituted. A man might conceivably snatch a moment
  to re-direct a box to some of his friends in London; though he could never
  take the box out of the station without being searched. That's what I did;
  and it was these broken-down penholders that reminded me of it. It's a pretty
  broken-down place to spend Christmas in, as you say; they have given us a
  sort of a fire, which is more than some waiting-rooms do; but it looks as if
  it were dying of depression; and I don't wonder."</p>

  <p>He stirred up the neglected fire, making quite a creditable blaze, with
  his usual instinct for the comforts of life; then he added: "I hope you don't
  disagree with that second precaution of mine."</p>

  <p>"No; I think that also is a very sensible precaution; though I hope there
  is no chance of anybody hitting on the right box, even by accident." Hubert
  Wotton frowned a moment at the renewed flame and the dancing sparks, and then
  said gloomily, "This is about the time when people at Christmas are going to
  the pantomime. Or, at any rate, to the pictures."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond nodded; he seemed to be suddenly smitten with a fit of
  abstraction. At last he said:</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder whether things weren't better when pictures meant the
  pictures in the fire, instead of the pictures on the film."</p>

  <p>Sir Hubert Wotton gruffly suggested, in a general way, that the dingy fire
  in a Third Class Waiting-Room was not one in which he would prefer to look
  for pictures.</p>

  <p>"The fire pictures, like the cloud pictures," went on Mr. Pond, "are just
  incomplete enough to call out the imagination to complete them. Besides," he
  added, cheerfully poking the fire, "you can stick a poker into the coals and
  break them up into a different picture; whereas, if you push a great pole
  through the screen because you don't like the face of a film-star, there is
  all sorts of trouble."</p>

  <p>Dyer, who had stamped out on to the platform during this imaginative
  interlude, returned at this moment with highly practical news. By exploring
  many tunnels, and scouring many platforms on that labyrinthine junction, he
  had found that there really was a remote refreshment-room, in which it was
  possible to have some sort of lunch; which had been a silent problem for all
  three of the officials involved.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay on this platform," he said; "in fact I shall stay on this
  platform all night if necessary. This is my particular job. But you go and
  get your lunch first and come back; and I'll see if I can get some
  afterwards. Never mind about the trains; I've arranged for all that; and,
  anyhow, I shall be there when the only possible moment of danger comes."</p>

  <p>In fact, his last words were almost drowned in the throb and racket of the
  approach of the first train. They all saw the mailbags and boxes and packages
  duly put out on the platform; and then Wotton, a man of regular habits, who
  was beginning to feel rather peckish, was easily persuaded by Dyer to accept
  his arrangement and go in search of a bite of food. Wotton and Pond
  dispatched their rather meagre lunch with reasonable rapidity; but even so
  had occasion to quicken their footsteps as they came within sight of their
  own original platform; since a train, which was apparently the second train,
  was beginning to shift and puff out of the station; and when they rejoined
  their companion, the platform was already bare.</p>

  <p>"All safe," said Dyer, with satisfaction. "I saw all the boxes and things
  into the van myself; and nobody's been here to interfere with them. Our main
  trouble is really over; and I shouldn't mind having a little lunch
  myself."</p>

  <p>He grinned at them, rubbing his hands in a congratulatory manner; and as
  he turned towards the subterranean passages, they turned once more with the
  intention of returning to the hollow and smoky cell of the waiting-room.</p>

  <p>"It does seem as if there were nothing more for us to do here," said
  Wotton. "It rather increases the freezing futility of this shack."</p>

  <p>"I consider it quite a Christmas triumph," said Mr. Pond, with
  undiminished cheerfulness, "that we have managed to keep the fire in, anyhow.
  . . . Why, I believe it's begun to snow."</p>

  <p>For some time they had noted that the afternoon, already darkening towards
  the early winter evening, had something of that lurid greenish light which
  often glows under the load of snow-clouds; a sprinkling began to fall as they
  went along the apparently interminable platform; and by the time they reached
  the austere waiting-room, its roof and doorway were powdered with silver. The
  fire was burning briskly inside; Dyer had evidently been keeping himself
  warm.</p>

  <p>"It's devilish queer," said Wotton, "but the whole thing is really
  beginning to look like a Christmas card. Our dismal <i>salle d'attente</i>
  will soon be a parody of Father Christmas's cottage in a pantomime."</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is like the parody of a pantomime," said Pond in a lower
  and more disquieted tone, "and as you say, it is very queer."</p>

  <p>After a pause, Wotton added abruptly:</p>

  <p>"What is worrying you, Pond?"</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering, if not worrying," answered Pond, "about exactly what a man
  <i>would</i> do to intercept or misdirect that box, in a place like this,
  with no pens or anything. . . . Of course, there's not much in that; he might
  have a fountain-pen or a pencil."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've settled all that; you seem to be mad on pencils," said Wotton
  impatiently. "It comes of always blue-pencilling those everlasting proofs of
  yours."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be a blue pencil," said Pond, shaking his head. "I was
  thinking of something more like a red pencil; which would mark very black
  indeed. But what bothers me is that there are always more ways of doing
  anything than you'd fancy, even in a place like this."</p>

  <p>"But you've blocked all that already," insisted the other; "by telephoning
  as you did."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Pond obstinately, "and what would they do then; if they knew
  I'd telephoned?"</p>

  <p>Wotton looked puzzled; and Pond sat down in silence, stirring the fire and
  staring at it.</p>

  <p>After a silence he said abruptly: "I wish Dyer were back."</p>

  <p>"What do you want him now for?" asked his friend. "I should say he'd
  earned a little late lunch. As far as I can see, he's finished the business;
  and it's all over here."</p>

  <p>"I fear," said Pond, without taking his head out of the fireplace, "that
  it's only just going to begin."</p>

  <p>There was another silence of growing mystification, like the gathering
  darkness outside. And then Pond observed suddenly:</p>

  <p>"I suppose we've come back to the right platform."</p>

  <p>Wotton's face only expressed the stolid stupefaction natural under the
  circumstances; but in his depths, which were deeper than some supposed, an
  unearthly chill touched him for the first time. Nightmare stirred in its
  sleep; not the mere practical perplexity of a problem, but all those doubts
  beyond reason which revolve round place and time. Before he could speak, Pond
  added:</p>

  <p>"This is a different shaped poker."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" exploded Wotton at last. "They have locked
  up the station; and there is nobody on it but ourselves; except that girl in
  the bar. You don't imagine she has put a new set of furniture and fire-irons
  in all the waiting-rooms?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Pond. "I didn't say a new poker. I said a new shape of
  poker."</p>

  <p>Almost as he spoke, he leapt away from the fireplace, leaving the poker in
  the fire, and ran to the doorway, craning out his head and listening. His
  companion listened also; and recognized as an objective reality, which was no
  nightmare, a noise of scrambling footsteps somewhere on the platform. But,
  when they ran out, the platform appeared to be perfectly empty, now a blank
  and solid table of snow; and they began to realize that the noise came from
  underneath their feet. Looking over the railing, they saw that the whole
  raised woodwork of the station was intercepted at one point by a belt of
  grassy embankment, very grey and discoloured with the smoke; they were just
  in time to see a dark lean figure scramble up this bank and dive under the
  platform, in such a manner that he was able the next moment to crawl out on
  the line. Then he calmly mounted the platform, and stood there like a
  passenger waiting for a train.</p>

  <p>Apart from the fact that the stranger had practically burgled the station,
  against such very special difficulties, Wotton's mind, already full of
  suspicions, decided at a glance that he was very much of a dark horse.
  Curiously enough, he looked a little like a horse, having a long equine
  visage and a strange sort of stoop; he was swarthy and haggard and his hollow
  eyes were such dense patches of shadow that it was a sort of shock to realize
  that the eyes within were glaring. He was dressed with the last extreme of
  shabbiness, in a long threadbare and almost ragged waterproof; and they
  thought they had never seen before a face and figure so symbolic of
  desolation and dreary tragedy. It seemed to Wotton that he himself had his
  first real glimpse of those depths in which despair manufactures the many
  revolutionary movements which it had been his duty to combat; but, of
  necessity, his duty prevailed.</p>

  <p>He stepped up to the man, asking him who and what he was, and why he had
  thus evaded the police blockade. The man appeared to ignore the other
  questions for the moment; but in answer to the question about what he was,
  his tragic lantern-jaw moved and emitted a very unexpected reply.</p>

  <p>"I am a Clown," he said in a depressed voice.</p>

  <p>At this answer Mr. Pond seemed to start with altogether a new sort of
  surprise. He had ruminated on the puzzles hitherto, like one pursuing the
  study of things which some might find surprising, but at which he himself was
  no longer very much surprised. But he gaped helplessly at this as a man does
  at a miracle; or still more, in a case like this, at a coincidence. Then
  another and yet more undignified change came over him. It can only be said
  that, having begun by goggling, he ended by giggling.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord, this is an extra!" he exclaimed, and seemed once more broken up
  by almost senile laughter. "This has nothing to do with the story; but it is
  a marvellous addition to the pantomime. I always noticed that the chief
  features in the pantomime had nothing to do with the story."</p>

  <p>But Sir Hubert Wotton was having no more for the moment of Mr. Pond's
  fanciful mysteries; least of all, of the last and most mysterious, the
  mystery of his mirth. He had already begun to cross-examine the stranger in
  the style of the police; and the stranger stood up to him with gloomy but
  unshaken lucidity. His name, by his own account, was Hankin, and he was a
  public entertainer who also gave private entertainments; who was, indeed,
  only too glad to give any entertainments, in the depressed condition of his
  state of livelihood. He had an engagement to perform as clown at a children's
  party that evening, and had insisted on the necessity of catching a
  particular train; nor had he been cheered by the assurance of the police at
  the entrance that regular trains for passengers would be running again in an
  hour, at a time that would make him too late for his appointment; and lose
  him the first few shillings he had earned in many months. He had done what
  many such people would probably have been glad to do, if they had had the
  activity and audacity, and had climbed into the station by an unguarded
  loophole. This statement was made with firmness and simplicity, and Pond
  evidently believed it; but Wotton was still smouldering with some
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>"I must ask you to come with us to the waiting-room," he said. "Have you
  anything about you to confirm your story?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't got my visiting-card," said the sombre Mr. Hankin. "I lost it
  along with my Rolls-Royce and my little castle in Scotland. But you can see
  me in my resplendent and fashionable evening-dress, if you like. I think that
  ought to convince you."</p>

  <p>The man was carrying a shabby and misshapen bag, which he lugged along to
  the waiting-room; and there, before the staring eyes of Wotton, he stripped
  off his waterproof and appeared in a sort of white circus dress, but for
  retaining his shabby boots and trousers. Then he dived into the bag and
  brought out a monstrous grinning and glaring white mask, picked out with red
  ornaments, and fitted it on his head. And there, solid and seemingly
  incredible before their eyes, was the genuine clown of the old-fashioned
  pantomime, such as they had been discussing.</p>

  <p>"He came up through a trapdoor, I suppose we must say," murmured the
  awestruck Mr. Pond. "But I feel as if he had fallen out of the sky like the
  snow. Fate or the fairies have added this final touch; see how they built up
  gradually round us the whole palace of pantomime in this wilderness; first
  the firelight and then the snow and now the only original 'Here We Are
  Again!' Such a cosy happy Christmas! Screams of joy from all the tiny tots. .
  . . Oh, my God, how ghastly it all is!"</p>

  <p>His friend looked at him and received a second shock in realizing that the
  bearded face, though it still wore the elfish look of its first amusement at
  the accident, was in fact terribly pale.</p>

  <p>"And the ghastliest part of it," said Mr. Pond, "is that I am going to
  complete your costume, Sir."</p>

  <p>He suddenly plucked out the poker, from where it was standing in the fire,
  and it emerged already red-hot. He handed it politely to the Clown.</p>

  <p>"I may look like a pantaloon," he said, "but this will obviously be more
  suitable to the Clown. This is the red-hot poker, with which you make the
  Policeman jump."</p>

  <p>Wotton stared at a scene to which he had now entirely lost the clue; and
  in the silence that followed, the long platform outside resounded with a firm
  and heavy stride coming nearer and nearer. The large figure of Dyer the
  detective appeared framed in the doorway; and he stood as if turned to stone
  by what he saw.</p>

  <p>Wotton was not astonished at his astonishment. He presumed that it was an
  astonishment like his own, at the irrelevant intrusion of the pantomime
  figure. But Pond was watching more closely; and for Pond that moment was the
  confirmation of the creeping suspicion that had worked its way into his mind
  for the last hour or so. Nobody could have been surprised at Dyer staring at
  the Clown. But Dyer was not staring at the Clown. Nor was Dyer merely
  astonished; perhaps the most astonishing thing was that he was not exactly
  astonished. He was staring only at the poker; and he obviously saw nothing
  funny about it. His face was distorted by almost demoniac fear and fury; and
  he looked at the red pantomime poker rather as if it had been the flaming
  sword of an accusing angel.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the red-hot poker," said Pond, in a low and almost forced
  voice, "and it does make the policeman jump."</p>

  <p>The policeman jumped; he jumped back three paces, and as he leapt he
  loosened a big official revolver and fired at Mr. Pond again and again; the
  shocks of explosion shaking the thin shanty in which they stood. The first
  shot buried itself in the wall about an inch from Mr. Pond's dome-like
  forehead; the other four went rather wild; for Wotton and the stranger had
  woken up to the situation and were struggling with the would-be assassin, and
  forcing his hand away. Finally, he managed to wrench his hand loose again and
  twist the pistol inwards upon himself; the body of the big man stiffened in
  their arms; and Dyer of the detective service lay dead on the floor before
  the dancing fire.</p><br>

  <p class="first">The explanation of events was given by Mr. Pond some time
  later; for his first action after the catastrophe left no time for
  explanations. He had repeatedly, at intervals, looked at the clock in the
  waiting-room, and seemed satisfied; but he was leaving nothing to chance. He
  darted out of the door, raced down the platform, and found his way to the
  telephone-box he had used earlier in the day. He came out wiping his brow, in
  spite of the cold; but wearing a smile of relative relief in the midst of the
  tragedy. When asked what he was doing, he answered simply: "I was telephoning
  a description of the package. It'll be all right now; they will hold it
  up."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean <i>the</i> package?" asked Wotton. "I thought that was just
  like all the rest."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about it presently," replied Pond. "Let us go and take
  a polite farewell of the public entertainer, who has given us such a
  delightful entertainment. I really think we ought to give him a fiver or so
  in compensation."</p>

  <p>Wotton was very much the gentleman, in the more generous sense, and he
  heartily agreed to this; and, though it was difficult for the melancholy man
  with the horse-face to produce anything nearer to a laugh than a neigh, he
  was manifestly much cheered internally and his gaunt face was cracked with a
  crooked smile. Then, by way of finishing their Christmas feast on this
  curious scene of festivity, the two friends adjourned to the one and only
  refreshment-room and sat down behind two tall glasses of beer; having no
  taste for warming their hands at that rather too blood-red fire that still
  burned in the sinister waiting-room.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"It was curious you were able to corner Dyer like that,"
  said Wotton. "I never had a thought of him."</p>

  <p>"I never had a thought of him either," said Pond, "and he cornered
  himself, just as he killed himself. I fancy many conspirators are really
  chasing themselves into corners like that. Don't you see that he locked
  himself into a logical prison, when he would empty and close the whole
  station, to impress us with his efficiency. By the way, I ought to have
  guessed there was a double meaning in his dictatorial ways and demands to
  override the Constitution; he was talking exactly as our enemies and their
  foreign friends talk. But the point is this. I wasn't thinking about him
  particularly; I never thought of him at all until I found him wandering about
  inside the logical square or enclosure, like a rectangle in geometry. I was
  thinking all the time about one thing: what would these people probably do to
  divert or intercept the box, now that they could hardly do it by direct
  attack or anything that made a noise? I was more and more convinced they
  would try to redirect it somehow, so that its going normally through the post
  would serve them and not us. So I warned the authorities to stop all altered
  addresses on suspicion; and I said to myself: What will the enemy do now?
  What can he do, shut up in this enormous shed, bare of all conveniences and
  appliances? But don't you see that with that very thought came the
  overpowering suspicion of who the enemy was?</p>

  <p>"Nobody was there but you and Dyer when I said I had 'phoned to stop all
  altered addresses. I know in a mystery story I should have to allow for the
  station being thronged with silent eavesdroppers, a spy up the chimney and
  another crawling out of the luggage; but in practical life it doesn't happen.
  We heard the one and only intruder, when he began to scramble up from the
  street. The man who did hear it was Dyer; and notice that he almost
  immediately wandered away up the platform, professing to find our luncheon
  place for us; but really striding up and down and brooding upon what the
  devil he should do next, for I am sure his original plan had been to alter
  the address as I suggested. Was there anything else in that bare beastly
  place he could use for the same purpose, or another similar purpose? There
  was. But I never guessed what it was, until I came back to the waiting-room
  and happened to look at the poker. I saw it was twisted at a slightly
  different angle; that could only mean it had been red-hot and hammered half
  crooked like a horseshoe on the anvil. And then, of course, I realized that a
  red-hot poker would serve as well as a pen or pencil, or rather better, for
  altering an inscription on a wooden box. A pen could only cross it out; but a
  poker could burn it out. Managed neatly, it might well remove all trace of
  there ever having been any label or previous inscription at all. But it would
  do a great deal more than that. The clown is not the only artist who wields a
  poker; there is the whole elegant craft called poker-work. It would be quite
  easy to change the whole appearance of a white deal box, so that it would no
  longer be classed with the other boxes; running a black border round it,
  covering it with a pattern, perhaps blackening it almost entirely. Then in
  one blank space left he would brand the address he wanted it to reach, very
  plain in black block letters, avoiding incidentally all the dangers of being
  traced by handwriting. The thing would have gone through the post to that
  address as a separate thing in an ordinary way; and our scheme for posting it
  in an ordinary way would have recoiled on our heads. As it was, I was just in
  time to describe the poker-work box and stop it. I made a silly joke about a
  red pencil marking black; but even then I had barely begun to suspect Dyer;
  I'm ashamed to say the only person I began by suspecting was your unfortunate
  clerk Franks, who is rather exceptionally innocent."</p>

  <p>"Franks!" exclaimed Wotton. "Why on earth did you suspect him?"</p>

  <p>"Because I was an ass," said Pond, "and much more like a Pantaloon than
  you may imagine. He's a queer-looking fellow; but I ought to have known that
  suffering sort of look is more often conscientiousness than
  unconscientiousness. But where I was a priceless ass was when I looked at the
  suspect instead of looking at the detective. At that moment, Dyer was holding
  the box up, looking at it very closely; and Franks, from the other side,
  could see that he made a minute mark on it, very unobtrusively; so that he
  would know it again. Franks knew about the box scheme; and seeing that very
  swift and furtive act, he started and stared; and I don't wonder. In fact,
  Franks was the real detective and was far ahead of me, for I hadn't suspected
  Dyer at all. Not till, so to speak, I actually found him like a burglar on
  the premises. I might say on the logical premises." He coughed slightly.
  "Pray excuse the pun."</p><br>

  <p class="first">"Well," said Captain Gahagan, when Wotton had told him the
  story long afterwards. "My favourite character in your drama is the Clown. He
  is so irrelevant. I am like that myself. I am so irrelevant."</p>

  <p>"You are," said Sir Hubert Wotton, and resumed the study of his
  documents.</p>

  <p>"He is like the Clown in Shakespeare," went on Gahagan with unchanged
  buoyancy. "The Clown in Shakespeare seems to be there by accident unconnected
  with the story and yet he is the chorus of the tragedy. The Fool is like a
  fantastic dancing flame lighting up the features and furniture of the dark
  house of death. Perhaps we may connect Pond and Polonius after all." And he
  continued to illustrate his theory of the buffoons in Shakespeare, a dramatic
  poet to whom he was fervently devoted, quoting large portions of the plays in
  question in the old oratorical Irish fashion, to the no small aid and
  acceleration of the business of the department, busy at the moment with
  oppressing and delicate problems about American claims concerning the
  commerce of Vancouver.</p>

  <h2><a name="c05"
     id="c05">V. &mdash; THE UNMENTIONABLE MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Pond was eating oysters&mdash;a serious and improving
sight. His
  friend Wotton did not care for oysters; saying he could not see the sense of
  swallowing something you could hardly taste. He often said he could not see
  the sense of things; and was deaf to the wistful questions of his friend
  Gahagan, about whether he might perhaps see the nonsense. There was no
  nonsense about Sir Hubert Wotton; and there was a great deal of nonsense
  about Captain Gahagan. Gahagan enjoyed oysters, yet one could not say he
  cared for them, being a careless card; and the towers of oyster-shells before
  him showed that he had enjoyed them rapidly and recklessly, as a mere <i>hors
  d'&oelig;uvre.</i> But Mr. Pond was really caring for oysters: counting them
  like sheep and consuming them with the utmost care.</p>

  <p>"It is comparatively little known," observed Gahagan, "that Pond actually
  is an oyster. He builds up out of oysters the permanent type or image. Hasty
  naturalists (I need only name the impetuous Pilk) have repeated the report
  that he resembles a fish. But what a fish! It was left to the researches of
  Nibbles, in his epoch-making work, <i>Pondus Ostroanthropus, or The Human
  Oyster Revealed,</i> to give our friend his high and rightful rank in the
  biological order. I need not trouble you with the arguments. Pond wears a
  beard. He and the oyster alone confront the world of modern fashions with
  such a decoration. When he shuts up his head he is as close as an oyster.
  When he persuades us to swallow something, it is only afterwards (as we have
  often agreed) that we realize what a monster of the deep we have swallowed.
  But, above all, within that oyster are the paradoxes; which are pearls of
  great price." And he waved a glass towards Pond, as if concluding a speech
  and proposing a toast.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond bowed gravely and swallowed another oyster. "As a matter of fact,
  I was reminded of something relevant to the discussion by the sight of the
  oysters; or, more strictly, of the oyster-shells. This question of deporting
  dangerous characters, even when they are only suspects, has some curious and
  baffling problems. I remember one rather queer case, in which a government
  had to consider the deporting of a desirable alien&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean an undesirable alien," said Wotton.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond digested another oyster with an unobtrusive gulp and continued:
  ". . . the deporting of a desirable alien; and it found that the difficulties
  were really quite insurmountable. I assure you I am describing the peculiar
  position in perfectly appropriate terms. If any point might be questioned, it
  is not so much the word 'desirable' as the word 'alien.' In one sense, he
  might have been described as a very desirable native."</p>

  <p>"Oysters," said Gahagan mournfully. "The Mind is still brooding upon
  oysters. They are certainly very desirable natives."</p>

  <p>"If he was not desirable, he was at least desired," continued the
  unruffled Pond. "No, my dear Gahagan, when I say 'desired,' I do not mean
  'wanted by the police.' I mean that nearly everybody wanted him to stay, and
  that was why it seemed obvious that he must go. He was something which,
  without profanity, I trust, I might call the desire of all nations; or what
  poets have described as the world's desire. And yet he was not deported.
  Although he was desired, he was not deported. That is the only real
  paradox."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the staring Wotton. "So that's the real paradox."</p>

  <p>"You should remember something of the case, Wotton," went on Mr. Pond. "It
  was about that time when we went over to Paris together about a rather
  delicate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pond in Paris," murmured Gahagan. "Pond in his Pagan Youth, when (as
  Swinburne says so beautifully) 'Love was the pearl of his oyster and Venus
  rose red out of wine.'"</p>

  <p>"Paris is on the way to many capitals," replied Pond with diplomatic
  reserve. "In any case, there is no need to define the precise scene of this
  little international problem. Suffice it to say that it was one of those many
  modern States in which a Republic, resting on representative and democratic
  claims, has now long replaced a Monarchy which disappeared somehow amid all
  the modern wars and revolutions. Like many such, it did not find all its
  troubles were over with the establishment of political equality; in face of a
  world deeply disturbed about economic equality. When I went there, a strike
  in the transport services had brought the life of the capital to a deadlock;
  the Government was accused of being under the influence of a millionaire
  named Kramp, who controlled the lines involved; and the crisis was the more
  alarming because it was insisted (on the Government side) that the strike was
  secretly engineered by the famous terrorist, Tarnowski, sometimes called the
  Tiger of Tartary, who having been exiled from his own part of Eastern Europe,
  was believed to be spreading conspiracies from some unknown hiding-place in
  the West." Mr. Pond then proceeded to narrate his little experience, which,
  when purged of Gahagan's interruptions and Pond's somewhat needless
  exactitudes, was substantially this.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Pond was rather lonely in this strange capital; for Wotton
  had gone elsewhere on the other delicate mission; and, having no friends,
  Pond picked up only a few acquaintances. But he picked up at least three
  acquaintances who turned out to be rather interesting in various ways. The
  first case was commonplace enough, it might seem; consisting merely of
  talking to a bookseller who was otherwise a fairly ordinary shopkeeper, but
  well acquainted with early eighteenth-century scientific books; and the
  period was a hobby with Pond. Otherwise Mr. Huss was highly <i>bourgeois,</i>
  with a heavy frockcoat and long, antiquated whiskers which met under his chin
  in a patriarchal beard. When he went outside his shop, which was not often,
  he wore a funereal chimney-pot hat. Scientific studies seemed to have left in
  him the sort of stagnant atheism that is at once respectable and depressing;
  but beyond that there was nothing to distinguish him from countless
  Continental shopkeepers. The next man with whom Pond fell into any sort of
  conversation, in a café, was much more vigorous and vigilant, and belonged to
  a younger world. But he also was very serious; a dark, strenuous young man
  who was a Government official actually believing in the Government; or at
  least in the principles of the Government; and he was the sort of man who
  thinks first about principles. He denounced the strike and even the trade
  union; not because he was a snob, for he lived as simply as a workman; but
  because he really did believe in the old individualistic theory of what he
  called free contract. The type is almost unknown in England; the theory is
  more common in America. But nobody who looked at the baldish, rather
  corrugated brow that bulged between the streaks of black hair, and the
  anxious, though angry, eyes, could doubt that he was in fanatical good faith.
  His name was Marcus, and he held a minor Government office, in which he could
  survey with satisfaction the principles of the Republic, without being
  admitted to its counsels. It was while talking outside a café with this
  second acquaintance, that Mr. Pond became conscious of the third, who was by
  far the most extraordinary of the three.</p>

  <p>This man was a sort of magnet for the human eye; Pond soon realized that
  this was true of everybody's eyes and not merely his own. One way or another,
  a current of communications seemed to be always circling round the little
  table where the man sat smoking a cigarette and sipping black coffee and
  benedictine. At the moment when Pond first saw him, a group of young men was
  breaking up after some tangle of talk and laughter; they seemed to have
  stopped by the table merely for the sake of the talk. The next moment a
  string of gutter-children invaded his solitude and received the pieces of
  sugar not used for his coffee; then a hulking and rather sulky-looking
  labourer came up and talked to him, for a much longer time than any of the
  others. Strangest of all, a lady, of the stiff aristocratic sort seldom seen
  outside the house in such countries, actually got out of a carriage and stood
  staring at the strange gentleman; and then got into the carriage again. These
  things alone might have led Pond to look at the person in question; but in
  fact, for some reason or other, he had looked at him with great curiosity
  from the first.</p>

  <p>The man wore a wide white hat and a rather shabby dark blue suit; he had a
  high-bridged nose and a pale yellow beard brushed to a point. He had long,
  bony, but elegant, hands, on one of which was a ring with a stone coloured
  like a kingfisher, the only spot of luxury on what was otherwise a rather
  threadbare appearance; and in the grey shadow of the white hat his eyes shone
  as blue as the stone. There was nothing in his position that claimed
  prominence; he did not sit in the front but up against the wall of the café,
  just under a creeper and a fire-escape. Despite the little crowds that
  clustered round him, he had in the intervals an odd air of preferring to be
  alone. Pond made many inquiries, then and afterwards, about his name; but
  learnt nothing except that he was commonly called M. Louis; but whether that
  was his real surname, or perhaps the adaptation of some foreign surname, or
  whether his queer and eccentric popularity led everybody to use his Christian
  name, did not very clearly emerge.</p>

  <p>"Marcus," said Mr. Pond to his young companion, "who <i>is</i> this
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows him and nobody knows who he is," replied Marcus in a
  rather grating voice. "But I'm jolly well going to find out."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the hawkers of the revolutionary paper, published by the
  strikers and conspicuous by being printed on vivid scarlet paper, were
  distributing it among a considerable number of purchasers in the crowd
  outside the café; a black block thus rapidly diversified with blots of
  blood-red colour. Some, indeed, looked at the paper only to jeer at it; some
  with a colder curiosity, perhaps only a few with the respect of real
  sympathizers. Among those reading it with detachment, but not apparently with
  definite disapproval, was the gentleman with the beard and the blue ring: M.
  Louis.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Marcus, with a darkening brow. "Let them. It's their last
  chance, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" inquired Pond.</p>

  <p>The brow of Marcus became still more corrugated and troubled; at length he
  said in a gruff and rather reluctant manner: "I'm bound to say I don't
  approve of it myself. I can't see how the Republic can reconcile it with its
  liberal principles to suppress newspapers. But they're going to suppress that
  newspaper. They've been a good deal goaded. I don't believe the Prime
  Minister himself really likes the suppression; but the Minister of the
  Interior is a fiery little devil and generally gets his own way. Anyhow,
  they're going to raid the offices with police to-morrow; and that's probably
  the last issue."</p>

  <p>M. Marcus proved himself a true prophet, so far as concerned the general
  situation next morning.</p>

  <p>There had apparently been another issue; but if it had ever been displayed
  it had not been successfully distributed; the police had seized all copies of
  it everywhere; and the black-clad <i>bourgeoisie</i> sitting outside the café
  were now blameless and unspotted with any hues of blood; save in one corner
  under the fire-escape and the creeper, where M. Louis was reading his copy of
  the sanguinary sheet in complete indifference to the change. Some of those
  around him eyed him slightly askance; and Pond specially noticed Mr. Huss,
  the bookseller, complete with black top-hat and white whiskers, seated at a
  table close by and eyeing the reader of the red paper with bristling
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>Marcus and Pond took their seats at their own original table; and even as
  they did so, a contingent of police came by, marching very rapidly, cleaning
  up the streets. There marched with them, with yet more furious rapidity, a
  squat, square man with arrogant moustaches, wearing an official decoration
  and flourishing an umbrella like a sabre. This was the eminent and highly
  militant Dr. Koch, the Minister of the Interior; he had been presiding over
  the police raid, and his rolling eye instantly spotted the one red spot in
  the corner of the crowded café. He planted himself before M. Louis; and
  shouted as if on parade:</p>

  <p>"You are forbidden to read that paper. It contains direct incitement to
  crime."</p>

  <p>"And how," asked M. Louis courteously, "and how can I discover this
  deplorable fact except by reading it?"</p>

  <p>Something in that polite tone seemed, for some odd reason, to cause the
  Minister of the Interior to fly, as the phrase goes, right off the handle.
  Pointing his umbrella at the man in the café, he vociferated with a violent
  distinctness:</p>

  <p>"You could be arrested, you could be deported; and you know why. Not for
  all that bloody nonsense. You don't need that scrap of a scarlet rag to mark
  you out among decent citizens."</p>

  <p>"Because my own sins are as scarlet," said the other, gently inclining his
  head, "the scandal of my presence here is indeed highly scandalous. And why
  don't you arrest me?"</p>

  <p>"You wait and see whether we arrest you," said the Minister grinding his
  teeth. "Anyhow, you shan't arrest us or hold up the whole machinery of
  society by a trick like this. Do you think we will let that sort of dirty
  little red rusty nail in the road stop all the wheels of progress?"</p>

  <p>"And do you think," answered the other sternly, "that all the wheels of
  your sort of progress have ever done anything yet but grind the faces of the
  poor? No; I have not the honour of being one of the citizens of your State;
  one of those happy, joyful, well-fed, wealthy citizens one sees standing
  about in the street, on whom you wage war by hunger. But I am not a subject
  of any foreign State; and you will have quite a peculiar difficulty in
  deporting me back to my own country."</p>

  <p>The Minister took one furious step forward; and then stopped. Then he
  walked off twirling his moustaches, as if suddenly forgetting the very
  existence of the other; and followed in the track of the police.</p>

  <p>"There seem to be a number of mysteries here," said Mr. Pond to his
  friend. "First, why should he be deported? Second, why shouldn't he be
  deported?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Marcus, and stood up stiff and frowning.</p>

  <p>"All the same," said Mr. Pond, "I am beginning to have a sort of fancy
  about who he is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marcus grimly, "and I'm beginning to have a fancy about what
  he is. Not a nice fancy." And he strode abruptly away from the table and up
  the street alone.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond remained seated in a condition of profound thought. After some
  minutes he rose and made his way towards the table where his friend the
  bookseller, the excellent Huss, was still seated in somewhat darkling
  majesty.</p>

  <p>Even as he crossed the crowded <i>trottoir,</i> a roar broke from the
  street behind him, which was filling with twilight; and he realized that the
  great grey crowd of the strikers was on the march past, following the same
  route as the police who had just cleared out their offices. But the cause of
  the cry was more particular and even personal. The sardonic eyes of the
  semi-starving mob had swept the whole dark and decorous crowd of respectable
  people outside the café, and marked the absence of their proscribed paper;
  then they had suddenly perceived the familiar red flare of its fluttering
  pages in the hands of M. Louis, who was continuing to read it with unaltered
  calm. All the strikers stood still, halting and saluting like an army; and a
  great shout, seeming to shake the lamp-posts and little trees, went up for
  the one man who remained faithful to the red rag. M. Louis rose and gravely
  bowed to the applauding mob. Mr. Pond sat down opposite his friend the
  bookseller and scrutinized his whiskered face with interest.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pond, "our friend over there looks as if he might soon be
  the leader of the revolutionary party."</p>

  <p>This remark had a rather strange effect on Mr. Huss; he started as in
  disorder by saying: "No, no"; controlled his countenance, and then enunciated
  a number of short sentences with an extraordinary exactitude.</p>

  <p>"Myself of the <i>bourgeoisie,</i> I have yet remained apart from
  politics. I have taken no part in any class-war proceeding under present
  conditions. I have no reason to identify myself either with the protest of
  the proletariat or with the present phase of capitalism."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Pond; and an understanding began to dawn in his eyes. After
  a moment he said: "I apologize most sincerely, old man. I didn't know you
  were a Communist."</p>

  <p>"I have confessed to nothing of the sort," said Huss heatedly; then he
  added abruptly: "You will say somebody has betrayed me."</p>

  <p>"Your speech betrays you, like the Galilean," said Pond. "Every sect talks
  its own language. You could tell a man was a Buddhist from his way of saying
  he was not a Buddhist. It's no business of mine; and I won't mention it to a
  soul, if you prefer not. I only ventured to say that the man over there seems
  to be very popular with the strikers, and might lead the movement."</p>

  <p>"No, no, no," cried Huss, beating on the table with his two fists. "Never,
  never, shall he lead the movement! Understand me! We are a scientific
  movement. We are not moral. We have done with <i>bourgeois</i> ideologies of
  right and wrong. We are <i>Realpolitik.</i> What helps the program of Marx is
  alone good. What hinders the program of Marx is alone evil. But there are
  limits. There are names so infamous, there are persons so infamous, that they
  must always be excluded from the Party."</p>

  <p>"You mean somebody is so wicked that he has awakened a dormant moral sense
  even in a Bolshevist bookseller," said Pond. "Why, what has he done?"</p>

  <p>"It is not only what he does but what he is," said Mr. Huss.</p>

  <p>"Curious that you should say that," said Pond. "For I have just made a
  sort of a guess about what he is."</p>

  <p>He took a newspaper-cutting from his waistcoat pocket and pushed it across
  to the other, remarking casually: "You will note that Tarnowski the Terrorist
  is now said to be fomenting strikes and revolutions not only in this country
  but definitely in this capital. Well, our friend in the white hat seems to me
  to be rather an old hand."</p>

  <p>Huss was still drumming faintly on the table and obscurely muttering:
  "Never, never, shall he be the leader."</p>

  <p>"But suppose he is the leader?" said Pond. "He obviously has a sort of
  habit of old leadership about him; a sort of gesture of authority. Isn't he
  going on exactly as Tarnowski the Tiger probably would go on?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond may have expected to surprise the bookseller; but it was Mr. Pond
  who got the surprise. The effect on the bookseller was such that surprise
  would be a comically inadequate description. Mr. Huss stiffened and sat as
  still as a stone idol; but the change in the face of the graven image was
  appalling. It suggested some nightmare story of a man at a solitary table
  finding he was dining with a devil.</p>

  <p>"My God," said the atheist at last, in a small, weak rather squeaky voice,
  "and so you think <i>he</i> is Tarnowski!" And with that, the bookseller in
  the top-hat suddenly went off into hoots of hollow laughter, like the dismal
  noises of an owl, shrill and monotonous and apparently to be repeated
  indefinitely without control.</p>

  <p>"Well," interrupted Pond, mildly exasperated, "how can you possibly know
  that he is not Tarnowski?"</p>

  <p>"Only because I am Tarnowski," said the bookseller, with sudden sobriety.
  "You say you are not a spy. But you can betray me if you choose."</p>

  <p>"I assure Your Excellency," said Mr. Pond, "that I am not a spy or even,
  what is worse, a gossip. I am only a tourist who is not talkative and a
  traveller who tells no traveller's tales. Besides, I owe a debt to Your
  Excellency, for having illuminated my mind with an important principle. I
  never saw it so clearly before. A man always says exactly what he means; but
  especially when he hides it."</p>

  <p>"That," observed the other with guttural slowness, "is what I think you
  call a paradox."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say that," groaned Mr. Pond. "Everybody in England says that.
  And I have honestly no notion of what it means."</p><br>

  <p class="first">"But in that case," said Mr. Pond to himself, "who on earth
  <i>is</i> the man in the white hat? What crime has he committed? What crime
  is it for which he can be arrested or deported? Or again, what crime is it
  for which he <i>can't</i> be arrested or deported?"</p>

  <p>It was in a burst of splendid sunshine, on the following morning, that
  Pond sat at his little table in the café ruminating on the renewed
  difficulties of the problem. The sun gave a sort of golden gaiety to a scene
  that had lately looked rather sombre, and even black, bloodshot with the
  glimpses of the Bolshevist journal. In the social sense at least, there
  seemed to be a clearance in the storm, of the strikers if not the strike; the
  threat of riots had been outman&oelig;uvred; and the police were picketed at
  intervals down the street; but seemed in the tranquil sunshine as harmless as
  the toy trees and the painted lamp-posts. Mr. Pond felt an irrational return
  of that vague exhilaration which an Englishman sometimes feels in the mere
  fact of being abroad; the smell of the French coffee affected him as some are
  affected by the smell of hayfields or the sea. M. Louis had resumed his
  amiable hobby of distributing sugar to the <i>gamins;</i> and the very shape
  of those oblong blocks of beetroot-sugar pleased Mr. Pond in the same manner.
  He had a hazy feeling that he was looking at the scene through the eyes of
  one of the children. Even the <i>gendarmes</i> posted along the pavement
  amused him in a merely nonsensical manner, as if they had been dolls or
  dummies in some delightful puppet-play; their cocked hats carrying a vague
  memory of the beadle in a Punch-and-Judy show. Through all this coloured
  comedy there advanced the rigid figure of M. Marcus, with a visage which
  announced vividly that that political Puritan did not believe in
  puppet-shows.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, glaring at Pond with a sort of controlled rage, "I fancy
  I can guess the truth about <i>him.</i>"</p>

  <p>Pond made polite inquiries; and was answered by an unexpectedly ugly and
  jeering laugh.</p>

  <p>"What sort of man is it," asked Marcus, "who is received everywhere with
  bows and smiles? Who is it to whom everybody is always so courteous and
  complimentary? What generous Friend of the People? What holy Father of the
  Poor? Deported! That sort of fellow ought to be hanged."</p>

  <p>"I fear I do not understand anything yet," answered Pond mildly, "except
  that for some reason he cannot even be deported."</p>

  <p>"Looks very patriarchal, doesn't he, sitting in the sunshine and playing
  with the children? It was darker last night and I caught him in a darker
  piece of business. . . . Listen to this, first of all. It was at the end of
  dusk, yesterday evening; and but for myself, he was alone in the café; I
  don't think he saw me; but I don't know if he would care. There drove up a
  dark, closely curtained carriage; and that lady we saw once before got out; a
  very grand lady, I am sure, though I fancy not so rich as she had been. She
  had an interview with this man, in which she actually went on her knees to
  him on the muddy pavement, begging him for something; and he only sat there
  and smiled. What sort of a man is it who sees ladies grovelling before him
  and only grins like a demon and doesn't even take off his hat? What sort of
  man is it who can play the Sultan in society and be sure that everybody will
  smile and be polite? Only the very basest sort of criminal."</p>

  <p>"In plain words," said Mr. Pond, "you mean he ought to be arrested because
  he's a blackmailer. You also mean he can't be arrested because he's a
  blackmailer."</p>

  <p>For the first time the rage of Marcus seemed mixed with a sort of
  embarrassment, almost amounting to shame, as he looked down scowling at the
  table.</p>

  <p>"It has no doubt occurred to you," proceeded Pond placidly, "that the
  second inference involves some suggestions that are rather delicate;
  especially if I may say so, for a man in your position."</p>

  <p>Marcus remained in a silence swollen with anger; then at last he broke out
  abruptly, as if beyond control: "I'll swear the Prime Minister is perfectly
  honest."</p>

  <p>"I do not think," said Mr. Pond, "that I have ever regaled you with any
  scandals about the Prime Minister."</p>

  <p>"And I can't believe the little doctor is really in it," went on Marcus
  savagely. "I've always thought it was just sincerity that made him
  spluttering and spiteful. It was just trying to be straight amid all
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All this what?" asked Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>Marcus turned in his chair with an abrupt gesture of the elbow, saying:
  "Oh, you don't understand."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," replied Pond. "I think I do understand."</p>

  <p>There was a lengthy silence and then Pond resumed:</p>

  <p>"I understand the horrid truth that you yourself are a perfectly
  honourable and high-minded person and that your own problem is extremely
  difficult to solve. I assure you that I am quite incapable of taunting you
  with it. It was to the Republic, to the idea of equality and justice, that
  you swore loyalty; and to that you have been loyal."</p>

  <p>"You had better say what you think." said Marcus gloomily. "You mean that
  I am really only serving a gang of crooks, whom any blackguard can
  blackmail."</p>

  <p>"No, I will not ask you to admit that now," answered Pond. "Just now I
  wanted to ask you quite another question. Can't you imagine a man
  sympathizing with the strikers, or even being a sincere Socialist?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Marcus, after a spasm of concentration, "I suppose one
  ought to imagine. I suppose he might hold that, the Republic resting on the
  Social Contract, it might supersede even free contracts."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Pond with satisfaction, "that is exactly what I
  wanted. It is an important contribution to Pond's Law of Paradox, if I may be
  pardoned for expressing myself so playfully. And now let us go and talk to M.
  Louis."</p>

  <p>He stood up before the astonished official, who had no apparent
  alternative but to follow him as he passed swiftly across the café. Some
  vivacious and talkative young men were taking leave of M. Louis, who
  courteously invited the newcomers to the empty chairs, saying something about
  "my young friends often enliven my solitude with their rather Socialistic
  views."</p>

  <p>"I should not agree with your young friends," said Marcus curtly, "I am so
  old-fashioned as to believe in free contract."</p>

  <p>"I, being older, perhaps believe in it even more," answered M. Louis
  smiling. "But surely it is a very old principle of law that a leonine
  contract is not a free contract. And it is hypocrisy to pretend that a
  bargain between a starving man and a man with all the food is anything but a
  leonine contract." He glanced up at the fire-escape, a ladder leading up to
  the balcony of a very high attic above. "I live in that garret; or rather on
  that balcony. If I fell off the balcony and hung on a spike, so far from the
  steps that somebody with a ladder could offer to rescue me if I gave him a
  hundred million francs, I should be quite morally justified in using his
  ladder and then telling him to go to hell for his hundred million. Hell,
  indeed, is not out of the picture; for it is a sin of injustice to force an
  advantage against the desperate. Well, all those poor men are desperate; they
  all hang starving on spikes. If they must not bargain collectively, they
  cannot bargain at all. You are not supporting contract; you are opposing all
  contract; for yours cannot be a real contract at all."</p>

  <p>While the smoke of his cigarette mounted towards the balcony, Mr. Pond's
  eye followed it and found the balcony fitted out with what looked like a
  bedstead, a screen, and an old looking-glass, all very shabby. The only other
  object was a dusty old cross-hilted sword, such as might have come from a
  curiosity shop. Mr. Pond eyed this last object with considerable
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Please permit me to play the host," said M. Louis affably. "Perhaps you
  would like a cocktail or something; I stick to a little benedictine."</p>

  <p>As he turned in his chair towards the waiter, a shot rang through the café
  and the little glass before him lay in a star of splinters. The bullet that
  spilt the drink had missed the drinker by half a yard. Marcus looked wildly
  round; the café was deserted, for it was already late; no figure was in sight
  but the solid back of the <i>gendarme</i> standing outside. But Marcus went
  white with horror; for M. Louis made one quaint little gesture which, if it
  meant anything, could only mean that the policeman himself had turned for an
  instant and fired.</p>

  <p>"A little reminder, perhaps, that it is time to go to bed," said M. Louis
  gaily. "I go up by the fire-escape and I sleep on the balcony. Doctors think
  so much of this open-air treatment. Well, my people have always gone to bed
  in public; so many tramps do, don't they? Good night, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He lightly scaled the iron ladder and began on the balcony, before their
  astonished eyes, to assume a capacious dressing-gown and prepare for
  slumber.</p>

  <p>"Pond," said Marcus, "we are in a nightmare of nonsense."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Pond, "for the first time it begins to make sense. I have
  been stupid; but I am beginning at last to see what it all means." After
  ruminating a moment, he resumed rather apologetically:</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if I refer again to my foolish jest about Pond's Law. I think
  I have discovered a rather useful principle. It is this. Men may argue
  <i>for</i> principles not entirely their own, for various reasons; as a joke
  in a rag debate, or covered by professional etiquette, like a barrister, or
  merely exaggerating something neglected and needing emphasis; long before we
  come to those who do it hypocritically or for hire. A man can argue
  <i>for</i> principles not his own. But a man cannot argue <i>from</i>
  principles not his own; the first principles he assumes, even for sophistry
  or advocacy, will probably be his own fundamental first principles. The very
  language he uses will betray him. That Bolshevist bookseller professed to be
  a <i>bourgeois;</i> but he talked like a Bolshevist about a <i>bourgeois.</i>
  He talked about exploitation and the class-war. So you tried to imagine
  yourself a Socialist; but you did not talk like a Socialist. You talked about
  the Social Contract, like old Rousseau. Now our friend M. Louis was defending
  his sympathy with strikers and even Socialists. But he used the oldest and
  most traditional argument of all, older than the Roman Law. The idea about
  leonine contract is as old as Leo and a long sight older than Leo XIII.
  Therefore, he represents something even older than your Rousseau and your
  Revolution. I knew after five words that he was not the blackmailing
  blackguard of romance; and yet he is romantic. And he could be legally
  arrested; but only for a rather curious crime. And yet again, he cannot be
  arrested. He can only be assassinated.</p>

  <p>"The blackmail charge rests on one scene, in which a lady knelt to him in
  the street. You argued truly that ladies in your country think so much of
  formality and propriety, that they could never do this except in some extreme
  of agony and despair. It did not occur to you that, perhaps, it might be only
  an extreme of formality and propriety."</p>

  <p>Marcus began slowly: "What the devil&mdash;" And then Mr. Pond rapped out
  quite smartly: "And then the sword. What is a sword <i>for?</i> It's absurd
  to say for fighting; he wouldn't wave a mediæval sword against people
  shooting him with guns. If it were for duels he would have a duelling-sword;
  and probably two in a case. What else can you do with a sword? Well, you can
  swallow it; and at one time I really had a fancy he might be a conjurer. But
  it's too big a swallow; so is the notion. What <i>can</i> be done with a
  sword, but not with a spear or gun or battle-axe? Have you heard of the
  Accolade? Long ago a man could be knighted by any knight; but by all modern
  custom it can only be done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Only&mdash;" began Marcus, beginning to stare.</p>

  <p>"Only by a King," said Pond. And the young Republican sprang up rigid at
  the challenge.</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Pond, "the King has crept back among you. It is not your
  fault. Republics might be all right if Republicans were as honourable as you
  are; but you have confessed that they are not . . . and that's what he meant
  about going to bed in public. You know the old kings really did. But he had
  another reason. He had one real fear; that they might deport him secretly.
  They could deport him technically, of course; all these Republics have laws
  against Royalist claimants remaining in the realm. But if they did it
  publicly, he would proclaim himself and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why don't they do it publicly?" asked the Republican explosively.</p>

  <p>"Politicians do not understand much; but politicians do understand
  politics," said Pond pensively. "I mean they do understand the
  <i>immediate</i> effect on mobs and movements. Somehow he had slipped in and
  started a campaign of private popularity before they even knew who he was.
  When once he was popular, they were helpless. How could they say: 'Yes, he is
  popular, he is on the side of the people and the poor; the young men accept
  his leadership; but he is the King and therefore he must go'? They know how
  horribly near the world is to answering: 'Yes; he is the King and, by God, he
  shall stay.'"</p><br>

  <p class="first">Mr. Pond had told this story, at somewhat greater length but
  in far more classic diction; and by that time had actually finished the
  oysters. He gazed pensively at the shells and added: "You will of course
  recall the meaning of the word ostracism. It meant that in ancient Athens a
  man was sometimes exiled merely for being important; and the votes were
  recorded by oyster-shells. In this case he should have been exiled for being
  important; but he was so very important that nobody could be told of his
  importance."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="c06"
     id="c06">VI. &mdash; RING OF LOVERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"As I said before," observed Mr. Pond, towards the end of
one of his lucid
  but rather lengthy speeches, "our friend Gahagan here is a very truthful man
  and tells wanton and unnecessary lies. But this very truthfulness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Captain Gahagan waved a gloved hand as in courteous acknowledgement of
  anything anybody liked to say; he had an especially flamboyant flower in his
  coat and looked unusually gay. But Sir Hubert Wotton, the third party at the
  little conference, sat up. For he followed the flow of words with tireless,
  intelligent attention, while Gahagan, though radiant, seemed rather
  abstracted; and these abrupt absurdities always brought Sir Hubert up
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Say that again," he said, not without sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Surely that is obvious enough," pleaded Mr. Pond. "A real liar does not
  tell wanton and unnecessary lies. He tells wise and necessary lies. It was
  not necessary for Gahagan to tell us once that he had seen not one
  sea-serpent but six sea-serpents, each larger than the last; still less to
  inform us that each reptile in turn swallowed the last one whole; and that
  the last of all was opening its mouth to swallow the ship, when he saw it was
  only a yawn after too heavy a meal, and the monster suddenly went to sleep. I
  will not dwell on the mathematical symmetry with which snake within snake
  yawned, and snake within snake went to sleep, all except the smallest, which
  had had no dinner and walked out to look for some. It was not, I say,
  necessary for Gahagan to tell this story. It was hardly even wise. It is very
  unlikely that it would promote his worldly prospects, or gain him any rewards
  or decorations for scientific research. The official scientific world, I know
  not why, is prejudiced against any story even of one sea-serpent, and would
  be the less likely to accept the narrative in its present form.</p>

  <p>"Or again, when Captain Gahagan told us he had been a Broad Church
  missionary, and had readily preached in the pulpits of Nonconformists, then
  in the mosques of Moslems, then in the monasteries of Tibet, but was most
  warmly welcomed by a mystical sect of Theists in those parts, people in a
  state of supreme spiritual exaltation who worshipped him like a god, until he
  found they were enthusiasts for Human Sacrifice and he was the victim. This
  statement was also quite unnecessary. To have been a latitudinarian clergyman
  is but little likely to advance him in his present profession, or to fit him
  for his present pursuits. I suspect the story was partially a parable or
  allegory. But anyhow, it was quite unnecessary and it was obviously untrue.
  And when a thing is obviously untrue, it is obviously not a lie."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said Gahagan abruptly, "suppose I were to tell you a story that
  really is true?"</p>

  <p>"I should regard it with great suspicion," said Wotton grimly.</p>

  <p>"You mean you would think I was still romancing. But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it would be so very like a romance," retorted Wotton.</p>

  <p>"But don't you think," asked the Captain thoughtfully, "that real life
  sometimes is like a romance?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Wotton, with a certain genuine shrewdness that lay very
  deep in him, "that I could always really tell the difference."</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Pond; "and it seems to me the difference is this.
  Life is artistic in parts, but not as a whole; it's like broken bits of
  different works of art. When everything hangs together, and it all fits in,
  we doubt. I might even believe that Gahagan saw six sea-serpents; but not
  that each was larger than the last. If he'd said there was first a large one
  and then a little one and then a larger one, he might have taken us in. We
  often say that one social situation is like being in a novel; but it doesn't
  finish like the novel&mdash;at least, not the same novel."</p>

  <p>"Pond," said Gahagan, "I sometimes think you are inspired, or possessed of
  a devil in a quiet way. It's queer you should say that; because my experience
  was just like that. With this difference; each familiar melodrama broke off;
  but only turned to blacker melodrama&mdash;or tragedy. Again and again, in
  this affair, I thought I was in a magazine story; and then it turned to quite
  another story. Sort of dissolving view, or a nightmare. Especially a
  nightmare."</p>

  <p>"And why especially?" asked Wotton.</p>

  <p>"It's a horrible story," said Gahagan, lowering his voice. "But it's not
  so horrible now."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mr. Pond, nodding. "You are happy and wish to tell us a
  horrible story."</p>

  <p>"And what does <i>that</i> mean?" demanded Wotton.</p>

  <p>"It means," said Gahagan, "that I got engaged to be married this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"The devil you&mdash;I beg your pardon," said Wotton, very red in the
  face. "Congratulations, of course, and all that. But what has it to do with
  the nightmare?"</p>

  <p>"There is a connexion," said Gahagan dreamily. "But you want the horrible
  story and not the happy one. Well, it was a bit of a mystery, at least to me;
  but I understood it at last."</p>

  <p>"And when you've done mystifying us, you will tell us the solution?"</p>

  <p>"No; Pond will tell you the solution," said Gahagan maliciously. "He's
  already puffed up because he guessed the kind of story, before he even heard
  it. If he can't finish the story, when he has heard it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off and then resumed more solidly:</p>

  <p>"It began with a dinner-party, what they call a stag-party, given by Lord
  Crome, following on a cocktail-party mostly given by Lady Crome. Lady Crome
  was a tall and swift and graceful person with a small dark head. Lord Crome
  was quite the reverse; he was in every way, physical and mental, a
  'long-headed' person. You've heard of a hatchet-face; his was a hatchet that
  cut off his own head&mdash;or rather his own body, abolishing the slighter
  and more insignificant figure. He is an economist and he gave one the
  impression of being <i>distrait</i> and rather bored with all the ladies who
  swam about in the wake of his wonderful wife, that darting swan; and perhaps
  that was why he wanted the cooler society of his own sex. Anyhow, he kept
  some of his male guests for a little dinner after the at-home was over. I
  happened to be one of them; but, in spite of that, it was a select
  company.</p>

  <p>"It was a select company; and yet it hardly seemed to have been selected.
  They were mostly well-known men, and yet it looked as if Crome had taken
  their names out of a hat. The first person I ran into was Captain Blande,
  supposed to be one of the biggest officers in the British Army, and I should
  think the stupidest, for any strategic purposes. Of course he looks
  magnificent&mdash;like a chryselephantine statue of Hercules, and about as
  useful in time of war. I once used the word 'chryselephantine,' meaning gold
  and ivory; and he thought I was calling him elephantine. Classical education
  of the <i>pukka sahib.</i> Well, the man he was put next to was Count Kranz,
  the Hungarian scientist and social reformer. He speaks twenty-seven
  languages, including philosophical language. I wonder what language he talked
  to Captain Blande in. Just beyond the Count was another fellow more of
  Blande's sort; but darker and leaner and livelier; a fellow called Wooster of
  some Bengal regiment. His language also would be limited: the Latin verb
  <i>polo, polas, polat;</i> I play polo, thou playest polo, he plays polo, or
  (more devastatingly) he does not play polo. But just as polo itself was an
  Asiatic game, and can be traced through the gilded jungle of Persian and
  Indian illuminations, so there was something faintly Eurasian about this man
  Wooster; he was like a dark-striped tiger and one could fancy him gliding
  through a jungle. That pair at least looked a little more well-matched; for
  Kranz also was dark and good-looking, with arched, black, Assyrian eyebrows
  and a long, dark beard, spreading like a fan or the forked tail of a bird. I
  sat next, and got on with Wooster pretty well; on the other side of me was
  Sir Oscar Marvell, the great actor-manager, all very fine and large, with the
  Olympian curls and the Roman nose. Here also there was some lack of
  <i>rapport.</i> Sir Oscar Marvell didn't want to talk about anything but Sir
  Oscar Marvell; and the other men didn't want to talk about Sir Oscar Marvell
  at all. The three remaining men were the new Under-Secretary for Foreign
  Affairs, Pitt-Palmer, a very frigid-looking young man like the bust of
  Augustus Cæsar&mdash;and indeed <i>he</i> was classical enough, and could
  have quoted the classics all right; one Italian singer, whose name I could
  not remember, and one Polish diplomat, whose name nobody could remember. And
  I was saying to myself all the time: 'What a funny collection!'"</p>

  <p>"I know this story," said Wotton positively. "A humorous host collects a
  lot of incompatible people for the pleasure of hearing them quarrel. Done
  very well in one of Anthony Berkeley's detective stories."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Gahagan. "I think their incompatibility was quite
  accidental, and I know that Crome didn't use it to make them quarrel. As a
  matter of fact, he was a most tactful host, and it would be truer to say he
  prevented them from quarrelling. He did it rather cleverly, too, by beginning
  to talk about heirlooms and family jewels and so on. Different as they were,
  most of them were well-off, and what is called of a good family; and it was
  about as close to common ground as they could get. The Pole, who was a
  baldish but graceful person, with very charming manners, and much the
  wittiest man at table, was giving an amusing account of the adventures of a
  medal of Sobieski when it fell into the hands first of a Jew, and then of a
  Prussian, and then of a Cossack. In contrast to the Pole, who was hairless
  and talkative, the Italian beyond him was silent, and rather sulky, under his
  bush of black hair.</p>

  <p>"'That's an interesting-looking ring you are wearing yourself, Lord
  Crome,' said the Pole politely. 'Those heavy rings are generally historic. I
  think I should really like to wear an episcopal ring or, better still, a
  Papal ring. But then there are all those tiresome preliminaries about being
  made Pope; it involves celibacy; and I&mdash;' And he shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Very annoying, no doubt,' said Lord Crome, smiling at him grimly. 'As
  for this ring here&mdash;well, it is rather interesting in a way, in that
  sort of family way, of course. I don't know the details, but it is obviously
  sixteenth century. Care to look at it?' And he slipped off his finger a heavy
  ring with a red stone and passed it to the Pole, who was sitting next to him.
  It proved on examination to be set with a cluster of extremely fine rubies
  and carved with a central device of a heart inside a rose. I saw it myself,
  since it was handed round the table; and there was some lettering in old
  French which meant something like 'From the lover only and only to the
  beloved.'</p>

  <p>"'A romance in your family history, I suppose?' suggested the Hungarian
  Count. 'And about the sixteenth century. But you do not know the story?'"</p>

  <p>"'No,' said Crome, 'but I suppose it was, as you say, a romance in the
  family.'</p>

  <p>"They began talking about sixteenth-century romances, at some length; and
  at last Crome asked very courteously if everybody had seen the ring."</p>

  <p>"Oh," cried Wotton, with a deep breath, rather like a schoolboy at a
  conjurer's performance. "I know <i>this</i> story, anyhow. This is a magazine
  story, if you like! The ring wasn't returned and everybody was searched or
  somebody refused to be searched; and there was some awfully romantic reason
  for his refusing to be searched."</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Gahagan. "Right, up to a point. The ring was not
  returned. We were all searched. We all insisted on being searched. Nobody
  refused to be searched. But the ring was gone."</p>

  <p>Gahagan turned rather restlessly and threw an elbow over the back of his
  chair; after a moment he went on:</p>

  <p>"Please don't imagine I didn't feel all you say; that we seemed to have
  got inside a novel; and not a very novel sort of novel. But the difference
  was exactly what Pond says: that the novel didn't finish properly, but seemed
  to go on to something else. We had just reached about the coffee stage of the
  dinner, while this fuss about the first discovery of the loss was being
  discussed. But all the nonsense about searching was really very swift and
  simple; and the coffee hadn't even got cold in the interlude, though Crome
  offered to send for some more. We all said that of course it didn't matter;
  but Crome summoned the butler who'd been handing it round; and they whispered
  together in what was obviously a rather agitated conversation. Then, just as
  Pitt-Palmer was lifting his coffee cup to his lips, Lord Crome sprang up
  stiff and bristling and called out like the crack of a whip:</p>

  <p>"'Gentlemen, do not touch this coffee. It is poisoned.'"</p>

  <p>"But dash it all," interrupted Wotton, "that's a different story! I say,
  Gahagan, are you sure you didn't dream all this? After reading through a
  stack of out-of-date magazines and mixing up all the results? Of course we
  know the story about a whole company laid out with poison&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The results in this case were rather more extraordinary," said Gahagan
  calmly. "Most of us naturally sat like stone statues under such a
  thunder-bolt of a threat. But young Pitt-Palmer, with his cold, clean-cut,
  classical face, rose to his feet with the coffee cup in his hand and said in
  the coolest way:</p>

  <p>"'Awfully sorry; but I do hate letting my coffee get cold.'</p>

  <p>"And he drained his cup; and, as God sees me, his face turned black or a
  blend of dreadful colours; and after horrible and inhuman noises, he fell
  down as in a fit before our eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we were not certain at first. But the Hungarian scientist had
  a doctor's degree; and what he reported was confirmed by the local doctor,
  who was sent for at once. There was no doubt that he was dead."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Wotton, "that the doctors agreed that he was
  poisoned?"</p>

  <p>Gahagan shook his head and repeated: "I said they agreed that he was
  dead."</p>

  <p>"But why should he be dead unless he was poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"He was choked," said Gahagan; and for one instant a shudder caught his
  whole powerful frame.</p>

  <p>After a silence that seemed suddenly imposed by his agitation, Wotton said
  at last:</p>

  <p>"I don't understand a word you say. Who poisoned the coffee?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody poisoned the coffee; because it wasn't poisoned," answered
  Gahagan. "The only reason for saying that was to make sure the coffee should
  remain in the cup, to be analysed just as it was. Poor Pitt-Palmer had put in
  a very large lump of sugar just before; but the sugar would melt. Some things
  do not melt."</p>

  <p>Sir Hubert Wotton stared for some seconds into vacancy; and then his eyes
  began to glow with his own very real though not very rapid intelligence.</p>

  <p>"You mean," he said, "that Pitt-Palmer somehow dropped the ring into the
  black coffee, where it wouldn't be seen, before he was searched. In other
  words, Pitt-Palmer was the thief?"</p>

  <p>"Pitt-Palmer is dead," said Gahagan very gravely, "and it is the more my
  duty to defend his memory. What he did was doubtless wrong, as I have come to
  see more clearly than I did; but not worse than many a man has done. You may
  say what you like about that very common sort of wrong-doing. But he was not
  a thief."</p>

  <p>"Will you or will you not explain what all this means?" cried Wotton with
  abrupt annoyance.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Gahagan, with a sudden air of relapsing into laziness and
  fatigue. "Mr. Pond will now oblige."</p>

  <p>"Pond wasn't there, was he?" asked Wotton sharply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," answered Gahagan, rather with the air of one about to go to
  sleep. "But I can see by his eyebrows that he knows all about it. Besides,
  it's somebody else's turn."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes with so hopeless a placidity that the baffled Wotton
  was forced to turn on the third party, rather like a bewildered bull.</p>

  <p>"Do you really know anything about this?" he demanded. "What does he mean
  by saying that the man who hid the ring wasn't a thief?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I can guess a little," said Mr. Pond modestly. "But that's
  only because I've kept in mind what we said at the beginning&mdash;about the
  misleading way in which things remind us of romantic things; only they are
  never rounded off like the romance. You see, the trouble is that, when a real
  event reminds us of a novel, we unconsciously think we know all about it,
  because we know all about the novel. We have got into a groove or rut of
  familiar fiction; and we can't help thinking the groove runs forward and
  backward as it does in fiction. We've got the whole background of the story
  at the back of our minds; and we can't believe that we're really in another
  story. We always assume something that is assumed in the fictional story; and
  it isn't true. Once assume the wrong beginning, and you'll not only give the
  wrong answer but you ask the wrong question. In this case, you've got a
  mystery; but you've got hold of the wrong mystery."</p>

  <p>"Gahagan said you would explain everything," said Wotton, with controlled
  satire. "May I ask if this is the explanation? Is this the solution or the
  mystery?"</p>

  <p>"The real mystery of the ring," said Pond gravely, "is not where it went
  to, but where it came from."</p>

  <p>Wotton stared at him steadily for an instant, and then said in rather a
  new voice: "Go on."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond went on. "Gahagan has said very truly that poor Pitt-Palmer was
  not the thief. Pitt-Palmer did not steal the ring."</p>

  <p>"Then," exploded Wotton, "who the devil was it who stole the ring?"</p>

  <p>"Lord Crome stole the ring," said Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>There was a silence upon the whole group for a brief space; and then the
  somnolent Gahagan stirred and said: "I knew you would see the point."</p>

  <p>By way of making things clearer, Mr. Pond added almost apologetically:</p>

  <p>"But, you see, he had to hand it round, to find out whom he had stolen it
  from."</p>

  <p>After a moment he resumed in his usual logical but laborious manner:
  "Don't you see, as I said, you assume something at the start, simply because
  it is in all the stories? You assume that when a host hands round something
  at dinner, it's something belonging to him and his household, probably an old
  family possession; because that is in all the stories. But Lord Crome meant
  something much blacker and bitterer than that when he said, with a dreadful
  irony, that it commemorated a romance in his family.</p>

  <p>"Lord Crome had stolen that ring by intercepting correspondence; or, in
  other words, tearing open an envelope addressed to his wife and containing
  nothing but the ring. The address was typewritten; nor indeed did he know all
  the handwritings involved. But he knew the very ancient writing engraved on
  that ring; which was such that it could only have been given with one
  purpose. He assembled those men to find out who was the sender; or, in other
  words, who was the owner. He knew the owner would somehow attempt to reclaim
  his possession, if he possibly could; to stop the scandal and remove the
  evidence. And indeed the man who did so, though he might be a blackguard,
  would certainly not be a thief. As a matter of fact, after a heathen fashion,
  he was a bit of a hero. Perhaps it was not for nothing that he had that cold,
  strong face that is the stone mask of Augustus. He took, first of all, the
  simple but sensible course of slipping the ring into his black coffee, under
  cover of a gesture of taking sugar. There it would not be seen, for the
  moment, anyhow; and he could safely offer himself to be searched. That
  demented moment, which really seemed to turn the whole thing into a frightful
  dream, when Crome screamed out that the coffee was poisoned, was only Crome's
  desperate counterstroke when he had guessed the trick; to make sure that the
  coffee should be left alone and the ring recovered. But that young man with
  the cold face preferred to die in that dreadful fashion: by swallowing the
  heavy ring and choking; on the chance that his secret, or rather Lady Crome's
  secret, might yet be overlooked. It was a desperate chance, anyway; but of
  all the courses open to him, that being his object, it was probably the best
  he could have taken. In any case, I feel that we must all support Gahagan in
  saying, very properly, that the poor fellow's memory should be protected from
  any baser suggestions, and that a gentleman is certainly not a robber when he
  prefers to choke himself with his own ring."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond coughed delicately, having brought his argument to a close; and
  Sir Hubert Wotton remained staring at him, rather more bewildered by the
  solution than by the problem. When he rose slowly to his feet, it was with
  the air of one shaking off something that was still an evil dream, even when
  he knew that it had happened.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got to be going, anyhow," he said, with an air of heavy
  relief. "Got to look in at Whitehall and I fancy I'm late already. By the
  way, if what you say is true, this must have happened very lately. So far as
  I know, the news of Pitt-Palmer's suicide hasn't come through yet&mdash;at
  least it hadn't come through this morning."</p>

  <p>"It happened last night," said Gahagan, and rose from the chair where he
  had been sprawling, to take leave of his friend.</p><br>

  <p class="first">When Wotton had departed, a long silence fell upon the two
  other friends who remained looking gravely at each other.</p>

  <p>"It happened last night," repeated Gahagan. "That is why I told you it had
  something to do with what happened this morning. I got engaged to Joan Varney
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Pond gently. "I think I understand."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you do," said Gahagan, "but I am going to try to explain,
  for all that. Do you know there was one thing almost more awful than that
  poor fellow's death? And it only hit me when I was half a mile from that
  accursed house. I knew why I had been one of the guests."</p>

  <p>He was standing and staring out of the window, with his broad back turned
  to Pond; and after the last words he was silent and continued to stare at the
  stormy landscape outside. Perhaps something in it stirred another memory, for
  when he spoke again, it was as if he started a new subject, though it was
  another aspect of the same one.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell you anything much about the sort of garden party, with
  cocktails, that they had that afternoon before the dinner, because I felt
  that until one realized the climax, one couldn't realize anything; it would
  all sound like vapouring about the weather. But it was rather rum sort of
  weather yesterday, as it still is; only it was stormier, and I think the
  storm has passed over now. And it was a rum sort of atmosphere, too; though
  the weather was only a coincidence, of course, it does sometimes happen that
  meteorological conditions make men more conscious of moral conditions. There
  was a queer, lurid sort of sky over the garden, though there was a fair
  amount of fitful sunshine almost as capricious as lightning. A huge great
  mountain of cloud, coloured like ink and indigo, was coming up behind the
  pale, pillared façade of the house, which was still in a wan flush of light;
  and I remember even then being chilled by a childish fancy that Pitt-Palmer
  was a pale marble statue and part of the building. But there was little else
  to give any hint of the secret; nobody could say that Lady Crome was like a
  statue; for she went flying and flaunting about like a bird of paradise. But,
  whether you believe it or not, I did from the first feel an oppression, both
  physical and psychical; especially psychical. It increased when we went
  indoors and the dining-room curtains cut us off from any actual sight of the
  storm. They were old-fashioned, dark-red curtains, with heavy, gilded
  tassels; and it was as if everything was steeped in the same dye. You've
  heard of a man seeing red; well, what I saw was dark red. That's as near as I
  can get to the feeling; for it was a feeling from the first; and I guessed
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"And then that sinister and revolting thing happened before my eyes at the
  table; I can see the dark red wine in the port decanters and the dull glow of
  the lampshades. And still it seemed as if I were invisible and impersonal; I
  was hardly conscious of myself. Of course, we all had to answer some
  questions about ourselves; but I need not tell you about the trail of
  official fussing that crossed the track of the tragedy. It did not take long,
  since it was so obviously a case of suicide; and the party broke up,
  straggling out into the stormy night through the garden. As they passed out,
  they seemed to have taken on new shapes, new outlines. Between the hot night
  and the horrible death and that foul fog of throttling hatred in which we had
  tried to breathe, I began to see something else about them; perhaps to see
  them as they were. They were no longer incongruous but grotesquely congruous;
  as in a hideous <i>camaraderie.</i> Of course, this was a mood, and a morbid
  one; they really had been different enough; but they had something in
  common.</p>

  <p>"I liked the Pole best; he had a sense of humour, and admirable manners;
  but I knew what he meant when he so courteously declined the position of
  Pope, because it would involve celibacy. Crome knew it too, and grinned back
  at him like a demon. The other one I liked was Major Wooster, the
  Anglo-Indian; but something told me that he was really of the jungle; a
  <i>shikar</i> not only hunting tigers, a tiger not only hunting deer. Then
  there was the titled doctor with the Assyrian brows and beard; I bet he was
  more Semitic than Magyar. But anyhow, he had thick lips in his thick beard,
  and a look in his almond eyes that I did not like at all. One of the worst of
  them, I should say. I wouldn't say anything worse of Blande than that he's
  probably too stupid to understand anything but his own body. He hasn't enough
  mind to know that he has a mind. We all know Sir Oscar Marvell; I remember
  him marching out, his furred cloak flapping as if it trailed behind in
  infinite echoes of the harmless applause of flappers&mdash;but of more
  foolish women as well. As to the Italian tenor, he was uncommonly like the
  English actor. One could not say any worse of him than that.</p>

  <p>"Yes; they were, after all, a very select company. They were selected by a
  clever if nearly crazy man as being the six men in London most likely to lay
  a plot to seduce his wife. Then, with a great shock, I quite literally came
  to myself. I actually realized my own presence. I was there, too. Crome had
  made up a choice party of profligates and picked them carefully. And he had
  honoured <i>me</i> with an invitation to the feast.</p>

  <p>"That was what I was. That, at least, was what I was supposed to be. A
  damned dandy and dawdling blackguard, always dangling after other men's
  wives. . . . You know, Pond, that I was not really so bad as all that; but
  then, perhaps, neither were they. We were all innocent in this case; and yet
  the thundercloud upon the garden rested on us like a judgment. So was I
  innocent, in that case you remember, when I nearly got hanged for hanging
  round a woman I really didn't care about. But it served us right; it was our
  atmosphere that was all wrong&mdash;what quaint old people used to call the
  state of our souls, what the unspeakable bounders in the papers call
  sex-appeal. That was why I nearly got hanged; and why there was a corpse in
  the house behind me. And there went through my head like the tramp of armies,
  old lines written long ago, about what is in legend the noblest of all
  lawless loves, when Guinevere, refusing Lancelot at the last, says in words
  that had for me a ring of iron:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <blockquote>
    "For well ye wot that of this life<br>
    There comes but lewd and bitter strife<br>
    And death of men and great travail.
  </blockquote>

  <p> </p>

  <p>"I had hung round all that sort of thing, and yet never quite clearly seen
  myself doing it; till two judgments struck me like the storm out of the sky.
  I nearly received a sentence from a judge in a black cap and blood-red robes,
  that I should be hanged by the neck until I was dead. And, worse still, I
  received an invitation from Lord Crome."</p>

  <p>He continued to gaze out of the window; but Pond heard him mutter again,
  like the faint grumbling of the thunder: <i>"And death of men and great
  travail."</i></p>

  <p>In the vast silence that followed, Mr. Pond said in a very small
  voice:</p>

  <p>"What was the matter with you was that you liked being libelled."</p>

  <p>Gahagan faced about, almost with the gesture of throwing up his hands,
  which seemed to fill the frame of the window with his own gigantic frame; but
  he was noticeably pale.</p>

  <p><i>"Kamerad,</i> yes," he said. "I was as small as that."</p>

  <p>He smiled at his friend, but with a glassy and rather ghastly smile, and
  then went on:</p>

  <p>"Yes; I cared more for that dirty rag of vanity, worse than any vice, than
  I did for any vices. How many men have sold their souls to be admired by
  fools? I nearly did it, merely to be suspected by fools. To be the dangerous
  man, the dark horse, the man of whom families should be afraid&mdash;that is
  the sort of abject ambition for which I wasted so much of my life, and nearly
  lost the fulfilment of my love. I dawdled, I lounged about, because I could
  not give up a bad name. And, by God, it nearly hanged the dog."</p>

  <p>"That is what I supposed," said Mr. Pond in his most prime and polite
  manner. And then Gahagan broke out again:</p>

  <p>"I was better than I seemed. But what did that mean, except the spiritual
  blasphemy that I wanted to seem worse than I was? What could it mean, except
  that, far worse than one who practised vice, I admired it? Yes, admired it in
  myself; even when it wasn't there. I was the new hypocrite; but mine was the
  homage that virtue pays to vice."</p>

  <p>"I understand, however," said Mr. Pond, in that curiously cold and distant
  tone, which had yet a very soothing effect on everybody, "that you are now
  effectually cured."</p>

  <p>"I am cured," said Gahagan grimly. "But it took two dead men and a gallows
  to cure me. But the point is, what was I cured of? You have diagnosed it
  exactly right, my dear doctor, if I may call you so. I could not give up the
  secret pleasure of being slandered."</p>

  <p>"By this time, however," said Mr. Pond, "other considerations have come in
  and induced you to support the insupportable charge of virtue."</p>

  <p>Gahagan suddenly laughed, harshly and yet, somehow, heartily. Some would
  count his first comment a peculiar extension of the laugh. "I went to
  confession and the rest of it this morning," he said, "and in a vaguer sort
  of way I've come to confession to you. To confess that I didn't kill the man.
  To confess that I never made love to the man's wife. In short, to confess
  that I was a humbug. To confess that I am not a dangerous man . . . well,
  anyhow, after I'd done all that, I went on whistling, and as happy as a bird,
  to&mdash;well, I think you know where I went to. There's a girl I ought to
  have fixed things up with long ago; and I always wanted to do it; that's the
  paradox. But a damned sight sillier paradox than any of your paradoxes,
  Pond."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond laughed gently, as he generally did when somebody had told him,
  at considerable length, all that he knew already. And he was not so old, nor
  despite his manner so cold, as not to form some sort of guess about the
  actual termination of the rather exasperating romance of Captain
  Gahagan.</p><br>

  <p class="first">This story started with some statements about the way in
  which stories tend to get into a tangle, one tale being mixed up with another
  tale, especially when they are true tales. This story also started, and ought
  also presumably to stop, with the very extraordinary tragedy and scandal in
  the house of Lord Crome, when that promising young politician, Mr.
  Pitt-Palmer, unaccountably tumbled down dead. It ought really to end with a
  proper account of his impressive public funeral; of the chorus of praise
  devoted to him in the Press; and the stately compliments laid on his tomb
  like flowers from the leaders of all the parties in Parliament; from those
  eloquent words of the Leader of the Opposition beginning "Much as we may have
  differed in politics," to those (if possible) still more eloquent
  observations of the Leader of the House, beginning "Confident as I am that
  our cause is independent even of the noblest personality, I yet have to
  lament, etc."</p>

  <p>Anyhow, it is really very irrelevant to the central plot of this story
  that it should stray from the funeral of Pitt-Palmer to the wedding of
  Gahagan. It will be enough to say that, as already hinted, the actual effect
  of this shocking incident on Gahagan was to drive him back to an old love; an
  old love who was still conveniently young. A certain Miss Violet Varney was
  at that time prominent on the stage; the word "prominent" has been selected
  with some care from other possible adjectives. In the general view of
  society, Miss Joan Varney was the sister of Miss Violet Varney. In the
  perverse and personal view of Captain Gahagan, Miss Violet Varney was the
  sister of Miss Joan Varney; nor was he eager to insist on this relationship.
  He loved Joan but he did not even like Violet; but there is no need to enter
  on the entanglements of that other story here. Are not all these things
  written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p>

  <p>It is enough to say that on that particular morning, swept clear and
  shining after the storm, Captain Gahagan came out of the church in the little
  by-street and very cheerfully took the road to the house of the Varney
  family, where he found Miss Joan Varney pottering about in the garden with a
  spud, and told her several things of some importance to both of them. When
  Miss Violet Varney heard that her younger sister was engaged to Captain
  Gahagan, she went off with admirable promptitude to a theatrical club and got
  engaged to one of the numerous noodles of more or less noble birth who could
  be used for the purpose. She very sensibly broke off this engagement about a
  month afterwards; but she got <i>her</i> engagement into the society papers
  first.</p>

  <h2><a name="c07"
     id="c07">VII. &mdash; THE TERRIBLE TROUBADOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"In nature you must go very low to find things that go so
high."</p>

  <p>This was commonly included by collectors among the Paradoxes of Mr. Pond;
  for it came towards the end of a rather dull and eminently sensible
  discourse, and it made no sense. And these were recognized as the stigmata of
  the stylistic methods of Mr. Pond. But in this case, as a fact, he had
  plagiarized from his old acquaintance Dr. Paul Green, author of <i>The Dog or
  the Monkey, Studies in the Domestication of Anthropoids, Notes on Neanderthal
  Development,</i> etc., etc.</p>

  <p>Dr. Paul Green was a smallish man, pale, slender and slightly lame; but
  his activity, even in bodily movement, was relatively remarkable, and his
  mind moved as quickly as a quick-firing gun.</p>

  <p>It was this old acquaintance who, on one sunny afternoon, came out of Mr.
  Pond's past to bring him shocking and even nerve-shattering news; a report as
  alarming as the report of a gun.</p>

  <p>But when Mr. Pond was told, on such very solid authority, that his friend
  Captain Gahagan was an escaped murderer, after all, he said, "Tut, tut." He
  was given to what is called understatement; of which he knew the Greek name,
  but did not employ it needlessly. The conversation, indeed, had opened
  casually enough, turning from the doctor's health to the doctor's hobby of
  studying animal habits. A little light talk about Eohippus; some airy
  badinage about Homo Kanensis; a little bright back-chat about Vialleton's
  <i>Études sur les Reflexes des Animaux Tétrapodes;</i> rising to a certain
  sharpness of dialogue, for on this point of Darwin and Natural Selection the
  two friends had never agreed.</p>

  <p>"I never can see," said Mr. Pond, "how a change, that might have helped an
  animal if it came quickly, could have helped him if it came slowly. And came
  to his great-grandchild, long after he ought to have perished without leaving
  any grandchildren. It might be better if I had three legs, say, in order to
  stand firmly on two while kicking a fellow bureaucrat with the third. It
  might be better if I had three legs; but it wouldn't be better if I only had
  a rudimentary leg."</p>

  <p>"It might be better if I had two legs," said the doctor grimly, "instead
  of one lame leg that is hardly a leg at all. And yet I find it fairly
  useful."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond, who was commonly very tactful, chid himself softly for
  tactlessness in forgetting that his old acquaintance was lame. But, at least,
  he was far too tactful to apologize, or even too obviously to change the
  subject.</p>

  <p>He proceeded in his mild and fluent way: "I mean that till a leg is long
  enough to run or climb, it would only be an extra weight for the runner or
  climber to carry."</p>

  <p>"It's pretty queer," said the doctor, "that we should have started off
  talking about running and climbing. I didn't come here to discuss Darwinism
  or anything half so sane and sensible. But if you think I'm suspect, as the
  atrocious atheist, I may explain that I don't want you just now to listen to
  me, but to my friend the vicar of Hanging Burgess, the Reverend Cyprian
  Whiteways, whose views are probably quite as anti-scientific as your own. I
  don't suppose he's a Darwinian; but, anyhow, I promised to introduce him to
  you, and he wants to tell you about things that happened rather later than
  the later Stone Age."</p>

  <p>"Then, what do you mean," asked Pond, "by talking about running and
  climbing?"</p>

  <p>"I meant, I am sorry to say," replied Dr. Green, "that the vicar has a
  pretty bad story about that friend of yours, Captain Gahagan, whose legs seem
  to be very good at climbing, and still better at running away."</p>

  <p>"It's a serious thing," said Pond, gravely, "to accuse a soldier of
  running away."</p>

  <p>"It's a much more serious thing of which the vicar accuses him," said
  Green. "He accuses him of climbing a balcony and shooting a rival, and then
  running away. But it's not my story; I'm not the story, but only the
  introduction."</p>

  <p>"Climbing a balcony," mused Mr. Pond; "for a vicar it sounds rather a
  romantic story."</p>

  <p>"I know," said the doctor, "the sort of story that begins with a
  rope-ladder and ends with a rope."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond, as he heard the unequal step of his lame friend echoing away
  down the paved paths of the garden, relapsed into a gloomy mood. He was quite
  willing to accept his medical friend merely as a letter of introduction. But
  it was a rather black-edged and tragic sort of letter of introduction.
  Whatever story the Rev. Cyprian was going to tell, it was another story
  against his unfortunate friend Peter Gahagan. And Gahagan was so very
  unfortunate as to suggest to some a wild doubt about whether he was merely
  unfortunate. Some had the sudden and horrible thought that, perhaps, he was
  fortunate. Twice before, he had been mixed up in matters involving a
  mysterious and violent death; with, at least, a savour of murder. In both
  cases he had been cleared. But three is an unlucky number.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Rev. Cyprian Whiteways was a shock; a shock because of his
  frankness and fair-mindedness.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond would never, at any time, have stooped to the stupid idea that
  clergymen are stupid. He did not take his ideas of real life from farces like
  <i>The Private Secretary.</i> But the Rev. Cyprian was so very much the
  reverse of stupid; a man with a rugged face like old red sandstone; and,
  indeed, he suggested a rock of that rich colouring which glows with the past;
  he carried his English countryside with him in an indescribable suggestion of
  depth and background; he could not talk of common things without, somehow,
  suggesting the weather or the turn of night or day; he was a born descriptive
  writer who only talked. But nobody could doubt that it was truth; or, at
  least, truthfulness.</p>

  <p>It was so substantial a witness who told Mr. Pond in considerable detail
  the black and bloody story of Gahagan's hidden sin. And the curious effect of
  all this on Mr. Pond was to make him jump up briskly with a broad smile of
  relief on his bearded and somewhat owlish visage; declaring with unusual
  cheeriness that it was quite all right, they had only to ask Gahagan himself,
  and he would tell them all about it. Confrontation, it was sometimes
  called.</p><br>

  <p class="first">As for Dr. Green, with the letter of introduction, his job
  was done, and he was somewhat impatient of Pond's formalities; he stumped
  off, merely warning the vicar that he had better have a lawyer, if he was to
  confront that plausible Irish rogue.</p>

  <p>So, when the scientist was already far away, reabsorbed in the study of a
  pithecanthropos as a pet, all that remained of his intervention was a
  solicitor named Luke Little, very much on the spot.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond's friend, Sir Hubert Wotton, the well-known diplomatist, took the
  chair; but Mr. Little did not mind who took chairs so long as he took
  charge.</p>

  <p>"This is a very irregular inquiry, gentlemen," he said. "Only a special
  assurance would have induced me to place my client's case before it. Sir
  Hubert and Mr. Pond declare, I understand, that an explanation will be
  demanded here and now."</p>

  <p>Then he added: "It is a painful matter, as I think Mr. Pond will
  agree."</p>

  <p>"It is a very painful matter, indeed," replied Pond, gravely, "that an old
  friend of mine should be under suspicion of a horrible action."</p>

  <p>His friend, Wotton, looked at Pond for a moment with a frosty stare of
  surprise; but he stared a great deal more when he was startled by Gahagan
  himself, speaking, suddenly, for the first and last time in all the first
  hours of the interview.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, with a grim and inscrutable visage. "It is certainly a
  horrible story."</p>

  <p>"In any case, then," resumed the lawyer, "I can now ask my client, without
  prejudice, to repeat the story."</p>

  <p>"It's an ugly story," said the clergyman in his honest way, "and I'll tell
  it as shortly as I can."</p>

  <p>Pond had heard the story, already, told in a way at once looser and more
  elaborate, and allowing of more descriptive detail or inference than the
  statement made under such very legal supervision. But even as he heard it
  again in more exact form, he could not get rid of a feeling that the scene
  described was unnaturally vivid to him, but with the vividness of a
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>There was no particular reason, at that stage, for comparing the story to
  a nightmare; except that the two principal incidents happened at night.</p>

  <p>They happened in the vicar's garden, close to the balcony of the vicar's
  house; and perhaps the impression, which was rather like an oppression, was
  somehow connected with another night darkening the night; a living night of
  vegetation; for it was suggested, throughout, that the balcony was loaded
  with pots and palms and clutched by climbing plants with heavy and pendent
  leaves.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, after all, it was only some vague, verbal association with the
  name of Hanging Burgess; as if the mystery were somehow associated with the
  hanging gardens of Babylon. Perhaps, again, it was partly the irrational
  trail of the talk with Dr. Green, with his creed of blind growth and a
  groping life-force in a godless dark; for Green developed his view of
  development with every fancy from botany as well as biology.</p>

  <p>On the whole, however, Mr. Pond concluded that his own queer mood was the
  result of the one fact, which it had really been necessary to describe in
  detail. For the vicar had been obliged to explain, on both occasions, in
  order to make his tale intelligible, that the front of the balcony was scaled
  from below by a titanic, tropical creeper, with ribbed and interlaced limbs
  and large, fantastic leaves. It is not altogether an exaggeration to say that
  the creeper was the principal character in the story.</p>

  <p>"This business happened during the Great War," explained the clergyman,
  "when my daughter and I were living in my house at Hanging Burgess. But the
  two houses on each side of us were empty, due to the drainage of human
  material common at the time. At least, they were both empty for a
  considerable period, though they were handsome houses with large gardens,
  sloping down to the river. Then my friend Dr. Green came down to be my
  next-door neighbour and prosecute his scientific researches in a quiet place.
  He was writing a book, you know, on the domestication of animals; dogs and
  cats and pet marmosets and monkeys, and so on; and my daughter, who is
  interested in such pets, helped him a little with his work.</p>

  <p>"It is a happy time to look back upon, for us who were old cronies;
  perhaps because it was a quiet time.</p>

  <p>"And then our solitude was broken, as it seemed by accident, and all the
  trouble and tragedy began.</p>

  <p>"First of all, a young artist of the name of Albert Ayres rented the house
  next door, though he seemed to want it mostly for a base in which to leave
  his baggage, for he was wandering over the country making sketches; and it is
  only fair, as you will see presently, to admit that he did say, once, that he
  would start straight away next morning on one of his sketching tours. I mean
  that we cannot, in any case, actually prove what became of him.
  Unfortunately, I know only too well what became of him.</p>

  <p>"He was an interesting individual; perhaps a little too like the old
  notion of an artist; the sort one can hardly call either carelessly or
  carefully picturesque; with a halo of yellow hair which the sympathetic might
  connect with Galahad and the unsympathetic with Struwwelpeter. Mind you,
  there was nothing about him effeminate, and nothing false about his position
  in relation to the war. He had been invalided out, and what he was doing was
  a necessary job and not a funk-hole; and, at the moment, he was enjoying a
  short and very well-earned holiday.</p>

  <p>"It is only fair to Captain Gahagan to say that, even in their subsequent
  quarrel, even in the last, blackest days of hatred, and, I hope, of madness,
  which ended in murder, the Captain never sneered at his rival upon that
  point, or assumed anything like the swagger of khaki. But, at the time,
  Captain Gahagan was still in khaki, having a very short leave from the front,
  which he was supposed to spend at the neighbouring inn, but did spend mostly
  in my house.</p>

  <p>"You will understand my reluctance in speaking of the matter; the fact
  that he was on short leave may have given a certain impatience to his rather
  headlong courtship of my daughter, for it could be called nothing else. Some
  say that women do not specially object to that; but I would much prefer not
  to presume on any speculations about that matter. But to deal entirely with
  the facts. They are as follows:</p>

  <p>"One evening, just after sunset, or about dusk, I was walking in my garden
  with the doctor, and we were joined, shortly afterwards, by Albert Ayres. I
  had just asked my friend Green to drop in and take some dinner with us; but
  he happened to be rather exhausted with a heavy day of his scientific work;
  he looked pale and tired; and he declined in a rather distant and distracted
  manner. In fact, I thought he was looking ill."</p>

  <p>"He has not very good health," interposed Mr. Pond, suddenly. "He doesn't
  go about very much. You must remember he is lame." The others stared at him
  again, as if not seeing any importance in the interruption; and again they
  were still more puzzled by his further comment; for he added quite
  calmly:</p>

  <p>"The clue to all this mystery is the fact that Dr. Green is lame."</p>

  <p>"I have not the wildest notion what you mean," said the vicar of Hanging
  Burgess briskly. "But, anyhow, I had better get on and tell you what really
  happened; and you will see that it certainly had nothing to do with either
  lameness or Dr. Green.</p>

  <p>"In strolling round the garden we had paused under the giant creeper that
  grows out of the flower-bed and shoots right up to the balcony; and Ayres was
  just remarking on its unique strength and luxuriousness, when we all had a
  sort of a shock. For we saw the whole creeper move and twist like a monstrous
  serpent, in that still garden; every limb of it heaved and writhed and the
  whole framework of its foliage was shaken as by some impossibly localized
  earthquake. Then we saw that long legs like a giant's were swinging downwards
  and kicking wildly above our heads; and Captain Gahagan, missing his last
  foothold, fell on his feet on the gravel path and faced us with a broad
  grin.</p>

  <p>"'Pray forgive me,' he said, 'I have been paying an afternoon call. I
  dropped in to tea, or perhaps I should say, hopped up to tea; and I have just
  dropped out again.'</p>

  <p>"I told him, perhaps a little frigidly, that we were always pleased to
  receive visitors, but that they generally came in by the front door. He asked
  me, in a rather brazen way, if I had no poetic sympathy with Romeo and the
  romance of climbing balconies. I preferred not to reply; but my friend, the
  doctor, was staring curiously at the creeper, probably in some freak of his
  merely botanical curiosity; and he said, with his faintly acid humour: 'Isn't
  there rather a satire on Romeo in the fact that a weed like that can climb a
  balcony? It isn't quite so common to see a tropical plant ringing the bell
  and coming in at the front door. Climbing doesn't seem a safe way of
  classifying. In nature, you must go very low to find things that go so
  high.'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond sat up abruptly and seemed to exhale a breath; but all he said
  was, "I thought so."</p>

  <p>"The artist named Ayres," continued the vicar, "seemed more annoyed than
  either of us at this absurd adventure; and his comment was really much more
  provocative, though he only said, coolly: 'Well, it looks an easy thing to
  climb; as easy as a great, green ladder. I fancy I could climb it myself, if
  it came to that.'</p>

  <p>"Then I realized for the first time, for I'm rather slow in these things,
  that Gahagan was glaring at him, as he answered sharply: 'Am I to understand
  that it may come to that?' And then I realized that they were both glaring at
  each other; and I guessed, for the first time, why they hated each other; and
  what was the meaning of that scene in my quiet garden.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will get on as quickly as I can to the culmination of these rash
  boasts, or challenges, of the two tragic rivals. For, indeed, I do not know
  which of them had the worst tragedy. Night had fallen and the moon had risen,
  though it was not very much later, cutting up the shady garden into a new
  pattern of shadows, when I happened to look out of my study window, which is
  on an upper floor.</p>

  <p>"I was smoking and reading a book, when a noise like a dog barking, or
  rather howling, made me put my head, more or less carelessly, out of the
  window; I assumed that it was one of Dr. Green's dogs and did not think much
  of the matter; subconsciously, perhaps, something spectral about the
  moonstruck garden and the mood that it stirred, or some more mysterious
  premonition of what was to follow, made the howl sound more hollow and even
  horrible than it really was.</p>

  <p>"A clear moon was rising high behind me; most of the shady garden was in
  all the denser shade; but there were large, pale patches and squares of
  moonshine on the paths and the wall in front of me, cut out as sharply as the
  pasteboard frame of some shadow-pantomime. Perhaps the parallel seized on my
  fancy, partly because light and shadow were thus bent or doubled into
  different planes, vertical or horizontal, like the black and white paper from
  which children cut out the figures for such a play. Anyhow, I did think,
  instantly and very vividly, of a shadow-pantomime; and, the next instant, I
  saw one of the pantomime figures passing in black silhouette across the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"I knew at once whose shadow it was. Of course, it was drawn out and
  distorted; you know how deceptive shadows are; but I could see the straggling
  tufts that reminded one of Struwwelpeter; and I think I told you before that
  Ayres, the artist, was a little too like the traditional artist who hasn't
  had his hair cut. Also, he affected that sort of languid stoop that such
  artists assume; and there was the high-shouldered stoop exaggerated, as
  shadows do exaggerate.</p>

  <p>"The next moment, another of these dark caricatures had appeared on the
  wall; and it was even more unmistakable. It was also more active; it was not
  only a shadow-pantomime but&mdash;in a pretty creepy sense&mdash;a knockabout
  pantomime."</p>

  <p>"Shadows are very deceptive," said Mr. Pond; and again his friends stared
  at him, not because his intervention was important, but because it seemed
  trivial and totally unnecessary. But before he relapsed again into silence,
  he added:</p>

  <p>"The most deceptive thing about a shadow is that it may be quite
  accurate."</p>

  <p>"Well, really!" exploded Wotton; but his moderately mild explosion was
  overshadowed by one of the abrupt movements which once or twice moved the
  gigantic Gahagan to overwhelming but rather baffling gestures, to detached
  and yet outrageous interventions. He turned to his accuser with a bow of
  overbearing courtesy, or even courtliness, and said:</p>

  <p>"You need not be alarmed, sir. That is one of Mr. Pond's paradoxes. We are
  all very proud of our Pond and of his paradoxes. Try them in your bath.
  Pond's paradoxes are in every home. What would Mother do without
  Pond's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Gahagan!" said Hubert Wotton; and his voice had a ring
  of steel which his friends had always respected. There was a silence, in
  which Mr. Pond said simply:</p>

  <p>"I never uttered a paradox in my life. What I said was a truism."</p>

  <p>The vicar of Hanging Burgess looked considerably baffled, but did not lose
  his composure, and continued his story.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid all this seems to me rather off the point; especially as I
  haven't come to the point. I mean the point of my story. Of course, it
  doesn't matter whether the shadows were deceptive or not; because I saw the
  real people a minute or two afterwards. It's true I only saw one of them for
  a minute, you might say for a flash; but the other I saw plainly enough.</p>

  <p>"The first figure, the long-haired figure I had already identified with
  the artist, ran very quickly across the moonlit patch and vanished into the
  vast shadow of the creeper that climbed the balcony; but there is no doubt
  that he began to climb the creeper.</p>

  <p>"The second figure stood for a moment, staring, in the full stare of the
  moon; and there was no doubt about him at all. It was Captain Gahagan, in
  khaki, and he already had his big service revolver in his hand. In a high,
  unnatural voice he cried after and cursed the other unfortunate troubadour,
  who had climbed his romantic rope-ladder of leaves, exactly as he had climbed
  it himself.</p>

  <p>"At that instant the whole situation became finally clear; for I saw the
  hairy head of the unfortunate artist rising out of the tangle of tropical
  leaves, in shadow, but all the more unmistakable for being haloed in the
  moonshine. But the same moonshine fell full on the face of the Captain, as
  glaring as a photographic portrait; and it glared with a frightful grin or
  grimace of hatred."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond again interposed gently, but with the general effect of a jerk:
  "You say it was hatred. Are you sure it was not horror?"</p>

  <p>The vicar was very intelligent, and thought before he answered, even when
  he did not in the least understand. Then he said: "I think so. Besides, why
  should Captain Gahagan be horrified merely at seeing Mr. Ayres?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Pond, after a pause, "because he had not had his hair
  cut."</p>

  <p>"Pond!" said Wotton very sharply. "Do you fancy this is a case for jokes?
  You seem to have forgotten that you said, yourself, it was a painful
  matter."</p>

  <p>"I said it was a painful matter," said Pond, "to think a horrible thing
  was done by an old friend." Then he said, after one of his sudden pauses:
  "But I wasn't thinking of Gahagan."</p>

  <p>The stupefied vicar seemed to have given up everything but the stubborn
  pursuit of his story.</p>

  <p>"As I have told you, Captain Gahagan cursed his rival from below, and
  called on him to come down; but he did not attempt to climb the creeper
  himself, though he had already shown how quickly he could do it.
  Unfortunately, he did something else; which he could do much more quickly. I
  saw the blue flash of the pistol-barrel in the moon, as he lifted it; and
  then the red flash; and then a puff of smoke detached itself and climbed the
  sky, like a cloud; and the man on the green ladder fell crashing like a stone
  through the thrashing great leaves to the dark space below.</p>

  <p>"I could not see so clearly what was happening in that dark space; but I
  knew, for all practical purposes, that the man was dead; for his slayer laid
  hold of one leg of the corpse and dragged it away down the darkling and
  descending paths of the garden. And when I heard a distant splash, I knew he
  had thrown the corpse into the river.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I told you before, that is my very serious testimony to what I
  saw and knew; but I give it only from a sense of social duty to any
  individuals who may be involved; I admit the circumstances are such that
  legal proof would be very difficult now.</p>

  <p>"Albert Ayres had entirely disappeared by next morning; but it is true, as
  I have said, that he had once spoken of going off on a sketching-tour very
  early.</p>

  <p>"Captain Gahagan had also entirely disappeared by next morning; but I
  believe it is true that his leave was practically up, that in any case he had
  to return to the front; and it was utterly hopeless to raise a
  question&mdash;which would, already, be called a doubtful question&mdash;at a
  moment when every man was needed, when common convicts were already working
  out their expiation in the field; and when all information had to be
  hampered, and a veil hung between us and all that vast labyrinth called
  'somewhere in France.' But hearing that, for personal reasons, it was
  essential that Captain Gahagan should be asked to clear or explain his
  record, I have brought the matter up again now. And I have stated nothing
  that I did not see."</p>

  <p>"You have stated it very clearly," said Mr. Pond. "More clearly than you
  know. But even on the clearest moonlight night, as we agreed, shadows can be
  very deceptive."</p>

  <p>"You've said that before," said Sir Hubert rather irritably.</p>

  <p>"And, as I have also said before," observed the unruffled Mr. Pond, "a
  shadow is most misleading when it is precisely correct."</p>

  <p>Silence suddenly fell on the group; and the silence became more and more
  tense, for, after these random shots, which seemed so very random, fired by
  Mr. Pond as he retired from the argument, everyone felt that nothing could
  now delay the main action. For some time it looked rather like inaction; for
  Gahagan, who had been growing gloomier and gloomier, still sat kicking his
  heels, as if he had nothing to say. And indeed, when sharply called on by Sir
  Hubert for his statement, he was, at first, understood to declare seriously,
  not to say grimly, that he had nothing to say.</p>

  <p>"What can I say, except what they call pleading guilty? What can I say,
  except that I did do a horrible thing; I did commit a hateful crime; and my
  sin is ever before me."</p>

  <p>The solicitor seemed suddenly to bristle with electric needles of a sort
  of cold excitement.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, pardon me!" he cried. "Before you say any more, before you say
  a word more, it must be understood that it may be necessary to take note of
  it in a legal manner. On some minor matters we are permitted a certain
  discretion; but if we are to listen to an actual confession of
  murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gahagan shouted; he shouted so loud that the others were almost too
  surprised to notice that it was a shout of laughter, but not very genial
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried. "Do you think I'm confessing to a murder? Oh, this is
  getting tiresome! Of course I never committed any murder. I said I committed
  a crime; but it's not to any damned little lawyer that I have to apologize
  for it."</p>

  <p>He swung round, facing the clergyman; and his whole bodily and mental
  attitude seemed to alter; so that, when he spoke at last, it was like a new
  man speaking.</p>

  <p>"I mean, it's for you. What can I say to you? It's personal for you; I
  mean, it's real. It's no good talking at large about such things. It's no
  good hiding in a crowd; or saying that the crime was committed by a lot of
  poor devils on leave from hell; to whom a holiday was heaven; only it was a
  very earthly paradise; a little too like a Moslem paradise. I did make love
  to your daughter when I had no right to, for I didn't really know my own
  mind. None of us had any mind on those holidays from hell. And it's true that
  I did have a rival. It's true I was in a rage with my rival; I'm still in a
  rage with him, when I think of what he did. Only&mdash;" He paused, as with a
  new embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Mr. Pond gently.</p>

  <p>"Only my rival wasn't the artist with the long hair," said Gahagan.</p>

  <p>Hubert Wotton again looked up sharply, with a frowning stare; but he spoke
  quietly as he directed Gahagan to tell his story properly from the start.</p>

  <p>"I had better start," said Gahagan, "where the other story started: just
  about the time when we both heard the howl of a dog in the dark garden. I may
  explain that I was actually staying with Ayres, the artist, for that night;
  we had become quite good friends, really; though there may have been a bit of
  romantic swagger about the troubadour business at an earlier time.</p>

  <p>"I was packing up and sorting out some of my light luggage; that is how I
  happened to be cleaning my service revolver. Ayres was looking through some
  of his sketch-books; and I left him at it when I went out, just as Mr.
  Whiteways looked out, in casual curiosity, over that sudden noise in the
  night. Only I heard what he did not hear. I not only heard what sounded like
  the howl of a dog, but I also heard a whistle, such as a man uses when
  calling a dog.</p>

  <p>"Also, I saw what he did not see. For an instant, in a gap in the trellis
  and tracery of a vine, I saw, very white in the moonlight, the face of Paul
  Green, that distinguished man of science. He is distinguished and he looks
  distinguished; I remember thinking, at the time, what a fine head he had, and
  that the silver moulding of his features under the moon made them quite
  beautiful. I had a reason for having my attention thus arrested by that
  silvery mask, for, at that precise moment, it wore a sort of smile of hatred
  that turned one's blood cold.</p>

  <p>"Then the face vanished; and again my experience was much like the
  vicar's, except that I did not see everything which happened just behind my
  back. But I swung round in time to see that somebody had run across the path,
  and begun to climb the creeper. He climbed it very quickly, much quicker than
  I had done, but it was not easy to see him or recognize him in the dark
  shadow of the leaves.</p>

  <p>"I had an idea that he was long in the limbs and had the sort of
  high-shouldered stoop that has been described; then I saw, as the vicar did,
  the head emerge clear of the foliage, only outlined by the moon with a sort
  of bristly halo of hair. Only then, for the second time that night, I saw
  what the vicar did not see. The Romeo, the climbing troubadour, turned his
  head, and, for a moment, I saw it in profile, a black shape against the moon.
  And I said to myself: 'My God! It's a dog, after all.'"</p>

  <p>The vicar echoed the invocation faintly; the lawyer made a sharp movement
  as if to intervene; and Wotton told his friend rather brusquely to go on;
  which had the effect of producing a sort of abrupt languor, alarmingly like a
  disposition to leave off.</p>

  <p>"Rather interesting man, Marco Polo," said Captain Gahagan, in a vaguely
  conversational tone. "I think it was Marco Polo, the Venetian; anyhow, it was
  one of those early mediæval travellers. You know everybody used to say they
  told nothing but tall stories about mandrakes and mermaids; but, in many
  cases, it has been found since that their tall tales were true. Anyhow, this
  chap said there were men walking about with the heads of dogs. Now, if you'll
  look at one of the larger apes, like the baboon, you'll see that his head
  really is very like a dog's; not nearly so much like a man's as the head of
  one of the smaller monkeys."</p>

  <p>Mr. Little, the lawyer, was rapidly turning over some of his papers, with
  a shrewd frown and a sharp, alert manner.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Captain Gahagan," he interposed. "I have a fancy that you are
  rather a traveller, yourself; and have picked up travellers' tales in many
  different places. It looks to me as if you had picked up this one in the
  <i>Rue Morgue.</i>"</p>

  <p>"I wish I had," replied the Captain.</p>

  <p>"In the story there," pursued the solicitor, "I think there was an escaped
  anthropoid ape who disobeyed his master and would not return."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Pond, in a low voice, rather like a groan. "But in this
  case it was not disobeying its master."</p>

  <p>"You had better tell the rest of this story, Pond," said the Captain, with
  one of his curious collapses into irresponsible repose. "You evidently
  guessed the real story, I don't know how, before I began to tell it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Little appeared to be somewhat annoyed, and snapped out: "I consider
  the Captain told this curious tale, for what it is worth, in a very
  melodramatic and misleading manner. I have it, in my notes, that he certainly
  said that 'Somebody ran across the path and began to climb the creeper.'"</p>

  <p>"I was quite pedantically correct," said Gahagan, waving his hand,
  condescendingly. "I was careful to state that some <i>body</i> ran and
  climbed. I attempted no theological or metaphysical speculations about the
  soul of an ape."</p>

  <p>"But this is perfectly ghastly!" cried the clergyman, who was deeply
  shaken. "Are you sure the thing I saw was an ape?"</p>

  <p>"I was quite close," said the Captain. "I saw the shape and you only saw
  the shadow."</p>

  <p>"No," said Pond softly, "he saw the shape and could not believe it because
  it was the shadow. That is what I meant by saying a shadow can deceive by
  accuracy. Nine times out of ten, a shadow is out of drawing. But it can
  happen, in special circumstances, that it is an exact silhouette. Only we
  always expect it to be distorted; and so we are deceived by its not being
  distorted. The vicar was not surprised that the hairy, high-shouldered Mr.
  Ayres should throw a shadow looking like a shambling hunchback or a bristly,
  humped figure. But in reality it <i>was</i> a bristly, humped figure. I
  guessed that when he first said, just afterwards, that your own figure was
  much more unmistakable. Why should it be unmistakable, unless the other was a
  mistake?"</p>

  <p>"From where I was, there could be no mistake," said Gahagan. "I knew it
  was an ape, and I guessed it was from the cages or kennels of the eminent
  biologist next door. I had a wild hope it might have been meant as some
  ghastly joke; but I wasn't taking any risks; I happen to know that sort of
  anthropoid is no joke. At the best, he might easily bite and then&mdash;well,
  there were all sorts of nightmare notions half-formed in one's mind.</p>

  <p>"There was another side to your biological friend's interest in pets;
  vivisection, inoculation, intoxication, drugs&mdash;Lord knows what might be
  mixed up in it. So I shot the brute dead, and I'm afraid I can't apologize. I
  threw the body into the river; as you know, it's a very rapid and rushing
  river, and, so far as I know, nothing more was ever heard of it. Certainly,
  Dr. Paul Green did not venture to advertise for it in the papers."</p>

  <p>The solid and deep-chested rustic parson suddenly shuddered from head to
  foot. The spasm passed and he said, heavily, that it was an awful
  business.</p>

  <p>"And <i>that</i> is what I meant," said Mr. Pond, "by saying how bad it is
  to hear an old acquaintance accused of a horrible action. It was, also, what
  I meant by saying that the key to all this riddle is the fact that Dr. Green
  is lame."</p>

  <p>"Even now," muttered the vicar, "I'm not so clear what you mean by
  that."</p>

  <p>"It's all ugly enough," answered Pond, "but I suppose we may fairly say
  that the doctor is, in a rather literal sense, a mad doctor. The point is
  that I think I know what finally drove him mad. He had a remarkable
  personality; he was in love with the lady at the Vicarage and had got a good
  deal of influence there; as Gahagan truly says, he's really a very
  fine-looking fellow and, naturally, quite active; only everything was
  conditioned by the accident that he was lame.</p>

  <p>"What put the finishing touch to his madness, on that terrible summer
  night under the moon, was something that I think one can partly understand,
  with a little imagination; something not altogether unnatural, if anything
  ending in such insanity can be anything but unnatural. He heard his rivals
  boasting about doing the one thing he could not do. First, one of the young
  men swaggered about having done it&mdash;you do swagger, Gahagan, and it's no
  good saying you don't. And the other young man was worse; for he actually
  sneered at doing it because it was so easy to do when, for Green, it was
  impossible to do.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, a mind like his leapt, as we know it did leap, even in
  conversation, to the retort that climbing is no great sign of superiority;
  that a brainless creeper can climb; that an ape can climb better than a man.
  'You have to go very low to find things that go so high.' Considered as a
  logical repartee, it was quite a good one. But his mind was not running
  merely on logic and repartee; he was blind and boiling with jealousy and
  passion, and he was a little cracked. Let's hope he only meant to make a sort
  of demonstration; but, anyhow, that was what he was trying to
  demonstrate."</p>

  <p>Mr. Little, the lawyer, still turned a flinty face to the company; he had
  obviously taken a dislike to Gahagan, who had a way of irritating legal and
  law-abiding persons.</p>

  <p>"I do not know if we are required to accept this extraordinary story, on
  the strength of Mr. Pond's ingenious hypothesis," he said rather sharply;
  "but there is one more question I should like to ask."</p>

  <p>He looked down at his papers, as if consulting them, and then looked up
  again, saying, still more sharply, in the style he had learnt from
  cross-examinations: "Is it not true, Captain Gahagan, that you are rather
  famous for telling remarkable stories? I have it in my notes that you once
  delighted the company by saying you had seen six great sea-serpents, each
  swallowing the last. You reported a remarkable little incident of a giant who
  was buried up to the eyebrows in Muswell Hill; and you are supposed to have
  given a very vivid description of a water-spout frozen all the way up to the
  sky. Your interesting account of the discovery of the ruins of the Tower of
  Babel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Hubert Wotton, with all his apparent simplicity, had a quality of
  sense that sometimes struck like a sledge-hammer. He had preserved the
  silence of perfect impartiality throughout; but he suddenly stopped the last
  splutter of the solicitor's spitefulness, as if he had struck him physically
  dumb.</p>

  <p>"I cannot have all this," he said. "We know Gahagan; and his yarns are all
  nonsense, and your trying to turn them against him is worse nonsense. So long
  as you had a serious charge to bring, we gave you every opportunity to prove
  it. If you are going to talk about things that nobody alive ever took
  seriously, least of all Gahagan, I rule them out."</p>

  <p>"Very well," snapped Mr. Little, "my last question shall be a very
  practical one. If Captain Gahagan only did what he says he did, why the devil
  didn't he say so? Why did he disappear? Why did he do a bolt early next
  morning?"</p>

  <p>Peter Gahagan lifted his large figure laboriously out of the seat; he did
  not even look at the lawyer; but his eyes were fixed on the old clergyman,
  with a profound expression of sorrow.</p>

  <p>"There is an answer to that," he said. "But I would much rather give it to
  anybody except Mr. Whiteways."</p>

  <p>And, strangely enough perhaps, the moment Mr. Whiteways heard this refusal
  he rose also and held out his hand to Gahagan.</p>

  <p>"I believe you," he said. "It's just that last sentence that has made me
  believe you."</p>

  <p>The scornful solicitor, being thus deserted by his own client, stuffed his
  papers back into his little black bag; and the irregular conference broke
  up.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Gahagan did tell the truth about the last question
  afterwards, to the person to whom he told everything, to Joan Varney, to whom
  he was engaged. And, queer as it sounded, she seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>"If you like to put it so," he said, "I didn't run away from the police; I
  ran away from the girl. And I know it sounds mad; but I really felt at the
  moment I was doing my best for her, in a beastly situation and among a lot of
  beastly alternatives. I knew by next morning that the vicar was saying he had
  seen me commit murder. Suppose I contradicted it&mdash;well, to begin with,
  she would have to know that her old friend, the friend of her pets, was a
  horrible lunatic who had offered her a sort of disgusting insult at the
  best.</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't only that. I had behaved as badly as anybody; I was in a
  shamefully false position; and, if I remained, there was nothing before us
  but crawling through all that mire of miserable explanation and hopeless
  remorse, in which it is hard to say whether the man or the woman has the
  worst of it. And then a queer thought came to me&mdash;a secret, almost
  subconscious thought; but I couldn't get rid of the notion. Suppose she went
  on thinking, and remembered afterwards, in calmer times, that one man had
  killed another for her. She would be horrified; but she would not be
  humiliated. A mad whisper kept on repeating to me that in the long run she
  would be&mdash;a little proud."</p>

  <p>"I think you're right about her," said Joan, in her straight way. "But,
  all the same, you ought to have told her the truth."</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, "I simply hadn't the courage."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said. "I also know all about your having the D.S.O.; and
  I've seen you, myself, jump a chasm it made me sick to look at. But that's
  what's the matter with all you fine, fighting gentlemen." Her head lifted
  very slightly. "You haven't the courage."</p>

  <h2><a name="c08"
     id="c08">VIII. &mdash; A TALL STORY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They had been discussing the new troubles in Germany: the
three old
  friends, Sir Hubert Wotton, the famous official; Mr. Pond, the obscure
  official; and Captain Gahagan, who never did a stroke of work in the way of
  putting pen to paper, but liked making up the most fantastic stories on the
  spur of the moment. On this occasion, however, the group was increased to
  four; for Gahagan's wife was present, a candid-looking young woman with
  light-brown hair and dark-brown eyes. They had only just recently been
  married; and the presence of Joan Gahagan still stimulated the Captain to
  rather excessive flights of showing-off.</p>

  <p>Captain Gahagan looked like a Regency buck; Mr. Pond looked like a
  round-eyed fish, with the beard and brow of Socrates; Sir Hubert Wotton
  looked like Sir Hubert Wotton&mdash;it summed up a very sound and virile
  quality in him, for which his friends had a great respect.</p>

  <p>"It's an infernal shame," Wotton was saying, "the way these fellows have
  treated the Jews: perfectly decent and harmless Jews, who were no more
  Communists than I am; little men who'd worked their way up by merit and
  industry, all kicked out of their posts without a penny of compensation.
  Surely you agree with that, Gahagan?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," replied Gahagan. "I never kicked a Jew. I can distinctly
  remember three and a half occasions on which I definitely refrained from
  doing so. As for all those hundreds and thousands of poor little fiddlers and
  actors and chess-players, I think it was a damned shame that they should be
  kicked out or kicked at all. But I fancy they must be kicking themselves, for
  having been so faithful to Germany and even, everywhere else, pretty
  generally pro-German."</p>

  <p>"Even that can be exaggerated," said Mr. Pond. "Do you remember the case
  of Carl Schiller, that happened during the War? It was all kept rather quiet,
  as I have reason to know; for the thing happened, in some sense, in my
  department. I have generally found spy stories the dullest of all forms of
  detective fiction; in my own modest researches into the light literature of
  murder, I invariably avoid them. But this story really did have an unexpected
  and rather astonishing ending. Of course, you know that in wartime the
  official dealing with these things is very much exposed to amateurs, as the
  Duke of Wellington was exposed to authors. We persecuted the spies; and the
  spy-maniacs persecuted us. They were always coming to us to say they had seen
  certain persons who looked like spies. We vainly assured them that spies do
  not look like spies. As a matter of fact, the enemy was pretty ingenious in
  keeping the really suspicious character just out of sight; sometimes by his
  being ordinary; sometimes actually by his being extraordinary; one would be
  too small to be noticed, another too tall to be seen; one was apparently
  paralysed in a hospital and got out of the window at night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Joan looked across at him with a troubled expression in her honest brown
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Please, Mr. Pond, do tell us what you mean by a man being too tall to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>Gahagan's spirits, already high, soared into laughter and light
  improvisation.</p>

  <p>"These things do happen, my dear girl," he said. "I can throw out a
  thousand instances that would meet the case. Take, for example, the case of
  my unfortunate friends the Balham-Browns who lived at Muswell Hill. Mr.
  Balham-Brown had just come home from the office (of the Imperial and
  International Lead-Piping Company) and was exercising the lawn-mower in the
  usual manner, when he noticed in the grass a growth not green but
  reddish-brown and resembling animal hair; nay, even human hair. My friend Mr.
  Pond, whose private collection of Giant Whiskers is unrivalled (except, of
  course, by the unique collection of Sir Samuel Snodd), was able to identify
  it with the long hair of the Anakin; and judged by its vigour, the son of
  Anak was buried but still alive. With the spitefulness of the scientific
  world, Professor Pooter countered with the theory that Jupiter buried the
  Titans, one under Etna, another under Ossa, and a third under Muswell Hill.
  Anyhow, the villa of my ill-fated friends the Balham-Browns was ruined, and
  the whole suburb overturned as by an earthquake, in order to excavate the
  monster. When his head alone emerged, it was like a colossal sphinx; and Mrs.
  Balham-Brown complained to the authorities that the face frightened her,
  because it was too large. Mr. Pond, who happened to be passing at the moment,
  immediately produced a paradox (of which he always carries a small supply)
  and said that, on the contrary, they would soon find that the face was too
  small. To cut a long story short&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or a tall story shorter," said Joan in a trenchant manner.</p>

  <p>"When the Titan was extricated, he was so tall that by the common
  converging laws of perspective, his head in the remote sky was a mere dot. It
  was impossible to discern or recall one feature of that old familiar face. He
  strode away; and fortunately decided to walk across the Atlantic, where even
  he was apparently submerged. It is believed that the unfortunate creature was
  going to give lectures in America; driven by that mysterious instinct which
  leads any person who is notorious for any reason to adopt that course."</p>

  <p>"Well, have you done?" demanded Joan. "We know all about you and your
  yarns; and they don't mean anything. But when Mr. Pond says that somebody was
  too tall to be seen, he does mean something. And what can he possibly
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pond, coughing slightly, "it was really a part of the
  story to which I was alluding just now. I did not notice anything odd about
  the expression when I used it; but I recognize, on second thought, that it
  is, perhaps, a phrase requiring explanation." And he proceeded, in his
  slightly pedantic way, to narrate the story which is now retold here.</p><br>

  <p class="first">It all happened in a fashionable watering-place, which was
  also a famous seaport, and, therefore, naturally a place of concentration for
  all the vigilance against spies, whether official or amateur. Sir Hubert
  Wotton was in general charge of the district, but Mr. Pond was in more
  practical though private occupation of the town, watching events from a
  narrow house in a back street, an upper room of which had been unobtrusively
  turned into an office; and he had two assistants under him; a sturdy and very
  silent young man named Butt, bull-necked and broad-shouldered, but quite
  short; and a much taller and more talkative and elegant government-office
  clerk named Travers, but referred to by nearly everybody as Arthur. The
  stalwart Butt commonly occupied a desk on the ground floor, watching the door
  and anyone who entered it; while Arthur Travers worked in the office
  upstairs, where there were some very valuable State papers, including the
  only plan of the mines in the harbour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond himself always spent several hours in the office, but he had more
  occasion than the others to pay visits in the town, and had a general grasp
  of the neighbourhood. It was a very shabby neighbourhood; indeed, it
  consisted of a few genteel, old-fashioned houses, now mostly shuttered and
  empty, standing on the very edge of a sort of slum of small houses, at that
  time riddled with what is called Unrest in a degree very dangerous,
  especially in time of war. Immediately outside his door, he found but few
  things that could be called features in that featureless street; but there
  was an old curiosity shop opposite, with a display of ancient Asiatic
  weapons; and there was Mrs. Hartog-Haggard next door, more alarming than all
  the weapons of the world.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hartog-Haggard was one of those persons, to be found here and there,
  who look like the conventional caricature of the spinster, though they are in
  fact excellent mothers of families. Rather in the same way, she looked very
  like the sort of lady who is horribly in earnest at Pacifist meetings; yet,
  as a matter of fact, she was passionately patriotic, not to say militaristic.
  And, indeed, it is often true that those two extremes lend themselves to the
  same sort of fluent fanaticism. Poor Mr. Pond had reason to remember the
  woeful day when he first saw her angular and agitated figure darkening his
  doorway as she entered out of the street, peering suspiciously through her
  curious square spectacles. There was apparently some slight delay about her
  entrance; some repairs were being done to the porch and some loose board or
  pole was not removed sufficiently promptly from her path: was, in fact, as
  she declared, removed reluctantly and in a grumbling spirit by the workmen
  employed on the job; and by the time she had reached the responsible
  official, a theory had fully formed and hardened in her mind.</p>

  <p>"That man is a <i>Socialist,</i> Mr. Pond," she declared in the ear of
  that unfortunate functionary. "I heard him with my own ears mutter something
  about what his Trade Union would say. What is he doing so near to your
  office?"</p>

  <p>"We must distinguish," said Mr. Pond. "A Trade Unionist, even a militant
  Trade Unionist, is not necessarily a Socialist; a Socialist is not
  necessarily a Pacifist, still less a Pro-German. In my opinion, the chief
  S.D.F. men are the most extreme Marxians in England; and they are all out for
  the Allies. One of the Dock Strike leaders is in a mood to make recruiting
  speeches all over the Empire."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he's not English; he doesn't look a bit English," said the lady,
  still thinking of her wicked proletarian without.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Hartog-Haggard," said Pond, patiently. "I will certainly
  make a note of your warning and see that inquiries are made about it."</p>

  <p>And so he did, with the laborious precision of one who could not leave any
  loophole unguarded. Certainly the man did not look very English; though
  perhaps rather Scandinavian than German. His name was Peterson: it was
  possible that it was really Petersen. But that was not all. Mr. Pond had
  learned the last lesson of the wise man: that the fool is sometimes
  right.</p>

  <p>He soon forgot the incident in the details of his work; and next day it
  was with a start that he looked up from his desk, or rather from Mr. Butt's
  desk which he was using at the moment, and saw once again the patriotic lady
  hovering like an avenging shadow in the doorway. This time she glided swiftly
  in, unchecked by any Socialist barricade, and warned him that she had news of
  the most terrible kind. She seemed to have forgotten all about her last
  suspicions; and, in truth, her new ones were naturally more important to her.
  This time she had warmed the viper on her own hearth. She had suddenly become
  conscious of the existence of her own German governess, whom she had never
  especially noticed before. Pond himself had noticed the alien in question
  with rather more attention; he had seen her, a dumpy lady with pale hair,
  returning with Mrs. Hartog-Haggard's three little girls and one little boy
  from the pantomime of Puss-in-Boots that was being performed on the pier. He
  had even heard her instructing her charges, and saying something educational
  about a folk-tale; and had smiled faintly at that touch of Teutonic pedantry
  that talks about a folk-tale when we would talk about a fairy-tale. But he
  knew a good deal about the lady; and saw no reason to move in the matter.</p>

  <p>"She shuts herself up for hours in her room and won't come out," Mrs.
  Hartog-Haggard was already breathing hoarsely in his ear. "Do you think she
  is signalling, or does she climb down the fire-escape? What do you think it
  means, Mr. Pond?"</p>

  <p>"Hysterics," said Mr. Pond. "What, do you think the poor lady cannot be
  hysterical, because she does not scream the house down? But any doctor will
  tell you that hysteria is mostly secretive and silent. And there really is a
  vein of hysteria in a great many of the Germans; it is at the very opposite
  extreme to the external excitability of the Latins. No, madam, I do not think
  she is climbing down the fire-escape. I think she is saying that her pupils
  do not love her, and thinking about <i>weltschmerz</i> and suicide. And
  really, poor woman, she is in a very hard position."</p>

  <p>"She won't come to family prayers," continued the patriotic matron, not to
  be turned from her course, "because we pray for a British victory."</p>

  <p>"You had better pray," said Mr. Pond, "for all the unhappy Englishwomen
  stranded in Germany by poverty or duty or dependence. If she loves her native
  land, it only shows she is a human being. If she expresses it by ostentatious
  absences or sulks or banging doors, that may show she is too much of a
  German. It also shows she is not much of a German spy."</p>

  <p>Here again, however, Mr. Pond was careful not to ignore or entirely
  despise the warning; he kept an eye on the German governess, and even engaged
  that learned lady in talk upon some trivial pretext&mdash;if anything she
  touched could remain trivial.</p>

  <p>"Your study of our national drama," he said gravely, "must sometimes
  recall to you the greatest and noblest work that ever came out of
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"You refer to Goethe's <i>Faust,</i> I presume," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I refer to Grimm's Fairy-Tales," said Mr. Pond. "I fear I have forgotten
  for the moment whether the story we call <i>Puss-in-Boots</i> exists in
  Grimm's collection in the same form; but I am pretty certain there is some
  variant of it. It always seems to me about the best story in the world."</p>

  <p>The German governess obliged him with a short lecture on the parallelism
  of folk-lore; and Pond could not help feeling faintly amused at the idea of
  this ethnological and scientific treatment of a folk-tale which had just been
  presented on the pier by Miss Patsy Pickles, in lights and various other
  embellishments, supported by that world-famed comedian who called himself
  Alberto Tizzi and was born in the Blackfriars Road.</p>

  <p>When he returned to his office at twilight, and, turning, beheld the
  figure of Mrs. Hartog-Haggard again hovering without, Mr. Pond began to think
  he was in a nightmare. He wondered wildly whether she had drawn some dark
  conclusions from his own meeting with the Teutonic teacher of youth. Perhaps
  he, Mr. Pond, was a German spy, too. But he ought to have known his neighbour
  better; for when Mrs. Hartog-Haggard spoke she had once again forgotten, for
  the moment, her last cause of complaint. But she was more excited than ever;
  she ducked under the frame of scaffolding and darted into the room, crying
  out as she came:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pond, do you know what is right opposite your own house?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think so," said Mr. Pond, doubtfully, "more or less."</p>

  <p>"I never read the name over the shop before!" cried the lady. "You know it
  is all dark and dirty and obliterated&mdash;that curiosity shop, I mean; with
  all the spears and daggers. Think of the impudence of the man! He's actually
  written up his name there: 'C. Schiller.'"</p>

  <p>"He's written up C. Schiller; I'm not so sure he's written up his name,"
  said Mr. Pond.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," she cried, "that you actually know he goes by two names?
  Why, that makes it worse than ever!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pond, rising suddenly, and with a curtness that cut all
  his own courtesy, "I'll see what I can do about it."</p>

  <p>And for the third time did Mr. Pond take some steps to verify the
  Hartog-Haggard revelations. He took the ten or twelve steps necessary to take
  him across the road and into the shop of C. Schiller, amid all the shining
  sabres and yataghans. It was a very peaceable-looking person who waited
  behind all this array of arms; not to say a rather smooth and sleek one; and
  Pond, leaning across the counter, addressed him in a low and confidential
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Why the dickens do you people do it? It will be more than half your own
  fault if there's a row of some kind and a Jingo mob comes here and breaks
  your windows for your absurd German name. I know very well this is no quarrel
  of yours. I am well aware," Mr. Pond continued with an earnest gaze, "that
  you never invaded Belgium. I am fully conscious that your national tastes do
  not lie in that direction. I know you had nothing to do with burning the
  Louvain Library or sinking the <i>Lusitania.</i> Then why the devil can't you
  say so? Why can't you call yourself Levy, like your fathers before
  you&mdash;your fathers who go back to the most ancient priesthood of the
  world? And you'll get into trouble with the Germans, too, some day, if you go
  about calling yourself Schiller. You might as well go and live in
  Stratford-on-Avon and call yourself Shakespeare."</p>

  <p>"There'th a lot of prejudith againth my rathe," said the warden of the
  armoury.</p>

  <p>"There'll be a lot more, unless you take my advice," said Mr. Pond with
  unusual brevity; and left the shop to return to the office.</p>

  <p>The square figure of Mr. Butt, who was sitting at the desk looking towards
  the doorway, rose at his entrance; but Pond waved him to his seat again and,
  lighting a cigarette, began to moon about the room in a rather moody fashion.
  He did not believe that there was anything very much in any of the three
  avenues of suspicion that had been opened to him; though he owned that there
  were indirect possibilities about the last. Mr. Levy was certainly not a
  German; and it was very improbable that he was a real enthusiast for Germany;
  but it was not altogether impossible to suppose, in the tangle and
  distraction of all the modern international muddle, that he might be some
  sort of tool, conscious or unconscious, of a real German conspiracy. So long
  as that was possible, he must be watched. Mr. Pond was very glad that Mr.
  Levy lived in the shop exactly opposite.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he found himself gazing across the street in the gathering dusk
  with feelings which he found it hard to analyse. He could still see the shop,
  with its pattern of queer, archaic weapons, through the frame of the last few
  poles left in the low scaffolding round the porch; for the workmen's business
  had been entirely limited to the porch itself and the props were mostly
  cleared away, the work being practically over; but there was just enough
  suggestion of a cluster or network of lines to confuse the prospect at that
  very confusing turn of the twilight. Once he fancied he saw something flicker
  behind them, as if a shadow had shifted; and there arose within him the
  terror of Mrs. Hartog-Haggard, which is the terror of boredom and a sort of
  paralysed impatience, one of the worst of the woes of life.</p>

  <p>Then he saw that the shifting shadow must have been produced by the fact
  that the lights had been turned up in the shop opposite; and he saw again,
  and now much more clearly, the queer outline of all those alien Asiatic
  weapons, the crooked darts and monstrous missiles, the swords with a horrid
  resemblance to hooks or the blades that bent back and forth like snakes of
  iron. . . . He became dreamily conscious of the chasm between Christendom and
  that great other half of human civilization; so dreamily that he hardly knew
  which was a torture implement and which was a tool. Whether the thought was
  mingled with his own belief that he was fighting a barbarism at heart as
  hostile, or whether he had caught a whiff of the strange smell of the East
  from that apparently harmless human accident who kept the shop, he could
  hardly be certain himself; but he felt the peculiar oppression of his work as
  he had never felt it before.</p>

  <p>Then he shook himself awake, telling himself sharply that his business was
  working and not worrying about the atmosphere of the work; and that he should
  be ashamed to idle when his two subordinates were still busy, Butt behind
  him, and Travers in the office above. He was all the more surprised, when he
  turned sharply around, to find that Butt was not working at all; but, like
  himself, was staring, not to say glaring, as in a congested mystification,
  into the twilight. Butt was commonly the most calm and prosaic of
  subordinates; but the look on his face was quite enough to prove that
  something was really the matter.</p>

  <p>"Is anything bothering you?" asked Pond, in a gentle voice which people
  found very encouraging.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Mr. Butt. "I'm bothering about whether I'm going to be a
  beast or not. It's a beastly caddish thing to say a word, or hint a word,
  against your comrades or anybody connected with them. But after
  all&mdash;well, sir, there is the country, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"There is certainly the country," said Mr. Pond, very seriously.</p>

  <p>"Well," Butt blurted out at last, "I'm not a bit comfortable about
  Arthur."</p>

  <p>Then, after a sort of gasp, he tried again: "At least, it isn't so much
  Arthur as Arthur's . . . what Arthur's doing. It makes it all the nastier to
  have put it like that. But you know he got engaged last week. Have you met
  his fiancée, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet had the honour," replied Pond, in his punctilious way.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, Arthur brought her in here to-day while you were out; he'd
  just taken her to the pantomime of Puss-in-Boots on the pier, and they were
  laughing like anything. Of course, that's quite all right; it was his off
  time; but it seemed to me it wasn't quite all right that she walked straight
  upstairs without any invitation, even from him, to the private office where
  we don't allow visitors to go. Of course, that's about the only possible case
  where I could hardly prevent it. In the ordinary way, we're perfectly safe; I
  mean the documents are perfectly safe. There's only one door, and you or I
  are always sitting bang in front of it; and there's only one staircase, and
  nobody uses it but we three. Of course, she might have done it in all
  innocence; that's what made it seem quite too ghastly to snub her. And yet. .
  . . Well, she's a very nice-looking girl, and no doubt a very nice girl; but
  somehow that's just the one word that wouldn't jump to my mind about
  her&mdash;innocence."</p>

  <p>"Why, what sort of a girl is she?" asked Pond.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Butt, gloomily seeking words, "we all know that making-up
  and even dyeing your hair doesn't mean what it once did; lots of women do it
  who are perfectly decent; but not those who are&mdash;well, utterly
  inexperienced. It seemed to me that, while she might be perfectly honest, she
  <i>would</i> know very decidedly whether a thing is done or not."</p>

  <p>"If she is engaged to him," said Pond, with a rather unusual severity,
  "she must know that he is here on highly confidential work, and she must be
  as anxious to protect his honour as we are. I'm afraid that I shall have to
  ask you for some sort of description."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Butt, "she's very tall and elegant, or . . . no, elegant is
  exactly the word. She has beautiful golden hair&mdash;very beautiful golden
  hair&mdash;and very beautiful long dark eyes that make it look rather like a
  gilded wig. She has high cheekbones, not in the way that Scotch girls have,
  but somehow as if it were part of the shape of the skull; and though she's
  not at all long in the tooth, in any sense, her teeth are just a little to
  the fore."</p>

  <p>"Did he meet her in Besançon, near Belfort?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty rum you should say that," said Butt, miserably; "because he
  did."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond received the news in silence.</p>

  <p>"I hope, sir, you won't assume anything against Arthur," said Butt,
  huskily. "I'm sure I'd do anything to clear him of any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the ceiling above them shook with a thud like thunder; then
  there was a sound of scampering feet; and then utter stillness. No one
  acquainted with Mr. Pond's usual process of ambulation could have believed
  that he flew up the staircase as he did just then.</p>

  <p>They flung open the door, and they saw all that was to be seen. All that
  was to be seen was Arthur Travers stretched out face downwards on the ground,
  and between his shoulder-blades stood out the very long hilt of a very
  strange-looking sword. Butt impetuously laid hold of it, and was startled to
  find that it was sunk so deep in the corpse and the carpeted floor that he
  could not have plucked it out without the most violent muscular effort. Pond
  had already touched the wrist and felt the rigidity of the muscles and he
  waved his subordinate away.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say that our friend is certainly dead," he said steadily.
  "In that case, you had better not touch things till they can be properly
  examined." Then, looking at Butt very solemnly, he added:</p>

  <p>"You said you would do anything to clear him. One thing is certain: that
  he is quite cleared."</p>

  <p>Pond then walked in silence to the desk, which contained the secret drawer
  and the secret plan of the harbour. He only compressed his lips when he saw
  that the drawer was empty.</p>

  <p>Pond walked to the telephone and issued orders to about six different
  people. He did about twenty things, but he did not speak again for about
  three-quarters of an hour. It was only about the same time that the stunned
  and bewildered Butt stumbled into speech.</p>

  <p>"I simply can't make head or tail of anything. That woman had gone; and,
  besides, no woman could have nailed him to the floor like that."</p>

  <p>"And with such an extraordinary nail," said Pond, and was silent once
  more.</p>

  <p>And indeed the riddle revolved more and more on the one thing that thief
  and murderer had left behind him: the enormous misshapen weapon. It was not
  difficult to guess why he had left it behind; it was so difficult to tug out
  of the floor that he probably had no time to try effectually, hearing Pond
  clattering up the stairs; he thought it wiser to escape somehow, presumably
  through the window. But about the nature of the thing itself it was hard to
  say anything, for it seemed quite abnormal. It was as long as a claymore; yet
  it was not upon the pattern of any known sword. It had no guard or pommel of
  any kind. The hilt was as long as the blade; the blade was twice as broad as
  the hilt; at least, at its base, whence it tapered to a point in a sort of
  right-angled triangle, only the outer edge or hypotenuse being sharpened.
  Pond gazed musingly at this uncouth weapon, which was made very rudely of
  iron and wood painted with garish colours; and his thoughts crept slowly back
  to that shop across the road that was hung with strange and savage weapons.
  Yet this seemed to be in a somewhat cruder and gaudier style. Mr.
  Schiller-Levy naturally denied all knowledge of it, which he would presumably
  have done in any case; but what was much more cogent, all the real
  authorities on such barbaric or Oriental arms said that they had never seen
  such a thing before.</p>

  <p>Touching many other things, the darkness began to thin away to a somewhat
  dreary dawn. It was ascertained that poor Arthur's equivocal fiancée had
  indeed fled; very possibly in company with the missing plan. She was known by
  this time to be a woman quite capable of stealing a document or even stabbing
  a man. But it was doubtful whether any woman was capable of stabbing a man,
  with that huge and heavy and clumsy instrument, so as to fix him to the
  floor; and quite impossible to imagine why she should select it for the
  purpose.</p>

  <p>"It would all be as clear as death," said Mr. Butt, bitterly, "except for
  that lumbering, long-hilted short-sword, or whatever it is. It never was in
  Levy's shop. It never was in Asia or Africa or any of the tribes the learned
  jossers tell us about. It's the real remaining mystery of the whole
  thing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond seemed to be waking up slowly from a trance of hours or days.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>that,</i>" he said, "that's the only thing about it I'm really
  beginning to understand."</p>

  <p>It has been hinted, with every delicacy, we may hope, that the attitude of
  Mr. Pond towards the visits of Mrs. Hartog-Haggard was, perhaps, rather
  passive than receptive; that he did not look forward to them as pants the
  hart for cooling streams; and that for him they rather resembled getting into
  hot water. It is all the more worthy of record that, on the last occasion of
  her bringing him a new tale of woe, he actually leapt to his feet with an air
  of excitement and even of triumph. He had been right in his premonitions
  about the wisdom of folly; and the triumph was truly the triumph of the fool.
  Mrs. Hartog-Haggard gave him the clue after all.</p>

  <p>She darted in under the scaffolding by the doorway, the same dark and
  almost antic figure. Full of the Cause, she was utterly oblivious of such
  trifles as the murder of his friend. She had now reverted to her original
  disapproval of her own governess. She had altered nothing, except all her
  reasons for disapproving of her governess. On the former occasion she had
  appeared to claim the fairy-tale used for pantomimes as exclusively English
  and part of the healthy innocence of the stately homes of England. Now she
  was denouncing the German woman for taking the children to the pantomime at
  all; regarding it as a ruse for filling them with the gruesome tales of Grimm
  and the terrors of the barbaric forest.</p>

  <p>"They're <i>sent</i> to do that," she repeated in the fierce, confidential
  voice she used in such cases. "They're sent here to undermine all our
  children's nerves and minds. Could any other nation be such fiends, Mr. Pond?
  She's been poisoning their poor little minds with horrors about magicians and
  magic cats; and now the worst has happened, as I knew it would.
  Well&mdash;<i>you</i> haven't done anything to stop it; and my life is simply
  ruined. My three girls are all twittering with terror; and my boy is
  mad."</p>

  <p>The symptoms of Mr. Pond were still mainly those of fatigue; and she
  rapped out a repetition.</p>

  <p>"He is <i>mad</i>, I tell you, Mr. Pond; he is actually <i>seeing</i>
  things out of those horrible German fairy-tales; says he saw a giant with a
  great knife walking through the town by moonlight . . . a <i>giant,</i> Mr.
  Pond."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond staggered to his feet and for once really goggled and gulped like
  a fish. Mrs. Hartog-Haggard watched him with wild eyes, intermittently
  exclaiming: "Have you no word of consolation for a mother?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pond abruptly controlled himself and managed to recapture, at least, a
  hazy courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," he said. "I have the best possible consolation for a mother.
  Your son is not mad."</p>

  <p>He looked more judicial, and even severe, when he next sat in consultation
  with Mr. Butt, Sir Hubert Wotton, and Inspector Grote, the leading detective
  of the district.</p>

  <p>"What it comes to is this," said Mr. Pond, very sternly: "that you do not
  really know the story of Puss-in-Boots. And they talk about this as an epoch
  of Education."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know it's about a clever cat and all the rest of it," said Butt,
  vaguely. "A cat that helps its master to get things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Inspector smote his knee with a smack that rang through the
  office.</p>

  <p>"A cat burglar!" he cried. "So that's what you mean. I fancied at first
  there was something wrong about that bit of scaffolding round the door; but I
  soon saw it was far too low and small for anybody to climb up to the window
  by it. But, of course, if we're talking about a really clever cat burglar,
  there's always some chance that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said Mr. Pond, "does a cat burglar, or for that matter any
  burglar, any more than any cat, load himself with a gigantic knife rather
  bigger than a garden spade? Nobody carries a gigantic knife except a giant.
  This crime was committed by a giant."</p>

  <p>They all stared at him; but he resumed with the same air of frigid
  rebuke:</p>

  <p>"What I remark upon, what I regret and regard as symptomatic of serious
  intellectual decay, is that you apparently do not know that the story of
  Puss-in-Boots includes a giant. He is also a magician; but he is always
  depicted, in pictures and pantomimes, as an ogre with a large knife. Signor
  Alberto Tizzi, that somewhat dubious foreign artist, enacts the part on the
  pier by the usual expedient of walking on very high stilts, covered by very
  long trousers. But he sometimes walks about on the stilts and dispenses with
  the trousers; taking a walk through the almost entirely deserted streets at
  night. Just round here, especially, the chances are against his being even
  seen; all the big houses are shut up, except ours and Mrs. Hartog-Haggard's,
  which only looks on the street through a landing window; through which her
  little boy (probably in his nightgown) peered and beheld a real ogre, with a
  great gory knife, and, perhaps, a great grinning mask, walking majestically
  under the moon&mdash;rather a fine sight to put among the memories of
  childhood. For the rest, all the poor houses are low houses of one storey;
  and the people would see nothing but his legs, or rather his stilts, even if
  they did look out; and they probably didn't. The really native poor, in these
  seaport towns, have country habits; and generally go to bed early. But it
  wouldn't really have been fatal to his plans even if he had been seen. He was
  a recognized public entertainer, dressed in his recognized part; and there is
  nothing illegal in walking about on stilts. The really clever part of it was
  the trick by which he could leave the stilts standing, and climb out of them
  on to any ledge or roof or other upper level. So he left them standing
  outside our doorway, among the poles of the little scaffolding, while he
  climbed in at the upper window and killed poor Travers."</p>

  <p>"If you are sure of this," cried Sir Hubert Wotton, starting to his feet
  hastily, "you ought to act on it at once!"</p>

  <p>"I did act on it at once," replied Pond, with a slight sigh. "This morning
  two or three clowns with white faces were going about on stilts on the beach,
  distributing leaflets of the pantomime. One of them was arrested and found to
  be Signor Tizzi. He was also found, I am glad to say, to be still in
  possession of the plans." But he sighed again.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"For after all," as Mr. Pond observed, in telling the tale
  long after, "though we did manage to save the secret plans, the incident was
  much more of a tragedy than a triumph. And what I most intensely disliked
  about the tragedy was the irony&mdash;what I believe is called the tragic
  irony, or, alternatively, the Greek irony. We felt perfectly certain we were
  guarding the only entrance to the office, because we sat staring at the
  street between two little clusters of sticks, which we knew were a temporary
  part of the furniture. We didn't count the sticks; we didn't know when there
  happened to be two more wooden poles standing up among the other wooden
  poles. We certainly had no notion of what was on top of those two poles; nor
  would our fancy have easily entertained the idea that it was a pantomime
  giant. We ought to have seen him&mdash;only," said Mr. Pond, ending, as he
  had begun, with an apologetic little laugh, "he was too tall to be seen."</p>
