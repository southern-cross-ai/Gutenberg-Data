<p class="first">AS I entered John Kirowan's study I was too much
engrossed in my own thoughts to notice, at first, the haggard
appearance of his visitor, a big, handsome young fellow well
known to me.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kirowan," I greeted. "Hello, Gordon. Haven't seen you
for quite a while. How's Evelyn?" And before he could answer,
still on the crest of the enthusiasm which had brought me there,
I exclaimed: "Look here, you fellows, I've got something that
will make you stare! I got it from that robber Ahmed Mektub, and
I paid high for it, but it's worth it. Look!" From under my coat
I drew the jewel-hilted Afghan dagger which had fascinated me as
a collector of rare weapons.</p>

<p>Kirowan, familiar with my passion, showed only polite
interest, but the effect on Gordon was shocking.</p>

<p>With a strangled cry he sprang up and backward, knocking the
chair clattering to the floor. Fists clenched and countenance
livid he faced me, crying: "Keep back! Get away from me,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was frozen in my tracks.</p>

<p>"What in the&mdash;" I began bewilderedly, when Gordon, with
another amazing change of attitude, dropped into a chair and sank
his head in his hands. I saw his heavy shoulders quiver. I stared
helplessly from him to Kirowan, who seemed equally
dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Is he drunk?" I asked.</p>

<p>Kirowan shook his head, and filling a brandy glass, offered it
to the man. Gordon looked up with haggard eyes, seized the drink
and gulped it down like a man half famished. Then he straightened
up and looked at us shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I went off my handle, O'Donnel" he said. "It was
the unexpected shock of you drawing that knife."</p>

<p>"Well," I retorted, with some disgust, "I suppose you thought
I was going to stab you with it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did!" Then, at the utterly blank expression on my
face, he added: "Oh, I didn't actually <i>think</i> that; at
least, I didn't reach that conclusion by any process of
reasoning. It was just the blind primitive instinct of a hunted
man, against whom anyone's hand may be turned."</p>

<p>His strange words and the despairing way he said them sent a
queer shiver of nameless apprehension down my spine.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" I demanded uneasily. "Hunted?
For what? You never committed a crime in your life."</p>

<p>"Not in this life, perhaps," he muttered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What if retribution for a black crime committed in a previous
life were hounding me?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"That's nonsense," I snorted.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it?" he exclaimed, stung. "Did you ever hear of my
great-grandfather, Sir Richard Gordon of Argyle?"</p>

<p>"Sure; but what's that got to do with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've seen his portrait: doesn't it resemble me?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," I admitted, "except that your expression is frank
and wholesome whereas his is crafty and cruel."</p>

<p>"He murdered his wife," answered Gordon. "Suppose the theory
of reincarnation were true? Why shouldn't a man suffer in one
life for a crime committed in another?"</p>

<p>"You mean you think you are the reincarnation of your great-
grandfather? Of all the fantastic&mdash;well, since he killed his
wife, I suppose you'll be expecting Evelyn to murder you!" This
last was delivered in searing sarcasm, as I thought of the sweet,
gentle girl Gordon had married. His answer stunned me.</p>

<p>"My wife," he said slowly, "has tried to kill me three times
in the past week."</p>

<p>There was no reply to that. I glanced helplessly at John
Kirowan. He sat in his customary position, chin resting on his
strong, slim hands; his white face was immobile, but his dark
eyes gleamed with interest. In the silence I heard a clock
ticking like a death-watch.</p>

<p>"Tell us the full story, Gordon," suggested Kirowan, and his
calm, even voice was like a knife that cut a strangling,
relieving the unreal tension.</p>

<p><br>
"You know we've been married less than a year," Gordon began,
plunging into the tale as though he were bursting for utterance;
his words stumbled and tripped over one another. "All couples
have spats, of course, but we've never had any real quarrels.
Evelyn is the best natured girl in the world."</p>

<p>"The first thing out of the ordinary occurred about a week
ago. We had driven up in the mountains, left the car, and were
wandering around picking wild flowers. At last we came to a steep
slope, some thirty feet in height, and Evelyn called my attention
to the flowers which grew thickly at the foot. I was looking over
the edge and wondering if I could climb down without tearing my
clothes to ribbons, when I felt a violent shove from behind that
toppled me over.</p>

<p>"If it had been a sheer cliff, I'd have broken my neck. As it
was, I went tumbling down, rolling and sliding, and brought up at
the bottom scratched and bruised, with my garments in rags. I
looked up and saw Evelyn staring down, apparently frightened half
out of her wits.</p>

<p>"'Oh Jim!" she cried. "Are you hurt? How came you to fall?'</p>

<p>"It was on the tip of my tongue to tell her that there was
such a thing as carrying a joke too far, but these words checked
me. I decided that she must have stumbled against me
unintentionally, and actually didn't know it was she who
precipitated me down the slope."</p>

<p>"So I laughed it off, and went home. She made a great fuss
over me, insisted on swabbing my scratches with iodine, and
lectured me for my carelessness! I hadn't the heart to tell her
it was her fault."</p>

<p>"But four days later, the next thing happened. I was walking
along our driveway, when I saw her coming up it in the
automobile. I stepped out on the grass to let her by, as there
isn't any curb along the driveway. She was smiling as she
approached me, and slowed down the car, as if to speak to me.
Then, just before she reached me, a most horrible change came
over her expression. Without warning the car leaped at me like a
living thing as she drove her foot down on the accelerator. Only
a frantic leap backward saved me from being ground under the
wheels. The car shot across the lawn and crashed into a tree. I
ran to it and found Evelyn dazed and hysterical, but unhurt. She
babbled of losing control of the machine."</p>

<p>"I carried her into the house and sent for Doctor Donnelly. He
found nothing seriously wrong with her, and attributed her dazed
condition to fright and shock. Within half an hour she regained
her normal senses, but she's refused to touch the wheel since.
Strange to say, she seemed less frightened on her own account
than on mine. She seemed vaguely to know that she'd nearly run me
down, and grew hysterical again when she spoke of it. Yet she
seemed to take it for granted that I knew the machine had got out
of her control. But I distinctly saw her wrench the wheel around,
and I know she deliberately tried to hit me&mdash;why, God alone
knows."</p>

<p>"Still I refused to let my mind follow the channel it was
getting into. Evelyn had never given any evidence of any
psychological weakness or 'nerves'; she's always been a level-
headed girl, wholesome and natural. But I began to think she was
subject to crazy impulses. Most of us have felt the impulse to
leap from tall buildings. And sometimes a person feels a blind,
childish and utterly reasonless urge to harm someone. We pick up
a pistol, and the thought suddenly enters our mind how easy it
would be to send our friend, who sits smiling and unaware, into
eternity with a touch of the trigger. Of course we don't do it,
but the impulse is there. So I thought perhaps some lack of
mental discipline made Evelyn susceptible to these unguided
impulses, and unable to control them."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I broke in. "I've known her since she was a baby.
If she has any such trait, she's developed it since she married
you."</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate remark. Gordon caught it up with a
despairing gleam in his eyes. "That's just it&mdash;since she
married me! It's a curse&mdash;a black, ghastly curse, crawling
like a serpent out of the past! I tell you, I was Richard Gordon
and she&mdash;she was Lady Elizabeth, his murdered wife!" His
voice sank to a blood-freezing whisper.</p>

<p>I shuddered; it is an awful thing to look upon the ruin of a
keen clean brain, and such I was certain that I surveyed in James
Gordon. Why or how, or by what grisly chance it had come about I
could not say, but I was certain the man was mad.</p>

<p>"You spoke of three attempts." It was John Kirowan's voice
again, calm and stable amid the gathering webs of horror and
unreality.</p>

<p>"Look here!" Gordon lifted, his arm, drew back the sleeve and
displayed a bandage, the cryptic significance of which was
intolerable.</p>

<p>"I came into the bathroom this morning looking for my razor,"
he said. "I found Evelyn just on the point of using my best
shaving implement for some feminine purpose&mdash;to cut out a
pattern, or something. Like many women she can't seem to realize
the difference between a razor and a butcher-knife or a pair of
shears.</p>

<p>"I was a bit irritated, and I said: 'Evelyn, how many times
have I told you not to use my razors for such things? Bring it
here; I'll give you my pocket-knife.'</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm sorry, Jim,' she said. 'I didn't know it
would hurt the razor. Here it is.'</p>

<p>"She was advancing, holding the open razor toward me. I
reached for it&mdash;then something warned me. It was the same
look in her eyes, just as I had seen it the day she nearly ran
over me. That was all that saved my life, for I instinctively
threw up my hand just as she slashed at my throat with all her
power. The blade gashed my arm as you see, before I caught her
wrist. For an instant she fought me like a wild thing; her
slender body was taut as steel beneath my hands. Then she went
limp and the look in her eyes was replaced by a strange dazed
expression. The razor slipped out of her fingers."</p>

<p>"I let go of her and she stood swaying as if about to faint. I
went to the lavatory&mdash;my wound was bleeding in a beastly
fashion&mdash;and the next thing I heard her cry out, and she was
hovering over me.</p>

<p>"'Jim!" she cried. "How did you cut yourself so terribly?'"</p>

<p><br>
Gordon shook his head and sighed heavily. "I guess I was a bit
out of my head. My self-control snapped.</p>

<p>"'Don't keep up this pretense, Evelyn,' I said. 'God knows
what's got into you, but you know as well as I that you've tried
to kill me three times in the past week.'</p>

<p>"She recoiled as if I'd struck her, catching at her breast and
staring at me as if at a ghost. She didn't say a word&mdash;and
just what I said I don't remember. But when I finished I left her
standing there white and still as a marble statue. I got my arm
bandaged at a drug store, and then came over here, not knowing
what else to do.</p>

<p>"Kirowan&mdash;O'Donnel&mdash;it's damnable! Either my wife is
subject to fits of insanity&mdash;" He choked on the word. "No, I
can't believe it. Ordinarily her eyes are too clear and
level&mdash;too utterly sane. But every time she has an
opportunity to harm me, she seems to become a temporary
maniac."</p>

<p>He beat his fists together in his impotence and agony.</p>

<p>"But it isn't insanity! I used to work in a psychopathic ward,
and I've seen every form of mental unbalance. My wife is <i>not</i>
insane!"</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;" I began, but he turned haggard eyes on
me.</p>

<p>"Only one alternative remains," he answered. "It is the old
curse&mdash;from the days when I walked the earth with a heart as
black as hell's darkest pits, and did evil in the sight of man
and of God. <i>She</i> knows, in fleeting snatches of memory.
People have <i>seen</i> before&mdash;have glimpsed forbidden
things in momentary liftings of the veil, which bars life from
life. She was Elizabeth Douglas, the ill-fated bride of Richard
Gordon, whom he murdered in jealous frenzy, and the vengeance is
hers. I shall die by her hands, as it was meant to be. And
she&mdash;" he bowed his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"Just a moment." It was Kirowan again. "You have mentioned a
strange look in your wife's eyes. What sort of a look? Was it of
maniacal frenzy?"</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. "It was an utter blankness. All the
life and intelligence simply vanished, leaving her eyes dark
wells of emptiness."</p>

<p>Kirowan nodded, and asked a seemingly irrelevant question.
"Have you any enemies?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"You forget Joseph Roelocke," I said. "I can't imagine that
elegant sophisticate going to the trouble of doing you actual
harm, but I have an idea that if he could discomfort you without
any physical effort on his part, he'd do it with a right good
will."</p>

<p>Kirowan turned on me an eye that had suddenly become
piercing.</p>

<p>"And who is this Joseph Roelocke?"</p>

<p>"A young exquisite who came into Evelyn's life and nearly
rushed her off her feet for a while. But in the end she came back
to her first love&mdash;Gordon here. Roelocke took it pretty
hard. For all his suaveness there's a streak of violence and
passion in the man that might have cropped out but for his
infernal indolence and blase indifference."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing to be said against Roelocke," interrupted
Gordon impatiently. "He must know that Evelyn never really loved
him. He merely fascinated her temporarily with his romantic Latin
air."</p>

<p>"Not exactly Latin, Jim," I protested. "Roelocke does look
foreign, but it isn't Latin. It's almost Oriental."</p>

<p>"Well, what has Roelocke to do with this matter?" Gordon
snarled with the irascibility of frayed nerves. "He's been as
friendly as a man could be since Evelyn and I were married. In
fact, only a week ago he sent her a ring which he said was a
peace-offering and a belated wedding gift; said that after all,
her jilting him was a greater misfortune for her than it was for
him&mdash;the conceited jackass!"</p>

<p>"A ring?" Kirowan had suddenly come to life; it was as if
something hard and steely had been sounded in him. "What sort of
a ring?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a fantastic thing&mdash;copper, made like a scaly snake
coiled three times, with its tail in its mouth and yellow jewels
for eyes. I gather he picked it up somewhere in Hungary."</p>

<p>"He has traveled a great deal in Hungary?"</p>

<p>Gordon looked surprised at this questioning but answered:
"Why, apparently the man's traveled everywhere. I put him down as
the pampered son of a millionaire. He never did any work, so far
as I know."</p>

<p>"He's a great student," I put in. "I've been up to his
apartment several times, and I never saw such a collection of
books&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gordon leaped to his feet with an oath, "Are we all crazy?" he
cried. "I came up here hoping to get some help&mdash;and you
fellows fall to talking of Joseph Roelocke. I'll go to Doctor
Donnelly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Kirowan stretched out a detaining hand. "If you don't
mind, we'll go over to your house. I'd like to talk to your
wife."</p>

<p>Gordon dumbly acquiesced. Harried and haunted by grisly
forebodings, he knew not which way to turn, and welcomed anything
that promised aid.</p>

<p><br>
We drove over in his car, and scarcely a word was spoken on
the way. Gordon was sunk in moody ruminations, and Kirowan had
withdrawn himself into some strange aloof domain of thought
beyond my ken. He sat like a statue, his dark vital eyes staring
into space, not blankly, but as one who looks with understanding
into some far realm.</p>

<p>Though I counted the man as my best friend, I knew but little
of his past. He had come into my life as abruptly and unannounced
as Joseph Roelocke had come into the life of Evelyn Ash. I had
met him at the Wanderer's Club, which is composed of the drift of
the world, travelers, eccentrics, and all manner of men whose
paths lie outside the beaten tracks of life. I had been attracted
to him, and intrigued by his strange powers and deep knowledge. I
vaguely knew that he was the black sheep younger son of a titled
Irish family, and that he had walked many strange ways. Gordon's
mention of Hungary struck a chord in my memory; one phase of his
life Kirowan had once let drop fragmentarily. I only knew that he
had once suffered a bitter grief and a savage wrong, and that it
had been in Hungary. But the nature of the episode I did not
know.</p>

<p>At Gordon's house Evelyn met us calmly, showing inner
agitation only by the over-restraint of her manner. I saw the
beseeching look she stole at her husband. She was a slender,
soft-spoken girl, whose dark eyes were always vibrant and alight
with emotion. That child try to murder her adored husband? The
idea was monstrous. Again I was convinced that James Gordon
himself was deranged.</p>

<p>Following Kirowan's lead, we made a pretense of small talk, as
if we had casually dropped in, but I felt that Evelyn was not
deceived. Our conversation rang false and hollow, and presently
Kirowan said: "Mrs. Gordon, that is a remarkable ring you are
wearing. Do you mind if I look at it?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to give you my hand," she laughed. "I've been
trying to get it off today, and it won't come off."</p>

<p>She held out her slim white hand for Kirowan's inspection, and
his face was immobile as he looked at the metal snake that coiled
about her slim finger. He did not touch it. I myself was aware of
an unaccountable repulsion. There was something almost obscene
about that dull copperish reptile wound about the girl's white
finger.</p>

<p>"It's evil-looking, isn't it?" She involuntarily shivered. "At
first I liked it, but now I can hardly bear to look at it. If I
can get it off I intend to return it to Joseph&mdash;Mr.
Roelocke."</p>

<p>Kirowan was about to make some reply, when the doorbell rang.
Gordon jumped as if shot, and Evelyn rose quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll answer it, Jim&mdash;I know who it is."</p>

<p>She returned an instant later with two more mutual friends,
those inseparable cronies, Doctor Donnelly, whose burly body,
jovial manner and booming voice were combined with as keen a
brain as any in the profession, and Bill Bain, elderly, lean,
wiry, acidly witty. Both were old friends of the Ash family.
Doctor Donnelly had ushered Evelyn into the world, and Bain was
always Uncle Bill to her.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Jim! Howdy, Mr. Kirowan!" roared Donnelly. "Hey,
O'Donnel, have you got any firearms with you? Last time your
nearly blew my head off showing me an old flintlock pistol that
wasn't supposed to be loaded!"</p>

<p>"Doctor Donnelly!"</p>

<p>We all turned. Evelyn was standing beside a wide table,
holding it as if for support. Her face was white. Our badinage
ceased instantly. A sudden tension was in the air.</p>

<p>"Doctor Donnelly," she repeated, holding her voice steady by
an effort, "I sent for you and Uncle Bill&mdash;for the same
reason for which I know Jim has brought Mr. Kirowan and Michael.
There is a matter Jim and I can no longer deal with alone. There
is something between us&mdash;something black and ghastly and
terrible."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, girl?" All the levity was gone
from Donnelly's great voice.</p>

<p>"My husband&mdash;" She choked, then went blindly on: "My
husband has accused me of trying to murder him."</p>

<p>The silence that fell was broken by Bain's sudden and
energetic rise. His eyes blazed and his fists quivered.</p>

<p>"You young pup!" he shouted at Gordon. "I'll knock the living
daylights&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Bill!" Donnelly's huge hand crushed his smaller
companion back into his chair. "No use goin' off half cocked. Go
ahead, honey."</p>

<p>"We need help. We can not carry this thing alone." A shadow
crossed her comely face. "This morning Jim's arm was badly cut.
He said I did it. I don't know. I was handing him the razor. Then
I must have fainted. At least, everything faded away. When I came
to myself he was washing his arm in the
lavatory&mdash;and&mdash;and he accused me of trying to kill
him."</p>

<p>"Why, the young fool!" barked the belligerent Bain. "Hasn't he
sense enough to know that if you did cut him, it was an
accident?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, won't you?" snorted Donnelly. "Honey, did you say
you fainted? That isn't like you."</p>

<p>"I've been having fainting spells," she answered. "The first
time was when we were in the mountains and Jim fell down a cliff.
We were standing on the edge&mdash;then everything went black,
and when my sight cleared, he was rolling down the slope." She
shuddered at the recollection.</p>

<p>"Then when I lost control of the car and it crashed into the
tree. You remember&mdash;Jim called you over."</p>

<p>Doctor Donnelly nodded his head ponderously.</p>

<p>"I don't remember you ever having fainting spells before."</p>

<p>"But Jim says I pushed him over the cliff!" she cried
hysterically. "He says I tried to run him down in the car! He
says I purposely slashed him with the razor!"</p>

<p>Doctor Donnelly turned perplexedly, toward the wretched
Gordon.</p>

<p>"How about it, son?"</p>

<p>"God help me," Gordon burst out in agony; "it's true!"</p>

<p>"Why, you lying hound!" It was Bain who gave tongue, leaping
again to his feet. "If you want a divorce, why don't you get it
in a decent way, instead of resorting to these despicable
tactics&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" roared Gordon, lunging up, and losing control of
himself completely. "If you say that I'll tear your jugular
out!"</p>

<p>Evelyn screamed; Donnelly grabbed Bain ponderously and banged
him back into his chair with no overly gentle touch, and Kirowan
laid a hand lightly on Gordon's shoulder. The man seemed to
crumple into himself. He sank back into his chair and held out
his hands gropingly toward his wife.</p>

<p>"Evelyn," he said, his voice thick with laboring emotion, "you
know I love you. I feel like a dog. But God help me, it's true.
If we go on this way, I'll be a dead man, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say it!" she screamed. "I know you wouldn't lie to me,
Jim. If you say I tried to kill you, I know I did. But I swear,
Jim, I didn't do it consciously. Oh, I must be going mad! That's
why my dreams have been so wild and terrifying lately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of what have you dreamed, Mrs. Gordon?" asked Kirowan
gently.</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her temples and stared dully at him,
as if only half comprehending.</p>

<p>"A black thing," she muttered. "A horrible faceless black
thing that mows and mumbles and paws over me with apish hands. I
dream of it every night. And in the daytime I try to kill the
only man I ever loved. I'm going mad! Maybe I'm already crazy and
don't know it."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, honey." To Doctor Donnelly, with all his
science, it was only another case of feminine hysteria. His
matter-of-fact voice seemed to soothe her, and she sighed and
drew a weary hand through her damp locks.</p>

<p>"We'll talk this all over, and everything's goin' to be okay,"
he said, drawing a thick cigar from his vest pocket. "Gimme a
match, honey."</p>

<p>She began mechanically to feel about the table, and just as
mechanically Gordon said: "There are matches in the drawer,
Evelyn."</p>

<p>She opened the drawer and began groping in it, when suddenly,
as if struck by recollection and intuition, Gordon sprang up,
white-faced, and shouted: "No, no! Don't open that
drawer&mdash;don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he voiced that urgent cry, she stiffened, as if at the
feel of something in the drawer. Her change of expression held us
all frozen, even Kirowan. The vital intelligence vanished from
her eyes like a blown-out flame, and into them came the look
Gordon had described as blank. The term was descriptive. Her
beautiful eyes were dark wells of emptiness, as if the soul had
been withdrawn from behind them.</p>

<p>Her hand came out of the drawer holding a pistol, and she
fired point-blank. Gordon reeled with a groan and went down,
blood starting from his head. For a flashing instant she looked
down stupidly at the smoking gun in her hand, like one suddenly
waking from a nightmare. Then her wild scream of agony smote our
ears.</p>

<p>"Oh God, I've killed him! Jim! <i>Jim!</i>"</p>

<p>She reached him before any of us, throwing herself on her
knees and cradling his bloody head in her arms, while she sobbed
in an unbearable passion of horror and anguish. The emptiness was
gone from her eyes; they were alive and dilated with grief and
terror.</p>

<p>I was making toward my prostrate friend with Donnelly and
Bain, but Kirowan caught my arm. His face was no longer immobile;
his eyes glittered with a controlled savagery.</p>

<p>"Leave him to them!" he snarled. "We are hunters, not healers!
Lead me to the house of Joseph Roelocke!"</p>

<p>I did not question him. We drove there in Gordon's car.
I had the wheel, and something about the grim face of my
companion caused me to hurl the machine recklessly through the
traffic. I had the sensation of being part of a tragic drama
which was hurtling with headlong speed toward a terrible
climax.</p>

<p>I wrenched the car to a grinding halt at the curb before the
building where Roelocke lived in a bizarre apartment high above
the city. The very elevator that shot us skyward seemed imbued
with something of Kirowan's driving urge for haste. I pointed out
Roelocke's door, and he cast it open without knocking and
shouldered his way in. I was close at his heels.</p>

<p><br>
Roelocke, in a dressing-gown of Chinese silk worked with
dragons, was lounging on a divan, puffing quickly at a cigarette.
He sat up, overturning a wine-glass which stood with a half-
filled bottle at his elbow.</p>

<p>Before Kirowan could speak, I burst out with our news. "James
Gordon has been shot!"</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet. "Shot? When? When did she kill
him?"</p>

<p><i>"She?"</i> I glared in bewilderment. "How did you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a steely hand Kirowan thrust me aside, and as the men
faced each other, I saw recognition flare up in Roelocke's face.
They made a strong contrast: Kirowan, tall, pale with some white-
hot passion; Roelocke, slim, darkly handsome, with the saracenic
arch of his slim brows above his black eyes. I realized that
whatever else occurred, it lay between those two men. They were
not strangers; I could sense like a tangible thing the hate that
lay between them.</p>

<p>"John Kirowan!" softly whispered Roelocke.</p>

<p>"You remember me, Yosef Vrolok!" Only an iron control kept
Kirowan's voice steady. The other merely stared at him without
speaking.</p>

<p>"Years ago," said Kirowan more deliberately, "when we delved
in the dark mysteries together in Budapest, I saw whither you
were drifting. I drew back; I would not descend to the foul
depths of forbidden occultism and diabolism to which you sank.
And because I would not, you despised me, and you robbed me of
the only woman I ever loved; you turned her against me by means
of your vile arts, and then you degraded and debauched her, sank
her into your own foul slime. I had killed you with my hands
then, Yosef Vrolok&mdash;vampire by nature as well as by name
that you are&mdash;but your arts protected you from physical
vengeance. But you have trapped yourself at last!"</p>

<p>Kirowan's voice rose in fierce exultation. All his cultured
restraint had been swept away from him, leaving a primitive,
elemental man, raging and gloating over a hated foe.</p>

<p>"You sought the destruction of James Gordon and his wife,
because she unwittingly escaped your snare; you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roelocke shrugged his shoulders and laughed. "You are mad. I
have not seen the Gordons for weeks. Why blame me for their
family troubles?"</p>

<p>Kirowan snarled. "Liar as always. What did you say just now
when O'Donnel told you Gordon had been shot? 'When did she kill
him?' You were expecting to hear that the girl had killed her
husband. Your psychic powers had told you that a climax was close
at hand. You were nervously awaiting news of the success of your
devilish scheme.</p>

<p>"But I did not need a slip of your tongue to recognize your
handiwork. I knew as soon as I saw the ring on Evelyn Gordon's
finger; the ring she could not remove; the ancient and accursed
ring of Thoth-amon, handed down by foul cults of sorcerers since
the days of forgotten Stygia, I knew that ring was yours, and I
knew by what ghastly rites you came to possess it. And I knew its
power. Once she put it on her finger, in her innocence and
ignorance, she was in your power. By your black magic you
summoned the black elemental spirit, <i>the haunter of the
ring</i>, out of the gulfs of Night and the ages. Here in your
accursed chamber you performed unspeakable rituals to drive
Evelyn Gordon's soul from her body, and to cause that body to be
possessed by that godless sprite from <i>outside</i> the human
universe.</p>

<p>"She was too clean and wholesome, her love for her husband too
strong, for the fiend to gain complete and permanent possession
of her body; only for brief instants could it drive her own
spirit into the void and animate her form. But that was enough
for your purpose. But you have brought ruin upon yourself by your
vengeance!"</p>

<p>Kirowan's voice rose to a feline screech.</p>

<p>"What was the price demanded by the fiend you drew from the
Pits? Ha, you blench! Yosef Vrolok is not the only man to have
learned forbidden secrets! After I left Hungary, a broken man, I
took up again the study of the black arts, to trap you, you
cringi	ng serpent! I explored the ruins of Zimbabwe, the lost
mountains of inner Mongolia, and the forgotten jungle islands of
the southern seas. I learned what sickened my soul so that I
forswore occultism for ever&mdash;but I learned of the black
spirit that deals death by the hand of a beloved one, and is
controlled by a master of magic.</p>

<p>"But, Yosef Vrolok, you are not an adept! You have not the
power to control the fiend you have invoked. And you have sold
your soul!"</p>

<p>The Hungarian tore at his collar as if it were a strangling
noose. His face had changed, as if a mask had dropped away; he
looked much older.</p>

<p>"You lie!" he panted. "I did not promise him <i>my</i>
soul&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not lie!" Kirowan's shriek was shocking in its wild
exultation. "I know the price a man must pay for calling forth
the nameless shape that roams the gulfs of Darkness. Look! There
in the corner behind you! A nameless, sightless thing is
laughing&mdash;is mocking you! It has fulfilled its bargain, and
it has come for you, Yosef Vrolok!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" shrieked Vrolok, tearing his limp collar away from
his sweating throat. His composure had crumpled, and his
demoralization was sickening to see. "I tell you it was not my
soul&mdash;I promised it a soul, but not <i>my</i> soul&mdash;he
must take the soul of the girl, or of James Gordon."</p>

<p>"Fool!" roared Kirowan. "Do you think <i>he</i> could take the
souls of innocence? That he would not know they were beyond his
reach? The girl and the youth he could kill; their souls were not
his to take or yours to give. But <i>your</i> black soul is not beyond
his reach, and he will have his wage. <i>Look!</i> He is
materializing behind you! He is growing out of thin air!"</p>

<p>Was it the hypnosis inspired by Kirowan's burning words that
caused me to shudder and grow cold, to feel an icy chill that was
not of earth pervade the room? Was it a trick of light and shadow
that seemed to produce the effect of a black anthropomorphic
shadow on the wall behind the Hungarian? <i>No</i>, by heaven! It grew,
it swelled&mdash;Vrolok had not turned. He stared at Kirowan with
eyes starting from his head, hair standing stiffly on his scalp,
sweat dripping from his livid face.</p>

<p>Kirowan's cry started shudders down my spine.</p>

<p>"Look behind you, fool! <i>I see him!</i> He has come! He is
here! His grisly mouth gapes in awful laughter! His misshapen
paws reach for you!"</p>

<p>And then at last Vrolok wheeled, with an awful shriek,
throwing his arms above his head in a gesture of wild despair.
And for one brain-shattering instant he was <i>blotted out</i> by
a great black shadow&mdash;Kirowan grasped my arm and we fled
from that accursed chamber, blind with horror.</p>

<p><br>
The same paper which bore a brief item telling of James Gordon
having suffered a slight scalp-wound by the accidental discharge
of a pistol in his home, headlined the sudden death of Joseph
Roelocke, wealthy and eccentric clubman, in his sumptuous
apartments&mdash;apparently from heart-failure.</p>

<p>I read it at breakfast, while I drank cup after cup of black
coffee, from a hand that was not too steady, even after the lapse
of a night. Across the table from me Kirowan likewise seemed to
lack appetite. He brooded, as if he roamed again through bygone
years.</p>

<p>"Gordon's fantastic theory of reincarnation was wild enough,"
I said at last. "But the actual facts were still more incredible.
Tell me, Kirowan, was that last scene the result of hypnosis? Was
it the power of your words that made me seem to see a black
horror grow out of the air and rip Yosef Vrolok's soul from his
living body?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No human hypnotism would strike that
black-hearted devil dead on the floor. No; there are beings
outside the ken of common humanity, foul shapes of transcosmic
evil. Such a one it was with which Vrolok dealt."</p>

<p>"But how could it claim his soul?" I persisted. "If indeed
such an awful bargain had been struck, it had not fulfilled its
part, for James Gordon was not dead, but merely knocked
senseless."</p>

<p>"Vrolok did not know it," answered Kirowan. "He thought that
Gordon was dead, and I convinced him that he himself had been
trapped, and was doomed. In his demoralization he fell easy prey
to the thing he called forth. <i>It</i>, of course, was always
watching for a moment of weakness on his part. The powers of
Darkness never deal fairly with human beings; he who traffics
with them is always cheated in the end."</p>

<p>"It's a mad nightmare," I muttered. "But it seems to me, then,
that you as much as anything else brought about Vrolok's
death."</p>

<p>"It is gratifying to think so," Kirowan answered. "Evelyn
Gordon is safe now; and it is a small repayment for what he did
to another girl, years ago, and in a far country."</p>
