<hr><h2><a name="ch0"></a>A DEDICATION</h2>

<p>Some disquieting confessions must be made in printing at last the
play of <i>Peter Pan;</i> among them this, that I have no
recollection of having written it. Of that, however, anon. What I
want to do first is to give Peter to the Five without whom he never
would have existed. I hope, my dear sirs, that in memory of what we
have been to each other you will accept this dedication with your
friend's love. The play of Peter is streaky with you still, though
none may see this save ourselves.A score of Acts had to be left out,
and you were in them all.We first brought Peter down, didn't we, with
a blunt-headed arrow in Kensington Gardens? I seem to remember that
we believed we had killed him, though he was only winded, and that
after a spasm of exultation in our prowess the more soft hearted
among us wept and all of us thought of the police.There was not one
of you who would not have sworn as an eye-witness to this occurrence;
no doubt I was abetting, but you used to provide corroboration that
was never given to you by me. As for myself, I suppose I always knew
that I made Peter by rubbing the five of you violently together, as
savages with two sticks produce a flame. That is all he is, the spark
I got from you.</p>

<p>We had good sport of him before we clipped him small to make him
fit the boards. Some of you were not born when the story began and
yet were hefty figures before we saw that the game was up. Do you
remember a garden at Burpham and the initiation there of No. 4 when
he was six weeks old,and three of you grudged letting him in so
young? Have you,No. 3, forgotten the white violets at the Cistercian
abbey in which we cassocked our first fairies (all little friends of
St.Benedict), or your cry to the Gods, 'Do I just kill one pirate all
the time?' Do you remember Marooners' Hut in the haunted groves of
Waverley, and the St. Bernard dog in atiger's mask who so frequently
attacked you, and the literary record of that summer, <i>The Boy
Castaways,</i> which is so much the best and the rarest of this
author's works? What was it that made us eventually give to the
public in the thin form of a play that which had been woven for
ourselves alone? Alas, I know what it was, I was losing my grip. One
by one as you swung monkey-wise from branch to branch in the wood of
make-believe you reached the tree of knowledge. Sometimes you swung
back into the wood, as the unthinking may at a cross-road take a
familiar path that no longer leads to home;or you perched
ostentatiously on its boughs to please me, pretending that you still
belonged; soon you knew it only as the vanished wood, for it vanishes
if one needs to look for it. A time came when I saw that No. I, the
most gallant of you all,ceased to believe that he was ploughing woods
incarnadine, and with an apologetic eye for me derided the lingering
faith of No. 2; when even No. 3 questioned gloomily whether he did
not really spend his nights in bed. There were still two who knew no
better, but their day was dawning. In these circumstances, I suppose,
was begun the writing of the play of Peter.That was a quarter of a
century ago, and I clutch my brows in vain to remember whether it was
a last desperate throw to retain the five of you for a little longer,
or merely a cold decision to turn you into bread and butter.</p>

<p>This brings us back to my uncomfortable admission that I have no
recollection of writing the play of <i>Peter Pan,</i> now being
published for the first time so long after he made his bow upon the
stage. You had played it until you tired of it, and tossed it in the
air and gored it and left it derelict in the mud and went on your way
singing other songs; and then I stole back and sewed some of the gory
fragments together with a pen-nib. That is what must have happened,
but I cannot remember doing it. I remember writing the story of
<i>Peter and Wendy</i> many years after the production of the play,
but I might have cribbed that from some typed copy. I can haul back
to mind the writing of almost every other assay of mine,however
forgotten by the pretty public; but this play of Peter,no. Even my
beginning as an amateur playwright, that noble mouthful, <i>Bandelero
the Bandit,</i> I remember every detail of its composition in my
school days at Dumfries. Not less vivid is my first little piece,
produced by Mr. Toole. It was called <i>Ibsen's Ghost,</i> and was a
parody of the mightiest craftsman that ever wrote for our kind
friends in front. To save the management the cost of typing I wrote
out the 'parts,' after being told what parts were, and I can still
recall my first words, spoken so plaintively by a now famous
actress,&mdash;'To run away from my second husband just as I ran away
from my first, it feels quite like old times.' On the first night a
man in the pit found <i>Ibsen's Ghost</i> so diverting that he had to
be removed in hysterics. After that no one seems to have thought of
it at all. But what a man to carry about with one! How odd, too, that
these trifles should adhere to the mind that cannot remember the long
job of writing Peter. It does seem almost suspicious, especially as I
have not the original MS. of <i>Peter Pan</i> (except a few stray
pages) with which to support my claim. I have indeed another MS.,
lately made, but that 'proves nothing.' I know not whether I lost
that original MS. or destroyed it or happily gave it away. I talk of
dedicating the play to you,but how can I prove it is mine? How ought
I to act if someother hand, who could also have made a copy, thinks
it worthwhile to contest the cold rights? Cold they are to me now as
that laughter of yours in which Peter came into being long before he
was caught and written down. There is Peter still, but to me he lies
sunk in the gay Black Lake.</p>

<p>Any one of you five brothers has a better claim to the authorship
than most, and I would not fight you for it, but you should have
launched your case long ago in the days when you most admired me,
which were in the first year of the play, owing to a rumour's
reaching you that my spoils were one-and-sixpence a night. This was
untrue, but it did give me a standing among you. You watched for my
next play with peeled eyes, not for entertainment but lest it
contained some chance witticism of yours that could be challenged as
collaboration; indeed I believe there still exists a legal document,
full of the Aforesaid and Henceforward to be called Part-Author, in
which for some such snatching I was tied down to pay No. 2 one
halfpenny daily throughout the run of the piece.</p>

<p>During the rehearsals of Peter (and it is evidence in my favour
that I was admitted to them) a depressed man in overalls, carrying a
mug of tea or a paint-pot, used often to appear by my side in the
shadowy stalls and say to me, 'The gallery boys won't stand it.' He
then mysteriously faded away as if he were the theatre ghost. This
hopelessness of his is what all dramatists are said to feel at such
times, so perhaps he was the author. Again, a large number of
children whom I have seen playing Peter in their homes with careless
mastership, constantly putting in better words, could have thrown it
off with ease. It was for such as they that after the first
production I had to add something to the play at the request of
parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person)
about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on
him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds
and needed surgical attention.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding other possibilities, I think I wrote Peter,and if
so it must have been in the usual inky way. Some of it, I like to
think, was done in that native place which is the dearest spot on
earth to me, though my last heart-beats shall be with my beloved
solitary London that was so hard to reach. I must have sat at a table
with that great dog waiting for me to stop, not complaining, for he
knew it was thus we made our living,but giving me a look when he
found he was to be in the play, with his sex changed. In after years
when the actor who was Nana had to go to the wars he first taught his
wife how to take his place as the dog till he came back, and I am
glad that I see nothing funny in this; it seems to me to belong to
the play. I offer this obtuseness on my part as my first proof that I
am the author.</p>

<p>Some say that we are different people at different periods of our
lives, changing not through effort of will, which is a brave affair,
but in the easy course of nature every ten years or so. I suppose
this theory might explain my present trouble, but I don't hold with
it; I think one remains the same person throughout, merely passing,
as it were, in these lapses of time from one room to another, but all
in the same house. If we unlock the rooms of the far past we can peer
in and see ourselves, busily occupied in beginning to become you and
me. Thus, if I am the author in question the way he is to go should
already be showing in the occupant of my first compartment, at whom I
now take the liberty to peep. Here he is at the age of seven or so
with his fellow-conspirator Robb, both in glengarry bonnets. They are
giving an entertainment in a tiny old washing-house that still
stands. The charge for admission is preens, a bool, or a peerie (I
taught you a good deal of Scotch, so possibly you can follow that),
and apparently the culminating Act consists in our trying to put each
other into the boiler, though some say that I also addressed the
spell-bound audience. This washing-house is not only the theatre of
my first play, but has a still closer connection with Peter. It is
the original of the little house the Lost Boys built in the NeverLand
for Wendy, the chief difference being that it neverwore John's tall
hat as a chimney. If Robb had owned a lumhat I have no doubt that it
would have been placed on the washing-house.</p>

<p>Here is that boy again some four years older, and the reading he
is munching feverishly is about desert islands; he calls them wrecked
islands. He buys his sanguinary tales surreptitiously in penny
numbers. I see a change coming over him; he is blanching as he reads
in the high-class magazine, <i>Chatterbox,</i> a fulmination against
such literature, and sees that unless his greed for islands is
quenched he is for ever lost. With gloaming he steals out of the
house, his library bulging beneath his palpitating waistcoat. I
follow like his shadow, as indeed I am, and watch him dig a hole in a
field at Pathhead farm and bury his islands in it; it was ages ago,
but I could walk straight to that hole in the field now and delve for
the remains. I peep into the next compartment. There he is again, ten
years older,an undergraduate now and craving to be a real explorer,
one of those who do things instead of prating of them, but otherwise
unaltered; he might be painted at twenty on top of a mast, in his
hand a spy-glass through which he rakes the horizon for an elusive
strand. I go from room to room, and he is now a man, real exploration
abandoned (though only because no one would have him). Soon he is
even concocting other plays, and quaking <i>\a</i> little lest some
low person counts how many islands there are in them. I note that
with the years the islands grow more sinister, but it is only because
he has now to write with the left hand, the right having given out;
evidently one thinks more darkly down the left arm. Go to the keyhole
of the compartment where he and I join up, and you may see us
wondering whether they would stand one more island. This journey
through the house may not convince any one that I wrote Peter, but it
does suggest me as a likely person. I pauseto ask myself whether I
read <i>Chatterbox</i> again, suffered the old agony, and buried that
MS. of the play in a hole in a field.</p>

<p>Of course this is over-charged. Perhaps we do change; except a
little something in us which is no larger than a mote inthe eye, and
that, like it, dances in front of us beguiling us all our days. I
cannot cut the hair by which it hangs.</p>

<p>The strongest evidence that I am the author is to be found,I
think, in a now melancholy volume, the aforementioned <i>The Boy
Castaways;</i> so you must excuse me for parading that work here.
Officer of the Court, call <i>The Boy Castaways.</i> The witness
steps forward and proves to be a book you remember well though you
have not glanced at it these many years. I pulled it out of a
bookcase just now not without difficulty, for its recent occupation
has been to support the shelf above. I suppose, though I am
uncertain, that it was I and not you who hammered it into that place
of utility. It is a little battered and bent after the manner of
those who shoulder burdens, andought (to our shame) to remind us of
the witnesses who sometimes get an hour off from the cells to give
evidence before his Lordship. I have said that it is the rarest of my
printed works,as it must be, for the only edition was limited to two
copies, of which one (there was always some devilry in any matter
connected with Peter) instantly lost itself in a railway
carriage.This is the survivor. The idlers in court may have assumed
that it is a handwritten screed, and are impressed by its bulk.It is
printed by Constable's (how handsomely you did us, dear Blaikie), it
contains thirty-five illustrations and is bound in cloth with a
picture stamped on the cover of the three eldest of you 'setting out
to be wrecked.' This record is supposed to be edited by the youngest
of the three, and I must have granted him that honour to make up for
his being so often lifted bodily out of our adventures by his nurse,
who kept breaking into them for the fell purpose of giving him a
midday rest. No.4 rested so much at this period that he was merely an
honorary member of the band, waving his foot to you for luck when you
set off with bow and arrow to shoot his dinner for him;and one may
rummage the book in vain for any trace of No. 5. Here is the title
page, except that you are numbered instead of named&mdash;</p>

<p align="center">THE BOY<br>
CASTAWAYS<br>
OF BLACK LAKE ISLAND<br>
Being a record of the Terrible<br>
Adventures of Three Brothers<br>
in the summer of 1901<br>
faithfully set forth<br>
by No. 3.<br>
LONDON<br>
*<br>
Published by J. M. Barrie<br>
in the Gloucester Road<br>
1901</p>
<hr>

<p>There is a long preface by No. 3 in which we gather your ages at
this first flight. 'No. I was eight and a month, No. 2 was
approaching his seventh lustrum, and I was a good bit past four.' Of
his two elders, while commending their fearless dispositions, the
editor complains that they wanted to do all the shooting and carried
the whole equipment of arrows inside their shirts. He is attractively
modest about himself, 'Of No. 3 I prefer to say nothing, hoping that
the tale as it is unwound will show that he was a boy of deeds rather
than of words,' a quality which he hints did not unduly protrude upon
the brows of Nos. 1 and 2. His preface ends on a high note, 'I should
say that the work was in the first instance compiled as a record
simply at which we could whet our memories, and that it is now
published for No. 4's benefit. If it teaches him by example lessons
in fortitude and manly endurance we shall consider that we were not
wrecked in vain.'</p>

<p>Published to whet your memories. Does it whet them? Do you hear
once more, like some long-forgotten whistle beneath your window (Robb
at dawn calling me to the fishing!) the not quite mortal blows that
still echo in some of, the chapter headings?&mdash;'Chapter II, No. 1
teaches Wilkinson (his master) a Stern Lesson&mdash;We Run away to
Sea. Chapter III, A Fearful Hurricane&mdash;Wreck of the "Anna
Pink"&mdash;We go crazy from Want of Food&mdash;Proposal to eat No.
3&mdash;Land Ahoy.' Such are two chapters out of sixteen. Are these
again your javelins cutting tunes in the blue haze of the pines; do
you sweat as you scale the dreadful Valley of Rolling Stones,and
cleanse your hands of pirate blood by scouring them carelessly in
Mother Earth? Can you still make a fire (you could do it once, Mr.
Seton-Thompson taught us in, surely an odd place, the Reform Club) by
rubbing those sticks together? Was it the travail of hut-building
that subsequently advised Peter to find a 'home under the ground'?
The bottle and mugs in that lurid picture, 'Last night on the
Island,' seem to suggest that you had changed from Lost Boys into
pirates,which was probably also a tendency of Peter's. Listen again
to our stolen saw-mill, man's proudest invention; when he made the
saw-mill he beat the birds for music in a wood.</p>

<p>The illustrations (full-paged) in <i>The Boy Castaways</i> are all
photographs taken by myself; some of them indeed of phenomena that
had to be invented afterwards, for you were always off doing the
wrong things when I pressed the button. I see that we combined
instruction with amusement; perhaps we had given our kingly word to
that effect. How otherwise account for such wording to the pictures
as these: 'It is undoubtedly,' says No. 1 in a fir tree that is
bearing unwonted fruit,recently tied to it, 'the <i>Cocos
nucifera,</i> for observe the slender columns supporting the crown of
leaves which fall with a grace that no art can imitate.' 'Truly,'
continues No. 1 under the same tree in another forest as he leans
upon his trusty gun,'though the perils of these happenings are great,
yet would I rejoice to endure still greater privations to be thus
rewarded by such wondrous studies of Nature.' He is soon back to the
practical, however, 'recognising the Mango <i>(Magnifera indica)</i>
by its lancet-shaped leaves and the cucumber-shaped fruit.' No. 1 was
certainly the right sort of voyager to be wrecked with, though if my
memory fails me not, No. 2, to whom these strutting observations were
addressed, sometimes protested because none of them was given to him.
No. 3 being the author is in surprisingly few of the pictures, but
this, you may remember, was because the lady already darkly
referredto used to pluck him from our midst for his siesta at 12
o'clock,which was the hour that best suited the camera. With a
skillon which he has never been complimented the photographer
sometimes got No. 3 nominally included in a wild-life picture when he
was really in a humdrum house kicking on the sofa.Thus in a scene
representing Nos. 1 and 2 sitting scowling outside the hut it is
untruly written that they scowled because 'their brother was within
singing and playing on a barbaric instrument. The music,' the unseen
No. 3 is represented as saying (obviously forestalling No. l), 'is
rude and to a cultured ear discordant, but the songs like those of
the Arabs are full of poetic imagery.' He was perhaps allowed to say
this sulkily on the sofa.</p>

<p>Though <i>The Boy Castaways</i> has sixteen chapter-headings,there
is no other letterpress; an absence which possible purchasers might
complain of, though there are surely worse ways of writing a book
than this. These headings anticipate much of the play of <i>Peter
Pan,</i> but there were many incidents of our Kensington Gardens days
that never got into the book, such asour Antarctic exploits when we
reached the Pole in advance of our friend Captain Scott and cut our
initials on it for himto find, a strange foreshadowing of what was
really to happen. In <i>The Boy Castaways</i> Captain Hook has
arrived but is called Captain Swarthy, and he seems from the pictures
to have been a black man. This character, as you do not need to be
told,is held by those in the know to be autobiographical. You had
many tussles with him (though you never, I think, got his right arm)
before you reached the terrible chapter (which might be taken from
the play) entitled 'We Board the Pirate Ship at Dawn&mdash;A Rakish
Craft&mdash;No. 1 Hew-them-Down and No. 2 of the Red Hatchet&mdash;A
Holocaust of Pirates&mdash;Rescue of Peter.' (Hullo, Peter rescued
instead of rescuing others? I know what that means and so do you, but
we are not going to give away all our secrets.) The scene of the
Holocaust is the Black Lake (afterwards, when we let women in, the
Mermaids'Lagoon). The pirate captain's end was not in the mouth of a
crocodile though we had crocodiles on the spot ('while No. 2 was
removing the crocodiles from the stream No. 1 shot a few parrots,
<i>Psittacidae,</i> for our evening meal'). I think our captain had
divers deaths owing to unseemly competition among you, each wanting
to slay him single-handed. On a special occasion, such as when No. 3
pulled out the tooth himself, you gave the deed to him, but took it
from him while he rested.The only pictorial representation in the
book of Swarthy's fate is in two parts. In one, called briefly 'We
string him up,' Nos.1 and 2, stern as Athos, are hauling him up a
tree by a rope,his face snarling as if it were a grinning mask (which
indeed it was), and his garments very like some of my own stuffed
with bracken. The other, the same scene next day, is called'The
Vultures had Picked him Clean,' and tells its own tale.</p>

<p>The dog in <i>The Boy Castaways</i> seems never to have been
called Nana but was evidently in training for that post. He
originally belonged to Swarthy (or to Captain Marryat? ), and the
first picture of him, lean, skulking, and hunched (how did I get that
effect?), 'patrolling the island' in the monster's interests, gives
little indication of the domestic paragon he was to become. We lured
him away to the better life, and there is, later, a touching picture,
a clear forecast of the Darling nursery, entitled 'We trained the dog
to watch over us while we slept.' In this he also is sleeping, in a
position that is a careful copy of his charges; indeed any trouble we
had with him was because, once he knew he was in a story, he thought
his safest course was to imitate you in everything you did. How
anxious he was to show that he understood the game, and more generous
than you, he never pretended that he was the one who killed Captain
Swarthy. I must not imply that he was entirely without initiative,
for it was his own idea to bark warningly a minute or two before
twelve o'clock as a signal to No. 3 that his keeper was probably on
her way for him (Disappearance of No. 3); and he became so used to
living in the world of Pretend that when we reached the hut of a
morning he was often there waiting for us, looking, it is true,
rather idiotic, but with a new bark he had invented which puzzled us
until we decided that he was demanding the password. He was always
willingto do any extra jobs, such as becoming the tiger in mask, and
when after a fierce engagement you carried home that mask in triumph,
he joined in the procession proudly and never let on that the trophy
had ever been part of him. Long afterwards he saw the play from a box
in the theatre, and as familiar scenes were unrolled before his eyes
I have never seen a dog so bothered. At one matinee we even let him
for a moment take the place of the actor who played Nana, and I don't
know that any members of the audience ever noticed the change, though
he introduced some 'business' that was new to them but old to you and
me. Heigh-ho, I suspect that in this reminiscence I am mixing him up
with his successor, for such a one there had to be, the loyal
Newfoundland who, perhaps in the following year, applied, so to say,
for the part by bringing hedgehogs tothe hut in his mouth as
offerings for our evening repasts. The head and coat of him were
copied for the Nana of the play.</p>

<p>They do seem to be emerging out of our island, don't they,the
little people of the play, all except that sly one, the chief figure,
who draws farther and farther into the wood as we advance upon him?
He so dislikes being tracked, as if there were something odd about
him, that when he dies he means to get up and blow away the particle
that will be his ashes.</p>

<p>Wendy has not yet appeared, but she has been trying to come ever
since that loyal nurse cast the humorous shaddw of woman upon the
scene and made us feel that it might be fun to let in a disturbing
element. Perhaps she would have bored her way in at last whether we
wanted her or not. It may be that even Peter did not really bring her
to the Never Land of his free will, but merely pretended to do so
because she would not stay away. Even Tinker Bell had reached our
island before we left it. It was one evening when we climbed the wood
carrying No. 4 to show him what the trail was like by twilight. As
our lanterns twinkled among the leaves No. 4 saw a twinkle stand
still for a moment and he waved his foot gaily to it, thus creating
Tink. It must not be thought, however,that there were any other
sentimental passages between No. 4 and Tink; indeed, as he got to
know her better he suspected her of frequenting the hut to see what
we had been having for supper, and to partake of the same, and he
pursued her with malignancy.</p>

<p>A safe but sometimes chilly way of recalling the past is to force
open a crammed drawer. If you are searching for anything in
particular you don't find it, but something falls out at the back
that is often more interesting. It is in this way that I get my
desultory reading, which includes the few stray leaves of the
original MS. of Peter that I have said I do possess,though even they,
when returned to the drawer, are gone again,as if that touch of
devilry lurked in them still. They show that in early days I hacked
at and added to the play. In the drawer I find some scraps of Mr.
Crook's delightful music, and other incomplete matter relating to
Peter. Here is the reply of a boy whom I favoured with a seat in my
box and injudiciously asked at the end what he had liked best. 'What
I think I liked best,' he said, 'was tearing up the programme and
dropping the bits on people's heads.' Thus am I often laid low. A
copy of my favourite programme of the play is still in the drawer. In
the first or second year of Peter No. 4 could not attend through
illness, so we took the play to his nursery, far away in the country,
an array of vehicles almost as glorious as a travelling circus; the
leading parts were played by the youngest children in the London
company, and No. 4, aged five, looked on solemnly at the performance
from his bed and never smiled once. That was my first and only
appearance on the real stage, and this copy of the programme shows I
was thought so meanly of as an actor that they printed my name in
smaller letters than the others.</p>

<p>I have said little here of Nos. 4 and 5, and it is high time I had
finished. They had a long summer day, and I turn round twice and now
they are off to school. On Monday, as it seems ,I was escorting No. 5
to a children's party and brushing his hair in the ante-room; and by
Thursday he is placing me against the wall of an underground station
and saying, 'Now I am going to get the tickets; don't move till I
come back for you or you'll lose yourself.' No. 4 jumps from being
astride my shoulders fishing, I knee-deep in the stream, to becoming,
while still a schoolboy, the sternest of my literary critics.
Anything he shook his head over I abandoned, and conceivably the
world has thus been deprived of masterpieces. There was for instance
an unfortunate little tragedy which I liked until I foolishly told
No. 4 its subject, when he frowned and said he had better have a look
at it. He read it, and then, patting me on the back, as only he and
No. 1 could touch me, said, 'You know you can't do this sort of
thing.' End of a tragedian. Sometimes, however, No. 4 liked my
efforts, and I walked in the azure that day when he returned <i>Dear
Brutus</i> to me with the comment 'Not so bad.' In earlier days, when
he was ten, I offered him the MS. of my book <i>Margaret Ogilvy.</i>
'Oh,thanks,' he said almost immediately, and added, 'Of course my
desk is awfully full.' I reminded him that he could take out some of
its more ridiculous contents. He said, 'I have read it already in the
book.' This I had not known, and I was secretly elated, but I said
that people sometimes liked to preserve this kind of thing as a
curiosity. He said 'Oh' again. I said tartly that he was not
compelled to take it if he didn't want it. He said, 'Of course I want
it, but my desk&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;' Then he wriggled out of the
room and came back in a few minutes dragging in No. 5 and announcing
triumphantly, 'No. 5 will have it.'</p>

<p>The rebuffs I have got from all of you! They were especially
crushing in those early days when one by one you came out of your
belief in fairies and lowered on me as the deceiver. My grandest
triumph, the best thing in the play of <i>Peter Pan</i> (though it is
not in it), is that long after No. 4 had ceased to believe, I brought
him back to the faith for at least two minutes. We were on our way in
a boat to fish the Outer Hebrides (where we caught <i>Mary Rose),</i>
and though it was a journey of days he wore his fishing basket on his
back all the time, soas to be able to begin at once. His one pain was
the absence of Johnny Mackay, for Johnny was the loved gillie of the
previous summer who had taught him everything that is worth knowing
(which is a matter of flies) but could not be with us this time as he
would have had to cross and re-cross Scotland to reach us. As the
boat drew near the Kyle of Lochalsh pier I told Nos. 4 and 5 it was
such a famous wishing pier that they had now but to wish and they
should have. No. 5 believed at once and expressed a wish to meet
himself (I afterwards found him on the pier searching faces
confidently), but No. 4 thought it more of my untimely nonsense and
doggedly declined to humour me. 'Whom do you want to see most, No.
4?' 'Ofcourse I would like most to see Johnny Mackay.' 'Well,
then,wish for him.' 'Oh, rot.' 'It can't do any harm to wish.'
Contemptuously he wished, and as the ropes were thrown on the pier he
saw Johnny waiting for him, loaded with angling paraphernalia. I know
no one less like a fairy than Johnny Mackay, but for two minutes No.
4 was quivering in another world than ours. When he came to he gave
me a smile which meant that we understood each other, and thereafter
neglected me for a month, being always with Johnny. As I have said,
this episode is not in the play; so though I dedicate <i>Peter
Pan</i>to you I keep the smile, with the few other broken fragments
of immortality that have come my way.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch1"></a>Act I</h2>

<h3>THE NURSERY</h3>

<p><i>The night nursery of the Darling family, which is the scene of
our opening Act, is at the top of a rather depressed street in
Bloomsbury. We have a right to place it where we will, and the reason
Bloomsbury is chosen is that Mr. Roget once lived there. So did we in
days when his</i> Thesaurus <i>was our only companion in London; and
we whom he has helped to wend our way through life have always wanted
to pay him a little compliment. The Darlings therefore lived in
Bloomsbury.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a corner house whose top window, the important one, looks
upon a leafy square from which Peter used to fly upto it, to the
delight of three children and no doubt the irritation of passers-by.
The street is still there, though the steaming sausage shop has gone;
and apparently the same cards perch now as then over the doors,
inviting homeless ones to come and stay with the hospitable
inhabitants. Since the days of the Darlings, however, a lick of paint
has been applied; and our corner house in particular, which has
swallowed its neighbour, blooms with awful freshness as if the
colours had been discharged upon it through a hose. Its card now says
'No children? meaning maybe that the goings-on of Wendy and her
brothers have given the house a bad name. As for ourselves, we have
not been in it since we went back to reclaim our old</i>
Thesaurus.</p>

<p><i>That is what we call the Darling house, but you may dump it
down anywhere you like, and if you think it was your house you are
very probably right. It wanders about London looking for anybody in
need of it, like the little house in the Never Land.</i></p>

<p><i>The blind (which is what Peter would have called the theatre
curtain if he had ever seen one) rises on that top room, a shabby
little room if Mrs. Darling had not made it the hub of creation by
her certainty that such it was, and adorned it to match with a loving
heart and all the scrapings of her purse. The door on the right leads
into the day nursery, which she has no right to have, but she made it
herself with nails in her mouth and a paste-pot in her hand. This is
the door the children will come in by. There are three beds and
(rather oddly) a large dog-kennel; two of these beds, with the
kennel, being on the left and the other on the right. The coverlets
of the beds (if visitors are expected) are made out of Mrs. Darling's
wedding-gown, which was such a grand affair that it still keeps them
pinched. Over each bed is a china house, the size of a linnet's nest,
containing a night-light. The fire, which is on our right, is burning
as discreetly as if it were in custody, which in a sense it is, for
supporting the mantelshelf are two wooden soldiers, home-made, begun
by Mr. Darling, finished by Mrs. Darling, repainted (unfortunately)
by John Darling. On the fire-guard hang incomplete parts of
children's night attire. The door the parents will come in by is on
the left. At the back is the bathroom door, with a cuckoo clock over
it; and in the centre is the window, which is at present ever so
staid and respectable, but half an hour hence (namely at 6.30 p.m.)
will be able to tell a very strange tale to the police.</i></p>

<p><i>The only occupant of the room at present is Nana the nurse,
reclining, not as you might expect on the one soft chair, but on the
floor. She is a Newfoundland dog, and though this may shock the
grandiose, the not exactly affluent will make allowances. The
Darlings could not afford to have a nurse, they could not afford
indeed to have children; and now you are beginning to understand how
they did it. Of course Nana has been trained by Mrs. Darling, but
like all treasures she was born to it. In this play we shall see her
chiefly inside the house, but she was just as exemplary outside,
escorting the two elders to school with an umbrella in her mouth, for
instance, and butting them back into line if they strayed.</i></p>

<p><i>The cuckoo clock strikes six, and Nana springs into life.This
first moment in the play is tremendously important, for if the actor
playing Nana does not spring properly we are undone. She will
probably be played by a boy, if one clever enough can be found, and
must never be on two legs except</i> <i>on those rare occasions when
an ordinary nurse would be on four. This Nana must go about all her
duties in a most ordinary manner, so that you know in your bones that
she performs them just so every evening at six; naturalness must be
her passion; indeed, it should be the aim of every one in the play,
for which she is now setting the pace. All the characters, whether
grown-ups or babes, must wear a child's outlook on life as their only
important adornment. If they cannot help being funny they are begged
to go away. A good motto for all would be 'The little less, and how
much it is.'</i></p>

<p><i>Nana, making much use of her mouth, 'turns down' the beds, and
carries the various articles on the fire-guard across to them. Then
pushing the bathroom door open, she is seen at work on the taps
preparing Michael's bath; after which she enters from the day nursery
with the youngest of the family on her back.</i></p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(obstreperous).</i> I won't go to bed, I won't, I
won't. Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Two minutes more, please, one
minute more? Nana, I won't be bathed, I tell you I will not be
bathed.</p>

<p><i>(Here the bathroom door closes on them, and</i> MRS. DARLING,
<i>who has perhaps heard his cry, enters the nursery. She is the
loveliest lady in Bloomsbury, with a sweet mocking mouth, and as she
is going out to dinner tonight she is already wearing her evening
gown because she knows her children like to see her in it. It is a
delicious confection made by herself out of nothing and other
people's mistakes. She does not often go out to dinner, preferring
when the children are in bed to sit beside them tidying up their
minds, just as if they were drawers. If</i> WENDY <i>and the boys
could keep awake they might see her repacking into their proper
places the many articles of the mind that have strayed during the
day, lingering humorously over some of their contents, wondering
where on earth they picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet
and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek and hurriedly stowing
that out of sight. When they wake in the morning the naughtinesses
with which they went to bed are not, alas, blown away, but they are
placed at the bottom of the drawer; and on the top, beautifully
aired, are their prettier thoughts ready forthe new day.</i></p>

<p><i>As she enters the room she is startled to see a strange little
face outside the window and a hand groping as if it wanted to come
in.)</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLlNG. Who are you? <i>(The unknown disappears; she hurries
to the window.)</i> No one there. And yet I feel sure I saw a face.
My children! <i>(She throws open the bathroom door and</i> MICHAEL'S
<i>head appears gaily over the bath. He splashes; she throws kisses
to him and closes the door.'Wendy, John,' she cries, and gets
reassuring answers from the day nursery. She sits down, relieved,
on</i> WENDY'S <i>bed; and</i> WENDY <i>and</i> JOHN <i>come in,
looking their smallest size, as children tend to do to a mother
suddenly in fear for them.)</i></p>

<p>JOHN <i>(histrionically).</i> We are doing an act; we are playing
at being you and father. <i>(He imitates the only father who has come
under his special notice.)</i> A little less noise there.</p>

<p>WENDY. Now let us pretend we have a baby.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(good-naturedly).</i> I am happy to inform you,
Mrs.Darling, that you are now a mother. (WENDY <i>gives way to
ecstasy.)</i> You have missed the chief thing; you haven't asked,
'boy or girl?'</p>

<p>WENDY. I am so glad to have one at all, I don't care which it
is.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(crushingly).</i> That is just the difference between
gentlemen and ladies. Now you tell me.</p>

<p>WENDY. I am happy to acquaint you, Mr. Darling, you are now a
father.</p>

<p>JOHN. Boy or girl?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(presenting herself).</i> Girl.</p>

<p>JOHN. Tuts.</p>

<p>WENDY. You horrid.</p>

<p>JOHN. Go on.</p>

<p>WENDY. I am happy to acquaint you, Mr. Darling, you are again a
father.</p>

<p>JOHN. Boy or girl?</p>

<p>WENDY. Boy. (JOHN <i>beams.)</i> Mummy, it's hateful of him.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(MICHAEL <i>emerges from the bathroom in</i> JOHN'S
<i>old pyjamas and giving his face a last wipe with the
towel.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(expanding).</i> Now, John, have me.</p>

<p>JOHN. We don't want any more.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(contracting).</i> Am I not to be born at all?</p>

<p>JOHN. Two is enough.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(wheedling).</i> Come, John; boy, John.
<i>(Appalled)</i> Nobody wants me!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I do.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(with a glimmer of hope).</i> Boy or girl?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(with one of those happy thoughts of hers).</i>
Boy.<br></p>

<blockquote>(<i>Triumph of</i> MICHAEL; <i>discomfiture of</i> JOHN.
MR.DARLING <i>arrives, in no mood unfortunately to gloat over this
domestic scene. He is really a good man as breadwinners go, and it is
hard luck for him to be propelled into the room now, when if we had
brought him in a few minutes earlier or later he might have made a
fairer impression. In the city where he sits on a stool all day, as
fixed as a postage stamp, he is so like all the others on stools that
you recognise him not by his face but by his stool, but at home the
way to gratify him is to say that he has a distinct personality. He
is very conscientious, and in the days when</i> MRS. DARLING <i>gave
up keeping the house books correctly and drew pictures instead (which
he called her guesses), he did all the totting up for her, holding
her hand while he calculated whether they could have Wendy or not,
and coming down on the right side. It is with regret, therefore, that
we introduce him as a tornado, rushing into the nursery in evening
dress, but without his coat, and brandishing in his hand a
recalcitrant white tie.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(implying that he has searched for her everywhere
and that the nursery is a strange place in which to find her).</i>
Oh, here you are, Mary.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(knowing at once what is the matter).</i> What is
the matter, George dear?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(as if the word were monstrous).</i> Matter! This
tie, it will not tie. <i>(He waxes sarcastic.)</i> Not round my neck.
Round the bed-post, oh yes; twenty times have I made it up round the
bed-post, but round my neck, oh dear no; begs to be excused.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(in a joyous transport).</i> Say it again, father, say
it again!</p>

<p>MR. DARLING (<i>witheringly</i>). Thank you. <i>(Goaded by
asuspiciously crooked smile on</i> MRS. DARLING'S <i>face)</i> I warn
you, Mary, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't goout to
dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night I never go
to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again you and I
starve, and our children will be thrown into the streets.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The children blanch as they grasp the gravity of the
situation.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Let me try, dear.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(In a terrible silence their progeny cluster round
them. Will she succeed? Their fate depends on it. She
fails</i>&mdash;<i>no, she succeeds. In another moment they are
wildly gay, romping round the room on each other's shoulders. Father
is even a better horse than mother.</i> MICHAEL <i>is dropped upon
his bed,</i> WENDY <i>retires to prepare for hers,</i> JOHN <i>runs
from</i> NANA, <i>who has reappeared with the bath
towel.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN <i>(rebellious).</i> I won't be bathed. You needn't think
it.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(in the grand manner).</i> Go and be bathed at
once, sir.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(With bent head</i> JOHN <i>follows</i> NANA <i>into
the bathroom.</i> MR. DARLING <i>swells.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(as he is put between the sheets).</i> Mother, how did
you get to know me?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. A little less noise there.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(growing solemn).</i> At what time was I born,
mother?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. At two o'clock in the night-time, dearest.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Oh, mother, I hope I didn't wake you.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. They are rather sweet, don't you think,George?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(doting).</i> There is not their equal on earth,
and they are ours, ours!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Unfortunately</i> NANA <i>has come from the bathroom
for a sponge and she collides with his trousers<sub>)</sub> the first
pair</i> <i>he has ever had with braid on them.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING. Mary, it is too bad; just look at this; covered with
hairs. Clumsy, clumsy!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(NANA <i>goes, a drooping figure.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Let me brush you, dear.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Once more she is successful. They are now by the
fire, and</i> MICHAEL <i>is in bed doing idiotic things with a teddy
bear.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(depressed).</i> I sometimes think, Mary, that it
is a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. George, Nana is a treasure.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. No doubt; but I have an uneasy feeling at times that
she looks upon the children as puppies.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(rather faintly).</i> Oh no, dear one, I am sure
she knows they have souls.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(profoundly).</i> I wonder, I wonder.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The opportunity has come for her to tell him of
something that is on her mind.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. George, we must keep Nana. I will tell you why.
<i>(Her seriousness impresses him.)</i> My dear, when I came into
this room to-night I saw a face at the window.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(incredulous). A</i> face at the window, three
floors up? Pooh!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. It was the face of a little boy; he was trying to
get in. George, this is not the first time I have seen that boy.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(beginning to think that this may be a man's
job).</i> Oho!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(making sure that</i> MICHAEL <i>does not
hear).</i> The first time was a week ago. It was Nana's night out,
and I had been drowsing here by the fire when suddenly I felt a
draught, as if the window were open. I looked round and I saw that
boy&mdash;in the room.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. In the room?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I screamed. Just then Nana came back and she at once
sprang at him. The boy leapt for the window. She pulled down the sash
quickly, but was too late to catch him.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(who knows he would not have been too late).</i> I
thought so!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Wait. The boy escaped, but his shadow had not time
to get out; down came the window and cut it clean off.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(heavily).</i> Mary, Mary, why didn't you keep that
shadow?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(scoring).</i> I did. I rolled it up, George; and
here it is.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She produces it from a drawer. They unroll and
examine the flimsy thing, which is not more material than a puff of
smoke, and if let go would probably float into the ceiling without
discolouring it. Yet it has human shape. As they nod their heads over
it they present the most satisfying picture on earth, two happy
parents conspiring cosily by the fire for the good of their
children.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING. It is nobody I know, but he does look ascoundrel.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I think he comes back to get his shadow,George.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(meaning that the miscreant has now a father to
deal with).</i> I dare say. <i>(He sees himself telling the story to
the other stools at the office.)</i> There is money in this, my love.
I shall take it to the British Museum to-morrow and have it
priced.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The shadow is rolled up and replaced in the
drawer.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(like a guilty person).</i> George, I have not
told you all; I am afraid to.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(who knows exactly the right moment to treat a
woman as a beloved child).</i> Cowardy, cowardy custard.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(pouting).</i> No, I 'm not.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Oh yes, you are.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. George, I 'm not.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Then why not tell? <i>(Thus cleverly soothed she goes
on.)</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. The boy was not alone that first time. He was
accompanied by&mdash;I don't know how to describe it; by a ball of
light, not as big as my fist, but it darted about the room like a
living thing.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(though open-minded).</i> That is very unusual. It
escaped with the boy?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Yes. <i>(Sliding her hand into his.)</i> George,
what can all this mean?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(ever ready).</i> What indeed!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This intimate scene is broken by the return of</i>
NANA <i>with a bottle in her mouth.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(at once dissembling).</i> What is that, Nana? Ah,
of course; Michael, it is your medicine.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(promptly).</i> Won't take it.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(recalling his youth).</i> Be a man, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Won't.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(weakly).</i> I'll get you a lovely chocky to take
after it. <i>(She leaves the room, though her husband calls after
her.)</i></p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Mary, don't pamper him. When I was your age, Michael,
I took medicine without a murmur. I said 'Thank you, kind parents,
for giving me bottles to make me well.'<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(WENDY, <i>who has appeared in her nightgown, hears this
and believes.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. That medicine you sometimes take is much nastier, isn't it,
father?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(valuing her support).</i> Ever so much nastier.And
as an example to you, Michael, I would take it now
<i>(thankfully)</i> if I hadn't lost the bottle.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(always glad to be of service).</i> I know where itis,
father. I'll fetch it.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She is gone before he can stop her. He turns for help
to</i> JOHN, <i>who has come from the bathroom attired for
bed.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING. John, it is the most beastly stuff. It is that sticky
sweet kind.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(who is perhaps still playing at parents).</i> Never mind,
father, it will soon be over.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(A spasm of ill-will to</i> JOHN <i>cuts through</i>
MR. DARLING, <i>and is gone.</i> WENDY <i>returns
panting.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Here it is, father; I have been as quick as I could.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(with a sarcasm that is completely thrown away on
her).</i> You have been wonderfully quick, precious quick!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He is now at the foot of</i> MICHAEL'S <i>bed,</i>
NANA <i>is by its side, holding the medicine spoon insinuatingly in
her mouth.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(proudly, as she pours out</i> MR. DARLING'S
<i>medicine).</i> Michael, now you will see how father takes it.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(hedging).</i> Michael first.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(full of unworthy suspicions).</i> Father first.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. It will make me sick, you know.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(lightly).</i> Come on, father.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Hold your tongue, sir.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(disturbed).</i> I thought you took it quite easily,
father, saying 'Thank you, kind parents,
for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. That is not the point; the point is that there is
more in my glass than in Michael's spoon. It isn't fair, I swear
though it were with my last breath, it is not fair.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(coldly).</i> Father, I'm waiting.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. It's all very well to say you are waiting; soam I
waiting.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Father 's a cowardy custard.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. So are you a cowardy custard.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They are now glaring at each other.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL. I am not frightened.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Neither am I frightened.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Well, then, take it.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Well, then, you take it.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(butting in again).</i> Why not take it at the same
time?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(haughtily).</i> Certainly. Are you ready,
Michael?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(as nothing has happened).</i>
One&mdash;two&mdash;three.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(MICHAEL <i>partakes, but</i> MR. DARLING <i>resorts to
hanky-panky.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN. Father hasn't taken his!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(MICHAEL <i>howls.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(inexpressibly pained).</i> Oh father!</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(who has been hiding the glass behind him).</i>What
do you mean by 'oh father'? Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take
mine but I&mdash;missed it. (NANA <i>shakes her head sadly over him,
and goes into the bathroom. They are all looking as if they did not
admire him, and nothing so dashes a temperamental man.)</i> I say, I
have just thought of a splendid joke. <i>(They brighten.)</i> I shall
pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she will drink it thinking it
is milk! <i>The pleasantry does not appeal, but he prepares the joke,
listening for appreciation.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Poor darling Nana!</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. You silly little things; to your beds everyone of
you; I am ashamed of you.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They steal to their beds as</i> MRS. DARLING
<i>returns with the chocolate.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Well, is it all over?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Father didn't&mdash;&mdash;<i>(Father glares.)</i></p>

<p>MR. DARLING. All over, dear, quite satisfactorily. (NANA <i>comes
back.)</i> Nana, good dog, good girl; I have put a little milk into
your bowl. <i>(The bowl is by the kennel, and</i> NANA <i>begins to
lap, only begins. She retreats into the kennel.)</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. What is the matter, Nana?</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(uneasily).</i> Nothing, nothing.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(smelling the bowl).</i> George, it is your
medicine!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The children break into lamentation. He gives his
wife an imploring look; he is begging for one smile, but does not get
it. In consequence he goes from bad to worse.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING. It was only a joke. Much good my wearing myself to
the bone trying to be funny in this house.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(on her knees by the kennel).</i> Father, Nana is
crying.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Coddle her; nobody coddles me. Oh dear no. I am only
the bread-winner, why should I be coddled? Why, why, why?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. George, not so loud; the servants will hearyou.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(There is only one maid, absurdly small too, but they
have got into the way of calling her the servants.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(defiant).</i> Let them hear me; bring in the whole
world. ( <i>The desperate man, who has not been in fresh air for
days, has now lost all self-control.)</i> I refuse to allow that dog
to lord it in my nursery for one hour longer. (NANA <i>supplicates
him.)</i> In vain, in vain, the proper place for you is the yard, and
there you go to be tied up this instant.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(NANA <i>again retreats into the kennel, and the children
add their prayers to hers.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(who knows how contrite he will be for this
presently).</i> George, George, remember what I told you about that
boy.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. Am I master in this house or is she? <i>(To</i> NANA
<i>fiercely)</i> Come along. <i>(He thunders at her, but she
indicates that she has reasons not worth troubling him with for
remaining where she is. He resorts to a false bonhomie.)</i> There,
there, did she think he was angry with her, poor Nana? <i>(She
wriggles a response in the affirmative.)</i> Good Nana, pretty Nana.
<i>(She has seldom been called pretty, and it has the old effect. She
plays rub-a-dub with her paws, which is how a dog blushes.)</i> She
will come to her kind master, won't she? won't she? <i>(She advances,
retreats, waggles her head, her tail, and eventually goes to him. He
seizes her collar in an iron grip and amid the cries of his progeny
drags her from the room. They listen, for her remonstrances are not
inaudible.)</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Be brave, my dears.</p>

<p>WENDY. He is chaining Nana up!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This unfortunately is what he is doing, though we
cannot see him. Let us hope that he then retires to his study, looks
up the word 'temper' in his</i> Thesaurus, <i>and under the influence
of those benign pages becomes a better man. In the meantime the
children have been put to bed in unwonted silence, and</i> MRS.
DARLING <i>lights the night-lights over the beds.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN <i>(as the barking below goes on).</i> She is awfully
unhappy.</p>

<p>WENDY. That is not Nana's unhappy bark. That is her bark when she
smells danger.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(remembering that boy).</i> Danger! Are you sure,
Wendy?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(the one of the family, for there is one in every family,
who can be trusted to know or not to know).</i> Oh yes.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Her mother looks this way and that from the
window.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN. Is anything there?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. All quite quiet and still. Oh, how I wish I was not
going out to dinner to-night.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are
lit?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Nothing precious. They are the eyes amother leaves
behind her to guard her children.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Nevertheless we may be sure she means to tell</i>
LIZA, <i>the little maid, to look in on them frequently till she
comes home. She goes from bed to bed, after her custom, tucking them
in and crooning a lullaby.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(drowsily).</i> Mother, I 'm glad of you.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(with a last look round, her hand on the
switch).</i> Dear night-lights that protect my sleeping babes, burn
clear and steadfast to-night.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The nursery darkens and she is gone, intentionally
leaving the door ajar. Something uncanny is going to happen, we
expect, for a quiver has passed through the room, just sufficient to
touch the night-lights. They blink three times one after the other
and go out, precisely as children (whom familiarity has made them
resemble) fall asleep. There is another light in the room now, no
larger than</i> MRS. DARLING'S <i>fist, and in the time we have taken
to say this it has been into the drawers and wardrobe and searched
pockets, as it darts about looking for a certain shadow. Then the
window is blown open, probably by the smallest and therefore most
mischievous star, and</i> PETER PAN <i>flies into the room. In so far
as he is dressed at all it is in autumn leaves and
cobwebs.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER (in <i>a whisper).</i> Tinker Bell, Tink, are you there?
<i>(A jug lights up.)</i> Oh, do come out of that jug.
(TINK <i>flashes hither and thither?)</i> Do you know where they put
it? <i>(The answer comes as of a tinkle of bells; it is the fairy
language.</i> PETER <i>can speak it, but it bores him.)</i> Which big
box? This one? But which drawer? Yes, do show me. (TINK <i>pops into
the drawer where the shadow is, but before</i>PETER <i>can reach
it,</i> WENDY <i>moves in her sleep. He flies onto the mantelshelf as
a hiding-place. Then, as she has not waked, he flutters over the beds
as an easy way to observe the occupants, closes the window softly,
wafts himself to the drawer and scatters its contents to the floor,
as kings on their wedding day toss ha'pence to the crowd. In his joy
at finding his shadow he forgets that he has shut up</i> TINK <i>in
the drawer. He sits on the floor with the shadow, confident that he
and it will join like drops of water. Then he tries to stick it on
with soap from the bathroom, and this failing also, he subsides
dejectedly on the floor. This wakens</i> WENDY, <i>who sits up, and
is pleasantly interested to see a stranger.)</i></p>

<p><i>WENDY (courteously).</i> Boy, why are you crying?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He jump up, and crossing to the foot of the bed bows
to her in the fairy way.</i> WENDY, <i>impressed, bows to him from
the bed.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. What is your name?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(well satisfied).</i> Wendy Moira Angela Darling.What is
yours?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(finding it lamentably brief).</i> Peter Pan.</p>

<p>WENDY. Is that all?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(biting his lip).</i> Yes.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(politely).</i> I am so sorry.</p>

<p>PETER. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>WENDY. Where do you live?</p>

<p>PETER. Second to the right and then straight on till morning.</p>

<p>WENDY. What a funny address!</p>

<p>PETER. No, it isn't.</p>

<p>WENDY. I mean, is that what they put on the letters?</p>

<p>PETER. Don't get any letters.</p>

<p>WENDY. But your mother gets letters?</p>

<p>PETER. Don't have a mother.</p>

<p>WENDY. Peter!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She leaps out of bed to put her arms round him, but
he draws back; he does not know why, but he knows he must draw
back.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. You mustn't touch me.</p>

<p>WENDY. Why?</p>

<p>PETER. No one must ever touch me.</p>

<p>WENDY. Why?</p>

<p>PETER. I don't know.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He is never touched by any one in the
play.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. No wonder you were crying.</p>

<p>PETER. I wasn't crying. But I can't get my shadow to stick on.</p>

<p>WENDY. It has come off! How awful. <i>(Looking at the spot where
he had lain.)</i> Peter, you have been trying to stick it on with
soap!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(snappily).</i> Well then?</p>

<p>WENDY. It must be sewn on.</p>

<p>PETER. What is 'sewn'?</p>

<p>WENDY. You are dreadfully ignorant.</p>

<p>PETER. No, I 'm not.</p>

<p>WENDY. I will sew it on for you, my little man. But we must have
more light. <i>(She touches something, and to his astonishment the
room is illuminated.)</i> Sit here. I dare say it will hurt a
little.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(a recent remark of hers rankling).</i> I never cry.
<i>(She seems to attach the shadow. He tests the combination.)</i> It
isn't quite itself yet.</p>

<p>WENDY. Perhaps I should have ironed it. <i>(It awakes and is as
glad to be back with him as he to have it. He and his shadow dance
together. He is showing off now. He crows</i> <i>like a cock. He
would fly in order to impress</i> WENDY <i>further</i> <i>if he knew
that there is anything unusual in that.)</i></p>

<p>PETER. Wendy, look, look; oh the cleverness of me!</p>

<p>WENDY. You conceit, of course I did nothing!</p>

<p>PETER. You did a little.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(wounded).</i> A little! If I am no use I can at least
withdraw.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(With one haughty leap she is again in bed with the
sheet over her face. Popping on to the end of the bed the artful one
appeals.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Wendy,. don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when
I'm pleased with myself. Wendy, one girl is worth more than twenty
boys.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(peeping over the sheet).</i> You really think so,
Peter?</p>

<p>PETER. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>WENDY. I think it's perfectly sweet of you, and I shall get up
again. <i>(They sit together on the side of the bed.)</i> I shall
give you a kiss if you like.</p>

<p>PETER. Thank you. <i>(He holds out his hand.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(aghast).</i> Don't you know what a kiss is?</p>

<p>PETER. I shall know when you give it me. <i>(Not to hurt his
feelings she gives him her thimble.)</i> Now shall I give youa
kiss?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(primly).</i> If you please. <i>(He pulls an acorn button
off his person and bestows it on her. She is shocked but
considerate.)</i> I will wear it on this chain round my neck. Peter,
how old are you?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(blithely).</i> I don't know, but quite young, Wendy. I
ran away the day I was born.</p>

<p>WENDY. Ran away, why?</p>

<p>PETER. Because I heard father and mother talking of what I was to
be when I became a man. I want always to be a little boy and to have
fun; so I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long time among
the fairies.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(with great eyes).</i> You know fairies, Peter!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(surprised that this should be a recommendation).</i>
Yes, but they are nearly all dead now. <i>(Baldly)</i> You see,
Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh
broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about, and
that was the beginning of fairies. And now when every new baby is
born its first laugh becomes a fairy. So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy or girl,</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(breathlessly).</i> Ought to be? Isn't there?</p>

<p>PETER. Oh no. Children know such a lot now. Soon they don't
believe in fairies, and every time a child says 'I don't believe in
fairies' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead. <i>(He
skips about heartlessly.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Poor things!</p>

<p>PETER. (<i>to whom this statement recalls a forgotten friend)</i>.
I can't think where she has gone. Tinker Bell, Tink, where are
you?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(thrilling).</i> Peter, you don't mean to tell me that
there is a fairy in this room!</p>

<p>PETER (<i>flitting about in search</i>). She came with me. You
don't hear anything, do you?</p>

<p>WENDY. I hear&mdash;the only sound I hear is like a tinkle of
bells.</p>

<p>PETER. That is the fairy language. I hear it too.</p>

<p>WENDY. It seems to come from over there.</p>

<p>PETER. (<i>with shameless glee.</i>) Wendy, I believe I shut her
up in that drawer!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He releases</i> TINK, <i>who darts about in a fury
using language it is perhaps as well we don't
understand.)</i></blockquote>

<p>You needn't say that; I 'm very sorry, but how could I know you were
in the drawer?

<p>WENDY <i>(her eyes dancing in pursuit of the delicious
creature).</i> Oh, Peter, if only she would stand still and let me
see her!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(indifferently).</i> They hardly ever stand still.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(To show that she can do even this</i> TINK <i>pauses
between two ticks of the cuckoo clock.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. I see her, the lovely! where is she now?</p>

<p>PETER. She is behind the clock. Tink, this lady wishes you were
her fairy. <i>(The answer comes immediately.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. What does she say?</p>

<p>PETER. She is not very polite. She says you are a great ugly girl,
and that she is my fairy. You know, Tink, you can't be my fairy
because I am a gentleman and you are a lady.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(TINK <i>replies.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>WENDY. What did she say?</p>

<p>PETER. She said 'You silly ass.' She is quite a common girl, you
know. She is called Tinker Bell because she mends the fairy pots and
kettles.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(<i>They have reached a chair,</i> WENDY <i>in the
ordinary way and</i> PETER <i>through a hole in the
back.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Where do you live now?</p>

<p>PETER. With the lost boys.</p>

<p>WENDY. Who are they?</p>

<p>PETER. They are the children who fall out of their prams when the
nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days
they are sent far away to the Never-Land. I 'm captain.</p>

<p>WENDY. What fun it must be.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(craftily).</i> Yes, but we are rather lonely. You see,
Wendy, we have no female companionship.</p>

<p>WENDY. Are none of the other children girls?</p>

<p>PETER. Oh no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of
their prams.</p>

<p>WENDY. Peter, it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls.
John there just depises us.<br>
(PETER, <i>for the first time, has a good look at</i> JOHN. <i>He
then neatly tumbles him out of bed.)</i></p>

<p>You wicked! you are not captain here. <i>(She bends over her
brother who is prone on the floor.)</i> After all he hasn't wakened,
and you meant to be kind. <i>(Having now done her duty she
forgets</i> JOHN, <i>who blissfully sleep on.)</i> Peter, you may
give me a kiss.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(cynically).</i> I thought you would want it back. <i>(He
offers her the thimble.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(artfully).</i> Oh dear, I didn't mean a kiss, Peter. I
meant a thimble.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(only half placated).</i>What is that?</p>

<p>WENDY. It is like this. <i>(She leans forward to give a
demonstration, but something prevents the meeting of their
faces.)</i></p>

<p>PETER <i>(satisfied).</i> Now shall I give you a thimble?</p>

<p>WENDY. If you please. <i>(Before he can even draw near she
screams.)</i></p>

<p>PETER. What is it?</p>

<p>WENDY. It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hairl</p>

<p>PETER. That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty
before.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINK <i>speaks. She is in the jug
again.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. What does she say?</p>

<p>PETER. She says she will do that every time I give you a
thimble.</p>

<p>WENDY. But why?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(equally nonplussed).</i> Why, Tink? <i>(He has to
translate the answer.)</i> She said 'You silly ass' again.</p>

<p>WENDY. She is very impertinent. <i>(They are sitting on the floor
now.)</i> Peter, why did you come to our nursery window?</p>

<p>PETER. To try to hear stories None of us knows any stories.</p>

<p>WENDY. How perfectly awful!</p>

<p>PETER. Do you know why swallows build in the eaves of houses? It
is to listen to the stories. Wendy, your mother was telling you such
a lovely story.</p>

<p>WENDY. Which story was it?</p>

<p>PETER. About the prince, and he couldn't find the lady who wore
the glass slipper.</p>

<p>WENDY. That was Cinderella. Peter, he found her and they were
happy ever after.</p>

<p>PETER. I am glad. <i>(They have worked their way along the floor
close to each other, but he now jumps up.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Where are you going?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(already on his way to the window).</i> To tell the other
boys.</p>

<p>WENDY. Don't go, Peter. I know lots of stories. The stories I
could tell to the boys!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(gleaming).</i> Come on! We'll fly.</p>

<p>WENDY. Fly? You can fly!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(How he would like to rip those stories out of her; he
is dangerous now.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Wendy, come with me.</p>

<p>WENDY. Oh dear, I mustn't. Think of mother. Besides, I can't
fly.</p>

<p>PETER. I'll teach you.</p>

<p>WENDY. How lovely to fly!</p>

<p>PETER. I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back and then away
we go. Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be
flying about with me, saying funny things tothe stars. There are
mermaids, Wendy, with long tails. <i>(She just succeeds in remaining
on the nursery floor.)</i> Wendy, how we should all respect you.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(At this she strikes her colours.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Of course it's awfully fascinating! Would you teach John
and Michael to fly too?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(indifferently).</i> If you like.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(playing rum-turn on</i> JOHN). John, wake up; there is a
boy here who is to teach us to fly.</p>

<p>JOHN. Is there? Then I shall get up. <i>(He raises his headfrom
the floor.)</i> Hullo, I am up!</p>

<p>WENDY. Michael, open your eyes. This boy is to teach us to
fly.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The sleepers are at once as awake as their father's
razor;but before a question can be asked</i> NANA'S <i>bark is
heard.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN. Out with the light, quick, hide!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(When the maid</i> LIZA, <i>who is so small that when
she says she will never see ten again one can scarcely believe her,
enters with a firm hand on the troubled</i> NANA'S <i>chain the room
is in comparative darkness.)</i></blockquote>

<p>LIZA. There, you suspicious brute, they are perfectly safe, aren't
they? Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to
their gentle breathing. (NANA'S <i>sense of smell here helps to her
undoing instead of hindering it. She knows that they are in the
room.</i> MICHAEL, <i>who is behind the window curtain, is so
encouraged by</i> LIZA'S <i>last remark that he breathes too
loudly.</i> NANA <i>knows that kind of breathing and tries to break
from her keeper's control.)</i> No more of it, Nana. <i>(Wagging a
finger at her)</i> I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight
for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then
won't master whip you just! Come along, you naughty dog.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(The unhappy</i> NANA is <i>led away. The children emerge
exulting from their various hiding-places. In their brief absence
from the scene strange things have been done to them; but it is not
for us to reveal a mysterious secret of the stage. They look just the
same.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>JOHN. I say, can you really fly.</p>

<p>PETER. Look! <i>(He is now over their heads.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Oh, how sweet!</p>

<p>PETER. I 'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(It looks so easy that they try it first from the
floor <b>and</b>then from their beds, without encouraging
results.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN <i>(rubbing his knees).</i> How do you do it?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(descending).</i> You just think lovely wonderful
thoughts and they lift you up in the air. <i>(He is off
again.)</i></p>

<p>JOHN. You are so nippy at it; couldn't you do it very slowly once?
(PETER <i>does it slowly.)</i> I 've got it now, Wendy. <i>(He tries;
no, he has not got it, poor stay-at-home, though he knows the names
of all the counties in England and</i> PETER <i>does not know
one.)</i></p>

<p>PETER. I must blow the fairy dust on you first. <i>(Fortunately
his garments are smeared with it and he blows some dust on each.)</i>
Now, try; try from the bed. Just wiggle your shoulders this way, and
then let go.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The gallant</i> MICHAEL <i>is the first to let go,
and is borne across the room.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(with a yell that should have disturbed</i> LIZA). I
flewed!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(JOHN <i>lets go, and meets</i> WENDY <i>near the
bathroom door though they had both aimed in an opposite
direction.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Oh, lovely!</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(tending to be upside down).</i> How ripping!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(playing whack on a chair).</i> I do like it!</p>

<p>THE THREE. Look at me, look at me, look at me!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They are not nearly so elegant in the air as</i>
PETER, <i>but their heads have bumped the ceiling, and there is
nothing more delicious than that.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN <i>(who can even go backwards).</i> I say, why shouldn't we
go out?</p>

<p>PETER. There are pirates.</p>

<p>JOHN. Pirates! <i>(He grabs his tall Sunday hat.)</i> Let us go at
once!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINK <i>does not like it. She darts at their hair. From
down below in the street the lighted window must present an unwonted
spectacle: the shadows of children revolving in the room like a
merry-go-round. This is perhaps what</i> MR. <i>and</i> MRS. DARLING
<i>see as they come hurrying home from the party, brought by</i> NANA
<i>who, you may be sure, has broken her chain.</i> PETER'S
<i>accomplice, the little star, has seen them coming, and again the
window blows open.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(as if he had heard the star whisper 'Cave').</i> Now
come!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(Breaking the circle he flies out of the window over the trees
of the square and over the house-tops, and the others follow like a
flight of birds. The broken-hearted father and mother arrive just in
time to get a nip from TINK as she too sets out for the Never
Land.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr><h2><a name="ch2"></a>ACT II</h2>

<h3>THE NEVER LAND</h3>

<p><i>When the blind goes up all is so dark that you scarcely know it
has gone up. This is because if you were to see the island bang</i>
(<i>as Peter would say) the wonders of it might hurt your eyes. If
you all came in spectacles perhaps you could see it bang, but to make
a rule of that kind would be a pity. The first thing seen is merely
some whitish dots trudging along the sward, and you can guess from
their tinkling that they are probably fairies of the commoner sort
going home afoot from some party and having a cheery tiff by the way.
Then Peter's star wakes up, and in the blink of it, which is much
stronger than in our stars, you can make out masses of trees, and you
think you see wild beasts stealing past to drink, though what you see
is not the beasts themselves but only the shadows of them. They are
really out pictorially to greet Peter in the way they think he would
like them to greet him; and for the same reason the mermaids basking
in the lagoon beyond the trees are carefully combing their hair; and
for the same reason the pirates are landing invisibly from the
longboat, invisibly to you but not to the redskins, whom none can see
or hear because they are on the war-path. The whole island, in short,
which has been having a slack time in Peter's absence, is now in a
ferment because the tidings has leaked out that he is on his way
back; and everybody and everything know that they will catch it from
him if they don't give satisfaction. While you have been told this
the sun (another of his servants) has been bestirring himself. Those
of you who may have thought it wiser after all to begin this Act in
spectacles may now take them off.</i></p>

<p><i>What you see is the Never Land. You have often half seen it
before, or even three-quarters, after the night-lights were lit, and
you might then have beached your coracle on it if you had not always
at the great moment fallen asleep. I dare say you have chucked things
on to it, the things you can't find in the morning. In the daytime
you think the Never Land is only make-believe, and so it is to the
likes of you, but this is the Never Land come true. It is an open-air
scene, a forest, with a beautiful lagoon beyond but not really far
away, for the Never Land is very compact, not large and sprawly with
tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely
crammed. It is summer time on the trees and on the lagoon but winter
on the river, which is not remarkable on Peter's island where all the
four seasons may pass while you are filling a jug at the well.
Peter's home is at this very spot, but you could not point out the
way into it even if you were told which is the entrance, not even if
you were told that there are seven of them. You know now because you
have just seen one of the lost boys emerge. Theholes in these seven
great hollow trees are the 'doors' down to Peter's home, and he made
seven because, despite his cleverness, he thought seven boys must
need seven doors.</i></p>

<p><i>The boy who has emerged from his tree is Slightly, who has
perhaps been driven from the abode below by companions less musical
than himself. Quite possibly a genius Slightly has with him his
home-made whistle to which he capers entrancingly, with no audience
save a Never ostrich which is also musically inclined. Unable to
imitate Slightly's graces the bird falls so low as to burlesque them
and is driven from the entertainment. Other lost boys climb up the
trunks or drop from branches, and now we see the six of them, all in
the skins of animals they think they have shot, and so round and
furry in them that if they fall they roll. Tootles is not the least
brave though the most unfortunate of this gallant band. He has been
in fewer adventures than any of them because the big things
constantly happen while he has stepped round the corner; he will go
off, for instance, in some quiet hour to gather firewood, and then
when he returns the others will be sweeping up the blood. Instead of
souring his nature this has sweetened it and he is the humblest of
the band. (Nibs is more gay and debonair, Slightly more conceited.
Slightly thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with their
manners and customs.</i> <i>Curly is a pickle, and so often has he
had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, 'Stand forth
the one who did this thing,' that now he stands forth whether he has
done it or not. The other two are First Twin and Second Twin, who
cannot be described because we should probably be describing the
wrong one. Hunkering on the ground or peeking out of their holes, the
six are not unlike village gossips gathered round the pump.</i></p>

<p>TOOTLES. Has Peter come back yet, Slightly?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(with a solemnity that he thinks suits the
occasion).</i> No, Tootles, no.<br>
</p>

<p>CURLY <i>(as if Peter might be listening).</i> I do wish he would
come back.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. I am always afraid of the pirates when Peter is not here
to protect us.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. I am not afraid of pirates. Nothing frightens me. But I
do wish Peter would come back and tell us whether he has heard
anything more about Cinderella.</p>

<p>SECOND TWIN <i>(with diffidence).</i> Slightly, I dreamt last
night that the prince found Cinderella.</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(who is intellectually the superior of the two).</i>
Twin, I think you should not have dreamt that, for I didn't, and
Peter may say we oughtn't to dream differently, being twins, you
know.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. I am awfully anxious about Cinderella. You see, not
knowing anything about my own mother I am fond of thinking that she
was rather like Cinderella.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This is received with derision.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. All I remember about my mother is that she often said to
father, 'Oh how I wish I had a cheque book of my own.' I don't know
what a cheque book is, but I should just love to give my mother
one.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(as usual).</i> My mother was fonder of me than your
mothers were of you. <i>(Uproar.)</i> Oh yes, she was. Peter had to
make up names for you, but my mother had wrote my name on the
pinafore I was lost in. 'Slightly Soiled'; that's my name.<br>

<p><i>The pirates appear upon the frozen river dragging a raft, on
which reclines among cushions that dark and fearful man,</i> CAPTAIN
JAS. HOOK. <i>A more villainous-looking brotherhood of men never hung
in a row on Execution dock. Here, his great arms bare, pieces of
eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome</i> CECCO, <i>who cut
his name on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. Heavier in
the pull is the gigantic black who has had many names since the first
one terrified dusky children on the banks of the</i> Guidjo-mo. BILL
JUKES <i>comes next, every inch of him tattooed, the same</i> JUKES
<i>who got six dozen on the</i> Walrus <i>from</i> FLINT.
<i>Following these</i> are COOKSON, <i>said to be</i> BLACK. MURPHY'S
<i>brother (but this was never proved);</i> and GENTLEMAN STARKEY,
<i>once an usher in a school; and</i> SKYLIGHTS <i>(Morgan's
Skylights); and</i> NOODLER, <i>whose hands are fixed on backwards;
and the spectacled boatswain,</i> SMEE, <i>the only Nonconformist
in</i> HOOK'S <i>crew; and other ruffians long known and feared on
the Spanish main.</i></p>

<p><i>Cruelest jewel in that dark setting is</i> HOOK <i>himself,
cadaverous and blackavised, his hair dressed in long curls which look
like black candles about to melt, his eyes blue as the forget-me-not
and of a profound insensibility, save when he claws, at which time a
red spot appears in them. He has an iron hook instead of a right
hand, and it is with this he claws. He is never more sinister
than</i> <i>when he is most polite, and the elegance of his diction,
the distinction of his demeanour, show him one of a different class
from his crew, a solitary among uncultured companions. This
courtliness impresses even his victims on the high seas, who note
that he always says 'Sorry' when prodding them along the flank. A man
of indomitable courage, the only thing at which he flinches is the
sight of his own blood, which is thick and of an unusual colour. At
his public school they said of him that he 'bled yellow.' In dress he
apes the dandiacal associated with Charles II., having heard it said
in an earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance
to the ill-fated Stuarts. A holder of his own contrivance is in his
mouth enabling him to smoke two cigars at once. Those, however, who
have seen him in the flesh, which is an inadequate term for his
earthly tenement, agree that the grimmest part of him is his iron
claw.</i></p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(abject).</i> Captain, let go</p>

<p>!HOOK. Put back that pistol, first.</p>

<p>STARKEY. 'Twas one of those boys you hate; I could haveshot him
dead.</p>

<p>HOOK. Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins
on us. Do you want to lose your scalp?</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(wriggling his cutlass pleasantly).</i> That is true.
Shall I after him, Captain, and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?
Johnny is a silent fellow.</p>

<p>HOOK. Not now. He is only one, and I want to mischief all the
seven. Scatter and look for them. <i>(The boatswain whistles his
instructions, and the men disperse on their frightful errand. With
none to hear save</i> SMEE, HOOK <i>becomes confidential.)</i> Most
of all I want their captain, Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm. I
have waited long to shake his hand with this. <i>(Luxuriating.)</i>
Oh, I 'll tear him!</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(always ready for a chat).</i> Yet I have oft heard you
say your hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and
other homely uses.</p>

<p>HOOK. If I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with
this instead of that <i>(his left arm creeps nervously behind him. He
has a galling remembrance).</i> Smee, Pan flung my arm to a crocodile
that happened to be passingby.</p>

<p>SMEE. I have often noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(pettishly).</i> Not of crocodiles but of that one
crocodile. <i>(He lays bare a lacerated heart.)</i> The brute liked
my arm so much, Smee, that he has followed me ever since, from sea to
sea, and from land to land, licking his lips for the rest of me.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(looking for the bright side).</i> In a way it is a sort
of compliment.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(with dignity).</i> I want no such compliments; I want
Peter Pan, who first gave the brute his taste for me. Smee, that
crocodile would have had me before now, but by a lucky chance he
swallowed a clock, and it goes tick, tick, tick, tick inside him; and
so before he can reach me I hear the tick and bolt. <i>(He emits a
hollow rumble.)</i> Once I heard it strike six within him.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(sombrely).</i> Some day the clock will run down,and then
he'll get you.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(a broken man).</i> Ay, that is the fear that haunts
me. <i>(He rises.)</i> Smee, this seat is hot; odds, bobs, hammer and
tongs, I am burning.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(He has been sitting, he thinks, on one of the island
mushrooms, which are of enormous size. But this is a hand-painted one

voices.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>SMEE. A chimney!</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(avidly).</i> Listen! Smee, 'tis plain they live here,
beneath the ground. <i>(He replaces the mushroom. His brain works
tortuously.)</i></p>

<p>SMEE <i>(hopefully).</i> Unrip your plan, Captain.</p>

<p>HOOK. To return to the boat and cook a large rich cakeof jolly
thickness with sugar on it, green sugar. There can be but one room
below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the
sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. We must leave the
cake on the shore of the mermaids' lagoon. These boys are always
swimming about there, trying to catch the mermaids. They will find
the cake and gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don't know
how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake. They will die!</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(fascinated).</i> It is the wickedest, prettiest policy
ever I heard of,</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(meaning well).</i> Shake hands on 't.</p>

<p>SMEE. No, Captain, no.<br>

<p>TOOTLES. They are gone.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(almost losing confidence in himself).</i> I do wish
Peter was here.</p>

shrinks back.)</i> It is wolves, and they are chasing Nibs!<br>

<p>NIBS <i>(falling among his comrades).</i> Save me, save me!</p>

<p>TOOTLES. What should we do?</p>

<p>SECOND TWIN. What would Peter do?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Peter would look at them through his legs; let us do
what Peter would do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
 <i>(The boys advance backwards, looking between their legs at the
snarling red-eyed enemy, who trot away foiled.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(swaggering).</i> We have saved you, Nibs. Did you
see the pirates?</p>

<p>NIBS <i>(sitting up, and agreeably aware that the centre of
interest is now to pass to him).</i> No, but I saw a wonderfuller
thing, Twin. <i>(All mouths open for the information to be dropped
into them.)</i> High over the lagoon I saw the loveliest great white
bird. It is flying this way. <i>(They search the firmament.)</i></p>

<p>TOOTLES. What kind of a bird, do you think?</p>

<p>NIBS <i>(awed).</i> I don't know; but it looked so weary, and as
it flies it moans 'Poor Wendy.'</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(instantly).</i> I remember now there are birds called
Wendies.</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(who has flown to a high branch).</i> See, it comes,
the Wendy! <i>(They all see it now.)</i> How white it is! <i>(A dot
of light is pursuing the bird malignantly.)</i></p>

<p>TOOTLES. That is Tinker Bell. Tink is trying to hurt theWendy.
<i>(He makes a cup of his hands and calls)</i> Hullo,Tink! <i>(A
response comes down in the fairy language.)</i> She says Peter wants
us to shoot the Wendy.</p>

<p>NIBS. Let us do what Peter wishes.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Ay, shoot it; quick, bows and arrows.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(first with his bow).</i> Out of the way, Tink; I'll
shoot it. <i>(His bolt goes home, and</i> WENDY, <i>who has been
fluttering among the tree-tops in her white nightgown, falls</i>
<i>straight to earth. No one could be more proud than</i> TOOTLES.) I
have shot the Wendy; Peter will be so pleased. <i>(From some tree on
which</i> TINK <i>is roosting comes the tinkle we can now translate,
'You silly ass.'</i> TOOTLES <i>falters.)</i> Why do you say that?
<i>(The others feel that he may have blundered, and draw away
from</i> TOOTLES.)</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(examining the fallen one more minutely).</i> This is
no bird; I think it must be a lady.</p>

<p>NIBS <i>(who would have preferred it to be a bird).</i> And
Tootles has killed her.</p>

<p>CURLY. Now I see, Peter was bringing her to us. <i>(They wonder
for what object.)</i></p>

<p>SECOND TWIN. To take care of us? <i>(Undoubtedly for some
diverting purpose.)</i></p>

<p>OMNES <i>(though every one of them had wanted to have a shot at
her).</i> Oh, Tootles!</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(gulping).</i> I did it. When ladies used to come to me
in dreams I said 'Pretty mother,' but when she really came I shot
her! <i>(He perceives the necessity of a solitary life for him.)</i>
Friends, good-bye.</p>

<p>SEVERAL <i>(not very enthusiastic).</i> Don't go.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. I must; I am so afraid of Peter.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He has gone but a step toward oblivion when he is
stopped by a crowing as of some victorious cock.)</i></blockquote>

<p>OMNES. Peter!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They make a paling of themselves in front of</i>
WENDY <i>as</i> PETER <i>skims round the tree-tops and reaches
earth.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Greeting, boys! <i>(Their silence chafes him.)</i> I am
back; why do you not cheer? Great news, boys, I have brought at last
a mother for us all.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(vaguely).</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p>PETER. She flew this way; have you not seen her?</p>

<p>SECOND TWIN <i>(as</i> PETER <i>evidently thinks her
important).</i>Oh mournful day!</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(making a break in the paling).</i> Peter, I will show
her to you.</p>

<p>THE OTHERS <i>(closing the gap).</i> No, no.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(majestically).</i> Stand back all, and let Peter
see.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The paling dissolves, and</i> PETER <i>sees</i> WENDY
<i>prone on the ground.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Wendy, with an arrow in her heart! <i>(He plucks it
out.)</i> Wendy is dead. <i>(He is not so much pained as
puzzled.)</i></p>

<p>CURLY. I thought it was only flowers that die.</p>

<p>PETER. Perhaps she is frightened at being dead? <i>(Noneof them
can say as to that.)</i> Whose arrow? <i>(Not one of them looks
at</i> TOOTLES.)</p>

<p>TOOTLES. Mine, Peter.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(raising it as a dagger).</i> Oh dastard hand!</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(kneeling and baring his breast).</i> Strike, Peter;
strike true.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(undergoing a singular experience).</i> I cannot strike;
there is something stays my hand.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(In fact</i> WENDY'S <i>arm has
risen.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. 'Tis she, the Wendy lady. See, her arm. <i>(To help a
friend)</i> I think she said 'Poor Tootles.'</p>

<p>PETER <i>(investigating).</i> She lives!</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(authoritatively).</i> The Wendy lady lives. <i>(The
delightful feeling that they have been cleverer</i> <i>than they
thought comes over them and they applaud</i> <i>themselves.)</i></p>

<p>PETER <i>(holding up a button that is attached to her chain).</i>
See, the arrow struck against this. It is a kiss I gave her; it has
saved her life.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. I remember kisses; let me see it. <i>(He takes it in his
hand.)</i> Ay, that is a kiss.</p>

<p>PETER. Wendy, get better quickly and I'll take you to see the
mermaids. She is awfully anxious to see a mermaid.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINKER BELL, <i>who may have been off visiting her
relations, returns to the wood and, under the impression
that</i>WENDY <i>has been got rid of, is whistling as gaily as a
canary. She is not wholly heartless, but is so small that she has
only room for one feeling at a time.)</i></blockquote>

<p>CURLY. Listen to Tink rejoicing because she thinks theWendy is dead!
<i>(Regardless of spoiling another's pleasure)</i> Tink, the Wendy
lives. <br>
<blockquote>(TINK <i>gives expression to fury.)</i></blockquote>

<p>SECOND TWIN <i>(tell-tale).</i> It was she who said that you
wanted us to shoot the Wendy.</p>

<p>PETER. She said that? Then listen, Tink, I am your friend no more.
<i>(There is a note of acerbity in</i> TINK'S <i>reply; it may mean
'Who wants you?')</i> Begone from me forever. <i>(Now it is a very
wet tinkle.)</i></p>

<p>CURLY. She is crying.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. She says she is your fairy.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(who knows they are not worth worrying about).</i> Oh
well, not for ever, but for a whole week.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINK. <i>goes off sulking, no doubt with the intention
ofgiving all her friends an entirely false impression of</i>WENDY'S
<i>appearance.)</i></blockquote>

<p>Now what shall we do with Wendy?</p>

<p>CURLY. Let us carry her down into the house.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Ay, that is what one does with ladies.</p>

<p>PETER. No, you must not touch her; it wouldn't be sufficiently
respectful.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. That is what I was thinking.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. But if she lies there she will die.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Ay, she will die. It is a pity, but there is no way
out.</p>

<p>PETER. Yes, there is. Let us build a house around her! <i>(Cheers
again, meaning that no difficulty baffles</i> PETER.) Leave all to
me. Bring the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp. <i>(They
race down their trees.)</i><br>

<p>MICHAEL. Where is Wendy? (PETER <i>points.)</i></p>

<p>JOHN <i>(who still wears his hat).</i> She is asleep.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. John, let us wake her and get her to make supper for
us.<br>

one.)</i></blockquote>

<p>John, look at them!

shelp in the building of the house.</p>

<p>JOHN. Build a house?</p>

<p>CURLY. For the Wendy.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(feeling that there must be some mistake here).</i>
ForWendy? Why, she is only a girl.</p>

<p>CURLY. That is why we are her servants.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(dazed).</i> Are you Wendy's servants?</p>

<p>PETER. Yes, and you also. Away with them. <i>(In another moment
they are woodsmen hacking at trees, with</i> CURLY <i>as
overseer.)</i> Slightly, fetch a doctor. (SLIGHTLY <i>reels and goes.
He returns professionally in</i> JOHN'S <i>hat.)</i> Please, sir, are
you a doctor?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(trembling in his desire to give
satisfaction).</i>Yes, my little man.</p>

<p>PETER. Please, sir, a lady lies very ill.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(taking care not to fall over her).</i> Tut, tut,
where does she lie?</p>

<p>PETER. In yonder glade. <i>(It is a variation of a game they
play.)</i></p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. I will put a glass thing in her mouth. <i>(He inserts an
imaginary thermometer in</i> WENDY'S <i>mouth and gives it a moment
to record its verdict. He shakes it and then consults it.)</i></p>

<p>PETER <i>(anxiously).</i> How is she?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Tut, tut, this has cured her.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(leaping joyously).</i> I am glad.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. I will call again in the evening. Give her beef tea out

<p>PETER <i>(with an already fading recollection of the Darling

<p>FIRST TWIN. Peter, she is moving in her sleep.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(opening</i> WENDY'S <i>mouth and gazing down into the

like to have.<br>

<p>WENDY <i>(without opening her eyes).</i></p>

With funny little red walls<br>
And roof of mossy green.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(In the time she sings this and two other verses, such is the
urgency of</i> PETER'S <i>silent orders that they have knocked down
trees, laid a foundation and put up the walls and roof, so that she

<i>rushes them in, 'Roses' and</i> TOOTLES <i>arrives breathless with
a festoon for the door. Thus springs into existence the most
delicious little house for beginners.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>FIRST TWIN. I think it is finished.</p>

<p>PETER. There is no knocker on the door. (TOOTLES <i>hangs up the
sole of his shoe.)</i> There is no chimney, we must have a chimney.
<i>(They await his deliberations anxiously.)</i></p>

<p>JOHN <i>(unwisely critical).</i> It certainly does need a
chimney.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He is again wearing his hat, which</i> PETER
<i>seizes, knocks the top off it and places on the roof. In the
friendliestway smoke begins to come out of the hat.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(with his hand on the knocker).</i> All look your best;
the first impression is awfully important. <i>(he knocks, and after a
dreadful moment of suspense, in which they cannot help wondering if
any one is inside, the door opens and who should come out but</i>
WENDY! <i>She has evidently been tidying a little. She is quite
surprised to find that she has nine children.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(genteelly).</i> Where am I?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Wendy lady, for you we built this house.</p>

<p>NIBS and TOOTLES. Oh, say you are pleased.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(stroking the pretty thing).</i> Lovely, darling
house!</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN. And we are your children.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(affecting surprise).</i> Oh?</p>

<p>OMNES <i>(kneeling, with outstretched arms).</i> Wendy lady, be
our mother! <i>(Now that they know it is pretend they acclaim her
greedily.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(not to make herself too cheap).</i> Ought I? Of course
it is frightfully fascinating; but you see I am only a little girl; I
have no real experience.</p>

<p>OMNES. That doesn't matter. What we need is just a nice motherly
person.</p>

<p>WENDY. Oh dear, I feel that is just exactly what I am.</p>

<p>OMNES. It is, it is, we saw it at once.</p>

<p>WENDY. Very well then, I will do my best. <i>(In their glee they
go dancing obstreperously round the little house, and she sees she
must be firm with them as well as kind.)</i> Come inside at once, you
naughty children, I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you
to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.<br>

<hr><h2><a name="ch3"></a>ACT III</h2>

<h3>THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON</h3>

<p><i>It is the end of a long playful day on the lagoon. The sun's
rays have persuaded him to give them another five minutes, for one
more race over the waters before he gathers them up and lets in the
moon. There are many mermaids here, going plop-plop, and one might
attempt to count the tails did they not flash and disappear so
quickly. At times a lovely girl leaps in the air seeking to get rid
of her excess of scales, which fall in a silver shower as she shakes
them off. From the coral grottoes beneath the lagoon, where are the
mermaids' bedchambers, comes fitful music.</i></p>

<p><i>One of the most bewitching of these blue-eyed creatures is
lying lazily on Marooners' Rock, combing her long tresses and noting
effects in a transparent shell. Peter and his band are in the water
unseen behind the rock, whither they have tracked her as if she were
a trout, and at a signal ten pairs of arms come whack upon the
mermaid to enclose her. Alas, this is only what was meant to happen,
for she hears the signal (which is the crow of a cock) and slips
through their arms into the water. It has been such a near thing that
there are scales on some of their hands. They climb on to the rock
crestfallen.</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(preserving her scales as carefully as if they were rare
postage stamps).</i> I did so want to catch a mermaid.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(getting rid of his).</i> It is awfully difficult to
catch a mermaid.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The mermaids at times find it just as difficult to
catch him, though he sometimes joins them in their one game,which
consists in lazily blowing their bubbles into the air and seeing who
can catch them. The number of bubbles</i> PETER <i>has flown away
with! When the weather grows</i> <i>cold mermaids migrate 'to the
other side of the world, and he once went with a great shoal of them
half the way.)</i></blockquote>

<p>They are such cruel creatures, Wendy, that they try to pull boys
and girls like you into the water and drown them.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(too guarded by this time to ask what he means 'precisely
by 'like you,' though she is very desirous of knowing).</i> How
hateful!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She is slightly different in appearance now, rather
rounder, while</i> JOHN <i>and</i> MICHAEL <i>are not quite so round.
The reason is that when new lost children arrive at his underground
home</i> PETER <i>finds new trees for them to go up and down by, and
instead of fitting the tree to them he makes them fit the tree.
Sometimes it can be done by adding or removing garments, but if you
are bumpy, or the tree is an odd shape, he has things done to you
with a roller, and after that you fit.</i><br>

<p><i>The other boys are now playing King of the Castle, throwing
each other into the water, taking headers and so on; but these two
continue to talk.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PETER. Wendy, this is a fearfully important rock. It is called
Marooners' Rock. Sailors are marooned, you know, when their captain
leaves them on a rock and sails away.</p>

<p>WENDY. Leaves them on this little rock to drown?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(lightly).</i> Oh, they don't live long. Their hands are
tied, so that they can't swim. When the tide is full this rock is
covered with water, and then the sailor drowns.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(WENDY <i>is uneasy as she surveys the rock, which is the
only one in the lagoon and no larger than a table. Since she last
looked around a threatening change has come over the scene. The sun
has gone, but the moon has not come. What has come is a cold shiver
across the waters which has sent all the wiser mermaids to their
coral recesses. They know that evil is creeping over the lagoon. Of
the boys</i> PETER <i>is of course the first to scent it, and he has
leapt to his feet before the words strike the
rock&mdash;</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>'And if we 're parted by a shot<br>
We 're sure to meet below.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The games on the rock and around it end so abruptly
that several divers are checked in the air. There they hang waiting
for the word of command from</i> PETER. <i>When they get it they
strike the water simultaneously, and the rock is at once as bare as
if suddenly they had been blown off it. Thus the pirates find it
deserted when their dinghy strikes the rock and is nearly stove in by
the concussion.)</i></blockquote>

<p>SMEE. Luff, you spalpeen, luff! <i>(They are</i> SMEE <i>and</i>
STARKEY, <i>with</i> TIGER LILY, <i>their captive, bound hand and
foot.)</i> What we have got to do is to hoist the redskin on to the
rock and leave her there to drown.</p>

<blockquote><i>(To one of her race this is an end darker than death
by fire or torture, for it is written in the laws of the Piccaninnies
that there is no path through water to the happy hunting ground. Yet
her face is impassive; she is the daughter of a chief and must die as
a chief's daughter; it is enough.)</i></blockquote>

<p>STARKEY <i>(chagrined because she does not mewl).</i> No mewling.
This is your reward for prowling round the ship with a knife in your
mouth.</p>

<p>TIGER LILLY <i>(stoically).</i> Enough said.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(who would have preferred a farewell palaver).</i> So
that's it! On to the rock with her, mate.</p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(experiencing for perhaps the last time the stirrings
of a man).</i> Not so rough, Smee; roughish, but not so rough.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(dragging her on to the rock).</i> It is the captain's
orders.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(A stave has in some past time been driven into the
rock, probably to mark the burial place of hidden treasure, and to
this they moor the dinghy.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(in the water).</i> Poor Tiger Lily!

<p>STARKEY. What was that? <i>(The children bob.)</i></p>

<p>PETER <i>(who can imitate the captain's voice so perfectly that
even the author has a dizzy feeling that at times he was really
H</i>OOK). Ahoy there, you lubbers!</p>

<p>STARKEY. It is the captain; he must be swimming out to us.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(calling).</i> We have put the redskin on the
rock,Captain.</p>

<p>PETER. Set her free.</p>

<p>SMEE. But, Captain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>PETER. Cut her bonds, or I 'll plunge my hook in you.</p>

<p>SMEE. This is queer:</p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(unmanned).</i> Let us follow the captain's orders.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They undo the thongs and</i> TIGER LILY <i>slides
between their legs into the lagoon, forgetting in her haste to utter
her war-cry, but</i> PETER <i>utters it for her, so naturally that
even the lost boys are deceived. It is at this moment that the voice
of the true</i> HOOK <i>is heard.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. Boat ahoy!</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(relieved).</i> It is the captain.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(HOOK <i>is swimming, and they help him to scale the
rock. He is in gloomy mood.)</i></blockquote>

<p>STARKEY. Captain, is all well?</p>

<p>SMEE. He sighs.</p>

<p>STARKEY. He sighs again.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(counting).</i> And yet a third time he sighs. <i>(With
foreboding)</i> What's up, Captain?</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(who has perhaps found the large rich damp cake
untouched).</i> The game is up. Those boys have found a mother!</p>

<p>STARKEY. Oh evil day!</p>

<p>SMEE. What is a mother?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(horrified).</i> He doesn't know!</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(sharply).</i> What was that?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(PETER <i>makes the splash of a mermaid's
tail.)</i></blockquote>

<p>STARKEY. One of them mermaids.</p>

<p>HOOK. Dost not know, Smee? A mother is&mdash;&mdash; <i>(He finds
it more difficult to explain than he had expected, and looks about
him for an illustration. He finds one in a great bird which drifts
past in a nest as large as the roomiest basin)</i> There is a lesson
in mothers for you! The nest must have fallen intothe water, but
would the bird desert her eggs? (PETER, <i>who is now more or less
off his head, makes the sound of a bird answering in the negative.
The nest is borne out of sight.)</i></p>

<p>STARKEY. Maybe she is hanging about here to protect Peter?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(HOOK'S <i>face clouds still further and</i> PETER
<i>just manages not to call out that he needs no
protection.)</i></blockquote>

<p>SMEE <i>(not usually a man of ideas).</i> Captain, could we not
kidnap these boys' mother and make her our mother?</p>

<p>HOOK. Obesity and bunions, 'tis a princely scheme. We will seize
the children, make them walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our
mother!</p>

<p>WENDY. Never! <i>(Another splash from</i> PETER.)</p>

<p>HOOK. What say you, bullies?</p>

<p>SMEE. There is my hand on 't.</p>

<p>STARKEY. And mine.</p>

<p>HOOK. And there is my hook. Swear. <i>(All swear.)</i> But I had
forgot; where is the redskin?</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(shaken).</i> That is all right, Captain; we let her
go.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(terrible).</i> Let her go?</p>

<p>SMEE. 'Twas your own orders, Captain.</p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(whimpering).</i> You called over the water to us to
let her go.</p>

<p>HOOK. Brimstone and gall, what cozening is here? <i>(Disturbed by
their faithful faces)</i> Lads, I gave no such order.</p>

<p>SMEE 'Tis passing queer.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(addressing the immensities).</i> Spirit that haunts
thisdark lagoon to-night, dost hear me?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(in the same voice).</i> Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I
hear you.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(gripping the stave for support).</i> Who are you,
stranger, speak.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(who is only too ready to speak).</i> I am Jas Hook,
Captain of the <i>Jolly Roger.</i></p>

<p>HOOK <i>(now white to the gills).</i> No, no, you are not.</p>

<p>PETER. Brimstone and gall, say that again and I 'll cast anchor in
you.</p>

<p>HOOK. If you are Hook, come tell me, who am I?</p>

<p>PETER. A codfish, only a codfish.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(aghast).</i> A codfish?</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(drawing back from him).</i> Have we been captained all
this time by a codfish?</p>

<p>STARKEY. It's lowering to our pride.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(feeling that his ego is slipping from him).</i> Don't
desert me, bullies.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(top-heavy).</i> Paw, fish, paw!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(There is a touch of the feminine in</i> HOOK, <i>as
in all the greatest prates, and it prompts him to try the guessing
game.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. Have you another name?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(falling to the lure).</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(thirstily).</i> Vegetable?</p>

<p>PETER. No.</p>

<p>HOOK. Mineral?</p>

<p>PETER. No.</p>

<p>HOOK. Animal?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(after a hurried consultation with</i> TOOTLES). Yes.</p>

<p>HOOK. Man?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(with scorn).</i> No.</p>

<p>HOOK. Boy?</p>

<p>PETER, Yes.</p>

<p>HOOK. Ordinary boy?</p>

<p>PETER. No!</p>

<p>HOOK. Wonderful boy?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(to</i> WENDY'S <i>distress).</i> Yes!</p>

<p>HOOK. Are you in England?</p>

<p>PETER. No.</p>

<p>HOOK. Are you here?</p>

<p>PETER. Yes.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(beaten, though he feels he has very nearly got it).</i>
Smee, you ask him some questions.</p>

<p>SMEE <i>(rummaging his brains).</i> I can't think of a thing,</p>

<p>PETER. Can't guess, can't guess! <i>(Foundering in his
cockiness)</i> Do you give it up?</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(eagerly).</i> Yes.</p>

<p>PETER. All of you?</p>

<p>SMEE and STARKEY. Yes.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(crowing).</i> Well, then, I am Peter Pan!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Now they have him.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. Pan! Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind the boat. Take him
dead or alive!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(who still has all his baby teeth).</i> Boys, lam into
the pirates!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>For <i>a moment the only two we can see are in the
dinghy, where</i> JOHN <i>throws himself on</i> STARKEY. STARKEY
<i>wriggles into the lagoon and</i> JOHN <i>leaps so quickly after
him that he reaches it first. The impression left on</i> STARKEY
<i>is that he is being attacked by the</i> TWINS. <i>The water
becomes stained. The dinghy drifts away. Here and there a head shows
in the water, and once it is the head of the crocodile. In the
growing gloom some strike at their friends,</i> SLIGHTLY
<i>getting</i> TOOTLES <i>in the fourth rib while he himself is
pinked by</i> CURLY. <i>It looks as if the boys were getting the
worse of it, which is perhaps just as well at this point, because</i>
PETER, <i>who will be the determining factor in the end, has a
perplexing way of changing sides if he is winning too easily.</i>
HOOK'S <i>iron claw makes a circle of black water round him from
which opponents flee like fishes. There is only one prepared to enter
that dreadful circle. His name is</i> PAN. <i>Strangely, it is not in
the water that they meet.</i> HOOK <i>has risen tothe rock to
breathe, and at the same moment</i> PETER <i>scales it on the
opposite side. The rock is now wet and as slippery as a ball, and
they have to crawl rather than climb. Suddenly they are face to
face.</i> PETER <i>gnashes his pretty teeth with joy, and is
gathering himself for the spring when he sees he is higher up the
rock than his foe. Courteously he waits;</i> HOOK <i>sees his
intention, and taking advantage of it claws twice.</i> PETER <i>is
untouched, but unfairness is what he never can get used to, and in
his bewilderment he rolls off the rock. The crocodile, whose tick has
been drowned in the strife, rears its jaws, and</i> HOOK, <i>who has
almost stepped into them, is pursued by it to land. All is quiet on
the lagoon now, not a sound save little waves nibbling at the rock,
which is smaller than when we last looked at it. Two boys appear with
the dinghy, and the others despite their wounds climb into it. They
send the cry 'Peter&mdash;Wendy' across the waters, but no answer
comes.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. They must be swimming home.</p>

<p>JOHN. Or flying.</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN. Yes, that is it. Let us be off and call to them as we
go.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The dinghy disappears with its load, whose hearts
would sink it if they knew of the peril of</i> WENDY <i>and her
captain. From near and far away come the cries 'Peter&mdash;Wendy'
till we no longer hear them.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Two small figures are now on the rock, but they have
fainted. A mermaid who has dared to come back in the stillness
stretches up her arms and is slowly pulling</i>WENDY <i>into the
water to drown her.</i> WENDY <i>starts up just in
time.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Peter! <i>(He rouses himself and looks around him.)</i>
Where are we, Peter?</p>

<p>PETER. We are on the rock, but it is getting smaller. Soon the
water will be over it. Listen!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They can hear the wash of the relentless little
waves.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. We must go.</p>

<p>PETER. Yes.</p>

<p>WENDY. Shall we swim or fly?</p>

<p>PETER. Wendy, do you think you could swim or fly to the island
without me?</p>

<p>WENDY. You know I couldn't, Peter, I am just a beginner.</p>

<p>PETER. Hook wounded me twice. <i>(He believes it; he is so good at
pretend that he feels the pain, his arms hang limp.)</i> I can
neither swim nor fly.</p>

<p>WENDY. Do you mean we shall both be drowned?</p>

<p>PETER. Look how the water is rising!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They cover their faces with their hands. Something
touches</i> WENDY <i>as lightly as a kiss.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(with little interest).</i> It must be the tail of the
kite we made for Michael; you remember it tore itself outof his hands
and floated away. <i>(He looks up and sees the kite sailing
overhead.)</i> The kite! Why shouldn't it carry you? <i>(He grips the
tail and pulls, and the kite responds.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Both of us!</p>

<p>PETER. It can't lift two, Michael and Curly tried.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She knows very well that if it can lift her it can
lift him also, for she has been told by the boys as a deadly secret
that one of the queer things about him is that he is no weight at
all. But it is a forbidden subject.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. I won't go without you. Let us draw lots which is to stay
behind.</p>

<p>PETER. And you a lady, never! <i>(The tail is in her hands, and
the kite is tugging hard. She holds out her mouth to</i> PETER,
<i>but he knows they cannot do that.)</i> Ready, Wendy!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The kite draws her out of sight across the
lagoon.</i><br>
 <i>The waters are lapping over the rock now, and</i> PETER
<i>knows that it will soon be submerged. Pale rays of light mingle
with the moving clouds, and from the coral grottoes is to be heard a
sound, at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the Never
Land, the mermaids calling to the moon to rise.</i> PETER <i>is
afraid at last, and a tremor runs through him, like a shudder passing
over the lagoon; but on the lagoon one shudder follows another till
there are hundreds of them, and he feels just the
one.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(with a drum beating in his breast as if he were a real
boy at last).</i> To die will be an awfully big adventure.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(The blind rises again, and the lagoon is now suffused with
moonlight. He is on the rock still, but the water is over his feet.
The nest is borne nearer, and the bird, after cooing a message to
him, leaves it and wings her way upwards.</i> PETER, <i>who knows the
bird language, slips into the nest, first removing the two eggs and
placing them in</i> STARKEY'S <i>hat, which has been left on the
stave.The hat drifts away from the rock, but he uses the stave as a
mast. The wind is driving him toward the open sea. He takes off his
shirt, which he had forgotten to remove while bathing, and unfurls it
as a sail. His vessel tacks, and he passes from sight, naked and
victorious. The bird returns and sits on the hat.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr><h2><a name="ch4"></a>ACT IV</h2>

<h3>THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND</h3>

<p><i>We see simultaneously the home under the ground, with the
children in it and the wood above ground with the redskins on it.
Below, the children are gobbling their evening meal; above, the
redskins are squatting in their blankets near the little house
guarding the children from the pirates. The only way of communicating
between these two parties is by means of the hollow trees.</i></p>

<p><i>The home has an earthen floor, which is handy for digging in if
you want to go fishing; and owing to there being so many entrances
there is not much wall space. The table at which the lost ones are
sitting is a board on top of a live tree trunk, which has been cut
flat but has such growing pains that the board rises as they eat, and
they have sometimes to pause in their meals to cut a bit more off the
trunk. Their seats are pumpkins or the large gay mushrooms of which
we have seen an imitation one concealing the chimney. There is an
enormous fireplace which is in almost any part of the room where you
care to light it, and across this Wendy has stretched strings, made
of fibre, from which she hangs her washing. There are also various
tomfool things in the room of no use whatever.</i></p>

<p><i>Michaels basket bed is nailed high up on the wall as if to
protect him from the cat, but there is no indication at present of
where the others sleep. At the back between two of the tree trunks is
a grindstone, and near it is a lovely hole, the size of a band-box,
with a gay curtain drawn across so that you cannot see what is
inside. This is Tink's withdrawing-room and bed-chamber, and it is
just as well that you cannot see inside, for it is so exquisite in
its decoration and in the personal apparel spread out on the bed that
you could scarcely resist making off with something. Tink is within
at present, as one can guess from a glow showing through the chinks.
It is her own glow, for though she has a chandelier for the look of
the thing, of course she lights her residence herself. She is
probably wasting valuable time just now wondering whether to put on
the smoky blue or the apple-blossom.</i></p>

<p><i>All the boys except Peter are here, and Wendy has the head of
the table, smiling complacently at their captivating ways, but doing
her best at the same time to see that they keep the rules about
hands-off-the-table, no-two-to-speak-at-once, and so on. She is
wearing romantic woodland garments, sewn by herself, with red berries
in her hair which go charmingly with her complexion, as she knows;
indeed she searched for red berries the morning after she reached the
island. The boys are in picturesque attire of her contrivance, and if
these don't always fit well the fault is not hers but the wearers,
for they constantly put on each other's things when they put on
anything at all. Michael is in his cradle on the wall. First Twin is
apart on a high stool and wears a dunce's cap, another invention of
Wendy's, but not wholly successful because everybody wants to be
dunce.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a pretend meal this evening, with nothing whatever on the
table, not a mug, nor a crust, nor a spoon. They often have these
suppers and like them on occasions as well as the other kind, which
consist chiefly of bread-fruit, tappa rolls, yams, mammee apples and
banana splash, washed down with calabashes of poe-poe. The pretend
meals are not Wendy's idea; indeed she was rather startled to find,
on arriving, that Peter knew of no other kind, and she is not
absolutely certain even now that he does eat the other kind, though
no one appears to do it more heartily. He insists that the pretend
meals should be partaken of with gusto, and we see his band doing
their best to obey orders.</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(her fingers to her ears, for their chatter and clatter
are deafening).</i> Silence! Is your mug empty, Slightly?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(who would not say this if he had a mug).</i> Not
quite empty, thank you.</p>

<p>NIBS. Mummy, he has not even begun to drink his poe-poe.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(seizing his chance, for this is tale-bearing).</i> I
complain of Nibs!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(JOHN <i>holds up his hand.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Well, John?</p>

<p>JOHN. May I sit in Peter's chair as he is not here?</p>

<p>WENDY. In your father's chair? Certainly not.</p>

<p>JOHN. He is not really our father. He did not even know how to be
a father till I showed him.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This is insurbordination.)</i></blockquote>

<p>SECOND TWIN. I complain of John!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The gentle</i> TOOTLED <i>raises his
hand.)</i></blockquote>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(who has the poorest opinion of himself).</i> I
don'tsuppose Michael would let me be baby?</p>

<p>MICHAEL. No, I won't.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. May I be dunce?</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(from his perch).</i> No. It's awfully difficultto
be dunce.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. As I can't be anything important would any of you like to
see me do a trick?</p>

<p>OMNES. No.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(subsiding).</i> I hadn't really any hope.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The tale-telling breaks out again.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. Slightly is coughing on the table.</p>

<p>CURLY. The twins began wiih tappa rolls.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. I complain of Nibs!</p>

<p>NIBS. I complain of Slightly!</p>

<p>WENDY. Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think that spinsters are to
be envied.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Wendy, I am too big for a cradle.</p>

<p>WENDY. You are the littlest, and a cradle is such a nice homely
thing to have about a house. You others can clear away now. <i>(She
sits down on a pumpkin near the fire to her usual evening occupation,
darning.)</i> Every heel with a hole in it!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The boys clear away with dispatch, washing dishes
they don't have in a non-existent sink and stowing them ina cupboard
that isn't there. Instead of sawing the table-leg to-night they crush
it into the ground like a concertina, and are now ready for play, in
which they indulge hilariously.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>A movement of the Indians draws our attention to the
scene above. Hitherto, with the exception of</i> PANTHER, <i>who sits
on guard on top of the little house, they have been hunkering in
their blankets, mute but picturesque; now all rise and prostrate
themselves before the majestic figure of</i> PETER, <i>who approaches
through the forest carrying a gun and game bag. It is not exactly a
gun. He often wanders away alone with this weapon, and when he comes
back you are never absolutely certain whether he has had an adventure
or not. He may have forgotten it so completely that he says nothing
about it; and then when you go out you find the body. On the other
hand he may say a great deal about it, and yet you never find the
body. Sometimes he comes home with his face scratched, and tells</i>
WENDY, <i>as a thing of no importance, that he got these marks from
the little people for cheeking them at a fairy wedding, and she
listens politely, but she is never quite sure, you know; indeed
theonly one who is sure about anything on the island is</i>
PETER.)</blockquote>

<p>PETER. The Great White Father is glad to see the Piccaninny braves
protecting his wigwam from the pirates.</p>

<p>TIGER LILY. The Great White Father save me from pirates. Me his
velly nice friend now; no let pirates hurt him.</p>

<p>BRAVES. Ugh, ugh, wah!</p>

<p>TIGER LILY. Tiger Lily has spoken.</p>

<p>PANTHER. Loola, loola! Great Big Little Panther has spoken.</p>

<p>PETER. It is well. The Great White Father has spoken.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This has a note of finality about it, with the
implied ,'And now shut up' which is never far from the courteous
receptions of well-meaning inferiors by born leaders of men. He
descends his tree, not unheard by</i> WENDY.)</blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet
him at the door. (PETER <i>scatters pretend nuts among them and
watches sharply to see that they crunch with relish.)</i> Peter, you
just spoil them, you know!</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(who would be incredulous if he dare).</i> Any sport,
Peter?</p>

<p>PETER. Two tigers and a pirate.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(boldly).</i> Where are their heads?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(contracting his little brows.)</i> In the bag.</p>

<p>JOHN. <i>(No, he doesn't say it. He backs away.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(peeping into the bag).</i> They are beauties'. <i>(She
has learned her lesson.)</i></p>

<p>FIRST TWIN. Mummy, we all want to dance.</p>

<p>WENDY. The mother of such an armful dance!</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. As it is Saturday night?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They have long lost count of the days, but always if
they want to do anything special they say this is Saturday night, and
then they do it.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Of course it is Saturday night, Peter? <i>(He shrugs an
indifferent assent.)</i> On with your nighties first.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They disappear into various recesses, and</i> PETER
<i>and</i> WENDY <i>with her darning are left by the fire to dodder
parentally. She emphasises it by humming a verse of 'John Anderson my
Jo,' which has not the desired effect on</i> PETER. <i>She is too
loving to be ignorant that he is not loving enough, and she hesitates
like one who knows the answer to her question.)</i></blockquote>

<p>What is wrong, Peter?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(scared).</i> It is only pretend, isn't it, that I am
their father?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(drooling).</i> Oh yes.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(His sigh of relief is without consideration for her
feelings.)</i></blockquote>

<p>But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(determined to get at facts, the only things that puzzle
him).</i> But not really?</p>

<p>WENDY. Not if you don't wish it.</p>

<p>PETER. I don't.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(knowing she ought not to 'probe but driven to it by
something within.)</i> What are your exact feelings for me,
Peter?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(in the class-room).</i> Those of a devoted
son,Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(turning away).</i> I thought so.</p>

<p>PETER. You are so puzzling. Tiger Lily is just the same; there is
something or other she wants to be to me, but she says it is not my
mother.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(with spirit).</i> No, indeed it isn't.</p>

<p>PETER. Then what is it?</p>

<p>WENDY. It isn't for a lady to tell.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The</i> <i>curtain of the fairy chamber opens
slightly, and</i> TINK, <i>who has doubtless been eavesdroping,
tinkles a laugh of scorn.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(badgered).</i> I suppose she means that she wants to be
my mother.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINK'S <i>comment is 'You silly ass.')</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(who has picked up some of the fairy words).</i> I almost
agree with her!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The arrival of the boys in their nightgowns turns</i>
WENDY'S <i>mind to practical matters, for the children have to be
arranged in line and passed or not passed for cleanliness.</i>
SLIGHTLY <i>is the worst. At last we see how they sleep, for in a
babel the great bed which stands on end by day against the wall is
unloosed from custody and lowered to the floor. Though large, it is a
tight fit for so many boys, and</i> WENDY <i>has made a rule that
there is to be no turning round until one gives the signal, when all
turn at once.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>FIRST TWIN <i>is the best dancer and performs mightily on the bed
and in it and out of it and over it to an accompaniment of pillow
fights by the less agile; and then there is a rush at</i> WENDY.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIBS. Now the story you promised to tell us as soon as we were in
bed!</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(severely).</i> As far as I can see you are not in bed
yet.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They scramble into the bed, and the effect is as of a
boxful of sardines.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(drawing up her stool).</i> Well, there was once a
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CURLY. I wish he had been a lady.</p>

<p>NIBS. I wish he had been a white rat.</p>

<p>WENDY. Quiet! There was a lady also. The gentleman's name was Mr.
Darling and the lady's name was Mrs. Darling&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>JOHN. I knew them!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(who has been allowed to join the circle).</i> I think
I knew them.</p>

<p>WENDY. They were married, you know; and what do you think they
had?</p>

<p>NIBS. White rats?</p>

<p>WENDY. No, they had three descendants. White rats are descendants
also. Almost everything is a descendant. Now these three children had
a faithful nurse called Nana.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(alas).</i> What a funny name!</p>

<p>WENDY. But Mr. Darling&mdash; <i>(faltering)</i> or was it
Mrs.Darling?&mdash;was angry with her and chained her up in the yard;
so all the children flew away. They flew away to the Never Land,
where the lost boys are.</p>

<p>CURLY. I just thought they did; I don't know how it is, but I just
thought they did.</p>

<p>TOOTLES. Oh, Wendy, was one of the lost boys called Tootles.</p>

<p>WENDY. Yes, he was.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(dazzled).</i> Am I in a story? Nibs, I am in a
story!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(who is by the fire making</i> Pan's <i>pipes with his
knife, and is determined that</i> WENDY <i>shall have fair pl</i>ay,
<i>however beastly a story he may think it).</i> A little less noise
there.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(melting over the beauty of her present performance, but
without any real qualms).</i> Now I want you to consider the feelings
of the unhappy parents with all their children flown away. Think, oh
think, of the empty beds. <i>(The heartless ones think of them with
glee.)</i></p>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(cheerfully).</i> It's awfully sad.</p>

<p>WENDY. But our heroine knew that her mother would always leave the
window open for her progeny to fly back by; so they stayed away for
years and had a lovely time.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(PETER <i>is</i> <i>interested at last.)</i></blockquote>

<p>FIRST TWIN. Did they ever go back?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(comfortably).</i> Let us now take a peep into the
future. Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant lady of
uncertain age alighting at London station?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The tension is unbearable.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. Oh, Wendy, who is she?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(swelling).</i> Can it be&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes,
it is the fair Wendy!</p>

<p>TOOTLES. I am glad.</p>

<p>WENDY. Who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her? Can
they be John and Michael? They are. <i>(Pride of</i> MICHAEL.) 'See,
dear brothers,' says Wendy, pointing upward, 'there is the window
standing open.' So up they flew to their loving parents, and pen
cannot inscribe the happy scene over which we draw a veil. <i>(Her
triumph is spoilt by a groan from</i> PETER <i>and she hurries to
him.)</i> Peter, what is it? <i>(Thinking he is ill, and looking
lower than his chest.)</i> Where is it?</p>

<p>PETER. It isn't that kind of pain. Wendy, you are wrong about
mothers. I thought like you about the window, so I stayed away for
moons and moons, and then I flew back, but the window was barred, for
my mother had forgotten all about me and there was another little boy
sleeping in my bed.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>( <i>This is a general damper.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN. Wendy, let us go back!</p>

<p>WENDY. Are you sure mothers are like that?</p>

<p>PETER. Yes.</p>

<p>WENDY. John, Michael! <i>(She clasps them to her.)</i></p>

<p>FIRST TWIN <i>(alarmed).</i> You are not to leave us, Wendy?</p>

<p>WENDY. I must.</p>

<p>NIBS. Not to-night?</p>

<p>WENDY. At once. Perhaps mother is in half-mourning by this time!
Peter, will you make the necessary arrangements?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She asks it in the steely tones women adopt when they
are prepared secretly for opposition.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(coolly).</i> If you wish it.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He ascends his tree to give the redskins their
instructions. The lost boys gather threateningly round</i>
WENDY.)</blockquote>

<p>CURLY. We won't let you go!</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(with one of those inspirations women have, in an
emergency, to make use of some male who need otherwise have no
hope).</i> Tootles, I appeal to you.</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(leaping to his death if necessary).</i> I am just
Tootles and nobody minds me, but the first who does not behave to
Wendy I will blood him severely. (PETER <i>returns.)</i></p>

<p>PETER <i>(with awful serenity).</i> Wendy, I told the braves to
guide you through the wood as flying tires you so. Then Tinker Bell
will take you across the sea. <i>(A shrill tinkle from the boudoir
probably means 'and drop her into it.')</i></p>

<p>NIBS <i>(fingering the curtain which he is not allowed to
open).</i> Tink, you are to get up and take Wendy on a journey.
<i>(Star-eyed)</i> She says she won't!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(taking a step toward that chamber).</i> If you don'tget
up, Tink, and dress at once&mdash;&mdash; She is getting up!</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(quivering now that the time to depart has come).</i>
Dear ones, if you will all come with me I feel almost sure I can get
my father and mother to adopt you.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(There is joy at this, not that they want parents, but
novelty is their religion.)</i></blockquote>

<p>NIBS. But won't they think us rather a handful?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(a swift reckoner).</i> Oh no, it will only mean having a
few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind screens on
first Thursdays.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Everything depends on</i> PETER.)</blockquote>

<p>OMNES. Peter, may we go?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(carelessly through the pipes to which he is giving a
finishing touch).</i> All right.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They scurry off to dress for the
adventure.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(insinuatingly).</i> Get your clothes, Peter.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(skipping about and playing fairy music on his pipes, the
only music he knows).</i> I am not going with you,Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY. Yes, Peter!</p>

<p>PETER. No.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The lost ones run back gaily, each carrying a stick
witha bundle on the end of it.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Peter isn't coming!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(All the faces go blank.)</i></blockquote>

<p>JOHN <i>(even</i> JOHN). Peter not coming!</p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(overthrown).</i> Why, Peter?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(his pipes more riotous than ever).</i> I just want
always to be a little boy and to have fun.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(There is a general fear that they are perhaps making
the mistake of their lives.)</i></blockquote>

<p>Now then, no fuss, no blubbering. <i>(With dreadful cynicism)</i>
I hope you will like your mothers! Are you ready, Tink? Then lead the
way.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(TINK <i>darts up any tree, but she is the only one.
Theair above is suddenly rent with shrieks and the clash of steel.
Though they cannot see, the boys know that</i> HOOK <i>and his crew
are upon the Indians. Mouths open andremain open, all in mute appeal
to</i> PETER. <i>He is theonly boy on his feet now, a sword in his
hand, the samehe slew Barbicue with; and in his eye is the lust of
battle.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We can watch the carnage that is invisible to the
children.</i> HOOK <i>has basely broken the two laws of Indian
warfare, which are that the redskins should attack first, and that it
should be at dawn. They have known the pirate whereabouts since,
early in the night, one of</i> SMEE'S <i>fingers crackled. The
brushwood has closed behind their scouts as silently as the sand on
the mole; for hours they have imitated the lonely call of the coyote;
no stratagem has been overlooked, but alas, they have trusted to the
pale-face's honour to await an attack at dawn, when his courage is
known to be at the lowest ebb.</i> HOOK <i>falls upon them pell-mell,
and one cannot withhold a reluctani admiration for the wit that
conceived so subtle a scheme and the fell genius with which it is
carried out. If the braves would rise quickly they might still have
time to scalp, but this they are forbidden to do by the traditions of
their race, for it is written that they must never express surprise
in the presence of the pale-face. For a brief space they remain
recumbent, not a muscle moving, as if the foe were here by
invitation. Thus perish the flower of the Piccaninnies, though not
unavenged, for with</i> LEAN WOLF <i>fall</i> ALF MASON <i>and</i>
CANARY ROBB, <i>while other pirates to bite dust are</i> BLACK
GILMOUR <i>and</i> ALAN HERB, <i>that same</i> HERB <i>who is still
remembered at Manaos for playing skittles with the mate of the</i>
Switch <i>for each other's heads.</i> CHAY TURLEY, <i>who laughed
with the wrong side of his mouth (having no other), is tomahawked
by</i> PANTHER, <i>who eventually cuts a way through the shambles
with</i> TIGER LILY <i>and a remnant of the tribe.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>This onslaught passes and is gone like a fierce wind.
The victors wipe their cutlasses, and squint, ferret-eyed, at their
leader. He remains, as ever, aloof in spirit and in substance. He
signs to them to descend the trees, for he is convinced that</i> PAN
<i>is down there, and though he has smoked the bees it is the honey
he wants. There is something in</i> PETER <i>that at all times goads
this extraordinary man to frenzy; it is the boy's cockiness, which
disturbs</i> HOOK <i>like an insect. If you have seen a lion in a
cage futilely pursuing a sparrow you will know what is meant. The
pirates try to do their captain's bidding, but the apertures prove to
be not wide enough for them; he cannot even ram them down with a
pole. He steals to the mouth of a tree and listens.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(prematurely).</i> All is over!</p>

<p>WENDY. But who has won?</p>

<p>PETER. Hst! If the Indians have won they will beat the tom-tom; it
is always their signal of victory.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(HOOK <i>licks his lips at this and signs to</i> SMEE,
<i>who is sitting on it, to hold up the tom-tom. He beats upon it</i>
<i>with his claw, and listens for results.)</i></blockquote>

<p>TOOTLES. The tom-tom!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(sheathing his sword).</i> An Indian victory!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The cheers from below are music to the black hearts
above.)</i></blockquote>

<p>You are quite safe now, Wendy. Boys, good-bye. <i>(He resumes his
pipes.)</i></p>

<p>WENDY. Peter, you will remember about changing your flannels,
won't you?'</p>

<p>PETER. Oh, all right!</p>

<p>WENDY. And this is your medicine.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She puts something into a shell and leaves it on a
ledge between two of the trees. It is only water, but she measures it
out in drops.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. I won't forget.</p>

<p>WENDY. Peter, what are you to me?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(through the pipes).</i> Your son, Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY. Oh, good-bye!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The travellers start upon their journey, little
witting that</i> HOOK <i>has issued his silent orders: a man to the
mouth of each tree, and a row of men between the trees and the little
house. As the children squeeze up they are plucked from their trees,
trussed, thrown like bales of cotton from one pirate to another, and
so piled up in the little house. The only one treated differently
is</i> WENDY, <i>whom</i> HOOK <i>escorts to the house on his arm
with hateful politeness. He signs to his dogs to be gone, and they
depart through the wood, carrying the little house with its strange
merchandise and singing their ribald song. The chimney of the little
house emits a jet of smoke fitfully, as if not sure what it ought to
do just now.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>HOOK <i>and</i> PETER <i>are now, as it were, alone on
the island. Below,</i> PETER <i>is on the bed, asleep, no weapon near
him; above,</i> HOOK, <i>armed to the teeth, is searching noiselessly
for some tree down which the nastiness of him can descend. Don't be
too much alarmed by this; it is precisely the situation</i> PETER
<i>would have chosen; indeed if the whole thing were
pretend&mdash;&mdash;. One of his arms droops over the edge of the
bed, a leg is arched, and the mouth is not so tightly closed that we
cannot see the little pearls. He is dreaming, and in his dreams he is
always in pursuit of a boy who was never here, nor anywhere: the only
boy who could beat him.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>HOOK <i>finds the tree. It is the one set apart for</i>
SLIGHTLY <i>who being addicted when hot to the drinking of water has
swelled in consequence and surreptitiously scooped his tree for
easier descent and egress. Down this the pirate wriggles a passage.
In the aperture below his face emerges and goes green as he glares at
the sleeping child. Does no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre
breast? The man is not wholly evil: he has a</i> Thesaurus <i>in his
cabin, and is no mean performer on the flute. What really warps him
is a presentiment that he is about to fail. This is not unconnected
with a beatific smile on the face of the sleeper, whom he cannot
reach owing to being stuck at the foot of the tree. He, however, sees
the medicine shell within easy reach, and to</i> WENDY'S <i>draught
he adds from a bottle five drops of poison distilled when he was
weeping from the red in his eye. The expression on</i> PETER'S
<i>face merely implies that something heavenly is going on.</i> HOOK
<i>worms his way upwards, and winding his cloak around him, as if to
conceal his person from the night of which he is the blackest part,
he stalks moodily toward the lagoon.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>A dot of light flashes past him and darts down the
nearest tree, looking for</i> PETER, <i>only for</i> PETER, <i>quite
indifferent about the others when she finds him
safe.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(stirring).</i> Who is that? (TINK <i>has to tell her
tale, in one long ungrammatical sentence.)</i> The redskins were
defeated? Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates! I'll rescue
her, I'll rescue her! <i>(He leap first at his dagger, and then at
his grindstone, to sharpen it.</i> TINK <i>alights near the shell,
and rings out a warning cry.)</i> Oh, that is just my medicine.
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it? I promised Wendy to take it,
and I will as soon as I have sharpened my dagger. (TINK, <i>who sees
its red colour and remembers the red in the grate's eye, nobly
swallows the draught as</i> PETER'S <i>hand is reaching for it.)</i>
Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine! <i>(She flutters strangely
about the room, answering him now in a very thin tinkle.)</i> It was
poisoned and you drank it to save my life! Tink, dear Tink, are you
dying? <i>(He has never called her dear</i> TINK <i>before, and for a
moment she is gay; she alights on his shoulder, gives his chin a
loving bite, whispers 'You silly ass' and falls on her tiny bed. The
boudoir, which is lit by her, flickers ominously. He is on his knees
by the opening.)</i></p>

<p>Her light is growing faint, and if it goes out, that means she is
dead! Her voice is so low I can scarcely tell what she is saying. She
says&mdash;she says she thinks she could get well again if children
believed in fairies! <i>(He rises and throws out his arms he knows
not to whom, perhaps to the boys and girls of whom he is not
one.)</i> Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe! If
you believe, clap your hands! <i>(Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.
Then perhaps there is a rush of Nanas to the nurseries to see what on
earth is happening. But</i> TINK <i>is saved.)</i> Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you! And now to rescue Wendy!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(TINK <i>is already as merry and impudent as a grig, withnot a
thought for those who have saved her.</i> PETER <i>ascends his tree
as if he were shot up it. What he is feeling is</i> 'HOOK <i>or me
this time!' He is frightfully happy. He soon hits the trail, for the
smoke from the house has lingered here and there to guide him. He
takes wing.)</i></p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch5"></a>ACT V</h2>

<h3>SCENE 1</h3>

<h3>THE PIRATE SHIP</h3>

<p><i>The stage directions for the opening of this scene are as
follows:&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>1</i> <i>Circuit Amber checked to</i> 80. <i>Battens, all Amber
checked,</i> 3 <i>ship's lanterns alight. Arcs: prompt perch</i> 1.
<i>Open dark Amber flooding back, O.P. perch open dark Amber flooding
upper deck. Arc on tall steps at back of cabin to flood back cloth.
Open dark Amber. Warning for slide. Plank ready. Call Hook.</i></p>

<p><i>In the strange light thus described we see what is happening on
the deck of the</i> Jolly Roger, <i>which is flying the skull and
crossbones and lies low in the water. There is no need to call Hook,
for he is here already, and indeed there is not a pirate aboard who
would dare to call him. Most of them are at present carousing in the
bowels of the vessel, but on the poop Mullins is visible, in the only
great-coat on the ship, raking with his glass the monstrous rocks
within which the lagoon is cooped. Such a look-out is supererogatory,
for the pirate craft floats immune in the horror of her name.</i></p>

<p><i>From Hook's cabin at the back Starkey appears and leans over
the bulwark, silently surveying the sullen waters. He is bare-headed
and is perhaps thinking with bitterness of his hat,which he sometimes
sees still drifting past him with the Never bird sitting on it. The
black pirate is asleep on deck, yet even in his dreams rolling
mechanically out of the way when Hook draws near. The only sound to
be heard is made by Smee at his sewing-machine, which lends a touch
of domesticity to the night.</i></p>

<p><i>Hook is now leaning against the mast, now prowling the deck,
the double cigar in his mouth. With Peter surely at last removed from
his path we, who know how vain a tabernacle is</i> <i>man, would not
be surprised to find him bellied out by the winds of his success, but
it is not so; he is still uneasy, looking long and meaninglessly at
familiar objects, such as the ship's bell or the Long Tom, like one
who may shortly be a stranger to them. It is as if Pan's terrible
oath 'Hook or me this time!' had already boarded the ship.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>HOOK <i>(communing with his ego).</i> How still the night is;
nothing sounds alive. Now is the hour when children in their homes
are a-bed; their lips bright-browned with the good-night chocolate,
and their tongues drowsily searching for belated crumbs housed
insecurely on their shining cheeks. Compare with them the children on
this boat about to walk the plank. Split my infinitives, but 'tis my
hour of triumph! <i>(Clinging to this fair prospect he dances a few
jubilant steps, but they fall below his usual form.)</i> And yet some
disky spirit compels me now to make my dying speech, lest when dying
there may be no time for it. All mortals envy me, yet better perhaps
for Hook to have had less ambition! O fame, fame, thou glittering
bauble, what if the very&amp;mdsah;&amp;&mdash; (SMEE, <i>engrossed in
his labours at the sewing-machine, tears a piece of calico with a
rending sound which makes the Solitary think for amoment that the
untoward has happened to his garments.)</i> No little children love
me. I am told they play at PeterPan, and that the strongest always
chooses to be Peter. They would rather be a Twin than Hook; they
force the baby to be Hook. The baby! that is where the canker gnaws.
<i>(He contemplates his industrious boatswain.)</i> 'Tis said they
find Smee lovable. But an hour agone I found him letting the youngest
of them try on his spectacles. Pathetic Smee, the Nonconformist
pirate, a happy smile upon his face because he thinks they fear him!
How can I break it to him that they think him lovable? No,
bi-carbonate of Soda, no, not even&mdash;&mdash; <i>(Another rending
of the calico disturbs him, and he has a private consultation
with</i> STARKEY, <i>who turns him round and evidently assures him
that all is well. The peroration of his speech is nevertheless for
ever lost, as eight bells strikes and his crew pour forth in
bacchanalian orgy. From, the poop he watches their dance till it
frets him beyond bearing.)</i> Quiet,you dogs, or I'll cast anchor in
you! <i>(He descends to a barrel on which there are playing-cards,
and his crew stand waiting, as ever, like whipped curs.)</i> Are all
the prisoners chained, sothat they can't fly away?</p>

<p>JUKES. Ay, ay, Captain.</p>

<p>HOOK. Then hoist them up.</p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(raising the door of the hold).</i> Tumble up, you
ungentlemanly lubbers.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The terrified boys are prodded up and tossed about
the deck.</i> HOOK <i>seems to have forgotten them; he is sitting by
the barrel with his cards.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(suddenly).</i> So! Now then, you bullies, six of you walk
the plank to-night, but I have room for two cabin-boys.Which of you
is it to be? <i>(He returns to his cards.)</i></p>

<p>TOOTLES <i>(hoping to soothe him by putting the blame on the only
person, vaguely remembered, who is always willing to act as a
buffer).</i> You see, sir, I don't think my mother would like me to
be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(implying that otherwise it would be a pleasure to him
to oblige).</i> I don't think so. Twin, would your mother
like&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>HOOK. Stow this gab. <i>(To</i> JOHN) You boy, you look as if you
had a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my
hearty?</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(dazzled by being singled out).</i> When I was at school
I&mdash;&mdash;what do you think, Michael?</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(stepping into prominence).</i> What would you call me
if I joined?</p>

<p>HOOK. Blackbeard Joe.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. John, what do you think?</p>

<p>JOHN. Stop, should we still be respectful subjects of
KingGeorge?</p>

<p>HOOK. You would have to swear 'Down with KingGeorge.'</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(grandly).</i> Then I refuse!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. And I refuse.</p>

<p>HOOK. That seals your doom. Bring up their mother.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(WENDY <i>is driven up from the hold and thrown to him.
She sees at the first glance that the deck has not been scrubbed for
years.)</i></blockquote>

<p>So, my beauty, you are to see your children walk the plank.

<p>WENDY <i>(with noble calmness).</i> Are they to die?</p>

<p>HOOK. They are. Silence all, for a mother's last words to her
children.</p>

<p>WENDY. These are my last words. Dear boys, I feel that I have a
message to you from your real mothers, and it is this, 'We hope our
sons will die like English gentlemen.'<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The boys go on fire.)</i></blockquote>

<p>TOOTLES. I am going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to
do, Twin?</p>

<p>FIRST TWIN. What my mother hopes. John, what are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>HOOK. Tie her up! Get the plank ready.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(WENDY <i>is roped to the mast; but no one regards her,
for all eyes are fixed upon the plank now protruding from the poop
over the ship's side. A great change, however, occurs in the time</i>
HOOK <i>takes to raise his claw and point to this deadly engine. No
one is now looking at the plank: for the tick, tick of the crocodile
is heard. Yet it is not to bear on the crocodile that all eyes slew
round, it is that they may bear on</i> HOOK. <i>Otherwise prisoners
and captors are equally inert, like actors in some play who have
found themselves 'on' in a scene in which they are not personally
concerned. Even the iron claw hangs inactive, as if aware that the
crocodile is not coming for it. Affection for their captain, now
cowering from view, is not what has given</i> HOOK <i>his dominance
over the crew, but as the menacing sound draws nearer they close
their eyes respectfully.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>There is no crocodile. It is</i> PETER, <i>who has been
circling the pirate ship, ticking as he flies far more superbly than
any clock. He drops into the water and climbs aboard, warning the
captives with upraised finger (but still ticking) not for the moment
to give audible expression to their natural admiration. Only one
pirate sees him,</i> WHIBBLES <i>of the eye patch, who comes up from
below.</i> JOHN <i>claps a hand on</i> WHIBBLES'S <i>mouth to stifle
the groan; four boys hold him to prevent the thud;</i> PETER
<i>delivers the blow, and the carrion is thrown overboard. 'One!'
says</i> SLIGHTLY, <i>beginning to count.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>STARKEY <i>is the first pirate to open his eyes. The ship seems to
him to be precisely as when he closed them. He cannot interpret the
sparkle that has come into the faces of the captives, who are
cleverly pretending to be as afraid as ever. He little knows that the
door of the dark cabin has just closed on one more boy. Indeed it is
for</i> HOOK <i>alone he looks, and he is a little surprised to see
him.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>STARKEY <i>(hoarsely).</i> It is gone, Captain! There is not a
sound.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(The tenement that is</i> HOOK <i>heaves tumultuously and he is
himself again.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(now convinced that some fair spirit watches over
him).</i> Then here is to Johnny Plank&mdash;&amp;&mdash;</p>

<p>Avast, belay, the English brig<br>
We took and quickly sank,<br>
And for a warning to the crew<br>
We made them walk the plank!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(As he sings he capers detestably along an imaginary
plank and his copy-cats do likewise, joining in the
chorus.)</i></blockquote>

<p>Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky cat,<br>
 You walks along it so,<br>
 Till it goes down and you goes down<br>
 To tooral looral lo!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The brave children try to stem this monstrous torrent
by breaking into the National Anthem.)</i></blockquote>

<p>STARKEY <i>(paling).</i> I don't like it, messmates!</p>

<p>HOOK. Stow that, Starkey. Do you boys want a touch of the cat
before you walk the plank? <i>(He is more pitiless than ever now that
he believes he has a charmed life.)</i> Fetch the cat, Jukes; it is
in the cabin.</p>

<p>JUKES. Ay, ay, sir. <i>(It is one of his commonest remarks, and is
only recorded now because he never makes another. The stage direction
'Exit</i> JUKES' <i>has in this case a special significance. But only
the children know that some one is awaiting this unfortunate in the
cabin, and</i> HOOK <i>tramples them down as he resumes his
ditty:)</i></p>

<p>Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat<br>
 Its tails are nine you know,<br>
 And when they're writ upon your back,<br>
 You 're fit to&mdash;&mdash;<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The last words will ever remain a matter of
conjecture, for from the dark cabin comes a curdling screech which
wails through the ship and dies away. It is followed by a sound,
almost more eerie in the circumstances, that can only be likened to
the crowing of a cock.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. What was that?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(solemnly).</i> Two!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(CECCO <i>swings into the cabin, and in a moment returns,
livid.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(with an effort).</i> What is the matter with Bill Jukes,
you dog?</p>

<p>CECCO. The matter with him is he is dead&mdash;&mdash;stabbed.</p>

<p>PIRATES. Bill Jukes dead!</p>

<p>CECCO. The cabin is as black as a pit, but there is something
terrible in there: the thing you heard a-crowing.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(slowly).</i> Cecco, go back and fetch me out that
doodle-doo.</p>

<p>CECCO <i>(unstrung).</i> No, Captain, no. <i>(He supplicates on
his knees, but his master advances on him implacably.)</i></p>

<p>HOOK <i>(in his most syrupy voice).</i> Did you say you would go,
Cecco?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(CECCO <i>goes. All listen. There is one screech, one
crow.)</i></blockquote>

<p>SLIGHTLY <i>(as if he were a bell tolling).</i> Three!</p>

<p>HOOK. 'Sdeath and oddsfish, who is to bring me out that
doodle-doo?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(No one steps forward.)</i></blockquote>

<p>STARKEY <i>(injudiciously).</i> Wait till Cecco comes out.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The black looks of some others encourage
him.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey.</p>

<p>STARKEY <i>(emphatically).</i> No, by thunder!</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(in that syrupy voice which might be more engaging when
accompanied by his flute).</i> My hook thinks you did. Iwonder if it
would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?</p>

<p>STARKEY. I'll swing before I go in there.</p>

<p>HOOK <i>(gleaming).</i> Is it mutiny? Starkey is ringleader.Shake
hands, Starkey.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(STARKEY <i>recoils from the claw. It follows him till he leaps
overboard.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did any other gentleman say mutiny?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They indicate that they did not even know the
late</i> STARKEY.)</blockquote>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Four!</p>

<p>HOOK. I will bring out that doodle-doo myself.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He raises a blunderbuss but casts it from him with a
menacing gesture which means that he has more faith in the claw. With
a lighted lantern in his hand he enters the cabin. Not a sound is to
be heard now on the ship, unless it be</i> SLIGHTLY <i>wetting his
lips to say 'Five.'</i> HOOK <i>staggers out.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(unsteadily).</i> Something blew out the light.</p>

<p>MULLINS <i>(with dark meaning).</i> Some&mdash;thing?</p>

<p>NOODLER. What of Cecco?</p>

<p>HOOK. He is as dead as Jukes.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They are superstitious like all sailors, and</i>
MULLINS <i>has planted a dire conception in their
minds.)</i></blockquote>

<p>COOKSON. They do say as the surest sign a ship's accurst is when
there is one aboard more than can be accounted for.</p>

<p>NOODLER. I 've heard he allus boards the pirate craft at last.
<i>(With dreadful significance)</i> Has he a tail, Captain?</p>

<p>MULLINS. They say that when he comes it is in the likenessof the
wickedest man aboard.</p>

<p>COOKSON <i>(clinching it).</i> Has he a hook, Captain?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Knives and pistols come to hand, and there is a
general cry 'The ship is doomed!' But it is not his dogs that can
frighten</i> JAS HOOK. <i>Hearing something like a cheer from the
boys he wheels round, and his face brings them to their
knees.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. So you like it, do you! By Caius and Balbus, bullies, here
is a notion: open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight
the doodle-doo for their lives. If they kill him we are so much the
better; if he kills them we are none the worse.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This masterly stroke restores their confidence; and
the boys, affecting fear, are driven into the cabin. Desperadoes
though the pirates are, some of them have been boys themselves, and
all turn their backs to the cabin and listen, with arms outstretched
to it as if to ward off the horrors that are being enacted
there.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Relieved by Peter of their manacles, and armed with such
weapons as they can lay their hands on, the boys steal out softly as
snowflakes, and under their captain's hushed order find hiding-places
on the poop. He releases</i>WENDY; <i>and now it would be easy for
them all to fly away, but it is to be</i> HOOK <i>or him this time.
He signs to her to join the others, and with awful grimness folding
her cloak around him, the hood over his head, he takes her place by
the mast, and crows.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>MULLINS. The doodle-doo has killed them all!</p>

<p>SEVERAL. The ship 's bewitched.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They are snapping at</i> HOOK
<i>again.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. I 've thought it out, lads; there is a Jonah aboard.</p>

<p>SEVERAL <i>(advancing upon him).</i> Ay, a man with a hook.</p>

<p>(<i>If he were to withdraw one step their knives would be in him,
but he does not flinch.)</i></p>

<p>HOOK <i>(temporising).</i> No, lads, no, it is the girl. Never was
luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman aboard. We'll right the ship when
she has gone.'</p>

<p>MULLINS <i>(lowering his cutlass).</i> It's worth trying.</p>

<p>HOOK. Throw the girl overboard.</p>

<p>MULLINS <i>(jeering).</i> There is none can save you now,
missy.</p>

<p>PETER. There is one.</p>

<p>MULLINS. Who is that?</p>

<p>PETER <i>(casting off the cloak).</i> Peter Pan, the avenger!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He continues standing there to let the effect sink
in.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(throwing out a suggestion).</i> Cleave him to the
brisket.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(But he has a sinking that this boy has no
brisket?)</i></blockquote>

<p>NOODLER. The ship 's accurst!</p>

<p>PETER. Down, boys, and at them!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The boys leap from their concealment and the clash of
arms resounds through the vessel. Man to man the pirates are the
stronger, but they are unnerved by the sud</i><i>denness of the
onslaught and they scatter, thus enabling their opponents to hunt in
couples and choose their quarry. Some are hurled into the lagoon;
others are dragged from dark recesses. There is no boy whose weapon
is not reeking save</i> SLIGHTLY, <i>who runs about with a lantern,
counting, ever counting.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(meeting</i> MICHAEL <i>in a moment's lull).</i>
Oh,Michael, stay with me, protect me!</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(reeling).</i> Wendy, I've killed a pirate!</p>

<p>WENDY. It's awful, awful.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. No, it isn't, I like it, I like it.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He casts himself into the group of boys who are
encircling</i> HOOK. <i>Again and again they close upon him and again
and again he hews a clear space.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. Back, back, you mice. It's Hook; do you like him? <i>(He
lifts up</i> MICHAEL <i>with his claw and uses him as a buckler. A
terrible voice breaks in.)</i></p>

<p>PETER. Put up your swords, boys. This man is mine.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(HOOK <i>shakes</i> MICHAEL <i>off his claw as if he were
a drop of water, and these two antagonists face each other for their
final bout. They measure swords at arms' length ,make a sweeping
motion with them, and bringing the points to the deck rest their
hands upon the hilts.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(with curling lip).</i> So, Pan, this is all your
doing!</p>

<p>PETER. Ay, Jas Hook, it is all my doing.</p>

<p>HOOK. Proud and insolent youth, prepare to meet thy doom.</p>

<p>PETER. Dark and sinister man, have at thee.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Some say that he had to ask</i> TOOTLES <i>whether
the word was sinister or canister.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>HOOK <i>or</i> PETER <i>this time! They fall to
without another word.</i> PETER <i>is a rare swordsman, and parries
with dazzling rapidity, sometimes before the other can make his
stroke.</i> HOOK, <i>if not quite so nimble in wrist play, has the
advantage of a yard or two in reach, but though they close he cannot
give the quietus with his claw, which seems to find nothing to tear
at. He does not, especially in the most heated moments, quite see</i>
PETER, <i>who to his eyes, now blurred or opened clearly for the
first time, is less like a boy than a mote of dust dancing in the
sun. By some impalpable stroke</i> HOOK'S <i>sword is whipped from
his grasp, and when he stoops to raise it a little foot is on its
blade. There is no deep gash on</i> HOOK, <i>but he is suffering
torment as from innumerable jags.)</i></blockquote>

<p>BOYS <i>(exulting).</i> Now, Peter, now!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(PETER <i>raises the sword by its blade, and with an
inclination of the head that is perhaps slightly overdone, presents
the hilt to his enemy.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK. 'Tis some fiend fighting me! Pan, who and what art thou?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The children listen eagerly for the answer, none
quite so eagerly as</i> WENDY.)</blockquote>

<p>PETER <i>(at a venture).</i> I'm youth, I'm joy, I'm a little bird
that has broken out of the egg.</p>

<p>HOOK. To 't again!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He has now a damp feeling that this boy is the weapon
which is to strike him from the lists of man; but the grandeur of his
mind still holds and, true to the traditions of his flag, he fights
on like a human flail.</i> PETER <i>flutters round and through and
over these gyrations as if the wind of them blew him out of the
danger zone ,and again and again he darts in and
jags.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(stung to madness).</i> I'll fire the powder magazine.
<i>(He disappears they know not where.)</i></p>

<p>CHILDREN. Peter, save us!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(PETER, <i>alas, goes the wrong way and</i> HOOK
<i>returns.)</i></blockquote>

<p>HOOK <i>(sitting on the hold with gloomy satisfaction).</i> In two
minutes the ship will be blown to pieces.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They cast themselves before him in
entreaty.)</i></blockquote>

<p>CHILDREN. Mercy, mercy!</p>

<p>HOOK. Back, you pewling spawn. I'll show you now the road to dusty
death. A holocaust of children, there is something grand in the
idea!<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(PETER <i>appears with the smoking bomb in his hand, and
tosses it overboard.</i> HOOK <i>has not really had much hope, and he
rushes at his other persecutors with his head down like some
exasperated bull in the ring; but with bantering cries they easily
elude him by flying among the rigging.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Where is</i> PETER? <i>The incredible boy has apparently
forgotten the recent doings, and is sitting on a barrel playing upon
his pipes. This may surprise others but does not surprise</i> HOOK.
<i>Lifting a blunderbuss he strikes forlornly not at the boy but at
the barrel, which is hurled across the deck.</i> PETER <i>remains
sitting in the air still playing upon his pipes. At this sight the
great heart of</i> HOOK <i>breaks. That not wholly unheroic figure
climbs the bulwarks murmuring</i> 'Floreat Etona,' <i>and prostrates
himself into the water, where the crocodile is waitingfor him
open-mouthed.</i> HOOK <i>knows the purpose of this yawning cavity,
but after what he has gone through he enters it like one greeting a
friend.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The curtain rises to show</i> PETER <i>a very Napoleon on his
ship. It must not rise again lest we see him on the poop in</i>
HOOK'S <i>hat and cigars, and with a small iron claw.)</i></p>

<hr><h2>ACT V.</h2>

<h3>SCENE 2</h3>

<h3>THE NURSERY AND THE TREE-TOPS</h3>

<p><i>The old nursery appears again with everything just as it was at
the beginning of the play, except that the kennel has gone and that
the window is standing open. So Peter was wrong about mothers; indeed
there is no subject on which he is so likely to be wrong.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Darling is asleep on a chair near the window, her eyes
tired with searching the heavens. Nana is stretched out listless on
the floor. She is the cynical one, and though custom has made her
hang the children's night things on the fire-guard for an airing, she
surveys them not hopefully but with some self-contempt.</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(starting up as if we had whispered to her that
her brats are coming back).</i> Wendy, John, Michael! (NANA <i>lifts
a sympathetic paw to the poor soul's lap.)</i> I see you have put
their night things out again, Nana! It touches my heart to watch you
do that night after night. But they will never come back.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(In trouble the difference of station can be
completely ignored, and it is not strange to see these two using the
same handkerchief. Enter</i> LIZA, <i>who in the gentleness with
which the house has been run of late is perhaps a little more
masterful than of yore.)</i></blockquote>

<p>LIZA <i>(feeling herself degraded by the announcement).</i> Nana's
dinner is served.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(NANA, <i>who quite understands what are</i> LIZA'S
<i>feelings, departs for the dining-room with our exasperating
leisureliness, instead of running, as we would all do if we followed
our instincts.)</i></blockquote>

<p>LIZA. To think I have a master as have changed places with his
dog!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(gently).</i> Out of remorse, Liza.</p>

<p>LIZA <i>(surely exaggerating).</i> I am a married woman myself. I
don't think it's respectable to go to his office in a kennel, with
the street boys running alongside cheering. <i>(Even this does not
rouse her mistress, which may have been the honourable
intention.)</i> There, that is the cab fetching him back! <i>(Amid
interested cheers from the street the kennel is conveyed to its old
place by a cabby and friend, and</i> MR.DARLING <i>scrambles out of
it in his office clothes.)</i></p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(giving her his hat loftily).</i> If you will be so
good, Liza. <i>(The cheering is resumed.)</i> It is very
gratifying!</p>

<p>LIZA <i>(contemptuous).</i> Lot of little boys.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(with the new sweetness of one who has sworn never
to lose his temper again).</i> There were several adults to-day.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She goes off scornfully with the hat and the two men,
but he has not a word of reproach for her. It ought to melt us when
we see how humbly grateful he is for akiss from his wife, so much
more than he feels he deserves. One may think he is wrong to exchange
into the kennel, but sorrow has taught him that he is the kind of man
who whatever he does contritely he must do to excess; otherwise he
soon abandons doing it.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(who has known this for quite a long
time).</i>What sort of a day have you had, George?<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He is sitting on the floor by the
kennel.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MR. DARLING. There were never less than a hundred running round
the cab cheering, and when we passed the Stock Exchange the members
came out and waved.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He is exultant but uncertain of himself, and with a
word she could dispirit him utterly.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(bravely).</i> I am so proud, George.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(commendation from the dearest quarter ever going
to his head).</i> I have been put on a picture postcard, dear.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(nobly).</i> Never!</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(thoughtlessly).</i> Ah, Mary, we should not be
such celebrities if the children hadn't flown away.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(startled).</i> George, you are sure you are not
enjoying it?,</p>

<p>MR. DARLING <i>(anxiously).</i> Enjoying it! See my punishment:
living in a kennel.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Forgive me, dear one.</p>

<p>MR. DARLING. It is I who need forgiveness, always I, never you.
And now I feel drowsy. <i>(He retires into the kennel.)</i> Won't you
play me to sleep on the nursery piano? And shut that window, Mary
dearest; I feel a draught.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Oh, George, never ask me to do that. The window must
always be left open, for them, always, always.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She goes into the day nursery, from which we
presently hear her playing the sad song of Margaret. She little knows
that her last remark has been overheard by a boy crouching at the
window. He steals into the room accompanied by a ball of
light.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Tink, where are you? Quick, close the window. <i>(It
closes.)</i> Bar it. <i>(The bar slams down.)</i> Now whenWendy comes
she will think her mother has barred her out, and she will have to
come back to me! (TINKER BELL <i>sulks.)</i> Now, Tink, you and I
must go out by the door. <i>(Doors, however, are confusing things to
those who are used to windows, and he is puzzled when he finds that
this one does not open on to the firmament. He tries the other, and
sees the piano player.)</i> It is Wendy's mother! (TINK. <i>pops on
to his shoulder and they peep together.)</i> She is a pretty lady,
but not so pretty as my mother. <i>(This is a pure guess.)</i> She is
making the box say 'Come home, Wendy.' You will never see Wendy
again, lady, for the window is barred! <i>(He flutters about the room
joyously like a bird, but has to return to that door.)</i> She has
laid her head down on the box. There are two wet things sitting on
her eyes. As soon as they go away another two come and sit on her
eyes. <i>(She is heard moaning 'Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.')</i> She wants
me to unbar the window. I won't! She is awfully fond of Wendy. I am
fond of her too. We can't both have her, lady! <i>(A funny feeling
comes over him.)</i> Come on, Tink; we don't want any silly
mothers.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(He opens the window and they fly
out.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>It is thus that the truants find entrance easy when they alight
on the sill,</i> JOHN <i>to his credit having the tired</i> MICHAEL
<i>on his shoulders. They have nothing else to their credit; no
compunction for what they have done, not the tiniest fear that any
just person may be awaiting them with a stick. The youngest is in a
daze, but the two others are shining virtuously like holy people who
are about to give two other people a treat.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(looking about him).</i> I think I have been here
before.</p>

<p>JOHN. It's your home, you stupid.</p>

<p>WENDY. There is your old bed, Michael.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. I had nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>JOHN. I say, the kennel!</p>

<p>WENDY. Perhaps Nana is in it.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(peering).</i> There is a man asleep in it.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(remembering him by the bald patch).</i> It's father!</p>

<p>JOHN. So it is!</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Let me see father. <i>(Disappointed)</i> He is not as big
as the pirate I killed.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(perplexed).</i> Wendy, surely father didn't use to sleep
in the kennel?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(with misgivings).</i> Perhaps we don't remember the old
life as well as we thought we did.</p>

<p>JOHN <i>(chilled).</i> It is very careless of mother not to be
here when we come back.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(The piano is heard again.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. H'sh! <i>(She goes to the door and peeps.)</i> That is her
playing! <i>(They all have a peep.)</i></p>

<p>MICHAEL. Who is that lady?</p>

<p>JOHN. H'sh! It's mother.</p>

<p>MICHAEL. Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(with conviction).</i> Oh dear, it is quite time to be
back!</p>

<p>JOHN. Let us creep in and put our hands over her eyes.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(more considerate).</i> No, let us break it to her
gently.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She slips between the sheets of her bed; and the
others, seeing the idea at once, get into their beds. Then when the
music stops they cover their heads. There are now three distinct
bumps in the beds.</i> MRS. DARLING <i>sees the bumps as soon as she
comes in, but she does not believe she sees them.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I see them in their beds so often in my dreams that
I seem still to see them when I am awake! I'll not look again.
<i>(She sits down and turns away her face from the bump, though of
course they are still reflected in her mind.)</i> So often their
silver voices call me, my little children whom I'll see no more.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(Silver voices is a good one, especially about</i>
JOHN; <i>but the heads pop up.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(perhaps rather silvery).</i> Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(without moving).</i> That is Wendy.</p>

<p>JOHN, <i>(quite gruff).</i> Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Now it is John.</p>

<p>MICHAEL <i>(no better than a squeak).</i> Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Now Michael. And when they call I stretch out my
arms to them, but they never come, they never come!<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(This time, however, they come, and there is joy once
more in the Darling household. The little boy who is crouching at the
window sees the joke of the bumps in the beds, but cannot understand
what all the rest of the fuss is about.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The scene changes from the inside of the house to the outside,
and we see</i> MR. DARLING <i>romping in at the door, with the lost
boys hanging gaily to his coat-tails. Some may conclude that</i>
WENDY <i>has told them to wait outside until she explains the
situation to her mother, who has then sent</i> MR. DARLING <i>down to
tell them that they are adopted. Of course they could have flown in
by the window like a covey of birds, but they think it better fun to
enter by a door. There is a moment's trouble about</i> SLIGHTLY,
<i>who somehow gets shut out. Fortunately</i> LIZA <i>finds
him.)</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>LIZA. What is the matter, boy?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. They have all got a mother except me.</p>

<p>LIZA <i>(starting back).</i> Is your name Slightly?</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. Yes'm.</p>

<p>LIZA. Then I am your mother.</p>

<p>SLIGHTLY. How do you know?</p>

<p>LIZA <i>(the good-natured creature).</i> I feel it in my
bones.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(They go into the house and there is none hazier now
than</i> SLIGHTLY, <i>unless it be</i> NANA <i>as she passes with the
importance of a nurse who will never have another day off.</i> WENDY
<i>looks out at the nursery window and sees a friend below, who is
hovering in the air knocking off tall hats with his feet. The wearers
don't see him. They are too old. You can't see</i> PETER <i>if you
are old. They think he is a draught at the corner.</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY. Peter!</p>

<p>PETER <i>(looking up casually).</i> Hullo, Wendy.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She flies down to him, to the horror of her mother,
who rushes to the window.)</i></blockquote>

<p>WENDY <i>(making a last attempt).</i> You don't feel you would
like to say anything to my parents, Peter, about a very sweet
subject?</p>

<p>PETER. No, Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY. About me, Peter?</p>

<p>PETER. No. <i>(He gets out his pipes, which she knows is a very
bad sign. She appeals with her arms to</i> MRS. DARLING, <i>who is
probably thinking that these children will all need to be tied to
their beds at night.)</i></p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(from the window).</i> Peter, where are you? Let
me adopt you too.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(She is the loveliest age for a woman, but too old to
see</i> PETER <i>clearly.)</i></blockquote>

<p>PETER. Would you send me to school?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(obligingly).</i> Yes.</p>

<p>PETER. And then to an office?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I suppose so.</p>

<p>PETER. Soon I should be a man?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Very soon.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(passionately).</i> I don't want to go to school and
learn solemn things. No one is going to catch me, lady, and make me a
man. I want always to be a little boy and to have fun.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>(So perhaps he thinks, but it is only his greatest
pretend.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(shivering every time</i> WENDY <i>pursues him in
the air).</i> Where are you to live, Peter?</p>

<p>PETER. In the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it
high up among the tree-tops where they sleep at night.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(rapturously).</i> To think of it!</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. I thought all the fairies were dead.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(almost reprovingly).</i> No indeed! Their mothers drop
the babies into the Never birds' nests, all mixed up with the eggs,
and the mauve fairies are boys and the white ones are girls, and
there are some colours who don't know what they are. The row the
children and the birds make at bath time is positively deafening.</p>

<p>PETER. I throw things at them.</p>

<p>WENDY. You will be rather lonely in the evenings, Peter.</p>

<p>PETER. I shall have Tink.</p>

<p>WENDY <i>(flying up to the window).</i> Mother, may I go?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(gripping her for ever).</i> Certainly not. I have
got you home again, and I mean to keep you.</p>

<p>WENDY. But he does so need a mother.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. So do you, my love.</p>

<p>PETER. Oh, all right.</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING <i>(magnanimously).</i> But, Peter, I shall let her
go to you once a year for a week to do your spring cleaning.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(WENDY <i>revels in this, but</i> PETER, <i>who has no
notion what a spring cleaning is, waves a rather careless
thanks.)</i></blockquote>

<p>MRS. DARLING. Say good-night, Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY. I couldn't go down just for a minute?</p>

<p>MRS. DARLING. No.</p>

<p>WENDY. Good-night, Peter!</p>

<p>PETER. Good-night, Wendy!</p>

<p>WENDY. Peter, you won't forget me, will you, before
spring-cleaning time comes?<br>
</p>

For a moment after he is gone we still hear the pipes.</i> MRS.
DARLING <i>closes and bars the window.)</i></blockquote>

<p><i>We are dreaming now of the Never Land a year later. It is
bed-time on the island, and the blind goes up to the whispers of the
lovely Never music. The blue haze that makes the wood below magical
by day comes up to the tree-tops to sleep, and through it we see
numberless nests all lit up, fairies and birds quarrelling for
possession, others flying around just for the fun of the thing and
perhaps making bets about where the little house will appear
to-night. It always comes and snuggles on some tree-top, but you can
never be sure which; here it is again, you see John's hat first as up
comes the house so softly that it knocks some gossips off their
perch. When it has settled comfortably it lights up, and out come
Peter and Wendy.</i></p>

<p><i>Wendy looks a little older, but Peter is just the same. She is
cloaked for a journey, and a sad confession must be made about her;
she flies so badly now that she has to use a broomstick.</i></p>

<p>WENDY <i>(who knows better this time than to be demonstrative at
partings).</i> Well, good-bye, Peter; and remember not to bite your
nails.</p>

<p>PETER. Good-bye, Wendy.</p>

<p>WENDY. I'll tell mother all about the spring cleaning and the
house.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(who sometimes forgets that she has been here
before).</i> You do like the house?</p>

<p>WENDY. Of course it is small. But most people of our size wouldn't
have a house at all. <i>(She should not have mentioned size, for he
has already expressed displeasure at her growth. Another thing, one
he has scarcely noticed, though it disturbs her, is that she does not
see him quite so clearly now as she used to do.)</i> When you come
for me next year, Peter&mdash;you will come, won't you?</p>

<p>PETER. Yes. <i>(Gloating)</i> To hear stories about me!</p>

<p>WENDY. It is so queer that the stories you like best should be the
ones about yourself.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(touchy).</i> Well, then?</p>

<p>WENDY. Fancy your forgetting the lost boys, and even Captain
Hook!</p>

<p>PETER. Well, then?</p>

<p>WENDY. I haven't seen Tink this time.</p>

<p>PETER. Who?</p>

<p>WENDY. Oh dear! I suppose it is because you have so many
adventures.</p>

<p>PETER <i>(relieved).</i> 'Course it is.</p>

<p>WENDY. If another little girl&mdash;if one younger than I
am&mdash;<i>(She can't go on.)</i> Oh, Peter, how I wish I could
take you up and squdge you! <i>(He draws back.)</i> Yes, I know.
<i>(She gets astride her broomstick.)</i> Home! <i>(It carries her
from him over the tree-tops.</i><br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>In a sort of way he understands what she means by
'Yes,I know,' but in most sorts of ways he doesn't. It has something
to do with the riddle of his being. If hecould get the hang of the
thing his cry might become 'To live would be an awfully big
adventure!' but he can never quite get the hang of it, and so no one
is as gay as he. With rapturous face he produces his pipes, and the
Never birds and the fairies gather closer, till the roof of the
little house is so thick with his admirers that some of them fall
down the chimney. He plays on and on till we wake
up.)</i></blockquote>
