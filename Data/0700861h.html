<h1><a name="s1"></a>GREEN TEA</h1>

<h2><a name="c1-p"></a>PROLOGUE - <i>Martin Hesselius, the German
Physician</i></h2>

<p>Though carefully educated in medicine and surgery, I have never
practised either. The study of each continues, nevertheless, to
interest me profoundly. Neither idleness nor caprice caused my
secession from the honourable calling which I had just entered. The
cause was a very trifling scratch inflicted by a dissecting knife. This
trifle cost me the loss of two fingers, amputated promptly, and the
more painful loss of my health, for I have never been quite well since,
and have seldom been twelve months together in the same place.</p>

<p>In my wanderings I became acquainted with Dr. Martin Hesselius, a
wanderer like myself, like me a physician, and like me an enthusiast in
his profession. Unlike me in this, that his wanderings were voluntary,
and he a man, if not of fortune, as we estimate fortune in England, at
least in what our forefathers used to term "easy circumstances." He was
an old man when I first saw him; nearly five-and-thirty years my
senior.</p>

<p>In Dr. Martin Hesselius, I found my master. His knowledge was
immense, his grasp of a case was an intuition. He was the very man to
inspire a young enthusiast, like me, with awe and delight. My
admiration has stood the test of time and survived the separation of
death. I am sure it was well-founded.</p>

<p>For nearly twenty years I acted as his medical secretary. His
immense collection of papers he has left in my care, to be arranged,
indexed and bound. His treatment of some of these cases is curious. He
writes in two distinct characters. He describes what he saw and heard
as an intelligent layman might, and when in this style of narrative he
had seen the patient either through his own hall-door, to the light of
day, or through the gates of darkness to the caverns of the dead, he
returns upon the narrative, and in the terms of his art and with all
the force and originality of genius, proceeds to the work of analysis,
diagnosis and illustration.</p>

<p>Here and there a case strikes me as of a kind to amuse or horrify a
lay reader with an interest quite different from the peculiar one which
it may possess for an expert. With slight modifications, chiefly of
language, and of course a change of names, I copy the following. The
narrator is Dr. Martin Hesselius. I find it among the voluminous notes
of cases which he made during a tour in England about sixty-four years
ago.</p>

<p>It is related in series of letters to his friend Professor Van Loo
of Leyden. The professor was not a physician, but a chemist, and a man
who read history and metaphysics and medicine, and had, in his day,
written a play.</p>

<p>The narrative is therefore, if somewhat less valuable as a medical
record, necessarily written in a manner more likely to interest an
unlearned reader.</p>

<p>These letters, from a memorandum attached, appear to have been
returned on the death of the professor, in 1819, to Dr. Hesselius. They
are written, some in English, some in French, but the greater part in
German. I am a faithful, though I am conscious, by no means a graceful
translator, and although here and there I omit some passages, and
shorten others, and disguise names, I have interpolated nothing.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-1"></a>Chapter I - <i>Dr. Hesselius Relates How He Met
the Rev. Mr. Jennings</i></h2>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Jennings is tall and thin. He is middle-aged, and
dresses with a natty, old-fashioned, high-church precision. He is
naturally a little stately, but not at all stiff. His features, without
being handsome, are well formed, and their expression extremely kind,
but also shy.</p>

<p>I met him one evening at Lady Mary Heyduke's. The modesty and
benevolence of his countenance are extremely prepossessing.</p>

<p>We were but a small party, and he joined agreeably enough in the
conversation, He seems to enjoy listening very much more than
contributing to the talk; but what he says is always to the purpose and
well said. He is a great favourite of Lady Mary's, who it seems,
consults him upon many things, and thinks him the most happy and
blessed person on earth. Little knows she about him.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Jennings is a bachelor, and has, they say sixty
thousand pounds in the funds. He is a charitable man. He is most
anxious to be actively employed in his sacred profession, and yet
though always tolerably well elsewhere, when he goes down to his
vicarage in Warwickshire, to engage in the actual duties of his sacred
calling, his health soon fails him, and in a very strange way. So says
Lady Mary.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Mr. Jennings' health does break down in,
generally, a sudden and mysterious way, sometimes in the very act of
officiating in his old and pretty church at Kenlis. It may be his
heart, it may be his brain. But so it has happened three or four times,
or oftener, that after proceeding a certain way in the service, he has
on a sudden stopped short, and after a silence, apparently quite unable
to resume, he has fallen into solitary, inaudible prayer, his hands and
his eyes uplifted, and then pale as death, and in the agitation of a
strange shame and horror, descended trembling, and got into the
vestry-room, leaving his congregation, without explanation, to
themselves. This occurred when his curate was absent. When he goes down
to Kenlis now, he always takes care to provide a clergyman to share his
duty, and to supply his place on the instant should he become thus
suddenly incapacitated.</p>

<p>When Mr. Jennings breaks down quite, and beats a retreat from the
vicarage, and returns to London, where, in a dark street off
Piccadilly, he inhabits a very narrow house, Lady Mary says that he is
always perfectly well. I have my own opinion about that. There are
degrees of course. We shall see.</p>

<p>Mr. Jennings is a perfectly gentlemanlike man. People, however,
remark something odd. There is an impression a little ambiguous. One
thing which certainly contributes to it, people I think don't remember;
or, perhaps, distinctly remark. But I did, almost immediately. Mr.
Jennings has a way of looking sidelong upon the carpet, as if his eye
followed the movements of something there. This, of course, is not
always. It occurs now and then. But often enough to give a certain
oddity, as I have said, to his manner, and in this glance travelling
along the floor there is something both shy and anxious.</p>

<p>A medical philosopher, as you are good enough to call me,
elaborating theories by the aid of cases sought out by himself, and by
him watched and scrutinised with more time at command, and consequently
infinitely more minuteness than the ordinary practitioner can afford,
falls insensibly into habits of observation, which accompany him
everywhere, and are exercised, as some people would say, impertinently,
upon every subject that presents itself with the least likelihood of
rewarding inquiry.</p>

<p>There was a promise of this kind in the slight, timid, kindly, but
reserved gentleman, whom I met for the first time at this agreeable
little evening gathering. I observed, of course, more than I here set
down; but I reserve all that borders on the technical for a strictly
scientific paper.</p>

<p>I may remark, that when I here speak of medical science, I do so, as
I hope some day to see it more generally understood, in a much more
comprehensive sense than its generally material treatment would
warrant. I believe the entire natural world is but the ultimate
expression of that spiritual world from which, and in which alone, it
has its life. I believe that the essential man is a spirit, that the
spirit is an organised substance, but as different in point of material
from what we ordinarily understand by matter, as light or electricity
is; that the material body is, in the most literal sense, a vesture,
and death consequently no interruption of the living man's existence,
but simply his extrication from the natural body&mdash;a process which
commences at the moment of what we term death, and the completion of
which, at furthest a few days later, is the resurrection "in
power."</p>

<p>The person who weighs the consequences of these positions will
probably see their practical bearing upon medical science. This is,
however, by no means the proper place for displaying the proofs and
discussing the consequences of this too generally unrecognized state of
facts.</p>

<p>In pursuance of my habit, I was covertly observing Mr. Jennings,
with all my caution&mdash;I think he perceived it&mdash;and I saw
plainly that he was as cautiously observing me. Lady Mary happening to
address me by my name, as Dr. Hesselius, I saw that he glanced at me
more sharply, and then became thoughtful for a few minutes.</p>

<p>After this, as I conversed with a gentleman at the other end of the
room, I saw him look at me more steadily, and with an interest which I
thought I understood. I then saw him take an opportunity of chatting
with Lady Mary, and was, as one always is, perfectly aware of being the
subject of a distant inquiry and answer.</p>

<p>This tall clergyman approached me by-and-by; and in a little time we
had got into conversation. When two people, who like reading, and know
books and places, having travelled, wish to discourse, it is very
strange if they can't find topics. It was not accident that brought him
near me, and led him into conversation. He knew German and had read my
Essays on Metaphysical Medicine which suggest more than they actually
say.</p>

<p>This courteous man, gentle, shy, plainly a man of thought and
reading, who moving and talking among us, was not altogether of us, and
whom I already suspected of leading a life whose transactions and
alarms were carefully concealed, with an impenetrable reserve from, not
only the world, but his best beloved friends&mdash;was cautiously
weighing in his own mind the idea of taking a certain step with regard
to me.</p>

<p>I penetrated his thoughts without his being aware of it, and was
careful to say nothing which could betray to his sensitive vigilance my
suspicions respecting his position, or my surmises about his plans
respecting myself.</p>

<p>We chatted upon indifferent subjects for a time but at last he
said:</p>

<p>"I was very much interested by some papers of yours, Dr. Hesselius,
upon what you term Metaphysical Medicine&mdash;I read them in German,
ten or twelve years ago&mdash;have they been translated?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure they have not&mdash;I should have heard. They would
have asked my leave, I think."</p>

<p>"I asked the publishers here, a few months ago, to get the book for
me in the original German; but they tell me it is out of print."</p>

<p>"So it is, and has been for some years; but it flatters me as an
author to find that you have not forgotten my little book, although," I
added, laughing, "ten or twelve years is a considerable time to have
managed without it; but I suppose you have been turning the subject
over again in your mind, or something has happened lately to revive
your interest in it."</p>

<p>At this remark, accompanied by a glance of inquiry, a sudden
embarrassment disturbed Mr. Jennings, analogous to that which makes a
young lady blush and look foolish. He dropped his eyes, and folded his
hands together uneasily, and looked oddly, and you would have said,
guiltily, for a moment.</p>

<p>I helped him out of his awkwardness in the best way, by appearing
not to observe it, and going straight on, I said: "Those revivals of
interest in a subject happen to me often; one book suggests another,
and often sends me back a wild-goose chase over an interval of twenty
years. But if you still care to possess a copy, I shall be only too
happy to provide you; I have still got two or three by me&mdash;and if
you allow me to present one I shall be very much honoured."</p>

<p>"You are very good indeed," he said, quite at his ease again, in a
moment: "I almost despaired&mdash;I don't know how to thank you."</p>

<p>"Pray don't say a word; the thing is really so little worth that I
am only ashamed of having offered it, and if you thank me any more I
shall throw it into the fire in a fit of modesty."</p>

<p>Mr. Jennings laughed. He inquired where I was staying in London, and
after a little more conversation on a variety of subjects, he took his
departure.</p>

<h2><a name="c1-2"></a>Chapter II - <i>The Doctor Questions Lady Mary
and She Answers</i></h2>

<p>"I like your vicar so much, Lady Mary," said I, as soon as he was
gone. "He has read, travelled, and thought, and having also suffered,
he ought to be an accomplished companion."</p>

<p>"So he is, and, better still, he is a really good man," said she.
"His advice is invaluable about my schools, and all my little
undertakings at Dawlbridge, and he's so painstaking, he takes so much
trouble&mdash;you have no idea&mdash;wherever he thinks he can be of
use: he's so good-natured and so sensible."</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to hear so good an account of his neighbourly
virtues. I can only testify to his being an agreeable and gentle
companion, and in addition to what you have told me, I think I can tell
you two or three things about him," said I.</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"Yes, to begin with, he's unmarried."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"He has been writing, that is he <i>was</i>, but for two or three
years perhaps, he has not gone on with his work, and the book was upon
some rather abstract subject&mdash;perhaps theology."</p>

<p>"Well, he was writing a book, as you say; I'm not quite sure what it
was about, but only that it was nothing that I cared for; very likely
you are right, and he certainly did stop&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And although he only drank a little coffee here to-night, he likes
tea, at least, did like it extravagantly."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's <i>quite</i> true."</p>

<p>"He drank green tea, a good deal, didn't he?" I pursued.</p>

<p>"Well, that's very odd! Green tea was a subject on which we used
almost to quarrel."</p>

<p>"But he has quite given that up," said I.</p>

<p>"So he has."</p>

<p>"And, now, one more fact. His mother or his father, did you know
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, both; his father is only ten years dead, and their place is
near Dawlbridge. We knew them very well," she answered.</p>

<p>"Well, either his mother or his father&mdash;I should rather think
his father, saw a ghost," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you really are a conjurer, Dr. Hesselius."</p>

<p>"Conjurer or no, haven't I said right?" I answered merrily.</p>

<p>"You certainly have, and it <i>was</i> his father: he was a silent,
whimsical man, and he used to bore my father about his dreams, and at
last he told him a story about a ghost he had seen and talked with, and
a very odd story it was. I remember it particularly, because I was so
afraid of him. This story was long before he died&mdash;when I was
quite a child&mdash;and his ways were so silent and moping, and he used
to drop in sometimes, in the dusk, when I was alone in the
drawing-room, and I used to fancy there were ghosts about him."</p>

<p>I smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"And now, having established my character as a conjurer, I think I
must say good-night," said I.</p>

<p>"But how <i>did</i> you find it out?"</p>

<p>"By the planets, of course, as the gipsies do," I answered, and so,
gaily we said good-night.</p>

<p>Next morning I sent the little book he had been inquiring after, and
a note to Mr. Jennings, and on returning late that evening, I found
that he had called at my lodgings, and left his card. He asked whether
I was at home, and asked at what hour he would be most likely to find
me.</p>

<p>Does he intend opening his case, and consulting me "professionally,"
as they say? I hope so. I have already conceived a theory about him. It
is supported by Lady Mary's answers to my parting questions. I should
like much to ascertain from his own lips. But what can I do
consistently with good breeding to invite a confession? Nothing. I
rather think he meditates one. At all events, my dear Van L., I shan't
make myself difficult of access; I mean to return his visit tomorrow.
It will be only civil in return for his politeness, to ask to see him.
Perhaps something may come of it. Whether much, little, or nothing, my
dear Van L., you shall hear.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-3"></a>Chapter III - <i>Dr. Hesselius Picks Up
Something in Latin Books</i></h2>

<p>Well, I have called at Blank Street.</p>

<p>On inquiring at the door, the servant told me that Mr. Jennings was
engaged very particularly with a gentleman, a clergyman from Kenlis,
his parish in the country. Intending to reserve my privilege, and to
call again, I merely intimated that I should try another time, and had
turned to go, when the servant begged my pardon, and asked me, looking
at me a little more attentively than well-bred persons of his order
usually do, whether I was Dr. Hesselius; and, on learning that I was,
he said, "Perhaps then, sir, you would allow me to mention it to Mr.
Jennings, for I am sure he wishes to see you."</p>

<p>The servant returned in a moment, with a message from Mr. Jennings,
asking me to go into his study, which was in effect his back
drawing-room, promising to be with me in a very few minutes.</p>

<p>This was really a study&mdash;almost a library. The room was lofty,
with two tall slender windows, and rich dark curtains. It was much
larger than I had expected, and stored with books on every side, from
the floor to the ceiling. The upper carpet&mdash;for to my tread it
felt that there were two or three&mdash;was a Turkey carpet. My steps
fell noiselessly. The bookcases standing out, placed the windows,
particularly narrow ones, in deep recesses. The effect of the room was,
although extremely comfortable, and even luxurious, decidedly gloomy,
and aided by the silence, almost oppressive. Perhaps, however, I ought
to have allowed something for association. My mind had connected
peculiar ideas with Mr. Jennings. I stepped into this perfectly silent
room, of a very silent house, with a peculiar foreboding; and its
darkness, and solemn clothing of books, for except where two narrow
looking-glasses were set in the wall, they were everywhere, helped this
somber feeling.</p>

<p>While awaiting Mr. Jennings' arrival, I amused myself by looking
into some of the books with which his shelves were laden. Not among
these, but immediately under them, with their backs upward, on the
floor, I lighted upon a complete set of Swedenborg's "Arcana
Caelestia," in the original Latin, a very fine folio set, bound in the
natty livery which theology affects, pure vellum, namely, gold letters,
and carmine edges. There were paper markers in several of these
volumes, I raised and placed them, one after the other, upon the table,
and opening where these papers were placed, I read in the solemn Latin
phraseology, a series of sentences indicated by a pencilled line at the
margin. Of these I copy here a few, translating them into English.</p>

<p>"When man's interior sight is opened, which is that of his spirit,
then there appear the things of another life, which cannot possibly be
made visible to the bodily sight."...</p>

<p>"By the internal sight it has been granted me to see the things that
are in the other life, more clearly than I see those that are in the
world. From these considerations, it is evident that external vision
exists from interior vision, and this from a vision still more
interior, and so on."...</p>

<p>"There are with every man at least two evil spirits."...</p>

<p>"With wicked genii there is also a fluent speech, but harsh and
grating. There is also among them a speech which is not fluent, wherein
the dissent of the thoughts is perceived as something secretly creeping
along within it."</p>

<p>"The evil spirits associated with man are, indeed from the hells,
but when with man they are not then in hell, but are taken out thence.
The place where they then are, is in the midst between heaven and hell,
and is called the world of spirits&mdash;when the evil spirits who are
with man, are in that world, they are not in any infernal torment, but
in every thought and affection of man, and so, in all that the man
himself enjoys. But when they are remitted into their hell, they return
to their former state."...</p>

<p>"If evil spirits could perceive that they were associated with man,
and yet that they were spirits separate from him, and if they could
flow in into the things of his body, they would attempt by a thousand
means to destroy him; for they hate man with a deadly hatred."...</p>

<p>"Knowing, therefore, that I was a man in the body, they were
continually striving to destroy me, not as to the body only, but
especially as to the soul; for to destroy any man or spirit is the very
delight of the life of all who are in hell; but I have been continually
protected by the Lord. Hence it appears how dangerous it is for man to
be in a living consort with spirits, unless he be in the good of
faith."...</p>

<p>"Nothing is more carefully guarded from the knowledge of associate
spirits than their being thus conjoint with a man, for if they knew it
they would speak to him, with the intention to destroy him."...</p>

<p>"The delight of hell is to do evil to man, and to hasten his eternal
ruin."</p>

<p>A long note, written with a very sharp and fine pencil, in Mr.
Jennings' neat hand, at the foot of the page, caught my eye. Expecting
his criticism upon the text, I read a word or two, and stopped, for it
was something quite different, and began with these words, <i>Deus
misereatur mei</i>&mdash;"May God compassionate me." Thus warned of its
private nature, I averted my eyes, and shut the book, replacing all the
volumes as I had found them, except one which interested me, and in
which, as men studious and solitary in their habits will do, I grew so
absorbed as to take no cognisance of the outer world, nor to remember
where I was.</p>

<p>I was reading some pages which refer to "representatives" and
"correspondents," in the technical language of Swedenborg, and had
arrived at a passage, the substance of which is, that evil spirits,
when seen by other eyes than those of their infernal associates,
present themselves, by "correspondence," in the shape of the beast
(<i>fera</i>) which represents their particular lust and life, in
aspect direful and atrocious. This is a long passage, and
particularises a number of those bestial forms.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-4"></a>Chapter IV - <i>Four Eyes Were Reading the
Passage</i></h2>

<p>I was running the head of my pencil-case along the line as I read
it, and something caused me to raise my eyes.</p>

<p>Directly before me was one of the mirrors I have mentioned, in which
I saw reflected the tall shape of my friend, Mr. Jennings, leaning over
my shoulder, and reading the page at which I was busy, and with a face
so dark and wild that I should hardly have known him.</p>

<p>I turned and rose. He stood erect also, and with an effort laughed a
little, saying:</p>

<p>"I came in and asked you how you did, but without succeeding in
awaking you from your book; so I could not restrain my curiosity, and
very impertinently, I'm afraid, peeped over your shoulder. This is not
your first time of looking into those pages. You have looked into
Swedenborg, no doubt, long ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, yes! I owe Swedenborg a great deal; you will discover
traces of him in the little book on Metaphysical Medicine, which you
were so good as to remember."</p>

<p>Although my friend affected a gaiety of manner, there was a slight
flush in his face, and I could perceive that he was inwardly much
perturbed.</p>

<p>"I'm scarcely yet qualified, I know so little of Swedenborg. I've
only had them a fortnight," he answered, "and I think they are rather
likely to make a solitary man nervous&mdash;that is, judging from the
very little I have read&mdash;I don't say that they have made me so,"
he laughed; "and I'm so very much obliged for the book. I hope you got
my note?"</p>

<p>I made all proper acknowledgments and modest disclaimers.</p>

<p>"I never read a book that I go with, so entirely, as that of yours,"
he continued. "I saw at once there is more in it than is quite
unfolded. Do you know Dr. Harley?" he asked, rather abruptly.</p>

<p>In passing, the editor remarks that the physician here named was one
of the most eminent who had ever practised in England.</p>

<p>I did, having had letters to him, and had experienced from him great
courtesy and considerable assistance during my visit to England.</p>

<p>"I think that man one of the very greatest fools I ever met in my
life," said Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p>This was the first time I had ever heard him say a sharp thing of
anybody, and such a term applied to so high a name a little startled
me.</p>

<p>"Really! and in what way?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In his profession," he answered.</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"I mean this," he said: "he seems to me, one half blind&mdash;I
mean one half of all he looks at is dark&mdash;preternaturally bright
and vivid all the rest; and the worst of it is, it seems <i>wilful</i>.
I can't get him&mdash;I mean he won't&mdash;I've had some experience of
him as a physician, but I look on him as, in that sense, no better than
a paralytic mind, an intellect half dead. I'll tell you&mdash;I know I
shall some time&mdash;all about it," he said, with a little agitation.
"You stay some months longer in England. If I should be out of town
during your stay for a little time, would you allow me to trouble you
with a letter?"</p>

<p>"I should be only too happy," I assured him.</p>

<p>"Very good of you. I am so utterly dissatisfied with Harley."</p>

<p>"A little leaning to the materialistic school," I said.</p>

<p>"A <i>mere</i> materialist," he corrected me; "you can't think how
that sort of thing worries one who knows better. You won't tell any
one&mdash;any of my friends you know&mdash;that I am hippish; now, for
instance, no one knows&mdash;not even Lady Mary&mdash;that I have seen
Dr. Harley, or any other doctor. So pray don't mention it; and, if I
should have any threatening of an attack, you'll kindly let me write,
or, should I be in town, have a little talk with you."</p>

<p>I was full of conjecture, and unconsciously I found I had fixed my
eyes gravely on him, for he lowered his for a moment, and he said:</p>

<p>"I see you think I might as well tell you now, or else you are
forming a conjecture; but you may as well give it up. If you were
guessing all the rest of your life, you will never hit on it."</p>

<p>He shook his head smiling, and over that wintry sunshine a black
cloud suddenly came down, and he drew his breath in, through his teeth
as men do in pain.</p>

<p>"Sorry, of course, to learn that you apprehend occasion to consult
any of us; but, command me when and how you like, and I need not assure
you that your confidence is sacred."</p>

<p>He then talked of quite other things, and in a comparatively
cheerful way and after a little time, I took my leave.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-5"></a>Chapter V - <i>Dr. Hesselius is Summoned to
Richmond</i></h2>

<p>We parted cheerfully, but he was not cheerful, nor was I. There are
certain expressions of that powerful organ of spirit&mdash;the human
face&mdash;which, although I have seen them often, and possess a
doctor's nerve, yet disturb me profoundly. One look of Mr. Jennings
haunted me. It had seized my imagination with so dismal a power that I
changed my plans for the evening, and went to the opera, feeling that I
wanted a change of ideas.</p>

<p>I heard nothing of or from him for two or three days, when a note in
his hand reached me. It was cheerful, and full of hope. He said that he
had been for some little time so much better&mdash;quite well, in
fact&mdash;that he was going to make a little experiment, and run down
for a month or so to his parish, to try whether a little work might not
quite set him up. There was in it a fervent religious expression of
gratitude for his restoration, as he now almost hoped he might call
it.</p>

<p>A day or two later I saw Lady Mary, who repeated what his note had
announced, and told me that he was actually in Warwickshire, having
resumed his clerical duties at Kenlis; and she added, "I begin to think
that he is really perfectly well, and that there never was anything the
matter, more than nerves and fancy; we are all nervous, but I fancy
there is nothing like a little hard work for that kind of weakness, and
he has made up his mind to try it. I should not be surprised if he did
not come back for a year."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this confidence, only two days later I had this
note, dated from his house off Piccadilly:</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have returned disappointed. If I should feel at
all able to see you, I shall write to ask you kindly to call. At
present, I am too low, and, in fact, simply unable to say all I wish to
say. Pray don't mention my name to my friends. I can see no one.
By-and-by, please God, you shall hear from me. I mean to take a run
into Shropshire, where some of my people are. God bless you! May we, on
my return, meet more happily than I can now write.</p>

<p>About a week after this I saw Lady Mary at her own house, the last
person, she said, left in town, and just on the wing for Brighton, for
the London season was quite over. She told me that she had heard from
Mr. Jenning's niece, Martha, in Shropshire. There was nothing to be
gathered from her letter, more than that he was low and nervous. In
those words, of which healthy people think so lightly, what a world of
suffering is sometimes hidden!</p>

<p>Nearly five weeks had passed without any further news of Mr.
Jennings. At the end of that time I received a note from him. He
wrote:</p>

<p>"I have been in the country, and have had change of air, change of
scene, change of faces, change of everything&mdash;and in
everything&mdash;but <i>myself</i>. I have made up my mind, so far as
the most irresolute creature on earth can do it, to tell my case fully
to you. If your engagements will permit, pray come to me to-day,
to-morrow, or the next day; but, pray defer as little as possible. You
know not how much I need help. I have a quiet house at Richmond, where
I now am. Perhaps you can manage to come to dinner, or to luncheon, or
even to tea. You shall have no trouble in finding me out. The servant
at Blank Street, who takes this note, will have a carriage at your door
at any hour you please; and I am always to be found. You will say that
I ought not to be alone. I have tried everything. Come and see."</p>

<p>I called up the servant, and decided on going out the same evening,
which accordingly I did.</p>

<p>He would have been much better in a lodging-house, or hotel, I
thought, as I drove up through a short double row of sombre elms to a
very old-fashioned brick house, darkened by the foliage of these trees,
which overtopped, and nearly surrounded it. It was a perverse choice,
for nothing could be imagined more triste and silent. The house, I
found, belonged to him. He had stayed for a day or two in town, and,
finding it for some cause insupportable, had come out here, probably
because being furnished and his own, he was relieved of the thought and
delay of selection, by coming here.</p>

<p>The sun had already set, and the red reflected light of the western
sky illuminated the scene with the peculiar effect with which we are
all familiar. The hall seemed very dark, but, getting to the back
drawing-room, whose windows command the west, I was again in the same
dusky light.</p>

<p>I sat down, looking out upon the richly-wooded landscape that glowed
in the grand and melancholy light which was every moment fading. The
corners of the room were already dark; all was growing dim, and the
gloom was insensibly toning my mind, already prepared for what was
sinister. I was waiting alone for his arrival, which soon took place.
The door communicating with the front room opened, and the tall figure
of Mr. Jennings, faintly seen in the ruddy twilight, came, with quiet
stealthy steps, into the room.</p>

<p>We shook hands, and, taking a chair to the window, where there was
still light enough to enable us to see each other's faces, he sat down
beside me, and, placing his hand upon my arm, with scarcely a word of
preface began his narrative.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-6"></a>Chapter VI - <i>How Mr. Jennings Met His
Companion</i></h2>

<p>The faint glow of the west, the pomp of the then lonely woods of
Richmond, were before us, behind and about us the darkening room, and
on the stony face of the sufferer&mdash;for the character of his face,
though still gentle and sweet, was changed&mdash;rested that dim, odd
glow which seems to descend and produce, where it touches, lights,
sudden though faint, which are lost, almost without gradation, in
darkness. The silence, too, was utter: not a distant wheel, or bark, or
whistle from without; and within the depressing stillness of an invalid
bachelor's house.</p>

<p>I guessed well the nature, though not even vaguely the particulars
of the revelations I was about to receive, from that fixed face of
suffering that so oddly flushed stood out, like a portrait of
Schalken's, before its background of darkness.</p>

<p>"It began," he said, "on the 15th of October, three years and eleven
weeks ago, and two days&mdash;I keep very accurate count, for every day
is torment. If I leave anywhere a chasm in my narrative, tell me.</p>

<p>"About four years ago I began a work, which had cost me very much
thought and reading. It was upon the religious metaphysics of the
ancients."</p>

<p>"I know," said I, "the actual religion of educated and thinking
paganism, quite apart from symbolic worship? A wide and very
interesting field."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not good for the mind&mdash;the Christian mind, I mean.
Paganism is all bound together in essential unity, and, with evil
sympathy, their religion involves their art, and both their manners,
and the subject is a degrading fascination and the Nemesis sure. God
forgive me!</p>

<p>"I wrote a great deal; I wrote late at night. I was always thinking
on the subject, walking about, wherever I was, everywhere. It
thoroughly infected me. You are to remember that all the material ideas
connected with it were more or less of the beautiful, the subject
itself delightfully interesting, and I, then, without a care."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I believe, that every one who sets about writing in earnest does
his work, as a friend of mine phrased it, <i>on</i>
something&mdash;tea, or coffee, or tobacco. I suppose there is a
material waste that must be hourly supplied in such occupations, or
that we should grow too abstracted, and the mind, as it were, pass out
of the body, unless it were reminded often enough of the connection by
actual sensation. At all events, I felt the want, and I supplied it.
Tea was my companion&mdash;at first the ordinary black tea, made in the
usual way, not too strong: but I drank a good deal, and increased its
strength as I went on. I never experienced an uncomfortable symptom
from it. I began to take a little green tea. I found the effect
pleasanter, it cleared and intensified the power of thought so, I had
come to take it frequently, but not stronger than one might take it for
pleasure. I wrote a great deal out here, it was so quiet, and in this
room. I used to sit up very late, and it became a habit with me to sip
my tea&mdash;green tea&mdash;every now and then as my work proceeded. I
had a little kettle on my table, that swung over a lamp, and made tea
two or three times between eleven o'clock and two or three in the
morning, my hours of going to bed. I used to go into town every day. I
was not a monk, and, although I spent an hour or two in a library,
hunting up authorities and looking out lights upon my theme, I was in
no morbid state as far as I can judge. I met my friends pretty much as
usual and enjoyed their society, and, on the whole, existence had never
been, I think, so pleasant before.</p>

<p>"I had met with a man who had some odd old books, German editions in
mediaeval Latin, and I was only too happy to be permitted access to
them. This obliging person's books were in the City, a very
out-of-the-way part of it. I had rather out-stayed my intended hour,
and, on coming out, seeing no cab near, I was tempted to get into the
omnibus which used to drive past this house. It was darker than this by
the time the 'bus had reached an old house, you may have remarked, with
four poplars at each side of the door, and there the last passenger but
myself got out. We drove along rather faster. It was twilight now. I
leaned back in my corner next the door ruminating pleasantly.</p>

<p>"The interior of the omnibus was nearly dark. I had observed in the
corner opposite to me at the other side, and at the end next the
horses, two small circular reflections, as it seemed to me of a reddish
light. They were about two inches apart, and about the size of those
small brass buttons that yachting men used to put upon their jackets. I
began to speculate, as listless men will, upon this trifle, as it
seemed. From what centre did that faint but deep red light come, and
from what&mdash;glass beads, buttons, toy decorations&mdash;was it
reflected? We were lumbering along gently, having nearly a mile still
to go. I had not solved the puzzle, and it became in another minute
more odd, for these two luminous points, with a sudden jerk, descended
nearer and nearer the floor, keeping still their relative distance and
horizontal position, and then, as suddenly, they rose to the level of
the seat on which I was sitting and I saw them no more.</p>

<p>"My curiosity was now really excited, and, before I had time to
think, I saw again these two dull lamps, again together near the floor;
again they disappeared, and again in their old corner I saw them.</p>

<p>"So, keeping my eyes upon them, I edged quietly up my own side,
towards the end at which I still saw these tiny discs of red.</p>

<p>"There was very little light in the 'bus. It was nearly dark. I
leaned forward to aid my endeavour to discover what these little
circles really were. They shifted position a little as I did so. I
began now to perceive an outline of something black, and I soon saw,
with tolerable distinctness, the outline of a small black monkey,
pushing its face forward in mimicry to meet mine; those were its eyes,
and I now dimly saw its teeth grinning at me.</p>

<p>"I drew back, not knowing whether it might not meditate a spring. I
fancied that one of the passengers had forgot this ugly pet, and
wishing to ascertain something of its temper, though not caring to
trust my fingers to it, I poked my umbrella softly towards it. It
remained immovable&mdash;up to it&mdash;<i>through</i> it. For through
it, and back and forward it passed, without the slightest
resistance.</p>

<p>"I can't, in the least, convey to you the kind of horror that I
felt. When I had ascertained that the thing was an illusion, as I then
supposed, there came a misgiving about myself and a terror that
fascinated me in impotence to remove my gaze from the eyes of the brute
for some moments. As I looked, it made a little skip back, quite into
the corner, and I, in a panic, found myself at the door, having put my
head out, drawing deep breaths of the outer air, and staring at the
lights and tress we were passing, too glad to reassure myself of
reality.</p>

<p>"I stopped the 'bus and got out. I perceived the man look oddly at
me as I paid him. I dare say there was something unusual in my looks
and manner, for I had never felt so strangely before."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-7"></a>Chapter VII - <i>The Journey: First Stage</i></h2>

<p>"When the omnibus drove on, and I was alone upon the road, I looked
carefully round to ascertain whether the monkey had followed me. To my
indescribable relief I saw it nowhere. I can't describe easily what a
shock I had received, and my sense of genuine gratitude on finding
myself, as I supposed, quite rid of it.</p>

<p>"I had got out a little before we reached this house, two or three
hundred steps. A brick wall runs along the footpath, and inside the
wall is a hedge of yew, or some dark evergreen of that kind, and within
that again the row of fine trees which you may have remarked as you
came.</p>

<p>"This brick wall is about as high as my shoulder, and happening to
raise my eyes I saw the monkey, with that stooping gait, on all fours,
walking or creeping, close beside me, on top of the wall. I stopped,
looking at it with a feeling of loathing and horror. As I stopped so
did it. It sat up on the wall with its long hands on its knees looking
at me. There was not light enough to see it much more than in outline,
nor was it dark enough to bring the peculiar light of its eyes into
strong relief. I still saw, however, that red foggy light plainly
enough. It did not show its teeth, nor exhibit any sign of irritation,
but seemed jaded and sulky, and was observing me steadily.</p>

<p>"I drew back into the middle of the road. It was an unconscious
recoil, and there I stood, still looking at it. It did not move.</p>

<p>"With an instinctive determination to try something&mdash;anything,
I turned about and walked briskly towards town with askance look, all
the time, watching the movements of the beast. It crept swiftly along
the wall, at exactly my pace.</p>

<p>"Where the wall ends, near the turn of the road, it came down, and
with a wiry spring or two brought itself close to my feet, and
continued to keep up with me, as I quickened my pace. It was at my left
side, so close to my leg that I felt every moment as if I should tread
upon it.</p>

<p>"The road was quite deserted and silent, and it was darker every
moment. I stopped dismayed and bewildered, turning as I did so, the
other way&mdash;I mean, towards this house, away from which I had been
walking. When I stood still, the monkey drew back to a distance of, I
suppose, about five or six yards, and remained stationary, watching
me.</p>

<p>"I had been more agitated than I have said. I had read, of course,
as everyone has, something about 'spectral illusions,' as you
physicians term the phenomena of such cases. I considered my situation,
and looked my misfortune in the face.</p>

<p>"These affections, I had read, are sometimes transitory and
sometimes obstinate. I had read of cases in which the appearance, at
first harmless, had, step by step, degenerated into something direful
and insupportable, and ended by wearing its victim out. Still as I
stood there, but for my bestial companion, quite alone, I tried to
comfort myself by repeating again and again the assurance, 'the thing
is purely disease, a well-known physical affection, as distinctly as
small-pox or neuralgia. Doctors are all agreed on that, philosophy
demonstrates it. I must not be a fool. I've been sitting up too late,
and I daresay my digestion is quite wrong, and, with God's help, I
shall be all right, and this is but a symptom of nervous dyspepsia.'
Did I believe all this? Not one word of it, no more than any other
miserable being ever did who is once seized and riveted in this satanic
captivity. Against my convictions, I might say my knowledge, I was
simply bullying myself into a false courage.</p>

<p>"I now walked homeward. I had only a few hundred yards to go. I had
forced myself into a sort of resignation, but I had not got over the
sickening shock and the flurry of the first certainty of my
misfortune.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind to pass the night at home. The brute moved close
beside me, and I fancied there was the sort of anxious drawing toward
the house, which one sees in tired horses or dogs, sometimes as they
come toward home.</p>

<p>"I was afraid to go into town, I was afraid of any one's seeing and
recognizing me. I was conscious of an irrepressible agitation in my
manner. Also, I was afraid of any violent change in my habits, such as
going to a place of amusement, or walking from home in order to fatigue
myself. At the hall door it waited till I mounted the steps, and when
the door was opened entered with me.</p>

<p>"I drank no tea that night. I got cigars and some brandy and water.
My idea was that I should act upon my material system, and by living
for a while in sensation apart from thought, send myself forcibly, as
it were, into a new groove. I came up here to this drawing-room. I sat
just here. The monkey then got upon a small table that then stood
<i>there</i>. It looked dazed and languid. An irrepressible uneasiness
as to its movements kept my eyes always upon it. Its eyes were half
closed, but I could see them glow. It was looking steadily at me. In
all situations, at all hours, it is awake and looking at me. That never
changes.</p>

<p>"I shall not continue in detail my narrative of this particular
night. I shall describe, rather, the phenomena of the first year, which
never varied, essentially. I shall describe the monkey as it appeared
in daylight. In the dark, as you shall presently hear, there are
peculiarities. It is a small monkey, perfectly black. It had only one
peculiarity&mdash;a character of malignity&mdash;unfathomable
malignity. During the first year it looked sullen and sick. But this
character of intense malice and vigilance was always underlying that
surly languor. During all that time it acted as if on a plan of giving
me as little trouble as was consistent with watching me. Its eyes were
never off me. I have never lost sight of it, except in my sleep, light
or dark, day or night, since it came here, excepting when it withdraws
for some weeks at a time, unaccountably.</p>

<p>"In total dark it is visible as in daylight. I do not mean merely
its eyes. It is <i>all</i> visible distinctly in a halo that resembles
a glow of red embers, and which accompanies it in all its
movements.</p>

<p>"When it leaves me for a time, it is always at night, in the dark,
and in the same way. It grows at first uneasy, and then furious, and
then advances towards me, grinning and shaking, its paws clenched, and,
at the same time, there comes the appearance of fire in the grate. I
never have any fire. I can't sleep in the room where there is any, and
it draws nearer and nearer to the chimney, quivering, it seems, with
rage, and when its fury rises to the highest pitch, it springs into the
grate, and up the chimney, and I see it no more.</p>

<p>"When first this happened, I thought I was released. I was now a new
man. A day passed&mdash;a night&mdash;and no return, and a blessed
week&mdash;a week&mdash;another week. I was always on my knees, Dr.
Hesselius, always, thanking God and praying. A whole month passed of
liberty, but on a sudden, it was with me again."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-8"></a>Chapter VIII - <i>The Second Stage</i></h2>

<p>"It was with me, and the malice which before was torpid under a
sullen exterior, was now active. It was perfectly unchanged in every
other respect. This new energy was apparent in its activity and its
looks, and soon in other ways.</p>

<p>"For a time, you will understand, the change was shown only in an
increased vivacity, and an air of menace, as if it were always brooding
over some atrocious plan. Its eyes, as before, were never off me."</p>

<p>"Is it here now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "it has been absent exactly a fortnight and a
day&mdash;fifteen days. It has sometimes been away so long as nearly
two months, once for three. Its absence always exceeds a fortnight,
although it may be but by a single day. Fifteen days having past since
I saw it last, it may return now at any moment."</p>

<p>"Is its return," I asked, "accompanied by any peculiar
manifestation?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;no," he said. "It is simply with me again. On lifting
my eyes from a book, or turning my head, I see it, as usual, looking at
me, and then it remains, as before, for its appointed time. I have
never told so much and so minutely before to any one."</p>

<p>I perceived that he was agitated, and looking like death, and he
repeatedly applied his handkerchief to his forehead; I suggested that
he might be tired, and told him that I would call, with pleasure, in
the morning, but he said:</p>

<p>"No, if you don't mind hearing it all now. I have got so far, and I
should prefer making one effort of it. When I spoke to Dr. Harley, I
had nothing like so much to tell. You are a philosophic physician. You
give spirit its proper rank. If this thing is real&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused looking at me with agitated inquiry.</p>

<p>"We can discuss it by-and-by, and very fully. I will give you all I
think," I answered, after an interval.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;very well. If it is anything real, I say, it is
prevailing, little by little, and drawing me more interiorly into hell.
Optic nerves, he talked of. Ah! well&mdash;there are other nerves of
communication. May God Almighty help me! You shall hear.</p>

<p>"Its power of action, I tell you, had increased. Its malice became,
in a way, aggressive. About two years ago, some questions that were
pending between me and the bishop having been settled, I went down to
my parish in Warwickshire, anxious to find occupation in my profession.
I was not prepared for what happened, although I have since thought I
might have apprehended something like it. The reason of my saying so is
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was beginning to speak with a great deal more effort and
reluctance, and sighed often, and seemed at times nearly overcome. But
at this time his manner was not agitated. It was more like that of a
sinking patient, who has given himself up.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will first tell you about Kenlis, my parish.</p>

<p>"It was with me when I left this place for Dawlbridge. It was my
silent travelling companion, and it remained with me at the vicarage.
When I entered on the discharge of my duties, another change took
place. The thing exhibited an atrocious determination to thwart me. It
was with me in the church&mdash;in the reading-desk&mdash;in the
pulpit&mdash;within the communion rails. At last, it reached this
extremity, that while I was reading to the congregation, it would
spring upon the book and squat there, so that I was unable to see the
page. This happened more than once.</p>

<p>"I left Dawlbridge for a time. I placed myself in Dr. Harley's
hands. I did everything he told me. He gave my case a great deal of
thought. It interested him, I think. He seemed successful. For nearly
three months I was perfectly free from a return. I began to think I was
safe. With his full assent I returned to Dawlbridge.</p>

<p>"I travelled in a chaise. I was in good spirits. I was more&mdash;I
was happy and grateful. I was returning, as I thought, delivered from a
dreadful hallucination, to the scene of duties which I longed to enter
upon. It was a beautiful sunny evening, everything looked serene and
cheerful, and I was delighted. I remember looking out of the window to
see the spire of my church at Kenlis among the trees, at the point
where one has the earliest view of it. It is exactly where the little
stream that bounds the parish passes under the road by a culvert, and
where it emerges at the road-side, a stone with an old inscription is
placed. As we passed this point, I drew my head in and sat down, and in
the corner of the chaise was the monkey.</p>

<p>"For a moment I felt faint, and then quite wild with despair and
horror. I called to the driver, and got out, and sat down at the
road-side, and prayed to God silently for mercy. A despairing
resignation supervened. My companion was with me as I re-entered the
vicarage. The same persecution followed. After a short struggle I
submitted, and soon I left the place.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, "that the beast has before this become in
certain ways aggressive. I will explain a little. It seemed to be
actuated by intense and increasing fury, whenever I said my prayers, or
even meditated prayer. It amounted at last to a dreadful interruption.
You will ask, how could a silent immaterial phantom effect that? It was
thus, whenever I meditated praying; It was always before me, and nearer
and nearer.</p>

<p>"It used to spring on a table, on the back of a chair, on the
chimney piece, and slowly to swing itself from side to side, looking at
me all the time. There is in its motion an indefinable power to
dissipate thought, and to contract one's attention to that monotony,
till the ideas shrink, as it were, to a point, and at last to
nothing&mdash;and unless I had started up, and shook off the catalepsy
I have felt as if my mind were on the point of losing itself. There are
other ways," he sighed heavily; "thus, for instance, while I pray with
my eyes closed, it comes closer and closer, and I see it. I know it is
not to be accounted for physically, but I do actually see it, though my
lids are closed, and so it rocks my mind, as it were, and overpowers me,
and I am obliged to rise from my knees. If you had ever yourself known
this, you would be acquainted with desperation."</p>

<h2><a name="c1-9"></a>Chapter IX - <i>The Third Stage</i></h2>

<p>"I see, Dr. Hesselius, that you don't lose one word of my statement.
I need not ask you to listen specially to what I am now going to tell
you. They talk of the optic nerves, and of spectral illusions, as if
the organ of sight was the only point assailable by the influences that
have fastened upon me&mdash;I know better. For two years in my direful
case that limitation prevailed. But as food is taken in softly at the
lips, and then brought under the teeth, as the tip of the little finger
caught in a mill crank will draw in the hand, and the arm, and the
whole body, so the miserable mortal who has been once caught firmly by
the end of the finest fibre of his nerve, is drawn in and in, by the
enormous machinery of hell, until he is as I am. Yes, Doctor, as
<i>I</i> am, for a while I talk to you, and implore relief, I feel that
my prayer is for the impossible, and my pleading with the
inexorable."</p>

<p>I endeavoured to calm his visibly increasing agitation, and told him
that he must not despair.</p>

<p>While we talked the night had overtaken us. The filmy moonlight was
wide over the scene which the window commanded, and I said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would prefer having candles. This light, you know, is
odd. I should wish you, as much as possible, under your usual
conditions while I make my diagnosis, shall I call it&mdash;otherwise I
don't care."</p>

<p>"All lights are the same to me," he said; "except when I read or
write, I care not if night were perpetual. I am going to tell you what
happened about a year ago. The thing began to speak to me."</p>

<p>"Speak! How do you mean&mdash;speak as a man does, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes; speak in words and consecutive sentences, with perfect
coherence and articulation; but there is a peculiarity. It is not like
the tone of a human voice. It is not by my ears it reaches me&mdash;it
comes like a singing through my head.</p>

<p>"This faculty, the power of speaking to me, will be my undoing. It
won't let me pray, it interrupts me with dreadful blasphemies. I dare
not go on, I could not. Oh! Doctor, can the skill, and thought, and
prayers of man avail me nothing!"</p>

<p>"You must promise me, my dear sir, not to trouble yourself with
unnecessarily exciting thoughts; confine yourself strictly to the
narrative of <i>facts</i>; and recollect, above all, that even if the
thing that infests you be, you seem to suppose a reality with an actual
independent life and will, yet it can have no power to hurt you, unless
it be given from above: its access to your senses depends mainly upon
your physical condition&mdash;this is, under God, your comfort and
reliance: we are all alike environed. It is only that in your case, the
<i>'paries,'</i> the veil of the flesh, the screen, is a little out of
repair, and sights and sounds are transmitted. We must enter on a new
course, sir,&mdash;be encouraged. I'll give to-night to the careful
consideration of the whole case."</p>

<p>"You are very good, sir; you think it worth trying, you don't give
me quite up; but, sir, you don't know, it is gaining such an influence
over me: it orders me about, it is such a tyrant, and I'm growing so
helpless. May God deliver me!"</p>

<p>"It orders you about&mdash;of course you mean by speech?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; it is always urging me to crimes, to injure others, or
myself. You see, Doctor, the situation is urgent, it is indeed. When I
was in Shropshire, a few weeks ago" (Mr. Jennings was speaking rapidly
and trembling now, holding my arm with one hand, and looking in my
face), "I went out one day with a party of friends for a walk: my
persecutor, I tell you, was with me at the time. I lagged behind the
rest: the country near the Dee, you know, is beautiful. Our path
happened to lie near a coal mine, and at the verge of the wood is a
perpendicular shaft, they say, a hundred and fifty feet deep. My niece
had remained behind with me&mdash;she knows, of course nothing of the
nature of my sufferings. She knew, however, that I had been ill, and
was low, and she remained to prevent my being quite alone. As we
loitered slowly on together, the brute that accompanied me was urging
me to throw myself down the shaft. I tell you now&mdash;oh, sir, think
of it!&mdash;the one consideration that saved me from that hideous
death was the fear lest the shock of witnessing the occurrence should
be too much for the poor girl. I asked her to go on and walk with her
friends, saying that I could go no further. She made excuses, and the
more I urged her the firmer she became. She looked doubtful and
frightened. I suppose there was something in my looks or manner that
alarmed her; but she would not go, and that literally saved me. You had
no idea, sir, that a living man could be made so abject a slave of
Satan," he said, with a ghastly groan and a shudder.</p>

<p>There was a pause here, and I said, "You <i>were</i> preserved
nevertheless. It was the act of God. You are in His hands and in the
power of no other being: be therefore confident for the future."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-10"></a>Chapter X - <i>Home</i></h2>

<p>I made him have candles lighted, and saw the room looking cheery and
inhabited before I left him. I told him that he must regard his illness
strictly as one dependent on physical, though <i>subtle</i> physical
causes. I told him that he had evidence of God's care and love in the
deliverance which he had just described, and that I had perceived with
pain that he seemed to regard its peculiar features as indicating that
he had been delivered over to spiritual reprobation. Than such a
conclusion nothing could be, I insisted, less warranted; and not only
so, but more contrary to facts, as disclosed in his mysterious
deliverance from that murderous influence during his Shropshire
excursion. First, his niece had been retained by his side without his
intending to keep her near him; and, secondly, there had been infused
into his mind an irresistible repugnance to execute the dreadful
suggestion in her presence.</p>

<p>As I reasoned this point with him, Mr. Jennings wept. He seemed
comforted. One promise I exacted, which was that should the monkey at
any time return, I should be sent for immediately; and, repeating my
assurance that I would give neither time nor thought to any other
subject until I had thoroughly investigated his case, and that
to-morrow he should hear the result, I took my leave.</p>

<p>Before getting into the carriage I told the servant that his master
was far from well, and that he should make a point of frequently
looking into his room. My own arrangements I made with a view to being
quite secure from interruption.</p>

<p>I merely called at my lodgings, and with a travelling-desk and
carpet-bag, set off in a hackney carriage for an inn about two miles
out of town, called "The Horns," a very quiet and comfortable house,
with good thick walls. And there I resolved, without the possibility of
intrusion or distraction, to devote some hours of the night, in my
comfortable sitting-room, to Mr. Jennings' case, and so much of the
morning as it might require.</p>

<p>(There occurs here a careful note of Dr. Hesselius' opinion upon the
case, and of the habits, dietary, and medicines which he prescribed. It
is curious&mdash;some persons would say mystical. But, on the whole, I
doubt whether it would sufficiently interest a reader of the kind I am
likely to meet with, to warrant its being here reprinted. The whole
letter was plainly written at the inn where he had hid himself for the
occasion. The next letter is dated from his town lodgings.)</p>

<p>I left town for the inn where I slept last night at half-past nine,
and did not arrive at my room in town until one o'clock this afternoon.
I found a letter in Mr. Jennings' hand upon my table. It had not come
by post, and, on inquiry, I learned that Mr. Jennings' servant had
brought it, and on learning that I was not to return until to-day, and
that no one could tell him my address, he seemed very uncomfortable,
and said his orders from his master were that that he was not to return
without an answer.</p>

<p>I opened the letter and read:</p>

<p>DEAR DR. HESSELIUS.&mdash;It is here. You had not been an hour gone
when it returned. It is speaking. It knows all that has happened. It
knows everything&mdash;it knows you, and is frantic and atrocious. It
reviles. I send you this. It knows every word I have written&mdash;I
write. This I promised, and I therefore write, but I fear very
confused, very incoherently. I am so interrupted, disturbed.</p>

<p>Ever yours, sincerely yours,</p>

<p>Robert Lynder Jennings.</p>

<p>"When did this come?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About eleven last night: the man was here again, and has been here
three times to-day. The last time is about an hour since."</p>

<p>Thus answered, and with the notes I had made upon his case in my
pocket, I was in a few minutes driving towards Richmond, to see Mr.
Jennings.</p>

<p>I by no means, as you perceive, despaired of Mr. Jennings' case. He
had himself remembered and applied, though quite in a mistaken way, the
principle which I lay down in my Metaphysical Medicine, and which
governs all such cases. I was about to apply it in earnest. I was
profoundly interested, and very anxious to see and examine him while
the "enemy" was actually present.</p>

<p>I drove up to the sombre house, and ran up the steps, and knocked.
The door, in a little time, was opened by a tall woman in black silk.
She looked ill, and as if she had been crying. She curtseyed, and heard
my question, but she did not answer. She turned her face away,
extending her hand towards two men who were coming down-stairs; and
thus having, as it were, tacitly made me over to them, she passed
through a side-door hastily and shut it.</p>

<p>The man who was nearest the hall, I at once accosted, but being now
close to him, I was shocked to see that both his hands were covered
with blood.</p>

<p>I drew back a little, and the man, passing downstairs, merely said
in a low tone, "Here's the servant, sir."</p>

<p>The servant had stopped on the stairs, confounded and dumb at seeing
me. He was rubbing his hands in a handkerchief, and it was steeped in
blood.</p>

<p>"Jones, what is it? what has happened?" I asked, while a sickening
suspicion overpowered me.</p>

<p>The man asked me to come up to the lobby. I was beside him in a
moment, and, frowning and pallid, with contracted eyes, he told me the
horror which I already half guessed.</p>

<p>His master had made away with himself.</p>

<p>I went upstairs with him to the room&mdash;what I saw there I won't
tell you. He had cut his throat with his razor. It was a frightful
gash. The two men had laid him on the bed, and composed his limbs. It
had happened, as the immense pool of blood on the floor declared, at
some distance between the bed and the window. There was carpet round
his bed, and a carpet under his dressing-table, but none on the rest of
the floor, for the man said he did not like a carpet on his bedroom. In
this sombre and now terrible room, one of the great elms that darkened
the house was slowly moving the shadow of one of its great boughs upon
this dreadful floor.</p>

<p>I beckoned to the servant, and we went downstairs together. I turned
off the hall into an old-fashioned panelled room, and there standing, I
heard all the servant had to tell. It was not a great deal.</p>

<p>"I concluded, sir, from your words, and looks, sir, as you left last
night, that you thought my master was seriously ill. I thought it might
be that you were afraid of a fit, or something. So I attended very
close to your directions. He sat up late, till past three o'clock. He
was not writing or reading. He was talking a great deal to himself, but
that was nothing unusual. At about that hour I assisted him to undress,
and left him in his slippers and dressing-gown. I went back softly in
about half-an-hour. He was in his bed, quite undressed, and a pair of
candles lighted on the table beside his bed. He was leaning on his
elbow, and looking out at the other side of the bed when I came in. I
asked him if he wanted anything, and he said No.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it was what you said to me, sir, or something
a little unusual about him, but I was uneasy, uncommon uneasy about him
last night.</p>

<p>"In another half hour, or it might be a little more, I went up
again. I did not hear him talking as before. I opened the door a
little. The candles were both out, which was not usual. I had a bedroom
candle, and I let the light in, a little bit, looking softly round. I
saw him sitting in that chair beside the dressing-table with his
clothes on again. He turned round and looked at me. I thought it
strange he should get up and dress, and put out the candles to sit in
the dark, that way. But I only asked him again if I could do anything
for him. He said, No, rather sharp, I thought. I asked him if I might
light the candles, and he said, 'Do as you like, Jones.' So I lighted
them, and I lingered about the room, and he said, 'Tell me truth,
Jones; why did you come again&mdash;you did not hear anyone cursing?'
'No, sir,' I said, wondering what he could mean.</p>

<p>"'No,' said he, after me, 'of course, no;' and I said to him,
'Wouldn't it be well, sir, you went to bed? It's just five o'clock;'
and he said nothing, but, 'Very likely; good-night, Jones.' So I went,
sir, but in less than an hour I came again. The door was fast, and he
heard me, and called as I thought from the bed to know what I wanted,
and he desired me not to disturb him again. I lay down and slept for a
little. It must have been between six and seven when I went up again.
The door was still fast, and he made no answer, so I did not like to
disturb him, and thinking he was asleep, I left him till nine. It was
his custom to ring when he wished me to come, and I had no particular
hour for calling him. I tapped very gently, and getting no answer, I
stayed away a good while, supposing he was getting some rest then. It
was not till eleven o'clock I grew really uncomfortable about
him&mdash;for at the latest he was never, that I could remember, later
than half-past ten. I got no answer. I knocked and called, and still no
answer. So not being able to force the door, I called Thomas from the
stables, and together we forced it, and found him in the shocking way
you saw."</p>

<p>Jones had no more to tell. Poor Mr. Jennings was very gentle, and
very kind. All his people were fond of him. I could see that the
servant was very much moved.</p>

<p>So, dejected and agitated, I passed from that terrible house, and
its dark canopy of elms, and I hope I shall never see it more. While I
write to you I feel like a man who has but half waked from a frightful
and monotonous dream. My memory rejects the picture with incredulity
and horror. Yet I know it is true. It is the story of the process of a
poison, a poison which excites the reciprocal action of spirit and
nerve, and paralyses the tissue that separates those cognate functions
of the senses, the external and the interior. Thus we find strange
bed-fellows, and the mortal and immortal prematurely make
acquaintance.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c1-11"></a>Conclusion - <i>A Word for Those Who
Suffer</i></h2>

<p>My dear Van L&mdash;&mdash;, you have suffered from an affection
similar to that which I have just described. You twice complained of a
return of it.</p>

<p>Who, under God, cured you? Your humble servant, Martin Hesselius.
Let me rather adopt the more emphasised piety of a certain good old
French surgeon of three hundred years ago: "I treated, and God cured
you."</p>

<p>Come, my friend, you are not to be hippish. Let me tell you a
fact.</p>

<p>I have met with, and treated, as my book shows, fifty-seven cases of
this kind of vision, which I term indifferently "sublimated,"
"precocious," and "interior."</p>

<p>There is another class of affections which are truly
termed&mdash;though commonly confounded with those which I
describe&mdash;spectral illusions. These latter I look upon as being no
less simply curable than a cold in the head or a trifling
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>It is those which rank in the first category that test our
promptitude of thought. Fifty-seven such cases have I encountered,
neither more nor less. And in how many of these have I failed? In no
one single instance.</p>

<p>There is no one affliction of mortality more easily and certainly
reducible, with a little patience, and a rational confidence in the
physician. With these simple conditions, I look upon the cure as
absolutely certain.</p>

<p>You are to remember that I had not even commenced to treat Mr.
Jennings' case. I have not any doubt that I should have cured him
perfectly in eighteen months, or possibly it might have extended to two
years. Some cases are very rapidly curable, others extremely tedious.
Every intelligent physician who will give thought and diligence to the
task, will effect a cure.</p>

<p>You know my tract on "The Cardinal Functions of the Brain." I there,
by the evidence of innumerable facts, prove, as I think, the high
probability of a circulation arterial and venous in its mechanism,
through the nerves. Of this system, thus considered, the brain is the
heart. The fluid, which is propagated hence through one class of
nerves, returns in an altered state through another, and the nature of
that fluid is spiritual, though not immaterial, any more than, as I
before remarked, light or electricity are so.</p>

<p>By various abuses, among which the habitual use of such agents as
green tea is one, this fluid may be affected as to its quality, but it
is more frequently disturbed as to equilibrium. This fluid being that
which we have in common with spirits, a congestion found upon the
masses of brain or nerve, connected with the interior sense, forms a
surface unduly exposed, on which disembodied spirits may operate:
communication is thus more or less effectually established. Between
this brain circulation and the heart circulation there is an intimate
sympathy. The seat, or rather the instrument of exterior vision, is the
eye. The seat of interior vision is the nervous tissue and brain,
immediately about and above the eyebrow. You remember how effectually I
dissipated your pictures by the simple application of iced
eau-de-cologne. Few cases, however, can be treated exactly alike with
anything like rapid success. Cold acts powerfully as a repellant of the
nervous fluid. Long enough continued it will even produce that
permanent insensibility which we call numbness, and a little longer,
muscular as well as sensational paralysis.</p>

<p>I have not, I repeat, the slightest doubt that I should have first
dimmed and ultimately sealed that inner eye which Mr. Jennings had
inadvertently opened. The same senses are opened in delirium tremens,
and entirely shut up again when the overaction of the cerebral heart,
and the prodigious nervous congestions that attend it, are terminated
by a decided change in the state of the body. It is by acting steadily
upon the body, by a simple process, that this result is
produced&mdash;and inevitably produced&mdash;I have never yet
failed.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Jennings made away with himself. But that catastrophe was
the result of a totally different malady, which, as it were, projected
itself upon the disease which was established. His case was in the
distinctive manner a complication, and the complaint under which he
really succumbed, was hereditary suicidal mania. Poor Mr. Jennings I
cannot call a patient of mine, for I had not even begun to treat his
case, and he had not yet given me, I am convinced, his full and
unreserved confidence. If the patient do not array himself on the side
of the disease, his cure is certain.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="s2"></a>

<h1>THE FAMILIAR</h1>

<h2><a name="c2-p"></a>Prologue</h2>

<p>Out of about two hundred and thirty cases, more or less nearly akin
to that I have entitled "Green Tea," I select the following, which I
call "The Familiar."</p>

<p>To this MS. Doctor Hesselius, has, after his wont, attached some
sheets of letter-paper, on which are written, in his hand nearly as
compact as print, his own remarks upon the case. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>"In point of conscience, no more unexceptionable narrator, than the
venerable Irish Clergyman who has given me this paper, on Mr. Barton's
case, could have been chosen. The statement is, however, medically
imperfect. The report of an intelligent physician, who had marked its
progress, and attended the patient, from its earlier stages to its
close, would have supplied what is wanting to enable me to pronounce
with confidence. I should have been acquainted with Mr. Barton's
probable hereditary pre-dispositions; I should have known, possibly, by
very early indications, something of a remoter origin of the disease
than can now be ascertained.</p>

<p>"In a rough way, we may reduce all similar cases to three distinct
classes. They are founded on the primary distinction between the
subjective and the objective. Of those whose senses are alleged to be
subject to supernatural impressions&mdash;some are simply visionaries,
and propagate the illusions of which they complain, from diseased brain
or nerves. Others are, unquestionably, infested by, as we term them,
spiritual agencies, exterior to themselves. Others, again, owe their
sufferings to a mixed condition. The interior sense, it is true, is
opened; but it has been and continues open by the action of disease.
This form of disease may, in one sense, be compared to the loss of the
scarf-skin, and a consequent exposure of surfaces for whose excessive
sensitiveness, nature has provided a muffling. The loss of this
covering is attended by an habitual impassability, by influences
against which we were intended to be guarded. But in the case of the
brain, and the nerves immediately connected with its functions and its
sensuous impressions, the cerebral circulation undergoes periodically
that vibratory disturbance, which, I believe, I have satisfactorily
examined and demonstrated, in my MS. Essay, A. 17. This vibratory
disturbance differs, as I there prove, essentially from the congestive
disturbance, the phenomena of which are examined in A. 19. It is, when
excessive, invariably accompanied by illusions.</p>

<p>"Had I seen Mr. Barton, and examined him upon the points, in his
case, which need elucidation, I should have without difficulty referred
those phenomena to their proper disease. My diagnosis is now,
necessarily, conjectural."</p>

<p>Thus writes Doctor Hesselius; and adds a great deal which is of
interest only to a scientific physician.</p>

<p>The Narrative of the Rev. Thomas Herbert, which furnishes all that
is known of the case, will be found in the chapters that follow.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-1"></a>Chapter I - Foot-steps</h2>

<p>I was a young man at the time, and intimately acquainted with some
of the actors in this strange tale; the impression which its incidents
made on me, therefore, were deep, and lasting. I shall now endeavour,
with precision, to relate them all, combining, of course, in the
narrative, whatever I have learned from various sources, tending,
however imperfectly, to illuminate the darkness which involves its
progress and termination.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1794, the younger brother of a certain
baronet, whom I shall call Sir James Barton, returned to Dublin. He had
served in the navy with some distinction, having commanded one of His
Majesty's frigates during the greater part of the American war. Captain
Barton was apparently some two- or three-and-forty years of age. He was
an intelligent and agreeable companion when he pleased it, though
generally reserved, and occasionally even moody.</p>

<p>In society, however, he deported himself as a man of the world, and
a gentleman. He had not contracted any of the noisy brusqueness
sometimes acquired at sea; on the contrary, his manners were remarkably
easy, quiet, and even polished. He was in person about the middle size,
and somewhat strongly formed&mdash;his countenance was marked with the
lines of thought, and on the whole wore an expression of gravity and
melancholy; being, however, as I have said, a man of perfect breeding,
as well as of good family, and in affluent circumstances, he had, of
course, ready access to the best society of Dublin, without the
necessity of any other credentials.</p>

<p>In his personal habits Mr. Barton was unexpensive. He occupied
lodgings in one of the then fashionable streets in the south side of
the town&mdash;kept but one horse and one servant&mdash;and though a
reputed free-thinker, yet lived an orderly and moral
life&mdash;indulging neither in gaming, drinking, nor any other vicious
pursuit&mdash;living very much to himself, without forming intimacies,
or choosing any companions, and appearing to mix in gay society rather
for the sake of its bustle and distraction, than for any opportunities
it offered of interchanging thought or feeling with its votaries.</p>

<p>Barton was therefore pronounced a saving, prudent, unsocial sort of
fellow, who bid fair to maintain his celibacy alike against stratagem
and assault, and was likely to live to a good old age, die rich, and
leave his money to a hospital.</p>

<p>It was now apparent, however, that the nature of Mr. Barton's plans
had been totally misconceived. A young lady, whom I shall call Miss
Montague, was at this time introduced into the gay world, by her aunt,
the Dowager Lady L&mdash;. Miss Montague was decidedly pretty and
accomplished, and having some natural cleverness, and a great deal of
gaiety, became for a while a reigning toast.</p>

<p>Her popularity, however, gained her, for a time, nothing more than
that unsubstantial admiration which, however, pleasant as an incense to
vanity, is by no means necessarily antecedent to matrimony&mdash;for,
unhappily for the young lady in question, it was an understood thing,
that beyond her personal attractions, she had no kind of earthly
provision. Such being the state of affairs, it will readily be believed
that no little surprise was consequent upon the appearance of Captain
Barton as the avowed lover of the penniless Miss Montague.</p>

<p>His suit prospered, as might have been expected, and in a short time
it was communicated by old Lady L&mdash; to each of her
hundred-and-fifty particular friends in succession, that Captain Barton
had actually tendered proposals of marriage, with her approbation, to
her niece, Miss Montague, who had, moreover, accepted the offer of his
hand, conditionally upon the consent of her father, who was then upon
his homeward voyage from India, and expected in two or three weeks at
the furthest.</p>

<p>About this consent there could be no doubt&mdash;the delay,
therefore, was one merely of form&mdash;they were looked upon as
absolutely engaged, and Lady L&mdash;, with a rigour of old-fashioned
decorum with which her niece would, no doubt, gladly have dispensed,
withdrew her thenceforward from all further participation in the
gaieties of the town.</p>

<p>Captain Barton was a constant visitor, as well as a frequent guest
at the house, and was permitted all the privileges of intimacy which a
betrothed suitor is usually accorded. Such was the relation of parties,
when the mysterious circumstances which darken this narrative first
began to unfold themselves.</p>

<p>Lady L&mdash; resided in a handsome mansion at the north side of
Dublin, and Captain Barton's lodgings, as we have already said, were
situated at the south. The distance intervening was considerable, and
it was Captain Barton's habit generally to walk home without an
attendant, as often as he passed the evening with the old lady and her
fair charge.</p>

<p>His shortest way in such nocturnal walks, lay, for a considerable
space, through a line of street which had as yet merely been laid out,
and little more than the foundations of the houses constructed.</p>

<p>One night, shortly after his engagement with Miss Montague had
commenced, he happened to remain unusually late, in company with her
and Lady L&mdash;. The conversation had turned upon the evidences of
revelation, which he had disputed with the callous scepticism of a
confirmed infidel. What were called "French principles," had in those
days found their way a good deal into fashionable society, especially
that portion of it which professed allegiance to Whiggism, and neither
the old lady nor her charge was so perfectly free from the taint, as
to look upon Mr. Barton's views as any serious objection to the
proposed union.</p>

<p>The discussion had degenerated into one upon the supernatural and
the marvellous, in which he had pursued precisely the same line of
argument and ridicule. In all this, it is but truth to state, Captain
Barton was guilty of no affectation&mdash;the doctrines upon which he
insisted, were, in reality, but too truly the basis of his own fixed
belief, if so it might be called; and perhaps not the least strange of
the many strange circumstances connected with my narrative, was the
fact that the subject of the fearful influences I am about to describe
was himself, from the deliberate conviction of years, an utter
disbeliever in what are usually termed preternatural agencies.</p>

<p>It was considerably past midnight when Mr. Barton took his leave,
and set out upon his solitary walk homeward. He had now reached the
lonely road, with its unfinished dwarf walls tracing the foundations of
the projected row of houses on either side&mdash;the moon was shining
mistily, and its imperfect light made the road he trod but additionally
dreary&mdash;that utter silence which has in it something indefinably
exciting, reigned there, and made the sound of his steps, which alone
broke it, unnaturally loud and distinct.</p>

<p>He had proceeded thus some way, when he, on a sudden, heard other
footfalls, pattering at a measured pace, and, as it seemed, about two
score steps behind him.</p>

<p>The suspicion of being dogged is at all times unpleasant; it is,
however, especially so in a spot so lonely; and this suspicion became
so strong in the mind of Captain Barton, that he abruptly turned about
to confront his pursuer; but, though there was quite sufficient
moonlight to disclose any object upon the road he had traversed, no
form of any kind was visible there.</p>

<p>The steps he had heard could not have been the reverberation of his
own, for he stamped his foot upon the ground, and walked briskly up and
down, in the vain attempt to awake an echo; though by no means a
fanciful person, therefore he was at last fain to charge the sounds
upon his imagination, and treat them as an illusion. Thus satisfying
himself, he resumed his walk, and before he had proceeded a dozen
paces, the mysterious footfall was again audible from behind, and this
time, as if with the special design of showing that the sounds were not
the responses of an echo&mdash;the steps sometimes slackened nearly to
a halt, and sometimes hurried for six or eight strides to a run, and
again abated to a walk.</p>

<p>Captain Barton, as before, turned suddenly round, and with the same
result&mdash;no object was visible above the deserted level of the
road. He walked back over the same ground, determined that, whatever
might have been the cause of the sounds which had so disconcerted him,
it should not escape his search&mdash;the endeavour, however, was
unrewarded.</p>

<p>In spite of all his scepticism, he felt something like a
superstitious fear stealing fast upon him, and with these unwonted and
uncomfortable sensations, he once more turned and pursued his way.
There was no repetition of these haunting sounds, until he had reached
the point where he had last stopped to retrace his steps&mdash;here
they were resumed&mdash;and with sudden starts of running, which
threatened to bring the unseen pursuer up to the alarmed
pedestrian.</p>

<p>Captain Barton arrested his course as formerly&mdash;the
unaccountable nature of the occurrence filled him with vague and
disagreeable sensations&mdash;and yielding to the excitement that was
gaining upon him, he shouted sternly, "Who goes there?" The sound of
one's own voice, thus exerted, in utter solitude, and followed by total
silence, has in it something unpleasantly dismaying, and he felt a
degree of nervousness which, perhaps, from no cause had he ever known
before.</p>

<p>To the very end of this solitary street the steps pursued
him&mdash;and it required a strong effort of stubborn pride on his
part, to resist the impulse that prompted him every moment to run for
safety at the top of his speed. It was not until he had reached his
lodging, and sat by his own fire-side, that he felt sufficiently
reassured to rearrange and reconsider in his own mind the occurrences
which had so discomposed him. So little a matter, after all, is
sufficient to upset the pride of scepticism and vindicate the old
simple laws of nature within us.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-2"></a>Chapter II - The Watcher</h2>

<p>Mr. Barton was next morning sitting at a late breakfast, reflecting
upon the incidents of the previous night, with more of inquisitiveness
than awe, so speedily do gloomy impressions upon the fancy disappear
under the cheerful influence of day, when a letter just delivered by
the postman was placed upon the table before him.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable in the address of this missive, except
that it was written in a hand which he did not know&mdash;perhaps it
was disguised&mdash;for the tall narrow characters were sloped
backward; and with the self-inflicted suspense which we often see
practised in such cases, he puzzled over the inscription for a full
minute before he broke the seal. When he did so, he read the following
words, written in the same hand:</p>

<p>"Mr. Barton, late captain of the Dolphin, is warned of DANGER. He
will do wisely to avoid &mdash;&mdash; street&mdash;[here the locality
of his last night's adventure was named]&mdash;if he walks there as
usual he will meet with something unlucky&mdash;let him take warning,
once for all, for he has reason to dread THE WATCHER."</p>

<p>Captain Barton read and re-read this strange effusion; in every
light and in every direction he turned it over and over; he examined
the paper on which it was written, and scrutinized the hand-writing
once more. Defeated here, he turned to the seal; it was nothing but a
patch of wax, upon which the accidental impression of a thumb was
imperfectly visible.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest mark, or clue of any kind, to lead him
to even a guess as to its possible origin. The writer's object seemed a
friendly one, and yet he subscribed himself as one whom he had "reason
to dread." Altogether the letter, its author, and its real purpose were
to him an inexplicable puzzle, and one, moreover, unpleasantly
suggestive, in his mind, of other associations connected with his last
night's adventure.</p>

<p>In obedience to some feeling&mdash;perhaps of pride&mdash;Mr. Barton
did not communicate, even to his intended bride, the occurrences which
I have just detailed. Trifling as they might appear, they had in
reality most disagreeably affected his imagination, and he cared not to
disclose, even to the young lady in question, what she might possibly
look upon as evidences of weakness. The letter might very well be but a
hoax, and the mysterious footfall but a delusion or a trick. But
although he affected to treat the whole affair as unworthy of a thought
it yet haunted him pertinaciously, tormenting him with perplexing
doubts, and depressing him with undefined apprehensions. Certain it is,
that for a considerable time afterwards he carefully avoided the street
indicated in the letter as the scene of danger.</p>

<p>It was not until about a week after the receipt of the letter which
I have transcribed, that anything further occurred to remind Captain
Barton of its contents, or to counteract the gradual disappearance from
his mind of the disagreeable impressions then received.</p>

<p>He was returning one night, after the interval I have stated, from
the theatre, which was then situated in Crow Street, and having there
seen Miss Montague and Lady L&mdash; into their carriage, he loitered
for some time with two or three acquaintances.</p>

<p>With these, however, he parted close to the college, and pursued his
way alone. It was now fully one o'clock, and the streets were quite
deserted. During the whole of his walk with the companions from whom he
had just parted, he had been at times painfully aware of the sound of
steps, as it seemed, dogging them on their way.</p>

<p>Once or twice he had looked back, in the uneasy anticipation that he
was again about to experience the same mysterious annoyances which had
so disconcerted him a week before, and earnestly hoping that he might
see some form to account naturally for the sounds. But the street was
deserted&mdash;no one was visible.</p>

<p>Proceeding now quite alone upon his homeward way, he grew really
nervous and uncomfortable, as he became sensible, with increased
distinctness, of the well-known and now absolutely dreaded sounds.</p>

<p>By the side of the dead wall which bounded the college park, the
sounds followed, recommencing almost simultaneously with his own steps.
The same unequal pace&mdash;sometimes slow, sometimes for a score yards
or so, quickened almost to a run&mdash;was audible from behind him.
Again and again he turned; quickly and stealthily he glanced over his
shoulder&mdash;almost at every half-dozen steps; but no one was
visible.</p>

<p>The irritation of this intangible and unseen pursuit became
gradually all but intolerable; and when at last he reached his home,
his nerves were strung to such a pitch of excitement that he could not
rest, and did not attempt even to lie down until after the daylight had
broken.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a knock at his chamber-door, and his servant
entering, handed him several letters which had just been received by
the penny post. One among them instantly arrested his attention&mdash;a
single glance at the direction aroused him thoroughly. He at once
recognised its character, and read as follows:</p>

<p>"You may as well think, Captain Barton, to escape from your own
shadow as from me; do what you may, I will see you as often as I
please, and you shall see me, for I do not want to hide myself, as you
fancy. Do not let it trouble your rest, Captain Barton; for, with a
good conscience, what need you fear from the eye of THE WATCHER."</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to dwell upon the feelings that accompanied
a perusal of this strange communication. Captain Barton was observed to
be unusually absent and out of spirits for several days afterwards, but
no one divined the cause.</p>

<p>Whatever he might think as to the phantom steps which followed him,
there could be no possible illusion about the letters he had received;
and, to say the least, their immediate sequence upon the mysterious
sounds which had haunted him, was an odd coincidence.</p>

<p>The whole circumstance was, in his own mind, vaguely and
instinctively connected with certain passages in his past life, which,
of all others, he hated to remember.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that in addition to his own approaching
nuptials, Captain Barton had just then&mdash;fortunately, perhaps, for
himself&mdash;some business of an engrossing kind connected with the
adjustment of a large and long-litigated claim upon certain
properties.</p>

<p>The hurry and excitement of business had its natural effect in
gradually dispelling the gloom which had for a time occasionally
oppressed him, and in a little while his spirits had entirely recovered
their accustomed tone.</p>

<p>During all this time, however, he was, now and then, dismayed by
indistinct and half-hearted repetitions of the same annoyance, and that
in lonely places, in the day-time as well as after nightfall. These
renewals of the strange impressions from which he had suffered so much,
were, however, desultory and faint, insomuch that often he really could
not, to his own satisfaction, distinguish between them and the mere
suggestions of an excited imagination.</p>

<p>One evening he walked down to the House of Commons with a Member, an
acquaintance of his and mine. This was one of the few occasions upon
which I have been in company with Captain Barton. As we walked down
together, I observed that he became absent and silent, and to a degree
that seemed to argue the pressure of some urgent and absorbing
anxiety.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that during the whole of our walk, he had heard
the well-known footsteps tracking him as we proceeded.</p>

<p>This, however, was the last time he suffered from this phase of the
persecution, of which he was already the anxious victim. A new and a
very different one was about to be presented.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-3"></a>Chapter III - An Advertisement</h2>

<p>Of the new series of impressions which were afterwards gradually to
work out his destiny, I that evening witnessed the first; and but for
its relation to the train of events which followed, the incident would
scarcely have been now remembered by me.</p>

<p>As we were walking in at the passage from College Green, a man, of
whom I remember only that he was short in stature, looked like a
foreigner, and wore a kind of fur travelling-cap, walked very rapidly,
and as if under fierce excitement, directly towards us, muttering to
himself, fast and vehemently the while.</p>

<p>This odd-looking person walked straight towards Barton, who was
foremost of the three, and halted, regarding him for a moment or two
with a look of maniacal menace and fury; and then turning about as
abruptly, he walked before us at the same agitated pace, and
disappeared at a side passage. I do distinctly remember being a good
deal shocked at the countenance and bearing of this man, which indeed
irresistibly impressed me with an undefined sense of danger, such as I
have never felt before or since from the presence of anything human;
but these sensations were, on my part, far from amounting to anything
so disconcerting as to flurry or excite me&mdash;I had seen only a
singularly evil countenance, agitated, as it seemed, with the
excitement of madness.</p>

<p>I was absolutely astonished, however, at the effect of this
apparition upon Captain Barton. I knew him to be a man of proud courage
and coolness in real danger&mdash;a circumstance which made his conduct
upon this occasion the more conspicuously odd. He recoiled a step or
two as the stranger advanced, and clutched my arm in silence, with what
seemed to be a spasm of agony or terror! and then, as the figure
disappeared, shoving me roughly back, he followed it for a few paces,
stopped in great disorder, and sat down upon a form. I never beheld a
countenance more ghastly and haggard.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Barton, what is the matter?" said &mdash;&mdash;,
our companion, really alarmed at his appearance. "You're not hurt, are
you?&mdash;or unwell? What is it?</p>

<p>"What did he say?&mdash;I did not hear it&mdash;what was it?" asked
Barton, wholly disregarding the question.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said &mdash;&mdash;, greatly surprised; "who cares what
the fellow said. You are unwell, Barton&mdash;decidedly unwell; let me
call a coach."</p>

<p>"Unwell! No&mdash;not unwell," he said, evidently making an effort
to recover his self-possession; "but, to say the truth, I am
fatigued&mdash;a little over-worked&mdash;and perhaps over anxious. You
know I have been in chancery, and the winding up of a suit is always a
nervous affair. I have felt uncomfortable all this evening; but I am
better now. Come, come&mdash;shall we go on?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Take my advice, Barton, and go home; you really do need
rest! you are looking quite ill. I really do insist on your allowing me
to see you home," replied his friend.</p>

<p>I seconded &mdash;&mdash;'s advice, the more readily as it was
obvious that Barton was not himself disinclined to be persuaded. He
left us, declining our offered escort. I was not sufficiently intimate
with &mdash;&mdash; to discuss the scene we had both just witnessed. I
was, however, convinced from his manner in the few common-place
comments and regrets we exchanged, that he was just as little satisfied
as I with the extempore plea of illness with which he had accounted for
the strange exhibition, and that we were both agreed in suspecting some
lurking mystery in the matter.</p>

<p>I called next day at Barton's lodgings, to enquire for him, and
learned from the servant that he had not left his room since his return
the night before; but that he was not seriously indisposed, and hoped
to be out in a few days. That evening he sent for Dr. R&mdash;, then in
large and fashionable practice in Dublin, and their interview was, it
is said, an odd one.</p>

<p>He entered into a detail of his own symptoms in an abstracted and
desultory way, which seemed to argue a strange want of interest in his
own cure, and, at all events, made it manifest that there was some
topic engaging his mind of more engrossing importance than his present
ailment. He complained of occasional palpitations and headache.</p>

<p>Doctor R&mdash; asked him among other questions whether there was
any irritating circumstance or anxiety then occupying his thoughts.
This he denied quickly and almost peevishly; and the physician
thereupon declared his opinion, that there was nothing amiss except
some slight derangement of the digestion, for which he accordingly
wrote a prescription, and was about to withdraw, when Mr. Barton, with
the air of a man who recollects a topic which had nearly escaped him,
recalled him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Doctor, but I really almost forgot; will you
permit me to ask you two or three medical questions&mdash;rather odd
ones, perhaps, but as a wager depends upon their solutions you will, I
hope, excuse my unreasonableness."</p>

<p>The physician readily undertook to satisfy the inquirer.</p>

<p>Barton seemed to have some difficulty about opening the proposed
interrogatories, for he was silent for a minute, then walked to his
book-case, and returned as he had gone; at last he sat down, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll think them very childish questions, but I can't recover my
wager without a decision; so I must put them. I want to know first
about lock-jaw. If a man actually has had that complaint, and appears
to have died of it&mdash;so much so, that a physician of average skill
pronounces him actually dead&mdash;may he, after all, recover?"</p>

<p>The physician smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but a blunder may be made," resumed Barton. "Suppose an
ignorant pretender to medical skill; may he be so deceived by any stage
of the complaint, as to mistake what is only a part of the progress of
the disease, for death itself?"</p>

<p>"No one who had ever seen death," answered he, "could mistake it in
a case of lock-jaw."</p>

<p>Barton mused for a few minutes. "I am going to ask you a question,
perhaps, still more childish; but first, tell me, are the regulations
of foreign hospitals, such as that of, let us say, Naples, very lax and
bungling. May not all kinds of blunders and slips occur in their
entries of names, and so forth?"</p>

<p>Doctor R&mdash; professed his incompetence to answer that query.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Doctor, here is the last of my questions. You will,
probably, laugh at it; but it must out, nevertheless. Is there any
disease, in all the range of human maladies, which would have the
effect of perceptibly contracting the stature, and the whole
frame&mdash;causing the man to shrink in all his proportions, and yet
to preserve his exact resemblance to himself in every
particular&mdash;with the one exception, his height and bulk; any
disease, mark&mdash;no matter how rare&mdash;how little believed in,
generally&mdash;which could possibly result in producing such an
effect?"</p>

<p>The physician replied with a smile, and a very decided negative.</p>

<p>"Tell me, then," said Barton, abruptly, "if a man be in reasonable
fear of assault from a lunatic who is at large, can he not procure a
warrant for his arrest and detention?"</p>

<p>"Really that is more a lawyer's question than one in my way,"
replied Dr. R&mdash;, "but I believe, on applying to a magistrate, such
a course would be directed."</p>

<p>The physician then took his leave; but, just as he reached the
hall-door, remembered that he had left his cane upstairs, and returned.
His reappearance was awkward, for a piece of paper, which he recognised
as his own prescription, was slowly burning upon the fire, and Barton
sitting close by with an expression of settled gloom and dismay.</p>

<p>Doctor R&mdash; had too much tact to observe what presented itself;
but he had seen quite enough to assure him that the mind, and not the
body, of Captain Barton was in reality the seat of suffering.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, the following advertisement appeared in the
Dublin newspapers.</p>

<p>"If Sylvester Yelland, formerly a foremastman on board His Majesty's
frigate Dolphin, or his nearest of kin, will apply to Mr. Hubert Smith,
attorney, at his office, Dame Street, he or they may hear of something
greatly to his or their advantage. Admission may be had at any hour up
to twelve o'clock at night, should parties desire to avoid observation;
and the strictest secrecy, as to all communications intended to be
confidential, shall be honourably observed."</p>

<p>The Dolphin, as I have mentioned, was the vessel which Captain
Barton had commanded; and this circumstance, connected with the
extraordinary exertions made by the circulation of handbills, &amp;c.,
as well as by repeated advertisements, to secure for this strange
notice the utmost possible publicity, suggested to Dr. R&mdash; the
idea that Captain Barton's extreme uneasiness was somehow connected
with the individual to whom the advertisement was addressed, and he
himself the author of it.</p>

<p>This, however, it is needless to add, was no more than a conjecture.
No information whatsoever, as to the real purpose of the advertisement
was divulged by the agent, nor yet any hint as to who his employer
might be.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-4"></a>Chapter IV - He Talks With a Clergyman</h2>

<p>Mr. Barton, although he had latterly begun to earn for himself the
character of an hypochondriac, was yet very far from deserving it.
Though by no means lively, he had yet, naturally, what are termed "even
spirits," and was not subject to undue depressions.</p>

<p>He soon, therefore, began to return to his former habits; and one of
the earliest symptoms of this healthier tone of spirits was, his
appearing at a grand dinner of the Freemasons, of which worthy
fraternity he was himself a brother. Barton, who had been at first
gloomy and abstracted, drank much more freely than was his
wont&mdash;possibly with the purpose of dispelling his own secret
anxieties&mdash;and under the influence of good wine, and pleasant
company, became gradually (unlike himself) talkative, and even
noisy.</p>

<p>It was under this unwonted excitement that he left his company at
about half-past ten o'clock; and, as conviviality is a strong incentive
to gallantry, it occurred to him to proceed forthwith to Lady
L&mdash;'s and pass the remainder of the evening with her and his
destined bride.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he was soon at &mdash;&mdash; street, and chatting
gaily with the ladies. It is not to be supposed that Captain Barton had
exceeded the limits which propriety prescribes to good
fellowship&mdash;he had merely taken enough wine to raise his spirits,
without, however, in the least degree unsteadying his mind, or
affecting his manners.</p>

<p>With this undue elevation of spirits had supervened an entire
oblivion or contempt of those undefined apprehensions which had for so
long weighed upon his mind, and to a certain extent estranged him from
society; but as the night wore away, and his artificial gaiety began to
flag, these painful feelings gradually intruded themselves again, and
he grew abstracted and anxious as heretofore.</p>

<p>He took his leave at length, with an unpleasant foreboding of some
coming mischief, and with a mind haunted with a thousand mysterious
apprehensions, such as, even while he acutely felt their pressure, he,
nevertheless, inwardly strove, or affected to contemn.</p>

<p>It was this proud defiance of what he regarded as his own weakness,
which prompted him upon the present occasion to that course which
brought about the adventure I am now about to relate.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton might have easily called a coach, but he was conscious
that his strong inclination to do so proceeded from no cause other than
what he desperately persisted in representing to himself to be his own
superstitious tremors.</p>

<p>He might also have returned home by a route different from that
against which he had been warned by his mysterious correspondent; but
for the same reason he dismissed this idea also, and with a dogged and
half desperate resolution to force matters to a crisis of some kind, if
there were any reality in the causes of his former suffering, and if
not, satisfactorily to bring their delusiveness to the proof, he
determined to follow precisely the course which he had trodden upon the
night so painfully memorable in his own mind as that on which his
strange persecution commenced. Though, sooth to say, the pilot who for
the first time steers his vessel under the muzzles of a hostile
battery, never felt his resolution more severely tasked than did
Captain Barton as he breathlessly pursued this solitary path&mdash;a
path which, spite of every effort of scepticism and reason, he felt to
be infested by some (as respected him) malignant being.</p>

<p>He pursued his way steadily and rapidly, scarcely breathing from
intensity of suspense; he, however, was troubled by no renewal of the
dreaded footsteps, and was beginning to feel a return of confidence, as
more than three-fourths of the way being accomplished with impunity, he
approached the long line of twinkling oil lamps which indicated the
frequented streets.</p>

<p>This feeling of self-congratulation was, however, but momentary. The
report of a musket at some hundred yards behind him, and the whistle of
a bullet close to his head, disagreeably and startlingly dispelled it.
His first impulse was to retrace his steps in pursuit of the assassin;
but the road on either side was, as we have said, embarrassed by the
foundations of a street, beyond which extended waste fields, full of
rubbish and neglected lime and brick-kilns, and all now as utterly
silent as though no sound had ever disturbed their dark and unsightly
solitude. The futility of, single-handed, attempting, under such
circumstances, a search for the murderer, was apparent, especially as
no sound, either of retreating steps or any other kind, was audible to
direct his pursuit.</p>

<p>With the tumultuous sensations of one whose life has just been
exposed to a murderous attempt, and whose escape has been the narrowest
possible, Captain Barton turned again; and without, however, quickening
his pace actually to a run, hurriedly pursued his way.</p>

<p>He had turned, as I have said, after a pause of a few seconds, and
had just commenced his rapid retreat, when on a sudden he met the
well-remembered little man in the fur cap. The encounter was but
momentary. The figure was walking at the same exaggerated pace, and
with the same strange air of menace as before; and as it passed him, he
thought he heard it say, in a furious whisper, "Still alive&mdash;still
alive!"</p>

<p>The state of Mr. Barton's spirits began now to work a corresponding
alteration in his health and looks, and to such a degree that it was
impossible that the change should escape general remark.</p>

<p>For some reasons, known but to himself, he took no step whatsoever
to bring the attempt upon his life, which he had so narrowly escaped,
under the notice of the authorities; on the contrary, he kept it
jealously to himself; and it was not for many weeks after the
occurrence that he mentioned it, and then in strict confidence, to a
gentleman, whom the torments of his mind at last compelled him to
consult.</p>

<p>Spite of his blue devils, however, poor Barton, having no
satisfactory reason to render to the public for any undue remissness in
the attentions exacted by the relation subsisting between him and Miss
Montague was obliged to exert himself, and present to the world a
confident and cheerful bearing.</p>

<p>The true source of his sufferings, and every circumstance connected
with them, he guarded with a reserve so jealous, that it seemed
dictated by at least a suspicion that the origin of his strange
persecution was known to himself, and that it was of a nature which,
upon his own account, he could not or dared not disclose.</p>

<p>The mind thus turned in upon itself, and constantly occupied with a
haunting anxiety which it dared not reveal or confide to any human
breast, became daily more excited, and, of course, more vividly
impressible, by a system of attack which operated through the nervous
system; and in this state he was destined to sustain, with increasing
frequency, the stealthy visitations of that apparition which from the
first had seemed to possess so terrible a hold upon his
imagination.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>It was about this time that Captain Barton called upon the then
celebrated preacher, Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, with whom he had a slight
acquaintance, and an extraordinary conversation ensued.</p>

<p>The divine was seated in his chambers in college, surrounded with
works upon his favourite pursuit, and deep in theology, when Barton was
announced.</p>

<p>There was something at once embarrassed and excited in his manner,
which, along with his wan and haggard countenance, impressed the
student with the unpleasant consciousness that his visitor must have
recently suffered terribly indeed, to account for an alteration so
striking&mdash;almost shocking.</p>

<p>After the usual interchange of polite greeting, and a few
commonplace remarks, Captain Barton, who obviously perceived the
surprise which his visit had excited, and which Doctor &mdash;&mdash;
was unable wholly to conceal, interrupted a brief pause by
remarking&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a strange call, Doctor &mdash;&mdash;, perhaps scarcely
warranted by an acquaintance so slight as mine with you. I should not
under ordinary circumstances have ventured to disturb you; but my visit
is neither an idle nor impertinent intrusion. I am sure you will not so
account it, when I tell you how afflicted I am."</p>

<p>Doctor &mdash;&mdash; interrupted him with assurances such as good
breeding suggested, and Barton resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am come to task your patience by asking your advice. When I say
your patience, I might, indeed, say more; I might have said your
humanity&mdash;your compassion; for I have been and am a great
sufferer."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," replied the churchman, "it will, indeed, afford me
infinite gratification if I can give you comfort in any distress of
mind; but&mdash;you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you would say," resumed Barton, quickly; "I am an
unbeliever, and, therefore, incapable of deriving help from religion;
but don't take that for granted. At least you must not assume that,
however unsettled my convictions may be, I do not feel a deep&mdash;a
very deep&mdash; interest in the subject. Circumstances have lately
forced it upon my attention, in such a way as to compel me to review
the whole question in a more candid and teachable spirit, I believe,
than I ever studied it in before."</p>

<p>"Your difficulties, I take it for granted, refer to the evidences of
revelation," suggested the clergyman.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no--not altogether; in fact I am ashamed to say I have not
considered even my objections sufficiently to state them connectedly;
but&mdash;but there is one subject on which I feel a peculiar
interest."</p>

<p>He paused again, and Doctor pressed him to proceed.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Barton, "whatever may be my uncertainty as to
the authenticity of what we are taught to call revelation, of one fact
I am deeply and horribly convinced, that there does exist beyond this a
spiritual world&mdash;a system whose workings are generally in mercy
hidden from us&mdash;a system which may be, and which is sometimes,
partially and terribly revealed. I am sure&mdash;I know," continued
Barton, with increasing excitement, "that there is a God&mdash;a
dreadful God&mdash;and that retribution follows guilt, in ways the most
mysterious and stupendous&mdash;by agencies the most inexplicable and
terrific;&mdash;there is a spiritual system&mdash;great God, how I have
been convinced!&mdash;a system malignant, and implacable, and
omnipotent, under whose persecutions I am, and have been, suffering the
torments of the damned!&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;yes&mdash;the fires and
frenzy of hell!"</p>

<p>As Barton spoke, his agitation became so vehement that the Divine
was shocked, and even alarmed. The wild and excited rapidity with which
he spoke, and, above all, the indefinable horror, that stamped his
features, afforded a contrast to his ordinary cool and unimpassioned
self-possession striking and painful in the last degree.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-5"></a>Chapter V - Mr. Barton States His Case</h2>

<p>"My dear sir," said Doctor &mdash;&mdash;, after a brief pause, "I
fear you have been very unhappy, indeed; but I venture to predict that
the depression under which you labour will be found to originate in
purely physical causes, and that with a change of air, and the aid of a
few tonics, your spirits will return, and the tone of your mind be once
more cheerful and tranquil as heretofore. There was, after all, more
truth than we are quite willing to admit in the classic theories which
assigned the undue predominance of any one affection of the mind, to
the undue action or torpidity of one or other of our bodily organs.
Believe me, that a little attention to diet, exercise, and the other
essentials of health, under competent direction, will make you as much
yourself as you can wish."</p>

<p>"Doctor &mdash;&mdash;," said Barton, with something like a shudder,
"I cannot delude myself with such a hope. I have no hope to cling to
but one, and that is, that by some other spiritual agency more potent
than that which tortures me, it may be combated, and I delivered. If
this may not be, I am lost&mdash;now and for ever lost."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Barton, you must remember," urged his companion, "that
others have suffered as you have done, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," interrupted he, with irritability&mdash;"no, sir, I am
not a credulous&mdash;far from a superstitious man. I have been,
perhaps, too much the reverse&mdash;too sceptical, too slow of belief;
but unless I were one whom no amount of evidence could convince, unless
I were to contemn the repeated, the perpetual evidence of my own
senses, I am now&mdash;now at last constrained to believe&mdash;I have
no escape from the conviction&mdash;the overwhelming
certainty&mdash;that I am haunted and dogged, go where I may,
by&mdash;by a DEMON!"</p>

<p>There was a preternatural energy of horror in Barton's face, as,
with its damp and death-like lineaments turned towards his companion,
he thus delivered himself.</p>

<p>"God help you, my poor friend," said Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, much
shocked, "God help you; for, indeed, you are a sufferer, however your
sufferings may have been caused."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, God help me," echoed Barton, sternly; "but will he help
me&mdash;will he help me?"

<p>"Pray to him&mdash;pray in an humble and trusting spirit," said he.</p>

<p>"Pray, pray," echoed he again; "I can't pray&mdash;I could as easily
move a mountain by an effort of my will. I have not belief enough to
pray; there is something within me that will not pray. You prescribe
impossibilities&mdash;literal impossibilities."</p>

<p>"You will not find it so, if you will but try," said Doctor
&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Try! I have tried, and the attempt only fills me with confusion;
and, sometimes, terror; I have tried in vain, and more than in vain.
The awful, unutterable idea of eternity and infinity oppresses and
maddens my brain whenever my mind approaches the contemplation of the
Creator; I recoil from the effort scared. I tell you, Doctor
&mdash;&mdash;, if I am to be saved, it must be by other means. The
idea of an eternal Creator is to me intolerable&mdash;my mind cannot
support it."</p>

<p>"Say, then, my dear sir," urged he, "say how you would have me serve
you&mdash;what you would learn of me&mdash;what I can do or say to
relieve you?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me first," replied Captain Barton, with a subdued air,
and an effort to suppress his excitement, "listen to me while I detail
the circumstances of the persecution under which my life has become all
but intolerable&mdash;a persecution which has made me fear death and
the world beyond the grave as much as I have grown to hate
existence."</p>

<p>Barton then proceeded to relate the circumstances which I have
already detailed, and then continued:</p>

<p>"This has now become habitual&mdash;an accustomed thing. I do not
mean the actual seeing him in the flesh&mdash;thank God, that at least
is not permitted daily. Thank God, from the ineffable horrors of that
visitation I have been mercifully allowed intervals of repose, though
none of security; but from the consciousness that a malignant spirit is
following and watching me wherever I go, I have never, for a single
instant, a temporary respite. I am pursued with blasphemies, cries of
despair and appalling hatred. I hear those dreadful sounds called after
me as I turn the corners of the streets; they come in the night-time,
while I sit in my chamber alone; they haunt me everywhere, charging me
with hideous crimes, and&mdash;great God!&mdash;threatening me with
coming vengeance and eternal misery. Hush! do you hear that?" he cried
with a horrible smile of triumph; "there&mdash;there, will that
convince you?"</p>

<p>The clergyman felt a chill of horror steal over him, while, during
the wail of a sudden gust of wind, he heard, or fancied he heard, the
half articulate sounds of rage and derision mingling in the sough.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" at length Barton cried, drawing a
long breath through his teeth.</p>

<p>"I heard the wind," said Doctor &mdash;&mdash;. "What should I think
of it&mdash;what is there remarkable about it?"</p>

<p>"The prince of the powers of the air," muttered Barton, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! my dear sir," said the student, with an effort to
reassure himself; for though it was broad daylight, there was
nevertheless something disagreeably contagious in the nervous
excitement under which his visitor so miserably suffered. "You must not
give way to those wild fancies; you must resist these impulses of the
imagination."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; 'resist the devil and he will flee from thee,'" said
Barton, in the same tone; "but how resist him? ay, there it
is&mdash;there is the rub. What&mdash;what am I to do? what can I
do?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, this is fancy," said the man of folios; "you are your
own tormentor."</p>

<p>"No, no, sir&mdash;fancy has no part in it," answered Barton,
somewhat sternly. "Fancy! was it that made you, as well as me, hear,
but this moment, those accents of hell? Fancy, indeed! No, no."</p>

<p>"But you have seen this person frequently," said the ecclesiastic;
"why have you not accosted or secured him? Is it not a little
precipitate, to say no more, to assume, as you have done, the existence
of preternatural agency, when, after all, everything may be easily
accountable, if only proper means were taken to sift the matter."</p>

<p>"There are circumstances connected with this&mdash;this appearance,"
said Barton, "which it is needless to disclose, but which to me are
proof of its horrible nature. I know that the being that follows me is
not human&mdash;I say I know this; I could prove it to your own
conviction." He paused for a minute, and then added, "And as to
accosting it, I dare not, I could not; when I see it I am powerless; I
stand in the gaze of death, in the triumphant presence of infernal
power and malignity. My strength, and faculties, and memory, all
forsake me. O God, I fear, sir, you know not what you speak of. Mercy,
mercy; heaven have pity on me!"</p>

<p>He leaned his elbow on the table, and passed his hand across his
eyes, as if to exclude some image of horror, muttering the last words
of the sentence he had just concluded, again and again.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, abruptly raising himself, and looking full upon
the clergyman with an imploring eye, "I know you will do for me
whatever may be done. You know now fully the circumstances and the
nature of my affliction. I tell you I cannot help myself; I cannot hope
to escape; I am utterly passive. I conjure you, then, to weigh my case
well, and if anything may be done for me by vicarious
supplication&mdash;by the intercession of the good&mdash;or by any aid
or influence whatsoever, I implore of you, I adjure you in the name of
the Most High, give me the benefit of that influence&mdash;deliver me
from the body of this death. Strive for me, pity me; I know you will;
you cannot refuse this; it is the purpose and object of my visit. Send
me away with some hope, however little, some faint hope of ultimate
deliverance, and I will nerve myself to endure, from hour to hour, the
hideous dream into which my existence has been transformed."</p>

<p>Doctor &mdash;&mdash; assured him that all he could do was to pray
earnestly for him, and that so much he would not fail to do. They
parted with a hurried and melancholy valediction. Barton hastened to
the carriage that awaited him at the door, drew down the blinds, and
drove away, while Doctor &mdash;&mdash; returned to his chamber, to
ruminate at leisure upon the strange interview which had just
interrupted his studies.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-6"></a>Chapter VI - Seen Again</h2>

<p>It was not to be expected that Captain Barton's changed and
eccentric habits should long escape remark and discussion. Various were
the theories suggested to account for it. Some attributed the
alteration to the pressure of secret pecuniary embarrassments; others
to a repugnance to fulfil an engagement into which he was presumed to
have too precipitately entered; and others, again, to the supposed
incipiency of mental disease, which latter, indeed, was the most
plausible as well as the most generally received of the hypotheses
circulated in the gossip of the day.</p>

<p>From the very commencement of this change, at first so gradual in
its advances, Miss Montague had of course been aware of it. The
intimacy involved in their peculiar relation, as well as the near
interest which it inspired afforded, in her case, a like opportunity
and motive for the successful exercise of that keen and penetrating
observation peculiar to her sex.</p>

<p>His visits became, at length, so interrupted, and his manner, while
they lasted, so abstracted, strange, and agitated, that Lady L&mdash;,
after hinting her anxiety and her suspicions more than once, at length
distinctly stated her anxiety, and pressed for an explanation.</p>

<p>The explanation was given, and although its nature at first relieved
the worst solicitudes of the old lady and her niece, yet the
circumstances which attended it, and the really dreadful consequences
which it obviously indicated, as regarded the spirits, and indeed the
reason of the now wretched man, who made the strange declaration, were
enough, upon little reflection, to fill their minds with perturbation
and alarm.</p>

<p>General Montague, the young lady's father, at length arrived. He had
himself slightly known Barton, some ten or twelve years previously, and
being aware of his fortune and connexions, was disposed to regard him
as an unexceptionable and indeed a most desirable match for his
daughter. He laughed at the story of Barton's supernatural visitations,
and lost no time in calling upon his intended son-in-law.</p>

<p>"My dear Barton," he continued, gaily, "after a little conversation,
my sister tells me that you are a victim to blue devils, in quite a new
and original shape."</p>

<p>Barton changed countenance, and sighed profoundly.</p>

<p>"Come, come; I protest this will never do," continued the General;
"you are more like a man on his way to the gallows than to the altar.
These devils have made quite a saint of you." Barton made an effort to
change the conversation.</p>

<p>"No, no, it won't do," said his visitor laughing; "I am resolved to
say what I have to say upon this magnificent mock mystery of yours. You
must not be angry, but really it is too bad to see you at your time of
life, absolutely frightened into good behaviour, like a naughty child
by a bugaboo, and as far as I can learn, a very contemptible one.
Seriously, I have been a good deal annoyed at what they tell me; but at
the same time thoroughly convinced that there is nothing in the matter
that may not be cleared up, with a little attention and management,
within a week at furthest."</p>

<p>"Ah, General, you do not know&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I do know quite enough to warrant my confidence,"
interrupted the soldier; "don't I know that all your annoyance proceeds
from the occasional appearance of a certain little man in a cap and
great-coat, with a red vest and a bad face, who follows you about, and
pops upon you at corners of lanes, and throws you into ague fits. Now,
my dear fellow, I'll make it my business to catch this mischievous
little mountebank, and either beat him to a jelly with my own hands, or
have him whipped through the town, at the cart's-tail, before a month
passes."</p>

<p>"If you knew what I knew," said Barton, with gloomy agitation, "you
would speak very differently. Don't imagine that I am so weak as to
assume, without proof the most overwhelming, the conclusion to which I
have been forced&mdash;the proofs are here, locked up here." As he
spoke he tapped upon his breast, and with an anxious sigh continued to
walk up and down the room.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Barton," said his visitor, "I'll wager a rump and a
dozen I collar the ghost, and convince even you before many days are
over."</p>

<p>He was running on in the same strain when he was suddenly arrested,
and not a little shocked, by observing Barton, who had approached the
window, stagger slowly back, like one who had received a stunning blow;
his arm extended toward the street&mdash;his face and his very lips
white as ashes&mdash;while he muttered, "There&mdash;by
heaven!&mdash;there&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>General Montague started mechanically to his feet, and from the
window of the drawing-room, saw a figure corresponding as well as his
hurry would permit him to discern, with the description of the person,
whose appearance so persistently disturbed the repose of his
friend.</p>

<p>The figure was just turning from the rails of the area upon which it
had been leaning, and, without waiting to see more, the old gentleman
snatched his cane and hat, and rushed down the stairs and into the
street, in the furious hope of securing the person, and punishing the
audacity of the mysterious stranger. To the reader this is posted so
that you'll know that someone has stolen this story from another source
He looked round him, but in vain, for any trace of the person he had
himself distinctly seen. He ran breathlessly to the nearest corner,
expecting to see from thence the retiring figure, but no such form was
visible. Back and forward, from crossing to crossing, he ran, at fault,
and it was not until the curious gaze and laughing countenances of the
passers-by reminded him of the absurdity of his pursuit, that he
checked his hurried pace, lowered his walking cane from the menacing
altitude which he had mechanically given it, adjusted his hat, and
walked composedly back again, inwardly vexed and flurried. He found
Barton pale and trembling in every joint; they both remained silent,
though under emotions very different. At last Barton whispered, "You
saw it?"</p>

<p>"It!&mdash;him&mdash;some one&mdash;you mean&mdash;to be sure I
did," replied Montague, testily. "But where is the good or the harm of
seeing him? The fellow runs like a lamp-lighter. I wanted to catch him,
but he had stolen away before I could reach the hall-door. However, it
is no great matter; next time, I dare say, I'll do better; and egad, if
I once come within reach of him, I'll introduce his shoulders to the
weight of my cane."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding General Montague's undertakings and exhortations,
however, Barton continued to suffer from the self-same unexplained
cause; go how, when, or where he would, he was still constantly dogged
or confronted by the being who had established over him so horrible an
influence.</p>

<p>Nowhere and at no time was he secure against the odious appearance
which haunted him with such diabolic perseverance.</p>

<p>His depression, misery, and excitement became more settled and
alarming every day, and the mental agonies that ceaselessly preyed upon
him, began at last so sensibly to affect his health, that Lady L&mdash;
and General Montague succeeded, without, indeed, much difficulty, in
persuading him to try a short tour on the Continent, in the hope that
an entire change of scene would, at all events, have the effect of
breaking through the influences of local association, which the more
sceptical of his friends assumed to be by no means inoperative in
suggesting and perpetuating what they conceived to be a mere form of
nervous illusion.</p>

<p>General Montague indeed was persuaded that the figure which haunted
his intended son-in-law was by no means the creation of his
imagination, but, on the contrary, a substantial form of flesh and
blood, animated by a resolution, perhaps with some murderous object in
perspective, to watch and follow the unfortunate gentleman.</p>

<p>Even this hypothesis was not a very pleasant one; yet it was plain
that if Barton could ever be convinced that there was nothing
preternatural in the phenomenon which he had hitherto regarded in that
light, the affair would lose all its terrors in his eyes, and wholly
cease to exercise upon his health and spirits the baleful influence
which it had hitherto done. He therefore reasoned, that if the
annoyance were actually escaped by mere locomotion and change of scene,
it obviously could not have originated in any supernatural agency.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-7"></a>Chapter VII - Flight</h2>

<p>Yielding to their persuasions, Barton left Dublin for England,
accompanied by General Montague. They posted rapidly to London, and
thence to Dover, whence they took the packet with a fair wind for
Calais. The General's confidence in the result of the expedition on
Barton's spirits had risen day by day, since their departure from the
shores of Ireland; for to the inexpressible relief and delight of the
latter, he had not since then, so much as even once fancied a
repetition of those impressions which had, when at home, drawn him
gradually down to the very depths of despair.</p>

<p>This exemption from what he had begun to regard as the inevitable
condition of his existence, and the sense of security which began to
pervade his mind, were inexpressibly delightful; and in the exultation
of what he considered his deliverance, he indulged in a thousand happy
anticipations for a future into which so lately he had hardly dared to
look; and in short, both he and his companion secretly congratulated
themselves upon the termination of that persecution which had been to
its immediate victim a source of such unspeakable agony.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and a crowd of idlers stood upon the jetty
to receive the packet, and enjoy the bustle of the new arrivals.
Montague walked a few paces in advance of his friend, and as he made
his way through the crowd, a little man touched his arm, and said to
him, in a broad provincial patois&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur is walking too fast; he will lose his sick comrade in the
throng, for, by my faith, the poor gentleman seems to be fainting."</p>

<p>Montague turned quickly, and observed that Barton did indeed look
deadly pale. He hastened to his side.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, are you ill?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The question was unheeded and twice repeated, ere Barton
stammered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw him&mdash;by &mdash;&mdash;, I saw him!"</p>

<p>"Him!&mdash;the wretch&mdash;who&mdash;where now?&mdash;where is
he?" cried Montague, looking around him. "I saw him&mdash;but he is
gone," repeated Barton, faintly.</p>

<p>"But where&mdash;where? For God's sake speak," urged Montague,
vehemently.</p>

<p>"It is but this moment here," said he.</p>

<p>"But what did he look like&mdash;what had he on&mdash;what did he
wear&mdash;quick, quick," urged his excited companion, ready to dart
among the crowd and collar the delinquent on the spot.</p>

<p>"He touched your arm&mdash;he spoke to you&mdash;he pointed to me.
God be merciful to me, there is no escape," said Barton, in the low,
subdued tones of despair.</p>

<p>Montague had already bustled away in all the flurry of mingled hope
and rage; but though the singular personnel of the stranger who had
accosted him was vividly impressed upon his recollection, he failed to
discover among the crowd even the slightest resemblance to him.</p>

<p>After a fruitless search, in which he enlisted the services of
several of the bystanders, who aided all the more zealously, as they
believed he had been robbed, he at length, out of breath and baffled,
gave over the attempt.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend, it won't do," said Barton, with the faint voice and
bewildered, ghastly look of one who had been stunned by some mortal
shock; "there is no use in contending; whatever it is, the dreadful
association between me and it, is now established&mdash;I shall never
escape&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, my dear Barton; don't talk so," said Montague
with something at once of irritation and dismay; "you must not, I say;
we'll jockey the scoundrel yet; never mind, I say&mdash;never
mind."</p>

<p>It was, however, but labour lost to endeavour henceforward to
inspire Barton with one ray of hope; he became desponding.</p>

<p>This intangible, and, as it seemed, utterly inadequate influence was
fast destroying his energies of intellect, character, and health. His
first object was now to return to Ireland, there, as he believed, and
now almost hoped, speedily to die.</p>

<p>To Ireland accordingly he came and one of the first faces he saw
upon the shore, was again that of his implacable and dreaded attendant.
Barton seemed at last to have lost not only all enjoyment and every
hope in existence, but all independence of will besides. He now
submitted himself passively to the management of the friends most
nearly interested in his welfare.</p>

<p>With the apathy of entire despair, he implicitly assented to
whatever measures they suggested and advised; and as a last resource,
it was determined to remove him to a house of Lady L&mdash;'s, in the
neighbourhood of Clontarf, where, with the advice of his medical
attendant, who persisted in his opinion that the whole train of
consequences resulted merely from some nervous derangement, it was
resolved that he was to confine himself, strictly to the house, and to
make use only of those apartments which commanded a view of an enclosed
yard, the gates of which were to be kept jealously locked.</p>

<p>Those precautions would certainly secure him against the casual
appearance of any living form, that his excited imagination might
possibly confound with the spectre which, as it was contended, his
fancy recognised in every figure that bore even a distant or general
resemblance to the peculiarities with which his fancy had at first
invested it.</p>

<p>A month or six weeks' absolute seclusion under these conditions, it
was hoped might, by interrupting the series of these terrible
impressions, gradually dispel the predisposing apprehensions, and the
associations which had confirmed the supposed disease, and rendered
recovery hopeless.</p>

<p>Cheerful society and that of his friends was to be constantly
supplied, and on the whole, very sanguine expectations were indulged
in, that under the treatment thus detailed, the obstinate hypochondria
of the patient might at length give way.</p>

<p>Accompanied, therefore, by Lady L&mdash;, General Montague and his
daughter&mdash;his own affianced bride&mdash;poor Barton&mdash;himself
never daring to cherish a hope of his ultimate emancipation from the
horrors under which his life was literally wasting away&mdash;took
possession of the apartments, whose situation protected him against the
intrusions, from which he shrank with such unutterable terror.</p>

<p>After a little time, a steady persistence in this system began to
manifest its results, in a very marked though gradual improvement,
alike in the health and spirits of the invalid. Not, indeed, that
anything at all approaching complete recovery was yet discernible. On
the contrary, to those who had not seen him since the commencement of
his strange sufferings, such an alteration would have been apparent as
might well have shocked them.</p>

<p>The improvement, however, such as it was, was welcomed with
gratitude and delight, especially by the young lady, whom her
attachment to him, as well as her now singularly painful position,
consequent on his protracted illness, rendered an object scarcely one
degree less to be commiserated than himself.</p>

<p>A week passed&mdash;a fortnight&mdash;a month&mdash;and yet there
had been no recurrence of the hated visitation. The treatment had, so
far forth, been followed by complete success. The chain of associations
was broken. The constant pressure upon the overtasked spirits had been
removed, and, under these comparatively favourable circumstances, the
sense of social community with the world about him, and something of
human interest, if not of enjoyment, began to reanimate him.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Lady L&mdash; who, like most old ladies
of the day, was deep in family receipts, and a great pretender to
medical science, dispatched her own maid to the kitchen garden, with a
list of herbs, which were there to be carefully culled, and brought
back to her housekeeper for the purpose stated. The handmaiden,
however, returned with her task scarce half completed, and a good deal
flurried and alarmed. Her mode of accounting for her precipitate
retreat and evident agitation was odd, and, to the old lady,
startling.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-8"></a>Chapter VIII - Softened</h2>

<p>It appeared that she had repaired to the kitchen garden, pursuant to
her mistress's directions, and had there begun to make the specified
election among the rank and neglected herbs which crowded one corner of
the enclosure, and while engaged in this pleasant labour, she
carelessly sang a fragment of an old song, as she said, "to keep
herself company." She was, however, interrupted by an ill-natured
laugh; and, looking up, she saw through the old thorn hedge, which
surrounded the garden, a singularly ill-looking little man, whose
countenance wore the stamp of menace and malignity, standing close to
her, at the other side of the hawthorn screen.</p>

<p>She described herself as utterly unable to move or speak, while he
charged her with a message for Captain Barton; the substance of which
she distinctly remembered to have been to the effect, that he, Captain
Barton, must come abroad as usual, and show himself to his friends, out
of doors, or else prepare for a visit in his own chamber.</p>

<p>On concluding this brief message, the stranger had, with a
threatening air, got down into the outer ditch, and, seizing the
hawthorn stems in his hands, seemed on the point of climbing through
the fence&mdash;a feat which might have been accomplished without much
difficulty.</p>

<p>Without, of course, awaiting this result, the girl&mdash;throwing
down her treasures of thyme and rosemary&mdash;had turned and run, with
the swiftness of terror, to the house. Lady L&mdash; commanded her, on
pain of instant dismissal, to observe an absolute silence respecting
all that passed of the incident which related to Captain Barton; and,
at the same time, directed instant search to be made by her men, in the
garden and the fields adjacent. This measure, however, was as usual,
unsuccessful, and, filled with undefinable misgivings, Lady L&mdash;
communicated the incident to her brother. The story, however, until
long afterwards, went no further, and, of course, it was jealously
guarded from Barton, who continued to amend, though slowly.</p>

<p>Barton now began to walk occasionally in the court-yard which I have
mentioned, and which being enclosed by a high wall, commanded no view
beyond its own extent. Here he, therefore, considered himself perfectly
secure: and, but for a careless violation of orders by one of the
grooms, he might have enjoyed, at least for some time longer, his
much-prized immunity. Opening upon the public road, this yard was
entered by a wooden gate, with a wicket in it, and was further defended
by an iron gate upon the outside. Strict orders had been given to keep
both carefully locked; but, spite of these, it had happened that one
day, as Barton was slowly pacing this narrow enclosure, in his
accustomed walk, and reaching the further extremity, was turning to
retrace his steps, he saw the boarded wicket ajar, and the face of his
tormentor immovably looking at him through the iron bars. For a few
seconds he stood riveted to the earth&mdash;breathless and
bloodless&mdash;in the fascination of that dreaded gaze, and then fell
helplessly insensible, upon the pavement.</p>

<p>There he was found a few minutes afterwards, and conveyed to his
room&mdash;the apartment which he was never afterwards to leave alive.
Henceforward a marked and unaccountable change was observable in the
tone of his mind. Captain Barton was now no longer the excited and
despairing man he had been before; a strange alteration had passed upon
him&mdash;an unearthly tranquillity reigned in his mind&mdash;it was
the anticipated stillness of the grave.</p>

<p>"Montague, my friend, this struggle is nearly ended now," he said,
tranquilly, but with a look of fixed and fearful awe. "I have, at last,
some comfort from that world of spirits, from which my punishment has
come. I now know that my sufferings will soon be over."</p>

<p>Montague pressed him to speak on.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, in a softened voice, "my punishment is nearly ended.
From sorrow, perhaps I shall never, in time or eternity, escape; but my
agony is almost over. Comfort has been revealed to me, and what remains
of my allotted struggle I will bear with submission&mdash;even with
hope."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you speak so tranquilly, my dear Barton," said
Montague; "peace and cheer of mind are all you need to make you what
you were."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I never can be that," said he mournfully. "I am no
longer fit for life. I am soon to die. I am to see him but once again,
and then all is ended."</p>

<p>"He said so, then?" suggested Montague.</p>

<p>"He?&mdash;No, no: good tidings could scarcely come through him; and
these were good and welcome; and they came so solemnly and
sweetly&mdash;with unutterable love and melancholy, such as I could
not&mdash;without saying more than is needful, or fitting, of other
long-past scenes and persons&mdash;fully explain to you." As Barton
said this he shed tears.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Montague, mistaking the source of his emotions,
"you must not give way. What is it, after all, but a pack of dreams and
nonsense; or, at worst, the practices of a scheming rascal that enjoys
his power of playing upon your nerves, and loves to exert it&mdash;a
sneaking vagabond that owes you a grudge, and pays it off this way, not
daring to try a more manly one."</p>

<p>"A grudge, indeed, he owes me&mdash;you say rightly," said Barton,
with a sudden shudder; "a grudge as you call it. Oh, my God! When the
justice of Heaven permits the Evil one to carry out a scheme of
vengeance&mdash;when its execution is committed to the lost and
terrible victim of sin, who owes his own ruin to the man, the very man,
whom he is commissioned to pursue&mdash;then, indeed, the torments and
terrors of hell are anticipated on earth. But heaven has dealt
mercifully with me&mdash;hope has opened to me at last; and if death
could come without the dreadful sight I am doomed to see, I would
gladly close my eyes this moment upon the world. But though death is
welcome, I shrink with an agony you cannot understand&mdash;an actual
frenzy of terror&mdash;from the last encounter with that&mdash;that
DEMON, who has drawn me thus to the verge of the chasm, and who is
himself to plunge me down. I am to see him again&mdash;once
more&mdash;but under circumstances unutterably more terrific than
ever."</p>

<p>As Barton thus spoke, he trembled so violently that Montague was
really alarmed at the extremity of his sudden agitation, and hastened
to lead him back to the topic which had before seemed to exert so
tranquillizing an effect upon his mind.</p>

<p>"It was not a dream," he said, after a time; "I was in a different
state&mdash;I felt differently and strangely; and yet it was all as
real, as clear, and vivid, as what I now see and hear&mdash;it was a
reality."</p>

<p>"And what did you see and hear?" urged his companion.</p>

<p>"When I wakened from the swoon I fell into on seeing him," said
Barton, continuing as if he had not heard the question, "it was slowly,
very slowly&mdash;I was lying by the margin of a broad lake, with misty
hills all round, and a soft, melancholy, rose-coloured light
illuminated it all. It was unusually sad and lonely, and yet more
beautiful than any earthly scene. My head was leaning on the lap of a
girl, and she was singing a song, that told, I know not
how&mdash;whether by words or harmonies&mdash;of all my life&mdash;all
that is past, and all that is still to come; and with the song the old
feelings that I thought had perished within me came back, and tears
flowed from my eyes&mdash;partly for the song and its mysterious
beauty, and partly for the unearthly sweetness of her voice; and yet I
knew the voice&mdash;oh! how well; and I was spellbound as I listened
and looked at the solitary scene, without stirring, almost without
breathing&mdash;and, alas! alas! without turning my eyes towards the
face that I knew was near me, so sweetly powerful was the enchantment
that held me. And so, slowly, the song and scene grew fainter, and
fainter, to my senses, till all was dark and still again. And then I
awoke to this world, as you saw, comforted, for I knew that I was
forgiven much."</p>

<p>Barton wept again long and bitterly.</p>

<p>From this time, as we have said, the prevailing tone of his mind was
one of profound and tranquil melancholy. This, however, was not without
its interruptions. He was thoroughly impressed with the conviction that
he was to experience another and a final visitation, transcending in
horror all he had before experienced. From this anticipated and unknown
agony, he often shrank in such paroxysms of abject terror and
distraction, as filled the whole household with dismay and
superstitious panic. Even those among them who affected to discredit
the theory of preternatural agency, were often in their secret souls
visited during the silence of night with qualms and apprehensions,
which they would not have readily confessed; and none of them attempted
to dissuade Barton from the resolution on which he now systematically
acted, of shutting himself up in his own apartment. The window-blinds
of this room were kept jealously down; and his own man was seldom out
of his presence, day or night, his bed being placed in the same
chamber.</p>

<p>This man was an attached and respectable servant; and his duties, in
addition to those ordinarily imposed upon valets, but which Barton's
independent habits generally dispensed with, were to attend carefully
to the simple precautions by means of which his master hoped to exclude
the dreaded intrusion of the "Watcher." And, in addition to attending
to those arrangements, which amounted merely to guarding against the
possibility of his master's being, through any unscreened window or
open door, exposed to the dreaded influence, the valet was never to
suffer him to be alone&mdash;total solitude, even for a minute, had
become to him now almost as intolerable as the idea of going abroad
into the public ways&mdash;it was an instinctive anticipation of what
was coming.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c2-9"></a>Chapter IX - Requiescat</h2>

<p>It is needless to say, that under these circumstances, no steps were
taken towards the fulfilment of that engagement into which he had
entered. There was quite disparity enough in point of years, and indeed
of habits, between the young lady and Captain Barton, to have precluded
anything like very vehement or romantic attachment on her part. Though
grieved and anxious, therefore, she was very far from being
heartbroken.</p>

<p>Miss Montague, however, devoted much of her time to the patient but
fruitless attempt to cheer the unhappy invalid. She read for him, and
conversed with him; but it was apparent that whatever exertions he
made, the endeavour to escape from the one ever waking fear that preyed
upon him, was utterly and miserably unavailing.</p>

<p>Young ladies are much given to the cultivation of pets; and among
those who shared the favour of Miss Montague was a fine old owl, which
the gardener, who caught him napping among the ivy of a ruined stable,
had dutifully presented to that young lady.</p>

<p>The caprice which regulates such preferences was manifested in the
extravagant favour with which this grim and ill-favoured bird was at
once distinguished by his mistress; and, trifling as this whimsical
circumstance may seem, I am forced to mention it, inasmuch as it is
connected, oddly enough, with the concluding scene of the story.</p>

<p>Barton, so far sharing in this liking for the new favourite,
regarded it from the first with an antipathy as violent as it was
utterly unaccountable. Its very vicinity was unsupportable to him. He
seemed to hate and dread it with a vehemence absolutely laughable, and
which, to those who have never witnessed the exhibition of antipathies
of this kind, would seem all but incredible.</p>

<p>With these few words of preliminary explanation, I shall proceed to
state the particulars of the last scene in this strange series of
incidents. It was almost two o'clock one winter's night, and Barton
was, as usual at that hour, in his bed; the servant we have mentioned
occupied a smaller bed in the same room, and a light was burning. The
man was on a sudden aroused by his master, who said&mdash;"I can't get
it out of my head that that accursed bird has got out somehow, and is
lurking in some corner of the room. I have been dreaming about him. Get
up, Smith, and look about; search for him. Such hateful dreams!"</p>

<p>The servant rose, and examined the chamber, and while engaged in so
doing, he heard the well-known sound, more like a long-drawn gasp than
a hiss, with which these birds from their secret haunts affright the
quiet of the night.</p>

<p>This ghostly indication of its proximity&mdash;for the sound
proceeded from the passage upon which Barton's chamber-door
opened&mdash;determined the search of the servant, who, opening the
door, proceeded a step or two forward for the purpose of driving the
bird away. He had however, hardly entered the lobby, when the door
behind him slowly swung to under the impulse, as it seemed, of some
gentle current of air; but as immediately over the door there was a
kind of window, intended in the day-time to aid in lighting the
passage, and through which at present the rays of the candle were
issuing, the valet could see quite enough for his purpose.</p>

<p>As he advanced he heard his master&mdash;who, lying in a
well-curtained bed, had not, as it seemed, perceived his exit from the
room&mdash;call him by name, and direct him to place the candle on the
table by his bed. The servant, who was now some way in the long
passage, and not liking to raise his voice for the purpose of replying,
lest he should startle the sleeping inmates of the house, began to walk
hurriedly and softly back again, when, to his amazement, he heard a
voice in the interior of the chamber answering calmly, and actually
saw, through the window which overtopped the door, that the light was
slowly shifting, as if carried across the room in answer to his
master's call. Palsied by a feeling akin to terror, yet not unmingled
with curiosity, he stood breathless and listening at the threshold,
unable to summon resolution to push open the door and enter. Then came
a rustling of the curtains, and a sound like that of one who in a low
voice hushes a child to rest, in the midst of which he heard Barton
say, in a tone of stifled horror&mdash;"Oh, God&mdash;oh, my God!" and
repeat the same exclamation several times. Then ensued a silence, which
again was broken by the same strange soothing sound; and at last there
burst forth, in one swelling peal, a yell of agony so appalling and
hideous, that, under some impulse of ungovernable horror, the man
rushed to the door, and with his whole strength strove to force it
open. Whether it was that, in his agitation, he had himself but
imperfectly turned the handle, or that the door was really secured upon
the inside, he failed to effect an entrance; and as he tugged and
pushed, yell after yell rang louder and wilder through the chamber,
accompanied all the while by the same hushed sounds. Actually freezing
with terror, and scarce knowing what he did, the man turned and ran
down the passage, wringing his hands in the extremity of horror and
irresolution. At the stair-head he was encountered by General Montague,
scared and eager, and just as they met the fearful sounds had
ceased.</p>

<p>"What is it? Who&mdash;where is your master?" said Montague with the
incoherence of extreme agitation. "Has anything&mdash;for God's sake is
anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy on us, it's all over," said the man staring wildly
towards his master's chamber. "He's dead, sir, I'm sure he's dead."</p>

<p>Without waiting for inquiry or explanation, Montague, closely
followed by the servant, hurried to the chamber-door, turned the
handle, and pushed it open. As the door yielded to his pressure, the
ill-omened bird of which the servant had been in search, uttering its
spectral warning, started suddenly from the far side of the bed, and
flying through the doorway close over their heads, and extinguishing,
in his passage, the candle which Montague carried, crashed through the
skylight that overlooked the lobby, and sailed away into the darkness
of the outer space.</p>

<p>"There it is, God bless us," whispered the man, after a breathless
pause.</p>

<p>"Curse that bird," muttered the General, startled by the suddenness
of the apparition, and unable to conceal his discomposure.</p>

<p>"The candle is moved," said the man, after another breathless pause,
pointing to the candle that still burned in the room; "see, they put it
by the bed."</p>

<p>"Draw the curtains, fellow, and don't stand gaping there," whispered
Montague, sternly. The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"Hold this, then," said Montague, impatiently thrusting the
candlestick into the servant's hand, and himself advancing to the
bedside, he drew the curtains apart. The light of the candle, which was
still burning at the bedside, fell upon a figure huddled together, and
half upright, at the head of the bed. It seemed as though it had slunk
back as far as the solid panelling would allow, and the hands were
still clutched in the bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Barton, Barton, Barton!" cried the General, with a strange mixture
of awe and vehemence. He took the candle, and held it so that it shone
full upon the face. The features were fixed, stern, and white; the jaw
was fallen; and the sightless eyes, still open, gazed vacantly forward
towards the front of the bed. "God Almighty! He's dead," muttered the
General, as he looked upon this fearful spectacle. They both continued
to gaze upon it in silence for a minute or more. "And cold, too,"
whispered Montague, withdrawing his hand from that of the dead man.</p>

<p>"And see, see&mdash;may I never have life, sir," added the man,
after another pause, with a shudder, "but there was something else on
the bed with him. Look there&mdash;look there&mdash;see that, sir."</p>

<p>As the man thus spoke, he pointed to a deep indenture, as if caused
by a heavy pressure, near the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Montague was silent.</p>

<p>"Come, sir, come away, for God's sake," whispered the man, drawing
close up to him, and holding fast by his arm, while he glanced
fearfully round; "what good can be done here now&mdash;come away, for
God's sake!"</p>

<p>At this moment they heard the steps of more than one approaching,
and Montague, hastily desiring the servant to arrest their progress,
endeavoured to loose the rigid grip with which the fingers of the dead
man were clutched in the bedclothes, and drew, as well as he was able,
the awful figure into a reclining posture; then closing the curtains
carefully upon it, he hastened himself to meet those persons that were
approaching.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>It is needless to follow the personages so slightly connected with
this narrative, into the events of their afterlife; it is enough to say
that no clue to the solution of these mysterious occurrences was ever
after discovered; and so long an interval having now passed since the
event which I have just described concluded this strange history, it is
scarcely to be expected that time can throw any new lights upon its
dark and inexplicable outline. Until the secrets of the earth shall be
no longer hidden, therefore, these transactions must remain shrouded in
their original obscurity.</p>

<p>The only occurrence in Captain Barton's former life to which
reference was ever made, as having any possible connexion with the
sufferings with which his existence closed, and which he himself seemed
to regard as working out a retribution for some grievous sin of his
past life, was a circumstance which not for several years after his
death was brought to light. The nature of this disclosure was painful
to his relatives, and discreditable to his memory.</p>

<p>It appeared that some six years before Captain Barton's final return
to Dublin, he had formed, in the town of Plymouth, a guilty attachment,
the object of which was the daughter of one of the ship's crew under
his command. The father had visited the frailty of his unhappy child
with extreme harshness, and even brutality, and it was said that she
had died heart-broken. Presuming upon Barton's implication in her
guilt, this man had conducted himself towards him with marked
insolence, and Barton retaliated this, and what he resented with still
more exasperated bitterness&mdash;his treatment of the unfortunate
girl&mdash;by a systematic exercise of those terrible and arbitrary
severities which the regulations of the navy placed at the command of
those who are responsible for its discipline. The man had at length
made his escape, while the vessel was in port at Naples, but died, as
it was said, in a hospital in that town, of the wounds inflicted in one
of his recent and sanguinary punishments.</p>

<p>Whether these circumstances in reality bear, or not, upon the
occurrences of Barton's afterlife, it is, of course, impossible to say.
It seems, however, more than probable that they were at least, in his
own mind, closely associated with them. But however the truth may be,
as to the origin and motives of this mysterious persecution, there can
be no doubt that, with respect to the agencies by which it was
accomplished, absolute and impenetrable mystery is like to prevail
until the day of doom.</p>

<p><b>POSTSCRIPT BY THE EDITOR</b></p>

<p>The preceding narrative is given in the ipsissima verba of the good
old clergyman, under whose hand it was delivered to Doctor Hesselius.
Notwithstanding the occasional stiffness and redundancy of his
sentences, I thought it better to reserve to myself the power of
assuring the reader, that in handing to the printer, the MS. of a
statement so marvellous, the Editor has not altered one letter of the
original text.&mdash; [Ed. Papers of Dr. Hesselius.]</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<a name="s3"></a>

<h1>MR. JUSTICE HARBOTTLE</h1>

<h2><a name="c3-p"></a>Prologue</h2>

<p>On this case Doctor Hesselius has inscribed nothing more than the
words, "Harman's Report," and a simple reference to his own
extraordinary Essay on "The Interior Sense, and the Conditions of the
Opening thereof."</p>

<p>The reference is to Vol. I., Section 317, Note Z{a}. The note to
which reference is thus made, simply says: "There are two accounts of
the remarkable case of the Honourable Mr. Justice Harbottle, one
furnished to me by Mrs. Trimmer, of Tunbridge Wells (June, 1805); the
other at a much later date, by Anthony Harman, Esq. I much prefer the
former; in the first place, because it is minute and detailed, and
written, it seems to me, with more caution and knowledge; and in the
next, because the letters from Dr. Hedstone, which are embodied in it,
furnish matter of the highest value to a right apprehension of the
nature of the case. It was one of the best declared cases of an opening
of the interior sense, which I have met with. It was affected too, by
the phenomenon, which occurs so frequently as to indicate a law of
these eccentric conditions; that is to say, it exhibited what I may
term, the contagious character of this sort of intrusion of the
spirit-world upon the proper domain of matter. So soon as the
spirit-action has established itself in the case of one patient, its
developed energy begins to radiate, more or less effectually, upon
others. The interior vision of the child was opened; as was, also, that
of its mother, Mrs. Pyneweck; and both the interior vision and hearing
of the scullery-maid, were opened on the same occasion.
After-appearances are the result of the law explained in Vol. II.,
Section 17 to 49. The common centre of association, simultaneously
recalled, unites, or <i>re</i>unites, as the case may be, for a period
measured, as we see, in Section 37. The <i>maximum</i> will extend to
days, the <i>minimum</i> is little more than a second. We see the
operation of this principle perfectly displayed, in certain cases of
lunacy, of epilepsy, of catalepsy, and of mania, of a peculiar and
painful character, though unattended by incapacity of business."</p>

<p>The memorandum of the case of Judge Harbottle, which was written by
Mrs. Trimmer, of Tunbridge Wells, which Doctor Hesselius thought the
better of the two, I have been unable to discover among his papers. I
found in his escritoire a note to the effect that he had lent the
Report of Judge Harbottle's case, written by Mrs. Trimmer, to Dr. F.
Heyne. To that learned and able gentleman accordingly I wrote, and
received from him, in his reply, which was full of alarms and regrets,
on account of the uncertain safety of that "valuable MS.," a line
written long since by Dr. Hesselius, which completely exonerated him,
inasmuch as it acknowledged the safe return of the papers. The
narrative of Mr. Harman, is therefore, the only one available for this
collection. The late Dr. Hesselius, in another passage of the note that
I have cited, says, "As to the facts (non-medical) of the case, the
narrative of Mr. Harman exactly tallies with that furnished by Mrs.
Trimmer." The strictly scientific view of the case would scarcely
interest the popular reader; and, possibly, for the purposes of this
selection, I should, even had I both papers to choose between, have
preferred that of Mr. Harman, which is given, in full, in the following
pages.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-1"></a>Chapter I - <i>The Judge's House</i></h2>

<p>Thirty years ago, an elderly man, to whom I paid quarterly a small
annuity charged on some property of mine, came on the quarter-day to
receive it. He was a dry, sad, quiet man, who had known better days,
and had always maintained an unexceptionable character. No better
authority could be imagined for a ghost story.</p>

<p>He told me one, though with a manifest reluctance; he was drawn into
the narration by his choosing to explain what I should not have
remarked, that he had called two days earlier than that week after the
strict day of payment, which he had usually allowed to elapse. His
reason was a sudden determination to change his lodgings, and the
consequent necessity of paying his rent a little before it was due.</p>

<p>He lodged in a dark street in Westminster, in a spacious old house,
very warm, being wainscoted from top to bottom, and furnished with no
undue abundance of windows, and those fitted with thick sashes and
small panes.</p>

<p>This house was, as the bills upon the windows testified, offered to
be sold or let. But no one seemed to care to look at it.</p>

<p>A thin matron, in rusty black silk, very taciturn, with large,
steady, alarmed eyes, that seemed to look in your face, to read what
you might have seen in the dark rooms and passages through which you
had passed, was in charge of it, with a solitary "maid-of-all-work"
under her command. My poor friend had taken lodgings in this house, on
account of their extraordinary cheapness. He had occupied them for
nearly a year without the slightest disturbance, and was the only
tenant, under rent, in the house. He had two rooms; a sitting-room and
a bed-room with a closet opening from it, in which he kept his books
and papers locked up. He had gone to his bed, having also locked the
outer door. Unable to sleep, he had lighted a candle, and after having
read for a time, had laid the book beside him. He heard the old clock
at the stairhead strike one; and very shortly after, to his alarm, he
saw the closet-door, which he thought he had locked, open stealthily,
and a slight dark man, particularly sinister, and somewhere about
fifty, dressed in mourning of a very antique fashion, such a suit as we
see in Hogarth, entered the room on tip-toe. He was followed by an
elder man, stout, and blotched with scurvy, and whose features, fixed
as a corpse's, were stamped with dreadful force with a character of
sensuality and villany.</p>

<p>This old man wore a flowered silk dressing-gown and ruffles, and he
remarked a gold ring on his finger, and on his head a cap of velvet,
such as, in the days of perukes, gentlemen wore in undress.</p>

<p>This direful old man carried in his ringed and ruffled hand a coil
of rope; and these two figures crossed the floor diagonally, passing
the foot of his bed, from the closet door at the farther end of the
room, at the left, near the window, to the door opening upon the lobby,
close to the bed's head, at his right.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to describe his sensations as these figures
passed so near him. He merely said, that so far from sleeping in that
room again, no consideration the world could offer would induce him so
much as to enter it again alone, even in the daylight. He found both
doors, that of the closet, and that of the room opening upon the lobby,
in the morning fast locked as he had left them before going to bed.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>These two figures crossed the floor diagonally,
passing the foot of the bed.</i>]</p>

<p>In answer to a question of mine, he said that neither appeared the
least conscious of his presence. They did not seem to glide, but walked
as living men do, but without any sound, and he felt a vibration on the
floor as they crossed it. He so obviously suffered from speaking about
the apparitions, that I asked him no more questions.</p>

<p>There were in his description, however, certain coincidences so very
singular, as to induce me, by that very post, to write to a friend much
my senior, then living in a remote part of England, for the information
which I knew he could give me. He had himself more than once pointed
out that old house to my attention, and told me, though very briefly,
the strange story which I now asked him to give me in greater
detail.</p>

<p>His answer satisfied me; and the following pages convey its
substance.</p>

<p>Your letter (he wrote) tells me you desire some particulars about
the closing years of the life of Mr. Justice Harbottle, one of the
judges of the Court of Common Pleas. You refer, of course, to the
extraordinary occurrences that made that period of his life long after
a theme for "winter tales" and metaphysical speculation. I happen to
know perhaps more than any other man living of those mysterious
particulars.</p>

<p>The old family mansion, when I revisited London, more than thirty
years ago, I examined for the last time. During the years that have
passed since then, I hear that improvement, with its preliminary
demolitions, has been doing wonders for the quarter of Westminster in
which it stood. If I were quite certain that the house had been taken
down, I should have no difficulty about naming the street in which it
stood. As what I have to tell, however, is not likely to improve its
letting value, and as I should not care to get into trouble, I prefer
being silent on that particular point.</p>

<p>How old the house was, I can't tell. People said it was built by
Roger Harbottle, a Turkey merchant, in the reign of King James I. I am
not a good opinion upon such questions; but having been in it, though
in its forlorn and deserted state, I can tell you in a general way what
it was like. It was built of dark-red brick, and the door and windows
were faced with stone that had turned yellow by time. It receded some
feet from the line of the other houses in the street; and it had a
florid and fanciful rail of iron about the broad steps that invited
your ascent to the hall-door, in which were fixed, under a file of
lamps among scrolls and twisted leaves, two immense "extinguishers,"
like the conical caps of fairies, into which, in old times, the footmen
used to thrust their flambeaux when their chairs or coaches had set
down their great people, in the hall or at the steps, as the case might
be. That hall is panelled up to the ceiling, and has a large
fire-place. Two or three stately old rooms open from it at each side.
The windows of these are tall, with many small panes. Passing through
the arch at the back of the hall, you come upon the wide and heavy
well-staircase. There is a back staircase also. The mansion is large,
and has not as much light, by any means, in proportion to its extent,
as modern houses enjoy. When I saw it, it had long been untenanted, and
had the gloomy reputation beside of a haunted house. Cobwebs floated
from the ceilings or spanned the corners of the cornices, and dust lay
thick over everything. The windows were stained with the dust and rain
of fifty years, and darkness had thus grown darker.</p>

<p>When I made it my first visit, it was in company with my father,
when I was still a boy, in the year 1808. I was about twelve years old,
and my imagination impressible, as it always is at that age. I looked
about me with great awe. I was here in the very centre and scene of
those occurrences which I had heard recounted at the fireside at home,
with so delightful a horror.</p>

<p>My father was an old bachelor of nearly sixty when he married. He
had, when a child, seen Judge Harbottle on the bench in his robes and
wig a dozen times at least before his death, which took place in 1748,
and his appearance made a powerful and unpleasant impression, not only
on his imagination, but upon his nerves.</p>

<p>The Judge was at that time a man of some sixty-seven years. He had a
great mulberry-coloured face, a big, carbuncled nose, fierce eyes, and
a grim and brutal mouth. My father, who was young at the time, thought
it the most formidable face he had ever seen; for there were evidences
of intellectual power in the formation and lines of the forehead. His
voice was loud and harsh, and gave effect to the sarcasm which was his
habitual weapon on the bench.</p>

<p>This old gentleman had the reputation of being about the wickedest
man in England. Even on the bench he now and then showed his scorn of
opinion. He had carried cases his own way, it was said, in spite of
counsel, authorities, and even of juries, by a sort of cajolery,
violence, and bamboozling, that somehow confused and overpowered
resistance. He had never actually committed himself; he was too cunning
to do that. He had the character of being, however, a dangerous and
unscrupulous judge; but his character did not trouble him. The
associates he chose for his hours of relaxation cared as little as he
did about it.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-2"></a>Chapter II - <i>Mr. Peters</i></h2>

<p>One night during the session of 1746 this old Judge went down in his
chair to wait in one of the rooms of the House of Lords for the result
of a division in which he and his order were interested.</p>

<p>This over, he was about to return to his house close by, in his
chair; but the night had become so soft and fine that he changed his
mind, sent it home empty, and with two footmen, each with a flambeau,
set out on foot in preference. Gout had made him rather a slow
pedestrian. It took him some time to get through the two or three
streets he had to pass before reaching his house.</p>

<p>In one of those narrow streets of tall houses, perfectly silent at
that hour, he overtook, slowly as he was walking, a very
singular-looking old gentleman.</p>

<p>He had a bottle-green coat on, with a cape to it, and large stone
buttons, a broad-leafed low-crowned hat, from under which a big
powdered wig escaped; he stooped very much, and supported his bending
knees with the aid of a crutch-handled cane, and so shuffled and
tottered along painfully.</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon, sir," said this old man, in a very quavering
voice, as the burly Judge came up with him, and he extended his hand
feebly towards his arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Harbottle saw that the man was by no means poorly
dressed, and his manner that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>The Judge stopped short, and said, in his harsh peremptory tones,
"Well, sir, how can I serve you?"</p>

<p>"Can you direct me to Judge Harbottle's house? I have some
intelligence of the very last importance to communicate to him."</p>

<p>"Can you tell it before witnesses?" asked the Judge.</p>

<p>"By no means; it must reach <i>his</i> ear only," quavered the old
man earnestly.</p>

<p>"If that be so, sir, you have only to accompany me a few steps
farther to reach my house, and obtain a private audience; for I am
Judge Harbottle."</p>

<p>With this invitation the infirm gentleman in the white wig complied
very readily; and in another minute the stranger stood in what was then
termed the front parlour of the Judge's house,
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with that shrewd and dangerous
functionary.</p>

<p>He had to sit down, being very much exhausted, and unable for a
little time to speak; and then he had a fit of coughing, and after that
a fit of gasping; and thus two or three minutes passed, during which
the Judge dropped his roquelaure on an arm-chair, and threw his
cocked-hat over that.</p>

<p>The venerable pedestrian in the white wig quickly recovered his
voice. With closed doors they remained together for some time.</p>

<p>There were guests waiting in the drawing-rooms, and the sound of
men's voices laughing, and then of a female voice singing to a
harpsichord, were heard distinctly in the hall over the stairs; for old
Judge Harbottle had arranged one of his dubious jollifications, such as
might well make the hair of godly men's heads stand upright for that
night.</p>

<p>This old gentleman in the powdered white wig, that rested on his
stooped shoulders, must have had something to say that interested the
Judge very much; for he would not have parted on easy terms with the
ten minutes and upwards which that conference filched from the sort of
revelry in which he most delighted, and in which he was the roaring
king, and in some sort the tyrant also, of his company.</p>

<p>The footman who showed the aged gentleman out observed that the
Judge's mulberry-coloured face, pimples and all, was bleached to a
dingy yellow, and there was the abstraction of agitated thought in his
manner, as he bid the stranger good-night. The servant saw that the
conversation had been of serious import, and that the Judge was
frightened.</p>

<p>Instead of stumping upstairs forthwith to his scandalous hilarities,
his profane company, and his great china bowl of punch&mdash;the
identical bowl from which a bygone Bishop of London, good easy man, had
baptised this Judge's grandfather, now clinking round the rim with
silver ladles, and hung with scrolls of lemon-peel&mdash;instead, I
say, of stumping and clambering up the great staircase to the cavern of
his Circean enchantment, he stood with his big nose flattened against
the window-pane, watching the progress of the feeble old man, who clung
stiffly to the iron rail as he got down, step by step, to the
pavement.</p>

<p>The hall-door had hardly closed, when the old Judge was in the hall
bawling hasty orders, with such stimulating expletives as old colonels
under excitement sometimes indulge in now-a-days, with a stamp or two
of his big foot, and a waving of his clenched fist in the air. He
commanded the footman to overtake the old gentleman in the white wig,
to offer him his protection on his way home, and in no case to show his
face again without having ascertained where he lodged, and who he was,
and all about him.</p>

<p>"By &mdash;&mdash;-, sirrah! if you fail me in this, you doff my
livery to-night!"</p>

<p>Forth bounced the stalwart footman, with his heavy cane under his
arm, and skipped down the steps, and looked up and down the street
after the singular figure, so easy to recognize.</p>

<p>What were his adventures I shall not tell you just now.</p>

<p>The old man, in the conference to which he had been admitted in that
stately panelled room, had just told the Judge a very strange story. He
might be himself a conspirator; he might possibly be crazed; or
possibly his whole story was straight and true.</p>

<p>The aged gentleman in the bottle-green coat, in finding himself
alone with Mr. Justice Harbottle, had become agitated. He said,</p>

<p>"There is, perhaps you are not aware, my lord, a prisoner in
Shrewsbury jail, charged with having forged a bill of exchange for a
hundred and twenty pounds, and his name is Lewis Pyneweck, a grocer of
that town."</p>

<p>"Is there?" says the Judge, who knew well that there was.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," says the old man.</p>

<p>"Then you had better say nothing to affect this case. If you do, by
&mdash;-, I'll commit you! for I'm to try it," says the judge, with his
terrible look and tone.</p>

<p>"I am not going to do anything of the kind, my lord; of him or his
case I know nothing, and care nothing. But a fact has come to my
knowledge which it behoves you to well consider."</p>

<p>"And what may that fact be?" inquired the Judge; "I'm in haste, sir,
and beg you will use dispatch."</p>

<p>"It has come to my knowledge, my lord, that a secret tribunal is in
process of formation, the object of which is to take cognisance of the
conduct of the judges; and first, of <i>your</i> conduct, my lord; it
is a wicked conspiracy."</p>

<p>"Who are of it?" demands the Judge.</p>

<p>"I know not a single name as yet. I know but the fact, my lord; it
is most certainly true."</p>

<p>"I'll have you before the Privy Council, sir," says the Judge.</p>

<p>"That is what I most desire; but not for a day or two, my lord."</p>

<p>"And why so?"</p>

<p>"I have not as yet a single name, as I told your lordship; but I
expect to have a list of the most forward men in it, and some other
papers connected with the plot, in two or three days."</p>

<p>"You said one or two just now."</p>

<p>"About that time, my lord."</p>

<p>"Is this a Jacobite plot?"</p>

<p>"In the main I think it is, my lord."</p>

<p>"Why, then, it is political. I have tried no State prisoners, nor am
like to try any such. How, then, doth it concern me?"</p>

<p>"From what I can gather, my lord, there are those in it who desire
private revenges upon certain judges."</p>

<p>"What do they call their cabal?"</p>

<p>"The High Court of Appeal, my lord."</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Hugh Peters, my lord."</p>

<p>"That should be a Whig name?"</p>

<p>"It is, my lord."

<p>"Where do you lodge, Mr. Peters?"</p>

<p>"In Thames Street, my lord, over against the sign of the 'Three
Kings.'"</p>

<p>"'Three Kings'? Take care one be not too many for you, Mr. Peters!
How come you, an honest Whig, as you say, to be privy to a Jacobite
plot? Answer me that."</p>

<p>"My lord, a person in whom I take an interest has been seduced to
take a part in it; and being frightened at the unexpected wickedness of
their plans, he is resolved to become an informer for the Crown."</p>

<p>"He resolves like a wise man, sir. What does he say of the persons
who are in the plot? Doth he know them?"</p>

<p>"Only two, my lord; but he will be introduced to the club in a few
days, and he will then have a list, and more exact information of their
plans, and above all of their oaths, and their hours and places of
meeting, with which he wishes to be acquainted before they can have any
suspicions of his intentions. And being so informed, to whom, think
you, my lord, had he best go then?"</p>

<p>"To the king's attorney-general straight. But you say this concerns
me, sir, in particular? How about this prisoner, Lewis Pyneweck? Is he
one of them?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, my lord; but for some reason, it is thought your
lordship will be well advised if you try him not. For if you do, it is
feared 'twill shorten your days."</p>

<p>"So far as I can learn, Mr. Peters, this business smells pretty
strong of blood and treason. The king's attorney-general will know how
to deal with it. When shall I see you again, sir?"</p>

<p>"If you give me leave, my lord, either before your lordship's court
sits, or after it rises, to-morrow. I should like to come and tell your
lordship what has passed."</p>

<p>"Do so, Mr. Peters, at nine o'clock to-morrow morning. And see you
play me no trick, sir, in this matter; if you do, by &mdash;&mdash;,
sir, I'll lay you by the heels!"</p>

<p>"You need fear no trick from me, my lord; had I not wished to serve
you, and acquit my own conscience, I never would have come all this way
to talk with your lordship."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to believe you, Mr. Peters; I'm willing to believe you,
sir."</p>

<p>And upon this they parted.</p>

<p>"He has either painted his face, or he is consumedly sick," thought
the old Judge.</p>

<p>The light had shown more effectually upon his features as he turned
to leave the room with a low bow, and they looked, he fancied,
unnaturally chalky.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;- him!" said the Judge ungraciously, as he began to scale
the stairs: "he has half-spoiled my supper."</p>

<p>But if he had, no one but the Judge himself perceived it, and the
evidence was all, as any one might perceive, the other way.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-3"></a>Chapter III - <i>Lewis Pyneweck</i></h2>

<p>In the meantime the footman dispatched in pursuit of Mr. Peters
speedily overtook that feeble gentleman. The old man stopped when he
heard the sound of pursuing steps, but any alarms that may have crossed
his mind seemed to disappear on his recognizing the livery. He very
gratefully accepted the proffered assistance, and placed his tremulous
arm within the servant's for support. They had not gone far, however,
when the old man stopped suddenly, saying,</p>

<p>"Dear me! as I live, I have dropped it. You heard it fall. My eyes,
I fear, won't serve me, and I'm unable to stoop low enough; but if
<i>you</i> will look, you shall have half the find. It is a guinea; I
carried it in my glove."</p>

<p>The street was silent and deserted. The footman had hardly descended
to what he termed his "hunkers," and begun to search the pavement about
the spot which the old man indicated, when Mr. Peters, who seemed very
much exhausted, and breathed with difficulty, struck him a violent
blow, from above, over the back of the head with a heavy instrument,
and then another; and leaving him bleeding and senseless in the gutter,
ran like a lamplighter down a lane to the right, and was gone.</p>

<p>When an hour later, the watchman brought the man in livery home,
still stupid and covered with blood, Judge Harbottle cursed his servant
roundly, swore he was drunk, threatened him with an indictment for
taking bribes to betray his master, and cheered him with a perspective
of the broad street leading from the Old Bailey to Tyburn, the cart's
tail, and the hangman's lash.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this demonstration, the Judge was pleased. It was a
disguised "affidavit man," or footpad, no doubt, who had been employed
to frighten him. The trick had fallen through.</p>

<p>A "court of appeal," such as the false Hugh Peters had indicated,
with assassination for its sanction, would be an uncomfortable
institution for a "hanging judge" like the Honourable Justice
Harbottle. That sarcastic and ferocious administrator of the criminal
code of England, at that time a rather pharisaical, bloody and heinous
system of justice, had reasons of his own for choosing to try that very
Lewis Pyneweck, on whose behalf this audacious trick was devised. Try
him he would. No man living should take that morsel out of his
mouth.</p>

<p>Of Lewis Pyneweck, of course, so far as the outer world could see,
he knew nothing. He would try him after his fashion, without fear,
favour, or affection.</p>

<p>But did he not remember a certain thin man, dressed in mourning, in
whose house, in Shrewsbury, the Judge's lodgings used to be, until a
scandal of ill-treating his wife came suddenly to light? A grocer with
a demure look, a soft step, and a lean face as dark as mahogany, with a
nose sharp and long, standing ever so little awry, and a pair of dark
steady brown eyes under thinly-traced black brows&mdash;a man whose
thin lips wore always a faint unpleasant smile.</p>

<p>Had not that scoundrel an account to settle with the Judge? had he
not been troublesome lately? and was not his name Lewis Pyneweck, some
time grocer in Shrewsbury, and now prisoner in the jail of that
town?</p>

<p>The reader may take it, if he pleases, as a sign that Judge
Harbottle was a good Christian, that he suffered nothing ever from
remorse. That was undoubtedly true. He had, nevertheless, done this
grocer, forger, what you will, some five or six years before, a
grievous wrong; but it was not that, but a possible scandal, and
possible complications, that troubled the learned Judge now.</p>

<p>Did he not, as a lawyer, know, that to bring a man from his shop to
the dock, the chances must be at least ninety-nine out of a hundred
that he is guilty?</p>

<p>A weak man like his learned brother Withershins was not a judge to
keep the high-roads safe, and make crime tremble. Old Judge Harbottle
was the man to make the evil-disposed quiver, and to refresh the world
with showers of wicked blood, and thus save the innocent, to the
refrain of the ancient saw he loved to quote:</p>

<p>Foolish pity<br>
Ruins a city.</p>

<p>In hanging that fellow he could not be wrong. The eye of a man
accustomed to look upon the dock could not fail to read "villain"
written sharp and clear in his plotting face. Of course he would try
him, and no one else should.</p>

<p>A saucy-looking woman, still handsome, in a mob-cap gay with blue
ribbons, in a saque of flowered silk, with lace and rings on, much too
fine for the Judge's housekeeper, which nevertheless she was, peeped
into his study next morning, and, seeing the Judge alone, stepped
in.</p>

<p>"Here's another letter from him, come by the post this morning.
Can't you do nothing for him?" she said wheedlingly, with her arm over
his neck, and her delicate finger and thumb fiddling with the lobe of
his purple ear.</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Judge Harbottle, not raising his eyes from the
paper he was reading.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd do what I asked you," she said.</p>

<p>The Judge clapt his gouty claw over his heart, and made her an
ironical bow.</p>

<p>"What," she asked, "will you do?"</p>

<p>"Hang him," said the Judge with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to; no, you don't, my little man," said she,
surveying herself in a mirror on the wall.</p>

<p>"I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d but I think you're falling in love with your
husband at last!" said Judge Harbottle.</p>

<p>"I'm blest but I think you're growing jealous of him," replied the
lady with a laugh. "But no; he was always a bad one to me; I've done
with him long ago."</p>

<p>"And he with you, by George! When he took your fortune, and your
spoons, and your ear-rings, he had all he wanted of you. He drove you
from his house; and when he discovered you had made yourself
comfortable, and found a good situation, he'd have taken your guineas,
and your silver, and your ear-rings over again, and then allowed you
half-a-dozen years more to make a new harvest for his mill. You don't
wish him good; if you say you do, you lie."</p>

<p>She laughed a wicked, saucy laugh, and gave the terrible
Rhadamanthus a playful tap on the chops.</p>

<p>"He wants me to send him money to fee a counsellor," she said, while
her eyes wandered over the pictures on the wall, and back again to the
looking-glass; and certainly she did not look as if his jeopardy
troubled her very much.</p>

<p>"Confound his impudence, the <i>scoundrel</i>!" thundered the old
Judge, throwing himself back in his chair, as he used to do <i>in
furore</i> on the bench, and the lines of his mouth looked brutal, and
his eyes ready to leap from their sockets. "If you answer his letter
from my house to please yourself, you'll write your next from somebody
else's to please me. You understand, my pretty witch, I'll not be
pestered. Come, no pouting; whimpering won't do. You don't care a brass
farthing for the villain, body or soul. You came here but to make a
row. You are one of Mother Carey's chickens; and where you come, the
storm is up. Get you gone, baggage! get you <i>gone</i>!" he repeated,
with a stamp; for a knock at the hall-door made her instantaneous
disappearance indispensable.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that the venerable Hugh Peters did not appear
again. The Judge never mentioned him. But oddly enough, considering how
he laughed to scorn the weak invention which he had blown into dust at
the very first puff, his white-wigged visitor and the conference in the
dark front parlour were often in his memory.</p>

<p>His shrewd eye told him that allowing for change of tints and such
disguises as the playhouse affords every night, the features of this
false old man, who had turned out too hard for his tall footman, were
identical with those of Lewis Pyneweck.</p>

<p>Judge Harbottle made his registrar call upon the crown solicitor,
and tell him that there was a man in town who bore a wonderful
resemblance to a prisoner in Shrewsbury jail named Lewis Pyneweck, and
to make inquiry through the post forthwith whether any one was
personating Pyneweck in prison and whether he had thus or otherwise
made his escape.</p>

<p>The prisoner was safe, however, and no question as to his
identity.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-4"></a>Chapter IV - <i>Interruption in Court</i></h2>

<p>In due time Judge Harbottle went circuit; and in due time the judges
were in Shrewsbury. News travelled slowly in those days, and
newspapers, like the wagons and stage coaches, took matters easily.
Mrs. Pyneweck, in the Judge's house, with a diminished
household&mdash;the greater part of the Judge's servants having gone
with him, for he had given up riding circuit, and travelled in his
coach in state&mdash;kept house rather solitarily at home.</p>

<p>In spite of quarrels, in spite of mutual injuries&mdash;some of
them, inflicted by herself, enormous&mdash;in spite of a married life
of spited bickerings&mdash;a life in which there seemed no love or
liking or forbearance, for years&mdash;now that Pyneweck stood in near
danger of death, something like remorse came suddenly upon her. She
knew that in Shrewsbury were transacting the scenes which were to
determine his fate. She knew she did not love him; but she could not
have supposed, even a fortnight before, that the hour of suspense could
have affected her so powerfully.</p>

<p>She knew the day on which the trial was expected to take place. She
could not get it out of her head for a minute; she felt faint as it
drew towards evening.</p>

<p>Two or three days passed; and then she knew that the trial must be
over by this time. There were floods between London and Shrewsbury, and
news was long delayed. She wished the floods would last forever. It was
dreadful waiting to hear; dreadful to know that the event was over, and
that she could not hear till self-willed rivers subsided; dreadful to
know that they must subside and the news come at last.</p>

<p>She had some vague trust in the Judge's good nature, and much in the
resources of chance and accident. She had contrived to send the money
he wanted. He would not be without legal advice and energetic and
skilled support.</p>

<p>At last the news did come&mdash;a long arrear all in a gush: a
letter from a female friend in Shrewsbury; a return of the sentences,
sent up for the Judge; and most important, because most easily got at,
being told with great aplomb and brevity, the long-deferred
intelligence of the Shrewsbury Assizes in the <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>. Like an impatient reader of a novel, who reads the last
page first, she read with dizzy eyes the list of the executions.</p>

<p>Two were respited, seven were hanged; and in that capital catalogue
was this line:</p>

<p>"Lewis Pyneweck&mdash;forgery."</p>

<p>She had to read it a half-a-dozen times over before she was sure she
understood it. Here was the paragraph:</p>

<p><i>Sentence, Death&mdash;7.</i></p>

<p>Executed accordingly, on Friday the 13th instant, to wit:</p>

<p>Thomas Primer, <i>alias</i> Duck&mdash;highway robbery. Flora
Guy&mdash;stealing to the value of 11s. 6d. Arthur
Pounden&mdash;burglary. Matilda Mummery&mdash;riot. Lewis
Pyneweck&mdash;forgery, bill of exchange.</p>

<p>And when she reached this, she read it over and over, feeling very
cold and sick.</p>

<p>This buxom housekeeper was known in the house as Mrs.
Carwell&mdash;Carwell being her maiden name, which she had resumed.</p>

<p>No one in the house except its master knew her history. Her
introduction had been managed craftily. No one suspected that it had
been concerted between her and the old reprobate in scarlet and
ermine.</p>

<p>Flora Carwell ran up the stairs now, and snatched her little girl,
hardly seven years of age, whom she met on the lobby, hurriedly up in
her arms, and carried her into her bedroom, without well knowing what
she was doing, and sat down, placing the child before her. She was not
able to speak. She held the child before her, and looked in the little
girl's wondering face, and burst into tears of horror.</p>

<p>She thought the Judge could have saved him. I daresay he could. For
a time she was furious with him, and hugged and kissed her bewildered
little girl, who returned her gaze with large round eyes.</p>

<p>That little girl had lost her father, and knew nothing of the
matter. She had always been told that her father was dead long ago.</p>

<p>A woman, coarse, uneducated, vain, and violent, does not reason, or
even feel, very distinctly; but in these tears of consternation were
mingling a self-upbraiding. She felt afraid of that little child.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Carwell was a person who lived not upon sentiment, but upon
beef and pudding; she consoled herself with punch; she did not trouble
herself long even with resentments; she was a gross and material
person, and could not mourn over the irrevocable for more than a
limited number of hours, even if she would.</p>

<p>Judge Harbottle was soon in London again. Except the gout, this
savage old epicurean never knew a day's sickness. He laughed, and
coaxed, and bullied away the young woman's faint upbraidings, and in a
little time Lewis Pyneweck troubled her no more; and the Judge secretly
chuckled over the perfectly fair removal of a bore, who might have
grown little by little into something very like a tyrant.</p>

<p>It was the lot of the Judge whose adventures I am now recounting to
try criminal cases at the Old Bailey shortly after his return. He had
commenced his charge to the jury in a case of forgery, and was, after
his wont, thundering dead against the prisoner, with many a hard
aggravation and cynical gibe, when suddenly all died away in silence,
and, instead of looking at the jury, the eloquent Judge was gaping at
some person in the body of the court.</p>

<p>Among the persons of small importance who stand and listen at the
sides was one tall enough to show with a little prominence; a slight
mean figure, dressed in seedy black, lean and dark of visage. He had
just handed a letter to the crier, before he caught the Judge's
eye.</p>

<p>That Judge descried, to his amazement, the features of Lewis
Pyneweck. He had the usual faint thin-lipped smile; and with his blue
chin raised in air, and as it seemed quite unconscious of the
distinguished notice he has attracted, he was stretching his low cravat
with his crooked fingers, while he slowly turned his head from side to
side&mdash;a process which enabled the Judge to see distinctly a stripe
of swollen blue round his neck, which indicated, he thought, the grip
of the rope.</p>

<p>This man, with a few others, had got a footing on a step, from which
he could better see the court. He now stepped down, and the Judge lost
sight of him.</p>

<p>His lordship signed energetically with his hand in the direction in
which this man had vanished. He turned to the tipstaff. His first
effort to speak ended in a gasp. He cleared his throat, and told the
astounded official to arrest that man who had interrupted the
court.</p>

<p>"He's but this moment gone down <i>there</i>. Bring him in custody
before me, within ten minutes' time, or I'll strip your gown from your
shoulders and fine the sheriff!" he thundered, while his eyes flashed
round the court in search of the functionary.</p>

<p>Attorneys, counsellors, idle spectators, gazed in the direction in
which Mr. Justice Harbottle had shaken his gnarled old hand. They
compared notes. Not one had seen any one making a disturbance. They
asked one another if the Judge was losing his head.</p>

<p>Nothing came of the search. His lordship concluded his charge a
great deal more tamely; and when the jury retired, he stared round the
court with a wandering mind, and looked as if he would not have given
sixpence to see the prisoner hanged.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-5"></a>Chapter V - <i>Caleb Searcher</i></h2>

<p>The Judge had received the letter; had he known from whom it came,
he would no doubt have read it instantaneously. As it was he simply
read the direction:</p>

<p><i>To the Honourable<br>
The Lord Justice<br>
Elijah Harbottle,<br>
One of his Majesty's Justices of<br>
the Honourable Court of Common Pleas.</i></p>

<p>It remained forgotten in his pocket till he reached home.</p>

<p>When he pulled out that and others from the capacious pocket of his
coat, it had its turn, as he sat in his library in his thick silk
dressing-gown; and then he found its contents to be a closely-written
letter, in a clerk's hand, and an enclosure in "secretary hand," as I
believe the angular scrivinary of law-writings in those days was
termed, engrossed on a bit of parchment about the size of this page.
The letter said:</p>

<p>MR. JUSTICE HARBOTTLE,&mdash;MY LORD,</p>

<p>I am ordered by the High Court of Appeal to acquaint your lordship,
in order to your better preparing yourself for your trial, that a true
bill hath been sent down, and the indictment lieth against your
lordship for the murder of one Lewis Pyneweck of Shrewsbury, citizen,
wrongfully executed for the forgery of a bill of exchange, on the
&mdash;&mdash;th day of &mdash;&mdash; last, by reason of the wilful
perversion of the evidence, and the undue pressure put upon the jury,
together with the illegal admission of evidence by your lordship, well
knowing the same to be illegal, by all which the promoter of the
prosecution of the said indictment, before the High Court of Appeal,
hath lost his life.</p>

<p>And the trial of the said indictment, I am farther ordered to
acquaint your lordship, is fixed for the both day of &mdash;&mdash;
next ensuing, by the right honourable the Lord Chief Justice Twofold,
of the court aforesaid, to wit, the High Court of Appeal, on which day
it will most certainly take place. And I am farther to acquaint your
lordship, to prevent any surprise or miscarriage, that your case stands
first for the said day, and that the said High Court of Appeal sits day
and night, and never rises; and herewith, by order of the said court, I
furnish your lordship with a copy (extract) of the record in this case,
except of the indictment, whereof, notwithstanding, the substance and
effect is supplied to your lordship in this Notice. And farther I am to
inform you, that in case the jury then to try your lordship should find
you guilty, the right honourable the Lord Chief Justice will, in
passing sentence of death upon you, fix the day of execution for the
10th day of &mdash;&mdash;, being one calendar month from the day of
your trial.</p>

<p>It was signed by</p>

<p>CALEB SEARCHER,<br>
Officer of the Crown Solicitor in the Kingdom of Life and Death.</p>

<p>The Judge glanced through the parchment.</p>

<p>"'Sblood! Do they think a man like me is to be bamboozled by their
buffoonery?"</p>

<p>The Judge's coarse features were wrung into one of his sneers; but
he was pale. Possibly, after all, there was a conspiracy on foot. It
was queer. Did they mean to pistol him in his carriage? or did they
only aim at frightening him?</p>

<p>Judge Harbottle had more than enough of animal courage. He was not
afraid of highwaymen, and he had fought more than his share of duels,
being a foul-mouthed advocate while he held briefs at the bar. No one
questioned his fighting qualities. But with respect to this particular
case of Pyneweck, he lived in a house of glass. Was there not his
pretty, dark-eyed, over-dressed housekeeper, Mrs. Flora Carwell? Very
easy for people who knew Shrewsbury to identify Mrs. Pyneweck, if once
put upon the scent; and had he not stormed and worked hard in that
case? Had he not made it hard sailing for the prisoner? Did he not know
very well what the bar thought of it? It would be the worst scandal
that ever blasted Judge.</p>

<p>So much there was intimidating in the matter but nothing more. The
Judge was a little bit gloomy for a day or two after, and more testy
with every one than usual.</p>

<p>He locked up the papers; and about a week after he asked his
housekeeper, one day, in the library:</p>

<p>"Had your husband never a brother?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carwell squalled on this sudden introduction of the funereal
topic, and cried exemplary "piggins full," as the Judge used pleasantly
to say. But he was in no mood for trifling now, and he said
sternly:</p>

<p>"Come, madam! this wearies me. Do it another time; and give me an
answer to my question." So she did.</p>

<p>Pyneweck had no brother living. He once had one; but he died in
Jamaica.</p>

<p>"How do you know he is dead?" asked the Judge.</p>

<p>"Because he told me so."</p>

<p>"Not the dead man."</p>

<p>"Pyneweck told me so."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" sneered the Judge.</p>

<p>He pondered this matter; and time went on. The Judge was growing a
little morose, and less enjoying. The subject struck nearer to his
thoughts than he fancied it could have done. But so it is with most
undivulged vexations, and there was no one to whom he could tell this
one.</p>

<p>It was now the ninth; and Mr Justice Harbottle was glad. He knew
nothing would come of it. Still it bothered him; and to-morrow would
see it well over.</p>

<p>[What of the paper I have cited? No one saw it during his life; no
one, after his death. He spoke of it to Dr. Hedstone; and what
purported to be "a copy," in the old Judge's handwriting, was found.
The original was nowhere. Was it a copy of an illusion, incident to
brain disease? Such is my belief.]</p>

<h2><a name="c3-6"></a>Chapter VI - <i>Arrested</i></h2>

<p>Judge Harbottle went this night to the play at Drury Lane. He was
one of the old fellows who care nothing for late hours, and occasional
knocking about in pursuit of pleasure. He had appointed with two
cronies of Lincoln's Inn to come home in his coach with him to sup
after the play.</p>

<p>They were not in his box, but were to meet him near the entrance,
and get into his carriage there; and Mr. Justice Harbottle, who hated
waiting, was looking a little impatiently from the window.</p>

<p>The Judge yawned.</p>

<p>He told the footman to watch for Counsellor Thavies and Counsellor
Beller, who were coming; and, with another yawn, he laid his cocked hat
on his knees, closed his eyes, leaned back in his corner, wrapped his
mantle closer about him, and began to think of pretty Mrs.
Abington.</p>

<p>And being a man who could sleep like a sailor, at a moment's notice,
he was thinking of taking a nap. Those fellows had no business to keep
a judge waiting.</p>

<p>He heard their voices now. Those rake-hell counsellors were
laughing, and bantering, and sparring after their wont. The carriage
swayed and jerked, as one got in, and then again as the other followed.
The door clapped, and the coach was now jogging and rumbling over the
pavement. The Judge was a little bit sulky. He did not care to sit up
and open his eyes. Let them suppose he was asleep. He heard them laugh
with more malice than good-humour, he thought, as they observed it. He
would give them a d&mdash;&mdash;d hard knock or two when they got to
his door, and till then he would counterfeit his nap.</p>

<p>The clocks were chiming twelve. Beller and Thavies were silent as
tombstones. They were generally loquacious and merry rascals.</p>

<p>The Judge suddenly felt himself roughly seized and thrust from his
corner into the middle of the seat, and opening his eyes, instantly he
found himself between his two companions.</p>

<p>Before he could blurt out the oath that was at his lips, he saw that
they were two strangers&mdash;evil-looking fellows, each with a pistol
in his hand, and dressed like Bow Street officers.</p>

<p>The Judge clutched at the check-string. The coach pulled up. He
stared about him. They were not among houses; but through the windows,
under a broad moonlight, he saw a black moor stretching lifelessly from
right to left, with rotting trees, pointing fantastic branches in the
air, standing here and there in groups, as if they held up their arms
and twigs like fingers, in horrible glee at the Judge's coming.</p>

<p>A footman came to the window. He knew his long face and sunken eyes.
He knew it was Dingly Chuff, fifteen years ago a footman in his
service, whom he had turned off at a moment's notice, in a burst of
jealousy, and indicted for a missing spoon. The man had died in prison
of the jail-fever.</p>

<p>The Judge drew back in utter amazement. His armed companions signed
mutely; and they were again gliding over this unknown moor.</p>

<p>The bloated and gouty old man, in his horror considered the question
of resistance. But his athletic days were long over. This moor was a
desert. There was no help to be had. He was in the hands of strange
servants, even if his recognition turned out to be a delusion, and they
were under the command of his captors. There was nothing for it but
submission, for the present.</p>

<p>Suddenly the coach was brought nearly to a standstill, so that the
prisoner saw an ominous sight from the window.</p>

<p>It was a gigantic gallows beside the road; it stood three-sided, and
from each of its three broad beams at top depended in chains some eight
or ten bodies, from several of which the cere-clothes had dropped away,
leaving the skeletons swinging lightly by their chains. A tall ladder
reached to the summit of the structure, and on the peat beneath lay
bones.</p>

<p>On top of the dark transverse beam facing the road, from which, as
from the other two completing the triangle of death, dangled a row of
these unfortunates in chains, a hangman, with a pipe in his mouth, much
as we see him in the famous print of the "Idle Apprentice," though here
his perch was ever so much higher, was reclining at his ease and
listlessly shying bones, from a little heap at his elbow, at the
skeletons that hung round, bringing down now a rib or two, now a hand,
now half a leg. A long-sighted man could have discerned that he was a
dark fellow, lean; and from continually looking down on the earth from
the elevation over which, in another sense, he always hung, his nose,
his lips, his chin were pendulous and loose, and drawn down into a
monstrous grotesque.</p>

<p>This fellow took his pipe from his mouth on seeing the coach, stood
up, and cut some solemn capers high on his beam, and shook a new rope
in the air, crying with a voice high and distant as the caw of a raven
hovering over a gibbet, "A robe for Judge Harbottle!"</p>

<p>The coach was now driving on at its old swift pace.</p>

<p>So high a gallows as that, the Judge had never, even in his most
hilarious moments, dreamed of. He thought, he must be raving. And the
dead footman! He shook his ears and strained his eyelids; but if he was
dreaming, he was unable to awake himself.</p>

<p>There was no good in threatening these scoundrels. A <i>brutum
fulmen</i> might bring a real one on his head.</p>

<p>Any submission to get out of their hands; and then heaven and earth
he would move to unearth and hunt them down.</p>

<p>Suddenly they drove round a corner of a vast white building, and
under a <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-7"></a>Chapter VII - <i>Chief-Justice Twofold</i></h2>

<p>The Judge found himself in a corridor lighted with dingy oil lamps,
the walls of bare stone; it looked like a passage in a prison. His
guards placed him in the hands of other people. Here and there he saw
bony and gigantic soldiers passing to and fro, with muskets over their
shoulders. They looked straight before them, grinding their teeth, in
bleak fury, with no noise but the clank of their shoes. He saw these by
glimpses, round corners, and at the ends of passages, but he did not
actually pass them by.</p>

<p>And now, passing under a narrow doorway, he found himself in the
dock, confronting a judge in his scarlet robes, in a large court-house.
There was nothing to elevate this Temple of Themis above its vulgar
kind elsewhere. Dingy enough it looked, in spite of candles lighted in
decent abundance. A case had just closed, and the last juror's back was
seen escaping through the door in the wall of the jury-box. There were
some dozen barristers, some fiddling with pen and ink, others buried in
briefs, some beckoning, with the plumes of their pens, to their
attorneys, of whom there were no lack; there were clerks to-ing and
fro-ing, and the officers of the court, and the registrar, who was
handing up a paper to the judge; and the tipstaff, who was presenting a
note at the end of his wand to a king's counsel over the heads of the
crowd between. If this was the High Court of Appeal, which never rose
day or night, it might account for the pale and jaded aspect of
everybody in it. An air of indescribable gloom hung upon the pallid
features of all the people here; no one ever smiled; all looked more or
less secretly suffering.</p>

<p>"The King against Elijah Harbottle!" shouted the officer.</p>

<p>"Is the appellant Lewis Pyneweck in court?" asked Chief-Justice
Twofold, in a voice of thunder, that shook the woodwork of the court,
and boomed down the corridors.</p>

<p>Up stood Pyneweck from his place at the table.</p>

<p>"Arraign the prisoner!" roared the Chief: and Judge Harbottle felt
the panels of the dock round him, and the floor, and the rails quiver
in the vibrations of that tremendous voice.</p>

<p>The prisoner, <i>in limine</i>, objected to this pretended court, as
being a sham, and non-existent in point of law; and then, that, even if
it were a court constituted by law (the Judge was growing dazed), it
had not and could not have any jurisdiction to try him for his conduct
on the bench.</p>

<p>Whereupon the chief-justice laughed suddenly, and every one in
court, turning round upon the prisoner, laughed also, till the laugh
grew and roared all round like a deafening acclamation; he saw nothing
but glittering eyes and teeth, a universal stare and grin; but though
all the voices laughed, not a single face of all those that
concentrated their gaze upon him looked like a laughing face. The mirth
subsided as suddenly as it began.</p>

<p>The indictment was read. Judge Harbottle actually pleaded! He
pleaded "Not Guilty." A jury were sworn. The trial proceeded. Judge
Harbottle was bewildered. This could not be real. He must be either
mad, or <i>going</i> mad, he thought.</p>

<p>One thing could not fail to strike even him. This Chief-Justice
Twofold, who was knocking him about at every turn with sneer and gibe,
and roaring him down with his tremendous voice, was a dilated effigy of
himself; an image of Mr. Justice Harbottle, at least double his size,
and with all his fierce colouring, and his ferocity of eye and visage,
enhanced awfully.</p>

<p>Nothing the prisoner could argue, cite, or state, was permitted to
retard for a moment the march of the case towards its catastrophe.</p>

<p>The chief-justice seemed to feel his power over the jury, and to
exult and riot in the display of it. He glared at them, he nodded to
them; he seemed to have established an understanding with them. The
lights were faint in that part of the court. The jurors were mere
shadows, sitting in rows; the prisoner could see a dozen pair of white
eyes shining, coldly, out of the darkness; and whenever the judge in
his charge, which was contemptuously brief, nodded and grinned and
gibed, the prisoner could see, in the obscurity, by the dip of all
these rows of eyes together, that the jury nodded in acquiescence.</p>

<p>And now the charge was over, the huge chief-justice leaned back
panting and gloating on the prisoner. Every one in the court turned
about, and gazed with steadfast hatred on the man in the dock. From the
jury-box where the twelve sworn brethren were whispering together, a
sound in the general stillness like a prolonged "hiss-s-s!" was heard;
and then, in answer to the challenge of the officer, "How say you,
gentlemen of the jury, guilty or not guilty?" came in a melancholy
voice the finding, "Guilty."</p>

<p>The place seemed to the eyes of the prisoner to grow gradually
darker and darker, till he could discern nothing distinctly but the
lumen of the eyes that were turned upon him from every bench and side
and corner and gallery of the building. The prisoner doubtless thought
that he had quite enough to say, and conclusive, why sentence of death
should not be pronounced upon him; but the lord chief-justice puffed it
contemptuously away, like so much smoke, and proceeded to pass sentence
of death upon the prisoner, having named the tenth of the ensuing month
for his execution.</p>

<p>Before he had recovered the stun of this ominous farce, in obedience
to the mandate, "Remove the prisoner," he was led from the dock. The
lamps seemed all to have gone out, and there were stoves and
charcoal-fires here and there, that threw a faint crimson light on the
walls of the corridors through which he passed. The stones that
composed them looked now enormous, cracked and unhewn.</p>

<p>He came into a vaulted smithy, where two men, naked to the waist,
with heads like bulls, round shoulders, and the arms of giants, were
welding red-hot chains together with hammers that pelted like
thunderbolts.</p>

<p>They looked on the prisoner with fierce red eyes, and rested on
their hammers for a minute; and said the elder to his companion, "Take
out Elijah Harbottle's gyves;" and with a pincers he plucked the end
which lay dazzling in the fire from the furnace.</p>

<p>"One end locks," said he, taking the cool end of the iron in one
hand, while with the grip of a vice he seized the leg of the Judge, and
locked the ring round his ankle. "The other," he said with a grin, "is
welded."</p>

<p>The iron band that was to form the ring for the other leg lay still
red hot upon the stone floor, with brilliant sparks sporting up and down
its surface.</p>

<p>His companion, in his gigantic hands, seized the old Judge's other
leg, and pressed his foot immovably to the stone floor; while his
senior, in a twinkling, with a masterly application of pincers and
hammer, sped the glowing bar around his ankle so tight that the skin
and sinews smoked and bubbled again, and old Judge Harbottle uttered a
yell that seemed to chill the very stones, and make the iron chains
quiver on the wall.</p>

<p>Chains, vaults, smiths, and smithy all vanished in a moment; but the
pain continued. Mr. Justice Harbottle was suffering torture all round
the ankle on which the infernal smiths had just been operating.</p>

<p>His friends, Thavies and Beller, were startled by the Judge's roar
in the midst of their elegant trifling about a marriage
<i>&agrave;-la-mode</i> case which was going on. The Judge was in panic
as well as pain. The street lamps and the light of his own hall door
restored him.</p>

<p>"I'm very bad," growled he between his set teeth; "my foot's
blazing. Who was he that hurt my foot? 'Tis the gout&mdash;'tis the
gout!" he said, awaking completely. "How many hours have we been coming
from the playhouse? 'Sblood, what has happened on the way? I've slept
half the night!"</p>

<p>There had been no hitch or delay, and they had driven home at a good
pace.</p>

<p>The Judge, however, was in gout; he was feverish too; and the
attack, though very short, was sharp; and when, in about a fortnight,
it subsided, his ferocious joviality did not return. He could not get
this dream, as he chose to call it, out of his head.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-8"></a>Chapter VIII - <i>Somebody Has Got Into the
House</i></h2>

<p>People remarked that the Judge was in the vapours. His doctor said
he should go for a fortnight to Buxton.</p>

<p>Whenever the Judge fell into a brown study, he was always conning
over the terms of the sentence pronounced upon him in his
vision&mdash;"in one calendar month from the date of this day;" and
then the usual form, "and you shall be hanged by the neck till you are
dead," etc. "That will be the 10th&mdash;I'm not much in the way of
being hanged. I know what stuff dreams are, and I laugh at them; but
this is continually in my thoughts, as if it forecast misfortune of
some sort. I wish the day my dream gave me were passed and over. I wish
I were well purged of my gout. I wish I were as I used to be. 'Tis
nothing but vapours, nothing but a maggot." The copy of the parchment
and letter which had announced his trial with many a snort and sneer he
would read over and over again, and the scenery and people of his dream
would rise about him in places the most unlikely, and steal him in a
moment from all that surrounded him into a world of shadows.</p>

<p>The Judge had lost his iron energy and banter. He was growing
taciturn and morose. The Bar remarked the change, as well they might.
His friends thought him ill. The doctor said he was troubled with
hypochondria, and that his gout was still lurking in his system, and
ordered him to that ancient haunt of crutches and chalk-stones,
Buxton.</p>

<p>The Judge's spirits were very low; he was frightened about himself;
and he described to his housekeeper, having sent for her to his study
to drink a dish of tea, his strange dream in his drive home from Drury
Lane Playhouse. He was sinking into the state of nervous dejection in
which men lose their faith in orthodox advice, and in despair consult
quacks, astrologers, and nursery storytellers. Could such a dream mean
that he was to have a fit, and so die on the both? She did not think
so. On the contrary, it was certain some good luck must happen on that
day.</p>

<p>The Judge kindled; and for the first time for many days, he looked
for a minute or two like himself, and he tapped her on the cheek with
the hand that was not in flannel.</p>

<p>"Odsbud! odsheart! you dear rogue! I had forgot. There is young
Tom&mdash;yellow Tom, my nephew, you know, lies sick at Harrogate; why
shouldn't he go that day as well as another, and if he does, I get an
estate by it? Why, lookee, I asked Doctor Hedstone yesterday if I was
like to take a fit any time, and he laughed, and swore I was the last
man in town to go off that way."</p>

<p>The Judge sent most of his servants down to Buxton to make his
lodgings and all things comfortable for him. He was to follow in a day
or two.</p>

<p>It was now the 9th; and the next day well over, he might laugh at
his visions and auguries.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 9th, Dr. Hedstone's footman knocked at the
Judge's door. The Doctor ran up the dusky stairs to the drawing-room.
It was a March evening, near the hour of sunset, with an east wind
whistling sharply through the chimney-stacks. A wood fire blazed
cheerily on the hearth. And Judge Harbottle, in what was then called a
brigadier-wig, with his red roquelaure on, helped the glowing effect of
the darkened chamber, which looked red all over like a room on
fire.</p>

<p>The Judge had his feet on a stool, and his huge grim purple face
confronted the fire, and seemed to pant and swell, as the blaze
alternately spread upward and collapsed. He had fallen again among his
blue devils, and was thinking of retiring from the Bench, and of fifty
other gloomy things.</p>

<p>But the Doctor, who was an energetic son of Aesculapius, would
listen to no croaking, told the Judge he was full of gout, and in his
present condition no judge even of his own case, but promised him leave
to pronounce on all those melancholy questions, a fortnight later.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Judge must be very careful. He was overcharged
with gout, and he must not provoke an attack, till the waters of Buxton
should do that office for him, in their own salutary way.</p>

<p>The Doctor did not think him perhaps quite so well as he pretended,
for he told him he wanted rest, and would be better if he went
forthwith to his bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gerningham, his valet, assisted him, and gave him his drops; and
the Judge told him to wait in his bedroom till he should go to
sleep.</p>

<p>Three persons that night had specially odd stories to tell.</p>

<p>The housekeeper had got rid of the trouble of amusing her little
girl at this anxious time, by giving her leave to run about the
sitting-rooms and look at the pictures and china, on the usual
condition of touching nothing. It was not until the last gleam of
sunset had for some time faded, and the twilight had so deepened that
she could no longer discern the colours on the china figures on the
chimneypiece or in the cabinets, that the child returned to the
housekeeper's room to find her mother.</p>

<p>To her she related, after some prattle about the china, and the
pictures, and the Judge's two grand wigs in the dressing-room off the
library, an adventure of an extraordinary kind.</p>

<p>In the hall was placed, as was customary in those times, the
sedan-chair which the master of the house occasionally used, covered
with stamped leather, and studded with gilt nails, and with its red
silk blinds down. In this case, the doors of this old-fashioned
conveyance were locked, the windows up, and, as I said, the blinds
down, but not so closely that the curious child could not peep
underneath one of them, and see into the interior.</p>

<p>A parting beam from the setting sun, admitted through the window of
a back room, shot obliquely through the open door, and lighting on the
chair, shone with a dull transparency through the crimson blind.</p>

<p>To her surprise, the child saw in the shadow a thin man, dressed in
black, seated in it; he had sharp dark features; his nose, she fancied,
a little awry, and his brown eyes were looking straight before him; his
hand was on his thigh, and he stirred no more than the waxen figure she
had seen at Southwark fair.</p>

<p>A child is so often lectured for asking questions, and on the
propriety of silence, and the superior wisdom of its elders, that it
accepts most things at last in good faith; and the little girl
acquiesced respectfully in the occupation of the chair by this
mahogany-faced person as being all right and proper.</p>

<p>It was not until she asked her mother who this man was, and observed
her scared face as she questioned her more minutely upon the appearance
of the stranger, that she began to understand that she had seen
something unaccountable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carwell took the key of the chair from its nail over the
footman's shelf, and led the child by the hand up to the hall, having a
lighted candle in her other hand. She stopped at a distance from the
chair, and placed the candlestick in the child's hand.</p>

<p>"Peep in, Margery, again, and try if there's anything there," she
whispered; "hold the candle near the blind so as to throw its light
through the curtain."</p>

<p>The child peeped, this time with a very solemn face, and intimated
at once that he was gone.</p>

<p>"Look again, and be sure," urged her mother.</p>

<p>The little girl was quite certain; and Mrs. Carwell, with her
mob-cap of lace and cherry-coloured ribbons, and her dark brown hair,
not yet powdered, over a very pale face, unlocked the door, looked in,
and beheld emptiness.</p>

<p>"All a mistake, child, you see."</p>

<p>"<i>There!</i> ma'am! see there! He's gone round the corner," said
the child.</p>

<p>"Where?" said Mrs. Carwell, stepping backward a step.</p>

<p>"Into that room."</p>

<p>"Tut, child! 'twas the shadow," cried Mrs. Carwell, angrily, because
she was frightened. "I moved the candle." But she clutched one of the
poles of the chair, which leant against the wall in the corner, and
pounded the floor furiously with one end of it, being afraid to pass
the open door the child had pointed to.</p>

<p>The cook and two kitchen-maids came running upstairs, not knowing
what to make of this unwonted alarm.</p>

<p>They all searched the room; but it was still and empty, and no sign
of any one's having been there.</p>

<p>Some people may suppose that the direction given to her thoughts by
this odd little incident will account for a very strange illusion which
Mrs. Carwell herself experienced about two hours later.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c3-9"></a>Chapter IX - <i>The Judge Leaves His
House</i></h2>

<p>Mrs. Flora Carwell was going up the great staircase with a posset
for the Judge in a china bowl, on a little silver tray.</p>

<p>Across the top of the well-staircase there runs a massive oak rail;
and, raising her eyes accidentally, she saw an extremely odd-looking
stranger, slim and long, leaning carelessly over with a pipe between
his finger and thumb. Nose, lips, and chin seemed all to droop downward
into extraordinary length, as he leant his odd peering face over the
banister. In his other hand he held a coil of rope, one end of which
escaped from under his elbow and hung over the rail.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carwell, who had no suspicion at the moment, that he was not a
real person, and fancied that he was some one employed in cording the
Judge's luggage, called to know what he was doing there.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, he turned about, and walked across the lobby,
at about the same leisurely pace at which she was ascending, and
entered a room, into which she followed him. It was an uncarpeted and
unfurnished chamber. An open trunk lay upon the floor empty, and beside
it the coil of rope; but empty except for herself. Perhaps, when she
was able to think it over, it was a relief to was no one in the
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carwell was very much frightened, and now concluded that the
child must have seen the same ghost that had just appeared to believe
so; for the face, figure, and dress described by the child were awfully
like Pyneweck; and this certainly was not he.</p>

<p>Very much scared and very hysterical, Mrs. Carwell ran down to her
room, afraid to look over her shoulder, and got some companions about
her, and wept, and talked, and drank more than one cordial, and talked
and wept again, and so on, until, in those early days, it was ten
o'clock, and time to go to bed.</p>

<p>A scullery maid remained up finishing some of her scouring and
"scalding" for some time after the other servants&mdash;who, as I said,
were few in number&mdash;that night had got to their beds. This was a
low-browed, broad-faced, intrepid wench with black hair, who did not
"vally a ghost not a button," and treated the housekeeper's hysterics
with measureless scorn.</p>

<p>The old house was quiet now. It was near twelve o'clock, no sounds
were audible except the muffled wailing of the wintry winds, piping
high among the roofs and chimneys, or rumbling at intervals, in under
gusts, through the narrow channels of the street.</p>

<p>The spacious solitudes of the kitchen level were awfully dark, and
this sceptical kitchen-wench was the only person now up and about the
house. She hummed tunes to herself, for a time; and then stopped and
listened; and then resumed her work again. At last, she was destined to
be more terrified than even was the housekeeper.</p>

<p>There was a back kitchen in this house, and from this she heard, as
if coming from below its foundations, a sound like heavy strokes, that
seemed to shake the earth beneath her feet. Sometimes a dozen in
sequence, at regular intervals; sometimes fewer. She walked out softly
into the passage, and was surprised to see a dusky glow issuing from
this room, as if from a charcoal fire.</p>

<p>The room seemed thick with smoke.</p>

<p>Looking in she very dimly beheld a monstrous figure, over a furnace,
beating with a mighty hammer the rings and rivets of a chain.</p>

<p>The strokes, swift and heavy as they looked, sounded hollow and
distant. The man stopped, and pointed to something on the floor, that,
through the smoky haze, looked, the thought, like a dead body. She
remarked no more; but the servants in the room close by, startled from
their sleep by a hideous scream, found her in a swoon on the flags,
close to the door, where she had just witnessed this ghastly
vision.</p>

<p>Startled by the girl's incoherent asseverations that she had seen
the Judge's corpse on the floor, two servants having first searched the
lower part of the house, went rather frightened up-stairs to inquire
whether their master was well. They found him, not in his bed, but in
his room. He had a table with candles burning at his bedside, and was
getting on his clothes again; and he swore and cursed at them roundly
in his old style, telling them that he had business, and that he would
discharge on the spot any scoundrel who should dare to disturb him
again.</p>

<p>So the invalid was left to his quietude.</p>

<p>In the morning it was rumored here and there in the street that the
Judge was dead. A servant was sent from the house three doors away, by
Counsellor Traverse, to inquire at Judge Harbottle's hall door.</p>

<p>The servant who opened it was pale and reserved, and would only say
that the Judge was ill. He had had a dangerous accident; Doctor
Hedstone had been with him at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>There were averted looks, short answers, pale and frowning faces,
and all the usual signs that there was a secret that sat heavily upon
their minds and the time for disclosing which had not yet come. That
time would arrive when the coroner had arrived, and the mortal scandal
that had befallen the house could be no longer hidden. For that morning
Mr. Justice Harbottle had been found hanging by the neck from the
banister at the top of the great staircase, and quite dead.</p>

<p>There was not the smallest sign of any struggle or resistance. There
had not been heard a cry or any other noise in the slightest degree
indicative of violence. There was medical evidence to show that, in his
atrabilious state, it was quite on the cards that he might have made
away with himself. The jury found accordingly that it was a case of
suicide. But to those who were acquainted with the strange story which
Judge Harbottle had related to at least two persons, the fact that the
catastrophe occurred on the morning of March 10th seemed a startling
coincidence.</p>

<p>A few days after, the pomp of a great funeral attended him to the
grave; and so, in the language of Scripture, "the rich man died, and
was buried."</p>

<h1>THE ROOM IN THE DRAGON VOLANT</h1>

<h2><a name="c4-p"></a><i>Prologue</i></h2>

<p><i>The curious case which I am about to place before you, is
referred to, very pointedly, and more than once, in the extraordinary
Essay upon the Drug of the Dark and the Middle Ages, from the pen of
Doctor Hesselius</i>.</p>

<p><i>This Essay he entitles</i> Mortis Imago, <i>and he, therein,
discusses the</i> Vinum letiferum, <i>the</i> Beatifica, <i>the</i>
Somnus Angelorum, <i>the</i> Hypnus Sagarum, <i>the</i> Aqua
Thessalliae, <i>and about twenty other infusions and distillations,
well known to the sages of eight hundred years ago, and two of which
are still, he alleges, known to the fraternity of thieves, and, among
them, as police-office inquiries sometimes disclose to this day, in
practical use</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Essay,</i> Mortis Imago, <i>will occupy, as nearly as I can
at present calculate, two volumes, the ninth and tenth, of the
collected papers of Dr. Martin Hesselius</i>.</p>

<p><i>This Essay, I may remark in conclusion, is very curiously
enriched by citations, in great abundance, from medieval verse and
prose romance, some of the most valuable of which, strange to say, are
Egyptian</i>.</p>

<p><i>I have selected this particular statement from among many cases
equally striking, but hardly, I think, so effective as mere narratives;
in this irregular form of publication, it is simply as a story that I
present it</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="c4-1"></a>Chapter I - ON THE ROAD</h2>

<p>In the eventful year, 1815, I was exactly three-and-twenty, and had
just succeeded to a very large sum in consols and other securities. The
first fall of Napoleon had thrown the Continent open to English
excursionists, anxious, let us suppose, to improve their minds by
foreign travel; and I&mdash;the slight check of the "hundred days"
removed, by the genius of Wellington, on the field of
Waterloo&mdash;was now added to the philosophic throng.</p>

<p>I was posting up to Paris from Brussels, following, I presume, the
route that the allied army had pursued but a few weeks
before&mdash;more carriages than you could believe were pursuing the
same line. You could not look back or forward, without seeing into far
perspective the clouds of dust which marked the line of the long series
of vehicles. We were perpetually passing relays of return-horses, on
their way, jaded and dusty, to the inns from which they had been taken.
They were arduous times for those patient public servants. The whole
world seemed posting up to Paris.</p>

<p>I ought to have noted it more particularly, but my head was so full
of Paris and the future that I passed the intervening scenery with
little patience and less attention; I think, however, that it was about
four miles to the frontier side of a rather picturesque little town,
the name of which, as of many more important places through which I
posted in my hurried journey, I forget, and about two hours before
sunset, that we came up with a carriage in distress.</p>

<p>It was not quite an upset. But the two leaders were lying flat. The
booted postilions had got down, and two servants who seemed very much
at sea in such matters, were by way of assisting them. A pretty little
bonnet and head were popped out of the window of the carriage in
distress. Its <i>tournure</i>, and that of the shoulders that also
appeared for a moment, was captivating: I resolved to play the part of
a good Samaritan; stopped my chaise, jumped out, and with my servant
lent a very willing hand in the emergency. Alas! the lady with the
pretty bonnet wore a very thick black veil. I could see nothing but the
pattern of the Brussels lace as she drew back.</p>

<p>A lean old gentleman, almost at the same time, stuck his head out of
the window. An invalid he seemed, for although the day was hot he wore
a black muffler which came up to his ears and nose, quite covering the
lower part of his face, an arrangement which he disturbed by pulling it
down for a moment, and poured forth a torrent of French thanks, as he
uncovered his black wig, and gesticulated with grateful animation.</p>

<p>One of my very few accomplishments, besides boxing, which was
cultivated by all Englishmen at that time, was French; and I replied, I
hope and believe grammatically. Many bows being exchanged, the old
gentleman's head went in again, and the demure, pretty little bonnet
once more appeared.</p>

<p>The lady must have heard me speak to my servant, for she framed her
little speech in such pretty, broken English, and in a voice so sweet,
that I more than ever cursed the black veil that baulked my romantic
curiosity.</p>

<p>The arms that were emblazoned on the panel were peculiar; I remember
especially one device&mdash;it was the figure of a stork, painted in
carmine, upon what the heralds call a "field or." The bird was standing
upon one leg, and in the other claw held a stone. This is, I believe,
the emblem of vigilance. Its oddity struck me, and remained impressed
upon my memory. There were supporters besides, but I forget what they
were. The courtly manners of these people, the style of their servants,
the elegance of their traveling carriage, and the supporters to their
arms, satisfied me that they were noble.</p>

<p>The lady, you may be sure, was not the less interesting on that
account. What a fascination a title exercises upon the imagination! I
do not mean on that of snobs or moral flunkies. Superiority of rank is
a powerful and genuine influence in love. The idea of superior
refinement is associated with it. The careless notice of the squire
tells more upon the heart of the pretty milk-maid than years of honest
Dobbin's manly devotion, and so on and up. It is an unjust world!</p>

<p>But in this case there was something more. I was conscious of being
good-looking. I really believe I was; and there could be no mistake
about my being nearly six feet high. Why need this lady have thanked
me? Had not her husband, for such I assumed him to be, thanked me quite
enough and for both? I was instinctively aware that the lady was
looking on me with no unwilling eyes; and, through her veil, I felt the
power of her gaze.</p>

<p>She was now rolling away, with a train of dust behind her wheels in
the golden sunlight, and a wise young gentleman followed her with
ardent eyes and sighed profoundly as the distance increased.</p>

<p>I told the postilions on no account to pass the carriage, but to
keep it steadily in view, and to pull up at whatever posting-house it
should stop at. We were soon in the little town, and the carriage we
followed drew up at the Belle &Eacute;toile, a comfortable old inn.
They got out of the carriage and entered the house.</p>

<p>At a leisurely pace we followed. I got down, and mounted the steps
listlessly, like a man quite apathetic and careless.</p>

<p>Audacious as I was, I did not care to inquire in what room I should
find them. I peeped into the apartment to my right, and then into that
on my left. <i>My</i> people were not there. I ascended the stairs. A
drawing-room door stood open. I entered with the most innocent air in
the world. It was a spacious room, and, beside myself, contained but
one living figure&mdash;a very pretty and lady-like one. There was the
very bonnet with which I had fallen in love. The lady stood with her
back toward me. I could not tell whether the envious veil was raised;
she was reading a letter.</p>

<p>I stood for a minute in fixed attention, gazing upon her, in vague
hope that she might turn about and give me an opportunity of seeing her
features. She did not; but with a step or two she placed herself before
a little cabriole-table, which stood against the wall, from which rose
a tall mirror in a tarnished frame.</p>

<p>I might, indeed, have mistaken it for a picture; for it now
reflected a half-length portrait of a singularly beautiful woman.</p>

<p>She was looking down upon a letter which she held in her slender
fingers, and in which she seemed absorbed.</p>

<p>The face was oval, melancholy, sweet. It had in it, nevertheless, a
faint and undefinably sensual quality also. Nothing could exceed the
delicacy of its features, or the brilliancy of its tints. The eyes,
indeed, were lowered, so that I could not see their color; nothing but
their long lashes and delicate eyebrows. She continued reading. She
must have been deeply interested; I never saw a living form so
motionless&mdash;I gazed on a tinted statue.</p>

<p>Being at that time blessed with long and keen vision, I saw this
beautiful face with perfect distinctness. I saw even the blue veins
that traced their wanderings on the whiteness of her full throat.</p>

<p>I ought to have retreated as noiselessly as I came in, before my
presence was detected. But I was too much interested to move from the
spot, for a few moments longer; and while they were passing, she raised
her eyes. Those eyes were large, and of that hue which modern poets
term "violet."</p>

<p>These splendid melancholy eyes were turned upon me from the glass,
with a haughty stare, and hastily the lady lowered her black veil, and
turned about.</p>

<p>I fancied that she hoped I had not seen her. I was watching every
look and movement, the minutest, with an attention as intense as if an
ordeal involving my life depended on them.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-2"></a>Chapter II - THE INN-YARD OF THE BELLE
&Eacute;TOILE</h2>

<p>The face was, indeed, one to fall in love with at first sight. Those
sentiments that take such sudden possession of young men were now
dominating my curiosity. My audacity faltered before her; and I felt
that my presence in this room was probably an impertinence. This point
she quickly settled, for the same very sweet voice I had heard before,
now said coldly, and this time in French, "Monsieur cannot be aware but
that this apartment is not public."</p>

<p>I bowed very low, faltered some apologies, and backed to the
door.</p>

<p>I suppose I looked penitent, and embarrassed. I certainly felt so;
for the lady said, by way it seemed of softening matters, "I am happy,
however, to have an opportunity of again thanking Monsieur for the
assistance, so prompt and effectual, which he had the goodness to
render us today."</p>

<p>It was more the altered tone in which it was spoken, than the speech
itself, that encouraged me. It was also true that she need not have
recognized me; and if she had, she certainly was not obliged to thank
me over again.</p>

<p>All this was indescribably flattering, and all the more so that it
followed so quickly on her slight reproof. The tone in which she spoke
had become low and timid, and I observed that she turned her head
quickly towards a second door of the room; I fancied that the gentleman
in the black wig, a jealous husband perhaps, might reappear through it.
Almost at the same moment, a voice at once reedy and nasal was heard
snarling some directions to a servant, and evidently approaching. It
was the voice that had thanked me so profusely, from the carriage
windows, about an hour before.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will have the goodness to retire," said the lady, in a
tone that resembled entreaty, at the same time gently waving her hand
toward the door through which I had entered. Bowing again very low, I
stepped back, and closed the door.</p>

<p>I ran down the stairs, very much elated. I saw the host of the Belle
&Eacute;toile which, as I said, was the sign and designation of my
inn.</p>

<p>I described the apartment I had just quitted, said I liked it, and
asked whether I could have it.</p>

<p>He was extremely troubled, but that apartment and two adjoining
rooms were engaged.</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"People of distinction."</p>

<p>"But who are they? They must have names or titles."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, Monsieur, but such a stream is rolling into Paris,
that we have ceased to inquire the names or titles of our
guests&mdash;we designate them simply by the rooms they occupy."</p>

<p>"What stay do they make?"</p>

<p>"Even that, Monsieur, I cannot answer. It does not interest us. Our
rooms, while this continues, can never be, for a moment,
disengaged."</p>

<p>"I should have liked those rooms so much! Is one of them a sleeping
apartment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and Monsieur will observe that people do not usually
engage bedrooms unless they mean to stay the night."</p>

<p>"Well, I can, I suppose, have some rooms, any, I don't care in what
part of the house?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Monsieur can have two apartments. They are the last at
present disengaged."</p>

<p>I took them instantly.</p>

<p>It was plain these people meant to make a stay here; at least they
would not go till morning. I began to feel that I was all but engaged
in an adventure.</p>

<p>I took possession of my rooms, and looked out of the window, which I
found commanded the inn-yard. Many horses were being liberated from the
traces, hot and weary, and others fresh from the stables being put to.
A great many vehicles&mdash;some private carriages, others, like mine,
of that public class which is equivalent to our old English
post-chaise, were standing on the pavement, waiting their turn for
relays. Fussy servants were to-ing and fro-ing, and idle ones lounging
or laughing, and the scene, on the whole, was animated and amusing.</p>

<p>Among these objects, I thought I recognized the traveling carriage,
and one of the servants of the "persons of distinction" about whom I
was, just then, so profoundly interested.</p>

<p>I therefore ran down the stairs, made my way to the back door; and
so, behold me, in a moment, upon the uneven pavement, among all these
sights and sounds which in such a place attend upon a period of
extraordinary crush and traffic. By this time the sun was near its
setting, and threw its golden beams on the red brick chimneys of the
offices, and made the two barrels, that figured as pigeon-houses, on
the tops of poles, look as if they were on fire. Everything in this
light becomes picturesque; and things interest us which, in the sober
grey of morning, are dull enough.</p>

<p>After a little search I lighted upon the very carriage of which I
was in quest. A servant was locking one of the doors, for it was made
with the security of lock and key. I paused near, looking at the panel
of the door.</p>

<p>"A very pretty device that red stork!" I observed, pointing to the
shield on the door, "and no doubt indicates a distinguished
family?"</p>

<p>The servant looked at me for a moment, as he placed the little key
in his pocket, and said with a slightly sarcastic bow and smile,
"Monsieur is at liberty to conjecture."</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, I forthwith administered that laxative which, on
occasion, acts so happily upon the tongue&mdash;I mean a "tip."</p>

<p>The servant looked at the Napoleon in his hand, and then in my face,
with a sincere expression of surprise. "Monsieur is very generous!"</p>

<p>"Not worth mentioning&mdash;who are the lady and gentleman who came
here in this carriage, and whom, you may remember, I and my servant
assisted today in an emergency, when their horses had come to the
ground?"</p>

<p>"They are the Count, and the young lady we call the
Countess&mdash;but I know not, she may be his daughter."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where they live?"</p>

<p>"Upon my honor, Monsieur, I am unable&mdash;I know not."</p>

<p>"Not know where your master lives! Surely you know something more
about him than his name?"</p>

<p>"Nothing worth relating, Monsieur; in fact, I was hired in Brussels,
on the very day they started. Monsieur Picard, my fellow-servant,
Monsieur the Comte's gentleman, he has been years in his service, and
knows everything; but he never speaks except to communicate an order.
From him I have learned nothing. We are going to Paris, however, and
there I shall speedily pick up all about them. At present I am as
ignorant of all that as Monsieur himself."</p>

<p>"And where is Monsieur Picard?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to the cutler's to get his razors set. But I do not
think he will tell anything."</p>

<p>This was a poor harvest for my golden sowing. The man, I think,
spoke truth, and would honestly have betrayed the secrets of the
family, if he had possessed any. I took my leave politely; and mounting
the stairs again, I found myself once more in my room.</p>

<p>Forthwith I summoned my servant. Though I had brought him with me
from England, he was a native of France&mdash;a useful fellow, sharp,
bustling, and, of course, quite familiar with the ways and tricks of
his countrymen.</p>

<p>"St. Clair, shut the door; come here. I can't rest till I have made
out something about those people of rank who have got the apartments
under mine. Here are fifteen francs; make out the servants we assisted
today have them to a <i>petit souper</i>, and come back and tell me
their entire history. I have, this moment, seen one of them who knows
nothing, and has communicated it. The other, whose name I forget, is
the unknown nobleman's valet, and knows everything. Him you must pump.
It is, of course, the venerable peer, and not the young lady who
accompanies him, that interests me&mdash;you understand? Begone! fly!
and return with all the details I sigh for, and every circumstance that
can possibly interest me."</p>

<p>It was a commission which admirably suited the tastes and spirits of
my worthy St. Clair, to whom, you will have observed, I had accustomed
myself to talk with the peculiar familiarity which the old French
comedy establishes between master and valet.</p>

<p>I am sure he laughed at me in secret; but nothing could be more
polite and deferential.</p>

<p>With several wise looks, nods and shrugs, he withdrew; and looking
down from my window, I saw him with incredible quickness enter the
yard, where I soon lost sight of him among the carriages.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-3"></a>Chapter III - DEATH AND LOVE TOGETHER MATED</h2>

<p>When the day drags, when a man is solitary, and in a fever of
impatience and suspense; when the minute hand of his watch travels as
slowly as the hour hand used to do, and the hour hand has lost all
appreciable motion; when he yawns, and beats the devil's tattoo, and
flattens his handsome nose against the window, and whistles tunes he
hates, and, in short, does not know what to do with himself, it is
deeply to be regretted that he cannot make a solemn dinner of three
courses more than once in a day. The laws of matter, to which we are
slaves, deny us that resource.</p>

<p>But in the times I speak of, supper was still a substantial meal,
and its hour was approaching. This was consolatory. Three-quarters of
an hour, however, still interposed. How was I to dispose of that
interval?</p>

<p>I had two or three idle books, it is true, as companions-companions;
but there are many moods in which one cannot read. My novel lay with my
rug and walking-stick on the sofa, and I did not care if the heroine
and the hero were both drowned together in the water barrel that I saw
in the inn-yard under my window. I took a turn or two up and down my
room, and sighed, looking at myself in the glass, adjusted my great
white "choker," folded and tied after Brummel, the immortal "Beau," put
on a buff waist-coat and my blue swallow-tailed coat with gilt buttons;
I deluged my pocket-handkerchief with Eau-de-Cologne (we had not then
the variety of bouquets with which the genius of perfumery has since
blessed us) I arranged my hair, on which I piqued myself, and which I
loved to groom in those days. That dark-brown <i>chevelure</i>, with a
natural curl, is now represented by a few dozen perfectly white hairs,
and its place&mdash;a smooth, bald, pink head&mdash;knows it no more.
But let us forget these mortifications. It was then rich, thick, and
dark-brown. I was making a very careful toilet. I took my
unexceptionable hat from its case, and placed it lightly on my wise
head, as nearly as memory and practice enabled me to do so, at that
very slight inclination which the immortal person I have mentioned was
wont to give to his. A pair of light French gloves and a rather
club-like knotted walking-stick, such as just then came into vogue for
a year or two again in England, in the phraseology of Sir Walter
Scott's romances "completed my equipment."</p>

<p>All this attention to effect, preparatory to a mere lounge in the
yard, or on the steps of the Belle &Eacute;toile, was a simple act of
devotion to the wonderful eyes which I had that evening beheld for the
first time, and never, never could forget! In plain terms, it was all
done in the vague, very vague hope that those eyes might behold the
unexceptionable get-up of a melancholy slave, and retain the image, not
altogether without secret approbation.</p>

<p>As I completed my preparations the light failed me; the last level
streak of sunlight disappeared, and a fading twilight only remained. I
sighed in unison with the pensive hour, and threw open the window,
intending to look out for a moment before going downstairs. I perceived
instantly that the window underneath mine was also open, for I heard
two voices in conversation, although I could not distinguish what they
were saying.</p>

<p>The male voice was peculiar; it was, as I told you, reedy and nasal.
I knew it, of course, instantly. The answering voice spoke in those
sweet tones which I recognized only too easily. The dialogue was only
for a minute; the repulsive male voice laughed, I fancied, with a kind
of devilish satire, and retired from the window, so that I almost
ceased to hear it.</p>

<p>The other voice remained nearer the window, but not so near as at
first.</p>

<p>It was not an altercation; there was evidently nothing the least
exciting in the colloquy. What would I not have given that it had been
a quarrel&mdash;a violent one&mdash;and I the redresser of wrongs, and
the defender of insulted beauty! Alas! so far as I could pronounce upon
the character of the tones I heard, they might be as tranquil a pair as
any in existence. In a moment more the lady began to sing an odd little
chanson. I need not remind you how much farther the voice is heard
singing than speaking. I could distinguish the words. The voice was of
that exquisitely sweet kind which is called, I believe, a
semi-contralto; it had something pathetic, and something, I fancied, a
little mocking in its tones. I venture a clumsy, but adequate
translation of the words:</p>

<pre>
  "Death and Love, together mated,
    Watch and wait in ambuscade;
  At early morn, or else belated,
    They meet and mark the man or maid.

  Burning sigh, or breath that freezes,
    Numbs or maddens man or maid;
  Death or Love the victim seizes,
    Breathing from their ambuscade."
</pre>

<p>"Enough, Madame!" said the old voice, with sudden severity. "We do
not desire, I believe, to amuse the grooms and hostlers in the yard
with our music."</p>

<p>The lady's voice laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"You desire to quarrel, Madame!" And the old man, I presume, shut
down the window. Down it went, at all events, with a rattle that might
easily have broken the glass.</p>

<p>Of all thin partitions, glass is the most effectual excluder of
sound. I heard no more, not even the subdued hum of the colloquy.</p>

<p>What a charming voice this Countess had! How it melted, swelled, and
trembled! How it moved, and even agitated me! What a pity that a hoarse
old jackdaw should have power to crow down such a Philomel! "Alas! what
a life it is!" I moralized, wisely. "That beautiful Countess, with the
patience of an angel and the beauty of a Venus and the accomplishments
of all the Muses, a slave! She knows perfectly who occupies the
apartments over hers; she heard me raise my window. One may conjecture
pretty well for whom that music was intended&mdash;aye, old gentleman,
and for whom you suspected it to be intended."</p>

<p>In a very agreeable flutter I left my room and, descending the
stairs, passed the Count's door very much at my leisure. There was just
a chance that the beautiful songstress might emerge. I dropped my stick
on the lobby, near their door, and you may be sure it took me some
little time to pick it up! Fortune, nevertheless, did not favor me. I
could not stay on the lobby all night picking up my stick, so I went
down to the hall.</p>

<p>I consulted the clock, and found that there remained but a quarter
of an hour to the moment of supper.</p>

<p>Everyone was roughing it now, every inn in confusion; people might
do at such a juncture what they never did before. Was it just possible
that, for once, the Count and Countess would take their chairs at the
table-d'h&ocirc;te?</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-4"></a>Chapter IV - MONSIEUR DROQVILLE</h2>

<p>Full of this exciting hope I sauntered out upon the steps of the
Belle &Eacute;toile. It was now night, and a pleasant moonlight over
everything. I had entered more into my romance since my arrival, and
this poetic light heightened the sentiment. What a drama if she turned
out to be the Count's daughter, and in love with me! What a
delightful&mdash;<i>tragedy</i> if she turned out to be the Count's
wife! In this luxurious mood I was accosted by a tall and very
elegantly made gentleman, who appeared to be about fifty. His air was
courtly and graceful, and there was in his whole manner and appearance
something so distinguished that it was impossible not to suspect him of
being a person of rank.</p>

<p>He had been standing upon the steps, looking out, like me, upon the
moonlight effects that transformed, as it were, the objects and
buildings in the little street. He accosted me, I say, with the
politeness, at once easy and lofty, of a French nobleman of the old
school. He asked me if I were not Mr. Beckett? I assented; and he
immediately introduced himself as the Marquis d'Harmonville (this
information he gave me in a low tone), and asked leave to present me
with a letter from Lord R&mdash;&mdash;, who knew my father slightly,
and had once done me, also, a trifling kindness.</p>

<p>This English peer, I may mention, stood very high in the political
world, and was named as the most probable successor to the
distinguished post of English Minister at Paris. I received it with a
low bow, and read:</p>

<p>My Dear Beckett,</p>

<p>I beg to introduce my very dear friend, the Marquis d'Harmonville,
who will explain to you the nature of the services it may be in your
power to render him and us.</p>

<p>He went on to speak of the Marquis as a man whose great wealth,
whose intimate relations with the old families, and whose legitimate
influence with the court rendered him the fittest possible person for
those friendly offices which, at the desire of his own sovereign, and
of our government, he has so obligingly undertaken. It added a great
deal to my perplexity, when I read, further:</p>

<p>By-the-bye, Walton was here yesterday, and told me that your seat
was likely to be attacked; something, he says, is unquestionably going
on at Domwell. You know there is an awkwardness in my meddling ever so
cautiously. But I advise, if it is not very officious, your making
Haxton look after it and report immediately. I fear it is serious. I
ought to have mentioned that, for reasons that you will see, when you
have talked with him for five minutes, the Marquis&mdash;with the
concurrence of all our friends&mdash;drops his title, for a few weeks,
and is at present plain Monsieur Droqville. I am this moment going to
town, and can say no more.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
R&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was utterly puzzled. I could scarcely boast of Lord
R&mdash;&mdash;'s acquaintance. I knew no one named Haxton, and,
except my hatter, no one called Walton; and this peer wrote as if we
were intimate friends! I looked at the back of the letter, and the
mystery was solved. And now, to my consternation&mdash;for I was plain
Richard Beckett&mdash;I read:</p>

<p>"<i>To George Stanhope Beckett, Esq., M.P.</i>"</p>

<p>I looked with consternation in the face of the Marquis.</p>

<p>"What apology can I offer to Monsieur the Mar&mdash;&mdash; to
Monsieur Droqville? It is true my name is Beckett&mdash;it is true I am
known, though very slightly, to Lord R&mdash;&mdash;; but the letter
was not intended for me. My name is Richard Beckett&mdash;this is to
Mr. Stanhope Beckett, the member for Shillingsworth. What can I say, or
do, in this unfortunate situation? I can only give you my honor as a
gentleman, that, for me, the letter, which I now return, shall remain
as unviolated a secret as before I opened it. I am so shocked and
grieved that such a mistake should have occurred!"</p>

<p>I dare say my honest vexation and good faith were pretty legibly
written in my countenance; for the look of gloomy embarrassment which
had for a moment settled on the face of the Marquis, brightened; he
smiled, kindly, and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"I have not the least doubt that Monsieur Beckett will respect my
little secret. As a mistake was destined to occur, I have reason to
thank my good stars that it should have been with a gentleman of honor.
Monsieur Beckett will permit me, I hope, to place his name among those
of my friends?"</p>

<p>I thanked the Marquis very much for his kind expressions. He went on
to say:</p>

<p>"If, Monsieur, I can persuade you to visit me at Claironville, in
Normandy, where I hope to see, on the 15th of August, a great many
friends, whose acquaintance it might interest you to make, I shall be
too happy."</p>

<p>I thanked him, of course, very gratefully for his hospitality. He
continued: "I cannot, for the present, see my friends, for reasons
which you may surmise, at my house in Paris. But Monsieur will be so
good as to let me know the hotel he means to stay at in Paris; and he
will find that although the Marquis d'Harmonville is not in town, that
Monsieur Droqville will not lose sight of him."</p>

<p>With many acknowledgments I gave him, the information he
desired.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," he continued, "if you think of any way in
which Monsieur Droqville can be of use to you, our communication shall
not be interrupted, and I shall so manage matters that you can easily
let me know."</p>

<p>I was very much flattered. The Marquis had, as we say, taken a fancy
to me. Such likings at first sight often ripen into lasting
friendships. To be sure it was just possible that the Marquis might
think it prudent to keep the involuntary depositary of a political
secret, even so vague a one, in good humor.</p>

<p>Very graciously the Marquis took his leave, going up the stairs of
the Belle &Eacute;toile.</p>

<p>I remained upon the steps for a minute, lost in speculation upon
this new theme of interest. But the wonderful eyes, the thrilling
voice, the exquisite figure of the beautiful lady who had taken
possession of my imagination, quickly re-asserted their influence. I
was again gazing at the sympathetic moon, and descending the steps I
loitered along the pavements among strange objects, and houses that
were antique and picturesque, in a dreamy state, thinking.</p>

<p>In a little while I turned into the inn-yard again. There had come a
lull. Instead of the noisy place it was an hour or two before, the yard
was perfectly still and empty, except for the carriages that stood here
and there. Perhaps there was a servants' table-d'h&ocirc;te just then.
I was rather pleased to find solitude; and undisturbed I found out my
lady-love's carriage, in the moonlight. I mused, I walked round it; I
was as utterly foolish and maudlin as very young men, in my situation,
usually are. The blinds were down, the doors, I suppose, locked. The
brilliant moonlight revealed everything, and cast sharp, black shadows
of wheel, and bar, and spring, on the pavement. I stood before the
escutcheon painted on the door, which I had examined in the daylight. I
wondered how often her eyes had rested on the same object. I pondered
in a charming dream. A harsh, loud voice, over my shoulder, said
suddenly: "A red stork&mdash;good! The stork is a bird of prey; it is
vigilant, greedy, and catches gudgeons. Red, too!&mdash;blood red! Ha!
ha! the symbol is appropriate."</p>

<p>I had turned about, and beheld the palest face I ever saw. It was
broad, ugly, and malignant. The figure was that of a French officer, in
undress, and was six feet high. Across the nose and eyebrow there was a
deep scar, which made the repulsive face grimmer.</p>

<p>The officer elevated his chin and his eyebrows, with a scoffing
chuckle, and said: "I have shot a stork, with a rifle bullet, when he
thought himself safe in the clouds, for mere sport!" (He shrugged, and
laughed malignantly.) "See, Monsieur; when a man like me&mdash;a man of
energy, you understand, a man with all his wits about him, a man who
has made the tour of Europe under canvas, and, <i>parbleu</i>! often
without it&mdash; resolves to discover a secret, expose a crime, catch
a thief, spit a robber on the point of his sword, it is odd if he does
not succeed. Ha! ha! ha! Adieu, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>He turned with an angry whisk on his heel, and swaggered with long
strides out of the gate.</p>

<h2><a name="c4-5"></a>Chapter V - SUPPER AT THE BELLE
&Eacute;TOILE</h2>

<p>The French army were in a rather savage temper just then. The
English, especially, had but scant courtesy to expect at their hands.
It was plain, however, that the cadaverous gentleman who had just
apostrophized the heraldry of the Count's carriage, with such
mysterious acrimony, had not intended any of his malevolence for me. He
was stung by some old recollection, and had marched off, seething with
fury.</p>

<p>I had received one of those unacknowledged shocks which startle us,
when, fancying ourselves perfectly alone, we discover on a sudden that
our antics have been watched by a spectator, almost at our elbow. In
this case the effect was enhanced by the extreme repulsiveness of the
face, and, I may add, its proximity, for, as I think, it almost touched
mine. The enigmatical harangue of this person, so full of hatred and
implied denunciation, was still in my ears. Here at all events was new
matter for the industrious fancy of a lover to work upon.</p>

<p>It was time now to go to the table-d'h&ocirc;te. Who could tell what
lights the gossip of the supper-table might throw upon the subject that
interested me so powerfully!</p>

<p>I stepped into the room, my eyes searching the little assembly,
about thirty people, for the persons who specially interested me. It
was not easy to induce people, so hurried and overworked as those of
the Belle &Eacute;toile just now, to send meals up to one's private
apartments, in the midst of this unparalleled confusion; and,
therefore, many people who did not like it might find themselves
reduced to the alternative of supping at the table-d'h&ocirc;te or
starving.</p>

<p>The Count was not there, nor his beautiful companion; but the
Marquis d'Harmonville, whom I hardly expected to see in so public a
place, signed, with a significant smile, to a vacant chair beside
himself. I secured it, and he seemed pleased, and almost immediately
entered into conversation with me.</p>

<p>"This is, probably, your first visit to France?" he said.</p>

<p>I told him it was, and he said:</p>

<p>"You must not think me very curious and impertinent; but Paris is
about the most dangerous capital a high-spirited and generous young
gentleman could visit without a Mentor. If you have not an experienced
friend as a companion during your visit&mdash;." He paused.</p>

<p>I told him I was not so provided, but that I had my wits about me;
that I had seen a good deal of life in England, and that I fancied
human nature was pretty much the same in all parts of the world. The
Marquis shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"You will find very marked differences, notwithstanding," he said.
"Peculiarities of intellect and peculiarities of character,
undoubtedly, do pervade different nations; and this results, among the
criminal classes, in a style of villainy no less peculiar. In Paris the
class who live by their wits is three or four times as great as in
London; and they live much better; some of them even splendidly. They
are more ingenious than the London rogues; they have more animation and
invention, and the dramatic faculty, in which your countrymen are
deficient, is everywhere. These invaluable attributes place them upon a
totally different level. They can affect the manners and enjoy the
luxuries of people of distinction. They live, many of them, by
play."</p>

<p>"So do many of our London rogues."</p>

<p>"Yes, but in a totally different way. They are the
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of certain gaming-tables, billiard-rooms, and
other places, including your races, where high play goes on; and by
superior knowledge of chances, by masking their play, by means of
confederates, by means of bribery, and other artifices, varying with
the subject of their imposture, they rob the unwary. But here it is
more elaborately done, and with a really exquisite <i>finesse</i>.
There are people whose manners, style, conversation, are
unexceptionable, living in handsome houses in the best situations, with
everything about them in the most refined taste, and exquisitely
luxurious, who impose even upon the Parisian bourgeois, who believe
them to be, in good faith, people of rank and fashion, because their
habits are expensive and refined, and their houses are frequented by
foreigners of distinction, and, to a degree, by foolish young Frenchmen
of rank. At all these houses play goes on. The ostensible host and
hostess seldom join in it; they provide it simply to plunder their
guests, by means of their accomplices, and thus wealthy strangers are
inveigled and robbed."</p>

<p>"But I have heard of a young Englishman, a son of Lord Rooksbury,
who broke two Parisian gaming tables only last year."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, laughing, "you are come here to do likewise. I,
myself, at about your age, undertook the same spirited enterprise. I
raised no less a sum than five hundred thousand francs to begin with; I
expected to carry all before me by the simple expedient of going on
doubling my stakes. I had heard of it, and I fancied that the sharpers,
who kept the table, knew nothing of the matter. I found, however, that
they not only knew all about it, but had provided against the
possibility of any such experiments; and I was pulled up before I had
well begun by a rule which forbids the doubling of an original stake
more than four times consecutively."</p>

<p>"And is that rule in force still?" I inquired, chapfallen.</p>

<p>He laughed and shrugged, "Of course it is, my young friend. People
who live by an art always understand it better than an amateur. I see
you had formed the same plan, and no doubt came provided."</p>

<p>I confessed I had prepared for conquest upon a still grander scale.
I had arrived with a purse of thirty thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>"Any acquaintance of my very dear friend, Lord R&mdash;&mdash;,
interests me; and, besides my regard for him, I am charmed with you; so
you will pardon all my, perhaps, too officious questions and
advice."</p>

<p>I thanked him most earnestly for his valuable counsel, and begged
that he would have the goodness to give me all the advice in his
power.</p>

<p>"Then if you take my advice," said he, "you will leave your money in
the bank where it lies. Never risk a Napoleon in a gaming house. The
night I went to break the bank I lost between seven and eight thousand
pounds sterling of your English money; and my next adventure, I had
obtained an introduction to one of those elegant gaming-houses which
affect to be the private mansions of persons of distinction, and was
saved from ruin by a gentleman whom, ever since, I have regarded with
increasing respect and friendship. It oddly happens he is in this house
at this moment. I recognized his servant, and made him a visit in his
apartments here, and found him the same brave, kind, honorable man I
always knew him. But that he is living so entirely out of the world,
now, I should have made a point of introducing you. Fifteen years ago
he would have been the man of all others to consult. The gentleman I
speak of is the Comte de St. Alyre. He represents a very old family. He
is the very soul of honor, and the most sensible man in the world,
except in one particular."</p>

<p>"And that particular?" I hesitated. I was now deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Is that he has married a charming creature, at least five-and-forty
years younger than himself, and is, of course, although I believe
absolutely without cause, horribly jealous."</p>

<p>"And the lady?"</p>

<p>"The Countess is, I believe, in every way worthy of so good a man,"
he answered, a little dryly. "I think I heard her sing this
evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay; she is very accomplished." After a few moments'
silence he continued.</p>

<p>"I must not lose sight of you, for I should be sorry, when next you
meet my friend Lord R&mdash;&mdash;, that you had to tell him you had
been pigeoned in Paris. A rich Englishman as you are, with so large a
sum at his Paris bankers, young, gay, generous, a thousand ghouls and
harpies will be contending who shall be the first to seize and devour
you."</p>

<p>At this moment I received something like a jerk from the elbow of
the gentleman at my right. It was an accidental jog, as he turned in
his seat.</p>

<p>"On the honor of a soldier, there is no man's flesh in this company
heals so fast as mine."</p>

<p>The tone in which this was spoken was harsh and stentorian, and
almost made me bounce. I looked round and recognized the officer whose
large white face had half scared me in the inn-yard, wiping his mouth
furiously, and then with a gulp of Magon, he went on:</p>

<p>"No one! It's not blood; it is ichor! it's miracle! Set aside
stature, thew, bone, and muscle&mdash;set aside courage, and by all the
angels of death, I'd fight a lion naked, and dash his teeth down his
jaws with my fist, and flog him to death with his own tail! Set aside,
I say, all those attributes, which I am allowed to possess, and I am
worth six men in any campaign, for that one quality of healing as I
do&mdash;rip me up, punch me through, tear me to tatters with
bomb-shells, and nature has me whole again, while your tailor would
fine&mdash;draw an old coat. <i>Parbleu</i>! gentlemen, if you saw me
naked, you would laugh! Look at my hand, a saber-cut across the palm,
to the bone, to save my head, taken up with three stitches, and five
days afterwards I was playing ball with an English general, a prisoner
in Madrid, against the wall of the convent of the Santa Maria de la
Castita! At Arcola, by the great devil himself! that was an action.
Every man there, gentlemen, swallowed as much smoke in five minutes as
would smother you all in this room! I received, at the same moment, two
musket balls in the thighs, a grape shot through the calf of my leg, a
lance through my left shoulder, a piece of a shrapnel in the left
deltoid, a bayonet through the cartilage of my right ribs, a cut-cut
that carried away a pound of flesh from my chest, and the better part
of a congreve rocket on my forehead. Pretty well, ha, ha! and all while
you'd say bah! and in eight days and a half I was making a forced
march, without shoes, and only one gaiter, the life and soul of my
company, and as sound as a roach!"</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravissimo! Per Bacco! un gallant' uomo!" exclaimed, in a
martial ecstasy, a fat little Italian, who manufactured toothpicks and
wicker cradles on the island of Notre Dame; "your exploits shall
resound through Europe! and the history of those wars should be written
in your blood!"</p>

<p>"Never mind! a trifle!" exclaimed the soldier. "At Ligny, the other
day, where we smashed the Prussians into ten hundred thousand milliards
of atoms, a bit of a shell cut me across the leg and opened an artery.
It was spouting as high as the chimney, and in half a minute I had lost
enough to fill a pitcher. I must have expired in another minute, if I
had not whipped off my sash like a flash of lightning, tied it round my
leg above the wound, whipt a bayonet out of the back of a dead
Prussian, and passing it under, made a tourniquet of it with a couple
of twists, and so stayed the haemorrhage and saved my life. But,
<i>sacrebleu</i>! gentlemen, I lost so much blood, I have been as pale
as the bottom of a plate ever since. No matter. A trifle. Blood well
spent, gentlemen." He applied himself now to his bottle of <i>vin
ordinaire</i>.</p>

<p>The Marquis had closed his eyes, and looked resigned and disgusted,
while all this was going on.</p>

<p>"<i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>," said the officer, for the first time
speaking in a low tone over the back of his chair to the waiter; "who
came in that traveling carriage, dark yellow and black, that stands in
the middle of the yard, with arms and supporters emblazoned on the
door, and a red stork, as red as my facings?"</p>

<p>The waiter could not say.</p>

<p>The eye of the eccentric officer, who had suddenly grown grim and
serious, and seemed to have abandoned the general conversation to other
people, lighted, as it were accidentally, on me.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Monsieur," he said. "Did I not see you examining the
panel of that carriage at the same time that I did so, this evening?
Can you tell me who arrived in it?"</p>

<p>"I rather think the Count and Countess de St. Alyre."</p>

<p>"And are they here, in the Belle &Eacute;toile?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They have got apartments upstairs," I answered.</p>

<p>He started up, and half pushed his chair from the table. He quickly
sat down again, and I could hear him <i>sacr&eacute;</i>-ing and
muttering to himself, and grinning and scowling. I could not tell
whether he was alarmed or furious.</p>

<p>I turned to say a word or two to the Marquis, but he was gone.
Several other people had dropped out also, and the supper party soon
broke up. Two or three substantial pieces of wood smoldered on the
hearth, for the night had turned out chilly. I sat down by the fire in
a great armchair of carved oak, with a marvelously high back that
looked as old as the days of Henry IV.</p>

<p>"<i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>," said I, "do you happen to know who that
officer is?"</p>

<p>"That is Colonel Gaillarde, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Has he been often here?"</p>

<p>"Once before, Monsieur, for a week; it is a year since."</p>

<p>"He is the palest man I ever saw."</p>

<p>"That is true, Monsieur; he has been often taken for a
<i>revenant</i>."</p>

<p>"Can you give me a bottle of really good Burgundy?"</p>

<p>"The best in France, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Place it, and a glass by my side, on this table, if you please. I
may sit here for half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Monsieur."</p>

<p>I was very comfortable, the wine excellent, and my thoughts glowing
and serene. "Beautiful Countess! Beautiful Countess! shall we ever be
better acquainted?"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-6"></a>Chapter VI - THE NAKED SWORD</h2>

<p>A man who has been posting all day long, and changing the air he
breathes every half hour, who is well pleased with himself, and has
nothing on earth to trouble him, and who sits alone by a fire in a
comfortable chair after having eaten a hearty supper, may be pardoned
if he takes an accidental nap.</p>

<p>I had filled my fourth glass when I fell asleep. My head, I daresay,
hung uncomfortably; and it is admitted that a variety of French dishes
is not the most favorable precursor to pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>I had a dream as I took mine ease in mine inn on this occasion. I
fancied myself in a huge cathedral, without light, except from four
tapers that stood at the corners of a raised platform hung with black,
on which lay, draped also in black, what seemed to me the dead body of
the Countess de St. Alyre. The place seemed empty, it was cold, and I
could see only (in the halo of the candles) a little way round.</p>

<p>The little I saw bore the character of Gothic gloom, and helped my
fancy to shape and furnish the black void that yawned all round me. I
heard a sound like the slow tread of two persons walking up the flagged
aisle. A faint echo told of the vastness of the place. An awful sense
of expectation was upon me, and I was horribly frightened when the body
that lay on the catafalque said (without stirring), in a whisper that
froze me, "They come to place me in the grave alive; save me."</p>

<p>I found that I could neither speak nor move. I was horribly
frightened.</p>

<p>The two people who approached now emerged from the darkness. One,
the Count de St. Alyre, glided to the head of the figure and placed his
long thin hands under it. The white-faced Colonel, with the scar across
his face, and a look of infernal triumph, placed his hands under her
feet, and they began to raise her.</p>

<p>With an indescribable effort I broke the spell that bound me, and
started to my feet with a gasp.</p>

<p>I was wide awake, but the broad, wicked face of Colonel Gaillarde
was staring, white as death, at me from the other side of the hearth.
"Where is she?" I shuddered.</p>

<p>"That depends on who she is, Monsieur," replied the Colonel,
curtly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I gasped, looking about me.</p>

<p>The Colonel, who was eyeing me sarcastically, had had his
<i>demitasse</i> of <i>caf&eacute; noir</i>, and now drank his
<i>tasse</i>, diffusing a pleasant perfume of brandy.</p>

<p>"I fell asleep and was dreaming," I said, lest any strong language,
founded on the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> he played in my dream, should have
escaped me. "I did not know for some moments where I was."</p>

<p>"You are the young gentleman who has the apartments over the Count
and Countess de St. Alyre?" he said, winking one eye, close in
meditation, and glaring at me with the other.</p>

<p>"I believe so&mdash;yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"Well, younker, take care you have not worse dreams than that some
night," he said, enigmatically, and wagged his head with a chuckle.
"Worse dreams," he repeated.</p>

<p>"What does Monsieur the Colonel mean?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I am trying to find that out myself," said the Colonel; "and I
think I shall. When <i>I</i> get the first inch of the thread fast
between my finger and thumb, it goes hard but I follow it up, bit by
bit, little by little, tracing it this way and that, and up and down,
and round about, until the whole clue is wound up on my thumb, and the
end, and its secret, fast in my fingers. Ingenious! Crafty as five
foxes! wide awake as a weasel! <i>Parbleu</i>! if I had descended to
that occupation I should have made my fortune as a spy. Good wine
here?" he glanced interrogatively at my bottle.</p>

<p>"Very good," said I. "Will Monsieur the Colonel try a glass?"</p>

<p>He took the largest he could find, and filled it, raised it with a
bow, and drank it slowly. "Ah! ah! Bah! That is not it," he exclaimed,
with some disgust, filling it again. "You ought to have told <i>me</i>
to order your Burgundy, and they would not have brought you that
stuff."</p>

<p>I got away from this man as soon as I civilly could, and, putting on
my hat, I walked out with no other company than my sturdy
walking-stick. I visited the inn-yard, and looked up to the windows of
the Countess's apartments. They were closed, however, and I had not
even the unsubstantial consolation of contemplating the light in which
that beautiful lady was at that moment writing, or reading, or sitting
and thinking of&mdash;anyone you please.</p>

<p>I bore this serious privation as well as I could, and took a little
saunter through the town. I shan't bore you with moonlight effects, nor
with the maunderings of a man who has fallen in love at first sight
with a beautiful face. My ramble, it is enough to say, occupied about
half an hour, and, returning by a slight d&eacute;tour, I found myself
in a little square, with about two high gabled houses on each side, and
a rude stone statue, worn by centuries of rain, on a pedestal in the
center of the pavement. Looking at this statue was a slight and rather
tall man, whom I instantly recognized as the Marquis d'Harmonville: he
knew me almost as quickly. He walked a step towards me, shrugged and
laughed:</p>

<p>"You are surprised to find Monsieur Droqville staring at that old
stone figure by moonlight. Anything to pass the time. You, I see,
suffer from <i>ennui</i>, as I do. These little provincial towns!
Heavens! what an effort it is to live in them! If I could regret having
formed in early life a friendship that does me honor, I think its
condemning me to a sojourn in such a place would make me do so. You go
on towards Paris, I suppose, in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I have ordered horses."</p>

<p>"As for me I await a letter, or an arrival, either would emancipate
me; but I can't say how soon either event will happen."</p>

<p>"Can I be of any use in this matter?" I began.</p>

<p>"None, Monsieur, I thank you a thousand times. No, this is a piece
in which every <i>r&ocirc;le</i> is already cast. I am but an amateur,
and induced solely by friendship, to take a part."</p>

<p>So he talked on, for a time, as we walked slowly toward the Belle
&Eacute;toile, and then came a silence, which I broke by asking him if
he knew anything of Colonel Gaillarde.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, to be sure. He is a little mad; he has had some bad
injuries of the head. He used to plague the people in the War Office to
death. He has always some delusion. They contrived some employment for
him&mdash;not regimental, of course&mdash;but in this campaign
Napoleon, who could spare nobody, placed him in command of a regiment.
He was always a desperate fighter, and such men were more than ever
needed."</p>

<p>There is, or was, a second inn in this town called l'&Eacute;cu de
France. At its door the Marquis stopped, bade me a mysterious
good-night, and disappeared.</p>

<p>As I walked slowly toward my inn, I met, in the shadow of a row of
poplars, the gar&ccedil;on who had brought me my Burgundy a little time
ago. I was thinking of Colonel Gaillarde, and I stopped the little
waiter as he passed me.</p>

<p>"You said, I think, that Colonel Gaillarde was at the Belle
&Eacute;toile for a week at one time."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Is he perfectly in his right mind?"</p>

<p>The waiter stared. "Perfectly, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Has he been suspected at any time of being out of his mind?"</p>

<p>"Never, Monsieur; he is a little noisy, but a very shrewd man."</p>

<p>"What is a fellow to think?" I muttered, as I walked on.</p>

<p>I was soon within sight of the lights of the Belle &Eacute;toile. A
carriage, with four horses, stood in the moonlight at the door, and a
furious altercation was going on in the hall, in which the yell of
Colonel Gaillarde out-topped all other sounds.</p>

<p>Most young men like, at least, to witness a row. But, intuitively, I
felt that this would interest me in a very special manner. I had only
fifty yards to run, when I found myself in the hall of the old inn. The
principal actor in this strange drama was, indeed, the Colonel, who
stood facing the old Count de St. Alyre, who, in his traveling costume,
with his black silk scarf covering the lower part of his face,
confronted him; he had evidently been intercepted in an endeavor to
reach his carriage. A little in the rear of the Count stood the
Countess, also in traveling costume, with her thick black veil down,
and holding in her delicate fingers a white rose. You can't conceive a
more diabolical effigy of hate and fury than the Colonel; the knotted
veins stood out on his forehead, his eyes were leaping from their
sockets, he was grinding his teeth, and froth was on his lips. His
sword was drawn in his hand, and he accompanied his yelling
denunciations with stamps upon the floor and flourishes of his weapon
in the air.</p>

<p>The host of the Belle &Eacute;toile was talking to the Colonel in
soothing terms utterly thrown away. Two waiters, pale with fear, stared
uselessly from behind. The Colonel screamed and thundered, and whirled
his sword. "I was not sure of your red birds of prey; I could not
believe you would have the audacity to travel on high roads, and to
stop at honest inns, and lie under the same roof with honest men. You!
<i>you! both</i>&mdash;vampires, wolves, ghouls. Summon the
<i>gendarmes</i>, I say. By St. Peter and all the devils, if either of
you try to get out of that door I'll take your heads off."</p>

<p>For a moment I had stood aghast. Here was a situation! I walked up
to the lady; she laid her hand wildly upon my arm. "Oh! Monsieur," she
whispered, in great agitation, "that dreadful madman! What are we to
do? He won't let us pass; he will kill my husband."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, Madame," I answered, with romantic devotion, and
stepping between the Count and Gaillarde, as he shrieked his invective,
"Hold your tongue, and clear the way, you ruffian, you bully, you
coward!" I roared.</p>

<p>A faint cry escaped the lady, which more than repaid the risk I ran,
as the sword of the frantic soldier, after a moment's astonished pause,
flashed in the air to cut me down.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-7"></a>Chapter VII - THE WHITE ROSE</h2>

<p>I was too quick for Colonel Gaillarde. As he raised his sword,
reckless of all consequences but my condign punishment and quite
resolved to cleave me to the teeth, I struck him across the side of his
head with my heavy stick, and while he staggered back I struck him
another blow, nearly in the same place, that felled him to the floor,
where he lay as if dead.</p>

<p>I did not care one of his own regimental buttons, whether he was
dead or not; I was, at that moment, carried away by such a tumult of
delightful and diabolical emotions!</p>

<p>I broke his sword under my foot, and flung the pieces across the
street. The old Count de St. Alyre skipped nimbly without looking to
the right or left, or thanking anybody, over the floor, out of the
door, down the steps, and into his carriage. Instantly I was at the
side of the beautiful Countess, thus left to shift for herself; I
offered her my arm, which she took, and I led her to the carriage. She
entered, and I shut the door. All this without a word.</p>

<p>I was about to ask if there were any commands with which she would
honor me&mdash;my hand was laid upon the lower edge of the window,
which was open.</p>

<p>The lady's hand was laid upon mine timidly and excitedly. Her lips
almost touched my cheek as she whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I may never see you more, and, oh! that I could forget you.
Go&mdash;farewell&mdash;for God's sake, go!"</p>

<p>I pressed her hand for a moment. She withdrew it, but tremblingly
pressed into mine the rose which she had held in her fingers during the
agitating scene she had just passed through.</p>

<p>All this took place while the Count was commanding, entreating,
cursing his servants, tipsy, and out of the way during the crisis, my
conscience afterwards insinuated, by my clever contrivance. They now
mounted to their places with the agility of alarm. The postilions'
whips cracked, the horses scrambled into a trot, and away rolled the
carriage, with its precious freightage, along the quaint main street,
in the moonlight, toward Paris.</p>

<p>I stood on the pavement till it was quite lost to eye and ear in the
distance.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh, I then turned, my white rose folded in my
handkerchief&mdash;the little parting <i>gage</i>&mdash;the</p>

<p>Favor secret, sweet, and precious,<br>
which no mortal eye but hers and mine had seen conveyed to me.</p>

<p>The care of the host of the Belle &Eacute;toile, and his assistants,
had raised the wounded hero of a hundred fights partly against the
wall, and propped him at each side with portmanteaus and pillows, and
poured a glass of brandy, which was duly placed to his account, into
his big mouth, where, for the first time, such a godsend remained
unswallowed.</p>

<p>A bald-headed little military surgeon of sixty, with spectacles, who
had cut off eighty-seven legs and arms to his own share, after the
battle of Eylau, having retired with his sword and his saw, his laurels
and his sticking-plaster to this, his native town, was called in, and
rather thought the gallant Colonel's skull was fractured; at all
events, there was concussion of the seat of thought, and quite enough
work for his remarkable self-healing powers to occupy him for a
fortnight.</p>

<p>I began to grow a little uneasy. A disagreeable surprise, if my
excursion, in which I was to break banks and hearts, and, as you see,
heads, should end upon the gallows or the guillotine. I was not clear,
in those times of political oscillation, which was the established
apparatus.</p>

<p>The Colonel was conveyed, snorting apoplectically, to his room.</p>

<p>I saw my host in the apartment in which we had supped. Wherever you
employ a force of any sort, to carry a point of real importance, reject
all nice calculations of economy. Better to be a thousand per cent,
over the mark, than the smallest fraction of a unit under it. I
instinctively felt this.</p>

<p>I ordered a bottle of my landlord's very best wine; made him partake
with me, in the proportion of two glasses to one; and then told him
that he must not decline a trifling <i>souvenir</i> from a guest who
had been so charmed with all he had seen of the renowned Belle
&Eacute;toile. Thus saying, I placed five-and-thirty Napoleons in his
hand: at touch of which his countenance, by no means encouraging
before, grew sunny, his manners thawed, and it was plain, as he dropped
the coins hastily into his pocket, that benevolent relations had been
established between us.</p>

<p>I immediately placed the Colonel's broken head upon the
<i>tapis</i>. We both agreed that if I had not given him that rather
smart tap of my walking-cane, he would have beheaded half the inmates
of the Belle &Eacute;toile. There was not a waiter in the house who
would not verify that statement on oath.</p>

<p>The reader may suppose that I had other motives, beside the desire
to escape the tedious inquisition of the law, for desiring to
recommence my journey to Paris with the least possible delay. Judge
what was my horror then to learn that, for love or money, horses were
nowhere to be had that night. The last pair in the town had been
obtained from the &Eacute;cu de France by a gentleman who dined and
supped at the Belle &Eacute;toile, and was obliged to proceed to Paris
that night.</p>

<p>Who was the gentleman? Had he actually gone? Could he possibly be
induced to wait till morning?</p>

<p>The gentleman was now upstairs getting his things together, and his
name was Monsieur Droqville.</p>

<p>I ran upstairs. I found my servant St. Clair in my room. At sight of
him, for a moment, my thoughts were turned into a different
channel.</p>

<p>"Well, St. Clair, tell me this moment who the lady is?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"The lady is the daughter or wife, it matters not which, of the
Count de St. Alyre&mdash;the old gentleman who was so near being sliced
like a cucumber tonight, I am informed, by the sword of the general
whom Monsieur, by a turn of fortune, has put to bed of an
apoplexy."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, fool! The man's beastly drunk&mdash;he's
sulking&mdash;he could talk if he liked&mdash;who cares? Pack up my
things. Which are Monsieur Droqville's apartments?"</p>

<p>He knew, of course; he always knew everything.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Monsieur Droqville and I were traveling towards
Paris in my carriage and with his horses. I ventured to ask the Marquis
d'Harmonville, in a little while, whether the lady, who accompanied the
Count, was certainly the Countess. "Has he not a daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I believe a very beautiful and charming young lady&mdash;I
cannot say&mdash;it may have been she, his daughter by an earlier
marriage. I saw only the Count himself today."</p>

<p>The Marquis was growing a little sleepy, and, in a little while, he
actually fell asleep in his corner. I dozed and nodded; but the Marquis
slept like a top. He awoke only for a minute or two at the next
posting-house where he had fortunately secured horses by sending on his
man, he told me. "You will excuse my being so dull a companion," he
said, "but till tonight I have had but two hours' sleep, for more than
sixty hours. I shall have a cup of coffee here; I have had my nap.
Permit me to recommend you to do likewise. Their coffee is really
excellent." He ordered two cups of <i>caf&eacute; noir</i>, and waited,
with his head from the window. "We will keep the cups," he said, as he
received them from the waiter, "and the tray. Thank you."</p>

<p>There was a little delay as he paid for these things; and then he
took in the little tray, and handed me a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I declined the tray; so he placed it on his own knees, to act as a
miniature table.</p>

<p>"I can't endure being waited for and hurried," he said, "I like to
sip my coffee at leisure."</p>

<p>I agreed. It really <i>was</i> the very perfection of coffee.</p>

<p>"I, like Monsieur le Marquis, have slept very little for the last
two or three nights; and find it difficult to keep awake. This coffee
will do wonders for me; it refreshes one so."</p>

<p>Before we had half done, the carriage was again in motion.</p>

<p>For a time our coffee made us chatty, and our conversation was
animated.</p>

<p>The Marquis was extremely good-natured, as well as clever, and gave
me a brilliant and amusing account of Parisian life, schemes, and
dangers, all put so as to furnish me with practical warnings of the
most valuable kind.</p>

<p>In spite of the amusing and curious stories which the Marquis
related with so much point and color, I felt myself again becoming
gradually drowsy and dreamy.</p>

<p>Perceiving this, no doubt, the Marquis good-naturedly suffered our
conversation to subside into silence. The window next him was open. He
threw his cup out of it; and did the same kind office for mine, and
finally the little tray flew after, and I heard it clank on the road; a
valuable waif, no doubt, for some early wayfarer in wooden shoes.</p>

<p>I leaned back in my corner; I had my beloved souvenir&mdash;my white
rose&mdash;close to my heart, folded, now, in white paper. It inspired
all manner of romantic dreams. I began to grow more and more sleepy.
But actual slumber did not come. I was still viewing, with my
half-closed eyes, from my corner, diagonally, the interior of the
carriage.</p>

<p>I wished for sleep; but the barrier between waking and sleeping
seemed absolutely insurmountable; and, instead, I entered into a state
of novel and indescribable indolence.</p>

<p>The Marquis lifted his dispatch-box from the floor, placed it on his
knees, unlocked it, and took out what proved to be a lamp, which he
hung with two hooks, attached to it, to the window opposite to him. He
lighted it with a match, put on his spectacles, and taking out a bundle
of letters began to read them carefully.</p>

<p>We were making way very slowly. My impatience had hitherto employed
four horses from stage to stage. We were in this emergency, only too
happy to have secured two. But the difference in pace was
depressing.</p>

<p>I grew tired of the monotony of seeing the spectacled Marquis
reading, folding, and docketing, letter after letter. I wished to shut
out the image which wearied me, but something prevented my being able
to shut my eyes. I tried again and again; but, positively, I had lost
the power of closing them.</p>

<p>I would have rubbed my eyes, but I could not stir my hand, my will
no longer acted on my body&mdash;I found that I could not move one
joint, or muscle, no more than I could, by an effort of my will, have
turned the carriage about.</p>

<p>Up to this I had experienced no sense of horror. Whatever it was,
simple night-mare was not the cause. I was awfully frightened! Was I in
a fit?</p>

<p>It was horrible to see my good-natured companion pursue his
occupation so serenely, when he might have dissipated my horrors by a
single shake.</p>

<p>I made a stupendous exertion to call out, but in vain; I repeated
the effort again and again, with no result.</p>

<p>My companion now tied up his letters, and looked out of the window,
humming an air from an opera. He drew back his head, and said, turning
to me:</p>

<p>"Yes, I see the lights; we shall be there in two or three
minutes."</p>

<p>He looked more closely at me, and with a kind smile, and a little
shrug, he said, "Poor child! how fatigued he must have been&mdash;how
profoundly he sleeps! when the carriage stops he will waken."</p>

<p>He then replaced his letters in the dispatch-box, locked it, put his
spectacles in his pocket, and again looked out of the window.</p>

<p>We had entered a little town. I suppose it was past two o'clock by
this time. The carriage drew up, I saw an inn-door open, and a light
issuing from it.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said my companion, turning gaily to me. But I did not
awake.</p>

<p>"Yes, how tired he must have been!" he exclaimed, after he had
waited for an answer. My servant was at the carriage door, and opened
it.</p>

<p>"Your master sleeps soundly, he is so fatigued! It would be cruel to
disturb him. You and I will go in, while they change the horses, and
take some refreshment, and choose something that Monsieur Beckett will
like to take in the carriage, for when he awakes by-and-by, he will, I
am sure, be hungry."</p>

<p>He trimmed his lamp, poured in some oil; and taking care not to
disturb me, with another kind smile and another word of caution to my
servant he got out, and I heard him talking to St. Clair, as they
entered the inn-door, and I was left in my corner, in the carriage, in
the same state.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-8"></a>Chapter VIII - A THREE MINUTES' VISIT</h2>

<p>I have suffered extreme and protracted bodily pain, at different
periods of my life, but anything like that misery, thank God, I never
endured before or since. I earnestly hope it may not resemble any type
of death to which we are liable. I was, indeed, a spirit in prison; and
unspeakable was my dumb and unmoving agony.</p>

<p>The power of thought remained clear and active. Dull terror filled
my mind. How would this end? Was it actual death?</p>

<p>You will understand that my faculty of observing was unimpaired. I
could hear and see anything as distinctly as ever I did in my life. It
was simply that my will had, as it were, lost its hold of my body.</p>

<p>I told you that the Marquis d'Harmonville had not extinguished his
carriage lamp on going into this village inn. I was listening intently,
longing for his return, which might result, by some lucky accident, in
awaking me from my catalepsy.</p>

<p>Without any sound of steps approaching, to announce an arrival, the
carriage-door suddenly opened, and a total stranger got in silently and
shut the door.</p>

<p>The lamp gave about as strong a light as a wax-candle, so I could
see the intruder perfectly. He was a young man, with a dark grey loose
surtout, made with a sort of hood, which was pulled over his head. I
thought, as he moved, that I saw the gold band of a military undress
cap under it; and I certainly saw the lace and buttons of a uniform, on
the cuffs of the coat that were visible under the wide sleeves of his
outside wrapper.</p>

<p>This young man had thick moustaches and an imperial, and I observed
that he had a red scar running upward from his lip across his
cheek.</p>

<p>He entered, shut the door softly, and sat down beside me. It was all
done in a moment; leaning toward me, and shading his eyes with his
gloved hand, he examined my face closely for a few seconds.</p>

<p>This man had come as noiselessly as a ghost; and everything he did
was accomplished with the rapidity and decision that indicated a
well-defined and pre-arranged plan. His designs were evidently
sinister. I thought he was going to rob and, perhaps, murder me. I lay,
nevertheless, like a corpse under his hands. He inserted his hand in my
breast pocket, from which he took my precious white rose and all the
letters it contained, among which was a paper of some consequence to
me.</p>

<p>My letters he glanced at. They were plainly not what he wanted. My
precious rose, too, he laid aside with them. It was evidently about the
paper I have mentioned that he was concerned; for the moment he opened
it he began with a pencil, in a small pocket-book, to make rapid notes
of its contents.</p>

<p>This man seemed to glide through his work with a noiseless and cool
celerity which argued, I thought, the training of the police
department.</p>

<p>He re-arranged the papers, possibly in the very order in which he
had found them, replaced them in my breast-pocket, and was gone. His
visit, I think, did not quite last three minutes. Very soon after his
disappearance I heard the voice of the Marquis once more. He got in,
and I saw him look at me and smile, half-envying me, I fancied, my
sound repose. If he had but known all!</p>

<p>He resumed his reading and docketing by the light of the little lamp
which had just subserved the purposes of a spy.</p>

<p>We were now out of the town, pursuing our journey at the same
moderate pace. We had left the scene of my police visit, as I should
have termed it, now two leagues behind us, when I suddenly felt a
strange throbbing in one ear, and a sensation as if air passed through
it into my throat. It seemed as if a bubble of air, formed deep in my
ear, swelled, and burst there. The indescribable tension of my brain
seemed all at once to give way; there was an odd humming in my head,
and a sort of vibration through every nerve of my body, such as I have
experienced in a limb that has been, in popular phraseology, asleep. I
uttered a cry and half rose from my seat, and then fell back trembling,
and with a sense of mortal faintness.</p>

<p>The Marquis stared at me, took my hand, and earnestly asked if I was
ill. I could answer only with a deep groan.</p>

<p>Gradually the process of restoration was completed; and I was able,
though very faintly, to tell him how very ill I had been; and then to
describe the violation of my letters, during the time of his absence
from the carriage.</p>

<p>"Good heaven!" he exclaimed, "the miscreant did not get at my
dispatch-box?"</p>

<p>I satisfied him, so far as I had observed, on that point. He placed
the box on the seat beside him, and opened and examined its contents
very minutely.</p>

<p>"Yes, undisturbed; all safe, thank heaven!" he murmured. "There are
half-a-dozen letters here that I would not have some people read for a
great deal."</p>

<p>He now asked with a very kind anxiety all about the illness I
complained of. When he had heard me, he said:</p>

<p>"A friend of mine once had an attack as like yours as possible. It
was on board ship, and followed a state of high excitement. He was a
brave man like you; and was called on to exert both his strength and
his courage suddenly. An hour or two after, fatigue overpowered him,
and he appeared to fall into a sound sleep. He really sank into a state
which he afterwards described so that I think it must have been
precisely the same affection as yours."</p>

<p>"I am happy to think that my attack was not unique. Did he ever
experience a return of it?"</p>

<p>"I knew him for years after, and never heard of any such thing. What
strikes me is a parallel in the predisposing causes of each attack.
Your unexpected and gallant hand-to-hand encounter, at such desperate
odds, with an experienced swordsman, like that insane colonel of
dragoons, your fatigue, and, finally, your composing yourself, as my
other friend did, to sleep."</p>

<p>"I wish," he resumed, "one could make out who the <i>coquin</i> was
who examined your letters. It is not worth turning back, however,
because we should learn nothing. Those people always manage so
adroitly. I am satisfied, however, that he must have been an agent of
the police. A rogue of any other kind would have robbed you."</p>

<p>I talked very little, being ill and exhausted, but the Marquis
talked on agreeably.</p>

<p>"We grow so intimate," said he, at last, "that I must remind you
that I am not, for the present, the Marquis d'Harmonville, but only
Monsieur Droqville; nevertheless, when we get to Paris, although I
cannot see you often I may be of use. I shall ask you to name to me the
hotel at which you mean to put up; because the Marquis being, as you
are aware, on his travels, the Hotel d'Harmonville is, for the present,
tenanted only by two or three old servants, who must not even see
Monsieur Droqville. That gentleman will, nevertheless, contrive to get
you access to the box of Monsieur le Marquis, at the Opera, as well,
possibly, as to other places more difficult; and so soon as the
diplomatic office of the Marquis d'Harmonville is ended, and he at
liberty to declare himself, he will not excuse his friend, Monsieur
Beckett, from fulfilling his promise to visit him this autumn at the
Ch&acirc;teau d'Harmonville."</p>

<p>You may be sure I thanked the Marquis.</p>

<p>The nearer we got to Paris, the more I valued his protection. The
countenance of a great man on the spot, just then, taking so kind an
interest in the stranger whom he had, as it were, blundered upon, might
make my visit ever so many degrees more delightful than I had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more gracious than the manner and looks of the
Marquis; and, as I still thanked him, the carriage suddenly stopped in
front of the place where a relay of horses awaited us, and where, as it
turned out, we were to part.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-9"></a>Chapter IX - GOSSIP AND COUNSEL</h2>

<p>My eventful journey was over at last. I sat in my hotel window
looking out upon brilliant Paris, which had, in a moment, recovered all
its gaiety, and more than its accustomed bustle. Everyone had read of
the kind of excitement that followed the catastrophe of Napoleon, and
the second restoration of the Bourbons. I need not, therefore, even if,
at this distance, I could, recall and describe my experiences and
impressions of the peculiar aspect of Paris, in those strange times. It
was, to be sure, my first visit. But often as I have seen it since, I
don't think I ever saw that delightful capital in a state, pleasurably
so excited and exciting.</p>

<p>I had been two days in Paris, and had seen all sorts of sights, and
experienced none of that rudeness and insolence of which others
complained from the exasperated officers of the defeated French
army.</p>

<p>I must say this, also. My romance had taken complete possession of
me; and the chance of seeing the object of my dream gave a secret and
delightful interest to my rambles and drives in the streets and
environs, and my visits to the galleries and other sights of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>I had neither seen nor heard of Count or Countess, nor had the
Marquis d'Harmonville made any sign. I had quite recovered the strange
indisposition under which I had suffered during my night journey.</p>

<p>It was now evening, and I was beginning to fear that my patrician
acquaintance had quite forgotten me, when the waiter presented me the
card of "Monsieur Droqville"; and, with no small elation and hurry, I
desired him to show the gentleman up.</p>

<p>In came the Marquis d'Harmonville, kind and gracious as ever.</p>

<p>"I am a night-bird at present," said he, so soon as we had exchanged
the little speeches which are usual. "I keep in the shade during the
daytime, and even now I hardly ventured to come in a close carriage.
The friends for whom I have undertaken a rather critical service, have
so ordained it. They think all is lost if I am known to be in Paris.
First, let me present you with these orders for my box. I am so vexed
that I cannot command it oftener during the next fortnight; during my
absence I had directed my secretary to give it for any night to the
first of my friends who might apply, and the result is, that I find
next to nothing left at my disposal."</p>

<p>I thanked him very much.</p>

<p>"And now a word in my office of Mentor. You have not come here, of
course, without introductions?"</p>

<p>I produced half-a-dozen letters, the addresses of which he looked
at.</p>

<p>"Don't mind these letters," he said. "I will introduce you. I will
take you myself from house to house. One friend at your side is worth
many letters. Make no intimacies, no acquaintances, until then. You
young men like best to exhaust the public amusements of a great city,
before embarrassing yourselves with the engagements of society. Go to
all these. It will occupy you, day and night, for at least three weeks.
When this is over, I shall be at liberty, and will myself introduce you
to the brilliant but comparatively quiet routine of society. Place
yourself in my hands; and in Paris remember, when once in society, you
are always there."</p>

<p>I thanked him very much, and promised to follow his counsels
implicitly. He seemed pleased, and said: "I shall now tell you some of
the places you ought to go to. Take your map, and write letters or
numbers upon the points I will indicate, and we will make out a little
list. All the places that I shall mention to you are worth seeing."</p>

<p>In this methodical way, and with a great deal of amusing and
scandalous anecdote, he furnished me with a catalogue and a guide,
which, to a seeker of novelty and pleasure, was invaluable.</p>

<p>"In a fortnight, perhaps in a week," he said, "I shall be at leisure
to be of real use to you. In the meantime, be on your guard. You must
not play; you will be robbed if you do. Remember, you are surrounded,
here, by plausible swindlers and villains of all kinds, who subsist by
devouring strangers. Trust no one but those you know."</p>

<p>I thanked him again, and promised to profit by his advice. But my
heart was too full of the beautiful lady of the Belle &Eacute;toile, to
allow our interview to close without an effort to learn something about
her. I therefore asked for the Count and Countess de St. Alyre, whom I
had had the good fortune to extricate from an extremely unpleasant row
in the hall of the inn.</p>

<p>Alas! he had not seen them since. He did not know where they were
staying. They had a fine old house only a few leagues from Paris; but
he thought it probable that they would remain, for a few days at least,
in the city, as preparations would, no doubt, be necessary, after so
long an absence, for their reception at home.</p>

<p>"How long have they been away?"</p>

<p>"About eight months, I think."</p>

<p>"They are poor, I think you said?"</p>

<p>"What <i>you</i> would consider poor. But, Monsieur, the Count has
an income which affords them the comforts and even the elegancies of
life, living as they do, in a very quiet and retired way, in this cheap
country."</p>

<p>"Then they are very happy?"</p>

<p>"One would say they <i>ought</i> to be happy."</p>

<p>"And what prevents?"</p>

<p>"He is jealous."</p>

<p>"But his wife&mdash;she gives him no cause."</p>

<p>"I am afraid she does."</p>

<p>"How, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I always thought she was a little too&mdash;<i>a great deal</i>
too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too <i>what</i>, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Too handsome. But although she has remarkable fine eyes, exquisite
features, and the most delicate complexion in the world, I believe that
she is a woman of probity. You have never seen her?"</p>

<p>"There was a lady, muffled up in a cloak, with a very thick veil on,
the other night, in the hall of the Belle &Eacute;toile, when I broke
that fellow's head who was bullying the old Count. But her veil was so
thick I could not see a feature through it!" My answer was diplomatic,
you observe. "She may have been the Count's daughter. Do they
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Who, he and his wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>Oh! and what do they quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story; about the lady's diamonds. They are
valuable&mdash;they are worth, La Perelleuse says, about a million of
francs. The Count wishes them sold and turned into revenue, which he
offers to settle as she pleases. The Countess, whose they are, resists,
and for a reason which, I rather think, she can't disclose to him."</p>

<p>"And pray what is that?" I asked, my curiosity a good deal
piqued.</p>

<p>"She is thinking, I conjecture, how well she will look in them when
she marries her second husband."</p>

<p>"Oh?&mdash;yes, to be sure. But the Count de St. Alyre is a good
man?"</p>

<p>"Admirable, and extremely intelligent."</p>

<p>"I should wish so much to be presented to the Count: you tell me
he's so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So agreeably married. But they are living quite out of the world.
He takes her now and then to the Opera, or to a public entertainment;
but that is all."</p>

<p>"And he must remember so much of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and
so many of the scenes of the revolution!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the very man for a philosopher, like you! And he falls asleep
after dinner; and his wife don't. But, seriously, he has retired from
the gay and the great world, and has grown apathetic; and so has his
wife; and nothing seems to interest her now, not even&mdash;her
husband!"</p>

<p>The Marquis stood up to take his leave.</p>

<p>"Don't risk your money," said he. "You will soon have an opportunity
of laying out some of it to great advantage. Several collections of
really good pictures, belonging to persons who have mixed themselves up
in this Bonapartist restoration, must come within a few weeks to the
hammer. You can do wonders when these sales commence. There will be
startling bargains! Reserve yourself for them. I shall let you know all
about it. By-the-by," he said, stopping short as he approached the
door, "I was so near forgetting. There is to be next week, the very
thing you would enjoy so much, because you see so little of it in
England&mdash;I mean a <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i>, conducted, it is said,
with more than usual splendor. It takes place at Versailles&mdash;all
the world will be there; there is such a rush for cards! But I think I
may promise you one. Good-night! Adieu!"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-10"></a>Chapter X - THE BLACK VEIL</h2>

<p>Speaking the language fluently, and with unlimited money, there was
nothing to prevent my enjoying all that was enjoyable in the French
capital. You may easily suppose how two days were passed. At the end of
that time, and at about the same hour, Monsieur Droqville called
again.</p>

<p>Courtly, good-natured, gay, as usual, he told me that the masquerade
ball was fixed for the next Wednesday, and that he had applied for a
card for me.</p>

<p>How awfully unlucky. I was so afraid I should not be able to go.</p>

<p>He stared at me for a moment with a suspicious and menacing look,
which I did not understand, in silence, and then inquired rather
sharply. And will Monsieur Beckett be good enough to say why not?</p>

<p>I was a little surprised, but answered the simple truth: I had made
an engagement for that evening with two or three English friends, and
did not see how I could.</p>

<p>"Just so! You English, wherever you are, always look out for your
English boors, your beer and <i>'bifstek'</i>; and when you come here,
instead of trying to learn something of the people you visit, and
pretend to study, you are guzzling and swearing, and smoking with one
another, and no wiser or more polished at the end of your travels than
if you had been all the time carousing in a booth at Greenwich."</p>

<p>He laughed sarcastically, and looked as if he could have poisoned
me.</p>

<p>"There it is," said he, throwing the card on the table. "Take it or
leave it, just as you please. I suppose I shall have my trouble for my
pains; but it is not usual when a man such as I takes trouble, asks a
favor, and secures a privilege for an acquaintance, to treat him
so."</p>

<p>This was astonishingly impertinent.</p>

<p>I was shocked, offended, penitent. I had possibly committed
unwittingly a breach of good breeding, according to French ideas, which
almost justified the brusque severity of the Marquis's undignified
rebuke.</p>

<p>In a confusion, therefore, of many feelings, I hastened to make my
apologies, and to propitiate the chance friend who had showed me so
much disinterested kindness.</p>

<p>I told him that I would, at any cost, break through the engagement
in which I had unluckily entangled myself; that I had spoken with too
little reflection, and that I certainly had not thanked him at all in
proportion to his kindness, and to my real estimate of it.</p>

<p>"Pray say not a word more; my vexation was entirely on your account;
and I expressed it, I am only too conscious, in terms a great deal too
strong, which, I am sure, your good nature will pardon. Those who know
me a little better are aware that I sometimes say a good deal more than
I intend; and am always sorry when I do. Monsieur Beckett will forget
that his old friend Monsieur Droqville has lost his temper in his
cause, for a moment, and&mdash;we are as good friends as before."</p>

<p>He smiled like the Monsieur Droqville of the Belle &Eacute;toile,
and extended his hand, which I took very respectfully and
cordially.</p>

<p>Our momentary quarrel had left us only better friends.</p>

<p>The Marquis then told me I had better secure a bed in some hotel at
Versailles, as a rush would be made to take them; and advised my going
down next morning for the purpose.</p>

<p>I ordered horses accordingly for eleven o'clock; and, after a little
more conversation, the Marquis d'Harmonville bade me good-night, and
ran down the stairs with his handkerchief to his mouth and nose, and,
as I saw from my window, jumped into his close carriage again and drove
away.</p>

<p>Next day I was at Versailles. As I approached the door of the Hotel
de France it was plain that I was not a moment too soon, if, indeed, I
were not already too late.</p>

<p>A crowd of carriages were drawn up about the entrance, so that I had
no chance of approaching except by dismounting and pushing my way among
the horses. The hall was full of servants and gentlemen screaming to
the proprietor, who in a state of polite distraction was assuring them,
one and all, that there was not a room or a closet disengaged in his
entire house.</p>

<p>I slipped out again, leaving the hall to those who were shouting,
expostulating, and wheedling, in the delusion that the host might, if
he pleased, manage something for them. I jumped into my carriage and
drove, at my horses' best pace, to the Hotel du Reservoir. The blockade
about this door was as complete as the other. The result was the same.
It was very provoking, but what was to be done? My postilion had, a
little officiously, while I was in the hall talking with the hotel
authorities, got his horses, bit by bit, as other carriages moved away,
to the very steps of the inn door.</p>

<p>This arrangement was very convenient so far as getting in again was
concerned. But, this accomplished, how were we to get on? There were
carriages in front, and carriages behind, and no less than four rows of
carriages, of all sorts, outside.</p>

<p>I had at this time remarkably long and clear sight, and if I had
been impatient before, guess what my feelings were when I saw an open
carriage pass along the narrow strip of roadway left open at the other
side, a barouche in which I was certain I recognized the veiled
Countess and her husband. This carriage had been brought to a walk by a
cart which occupied the whole breadth of the narrow way, and was moving
with the customary tardiness of such vehicles.</p>

<p>I should have done more wisely if I had jumped down on the
<i>trottoir</i>, and run round the block of carriages in front of the
barouche. But, unfortunately, I was more of a Murat than a Moltke, and
preferred a direct charge upon my object to relying on <i>tactique</i>.
I dashed across the back seat of a carriage which was next mine, I
don't know how; tumbled through a sort of gig, in which an old
gentleman and a dog were dozing; stepped with an incoherent apology
over the side of an open carriage, in which were four gentlemen engaged
in a hot dispute; tripped at the far side in getting out, and fell flat
across the backs of a pair of horses, who instantly began plunging and
threw me head foremost in the dust.</p>

<p>To those who observed my reckless charge, without being in the
secret of my object, I must have appeared demented. Fortunately, the
interesting barouche had passed before the catastrophe, and covered as
I was with dust, and my hat blocked, you may be sure I did not care to
present myself before the object of my Quixotic devotion.</p>

<p>I stood for a while amid a storm of <i>sacr&eacute;</i>-ing,
tempered disagreeably with laughter; and in the midst of these, while
endeavoring to beat the dust from my clothes with my handkerchief, I
heard a voice with which I was acquainted call, "Monsieur Beckett."</p>

<p>I looked and saw the Marquis peeping from a carriage-window. It was
a welcome sight. In a moment I was at his carriage side.</p>

<p>"You may as well leave Versailles," he said; "you have learned, no
doubt, that there is not a bed to hire in either of the hotels; and I
can add that there is not a room to let in the whole town. But I have
managed something for you that will answer just as well. Tell your
servant to follow us, and get in here and sit beside me."</p>

<p>Fortunately an opening in the closely-packed carriages had just
occurred, and mine was approaching.</p>

<p>I directed the servant to follow us; and the Marquis having said a
word to his driver, we were immediately in motion.</p>

<p>"I will bring you to a comfortable place, the very existence of
which is known to but few Parisians, where, knowing how things were
here, I secured a room for you. It is only a mile away, and an old
comfortable inn, called the Le Dragon Volant. It was fortunate for you
that my tiresome business called me to this place so early."</p>

<p>I think we had driven about a mile-and-a-half to the further side of
the palace when we found ourselves upon a narrow old road, with the
woods of Versailles on one side, and much older trees, of a size seldom
seen in France, on the other.</p>

<p>We pulled up before an antique and solid inn, built of Caen stone,
in a fashion richer and more florid than was ever usual in such houses,
and which indicated that it was originally designed for the private
mansion of some person of wealth, and probably, as the wall bore many
carved shields and supporters of distinction also. A kind of porch,
less ancient than the rest, projected hospitably with a wide and florid
arch, over which, cut in high relief in stone, and painted and gilded,
was the sign of the inn. This was the Flying Dragon, with wings of
brilliant red and gold, expanded, and its tail, pale green and gold,
twisted and knotted into ever so many rings, and ending in a burnished
point barbed like the dart of death.</p>

<p>"I shan't go in&mdash;but you will find it a comfortable place; at
all events better than nothing. I would go in with you, but my
incognito forbids. You will, I daresay, be all the better pleased to
learn that the inn is haunted&mdash;I should have been, in my young
days, I know. But don't allude to that awful fact in hearing of your
host, for I believe it is a sore subject. Adieu. If you want to enjoy
yourself at the ball, take my advice and go in a domino. I think I
shall look in; and certainly, if I do, in the same costume. How shall
we recognize one another? Let me see, something held in the
fingers&mdash;a flower won't do, so many people will have flowers.
Suppose you get a red cross a couple of inches long&mdash; you're an
Englishman&mdash;stitched or pinned on the breast of your domino, and I
a white one? Yes, that will do very well; and whatever room you go into
keep near the door till we meet. I shall look for you at all the doors
I pass; and you, in the same way, for me; and we <i>must</i> find each
other soon. So that is understood. I can't enjoy a thing of that kind
with any but a young person; a man of my age requires the contagion of
young spirits and the companionship of someone who enjoys everything
spontaneously. Farewell; we meet tonight."</p>

<p>By this time I was standing on the road; I shut the carriage-door;
bid him good-bye; and away he drove.</p>

<h2><a name="c4-11"></a>Chapter XI - THE DRAGON VOLANT</h2>

<p>I took one look about me.</p>

<p>The building was picturesque; the trees made it more so. The antique
and sequestered character of the scene contrasted strangely with the
glare and bustle of the Parisian life, to which my eye and ear had
become accustomed.</p>

<p>Then I examined the gorgeous old sign for a minute or two. Next I
surveyed the exterior of the house more carefully. It was large and
solid, and squared more with my ideas of an ancient English hostelrie,
such as the Canterbury Pilgrims might have put up at, than a French
house of entertainment. Except, indeed, for a round turret, that rose
at the left flank of the house, and terminated in the
extinguisher-shaped roof that suggests a French ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>I entered and announced myself as Monsieur Beckett, for whom a room
had been taken. I was received with all the consideration due to an
English milord, with, of course, an unfathomable purse.</p>

<p>My host conducted me to my apartment. It was a large room, a little
somber, paneled with dark wainscoting, and furnished in a stately and
somber style, long out of date. There was a wide hearth, and a heavy
mantelpiece, carved with shields, in which I might, had I been curious
enough, have discovered a correspondence with the heraldry on the outer
walls. There was something interesting, melancholy, and even depressing
in all this. I went to the stone-shafted window, and looked out upon a
small park, with a thick wood, forming the background of a
ch&acirc;teau which presented a cluster of such conical-topped turrets
as I have just now mentioned.</p>

<p>The wood and ch&acirc;teau were melancholy objects. They showed
signs of neglect, and almost of decay; and the gloom of fallen
grandeur, and a certain air of desertion hung oppressively over the
scene.</p>

<p>I asked my host the name of the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>"That, Monsieur, is the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque," he
answered.</p>

<p>"It is a pity it is so neglected," I observed. "I should say,
perhaps, a pity that its proprietor is not more wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"<i>Perhaps</i>?" I repeated, and looked at him. "Then I suppose he
is not very popular."</p>

<p>"Neither one thing nor the other, Monsieur," he answered; "I meant
only that we could not tell what use he might make of riches."</p>

<p>"And who is he?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"The Count de St. Alyre."</p>

<p>"Oh! The Count! You are quite sure?" I asked, very eagerly.</p>

<p>It was now the innkeeper's turn to look at me.</p>

<p>"<i>Quite</i> sure, Monsieur, the Count de St. Alyre."</p>

<p>"Do you see much of him in this part of the world?"</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, Monsieur; he is often absent for a considerable
time."</p>

<p>"And is he poor?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I pay rent to him for this house. It is not much; but I find he
cannot wait long for it," he replied, smiling satirically.</p>

<p>"From what I have heard, however, I should think he cannot be very
poor?" I continued.</p>

<p>"They say, Monsieur, he plays. I know not. He certainly is not rich.
About seven months ago, a relation of his died in a distant place. His
body was sent to the Count's house here, and by him buried in
P&egrave;re la Chaise, as the poor gentleman had desired. The Count was
in profound affliction; although he got a handsome legacy, they say, by
that death. But money never seems to do him good for any time."</p>

<p>"He is old, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Old? We call him the 'Wandering Jew,' except, indeed, that he has
not always the five <i>sous</i> in his pocket. Yet, Monsieur, his
courage does not fail him. He has taken a young and handsome wife."</p>

<p>"And she?" I urged&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the Countess de St. Alyre."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I fancy we may say something more? She has
attributes?"</p>

<p>"Three, Monsieur, three, at least most amiable."</p>

<p>"Ah! And what are they?"</p>

<p>"Youth, beauty, and&mdash;diamonds."</p>

<p>I laughed. The sly old gentleman was foiling my curiosity.</p>

<p>"I see, my friend," said I, "you are reluctant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To quarrel with the Count," he concluded. "True. You see, Monsieur,
he could vex me in two or three ways, so could I him. But, on the
whole, it is better each to mind his business, and to maintain peaceful
relations; you understand."</p>

<p>It was, therefore, no use trying, at least for the present. Perhaps
he had nothing to relate. Should I think differently, by-and-by, I
could try the effect of a few Napoleons. Possibly he meant to extract
them.</p>

<p>The host of the Dragon Volant was an elderly man, thin, bronzed,
intelligent, and with an air of decision, perfectly military. I learned
afterwards that he had served under Napoleon in his early Italian
campaigns.</p>

<p>"One question, I think you may answer," I said, "without risking a
quarrel. Is the Count at home?"</p>

<p>"He has many homes, I conjecture," said the host evasively.
"But&mdash;but I think I may say, Monsieur, that he is, I believe, at
present staying at the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque."</p>

<p>I looked out of the window, more interested than ever, across the
undulating grounds to the ch&acirc;teau, with its gloomy background of
foliage.</p>

<p>"I saw him today, in his carriage at Versailles," I said.</p>

<p>"Very natural."</p>

<p>"Then his carriage, and horses, and servants, are at the
ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>"The carriage he puts up here, Monsieur, and the servants are hired
for the occasion. There is but one who sleeps at the ch&acirc;teau.
Such a life must be terrifying for Madame the Countess," he
replied.</p>

<p>"The old screw!" I thought. "By this torture, he hopes to extract
her diamonds. What a life! What fiends to contend with&mdash;jealousy
and extortion!"</p>

<p>The knight having made his speech to himself, cast his eyes once
more upon the enchanter's castle, and heaved a gentle sigh&mdash;a sigh
of longing, of resolution, and of love.</p>

<p>What a fool I was! And yet, in the sight of angels, are we any wiser
as we grow older? It seems to me, only, that our illusions change as we
go on; but, still, we are madmen all the same.</p>

<p>"Well, St. Clair," said I, as my servant entered, and began to
arrange my things.</p>

<p>"You have got a bed?"</p>

<p>"In the cock-loft, Monsieur, among the spiders, and, <i>par ma
foi</i>! the cats and the owls. But we agree very well. <i>Vive la
bagatelle</i>!"</p>

<p>"I had no idea it was so full."</p>

<p>"Chiefly the servants, Monsieur, of those persons who were fortunate
enough to get apartments at Versailles."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the Dragon Volant?"</p>

<p>"The Dragon Volant! Monsieur; the old fiery dragon! The devil
himself, if all is true! On the faith of a Christian, Monsieur, they
say that diabolical miracles have taken place in this house."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? <i>Revenants</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir; I wish it was no worse. <i>Revenants</i>? No!
People who have never returned&mdash;who vanished, before the eyes of
half-a-dozen men all looking at them."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, St. Clair? Let us hear the story, or miracle, or
whatever it is."</p>

<p>"It is only this, Monsieur, that an ex-master-of-the-horse of the
late king, who lost his head&mdash;Monsieur will have the goodness to
recollect, in the revolution&mdash;being permitted by the Emperor to
return to France, lived here in this hotel, for a month, and at the end
of that time vanished, visibly, as I told you, before the faces of
half-a-dozen credible witnesses! The other was a Russian nobleman, six
feet high and upwards, who, standing in the center of the room,
downstairs, describing to seven gentlemen of unquestionable veracity
the last moments of Peter the Great, and having a glass of <i>eau de
vie</i> in his left hand, and his <i>tasse de cafe,</i> nearly
finished, in his right, in like manner vanished. His boots were found
on the floor where he had been standing; and the gentleman at his right
found, to his astonishment, his cup of coffee in his fingers, and the
gentleman at his left, his glass of <i>eau de vie</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which he swallowed in his confusion," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Which was preserved for three years among the curious articles of
this house, and was broken by the <i>cur&eacute;</i> while conversing
with Mademoiselle Fidone in the housekeeper's room; but of the Russian
nobleman himself, nothing more was ever seen or heard. <i>Parbleu</i>!
when <i>we</i> go out of the Dragon Volant, I hope it may be by the
door. I heard all this, Monsieur, from the postilion who drove us."</p>

<p>"Then it <i>must</i> be true!" said I, jocularly: but I was
beginning to feel the gloom of the view, and of the chamber in which I
stood; there had stolen over me, I know not how, a presentiment of
evil; and my joke was with an effort, and my spirit flagged.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-12"></a>Chapter XII - THE MAGICIAN</h2>

<p>No more brilliant spectacle than this masked ball could be imagined.
Among other <i>salons</i> and galleries, thrown open, was the enormous
Perspective of the "Grande Galerie des Glaces," lighted up on that
occasion with no less than four thousand wax candles, reflected and
repeated by all the mirrors, so that the effect was almost dazzling.
The grand suite of <i>salons</i> was thronged with masques, in every
conceivable costume. There was not a single room deserted. Everyplace
was animated with music voices, brilliant colors, flashing jewels, the
hilarity of extemporized comedy, and all the spirited incidents of a
cleverly sustained masquerade. I had never seen before anything in the
least comparable to this magnificent <i>fete.</i> I moved along,
indolently, in my domino and mask, loitering, now and then, to enjoy a
clever dialogue, a farcical song, or an amusing monologue, but, at the
same time, keeping my eyes about me, lest my friend in the black
domino, with the little white cross on his breast, should pass me
by.</p>

<p>I had delayed and looked about me, specially, at every door I
passed, as the Marquis and I had agreed; but he had not yet
appeared.</p>

<p>While I was thus employed, in the very luxury of lazy amusement, I
saw a gilded sedan chair, or, rather, a Chinese palanquin, exhibiting
the fantastic exuberance of "Celestial" decoration, borne forward on
gilded poles by four richly-dressed Chinese; one with a wand in his
hand marched in front, and another behind; and a slight and solemn man,
with a long black beard, a tall fez, such as a dervish is represented
as wearing, walked close to its side. A strangely-embroidered robe fell
over his shoulders, covered with hieroglyphic symbols; the embroidery
was in black and gold, upon a variegated ground of brilliant colors.
The robe was bound about his waist with a broad belt of gold, with
cabalistic devices traced on it in dark red and black; red stockings,
and shoes embroidered with gold, and pointed and curved upward at the
toes, in Oriental fashion, appeared below the skirt of the robe. The
man's face was dark, fixed, and solemn, and his eyebrows black, and
enormously heavy&mdash;he carried a singular-looking book under his
arm, a wand of polished black wood in his other hand, and walked with
his chin sunk on his breast, and his eyes fixed upon the floor. The man
in front waved his wand right and left to clear the way for the
advancing palanquin, the curtains of which were closed; and there was
something so singular, strange and solemn about the whole thing, that I
felt at once interested.</p>

<p>I was very well pleased when I saw the bearers set down their
burthen within a few yards of the spot on which I stood.</p>

<p>The bearers and the men with the gilded wands forthwith clapped
their hands, and in silence danced round the palanquin a curious and
half-frantic dance, which was yet, as to figures and postures,
perfectly methodical. This was soon accompanied by a clapping of hands
and a ha-ha-ing, rhythmically delivered.</p>

<p>While the dance was going on a hand was lightly laid on my arm, and,
looking round, a black domino with a white cross stood beside me.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I have found you," said the Marquis; "and at this
moment. This is the best group in the rooms. <i>You</i> must speak to
the wizard. About an hour ago I lighted upon them, in another
<i>salon,</i> and consulted the oracle by putting questions. I never
was more amazed. Although his answers were a little disguised it was
soon perfectly plain that he knew every detail about the business,
which no one on earth had heard of but myself, and two or three other
men, about the most cautious Persons in France. I shall never forget
that shock. I saw other people who consulted him, evidently as much
surprised and more frightened than I. I came with the Count de St.
Alyre and the Countess."</p>

<p>He nodded toward a thin figure, also in a domino. It was the
Count.</p>

<p>"Come," he said to me, "I'll introduce you."</p>

<p>I followed, you may suppose, readily enough.</p>

<p>The Marquis presented me, with a very prettily-turned allusion to my
fortunate intervention in his favor at the Belle &Eacute;toile; and the
Count overwhelmed me with polite speeches, and ended by saying, what
pleased me better still:</p>

<p>"The Countess is near us, in the next salon but one, chatting with
her old friend the Duchesse d'Argensaque; I shall go for her in a few
minutes; and when I bring her here, she shall make your acquaintance;
and thank you, also, for your assistance, rendered with so much courage
when we were so very disagreeably interrupted."</p>

<p>"You must, positively, speak with the magician," said the Marquis to
the Count de St. Alyre, "you will be so much amused. <i>I</i> did so;
and, I assure you, I could not have anticipated such answers! I don't
know what to believe."</p>

<p>"Really! Then, by all means, let us try," he replied.</p>

<p>We three approached, together, the side of the palanquin, at which
the black-bearded magician stood.</p>

<p>A young man, in a Spanish dress, who, with a friend at his side, had
just conferred with the conjuror, was saying, as he passed us by:</p>

<p>"Ingenious mystification! Who is that in the palanquin? He seems to
know everybody!"</p>

<p>The Count, in his mask and domino, moved along, stiffly, with us,
toward the palanquin. A clear circle was maintained by the Chinese
attendants, and the spectators crowded round in a ring.</p>

<p>One of these men&mdash;he who with a gilded wand had preceded the
procession&mdash;advanced, extending his empty hand, palm upward.</p>

<p>"Money?" inquired the Count.</p>

<p>"Gold," replied the usher.</p>

<p>The Count placed a piece of money in his hand; and I and the Marquis
were each called on in turn to do likewise as we entered the circle. We
paid accordingly.</p>

<p>The conjuror stood beside the palanquin, its silk curtain in his
hand; his chin sunk, with its long, jet-black beard, on his chest; the
outer hand grasping the black wand, on which he leaned; his eyes were
lowered, as before, to the ground; his face looked absolutely lifeless.
Indeed, I never saw face or figure so moveless, except in death. The
first question the Count put, was: "Am I married, or unmarried?"</p>

<p>The conjuror drew back the curtain quickly, and placed his ear
toward a richly-dressed Chinese, who sat in the litter; withdrew his
head, and closed the curtain again; and then answered: "Yes."</p>

<p>The same preliminary was observed each time, so that the man with
the black wand presented himself, not as a prophet, but as a medium;
and answered, as it seemed, in the words of a greater than himself.</p>

<p>Two or three questions followed, the answers to which seemed to
amuse the Marquis very much; but the point of which I could not see,
for I knew next to nothing of the Count's peculiarities and
adventures.</p>

<p>"Does my wife love me?" asked he, playfully.</p>

<p>"As well as you deserve."</p>

<p>"Whom do I love best in the world?"</p>

<p>"Self."</p>

<p>"Oh! That I fancy is pretty much the case with everyone. But,
putting myself out of the question, do I love anything on earth better
than my wife?"</p>

<p>"Her diamonds."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Count. The Marquis, I could see, laughed.</p>

<p>"Is it true," said the Count, changing the conversation
peremptorily, "that there has been a battle in Naples?"</p>

<p>"No; in France."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Count, satirically, with a glance round.</p>

<p>"And may I inquire between what powers, and on what particular
quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Between the Count and Countess de St. Alyre, and about a document
they subscribed on the 25th July, 1811."</p>

<p>The Marquis afterwards told me that this was the date of their
marriage settlement.</p>

<p>The Count stood stock-still for a minute or so; and one could fancy
that they saw his face flushing through his mask.</p>

<p>Nobody, but we two, knew that the inquirer was the Count de St.
Alyre.</p>

<p>I thought he was puzzled to find a subject for his next question;
and, perhaps, repented having entangled himself in such a colloquy. If
so, he was relieved; for the Marquis, touching his arms, whispered.</p>

<p>"Look to your right, and see who is coming."</p>

<p>I looked in the direction indicated by the Marquis, and I saw a
gaunt figure stalking toward us. It was not a masque. The face was
broad, scarred, and white. In a word, it was the ugly face of Colonel
Gaillarde, who, in the costume of a corporal of the Imperial Guard,
with his left arm so adjusted as to look like a stump, leaving the
lower part of the coat-sleeve empty, and pinned up to the breast. There
were strips of very real sticking-plaster across his eyebrow and
temple, where my stick had left its mark, to score, hereafter, among
the more honorable scars of war.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-13"></a>Chapter XIII - THE ORACLE TELLS ME WONDERS</h2>

<p>I forgot for a moment how impervious my mask and domino were to the
hard stare of the old campaigner, and was preparing for an animated
scuffle. It was only for a moment, of course; but the count cautiously
drew a little back as the gasconading corporal, in blue uniform, white
vest, and white gaiters&mdash;for my friend Gaillarde was as loud and
swaggering in his assumed character as in his real one of a colonel of
dragoons&mdash;drew near. He had already twice all but got himself
turned out of doors for vaunting the exploits of Napoleon le Grand, in
terrific mock-heroics, and had very nearly come to hand-grips with a
Prussian hussar. In fact, he would have been involved in several
sanguinary rows already, had not his discretion reminded him that the
object of his coming there at all, namely, to arrange a meeting with an
affluent widow, on whom he believed he had made a tender impression,
would not have been promoted by his premature removal from the festive
scene of which he was an ornament, in charge of a couple of
<i>gendarmes</i>.</p>

<p>"Money! Gold! Bah! What money can a wounded soldier like your humble
servant have amassed, with but his sword-hand left, which, being
necessarily occupied, places not a finger at his command with which to
scrape together the spoils of a routed enemy?"</p>

<p>"No gold from him," said the magician. "His scars frank him."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Monsieur le proph&egrave;te! Bravissimo! Here I am. Shall I
begin, <i>mon sorcier</i>, without further loss of time, to question
you?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, he commenced, in stentorian tones.
After half-a-dozen questions and answers, he asked: "Whom do I pursue
at present?"</p>

<p>"Two persons."</p>

<p>"Ha! Two? Well, who are they?"</p>

<p>"An Englishman, whom if you catch, he will kill you; and a French
widow, whom if you find, she will spit in your face."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le magicien calls a spade a spade, and knows that his
cloth protects him. No matter! Why do I pursue them?"</p>

<p>"The widow has inflicted a wound on your heart, and the Englishman a
wound on your head. They are each separately too strong for you; take
care your pursuit does not unite them."</p>

<p>"Bah! How could that be?"</p>

<p>"The Englishman protects ladies. He has got that fact into your
head. The widow, if she sees, will marry him. It takes some time, she
will reflect, to become a colonel, and the Englishman is unquestionably
young."</p>

<p>"I will cut his cock's-comb for him," he ejaculated with an oath and
a grin; and in a softer tone he asked, "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Near enough to be offended if you fail."</p>

<p>"So she ought, by my faith. You are right, Monsieur le
proph&egrave;te! A hundred thousand thanks! Farewell!" And staring
about him, and stretching his lank neck as high as he could, he strode
away with his scars, and white waistcoat and gaiters, and his bearskin
shako.</p>

<p>I had been trying to see the person who sat in the palanquin. I had
only once an opportunity of a tolerably steady peep. What I saw was
singular. The oracle was dressed, as I have said, very richly, in the
Chinese fashion. He was a figure altogether on a larger scale than the
interpreter, who stood outside. The features seemed to me large and
heavy, and the head was carried with a downward inclination! The eyes
were closed, and the chin rested on the breast of his embroidered
pelisse. The face seemed fixed, and the very image of apathy. Its
character and <i>pose</i> seemed an exaggerated repetition of the
immobility of the figure who communicated with the noisy outer world.
This face looked blood-red; but that was caused, I concluded, by the
light entering through the red silk curtains. All this struck me almost
at a glance; I had not many seconds in which to make my observation.
The ground was now clear, and the Marquis said, "Go forward, my
friend."</p>

<p>I did so. When I reached the magician, as we called the man with the
black wand, I glanced over my shoulder to see whether the Count was
near.</p>

<p>No, he was some yards behind; and he and the Marquis, whose
curiosity seemed to be by this time satisfied, were now conversing
generally upon some subject of course quite different.</p>

<p>I was relieved, for the sage seemed to blurt out secrets in an
unexpected way; and some of mine might not have amused the Count.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. I wished to test the prophet. A
Church-of-England man was a <i>rara avis</i> in Paris.</p>

<p>"What is my religion?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A beautiful heresy," answered the oracle instantly.</p>

<p>"A heresy?&mdash;and pray how is it named?"</p>

<p>"Love."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then I suppose I am a polytheist, and love a great many?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>"But, seriously," I asked, intending to turn the course of our
colloquy a little out of an embarrassing channel, "have I ever learned
any words of devotion by heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you repeat them?"</p>

<p>"Approach."</p>

<p>I did, and lowered my ear.</p>

<p>The man with the black wand closed the curtains, and whispered,
slowly and distinctly, these words which, I need scarcely tell you, I
instantly recognized:</p>

<p><i>"I may never see you more; and, oh! I that I could forget
you!&mdash;go&mdash;farewell&mdash;for God's sake, go!"</i></p>

<p>I started as I heard them. They were, you know, the last words
whispered to me by the Countess.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! How miraculous! Words heard most assuredly, by no ear
on earth but my own and the lady's who uttered them, till now!"</p>

<p>I looked at the impassive face of the spokesman with the wand. There
was no trace of meaning, or even of a consciousness that the words he
had uttered could possibly interest me.</p>

<p>"What do I most long for?" I asked, scarcely knowing what I
said.</p>

<p>"Paradise."</p>

<p>"And what prevents my reaching it?"</p>

<p>"A black veil."</p>

<p>Stronger and stronger! The answers seemed to me to indicate the
minutest acquaintance with every detail of my little romance, of which
not even the Marquis knew anything! And I, the questioner, masked and
robed so that my own brother could not have known me!</p>

<p>"You said I loved someone. Am I loved in return?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Try."</p>

<p>I was speaking lower than before, and stood near the dark man with
the beard, to prevent the necessity of his speaking in a loud key.</p>

<p>"Does anyone love me?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Secretly," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Much or little?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Too well."</p>

<p>"How long will that love last?"</p>

<p>"Till the rose casts its leaves."</p>

<p>The rose&mdash;another allusion!</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;darkness!" I sighed. "But till then I live in
light."</p>

<p>"The light of violet eyes."</p>

<p>Love, if not a religion, as the oracle had just pronounced it, is,
at least, a superstition. How it exalts the imagination! How it
enervates the reason! How credulous it makes us!</p>

<p>All this which, in the case of another I should have laughed at,
most powerfully affected me in my own. It inflamed my ardor, and half
crazed my brain, and even influenced my conduct.</p>

<p>The spokesman of this wonderful trick&mdash;if trick it
were&mdash;now waved me backward with his wand, and as I withdrew, my
eyes still fixed upon the group, and this time encircled with an aura
of mystery in my fancy; backing toward the ring of spectators, I saw
him raise his hand suddenly, with a gesture of command, as a signal to
the usher who carried the golden wand in front.</p>

<p>The usher struck his wand on the ground, and, in a shrill voice,
proclaimed: "The great Confu is silent for an hour."</p>

<p>Instantly the bearers pulled down a sort of blind of bamboo, which
descended with a sharp clatter, and secured it at the bottom; and then
the man in the tall fez, with the black beard and wand, began a sort of
dervish dance. In this the men with the gold wands joined, and finally,
in an outer ring, the bearers, the palanquin being the center of the
circles described by these solemn dancers, whose pace, little by
little, quickened, whose gestures grew sudden, strange, frantic, as the
motion became swifter and swifter, until at length the whirl became so
rapid that the dancers seemed to fly by with the speed of a mill-wheel,
and amid a general clapping of hands, and universal wonder, these
strange performers mingled with the crowd, and the exhibition, for the
time at least, ended.</p>

<p>The Marquis d'Harmonville was standing not far away, looking on the
ground, as one could judge by his attitude and musing. I approached,
and he said:</p>

<p>"The Count has just gone away to look for his wife. It is a pity she
was not here to consult the prophet; it would have been amusing, I
daresay, to see how the Count bore it. Suppose we follow him. I have
asked him to introduce you."</p>

<p>With a beating heart, I accompanied the Marquis d'Harmonville.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-14"></a>Chapter XIV - MADEMOISELLE DE LA
VALLI&Egrave;RE</h2>

<p>We wandered through the <i>salons</i>, the Marquis and I. It was no
easy matter to find a friend in rooms so crowded.</p>

<p>"Stay here," said the Marquis, "I have thought of a way of finding
him. Besides, his jealousy may have warned him that there is no
particular advantage to be gained by presenting you to his wife; I had
better go and reason with him, as you seem to wish an introduction so
very much."</p>

<p>This occurred in the room that is now called the "Salon d'Apollon."
The paintings remained in my memory, and my adventure of that evening
was destined to occur there.</p>

<p>I sat down upon a sofa, and looked about me. Three or four persons
beside myself were seated on this roomy piece of gilded furniture. They
were chatting all very gaily; all&mdash;except the person who sat next
me, and she was a lady. Hardly two feet interposed between us. The lady
sat apparently in a reverie. Nothing could be more graceful. She wore
the costume perpetuated in Collignan's full-length portrait of
Mademoiselle de la Vali&egrave;re. It is, as you know, not only rich,
but elegant. Her hair was powdered, but one could perceive that it was
naturally a dark brown. One pretty little foot appeared, and could
anything be more exquisite than her hand?</p>

<p>It was extremely provoking that this lady wore her mask, and did
not, as many did, hold it for a time in her hand.</p>

<p>I was convinced that she was pretty. Availing myself of the
privilege of a masquerade, a microcosm in which it is impossible,
except by voice and allusion, to distinguish friend from foe, I
spoke:</p>

<p>"It is not easy, Mademoiselle, to deceive me," I began.</p>

<p>"So much the better for Monsieur," answered the mask, quietly.</p>

<p>"I mean," I said, determined to tell my fib, "that beauty is a gift
more difficult to conceal than Mademoiselle supposes."</p>

<p>"Yet Monsieur has succeeded very well," she said in the same sweet
and careless tones.</p>

<p>"I see the costume of this, the beautiful Mademoiselle de la
Vali&egrave;re, upon a form that surpasses her own; I raise my eyes,
and I behold a mask, and yet I recognize the lady; beauty is like that
precious stone in the 'Arabian Nights,' which emits, no matter how
concealed, a light that betrays it."</p>

<p>"I know the story," said the young lady. "The light betrayed it, not
in the sun but in darkness. Is there so little light in these rooms,
Monsieur, that a poor glowworm can show so brightly? I thought we were
in a luminous atmosphere, wherever a certain Countess moved?"</p>

<p>Here was an awkward speech! How was I to answer? This lady might be,
as they say some ladies are, a lover of mischief, or an intimate of the
Countess de St. Alyre. Cautiously, therefore, I inquired,</p>

<p>"What Countess?"</p>

<p>"If you know me, you must know that she is my dearest friend. Is she
not beautiful?"</p>

<p>"How can I answer, there are so many countesses."</p>

<p>"Everyone who knows me, knows who my best beloved friend is. You
don't know me?"</p>

<p>"That is cruel. I can scarcely believe I am mistaken."</p>

<p>"With whom were you walking, just now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A gentleman, a friend," I answered.</p>

<p>"I saw him, of course, a friend; but I think I know him, and should
like to be certain. Is he not a certain Marquis?"</p>

<p>Here was another question that was extremely awkward.</p>

<p>"There are so many people here, and one may walk, at one time with
one, and at another with a different one, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That an unscrupulous person has no difficulty in evading a simple
question like mine. Know then, once for all, that nothing disgusts a
person of spirit so much as suspicion. You, Monsieur, are a gentleman
of discretion. I shall respect you accordingly."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle would despise me, were I to violate a confidence."</p>

<p>"But you don't deceive me. You imitate your friend's diplomacy. I
hate diplomacy. It means fraud and cowardice. Don't you think I know
him? The gentleman with the cross of white ribbon on his breast? I know
the Marquis d'Harmonville perfectly. You see to what good purpose your
ingenuity has been expended."</p>

<p>"To that conjecture I can answer neither yes nor no."</p>

<p>"You need not. But what was your motive in mortifying a lady?"</p>

<p>"It is the last thing on earth I should do."</p>

<p>"You affected to know me, and you don't; through caprice, or
listlessness, or curiosity, you wished to converse, not with a lady,
but with a costume. You admired, and you pretend to mistake me for
another. But who is quite perfect? Is truth any longer to be found on
earth?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle has formed a mistaken opinion of me."</p>

<p>"And you also of me; you find me less foolish than you supposed. I
know perfectly whom you intend amusing with compliments and melancholy
declamation, and whom, with that amiable purpose, you have been
seeking."</p>

<p>"Tell me whom you mean," I entreated. "Upon one condition."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"That you will confess if I name the lady."</p>

<p>"You describe my object unfairly," I objected. "I can't admit that I
proposed speaking to any lady in the tone you describe."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't insist on that; only if I name the lady, you will
promise to admit that I am right."</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> I promise?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, there is no compulsion; but your promise is the only
condition on which I will speak to you again."</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment; but how could she possibly tell? The
Countess would scarcely have admitted this little romance to anyone;
and the mask in the La Valli&egrave;re costume could not possibly know
who the masked domino beside her was.</p>

<p>"I consent," I said, "I promise."</p>

<p>"You must promise on the honor of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Well, I do; on the honor of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Then this lady is the Countess de St. Alyre."</p>

<p>I was unspeakably surprised; I was disconcerted; but I remembered my
promise, and said:</p>

<p>"The Countess de St. Alyre <i>is</i>, unquestionably, the lady to
whom I hoped for an introduction tonight; but I beg to assure you, also
on the honor of a gentleman, that she has not the faintest imaginable
suspicion that I was seeking such an honor, nor, in all probability,
does she remember that such a person as I exists. I had the honor to
render her and the Count a trifling service, too trifling, I fear, to
have earned more than an hour's recollection."</p>

<p>"The world is not so ungrateful as you suppose; or if it be, there
are, nevertheless, a few hearts that redeem it. I can answer for the
Countess de St. Alyre, she never forgets a kindness. She does not show
all she feels; for she is unhappy, and cannot."</p>

<p>"Unhappy! I feared, indeed, that might be. But for all the rest that
you are good enough to suppose, it is but a flattering dream."</p>

<p>"I told you that I am the Countess's friend, and being so I must
know something of her character; also, there are confidences between
us, and I may know more than you think of those trifling services of
which you suppose the recollection is so transitory."</p>

<p>I was becoming more and more interested. I was as wicked as other
young men, and the heinousness of such a pursuit was as nothing, now
that self-love and all the passions that mingle in such a romance were
roused. The image of the beautiful Countess had now again quite
superseded the pretty counterpart of La Valli&egrave;re, who was before
me. I would have given a great deal to hear, in solemn earnest, that
she did remember the champion who, for her sake, had thrown himself
before the saber of an enraged dragoon, with only a cudgel in his hand,
and conquered.</p>

<p>"You say the Countess is unhappy," said I. "What causes her
unhappiness?"</p>

<p>"Many things. Her husband is old, jealous, and tyrannical. Is not
that enough? Even when relieved from his society, she is lonely."</p>

<p>"But you are her friend?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"And you think one friend enough?" she answered; "she has one alone,
to whom she can open her heart."</p>

<p>"Is there room for another friend?"</p>

<p>"Try."</p>

<p>"How can I find a way?"</p>

<p>"She will aid you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>She answered by a question. "Have you secured rooms in either of the
hotels of Versailles?"</p>

<p>"No, I could not. I am lodged in the Dragon Volant, which stands at
the verge of the grounds of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque."</p>

<p>"That is better still. I need not ask if you have courage for an
adventure. I need not ask if you are a man of honor. A lady may trust
herself to you, and fear nothing. There are few men to whom the
interview, such as I shall arrange, could be granted with safety. You
shall meet her at two o'clock this morning in the Park of the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque. What room do you occupy in the Dragon
Volant?"</p>

<p>I was amazed at the audacity and decision of this girl. Was she, as
we say in England, hoaxing me?</p>

<p>"I can describe that accurately," said I. "As I look from the rear
of the house, in which my apartment is, I am at the extreme right, next
the angle; and one pair of stairs up, from the hall."</p>

<p>"Very well; you must have observed, if you looked into the park, two
or three clumps of chestnut and lime trees, growing so close together
as to form a small grove. You must return to your hotel, change your
dress, and, preserving a scrupulous secrecy as to why or where you go,
leave the Dragon Volant, and climb the park wall, unseen; you will
easily recognize the grove I have mentioned; there you will meet the
Countess, who will grant you an audience of a few minutes, who will
expect the most scrupulous reserve on your part, and who will explain
to you, in a few words, a great deal which I could not so well tell you
here."</p>

<p>I cannot describe the feeling with which I heard these words. I was
astounded. Doubt succeeded. I could not believe these agitating
words.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle will believe that if I only dared assure myself that
so great a happiness and honor were really intended for me, my
gratitude would be as lasting as my life. But how dare I believe that
Mademoiselle does not speak, rather from her own sympathy or goodness,
than from a certainty that the Countess de St. Alyre would concede so
great an honor?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur believes either that I am not, as I pretend to be, in the
secret which he hitherto supposed to be shared by no one but the
Countess and himself, or else that I am cruelly mystifying him. That I
am in her confidence, I swear by all that is dear in a whispered
farewell. By the last companion of this flower!" and she took for a
moment in her fingers the nodding head of a white rosebud that was
nestled in her bouquet. "By my own good star, and hers&mdash;or shall I
call it our 'belle &eacute;toile'? Have I said enough?"</p>

<p>"Enough?" I repeated, "more than enough&mdash;a thousand
thanks."</p>

<p>"And being thus in her confidence, I am clearly her friend; and
being a friend would it be friendly to use her dear name so; and all
for sake of practicing a vulgar trick upon you&mdash;a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle will forgive me. Remember how very precious is the
hope of seeing, and speaking to the Countess. Is it wonderful, then,
that I should falter in my belief? You have convinced me, however, and
will forgive my hesitation."</p>

<p>"You will be at the place I have described, then, at two
o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," I answered.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur, I know, will not fail through fear. No, he need not
assure me; his courage is already proved."</p>

<p>"No danger, in such a case, will be unwelcome to me."</p>

<p>"Had you not better go now, Monsieur, and rejoin your friend?"</p>

<p>"I promised to wait here for my friend's return. The Count de St.
Alyre said that he intended to introduce me to the Countess."</p>

<p>"And Monsieur is so simple as to believe him?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not?"</p>

<p>"Because he is jealous and cunning. You will see. He will never
introduce you to his wife. He will come here and say he cannot find
her, and promise another time."</p>

<p>"I think I see him approaching, with my friend. No&mdash;there is no
lady with him."</p>

<p>"I told you so. You will wait a long time for that happiness, if it
is never to reach you except through his hands. In the meantime, you
had better not let him see you so near me. He will suspect that we have
been talking of his wife; and that will whet his jealousy and his
vigilance."</p>

<p>I thanked my unknown friend in the mask, and withdrawing a few
steps, came, by a little "circumbendibus," upon the flank of the Count.
I smiled under my mask as he assured me that the Duchess de la Roqueme
had changed her place, and taken the Countess with her; but he hoped,
at some very early time, to have an opportunity of enabling her to make
my acquaintance.</p>

<p>I avoided the Marquis d'Harmonville, who was following the Count. I
was afraid he might propose accompanying me home, and had no wish to be
forced to make an explanation.</p>

<p>I lost myself quickly, therefore, in the crowd, and moved, as
rapidly as it would allow me, toward the Galerie des Glaces, which lay
in the direction opposite to that in which I saw the Count and my
friend the Marquis moving.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-15"></a>Chapter XV - STRANGE STORY OF THE DRAGON
VOLANT</h2>

<p>These <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> were earlier in those days, and in France,
than our modern balls are in London. I consulted my watch. It was a
little past twelve.</p>

<p>It was a still and sultry night; the magnificent suite of rooms,
vast as some of them were, could not be kept at a temperature less than
oppressive, especially to people with masks on. In some places the
crowd was inconvenient, and the profusion of lights added to the heat.
I removed my mask, therefore, as I saw some other people do, who were
as careless of mystery as I. I had hardly done so, and began to breathe
more comfortably, when I heard a friendly English voice call me by my
name. It was Tom Whistlewick, of the &mdash;&mdash;th Dragoons. He had
unmasked, with a very flushed face, as I did. He was one of those
Waterloo heroes, new from the mint of glory, whom, as a body, all the
world, except France, revered; and the only thing I knew against him,
was a habit of allaying his thirst, which was excessive at balls,
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, musical parties, and all gatherings, where it was
to be had, with champagne; and, as he introduced me to his friend,
Monsieur Carmaignac, I observed that he spoke a little thick. Monsieur
Carmaignac was little, lean, and as straight as a ramrod. He was bald,
took snuff, and wore spectacles; and, as I soon learned, held an
official position.</p>

<p>Tom was facetious, sly, and rather difficult to understand, in his
present pleasant mood. He was elevating his eyebrows and screwing his
lips oddly, and fanning himself vaguely with his mask.</p>

<p>After some agreeable conversation I was glad to observe that he
preferred silence, and was satisfied with the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
listener, as I and Monsieur Carmaignac chatted; and he seated himself,
with extraordinary caution and indecision, upon a bench, beside us, and
seemed very soon to find a difficulty in keeping his eyes open.</p>

<p>"I heard you mention," said the French gentleman, "that you had
engaged an apartment in the Dragon Volant, about half a league from
this. When I was in a different police department, about four years
ago, two very strange cases were connected with that house. One was of
a wealthy <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i>, permitted to return to France by
the Em&mdash;by Napoleon. He vanished. The other&mdash;equally
strange&mdash;was the case of a Russian of rank and wealth. He
disappeared just as mysteriously."</p>

<p>"My servant," I said, "gave me a confused account of some
occurrences, and, as well as I recollect, he described the same
persons&mdash;I mean a returned French nobleman and a Russian
gentleman. But he made the whole story so marvelous&mdash;I mean in the
supernatural sense&mdash;that, I confess, I did not believe a word of
it."</p>

<p>"No, there was nothing supernatural; but a great deal inexplicable,"
said the French gentleman. "Of course, there may be theories; but the
thing was never explained, nor, so far as I know, was a ray of light
ever thrown upon it."</p>

<p>"Pray let me hear the story," I said. "I think I have a claim, as it
affects my quarters. You don't suspect the people of the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it has changed hands since then. But there seemed to be a
fatality about a particular room."</p>

<p>"Could you describe that room?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. It is a spacious, paneled bedroom, up one pair of
stairs, in the back of the house, and at the extreme right, as you look
from its windows."</p>

<p>"Ho! Really? Why, then, I have got the very room!" I said, beginning
to be more interested&mdash;perhaps the least bit in the world,
disagreeably. "Did the people die, or were they actually spirited
away?"</p>

<p>"No, they did not die&mdash;they disappeared very oddly. I'll tell
you the particulars&mdash;I happen to know them exactly, because I made
an official visit, on the first occasion, to the house, to collect
evidence; and although I did not go down there, upon the second, the
papers came before me, and I dictated the official letter dispatched to
the relations of the people who had disappeared; they had applied to
the government to investigate the affair. We had letters from the same
relations more than two years later, from which we learned that the
missing men had never turned up."</p>

<p>He took a pinch of snuff, and looked steadily at me.</p>

<p>"Never! I shall relate all that happened, so far as we could
discover. The French noble, who was the Chevalier Chateau Blassemare,
unlike most <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> had taken the matter in time,
sold a large portion of his property before the revolution had
proceeded so far as to render that next to impossible, and retired with
a large sum. He brought with him about half a million of francs, the
greater part of which he invested in the French funds; a much larger
sum remained in Austrian land and securities. You will observe then
that this gentleman was rich, and there was no allegation of his having
lost money, or being in any way embarrassed. You see?"</p>

<p>I assented.</p>

<p>"This gentleman's habits were not expensive in proportion to his
means. He had suitable lodgings in Paris; and for a time, society, and
theaters, and other reasonable amusements, engrossed him. He did not
play. He was a middleaged man, affecting youth, with the vanities which
are usual in such persons; but, for the rest, he was a gentle and
polite person, who disturbed nobody&mdash;a person, you see, not likely
to provoke an enmity."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Early in the summer of 1811 he got an order permitting him to copy
a picture in one of these <i>salons</i>, and came down here, to
Versailles, for the purpose. His work was getting on slowly. After a
time he left his hotel here, and went, by way of change, to the Dragon
Volant; there he took, by special choice, the bedroom which has fallen
to you by chance. From this time, it appeared, he painted little; and
seldom visited his apartments in Paris. One night he saw the host of
the Dragon Volant, and told him that he was going into Paris, to remain
for a day or two, on very particular business; that his servant would
accompany him, but that he would retain his apartments at the Dragon
Volant, and return in a few days. He left some clothes there, but
packed a portmanteau, took his dressing case and the rest, and, with
his servant behind his carriage, drove into Paris. You observe all
this, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Most attentively," I answered.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur, as soon as they were approaching his lodgings, he
stopped the carriage on a sudden, told his servant that he had changed
his mind; that he would sleep elsewhere that night, that he had very
particular business in the north of France, not far from Rouen, that he
would set out before daylight on his journey, and return in a
fortnight. He called a <i>fiacre</i>, took in his hand a leather bag
which, the servant said, was just large enough to hold a few shirts and
a coat, but that it was enormously heavy, as he could testify, for he
held it in his hand, while his master took out his purse to count
thirty-six Napoleons, for which the servant was to account when he
should return. He then sent him on, in the carriage; and he, with the
bag I have mentioned, got into the <i>fiacre</i>. Up to that, you see,
the narrative is quite clear."</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Now comes the mystery," said Monsieur Carmaignac. "After that, the
Count Chateau Blassemare was never more seen, so far as we can make
out, by acquaintance or friend. We learned that the day before the
Count's stockbroker had, by his direction, sold all his stock in the
French funds, and handed him the cash it realized. The reason he gave
him for this measure tallied with what he said to his servant. He told
him that he was going to the north of France to settle some claims, and
did not know exactly how much might be required. The bag, which had
puzzled the servant by its weight, contained, no doubt, a large sum in
gold. Will Monsieur try my snuff?"</p>

<p>He politely tendered his open snuff-box, of which I partook,
experimentally.</p>

<p>"A reward was offered," he continued, "when the inquiry was
instituted, for any information tending to throw a light upon the
mystery, which might be afforded by the driver of the <i>fiacre</i>
'employed on the night of' (so-and-so), 'at about the hour of half-past
ten, by a gentleman, with a black-leather bag in his hand, who
descended from a private carriage, and gave his servant some money,
which he counted twice over.' About a hundred-and-fifty drivers
applied, but not one of them was the right man. We did, however, elicit
a curious and unexpected piece of evidence in quite another quarter.
What a racket that plaguey harlequin makes with his sword!"</p>

<p>"Intolerable!" I chimed in.</p>

<p>The harlequin was soon gone, and he resumed.</p>

<p>"The evidence I speak of came from a boy, about twelve years old,
who knew the appearance of the Count perfectly, having been often
employed by him as a messenger. He stated that about half-past twelve
o'clock, on the same night&mdash;upon which you are to observe, there
was a brilliant moon&mdash;he was sent, his mother having been suddenly
taken ill, for the <i>sage femme</i> who lived within a stone's throw
of the Dragon Volant. His father's house, from which he started, was a
mile away, or more, from that inn, in order to reach which he had to
pass round the park of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque, at the site
most remote from the point to which he was going. It passes the old
churchyard of St. Aubin, which is separated from the road only by a
very low fence, and two or three enormous old trees. The boy was a
little nervous as he approached this ancient cemetery; and, under the
bright moonlight, he saw a man whom he distinctly recognized as the
Count, whom they designated by a sobriquet which means 'the man of
smiles.' He was looking rueful enough now, and was seated on the side
of a tombstone, on which he had laid a pistol, while he was ramming
home the charge of another.</p>

<p>"The boy got cautiously by, on tiptoe, with his eyes all the time on
the Count Chateau Blassernare, or the man he mistook for him&mdash;his
dress was not what he usually wore, but the witness swore that he could
not be mistaken as to his identity. He said his face looked grave and
stern; but though he did not smile, it was the same face he knew so
well. Nothing would make him swerve from that. If that were he, it was
the last time he was seen. He has never been heard of since. Nothing
could be heard of him in the neighborhood of Rouen. There has been no
evidence of his death; and there is no sign that he is living."</p>

<p>"That certainly is a most singular case," I replied, and was about
to ask a question or two, when Tom Whistlewick who, without my
observing it, had been taking a ramble, returned, a great deal more
awake, and a great deal less tipsy.</p>

<p>"I say, Carmaignac, it is getting late, and I must go; I really
must, for the reason I told you&mdash;and, Beckett, we must soon meet
again."</p>

<p>"I regret very much, Monsieur, my not being able at present to
relate to you the other case, that of another tenant of the very same
room&mdash;a case more mysterious and sinister than the last&mdash;and
which occurred in the autumn of the same year."</p>

<p>"Will you both do a very good-natured thing, and come and dine with
me at the Dragon Volant tomorrow?"</p>

<p>So, as we pursued our way along the Galerie des Glaces, I extracted
their promise.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Whistlewick, when this was done; "look at that
pagoda, or sedan chair, or whatever it is, just where those fellows set
it down, and not one of them near it! I can't imagine how they tell
fortunes so devilish well. Jack Nuffles&mdash;I met him here
tonight&mdash;says they are gypsies&mdash;where are they, I wonder?
I'll go over and have a peep at the prophet."</p>

<p>I saw him plucking at the blinds, which were constructed something
on the principle of Venetian blinds; the red curtains were inside; but
they did not yield, and he could only peep under one that did not come
quite down.</p>

<p>When he rejoined us, he related: "I could scarcely see the old
fellow, it's so dark. He is covered with gold and red, and has an
embroidered hat on like a mandarin's; he's fast asleep; and, by Jove,
he smells like a polecat! It's worth going over only to have it to say.
Fiew! pooh! oh! It is a perfume. Faugh!"</p>

<p>Not caring to accept this tempting invitation, we got along slowly
toward the door. I bade them good-night, reminding them of their
promise. And so found my way at last to my carriage; and was soon
rolling slowly toward the Dragon Volant, on the loneliest of roads,
under old trees, and the soft moonlight.</p>

<p>What a number of things had happened within the last two hours! what
a variety of strange and vivid pictures were crowded together in that
brief space! What an adventure was before me!</p>

<p>The silent, moonlighted, solitary road, how it contrasted with the
many-eddied whirl of pleasure from whose roar and music, lights,
diamonds and colors I had just extricated myself.</p>

<p>The sight of lonely nature at such an hour, acts like a sudden
sedative. The madness and guilt of my pursuit struck me with a
momentary compunction and horror. I wished I had never entered the
labyrinth which was leading me, I knew not whither. It was too late to
think of that now; but the bitter was already stealing into my cup; and
vague anticipations lay, for a few minutes, heavy on my heart. It would
not have taken much to make me disclose my unmanly state of mind to my
lively friend Alfred Ogle, nor even to the milder ridicule of the
agreeable Tom Whistlewick.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-16"></a>Chapter XVI - THE PARC OF THE CH&Acirc;TEAU DE
LA CARQUE</h2>

<p>There was no danger of the Dragon Volant's closing its doors on that
occasion till three or four in the morning. There were quartered there
many servants of great people, whose masters would not leave the ball
till the last moment, and who could not return to their corners in the
Dragon Volant till their last services had been rendered.</p>

<p>I knew, therefore, I should have ample time for my mysterious
excursion without exciting curiosity by being shut out.</p>

<p>And now we pulled up under the canopy of boughs, before the sign of
the Dragon Volant, and the light that shone from its hall-door.</p>

<p>I dismissed my carriage, ran up the broad stair-case, mask in hand,
with my domino fluttering about me, and entered the large bedroom. The
black wainscoting and stately furniture, with the dark curtains of the
very tall bed, made the night there more somber.</p>

<p>An oblique patch of moonlight was thrown upon the floor from the
window to which I hastened. I looked out upon the landscape slumbering
in those silvery beams. There stood the outline of the Ch&acirc;teau de
la Carque, its chimneys and many turrets with their extinguisher-shaped
roofs black against the soft grey sky. There, also, more in the
foreground, about midway between the window where I stood and the
ch&acirc;teau, but a little to the left, I traced the tufted masses of
the grove which the lady in the mask had appointed as the
trysting-place, where I and the beautiful Countess were to meet that
night.</p>

<p>I took "the bearings" of this gloomy bit of wood, whose foliage
glimmered softly at top in the light of the moon.</p>

<p>You may guess with what a strange interest and swelling of the heart
I gazed on the unknown scene of my coming adventure.</p>

<p>But time was flying, and the hour already near. I threw my robe upon
a sofa; I groped out a pair of boots, which I substituted for those
thin heelless shoes, in those days called "pumps," without which a
gentleman could not attend an evening party. I put on my hat and,
lastly, I took a pair of loaded pistols, which I had been advised were
satisfactory companions in the then unsettled state of French society;
swarms of disbanded soldiers, some of them alleged to be desperate
characters, being everywhere to be met with. These preparations made, I
confess I took a looking-glass to the window to see how I looked in the
moonlight; and being satisfied, I replaced it, and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>In the hall I called for my servant.</p>

<p>"St. Clair," said I; "I mean to take a little moonlight ramble, only
ten minutes or so. You must not go to bed until I return. If the night
is very beautiful, I may possibly extend my ramble a little."</p>

<p>So down the steps I lounged, looking first over my right, and then
over my left shoulder, like a man uncertain which direction to take,
and I sauntered up the road, gazing now at the moon, and now at the
thin white clouds in the opposite direction, whistling, all the time,
an air which I had picked up at one of the theatres.</p>

<p>When I had got a couple of hundred yards away from the Dragon
Volant, my minstrelsy totally ceased; and I turned about, and glanced
sharply down the road, that looked as white as hoar-frost under the
moon, and saw the gable of the old inn, and a window, partly concealed
by the foliage, with a dusky light shining from it.</p>

<p>No sound of footstep was stirring; no sign of human figure in sight.
I consulted my watch, which the light was sufficiently strong to enable
me to do. It now wanted but eight minutes of the appointed hour. A
thick mantle of ivy at this point covered the wall and rose in a
clustering head at top.</p>

<p>It afforded me facilities for scaling the wall, and a partial screen
for my operations if any eye should chance to be looking that way. And
now it was done. I was in the park of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque,
as nefarious a poacher as ever trespassed on the grounds of
unsuspicious lord!</p>

<p>Before me rose the appointed grove, which looked as black as a clump
of gigantic hearse plumes. It seemed to tower higher and higher at
every step; and cast a broader and blacker shadow toward my feet. On I
marched, and was glad when I plunged into the shadow which concealed
me. Now I was among the grand old lime and chestnut trees&mdash;my
heart beat fast with expectation.</p>

<p>This grove opened, a little, near the middle; and, in the space thus
cleared, there stood with a surrounding flight of steps a small Greek
temple or shrine, with a statue in the center. It was built of white
marble with fluted Corinthian columns, and the crevices were tufted
with grass; moss had shown itself on pedestal and cornice, and signs of
long neglect and decay were apparent in its discolored and weather-worn
marble. A few feet in front of the steps a fountain, fed from the great
ponds at the other side of the ch&acirc;teau, was making a constant
tinkle and splashing in a wide marble basin, and the jet of water
glimmered like a shower of diamonds in the broken moonlight. The very
neglect and half-ruinous state of all this made it only the prettier,
as well as sadder. I was too intently watching for the arrival of the
lady, in the direction of the ch&acirc;teau, to study these things; but
the half-noted effect of them was romantic, and suggested somehow the
grotto and the fountain, and the apparition of Egeria.</p>

<p>As I watched a voice spoke to me, a little behind my left shoulder.
I turned, almost with a start, and the masque, in the costume of
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, stood there.</p>

<p>"The Countess will be here presently," she said. The lady stood upon
the open space, and the moonlight fell unbroken upon her. Nothing could
be more becoming; her figure looked more graceful and elegant than
ever. "In the meantime I shall tell you some peculiarities of her
situation. She is unhappy; miserable in an ill-assorted marriage,
with a jealous tyrant who now would constrain her to sell her diamonds,
which are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Worth thirty thousand pounds sterling. I heard all that from a
friend. Can I aid the Countess in her unequal struggle? Say but how the
greater the danger or the sacrifice, the happier will it make me.
<i>Can</i> I aid her?"</p>

<p>"If you despise a danger&mdash;which, yet, is not a danger; if you
despise, as she does, the tyrannical canons of the world; and if you
are chivalrous enough to devote yourself to a lady's cause, with no
reward but her poor gratitude; if you can do these things you can aid
her, and earn a foremost place, not in her gratitude only, but in her
friendship."</p>

<p>At those words the lady in the mask turned away and seemed to
weep.</p>

<p>I vowed myself the willing slave of the Countess. "But," I added,
"you told me she would soon be here."</p>

<p>"That is, if nothing unforeseen should happen; but with the eye of
the Count de St. Alyre in the house, and open, it is seldom safe to
stir."</p>

<p>"Does she wish to see me?" I asked, with a tender hesitation.</p>

<p>"First, say have you really thought of her, more than once, since
the adventure of the Belle &Eacute;toile?"</p>

<p>"She never leaves my thoughts; day and night her beautiful eyes
haunt me; her sweet voice is always in my ear."</p>

<p>"Mine is said to resemble hers," said the mask.</p>

<p>"So it does," I answered. "But it is only a resemblance."</p>

<p>"Oh! then mine is better?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mademoiselle, I did not say that. Yours is a sweet
voice, but I fancy a little higher."</p>

<p>"A little shriller, you would say," answered the De la
Valli&egrave;re, I fancied a good deal vexed.</p>

<p>"No, not shriller: your voice is not shrill, it is beautifully
sweet; but not so pathetically sweet as hers."</p>

<p>"That is prejudice, Monsieur; it is not true."</p>

<p>I bowed; I could not contradict a lady.</p>

<p>"I see, Monsieur, you laugh at me; you think me vain, because I
claim in some points to be equal to the Countess de St. Alyre. I
challenge you to say, my hand, at least, is less beautiful than hers."
As she thus spoke she drew her glove off, and extended her hand, back
upward, in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The lady seemed really nettled. It was undignified and irritating;
for in this uninteresting competition the precious moments were flying,
and my interview leading apparently to nothing.</p>

<p>"You will admit, then, that my hand is as beautiful as hers?"</p>

<p>"I cannot admit it. Mademoiselle," said I, with the honesty of
irritation. "I will not enter into comparisons, but the Countess de St.
Alyre is, in all respects, the most beautiful lady I ever beheld."</p>

<p>The masque laughed coldly, and then, more and more softly, said,
with a sigh, "I will prove all I say." And as she spoke she removed the
mask: and the Countess de St. Alyre, smiling, confused, bashful, more
beautiful than ever, stood before me!</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" I exclaimed. "How monstrously stupid I have been.
And it was to Madame la Comtesse that I spoke for so long in the
<i>salon!</i>" I gazed on her in silence. And with a low sweet laugh of
good nature she extended her hand. I took it and carried it to my
lips.</p>

<p>"No, you must not do that," she said quietly, "we are not old enough
friends yet. I find, although you were mistaken, that you do remember
the Countess of the Belle &Eacute;toile, and that you are a champion
true and fearless. Had you yielded to the claims just now pressed upon
you by the rivalry of Mademoiselle de la Vali&egrave;re, in her mask,
the Countess de St. Alyre should never have trusted or seen you more. I
now am sure that you are true, as well as brave. You now know that I
have not forgotten you; and, also, that if you would risk your life for
me, I, too, would brave some danger, rather than lose my friend
forever. I have but a few moments more. Will you come here again
tomorrow night, at a quarter past eleven? I will be here at that
moment; you must exercise the most scrupulous care to prevent suspicion
that you have come here, Monsieur. <i>You owe that to me</i>."</p>

<p>She spoke these last words with the most solemn entreaty.</p>

<p>I vowed again and again that I would die rather than permit the
least rashness to endanger the secret which made all the interest and
value of my life.</p>

<p>She was looking, I thought, more and more beautiful every moment. My
enthusiasm expanded in proportion.</p>

<p>"You must come tomorrow night by a different route," she said; "and
if you come again, we can change it once more. At the other side of the
ch&acirc;teau there is a little churchyard, with a ruined chapel. The
neighbors are afraid to pass it by night. The road is deserted there,
and a stile opens a way into these grounds. Cross it and you can find a
covert of thickets, to within fifty steps of this spot."</p>

<p>I promised, of course, to observe her instructions implicitly.</p>

<p>"I have lived for more than a year in an agony of irresolution. I
have decided at last. I have lived a melancholy life; a lonelier life
than is passed in the cloister. I have had no one to confide in; no one
to advise me; no one to save me from the horrors of my existence. I
have found a brave and prompt friend at last. Shall I ever forget the
heroic tableau of the hall of the Belle &Eacute;toile? Have
you&mdash;have you really kept the rose I gave you, as we parted?
Yes&mdash;you swear it. You need not; I trust you. Richard, how often
have I in solitude repeated your name, learned from my servant.
Richard, my hero! Oh! Richard! Oh, my king! I love you!"</p>

<p>I would have folded her to my heart&mdash;thrown myself at her feet.
But this beautiful and&mdash;shall I say it&mdash;inconsistent woman
repelled me.</p>

<p>"No, we must not waste our moments in extravagances. Understand my
case. There is no such thing as indifference in the married state. Not
to love one's husband," she continued, "is to hate him. The Count,
ridiculous in all else, is formidable in his jealousy. In mercy, then,
to me, observe caution. Affect to all you speak to, the most complete
ignorance of all the people in the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque; and, if
anyone in your presence mentions the Count or Countess de St. Alyre, be
sure you say you never saw either. I shall have more to say to you
tomorrow night. I have reasons that I cannot now explain, for all I do,
and all I postpone. Farewell. Go! Leave me."</p>

<p>She waved me back, peremptorily. I echoed her "farewell," and
obeyed.</p>

<p>This interview had not lasted, I think, more than ten minutes. I
scaled the park wall again, and reached the Dragon Volant before its
doors were closed.</p>

<p>I lay awake in my bed, in a fever of elation. I saw, till the dawn
broke, and chased the vision, the beautiful Countess de St. Alyre,
always in the dark, before me.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-17"></a>Chapter XVII - THE TENANT OF THE PALANQUIN</h2>

<p>The Marquis called on me next day. My late breakfast was still upon
the table. He had come, he said, to ask a favor. An accident had
happened to his carriage in the crowd on leaving the ball, and he
begged, if I were going into Paris, a seat in mine. I was going in, and
was extremely glad of his company. He came with me to my hotel; we went
up to my rooms. I was surprised to see a man seated in an easy chair,
with his back towards us, reading a newspaper. He rose. It was the
Count de St. Alyre, his gold spectacles on his nose; his black wig, in
oily curls, lying close to his narrow head, and showing like carved
ebony over a repulsive visage of boxwood. His black muffler had been
pulled down. His right arm was in a sling. I don't know whether there
was anything unusual in his countenance that day, or whether it was but
the effect of prejudice arising from all I had heard in my mysterious
interview in his park, but I thought his countenance was more
strikingly forbidding than I had seen it before.</p>

<p>I was not callous enough in the ways of sin to meet this man,
injured at least in intent, thus suddenly, without a momentary
disturbance.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I called, Monsieur Beckett, in the hope of finding you here," he
croaked, "and I meditated, I fear, taking a great liberty, but my
friend the Marquis d'Harmonville, on whom I have perhaps some claim,
will perhaps give me the assistance I require so much."</p>

<p>"With great pleasure," said the Marquis, "but not till after six
o'clock. I must go this moment to a meeting of three or four people
whom I cannot disappoint, and I know, perfectly, we cannot break up
earlier."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" exclaimed the Count, "an hour would have done it
all. Was ever <i>contretemps</i> so unlucky?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you an hour, with pleasure," said I.</p>

<p>"How very good of you, Monsieur, I hardly dare to hope it. The
business, for so gay and charming a man as Monsieur Beckett, is a
little <i>funeste</i>. Pray read this note which reached me this
morning."</p>

<p>It certainly was not cheerful. It was a note stating that the body
of his, the Count's cousin, Monsieur de St. Amand, who had died at his
house, the Ch&acirc;teau Clery, had been, in accordance with his
written directions, sent for burial at P&egrave;re la Chaise, and, with
the permission of the Count de St. Alyre, would reach his house (the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque) at about ten o'clock on the night
following, to be conveyed thence in a hearse, with any member of the
family who might wish to attend the obsequies.</p>

<p>"I did not see the poor gentleman twice in my life," said the Count,
"but this office, as he has no other kinsman, disagreeable as it is, I
could scarcely decline, and so I want to attend at the office to have
the book signed, and the order entered. But here is another misery. By
ill luck I have sprained my thumb, and can't sign my name for a week to
come. However, one name answers as well as another. Yours as well as
mine. And as you are so good as to come with me, all will go
right."</p>

<p>Away we drove. The Count gave me a memorandum of the Christian and
surnames of the deceased, his age, the complaint he died of, and the
usual particulars; also a note of the exact position in which a grave,
the dimensions of which were described, of the ordinary simple kind,
was to be dug, between two vaults belonging to the family of St. Amand.
The funeral, it was stated, would arrive at half&mdash;past one o'clock
A.M. (the next night but one); and he handed me the money, with extra
fees, for a burial by night. It was a good deal; and I asked him, as he
entrusted the whole affair to me, in whose name I should take the
receipt.</p>

<p>"Not in mine, my good friend. They wanted me to become an executor,
which I, yesterday, wrote to decline; and I am informed that if the
receipt were in my name it would constitute me an executor in the eye
of the law, and fix me in that position. Take it, pray, if you have no
objection, in your own name."</p>

<p>This, accordingly, I did.</p>

<p>You will see, by-and-by, why I am obliged to mention all
these particulars.</p>

<p>The Count, meanwhile, was leaning back in the carriage, with his
black silk muffler up to his nose, and his hat shading his eyes, while
he dozed in his corner; in which state I found him on my return.</p>

<p>Paris had lost its charm for me. I hurried through the little
business I had to do, longed once more for my quiet room in the Dragon
Volant, the melancholy woods of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque, and the
tumultuous and thrilling influence of proximity to the object of my
wild but wicked romance.</p>

<p>I was delayed some time by my stockbroker. I had a very large sum,
as I told you, at my banker's, uninvested. I cared very little for a
few day's interest&mdash;very little for the entire sum, compared with
the image that occupied my thoughts, and beckoned me with a white arm,
through the dark, toward the spreading lime trees and chestnuts of the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque. But I had fixed this day to meet him, and
was relieved when he told me that I had better let it lie in my
banker's hands for a few days longer, as the funds would certainly fall
immediately. This accident, too, was not without its immediate bearing
on my subsequent adventures.</p>

<p>When I reached the Dragon Volant, I found, in my sitting-room, a
good deal to my chagrin, my two guests, whom I had quite forgotten. I
inwardly cursed my own stupidity for having embarrassed myself with
their agreeable society. It could not be helped now, however, and a
word to the waiters put all things in train for dinner.</p>

<p>Tom Whistlewick was in great force; and he commenced almost
immediately with a very odd story.</p>

<p>He told me that not only Versailles, but all Paris was in a ferment,
in consequence of a revolting, and all but sacrilegious practical joke,
played of on the night before.</p>

<p>The pagoda, as he persisted in calling the palanquin, had been left
standing on the spot where we last saw it. Neither conjuror, nor usher,
nor bearers had ever returned. When the ball closed, and the company at
length retired, the servants who attended to put out the lights, and
secure the doors, found it still there.</p>

<p>It was determined, however, to let it stand where it was until next
morning, by which time, it was conjectured, its owners would send
messengers to remove it.</p>

<p>None arrived. The servants were then ordered to take it away; and
its extraordinary weight, for the first time, reminded them of its
forgotten human occupant. Its door was forced; and, judge what was
their disgust, when they discovered, not a living man, but a corpse!
Three or four days must have passed since the death of the burly man in
the Chinese tunic and painted cap. Some people thought it was a trick
designed to insult the Allies, in whose honor the ball was got up.
Others were of opinion that it was nothing worse than a daring and
cynical jocularity which, shocking as it was, might yet be forgiven to
the high spirits and irrepressible buffoonery of youth. Others, again,
fewer in number, and mystically given, insisted that the corpse was
<i>bona fide</i> necessary to the exhibition, and that the disclosures
and allusions which had astonished so many people were distinctly due
to necromancy.</p>

<p>"The matter, however, is now in the hands of the police," observed
Monsieur Carmaignac, "and we are not the body they were two or three
months ago, if the offenders against propriety and public feeling are
not traced and convicted, unless, indeed, they have been a great deal
more cunning than such fools generally are."</p>

<p>I was thinking within myself how utterly inexplicable was my
colloquy with the conjuror, so cavalierly dismissed by Monsieur
Carmaignac as a "fool"; and the more I thought the more marvelous it
seemed.</p>

<p>"It certainly was an original joke, though not a very clear one,"
said Whistlewick.</p>

<p>"Not even original," said Carmaignac. "Very nearly the same thing
was done, a hundred years ago or more, at a state ball in Paris; and
the rascals who played the trick were never found out."</p>

<p>In this Monsieur Carmaignac, as I afterwards discovered, spoke
truly; for, among my books of French anecdote and memoirs, the very
incident is marked by my own hand.</p>

<p>While we were thus talking the waiter told us that dinner was
served, and we withdrew accordingly; my guests more than making amends
for my comparative taciturnity.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-18"></a>Chapter XVIII - THE CHURCHYARD</h2>

<p>Our dinner was really good, so were the wines; better, perhaps, at
this out-of-the-way inn, than at some of the more pretentious hotels in
Paris. The moral effect of a really good dinner is immense&mdash;we all
felt it. The serenity and good nature that follow are more solid and
comfortable than the tumultuous benevolences of Bacchus.</p>

<p>My friends were happy, therefore, and very chatty; which latter
relieved me of the trouble of talking, and prompted them to entertain
me and one another incessantly with agreeable stories and conversation,
of which, until suddenly a subject emerged which interested me
powerfully, I confess, so much were my thoughts engaged elsewhere, I
heard next to nothing.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carmaignac, continuing a conversation which had escaped
me, "there was another case, beside that Russian nobleman, odder still.
I remembered it this morning, but cannot recall the name. He was a
tenant of the very same room. By-the-by, Monsieur, might it not be as
well," he added, turning to me with a laugh, half joke whole earnest,
as they say, "if you were to get into another apartment, now that the
house is no longer crowded? that is, if you mean to make any stay
here."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks! no. I'm thinking of changing my hotel; and I can
run into town so easily at night; and though I stay here for this night
at least, I don't expect to vanish like those others. But you say there
is another adventure, of the same kind, connected with the same room.
Do let us hear it. But take some wine first."</p>

<p>The story he told was curious.</p>

<p>"It happened," said Carmaignac, "as well as I recollect, before
either of the other cases. A French gentleman&mdash;I wish I could
remember his name&mdash;the son of a merchant, came to this inn (the
Dragon Volant), and was put by the landlord into the same room of which
we have been speaking. <i>Your</i> apartment, Monsieur. He was by no
means young&mdash;past forty&mdash;and very far from good-looking. The
people here said that he was the ugliest man, and the most
good-natured, that ever lived. He played on the fiddle, sang, and wrote
poetry. His habits were odd and desultory. He would sometimes sit all
day in his room writing, singing, and fiddling, and go out at night for
a walk. An eccentric man! He was by no means a millionaire, but he had
a <i>modicum bonum</i>, you understand&mdash;a trifle more than half a
million of francs. He consulted his stockbroker about investing this
money in foreign stocks, and drew the entire sum from his banker. You
now have the situation of affairs when the catastrophe occurred."</p>

<p>"Pray fill your glass," I said.</p>

<p>"Dutch courage, Monsieur, to face the catastrophe!" said
Whistlewick, filling his own.</p>

<p>"Now, that was the last that ever was heard of his money," resumed
Carmaignac. "You shall hear about himself. The night after this
financial operation he was seized with a poetic frenzy: he sent for the
then landlord of this house, and told him that he long meditated an
epic, and meant to commence that night, and that he was on no account
to be disturbed until nine o'clock in the morning. He had two pairs of
wax candles, a little cold supper on a side-table, his desk open, paper
enough upon it to contain the entire Henriade, and a proportionate
store of pens and ink.</p>

<p>"Seated at this desk he was seen by the waiter who brought him a cup
of coffee at nine o'clock, at which time the intruder said he was
writing fast enough to set fire to the paper&mdash;that was his phrase;
he did not look up, he appeared too much engrossed. But when the waiter
came back, half an hour afterwards, the door was locked; and the poet,
from within, answered that he must not be disturbed.</p>

<p>"Away went the <i>gar&ccedil;on</i>, and next morning at nine
o'clock knocked at his door and, receiving no answer, looked through
the key-hole; the lights were still burning, the window-shutters were
closed as he had left them; he renewed his knocking, knocked louder, no
answer came. He reported this continued and alarming silence to the
innkeeper, who, finding that his guest had not left his key in the
lock, succeeded in finding another that opened it. The candles were
just giving up the ghost in their sockets, but there was light enough
to ascertain that the tenant of the room was gone! The bed had not been
disturbed; the window-shutter was barred. He must have let himself out,
and, locking the door on the outside, put the key in his pocket, and so
made his way out of the house. Here, however, was another difficulty:
the Dragon Volant shut its doors and made all fast at twelve o'clock;
after that hour no one could leave the house, except by obtaining the
key and letting himself out, and of necessity leaving the door
unsecured, or else by collusion and aid of some person in the
house.</p>

<p>"Now it happened that, some time after the doors were secured, at
half-past twelve, a servant who had not been apprised of his order to
be left undisturbed, seeing a light shine through the key-hole, knocked
at the door to inquire whether the poet wanted anything. He was very
little obliged to his disturber, and dismissed him with a renewed
charge that he was not to be interrupted again during the night. This
incident established the fact that he was in the house after the doors
had been locked and barred. The inn-keeper himself kept the keys, and
swore that he found them hung on the wall above his head, in his bed,
in their usual place, in the morning; and that nobody could have taken
them away without awakening him. That was all we could discover. The
Count de St. Alyre, to whom this house belongs, was very active and
very much chagrined. But nothing was discovered."</p>

<p>"And nothing heard since of the epic poet?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;not the slightest clue&mdash;he never turned up
again. I suppose he is dead; if he is not, he must have got into some
devilish bad scrape, of which we have heard nothing, that compelled him
to abscond with all the secrecy and expedition in his power. All that
we know for certain is that, having occupied the room in which you
sleep, he vanished, nobody ever knew how, and never was heard of
since."</p>

<p>"You have now mentioned three cases," I said, "and all from the same
room."</p>

<p>"Three. Yes, all equally unintelligible. When men are murdered, the
great and immediate difficulty the assassins encounter is how to
conceal the body. It is very hard to believe that three persons should
have been consecutively murdered in the same room, and their bodies so
effectually disposed of that no trace of them was ever discovered."</p>

<p>From this we passed to other topics, and the grave Monsieur
Carmaignac amused us with a perfectly prodigious collection of
scandalous anecdote, which his opportunities in the police department
had enabled him to accumulate.</p>

<p>My guests happily had engagements in Paris, and left me about
ten.</p>

<p>I went up to my room, and looked out upon the grounds of the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque. The moonlight was broken by clouds, and the
view of the park in this desultory light acquired a melancholy and
fantastic character.</p>

<p>The strange anecdotes recounted of the room in which I stood by
Monsieur Carmaignac returned vaguely upon my mind, drowning in sudden
shadows the gaiety of the more frivolous stories with which he had
followed them. I looked round me on the room that lay in ominous gloom,
with an almost disagreeable sensation. I took my pistols now with an
undefined apprehension that they might be really needed before my
return tonight. This feeling, be it understood, in no wise chilled my
ardor. Never had my enthusiasm mounted higher. My adventure absorbed
and carried me away; but it added a strange and stern excitement to the
expedition.</p>

<p>I loitered for a time in my room. I had ascertained the exact point
at which the little churchyard lay. It was about a mile away. I did not
wish to reach it earlier than necessary.</p>

<p>I stole quietly out and sauntered along the road to my left, and
thence entered a narrower track, still to my left, which, skirting the
park wall and describing a circuitous route all the way, under grand
old trees, passes the ancient cemetery. That cemetery is embowered in
trees and occupies little more than half an acre of ground to the left
of the road, interposing between it and the park of the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Carque.</p>

<p>Here, at this haunted spot, I paused and listened. The place was
utterly silent. A thick cloud had darkened the moon, so that I could
distinguish little more than the outlines of near objects, and that
vaguely enough; and sometimes, as it were, floating in black fog, the
white surface of a tombstone emerged.</p>

<p>Among the forms that met my eye against the iron-grey of the
horizon, were some of those shrubs or trees that grow like our
junipers, some six feet high, in form like a miniature poplar, with the
darker foliage of the yew. I do not know the name of the plant, but I
have often seen it in such funereal places.</p>

<p>Knowing that I was a little too early, I sat down upon the edge of a
tombstone to wait, as, for aught I knew, the beautiful Countess might
have wise reasons for not caring that I should enter the grounds of the
ch&acirc;teau earlier than she had appointed. In the listless state
induced by waiting, I sat there, with my eyes on the object straight
before me, which chanced to be that faint black outline I have
described. It was right before me, about half-a-dozen steps away.</p>

<p>The moon now began to escape from under the skirt of the cloud that
had hid her face for so long; and, as the light gradually improved, the
tree on which I had been lazily staring began to take a new shape. It
was no longer a tree, but a man standing motionless. Brighter and
brighter grew the moonlight, clearer and clearer the image became, and
at last stood out perfectly distinctly. It was Colonel Gaillarde.
Luckily, he was not looking toward me. I could only see him in profile;
but there was no mistaking the white moustache, the <i>farouche</i>
visage, and the gaunt six-foot stature. There he was, his shoulder
toward me, listening and watching, plainly, for some signal or person
expected, straight in front of him.</p>

<p>If he were, by chance, to turn his eyes in my direction, I knew that
I must reckon upon an instantaneous renewal of the combat only
commenced in the hall of Belle &Eacute;toile. In any case, could
malignant fortune have posted, at this place and hour, a more dangerous
watcher? What ecstasy to him, by a single discovery, to hit me so hard,
and blast the Countess de St. Alyre, whom he seemed to hate.</p>

<p>He raised his arm; he whistled softly; I heard an answering whistle
as low; and, to my relief, the Colonel advanced in the direction of
this sound, widening the distance between us at every step; and
immediately I heard talking, but in a low and cautious key. I
recognized, I thought, even so, the peculiar voice of Gaillarde. I
stole softly forward in the direction in which those sounds were
audible. In doing so, I had, of course, to use the extremest
caution.</p>

<p>I thought I saw a hat above a jagged piece of ruined wall, and then
a second&mdash;yes, I saw two hats conversing; the voices came from
under them. They moved off, not in the direction of the park, but of
the road, and I lay along the grass, peeping over a grave, as a
skirmisher might observing the enemy. One after the other, the figures
emerged full into view as they mounted the stile at the roadside. The
Colonel, who was last, stood on the wall for awhile, looking about him,
and then jumped down on the road. I heard their steps and talk as they
moved away together, with their backs toward me, in the direction which
led them farther and farther from the Dragon Volant.</p>

<p>I waited until these sounds were quite lost in distance before I
entered the park. I followed the instructions I had received from the
Countess de St. Alyre, and made my way among brushwood and thickets to
the point nearest the ruinous temple, and crossed the short intervening
space of open ground rapidly.</p>

<p>I was now once more under the gigantic boughs of the old lime and
chestnut trees; softly, and with a heart throbbing fast, I approached
the little structure.</p>

<p>The moon was now shining steadily, pouring down its radiance on the
soft foliage, and here and there mottling the verdure under my
feet.</p>

<p>I reached the steps; I was among its worn marble shafts. She was not
there, nor in the inner sanctuary, the arched windows of which were
screened almost entirely by masses of ivy. The lady had not yet
arrived.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-19"></a>Chapter XIX - THE KEY</h2>

<p>I stood now upon the steps, watching and listening. In a minute or
two I heard the crackle of withered sticks trod upon, and, looking in
the direction, I saw a figure approaching among the trees, wrapped in a
mantle.</p>

<p>I advanced eagerly. It was the Countess. She did not speak, but gave
me her hand, and I led her to the scene of our last interview. She
repressed the ardor of my impassioned greeting with a gentle but
peremptory firmness. She removed her hood, shook back her beautiful
hair, and, gazing on me with sad and glowing eyes, sighed deeply. Some
awful thought seemed to weigh upon her,</p>

<p>"Richard, I must speak plainly. The crisis of my life has come. I am
sure you would defend me. I think you pity me; perhaps you even love
me."</p>

<p>At these words I became eloquent, as young madmen in my plight do.
She silenced me, however, with the same melancholy firmness.</p>

<p>"Listen, dear friend, and then say whether you can aid me. How madly
I am trusting you; and yet my heart tells me how wisely! To meet you
here as I do&mdash;what insanity it seems! How poorly you must think of
me! But when you know all, you will judge me fairly. Without your aid I
cannot accomplish my purpose. That purpose unaccomplished, I must die.
I am chained to a man whom I despise&mdash;whom I abhor. I have
resolved to fly. I have jewels, principally diamonds, for which I am
offered thirty thousand pounds of your English money. They are my
separate property by my marriage settlement; I will take them with me.
You are a judge, no doubt, of jewels. I was counting mine when the hour
came, and brought this in my hand to show you. Look."</p>

<p>"It is magnificent!" I exclaimed, as a collar of diamonds twinkled
and flashed in the moonlight, suspended from her pretty fingers. I
thought, even at that tragic moment, that she prolonged the show, with
a feminine delight in these brilliant toys.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I shall part with them all. I will turn them into
money and break, forever, the unnatural and wicked bonds that tied me,
in the name of a sacrament, to a tyrant. A man young, handsome,
generous, brave, as you, can hardly be rich. Richard, you say you love
me; you shall share all this with me. We will fly together to
Switzerland; we will evade pursuit; powerful friends will intervene
and arrange a separation, and shall, at length, be happy and reward my
hero."</p>

<p>You may suppose the style, florid and vehement, in which poured
forth my gratitude, vowed the devotion of my life, and placed myself
absolutely at her disposal.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night," she said, "my husband will attend the remains of
his cousin, Monsieur de St. Amand, to P&egrave;re la Chaise. The
hearse, he says, will leave this at half-past nine. You must be here,
where we stand, at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>I promised punctual obedience.</p>

<p>"I will not meet you here; but you see a red light in the window of
the tower at that angle of the ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>I assented.</p>

<p>"I placed it there, that, tomorrow night, when it comes, you may
recognize it. So soon as that rose-colored light appears at that
window, it will be a signal to you that the funeral has left the
ch&acirc;teau, and that you may approach safely. Come, then, to that
window; I will open it and admit you. Five minutes after, a
carriage, with four horses shall stand ready in the
<i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>. I will place my diamonds in your hands;
and so soon as we enter the carriage our flight commences. We shall
have at least five hours' start; and with energy, stratagem, and
resource, I fear nothing. Are you ready to undertake all this for my
sake?"</p>

<p>Again I vowed myself her slave.</p>

<p>"My only difficulty," she said, "is how we shall quickly enough
convert my diamonds into money; I dare not remove them while my husband
is in the house."</p>

<p>Here was the opportunity I wished for. I now told her that I had in
my banker's hands no less a sum than thirty thousand pounds, with
which, in the shape of gold and notes, I should come furnished, and
thus the risk and loss of disposing of her diamonds in too much haste
would be avoided.</p>

<p>"Good Heaven!" she exclaimed, with a kind of disappointment. "You
are rich, then? and I have lost the felicity of making my generous
friend more happy. Be it so! since so it must be. Let us contribute,
each, in equal shares, to our common fund. Bring you, your money; I, my
jewels. There is a happiness to me even in mingling my resources with
yours."</p>

<p>On this there followed a romantic colloquy, all poetry and passion,
such as I should in vain endeavor to reproduce. Then came a very
special instruction.</p>

<p>"I have come provided, too, with a key, the use of which I must
explain."</p>

<p>It was a double key&mdash;a long, slender stem, with a key at each
end&mdash;one about the size which opens an ordinary room door; the
other as small, almost, as the key of a dressing-case.</p>

<p>"You cannot employ too much caution tomorrow night. An interruption
would murder all my hopes. I have learned that you occupy the haunted
room in the Dragon Volant. It is the very room I would have wished you
in. I will tell you why&mdash;there is a story of a man who, having
shut himself up in that room one night, disappeared before morning. The
truth is, he wanted, I believe, to escape from creditors; and the host
of the Dragon Volant at that time, being a rogue, aided him in
absconding. My husband investigated the matter, and discovered how his
escape was made. It was by means of this key. Here is a memorandum and
a plan describing how they are to be applied. I have taken them from
the Count's escritoire. And now, once more I must leave to your
ingenuity how to mystify the people at the Dragon Volant. Be sure you
try the keys first, to see that the locks turn freely. I will have my
jewels ready. You, whatever we divide, had better bring your money,
because it may be many months before you can revisit Paris, or disclose
our place of residence to anyone: and our passports&mdash;arrange all
that; in what names, and whither, you please. And now, dear Richard"
(she leaned her arm fondly on my shoulder, and looked with ineffable
passion in my eyes, with her other hand clasped in mine), "my very life
is in your hands; I have staked all on your fidelity."</p>

<p>As she spoke the last word, she, on a sudden, grew deadly pale, and
gasped, "Good God! who is here?"</p>

<p>At the same moment she receded through the door in the marble
screen, close to which she stood, and behind which was a small roofless
chamber, as small as the shrine, the window of which was darkened by a
clustering mass of ivy so dense that hardly a gleam of light came
through the leaves.</p>

<p>I stood upon the threshold which she had just crossed, looking in
the direction in which she had thrown that one terrified glance. No
wonder she was frightened. Quite close upon us, not twenty yards away,
and approaching at a quick step, very distinctly lighted by the moon,
Colonel Gaillarde and his companion were coming. The shadow of the
cornice and a piece of wall were upon me. Unconscious of this, I was
expecting the moment when, with one of his frantic yells, he should
spring forward to assail me.</p>

<p>I made a step backward, drew one of my pistols from my pocket, and
cocked it. It was obvious he had not seen me.</p>

<p>I stood, with my finger on the trigger, determined to shoot him dead
if he should attempt to enter the place where the Countess was. It
would, no doubt, have been a murder; but, in my mind, I had no question
or qualm about it. When once we engage in secret and guilty practices
we are nearer other and greater crimes than we at all suspect.</p>

<p>"There's the statue," said the Colonel, in his brief discordant
tones. "That's the figure."</p>

<p>"Alluded to in the stanzas?" inquired his companion.</p>

<p>"The very thing. We shall see more next time. Forward, Monsieur; let
us march." And, much to my relief, the gallant Colonel turned on his
heel and marched through the trees, with his back toward the
ch&acirc;teau, striding over the grass, as I quickly saw, to the park
wall, which they crossed not far from the gables of the Dragon
Volant.</p>

<p>I found the Countess trembling in no affected, but a very real
terror. She would not hear of my accompanying her toward the
ch&acirc;teau. But I told her that I would prevent the return of the
mad Colonel; and upon that point, at least, that she need fear nothing.
She quickly recovered, again bade me a fond and lingering good-night,
and left me, gazing after her, with the key in my hand, and such a
phantasmagoria floating in my brain as amounted very nearly to
madness.</p>

<p>There was I, ready to brave all dangers, all right and reason,
plunge into murder itself, on the first summons, and entangle myself in
consequences inextricable and horrible (what cared I?) for a woman of
whom I knew nothing, but that she was beautiful and reckless!</p>

<p>I have often thanked heaven for its mercy in conducting me through
the labyrinths in which I had all but lost myself.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-20"></a>Chapter XX - A HIGH-CAULD-CAP</h2>

<p>I was now upon the road, within two or three hundred yards of the
Dragon Volant. I had undertaken an adventure with a vengeance! And by
way of prelude, there not improbably awaited me, at my inn, another
encounter, perhaps, this time, not so lucky, with the grotesque
sabreur.</p>

<p>I was glad I had my pistols. I certainly was bound by no law to
allow a ruffian to cut me down, unresisting.</p>

<p>Stooping boughs from the old park, gigantic poplars on the other
side, and the moonlight over all, made the narrow road to the inn-door
picturesque.</p>

<p>I could not think very clearly just now; events were succeeding one
another so rapidly, and I, involved in the action of a drama so
extravagant and guilty, hardly knew myself or believed my own story, as
I slowly paced towards the still open door of the Flying Dragon. No
sign of the Colonel, visible or audible, was there. In the hall I
inquired. No gentleman had arrived at the inn for the last half hour. I
looked into the public room. It was deserted. The clock struck twelve,
and I heard the servant barring the great door. I took my candle. The
lights in this rural hostelry were by this time out, and the house had
the air of one that had settled to slumber for many hours. The cold
moonlight streamed in at the window on the landing as I ascended the
broad staircase; and I paused for a moment to look over the wooded
grounds to the turreted ch&acirc;teau, to me, so full of interest. I
bethought me, however, that prying eyes might read a meaning in this
midnight gazing, and possibly the Count himself might, in his jealous
mood, surmise a signal in this unwonted light in the stair-window of
the Dragon Volant.</p>

<p>On opening my room door, with a little start, I met an extremely old
woman with the longest face I ever saw; she had what used to be termed
a high-cauld-cap on, the white border of which contrasted with her
brown and yellow skin, and made her wrinkled face more ugly. She raised
her curved shoulders, and looked up in my face, with eyes unnaturally
black and bright.</p>

<p>"I have lighted a little wood, Monsieur, because the night is
chill."</p>

<p>I thanked her, but she did not go. She stood with her candle in her
tremulous fingers.</p>

<p>"Excuse an old woman, Monsieur," she said; "but what on earth can a
young English <i>milord</i>, with all Paris at his feet, find to amuse
him in the Dragon Volant?"</p>

<p>Had I been at the age of fairy tales, and in daily intercourse with
the delightful Countess d'Aulnois, I should have seen in this withered
apparition, the <i>genius loci</i>, the malignant fairy, at the stamp
of whose foot the ill-fated tenants of this very room had, from time to
time, vanished. I was past that, however; but the old woman's dark eyes
were fixed on mine with a steady meaning that plainly told me that my
secret was known. I was embarrassed and alarmed; I never thought of
asking her what business that was of hers.</p>

<p>"These old eyes saw you in the park of the ch&acirc;teau
tonight."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>!" I began, with all the scornful surprise I could
affect.</p>

<p>"It avails nothing, Monsieur; I know why you stay here; and I tell
you to begone. Leave this house tomorrow morning, and never come
again."</p>

<p>She lifted her disengaged hand, as she looked at me with intense
horror in her eyes.</p>

<p>"There is nothing on earth&mdash;I don't know what you mean," I
answered, "and why should you care about me?"</p>

<p>"I don't care about you, Monsieur&mdash;I care about the honor of an
ancient family, whom I served in their happier days, when to be noble
was to be honored. But my words are thrown away, Monsieur; you are
insolent. I will keep my secret, and you, yours; that is all. You will
soon find it hard enough to divulge it."</p>

<p>The old woman went slowly from the room and shut the door, before I
had made up my mind to say anything. I was standing where she had left
me, nearly five minutes later. The jealousy of Monsieur the Count, I
assumed, appears to this old creature about the most terrible thing in
creation. Whatever contempt I might entertain for the dangers which
this old lady so darkly intimated, it was by no means pleasant, you may
suppose, that a secret so dangerous should be so much as suspected by a
stranger, and that stranger a partisan of the Count de St. Alyre.</p>

<p>Ought I not, at all risks, to apprise the Countess, who had trusted
me so generously, or, as she said herself, so madly, of the fact that
our secret was, at least, suspected by another? But was there not
greater danger in attempting to communicate? What did the beldame mean
by saying, "Keep your secret, and I'll keep mine?"</p>

<p>I had a thousand distracting questions before me. My progress seemed
like a journey through the Spessart, where at every step some new
goblin or monster starts from the ground or steps from behind a
tree.</p>

<p>Peremptorily I dismissed these harassing and frightful doubts. I
secured my door, sat myself down at my table and, with a candle at each
side, placed before me the piece of vellum which contained the drawings
and notes on which I was to rely for full instructions as to how to use
the key.</p>

<p>When I had studied this for awhile I made my investigation. The
angle of the room at the right side of the window was cut off by an
oblique turn in the wainscot. I examined this carefully, and, on
pressure, a small bit of the frame of the woodwork slid aside, and
disclosed a key-hole. On removing my finger, it shot back to its place
again, with a spring. So far I had interpreted my instructions
successfully. A similar search, next the door, and directly under this,
was rewarded by a like discovery. The small end of the key fitted this,
as it had the upper key-hole; and now, with two or three hard jerks at
the key, a door in the panel opened, showing a strip of the bare wall
and a narrow, arched doorway, piercing the thickness of the wall; and
within which I saw a screw staircase of stone.</p>

<p>Candle in hand I stepped in. I do not know whether the quality of
air, long undisturbed, is peculiar; to me it has always seemed so, and
the damp smell of the old masonry hung in this atmosphere. My candle
faintly lighted the bare stone wall that enclosed the stair, the foot
of which I could not see. Down I went, and a few turns brought me to
the stone floor. Here was another door, of the simple, old, oak kind,
deep sunk in the thickness of the wall. The large end of the key fitted
this. The lock was stiff; I set the candle down upon the stair, and
applied both hands; it turned with difficulty and, as it revolved,
uttered a shriek that alarmed me for my secret.</p>

<p>For some minutes I did not move. In a little time, however, I took
courage, and opened the door. The night-air floating in puffed out the
candle. There was a thicket of holly and underwood, as dense as a
jungle, close about the door. I should have been in pitch-darkness,
were it not that through the topmost leaves there twinkled, here and
there, a glimmer of moonshine.</p>

<p>Softly, lest anyone should have opened his window at the sound of
the rusty bolt, I struggled through this till I gained a view of the
open grounds. Here I found that the brushwood spread a good way up the
park, uniting with the wood that approached the little temple I have
described.</p>

<p>A general could not have chosen a more effectually-covered approach
from the Dragon Volant to the trysting-place where hitherto I had
conferred with the idol of my lawless adoration.</p>

<p>Looking back upon the old inn I discovered that the stair I
descended was enclosed in one of those slender turrets that decorate
such buildings. It was placed at that angle which corresponded with the
part of the paneling of my room indicated in the plan I had been
studying.</p>

<p>Thoroughly satisfied with my experiment I made my way back to the
door with some little difficulty, remounted to my room, locked my
secret door again; kissed the mysterious key that her hand had pressed
that night, and placed it under my pillow, upon which, very soon after,
my giddy head was laid, not, for some time, to sleep soundly.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-21"></a>Chapter XXI - I SEE THREE MEN IN A MIRROR</h2>

<p>I awoke very early next morning, and was too excited to sleep again.
As soon as I could, without exciting remark, I saw my host. I told him
that I was going into town that night, and thence to &mdash;&mdash;,
where I had to see some people on business, and requested him to
mention my being there to any friend who might call. That I expected to
be back in about a week, and that in the meantime my servant, St.
Clair, would keep the key of my room and look after my things.</p>

<p>Having prepared this mystification for my landlord, I drove into
Paris, and there transacted the financial part of the affair. The
problem was to reduce my balance, nearly thirty thousand pounds, to a
shape in which it would be not only easily portable, but available,
wherever I might go, without involving correspondence, or any other
incident which would disclose my place of residence for the time being.
All these points were as nearly provided for as, they could be. I need
not trouble you about my arrangements for passports. It is enough to
say that the point I selected for our flight was, in the spirit of
romance, one of the most beautiful and sequestered nooks in
Switzerland.</p>

<p>Luggage, I should start with none. The first considerable town we
reached next morning, would supply an extemporized wardrobe. It was now
two o'clock; <i>only</i> two! How on earth was I to dispose of the
remainder of the day?</p>

<p>I had not yet seen the cathedral of Notre Dame, and thither I drove.
I spent an hour or more there; and then to the Conciergerie, the Palais
de Justice, and the beautiful Sainte Chapelle. Still there remained
some time to get rid of, and I strolled into the narrow streets
adjoining the cathedral. I recollect seeing, in one of them, an old
house with a mural inscription stating that it had been the residence
of Canon Fulbert, the uncle of Abelard's Eloise. I don't know whether
these curious old streets, in which I observed fragments of ancient
Gothic churches fitted up as warehouses, are still extant. I lighted,
among other dingy and eccentric shops, upon one that seemed that of a
broker of all sorts of old decorations, armor, china, furniture. I
entered the shop; it was dark, dusty, and low. The proprietor was busy
scouring a piece of inlaid armor, and allowed me to poke about his
shop, and examine the curious things accumulated there, just as I
pleased. Gradually I made my way to the farther end of it, where there
was but one window with many panes, each with a bull's eye in it, and
in the dirtiest possible state. When I reached this window, I turned
about, and in a recess, standing at right angles with the side wall of
the shop, was a large mirror in an old-fashioned dingy frame. Reflected
in this I saw what in old houses I have heard termed an "alcove," in
which, among lumber and various dusty articles hanging on the wall,
there stood a table, at which three persons were seated, as it seemed
to me, in earnest conversation. Two of these persons I instantly
recognized; one was Colonel Gaillarde, the other was the Marquis
d'Harmonville. The third, who was fiddling with a pen, was a lean, pale
man, pitted with the small-pox, with lank black hair, and about as
mean-looking a person as I had ever seen in my life. The Marquis looked
up, and his glance was instantaneously followed by his two companions.
For a moment I hesitated what to do. But it was plain that I was not
recognized, as indeed I could hardly have been, the light from the
window being behind me, and the portion of the shop immediately before
me being very dark indeed.</p>

<p>Perceiving this, I had presence of mind to affect being entirely
engrossed by the objects before me, and strolled slowly down the shop
again. I paused for a moment to hear whether I was followed, and was
relieved when I heard no step. You may be sure I did not waste more
time in that shop, where I had just made a discovery so curious and so
unexpected.</p>

<p>It was no business of mine to inquire what brought Colonel Gaillarde
and the Marquis together, in so shabby and even dirty a place, or who
the mean person, biting the feather end of his pen, might be. Such
employments as the Marquis had accepted sometimes make strange
bed-fellows.</p>

<p>I was glad to get away, and just as the sun set I had reached the
steps of the Dragon Volant, and dismissed the vehicle in which I
arrived, carrying in my hand a strong box, of marvelously small
dimensions considering all it contained, strapped in a leather cover
which disguised its real character.</p>

<p>When I got to my room I summoned St. Clair. I told him nearly the
same story I had already told my host. I gave him fifty pounds, with
orders to expend whatever was necessary on himself, and in payment for
my rooms till my return. I then ate a slight and hasty dinner. My eyes
were often upon the solemn old clock over the chimney-piece, which was
my sole accomplice in keeping tryst in this iniquitous venture. The sky
favored my design, and darkened all things with a sea of clouds.</p>

<p>The innkeeper met me in the hall, to ask whether I should want a
vehicle to Paris? I was prepared for this question, and instantly
answered that I meant to walk to Versailles and take a carriage there.
I called St. Clair.</p>

<p>"Go," said I, "and drink a bottle of wine with your friends. I shall
call you if I should want anything; in the meantime, here is the key to
my room; I shall be writing some notes, so don't allow anyone to
disturb me for at least half an hour. At the end of that time you will
probably find that I have left this for Versailles; and should you not
find me in the room, you may take that for granted; and you take charge
of everything, and lock the door, you understand?"</p>

<p>St. Clair took his leave, wishing me all happiness, and no doubt
promising himself some little amusement with my money. With my candle
in my hand, I hastened upstairs. It wanted now but five minutes to the
appointed time. I do not think there is anything of the coward in my
nature; but I confess, as the crisis approached, I felt something of
the suspense and awe of a soldier going into action. Would I have
receded? Not for all this earth could offer.</p>

<p>I bolted my door, put on my greatcoat, and placed my pistols one in
each pocket. I now applied my key to the secret locks; drew the
wainscot door a little open, took my strong box under my arm,
extinguished my candle, unbolted my door, listened at it for a few
moments to be sure that no one was approaching, and then crossed the
floor of my room swiftly, entered the secret door, and closed the
spring lock after me. I was upon the screw-stair in total darkness, the
key in my fingers. Thus far the undertaking was successful.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-22"></a>Chapter XXII - RAPTURE</h2>

<p>Down the screw-stair I went in utter darkness; and having reached
the stone floor I discerned the door and groped out the key-hole. With
more caution, and less noise than upon the night before, I opened the
door and stepped out into the thick brushwood. It was almost as dark in
this jungle.</p>

<p>Having secured the door I slowly pushed my way through the bushes,
which soon became less dense. Then, with more care, but still under
thick cover, I pursued in the track of the wood, keeping near its
edge.</p>

<p>At length, in the darkened air, about fifty yards away, the shafts
of the marble temple rose like phantoms before me, seen through the
trunks of the old trees. Everything favored my enterprise. I had
effectually mystified my servant and the people of the Dragon Volant,
and so dark was the night, that even had I alarmed the suspicions of
all the tenants of the inn, I might safely defy their united curiosity,
though posted at every window of the house.</p>

<p>Through the trunks, over the roots of the old trees, I reached the
appointed place of observation. I laid my treasure in its leathern case
in the embrasure, and leaning my arms upon it, looked steadily in the
direction of the ch&acirc;teau. The outline of the building was
scarcely discernible, blending dimly, as it did, with the sky. No light
in any window was visible. I was plainly to wait; but for how long?</p>

<p>Leaning on my box of treasure, gazing toward the massive shadow that
represented the ch&acirc;teau, in the midst of my ardent and elated
longings, there came upon me an odd thought, which you will think might
well have struck me long before. It seemed on a sudden, as it came,
that the darkness deepened, and a chill stole into the air around
me.</p>

<p>Suppose I were to disappear finally, like those other men whose
stories I had listened to! Had I not been at all the pains that mortal
could to obliterate every trace of my real proceedings, and to mislead
everyone to whom I spoke as to the direction in which I had gone?</p>

<p>This icy, snake-like thought stole through my mind, and was
gone.</p>

<p>It was with me the full-blooded season of youth, conscious strength,
rashness, passion, pursuit, the adventure! Here were a pair of
double-barreled pistols, four lives in my hands? What could possibly
happen? The Count&mdash;except for the sake of my dulcinea, what was it
to me whether the old coward whom I had seen, in an ague of terror
before the brawling Colonel, interposed or not? I was assuming the
worst that could happen. But with an ally so clever and courageous as
my beautiful Countess, could any such misadventure befall? Bah! I
laughed at all such fancies.</p>

<p>As I thus communed with myself, the signal light sprang up. The
rose-colored light, <i>couleur de rose</i>, emblem of sanguine hope and
the dawn of a happy day.</p>

<p>Clear, soft, and steady, glowed the light from the window. The stone
shafts showed black against it. Murmuring words of passionate love as I
gazed upon the signal, I grasped my strong box under my arm, and with
rapid strides approached the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque. No sign of
light or life, no human voice, no tread of foot, no bark of dog
indicated a chance of interruption. A blind was down; and as I came
close to the tall window, I found that half-a-dozen steps led up to it,
and that a large lattice, answering for a door, lay open.</p>

<p>A shadow from within fell upon the blind; it was drawn aside, and as
I ascended the steps, a soft voice murmured&mdash;"Richard, dearest
Richard, come, oh! come! how I have longed for this moment!"</p>

<p>Never did she look so beautiful. My love rose to passionate
enthusiasm. I only wished there were some real danger in the adventure
worthy of such a creature. When the first tumultuous greeting was over,
she made me sit beside her on a sofa. There we talked for a minute or
two. She told me that the Count had gone, and was by that time more
than a mile on his way, with the funeral, to P&egrave;re la Chaise.
Here were her diamonds. She exhibited, hastily, an open casket
containing a profusion of the largest brilliants.</p>

<p>"What is this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A box containing money to the amount of thirty thousand pounds," I
answered.</p>

<p>"What! all that money?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Every <i>sou</i>."</p>

<p>"Was it not unnecessary to bring so much, seeing all these?" she
said, touching her diamonds. "It would have been kind of you to allow
me to provide for both, for a time at least. It would have made me
happier even than I am."</p>

<p>"Dearest, generous angel!" Such was my extravagant declamation. "You
forget that it may be necessary, for a long time, to observe silence as
to where we are, and impossible to communicate safely with anyone."</p>

<p>"You have then here this great sum&mdash;are you certain; have you
counted it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; I received it today," I answered, perhaps showing a
little surprise in my face. "I counted it, of course, on drawing it
from my bankers."</p>

<p>"It makes me feel a little nervous, traveling with so much money;
but these jewels make as great a danger; that can add but little to it.
Place them side by side; you shall take off your greatcoat when we are
ready to go, and with it manage to conceal these boxes. I should not
like the drivers to suspect that we were conveying such a treasure. I
must ask you now to close the curtains of that window, and bar the
shutters."</p>

<p>I had hardly done this when a knock was heard at the room door.</p>

<p>"I know who this is," she said, in a whisper to me.</p>

<p>I saw that she was not alarmed. She went softly to the door, and a
whispered conversation for a minute followed.</p>

<p>"My trusty maid, who is coming with us. She says we cannot safely go
sooner than ten minutes. She is bringing some coffee to the next
room."</p>

<p>She opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>"I must tell her not to take too much luggage. She is so odd! Don't
follow&mdash;stay where you are&mdash;it is better that she should not
see you."</p>

<p>She left the room with a gesture of caution.</p>

<p>A change had come over the manner of this beautiful woman. For the
last few minutes a shadow had been stealing over her, an air of
abstraction, a look bordering on suspicion. Why was she pale? Why had
there come that dark look in her eyes? Why had her very voice become
changed? Had anything gone suddenly wrong? Did some danger
threaten?</p>

<p>This doubt, however, speedily quieted itself. If there had been
anything of the kind, she would, of course, have told me. It was only
natural that, as the crisis approached, she should become more and more
nervous. She did not return quite so soon as I had expected. To a man
in my situation absolute quietude is next to impossible. I moved
restlessly about the room. It was a small one. There was a door at the
other end. I opened it, rashly enough. I listened, it was perfectly
silent. I was in an excited, eager state, and every faculty engrossed
about what was coming, and in so far detached from the immediate
present. I can't account, in any other way, for my having done so many
foolish things that night, for I was, naturally, by no means deficient
in cunning. About the most stupid of those was, that instead of
immediately closing that door, which I never ought to have opened, I
actually took a candle and walked into the room.</p>

<p>There I made, quite unexpectedly, a rather startling discovery.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-23"></a>Chapter XXIII - A CUP OF COFFEE</h2>

<p>The room was carpetless. On the floor were a quantity of shavings,
and some score of bricks. Beyond these, on a narrow table, lay an
object which I could hardly believe I saw aright.</p>

<p>I approached and drew from it a sheet which had very slightly
disguised its shape. There was no mistake about it. It was a coffin;
and on the lid was a plate, with the inscription in French:</p>

<p>PIERRE DE LA ROCHE ST. AMAND.<br>
&Acirc;G&Eacute; DE XXIII ANS.</p>

<p>I drew back with a double shock. So, then, the funeral after all had
not yet left! Here lay the body. I had been deceived. This, no doubt,
accounted for the embarrassment so manifest in the Countess's manner.
She would have done more wisely had she told me the true state of the
case.</p>

<p>I drew back from this melancholy room, and closed the door. Her
distrust of me was the worst rashness she could have committed. There
is nothing more dangerous than misapplied caution. In entire ignorance
of the fact I had entered the room, and there I might have lighted upon
some of the very persons it was our special anxiety that I should
avoid.</p>

<p>These reflections were interrupted, almost as soon as began, by the
return of the Countess de St. Alyre. I saw at a glance that she
detected in my face some evidence of what had happened, for she threw a
hasty look towards the door.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything&mdash;anything to disturb you, dear Richard?
Have you been out of this room?"</p>

<p>I answered promptly, "Yes," and told her frankly what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Well, I did not like to make you more uneasy than necessary.
Besides, it is disgusting and horrible. The body is there; but the
Count had departed a quarter of an hour before I lighted the colored
lamp, and prepared to receive you. The body did not arrive till eight
or ten minutes after he had set out. He was afraid lest the people at
P&egrave;re la Chaise should suppose that the funeral was postponed. He
knew that the remains of poor Pierre would certainly reach this
tonight, although an unexpected delay has occurred; and there are
reasons why he wishes the funeral completed before tomorrow. The hearse
with the body must leave this in ten minutes. So soon as it is gone, we
shall be free to set out upon our wild and happy journey. The horses
are to the carriage in the <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>. As for this
<i>funeste</i> horror" (she shuddered very prettily), "let us think of
it no more."</p>

<p>She bolted the door of communication, and when she turned it was
with such a pretty penitence in her face and attitude, that I was ready
to throw myself at her feet.</p>

<p>"It is the last time," she said, in a sweet sad little pleading, "I
shall ever practice a deception on my brave and beautiful
Richard&mdash;my hero! Am I forgiven?"</p>

<p>Here was another scene of passionate effusion, and lovers' raptures
and declamations, but only murmured lest the ears of listeners should
be busy.</p>

<p>At length, on a sudden, she raised her hand, as if to prevent my
stirring, her eyes fixed on me and her ear towards the door of the room
in which the coffin was placed, and remained breathless in that
attitude for a few moments. Then, with a little nod towards me, she
moved on tip-toe to the door, and listened, extending her hand backward
as if to warn me against advancing; and, after a little time, she
returned, still on tip-toe, and whispered to me, "They are removing the
coffin&mdash;come with me."</p>

<p>I accompanied her into the room from which her maid, as she told me,
had spoken to her. Coffee and some old china cups, which appeared to me
quite beautiful, stood on a silver tray; and some liqueur glasses, with
a flask, which turned out to be noyau, on a salver beside it.</p>

<p>"I shall attend you. I'm to be your servant here; I am to have my
own way; I shall not think myself forgiven by my darling if he refuses
to indulge me in anything."</p>

<p>She filled a cup with coffee and handed it to me with her left hand;
her right arm she fondly passed over my shoulder, and with her fingers
through my curls, caressingly, she whispered, "Take this, I shall take
some just now."</p>

<p>It was excellent; and when I had done she handed me the liqueur,
which I also drank.</p>

<p>"Come back, dearest, to the next room," she said. "By this time
those terrible people must have gone away, and we shall be safer there,
for the present, than here."</p>

<p>"You shall direct, and I obey; you shall command me, not only now,
but always, and in all things, my beautiful queen!" I murmured.</p>

<p>My heroics were unconsciously, I daresay, founded upon my ideal of
the French school of lovemaking. I am, even now, ashamed as I recall
the bombast to which I treated the Countess de St. Alyre.</p>

<p>"There, you shall have another miniature glass&mdash;a fairy
glass&mdash;of noyau," she said gaily. In this volatile creature, the
funereal gloom of the moment before, and the suspense of an adventure
on which all her future was staked, disappeared in a moment. She ran
and returned with another tiny glass, which, with an eloquent or tender
little speech, I placed to my lips and sipped.</p>

<p>I kissed her hand, I kissed her lips, I gazed in her beautiful eyes,
and kissed her again unresisting.</p>

<p>"You call me Richard, by what name am I to call my beautiful
divinity?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You call me Eugenie, it is my name. Let us be quite real; that is,
if you love as entirely as I do."</p>

<p>"Eugenie!" I exclaimed, and broke into a new rapture upon the
name.</p>

<p>It ended by my telling her how impatient I was to set out upon our
journey; and, as I spoke, suddenly an odd sensation overcame me. It was
not in the slightest degree like faintness. I can find no phrase to
describe it, but a sudden constraint of the brain; it was as if the
membrane in which it lies, if there be such a thing, contracted, and
became inflexible.</p>

<p>"Dear Richard! what is the matter?" she exclaimed, with terror in
her looks. "Good Heavens! are you ill? I conjure you, sit down; sit in
this chair." She almost forced me into one; I was in no condition to
offer the least resistance. I recognized but too truly the sensations
that supervened. I was lying back in the chair in which I sat, without
the power, by this time, of uttering a syllable, of closing my eyelids,
of moving my eyes, of stirring a muscle. I had in a few seconds glided
into precisely the state in which I had passed so many appalling hours
when approaching Paris, in my night-drive with the Marquis
d'Harmonville.</p>

<p>Great and loud was the lady's agony. She seemed to have lost all
sense of fear. She called me by my name, shook me by the shoulder,
raised my arm and let it fall, all the time imploring of me, in
distracting sentences, to make the slightest sign of life, and vowing
that if I did not, she would make away with herself.</p>

<p>These ejaculations, after a minute or two, suddenly subsided. The
lady was perfectly silent and cool. In a very business-like way she
took a candle and stood before me, pale indeed, very pale, but with an
expression only of intense scrutiny with a dash of horror in it. She
moved the candle before my eyes slowly, evidently watching the effect.
She then set it down, and rang a handbell two or three times sharply.
She placed the two cases (I mean hers containing the jewels and my
strong box) side by side on the table; and I saw her carefully lock the
door that gave access to the room in which I had just now sipped my
coffee.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-24"></a>Chapter XXIV - HOPE</h2>

<p>She had scarcely set down my heavy box, which she seemed to have
considerable difficulty in raising on the table, when the door of the
room in which I had seen the coffin, opened, and a sinister and
unexpected apparition entered.</p>

<p>It was the Count de St. Alyre, who had been, as I have told you,
reported to me to be, for some considerable time, on his way to
P&egrave;e la Chaise. He stood before me for a moment, with the frame
of the doorway and a background of darkness enclosing him like a
portrait. His slight, mean figure was draped in the deepest mourning.
He had a pair of black gloves in his hand, and his hat with crape round
it.</p>

<p>When he was not speaking his face showed signs of agitation; his
mouth was puckering and working. He looked damnably wicked and
frightened.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Eugenie? Well, child&mdash;eh? Well, it all goes
admirably?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, in a low, hard tone. "But you and Planard
should not have left that door open."</p>

<p>This she said sternly. "He went in there and looked about wherever
he liked; it was fortunate he did not move aside the lid of the
coffin."</p>

<p>"Planard should have seen to that," said the Count, sharply. "<i>Ma
foi!</i> I can't be everywhere!" He advanced half-a-dozen short quick
steps into the room toward me, and placed his glasses to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Beckett," he cried sharply, two or three times, "Hi! don't
you know me?"</p>

<p>He approached and peered more closely in my face; raised my hand and
shook it, calling me again, then let it drop, and said: "It has set in
admirably, my pretty <i>mignonne</i>. When did it commence?"</p>

<p>The Countess came and stood beside him, and looked at me steadily
for some seconds. You can't conceive the effect of the silent gaze of
those two pairs of evil eyes.</p>

<p>The lady glanced to where, I recollected, the mantel piece stood,
and upon it a clock, the regular click of which I sharply heard.
"Four&mdash;five&mdash;six minutes and a half," she said slowly, in a
cold hard way.</p>

<p>"Brava! Bravissima! my beautiful queen! my little Venus! my Joan of
Arc! my heroine! my paragon of women!"</p>

<p>He was gloating on me with an odious curiosity, smiling, as he
groped backward with his thin brown fingers to find the lady's hand;
but she, not (I dare say) caring for his caresses, drew back a
little.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>ma ch&egrave;re,</i> let us count these things. What is
it? Pocket-book? Or&mdash;or&mdash;<i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"It is <i>that</i>!" said the lady, pointing with a look of disgust
to the box, which lay in its leather case on the table.</p>

<p>"Oh! Let us see&mdash;let us count&mdash;let us see," he said, as he
was unbuckling the straps with his tremulous fingers. "We must count
them&mdash;we must see to it. I have pencil and
pocket-book&mdash;but&mdash;where's the key? See this cursed lock!
My&mdash;! What is it? Where's the key?"</p>

<p>He was standing before the Countess, shuffling his feet, with his
hands extended and all his fingers quivering.</p>

<p>"I have not got it; how could I? It is in his pocket, of course,"
said the lady.</p>

<p>In another instant the fingers of the old miscreant were in my
pockets; he plucked out everything they contained, and some keys among
the rest.</p>

<p>I lay in precisely the state in which I had been during my drive
with the Marquis to Paris. This wretch, I knew, was about to rob me.
The whole drama, and the Countess's <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in it, I could
not yet comprehend. I could not be sure&mdash;so much more presence of
mind and histrionic resource have women than fall to the lot of our
clumsy sex&mdash;whether the return of the Count was not, in truth, a
surprise to her; and this scrutiny of the contents of my strong box, an
extempore undertaking of the Count's. But it was clearing more and more
every moment: and I was destined, very soon, to comprehend minutely my
appalling situation.</p>

<p>I had not the power of turning my eyes this way or that, the
smallest fraction of a hair's breadth. But let anyone, placed as I was
at the end of a room, ascertain for himself by experiment how wide is
the field of sight, without the slightest alteration in the line of
vision, he will find that it takes in the entire breadth of a large
room, and that up to a very short distance before him; and imperfectly,
by a refraction, I believe, in the eye itself, to a point very near
indeed. Next to nothing that passed in the room, therefore, was hidden
from me.</p>

<p>The old man had, by this time, found the key. The leather case was
open. The box cramped round with iron was next unlocked. He turned out
its contents upon the table.</p>

<p>"Rouleaux of a hundred Napoleons each. One, two, three. Yes, quick.
Write down a thousand Napoleons. One, two; yes, right. Another
thousand, <i>write</i>!" And so on and on till the gold was rapidly
counted. Then came the notes.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand francs. <i>Write</i>. Then thousand francs again. Is
it written? Another ten thousand francs: is it down? Smaller notes
would have been better. They should have been smaller. These are
horribly embarrassing. Bolt that door again; Planard would become
unreasonable if he knew the amount. Why did you not tell him to get it
in smaller notes? No matter now&mdash;go on&mdash;it can't be
helped&mdash;<i>write</i>&mdash;another ten thousand
francs&mdash;another&mdash;another." And so on, till my treasure was
counted out before my face, while I saw and heard all that passed with
the sharpest distinctness, and my mental perceptions were horribly
vivid. But in all other respects I was dead.</p>

<p>He had replaced in the box every note and rouleau as he counted it,
and now, having ascertained the sum total, he locked it, replaced it
very methodically in its cover, opened a buffet in the wainscoting,
and, having placed the Countess' jewel-case and my strong box in it, he
locked it; and immediately on completing these arrangements he began to
complain, with fresh acrimony and maledictions of Planard's delay.</p>

<p>He unbolted the door, looked in the dark room beyond, and listened.
He closed the door again and returned. The old man was in a fever of
suspense.</p>

<p>"I have kept ten thousand francs for Planard," said the Count,
touching his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"Will that satisfy him?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;curse him!" screamed the Count. "Has he no conscience?
I'll swear to him it's half the entire thing."</p>

<p>He and the lady again came and looked at me anxiously for a while,
in silence; and then the old Count began to grumble again about
Planard, and to compare his watch with the clock. The lady seemed less
impatient; she sat no longer looking at me, but across the room, so
that her profile was toward me&mdash;and strangely changed, dark and
witch-like it looked. My last hope died as I beheld that jaded face
from which the mask had dropped. I was certain that they intended to
crown their robbery by murder. Why did they not dispatch me at once?
What object could there be in postponing the catastrophe which would
expedite their own safety. I cannot recall, even to myself, adequately
the horrors unutterable that I underwent. You must suppose a real
night-mare&mdash;I mean a night-mare in which the objects and the
danger are real, and the spell of corporal death appears to be
protractible at the pleasure of the persons who preside at your
unearthly torments. I could have no doubt as to the cause of the state
in which I was.</p>

<p>In this agony, to which I could not give the slightest expression, I
saw the door of the room where the coffin had been, open slowly, and
the Marquis d'Harmonville entered the room.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-25"></a>Chapter XXV - DESPAIR</h2>

<p>A moment's hope, hope violent and fluctuating, hope that was nearly
torture, and then came a dialogue, and with it the terrors of
despair.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, Planard, you have come at last," said the Count,
taking him with both hands by the arm, and clinging to it and drawing
him toward me. "See, look at him. It has all gone sweetly, sweetly,
sweetly up to this. Shall I hold the candle for you?"</p>

<p>My friend d'Harmonville, Planard, whatever he was, came to me,
pulling off his gloves, which he popped into his pocket.</p>

<p>"The candle, a little this way," he said, and stooping over me he
looked earnestly in my face. He touched my forehead, drew his hand
across it, and then looked in my eyes for a time.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor, what do you think?" whispered the Count.</p>

<p>"How much did you give him?" said the Marquis, thus suddenly stunted
down to a doctor.</p>

<p>"Seventy drops," said the lady.</p>

<p>"In the hot coffee?"</p>

<p>"Yes; sixty in a hot cup of coffee and ten in the liqueur."</p>

<p>Her voice, low and hard, seemed to me to tremble a little. It takes
a long course of guilt to subjugate nature completely, and prevent
those exterior signs of agitation that outlive all good.</p>

<p>The doctor, however, was treating me as coolly as he might a subject
which he was about to place on the dissecting-table for a lecture.</p>

<p>He looked into my eyes again for awhile, took my wrist, and applied
his fingers to the pulse.</p>

<p>"That action suspended," he said to himself.</p>

<p>Then again he placed something, that for the moment I saw it looked
like a piece of gold-beater's leaf, to my lips, holding his head so far
that his own breathing could not affect it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in soliloquy, very low.</p>

<p>Then he plucked my shirt-breast open and applied the stethoscope,
shifted it from point to point, listened with his ear to its end, as if
for a very far-off sound, raised his head, and said, in like manner,
softly to himself, "All appreciable action of the lungs has
subsided."</p>

<p>Then turning from the sound, as I conjectured, he said:</p>

<p>"Seventy drops, allowing ten for waste, ought to hold him fast for
six hours and a half that is ample. The experiment I tried in the
carriage was only thirty drops, and showed a highly sensitive brain. It
would not do to kill him, you know. You are certain you did not exceed
<i>seventy</i>?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said the lady.</p>

<p>"If he were to die the evaporation would be arrested, and foreign
matter, some of it poisonous, would be found in the stomach, don't you
see? If you are doubtful, it would be well to use the
stomach-pump."</p>

<p>"Dearest Eugenie, be frank, be frank, do be frank," urged the
Count.</p>

<p>"I am <i>not</i> doubtful, I am <i>certain</i>," she answered.</p>

<p>"How long ago, exactly? I told you to observe the time."</p>

<p>"I did; the minute-hand was exactly there, under the point of that
Cupid's foot."</p>

<p>"It will last, then, probably for seven hours. He will recover then;
the evaporation will be complete, and not one particle of the fluid
will remain in the stomach."</p>

<p>It was reassuring, at all events, to hear that there was no
intention to murder me. No one who has not tried it knows the terror of
the approach of death, when the mind is clear, the instincts of life
unimpaired, and no excitement to disturb the appreciation of that
entirely new horror.</p>

<p>The nature and purpose of this tenderness was very, very peculiar,
and as yet I had not a suspicion of it.</p>

<p>"You leave France, I suppose?" said the ex-Marquis.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, tomorrow," answered the Count.</p>

<p>"And where do you mean to go?"</p>

<p>"That I have not yet settled," he answered quickly.</p>

<p>"You won't tell a friend, eh?"</p>

<p>"I can't till I know. This has turned out an unprofitable
affair."</p>

<p>"We shall settle that by-and-by."</p>

<p>"It is time we should get him lying down, eh," said the Count,
indicating me with one finger.</p>

<p>"Yes, we must proceed rapidly now. Are his night-shirt and
night-cap&mdash;you understand&mdash;here?"</p>

<p>"All ready," said the Count.</p>

<p>"Now, Madame," said the doctor, turning to the lady, and making her,
in spite of the emergency, a bow, "it is time you should retire."</p>

<p>The lady passed into the room in which I had taken my cup of
treacherous coffee, and I saw her no more. The Count took a candle and
passed through the door at the further end of the room, returning with
a roll of linen in his hand. He bolted first one door then the
other.</p>

<p>They now, in silence, proceeded to undress me rapidly. They were not
many minutes in accomplishing this.</p>

<p>What the doctor had termed my night-shirt, a long garment which
reached below my feet, was now on, and a cap, that resembled a female
nightcap more than anything I had ever seen upon a male head, was
fitted upon mine, and tied under my chin.</p>

<p>And now, I thought, I shall be laid in a bed to recover how I can,
and, in the meantime, the conspirators will have escaped with their
booty, and pursuit be in vain.</p>

<p>This was my best hope at the time; but it was soon clear that their
plans were very different. The Count and Planard now went, together,
into the room that lay straight before me. I heard them talking low,
and a sound of shuffling feet; then a long rumble; it suddenly stopped;
it recommenced; it continued; side by side they came in at the door,
their backs toward me. They were dragging something along the floor
that made a continued boom and rumble, but they interposed between me
and it, so that I could not see it until they had dragged it almost
beside me; and then, merciful heaven! I saw it plainly enough. It was
the coffin I had seen in the next room. It lay now flat on the floor,
its edge against the chair in which I sat. Planard removed the lid. The
coffin was empty.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c4-26"></a>Chapter XXVI - CATASTROPHE</h2>

<p>"Those seem to be good horses, and we change on the way," said
Planard. "You give the men a Napoleon or two; we must do it within
three hours and a quarter. Now, come; I'll lift him upright, so as to
place his feet in their proper berth, and you must keep them together
and draw the white shirt well down over them."</p>

<p>In another moment I was placed, as he described, sustained in
Planard's arms, standing at the foot of the coffin, and so lowered
backward, gradually, till I lay my length in it. Then the man, whom he
called Planard, stretched my arms by my sides, and carefully arranged
the frills at my breast and the folds of the shroud, and after that,
taking his stand at the foot of the coffin made a survey which seemed
to satisfy him.</p>

<p>The Count, who was very methodical, took my clothes, which had just
been removed, folded them rapidly together and locked them up, as I
afterwards heard, in one of the three presses which opened by doors in
the panel.</p>

<p>I now understood their frightful plan. This coffin had been prepared
for me; the funeral of St. Amand was a sham to mislead inquiry; I had
myself given the order at P&egrave;re la Chaise, signed it, and paid
the fees for the interment of the fictitious Pierre de St. Amand, whose
place I was to take, to lie in his coffin with his name on the plate
above my breast, and with a ton of clay packed down upon me; to waken
from this catalepsy, after I had been for hours in the grave, there to
perish by a death the most horrible that imagination can conceive.</p>

<p>If, hereafter, by any caprice of curiosity or suspicion, the coffin
should be exhumed, and the body it enclosed examined, no chemistry
could detect a trace of poison, nor the most cautious examination the
slightest mark of violence.</p>

<p>I had myself been at the utmost pains to mystify inquiry, should my
disappearance excite surmises, and had even written to my few
correspondents in England to tell them that they were not to look for a
letter from me for three weeks at least.</p>

<p>In the moment of my guilty elation death had caught me, and there
was no escape. I tried to pray to God in my unearthly panic, but only
thoughts of terror, judgment, and eternal anguish crossed the
distraction of my immediate doom.</p>

<p>I must not try to recall what is indeed indescribable&mdash;the
multiform horrors of my own thoughts. I will relate, simply, what
befell, every detail of which remains sharp in my memory as if cut in
steel.</p>

<p>"The undertaker's men are in the hall," said the Count.</p>

<p>"They must not come till this is fixed," answered Planard. "Be good
enough to take hold of the lower part while I take this end." I was not
left long to conjecture what was coming, for in a few seconds more
something slid across, a few inches above my face, and entirely
excluded the light, and muffled sound, so that nothing that was not
very distinct reached my ears henceforward; but very distinctly came
the working of a turnscrew, and the crunching home of screws in
succession. Than these vulgar sounds, no doom spoken in thunder could
have been more tremendous.</p>

<p>The rest I must relate, not as it then reached my ears, which was
too imperfectly and interruptedly to supply a connected narrative, but
as it was afterwards told me by other people.</p>

<p>The coffin-lid being screwed down, the two gentlemen arranged the
room and adjusted the coffin so that it lay perfectly straight along
the boards, the Count being specially anxious that there should be no
appearance of hurry or disorder in the room, which might have suggested
remark and conjecture.</p>

<p>When this was done, Doctor Planard said he would go to the hall to
summon the men who were to carry the coffin out and place it in the
hearse. The Count pulled on his black gloves, and held his white
handkerchief in his hand, a very impressive chief-mourner. He stood a
little behind the head of the coffin, awaiting the arrival of the
persons who accompanied Planard, and whose fast steps he soon heard
approaching.</p>

<p>Planard came first. He entered the room through the apartment in
which the coffin had been originally placed. His manner was changed;
there was something of a swagger in it.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte," he said, as he strode through the door,
followed by half-a-dozen persons, "I am sorry to have to announce to
you a most unseasonable interruption. Here is Monsieur Carmaignac, a
gentleman holding an office in the police department, who says that
information to the effect that large quantities of smuggled English and
other goods have been distributed in this neighborhood, and that a
portion of them is concealed in your house. I have ventured to assure
him, of my own knowledge, that nothing can be more false than that
information, and that you would be only too happy to throw open for his
inspection, at a moment's notice, every room, closet, and cupboard in
your house."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," exclaimed the Count, with a stout voice, but a
very white face. "Thank you, my good friend, for having anticipated me.
I will place my house and keys at his disposal, for the purpose of his
scrutiny, so soon as he is good enough to inform me of what specific
contraband goods he comes in search."</p>

<p>"The Count de St. Alyre will pardon me," answered Carmaignac, a
little dryly. "I am forbidden by my instructions to make that
disclosure; and that I <i>am</i> instructed to make a general search,
this warrant will sufficiently apprise Monsieur le Comte."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Carmaignac, may I hope," interposed Planard, "that you
will permit the Count de St. Alyre to attend the funeral of his
kinsman, who lies here, as you see&mdash;" (he pointed to the plate
upon the coffin)&mdash;"and to convey whom to Pre la Chaise, a hearse
waits at this moment at the door."</p>

<p>"That, I regret to say, I cannot permit. My instructions are
precise; but the delay, I trust, will be but trifling. Monsieur le
Comte will not suppose for a moment that I suspect him; but we have a
duty to perform, and I must act as if I did. When I am ordered to
search, I search; things are sometimes hid in such bizarre places. I
can't say, for instance, what that coffin may contain."</p>

<p>"The body of my kinsman, Monsieur Pierre de St. Amand," answered the
Count, loftily.</p>

<p>"Oh! then you've seen him?"</p>

<p>"Seen him? Often, too often." The Count was evidently a good deal
moved.</p>

<p>"I mean the body?"</p>

<p>The Count stole a quick glance at Planard.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, Monsieur&mdash;that is, I mean only for a moment."</p>

<p>Another quick glance at Planard.</p>

<p>"But quite long enough, I fancy, to recognize him?" insinuated that
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course; instantly&mdash;perfectly. What! Pierre
de St. Amand? Not know him at a glance? No, no, poor fellow, I know him
too well for that."</p>

<p>"The things I am in search of," said Monsieur Carmaignac, "would fit
in a narrow compass&mdash;servants are so ingenious sometimes. Let us
raise the lid."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Monsieur," said the Count, peremptorily, advancing to
the side of the coffin and extending his arm across it, "I cannot
permit that indignity&mdash;that desecration."</p>

<p>"There shall be none, sir&mdash;simply the raising of the lid; you
shall remain in the room. If it should prove as we all hope, you shall
have the pleasure of one other look, really the last, upon your beloved
kinsman."</p>

<p>"But, sir, I can't."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur, I must."</p>

<p>"But, besides, the thing, the turnscrew, broke when the last screw
was turned; and I give you my sacred honor there is nothing but the
body in this coffin."</p>

<p>"Of course, Monsieur le Comte believes all that; but he does not
know so well as I the legerdemain in use among servants, who are
accustomed to smuggling. Here, Philippe, you must take off the lid of
that coffin."</p>

<p>The Count protested; but Philippe&mdash;a man with a bald head and a
smirched face, looking like a working blacksmith&mdash;placed on the
floor a leather bag of tools, from which, having looked at the coffin,
and picked with his nail at the screw-heads, he selected a turnscrew
and, with a few deft twirls at each of the screws, they stood up like
little rows of mushrooms, and the lid was raised. I saw the light, of
which I thought I had seen my last, once more; but the axis of vision
remained fixed. As I was reduced to the cataleptic state in a position
nearly perpendicular, I continued looking straight before me, and thus
my gaze was now fixed upon the ceiling. I saw the face of Carmaignac
leaning over me with a curious frown. It seemed to me that there was no
recognition in his eyes. Oh, Heaven! that I could have uttered were it
but one cry! I saw the dark, mean mask of the little Count staring down
at me from the other side; the face of the pseudo-Marquis also peering
at me, but not so full in the line of vision; there were other faces
also.</p>

<p>"I see, I see," said Carmaignac, withdrawing. "Nothing of the kind
there."</p>

<p>"You will be good enough to direct your man to re-adjust the lid of
the coffin, and to fix the screws," said the Count, taking courage;
"and&mdash;and&mdash;really the funeral must proceed. It is not fair to
the people, who have but moderate fees for night-work, to keep them
hour after hour beyond the time."</p>

<p>"Count de St. Alyre, you shall go in a very few minutes. I will
direct, just now, all about the coffin."</p>

<p>The Count looked toward the door, and there saw a <i>gendarme</i>;
and two or three more grave and stalwart specimens of the same force
were also in the room. The Count was very uncomfortably excited; it was
growing insupportable.</p>

<p>"As this gentleman makes a difficulty about my attending the
obsequies of my kinsman, I will ask you, Planard, to accompany the
funeral in my stead."</p>

<p>"In a few minutes;" answered the incorrigible Carmaignac. "I must
first trouble you for the key that opens that press."</p>

<p>He pointed direct at the press in which the clothes had just been
locked up.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have no objection," said the Count&mdash;"none, of
course; only they have not been used for an age. I'll direct someone to
look for the key."</p>

<p>"If you have not got it about you, it is quite unnecessary.
Philippe, try your skeleton-keys with that press. I want it opened.
Whose clothes are these?" inquired Carmaignac, when, the press having
been opened, he took out the suit that had been placed there scarcely
two minutes since.</p>

<p>"I can't say," answered the Count. "I know nothing of the contents
of that press. A roguish servant, named Lablais, whom I dismissed about
a year ago, had the key. I have not seen it open for ten years or more.
The clothes are probably his."</p>

<p>"Here are visiting cards, see, and here a marked
pocket-handkerchief&mdash;'R.B.' upon it. He must have stolen them from
a person named Beckett&mdash;R. Beckett. 'Mr. Beckett, Berkeley
Square,' the card says; and, my faith! here's a watch and a bunch of
seals; one of them with the initials 'R.B.' upon it. That servant,
Lablais, must have been a consummate rogue!"</p>

<p>"So he was; you are right, Sir."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that he possibly stole these clothes," continued
Carmaignac, "from the man in the coffin, who, in that case, would be
Monsieur Beckett, and not Monsieur de St. Amand. For wonderful to
relate, Monsieur, the watch is still going! The man in the coffin, I
believe, is not dead, but simply drugged. And for having robbed and
intended to murder him, I arrest you, Nicolas de la Marque, Count de
St. Alyre."</p>

<p>In another moment the old villain was a prisoner. I heard his
discordant voice break quaveringly into sudden vehemence and
volubility; now croaking&mdash;now shrieking as he oscillated between
protests, threats, and impious appeals to the God who will "judge the
secrets of men!" And thus lying and raving, he was removed from the
room, and placed in the same coach with his beautiful and abandoned
accomplice, already arrested; and, with two <i>gendarmes</i> sitting
beside them, they were immediate driving at a rapid pace towards the
Conciergerie.</p>

<p>There were now added to the general chorus two voices, very
different in quality; one was that of the gasconading Colonel
Gaillarde, who had with difficulty been kept in the background up to
this; the other was that of my jolly friend Whistlewick, who had come
to identify me.</p>

<p>I shall tell you, just now, how this project against my property and
life, so ingenious and monstrous, was exploded. I must first say a word
about myself. I was placed in a hot bath, under the direction of
Planard, as consummate a villain as any of the gang, but now thoroughly
in the interests of the prosecution. Thence I was laid in a warm bed,
the window of the room being open. These simple measures restored me in
about three hours; I should otherwise, probably, have continued under
the spell for nearly seven.</p>

<p>The practices of these nefarious conspirators had been carried on
with consummate skill and secrecy. Their dupes were led, as I was, to
be themselves auxiliary to the mystery which made their own destruction
both safe and certain.</p>

<p>A search was, of course, instituted. Graves were opened in Pre la
Chaise. The bodies exhumed had lain there too long, and were too much
decomposed to be recognized. One only was identified. The notice for
the burial, in this particular case, had been signed, the order given,
and the fees paid, by Gabriel Gaillarde, who was known to the official
clerk, who had to transact with him this little funereal business. The
very trick that had been arranged for me, had been successfully
practiced in his case. The person for whom the grave had been ordered,
was purely fictitious; and Gabriel Gaillarde himself filled the coffin,
on the cover of which that false name was inscribed as well as upon a
tomb-stone over the grave. Possibly the same honor, under my pseudonym,
may have been intended for me.</p>

<p>The identification was curious. This Gabriel Gaillarde had had a bad
fall from a runaway horse about five years before his mysterious
disappearance. He had lost an eye and some teeth in this accident,
beside sustaining a fracture of the right leg, immediately above the
ankle. He had kept the injuries to his face as profound a secret as he
could. The result was, that the glass eye which had done duty for the
one he had lost remained in the socket, slightly displaced, of course,
but recognizable by the "artist" who had supplied it.</p>

<p>More pointedly recognizable were the teeth, peculiar in workmanship,
which one of the ablest dentists in Paris had himself adapted to the
chasms, the cast of which, owing to peculiarities in the accident, he
happened to have preserved. This cast precisely fitted the gold plate
found in the mouth of the skull. The mark, also, above the ankle, in
the bone, where it had reunited, corresponded exactly with the place
where the fracture had knit in the limb of Gabriel Gaillarde.</p>

<p>The Colonel, his younger brother, had been furious about the
disappearance of Gabriel, and still more so about that of his money,
which he had long regarded as his proper keepsake, whenever death
should remove his brother from the vexations of living. He had
suspected for a long time, for certain adroitly discovered reasons,
that the Count de St. Alyre and the beautiful lady, his companion,
countess, or whatever else she was, had pigeoned him. To this suspicion
were added some others of a still darker kind; but in their first
shape, rather the exaggerated reflections of his fury, ready to believe
anything, than well-defined conjectures.</p>

<p>At length an accident had placed the Colonel very nearly upon the
right scent; a chance, possibly lucky, for himself, had apprised the
scoundrel Planard that the conspirators&mdash;himself among the
number&mdash;were in danger. The result was that he made terms for
himself, became an informer, and concerted with the police this visit
made to the Ch&acirc;teau de la Carque at the critical moment when
every measure had been completed that was necessary to construct a
perfect case against his guilty accomplices.</p>

<p>I need not describe the minute industry or forethought with which
the police agents collected all the details necessary to support the
case. They had brought an able physician, who, even had Planard failed,
would have supplied the necessary medical evidence.</p>

<p>My trip to Paris, you will believe, had not turned out quite so
agreeably as I had anticipated. I was the principal witness for the
prosecution in this <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, with all the
<i>agr&eacute;mens</i> that attend that enviable position. Having had
an escape, as my friend Whistlewick said, "with a squeak" for my life,
I innocently fancied that I should have been an object of considerable
interest to Parisian society; but, a good deal to my mortification, I
discovered that I was the object of a good-natured but contemptuous
merriment. I was a <i>balourd, a ben&ecirc;t, un &acirc;ne</i>, and
figured even in caricatures. I became a sort of public character, a
dignity,</p>

<p>"Unto which I was not born,"</p>

<p>and from which I fled as soon as I conveniently could, without even
paying my friend, the Marquis d'Harmonville, a visit at his hospitable
chateau.</p>

<p>The Marquis escaped scot-free. His accomplice, the Count, was
executed. The fair Eugenie, under extenuating
circumstances&mdash;consisting, so far as I could discover of her good
looks&mdash;got off for six years' imprisonment.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaillarde recovered some of his brother's money, out of the
not very affluent estate of the Count and soi-disant Countess. This,
and the execution of the Count, put him in high good humor. So far from
insisting on a hostile meeting, he shook me very graciously by the
hand, told me that he looked upon the wound on his head, inflicted by
the knob of my stick, as having been received in an honorable though
irregular duel, in which he had no disadvantage or unfairness to
complain of.</p>

<p>I think I have only two additional details to mention. The bricks
discovered in the room with the coffin, had been packed in it, in
straw, to supply the weight of a dead body, and to prevent the
suspicions and contradictions that might have been excited by the
arrival of an empty coffin at the chateau.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Countess's magnificent brilliants were examined by a
lapidary, and pronounced to be worth about five pounds to a tragedy
queen who happened to be in want of a suite of paste.</p>

<p>The Countess had figured some years before as one of the cleverest
actresses on the minor stage of Paris, where she had been picked up by
the Count and used as his principal accomplice.</p>

<p>She it was who, admirably disguised, had rifled my papers in the
carriage on my memorable night-journey to Paris. She also had figured
as the interpreting magician of the palanquin at the ball at
Versailles. So far as I was affected by that elaborate mystification it
was intended to re-animate my interest, which, they feared might flag,
in the beautiful Countess. It had its design and action upon other
intended victims also; but of them there is, at present, no need to
speak. The introduction of a real corpse&mdash;procured from a person
who supplied the Parisian anatomists&mdash;involved no real danger,
while it heightened the mystery and kept the prophet alive in the
gossip of the town and in the thoughts of the noodles with whom he had
conferred.</p>

<p>I divided the remainder of the summer and autumn between Switzerland
and Italy.</p>

<p>As the well-worn phrase goes, I was a sadder if not a wiser man. A
great deal of the horrible impression left upon my mind was due, of
course, to the mere action of nerves and brain. But serious feelings of
another and deeper kind remained. My afterlife was ultimately formed by
the shock I had then received. Those impressions led me&mdash;but not
till after many years&mdash;to happier though not less serious
thoughts; and I have deep reason to be thankful to the all-merciful
Ruler of events for an early and terrible lesson in the ways of
sin.</p>

<h1>CARMILLA</h1>

<h2><a name="c5-p"></a><i>Prologue</i></h2>

<p>Upon a paper attached to the Narrative which follows, Doctor
Hesselius has written a rather elaborate note, which he accompanies
with a reference to his Essay on the strange subject which the MS.
illuminates.</p>

<p>This mysterious subject he treats, in that Essay, with his usual
learning and acumen, and with remarkable directness and condensation.
It will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man's
collected papers.</p>

<p>As I publish the case, in this volume, simply to interest the
"laity," I shall forestall the intelligent lady, who relates it, in
nothing; and after due consideration, I have determined, therefore, to
abstain from presenting any pr&eacute;cis of the learned Doctor's
reasoning, or extract from his statement on a subject which he
describes as "involving, not improbably, some of the profoundest arcana
of our dual existence, and its intermediates."</p>

<p>I was anxious on discovering this paper, to reopen the
correspondence commenced by Doctor Hesselius, so many years before,
with a person so clever and careful as his informant seems to have
been. Much to my regret, however, I found that she had died in the
interval.</p>

<p>She, probably, could have added little to the Narrative which she
communicates in the following pages, with, so far as I can pronounce,
such conscientious particularity.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-1"></a>Chapter I - <i>An Early Fright</i></h2>

<p>In Styria, we, though by no means magnificent people, inhabit a
castle, or schloss. A small income, in that part of the world, goes a
great way. Eight or nine hundred a year does wonders. Scantily enough
ours would have answered among wealthy people at home. My father is
English, and I bear an English name, although I never saw England. But
here, in this lonely and primitive place, where everything is so
marvelously cheap, I really don't see how ever so much more money would
at all materially add to our comforts, or even luxuries.</p>

<p>My father was in the Austrian service, and retired upon a pension
and his patrimony, and purchased this feudal residence, and the small
estate on which it stands, a bargain.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more picturesque or solitary. It stands on a slight
eminence in a forest. The road, very old and narrow, passes in front of
its drawbridge, never raised in my time, and its moat, stocked with
perch, and sailed over by many swans, and floating on its surface white
fleets of water lilies.</p>

<p>Over all this the schloss shows its many-windowed front; its towers,
and its Gothic chapel.</p>

<p>The forest opens in an irregular and very picturesque glade before
its gate, and at the right a steep Gothic bridge carries the road over
a stream that winds in deep shadow through the wood. I have said that
this is a very lonely place. Judge whether I say truth. Looking from
the hall door towards the road, the forest in which our castle stands
extends fifteen miles to the right, and twelve to the left. The nearest
inhabited village is about seven of your English miles to the left. The
nearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations, is that of old
General Spielsdorf, nearly twenty miles away to the right.</p>

<p>I have said "the nearest <i>inhabited</i> village," because there
is, only three miles westward, that is to say in the direction of
General Spielsdorf's schloss, a ruined village, with its quaint little
church, now roofless, in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of
the proud family of Karnstein, now extinct, who once owned the equally
desolate chateau which, in the thick of the forest, overlooks the
silent ruins of the town.</p>

<p>Respecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and
melancholy spot, there is a legend which I shall relate to you another
time.</p>

<p>I must tell you now, how very small is the party who constitute the
inhabitants of our castle. I don't include servants, or those
dependents who occupy rooms in the buildings attached to the schloss.
Listen, and wonder! My father, who is the kindest man on earth, but
growing old; and I, at the date of my story, only nineteen. Eight years
have passed since then.</p>

<p>I and my father constituted the family at the schloss. My mother, a
Styrian lady, died in my infancy, but I had a good-natured governess,
who had been with me from, I might almost say, my infancy. I could not
remember the time when her fat, benignant face was not a familiar
picture in my memory.</p>

<p>This was Madame Perrodon, a native of Berne, whose care and good
nature now in part supplied to me the loss of my mother, whom I do not
even remember, so early I lost her. She made a third at our little
dinner party. There was a fourth, Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, a lady
such as you term, I believe, a "finishing governess." She spoke French
and German, Madame Perrodon French and broken English, to which my
father and I added English, which, partly to prevent its becoming a
lost language among us, and partly from patriotic motives, we spoke
every day. The consequence was a Babel, at which strangers used to
laugh, and which I shall make no attempt to reproduce in this
narrative. And there were two or three young lady friends besides,
pretty nearly of my own age, who were occasional visitors, for longer
or shorter terms; and these visits I sometimes returned.</p>

<p>These were our regular social resources; but of course there were
chance visits from "neighbors" of only five or six leagues distance. My
life was, notwithstanding, rather a solitary one, I can assure you.</p>

<p>My gouvernantes had just so much control over me as you might
conjecture such sage persons would have in the case of a rather spoiled
girl, whose only parent allowed her pretty nearly her own way in
everything.</p>

<p>The first occurrence in my existence, which produced a terrible
impression upon my mind, which, in fact, never has been effaced, was
one of the very earliest incidents of my life which I can recollect.
Some people will think it so trifling that it should not be recorded
here. You will see, however, by-and-by, why I mention it. The nursery,
as it was called, though I had it all to myself, was a large room in
the upper story of the castle, with a steep oak roof. I can't have been
more than six years old, when one night I awoke, and looking round the
room from my bed, failed to see the nursery maid. Neither was my nurse
there; and I thought myself alone. I was not frightened, for I was one
of those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost
stories, of fairy tales, and of all such lore as makes us cover up our
heads when the door cracks suddenly, or the flicker of an expiring
candle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall, nearer to our
faces. I was vexed and insulted at finding myself, as I conceived,
neglected, and I began to whimper, preparatory to a hearty bout of
roaring; when to my surprise, I saw a solemn, but very pretty face
looking at me from the side of the bed. It was that of a young lady who
was kneeling, with her hands under the coverlet. I looked at her with a
kind of pleased wonder, and ceased whimpering. She caressed me with her
hands, and lay down beside me on the bed, and drew me towards her,
smiling; I felt immediately delightfully soothed, and fell asleep
again. I was wakened by a sensation as if two needles ran into my
breast very deep at the same moment, and I cried loudly. The lady
started back, with her eyes fixed on me, and then slipped down upon the
floor, and, as I thought, hid herself under the bed.</p>

<p>I was now for the first time frightened, and I yelled with all my
might and main. Nurse, nursery maid, housekeeper, all came running in,
and hearing my story, they made light of it, soothing me all they could
meanwhile. But, child as I was, I could perceive that their faces were
pale with an unwonted look of anxiety, and I saw them look under the
bed, and about the room, and peep under tables and pluck open
cupboards; and the housekeeper whispered to the nurse: "Lay your hand
along that hollow in the bed; someone <i>did</i> lie there, so sure as
you did not; the place is still warm."</p>

<p>I remember the nursery maid petting me, and all three examining my
chest, where I told them I felt the puncture, and pronouncing that
there was no sign visible that any such thing had happened to me.</p>

<p>The housekeeper and the two other servants who were in charge of the
nursery, remained sitting up all night; and from that time a servant
always sat up in the nursery until I was about fourteen.</p>

<p>I was very nervous for a long time after this. A doctor was called
in, he was pallid and elderly. How well I remember his long saturnine
face, slightly pitted with smallpox, and his chestnut wig. For a good
while, every second day, he came and gave me medicine, which of course
I hated.</p>

<p>The morning after I saw this apparition I was in a state of terror,
and could not bear to be left alone, daylight though it was, for a
moment.</p>

<p>I remember my father coming up and standing at the bedside, and
talking cheerfully, and asking the nurse a number of questions, and
laughing very heartily at one of the answers; and patting me on the
shoulder, and kissing me, and telling me not to be frightened, that it
was nothing but a dream and could not hurt me.</p>

<p>But I was not comforted, for I knew the visit of the strange woman
was <i>not</i> a dream; and I was <i>awfully</i> frightened.</p>

<p>I was a little consoled by the nursery maid's assuring me that it
was she who had come and looked at me, and lain down beside me in the
bed, and that I must have been half-dreaming not to have known her
face. But this, though supported by the nurse, did not quite satisfy
me.</p>

<p>I remembered, in the course of that day, a venerable old man, in a
black cassock, coming into the room with the nurse and housekeeper, and
talking a little to them, and very kindly to me; his face was very
sweet and gentle, and he told me they were going to pray, and joined my
hands together, and desired me to say, softly, while they were praying,
"Lord hear all good prayers for us, for Jesus' sake." I think these
were the very words, for I often repeated them to myself, and my nurse
used for years to make me say them in my prayers.</p>

<p>I remembered so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white-haired
old man, in his black cassock, as he stood in that rude, lofty, brown
room, with the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred years old
about him, and the scanty light entering its shadowy atmosphere through
the small lattice. He kneeled, and the three women with him, and he
prayed aloud with an earnest quavering voice for, what appeared to me,
a long time. I forget all my life preceding that event, and for some
time after it is all obscure also, but the scenes I have just described
stand out vivid as the isolated pictures of the phantasmagoria
surrounded by darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="c5-2"></a>Chapter II - <i>A Guest</i></h2>

<p>I am now going to tell you something so strange that it will require
all your faith in my veracity to believe my story. It is not only true,
nevertheless, but truth of which I have been an eyewitness.</p>

<p>It was a sweet summer evening, and my father asked me, as he
sometimes did, to take a little ramble with him along that beautiful
forest vista which I have mentioned as lying in front of the
schloss.</p>

<p>"General Spielsdorf cannot come to us so soon as I had hoped," said
my father, as we pursued our walk.</p>

<p>He was to have paid us a visit of some weeks, and we had expected
his arrival next day. He was to have brought with him a young lady, his
niece and ward, Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, whom I had never seen, but
whom I had heard described as a very charming girl, and in whose
society I had promised myself many happy days. I was more disappointed
than a young lady living in a town, or a bustling neighborhood can
possibly imagine. This visit, and the new acquaintance it promised, had
furnished my day dream for many weeks.</p>

<p>"And how soon does he come?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not till autumn. Not for two months, I dare say," he answered. "And
I am very glad now, dear, that you never knew Mademoiselle
Rheinfeldt."</p>

<p>"And why?" I asked, both mortified and curious.</p>

<p>"Because the poor young lady is dead," he replied. "I quite forgot I
had not told you, but you were not in the room when I received the
General's letter this evening."</p>

<p>I was very much shocked. General Spielsdorf had mentioned in his
first letter, six or seven weeks before, that she was not so well as he
would wish her, but there was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion
of danger.</p>

<p>"Here is the General's letter," he said, handing it to me. "I am
afraid he is in great affliction; the letter appears to me to have been
written very nearly in distraction."</p>

<p>We sat down on a rude bench, under a group of magnificent lime
trees. The sun was setting with all its melancholy splendor behind the
sylvan horizon, and the stream that flows beside our home, and passes
under the steep old bridge I have mentioned, wound through many a group
of noble trees, almost at our feet, reflecting in its current the
fading crimson of the sky. General Spielsdorf's letter was so
extraordinary, so vehement, and in some places so self-contradictory,
that I read it twice over&mdash;the second time aloud to my
father&mdash;and was still unable to account for it, except by
supposing that grief had unsettled his mind.</p>

<p>It said "I have lost my darling daughter, for as such I loved her.
During the last days of dear Bertha's illness I was not able to write
to you.</p>

<p>"Before then I had no idea of her danger. I have lost her, and now
learn <i>all</i>, too late. She died in the peace of innocence, and in
the glorious hope of a blessed futurity. The fiend who betrayed our
infatuated hospitality has done it all. I thought I was receiving into
my house innocence, gaiety, a charming companion for my lost Bertha.
Heavens! what a fool have I been!</p>

<p>"I thank God my child died without a suspicion of the cause of her
sufferings. She is gone without so much as conjecturing the nature of
her illness, and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery.
I devote my remaining days to tracking and extinguishing a monster. I
am told I may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose. At
present there is scarcely a gleam of light to guide me. I curse my
conceited incredulity, my despicable affectation of superiority, my
blindness, my obstinacy&mdash;all&mdash;too late. I cannot write or
talk collectedly now. I am distracted. So soon as I shall have a little
recovered, I mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry, which may
possibly lead me as far as Vienna. Some time in the autumn, two months
hence, or earlier if I live, I will see you&mdash;that is, if you
permit me; I will then tell you all that I scarce dare put upon paper
now. Farewell. Pray for me, dear friend."</p>

<p>In these terms ended this strange letter. Though I had never seen
Bertha Rheinfeldt my eyes filled with tears at the sudden intelligence;
I was startled, as well as profoundly disappointed.</p>

<p>The sun had now set, and it was twilight by the time I had returned
the General's letter to my father.</p>

<p>It was a soft clear evening, and we loitered, speculating upon the
possible meanings of the violent and incoherent sentences which I had
just been reading. We had nearly a mile to walk before reaching the
road that passes the schloss in front, and by that time the moon was
shining brilliantly. At the drawbridge we met Madame Perrodon and
Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, who had come out, without their bonnets, to
enjoy the exquisite moonlight.</p>

<p>We heard their voices gabbling in animated dialogue as we
approached. We joined them at the drawbridge, and turned about to
admire with them the beautiful scene.</p>

<p>The glade through which we had just walked lay before us. At our
left the narrow road wound away under clumps of lordly trees, and was
lost to sight amid the thickening forest. At the right the same road
crosses the steep and picturesque bridge, near which stands a ruined
tower which once guarded that pass; and beyond the bridge an abrupt
eminence rises, covered with trees, and showing in the shadows some
grey ivy-clustered rocks.</p>

<p>Over the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like
smoke, marking the distances with a transparent veil; and here and
there we could see the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>No softer, sweeter scene could be imagined. The news I had just
heard made it melancholy; but nothing could disturb its character of
profound serenity, and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the
prospect.</p>

<p>My father, who enjoyed the picturesque, and I, stood looking in
silence over the expanse beneath us. The two good governesses, standing
a little way behind us, discoursed upon the scene, and were eloquent
upon the moon.</p>

<p>Madame Perrodon was fat, middle-aged, and romantic, and talked and
sighed poetically. Mademoiselle De Lafontaine&mdash;in right of her
father who was a German, assumed to be psychological, metaphysical, and
something of a mystic&mdash;now declared that when the moon shone with
a light so intense it was well known that it indicated a special
spiritual activity. The effect of the full moon in such a state of
brilliancy was manifold. It acted on dreams, it acted on lunacy, it
acted on nervous people, it had marvelous physical influences connected
with life. Mademoiselle related that her cousin, who was mate of a
merchant ship, having taken a nap on deck on such a night, lying on his
back, with his face full in the light on the moon, had wakened, after a
dream of an old woman clawing him by the cheek, with his features
horribly drawn to one side; and his countenance had never quite
recovered its equilibrium.</p>

<p>"The moon, this night," she said, "is full of idyllic and magnetic
influence&mdash;and see, when you look behind you at the front of the
schloss how all its windows flash and twinkle with that silvery
splendor, as if unseen hands had lighted up the rooms to receive fairy
guests."</p>

<p>There are indolent styles of the spirits in which, indisposed to
talk ourselves, the talk of others is pleasant to our listless ears;
and I gazed on, pleased with the tinkle of the ladies'
conversation.</p>

<p>"I have got into one of my moping moods tonight," said my father,
after a silence, and quoting Shakespeare, whom, by way of keeping up
our English, he used to read aloud, he said:</p>

<p>"'In truth I know not why I am so sad.<br>
It wearies me: you say it wearies you;<br>
But how I got it&mdash;came by it.'</p>

<p>"I forget the rest. But I feel as if some great misfortune were
hanging over us. I suppose the poor General's afflicted letter has had
something to do with it."</p>

<p>At this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheels and many hoofs
upon the road, arrested our attention.</p>

<p>They seemed to be approaching from the high ground overlooking the
bridge, and very soon the equipage emerged from that point. Two
horsemen first crossed the bridge, then came a carriage drawn by four
horses, and two men rode behind.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the traveling carriage of a person of rank; and we
were all immediately absorbed in watching that very unusual spectacle.
It became, in a few moments, greatly more interesting, for just as the
carriage had passed the summit of the steep bridge, one of the leaders,
taking fright, communicated his panic to the rest, and after a plunge
or two, the whole team broke into a wild gallop together, and dashing
between the horsemen who rode in front, came thundering along the road
towards us with the speed of a hurricane.</p>

<p>The excitement of the scene was made more painful by the clear,
long-drawn screams of a female voice from the carriage window.</p>

<p>We all advanced in curiosity and horror; me rather in silence, the
rest with various ejaculations of terror.</p>

<p>Our suspense did not last long. Just before you reach the castle
drawbridge, on the route they were coming, there stands by the roadside
a magnificent lime tree, on the other stands an ancient stone cross, at
sight of which the horses, now going at a pace that was perfectly
frightful, swerved so as to bring the wheel over the projecting roots
of the tree.</p>

<p>I knew what was coming. I covered my eyes, unable to see it out, and
turned my head away; at the same moment I heard a cry from my lady
friends, who had gone on a little.</p>

<p>Curiosity opened my eyes, and I saw a scene of utter confusion. Two
of the horses were on the ground, the carriage lay upon its side with
two wheels in the air; the men were busy removing the traces, and a
lady with a commanding air and figure had got out, and stood with
clasped hands, raising the handkerchief that was in them every now and
then to her eyes.</p>

<p>Through the carriage door was now lifted a young lady, who appeared
to be lifeless. My dear old father was already beside the elder lady,
with his hat in his hand, evidently tendering his aid and the resources
of his schloss. The lady did not appear to hear him, or to have eyes
for anything but the slender girl who was being placed against the
slope of the bank.</p>

<p>I approached; the young lady was apparently stunned, but she was
certainly not dead. My father, who piqued himself on being something of
a physician, had just had his fingers on her wrist and assured the
lady, who declared herself her mother, that her pulse, though faint and
irregular, was undoubtedly still distinguishable. The lady clasped her
hands and looked upward, as if in a momentary transport of gratitude;
but immediately she broke out again in that theatrical way which is, I
believe, natural to some people.</p>

<p>She was what is called a fine looking woman for her time of life,
and must have been handsome; she was tall, but not thin, and dressed in
black velvet, and looked rather pale, but with a proud and commanding
countenance, though now agitated strangely.</p>

<p>"Who was ever being so born to calamity?" I heard her say, with
clasped hands, as I came up. "Here am I, on a journey of life and
death, in prosecuting which to lose an hour is possibly to lose all. My
child will not have recovered sufficiently to resume her route for who
can say how long. I must leave her: I cannot, dare not, delay. How far
on, sir, can you tell, is the nearest village? I must leave her there;
and shall not see my darling, or even hear of her till my return, three
months hence."</p>

<p>I plucked my father by the coat, and whispered earnestly in his ear:
"Oh! papa, pray ask her to let her stay with us&mdash;it would be so
delightful. Do, pray."</p>

<p>"If Madame will entrust her child to the care of my daughter, and of
her good gouvernante, Madame Perrodon, and permit her to remain as our
guest, under my charge, until her return, it will confer a distinction
and an obligation upon us, and we shall treat her with all the care and
devotion which so sacred a trust deserves."</p>

<p>"I cannot do that, sir, it would be to task your kindness and
chivalry too cruelly," said the lady, distractedly.</p>

<p>"It would, on the contrary, be to confer on us a very great kindness
at the moment when we most need it. My daughter has just been
disappointed by a cruel misfortune, in a visit from which she had long
anticipated a great deal of happiness. If you confide this young lady
to our care it will be her best consolation. The nearest village on
your route is distant, and affords no such inn as you could think of
placing your daughter at; you cannot allow her to continue her journey
for any considerable distance without danger. If, as you say, you
cannot suspend your journey, you must part with her tonight, and
nowhere could you do so with more honest assurances of care and
tenderness than here."</p>

<p>There was something in this lady's air and appearance so
distinguished and even imposing, and in her manner so engaging, as to
impress one, quite apart from the dignity of her equipage, with a
conviction that she was a person of consequence.</p>

<p>By this time the carriage was replaced in its upright position, and
the horses, quite tractable, in the traces again.</p>

<p>The lady threw on her daughter a glance which I fancied was not
quite so affectionate as one might have anticipated from the beginning
of the scene; then she beckoned slightly to my father, and withdrew two
or three steps with him out of hearing; and talked to him with a fixed
and stern countenance, not at all like that with which she had hitherto
spoken.</p>

<p>I was filled with wonder that my father did not seem to perceive the
change, and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she
was speaking, almost in his ear, with so much earnestness and
rapidity.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes at most I think she remained thus employed,
then she turned, and a few steps brought her to where her daughter lay,
supported by Madame Perrodon. She kneeled beside her for a moment and
whispered, as Madame supposed, a little benediction in her ear; then
hastily kissing her she stepped into her carriage, the door was closed,
the footmen in stately liveries jumped up behind, the outriders spurred
on, the postilions cracked their whips, the horses plunged and broke
suddenly into a furious canter that threatened soon again to become a
gallop, and the carriage whirled away, followed at the same rapid pace
by the two horsemen in the rear.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-3"></a>Chapter III - <i>We Compare Notes</i></h2>

<p>We followed the <i>cortege</i> with our eyes until it was swiftly
lost to sight in the misty wood; and the very sound of the hoofs and
the wheels died away in the silent night air.</p>

<p>Nothing remained to assure us that the adventure had not been an
illusion of a moment but the young lady, who just at that moment opened
her eyes. I could not see, for her face was turned from me, but she
raised her head, evidently looking about her, and I heard a very sweet
voice ask complainingly, "Where is mamma?"</p>

<p>Our good Madame Perrodon answered tenderly, and added some
comfortable assurances.</p>

<p>I then heard her ask:</p>

<p>"Where am I? What is this place?" and after that she said, "I don't
see the carriage; and Matska, where is she?"</p>

<p>Madame answered all her questions in so far as she understood them;
and gradually the young lady remembered how the misadventure came
about, and was glad to hear that no one in, or in attendance on, the
carriage was hurt; and on learning that her mamma had left her here,
till her return in about three months, she wept.</p>

<p>I was going to add my consolations to those of Madame Perrodon when
Mademoiselle De Lafontaine placed her hand upon my arm, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't approach, one at a time is as much as she can at present
converse with; a very little excitement would possibly overpower her
now."</p>

<p>As soon as she is comfortably in bed, I thought, I will run up to
her room and see her.</p>

<p>My father in the meantime had sent a servant on horseback for the
physician, who lived about two leagues away; and a bedroom was being
prepared for the young lady's reception.</p>

<p>The stranger now rose, and leaning on Madame's arm, walked slowly
over the drawbridge and into the castle gate.</p>

<p>In the hall, servants waited to receive her, and she was conducted
forthwith to her room. The room we usually sat in as our drawing room
is long, having four windows, that looked over the moat and drawbridge,
upon the forest scene I have just described.</p>

<p>It is furnished in old carved oak, with large carved cabinets, and
the chairs are cushioned with crimson Utrecht velvet. The walls are
covered with tapestry, and surrounded with great gold frames, the
figures being as large as life, in ancient and very curious costume,
and the subjects represented are hunting, hawking, and generally
festive. It is not too stately to be extremely comfortable; and here we
had our tea, for with his usual patriotic leanings he insisted that the
national beverage should make its appearance regularly with our coffee
and chocolate.</p>

<p>We sat here this night, and with candles lighted, were talking over
the adventure of the evening.</p>

<p>Madame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine were both of our
party. The young stranger had hardly lain down in her bed when she sank
into a deep sleep; and those ladies had left her in the care of a
servant.</p>

<p>"How do you like our guest?" I asked, as soon as Madame entered.
"Tell me all about her?"</p>

<p>"I like her extremely," answered Madame, "she is, I almost think,
the prettiest creature I ever saw; about your age, and so gentle and
nice."</p>

<p>"She is absolutely beautiful," threw in Mademoiselle, who had peeped
for a moment into the stranger's room.</p>

<p>"And such a sweet voice!" added Madame Perrodon.</p>

<p>"Did you remark a woman in the carriage, after it was set up again,
who did not get out," inquired Mademoiselle, "but only looked from the
window?"</p>

<p>"No, we had not seen her."</p>

<p>Then she described a hideous black woman, with a sort of colored
turban on her head, and who was gazing all the time from the carriage
window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with
gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in
fury.</p>

<p>"Did you remark what an ill-looking pack of men the servants were?"
asked Madame.</p>

<p>"Yes," said my father, who had just come in, "ugly, hang-dog looking
fellows as ever I beheld in my life. I hope they mayn't rob the poor
lady in the forest. They are clever rogues, however; they got
everything to rights in a minute."</p>

<p>"I dare say they are worn out with too long traveling," said
Madame.</p>

<p>"Besides looking wicked, their faces were so strangely lean, and
dark, and sullen. I am very curious, I own; but I dare say the young
lady will tell you all about it tomorrow, if she is sufficiently
recovered."</p>

<p>"I don't think she will," said my father, with a mysterious smile,
and a little nod of his head, as if he knew more about it than he cared
to tell us.</p>

<p>This made us all the more inquisitive as to what had passed between
him and the lady in the black velvet, in the brief but earnest
interview that had immediately preceded her departure.</p>

<p>We were scarcely alone, when I entreated him to tell me. He did not
need much pressing.</p>

<p>"There is no particular reason why I should not tell you. She
expressed a reluctance to trouble us with the care of her daughter,
saying she was in delicate health, and nervous, but not subject to any
kind of seizure&mdash;she volunteered that&mdash;nor to any illusion;
being, in fact, perfectly sane."</p>

<p>"How very odd to say all that!" I interpolated. "It was so
unnecessary."</p>

<p>"At all events it <i>was</i> said," he laughed, "and as you wish to
know all that passed, which was indeed very little, I tell you. She
then said, 'I am making a long journey of <i>vital</i>
importance'&mdash;she emphasized the word&mdash;'rapid and secret; I
shall return for my child in three months; in the meantime, she will be
silent as to who we are, whence we come, and whither we are traveling.'
That is all she said. She spoke very pure French. When she said the
word 'secret,' she paused for a few seconds, looking sternly, her eyes
fixed on mine. I fancy she makes a great point of that. You saw how
quickly she was gone. I hope I have not done a very foolish thing, in
taking charge of the young lady."</p>

<p>For my part, I was delighted. I was longing to see and talk to her;
and only waiting till the doctor should give me leave. You, who live in
towns, can have no idea how great an event the introduction of a new
friend is, in such a solitude as surrounded us.</p>

<p>The doctor did not arrive till nearly one o'clock; but I could no
more have gone to my bed and slept, than I could have overtaken, on
foot, the carriage in which the princess in black velvet had driven
away.</p>

<p>When the physician came down to the drawing room, it was to report
very favorably upon his patient. She was now sitting up, her pulse
quite regular, apparently perfectly well. She had sustained no injury,
and the little shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly.
There could be no harm certainly in my seeing her, if we both wished
it; and, with this permission I sent, forthwith, to know whether she
would allow me to visit her for a few minutes in her room.</p>

<p>The servant returned immediately to say that she desired nothing
more.</p>

<p>You may be sure I was not long in availing myself of this
permission.</p>

<p>Our visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss. It
was, perhaps, a little stately. There was a somber piece of tapestry
opposite the foot of the bed, representing Cleopatra with the asps to
her bosom; and other solemn classic scenes were displayed, a little
faded, upon the other walls. But there was gold carving, and rich and
varied color enough in the other decorations of the room, to more than
redeem the gloom of the old tapestry.</p>

<p>There were candles at the bedside. She was sitting up; her slender
pretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown, embroidered
with flowers, and lined with thick quilted silk, which her mother had
thrown over her feet as she lay upon the ground.</p>

<p>What was it that, as I reached the bedside and had just begun my
little greeting, struck me dumb in a moment, and made me recoil a step
or two from before her? I will tell you.</p>

<p>I saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night,
which remained so fixed in my memory, and on which I had for so many
years so often ruminated with horror, when no one suspected of what I
was thinking.</p>

<p>It was pretty, even beautiful; and when I first beheld it, wore the
same melancholy expression.</p>

<p>But this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of
recognition.</p>

<p>There was a silence of fully a minute, and then at length she spoke;
I could not.</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" she exclaimed. "Twelve years ago, I saw your face
in a dream, and it has haunted me ever since."</p>

<p>"Wonderful indeed!" I repeated, overcoming with an effort the horror
that had for a time suspended my utterances. "Twelve years ago, in
vision or reality, I certainly saw you. I could not forget your face.
It has remained before my eyes ever since."</p>

<p>Her smile had softened. Whatever I had fancied strange in it, was
gone, and it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and
intelligent.</p>

<p>I felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality
indicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her
accidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it
was to me.</p>

<p>I took her hand as I spoke. I was a little shy, as lonely people
are, but the situation made me eloquent, and even bold. She pressed my
hand, she laid hers upon it, and her eyes glowed, as, looking hastily
into mine, she smiled again, and blushed.</p>

<p>She answered my welcome very prettily. I sat down beside her, still
wondering; and she said:</p>

<p>"I must tell you my vision about you; it is so very strange that you
and I should have had, each of the other so vivid a dream, that each
should have seen, I you and you me, looking as we do now, when of
course we both were mere children. I was a child, about six years old,
and I awoke from a confused and troubled dream, and found myself in a
room, unlike my nursery, wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood, and
with cupboards and bedsteads, and chairs, and benches placed about it.
The beds were, I thought, all empty, and the room itself without anyone
but myself in it; and I, after looking about me for some time, and
admiring especially an iron candlestick with two branches, which I
should certainly know again, crept under one of the beds to reach the
window; but as I got from under the bed, I heard someone crying; and
looking up, while I was still upon my knees, I saw you&mdash;most
assuredly you&mdash;as I see you now; a beautiful young lady, with
golden hair and large blue eyes, and lips&mdash;your lips&mdash;you as
you are here.</p>

<p>"Your looks won me; I climbed on the bed and put my arms about you,
and I think we both fell asleep. I was aroused by a scream; you were
sitting up screaming. I was frightened, and slipped down upon the
ground, and, it seemed to me, lost consciousness for a moment; and when
I came to myself, I was again in my nursery at home. Your face I have
never forgotten since. I could not be misled by mere resemblance.
<i>You are</i> the lady whom I saw then."</p>

<p>It was now my turn to relate my corresponding vision, which I did,
to the undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I don't know which should be most afraid of the other," she said,
again smiling&mdash;"If you were less pretty I think I should be very
much afraid of you, but being as you are, and you and I both so young,
I feel only that I have made your acquaintance twelve years ago, and
have already a right to your intimacy; at all events it does seem as if
we were destined, from our earliest childhood, to be friends. I wonder
whether you feel as strangely drawn towards me as I do to you; I have
never had a friend&mdash;shall I find one now?" She sighed, and her
fine dark eyes gazed passionately on me.</p>

<p>Now the truth is, I felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful
stranger. I did feel, as she said, "drawn towards her," but there was
also something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the
sense of attraction immensely prevailed. She interested and won me; she
was so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.</p>

<p>I perceived now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over
her, and hastened to bid her good night.</p>

<p>"The doctor thinks," I added, "that you ought to have a maid to sit
up with you tonight; one of ours is waiting, and you will find her a
very useful and quiet creature."</p>

<p>"How kind of you, but I could not sleep, I never could with an
attendant in the room. I shan't require any assistance&mdash;and, shall
I confess my weakness, I am haunted with a terror of robbers. Our house
was robbed once, and two servants murdered, so I always lock my door.
It has become a habit&mdash;and you look so kind I know you will
forgive me. I see there is a key in the lock."</p>

<p>She held me close in her pretty arms for a moment and whispered in
my ear, "Good night, darling, it is very hard to part with you, but
good night; tomorrow, but not early, I shall see you again."</p>

<p>She sank back on the pillow with a sigh, and her fine eyes followed
me with a fond and melancholy gaze, and she murmured again "Good night,
dear friend."</p>

<p>Young people like, and even love, on impulse. I was flattered by the
evident, though as yet undeserved, fondness she showed me. I liked the
confidence with which she at once received me. She was determined that
we should be very near friends.</p>

<p>Next day came and we met again. I was delighted with my companion;
that is to say, in many respects.</p>

<p>Her looks lost nothing in daylight&mdash;she was certainly the most
beautiful creature I had ever seen, and the unpleasant remembrance of
the face presented in my early dream, had lost the effect of the first
unexpected recognition.</p>

<p>She confessed that she had experienced a similar shock on seeing me,
and precisely the same faint antipathy that had mingled with my
admiration of her. We now laughed together over our momentary
horrors.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-4"></a>Chapter IV - <i>Her Habits&mdash;A
Saunter</i></h2>

<p>I told you that I was charmed with her in most particulars.</p>

<p>There were some that did not please me so well.</p>

<p>She was above the middle height of women. I shall begin by
describing her.</p>

<p>She was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that her movements
were languid&mdash;very languid&mdash;indeed, there was nothing in her
appearance to indicate an invalid. Her complexion was rich and
brilliant; her features were small and beautifully formed; her eyes
large, dark, and lustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw
hair so magnificently thick and long when it was down about her
shoulders; I have often placed my hands under it, and laughed with
wonder at its weight. It was exquisitely fine and soft, and in color a
rich very dark brown, with something of gold. I loved to let it down,
tumbling with its own weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her
chair talking in her sweet low voice, I used to fold and braid it, and
spread it out and play with it. Heavens! If I had but known all!</p>

<p>I said there were particulars which did not please me. I have told
you that her confidence won me the first night I saw her; but I found
that she exercised with respect to herself, her mother, her history,
everything in fact connected with her life, plans, and people, an ever
wakeful reserve. I dare say I was unreasonable, perhaps I was wrong; I
dare say I ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my
father by the stately lady in black velvet. But curiosity is a restless
and unscrupulous passion, and no one girl can endure, with patience,
that hers should be baffled by another. What harm could it do anyone to
tell me what I so ardently desired to know? Had she no trust in my good
sense or honor? Why would she not believe me when I assured her, so
solemnly, that I would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to
any mortal breathing.</p>

<p>There was a coldness, it seemed to me, beyond her years, in her
smiling melancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of
light.</p>

<p>I cannot say we quarreled upon this point, for she would not quarrel
upon any. It was, of course, very unfair of me to press her, very
ill-bred, but I really could not help it; and I might just as well have
let it alone.</p>

<p>What she did tell me amounted, in my unconscionable
estimation&mdash;to nothing.</p>

<p>It was all summed up in three very vague disclosures:</p>

<p>First&mdash;Her name was Carmilla.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Her family was very ancient and noble.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Her home lay in the direction of the west.</p>

<p>She would not tell me the name of her family, nor their armorial
bearings, nor the name of their estate, nor even that of the country
they lived in.</p>

<p>You are not to suppose that I worried her incessantly on these
subjects. I watched opportunity, and rather insinuated than urged my
inquiries. Once or twice, indeed, I did attack her more directly. But
no matter what my tactics, utter failure was invariably the result.
Reproaches and caresses were all lost upon her. But I must add this,
that her evasion was conducted with so pretty a melancholy and
deprecation, with so many, and even passionate declarations of her
liking for me, and trust in my honor, and with so many promises that I
should at last know all, that I could not find it in my heart long to
be offended with her.</p>

<p>She used to place her pretty arms about my neck, draw me to her, and
laying her cheek to mine, murmur with her lips near my ear, "Dearest,
your little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the
irresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is
wounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous
humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die&mdash;die,
sweetly die&mdash;into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you,
you, in your turn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of
that cruelty, which yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more
of me and mine, but trust me with all your loving spirit."</p>

<p>And when she had spoken such a rhapsody, she would press me more
closely in her trembling embrace, and her lips in soft kisses gently
glow upon my cheek.</p>

<p>Her agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.</p>

<p>From these foolish embraces, which were not of very frequent
occurrence, I must allow, I used to wish to extricate myself; but my
energies seemed to fail me. Her murmured words sounded like a lullaby
in my ear, and soothed my resistance into a trance, from which I only
seemed to recover myself when she withdrew her arms.</p>

<p>In these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a
strange tumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon,
mingled with a vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct
thoughts about her while such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a
love growing into adoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is
paradox, but I can make no other attempt to explain the feeling.</p>

<p>I now write, after an interval of more than ten years, with a
trembling hand, with a confused and horrible recollection of certain
occurrences and situations, in the ordeal through which I was
unconsciously passing; though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance
of the main current of my story.</p>

<p>But, I suspect, in all lives there are certain emotional scenes,
those in which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused,
that are of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.</p>

<p>Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful
companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed
again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and
burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with
the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it
embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating
eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in
kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you
<i>shall</i> be mine, you and I are one for ever." Then she had thrown
herself back in her chair, with her small hands over her eyes, leaving
me trembling.</p>

<p>"Are we related," I used to ask; "what can you mean by all this? I
remind you perhaps of someone whom you love; but you must not, I hate
it; I don't know you&mdash;I don't know myself when you look so and
talk so."</p>

<p>She used to sigh at my vehemence, then turn away and drop my
hand.</p>

<p>Respecting these very extraordinary manifestations I strove in vain
to form any satisfactory theory&mdash;I could not refer them to
affectation or trick. It was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of
suppressed instinct and emotion. Was she, notwithstanding her mother's
volunteered denial, subject to brief visitations of insanity; or was
there here a disguise and a romance? I had read in old storybooks of
such things. What if a boyish lover had found his way into the house,
and sought to prosecute his suit in masquerade, with the assistance of
a clever old adventuress. But there were many things against this
hypothesis, highly interesting as it was to my vanity.</p>

<p>I could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry
delights to offer. Between these passionate moments there were long
intervals of commonplace, of gaiety, of brooding melancholy, during
which, except that I detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire,
following me, at times I might have been as nothing to her. Except in
these brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish; and
there was always a languor about her, quite incompatible with a
masculine system in a state of health.</p>

<p>In some respects her habits were odd. Perhaps not so singular in the
opinion of a town lady like you, as they appeared to us rustic people.
She used to come down very late, generally not till one o'clock, she
would then take a cup of chocolate, but eat nothing; we then went out
for a walk, which was a mere saunter, and she seemed, almost
immediately, exhausted, and either returned to the schloss or sat on
one of the benches that were placed, here and there, among the trees.
This was a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize. She was
always an animated talker, and very intelligent.</p>

<p>She sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home, or mentioned an
adventure or situation, or an early recollection, which indicated a
people of strange manners, and described customs of which we knew
nothing. I gathered from these chance hints that her native country was
much more remote than I had at first fancied.</p>

<p>As we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by.
It was that of a pretty young girl, whom I had often seen, the daughter
of one of the rangers of the forest. The poor man was walking behind
the coffin of his darling; she was his only child, and he looked quite
heartbroken.</p>

<p>Peasants walking two-and-two came behind, they were singing a
funeral hymn.</p>

<p>I rose to mark my respect as they passed, and joined in the hymn
they were very sweetly singing.</p>

<p>My companion shook me a little roughly, and I turned surprised.</p>

<p>She said brusquely, "Don't you perceive how discordant that is?"</p>

<p>"I think it very sweet, on the contrary," I answered, vexed at the
interruption, and very uncomfortable, lest the people who composed the
little procession should observe and resent what was passing.</p>

<p>I resumed, therefore, instantly, and was again interrupted. "You
pierce my ears," said Carmilla, almost angrily, and stopping her ears
with her tiny fingers. "Besides, how can you tell that your religion
and mine are the same; your forms wound me, and I hate funerals. What a
fuss! Why you must die&mdash;<i>everyone</i> must die; and all are
happier when they do. Come home."</p>

<p>"My father has gone on with the clergyman to the churchyard. I
thought you knew she was to be buried today."</p>

<p>"She? I don't trouble my head about peasants. I don't know who she
is," answered Carmilla, with a flash from her fine eyes.</p>

<p>"She is the poor girl who fancied she saw a ghost a fortnight ago,
and has been dying ever since, till yesterday, when she expired."</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing about ghosts. I shan't sleep tonight if you
do."</p>

<p>"I hope there is no plague or fever coming; all this looks very like
it," I continued. "The swineherd's young wife died only a week ago, and
she thought something seized her by the throat as she lay in her bed,
and nearly strangled her. Papa says such horrible fancies do accompany
some forms of fever. She was quite well the day before. She sank
afterwards, and died before a week."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>her</i> funeral is over, I hope, and <i>her</i> hymn sung;
and our ears shan't be tortured with that discord and jargon. It has
made me nervous. Sit down here, beside me; sit close; hold my hand;
press it hard-hard-harder."</p>

<p>We had moved a little back, and had come to another seat.</p>

<p>She sat down. Her face underwent a change that alarmed and even
terrified me for a moment. It darkened, and became horribly livid; her
teeth and hands were clenched, and she frowned and compressed her lips,
while she stared down upon the ground at her feet, and trembled all
over with a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague. All her
energies seemed strained to suppress a fit, with which she was then
breathlessly tugging; and at length a low convulsive cry of suffering
broke from her, and gradually the hysteria subsided. "There! That comes
of strangling people with hymns!" she said at last. "Hold me, hold me
still. It is passing away."</p>

<p>And so gradually it did; and perhaps to dissipate the somber
impression which the spectacle had left upon me, she became unusually
animated and chatty; and so we got home.</p>

<p>This was the first time I had seen her exhibit any definable
symptoms of that delicacy of health which her mother had spoken of. It
was the first time, also, I had seen her exhibit anything like
temper.</p>

<p>Both passed away like a summer cloud; and never but once afterwards
did I witness on her part a momentary sign of anger. I will tell you
how it happened.</p>

<p>She and I were looking out of one of the long drawing room windows,
when there entered the courtyard, over the drawbridge, a figure of a
wanderer whom I knew very well. He used to visit the schloss generally
twice a year.</p>

<p>It was the figure of a hunchback, with the sharp lean features that
generally accompany deformity. He wore a pointed black beard, and he
was smiling from ear to ear, showing his white fangs. He was dressed in
buff, black, and scarlet, and crossed with more straps and belts than I
could count, from which hung all manner of things. Behind, he carried a
magic lantern, and two boxes, which I well knew, in one of which was a
salamander, and in the other a mandrake. These monsters used to make my
father laugh. They were compounded of parts of monkeys, parrots,
squirrels, fish, and hedgehogs, dried and stitched together with great
neatness and startling effect. He had a fiddle, a box of conjuring
apparatus, a pair of foils and masks attached to his belt, several
other mysterious cases dangling about him, and a black staff with
copper ferrules in his hand. His companion was a rough spare dog, that
followed at his heels, but stopped short, suspiciously at the
drawbridge, and in a little while began to howl dismally.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the mountebank, standing in the midst of the
courtyard, raised his grotesque hat, and made us a very ceremonious
bow, paying his compliments very volubly in execrable French, and
German not much better.</p>

<p>Then, disengaging his fiddle, he began to scrape a lively air to
which he sang with a merry discord, dancing with ludicrous airs and
activity, that made me laugh, in spite of the dog's howling.</p>

<p>Then he advanced to the window with many smiles and salutations, and
his hat in his left hand, his fiddle under his arm, and with a fluency
that never took breath, he gabbled a long advertisement of all his
accomplishments, and the resources of the various arts which he placed
at our service, and the curiosities and entertainments which it was in
his power, at our bidding, to display.</p>

<p>"Will your ladyships be pleased to buy an amulet against the oupire,
which is going like the wolf, I hear, through these woods," he said
dropping his hat on the pavement. "They are dying of it right and left
and here is a charm that never fails; only pinned to the pillow, and
you may laugh in his face."</p>

<p>These charms consisted of oblong slips of vellum, with cabalistic
ciphers and diagrams upon them.</p>

<p>Carmilla instantly purchased one, and so did I.</p>

<p>He was looking up, and we were smiling down upon him, amused; at
least, I can answer for myself. His piercing black eye, as he looked up
in our faces, seemed to detect something that fixed for a moment his
curiosity. In an instant he unrolled a leather case, full of all manner
of odd little steel instruments.</p>

<p>"See here, my lady," he said, displaying it, and addressing me, "I
profess, among other things less useful, the art of dentistry. Plague
take the dog!" he interpolated. "Silence, beast! He howls so that your
ladyships can scarcely hear a word. Your noble friend, the young lady
at your right, has the sharpest tooth,&mdash;long, thin, pointed, like
an awl, like a needle; ha, ha! With my sharp and long sight, as I look
up, I have seen it distinctly; now if it happens to hurt the young
lady, and I think it must, here am I, here are my file, my punch, my
nippers; I will make it round and blunt, if her ladyship pleases; no
longer the tooth of a fish, but of a beautiful young lady as she is.
Hey? Is the young lady displeased? Have I been too bold? Have I
offended her?"</p>

<p>The young lady, indeed, looked very angry as she drew back from the
window.</p>

<p>"How dares that mountebank insult us so? Where is your father? I
shall demand redress from him. My father would have had the wretch tied
up to the pump, and flogged with a cart whip, and burnt to the bones
with the cattle brand!"</p>

<p>She retired from the window a step or two, and sat down, and had
hardly lost sight of the offender, when her wrath subsided as suddenly
as it had risen, and she gradually recovered her usual tone, and seemed
to forget the little hunchback and his follies.</p>

<p>My father was out of spirits that evening. On coming in he told us
that there had been another case very similar to the two fatal ones
which had lately occurred. The sister of a young peasant on his estate,
only a mile away, was very ill, had been, as she described it, attacked
very nearly in the same way, and was now slowly but steadily
sinking.</p>

<p>"All this," said my father, "is strictly referable to natural
causes. These poor people infect one another with their superstitions,
and so repeat in imagination the images of terror that have infested
their neighbors."</p>

<p>"But that very circumstance frightens one horribly," said
Carmilla.</p>

<p>"How so?" inquired my father.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid of fancying I see such things; I think it would be
as bad as reality."</p>

<p>"We are in God's hands: nothing can happen without His permission,
and all will end well for those who love Him. He is our faithful
creator; He has made us all, and will take care of us."</p>

<p>"Creator! <i>Nature!</i>" said the young lady in answer to my gentle
father. "And this disease that invades the country is natural. Nature.
All things proceed from Nature&mdash;don't they? All things in the
heaven, in the earth, and under the earth, act and live as Nature
ordains? I think so."</p>

<p>"The doctor said he would come here today," said my father, after a
silence. "I want to know what he thinks about it, and what he thinks we
had better do."</p>

<p>"Doctors never did me any good," said Carmilla.</p>

<p>"Then you have been ill?" I asked.</p>

<p>"More ill than ever you were," she answered.</p>

<p>"Long ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a long time. I suffered from this very illness; but I forget
all but my pain and weakness, and they were not so bad as are suffered
in other diseases."</p>

<p>"You were very young then?"</p>

<p>"I dare say, let us talk no more of it. You would not wound a
friend?"</p>

<p>She looked languidly in my eyes, and passed her arm round my waist
lovingly, and led me out of the room. My father was busy over some
papers near the window.</p>

<p>"Why does your papa like to frighten us?" said the pretty girl with
a sigh and a little shudder.</p>

<p>"He doesn't, dear Carmilla, it is the very furthest thing from his
mind."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid, dearest?"</p>

<p>"I should be very much if I fancied there was any real danger of my
being attacked as those poor people were."</p>

<p>"You are afraid to die?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every one is."</p>

<p>"But to die as lovers may&mdash;to die together, so that they may
live together.</p>

<p>"Girls are caterpillars while they live in the world, to be finally
butterflies when the summer comes; but in the meantime there are grubs
and larvae, don't you see&mdash;each with their peculiar propensities,
necessities and structure. So says Monsieur Buffon, in his big book, in
the next room."</p>

<p>Later in the day the doctor came, and was closeted with papa for
some time.</p>

<p>He was a skilful man, of sixty and upwards, he wore powder, and
shaved his pale face as smooth as a pumpkin. He and papa emerged from
the room together, and I heard papa laugh, and say as they came
out:</p>

<p>"Well, I do wonder at a wise man like you. What do you say to
hippogriffs and dragons?"</p>

<p>The doctor was smiling, and made answer, shaking his head&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nevertheless life and death are mysterious states, and we know
little of the resources of either."</p>

<p>And so they walked on, and I heard no more. I did not then know what
the doctor had been broaching, but I think I guess it now.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-5"></a>Chapter V - <i>A Wonderful Likeness</i></h2>

<p>This evening there arrived from Gratz the grave, dark-faced son of
the picture cleaner, with a horse and cart laden with two large packing
cases, having many pictures in each. It was a journey of ten leagues,
and whenever a messenger arrived at the schloss from our little capital
of Gratz, we used to crowd about him in the hall, to hear the news.</p>

<p>This arrival created in our secluded quarters quite a sensation. The
cases remained in the hall, and the messenger was taken charge of by
the servants till he had eaten his supper. Then with assistants, and
armed with hammer, ripping chisel, and turnscrew, he met us in the
hall, where we had assembled to witness the unpacking of the cases.</p>

<p>Carmilla sat looking listlessly on, while one after the other the
old pictures, nearly all portraits, which had undergone the process of
renovation, were brought to light. My mother was of an old Hungarian
family, and most of these pictures, which were about to be restored to
their places, had come to us through her.</p>

<p>My father had a list in his hand, from which he read, as the artist
rummaged out the corresponding numbers. I don't know that the pictures
were very good, but they were, undoubtedly, very old, and some of them
very curious also. They had, for the most part, the merit of being now
seen by me, I may say, for the first time; for the smoke and dust of
time had all but obliterated them.</p>

<p>"There is a picture that I have not seen yet," said my father. "In
one corner, at the top of it, is the name, as well as I could read,
'Marcia Karnstein,' and the date '1698'; and I am curious to see how it
has turned out."</p>

<p>I remembered it; it was a small picture, about a foot and a half
high, and nearly square, without a frame; but it was so blackened by
age that I could not make it out.</p>

<p>The artist now produced it, with evident pride. It was quite
beautiful; it was startling; it seemed to live. It was the effigy of
Carmilla!</p>

<p>"Carmilla, dear, here is an absolute miracle. Here you are, living,
smiling, ready to speak, in this picture. Isn't it beautiful, Papa? And
see, even the little mole on her throat."</p>

<p>My father laughed, and said "Certainly it is a wonderful likeness,"
but he looked away, and to my surprise seemed but little struck by it,
and went on talking to the picture cleaner, who was also something of
an artist, and discoursed with intelligence about the portraits or
other works, which his art had just brought into light and color, while
I was more and more lost in wonder the more I looked at the
picture.</p>

<p>"Will you let me hang this picture in my room, papa?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear," said he, smiling, "I'm very glad you think it so
like. It must be prettier even than I thought it, if it is."</p>

<p>The young lady did not acknowledge this pretty speech, did not seem
to hear it. She was leaning back in her seat, her fine eyes under their
long lashes gazing on me in contemplation, and she smiled in a kind of
rapture.</p>

<p>"And now you can read quite plainly the name that is written in the
corner. It is not Marcia; it looks as if it was done in gold. The name
is Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, and this is a little coronet over and
underneath A.D. 1698. I am descended from the Karnsteins; that is,
mamma was."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the lady, languidly, "so am I, I think, a very long
descent, very ancient. Are there any Karnsteins living now?"</p>

<p>"None who bear the name, I believe. The family were ruined, I
believe, in some civil wars, long ago, but the ruins of the castle are
only about three miles away."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" she said, languidly. "But see what beautiful
moonlight!" She glanced through the hall door, which stood a little
open. "Suppose you take a little ramble round the court, and look down
at the road and river."</p>

<p>"It is so like the night you came to us," I said.</p>

<p>She sighed; smiling.</p>

<p>She rose, and each with her arm about the other's waist, we walked
out upon the pavement.</p>

<p>In silence, slowly we walked down to the drawbridge, where the
beautiful landscape opened before us.</p>

<p>"And so you were thinking of the night I came here?" she almost
whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you glad I came?"</p>

<p>"Delighted, dear Carmilla," I answered.</p>

<p>"And you asked for the picture you think like me, to hang in your
room," she murmured with a sigh, as she drew her arm closer about my
waist, and let her pretty head sink upon my shoulder. "How romantic you
are, Carmilla," I said. "Whenever you tell me your story, it will be
made up chiefly of some one great romance."</p>

<p>She kissed me silently.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Carmilla, you have been in love; that there is, at this
moment, an affair of the heart going on."</p>

<p>"I have been in love with no one, and never shall," she whispered,
"unless it should be with you."</p>

<p>How beautiful she looked in the moonlight!</p>

<p>Shy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in
my neck and hair, with tumultuous sighs, that seemed almost to sob, and
pressed in mine a hand that trembled.</p>

<p>Her soft cheek was glowing against mine. "Darling, darling," she
murmured, "I live in you; and you would die for me, I love you so."</p>

<p>I started from her.</p>

<p>She was gazing on me with eyes from which all fire, all meaning had
flown, and a face colorless and apathetic.</p>

<p>"Is there a chill in the air, dear?" she said drowsily. "I almost
shiver; have I been dreaming? Let us come in. Come; come; come in."</p>

<p>"You look ill, Carmilla; a little faint. You certainly must take
some wine," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will. I'm better now. I shall be quite well in a few
minutes. Yes, do give me a little wine," answered Carmilla, as we
approached the door.</p>

<p>"Let us look again for a moment; it is the last time, perhaps, I
shall see the moonlight with you."</p>

<p>"How do you feel now, dear Carmilla? Are you really better?" I
asked.</p>

<p>I was beginning to take alarm, lest she should have been stricken
with the strange epidemic that they said had invaded the country about
us.</p>

<p>"Papa would be grieved beyond measure," I added, "if he thought you
were ever so little ill, without immediately letting us know. We have a
very skilful doctor near us, the physician who was with papa
today."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he is. I know how kind you all are; but, dear child, I am
quite well again. There is nothing ever wrong with me, but a little
weakness.</p>

<p>"People say I am languid; I am incapable of exertion; I can scarcely
walk as far as a child of three years old: and every now and then the
little strength I have falters, and I become as you have just seen me.
But after all I am very easily set up again; in a moment I am perfectly
myself. See how I have recovered."</p>

<p>So, indeed, she had; and she and I talked a great deal, and very
animated she was; and the remainder of that evening passed without any
recurrence of what I called her infatuations. I mean her crazy talk and
looks, which embarrassed, and even frightened me.</p>

<p>But there occurred that night an event which gave my thoughts quite
a new turn, and seemed to startle even Carmilla's languid nature into
momentary energy.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-6"></a>Chapter VI - <i>A Very Strange Agony</i></h2>

<p>When we got into the drawing room, and had sat down to our coffee
and chocolate, although Carmilla did not take any, she seemed quite
herself again, and Madame, and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, joined us,
and made a little card party, in the course of which papa came in for
what he called his "dish of tea."</p>

<p>When the game was over he sat down beside Carmilla on the sofa, and
asked her, a little anxiously, whether she had heard from her mother
since her arrival.</p>

<p>She answered "No."</p>

<p>He then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at
present.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," she answered ambiguously, "but I have been thinking
of leaving you; you have been already too hospitable and too kind to
me. I have given you an infinity of trouble, and I should wish to take
a carriage tomorrow, and post in pursuit of her; I know where I shall
ultimately find her, although I dare not yet tell you."</p>

<p>"But you must not dream of any such thing," exclaimed my father, to
my great relief. "We can't afford to lose you so, and I won't consent
to your leaving us, except under the care of your mother, who was so
good as to consent to your remaining with us till she should herself
return. I should be quite happy if I knew that you heard from her: but
this evening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease
that has invaded our neighborhood, grow even more alarming; and my
beautiful guest, I do feel the responsibility, unaided by advice from
your mother, very much. But I shall do my best; and one thing is
certain, that you must not think of leaving us without her distinct
direction to that effect. We should suffer too much in parting from you
to consent to it easily."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, a thousand times for your hospitality," she
answered, smiling bashfully. "You have all been too kind to me; I have
seldom been so happy in all my life before, as in your beautiful
chateau, under your care, and in the society of your dear
daughter."</p>

<p>So he gallantly, in his old-fashioned way, kissed her hand, smiling
and pleased at her little speech.</p>

<p>I accompanied Carmilla as usual to her room, and sat and chatted
with her while she was preparing for bed.</p>

<p>"Do you think," I said at length, "that you will ever confide fully
in me?"</p>

<p>She turned round smiling, but made no answer, only continued to
smile on me.</p>

<p>"You won't answer that?" I said. "You can't answer pleasantly; I
ought not to have asked you."</p>

<p>"You were quite right to ask me that, or anything. You do not know
how dear you are to me, or you could not think any confidence too great
to look for. But I am under vows, no nun half so awfully, and I dare
not tell my story yet, even to you. The time is very near when you
shall know everything. You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love
is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am
you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else
hate me and still come with me, and <i>hating</i> me through death and
after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic
nature."</p>

<p>"Now, Carmilla, you are going to talk your wild nonsense again," I
said hastily.</p>

<p>"Not I, silly little fool as I am, and full of whims and fancies;
for your sake I'll talk like a sage. Were you ever at a ball?"</p>

<p>"No; how you do run on. What is it like? How charming it must
be."</p>

<p>"I almost forget, it is years ago."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"You are not so old. Your first ball can hardly be forgotten
yet."</p>

<p>"I remember everything about it&mdash;with an effort. I see it all,
as divers see what is going on above them, through a medium, dense,
rippling, but transparent. There occurred that night what has confused
the picture, and made its colours faint. I was all but assassinated in
my bed, wounded here," she touched her breast, "and never was the same
since."</p>

<p>"Were you near dying?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very&mdash;a cruel love&mdash;strange love, that would have
taken my life. Love will have its sacrifices. No sacrifice without
blood. Let us go to sleep now; I feel so lazy. How can I get up just
now and lock my door?"</p>

<p>She was lying with her tiny hands buried in her rich wavy hair,
under her cheek, her little head upon the pillow, and her glittering
eyes followed me wherever I moved, with a kind of shy smile that I
could not decipher.</p>

<p>I bid her good night, and crept from the room with an uncomfortable
sensation.</p>

<p>I often wondered whether our pretty guest ever said her prayers. I
certainly had never seen her upon her knees. In the morning she never
came down until long after our family prayers were over, and at night
she never left the drawing room to attend our brief evening prayers in
the hall.</p>

<p>If it had not been that it had casually come out in one of our
careless talks that she had been baptised, I should have doubted her
being a Christian. Religion was a subject on which I had never heard
her speak a word. If I had known the world better, this particular
neglect or antipathy would not have so much surprised me.</p>

<p>The precautions of nervous people are infectious, and persons of a
like temperament are pretty sure, after a time, to imitate them. I had
adopted Carmilla's habit of locking her bedroom door, having taken into
my head all her whimsical alarms about midnight invaders and prowling
assassins. I had also adopted her precaution of making a brief search
through her room, to satisfy herself that no lurking assassin or robber
was "ensconced."</p>

<p>These wise measures taken, I got into my bed and fell asleep. A
light was burning in my room. This was an old habit, of very early
date, and which nothing could have tempted me to dispense with.</p>

<p>Thus fortified I might take my rest in peace. But dreams come
through stone walls, light up dark rooms, or darken light ones, and
their persons make their exits and their entrances as they please, and
laugh at locksmiths.</p>

<p>I had a dream that night that was the beginning of a very strange
agony.</p>

<p>I cannot call it a nightmare, for I was quite conscious of being
asleep.</p>

<p>But I was equally conscious of being in my room, and lying in bed,
precisely as I actually was. I saw, or fancied I saw, the room and its
furniture just as I had seen it last, except that it was very dark, and
I saw something moving round the foot of the bed, which at first I
could not accurately distinguish. But I soon saw that it was a
sooty-black animal that resembled a monstrous cat. It appeared to me
about four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the
hearthrug as it passed over it; and it continued to-ing and fro-ing
with the lithe, sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage. I could not
cry out, although as you may suppose, I was terrified. Its pace was
growing faster, and the room rapidly darker and darker, and at length
so dark that I could no longer see anything of it but its eyes. I felt
it spring lightly on the bed. The two broad eyes approached my face,
and suddenly I felt a stinging pain as if two large needles darted, an
inch or two apart, deep into my breast. I waked with a scream. The room
was lighted by the candle that burnt there all through the night, and I
saw a female figure standing at the foot of the bed, a little at the
right side. It was in a dark loose dress, and its hair was down and
covered its shoulders. A block of stone could not have been more still.
There was not the slightest stir of respiration. As I stared at it, the
figure appeared to have changed its place, and was now nearer the door;
then, close to it, the door opened, and it passed out.</p>

<p>I was now relieved, and able to breathe and move. My first thought
was that Carmilla had been playing me a trick, and that I had forgotten
to secure my door. I hastened to it, and found it locked as usual on
the inside. I was afraid to open it&mdash;I was horrified. I sprang
into my bed and covered my head up in the bedclothes, and lay there
more dead than alive till morning.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-7"></a>Chapter VII - <i>Descending</i></h2>

<p>It would be vain my attempting to tell you the horror with which,
even now, I recall the occurrence of that night. It was no such
transitory terror as a dream leaves behind it. It seemed to deepen by
time, and communicated itself to the room and the very furniture that
had encompassed the apparition.</p>

<p>I could not bear next day to be alone for a moment. I should have
told papa, but for two opposite reasons. At one time I thought he would
laugh at my story, and I could not bear its being treated as a jest;
and at another I thought he might fancy that I had been attacked by the
mysterious complaint which had invaded our neighborhood. I had myself
no misgiving of the kind, and as he had been rather an invalid for some
time, I was afraid of alarming him.</p>

<p>I was comfortable enough with my good-natured companions, Madame
Perrodon, and the vivacious Mademoiselle De Lafontaine. They both
perceived that I was out of spirits and nervous, and at length I told
them what lay so heavy at my heart.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle laughed, but I fancied that Madame Perrodon looked
anxious.</p>

<p>"By-the-by," said Mademoiselle, laughing, "the long lime tree walk,
behind Carmilla's bedroom window, is haunted!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Madame, who probably thought the theme rather
inopportune, "and who tells that story, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Martin says that he came up twice, when the old yard gate was being
repaired, before sunrise, and twice saw the same female figure walking
down the lime tree avenue."</p>

<p>"So he well might, as long as there are cows to milk in the river
fields," said Madame.</p>

<p>"I daresay; but Martin chooses to be frightened, and never did I see
fool more frightened."</p>

<p>"You must not say a word about it to Carmilla, because she can see
down that walk from her room window," I interposed, "and she is, if
possible, a greater coward than I."</p>

<p>Carmilla came down rather later than usual that day.</p>

<p>"I was so frightened last night," she said, so soon as were
together, "and I am sure I should have seen something dreadful if it
had not been for that charm I bought from the poor little hunchback
whom I called such hard names. I had a dream of something black coming
round my bed, and I awoke in a perfect horror, and I really thought,
for some seconds, I saw a dark figure near the chimney-piece, but I
felt under my pillow for my charm, and the moment my fingers touched
it, the figure disappeared, and I felt quite certain, only that I had
it by me, that something frightful would have made its appearance, and,
perhaps, throttled me, as it did those poor people we heard of.</p>

<p>"Well, listen to me," I began, and recounted my adventure, at the
recital of which she appeared horrified.</p>

<p>"And had you the charm near you?" she asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>"No, I had dropped it into a china vase in the drawing room, but I
shall certainly take it with me tonight, as you have so much faith in
it."</p>

<p>At this distance of time I cannot tell you, or even understand, how
I overcame my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that
night. I remember distinctly that I pinned the charm to my pillow. I
fell asleep almost immediately, and slept even more soundly than usual
all night.</p>

<p>Next night I passed as well. My sleep was delightfully deep and
dreamless.</p>

<p>But I wakened with a sense of lassitude and melancholy, which,
however, did not exceed a degree that was almost luxurious.</p>

<p>"Well, I told you so," said Carmilla, when I described my quiet
sleep, "I had such delightful sleep myself last night; I pinned the
charm to the breast of my nightdress. It was too far away the night
before. I am quite sure it was all fancy, except the dreams. I used to
think that evil spirits made dreams, but our doctor told me it is no
such thing. Only a fever passing by, or some other malady, as they
often do, he said, knocks at the door, and not being able to get in,
passes on, with that alarm."</p>

<p>"And what do you think the charm is?" said I.</p>

<p>"It has been fumigated or immersed in some drug, and is an antidote
against the malaria," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then it acts only on the body?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; you don't suppose that evil spirits are frightened by
bits of ribbon, or the perfumes of a druggist's shop? No, these
complaints, wandering in the air, begin by trying the nerves, and so
infect the brain, but before they can seize upon you, the antidote
repels them. That I am sure is what the charm has done for us. It is
nothing magical, it is simply natural."</p>

<p>I should have been happier if I could have quite agreed with
Carmilla, but I did my best, and the impression was a little losing its
force.</p>

<p>For some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt
the same lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day. I felt
myself a changed girl. A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a
melancholy that I would not have interrupted. Dim thoughts of death
began to open, and an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and,
somehow, not unwelcome, possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of
mind which this induced was also sweet.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it.</p>

<p>I would not admit that I was ill, I would not consent to tell my
papa, or to have the doctor sent for.</p>

<p>Carmilla became more devoted to me than ever, and her strange
paroxysms of languid adoration more frequent. She used to gloat on me
with increasing ardor the more my strength and spirits waned. This
always shocked me like a momentary glare of insanity.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, I was now in a pretty advanced stage of the
strangest illness under which mortal ever suffered. There was an
unaccountable fascination in its earlier symptoms that more than
reconciled me to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady.
This fascination increased for a time, until it reached a certain
point, when gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it,
deepening, as you shall hear, until it discolored and perverted the
whole state of my life.</p>

<p>The first change I experienced was rather agreeable. It was very
near the turning point from which began the descent of Avernus.</p>

<p>Certain vague and strange sensations visited me in my sleep. The
prevailing one was of that pleasant, peculiar cold thrill which we feel
in bathing, when we move against the current of a river. This was soon
accompanied by dreams that seemed interminable, and were so vague that
I could never recollect their scenery and persons, or any one connected
portion of their action. But they left an awful impression, and a sense
of exhaustion, as if I had passed through a long period of great mental
exertion and danger.</p>

<p>After all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of
having been in a place very nearly dark, and of having spoken to people
whom I could not see; and especially of one clear voice, of a female's,
very deep, that spoke as if at a distance, slowly, and producing always
the same sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear. Sometimes there
came a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck.
Sometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and
more lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed
itself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and
full drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation,
supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses
left me and I became unconscious.</p>

<p>It was now three weeks since the commencement of this unaccountable
state.</p>

<p>My sufferings had, during the last week, told upon my appearance. I
had grown pale, my eyes were dilated and darkened underneath, and the
languor which I had long felt began to display itself in my
countenance.</p>

<p>My father asked me often whether I was ill; but, with an obstinacy
which now seems to me unaccountable, I persisted in assuring him that I
was quite well.</p>

<p>In a sense this was true. I had no pain, I could complain of no
bodily derangement. My complaint seemed to be one of the imagination,
or the nerves, and, horrible as my sufferings were, I kept them, with a
morbid reserve, very nearly to myself.</p>

<p>It could not be that terrible complaint which the peasants called
the oupire, for I had now been suffering for three weeks, and they were
seldom ill for much more than three days, when death put an end to
their miseries.</p>

<p>Carmilla complained of dreams and feverish sensations, but by no
means of so alarming a kind as mine. I say that mine were extremely
alarming. Had I been capable of comprehending my condition, I would
have invoked aid and advice on my knees. The narcotic of an unsuspected
influence was acting upon me, and my perceptions were benumbed.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you now of a dream that led immediately to an odd
discovery.</p>

<p>One night, instead of the voice I was accustomed to hear in the
dark, I heard one, sweet and tender, and at the same time terrible,
which said, "Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin." At the
same time a light unexpectedly sprang up, and I saw Carmilla, standing,
near the foot of my bed, in her white nightdress, bathed, from her chin
to her feet, in one great stain of blood.</p>

<p>I wakened with a shriek, possessed with the one idea that Carmilla
was being murdered. I remember springing from my bed, and my next
recollection is that of standing on the lobby, crying for help.</p>

<p>Madame and Mademoiselle came scurrying out of their rooms in alarm;
a lamp burned always on the lobby, and seeing me, they soon learned the
cause of my terror.</p>

<p>I insisted on our knocking at Carmilla's door. Our knocking was
unanswered.</p>

<p>It soon became a pounding and an uproar. We shrieked her name, but
all was vain.</p>

<p>We all grew frightened, for the door was locked. We hurried back, in
panic, to my room. There we rang the bell long and furiously. If my
father's room had been at that side of the house, we would have called
him up at once to our aid. But, alas! he was quite out of hearing, and
to reach him involved an excursion for which we none of us had
courage.</p>

<p>Servants, however, soon came running up the stairs; I had got on my
dressing gown and slippers meanwhile, and my companions were already
similarly furnished. Recognizing the voices of the servants on the
lobby, we sallied out together; and having renewed, as fruitlessly, our
summons at Carmilla's door, I ordered the men to force the lock. They
did so, and we stood, holding our lights aloft, in the doorway, and so
stared into the room.</p>

<p>We called her by name; but there was still no reply. We looked round
the room. Everything was undisturbed. It was exactly in the state in
which I had left it on bidding her good night. But Carmilla was
gone.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-8"></a>Chapter VIII - <i>Search</i></h2>

<p>At sight of the room, perfectly undisturbed except for our violent
entrance, we began to cool a little, and soon recovered our senses
sufficiently to dismiss the men. It had struck Mademoiselle that
possibly Carmilla had been wakened by the uproar at her door, and in
her first panic had jumped from her bed, and hid herself in a press, or
behind a curtain, from which she could not, of course, emerge until the
majordomo and his myrmidons had withdrawn. We now recommenced our
search, and began to call her name again.</p>

<p>It was all to no purpose. Our perplexity and agitation increased. We
examined the windows, but they were secured. I implored of Carmilla, if
she had concealed herself, to play this cruel trick no longer&mdash;to
come out and to end our anxieties. It was all useless. I was by this
time convinced that she was not in the room, nor in the dressing room,
the door of which was still locked on this side. She could not have
passed it. I was utterly puzzled. Had Carmilla discovered one of those
secret passages which the old housekeeper said were known to exist in
the schloss, although the tradition of their exact situation had been
lost? A little time would, no doubt, explain all&mdash;utterly
perplexed as, for the present, we were.</p>

<p>It was past four o'clock, and I preferred passing the remaining
hours of darkness in Madame's room. Daylight brought no solution of the
difficulty.</p>

<p>The whole household, with my father at its head, was in a state of
agitation next morning. Every part of the chateau was searched. The
grounds were explored. No trace of the missing lady could be
discovered. The stream was about to be dragged; my father was in
distraction; what a tale to have to tell the poor girl's mother on her
return. I, too, was almost beside myself, though my grief was quite of
a different kind.</p>

<p>The morning was passed in alarm and excitement. It was now one
o'clock, and still no tidings. I ran up to Carmilla's room, and found
her standing at her dressing table. I was astounded. I could not
believe my eyes. She beckoned me to her with her pretty finger, in
silence. Her face expressed extreme fear.</p>

<p>I ran to her in an ecstasy of joy; I kissed and embraced her again
and again. I ran to the bell and rang it vehemently, to bring others to
the spot who might at once relieve my father's anxiety.</p>

<p>"Dear Carmilla, what has become of you all this time? We have been
in agonies of anxiety about you," I exclaimed. "Where have you been?
How did you come back?"</p>

<p>"Last night has been a night of wonders," she said.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, explain all you can."</p>

<p>"It was past two last night," she said, "when I went to sleep as
usual in my bed, with my doors locked, that of the dressing room, and
that opening upon the gallery. My sleep was uninterrupted, and, so far
as I know, dreamless; but I woke just now on the sofa in the dressing
room there, and I found the door between the rooms open, and the other
door forced. How could all this have happened without my being wakened?
It must have been accompanied with a great deal of noise, and I am
particularly easily wakened; and how could I have been carried out of
my bed without my sleep having been interrupted, I whom the slightest
stir startles?"</p>

<p>By this time, Madame, Mademoiselle, my father, and a number of the
servants were in the room. Carmilla was, of course, overwhelmed with
inquiries, congratulations, and welcomes. She had but one story to
tell, and seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of
accounting for what had happened.</p>

<p>My father took a turn up and down the room, thinking. I saw
Carmilla's eye follow him for a moment with a sly, dark glance.</p>

<p>When my father had sent the servants away, Mademoiselle having gone
in search of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile, and there
being no one now in the room with Carmilla, except my father, Madame,
and myself, he came to her thoughtfully, took her hand very kindly, led
her to the sofa, and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me, my dear, if I risk a conjecture, and ask a
question?"</p>

<p>"Who can have a better right?" she said. "Ask what you please, and I
will tell you everything. But my story is simply one of bewilderment
and darkness. I know absolutely nothing. Put any question you please,
but you know, of course, the limitations mamma has placed me
under."</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my dear child. I need not approach the topics on which
she desires our silence. Now, the marvel of last night consists in your
having been removed from your bed and your room, without being wakened,
and this removal having occurred apparently while the windows were
still secured, and the two doors locked upon the inside. I will tell
you my theory and ask you a question."</p>

<p>Carmilla was leaning on her hand dejectedly; Madame and I were
listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Now, my question is this. Have you ever been suspected of walking
in your sleep?"</p>

<p>"Never, since I was very young indeed."</p>

<p>"But you did walk in your sleep when you were young?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know I did. I have been told so often by my old nurse."</p>

<p>My father smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, what has happened is this. You got up in your sleep, unlocked
the door, not leaving the key, as usual, in the lock, but taking it out
and locking it on the outside; you again took the key out, and carried
it away with you to some one of the five-and-twenty rooms on this
floor, or perhaps upstairs or downstairs. There are so many rooms and
closets, so much heavy furniture, and such accumulations of lumber,
that it would require a week to search this old house thoroughly. Do
you see, now, what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I do, but not all," she answered.</p>

<p>"And how, papa, do you account for her finding herself on the sofa
in the dressing room, which we had searched so carefully?"</p>

<p>"She came there after you had searched it, still in her sleep, and
at last awoke spontaneously, and was as much surprised to find herself
where she was as any one else. I wish all mysteries were as easily and
innocently explained as yours, Carmilla," he said, laughing. "And so we
may congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural
explanation of the occurrence is one that involves no drugging, no
tampering with locks, no burglars, or poisoners, or
witches&mdash;nothing that need alarm Carmilla, or anyone else, for our
safety."</p>

<p>Carmilla was looking charmingly. Nothing could be more beautiful
than her tints. Her beauty was, I think, enhanced by that graceful
languor that was peculiar to her. I think my father was silently
contrasting her looks with mine, for he said:</p>

<p>"I wish my poor Laura was looking more like herself"; and he
sighed.</p>

<p>So our alarms were happily ended, and Carmilla restored to her
friends.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-9"></a>Chapter IX - <i>The Doctor</i></h2>

<p>As Carmilla would not hear of an attendant sleeping in her room, my
father arranged that a servant should sleep outside her door, so that
she would not attempt to make another such excursion without being
arrested at her own door.</p>

<p>That night passed quietly; and next morning early, the doctor, whom
my father had sent for without telling me a word about it, arrived to
see me.</p>

<p>Madame accompanied me to the library; and there the grave little
doctor, with white hair and spectacles, whom I mentioned before, was
waiting to receive me.</p>

<p>I told him my story, and as I proceeded he grew graver and
graver.</p>

<p>We were standing, he and I, in the recess of one of the windows,
facing one another. When my statement was over, he leaned with his
shoulders against the wall, and with his eyes fixed on me earnestly,
with an interest in which was a dash of horror.</p>

<p>After a minute's reflection, he asked Madame if he could see my
father.</p>

<p>He was sent for accordingly, and as he entered, smiling, he
said:</p>

<p>"I dare say, doctor, you are going to tell me that I am an old fool
for having brought you here; I hope I am."</p>

<p>But his smile faded into shadow as the doctor, with a very grave
face, beckoned him to him.</p>

<p>He and the doctor talked for some time in the same recess where I
had just conferred with the physician. It seemed an earnest and
argumentative conversation. The room is very large, and I and Madame
stood together, burning with curiosity, at the farther end. Not a word
could we hear, however, for they spoke in a very low tone, and the deep
recess of the window quite concealed the doctor from view, and very
nearly my father, whose foot, arm, and shoulder only could we see; and
the voices were, I suppose, all the less audible for the sort of closet
which the thick wall and window formed.</p>

<p>After a time my father's face looked into the room; it was pale,
thoughtful, and, I fancied, agitated.</p>

<p>"Laura, dear, come here for a moment. Madame, we shan't trouble you,
the doctor says, at present."</p>

<p>Accordingly I approached, for the first time a little alarmed; for,
although I felt very weak, I did not feel ill; and strength, one always
fancies, is a thing that may be picked up when we please.</p>

<p>My father held out his hand to me, as I drew near, but he was
looking at the doctor, and he said:</p>

<p>"It certainly is very odd; I don't understand it quite. Laura, come
here, dear; now attend to Doctor Spielsberg, and recollect
yourself."</p>

<p>"You mentioned a sensation like that of two needles piercing the
skin, somewhere about your neck, on the night when you experienced your
first horrible dream. Is there still any soreness?"</p>

<p>"None at all," I answered.</p>

<p>"Can you indicate with your finger about the point at which you
think this occurred?"</p>

<p>"Very little below my throat&mdash;here," I answered.</p>

<p>I wore a morning dress, which covered the place I pointed to.</p>

<p>"Now you can satisfy yourself," said the doctor. "You won't mind
your papa's lowering your dress a very little. It is necessary, to
detect a symptom of the complaint under which you have been
suffering."</p>

<p>I acquiesced. It was only an inch or two below the edge of my
collar.</p>

<p>"God bless me!&mdash;so it is," exclaimed my father, growing
pale.</p>

<p>"You see it now with your own eyes," said the doctor, with a gloomy
triumph.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I exclaimed, beginning to be frightened.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear young lady, but a small blue spot, about the size
of the tip of your little finger; and now," he continued, turning to
papa, "the question is what is best to be done?"</p>

<p>"Is there any danger?" I urged, in great trepidation.</p>

<p>"I trust not, my dear," answered the doctor. "I don't see why you
should not recover. I don't see why you should not begin immediately to
get better. That is the point at which the sense of strangulation
begins?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;recollect as well as you can&mdash;the same point was a
kind of center of that thrill which you described just now, like the
current of a cold stream running against you?"</p>

<p>"It may have been; I think it was."</p>

<p>"Ay, you see?" he added, turning to my father. "Shall I say a word
to Madame?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said my father.</p>

<p>He called Madame to him, and said:</p>

<p>"I find my young friend here far from well. It won't be of any great
consequence, I hope; but it will be necessary that some steps be taken,
which I will explain by-and-by; but in the meantime, Madame, you will
be so good as not to let Miss Laura be alone for one moment. That is
the only direction I need give for the present. It is
indispensable."</p>

<p>"We may rely upon your kindness, Madame, I know," added my
father.</p>

<p>Madame satisfied him eagerly.</p>

<p>"And you, dear Laura, I know you will observe the doctor's
direction."</p>

<p>"I shall have to ask your opinion upon another patient, whose
symptoms slightly resemble those of my daughter, that have just been
detailed to you&mdash;very much milder in degree, but I believe quite
of the same sort. She is a young lady&mdash;our guest; but as you say
you will be passing this way again this evening, you can't do better
than take your supper here, and you can then see her. She does not come
down till the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I thank you," said the doctor. "I shall be with you, then, at about
seven this evening."</p>

<p>And then they repeated their directions to me and to Madame, and
with this parting charge my father left us, and walked out with the
doctor; and I saw them pacing together up and down between the road and
the moat, on the grassy platform in front of the castle, evidently
absorbed in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>The doctor did not return. I saw him mount his horse there, take his
leave, and ride away eastward through the forest.</p>

<p>Nearly at the same time I saw the man arrive from Dranfield with the
letters, and dismount and hand the bag to my father.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Madame and I were both busy, lost in conjecture as
to the reasons of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor
and my father had concurred in imposing. Madame, as she afterwards told
me, was afraid the doctor apprehended a sudden seizure, and that,
without prompt assistance, I might either lose my life in a fit, or at
least be seriously hurt.</p>

<p>The interpretation did not strike me; and I fancied, perhaps luckily
for my nerves, that the arrangement was prescribed simply to secure a
companion, who would prevent my taking too much exercise, or eating
unripe fruit, or doing any of the fifty foolish things to which young
people are supposed to be prone.</p>

<p>About half an hour after my father came in&mdash;he had a letter in
his hand&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>"This letter had been delayed; it is from General Spielsdorf. He
might have been here yesterday, he may not come till tomorrow or he may
be here today."</p>

<p>He put the open letter into my hand; but he did not look pleased, as
he used when a guest, especially one so much loved as the General, was
coming.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he looked as if he wished him at the bottom of the
Red Sea. There was plainly something on his mind which he did not
choose to divulge.</p>

<p>"Papa, darling, will you tell me this?" said I, suddenly laying my
hand on his arm, and looking, I am sure, imploringly in his face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he answered, smoothing my hair caressingly over my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Does the doctor think me very ill?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; he thinks, if right steps are taken, you will be quite
well again, at least, on the high road to a complete recovery, in a day
or two," he answered, a little dryly. "I wish our good friend, the
General, had chosen any other time; that is, I wish you had been
perfectly well to receive him."</p>

<p>"But do tell me, papa," I insisted, "what does he think is the
matter with me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; you must not plague me with questions," he answered, with
more irritation than I ever remember him to have displayed before; and
seeing that I looked wounded, I suppose, he kissed me, and added, "You
shall know all about it in a day or two; that is, all that I know. In
the meantime you are not to trouble your head about it."</p>

<p>He turned and left the room, but came back before I had done
wondering and puzzling over the oddity of all this; it was merely to
say that he was going to Karnstein, and had ordered the carriage to be
ready at twelve, and that I and Madame should accompany him; he was
going to see the priest who lived near those picturesque grounds, upon
business, and as Carmilla had never seen them, she could follow, when
she came down, with Mademoiselle, who would bring materials for what
you call a picnic, which might be laid for us in the ruined castle.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, accordingly, I was ready, and not long after, my
father, Madame and I set out upon our projected drive.</p>

<p>Passing the drawbridge we turn to the right, and follow the road
over the steep Gothic bridge, westward, to reach the deserted village
and ruined castle of Karnstein.</p>

<p>No sylvan drive can be fancied prettier. The ground breaks into
gentle hills and hollows, all clothed with beautiful wood, totally
destitute of the comparative formality which artificial planting and
early culture and pruning impart.</p>

<p>The irregularities of the ground often lead the road out of its
course, and cause it to wind beautifully round the sides of broken
hollows and the steeper sides of the hills, among varieties of ground
almost inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Turning one of these points, we suddenly encountered our old friend,
the General, riding towards us, attended by a mounted servant. His
portmanteaus were following in a hired wagon, such as we term a
cart.</p>

<p>The General dismounted as we pulled up, and, after the usual
greetings, was easily persuaded to accept the vacant seat in the
carriage and send his horse on with his servant to the schloss.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-10"></a>Chapter X - <i>Bereaved</i></h2>

<p>It was about ten months since we had last seen him: but that time
had sufficed to make an alteration of years in his appearance. He had
grown thinner; something of gloom and anxiety had taken the place of
that cordial serenity which used to characterize his features. His dark
blue eyes, always penetrating, now gleamed with a sterner light from
under his shaggy grey eyebrows. It was not such a change as grief alone
usually induces, and angrier passions seemed to have had their share in
bringing it about.</p>

<p>We had not long resumed our drive, when the General began to talk,
with his usual soldierly directness, of the bereavement, as he termed
it, which he had sustained in the death of his beloved niece and ward;
and he then broke out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury,
inveighing against the "hellish arts" to which she had fallen a victim,
and expressing, with more exasperation than piety, his wonder that
Heaven should tolerate so monstrous an indulgence of the lusts and
malignity of hell.</p>

<p>My father, who saw at once that something very extraordinary had
befallen, asked him, if not too painful to him, to detail the
circumstances which he thought justified the strong terms in which he
expressed himself.</p>

<p>"I should tell you all with pleasure," said the General, "but you
would not believe me."</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because," he answered testily, "you believe in nothing but what
consists with your own prejudices and illusions. I remember when I was
like you, but I have learned better."</p>

<p>"Try me," said my father; "I am not such a dogmatist as you suppose.
Besides which, I very well know that you generally require proof for
what you believe, and am, therefore, very strongly predisposed to
respect your conclusions."</p>

<p>"You are right in supposing that I have not been led lightly into a
belief in the marvelous&mdash;for what I have experienced is
marvelous&mdash;and I have been forced by extraordinary evidence to
credit that which ran counter, diametrically, to all my theories. I
have been made the dupe of a preternatural conspiracy."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his professions of confidence in the General's
penetration, I saw my father, at this point, glance at the General,
with, as I thought, a marked suspicion of his sanity.</p>

<p>The General did not see it, luckily. He was looking gloomily and
curiously into the glades and vistas of the woods that were opening
before us.</p>

<p>"You are going to the Ruins of Karnstein?" he said. "Yes, it is a
lucky coincidence; do you know I was going to ask you to bring me there
to inspect them. I have a special object in exploring. There is a
ruined chapel, ain't there, with a great many tombs of that extinct
family?"</p>

<p>"So there are&mdash;highly interesting," said my father. "I hope you
are thinking of claiming the title and estates?"</p>

<p>My father said this gaily, but the General did not recollect the
laugh, or even the smile, which courtesy exacts for a friend's joke; on
the contrary, he looked grave and even fierce, ruminating on a matter
that stirred his anger and horror.</p>

<p>"Something very different," he said, gruffly. "I mean to unearth
some of those fine people. I hope, by God's blessing, to accomplish a
pious sacrilege here, which will relieve our earth of certain monsters,
and enable honest people to sleep in their beds without being assailed
by murderers. I have strange things to tell you, my dear friend, such
as I myself would have scouted as incredible a few months since."</p>

<p>My father looked at him again, but this time not with a glance of
suspicion&mdash;with an eye, rather, of keen intelligence and
alarm.</p>

<p>"The house of Karnstein," he said, "has been long extinct: a hundred
years at least. My dear wife was maternally descended from the
Karnsteins. But the name and title have long ceased to exist. The
castle is a ruin; the very village is deserted; it is fifty years since
the smoke of a chimney was seen there; not a roof left."</p>

<p>"Quite true. I have heard a great deal about that since I last saw
you; a great deal that will astonish you. But I had better relate
everything in the order in which it occurred," said the General. "You
saw my dear ward&mdash;my child, I may call her. No creature could have
been more beautiful, and only three months ago none more blooming."</p>

<p>"Yes, poor thing! when I saw her last she certainly was quite
lovely," said my father. "I was grieved and shocked more than I can
tell you, my dear friend; I knew what a blow it was to you."</p>

<p>He took the General's hand, and they exchanged a kind pressure.
Tears gathered in the old soldier's eyes. He did not seek to conceal
them. He said:</p>

<p>"We have been very old friends; I knew you would feel for me,
childless as I am. She had become an object of very near interest to
me, and repaid my care by an affection that cheered my home and made my
life happy. That is all gone. The years that remain to me on earth may
not be very long; but by God's mercy I hope to accomplish a service to
mankind before I die, and to subserve the vengeance of Heaven upon the
fiends who have murdered my poor child in the spring of her hopes and
beauty!"</p>

<p>"You said, just now, that you intended relating everything as it
occurred," said my father. "Pray do; I assure you that it is not mere
curiosity that prompts me."</p>

<p>By this time we had reached the point at which the Drunstall road,
by which the General had come, diverges from the road which we were
traveling to Karnstein.</p>

<p>"How far is it to the ruins?" inquired the General, looking
anxiously forward.</p>

<p>"About half a league," answered my father. "Pray let us hear the
story you were so good as to promise."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-11"></a>Chapter XI - <i>The Story</i></h2>

<p>"With all my heart," said the General, with an effort; and after a
short pause in which to arrange his subject, he commenced one of the
strangest narratives I ever heard.</p>

<p>"My dear child was looking forward with great pleasure to the visit
you had been so good as to arrange for her to your charming daughter."
Here he made me a gallant but melancholy bow. "In the meantime we had
an invitation to my old friend the Count Carlsfeld, whose schloss is
about six leagues to the other side of Karnstein. It was to attend the
series of fetes which, you remember, were given by him in honor of his
illustrious visitor, the Grand Duke Charles."</p>

<p>"Yes; and very splendid, I believe, they were," said my father.</p>

<p>"Princely! But then his hospitalities are quite regal. He has
Aladdin's lamp. The night from which my sorrow dates was devoted to a
magnificent masquerade. The grounds were thrown open, the trees hung
with colored lamps. There was such a display of fireworks as Paris
itself had never witnessed. And such music&mdash;music, you know, is my
weakness&mdash;such ravishing music! The finest instrumental band,
perhaps, in the world, and the finest singers who could be collected
from all the great operas in Europe. As you wandered through these
fantastically illuminated grounds, the moon-lighted chateau throwing a
rosy light from its long rows of windows, you would suddenly hear these
ravishing voices stealing from the silence of some grove, or rising
from boats upon the lake. I felt myself, as I looked and listened,
carried back into the romance and poetry of my early youth.</p>

<p>"When the fireworks were ended, and the ball beginning, we returned
to the noble suite of rooms that were thrown open to the dancers. A
masked ball, you know, is a beautiful sight; but so brilliant a
spectacle of the kind I never saw before.</p>

<p>"It was a very aristocratic assembly. I was myself almost the only
'nobody' present.</p>

<p>"My dear child was looking quite beautiful. She wore no mask. Her
excitement and delight added an unspeakable charm to her features,
always lovely. I remarked a young lady, dressed magnificently, but
wearing a mask, who appeared to me to be observing my ward with
extraordinary interest. I had seen her, earlier in the evening, in the
great hall, and again, for a few minutes, walking near us, on the
terrace under the castle windows, similarly employed. A lady, also
masked, richly and gravely dressed, and with a stately air, like a
person of rank, accompanied her as a chaperon.</p>

<p>"Had the young lady not worn a mask, I could, of course, have been
much more certain upon the question whether she was really watching my
poor darling.</p>

<p>"I am now well assured that she was.</p>

<p>"We were now in one of the salons. My poor dear child had been
dancing, and was resting a little in one of the chairs near the door; I
was standing near. The two ladies I have mentioned had approached and
the younger took the chair next my ward; while her companion stood
beside me, and for a little time addressed herself, in a low tone, to
her charge.</p>

<p>"Availing herself of the privilege of her mask, she turned to me,
and in the tone of an old friend, and calling me by my name, opened a
conversation with me, which piqued my curiosity a good deal. She
referred to many scenes where she had met me&mdash;at Court, and at
distinguished houses. She alluded to little incidents which I had long
ceased to think of, but which, I found, had only lain in abeyance in my
memory, for they instantly started into life at her touch.</p>

<p>"I became more and more curious to ascertain who she was, every
moment. She parried my attempts to discover very adroitly and
pleasantly. The knowledge she showed of many passages in my life seemed
to me all but unaccountable; and she appeared to take a not unnatural
pleasure in foiling my curiosity, and in seeing me flounder in my eager
perplexity, from one conjecture to another.</p>

<p>"In the meantime the young lady, whom her mother called by the odd
name of Millarca, when she once or twice addressed her, had, with the
same ease and grace, got into conversation with my ward.</p>

<p>"She introduced herself by saying that her mother was a very old
acquaintance of mine. She spoke of the agreeable audacity which a mask
rendered practicable; she talked like a friend; she admired her dress,
and insinuated very prettily her admiration of her beauty. She amused
her with laughing criticisms upon the people who crowded the ballroom,
and laughed at my poor child's fun. She was very witty and lively when
she pleased, and after a time they had grown very good friends, and the
young stranger lowered her mask, displaying a remarkably beautiful
face. I had never seen it before, neither had my dear child. But though
it was new to us, the features were so engaging, as well as lovely,
that it was impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully. My poor
girl did so. I never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight,
unless, indeed, it was the stranger herself, who seemed quite to have
lost her heart to her.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, availing myself of the license of a masquerade, I
put not a few questions to the elder lady.</p>

<p>"'You have puzzled me utterly,' I said, laughing. 'Is that not
enough? Won't you, now, consent to stand on equal terms, and do me the
kindness to remove your mask?'</p>

<p>"'Can any request be more unreasonable?' she replied. 'Ask a lady to
yield an advantage! Beside, how do you know you should recognize me?
Years make changes.'</p>

<p>"'As you see,' I said, with a bow, and, I suppose, a rather
melancholy little laugh.</p>

<p>"'As philosophers tell us,' she said; 'and how do you know that a
sight of my face would help you?'</p>

<p>"'I should take chance for that,' I answered. 'It is vain trying to
make yourself out an old woman; your figure betrays you.'</p>

<p>"'Years, nevertheless, have passed since I saw you, rather since you
saw me, for that is what I am considering. Millarca, there, is my
daughter; I cannot then be young, even in the opinion of people whom
time has taught to be indulgent, and I may not like to be compared with
what you remember me. You have no mask to remove. You can offer me
nothing in exchange.'</p>

<p>"'My petition is to your pity, to remove it.'</p>

<p>"'And mine to yours, to let it stay where it is,' she replied.</p>

<p>"'Well, then, at least you will tell me whether you are French or
German; you speak both languages so perfectly.'</p>

<p>"'I don't think I shall tell you that, General; you intend a
surprise, and are meditating the particular point of attack.'</p>

<p>"'At all events, you won't deny this,' I said, 'that being honored
by your permission to converse, I ought to know how to address you.
Shall I say Madame la Comtesse?'</p>

<p>"She laughed, and she would, no doubt, have met me with another
evasion&mdash;if, indeed, I can treat any occurrence in an interview
every circumstance of which was prearranged, as I now believe, with the
profoundest cunning, as liable to be modified by accident.</p>

<p>"'As to that,' she began; but she was interrupted, almost as she
opened her lips, by a gentleman, dressed in black, who looked
particularly elegant and distinguished, with this drawback, that his
face was the most deadly pale I ever saw, except in death. He was in no
masquerade&mdash;in the plain evening dress of a gentleman; and he
said, without a smile, but with a courtly and unusually low
bow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Will Madame la Comtesse permit me to say a very few words which
may interest her?'</p>

<p>"The lady turned quickly to him, and touched her lip in token of
silence; she then said to me, 'Keep my place for me, General; I shall
return when I have said a few words.'</p>

<p>"And with this injunction, playfully given, she walked a little
aside with the gentleman in black, and talked for some minutes,
apparently very earnestly. They then walked away slowly together in the
crowd, and I lost them for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I spent the interval in cudgeling my brains for a conjecture as to
the identity of the lady who seemed to remember me so kindly, and I was
thinking of turning about and joining in the conversation between my
pretty ward and the Countess's daughter, and trying whether, by the
time she returned, I might not have a surprise in store for her, by
having her name, title, chateau, and estates at my fingers' ends. But
at this moment she returned, accompanied by the pale man in black, who
said:</p>

<p>"'I shall return and inform Madame la Comtesse when her carriage is
at the door.'</p>

<p>"He withdrew with a bow."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-12"></a>Chapter XII - <i>A Petition</i></h2>

<p>"'Then we are to lose Madame la Comtesse, but I hope only for a few
hours,' I said, with a low bow.</p>

<p>"'It may be that only, or it may be a few weeks. It was very unlucky
his speaking to me just now as he did. Do you now know me?'</p>

<p>"I assured her I did not.</p>

<p>"'You shall know me,' she said, 'but not at present. We are older
and better friends than, perhaps, you suspect. I cannot yet declare
myself. I shall in three weeks pass your beautiful schloss, about which
I have been making enquiries. I shall then look in upon you for an hour
or two, and renew a friendship which I never think of without a
thousand pleasant recollections. This moment a piece of news has
reached me like a thunderbolt. I must set out now, and travel by a
devious route, nearly a hundred miles, with all the dispatch I can
possibly make. My perplexities multiply. I am only deterred by the
compulsory reserve I practice as to my name from making a very singular
request of you. My poor child has not quite recovered her strength. Her
horse fell with her, at a hunt which she had ridden out to witness, her
nerves have not yet recovered the shock, and our physician says that
she must on no account exert herself for some time to come. We came
here, in consequence, by very easy stages&mdash;hardly six leagues a
day. I must now travel day and night, on a mission of life and
death&mdash;a mission the critical and momentous nature of which I
shall be able to explain to you when we meet, as I hope we shall, in a
few weeks, without the necessity of any concealment.'</p>

<p>"She went on to make her petition, and it was in the tone of a
person from whom such a request amounted to conferring, rather than
seeking a favor.</p>

<p>"This was only in manner, and, as it seemed, quite unconsciously.
Than the terms in which it was expressed, nothing could be more
deprecatory. It was simply that I would consent to take charge of her
daughter during her absence.</p>

<p>"This was, all things considered, a strange, not to say, an
audacious request. She in some sort disarmed me, by stating and
admitting everything that could be urged against it, and throwing
herself entirely upon my chivalry. At the same moment, by a fatality
that seems to have predetermined all that happened, my poor child came
to my side, and, in an undertone, besought me to invite her new friend,
Millarca, to pay us a visit. She had just been sounding her, and
thought, if her mamma would allow her, she would like it extremely.</p>

<p>"At another time I should have told her to wait a little, until, at
least, we knew who they were. But I had not a moment to think in. The
two ladies assailed me together, and I must confess the refined and
beautiful face of the young lady, about which there was something
extremely engaging, as well as the elegance and fire of high birth,
determined me; and, quite overpowered, I submitted, and undertook, too
easily, the care of the young lady, whom her mother called
Millarca.</p>

<p>"The Countess beckoned to her daughter, who listened with grave
attention while she told her, in general terms, how suddenly and
peremptorily she had been summoned, and also of the arrangement she had
made for her under my care, adding that I was one of her earliest and
most valued friends.</p>

<p>"I made, of course, such speeches as the case seemed to call for,
and found myself, on reflection, in a position which I did not half
like.</p>

<p>"The gentleman in black returned, and very ceremoniously conducted
the lady from the room.</p>

<p>"The demeanor of this gentleman was such as to impress me with the
conviction that the Countess was a lady of very much more importance
than her modest title alone might have led me to assume.</p>

<p>"Her last charge to me was that no attempt was to be made to learn
more about her than I might have already guessed, until her return. Our
distinguished host, whose guest she was, knew her reasons.</p>

<p>"'But here,' she said, 'neither I nor my daughter could safely
remain for more than a day. I removed my mask imprudently for a moment,
about an hour ago, and, too late, I fancied you saw me. So I resolved
to seek an opportunity of talking a little to you. Had I found that you
had seen me, I would have thrown myself on your high sense of honor to
keep my secret some weeks. As it is, I am satisfied that you did not
see me; but if you now suspect, or, on reflection, should suspect, who
I am, I commit myself, in like manner, entirely to your honor. My
daughter will observe the same secrecy, and I well know that you will,
from time to time, remind her, lest she should thoughtlessly disclose
it.'</p>

<p>"She whispered a few words to her daughter, kissed her hurriedly
twice, and went away, accompanied by the pale gentleman in black, and
disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>"'In the next room,' said Millarca, 'there is a window that looks
upon the hall door. I should like to see the last of mamma, and to kiss
my hand to her.'</p>

<p>"We assented, of course, and accompanied her to the window. We
looked out, and saw a handsome old-fashioned carriage, with a troop of
couriers and footmen. We saw the slim figure of the pale gentleman in
black, as he held a thick velvet cloak, and placed it about her
shoulders and threw the hood over her head. She nodded to him, and just
touched his hand with hers. He bowed low repeatedly as the door closed,
and the carriage began to move.</p>

<p>"'She is gone,' said Millarca, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"'She is gone,' I repeated to myself, for the first time&mdash;in
the hurried moments that had elapsed since my consent&mdash;reflecting
upon the folly of my act.</p>

<p>"'She did not look up,' said the young lady, plaintively.</p>

<p>"'The Countess had taken off her mask, perhaps, and did not care to
show her face,' I said; 'and she could not know that you were in the
window.'</p>

<p>"She sighed, and looked in my face. She was so beautiful that I
relented. I was sorry I had for a moment repented of my hospitality,
and I determined to make her amends for the unavowed churlishness of my
reception.</p>

<p>"The young lady, replacing her mask, joined my ward in persuading me
to return to the grounds, where the concert was soon to be renewed. We
did so, and walked up and down the terrace that lies under the castle
windows.</p>

<p>"Millarca became very intimate with us, and amused us with lively
descriptions and stories of most of the great people whom we saw upon
the terrace. I liked her more and more every minute. Her gossip without
being ill-natured, was extremely diverting to me, who had been so long
out of the great world. I thought what life she would give to our
sometimes lonely evenings at home.</p>

<p>"This ball was not over until the morning sun had almost reached the
horizon. It pleased the Grand Duke to dance till then, so loyal people
could not go away, or think of bed.</p>

<p>"We had just got through a crowded saloon, when my ward asked me
what had become of Millarca. I thought she had been by her side, and
she fancied she was by mine. The fact was, we had lost her.</p>

<p>"All my efforts to find her were vain. I feared that she had
mistaken, in the confusion of a momentary separation from us, other
people for her new friends, and had, possibly, pursued and lost them in
the extensive grounds which were thrown open to us.</p>

<p>"Now, in its full force, I recognized a new folly in my having
undertaken the charge of a young lady without so much as knowing her
name; and fettered as I was by promises, of the reasons for imposing
which I knew nothing, I could not even point my inquiries by saying
that the missing young lady was the daughter of the Countess who had
taken her departure a few hours before.</p>

<p>"Morning broke. It was clear daylight before I gave up my search. It
was not till near two o'clock next day that we heard anything of my
missing charge.</p>

<p>"At about that time a servant knocked at my niece's door, to say
that he had been earnestly requested by a young lady, who appeared to
be in great distress, to make out where she could find the General
Baron Spielsdorf and the young lady his daughter, in whose charge she
had been left by her mother.</p>

<p>"There could be no doubt, notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy,
that our young friend had turned up; and so she had. Would to heaven we
had lost her!</p>

<p>"She told my poor child a story to account for her having failed to
recover us for so long. Very late, she said, she had got to the
housekeeper's bedroom in despair of finding us, and had then fallen
into a deep sleep which, long as it was, had hardly sufficed to recruit
her strength after the fatigues of the ball.</p>

<p>"That day Millarca came home with us. I was only too happy, after
all, to have secured so charming a companion for my dear girl."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-13"></a>Chapter XIII - <i>The Woodman</i></h2>

<p>"There soon, however, appeared some drawbacks. In the first place,
Millarca complained of extreme languor&mdash;the weakness that remained
after her late illness&mdash;and she never emerged from her room till
the afternoon was pretty far advanced. In the next place, it was
accidentally discovered, although she always locked her door on the
inside, and never disturbed the key from its place till she admitted
the maid to assist at her toilet, that she was undoubtedly sometimes
absent from her room in the very early morning, and at various times
later in the day, before she wished it to be understood that she was
stirring. She was repeatedly seen from the windows of the schloss, in
the first faint grey of the morning, walking through the trees, in an
easterly direction, and looking like a person in a trance. This
convinced me that she walked in her sleep. But this hypothesis did not
solve the puzzle. How did she pass out from her room, leaving the door
locked on the inside? How did she escape from the house without
unbarring door or window?</p>

<p>"In the midst of my perplexities, an anxiety of a far more urgent
kind presented itself.</p>

<p>"My dear child began to lose her looks and health, and that in a
manner so mysterious, and even horrible, that I became thoroughly
frightened.</p>

<p>"She was at first visited by appalling dreams; then, as she fancied,
by a specter, sometimes resembling Millarca, sometimes in the shape of
a beast, indistinctly seen, walking round the foot of her bed, from
side to side.</p>

<p>"Lastly came sensations. One, not unpleasant, but very peculiar, she
said, resembled the flow of an icy stream against her breast. At a
later time, she felt something like a pair of large needles pierce her,
a little below the throat, with a very sharp pain. A few nights after,
followed a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation; then came
unconsciousness."</p>

<p>I could hear distinctly every word the kind old General was saying,
because by this time we were driving upon the short grass that spreads
on either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which
had not shown the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century.</p>

<p>You may guess how strangely I felt as I heard my own symptoms so
exactly described in those which had been experienced by the poor girl
who, but for the catastrophe which followed, would have been at that
moment a visitor at my father's chateau. You may suppose, also, how I
felt as I heard him detail habits and mysterious peculiarities which
were, in fact, those of our beautiful guest, Carmilla!</p>

<p>A vista opened in the forest; we were on a sudden under the chimneys
and gables of the ruined village, and the towers and battlements of the
dismantled castle, round which gigantic trees are grouped, overhung us
from a slight eminence.</p>

<p>In a frightened dream I got down from the carriage, and in silence,
for we had each abundant matter for thinking; we soon mounted the
ascent, and were among the spacious chambers, winding stairs, and dark
corridors of the castle.</p>

<p>"And this was once the palatial residence of the Karnsteins!" said
the old General at length, as from a great window he looked out across
the village, and saw the wide, undulating expanse of forest. "It was a
bad family, and here its bloodstained annals were written," he
continued. "It is hard that they should, after death, continue to
plague the human race with their atrocious lusts. That is the chapel of
the Karnsteins, down there."</p>

<p>He pointed down to the grey walls of the Gothic building partly
visible through the foliage, a little way down the steep. "And I hear
the axe of a woodman," he added, "busy among the trees that surround
it; he possibly may give us the information of which I am in search,
and point out the grave of Mircalla, Countess of Karnstein. These
rustics preserve the local traditions of great families, whose stories
die out among the rich and titled so soon as the families themselves
become extinct."</p>

<p>"We have a portrait, at home, of Mircalla, the Countess Karnstein;
should you like to see it?" asked my father.</p>

<p>"Time enough, dear friend," replied the General. "I believe that I
have seen the original; and one motive which has led me to you earlier
than I at first intended, was to explore the chapel which we are now
approaching."</p>

<p>"What! see the Countess Mircalla," exclaimed my father; "why, she
has been dead more than a century!"</p>

<p>"Not so dead as you fancy, I am told," answered the General.</p>

<p>"I confess, General, you puzzle me utterly," replied my father,
looking at him, I fancied, for a moment with a return of the suspicion
I detected before. But although there was anger and detestation, at
times, in the old General's manner, there was nothing flighty.</p>

<p>"There remains to me," he said, as we passed under the heavy arch of
the Gothic church&mdash;for its dimensions would have justified its
being so styled&mdash;"but one object which can interest me during the
few years that remain to me on earth, and that is to wreak on her the
vengeance which, I thank God, may still be accomplished by a mortal
arm."</p>

<p>"What vengeance can you mean?" asked my father, in increasing
amazement.</p>

<p>"I mean, to decapitate the monster," he answered, with a fierce
flush, and a stamp that echoed mournfully through the hollow ruin, and
his clenched hand was at the same moment raised, as if it grasped the
handle of an axe, while he shook it ferociously in the air.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed my father, more than ever bewildered.</p>

<p>"To strike her head off."</p>

<p>"Cut her head off!"</p>

<p>"Aye, with a hatchet, with a spade, or with anything that can cleave
through her murderous throat. You shall hear," he answered, trembling
with rage. And hurrying forward he said:</p>

<p>"That beam will answer for a seat; your dear child is fatigued; let
her be seated, and I will, in a few sentences, close my dreadful
story."</p>

<p>The squared block of wood, which lay on the grass-grown pavement of
the chapel, formed a bench on which I was very glad to seat myself, and
in the meantime the General called to the woodman, who had been
removing some boughs which leaned upon the old walls; and, axe in hand,
the hardy old fellow stood before us.</p>

<p>He could not tell us anything of these monuments; but there was an
old man, he said, a ranger of this forest, at present sojourning in the
house of the priest, about two miles away, who could point out every
monument of the old Karnstein family; and, for a trifle, he undertook
to bring him back with him, if we would lend him one of our horses, in
little more than half an hour.</p>

<p>"Have you been long employed about this forest?" asked my father of
the old man.</p>

<p>"I have been a woodman here," he answered in his patois, "under the
forester, all my days; so has my father before me, and so on, as many
generations as I can count up. I could show you the very house in the
village here, in which my ancestors lived."</p>

<p>"How came the village to be deserted?" asked the General.</p>

<p>"It was troubled by revenants, sir; several were tracked to their
graves, there detected by the usual tests, and extinguished in the
usual way, by decapitation, by the stake, and by burning; but not until
many of the villagers were killed.</p>

<p>"But after all these proceedings according to law," he
continued&mdash;"so many graves opened, and so many vampires deprived
of their horrible animation&mdash;the village was not relieved. But a
Moravian nobleman, who happened to be traveling this way, heard how
matters were, and being skilled&mdash;as many people are in his
country&mdash;in such affairs, he offered to deliver the village from
its tormentor. He did so thus: There being a bright moon that night, he
ascended, shortly after sunset, the towers of the chapel here, from
whence he could distinctly see the churchyard beneath him; you can see
it from that window. From this point he watched until he saw the
vampire come out of his grave, and place near it the linen clothes in
which he had been folded, and then glide away towards the village to
plague its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The stranger, having seen all this, came down from the steeple,
took the linen wrappings of the vampire, and carried them up to the top
of the tower, which he again mounted. When the vampire returned from
his prowlings and missed his clothes, he cried furiously to the
Moravian, whom he saw at the summit of the tower, and who, in reply,
beckoned him to ascend and take them. Whereupon the vampire, accepting
his invitation, began to climb the steeple, and so soon as he had
reached the battlements, the Moravian, with a stroke of his sword,
clove his skull in twain, hurling him down to the churchyard, whither,
descending by the winding stairs, the stranger followed and cut his
head off, and next day delivered it and the body to the villagers, who
duly impaled and burnt them.</p>

<p>"This Moravian nobleman had authority from the then head of the
family to remove the tomb of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, which he did
effectually, so that in a little while its site was quite
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Can you point out where it stood?" asked the General, eagerly.</p>

<p>The forester shook his head, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Not a soul living could tell you that now," he said; "besides, they
say her body was removed; but no one is sure of that either."</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, as time pressed, he dropped his axe and
departed, leaving us to hear the remainder of the General's strange
story.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-14"></a>Chapter XIV - <i>The Meeting</i></h2>

<p>"My beloved child," he resumed, "was now growing rapidly worse. The
physician who attended her had failed to produce the slightest
impression on her disease, for such I then supposed it to be. He saw my
alarm, and suggested a consultation. I called in an abler physician,
from Gratz.</p>

<p>"Several days elapsed before he arrived. He was a good and pious, as
well as a learned man. Having seen my poor ward together, they withdrew
to my library to confer and discuss. I, from the adjoining room, where
I awaited their summons, heard these two gentlemen's voices raised in
something sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion. I knocked
at the door and entered. I found the old physician from Gratz
maintaining his theory. His rival was combating it with undisguised
ridicule, accompanied with bursts of laughter. This unseemly
manifestation subsided and the altercation ended on my entrance.</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said my first physician, 'my learned brother seems to think
that you want a conjuror, and not a doctor.'</p>

<p>"'Pardon me,' said the old physician from Gratz, looking displeased,
'I shall state my own view of the case in my own way another time. I
grieve, Monsieur le General, that by my skill and science I can be of
no use. Before I go I shall do myself the honor to suggest something to
you.'</p>

<p>"He seemed thoughtful, and sat down at a table and began to
write.</p>

<p>"Profoundly disappointed, I made my bow, and as I turned to go, the
other doctor pointed over his shoulder to his companion who was
writing, and then, with a shrug, significantly touched his
forehead.</p>

<p>"This consultation, then, left me precisely where I was. I walked
out into the grounds, all but distracted. The doctor from Gratz, in ten
or fifteen minutes, overtook me. He apologized for having followed me,
but said that he could not conscientiously take his leave without a few
words more. He told me that he could not be mistaken; no natural
disease exhibited the same symptoms; and that death was already very
near. There remained, however, a day, or possibly two, of life. If the
fatal seizure were at once arrested, with great care and skill her
strength might possibly return. But all hung now upon the confines of
the irrevocable. One more assault might extinguish the last spark of
vitality which is, every moment, ready to die.</p>

<p>"'And what is the nature of the seizure you speak of?' I
entreated.</p>

<p>"'I have stated all fully in this note, which I place in your hands
upon the distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman,
and open my letter in his presence, and on no account read it till he
is with you; you would despise it else, and it is a matter of life and
death. Should the priest fail you, then, indeed, you may read it.'</p>

<p>"He asked me, before taking his leave finally, whether I would wish
to see a man curiously learned upon the very subject, which, after I
had read his letter, would probably interest me above all others, and
he urged me earnestly to invite him to visit him there; and so took his
leave.</p>

<p>"The ecclesiastic was absent, and I read the letter by myself. At
another time, or in another case, it might have excited my ridicule.
But into what quackeries will not people rush for a last chance, where
all accustomed means have failed, and the life of a beloved object is
at stake?</p>

<p>"Nothing, you will say, could be more absurd than the learned man's
letter.</p>

<p>"It was monstrous enough to have consigned him to a madhouse. He
said that the patient was suffering from the visits of a vampire! The
punctures which she described as having occurred near the throat, were,
he insisted, the insertion of those two long, thin, and sharp teeth
which, it is well known, are peculiar to vampires; and there could be
no doubt, he added, as to the well-defined presence of the small livid
mark which all concurred in describing as that induced by the demon's
lips, and every symptom described by the sufferer was in exact
conformity with those recorded in every case of a similar
visitation.</p>

<p>"Being myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such
portent as the vampire, the supernatural theory of the good doctor
furnished, in my opinion, but another instance of learning and
intelligence oddly associated with some one hallucination. I was so
miserable, however, that, rather than try nothing, I acted upon the
instructions of the letter.</p>

<p>"I concealed myself in the dark dressing room, that opened upon the
poor patient's room, in which a candle was burning, and watched there
till she was fast asleep. I stood at the door, peeping through the
small crevice, my sword laid on the table beside me, as my directions
prescribed, until, a little after one, I saw a large black object, very
ill-defined, crawl, as it seemed to me, over the foot of the bed, and
swiftly spread itself up to the poor girl's throat, where it swelled,
in a moment, into a great, palpitating mass.</p>

<p>"For a few moments I had stood petrified. I now sprang forward, with
my sword in my hand. The black creature suddenly contracted towards the
foot of the bed, glided over it, and, standing on the floor about a
yard below the foot of the bed, with a glare of skulking ferocity and
horror fixed on me, I saw Millarca. Speculating I know not what, I
struck at her instantly with my sword; but I saw her standing near the
door, unscathed. Horrified, I pursued, and struck again. She was gone;
and my sword flew to shivers against the door.</p>

<p>"I can't describe to you all that passed on that horrible night. The
whole house was up and stirring. The specter Millarca was gone. But her
victim was sinking fast, and before the morning dawned, she died."</p>

<p>The old General was agitated. We did not speak to him. My father
walked to some little distance, and began reading the inscriptions on
the tombstones; and thus occupied, he strolled into the door of a side
chapel to prosecute his researches. The General leaned against the
wall, dried his eyes, and sighed heavily. I was relieved on hearing the
voices of Carmilla and Madame, who were at that moment approaching. The
voices died away.</p>

<p>In this solitude, having just listened to so strange a story,
connected, as it was, with the great and titled dead, whose monuments
were moldering among the dust and ivy round us, and every incident of
which bore so awfully upon my own mysterious case&mdash;in this haunted
spot, darkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side, dense
and high above its noiseless walls&mdash;a horror began to steal over
me, and my heart sank as I thought that my friends were, after all, not
about to enter and disturb this triste and ominous scene.</p>

<p>The old General's eyes were fixed on the ground, as he leaned with
his hand upon the basement of a shattered monument.</p>

<p>Under a narrow, arched doorway, surmounted by one of those
demoniacal grotesques in which the cynical and ghastly fancy of old
Gothic carving delights, I saw very gladly the beautiful face and
figure of Carmilla enter the shadowy chapel.</p>

<p>I was just about to rise and speak, and nodded smiling, in answer to
her peculiarly engaging smile; when with a cry, the old man by my side
caught up the woodman's hatchet, and started forward. On seeing him a
brutalized change came over her features. It was an instantaneous and
horrible transformation, as she made a crouching step backwards. Before
I could utter a scream, he struck at her with all his force, but she
dived under his blow, and unscathed, caught him in her tiny grasp by
the wrist. He struggled for a moment to release his arm, but his hand
opened, the axe fell to the ground, and the girl was gone.</p>

<p>He staggered against the wall. His grey hair stood upon his head,
and a moisture shone over his face, as if he were at the point of
death.</p>

<p>The frightful scene had passed in a moment. The first thing I
recollect after, is Madame standing before me, and impatiently
repeating again and again, the question, "Where is Mademoiselle
Carmilla?"</p>

<p>I answered at length, "I don't know&mdash;I can't tell&mdash;she
went there," and I pointed to the door through which Madame had just
entered; "only a minute or two since."</p>

<p>"But I have been standing there, in the passage, ever since
Mademoiselle Carmilla entered; and she did not return."</p>

<p>She then began to call "Carmilla," through every door and passage
and from the windows, but no answer came.</p>

<p>"She called herself Carmilla?" asked the General, still
agitated.</p>

<p>"Carmilla, yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"Aye," he said; "that is Millarca. That is the same person who long
ago was called Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Depart from this accursed
ground, my poor child, as quickly as you can. Drive to the clergyman's
house, and stay there till we come. Begone! May you never behold
Carmilla more; you will not find her here."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-15"></a>Chapter XV - <i>Ordeal and Execution</i></h2>

<p>As he spoke one of the strangest-looking men I ever beheld entered
the chapel at the door through which Carmilla had made her entrance and
her exit. He was tall, narrow-chested, stooping, with high shoulders,
and dressed in black. His face was brown and dried in with deep
furrows; he wore an oddly-shaped hat with a broad leaf. His hair, long
and grizzled, hung on his shoulders. He wore a pair of gold spectacles,
and walked slowly, with an odd shambling gait, with his face sometimes
turned up to the sky, and sometimes bowed down towards the ground,
seemed to wear a perpetual smile; his long thin arms were swinging, and
his lank hands, in old black gloves ever so much too wide for them,
waving and gesticulating in utter abstraction.</p>

<p>"The very man!" exclaimed the General, advancing with manifest
delight. "My dear Baron, how happy I am to see you, I had no hope of
meeting you so soon." He signed to my father, who had by this time
returned, and leading the fantastic old gentleman, whom he called the
Baron to meet him. He introduced him formally, and they at once entered
into earnest conversation. The stranger took a roll of paper from his
pocket, and spread it on the worn surface of a tomb that stood by. He
had a pencil case in his fingers, with which he traced imaginary lines
from point to point on the paper, which from their often glancing from
it, together, at certain points of the building, I concluded to be a
plan of the chapel. He accompanied, what I may term his lecture, with
occasional readings from a dirty little book, whose yellow leaves were
closely written over.</p>

<p>They sauntered together down the side aisle, opposite to the spot
where I was standing, conversing as they went; then they began
measuring distances by paces, and finally they all stood together,
facing a piece of the sidewall, which they began to examine with great
minuteness; pulling off the ivy that clung over it, and rapping the
plaster with the ends of their sticks, scraping here, and knocking
there. At length they ascertained the existence of a broad marble
tablet, with letters carved in relief upon it.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the woodman, who soon returned, a monumental
inscription, and carved escutcheon, were disclosed. They proved to be
those of the long lost monument of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.</p>

<p>The old General, though not I fear given to the praying mood, raised
his hands and eyes to heaven, in mute thanksgiving for some
moments.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," I heard him say; "the commissioner will be here, and the
Inquisition will be held according to law."</p>

<p>Then turning to the old man with the gold spectacles, whom I have
described, he shook him warmly by both hands and said:</p>

<p>"Baron, how can I thank you? How can we all thank you? You will have
delivered this region from a plague that has scourged its inhabitants
for more than a century. The horrible enemy, thank God, is at last
tracked."</p>

<p>My father led the stranger aside, and the General followed. I know
that he had led them out of hearing, that he might relate my case, and
I saw them glance often quickly at me, as the discussion proceeded.</p>

<p>My father came to me, kissed me again and again, and leading me from
the chapel, said:</p>

<p>"It is time to return, but before we go home, we must add to our
party the good priest, who lives but a little way from this; and
persuade him to accompany us to the schloss."</p>

<p>In this quest we were successful: and I was glad, being unspeakably
fatigued when we reached home. But my satisfaction was changed to
dismay, on discovering that there were no tidings of Carmilla. Of the
scene that had occurred in the ruined chapel, no explanation was
offered to me, and it was clear that it was a secret which my father
for the present determined to keep from me.</p>

<p>The sinister absence of Carmilla made the remembrance of the scene
more horrible to me. The arrangements for the night were singular. Two
servants, and Madame were to sit up in my room that night; and the
ecclesiastic with my father kept watch in the adjoining dressing
room.</p>

<p>The priest had performed certain solemn rites that night, the
purport of which I did not understand any more than I comprehended the
reason of this extraordinary precaution taken for my safety during
sleep.</p>

<p>I saw all clearly a few days later.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Carmilla was followed by the discontinuance of
my nightly sufferings.</p>

<p>You have heard, no doubt, of the appalling superstition that
prevails in Upper and Lower Styria, in Moravia, Silesia, in Turkish
Serbia, in Poland, even in Russia; the superstition, so we must call
it, of the Vampire.</p>

<p>If human testimony, taken with every care and solemnity, judicially,
before commissions innumerable, each consisting of many members, all
chosen for integrity and intelligence, and constituting reports more
voluminous perhaps than exist upon any one other class of cases, is
worth anything, it is difficult to deny, or even to doubt the existence
of such a phenomenon as the Vampire.</p>

<p>For my part I have heard no theory by which to explain what I myself
have witnessed and experienced, other than that supplied by the ancient
and well-attested belief of the country.</p>

<p>The next day the formal proceedings took place in the Chapel of
Karnstein.</p>

<p>The grave of the Countess Mircalla was opened; and the General and
my father recognized each his perfidious and beautiful guest, in the
face now disclosed to view. The features, though a hundred and fifty
years had passed since her funeral, were tinted with the warmth of
life. Her eyes were open; no cadaverous smell exhaled from the coffin.
The two medical men, one officially present, the other on the part of
the promoter of the inquiry, attested the marvelous fact that there was
a faint but appreciable respiration, and a corresponding action of the
heart. The limbs were perfectly flexible, the flesh elastic; and the
leaden coffin floated with blood, in which to a depth of seven inches,
the body lay immersed.</p>

<p>Here then, were all the admitted signs and proofs of vampirism. The
body, therefore, in accordance with the ancient practice, was raised,
and a sharp stake driven through the heart of the vampire, who uttered
a piercing shriek at the moment, in all respects such as might escape
from a living person in the last agony. Then the head was struck off,
and a torrent of blood flowed from the severed neck. The body and head
were next placed on a pile of wood, and reduced to ashes, which were
thrown upon the river and borne away, and that territory has never
since been plagued by the visits of a vampire.</p>

<p>My father has a copy of the report of the Imperial Commission, with
the signatures of all who were present at these proceedings, attached
in verification of the statement. It is from this official paper that I
have summarized my account of this last shocking scene.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="c5-16"></a>Chapter XVI - <i>Conclusion</i></h2>

<p>I write all this you suppose with composure. But far from it; I
cannot think of it without agitation. Nothing but your earnest desire
so repeatedly expressed, could have induced me to sit down to a task
that has unstrung my nerves for months to come, and reinduced a shadow
of the unspeakable horror which years after my deliverance continued to
make my days and nights dreadful, and solitude insupportably
terrific.</p>

<p>Let me add a word or two about that quaint Baron Vordenburg, to
whose curious lore we were indebted for the discovery of the Countess
Mircalla's grave.</p>

<p>He had taken up his abode in Gratz, where, living upon a mere
pittance, which was all that remained to him of the once princely
estates of his family, in Upper Styria, he devoted himself to the
minute and laborious investigation of the marvelously authenticated
tradition of Vampirism. He had at his fingers' ends all the great and
little works upon the subject.</p>

<p>"Magia Posthuma," "Phlegon de Mirabilibus," "Augustinus de cura pro
Mortuis," "Philosophicae et Christianae Cogitationes de Vampiris," by
John Christofer Herenberg; and a thousand others, among which I
remember only a few of those which he lent to my father. He had a
voluminous digest of all the judicial cases, from which he had
extracted a system of principles that appear to govern&mdash;some
always, and others occasionally only&mdash;the condition of the
vampire. I may mention, in passing, that the deadly pallor attributed
to that sort of revenants, is a mere melodramatic fiction. They
present, in the grave, and when they show themselves in human society,
the appearance of healthy life. When disclosed to light in their
coffins, they exhibit all the symptoms that are enumerated as those
which proved the vampire-life of the long-dead Countess Karnstein.</p>

<p>How they escape from their graves and return to them for certain
hours every day, without displacing the clay or leaving any trace of
disturbance in the state of the coffin or the cerements, has always
been admitted to be utterly inexplicable. The amphibious existence of
the vampire is sustained by daily renewed slumber in the grave. Its
horrible lust for living blood supplies the vigor of its waking
existence. The vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing
vehemence, resembling the passion of love, by particular persons. In
pursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem,
for access to a particular object may be obstructed in a hundred ways.
It will never desist until it has satiated its passion, and drained the
very life of its coveted victim. But it will, in these cases, husband
and protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of an epicure,
and heighten it by the gradual approaches of an artful courtship. In
these cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent.
In ordinary ones it goes direct to its object, overpowers with
violence, and strangles and exhausts often at a single feast.</p>

<p>The vampire is, apparently, subject, in certain situations, to
special conditions. In the particular instance of which I have given
you a relation, Mircalla seemed to be limited to a name which, if not
her real one, should at least reproduce, without the omission or
addition of a single letter, those, as we say, anagrammatically, which
compose it.</p>

<p>Carmilla did this; so did Millarca.</p>

<p>My father related to the Baron Vordenburg, who remained with us for
two or three weeks after the expulsion of Carmilla, the story about the
Moravian nobleman and the vampire at Karnstein churchyard, and then he
asked the Baron how he had discovered the exact position of the
long-concealed tomb of the Countess Mircalla? The Baron's grotesque
features puckered up into a mysterious smile; he looked down, still
smiling on his worn spectacle case and fumbled with it. Then looking
up, he said:</p>

<p>"I have many journals, and other papers, written by that remarkable
man; the most curious among them is one treating of the visit of which
you speak, to Karnstein. The tradition, of course, discolors and
distorts a little. He might have been termed a Moravian nobleman, for
he had changed his abode to that territory, and was, beside, a noble.
But he was, in truth, a native of Upper Styria. It is enough to say
that in very early youth he had been a passionate and favored lover of
the beautiful Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Her early death plunged him
into inconsolable grief. It is the nature of vampires to increase and
multiply, but according to an ascertained and ghostly law.</p>

<p>"Assume, at starting, a territory perfectly free from that pest. How
does it begin, and how does it multiply itself? I will tell you. A
person, more or less wicked, puts an end to himself. A suicide, under
certain circumstances, becomes a vampire. That specter visits living
people in their slumbers; they die, and almost invariably, in the
grave, develop into vampires. This happened in the case of the
beautiful Mircalla, who was haunted by one of those demons. My
ancestor, Vordenburg, whose title I still bear, soon discovered this,
and in the course of the studies to which he devoted himself, learned a
great deal more.</p>

<p>"Among other things, he concluded that suspicion of vampirism would
probably fall, sooner or later, upon the dead Countess, who in life had
been his idol. He conceived a horror, be she what she might, of her
remains being profaned by the outrage of a posthumous execution. He has
left a curious paper to prove that the vampire, on its expulsion from
its amphibious existence, is projected into a far more horrible life;
and he resolved to save his once beloved Mircalla from this.</p>

<p>"He adopted the stratagem of a journey here, a pretended removal of
her remains, and a real obliteration of her monument. When age had
stolen upon him, and from the vale of years, he looked back on the
scenes he was leaving, he considered, in a different spirit, what he
had done, and a horror took possession of him. He made the tracings and
notes which have guided me to the very spot, and drew up a confession
of the deception that he had practiced. If he had intended any further
action in this matter, death prevented him; and the hand of a remote
descendant has, too late for many, directed the pursuit to the lair of
the beast."</p>

<p>We talked a little more, and among other things he said was
this:</p>

<p>"One sign of the vampire is the power of the hand. The slender hand
of Mircalla closed like a vice of steel on the General's wrist when he
raised the hatchet to strike. But its power is not confined to its
grasp; it leaves a numbness in the limb it seizes, which is slowly, if
ever, recovered from."</p>

<p>The following Spring my father took me a tour through Italy. We
remained away for more than a year. It was long before the terror of
recent events subsided; and to this hour the image of Carmilla returns
to memory with ambiguous alternations&mdash;sometimes the playful,
languid, beautiful girl; sometimes the writhing fiend I saw in the
ruined church; and often from a reverie I have started, fancying I
heard the light step of Carmilla at the drawing room door.</p>
