<h2>THE COMING</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>Magister Nicholas Udal, the Lady Mary's pedagogue, was very
hungry and very cold. He stood undecided in the mud of a lane in
the Austin Friars. The quickset hedges on either side were only
waist high and did not shelter him. The little houses all round
him of white daub with grey corner beams had been part of the old
friars' stables and offices. All that neighbourhood was a maze of
dwellings and gardens, with the hedges dry, the orchard trees
bare with frost, the arbours wintry and deserted. This
congregation of small cottages was like a patch of common that
squatters had taken; the great house of the Lord Privy Seal, who
had pulled down the monastery to make room for it, was a central
mass. Its gilded vanes were in the shape of men at arms, and tore
the ragged clouds with the banners on their lances. Nicholas Udal
looked at the roof and cursed the porter of it.</p>
<p>'He could have given me a cup of hypocras,' he said, and
muttered, as a man to whom Latin is more familiar than the vulgar
tongue, a hexameter about 'pocula plena.'</p>
<p>He had reached London before nine in one of the King's barges
that came from Greenwich to take musicians back that night at
four. He had breakfasted with the Lady Mary's women at six off
warm small beer and fresh meat, but it was eleven already, and he
had spent all his money upon good letters.</p>
<p>He muttered: '<i>Pauper sum, pateor, fateor, quod Di dant
fero</i>,' but it did not warm him.</p>
<p>The magister had been put in the Lady Mary's household by the
Lord Privy Seal, and he had a piece of news as to the Lady's
means of treasonable correspondence with the Emperor her uncle.
He had imagined that the news&mdash;which would hurt no one
because it was imaginary&mdash;might be worth some crowns to him.
But the Lord Privy Seal and all his secretaries had gone to
Greenwich before it was light, and there was nothing there for
the magister.</p>
<p>'You might have known as much, a learned man,' the porter had
snarled at him. 'Isn't the new Queen at Rochester? Would our lord
bide here? Didn't your magistership pass his barge on the
river?'</p>
<p>'Nay, it was still dark,' the magister answered. The porter
sniffed and slammed to the grating in the wicket. Being of the
Old Faith he hated those Lutherans&mdash;or those men of the New
Learning&mdash;that it pleased his master to employ.</p>
<p>Udal hesitated before the closed door; he hesitated in the
lane beyond the corner of the house. Perhaps there would be no
barges at the steps&mdash;no King's barges. The men of the Earl
Marshal's service, being Papists, would pelt him with mud if he
asked for a passage; even the Protestant lords' men would jeer at
him if he had no pence for them&mdash;and he had none. He would
do best to wait for the musicians' barge at four.</p>
<p>Then he must eat and shelter&mdash;and find a wench. He stood
in the mud: long, thin, brown in his doctor's gown of fur, with
his black flapped cap that buttoned well under his chin and let
out his brown, lean, shaven and humorous face like a woodpecker's
peering out of a hole in a tree.</p>
<p>The volumes beneath his arms were heavy: they poked out his
gown on each side, and the bitter cold pinched his finger ends as
if they had been caught in a door. The weight of the books
pleased him for there was much good letters there&mdash;a book of
Tully's epistles for himself and two volumes of Plautus' comedies
for the Lady Mary. But what among his day's purchases pleased him
most was a medallion in silver he had bought in Cheapside. It
showed on the one side Cupid in his sleep and on the other Venus
fondling a peacock. It was a heart-compelling gift to any wench
or lady of degree.</p>
<p>He puckered up his deprecatory and comical lips as he imagined
that that medal would purchase him the right to sigh dolorously
in front of whatever stomacher it finally adorned. He could pour
out odes in the learned tongue, for the space of a week, a day,
or an afternoon according to the rank, the kindness or the
patience of the recipient.</p>
<p>Something invisible and harsh touched his cheek. It might have
been snow or hail. He turned his thin cunning face to the clouds,
and they threatened a downpour. They raced along, like scarves of
vapour, so low that you might have thought of touching them if
you stood on tiptoe.</p>
<p>If he went to Westminster Hall to find Judge Combers, he would
get his belly well filled, but his back wet to the bone. At the
corner of the next hedge was the wicket gate of old Master Grocer
Badge. There the magister would find at least a piece of bread,
some salt and warmed mead. Judge Combers' wife was easy and
bounteous: but old John Badge's daughter was a fair and dainty
morsel.</p>
<p>He licked his full lips, leered to one side, muttered, 'A
curse on all lords' porters,' and made for John Badge's wicket.
Badge's dwelling had been part of the monastery's curing house.
It had some good rooms and two low storeys&mdash;but the tall
garden wall of the Lord Privy Seal had been built against its
side windows. It had been done without word or warning. Suddenly
workmen had pulled down old Badge's pigeon house, set it up
twenty yards further in, marked out a line and set up this high
wall that pressed so hard against the house end that there was
barely room for a man to squeeze between. The wall ran for half a
mile, and had swallowed the ground of twenty small householders.
But never a word of complaint had reached the ears of the Privy
Seal other than through his spies. It was, however, old Badge's
ceaseless grief. He had talked of it without interlude for two
years.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Badges' room&mdash;their houseplace&mdash;was fair sized,
but so low ceiled that it appeared long, dark and mysterious in
the winter light There was a tall press of dark wood with a face
minutely carved and fretted to represent the portal of Amiens
Cathedral, and a long black table, littered with large sheets of
printed matter in heavy black type, that diffused into the cold
room a faint smell of ink. The old man sat quavering in the
ingle. The light of the low fire glimmered on his silver hair, on
his black square cap two generations old; and, in his old eyes
that had seen three generations of changes, it twinkled starrily
as if they were spinning round. In the cock forward of his shaven
chin, and the settling down of his head into his shoulders, there
was a suggestion of sinister and sardonic malice. He was
muttering at his son:</p>
<p>'A stiff neck that knows no bending, God shall break one
day.'</p>
<p>His son, square, dark, with his sleeves rolled up showing
immense muscles developed at the levers of his presses, bent his
black beard and frowned his heavy brows above his printings.</p>
<p>'Doubtless God shall break His engine when its work is done,'
he muttered.</p>
<p>'You call Privy Seal God's engine?' the old man quavered
ironically. 'Thomas Cromwell is a brewer's drunken son. I know
them that have seen him in the stocks at Putney not thirty years
ago.'</p>
<p>The printer set two proofs side by side on the table and
frowningly compared them, shaking his head.</p>
<p>'He is the flail of the monks,' he said abstractedly. 'They
would have burned me and thousands more but for him.'</p>
<p>'Aye, and he has put up a fine wall where my arbour
stood.'</p>
<p>The printer took a chalk from behind his ear and made a score
down his page.</p>
<p>'A wall,' he muttered; 'my Lord Privy Seal hath set up a wall
against priestcraft all round these kingdoms&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Therefore you would have him welcome to forty feet of my
garden?' the old man drawled. 'He pulls down other folks'
crucifixes and sets up his own walls with other folks' blood for
mortar.'</p>
<p>The printer said darkly:</p>
<p>'Papists' blood.'</p>
<p>The old man pulled his nose and glanced down.</p>
<p>'We were all Papists in my day. I have made the pilgrimage to
Compostella, for all you mock me now.'</p>
<p>He turned his head to see Magister Udal entering the door
furtively and with eyes that leered round the room. Both the
Badges fell into sudden, and as if guilty, silence.</p>
<p>'<i>Domus parva, quies magna</i>,' the magister tittered, and
swept across the rushes in his furs to rub his hands before the
fire. 'When shall I teach your Margot the learned tongues?'</p>
<p>'When the sun sets in the East,' the printer muttered.</p>
<p>Udal sent to him over his shoulder, as words of
consolation:</p>
<p>'The new Queen is come to Rochester.'</p>
<p>The printer heaved an immense sigh:</p>
<p>'God be praised!'</p>
<p>Udal snickered, still over his shoulder:</p>
<p>'You see, neither have the men of the Old Faith put venom in
her food, nor have the Emperor's galleys taken her between Calais
and Sandwich.'</p>
<p>'Yet she comes ten days late.'</p>
<p>'Oh moody and suspicious artificer. <i>Afflavit deus!</i> The
wind hath blown dead against Calais shore this ten days.'</p>
<p>The old man pulled his long white nose:</p>
<p>'In my day we could pray to St Leonard for a fair wind.'</p>
<p>He was too old to care whether the magister reported his words
to Thomas Cromwell, the terrible Lord Privy Seal, and too
sardonic to keep silence for long about the inferiority of his
present day.</p>
<p>'When shall I teach the fair Margot the learned tongue?' Udal
asked again.</p>
<p>'When wolves teach conies how to play on pipes,' the master
printer snarled from his chest.</p>
<p>'The Lord Privy Seal never stood higher,' Udal said. 'The
match with the Cleves Lady hath gained him great honour.'</p>
<p>'God cement it!' the printer said fervently.</p>
<p>The old man pulled at his nose and gazed at nothing.</p>
<p>'I am tired with this chatter of the woman from Cleves,' he
croaked, like a malevolent raven. 'An Anne she is, and a
Lutheran. I mind we had an Anne and a Lutheran for Queen before.
She played the whore and lost her head.'</p>
<p>'Where's your niece Margot?' Udal asked the printer.</p>
<p>'You owe me nine crowns,' the old man said.</p>
<p>'I will give your Margot ten crowns' worth of lessons in
Latin.'</p>
<p>'Hold and enough,' the printer muttered heavily. 'Tags from
Seneca in a wench's mouth are rose garlands on a cow's
horns.'</p>
<p>'The best ladies in the land learn of me,' Udal answered.</p>
<p>'Aye, but my niece shall keep her virtue intact.'</p>
<p>'You defame the Lady Mary of England,' Udal snickered.</p>
<p>The old man said vigorously, 'God save her highness, and send
us her for Queen. Have you begged her to get me redress in the
matter of that wall?'</p>
<p>'Why, Providence was kind to her when it sent her me for her
master,' Udal said. 'I never had apter pupil saving only
one.'</p>
<p>'Shall Thomas Cromwell redress?' the old man asked.</p>
<p>'If good learning can make a good queen, trust me to render
her one,' Udal avoided the question. 'But alas! being declared
bastard&mdash;for very excellent reasons&mdash;she may
not&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'You owe me nine crowns,' old Badge threatened him. He picked
irritably at the fur on his gown and gazed at the carved leg of
the table. 'If you will not induce Privy Seal to pull down his
wall I will set the tipstaves on you.'</p>
<p>Master Udal laughed. 'I will give thy daughter ten crowns'
worth of lessons in the learned tongues.'</p>
<p>'You will receive another broken crown, magister,' the younger
John said moodily. 'Have you not scars enow by your
wenching?'</p>
<p>Udal pushed back the furs at his collar. 'Master Printer John
Badge the Younger,' he flickered, 'if you break my crown I will
break your chapel. You shall never have license to print another
libel. Give me your niece in wedlock?'</p>
<p>The old man said querulously, 'Here's a wantipole without ten
crowns would marry a wench with three beds and seven hundred
florins!'</p>
<p>Udal laughed. 'Call her to bring me meat and drink,' he said.
'Large words ill fill an empty stomach.'</p>
<p>The younger John went negligently to the great Flemish press.
He opened the face and revealed on its dark shelves a patty of
cold fish and a black jack. With heavy movements and a solemn
face he moved these things, with a knife and napkins, on to the
broad black table.</p>
<p>The old man pulled his nose again and grinned.</p>
<p>'Margot's in her chamber,' he chuckled. 'As you came up the
wicket way I sent my John to turn the key upon her. It's there at
his girdle.' It clinked indeed among rules, T-squares and
callipers at each footstep of the heavy printer between press and
table.</p>
<p>Magister Udal stretched his thin hands towards it. 'I will
give you the printing of the Lady Mary's commentary of Plautus
for that key,' he said.</p>
<p>The printer murmured 'Eat,' and set a great pewter
salt-cellar, carved like a Flemish pikeman, a foot high, heavily
upon the cloth.</p>
<p>Udal had the appetite of a wolf. He pulled off his cap the
better to let his jaws work.</p>
<p>'Here's a letter from the Doctor Wernken of Augsburg,' he
said. 'You may see how the Lutherans fare in Germany.'</p>
<p>The printer took the letter and read it, standing, frowning
and heavy. Magister Udal ate; the old man fingered his furs and,
leaning far back in his mended chair, gazed at nothing.</p>
<p>'Let me have the maid in wedlock,' Udal grunted between two
bites. 'Better women have looked favourably upon me. I had a
pupil in the North&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'She was a Howard, and the Howards are all whores,' the
printer said, over the letter. 'Your Doctor Wernken writes like
an Anabaptist.'</p>
<p>'They are even as the rest of womenkind,' Udal laughed, 'but
far quicker with their learning.'</p>
<p>A boy rising twenty, in a grey cloak that showed only his
bright red stockings and broad-toed red shoes, rattled the back
door and slammed it to. He pulled off his cap and shook it.</p>
<p>'It snows,' he said buoyantly, and then knelt before his
grandfather. The old man touched his grandson's cropped fair
head.</p>
<p>'<i>Benedicite</i>, grandson Hal Poins,' he muttered, and
relapsed into his gaze at the fire.</p>
<p>The young man bent his knee to his uncle and bowed low to the
magister. Being about the court, he had for Udal's learning and
office a reverence that neither the printer nor his grandfather
could share. He unfastened his grey cloak at the neck and cast it
into a corner after his hat. His figure flashed out, lithe,
young, a blaze of scarlet with a crowned rose embroidered upon a
chest rendered enormous by much wadding. He was serving his
apprenticeship as ensign in the gentlemen of the King's guard,
and because his dead father had been beloved by the Duke of
Norfolk it was said that his full ensigncy was near. He begged
his grandfather's leave to come near the fire, and stood with his
legs apart.</p>
<p>'The new Queen's come to Rochester,' he said; 'I am here with
the guard to take the heralds to Greenwich Palace.'</p>
<p>The printer looked at him unfavourably from the corner of his
dark and gloomy eyes.</p>
<p>'You come to suck up more money,' he said moodily. 'There is
none in this house.'</p>
<p>'As Mary is my protectress!' the boy laughed, 'there is!' He
stuck his hands into his breeches pocket and pulled out a big
fistful of crowns that he had won over-night at dice, and a long
and thin Flemish chain of gold. 'I have enow to last me till the
thaw,' he said. 'I came to beg my grandfather's blessing on the
first day of the year.'</p>
<p>'Dicing...Wenching...' the printer muttered.</p>
<p>'If I ask thee for no blessing,' the young man said, 'it's
because, uncle, thou'rt a Lutheran that can convey none. Where's
Margot? This chain's for her.'</p>
<p>'The fair Margot's locked in her chamber,' Udal snickered.</p>
<p>'Why-som-ever then? Hath she stolen a tart?'</p>
<p>'Nay, but I would have her in wedlock.'</p>
<p>'Thou&mdash;you&mdash;your magistership?' the boy laughed
incredulously. The printer caught in his tone his courtier's
contempt for the artificer's home, and his courtier's reverence
for the magister's learning.</p>
<p>'Keep thy sister from beneath this fox's tooth,' he said. 'The
likes of him mate not with the like of us.'</p>
<p>'The like of thee, uncle?' the boy retorted, with a
good-humoured insolence. 'My father was a gentleman.'</p>
<p>'Who married my sister for her small money, and died leaving
thee and thy sister to starve.'</p>
<p>'Nay, I starve not,' the boy said. 'And Margot's a plump
faggot.'</p>
<p>'A very Cynthia among willow-trees,' the magister said.</p>
<p>'Why, your magistership shall have her,' the boy said. 'I am
her lawful guardian.'</p>
<p>His grandfather laughed as men laugh to see a colt kick up its
heels in a meadow.</p>
<p>But the printer waved his bare arm furiously at the
magister.</p>
<p>'Get thee gone out of this decent house.' His eyes rolled, and
his clenched fist was as large as a ham. 'Here you come not
a-wenching.'</p>
<p>'Moody man,' the magister said, 'your brains are addled with
suspicions.'</p>
<p>The young man swelled his scarlet breast still more
consequentially. 'This is no house of thine, uncle, but my
grandfar's.'</p>
<p>'Young ass's colt!' the printer fulminated. 'Would'st have thy
sister undone by this Latin mouth-mincer?'</p>
<p>Udal grinned at him, and licked his lips. The printer
snarled:</p>
<p>'Know'st thou not, young ass, that this man was thrown out of
his mastership at Eton for his foul living?'</p>
<p>Udal was suddenly on his feet with the long pasty-knife held
back among the furs of his gown.</p>
<p>'Ignoble...' he began, but he lost his words in his trembling
rage. The printer snatched at his long measuring stick.</p>
<p>'Down knife,' he grunted, for his fury, too, made his throat
catch.</p>
<p>'Have a care, nunkey,' the young man laughed at the pair of
them. 'They teach knife-thrusts in his Italian books.'</p>
<p>'I will have thy printer's licence revoked, ignoble man,' the
magister said, grinning hideously. 'Thou, a Lutheran, to turn
upon me who was undone by Papist lies! They said I lived foully;
they said I stole the silver cellars...'</p>
<p>He turned upon the old man, stretching out the hand that held
the knife in a passionate gesture:</p>
<p>'Your Papists said that,' he appealed. 'But not a one of them
believed it, though you dub me Lutheran...See you, do I not
govern now the chief Papist of you all? Would that be if they
believed me filthy in my living. Have I not governed in the house
of the Howards, the lord of it being absent? Would that have been
if they had believed it of me?...And then...' He turned again
upon the printer. 'For the sake of your men...for the sake of the
New Learning, which God prosper, I was cast down.'</p>
<p>The printer grunted surlily:</p>
<p>''Tis known no wench is safe from thy amorousness. How many
husbands have broken thy pate?'</p>
<p>The magister threw the knife on to the table and rose,
frostily rustling in his gown.</p>
<p>'I shall bring thee down, ignoble man,' he said.</p>
<p>'If thou hast the power to do that,' the old man asked
suddenly, 'wherefore canst not get me redress in the matter of my
wall?'</p>
<p>The magister answered angrily:</p>
<p>'Privy Seal hath swallowed thy land: he shall not disgorge.
But this man he shall swallow. Know you not that you may make a
jack swallow, but no man shall make him give back; I, nor thou,
nor the devil's self?'</p>
<p>'Oh, a God's name bring not Flail Crummock into this
household,' the young man cut in. 'Would you undo us all?'</p>
<p>'Ignoble, ignoble, to twit a man with that Eton villainy,' the
magister answered.</p>
<p>'A God's name bring not Privy Seal into the quarrel,' the
young man repeated. 'None of us of the Old Faith believe that
lie.'</p>
<p>'Keep thy tongue off Cromwell's name, young fool,' his
grandfather said. 'We know not what walls have ears.'</p>
<p>The young man went pale: the printer himself went pale,
remembering suddenly that the magister was a spy of Cromwell's;
all three of them had their eyes upon Udal; only the old man,
with his carelessness of his great age, grinned with curiosity as
if the matter were a play that did not concern him. The magister
was making for the door with the books beneath his arm and a
torturing smile round his lips. The boy, with a deep oath, ran
out after him, a scarlet flash in the darkening room.</p>
<p>Old Badge pulled at his nose and grinned maliciously at the
fire beside him.</p>
<p>'That is thy deliverer: that is thy flail of the monks,' he
croaked at his son. The printer gazed moodily at the fire.</p>
<p>'Nay, it is but one of his servants,' he answered
mechanically.</p>
<p>'And such servants go up and down this realm of England and
ride us with iron bridles.' The old man laughed dryly and
bitterly. 'His servant? See how we are held&mdash;we dare not
shut our doors upon him since he is Cromwell's servant, yet if he
come in he shall ruin us, take our money that we dare not refuse,
deflower our virgins...What then is left to us between this
setter up of walls and his servants?'</p>
<p>The printer, fingering the T-square in his belt, said, slowly,
'I think this man loves too well that books should be printed in
the Latin tongue to ruin any printer of them upon a private
quarrel. Else I would get me across the seas.'</p>
<p>'He loves any wench much better,' the old man answered
maliciously. 'Hearken!'</p>
<p>Through the wall there came a scuffling sound, thumps, and the
noise of things falling. The wall there touched on the one that
Cromwell had set up, so that there was bare room for a man to
creep between.</p>
<p>'Body of God,' the printer said, 'is he eavesdropping
now?'</p>
<p>'Nay, this is courtship,' the old man answered. His head
leaned forward with a birdlike intentness; he listened with one
hand held out as if to still any sound in the room. They heard
footsteps from the floor above, a laugh and voices. 'Now Margot
talks to him from her window.'</p>
<p>The printer had a motion of convulsed rage:</p>
<p>'I will break that knave's spine across my knee.'</p>
<p>'Nay, let be,' the old man said. 'I command thee, who am thy
father, to let the matter be.'</p>
<p>'Would you have him...' the printer began with a snarl.</p>
<p>'I would not have my house burnt down because this Cromwell's
spy's body should be found upon our hands...To-morrow the wench
shall be sent to her aunt Wardle in Bedfordshire&mdash;aye, and
she shall be soundly beaten to teach her to love virtue.'</p>
<p>The young man opened the house door and came in, shivering in
his scarlet because he had run out without his cloak.</p>
<p>'A pretty medley you have made,' he said to his uncle, 'but I
have calmed him. Wherefore should not this magister marry
Margot?' He made again for the fire. 'Are we to smell always of
ink?' He looked disdainfully at his uncle's proofs, and began to
speak with a boy's seriousness and ingenuous confidence. They
would tell his uncle at Court that if good print be the body of a
book, good learning is even the soul of it. At Court he would
learn that it is thought this magister shall rise high. There
good learning is much prized. Their Lord the King had been seen
to talk and laugh with this magister. 'For our gracious lord
loveth good letters. He is in such matters skilled beyond all
others in the realm.'</p>
<p>The old man listened to his grandson, smiling maliciously and
with pride; the printer shrugged his shoulders bitterly; the
muffled sounds and the voices through the house-end continued,
and the boy talked on, laying down the law valiantly and with a
cheerful voice...He would gain advancement at Court through his
sister's marriage with the magister.</p>
<p>Going back to the palace at Greenwich along with the magister,
in the barge that was taking the heralds to the King's marriage
with Anne of Cleves, the young Poins was importunate with Udal to
advance him in his knowledge of the Italian tongue. He thought
that in the books of the Sieur Macchiavelli upon armies and the
bearing of arms there were unfolded many secret passes with the
rapier and the stiletto. But Udal laughed good-humouredly. He
had, he said, little skill in the Italian tongue, for it was but
a bastard of classical begettings. And for instruction in the
books of the Sieur Macchiavelli, let young Poins go to a man who
had studied them word by word&mdash;to the Lord Privy Seal,
Thomas Cromwell.</p>
<p>They both dropped their voices at the name, and, another
gentleman of the guard beginning to talk of rich men who had
fallen low by the block, the stake, and gaming, Udal mentioned
that that day he had seen a strange sight.</p>
<p>'There was in the Northern parts, where I governed in his
absence the Lord Edmund Howard's children, a certain Thomas
Culpepper. Main rich he was, with many pastures and many
thousands of sheep. A cousin of my lady's he was, for ever
roaring about the house. A swaggerer he was, that down there went
more richly dressed than earls here.'</p>
<p>That day Udal had seen this Culpepper alone, without any
servants, dressed in uncostly green, and dragging at the bridle
of a mule, on which sat a doxy dressed in ancient and ragged
furs. So did men fall in these difficult days.</p>
<p>'How came he in London town?' the Norroy King-at-Arms
asked.</p>
<p>'Nay, I stayed not to ask him,' Udal answered. He sighed a
little. 'Yet then, in my Lord Edmund's house I had my best pupil
of all, and fain was I to have news of her...But he was a
braggart; I liked him not, and would not stay to speak with
him.'</p>
<p>'I'll warrant you had dealings with some wench he favoured,
and you feared a drubbing, magister,' Norroy accused him.</p>
<p>The long cabin of the state barge was ablaze with the scarlet
and black of the guards, and with the gold and scarlet of the
heralds. Magister Udal sighed.</p>
<p>'You had good, easy days in Lord Edmund's house?' Norroy
asked.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>The Lord Privy Seal was beneath a tall cresset in the stern of
his barge, looking across the night and the winter river. They
were rowing from Rochester to the palace at Greenwich, where the
Court was awaiting Anne of Cleves. The flare of the King's barge
a quarter of a mile ahead moved in a glowing patch of lights and
their reflections, as though it were some portent creeping in a
blaze across the sky. There was nothing else visible in the world
but the darkness and a dusky tinge of red where a wave caught the
flare of light further out.</p>
<p>He stood invisible behind the lights of his cabin; and the
thud of oars, the voluble noises of the water, and the crackling
of the cresset overhead had, too, the quality of impersonal and
supernatural phenomena. His voice said harshly:</p>
<p>'It is very cold; bring me my greatest cloak.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton, the one of Cromwell's seven hundred spies who at
that time was his most constant companion, was hidden in the deep
shadow beside the cabin-door. His bearded and heavy form obscured
the light for a moment as he hurried to fetch the cloak. But
merely to be the Lord Cromwell's gown-bearer was in those days a
thing you would run after; and an old man in a flat cap&mdash;the
Chancellor of the Augmentations, who had been listening intently
at the door&mdash;was already hurrying out with a heavy cloak of
fur. Cromwell let it be hung about his shoulders.</p>
<p>The Chancellor shivered and said, 'We should be within a
quarter-hour of Greenwich.'</p>
<p>'Get you in if you be cold,' Cromwell answered. But the
Chancellor was quivering with the desire to talk to his master.
He had seen the heavy King rush stumbling down the stairs of the
Cleves woman's lodging at Rochester, and the sight had been for
him terrible and prodigious. It was Cromwell who had made him
Chancellor of the Augmentations&mdash;who had even invented the
office to deal with the land taken from the Abbeys&mdash;and he
was so much the creature of this Lord Privy Seal that it seemed
as if the earth was shivering all the while for the fall of this
minister, and that he himself was within an inch of the ruin,
execration, and death that would come for them all once Cromwell
were down.</p>
<p>Throckmorton, a giant man with an immense golden beard, issued
again from the cabin, and the Privy Seal's voice came leisurely
and cold:</p>
<p>'What said Lord Cassilis of this? And the fellow Knighton? I
saw them at the stairs.'</p>
<p>Privy Seal had such eyes that it was delicate work lying to
him. But Throckmorton brought out heavily:</p>
<p>'Cassilis, that this Lady Anne should never be Queen.'</p>
<p>'Aye, but she must,' the Chancellor bleated. He had been
bribed by two of the Cleves lords to get them lands in Kent when
the Queen should be in power. Cromwell's silence made
Throckmorton continue against his will:</p>
<p>'Knighton, that the Queen's breath should turn the King's
stomach against you! Dr. Miley, the Lutheran preacher, that by
this evening's work the Kingdom of God on earth was set
trembling, the King having the nature of a lecher...'</p>
<p>He tried to hold back. After all, it came into his mind, this
man was nearly down. Any one of the men upon whom he now spied
might come to be his master very soon. But Cromwell's voice said,
'And then?' and he made up his mind to implicate none but the
Scotch lord, who was at once harmless and unliable to be
harmed.</p>
<p>'Lord Cassilis,' he brought out, 'said again that your
lordship's head should fall ere January goes out.'</p>
<p>He seemed to feel the great man's sneer through the darkness,
and was coldly angry with himself for having invented no better
lie. For if this invisible and threatening phantom that hid
itself among these shadows outlasted January he might yet outlast
some of them. He wondered which of Cromwell's innumerable
ill-wishers it might best serve him to serve. But for the
Chancellor of the Augmentations the heavy silence of calamity,
like the waiting at a bedside for death to come, seemed to fall
upon them. He imagined that the Privy Seal hid himself in that
shadow in order to conceal a pale face and shaking knees. But
Cromwell's voice came harsh and peremptory to Throckmorton:</p>
<p>'What men be abroad at this night season? Ask my
helmsmen.'</p>
<p>Two torchlights, far away to the right, wavered shaking trails
in the water that, thus revealed, shewed agitated and chopped by
small waves. The Chancellor's white beard shook with the cold,
with fear of Cromwell, and with curiosity to know how the man
looked and felt. He ventured at last in a faint and bleating
voice:</p>
<p>What did his lordship think of this matter? Surely the King
should espouse this lady and the Lutheran cause.</p>
<p>Cromwell answered with inscrutable arrogance:</p>
<p>'Why, your cause is valuable. But this is a great matter. Get
you in if you be cold.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton appeared noiselessly at his elbow, whilst the
Chancellor was mumbling: 'God forbid I should be called
Lutheran.'</p>
<p>The torches, Throckmorton said, were those of fishers who
caught eels off the mud with worms upon needles.</p>
<p>'Such night work favours treason,' Cromwell muttered. 'Write
in my notebook, "The Council to prohibit the fishing of eels by
night."'</p>
<p>'What a nose he hath for treasons,' the Chancellor whispered
to Throckmorton as they rustled together into the cabin.
Throckmorton's face was gloomy and pensive. The Privy Seal had
chosen none of his informations for noting down. Assuredly the
time was near for him to find another master.</p>
<p>The barge swung round a reach, and the lights of the palace of
Greenwich were like a flight of dim or bright squares in mid air,
far ahead. The King's barge was already illuminating the
crenellated arch at the top of the river steps. A burst of
torches flared out to meet it and disappeared. The Court was then
at Greenwich, nearly all the lords, the bishops and the several
councils lying in the Palace to await the coming of Anne of
Cleves on the morrow. She had reached Rochester that evening
after some days' delay at Calais, for the winter seas. The King
had gone that night to inspect her, having been given to believe
that she was soberly fair and of bountiful charms. His courteous
visit had been in secret and in disguise; therefore there were no
torchmen in the gardens, and darkness lay between the river steps
and the great central gateway. But a bonfire, erected by the
guards to warm themselves in the courtyard, as it leapt up or
subsided before the wind, shewed that tall tower pale and high or
vanishing into the night with its carved stone garlands, its
stone men at arms, its lions, roses, leopards, and naked boys.
The living houses ran away from the foot of the tower, till the
wings, coming towards the river, vanished continually into
shadows. They were low by comparison, gabled with false fronts
over each set of rooms and, in the glass of their small-paned
windows, the reflection of the fire gleamed capriciously from
unexpected shadows. This palace was called Placentia by the King
because it was pleasant to live in.</p>
<p>Cromwell mounted the steps with a slow gait and an arrogant
figure. Under the river arch eight of his gentlemen waited upon
him, and in the garden the torches of his men shewed black yew
trees cut like peacocks, clipped hedges like walls with archways
above the broad and tiled paths, and fountains that gleamed and
trickled as if secretly in the heavy and bitter night.</p>
<p>A corridor ran from under the great tower right round the
palace. It was full of hurrying people and of grooms who stood in
knots beside doorways. They flattened themselves against the
walls before the Lord Privy Seal's procession of gentlemen in
black with white staves, and the ceilings seemed to send down
moulded and gilded stalactites to touch his head. The beefeater
before the door of the Lady Mary's lodgings spat upon the ground
when he had passed. His hard glance travelled along the wall like
a palpable ray, about the height of a man's head. It passed over
faces and slipped back to the gilded wainscoting; tiring-women
upon whom it fell shivered, and the serving men felt their bowels
turn within them. His round face was hard and alert, and his lips
moved ceaselessly one upon another. All those serving people
wondered to see his head so high, for already it was known that
the King had turned sick at the sight of his bedfellow that
should be. And indeed the palace was only awake at that late hour
because of that astounding news, dignitaries lingering in each
other's quarters to talk of it, whilst in the passages their
waiting men supplied gross commentaries.</p>
<p>He entered his door. In the ante-room two men in his livery
removed his outer furs deftly so as not to hinder his walk.
Before the fire of his large room a fair boy knelt to pull off
his jewelled gloves, and Hanson, one of his secretaries,
unclasped from his girdle the corded bag that held the Privy
Seal. He laid it on a high stand between two tall candles of wax
upon the long table.</p>
<p>The boy went with the gloves and Hanson disappeared silently
behind the dark tapestry in the further corner. Cromwell was
meditating above a fragment of flaming wood that the fire had
spat out far into the tiled fore-hearth. He pressed it with his
foot gently towards the blaze of wood in the chimney.</p>
<p>His plump hands were behind his back, his long upper lip
ceaselessly caressed its fellow, moving as one line of a snake's
coil glides above another. The January wind crept round the
shadowy room behind the tapestry, and as it quivered stags seemed
to leap over bushes, hounds to spring in pursuit, and a crowned
Diana to move her arms, taking an arrow from a quiver behind her
shoulder. The tall candles guarded the bag of the Privy Seal,
they fluttered and made the gilded heads on the rafters have
sudden grins on their faces that represented kings with flowered
crowns, queens with their hair combed back on to pillows, and
pages with scolloped hats. Cromwell stepped to an aumbry, where
there were a glass of wine, a manchet of bread, and a little
salt. He began to eat, dipping pieces of bread into the golden
salt-cellar. The face of a queen looked down just above his head
with her eyes wide open as if she were amazed, thrusting her head
from a cloud.</p>
<p>'Why, I have outlived three queens,' he said to himself, and
his round face resignedly despised his world and his times. He
had forgotten what anxiety felt like because the world was so
peopled with blunderers and timid fools full of hatred.</p>
<p>The marriage with Cleves was the deathblow to the power of the
Empire. With the Protestant Princes armed behind his back, the
imbecile called Charles would never dare to set his troops on
board ship in Flanders to aid the continual rebellions,
conspiracies and risings in England. He had done it too often,
and he had repented as often, at the last moment. It was true
that the marriage had thrown Charles into the arms of France: the
French King and he were at that very minute supping together in
Paris. They would be making treaties that were meant to be
broken, and their statesmen were hatching plots that any scullion
would reveal. Francis and his men were too mean, too silly, too
despicable, and too easily bribed to hold to any union or to
carry out any policy...</p>
<p>He sipped his wine slowly. It was a little cold, so he set it
down beside the fire. He wanted to go to bed, but the Archbishop
was coming to hear how Henry had received his Queen, and to pour
out his fears. Fears! Because the King had been sick at sight of
the Cleves woman! He had this King very absolutely in his power;
the grey, failing but vindictive and obstinate mass known as
Henry was afraid of his contempt, afraid really of a shrug of the
shoulder or a small sniff.</p>
<p>With the generosity of his wine and the warmth of his fire,
his thoughts went many years ahead. He imagined the King either
married to or having repudiated the Lady from Cleves, and then
dead. Edward, the Seymour child, was his creature, and would be
king or dead. Cleves children would be his creations too. Or if
he married the Lady Mary he would still be next the throne.</p>
<p>His mind rested luxuriously and tranquilly on that prospect.
He would be perpetually beside the throne, there would be no
distraction to maintain a foothold. He would be there by right;
he would be able to give all his mind to the directing of this
world that he despised for its baseness, its jealousies, its
insane brawls, its aimless selfishness, and its blind furies.
Then there should be no more war, as there should be no more
revolts. There should be no more jealousies; for kingcraft,
solid, austere, practical and inspired, should keep down all the
peoples, all the priests, and all the nobles of the world. 'Ah,'
he thought, 'there would be in France no power to shelter
traitors like Brancetor.' His eyes became softer in the
contemplation of this Utopia, and he moved his upper lip more
slowly.</p>
<p>Now the Archbishop was there. Pale, worn with fears and
agitation, he came to say that the King had called to him Bishop
Gardiner and the more Catholic lords of the Council. Cranmer's
own spy Lascelles had made this new report.</p>
<p>His white sleeves made a shivering sound, the fur that fell
round his neck was displaced on one shoulder. His large mouth was
open with panic, his lips trembled, and his good-natured and
narrow eyes seemed about to drop tears.</p>
<p>'Your Grace knoweth well what passed to-night at Rochester,'
Cromwell said. He clapped his hands for a man to snuff the
candles. 'You have the common report.'</p>
<p>'Ah, is it even true?' The Archbishop felt a last hope die,
and he choked in his throat. Cromwell watched the man at the
candles and said:</p>
<p>'Your Grace hath a new riding mule. I pray it may cease to
affright you.'</p>
<p>'Why?' he said, as the man went. 'The King's Highness went
even to Rochester, disguised, since it was his good pleasure, as
a French lord. You have seen the lady. So his Highness was seized
with a make of palsy. He cursed to his barge. I know no more than
that.'</p>
<p>'And now they sit in the council.'</p>
<p>'It seems,' Cromwell said.</p>
<p>'Ah, dear God have mercy.'</p>
<p>The Archbishop's thin hands wavered before the crucifix on his
breast, and made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>The very faces of his enemies seemed visible to him. He saw
Gardiner, of Winchester, with his snake's eyes under the flat
cap, and the Duke of Norfolk with his eyes malignant in a long,
yellow face. He had a vision of the King, a huge red lump beneath
the high dais at the head of the Council table, his face suffused
with blood, his cheeks quivering.</p>
<p>He wrung his hands and wondered if at Smithfield the Lutherans
would pray for him, or curse him for having been lukewarm.</p>
<p>'Why, goodman gossip,' Cromwell said compassionately, 'we have
been nearer death ten times.' He uttered his inmost thoughts out
of pity:&mdash;All this he had awaited. The King's Highness by
the report of his painters, his ambassadors, his spies&mdash;they
were all in the pay of Cromwell&mdash;had awaited a lady of
modest demeanour, a coy habit, and a great and placid fairness.
'I had warned the Almains at Rochester to attire her against our
coming. But she slobbered with ecstasy and slipped sideways,
aiming at a courtesy. Therefore the King was hot with new anger
and disgust.'</p>
<p>'You and I are undone.' Cranmer was passive with despair.</p>
<p>'He is very seldom an hour of one mind,' Cromwell answered.
'Unless in that hour those you wot of shall work upon him, it
will go well with us.'</p>
<p>'They shall. They shall.'</p>
<p>'I wait to see.'</p>
<p>There seemed to Cranmer something horrible in this
impassivity. He wished his leader to go to the King, and he had a
frantic moment of imagining himself running to a great distance,
hiding his head in darkness.</p>
<p>Cromwell's lips went up in scorn. 'Do you imagine the yellow
duke speaking his mind to the King? He is too craven.'</p>
<p>A heavy silence fell between them. The fire rustled, the
candles again needed snuffing.</p>
<p>'Best get to bed,' Cromwell said at last.</p>
<p>'Could I sleep?' Cranmer had the irritation of extreme fear.
His master seemed to him to have no bowels. But the waiting told
at last upon Cromwell himself.</p>
<p>'I could sleep an you would let me,' he said sharply. 'I tell
you the King shall be another man in the morning.'</p>
<p>'Ay, but now. But now...' He imagined the pens in that distant
room creaking over the paper with their committals, and he wished
to upbraid Cromwell. It was his policy of combining with
Lutherans that had brought them to this.</p>
<p>Heavy thundering came on the outer door.</p>
<p>'The King comes,' Cromwell cried victoriously. He went swiftly
from the room. The Archbishop closed his eyes and suddenly
remembered the time when he had been a child.</p>
<p>Privy Seal had an angry and contemptuous frown at his return.
'They have kept him from me.' He threw a little scroll on to the
table. Its white silence made Cranmer shudder; it seemed to have
something of the heavy threatening of the King's self.</p>
<p>'We may go to bed,' Cromwell said. 'They have devised their
shift.'</p>
<p>'You say?'</p>
<p>'They have temporised, they have delayed. I know them.' He
quoted contemptuously from the letter: 'We would have you send
presently to ask of the Almain Lords with the Lady Anne the
papers concerning her pre-contract to the Duke of Lorraine.'</p>
<p>Cranmer was upon the point of going away in the joy of this
respite. But his desire to talk delayed him, and he began to talk
about the canon law and pre-contracts of marriage. It was a very
valid cause of nullity all the doctors held.</p>
<p>'Think you I have not made very certain the pre-contract was
nullified? This is no shift,' and Cromwell spoke wearily and
angrily. 'Goodman Archbishop, dry your tears. To-night the King
is hot with disgust, but I tell you he will not cast away his
kingdom upon whether her teeth be white or yellow. This is no
woman's man.'</p>
<p>Cranmer came nearer the fire and stretched out his lean
hands.</p>
<p>'He hath dandled of late with the Lady Cassilis.'</p>
<p>'Well, he hath been pleasant with her.'</p>
<p>Cranmer urged: 'A full-blown man towards his failing years is
more prone to women than before.'</p>
<p>'Then he may go a-wenching.' He began to speak with a weary
passion. To cast away the Lady Anne now were a madness. It would
be to stand without a friend before all nations armed to their
downfall. This King would do no jot to lose a patch upon his
sovereignty.</p>
<p>Cranmer sought to speak.</p>
<p>'His Highness is always hot o'nights,' Cromwell kept on. 'It
is in his nature so to be. But by morning the German princes
shall make him afraid again and the Lutherans of this goodly
realm. Those mad swine our friends!'</p>
<p>'He will burn seven of them on to-morrow sennight,' Cranmer
said.</p>
<p>'Nay! I shall enlarge them on Wednesday.'</p>
<p>Cranmer shivered. 'They grow very insolent. I am afraid.'</p>
<p>Cromwell answered with a studied nonchalance:</p>
<p>'My bones tell me it shall be an eastward wind. It shall not
rain on the new Queen's bridals.' He drank up his warm wine and
brushed the crumbs from the furs round his neck.</p>
<p>'You are a very certain man,' the Archbishop said.</p>
<p>Going along the now dark corridors he was afraid that some
ruffling boy might spring upon him from the shadows. Norfolk, as
the Earl Marshal, had placed his lodgings in a very distant part
of the palace to give him long journeys that, telling upon his
asthma, made him arrive breathless and convulsed at the King's
rooms when he was sent for.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>The shadow of the King kept hands from throats in the palace,
but grooms were breaking each others' heads in the stables till
towards morning. They fought about whether it were lawful to eat
fish on a Friday, and just after daybreak a gentleman's oarsman
from Sittingbourne had all his teeth to swallow for asserting
that the sacrament should be administered in the two kinds. The
horses were watered by ostlers who hummed the opprobrious song
about Privy Seal, called 'Crummock.'</p>
<p>In the hillocks and lawns of the park round the palace
Lutherans waited all night to welcome their Queen. They lit small
fires on the turf and, standing round them, sang triumphal hymns.
A Princess was coming from Cleves, a Lutheran; the day-spring
from on high was visiting them; soon, soon now, the axe and the
flail should be given into their hands.</p>
<p>In the dawn their boats could be seen pulling like
water-beetles all across the pallid river from the Essex shores.
They clustered in grey masses round the common steps.</p>
<p>A German horse merchant from the City pulled a putrid cat out
of the river mud and held it over his head. He shrieked: 'Hic
hocus pocus,' parodying the '<i>Hoc corpus meum</i>' of the Mass.
The soldiers of the Duke of Norfolk were unable to reach him for
the crowd. There were but ten of them, under a captain, set to
guard the little postern in the side wall of the garden. Towards
ten o'clock the Mayor of London came by land. He had with him all
his brotherhood with their horses and armed guards in a long
train. The mayor and his aldermen had entrance into the palace,
but the Duke had given orders that men and horses must bide in
the park. There were forty battles of them, each of one hundred
men.</p>
<p>The great body came in sight, white, shining even in the grey
among the trees along the long garden wall.</p>
<p>'Body of God,' the captain said, 'there shall be broken
crowns.' He bade his men hold their pikes across, and paced
unconcernedly up and down before the door.</p>
<p>The City men came down in a solid body, and at sight of the
red crosses on their white shoulders the Lutherans set up a cry
of 'Rome, Rome.' Their stones began to fly at once, and, because
they pressed so closely in, the City bowmen had no room to string
their bows. The citizens struck out with their silvered staves,
but the heavy armour under their white surcoats hindered them.
The Lutherans cried out that the Kingdom of God was come on earth
because a Queen from Cleves was at hand.</p>
<p>An alderman's charger was struck by a stone. It broke loose
and crashed all foaming and furious through a tripe stall on
which a preacher was perched to hold forth. The riot began then.
All in among the winter trees the City men in their white and
silver were fighting with the Lutherans in their grey frieze. The
citizens' hearts were enraged because their famous Dominican
preacher had been seized by the Archbishop and spirited into
Kent. They cried to each other to avenge Dr. Latter on these
lowsels.</p>
<p>Men struck out at all and sundry. A woman, covered to the face
in a fur hood and riding a grey mule, was hit on the arm by the
quarterstaff of a Protestant butcher from the Crays, because she
wore a crucifix round her neck. She covered her face and shrieked
lamentably. A man in green at the mule's head, on the other side,
sprang like a wild cat under the beast's neck. His face blazed
white, his teeth shone like a dog's, he screamed and struck his
dagger through the butcher's throat.</p>
<p>His motions were those of a mad beast; he stabbed the mule in
the shoulder to force it to plunge in the direction of the
soldiers who kept the little gate, before in the throng the
butcher had reached the ground. The woman was flogging at the
mule with her reins. 'I have killed 'un,' he shrieked.</p>
<p>He dived under the pikes of the soldiers and gripped the
captain by both shoulders. 'We be the cousins of the Duke of
Norfolk,' he cried. His square red beard trembled beneath his
pallid face, and suddenly he became speechless with rage.</p>
<p>Hands were already pulling the woman from her saddle, but the
guards held their pikes transversely against the faces of the
nearest, crushing in noses and sending sudden streaks of blood
from jaws. The uproar was like a hurricane and the woman's body,
on high, swayed into the little space that the soldiers held. She
was crying with the pain of her arm that she held with her other
hand. Her cousin ran to her and mumbled words of inarticulate
tenderness, ending again in 'I have killed 'un.'</p>
<p>The mob raged round them, but the soldiers stood firm enough.
A continual cry of 'Harlot, harlot,' went up. Stones were scarce
on the sward of the park, but a case bottle aimed at the woman
alighted on the ear of one of the guards. It burst in a foam of
red, and he fell beneath the belly of the mule with a dry grunt
and the clang of iron. The soldiers put down the points of their
pikes and cleared more ground. Men lay wallowing there when they
retreated.</p>
<p>The man shouted at the captain: 'Can you clear us a way to yon
stairs?' and, at a shake of the head, 'Then let us enter this
gate.'</p>
<p>The captain shook his head again.</p>
<p>'I am Thomas Culpepper. This is the Duke's niece, Kat,' the
other shouted.</p>
<p>The captain observed him stoically from over his thick and
black beard.</p>
<p>'The King's Highness is within this garden,' he said. He spoke
to the porter through the little niche at the wicket. A company
of the City soldiers, their wands beating like flails, cleared
for a moment the space in front of the guards.</p>
<p>Culpepper with the hilt of his sword was hammering at the
studded door. The captain caught him by the shoulder and sent him
to stagger against the mule's side. He was gasping and snatched
at his hilt. His bonnet had fallen off, his yellow hair was like
a shock of wheat, and his red beard flecked with foam that
spattered from his mouth.</p>
<p>'I have killed one. I will kill thee,' he stuttered at the
captain. The woman caught him round the neck.</p>
<p>'Oh, be still,' she shrieked. 'Still. Calm. Y' kill me.' She
clutched him so closely that he was half throttled. The captain
paced stoically up and down before the gate.</p>
<p>'Madam,' he said, 'I have sent one hastening to his duke-ship.
Doubtless you shall enter.' He bent to pull the soldier from
beneath the mule's belly by one foot, and picking up his pike,
leaned it against the wall.</p>
<p>With his face pressed against his cousin's furred side, Thomas
Culpepper swore he would cut the man's throat.</p>
<p>'Aye, come back again,' he answered. 'They call me Sir
Christopher Aske.'</p>
<p>The red jerkins of the King's own guards came in a heavy mass
round the end of the wall amid shrieks and curses. Their
pike-staves rose rhythmically and fell with dull thuds; with
their clumsy gloved hands they caught at throats, and they threw
dazed men and women into the space that they had cleared before
the wall. There armourers were ready, with handcuffs and
leg-chains hanging like necklaces round their shoulders.</p>
<p>The door in the wall opened silently, the porter called
through his niche: 'These have leave to enter.' Thomas Culpepper
shouted 'Coneycatcher' at the captain before he pulled the mule's
head round. The beast hung back on his hand, and he struck it on
its closed eyes in a tumult of violent rage. It stumbled heavily
on the threshold, and then darted forward so swiftly that he did
not hear the direction of the porter that they should turn only
at the third alley.</p>
<p>Tall and frosted trees reached up into the dim skies, the
deserted avenues were shrouded in mist, and there was a dead and
dripping silence.</p>
<p>'Seven brawls y' have brought me into,' the woman's voice came
from under her hood, 'this weary journey.'</p>
<p>He ran to her stirrup and clutched her glove to his forehead.
'Y'ave calmed me,' he said. 'Your voice shall ever calm me.'</p>
<p>She uttered a hopeless 'Oh, aye,' and then, 'Where be we?'</p>
<p>They had entered a desolate region of clipped yews, frozen
fountains, and high, trimmed hedges. He dragged the mule after
him. Suddenly there opened up a very broad path, tiled for a
width of many feet. On the left it ran to a high tower's gaping
arch. On the right it sloped nobly into a grey stretch of
water.</p>
<p>'The river is even there,' he muttered. 'We shall find the
stairs.'</p>
<p>'I would find my uncle in this palace,' she said. But he
muttered, 'Nay, nay,' and began to beat the mule with his fist.
It swerved, and she became sick and dizzy with the sudden jar on
her hurt arm. She swayed in her saddle and, in a sudden flaw of
wind, her old and torn furs ruffled jaggedly all over her
body.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>The King was pacing the long terrace on the river front. He
had been there since very early, for he could not sleep at
nights, and had no appetite for his breakfast. When a gentleman
from the postern gate asked permission for Culpepper and the mule
to pass to the private stairs, he said heavily:</p>
<p>'Let me not be elbowed by cripples,' and then: 'A' God's name
let them come,' changing his mind, as was his custom after a bad
night, before his first words had left his thick, heavy lips. His
great brow was furrowed, his enormous bulk of scarlet, with the
great double dog-rose embroidered across the broad chest, limped
a little over his right knee and the foot dragged. His eyes were
bloodshot and heavy, his head hung forward as though he were
about to charge the world with his forehead. From time to time
his eyebrows lifted painfully, and he swallowed with an effort as
if he were choking.</p>
<p>Behind him the three hundred windows of the palace Placentia
seemed to peer at him like eyes, curious, hostile, lugubrious or
amazed. He tore violently at his collar and muttered: 'I stifle.'
His great hand was swollen by its glove, sewn with pearls, to an
immense size.</p>
<p>The gentleman told him of the riot in the park, and narrated
the blasphemy of the German Lutheran, who had held up a putrid
dog in parody of the Holy Mass.</p>
<p>The face of the King grew suffused with purple blood.</p>
<p>'Let those men be cut down,' he said, and he conceived a
sorting out of all heresy, a cleansing of his land with blood. He
looked swiftly at the low sky as if a thunderbolt or a leprosy
must descend upon his head. He commanded swiftly, 'Let them be
taken in scores. Bid the gentlemen of my guard go, and armourers
with shackles.'</p>
<p>The sharp pain of the ulcer in his leg gnawed up to his thigh,
and he stood, dejected, like a hunted man, with his head hanging
on his chest, so that his great bonnet pointed at the ground. He
commanded that both Privy Seal and the Duke of Norfolk should
come to him there upon the instant.</p>
<p>This grey and heavy King, who had been a great scholar,
dreaded to read in Latin now, for it brought the language of the
Mass into his mind; he had been a composer of music and a skilful
player on the lute, but no music and no voices could any more
tickle his ears.</p>
<p>Women he had loved well in his day. Now, when he desired rest,
music, good converse and the love of women, he was forced to wed
with a creature whose face resembled that of a pig stuck with
cloves. He had raged over-night, but, with the morning, he had
seen himself growing old, on a tottering throne, assailed by all
the forces of the Old Faith in Christendom. Rebellions burst out
like fires every day in all the corners of his land. He had no
men whom he could trust: if he granted a boon to one party it
held them only for a day, and the other side rose up. Now he
rested upon the Lutherans, whom he hated, and, standing on that
terrace, he had watched gloomily the great State barges of the
Ambassadors from the Empire and from France come with majestic
ostentation downstream abreast, to moor side by side against the
steps of his water-gate.</p>
<p>It was a parade of their new friendship. Six months ago their
trains could not have mingled without bloodshed.</p>
<p>At last there stood before him Thomas Cromwell, un-bonneted,
smiling, humorous, supple and confident for himself and for his
master's cause, a man whom his Prince might trust. And the long
melancholy and sinister figure of the Duke of Norfolk stalked
stiffly down among the yew trees powdered with frost. The furs
from round his neck fluttered about his knees like the wings of a
crow, and he dug his Earl Marshal's golden staff viciously into
the ground. He waved his jewelled cap and stood still at a little
distance. Cromwell regarded him with a sinister and watchful
amusement; he looked back at Privy Seal with a black malignancy
that hardened his yellow features, his hooked nose and pursed
lips into the likeness of a mask representing hatred.</p>
<p>This Norfolk was that Earl of Surrey who had won Flodden
Field. They all then esteemed him the greatest captain of his
day&mdash;in the field a commander sleepless, cunning, cautious,
and, in striking, a Hotspur.</p>
<p>A dour and silent man, he was the head of all the Catholics,
of all the reaction of that day. But, in the long duel between
himself and Cromwell he had seemed fated to be driven from post
to post, never daring to proclaim himself openly the foe of the
man he dreaded and hated. Cranmer, with his tolerant spirit, he
despised. Here was an archbishop who might rack and burn for
discipline's sake, and he did nothing...And all these New
Learning men with their powers of language, these dark bearded
men with twinkling and sagacious eyes, he detested. He went clean
shaved, lean and yellow-faced, with a hooked nose that seemed
about to dig into his chin. It was he who said first: 'It was
merry in England before this New Learning came in.'</p>
<p>The night before, the King had sworn that he would have Privy
Seal's head because Anne of Cleves resembled a pig stuck with
cloves. And, shaking and shivering with cold that penetrated his
very inwards, with a black pain on his brow and sparks dancing
before his jaundiced eyes, the Duke cursed himself for not having
urged then the immediate arrest of the Privy Seal. For here stood
Cromwell, arrogantly by the King's side with the King graciously
commanding him to cover his head because it was very cold and
Cromwell was known to suffer with the earache.</p>
<p>'You are Earl Marshal,' the King's voice drowned Norfolk's
morning greeting. He veered upon the Duke with such violence that
his enormous red bulk seemed about to totter over upon the tall
and bent figure. A searing pain had shot up his side, and, as he
gripped it, he appeared to be furiously plucking at his dagger.
He had imagined Chapuys and Marillac, the Ambassadors, coming
upon guards with broken heads and sending to Paris letters over
which Francis and his nephew should snigger and chuckle.</p>
<p>'You are Earl Marshal. You have the ordering of these
ceremonies, and you let rebels and knaves break heads within my
very park for all the world to see!'</p>
<p>In his rage Norfolk blurted out:</p>
<p>'Privy Seal hath his friends, too&mdash;these Lutherans. What
man could have foreseen how insolent they be grown, for joy at
welcoming a Queen of their faith,' he repeated hotly. 'No man
could have foreseen. My bands are curtailed.'</p>
<p>Cromwell said:</p>
<p>'Aye, men are needed to keep down the Papists of your North
parts.'</p>
<p>The two men faced each other. It had been part of the Duke's
plan&mdash;and Cromwell knew it very well&mdash;that the City men
should meet with the Lutherans there in the King's own park. It
would show the insolence of the heretics upon whom the Privy Seal
relied, and it might prove, too, the strength of the Old Faith in
the stronghold of the City.</p>
<p>Henry rated violently. It put him to shame, he repeated many
times. 'Brawling beneath my face, cries in my ears, and the smell
of bloodshed in my nose.'</p>
<p>Norfolk repeated dully that the Protestants were wondrous
insolent. But Cromwell pointed out with a genial amusement: 'My
Lord Duke should have housed the City men within the palace. Cat
will fight with dog the world over if you set them together.'</p>
<p>The Duke answered malignantly:</p>
<p>'It was fitting the citizens should wait to enter. I would not
cumber his Highness' courtyards. We know not yet that this Lady
cometh to be welcomed Queen.'</p>
<p>'Body of God,' the King said with a new violence: 'do ye prate
of these matters?' His heavy jaws threatened like a dog's. 'Hast
thou set lousy knaves debating of these?'</p>
<p>Norfolk answered darkly that it had been treated of in the
Council last night.</p>
<p>'My Council! My Council!' The King seemed to bay out the
words. 'There shall some mothers' sons rue this!'</p>
<p>Norfolk muttered that he had spoken of it with no man not a
Councillor. The King's Highness' self had moved first in
this.</p>
<p>Henry suddenly waved both hands at the sky.</p>
<p>'Take you good order,' he said heavily into the lean and
yellow face of the Duke. 'Marshal these ceremonies fitly from
henceforth. Let nothing lack. Get you gone.' An end must be made
of talk and gossip. The rumour of last night's Council must
appear an idle tale, a falsehood of despairing Papists. 'The
Queen cometh,' he said.</p>
<p>With the droop of the Duke's long arms his hat seemed to brush
the stones, his head fell on his chest. It was finished.</p>
<p>He had seen so many things go that he loved. And now this old
woman with her Germans, her heresies&mdash;her children
doubtless&mdash;meant the final downfall of the Old Order in his
day. It would return, but he would never see it. And under
Cromwell's sardonic gaze his head hung limply, and his eyes
filled with hot and blinding drops. His face trembled like that
of a very old man.</p>
<p>The King had thrust his hand through Cromwell's arm, and, with
a heavy familiarity as if he would make him forget the Council of
last night, he was drawing him away towards the water-gate. He
turned his head over his shoulder and repeated balefully:</p>
<p>'The Queen cometh.'</p>
<p>As he did so his eye fell upon a man tugging at the bridle of
a mule that had a woman on its back. He passed on with his
minister.</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>In turning, Norfolk came against them at the very end of the
path. The man's green coat was spotted with filth, one of his
sleeves was torn off and dangled about his heel. The mule's knees
were cut, and the woman trembled with her hidden face and
shrinking figure.</p>
<p>They made him choke with rage and fear. Some other procession
might have come against these vagabonds, and the blame would have
been his. It disgusted him that they were within a yard of
himself.</p>
<p>'Are there no side paths?' he asked harshly.</p>
<p>Culpepper blazed round upon him:</p>
<p>'How might I know? Why sent you no guide?' His vivid red beard
was matted into tails, his face pallid and as if blazing with
rage. The porter had turned them loose into the empty garden.</p>
<p>'Kat is sore hurt,' he mumbled, half in tears. 'Her arm is
welly broken.' He glared at the Duke. 'Care you no more for your
own blood and kin?'</p>
<p>Norfolk asked:</p>
<p>'Who is your Kat? Can I know all the Howards?'</p>
<p>Culpepper snarled:</p>
<p>'Aye, we may trust you not to succour your brother's
children.'</p>
<p>The Duke said:</p>
<p>'Why, she shall back to the palace. They shall comfort
her.'</p>
<p>'That shall she not,' Culpepper flustered. 'Sh'ath her
father's commands to hasten to Dover.'</p>
<p>The Duke caught her eyes in the fur hood that hid her face
like a Moorish woman's veil. They were large, grey and arresting
beneath the pallor of her forehead. They looked at him,
questioning and judging.</p>
<p>'Wilt not come to my lodging?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Aye, will I,' came a little muffled by the fur.</p>
<p>'That shall she not,' Culpepper repeated.</p>
<p>The Duke looked at him with gloomy and inquisitive
surprise.</p>
<p>'Aye, I am her mother's cousin,' he said. 'I fend for her,
which you have never done. Her father's house is burnt by
rioters, and her men are joined in the pillaging. But I'll
warrant you knew it not.'</p>
<p>Katharine Howard with her sound hand was trying to unfasten
her hood, hastily and eagerly.</p>
<p>'Wilt come?' the Duke asked hurriedly. 'This must be
determined.'</p>
<p>Culpepper hissed: 'By the bones of St. Nairn she shall not.'
She lifted her maimed hand involuntarily, and, at the sear of
pain, her eyes closed. Immediately Culpepper was beside her
knees, supporting her with his arms and muttering sounds of
endearment and despair.</p>
<p>The Duke, hearing behind him the swish pad of heavy soft
shoes, as if a bear were coming over the pavement, faced the
King.</p>
<p>'This is my brother's child,' he said. 'She is sore hurt. I
would not leave her like a dog,' and he asked the King's
pardon.</p>
<p>'Why, God forbid,' the King said. 'Your Grace shall succour
her.' Culpepper had his back to them, caring nothing for either
in his passion. Henry said: 'Aye, take good care for her,' and
passed on with Privy Seal on his arm.</p>
<p>The Duke heaved a sigh of relief. But he remembered again that
Anne of Cleves was coming, and his black anger that Cromwell
should thus once again have the King thrown back to him came out
in his haughty and forbidding tone to Culpepper:</p>
<p>'Take thou my niece to the water-gate. I shall send women to
her.' He hastened frostily up the path to be gone before Henry
should return again.</p>
<p>Culpepper resolved that he would take barge before ever the
Duke could send. But the mule slewed right across the terrace;
his cousin grasped the brute's neck and her loosened hood began
to fall back from her head.</p>
<p>The King, standing twenty yards away, with his hand shaking
Cromwell's shoulder, was saying:</p>
<p>'See you how grey I grow.'</p>
<p>The words came hot into a long harangue. He had been urging
that he must have more money for his works at Calais. He was
agitated because a French chalk pit outside the English lines had
been closed to his workmen. They must bring chalk from Dover at a
heavy cost for barges and balingers. This was what it was to
quarrel with France.</p>
<p>Cromwell had his mind upon widening the breach with France. He
said that a poll tax might be levied on the subjects of Charles
and Francis then in London. There were goldsmiths, woolstaplers,
horse merchants, whore-masters, painters, musicians and
vintners...</p>
<p>The King's eyes had wandered to the grey river, and then from
a deep and moody abstraction he had blurted out those words.</p>
<p>Henry was very grey, and his face, inanimate and depressed,
made him seem worn and old enough. Cromwell was not set to deny
it. The King had his glass...</p>
<p>He sighed a little and began:</p>
<p>'The heavy years take their toll.'</p>
<p>Henry caught him up suddenly:</p>
<p>'Why, no. It is the heavy days, the endless nights. You can
sleep, you.' But him, the King, incessant work was killing.</p>
<p>'You see, you see, how this world will never let me rest.' In
the long, black nights he started from dozing. When he took time
to dandle his little son a panic would come over him because he
remembered that he lived among traitors and had no God he could
pray to. He had no mind to work...</p>
<p>Cromwell said that there was no man in England could outwork
his King.</p>
<p>'There is no man in England can love him.' His distracted eyes
fell upon the woman on the mule. 'Happy he whom a King never saw
and who never saw King,' he muttered.</p>
<p>The beast, inspired with a blind hatred of Culpepper, was
jibbing across the terrace, close at hand. Henry became
abstractedly interested in the struggle. The woman swayed forward
over her knees.</p>
<p>'Your lady faints,' he called to Culpepper.</p>
<p>In his muddled fury the man began once again trying to hold
her on the animal. It was backing slowly towards a stone seat in
the balustrade, and man and woman swayed and tottered
together.</p>
<p>The King said:</p>
<p>'Let her descend and rest upon the seat.'</p>
<p>His mind was swinging back already to his own heavy sorrows.
On the stone seat the woman's head lay back upon the balustrade,
her eyes were closed and her face livid to the sky. Culpepper,
using his teeth to the finger ends, tore the gloves from his
hands.</p>
<p>Henry drew Cromwell towards the gatehouse. He had it dimly in
his mind to send one of his gentlemen to the assistance of that
man and woman.</p>
<p>'Aye, teach me to sleep at night,' he said. 'It is you who
make me work.'</p>
<p>'It is for your Highness' dear sake.'</p>
<p>'Aye, for my sake,' the King said angrily. He burst into a
sudden invective: 'Thou hast murdered a many men...for my sake.
Thou hast found out plots that were no plots: old men hate me,
old mothers, wives, maidens, harlots...Why, if I be damned at the
end thou shalt escape, for what thou didst thou didst for my
sake? Shall it be that?' He breathed heavily. 'My sins are thy
glory.'</p>
<p>They reached the long wall of the gatehouse and turned
mechanically. A barge at the river steps was disgorging musicians
with lutes like half melons set on staves, horns that opened bell
mouths to the sky, and cymbals that clanged in the rushing of the
river. With his eyes upon them Henry said: 'A common man may
commonly choose his bedfellow.' They had reminded him of the
Queen for whose welcome they had been commanded.</p>
<p>Cromwell swept his hand composedly round the half horizon that
held the palace, the grey river and the inlands.</p>
<p>'Your Highness may choose among ten thousand,' he
answered.</p>
<p>The sound of a horn blown faintly to test it within the
gatehouse, the tinkle of a lutestring, brought to the King's
lips: 'Aye. Bring me music that shall charm my thoughts. You
cannot do it.'</p>
<p>'A Queen is in the nature of a defence, a pledge, a cement,
the keystone of a bulwark,' Cromwell said. 'We know now our
friends and our foes. You may rest from this onwards.'</p>
<p>He spoke earnestly: This was the end of a long struggle. The
King should have his rest.</p>
<p>They moved back along the terrace. The woman's head still lay
back, her chin showed pointed and her neck, long, thin and
supple. Culpepper was bending over her, sprinkling water out of
his cap upon her upturned face.</p>
<p>The King said to Cromwell: 'Who is that wench?' and, in the
same tone: 'Aye, you are a great comforter. We shall see how the
cat jumps,' and then, answering his own question, 'Norfolk's
niece?'</p>
<p>His body automatically grew upright, the limp disappeared from
his gait and he moved sturdily and gently towards them.</p>
<p>Culpepper faced round like a wild cat from a piece of meat,
but seeing the great hulk, the intent and friendly eyes, the gold
collar over the chest, the heavy hands, and the great feet that
appeared to hold down the very stones of the terrace, he stood
rigid in a pose of disturbance.</p>
<p>'Why do ye travel?' the King asked. 'This shall be Katharine
Howard?'</p>
<p>Culpepper's hushed but harsh voice answered that they came out
of Lincolnshire on the Norfolk border. This was the Lord Edmund's
daughter.</p>
<p>'I have never seen her,' the King said.</p>
<p>'Sh'ath never been in this town.'</p>
<p>The King laughed: 'Why, poor wench!'</p>
<p>'Sh'ath been well schooled,' Culpepper answered proudly, 'hath
had mastern, hath sung, hath danced, hath your Latin and your
Greek... Hath ten daughters, her father.'</p>
<p>The King laughed again: 'Why, poor man!'</p>
<p>'Poorer than ever now,' Culpepper muttered. Katharine Howard
stirred uneasily and his face shot round to her. 'Rioters have
brent his only house and wasted all his sheep.'</p>
<p>The King frowned heavily: 'Anan? Who rioted?'</p>
<p>'These knaves that love not our giving our ploughlands to
sheep,' Culpepper said. 'They say they starved through it. Yet
'tis the only way to wealth. I had all my wealth by it. By now
'tis well gone, but I go to the wars to get me more.'</p>
<p>'Rioters?' the King said again, heavily.</p>
<p>''Twas a small tulzie&mdash;a score of starved yeomen here and
there. I killed seven. The others were they that were hanged at
Norwich...But the barns were brent, the sheep gone, and the house
down and the servants fled. I am her cousin of the mother's side.
Of as good a strain as Howards be.'</p>
<p>Henry, with his eyes still upon them, beckoned behind his back
for Cromwell to come. A score or so of poor yeomen, hinds and
women, cast out of their tenancies that wool might be grown for
the Netherlands weavers, starving, desperate, and seeing no trace
of might and order in their hidden lands, had banded, broken a
few hedges and burnt a few barns before the posse of the country
could come together and take them.</p>
<p>The King had not heard of it or had forgotten it, because such
risings were so frequent. His brows came down into portentous and
bulging knots, his eyes were veiled and threatening towards the
woman's face. He had conceived that a great rebellion had been
hidden from his knowledge.</p>
<p>She raised her head and shrieked at the sight of him, half
started to her feet, and once more sank down on the bench,
clasping at her cousin's hand. He said:</p>
<p>'Peace, Kate, it is the King.'</p>
<p>She answered: 'No, no,' and covered her face with her
hands.</p>
<p>Henry bent a little towards her, indulgent, amused, and gentle
as if to a child.</p>
<p>'I am Harry,' he said.</p>
<p>She muttered:</p>
<p>'There was a great crowd, a great cry. One smote me on the
arm. And then this quiet here.'</p>
<p>She uncovered her face and sat looking at the ground. Her furs
were all grey, she had had none new for four years, and they were
tight to her young body that had grown into them. The roses
embroidered on her glove had come unstitched, and, against the
steely grey of the river, her face in its whiteness had the tint
of mother of pearl and an expression of engrossed and grievous
absence.</p>
<p>'I have fared on foul ways this journey,' she said.</p>
<p>'Thy father's barns we will build again,' the King answered.
'You shall have twice the sheep to your dower. Show me your
eyes.'</p>
<p>'I had not thought to have seen the King so stern,' she
answered.</p>
<p>Culpepper caught at the mule's bridle.</p>
<p>'Y' are mad,' he muttered. 'Let us begone.'</p>
<p>'Nay, in my day,' the King answered, 'y'ad found me more than
kind.'</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to his face, steadfast, enquiring and
unconcerned. He bent his great bulk downwards and kissed her upon
the temple.</p>
<p>'Be welcome to this place.' He smiled with a pleasure in his
own affability and because, since his beard had pricked her, she
rubbed her cheek. Culpepper said:</p>
<p>'Come away. We stay the King's Highness.'</p>
<p>Henry said: 'Bide ye here.' He wished to hear what Cromwell
might say of these Howards, and he took him down the terrace.</p>
<p>Culpepper bent over her with his mouth opened to whisper.</p>
<p>'I am weary,' she said. 'Set me a saddle cushion behind my
shoulders.'</p>
<p>He whispered hurriedly:</p>
<p>'I do not like this place.'</p>
<p>'I like it well. Shall we not see brave shews?'</p>
<p>'The mule did stumble on the threshold.'</p>
<p>'I marked it not. The King did bid us bide here.'</p>
<p>She had once more laid her head back on the stone
balustrade.</p>
<p>'If thou lovest me...' he whispered. It enraged and confused
him to have to speak low. He could not think of any words.</p>
<p>She answered unconcernedly:</p>
<p>'If thou lovest my bones...they ache and they ache.'</p>
<p>'I have sold farms to buy thee gowns,' he said
desperately.</p>
<p>'I never asked it,' she answered coldly.</p>
<p>Henry was saying:</p>
<p>'Ah, Princes take as is brought them by others. Poor men be
commonly at their own choice.' His voice had a sort of patient
regret. 'Why brought ye not such a wench?'</p>
<p>Cromwell answered that in Lincoln, they said, she had been a
coin that would not bear ringing.</p>
<p>'You do not love her house,' the King said. 'Y' had better
have brought me such a one.'</p>
<p>Cromwell answered that his meaning was she had been won by
others. The King's Highness should have her for a wink.</p>
<p>Henry raised his shoulders with a haughty and angry shrug.
Such a quarry was below his stooping. He craved no light
loves.</p>
<p>'I do not miscall the wench,' Cromwell answered. She was as
her kind. The King's Highness should find them all of a make in
England.</p>
<p>'Y' are foul-mouthed,' Henry said negligently. ''Tis a
well-spoken wench. You shall find her a place in the Lady Mary's
house.'</p>
<p>Cromwell smiled, and made a note upon a piece of paper that he
pulled from his pocket.</p>
<p>Culpepper, his arms jerking angularly, was creaking out:</p>
<p>'Come away, a' God's name. By all our pacts. By all our secret
vows.'</p>
<p>'Ay thou didst vow and didst vow,' she said with a bitter
weariness. 'What hast to shew? I have slept in filthy beds all
this journey. Speak the King well. He shall make thee at a
word.'</p>
<p>He spat out at her.</p>
<p>'Is thine eye cocked up to that level?...I am very hot, very
choleric. Thou hast seen me. Thou shalt not live. I will slay
thee. I shall do such things as make the moon turn bloody
red.'</p>
<p>'Aye art thou there?' she answered coldly. 'Ye have me no
longer upon lone heaths and moors. Mend thy tongue. Here I have
good friends.'</p>
<p>Suddenly he began to entreat:</p>
<p>'Thy mule did stumble&mdash;an evil omen. Come away, come
away. I know well thou lovest me.'</p>
<p>'I know well I love thee too well,' she answered, as if in
scorn of herself.</p>
<p>'Come away to thy father.'</p>
<p>'Why what a bother is this,' she said. 'Thou wouldst to the
wars to get thee gold? Thou wouldst trail a pike? Thou canst do
little without the ear of some captain. Here is the great captain
of them all.'</p>
<p>'I dare not speak here,' he muttered huskily. 'But this
King...' He paused and added swiftly: 'He is of an ill omen to
all Katharines.'</p>
<p>'Why, he shall give me his old gloves to darn,' she laughed.
'Fond knave, this King standeth on a mountain a league high. A
King shall take notice of one for the duration of a raindrop's
fall. Then it is done. One may make oneself ere it reach the
ground, or never. Besides, 'tis a well-spoken elder. 'Tis the
spit of our grandfather Culpepper.'</p>
<p>When Henry came hurrying back, engrossed, to send Culpepper
and the mule to the gatehouse for a guide, she laughed gently for
pleasure.</p>
<p>Culpepper said tremulously: 'She hath her father's commands to
hasten to Dover.'</p>
<p>'Her father taketh and giveth commands from me,' Henry
answered, and his glove flicked once more towards the gate. He
had turned his face away before Culpepper's hand grasped
convulsively at his dagger and he had Katharine Howard at his
side sweeping back towards Cromwell.</p>
<p>She asked, confidingly and curiously: 'Who is that lord?' and,
after his answer, she mused, 'He is no friend to Howards.'</p>
<p>'Nay, that man taketh his friends among mine,' he answered. He
stopped to regard her, his face one heavy and indulgent smile.
The garter on his knee, broad and golden, showed her the words:
'<i>Y pense</i>'; the collars moved up and down on his immense
chest, the needlework of roses was so fine that she wondered how
many women had sat up how many nights to finish it: but the man
was grey and homely.</p>
<p>'I know none of your ways here,' she said.</p>
<p>'Never let fear blanch thy cheeks till we are no more thy
friend,' he reassured her. He composed one of his gallant
speeches:</p>
<p>'Here lives for thee nothing but joy.' Pleasurable hopes
should be her comrades while the jolly sun shone, and sweet
content at night her bedfellow...</p>
<p>He handed her to the care of the Lord Cromwell to take her to
the Lady Mary's lodgings. It was unfitting that she should walk
with him, and, with his heavy and bearlike gait, swinging his
immense shoulders, he preceded them up the broad path.</p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>Cromwell watched the King's great back with an attentive
smile. He said, ironically, that he was her ladyship's
servant.</p>
<p>'I would ye were,' she answered. 'They say you love not those
that I love.'</p>
<p>'I would have you not heed what men say,' he answered, grimly.
'I am douce to those that be of good-will to his Highness. Those
that hate me are his ill-wishers.'</p>
<p>'Then the times are evil,' she said, 'for they are many.'</p>
<p>She added suddenly, as if she could not keep a prudent
silence:</p>
<p>'I am for the Old Faith in the Old Way. You have hanged many
dear friends of mine whose souls I pray for.'</p>
<p>He looked at her attentively.</p>
<p>She had a supple, long body, a fair-tinted face, fair and
reddish hair, and eyes that had a glint of almond green&mdash;but
her cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkled. She was so intent
upon speaking her mind that she had forgotten the pain of her
arm. She thought that she must have said enough to anger this
brewer's son. But he answered only:</p>
<p>'I think you have never been in the King's court'&mdash;and,
from his tranquil manner, she realised very suddenly that this
man was not the dirt beneath her feet.</p>
<p>She had never been in the King's court; she had never, indeed,
been out of the North parts. Her father had always been a very
poor man, with an ancient castle and a small estate that he had
nearly always neglected because it had not paid for the farming.
Living men she had never respected&mdash;for they seemed to her
like wild beasts when she compared them with such of the ancients
as Brutus or as Seneca. She had been made love to and threatened
by such men as her cousin; she had been made love to and taught
Latin by her pedagogues. She was more learned than any man she
had ever met&mdash;and, thinking upon the heroes of Plutarch, she
found the present times despicable. She hardly owed allegiance to
the King. Now she had seen him and felt his consciousness of his
own power, she was less certain. But the King's writs had hardly
run in the Northern parts. Her men-folk and her mother's people
had hanged their own peasants when they thought fit. She had seen
bodies swinging from tree-tops when she rode hawking. All that
she had ever known of the King's power was when the convent by
their castle gates had been thrown out of doors, and then her
men-folk, cursing and raging, had sworn that it was the work of
Crummock. 'Knaves ruled about the King.'</p>
<p>If knaves ruled about him, the King was not a man that one
need trouble much over. Her own men-folk, she knew, had made and
unmade Kings. So that, when she thought of the hosts of saints
and of the blessed angels that hovered, wringing their hands and
weeping above England, she had wondered a little at times why
they had never unmade this King.</p>
<p>But to her all these things had seemed very far away. She had
nothing to do but to read books in the learned tongues, to
imagine herself holding disquisitions upon the spiritual republic
of Plato, to ride, to shoot with the bow, to do needlework, or to
chide the maids. Her cousin had loved her passionately; it was
true that once, when she had had nothing to her back, he had sold
a farm to buy her a gown. But he had menaced her with his knife
till she was weary, and the ways of men were troublesome to her;
nevertheless she submitted to them with a patient wisdom.</p>
<p>She submitted to the King; she submitted&mdash;though she
hated him by repute&mdash;to Cromwell's catechism as they
followed the King at a decent interval.</p>
<p>He walked beside her with his eyes on her face. He spoke of
the King's bounty in a voice that implied his own power. She was
to be the Lady Mary's woman. He had that lady especially in his
good will, he saved for her household ladies of egregious gifts,
presence and attainments. They received liberal honorariums,
seven dresses by the year, vails, presents, perfumes from the
King's own still-rooms, and a parcel-gilt chain at the New Year.
The Lady Rochford, who ruled over these ladies, was kind,
courteous, free in her graces as in the liberties she allowed the
ladies under her easy charge.</p>
<p>He enlarged upon this picture as if it were a bribe that he
alone could offer or withhold. And something at once cautious and
priestly in his tone let her quick intuition know that he was
both warning her and sounding her, to see how far her mutinous
spirit would carry her. Once he said, 'There must be tranquillity
in the kingdom. The times are very evil!'</p>
<p>She had felt very quickly that insults to this man would be a
useless folly. He could not even feel them, and she kept her eyes
on the ground and listened to him.</p>
<p>He went on sounding her. It was part of his profession of
kingcraft to know the secret hearts of every person with whom he
spoke.</p>
<p>'And your goodly cousin?' He paused. The King had commanded
that a place should be found for him. 'Should he be best at
Calais? There shall be blows struck there.'</p>
<p>She knew very well that he was trying to discover how much she
loved her cousin, and she answered in a low voice, 'I would have
him stay here. He is the sole friend I have in this place.'</p>
<p>Cromwell said, with a hidden and encouraging meaning, her
cousin was not her only friend there.</p>
<p>'Aye, but your lordship is not so old a friend as he.'</p>
<p>'Not me. Call me your good servant.'</p>
<p>'There is even then my uncle.'</p>
<p>'Little good of a friend you will have of Norfolk. 'Tis a
bitter apple and a very rotten plank to lean upon.'</p>
<p>She could not any longer miss his meaning. The King's scarlet
and immense figure was already in the grey shadow of the arch
under the tower. In walking, they had come near him, and while
they waited he stood for a minute, gazing back down the path with
boding and pathetic eyes; then he disappeared.</p>
<p>She looked at Cromwell and thanked him for the warning,
'<i>quia spicula praevisa minus laedunt</i>.'</p>
<p>'I would have you read it: <i>gaudia plus laetificant</i>,' he
answered gravely.</p>
<p>A man with a conch-shaped horn upturned was suddenly blowing
beneath the archway seven hollow and reverberating grunts of
sound that drowned his voice. A clear answering whistle came from
the water-gate. Cromwell stayed, listening attentively; another
stood forward to blow four blasts, another six, another three.
Each time the whistle answered. They were the great officers'
signals for their barges that the men blew, and the whistle
signified that these lay at readiness in the tideway. A bustle of
men running, calling, and making pennons ready, began beyond the
archway in the quadrangle.</p>
<p>Cromwell's face grew calm and contented; the King was sending
to meet Anne of Cleves.</p>
<p>'Y' are well read?' he asked her slowly.</p>
<p>'I was brought up in the Latin tongue or ever I had the
English,' she answered. 'I had a good master, one that spoke the
learned language always.'</p>
<p>'Aye, Nicholas Udal,' Cromwell said.</p>
<p>'You know all men in the land,' she said, with fear and
surprise.</p>
<p>'I had him to master for the Lady Mary, since he is well
disposed.'</p>
<p>''Tis an arrant knave tho' the best of pedagogues,' she
answered. 'He was cast out of his mastership at Eton for being a
rogue.'</p>
<p>'For that, the worshipful your father had him to master,' he
said ironically.</p>
<p>'No, for that he was a ruined man, and taught for his
victuals. We welly starved at home, my sisters and I.'</p>
<p>He said slowly:</p>
<p>'The better need that you should grow beloved here.'</p>
<p>Standing there, before the bushes where no ears could
overhear, he put to her more questions. She had some Greek, more
than a little French, she could judge a good song, she could turn
a verse in Latin or the vulgar tongue. She professed to be able
to ride well, to be conversant with the terms of venery, to shoot
with the bow, and to have studied the Fathers of the Church.</p>
<p>'These things are well liked in high places,' he said. 'His
Highness' self speaks five tongues, loveth a nimble answer, and
is a noble huntsman.' He surveyed her as if she were a horse he
were pricing. 'But I doubt not you have appraised yourself
passing well,' he uttered.</p>
<p>'I have had some to make me pleasant speeches,' she answered,
'but too many cannot be had.'</p>
<p>'See you,' he said slowly, 'these tuckets that they blow from
the gate signify that the new Queen cometh with a great state.'
He bit his under lip and looked at her meaningly. 'But a great
state ensueth a great heaviness to the head of the State.
<i>Principis hymen, principium gravitatis</i>...'Tis a small
matter to me; you may make it a great one to your ladyship's
light fortunes.'</p>
<p>She knew that he awaited her saying:</p>
<p>'I do not take your lordship,' and she pulled the hood further
over her face because it was cold, and uttered the words with her
eyes on the ground.</p>
<p>'Why,' he said readily, 'you are a lady having gifts that are
much in favour in these days. Be careful to use those gifts and
no others. Meddle in nothing that does not concern you. So you
may make a great marriage with some lord in favour. But meddle in
naught else!'</p>
<p>She would find many to set her an evil example. The other
ladies amongst whom she was going were a mutinous knot. Let her
be careful! If by her good behaviour she earned it, he would put
the King in mind to advance her. If by good speeches and good
example&mdash;since she had great store of learning&mdash;she
could turn the hearts of these wicked ladies; if she could report
to him evil designs or plots, he would speak to the King in such
wise that His Highness should give her a great dower and any lord
would marry her. Or he would advance her cousin so that he should
become marriageable.</p>
<p>She said submissively:</p>
<p>'Your lordship would have me become a spy upon the ladies who
shall be my fellows?'</p>
<p>He waved his hand with a large and calming gesture.</p>
<p>'I would have you work for the good of the State as you find
it,' he said gravely. 'That, too, is a doctrine of the Ancients.'
He cited the case of Seneca, who supported the government of
Nero, and she noted that he twisted to suit his purpose Tacitus'
account of the soldiers of that same Prince.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she made no comment. For she knew that it is the
nature of men calmly to ask hateful sacrifices of women. But her
throat ached with rage. And when she followed him along the
corridors of the palace she seemed to feel that each man, each
woman that they passed hated that lord with a hatred born of
fear.</p>
<p>He walked in front of her arrogantly, as if she were a straw
to be drawn along in the wind of his progress. Doors flew open at
a flick of his finger.</p>
<p>Suddenly they were in a tall room, long, and dim because it
faced the north. It seemed an empty cavern, but there were in it
many books upon a long table and at the far end, so that they
looked quite small, two figures stood before a reading-pulpit.
The voice of the serving man who had thrown open the door made
the words 'The Lord Privy Seal of England' echo mournfully along
the gilded and dim rafters of the ceiling.</p>
<p>Cromwell hastened over the smooth, cold floor. The woman's
figure in black, the long tail of her hood falling almost to her
feet like a widow's veil, turned from the pulpit; a man remained
bent down at his reading.</p>
<p>'<i>Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum</i>,' Cromwell's voice
uttered. The lady stood, rigid and straight, her hands clasped
before her. Her face, pale so that not even a touch of red showed
above the cheekbones and hardly any in the tightly-pursed lips,
was as if framed in her black hood that fastened beneath the
chin. The high, narrow forehead had the hair tightly drawn back
so that none was visible, and the coif that showed beneath the
hood was white, like a nun's; the temples were hollowed so that
she looked careworn inexpressibly, and her lips had hard lines
around them. Above her head all sounds in that dim room seemed to
whisper for a long time among the rafters as if here dwelt
something mysterious, sepulchral, a great grief or a great
passion.</p>
<p>'I announce to you a master-joy,' Cromwell was saying. 'I
bring your La'ship a damsel of great erudition and knowledge of
good letters.'</p>
<p>His voice was playful and full; his back was bent supply. His
face lit up with a debonnaire and pleasant smile. The lady's eyes
turned upon the girl, forbidding and suspicious; she remained
motionless, even her lips did not move. Cromwell said that this
was a Katharine of the Howards, and one fit to aid her Ladyship
and Magister Udal with their erudite commentary of Plautus his
works.</p>
<p>The man at the reading desk looked round and then back at his
book. His pen scratched upon the margin of a great volume.
Katharine Howard was upon her knees grasping at the lady's hand
to kiss it. But it was snatched roughly away.</p>
<p>'This is a folly,' the voice came harshly from the pursed
lips. 'Get up, wench.' Katharine remained kneeling. For this was
the Lady Mary of England&mdash;a martyr for whom she had prayed
nightly since she could pray.</p>
<p>'Get up, fool,' the voice said above her head. 'It is
proclaimed treason to kneel to me. This is to risk your neck to
act thus before Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>The hard words were aimed straight at the face of
Cromwell.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship knows well I would fain have it otherwise,' he
answered softly.</p>
<p>'I do not ask it,' she answered.</p>
<p>He maintained a gentle smile of deprecation, beckoning a
little with his head and with his eyes, begging her for private
conversation. She lifted Katharine roughly to her feet and
followed him to a distant window. She seemed as if she were an
automaton without will or independent motions of her own, so
small were her steps and her feet so hidden beneath her stiff
black skirts. He began talking to her in a voice of which only
the persuasive higher notes came into the room.</p>
<p>At that time she was still proclaimed bastard, and her name
was erased from the list of those it was lawful to pray for in
the churches. At times she endured great hardships, even to going
short of food, for she suffered from a wasting complaint that
made her a great eater. But starvation could not make her submit
to the King, her father, or to the Lord Cromwell who was ruler in
the land. Sometimes they gave her a great train, strove to make
her dress herself richly, and dragged her to such festivals as
this of the marriage with Anne of Cleves. This was done when the
Lord Privy Seal dangled her before the eyes of the Emperor of
France as a match; then it was necessary to increase the
appearance of her worth in England. But sometimes the King, out
of a warm and generous feeling of satisfaction with his young
son, was moved to behave bountifully to his daughter, and,
seeking to dazzle her with his munificence, gave her golden
crosses and learned books annotated with his own hand, richly
jewelled and with embroidered covers. Or when the Emperor, her
cousin, interceded that she should be treated more kindly, she
was threatened with the block. Of late Cromwell had set himself
to gain her heart with his intrigue that he could make so smooth
and with his air that could be so gentle&mdash;that the King
found so lovable. But nothing moved her to set her hand to a deed
countenancing her dead mother's disgrace; to smile upon her
father and his minister, who had devised the means for casting
down her mother; or to consent to relinquish her right to the
throne. So that at times, when the cloud of the Church abroad,
and of the rebellions all over the extremities of the kingdoms,
threatened very greatly, the King was driven to agonies of fear
and rage lest his enemies or his subjects should displace him who
was excommunicated and set her, whom all Catholics regarded as
undergoing a martyrdom, on his throne. He feared her sometimes so
much that it was only Cromwell that saved her from death.
Cromwell would spend hours of his busy days in the long window of
her work room, urging her to submission, dilating upon the powers
that might be hers, studying her tastes to devise bribes for her.
It was with that aim, because her whole days in her solitude were
given to the learned writers, that he had sought out for her
Magister Udal as a companion and preceptor who might both please
her with his erudition and induce her to look kindly upon the New
Learning and a more lax habit of mind. But she never thanked
Cromwell. Whilst he talked she remained frozen and silent. At
times, under the spur of a cold rage, she said harsh things of
himself and her father, calling upon the memory of her mother and
the wrongs her Church had suffered&mdash;and, on his departing,
before he had even left the room she would return, frigidly and
without change of face, to the book upon her desk.</p>
<p>So the Privy Seal talked to her by the window for the fiftieth
time. Katharine Howard saw, before the high reading pulpit, the
back of a man in the long robes of a Master of Arts. He held a
pen in his hand and turned over his shoulder at her a face thin,
brown, humorous and deprecatory, as if he were used to bearing
chiding with philosophy.</p>
<p>'Magister Udal!' she uttered.</p>
<p>He motioned with his mouth for her to be silent, but pointed
with the feather of his quill to a line of a little book that lay
upon the pulpit near his elbow. She came closer to read:</p>
<p>'<i>Circumspectatrix cum oculis emisitiis!</i>' and written
above it in a minute hand: 'A spie with eyes that peer about and
stick out.'</p>
<p>He pointed over his shoulder at the Lord Privy Seal.</p>
<p>'How poor this room is, for a King's daughter!' she said,
without much dropping her voice.</p>
<p>He hissed: 'Hush! hush!' with an appearance of terror, and
whispered, forming the words with his lips rather than uttering
them: 'How fared you and your house in the nonce?'</p>
<p>'I have read in many texts,' she answered, 'to pass the heavy
hours.'</p>
<p>He spoke then, aloud and with an admonitory air:</p>
<p>'Never say the heavy hours&mdash;for what hours are heavy that
can be spent with the ancient writers for companions?'</p>
<p>She avoided his reproachful eyes with:</p>
<p>'My father's house was burnt last month; my cousin Culpepper
is in the courts below. Dear Nick Ardham, with his lute, is dead
an outlaw beyond sea, and Sir Ferris was hanged at
Doncaster&mdash;both after last year's rising, pray all good men
that God assail them!'</p>
<p>Udal muttered:</p>
<p>'Hush, for God's dear sake. That is treason here. There is a
listener behind the hangings.'</p>
<p>He began to scrawl hastily with a dry pen that he had not time
to dip in the well of ink. The shadow of the Lord Cromwell's
silent return was cast upon them both, and Katharine
shivered.</p>
<p>He said harshly to the magister:</p>
<p>'I will that you write me an interlude in the vulgar tongue in
three days' time. Such a piece as being spoken by skilful players
may make a sad man laugh.'</p>
<p>Udal said: 'Well-a-day!'</p>
<p>'It shall get you advancement. I am minded the piece shall be
given at my house before his Highness and the new Queen in a
week.'</p>
<p>Udal remained silent, dejected, his head resting upon his
breast.</p>
<p>'For,' Cromwell spoke with a raised voice, 'it is well that
the King be distracted of his griefs.' He went on as if he were
uttering an admonition that he meant should be heeded and
repeated. The times were very evil with risings, mutinies in
close fortresses, schism, and the bad hearts of men. Here,
therefore, he would that the King should find distraction. Such
of them as had gifts should display those talents for his
beguiling; such of them as had beauty should make valuable that
beauty; others whose wealth could provide them with rich garments
and pleasant displays should work, each man and each woman, after
his sort or hers. 'And I will that you report my words where
either of you have resort. Who loves me shall hear it; who fears
me shall take warning.'</p>
<p>He surveyed both Katharine and the master with a heavy and
encouraging glance, having the air of offering great things if
they aided him and avoided dealing with his enemies.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary was gliding towards them like a cold shadow
casting itself upon his warm words; she would have ignored him
altogether, knowing that contempt is harder to bear than bitter
speeches. But the fascination of hatred made it hard to keep
aloof from her father's instrument. He looked negligently over
his shoulder and was gone before she could speak. He did not care
to hear more bitter words that could make the breach between them
only wider, since words once spoken are so hard to wash away, and
the bringing of this bitter woman back to obedience to her father
was so great a part of his religion of kingcraft. In that, when
it came, there should be nothing but concord and oblivion of
bitter speeches, silent loyalty, and a throne upheld, revered,
and unassailable.</p>
<p>Udal groaned lamentably when the door closed upon him:</p>
<p>'I shall write to make men laugh! In the vulgar tongue! I! To
gain advancement!'</p>
<p>The Lady Mary's face hardly relaxed:</p>
<p>'Others of us take harder usage from my lord,' she said. She
addressed Katharine: 'You are named after my mother. I wish you a
better fate than your namesake had.' Her harsh voice dismayed
Katharine, who had been prepared to worship her. She had eaten
nothing since dawn, she had travelled very far and with this
discouragement the pain in her arm came back. She could find no
words to say, and the Lady Mary continued bitterly: 'But if you
love that dear name and would sojourn near me I would have you
hide it. For&mdash;though I care little&mdash;I would yet have
women about me that believe my mother to have been foully
murdered.'</p>
<p>'I cannot easily dissemble.' Katharine found her tongue.
'Where I hate I speak things disparaging.'</p>
<p>'That I attest to of old,' Udal commented. 'But I shall be
shamed before all learned doctors, if I write in the vulgar
tongue.'</p>
<p>'Silence is ever best for me!' the Lady Mary answered her
deadly. 'I live in the shadows that I love.'</p>
<p>'That, full surely, shall be reversed,' Katharine said
loyally.</p>
<p>'I do not ask it,' Mary said.</p>
<p>'Wherefore must I write in the vulgar tongue?' Udal asked
again, 'Oh, Mistress of my actions and my heart, what whim is
this? The King is an excellent good Latinist!'</p>
<p>'Too good!' the Lady Mary said bitterly. 'With his learning he
hath overset the Church of Christ.'</p>
<p>She spoke harshly to Katharine: 'What reversal should give my
mother her life again? Wench! Wench!...' Then she turned upon
Udal indifferently:</p>
<p>'God knows why this man would have you write in the vulgar
tongue. But so he wills it.'</p>
<p>Udal groaned.</p>
<p>'My dinner hour is here,' the Lady Mary said. 'I am very
hungry. Get you to your writing and take this lady to my
women.'</p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>The Lady Mary's rooms were seventeen in number; they ran the
one into the other, but they could each be reached by the public
corridor alongside. It was Magister Udal's privilege, his
condition being above that of serving man, to make his way
through the rooms if he knew that the Lady Mary was not in one of
them. These chambers were tall and gloomy; the light fell into
them bluish and dismal; in one a pane was lacking in a window; in
another a stool was upset before a fire that had gone out.</p>
<p>To traverse this cold wilderness Udal had set on his cap. He
stood in front of Katharine Howard in the third room and
asked:</p>
<p>'You are ever of the same mind towards your magister?'</p>
<p>'I was never of any mind towards you,' she answered. Her eyes
went round the room to see how Princes were housed. The arras
pictured the story of the nymph Galatea; the windows bore
intertwined in red glass the cyphers H and K that stood for
Katharine of Aragon. 'Your broken fortunes are mended?' she asked
indifferently.</p>
<p>He pulled a small book out of his pocket, ferreted among the
leaves and then setting his eye near the page pointed out his
beloved line:</p>
<p>'<i>Pauper sum, pateor, fateor, quod Di dant fero.</i>' Which
had been translated: 'I am poor, I confess; I bear it, and what
the gods vouchsafe that I take'&mdash;and on the broad margin of
the book had written: 'Cicero sayeth: That one cannot
sufficiently praise them that be patient having little: And
Seneca: The first measure of riches is to have things
necessary&mdash;and, as ensueth therefrom, to be therewith
content!'</p>
<p>'I will give you a text from Juvenal,' she said, 'to add to
these: Who writes that no man is poor unless he be worthy of
ridicule.'</p>
<p>He winced a little.</p>
<p>'Nay, you are hard! The text should be read: Nothing else
maketh poverty so hard to bear as that it forceth men to
ridiculous shifts...<i>Quam quod ridiculos esse</i>...'</p>
<p>'Aye, magister, you are more learned even yet than I,' she
said indifferently. She made a step towards the next door but he
stood in front of her holding up his thin hands.</p>
<p>'You were my best pupil,' he said, with a hungry humility as
if he mocked himself. 'Poor I am, but mated to me you should live
as do the Hyperboreans, in a calm and voluptuous air.'</p>
<p>'Aye, to hang myself of weariness, as they do,' she
answered.</p>
<p>He corrected her with the version of Pliny, but she answered
only: 'I have a great thirst upon me.'</p>
<p>His eyes were humorous, despairing and excited.</p>
<p>'Why should a lady not love her master?' he asked. 'There are
examples. Know you not the old rhyme:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"></div>
</div>
<p>'Ah, unspeakable!' she said. 'You bring me examples in the
vulgar tongue!'</p>
<p>'I babble for joy at seeing you and for grief at your harsh
words,' he answered.</p>
<p>She stood waiting with a sort of haughty submissiveness.</p>
<p>'I would you would delay your wooing. I have been on the road
since dawn with neither bit nor sup.'</p>
<p>He protested that he had starved more hideously than Tantalus
since he had seen her last.</p>
<p>She gave him indifferently her cheek to kiss.</p>
<p>'For pity's sake take me where I may rest,' she said, 'I have
a maimed arm.'</p>
<hr>
<p>He uttered her panegyric, after a model of Tibullus, to the
Lady Rochford and the seven maids of honour under that lady's
charge. He was set upon Katharine's enjoyment, and he invented a
lie that the King had commanded a dress to be found for her to
attend at the revels that night. The maids were already dressing
themselves. Two of them were fairheaded, and four neither fair
nor dark; but one was dark as night, and dressed all in black
with a white coif, so that she resembled a magpie. Some were
curling each other's hair and others tightening stay-laces with
little wheels set in their companions' backs. Their bare
shoulders were blue with the cold of the great room, and their
dresses lay in heaps upon sheets that were spread about the clean
floor&mdash;brocades sewn with pearls, velvets that were inlaid
with filagree work, indoor furs and coifs of fine lawn that were
delicately edged with black thread.</p>
<p>The high sounds of their laughter had reached through the
door, but a dead silence fell. The dark girl with a very long
bust that raked back like a pigeon's, and with dark and sparkling
eyes, tittered derisively at the magister and went on slowly
rubbing a perfumed ointment into the skin of her throat and
shoulders.</p>
<p>'Shall he bring his ragged doxies here too?' she laughed.
'What a taradiddle is this of Cophetua and a beggar wench.' The
other maids all tittered derisively at Udal.</p>
<p>The Lady Rochford, warming her back close before the fire,
said helplessly, 'I have no dresses beyond what you see.' She was
already attired in a bountiful wine-coloured velvet that was
embroidered with silver wire into entwined monograms of the
initials of her name. Her hood of purple made, above her ample
brows, a castellated pattern resembling the gate of a drawbridge.
She, being the mistress of that household, and compassionately
loved by the ladies because she was so helpless, timorous, and
unable to control them, they had combined to comb and perfume her
and to lace her stomacher before setting about their own
clothing. White-haired and with a wrinkled face, she appeared,
under her rich clothes, like some will-less and pallid captive
that had been gorgeously bedizened to grace a conqueror's
triumph. She was cousin to the late Queen Anne Boleyn, and the
terror of her own escape, when the Queen and so many of her house
had been swept away, seemed still to remain in the drawing-in of
her eyes. In the mien of the youngest girls there, there could be
seen a strained tenseness of lids and lips as though, in the
midst of laughter, they were hearkening for distant sounds or the
rustle of listeners behind the tapestry. And where a small door
came into one wall they had pulled down the arras from in front
of it, so that no one should enter unobserved. Lady Rochford
addressed herself to Katharine with limp gestures of protest:</p>
<p>'God knows I would help you to a gown, but we have no more
than we are granted; here are seven ladies and seven dresses.
Where can another be got? The King's Highness knoweth little of
ladies' gowns or he had never ordered one against to-night. Each
of those hath taken the women seven weeks to sew.'</p>
<p>Udal said with a touch of anger, since it enraged him to have
to invent further, as if the one lie about the King were not
enough: 'The Lord Privy Seal commanded very strictly this thing
to be done. He is this lady's very diligent protector. Have a
care how you disoblige her.'</p>
<p>The ladies rustled their slight clothing at that name, turned
their backs, and looked at Katharine above their shoulders. The
Lady Rochford recoiled so far that her skirts were in danger from
the fire in the great hearth; her woebegone, flaccid face was
suddenly drawn at the mention of Cromwell, and she appeared about
to kneel at Katharine's feet. She looked round at the figures of
the girls.</p>
<p>'One of these can stay if your ladyship will wear her dress,'
she flustered. 'But who is tall enow? Cicely is too long in the
shank. Bess's shoulders are too broad. Alack! God help me! I will
do what I can'&mdash;and she waved her hands disconsolately.</p>
<p>Cold, fatigue, and her maimed arm made Katharine waver on her
feet. This white-haired woman's panic seemed to her grotesque and
disgusting.</p>
<p>'Why, the magister lies,' she said. 'I am no such friend of
Privy Seal's.'</p>
<p>Swift and wicked glances passed among the girls; the dark one
threw back her head and laughed discordantly, like a magpie. She
came with a deft and hopping step and gazed at Katharine with her
head on one side.</p>
<p>'Old Crummock will want our teeth next to make him a new set.
He may have my head, tell him. I have no need for it, it aches so
since he killed my men-folk.'</p>
<p>Lady Rochford shuddered as if she had been struck.</p>
<p>'Beseech you,' she said weakly to Katharine. 'Cicely Elliott
is sometimes distraught. Believe not that we speak like this
among ourselves.' Her eyes wandered in a flustered and piteous
way over her girls and she whimpered, 'Jane Gaskell, stand back
to back with this lady.'</p>
<p>Katharine Howard cried out, 'Keep your gowns for your backs
and your tongues still. Woe betide the girl who calls me a gossip
of Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott cast her dark head back and uttered one of her
discordant laughs at the ceiling, and a girl, hiding behind the
others, called out, 'What a fine &mdash;&mdash;!'</p>
<p>Katharine cried, 'It is all lies that this fool magister
utters. I will go to no masques nor revels.' She turned upon Lady
Rochford, her face pallid, her lips open: 'Give me water,' she
said harshly. 'I will get me back to my pig-sties.'</p>
<p>Lady Rochford wrung her hands and protested that her ladyship
should not repeat that they were always thus. Privy Seal should
not visit it upon them.</p>
<p>The magister blinked upon the riot that his muddling had
raised. He called out, 'Be quiet. Be quiet. This lady is sick!'
and stretched out his hands to hold Katharine on her feet.</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott cried, 'God send all Crummock's informers
always sick.'</p>
<p>'Thou dastard!' Katharine screamed aloud. She tried to speak
but she choked; she grasped Udal's hand as if to wring from him
the denial of his foolish lies, but a sharp and numbing pain shot
up her maimed wrist to her shoulders and leaped across her
forehead.</p>
<p>'Thou filthy spy,' the dark girl laughed wildly into her
agonised face. 'If there had never been any like thee all the
dear men of my house had still breathed.'</p>
<p>Katharine sprang wildly towards her tormentor, but a black
sheet seemed to drop across her eyes. She fell right down and
screamed as her elbow struck the floor.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF EYES</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>A grave and bearded man was found to cup her. He gave her a
potion composed of the juice of nightshade and an infusion of
churchyard moss. Her eyes grew dilated and she had evil dreams.
She lay in a small chamber that was quite bare and had a broken
window, and the magister ran from room to room begging for quilts
to cover her.</p>
<p>It was nobody's affair. The Lord Privy Seal, her uncle, the
Catholics, and the King were still perturbed about Anne of
Cleves, and there were no warrants signed for Katharine's housing
or food. All the palace was trembling with confusion, for, when
the Queen had been upon the point of setting out from Rochester,
the King was said to have been overcome by a new spasm of
disgust: she was put by again.</p>
<p>The young Earl of Surrey, a cousin of Katharine's, gave Udal
contemptuously a couple of crowns towards her nourishment. Udal
applied them to bribing Throckmorton, the spy who had been with
Privy Seal upon the barge, to inscribe on his lord's tablets the
words: 'Katharine Howard to be provided for.' Udal made up his
courage sufficiently to speak to the Duke, whom he met in a
corridor. The Duke was jaundiced against his niece, because her
cousin Culpepper had fallen upon Sir Christopher Aske, the Duke's
captain who had kept the postern. It had needed seven men to
master him, and this great tumult had arisen in the King's own
courtyard. Nevertheless, the Duke sent his astrologer to cast
Katharine's horoscope. He signed, too, an order that some girl be
found to attend on her.</p>
<p>Udal filled in the girl's name as Margot Poins, the
granddaughter of old Badge, of Austin Friars. Even among these
clamours his tooth watered for her, and he gave the order to
young Poins to execute. The young man rode off into Bedfordshire,
where his sister had been sent out of the way to the house of
their aunt. He presented the order as in the nature of a writ
from the Duke, and amongst Lutherans in London a heavy growl of
rage went up&mdash;against Norfolk, against the Papists of the
Privy Council, and, above all, against Katharine Howard, whom
they called the New Harlot.</p>
<p>Katharine, having taken much nightshade juice, was raving upon
her bed. The leech became convinced that she was possessed by a
demon, because the pupils of her eyes were as large as silver
groats, and her hands picked at the coverlets. He ordered that
thirteen priests should say an exorcism at the door of her room,
and that the potion of nightshade&mdash;since it might
inconvenience without dislodging the fiend inhabiting her slender
body&mdash;should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Udal sought for priests, but having no money, he was
disregarded by them. He ran to the chaplain of the Bishop of
Winchester. For the clergy upheld or ordained by Archbishop
Cranmer were held to be less efficacious in matters of witchcraft
and possession. Just then Cromwell had triumphed, and Anne of
Cleves was upon the water coming to the palace.</p>
<p>Bishop Gardiner's chaplain, a fat man, with beady and
guileless eyes sunk in under an immense forehead, imagined that
Udal's visit was a pretext for overhearing the words of rage and
discomfiture that in that Papist centre might be let drop about
the new Queen. For Udal, because Privy Seal had set him with the
Lady Mary, passed amongst the Papists for one of Cromwell's
informants, and it amused his sardonic and fantastic nature to
affect mysterious denials, which made the fiction the more firmly
believed and gave to Udal himself a certain hated prestige. The
chaplain answered that in the present turmoil no such body as
thirteen clergymen could be found.</p>
<p>'But the lady shall be torn in pieces,' Udal shrieked. Panic
had overcome him. Who knew that the fiend, having torn his
Katharine asunder, might not enter into the body of his Margot,
who was already at her bedside? His lips quivered with terror,
his eyes smiled furiously, he wrung his hands. He swore he would
penetrate to the King's Highness' self. Udal was a man who stuck
at nothing to gain a point. He had heard from Katharine that the
King had spoken graciously to her, and he swore once more that
she was the apple of the King's eye, as well as a beloved
disciple of Privy Seal's.</p>
<p>'Be sure,' he foamed, 'they shall be avenged on a Gardiner and
his crew if you let her die.'</p>
<p>The chaplain said impassively: 'God forbid that we, who are
loyal to his Highness, should listen to these tales you bring us
of his lechery!' They had there a new Queen, their duty was to
her, and to no Katharine Howard. The bishop's clergy were all
joyfully setting to welcome the lady from Cleves, they had no
time to waste over a leman's demons. It overjoyed him to refuse
Privy Seal's man a boon on the plea of loyalty to the new Queen.
Nevertheless, he went straight to the presence of the bishop, and
told him the marvels that Udal had reported.</p>
<p>'The man is incontinent and a babbler,' the chaplain said. 'We
may believe one tenth.'</p>
<p>'Well, you shall find for once how this wench is housed and
where,' his master answered moodily. 'God knows what we may
believe in these days. Doubtless the Nuntio of Satan hath a new
plot in the hatching.' Making these enquiries, the chaplain came
upon the backwash of Udal's reports that the King loved some
leman. Some lady, somewhere&mdash;some said a Howard, some a
Rochford, some would have it a Spanish woman&mdash;was being
hidden up, either by the King, by the Duke of Norfolk, or by
Privy Seal. God knew the truth of these things: but similar had
happened before; and it was certain that the Cleves woman had
been for long kept dangling at Rochester. Perhaps that was the
reason. His Highness had his own ways in these matters: but where
there was smoke, generally fire was to be found. The chaplain
brought this budget back to Bishop Gardiner. Gardiner swore a
wild oath that, by the bones of the Confessor, they had unmasked
a new plot of Satan's Legate, the Privy Seal. But, by the grace
of God, he would counter-plot him.</p>
<p>Udal, who had started all these rumours, had run to get the
help of a Dean of Durham, with whom formerly he had had much
converse as to the position of the Islands of the Blest. He never
found him; the palace was in confusion, with the doors all open
and men running from room to room to ask of each other how far it
might be safe to be extravagant in their demonstrations of joy at
the coming of the new Queen.</p>
<p>All night long, from about dusk, the palace rang with salvos
of artillery, loud shouts and the blowing of horns: the windows
glowed duskily now and again with the light of bonfires that
leapt up and subsided. Margot Poins, who was used to rejoicings
in the City, set the heavy wooden bar across the door in
Katharine Howard's room, turned the immense key in the rusty
lock, and opened to no knocking until the day broke. There were
shouts and stumblings in the corridor outside and the magister
himself, very intoxicated and shrieking, came hammering at the
door with several others towards one in the morning.</p>
<p>Katharine could walk by noon to the lodging that had at last
been assigned to her by Privy Seal's warrant. The magister,
having got himself soundly beaten the night before, was still
sleeping away the effects of it, so she and Margot stayed for an
hour in solitude. Voices passed the door many times, and at last
a Master Viridus entered stealthily. He was one of the Lord
Cromwell's secretaries, and he bore a purse. His name had been
Greene but he had translated it to give a more worshipful sound.
His eyes were furtive and he moved his lips perpetually in
imitation of his master; wore a hooded cap, and made much use of
the Italian language.</p>
<p>'Bounty is the sign of the great, and honourable service
ensureth its continuance,' he said in a dry and arrogant voice.
'This is my Lord Privy Seal's vails. My lord hath gone to his own
house.'</p>
<p>He presented the purse of gold, and peered round at the room
which, following the warrant, had been assigned by a clerk from
the Earl Marshal's office.</p>
<p>'I thank your lord, and shall endeavour to deserve his good
bounty,' Katharine said. The nightshade juice being left two days
behind she had the use of her eyes and much of the stiffness had
gone out of her wrist.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship had much the wiser,' he answered. He lifted the
hangings and, under pretence of examining into her comfort,
peered into the great Flemish press and felt under the heavy
black table to see if it had a drawer for papers. Cromwell had
been forced, following the King's command, to give Katharine her
place. But he had no love for Howards, and already the maids of
the Lady Mary were a mutinous knot. Viridus was instructed to
keep an attentive eye upon this girl&mdash;for they might hang
her very easily since she was outspoken; or, having got her neck
into a noose, they could work upon her terror and make her spy
upon the Lady Mary herself. None of the Lady Mary's women were
housed very sumptuously, but in this room there were at least an
old tapestry, a large Flemish chair, a feather bed in a niche
like an arched cell over which the hangings could be drawn, and a
cord of wood for the fire. He hummed and hawed that workmen must
come to bring her better hangings, and a servitor be found to
keep her door. A watch was to be set on her; the women who
measured her for clothes would try to discover whom she loved and
hated, and the serving man at her door would report her
visitors.</p>
<p>'My lord hath you very present in his mind,' Viridus said.</p>
<p>She was commanded to go on the Saturday to the house in Austin
Friars, where my lord was preparing a great feast in the honour
of the Queen.</p>
<p>Katharine said that she had no dress to go in.</p>
<p>'A seemly decent habit shall be got ready,' he answered. 'You
shall sit in a gallery in private, and it shall be pointed out to
you what lords you shall speak with and whom avoid.' For '<i>com'
&egrave; bella giovinezza</i>'...How beautiful is youth, what a
pleasant season! And since it lasted but a short space it behoved
us all&mdash;and her as much as any&mdash;to make as much as
might be whilst it endured. The regard of a great lord such as
Privy Seal brought present favours and future honours in the
land, honours being pleasant in their turn, when youth is passed,
like the mellow suns of autumn. 'Thereby indeed,' he
apostrophised her, 'the savour of youth reneweth itself again and
again..."<i>Anzi rinuova come fa la luna</i>," in the words of
Boccace.'</p>
<p>Her fair and upright beauty made Viridus acknowledge how
excellent a spy upon the Lady Mary she might make. Papistry and a
loyal love for the Old Faith seemed to be as strong in her candid
eyes as it was implicit in her name. The Lady Mary might trust
her for that and talk with her because of her skill in the
learned tongues. Then, if they held her in their hands, how
splendid a spy she might make, being so trusted! She might well
be won for their cause by the offer of liberal rewards, though
Privy Seal's hand had been heavy upon all her kinsfolk. These men
of Privy Seal's get from him a maxim which he got in turn from
his master Macchiavelli: '<i>Advance therefore those whom it
shall profit thee to make thy servants: for men forget sooner the
death of a father than the loss of a patrimony</i>'&mdash;and
either by threats or by rewards they might make her very
useful.</p>
<p>She had been minded to mock him in the beginning of his
speech, but his dangerous pale-blue eyes made her feel that if he
were ridiculous he was also very powerful, and that she was in
the hands of these men.</p>
<p>Therefore she answered that youth indeed was a pleasant season
when health, good victuals and the love of God sustained it.</p>
<p>He surveyed her out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>'Seek, then, to deserve these good things,' he said. He stayed
some time longer directing her how she should wear her clothes,
and then in the gathering dusk he dwindled stealthily through the
door.</p>
<p>'It is to make you like a chained-up beast or slave,' Margot
said to her mistress.</p>
<p>'Why, hold your tongue, coney, after to-day,' Katharine
answered, 'the walls shall hear. I am a very poor man's daughter
and must even earn my bread if I would stay here.'</p>
<p>'They could never tie me so,' Margot retorted.</p>
<p>Her mistress laughed:</p>
<p>'Why, you may set nets for the wind, but what a man will catch
is still uncertain.'</p>
<p>It was cold, and they piled up the fire, waiting for some one
to bring them candles.</p>
<p>A tall and bulky figure, with a heavy cloak cast over one
shoulder in the Spanish fashion, but with a priest's cap, was
suddenly in the doorway.</p>
<p>'Ha, magister,' Katharine said, knowing no other man that
could visit her. But the firelight shone upon a heavy, firm jaw
that was never the magister's, on white hands and in threatening,
steadfast eyes.</p>
<p>'I am the unworthy Bishop Gardiner, of Winchester,' a harsh
voice said. 'I seek one Katharine Howard. Peace be with you in
these evil days.'</p>
<p>Katharine fell upon her knees before this holy man. He gave
her his blessing perfunctorily, and muttered some words of the
exorcism against demons.</p>
<p>'I am even cured,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>He sent Margot Poins from the room, and stood in the firelight
that threw his great shadow to shake upon the hangings, towering
above Katharine Howard upon her knees. He was silent, as if he
would threaten her, and his brooding eyes glowed and devoured her
face. Here then, she thought, was the man from the other camp
descending secretly upon her. He had no need to threaten, for she
was of his side.</p>
<p>He said that a Magister Udal had reported that she stood in
need of Christian aid, and, speaking Latin with a heavy voice, he
interrogated her as to her faith. The times were evil: many and
various heresies stalked about the land: let her beware of
trafficking with them.</p>
<p>Kneeling still in the firelight, she answered that, so far as
was lawful, she was a daughter of the Church.</p>
<p>He muttered: 'Lawful!' and looked at her for a long time with
brooding and fanatical eyes. 'I hear you have read many heathen
books under a strange master.'</p>
<p>She answered: 'Most Reverend, I am for the Old Faith in the
old way.'</p>
<p>'A prudent tongue is also a Christian possession,' he
muttered.</p>
<p>'Nay there is no one to hear in this room,' she said.</p>
<p>He bent over her to raise her to her feet and holding before
her eyes his missal, he indicated to her certain prayers that she
should recite in order to prevent the fiend's coming to her
again. Suddenly he commanded her to tell him how often she had
conversed with the King's Highness.</p>
<p>Gardiner was the bitterest of all whom Cromwell had to hate
him. He had been of the King's Council, and a secretary before
Cromwell had reached the Court, and, but for Cromwell, he might
well have been the King's best minister. But Cromwell had even
taken his secretaryship; and he was set upon having Privy Seal
down all through those ten years. He had been bishop before any
of these changes had been thought of, and by such Papists as
Katharine Howard he was esteemed the most holy man in the
land.</p>
<p>She told him that she had seen the King but once for a little
time.</p>
<p>'They told me it was many times,' he answered fiercely.
'Should I have come here merely to chatter with you?'</p>
<p>There was something sinister and harsh even in the bluish
tinge of his shaven jaws, and his agate-blue eyes were sombre,
threatening and suspicious.</p>
<p>She answered: 'But once,' and related the story very
soberly.</p>
<p>He threatened her with his finger.</p>
<p>'Have a care that you speak truth. Things will not always
remain in this guise. I come to warn you that you speak the King
with a loyal purpose. His Highness listens sometimes to the
promptings of his women.'</p>
<p>'You might have saved your journey,' she answered. 'I could
speak no otherwise if he loved me.'</p>
<p>He gazed involuntarily round at the hangings as if he
suspected a listener.</p>
<p>'Your Most Reverence does ill to doubt me,' Katharine said
submissively. 'I am of a true house.'</p>
<p>'No house is true save where it finds its account,' he
answered moodily. He could not believe that she spoke the
truth&mdash;for he was unable to believe that any man could speak
the truth&mdash;but it was true she was poorly housed, raggedly
dressed and hidden up in a corner. Nevertheless, these might be
artifices. He made ostentatiously and disdainfully towards the
door.</p>
<p>'Why, God keep you,'&mdash;he moved his fingers in a negligent
blessing&mdash;'I believe you are true, though you are of little
use.' Suddenly he shot out:</p>
<p>'If you would stay here in peace your cousin Culpepper must
begone.'</p>
<p>Katharine put her hand to her heart in sudden fear of these
men who surrounded her and knew everything.</p>
<p>'What hath Tom done?' she asked.</p>
<p>'He hath put a shame upon thee,' the bishop answered. He had
fallen upon Sir Christopher Aske: he had been set in chains for
it, in the Duke's ward room. But upon the coming of the Queen the
night before, all misdemeanants had been cast loose again.
Culpepper had been kept by the guards from entering the palace,
where he had no place. But he had fallen in with the Magister
Udal in the courtyard. Being maudlin and friendly at the time, he
had cast his arms round the magister's neck claiming him for a
loved acquaintance. They had drunk together and had started,
towards midnight, to find the chamber of Katharine Howard,
Culpepper seeking his cousin, and the magister, Margot Poins. On
the way they had enlisted other jovial souls, and the tumult in
the corridor had arisen. 'These scandals are best avoided,' the
bishop finished. 'I have known women lose their lives through
them when they came to have husbands.'</p>
<p>'I could have calmed him,' Katharine said. 'He is always
silent at a word from me.'</p>
<p>Gardiner stood pondering, his head hanging down. His eyes,
hard and blue, flashed at her and then down again at the
floor.</p>
<p>'They told me you were the King's good friend,' he said,
resentfully. 'Your gossip Udal told my chaplain, and it hath been
repeated.'</p>
<p>'They will talk where there are a many together,' Katharine
answered; 'the magister is a notorious babbler and will have told
many lies.'</p>
<p>'He is a spy of Privy Seal's and deep in his councils,'
Gardiner answered gloomily.</p>
<p>A heavy wind that had arisen hurled itself against the dark
casement. Little flaws of cold air penetrated the room, and the
bishop pulled his cap further down over his ears.</p>
<p>'My Lord Privy Seal would send my cousin to Calais where there
is fighting to come,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>Gardiner raised his head sharply at Cromwell's name.</p>
<p>'You speak sense at the end,' he muttered. To him too it had
occurred that if she was to be the King's peaceably, this madman
must begone. If Cromwell wished this lover of this girl out of
the way, the reason was not obscure.</p>
<p>'A man of his hath been here this very day,' Katharine
said.</p>
<p>'Privy Seal learned whoremastering in Italy,' Gardiner cried
triumphantly. 'He saw signs that his Highness inclined to you.
Have a care for your little soul.'</p>
<p>'Why, I think Privy Seal had no such vain imagination,'
Katharine answered submissively. She would have laughed that the
magister's insane babblings should have raised such a coil; but
Gardiner was a man esteemed very saintly, and she kept her eyes
on the floor.</p>
<p>'Give thou ear to no doctrines of Privy Seal's,' he answered
swiftly. 'Thy soul should burn: I will curse thee. If the King
shall offer thee favours for thy friends come thou to me for
spiritual guidance.'</p>
<p>She opened amazed and candid eyes upon him.</p>
<p>'But this is a folly,' she said. 'A King may regard one for a
minute, then it is past. Privy Seal would not bring me up against
the King.'</p>
<p>He flashed his gloomy blue eyes at her, suspecting her, and
still threatening.</p>
<p>'I know how Privy Seal will plot,' he said passionately.
'Having failed with one woman he will bring another.'</p>
<p>He clenched his hands angrily and unclenched them: the wind
moaned for a moment among the chimney stacks.</p>
<p>'So it is!' he cried, from deep down in his chest. 'If it were
not so, how is there all this clamour about his Highness and a
woman?'</p>
<p>'Most Reverend,' she said, 'there is no end to the inventions
of Magister Udal.'</p>
<p>'There is none to the machinations of the fiend, and Udal is
of his councils,' he said. 'Be careful, I tell you, for your
soul's sake. Cromwell shall come to you offering you great
bribes. Have a care I say!'</p>
<p>She attempted to say that Udal had no voice at all in Privy
Seal's councils, being a garrulous magpie that no sane man would
trust. But Gardiner had crossed his arms and stood, immense and
shadowy, in the firelight. He hissed irritably between his teeth
when she spoke, as if she interrupted his meditation.</p>
<p>'All the world knows Udal for his spy,' he said, sombrely. 'If
Udal hath babbled, God be thanked. I say again: if Privy Seal
bring thee to the King, come thou to me. But, by the Grace of
Heaven, I will forestall Privy Seal with thee and the King!'</p>
<p>She forbore to contradict him any more; he had this maggot in
his head, and was so wild to defeat Privy Seal with his own
tool.</p>
<p>He muttered: 'Think you Privy Seal knoweth not the King's
taste? I tell you he hath seen an inclination in him towards you.
This is a plot, but I have sounded it!'</p>
<p>She let him talk, and asked, with a malice too fine for him to
discern:</p>
<p>'I should not shun the King's presence for my soul's
sake?'</p>
<p>'God forbid,' he answered. 'I may use thee to bring down Privy
Seal.'</p>
<p>He picked up a piece of bark from a faggot beside the fire and
rolled it between his fingers. She stood looking at him intently,
her lips a little parted, tall, graceful and submissive.</p>
<p>'You are more fair-skinned than any his Highness has favoured
before,' he said in a meditative voice. 'Yet Cromwell knows the
King's tastes better than any man.' He sank down into her
tall-backed chair and suddenly tossed the piece of bark into the
fire. 'I would have you walk across the floor, elevating your
arms as you were the goddess Flora.'</p>
<p>She tripped towards the door, held her arms above her head,
turned her long body to right and left, bent very low in a
courtesy to him, and let her hands fall restfully into her lap.
The firelight shone upon the folds of her dress and in the white
lining of her hood. He looked at her, leaning over the arm of the
chair, his blue eyes hard with the strenuous rage of his new
project.</p>
<p>'You could take a part in an Italian interlude? A masque?'</p>
<p>'I have a better memory of the French or Latin,' she
answered.</p>
<p>'You do not turn pale? Your knees knock not together?'</p>
<p>'I think I blush most,' she said seriously.</p>
<p>He answered, 'You will be the better of a little colour,' and
began muffling his face with his cloak.</p>
<p>'See you, then,' his harsh voice commanded. 'You shall see
their Highnesses at Privy Seal's house on the Saturday; but they
shall see you at mine on the Tuesday. If you are good enough to
serve the turn of Privy Seal, you may be good enough to serve
mine. The King listens sometimes to the promptings of his women.
I will teach you how you may bring this man down and set me in
his place.'</p>
<p>She reflected for a moment. 'I would well serve you,' she
said. 'But I do not believe this fable of the King, and I have no
memory of Italian.' She talked of being the Lady Mary's servant,
or that she must get her lady's leave.</p>
<p>His brows grew heavy, his eyes threatening and alarming
beneath their heavy lids.</p>
<p>'Be you faithful to me,' he thundered. Even his thin and
delicate hands seemed to menace her. 'Retain your obedience to
your Faith. Your duty is to that, and to no earthly lady before
that.'</p>
<p>Her eyes were cast down, her lips did not move. He said,
harshly, 'It will go ill with you if it become known to Cromwell
I have visited you. Keep this matter secret as you love your
liberty. I will send you the words you shall say by a private
bearer. After, maybe, his Highness shall safeguard you, I
admonishing him. But the Lady Mary shall bid you obey me in all
things.'</p>
<p>He opened the door and put his head out cautiously. Suddenly
he drew it back and said in Latin, 'Here is a spy.' He did not
flinch, but advanced into the corridor, keeping his back to the
servitor whom already Master Viridus had sent to keep her door.
Gardiner fumbled in his robes and pulled out his missal. He
turned the pages over, and, speaking in a feigned and squeaky
voice, once more indicated to her prayers against the visitations
of fiends. Reading them aloud, he interspersed the Latin of the
missal with the phrases, 'You may pray to God he have not seen my
face. Be you very silent and secret, or you are undone. I could
in no wise save you from Cromwell unless the King becomes your
protector.' He finished in the vulgar tongue. 'I pray my prayers
with you may have availed to give you relief. But a simple priest
as myself is of small skill in these visitations. You should have
sent to some great Churchman or one of the worshipful
bishops.'</p>
<p>'Good Father Henry, I thank you,' she answered, having entered
into his artifice. He went away, feigning to limp on his right
knee, and keeping his face from the spy.</p>
<p>At the corner of the corridor Margot Poins, an immense blonde
and gentle figure in Lutheran grey, stood back in the hangings.
The Magister Udal leant over her, supporting himself with one
hand against the wall above her head and one leg crossed beneath
his gown.</p>
<p>'Come you into my room,' Katharine said to the girl; and to
the magister, 'Avoid, man of books. I will have no maid of mine
undone by thee.'</p>
<p>'<i>Venio honoris causa</i>,' he said pertly, and Margot
uttered, 'He seeks me in wedlock,' in a gruff, uncontrolled voice
of a great young girl's confusion, and immense blushes covered
her large cheeks.</p>
<p>Katharine laughed; she was sorely afraid of the serving man
behind her, for that he was a spy set there by Viridus she was
very sure, and she was casting about in her mind for a device
that should let her tell whether or no he had known the bishop.
The squeaky voice and the feigned limp seemed to her stratagems
ignoble and futile on the part of a great Churchman, and his
mania of plots and counter-plottings had depressed and wearied
her, for she expected the great to be wise. But she played her
part for him as it was her duty. She spoke to the girl with her
scarlet cheeks.</p>
<p>'Believe thou the magister after he hath ta'en thee afore a
priest. He hath sought me and two score others in the cause of
honour. Get you in, sweetheart.'</p>
<p>She pushed the girl in at the door. The serving man sat on his
stool; his shock of yellow hair had never known a comb, but he
had a decent suit of a purplish wool-cloth. He had his eyes dully
on the ground.</p>
<p>'As you value your servitorship, let no man come into my room
when I be out,' Katharine said to him. 'Saving only the Father
Henry that was here now.'</p>
<p>The man raised expressionless blue eyes to her face.</p>
<p>'I know not his favours,' he said in a peasant's mutter.
'Maybe I should know him if I saw him again. I am main good at
knowing people.'</p>
<p>'Why, he is from the Sheeres,' Katharine added, still playing,
though she was certain that the man knew Gardiner. 'You shall
know him by his voice and his limp.'</p>
<p>He answered, 'Maybe,' and dropped his eyes to the ground. She
sent him to fetch her some candles, and shut the door upon
him.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>The Queen came to the revels given in her honour by the Lord
Privy Seal. Cromwell had three hundred servants dressed in new
liveries: pikemen with their staves held transversely, like a
barrier, kept the road all the way from the Tower Steps to Austin
Friars, and in that Lutheran quarter of the town there was a
great crowding together. Caps were pitched high and lost for
ever, and loud shouts of praise to God went up when the Queen and
her Germans passed, with boys casting branches of holm, holly,
bay and yew, the only plants that were green in the winter
season, before the feet of her mule. But the King did not come.
It was reported to the crowd that he was ill at Greenwich.</p>
<p>It was known very well by those that sat at dinner with her
that, after three days, he had abandoned his Queen and kept his
separate room. She sat eating alone, on high beneath the dais,
heavy, silent, placid and so fair that her eyebrows appeared to
be white upon her red forehead. She did not speak a word, having
no English, and it was considered disgusting that she wiped her
fingers upon pieces of bread.</p>
<p>Hostile lords remarked upon all her physical imperfections,
which the King, it was known, had reported to his physicians in a
writing of many pages. Besides, she had no English, no French, no
Italian; she could not even play cards with his Highness. It was
true that they had squeezed her into English stays, but she was
reported to have wept at having to mount a horse. So she could
not go a-hawking, neither could she shoot with the bow, and her
attendants&mdash;the women, bound about the middle and spreading
out above and below like bolsters, and the men, who wore their
immense scolloped hats falling over their ears even at
meal-times&mdash;excited disgust and derision by the noises they
made when they ate.</p>
<p>The Master Viridus had Katharine Howard in his keeping. He
took her up into a small gallery near the gilded roof of the long
hall and pointed out to her, far below, the courtiers that it was
safe for her to consort with, because they were friends of Privy
Seal. His manner was more sinister and more meaning.</p>
<p>'You would do well to have to do with no others,' he said.</p>
<p>'I am like to have to do with none at all,' Katharine
answered, 'for no mother's son cometh anigh me.'</p>
<p>He looked away from her. Down below she made out her cousin
Surrey, sitting with his back ostentatiously turned to a Lord
Roydon, of Cromwell's following; her uncle, plunged in his silent
and malignant gloom; and Cromwell, his face lit up and smiling,
talking earnestly with Chapuys, the Ambassador from the
Emperor.</p>
<p>'Eleven hundred dishes shall be served this day,' Viridus
proclaimed, seeming to warn her. 'There can no other lord find so
many plates of parcel gilt.' His level and cold voice penetrated
through all the ascending din of voices, of knives, of tuckets of
trumpets that announced the courses of meat and of the three
men's songs that introduced the sweet jellies which only Privy
Seal, it was said, could direct to be prepared.</p>
<p>'Other lordings all,' Viridus continued with his sermon, 'ha'
ruined themselves seeking in vain to vie with my lord. Most of
those you see are broken men, whose favour would be worth naught
to you.'</p>
<p>Tables were ranged down each side of the great hall, the men
sitting on the right, each wearing upon his shoulder a red rose
made of silk since no flowers were to be had. The women, sitting
upon the left, had white favours in their caps. In the wide space
between these tables were two bears; chained to tall gilt posts,
they rolled on their hams and growled at each other. From time to
time the serving men who went up and down in the middle let fall
great dishes containing craspisces, cranes, swans or boars. These
meats were kicked contemptuously aside for the bears to fight
over, and their places supplied immediately with new. Other
serving men broke priceless bottles of Venetian glass against the
corners of tables, and let the costly Rhenish wines run about
their feet.</p>
<p>This, the Master Viridus said, was intended to point out the
wealth of their lord and his zealousness to entertain his
Sovereigns.</p>
<p>'It would serve the purpose as well to give them twice as much
fare,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>'They could never contain it,' Viridus answered gravely, 'so
great is the bounty of my lord.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton, the spy, enormous, bearded and with the
half-lion badge of the Privy Seal hanging round his neck from a
gilt chain, walked up and down behind the guests, bearing the
wand of a major-domo, affecting to direct the servers when to
fill goblets and listening at tables where much wine had been
served. Once he looked up at the gallery, and his scrutinising
and defiant brown eyes remained for a long time upon Katharine's
face, as if he too were appraising her beauty.</p>
<p>'I would not drink much wine with that man listening at my
back. He came from my country, and was such a foul villain that
mothers fright their children with his name,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>Viridus moved his lips quickly one upon another, and suddenly
directed her to observe the new Queen's head-dress, broad and
stiffened with a wire of gold, upon which large pearls had been
sewn.</p>
<p>'Many ladies will now get themselves such headdresses,' he
said.</p>
<p>'That will I never,' she answered. It appeared atrocious and
Flemish-clumsy, spreading out and overshadowing the Queen's heavy
face. Their English hoods with the tails down made the head sleek
and comely; or, with the tails folded up and pinned square like
flat caps they could give to the face a gallant or a pensive
expression.</p>
<p>'Why, I could never get me in at the door of the confessional
with such a spreading cloth.'</p>
<p>Viridus had his chin on the rail of the gallery; he gazed down
below with his snaky eyes. She could not tell whether he were old
or young.</p>
<p>'You would more prudently abandon the confessing,' he said,
without looking at her. 'My lord is minded that ladies who look
to him should wear such.'</p>
<p>'That is to be a bond-slave,' Katharine cried indignantly. He
looked round.</p>
<p>'Here is a great magnificence,' he uttered, moving his hand
towards the hall. 'My Lord Privy Seal hath a mighty power.'</p>
<p>'Not power enow to make me a laughing-stock for the men.'</p>
<p>'Why, this is a free land,' he answered. 'You may rot in a
ditch if you will, or worse if treasonable actions be brought
home to you.'</p>
<p>Down below, wild men dressed in the skins of wolves, hares and
stags ran round the tethered bears bearing torches of sweet wood,
and a heavy and languorous smoke, like incense, mounted up to the
gallery. Viridus' unveiled threat made the necessity for
submission come once more into her mind. Other wild men were
leading in a lion, immense and lean as if it were a fawn-coloured
ass. It roared and pulled at the golden chains by which the knot
of men held it. Many ladies shrieked out, but the men dragged the
lion into the open space before the dais where the Queen sat
unmoved and stolid.</p>
<p>'Would your master have me dip my fingers in the dish and wipe
them on bread-manchets as the Queen does?' Katharine asked in a
serious expostulation.</p>
<p>'It were an excellent action,' Viridus answered.</p>
<p>There was a brazen flare of trumpets so that the smoke swirled
among the rafters. Men with brass helmets and shields of brass
were below in the hall.</p>
<p>'They are costumed as the ancient Romans,' Katharine said,
lost in other thoughts.</p>
<p>Suddenly she saw that whilst all the other eyes were upon the
lion, Throckmorton's glare was again upon her face. He appeared
to shake his head and to bow his immense and bearded form. It
brought into her mind the dangerous visit of Bishop Gardiner.
Suddenly he dropped his eyes.</p>
<p>'You see some friends,' Viridus' voice asked beside her.</p>
<p>'Nay, I have no friends here,' Katharine answered.</p>
<p>She could not tell that the bearded spy's eyes were not merely
amorous in their intention, for such looks she was used to, and
he was a very vile man.</p>
<p>'In short,' Viridus spoke, 'it were an excellent action to act
in all things as the Queen does. For fashions are a matter of
fashion. It is all one whether you wipe your fingers on
bread-manchets or on napkins. But when a fashion becometh general
its strangeness departeth and it is esteemed fit for a King's
Court. Thus you may earn your bread: this is your duteous work.
Observe the king of the beasts. See how it shall do its duty
before the Queen, and mark the lesson.' His voice penetrated, low
and level, through all the din from below. Yet the men dressed
like gladiators advanced towards the dais where the Queen sat
eating unmoved. The lion before her growled frightfully, and
dragged its keepers towards the men in brass. They drew their
short swords and beat upon their shields crying: 'We be Roman
traitors that war upon this land.' Then it appeared that among
them in their crowd they had a large mannikin, dressed like
themselves in brass and running upon wheels.</p>
<p>The ladies pressed the tables with their hands, making as if
to rise in terror. But the mannikin toppling forward fell before
the lion with a hollow sound of brass. The lean beast, springing
at its throat, tore it to reach the highly smelling flesh that
was concealed within the tunic, and the Romans fled, casting away
their shields and swords. One of them had a red forked beard and
wide-open blue eyes. He brought into Katharine's mind the
remembrance of her cousin. She wondered where he could be, and
imagined him with that short sword, cutting his way to her
side.</p>
<p>'That sight is allegorically to show,' Viridus was commenting
beside her, 'how the high valour of Britain shall defend from all
foes this noble Queen.'</p>
<p>The lion having reached its meat lay down upon it.</p>
<p>Katharine remembered that Bishop Gardiner said that her cousin
must be begone. She tried to say to Viridus: 'Sir, I would fain
obey you in these things, but I have a cousin that shall much
hinder me.'</p>
<p>But the applause of the people below drowned her voice and
Viridus continued talking.</p>
<p>Let it be true that the Queen, being alone, showed amongst
their English fineries and nicenesses a gross and repulsive
strangeness. But if their ladies put on her manners she should no
longer be alone, and it would appear to the King and to all men
that her example was both commended and emulated. It was a matter
of kingcraft, and so the Lord Privy Seal was minded and
determined.</p>
<p>'Then I will even get myself such a hat and tear my capons
apart with my fingers,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>'You had much the wiser,' he answered.</p>
<p>The hall was now full of wild men, nymphs in white gowns, men
bearing aspergers with which to scatter perfumes, and merry
andrews, so that the floor could no longer be seen. A party of
lords had overset a table in their efforts to get to the nymphs.
The Queen was schooled to go out behind the arras, and the
ladies, laughing, calling to each other and to the men at the
other tables, and pinning up their hoods, filed out after
her.</p>
<p>'I shall do my best to please your master and mine,' Katharine
said. 'But he must even help me, or I can be no example to
emulate, but one at whom the finger of scorn is likely to be
pointed.'</p>
<p>Viridus paused before he led his charge from the gallery. His
pale-blue eyes were more placable.</p>
<p>'You shall be well seconded. But have a care. Dally with no
traitors. Speak fairly of your master's friends.' He touched her
above the left breast with a claw-like finger. 'The Italian
writes: "Whoso mocketh my love mocketh also mine own self."'</p>
<p>'I mock none,' Katharine said. 'But I have a cousin to be
provided for that neither you nor I shall mock with much safety
if he be sober enough to stand.'</p>
<p>He listened to her with his hand upon the door of the gallery:
his air was attentive and aroused. She related very simply how
Culpepper had besieged her door&mdash;'He came to London to help
me on my way and to seek fortune in some war. I would that a
place might be found for him, for here he is like to ruin both
himself and me.'</p>
<p>'We have need of good swordsmen for an errand,' he said, in an
absorbed voice.</p>
<p>'There was never a better than Tom,' Katharine said. 'He hath
cut a score of throats. Your lord would have sent him to
Calais.'</p>
<p>He muttered:</p>
<p>'Why, there are places other than Calais where a man may make
a fortune.'</p>
<p>Something sinister in his brooding voice made her say:</p>
<p>'I would not have him killed. He hath made me many
presents.'</p>
<p>He looked at her expressionlessly:</p>
<p>'It is very certain that you can not serve my lord with such a
firebrand to your tail,' he said. 'I will find him an
errand.'</p>
<p>'But not where he shall be killed,' she said again.</p>
<p>'Why,' he said slowly, 'I will send him where he will make a
great fortune.'</p>
<p>'A great fortune would help him little,' she answered. 'I
would have him sent where he may fight evenly matched.'</p>
<p>He laid his hand upon her wrist.</p>
<p>'He is in as much danger here as anywhere. This is not
Lincolnshire, but an ordered Court.'&mdash;A man drew his sword
with some peril there, for there were laws against it. If men
came brawling in the maids' quarters at nights there were
penalties of losing fingers, hands, or even heads. And the maids
themselves were liable to be whipped.&mdash;He shook his head at
her:</p>
<p>'If your cousin hath so violent an inclination to you I were
your best friend to send him far away.'</p>
<p>It was in his mind that if they were to breed this girl to be
a spy they must keep her protected from madmen. Something of
mystery in his manner penetrated to her quick senses.</p>
<p>'God help me, what a dangerous place this is!' she said. 'I
would I had never spoken to you of my cousin.'</p>
<p>He eyed her solemnly and said that if she were minded to wed
this roaring boy they might both, and soon, earn fortunes to buy
them land in a distant shire.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>The young Poins, in his scarlet and black, drew his sister
into a corner of the hall in which the gentry of the Lords that
were there had already dined. It was a vast place, used as a rule
for hearing suitors to the Lord Privy Seal and for the audit
dinners of his tenantry in London. On its whitened walls there
were trophies of arms, and between the wall and the platform at
the end of the hall was a small space convenient for private
talk. The rest of the people there were playing round games for
kissing forfeits or clustered round a magician who had brought a
large ape to tell fortunes by the <i>Sortes Virgilian&aelig;</i>.
It fumbled about in the pages of a black-letter &AElig;neid, and
scratched its side voluptuously: taking its own time it looked at
the pages attentively with a mournful parody of an aged sage, and
set its finger upon a line that the fates directed.</p>
<p>'Here's a great ado about thee,' Poins said, laughing at his
sister. 'Thy name is up in this town of London.'</p>
<p>He had come in the bodyguard of the Queen, and had made time
to slip round to old Badge's low house behind the wall in order
to beg from his grandfather ten crowns to pay for a cloak he had
lost at cards.</p>
<p>'Such a cackle among these Lutherans,' he mocked at Margot.
'Heard you no hootings as your lady rode here behind us of the
guard?'</p>
<p>'I heard none, nor she deserveth none,' Margot answered. 'For
I love her most well.'</p>
<p>'Aye, she hath done a rape on thee,' he laughed. 'Aye, our
good uncle hath printed a very secret libel upon her.' He began
to whisper: Let it not be known or a sudden vengeance might fall
upon their house. It was no small matter to print unlicensed
broadsides. But their moody uncle was out of all fear of
consequences, so mad with rage. 'He would have broken my back,
because I tore thee from his tender keeping.'</p>
<p>'Sure it was never so tender,' Margot said. 'When was there a
day that he did not beat me?' But he would have married her to
his apprentice, a young fellow with a golden tongue, that
preached every night to a secret congregation in a Cripplegate
cellar.</p>
<p>'Why, an thou observest my maxims,' the boy said,
sententiously, 'I will have thee a great lady. But uncle hath
printed this libel, and tongues are at work in Austin Friars.' It
was said that this was a new Papist plot. Margot was but the
first that they should carry off. The Duke and Bishop Gardiner
were reported to have signed papers for abducting all the
Lutheran virgins in London. They were to be led from the paths of
virtue into Catholic lewdnesses, and all their boys were to be
abducted and sent into monasteries across the seas.</p>
<p>'Thus the race of Lutherans should die out,' he laughed. 'Why
they are hiding their maidens in pigeon-houses in Holborn. A boy
called Hugh hath gone out and never come home, and it is said
that masked men in black stuff gowns were seen to put him into a
sack in Moorfields.'</p>
<p>'Well, here be great marvels,' Margot laughed.</p>
<p>He shook his red sides, and his blue eyes grew malicious and
teasing:</p>
<p>'Such a strumpet as thy lady,' he uttered. 'A Papist Howard
that is known to have been loved by twenty men in Lincoln.'</p>
<p>Margot passed from laughter into hot anger:</p>
<p>'It is a marvel God strikes not their tongues with palsy that
said that,' she said swiftly. 'Why do you not kill some of them
if you be a man?'</p>
<p>'Why, be calmed,' he said. 'You have heard such tales before
now. It is no more than saying that a woman goes not to their
churches to pray.'</p>
<p>A young Marten Pewtress, half page, half familiar to the Earl
of Surrey, came towards them calling, 'Hal Poins.' He had black
down upon his chin and a roving eye. He wore a purple coat like a
tabard, and a cap with his master's arms upon a jewelled
brooch.</p>
<p>'They say there's a Howard wench come to Court,' he cried from
a distance, 'and thy sister in her service.'</p>
<p>'We talk of her,' Poins answered. 'Here is my sister.'</p>
<p>The young Pewtress kissed the girl upon the cheek.</p>
<p>'Pray, you, sweetheart, unfold,' he said. 'You are a pretty
piece, and have a good brother that's my friend.'</p>
<p>He asked all of a breath whether this lady had yet had the
small-pox? whether her hair were her own? how tall she stood
without high heels to her shoon? whether her breath were sweet or
her language unpleasing in the Lincolnshire jargon? whether the
King had sent her many presents?</p>
<p>Margaret Poins was a very large, fair, and credulous creature,
rising twenty. Florid and slow-speaking, she had impulses of
daring that covered her broad face with immense blushes. She was
dressed in grey linsey-woolsey, and wore a black hood after the
manner of the stricter Protestants, but she had round her neck a
gilt medallion on a gold chain that Katharine Howard had given
her already. She was, it was true, the daughter of a gentleman
courtier, but he had been knocked on the head by rebels near
Exeter just before her birth, and her mother had died soon after.
She had been treated with gloomy austerity by her uncle and with
sinister kindness by her grandfather, whom she dreaded. So that,
coming from her Bedfordshire aunt, who had a hard cane, to this
palace, where she had seen fine dresses and had already been
kissed by two lords in the corridors, she was ready to aver that
the Lady Katharine had a breath as sweet as the kine, a white
skin which the small-pox had left unscarred, hair that reached to
her ankles, and a learning and a wit unimaginable. Her own
fortune was made, she believed, in serving her. Both the magister
and her brother had sworn it, and, living in an age of
marvels&mdash;dragons, portents from the heavens, and the
romances of knight errantry&mdash;she was ready to believe it. It
was true that the lady's room had proved a cell more bare and
darker than her own at home, but Katharine's bright and careless
laughter, her fair and radiant height, and her ready kisses and
pleasant words, made the girl say with hot loyalty:</p>
<p>'She is more fair than any in the land, and, indeed, she is
the apple of the King's eye.' Her voice was gruff with emotion,
but, suddenly becoming very aware that she was talking to a
strange young gentleman who might scoff, she seemed to choke and
put her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>Brocades for dresses, perfumes, gloves, oranges, and even
another netted purse of green silk holding gold had continued to
be brought to their chamber ever since Privy Seal had signed the
warrant, and, it being about the new year, these ordinary vails
and perquisites of a Maid of Honour made a show. Margot believed
very sincerely that these things came direct from the King's
hands, since they were formally announced as coming of his
Highness' great bounty.</p>
<p>She reported to young Pewtress, 'And even now she is with the
Lord Privy Seal, who brought her to Court.'</p>
<p>'He will go poaching among our Howards now,' Pewtress said. He
stood considering with an air of gloom that the Norfolk servants
imitated from their master, along with such sayings as that the
times were very evil, and that no true man's neck was safe on his
shoulders. 'Pray you, Sweetlips, tell no one this for a day until
I have told my master. It may get me some crowns.' He pinched her
chin between his thumb and forefinger. 'I will be your
sweetheart, pretty.'</p>
<p>'Nay, I am provided with a good one,' Margot said
seriously.</p>
<p>'You cannot have too many in this place. Take me for when the
other's in gaol and another for when I am hung, as all good men
are like to be.' He turned away lightly and loosened one of his
jewelled garters, so that his stockings should hang in slovenly
folds to prove that he was a man and despised niceness in his
dress.</p>
<p>'I would that you be not too cheap to these gentry,' her
brother said, with his eyes on Pewtress.</p>
<p>'I did naught,' she answered. 'If a gentleman will kiss one,
it is uncourtly to turn away the cheek.'</p>
<p>'There is a way of not lending the lip,' he lectured her. 'I
shall school you. A kiss here, a kiss there, I grant you. But
consider that you be a gentleman's child, and ask who a man
is.'</p>
<p>'He was well enough favoured,' she remonstrated.</p>
<p>'In these changing days many upstarts are come about the
Court,' he went on with his lesson. 'Such were not here in the
old days. Crummock hath wrought this. Seek advancement; pleasure
your mistress, who can advance you; smile upon the magister, who,
being advanced, can advance you. Speak courteous and fair words
to any great lords that shall observe you. So we can rise in the
world.'</p>
<p>'I will observe thy words,' she said submissively, for he
seemed to her great and learned; 'but I like not that thou
call'st me "you."'</p>
<p>'Why, these be grave matters,' he replied, 'and "you" is
graver than "thou." But I love thee well. I will take thee a walk
if the sun shine to-morrow.' He tightened his belt and took his
pike from the corner. 'As for your lady; those that made these
lies are lowsels. I could slay a score of them if they pressed
upon you two.'</p>
<p>'I would not be so spoken of,' Margot answered.</p>
<p>'Then you must never rise in the world, as I am minded you
shall,' he retorted, 'for, you being in a high place, eyes will
be upon you.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Katharine Howard heard no evil words shouted
after her that day. Pikemen and servitors of Cromwell were too
thick upon all the road to the Tower, where the courtiers took
barge again. Cromwell made very good order that no insults should
reach the ears of such of the Papist nobles as came to his feast;
they would make use with the King of evil words if any such were
shouted. Thus the more dangerous and the most foul-mouthed of
that neighbourhood, when the Court went by, found hands pressed
over their mouths or scarves suddenly tightened round their
throats by stalwart men that squeezed behind them in the narrow
ways, so that not many more than twenty heads on both sides were
broken that day; and Margot Poins kept her mouth closed tight
with a sort of rustic caution&mdash;a shyness of her mistress and
a desire to spare her any pain. Thus it was not until long after
that Katharine heard of these rumours.</p>
<p>Katharine was in high good spirits. She had no great reason,
for Viridus had threatened her; the Queen had rolled her large
eyes round when Katharine had made her courtesy, but no words
intelligible to a Christian had come from the thick lips; and no
lord or lady had noticed her with a word except that, late in the
afternoon, her cousin Surrey, a young man with a sleepily
insolent air and front teeth that resembled a rabbit's, had
suddenly planted himself in front of her as she sat on a stool
against the hangings. He had begun to ask her where she was
housed, when another young man caught him by the shoulder and
pulled him away before he could do more than bid her sit there
till he came again. She had been in no mood to do that for her
cousin Surrey; besides, she would not be seen to speak much with
a Papist henchman in that house. He could seek her if he wanted
her company, so she went into another part of the hall, where
they were all strangers.</p>
<p>Except for the mere prudence of pretending to obey Viridus
until it should be safe to defy him and his master, she troubled
little about what was going to happen to her. It was enough that
she was away from the home where she had pined and been lonely.
She sat on her stool, watched the many figures that passed her,
marked fashions of embroidery, and thought that such speeches as
she chanced to hear were ill-turned. Her sister Maids of Honour
turned their backs upon her. Only the dark girl, Cicely Elliott,
who had gibed at her a week ago, helped her to pin her sleeve
that had been torn by a sword-hilt of some man who had turned
suddenly in a crowd. But Katharine had learnt, as well as the
magister, that when one is poor one must accept what the gods
send. Besides, she knew that in the Lady Mary's household she was
certain to be avoided, for she was regarded still as a spy of old
Crummock's. That, most likely, would end some day, and she had no
love for women's chatter.</p>
<p>She sat late at night correcting the embroidery of some
true-love-knots that Margot had been making for her. A huckster
had been there selling ribands from France, and showing a doll
dressed as the ladies of the French King's Court were dressing
that new year. He had been talking of a monster that had been
born to a pig-sty on Cornhill, and lamenting that travel was
become a grievous costly thing since the monasteries, with their
free hostel, had been done away with. The monster had been much
pondered in the city; certainly it portended wars or strange
public happenings, since it had the face of a child, greyhound's
ears, a sow's forelegs, and a dragon's tail. But the huckster had
gone to another room, and Margot was getting her supper with the
Lady Mary's serving-maids.</p>
<p>'Save us!' Katharine said to herself over her
embroidery-frame, 'here be more drunkards. If I were a Queen I
would make a law that any man should be burnt on the tongue that
was drunk more than seven times in the week.' But she was already
on her feet, making for the door, her frame dropped to the
ground. There had been a murmur of voices through the thick oak,
and then shouts and objurgations.</p>
<p>Thomas Culpepper stood in the doorway, his sword drawn, his
left hand clutching the throat of the serving man who was
guarding her room.</p>
<p>'God help us!' Katharine said angrily; 'will you ruin me?'</p>
<p>'Cut throats?' he muttered. 'Aye, I can cut a throat with any
man in Christendom or out.' He shook the man backwards and
forwards to support himself. 'Kat, this offal would have kept me
from thee.'</p>
<p>Katharine said, 'Hush! it is very late.'</p>
<p>At the sound of her voice his face began to smile.</p>
<p>'Oh, Kat,' he stuttered jovially, 'what law should keep me
from thee? Thou'rt better than my wife. Heathen to keep man and
wife apart, I say, I.'</p>
<p>'Be still. It is very late. You will shame me,' she
answered.</p>
<p>'Why, I would not have thee shamed, Kat of the world,' he
said. He shook the man again and threw him good humouredly
against the wall. 'Bide thou there until I come out,' he
muttered, and sought to replace his sword in the scabbard. He
missed the hole and scratched his left wrist with the point.
'Well, 'tis good to let blood at times,' he laughed. He wiped his
hand upon his breeches.</p>
<p>'God help thee, thou'rt very drunk,' Katharine laughed at him.
'Let me put up thy sword.'</p>
<p>'Nay, no woman's hand shall touch this blade. It was my
father's.'</p>
<p>An old knight with a fat belly, a clipped grey beard and
roguish, tranquil eyes was ambling along the gallery, swinging a
small pair of cheverel gloves. Culpepper made a jovial lunge at
the old man's chest and suddenly the sword was whistling through
the shadows.</p>
<p>The old fellow planted himself on his sturdy legs. He laughed
pleasantly at the pair of them.</p>
<p>'An' you had not been very drunk I could never have done
that,' he said to Culpepper, 'for I am passed of sixty, God help
me.'</p>
<p>'God help thee for a gay old cock,' Culpepper said. 'You could
not have done it without these gloves in your fist.'</p>
<p>'See you, but the gloves are not cut,' the knight answered. He
held them flat in his fat hands. 'I learnt that twist forty years
ago.'</p>
<p>'Well, get you to the wench the gloves are for,' Culpepper
retorted. 'I am not long together of this pleasant mind.' He went
into Katharine's room and propped himself against the door
post.</p>
<p>The old man winked at Katharine.</p>
<p>'Bid that gallant not draw his sword in these galleries,' he
said. 'There is a penalty of losing an eye. I am Rochford of
Bosworth Hedge.'</p>
<p>'Get thee to thy wench, for a Rochford,' Culpepper snarled
over his shoulder. 'I will have no man speak with my coz. You
struck a good blow at Bosworth Hedge. But I go to Paris to cut a
better throat than thine ever was, Rochford or no Rochford.'</p>
<p>The old man surveyed him sturdily from his head to his heels
and winked once more at Katharine.</p>
<p>'I would I had had such manners as a stripling,' he uttered in
a round and friendly voice. 'I might have prospered better in
love.' Going sturdily along the corridor he picked up Culpepper's
sword and set it against the wall.</p>
<p>Culpepper, leaning against the doorpost, was gazing with
ferocious solemnity at the open clothes-press in which some
hanging dresses appeared like women standing. He smoothed his red
beard and thrust his cap far back on his thatch of yellow
hair.</p>
<p>'Mark you,' he addressed the clothes-press harshly, 'that is
Rochford of Bosworth Hedge. At the end of that day they found him
with seventeen body wounds and the corpses of seventeen Scotsmen
round him. He is famous throughout Christendom. Yet in me you see
a greater than he. I am sent to cut such a throat. But that's a
secret. Only I am a made man.'</p>
<p>Katharine had closed her door. She knew it would take her
twenty minutes to get him into the frame of mind that he would go
peaceably away.</p>
<p>'Thou art very pleasant to-night,' she said. 'I have seldom
seen thee so pleasant.'</p>
<p>'For joy of seeing thee, Kat. I have not seen thee this six
days.' He made a hideous grinding sound with his teeth. 'But I
have broken some heads that kept me from thee.'</p>
<p>'Be calm,' Katharine answered; 'thou seest me now.'</p>
<p>He passed his hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>'I'll be calm to pleasure thee,' he muttered apologetically.
'You said I was very pleasant, Kat.' He puffed out his chest and
strutted to the middle of the room. 'Behold a made man. I could
tell you such secrets. I am sent to slay a traitor at Rome, at
Ravenna, at Ratisbon&mdash;wherever I find him. But he's in
Paris, I'll tell thee that.'</p>
<p>Katharine's knees trembled; she sank down into her tall
chair.</p>
<p>'Whom shalt thou slay?'</p>
<p>'Aye, and that's a secret. It's all secrets. I have sworn upon
the hilt of my knife. But I am bidden to go by an old-young man,
a make of no man at all, with lips that minced and mowed. It was
he bade the guards pass me to thee this night.'</p>
<p>'I would know whom thou shalt slay,' she asked harshly.</p>
<p>'Nay, I tell no secrets. My soul would burn. But I am sent to
slay this traitor&mdash;a great enemy to the King's Highness,
from the Bishop of Rome. Thus I shall slay him as he comes from a
Mass.'</p>
<p>He squatted about the room, stabbing at shadows.</p>
<p>'It is a man with a red hat,' he grunted. 'Filthy for an
Englishman to wear a red hat these days!'</p>
<p>'Put up your knife,' Katharine cried, 'I have seen too much of
it.'</p>
<p>'Aye, I am a good man,' he boasted, 'but when I come back you
shall see me a great one. There shall be patents for farms given
me. There shall be gold. There shall be never such another as I.
I will give thee such gowns, Kat.'</p>
<p>She sat still, but smoothed back a lock of her fair hair that
glowed in the firelight.</p>
<p>'When I am a great man,' he babbled on, 'I will not wed thee,
for who art thou to wed with a great man? Thou art more cheaply
won. But I will give thee...'</p>
<p>'Thou fool,' she shrieked suddenly at him. 'These men shall
slay thee. Get thee to Paris to murder as thou wilt. Thou shalt
never come back and I shall be well rid of thee.'</p>
<p>He gave her a snarling laugh:</p>
<p>'Toy thou with no man when I am gone,' he said with sudden
ferocity, so that his blue eyes appeared to start from his
head.</p>
<p>'Poor fool, thou shalt never come back,' she answered.</p>
<p>He had an air of cunning and triumph.</p>
<p>'I have settled all this with that man that's no man, Viridus;
thou art here as in a cloister amongst the maids of the Court. No
man shall see thee; thou shalt speak with none that wears not a
petticoat. I have so contracted with that man.'</p>
<p>'I tell thee they have contrived this to be rid of thee,' she
said.</p>
<p>His tone became patronising.</p>
<p>'Wherefore should they?' he asked. When there came no answer
from her he boasted, 'Aye, thou wouldst not have me go because
thou lovest me too well.'</p>
<p>'Stay here,' she said. 'I will give thee money.' He stood
gazing at her with his jaw fallen. 'Thou art a drunkard and a
foul tongue,' she said, 'but if thou goest to Paris to murder a
cardinal thou shalt never come out of that town alive. Be sure
thou shalt be rendered up to death.'</p>
<p>He staggered towards her and caught one of her hands.</p>
<p>'Why, it is but cutting of a man's throat,' he said. 'I have
cut many throats and have taken no harm. Be not sad! This man is
a cardinal. But 'tis all one. It shall make me a great man.'</p>
<p>She muttered, 'Poor fool.'</p>
<p>'I have sworn to go,' he said. 'I am to have great farms and a
great man shall watch over thee to keep thee virtuous. They have
promised it or I had not gone.'</p>
<p>'Do you believe their promises?' she asked derisively.</p>
<p>'Why, 'tis a good knave, yon Viridus. He promised or ever I
asked it.'</p>
<p>He was on his knees before her as she sat, with his arms about
her waist.</p>
<p>'Sha't not cry, dear dove,' he mumbled. 'Sha't go with me to
Paris.'</p>
<p>She sighed:</p>
<p>'No, no. Bide here,' and passed her hand through his ruffled
hair.</p>
<p>'I would slay thee an thou were false to me,' he whispered
over her hand. 'Get thee with me.'</p>
<p>She said, 'No, no,' again in a stifled voice.</p>
<p>He cried urgently:</p>
<p>'Come! Come! By all our pacts. By all our secret vows.'</p>
<p>She shook her head, sobbing:</p>
<p>'Poor fool. Poor fool. I am very lonely.'</p>
<p>He clutched her tightly and whispered in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>'It were merrier at home now. Thou didst vow. At home now. Of
a summer's night...'</p>
<p>She whispered: 'Peace. Peace.'</p>
<p>'At home now. In June, thou didst...'</p>
<p>She said urgently: 'Be still. Wouldst thou woo me again to the
grunting of hogs?'</p>
<p>'Aye, would I,' he answered. 'Thou didst...'</p>
<p>She moved convulsively in her chair. He grasped her more
tightly.</p>
<p>'Thou yieldest, I know thee!' he cried triumphantly. He
staggered to his feet, still holding her hand.</p>
<p>'Thou shalt come to Paris. Sha't be lodged like a Princess.
Sha't see great sights.'</p>
<p>She sprang up, tearing herself from him.</p>
<p>'Get thee gone from here,' she shivered. 'I am done with
starving with thee. I know thy apple orchard wooings. Get thee
gone from here. It is late. I shall be shamed if a man be seen to
leave my room so late.'</p>
<p>'Why, I would not have thee shamed, Kat,' he muttered, her
strenuous tone making him docile as a child.</p>
<p>'Get thee gone,' she answered, panting. 'I will not
starve.'</p>
<p>'Wilt not come with me?' he asked ruefully. 'Thou didst yield
in my arms.'</p>
<p>'I do bid thee begone,' she answered imperiously. 'Get thee
gold if thou would'st have me. I have starved too much with
thee.'</p>
<p>'Why, I will go,' he muttered. 'Buss me. For I depart towards
Dover to-night, else this springald cardinal will be gone from
Paris ere I come.'</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>'Men shall make us cry, in the end, steel our hearts how we
will,' she said to Margot Poins, who found her weeping with her
head down upon the table above a piece of paper.</p>
<p>'I would weep for no man,' Margot answered.</p>
<p>Large, florid, fair, and slow speaking, she gave way to one of
her impulses of daring that covered her afterwards with immense
blushes and left her buried in speechless confusion. 'I could
never weep for such an oaf as your cousin. He beats good
men.'</p>
<p>'Once he sold a farm to buy me a gown,' Katharine said, 'and
he goes to a sure death if I may not stay him.'</p>
<p>'It is even the province of men&mdash;to die,' Margot
answered. Her voice, gruff with emotion, astonished herself. She
covered her mouth with the back of her great white hand as if she
wished to wipe the word away.</p>
<p>'Beseech you, spoil not your eyes with sitting to write at
this hour for the sake of this roaring boy.'</p>
<p>Katharine sat to the table: a gentle knocking came at the
door. 'Let no one come, I have told the serving knave as much.'
She sank into a pondering over the wording of her letter to
Bishop Gardiner. It was not to be thought of that her cousin
should murder a Prince of the Church; therefore the bishop must
warn the Catholics in Paris that Cromwell had this in mind. And
Bishop Gardiner must stay her cousin on his journey: by a false
message if needs were. It would be an easy matter to send him
such a message as that she lay dying and must see him, or
anything that should delay him until this cardinal had left
Paris.</p>
<p>The great maid behind her back was fetching from the
clothes-prop a waterglobe upon its stand; she set it down on the
table before the rush-light, moving on tiptoe, for to her the
writing of a letter was a sort of necromancy, and she was
distressed for Katharine's sake. She had heard that to write at
night would make a woman blind before thirty. The light grew
immense behind the globe; watery rays flickered broad upon the
ceiling and on the hangings, and the paper shone with a mellow
radiance. The gentle knocking was repeated, and Katharine
frowned. For before she was half way through with the humble
words of greeting to the bishop it had come to her that this was
a very dangerous matter to meddle in, and she had no one by whom
to send the letter. Margot could not go, for it was perilous for
her maid to be seen near the bishop's quarters with all
Cromwell's men spying about.</p>
<p>Behind her was the pleasant and authoritative voice of old Sir
Nicholas Rochford talking to Margot Poins. Katharine caught the
name of Cicely Elliott, the dark maid of honour who had flouted
her a week ago, and had pinned up her sleeve that day in Privy
Seal's house.</p>
<p>The old man stood, grey and sturdy, his hand upon her
doorpost. His pleasant keen eyes blinked upon her in the strong
light from her globe as if he were before a good fire.</p>
<p>'Why, you are as fair as a saint with a halo, in front of that
jigamaree,' he said. 'I am sent to offer you the friendship of
Cicely Elliott.' When he moved, the golden collar of his
knighthood shone upon his chest; his cropped grey beard glistened
on his chin, and he shaded his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>'I was writing of a letter,' Katharine said. She turned her
face towards him: the stray rays from the globe outlined her red
curved lips, her swelling chest, her low forehead; and it shone
like the moon rising over a hill, yellow and fiery in the hair
above her brow. The lines of her face drooped with her
perplexities, and her eyes were large and shadowed, because she
had been shedding many tears.</p>
<p>'Cicely Elliott shall make you a good friend,' he said, with a
modest pride of his property; 'she shall marry me, therefore I do
her such services.'</p>
<p>'You are old for her,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>'Since I have neither chick nor child and am main rich for a
subject.'</p>
<p>'Why, she is happy in her servant,' Katharine said
abstractedly. 'You are a very famous knight.'</p>
<p>'There are ballads of me,' he answered complacently. 'I pray
to die in a good tulzie yet.'</p>
<p>'If Cicely Elliott have her scarf in your helmet,' Katharine
said, 'I may not give you mine.' She was considering of her
messenger to the bishop. 'Will you do me a service?'</p>
<p>'Why,' he answered, with a gentle mockery, 'you have one
tricksy swordsman to bear your goodly colours.'</p>
<p>Katharine turned clean about to him and looked at him with
attention, to make out whether he might be such a man as would
carry her letter for her.</p>
<p>He returned her gaze directly, for he was proud of himself and
of his fame. He had fought in all the wars that a man might fight
in since he had been eighteen, and for fifteen years he had been
captain of a troop employed by the Council in keeping back the
Scots of the Borders. It was before Flodden Field that he had
done his most famous deed, about which there were many ballads.
Being fallen upon by a bevy of Scotsmen near a tall hedge, after
he had been unhorsed, he had set his back into a thorn bush, and
had fought for many hours in the rear of the Scottish troop,
alone and with only his sword. The ballad that had been made
about him said that seventeen corpses lay in front of the bush
after the English won through to him. But since Cromwell had
broken up the Northern Councils, and filled them again with his
own men of no birth, the old man had come away from the Borders,
disdaining to serve at the orders of knaves that had been
butchers' sons and worse. He owned much land and was very
wealthy, and, having been very abstemious, because he came of an
old time when knighthood had still some of the sacredness and
austerity of a religion, he was a man very sound in limb and
peaceable of disposition. In his day he had been esteemed the
most graceful whiffler in the world: now he used only the heavy
sword, because he was himself grown heavy.</p>
<p>Katharine answered his gentle sneer at her cousin:</p>
<p>'It is true that I have a servant, but he is gone and may not
serve me.' Yet the knight would find it in the books of chivalry
that certain occasions or great quests allowed of a knight's
doing the errands of more than one lady: but one lady, as for
instance the celebrated Dorinda, might have her claims asserted
by an illimitable number of knights, and she begged him to do her
a service.</p>
<p>'I have heard of these Errantry books,' he said. 'In my day
there were none such, and now I have no letters.'</p>
<p>'How, then, do you pass the long days of peace,' Katharine
asked, 'if you neither drink nor dice?'</p>
<p>He answered: 'In telling of old tales and teaching their paces
to the King's horses.'</p>
<p>He drew himself up a little. He would have her understand that
he was not a horse leech: but there was in these four-footed
beasts a certain love for him, so that Richmond, the King's
favourite gelding, would stand still to be bled if he but laid
his hand on the great creature's withers to calm him. These
animals he loved, since he grew old and might not follow
arguments and disputations of <i>hic</i> and <i>hoc</i>. 'There
were none such in my day. But a good horse is the same from
year's end to year's end...'</p>
<p>'Will you carry a letter for me?' Katharine asked.</p>
<p>'I would have you let me show you some of his Highness'
beasts,' he added. 'I breed them to the manage myself. You shall
find none that step more proudly in Christendom or
Heathenasse.'</p>
<p>'Why, I believe you,' she answered. Suddenly she asked: 'You
have ridden as knight errant?'</p>
<p>He said: 'For three weeks only. Then the Scots came on too
thick and fast to waste time.' His dark eyes blinked and his
broad lips moved humorously with his beard. 'I swore to do
service to any lady; pray you let me serve you.'</p>
<p>'You can do me a service,' she said.</p>
<p>He moved his hand to silence her.</p>
<p>'Pray you take it not amiss. But there is one that hates
you.'</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>'Perhaps there are a many; but do me a service if you
will.'</p>
<p>'Look you,' he said, 'these times are no times of mine. But I
know it is prudent to have servitors that love one. I saw yours
shake a fist at your door.'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'A man?' She looked at Margot, who, big, silent and flushed,
was devouring the celebrated hero of ballads with adoring eyes.
He laughed.</p>
<p>'That maid would kiss your feet. But, in these days, it is
well to make friends with them that keep doors. The fellow at
yours would spit upon you if he dared.'</p>
<p>Katharine said carelessly:</p>
<p>'Let him even spit in his imagination, and I shall whip
him.'</p>
<p>The old knight looked out of the door. He left it wide open,
so that no man might listen.</p>
<p>'Why, he is still gone,' he said. He cleared his throat. 'See
you,' he began. 'So I should have said in the old days. These
fellows then we could slush open to bathe our feet in their warm
blood when we came tired-foot from hunting. Now it is otherwise.
Such a loon may be a spy set upon one.'</p>
<p>He turned stiffly and majestically to move back her new
hangings that only that day, in her absence at Privy Seal's, had
been set in place. He tapped spots in the wall with his broad and
gentle fingers, talking all the time with his broad back to
her.</p>
<p>'See you, you have had here workmen to hang you a new arras.
There be tricks of boring ear-holes through walls in hanging
these things. So that if you have a cousin who shall catch a
scullion by the throat...'</p>
<p>Katharine said hastily:</p>
<p>'He hath heard little to harm me.'</p>
<p>'It is what a man swears he hath heard that shall harm one,'
the old knight answered. 'I meddle in no matters of statecraft,
but I am sent to you by certain ladies; one shall wed me and I am
her servant; one bears my name and wedded a good cousin of mine,
now dead for his treasons.'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'I am beholden to Cicely Elliott and the Lady Rochford...'</p>
<p>He silenced her with one of his small gestures of
old-fashioned dignity and distinction.</p>
<p>'I meddle in none of these matters,' he said again. 'But these
ladies know that you hate one they hate.'</p>
<p>He said suddenly, 'Ah!' a little grunt of satisfaction. His
fingers tapping gently made what seemed a stone of the wall
quiver and let drop small flakes of plaster. He turned gravely
upon Katharine:</p>
<p>'I do not ask what you spoke of with that worshipful
swordsman,' he said. 'But your servitor is gone to tell upon you.
A stone is gone from here and there is his ear-hole, like a drum
of canvas.'</p>
<p>Katharine said swiftly:</p>
<p>'Take, then, a letter for me&mdash;to the Bishop of
Winchester!'</p>
<p>He started back with a little exaggerated pantomime of
horror.</p>
<p>'Must I go into your plots?' he asked, blinking and amused, as
if he had expected the errand.</p>
<p>She said urgently:</p>
<p>'I would have you tell me what Englishman now wears a red hat
and is like to be in Paris. I am very ignorant in these
matters.'</p>
<p>'Then meddle not in them,' he said, 'for that man is even
Cardinal Pole; one that the King's Highness would very willingly
know to be dead.'</p>
<p>'God forbid that my cousin should murder a Prince of the
Church, and be slain in that quarrel,' she answered.</p>
<p>He started back and held his hands over his head.</p>
<p>'Why, God help you, child! Is that your errand?' he said, deep
from his chest. 'I meddle not in this matter.'</p>
<p>She answered obstinately:</p>
<p>'Pray you&mdash;by your early vows&mdash;consent to carry me
my letter.'</p>
<p>He shook his head bodingly.</p>
<p>'I thought it had been a matter of a masque at the Bishop of
Winchester's; or I had never come nigh you. Cicely Elliott hath
copied out the part you should speak. Pray you ask me no more of
the other errand.'</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>'For a great knight you are a friend only in little
matters!'</p>
<p>He uttered reproachfully:</p>
<p>'Child: it is no little matter to act as go-between for the
Bishop of Winchester, even if it be for no more than a masque.
How otherwise does he not send to you direct? So much I was ready
to do for you, a stranger, who am a man that has no party.'</p>
<p>She uttered maliciously:</p>
<p>'Well, well. I thought you came of the better times before our
day.'</p>
<p>'I have shewn myself a good enough man,' he said composedly.
He pointed one of his fingers at her.</p>
<p>'Pole is not one that shall be easily slain. He is like to
have in his pay the defter spadassins of the two. I have known
him since he was a child till when he fled abroad.'</p>
<p>'But my cousin!' Katharine pleaded.</p>
<p>'For the sake of your own little neck, let that gallant be
hanged,' he said smartly. 'You have need of many friends; I can
see it in your complexion, which is of a hasty loyalty. But I
tell you, I had never come near you, so your cousin miscalled me,
a man of worth and credit, had these ladies not prayed me to come
to you.'</p>
<p>She raised herself to her full height.</p>
<p>'It is not in the books of your knight-errantry,' she cried,
'that one should leave one's friends to the hangman of
Paris.'</p>
<p>The large figure of Margot Poins thrust itself upon them.</p>
<p>'A' God's name,' said her gruff voice of great emotion, 'hear
the words of this valiant soldier. Your cousin shall ruin you. It
is true that he will drive from you all your good friends...' She
faltered, and her impulse carried her no further. Rochford tapped
her flushed cheek gently with his glove, but a light and hushing
step in the corridor made them all silent.</p>
<p>The Magister Udal stood before the door blinking his eyes at
the light; Katharine addressed him imperiously&mdash;</p>
<p>'You will carry a letter for me to save my cousin from
death.'</p>
<p>He started, and leered at Margot, who was ready to sink into
the ground.</p>
<p>'Why, I had rather carry a bull to the temple of Jupiter, as
Macrobius has it,' he said, 'meaning that...'</p>
<p>'Yet you have drunk with him,' Katharine interrupted him
hotly, 'you have gone hurling through the night with him. You
have shamed me together.'</p>
<p>'Yet I cannot forget Tully,' he answered sardonically, 'who
warns me that a prudent man should be able to moderate the course
of his friendship, even as he reins his horse. <i>Est prudentis
sustinere ut cursum</i>...'</p>
<p>'Mark you that!' the old knight said to Katharine. 'I will get
my boy to read to me out of Tully, for that is excellent
wisdom.'</p>
<p>'God help me, this is Christendom!' Katharine said, bitterly.
'Shall one abandon one that lay in the same cradle with one?'</p>
<p>'Your ladyship hath borne with him a day too long,' Udal said.
'He beat me like a dog five days since. Have you heard of the
city called Ponceropolis, founded by the King Philip? Your good
cousin should be ruler of that city, for the Great King peopled
it with all the brawlers, cut-throats, and roaring boys of his
dominions, to be rid of them.' She became aware that he was very
angry, for his whisper shook like the neigh of a horse.</p>
<p>The old knight winked at Margot.</p>
<p>'Why this is a monstrous wise man,' he said, 'who yet speaks
some sense.'</p>
<p>'In short,' the magister said, 'If you will stick to this man,
you shall lose me. For I have taken beatings and borne no
malice&mdash;as in the case of men with whose loves or wives I
have prospered better than themselves. But that this man should
miscall me and beat me for the pure frenzy of his mind,
causelessly, and for the love of blows! That is unbearable.
To-night I walk for the first time after five days since he did
beat me. And I ask you whom you shall here find the better
servant?'</p>
<p>His thin figure was suddenly shaking with rage.</p>
<p>'Why, this is conspiracy!' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>'A conspiracy!' Udal's voice rose up into a shriek. 'If your
ladyship were a Queen I would not be a Queen's cousin's whipping
post.' His arms jerked with the spasms of his rage like those of
a marionette.</p>
<p>'A shame that learned men should be so beaten!' Margot's gruff
voice uttered.</p>
<p>Katharine turned upon her.</p>
<p>'That is what made you speak e'ennow. You have been with this
flibbertigibbet.'</p>
<p>'This is a free land,' the girl mumbled, her mild eyes
sparkling with the contagious anger of her lover.</p>
<p>The old knight stood blinking upon Katharine.</p>
<p>'You are like to lose all your servants in this quarrel,' he
said.</p>
<p>Katharine wrung her hands, and then turned her back upon them
and drummed upon the table with her fingers. Udal caught Margot's
large hand and fumbled it beneath the furs of his robe: the old
knight kept his smiling eyes upon Katharine's back. Her voice
came at last:</p>
<p>'Why, I will not have Tom killed upon this occasion into which
I brought him.'</p>
<p>Rochford shrugged his shoulders up to his ears.</p>
<p>'Oh marvellous infatuation,' he said.</p>
<p>Katharine spoke, still with her back turned and her shoulders
heaving:</p>
<p>'A marvellous infatuation!' she said, her voice coming softly
and deeply in her chest. 'Why, after his fashion this man loved
me. God help us, what other men have I seen here that would
strike a straight blow? Here it is moving in the dark, listening
at pierced walls, swearing of false treasons&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>She swept round upon the old man, her face moved, her eyes
tender and angry. She stretched out her hand, and her voice was
pitiful and urgent.</p>
<p>'Sir! Sir! What counsel do you give me, who are a knight of
honour? Would you let a man who lay in the cradle with you go to
a shameful death in an errand you had made for him?'</p>
<p>She leaned back upon the table with her eyes upon his face.
'No you would not. How then could you give me such counsel?'</p>
<p>He said: 'Well, well. You are in the right.'</p>
<p>'Nearly I went with him to another place,' she answered, 'but
half an hour ago. Would to God I had! for here it is all
treacheries.'</p>
<p>'Write your letter, child,' he answered. 'You shall give it to
Cicely Elliott to-morrow in the morning. I will have it conveyed,
but I will not be seen to handle it, for I am too young to be
hanged.'</p>
<p>'Why, God help you, knight,' Udal whispered urgently from the
doorway, 'carry no letter in this affair&mdash;if you escape,
assuredly this mad pupil of mine shall die. For the
King&mdash;&mdash;?' Suddenly he raised his voice to a high nasal
drawl that rang out like a jackdaw's: 'That is very true; and, in
this matter of Death you may read in Socrates' Apology.
Nevertheless we may believe that if Death be a transmigration
from one place into another, there is certainly amendment in
going whither so many great men have already passed, and to be
subtracted from the way of so many judges that be iniquitous and
corrupt.'</p>
<p>'Why, what a plague...' Katharine began.</p>
<p>He interrupted her quickly.</p>
<p>'Here is your serving man back at last if you would rate him
for leaving your door unkept.'</p>
<p>The man stood in the doorway, his lanthorn dangling in his
hand, his cudgel stuck through his belt, his shock of hair rough
like an old thatch, and his eyes upon the ground. He mumbled,
feeling at his throat:</p>
<p>'A man must eat. I was gone to my supper.'</p>
<p>'You are like to have the nightmare, friend,' the old knight
said pleasantly. 'It is ill to eat when most of the world
sleeps.'</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>Cicely Elliott had indeed sent her old knight to Katharine
with those overtures of friendship. Careless, dark, and a madcap,
she had flown at Katharine because she had believed her a
creature of Cromwell's, set to spy upon the Lady Mary's maids.
They formed, the seven of them, a little, mutinous, babbling
circle. Their lady's cause they adored, for it was that of an Old
Faith, such as women will not let die. The Lady Mary treated them
with a hard indifference: it was all one to her whether they
loved her or not; so they babbled, and told evil tales of the
other side. The Lady Rochford could do little to hold them, for,
having come very near death when the Queen Anne fell, she had
been timid ever since, and Cicely Elliott was their
ringleader.</p>
<p>Thus it was to her that one of Gardiner's priests had come
begging her to deliver to Katharine a copy of the words she was
to speak in the masque, and from the priest Cicely had learnt
that Katharine loved the Old Faith and hated Privy Seal as much
as any of them. She had been struck with a quick remorse, and had
suddenly seen Katharine as one that must be helped and made
amends to. Thus she had pinned up her sleeve at Privy Seal's.
There, however, it had not been safe to speak with her.</p>
<p>'Dear child,' she said to Katharine next morning, 'we may well
be foils one to another, for I am dark and pert, like a pynot.
They call me Mag Pie here. You shall be Jenny Dove of the Sun.
But I am not afraid of your looks. Men that like the touch of the
sloe in me shall never be drawn away by your sweet lips.'</p>
<p>She was, indeed, like a magpie, never still for a minute,
fingering Katharine's hair, lifting the medallion upon her chest,
poking her dark eyes close to the embroidery on her stomacher.
She had a trick of standing with her side face to you, so that
her body seemed very long to her hips, and her dark eyes looked
at you askance and roguish, whilst her lips puckered to a smile,
a little on one side.</p>
<p>'It was not your old knight called me Sweetlips,' Katharine
said. 'I miscalled him foully last night.'</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott threw back her head and laughed.</p>
<p>'Why, he is worshipful heavy to send on a message; but you may
trust his advice when he gives it.'</p>
<p>'I am come to think the same,' Katharine said; 'yet in this
one matter I cannot take it.'</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott had taken to herself the largest and highest of
the rooms set apart for these maids. The tapestries, which were
her own, were worked in fair reds and greens, like flowers. She
had a great silver mirror and many glass vases, in which were set
flowers worked in silver and enamel, and a large, thin box carved
out of an elephant's tusk, to hold her pins; and all these were
presents from the old knight.</p>
<p>'Why,' she said, 'sometimes his advice shall fit a woman's
mood; sometimes he goes astray, as in the case of these gloves.
Cheverel is a skin that will stretch so that after one wearing
you may not tell the thumbs from stocking-feet. Nevertheless, I
would be rid of your cousin.'</p>
<p>'Not in this quarrel,' Katharine answered. 'Find him an
honourable errand, and he shall go to Kathay.'</p>
<p>Cicely threw the stretched cheverel glove into the fire.</p>
<p>'My knight shall give me a dozen pairs of silk, stitched with
gold to stiffen them,' she said. 'You shall have six; but send
your cousin in quest of the Islands of the Blest. They lie well
out in the Western Ocean. If you can make him mislay his compass
he will never come back to you.'</p>
<p>Katharine laughed.</p>
<p>'I think he would come without compass or chart. Nevertheless,
I will send me my letter by means of your knight to Bishop
Gardiner.'</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott hung her head on her chest.</p>
<p>'I do not ask its contents, but you may give it me.'</p>
<p>Katharine brought it out from the bosom of her dress, and the
dark girl passed it up her sleeve.</p>
<p>'This shall no doubt ruin you,' she said. 'But get you to our
mistress. I will carry your letter.'</p>
<p>Katharine started back.</p>
<p>'You!' she said. 'It was Sir Nicholas should have it
conveyed.'</p>
<p>'That poor, silly old man shall not be hanged in this matter,'
Cicely answered. 'It is all one to me. If Crummock would have had
my head he could have shortened me by that much a year ago.'</p>
<p>Katharine's eyes dilated proudly.</p>
<p>'Give me my letter,' she said; 'I will have no woman in
trouble for me.'</p>
<p>The dark girl laughed at her.</p>
<p>'Your letter is in my sleeve. No hands shall touch it before
mine deliver it to him it is written to. Get you to our mistress.
I thank you for an errand I may laugh over; laughter here is not
over mirthful.'</p>
<p>She stood side face to Katharine, her mouth puckered up into
her smile, her eyes roguish, her hands clasped behind her
back.</p>
<p>'Why, you see Cicely Elliott,' she said, 'whose folk all died
after the Marquis of Exeter's rising, who has neither kith nor
kin, nor house nor home. I had a man loved me passing well. He is
dead with the rest; so I pass my time in pranks because the hours
are heavy. To-day the prank is on thy side; take it as a gift the
gods send, for to-morrow I may play thee one, since thou art
soft, and fair, and tender. That is why they call me here the
Magpie. My old knight will tell you I have tweaked his nose now
and again, but I will not have him shortened by the head for thy
sake.'</p>
<p>'Why, you are very bitter,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>The girl answered, 'If your head ached as mine does now and
again when I remember my men who are dead; if your head ached as
mine does...' She stopped and gave a peal of laughter. 'Why,
child, your face is like a startled moon. You have not stayed
days enough here to have met many like me; but if you tarry here
for long you will laugh much as I laugh, or you will have grown
blind long since with weeping.'</p>
<p>Katharine said, 'Poor child, poor child!'</p>
<p>But the girl cried out, 'Get you gone, I say! In the Lady
Mary's room you shall find my old knight babbling with the
maidens. Send him to me, for my head aches scurvily, and he shall
dip his handkerchief in vinegar and set it upon my forehead.'</p>
<p>'Let me comb thy hair,' Katharine said; 'my hand is sovereign
against a headache.'</p>
<p>'No, get you gone,' the girl said harshly; 'I will have men of
war to do these errands for me.'</p>
<p>Katharine answered, 'Sit thee down. Thou wilt take my letter;
I must ease thy pains.'</p>
<p>'As like as not I shall scratch thy pink face,' Cicely said.
'At these times I cannot bear the touch of a woman. It was a
woman made my father run with the Marquis of Exeter.'</p>
<p>'Sweetheart,' Katharine said softly, 'I could hold both thy
wrists with my two fingers. I am stronger than most men.'</p>
<p>'Why, no!' the girl cried; 'I may not sit still. Get you gone.
I will run upon your errand. If you had knelt to as many men as I
have you could not sit still either. And not one of my men was
pardoned.'</p>
<p>She ran from the room with a sidelong step like a magpie's,
and her laugh rang out discordantly from the corridor.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary sat reading her Plautus in her large painted
gallery, with all her maids about her sewing, some at a dress for
her, some winding silk for their own uses. The old knight stood
holding his sturdy hands apart between a rope of wool that his
namesake Lady Rochford was making into balls. Other gentlemen
were beside some of the maids, toying with their silks or
whispering in their ears. No one much marked Katharine
Howard.</p>
<p>She glided to her lady and kissed the dry hand that lay in the
lap motionless. Mary raised her eyes from her book, looked for a
leisurely time at the girl's face, and then began again to read.
Old Rochford winked pleasantly at her, and, after she had saluted
his cousin, he begged her to hold the wool in his stead, for his
hands, which were used to sword and shield, were very cold, and
his legs, inured to the saddle, brooked standing very ill.</p>
<p>'Cicely Elliott hath a headache,' Katharine said; 'she bade me
send you to her.'</p>
<p>He waited before her, helping her to adjust the wool on to her
white hands, and she uttered, in a low voice:</p>
<p>'She hath taken my letter for me.'</p>
<p>He said, 'Why, what a' the plague's name...' and stood
fingering his peaked little beard in a gentle perplexity.</p>
<p>Lady Rochford pulled at her wool and gave a hissing sigh of
pain, for the joint of her wrist was swollen.</p>
<p>'It has always been easterly winds in January since the Holy
Blood of Hailes was lost,' she sighed. 'In its day I could get me
some ease in the wrist by touching the phial that held it.' She
shivered with discomfort, and smiled distractedly upon Katharine.
Her large and buxom face was mild, and she seemed upon the point
of shedding tears.</p>
<p>'Why, if you will put your wool round a stool, I will wind it
for you,' Katharine said, because the gentle helplessness of the
large woman filled her with compassion, as if this were her old,
mild mother.</p>
<p>Lady Rochford shook her head disconsolately.</p>
<p>'Then I must do something else, and my bones would ache more.
But I would you would make my cousin Rochford ask the Archbishop
where they have hidden the Sacred Blood of Hailes, that I may
touch it and be cured.'</p>
<p>The old knight frowned very slightly.</p>
<p>'I have told thee to wrap thy fist in lamb's-wool,' he said.
'A hundred times I have told thee. It is very dangerous to meddle
with these old saints and phials that are done away with.'</p>
<p>Lady Rochford sighed gently and hung her head.</p>
<p>'My cousin Anne, that was a sinful Queen, God rest her
soul...' she began.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas listened to her no more.</p>
<p>'See you,' he whispered to Katharine. 'Peradventure it is best
that Cicely have gone. Being a madcap, her comings and goings are
heeded by no man, and it is true that she resorteth daily to the
Bishop of Winchester, to plague his priests.'</p>
<p>'I would not speak so, being a man,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>He smiled at her and patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>'Why, I have struck good blows in my time,' he said.</p>
<p>'And have learned worldly wisdom,' Katharine retorted.</p>
<p>'I would not risk my neck on grounds where I am but ill
acquainted,' he answered soberly. He was all will to please her.
The King, he said, was coming on the Wednesday, after the Bishop
of Winchester's, to see three new stallions walk in their
manage-steps. 'I pray that you will come with Cicely Elliott to
watch from the little window in the stables. These great
creatures are a noble sight. I bred them myself to it.' His mild
brown eyes were bright with enthusiasm and cordiality.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a great silence in the room, and the Lady
Mary raised her head. The burly figure of Throckmorton, the spy,
was in the doorway. Katharine shuddered at the sight of him, for,
in her Lincolnshire house, where he was accounted more hateful
than Judas who betrayed the Lord, she had seen him beat the nuns
when the convents had been turned out of doors, and he had
brought to death his own brother, who had had a small estate near
her father's house. The smile upon his face made her feel sick.
He stroked his long, golden-brown beard, glanced swiftly round
the room, and advanced to the mistress's chair, swinging his
great shoulders. He made a leg and pulled off his cap, and at
that there was a rustle of astonishment, for it had been held
treasonable to cap the Lady Mary. Her eyes regarded him fixedly,
with a granite cold and hardness, and he seemed to have at once a
grin of power and a shrinking motion of currying favour. He said
that Privy Seal begged her leave that her maid Katharine Howard
might go to him soon after one o'clock. The Lady Mary neither
spoke nor moved, but the old knight shrank away from Katharine,
and affected to be talking in the ear of Lady Rochford, who went
on winding her wool. Throckmorton turned on his heels and swung
away, his eyes on the floor, but with a grin on his evil
face.</p>
<p>He left a sudden whisper behind him, and then the silence fell
once more. Katharine stood, a tall figure, holding out the hands
on which the wool was as if she were praying to some invisible
deity or welcoming some invisible lover. Some heads were raised
to look at her, but they fell again; the old knight shuffled
nearer her to whisper hoarsely from his moustachioed lips:</p>
<p>'Your serving man hath reported. Pray God we come safe out of
this!' Then he went out of the room. Lady Rochford sighed deeply,
for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>After a time the Lady Mary raised her head and made a minute,
cold beckoning to Katharine. Her dry finger pointed to a word in
her book of Plautus.</p>
<p>'Tell me what you know of this,' she commanded.</p>
<p>The play was the <i>Menechmi</i>, and the phrase ran,
'<i>Nimis autem bene ora commetavi</i>...' It was difficult for
Katharine to bring her mind down to this text, for she had been
wondering if indeed her time were at an end before it had begun.
She said:</p>
<p>'I have never loved this play very well,' to excuse
herself.</p>
<p>'Then you are out of the fashion,' Mary said coldly, 'for this
<i>Menechmi</i> is prized here above all the rest, and shall be
played at Winchester's before his Highness.'</p>
<p>Katharine bowed her head submissively, and read the words
again.</p>
<p>'I remember me,' she said, 'I had this play in a manuscript
where your <i>commetavi</i> read <i>commentavi</i>.'</p>
<p>Mary kept her eyes upon the girl's face, and said:</p>
<p>'Signifying?'</p>
<p>'Why, it signifies,' Katharine said, 'that Messenio did well
mark a face. If you read <i>commetavi</i> it should mean that he
scratched it with his nails so that it resembled a harrowed
field; if <i>commentavi</i>, that he bethumped it with his fist
so that bruises came out like the stops on a fair writing.'</p>
<p>'It is true that you are a good Latinist,' Mary said
expressionlessly. 'Bring me my inkhorn to that window. I will
write down your <i>commentavi</i>.'</p>
<p>Katharine lifted the inkhorn from its hole in the arm of the
chair and gracefully followed the stiff and rigid figure into the
embrasure of a distant window.</p>
<p>Mary bent her head over the book that she held in her hand,
and writing in the margin, she uttered:</p>
<p>'Pity that such an excellent Latinist should meddle in matters
that nothing concern her.'</p>
<p>Katharine held the inkhorn carefully, as if it had been a
precious vase.</p>
<p>'If you will bid me do naught but serve you, I will do naught
else,' she said.</p>
<p>'I will neither bid thee nor aid thee,' Mary answered. 'The
Bishop of Winchester claims thy service. Serve him as thou
wilt.'</p>
<p>'I would serve my mistress in serving him,' Katharine said.
'He is a man I love little.'</p>
<p>Mary pulled suddenly from her bodice a piece of crumpled
parchment that had been torn across. She thrust it into
Katharine's free hand.</p>
<p>'Such letters I have had written me by my father's men,' she
said. 'If this bishop should come to be my father's man I would
take no service from him.'</p>
<p>Katharine read on the crumpled parchment such words as:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"></div>
</div>
<p>'It was Thomas Cromwell wrote that,' the Lady Mary cried. 'My
father's man!'</p>
<p>'But if this brewer's son be brought down?' Katharine
pleaded.</p>
<p>'Why, I tore his letter across for it is filthy,' Mary said,
'and I keep the halves of his letter that I may remember. If he
be brought down, who shall bring his master down that let him
write so?'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'If this tempter of the Devil's brood were brought down there
should ensue so great an atonement from his sorrowful master whom
he deludes...'</p>
<p>Mary uttered a 'Tush!' of scorn and impatience. 'This is the
babbling of a child. My father is no holy innocent as you and
your like feign to believe.'</p>
<p>'Nevertheless I love you most well,' Katharine pleaded.</p>
<p>Mary snapped her book to. Her cold tone came back over her
heat as the grey clouds of a bitter day shut down again upon a
dangerous flicker of lightning.</p>
<p>'Do as you will,' she said, 'only if your head fall I will
stir no finger to aid you. Or, if by these plottings my father
could be got to send me his men upon their knees and bearing
crowns, I would turn my back upon them and say no word.'</p>
<p>'Well, my plottings are like to end full soon,' Katharine
said. 'Privy Seal hath sent for me upon no pleasant errand.'</p>
<p>Mary said: 'God help you!' with a frigid unconcern, and walked
back to her chair.</p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>Cromwell kept as a rule his private courts either in his house
at Austin Friars, or in a larger one that he had near the Rolls.
But, when the King was as far away from London as Greenwich, or
when such ill-wishers as the Duke of Norfolk were in the King's
neighbourhood, Cromwell never slept far out of earshot from the
King's rooms. It was said indeed that never once since he had
become the King's man had he passed a day without seeing his
Highness once at least, or writing him a great letter. But he
contrived continually to send the nobles that were against him
upon errands at a distance&mdash;as when Bishop Gardiner was made
Ambassador to Paris, or Norfolk sent to put down the North after
the Pilgrimage of Grace. Such errands served a double purpose:
Gardiner, acting under the pressure of the King, was in Paris
forced to make enemies of many of his foreign friends; and the
Duke, in his panic-stricken desire to curry favour with Henry,
had done more harrying, hanging and burning among the Papists
than ever Henry or his minister would have dared to command, for
in those northern parts the King's writ did not run freely. Thus,
in spite of himself the Duke at York had been forced to hold the
country whilst creatures of Privy Seal, men of the lowest birth
and of the highest arrogance, had been made Wardens of the
Marches and filled the Councils of the Borders. Such men, with
others, like the judges and proctors of the Court of
Augmentations, which Cromwell had invented to administer the
estates of the monasteries and escheated lords' lands, with a
burgess or two from the shires in Parliament, many lawyers and
some suppliants of rank, filled the anterooms of Privy Seal.
There was a matter of two hundred of them, mostly coming not upon
any particular business so much as that any enemies they had who
should hear of their having been there might tremble the
more.</p>
<p>Cromwell himself was in the room that had the King's and
Queen's heads on the ceiling and the tapestry of Diana hunting.
He was speaking with a great violence to Sir Leonard Ughtred,
whose sister-in-law, the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, and sister
of the Queen Jane, his son Gregory had married two years before.
It was a good match, for it made Cromwell's son the uncle of the
Prince of Wales, but there had been a trouble about their estates
ever since.</p>
<p>'Sir,' Cromwell threatened the knight, 'Gregory my son was
ever a fool. If he be content that you have Hyde Farm that am not
I. His wife may twist him to consent, but I will not suffer
it.'</p>
<p>Ughtred hung his head, which was closely shaved, and fingered
his jewelled belt.</p>
<p>'It is plain justice,' he muttered. 'The farm was ceded to my
brother after Hyde Monastery was torn down. It was to my brother,
not to my brother's wife, who is now your son's.'</p>
<p>Cromwell turned upon the Chancellor of the Augmentations who
stood in the shadow of the tall mantelpiece. He was twisting his
fingers in his thin grey beard that wagged tremulously when he
spoke.</p>
<p>'Truly,' he bleated piteously, 'it stands in the register of
the Augmentations as the worshipful knight says.'</p>
<p>Cromwell cried out, in a studied rage: 'I made thee and I made
thy office: I will unmake the one and the other if it and thou
know no better law.'</p>
<p>'God help me,' the Chancellor gasped. He shrank again into the
shadow of the chimney, and his blinking eyes fell upon Cromwell's
back with a look of dread and the hatred of a beast that is
threatened at the end of its hole.</p>
<p>'Sir,' Cromwell frowned darkly upon Ughtred, 'the law stands
thus if the Augmentation people know it not. This farm and others
were given to your late brother upon his marriage, that the
sister of the Queen might have a proper state. The Statute of
Uses hath here no say. Understand me: It was the King's to give;
it is the King's still.' He opened his mouth so wide that he
appeared to bellow. 'That farm falleth to the survivor of those
two, who is now my son's wife. What judge shall gainsay that?' He
swayed his body round on his motionless and sturdily planted
legs, veering upon the Chancellor and the knight in turn, as if
he challenged them to gainsay him who had been an attorney for
ten years after he had been a wool merchant.</p>
<p>Ughtred shrugged his shoulders heavily, and the Chancellor
hastened to bleat:</p>
<p>'No judge shall gainsay your lordship. Your lordship hath an
excellent knowledge of the law.'</p>
<p>'Why hast thou not as good a one?' Cromwell rated him. 'I made
thee since I thought thou hadst.' The Chancellor choked in his
throat and waved his hands.</p>
<p>'Thus the law is,' Cromwell said to Ughtred. 'And if it were
not so Parliament should pass an Act so to make it. For it is a
scandal that a Queen's sister, an aunt of the Prince that shall
be King, should lose her lands upon the death of her husband. It
savours of treason that you should ask it. I have known men go to
the Tower upon less occasion.'</p>
<p>'Well, I am a broken man,' Sir Leonard muttered.</p>
<p>'Why, God help you,' Cromwell said. 'Get you gone. The law
takes no account of whether a man be broken, but seeketh to do
honour to the King's Highness and to render justice.'</p>
<p>Viridus and Sadler, who was another of Cromwell's secretaries,
had come in whilst Privy Seal had been speaking, and Cromwell
turned upon them laughing as the knight went out, his head
hanging.</p>
<p>'Here is another broken man,' he said, and they all laughed
together.</p>
<p>'Well, he is another very notable swordsman,' Viridus said.
'We might well post him at Milan, lest Pole flee back to Rome
that way.'</p>
<p>Cromwell turned upon the Chancellor with a bitter
contempt.</p>
<p>'Find thou for this knight some monk's lands in Kent. He shall
to Milan with them for a price.'</p>
<p>Viridus laughed.</p>
<p>'Now we shall soon have these broken swordsmen in every town
of Italy between France and Rome. Such a net Pole shall not
easily break through.'</p>
<p>'It were well he were done with soon,' Cromwell said.</p>
<p>'The King shall love us much the more; and it is time.'</p>
<p>'Why, there will in two days be such a clamour of assassins in
Paris that he shall soon bolt from there towards Rome,' Viridus
answered. 'It will go hard if he escape all our Italy men. I hold
it for certain that Winchester shall have reported to him in
Paris that this Culpepper is on the road. Will you speak with
this Howard wench?'</p>
<p>Cromwell knitted his brows in uncertainty.</p>
<p>'It was her cousin that should clamour about this murder in
Paris,' Viridus reminded him.</p>
<p>'Is she without?' Cromwell asked. 'Have you it for certain
that she hath reported to my lord of Winchester?'</p>
<p>'Winchester's priest of the bedchamber hath shewn me a copy of
the letter she wrote. I would have your lordship send some reward
to that Father Michael. He hath served us in many other
matters.'</p>
<p>Cromwell motioned with his hand that Sadler should note down
this Father Michael's name.</p>
<p>'Are there many men in my antechambers?' he asked Viridus, and
hearing that there were more than one hundred and fifty: 'Why,
let this wench stay there a half-hour. It humbles a woman to be
alone among so many men, and she shall come here without a sound
clout to her back for the crush of them.'</p>
<p>He began talking with Sadler about two globes of the world
that he had ordered his agent to buy in Antwerp, one for himself
and the other for a present to the King. Sadler answered that the
price was very high; a thousand crowns or so, he had forgotten
just how many. They had been twelve years in the making, but the
agent had been afraid of the greatness of the expense.</p>
<p>Cromwell said:</p>
<p>'Tush; I must have the best of these Flemish furnishings.'</p>
<p>He signed to Viridus to send for Katharine Howard, and went on
talking with Sadler about the furnishing of his house in the
Austin Friars. He had his agents all over Flanders watching the
noted masters of the crafts to see what notable pieces they might
turn out; for he loved fine carvings, noble hangings, great
worked chests and other signs of wealth, and the money was never
thrown away, for the wood and the stuffs and the gold thread
remained so long as you kept the moth and the woodlouse from
them. To the King too he gave presents every day.</p>
<p>Katharine entered by a door from a corridor at which he had
not expected her. She wore a great head-dress of net like the
Queen's and her dress was in no disarray, neither were her cheeks
flushed by anything more than apprehension. She said that she had
been shown that way by a large gentleman with a great beard. She
would not bring herself to mention the name of Throckmorton, so
much she detested him.</p>
<p>Cromwell answered with a benevolent smile, 'Aye, Throckmorton
had ever an eye for beauty. Otherwise you had come scurvily out
of that wash.'</p>
<p>He twisted his mouth up as if he were mocking her, and asked
her suddenly how the Lady Mary corresponded with her cousin the
Emperor, for it was certain she had a means of writing to
him?</p>
<p>Katharine flushed all over her face with relief and her heart
stilled itself a little. Here at least there was no talk of the
Tower at once for her, because she had written a letter to Bishop
Gardiner. She answered that that day for the first time she had
been in the Lady Mary's service.</p>
<p>He smiled benevolently still, and holding out a hand in a
little warning gesture and with an air of pleasant
reasonableness, said that she must earn her bread like other
folks in his Highness' service.</p>
<p>'Why,' she answered, 'I have been marvellous ill, but I shall
be more diligent in serving my mistress.'</p>
<p>He marked a distinction, pointing a fat finger at her
heart-place. In the serving of her mistress she should do not
enough work to pay for bodkins nor for sewing silk, since the
Lady Mary asked nothing of her maids, neither their attendance,
their converse, nor yet their needlework. Such a place asked
nothing of one so fortunate as to fill it. To atone for it the
service of the King demanded her labours.</p>
<p>'Why,' she said again, 'if I must spy in those parts it is a
great pity that I ever came there as your woman; for who there
shall open their hearts to me?'</p>
<p>He laughed at her comfortably still.</p>
<p>'You may put it about that you hate me,' he said. 'You may mix
with them that love me not. In the end you may worm yourself into
their secrets.'</p>
<p>Again a heavy flush covered Katharine's face from the chin to
the brow. It was so difficult for her to keep from speaking her
mind with her lips that she felt as if her whole face must be
telling the truth to him. But he continued to shake his plump
sides as if he were uttering inaudible,
'Ho&mdash;ho&mdash;ho's.'</p>
<p>'That is so easy,' he said. 'A child, I think, could compass
it.' He put his hands behind his back and stretched his legs
apart. She was very pleasant to look at with her flushings, and
it amused him to toy with frightened women. 'It is in this way
that you shall earn his Highness' bread.' It was known that Mary
had this treasonable correspondence with the Emperor; in the
devilish malignancy of her heart she desired that her sacred
father should be cast down and slain, and continually she
implored her cousin to invade her father's dominions, she sending
him maps, plans of the new castles in building and the names of
such as were malevolent within the realm. 'Therefore,' he
finished, 'if you could discover her channels and those channels
could then be stopped up, you would indeed both earn your bread
and enter into high favour.'</p>
<p>He began again good-humouredly to give her careful directions
as to how she should act; as for instance by offering to make for
the printers a fair copy of the Lady Mary's Commentary upon
Plautus. By pretending that certain words were obscure to her,
she should find opportunities for coming suddenly into the room,
and she should afford herself excuses for searching among his
mistress's papers without awakening suspicions.</p>
<p>'Why, my face is too ingenuous,' Katharine said. 'I am not
made for playing the spy.'</p>
<p>He laughed at her.</p>
<p>'That is so much the better,' he said. 'The best spies are
those that have open countenances. It needs but a little
schooling.'</p>
<p>'I should get me a hang-dog look very soon,' she answered. She
paused for a minute and then spoke earnestly, holding out her
hands. 'I would you would set me a nobler task. Very surely it is
shameful that a daughter should so hate the father that begat
her; and I know the angels weep to see her desire that the great
and noble prince should be cast down and slain by his enemies.
But, sir, it were the better task to seek to soften her mind.
Such knowledge as I have of goodly writers should aid me rather
to persuade her heart towards her father; for I know no texts
that should make me skilful as a spy, but I can give you a dozen
from Plautus alone that do inculcate a sweet and dutiful love
from daughter to sire.'</p>
<p>He leered at her pleasantly.</p>
<p>'Why, you speak sweetly, by the book. If the Lady Mary were a
man now...'</p>
<p>The hitherto silent men laid back their heads to laugh, and
the Chancellor of the Augmentations suddenly rubbed his palms
together, hissing like an ostler. But, seeing her look became
angry and abashed, Cromwell stopped his sentence and once more
held out a finger.</p>
<p>'Why, indeed,' he said, gravely, 'if you could do that you
might be the first lady in the land, for neither the King nor I,
nor yet all nor many have availed there.'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'Surely there is a way to touch the heart of this noble lady,
and by long seeking I may find.'</p>
<p>'Well, you have spoken many words,' Cromwell said. 'This is a
great matter. If you shall achieve it, it shall be accounted to
you both here and in heaven. But the other task I enjoin upon
you.'</p>
<p>She was making sorrowfully to the door, and he called to
her:</p>
<p>'I have found your cousin employment.'</p>
<p>The sudden mention made her stop as if she had been struck in
the face, and she held her hand to her side. Her face was
distorted with fear as she turned to answer:</p>
<p>'Aye. I knew. He hath told me. But I cannot thank you. I would
not that my cousin should murder a prince of the Church.' She
knew, from the feeling in her heart and the cruel sound of his
voice that he had that knowledge already. If he wished to
imprison her it could serve no turn to fence about that matter,
and she steadied herself by catching hold of the tapestry with
one hand behind her back. The faces of Cromwell's three
assistants were upon her, hard, sardonic and grinning.</p>
<p>Viridus said, with an air of parade:</p>
<p>'I had told your lordship this lady had flaws in her loyalty.'
And the Chancellor was raising his hands in horror, after the
fashion of a Greek Chorus. Cromwell, however, grinned still at
her.</p>
<p>'When the Queen Katharine died,' he said slowly, 'it was a
great relief to this realm. When the late Arch Devil, Pope
Clement, died, the King and I were mad with joy. But if all popes
and all hostile queens and princes could be stricken with devils
and dead to-morrow, his Highness would rather it were Reginald
Pole.'</p>
<p>Katharine understood very well that he was setting before her
the enormity of her offence: she stood still with her lips
parted. He went on rehearsing the crimes of the cardinal: how he
had been educated by the King's high bounty: how the King had
offered him the Archbishopric of York: how he had the rather fled
to the Bishop of Rome: how he had written a book, accusing the
King of such crimes and heresies that all Christendom had cried
out upon his Highness. Even then this Pole was in Paris with a
bull from the Bishop of Rome calling upon the Emperor and the
King of France to fall together upon their lord.</p>
<p>Katharine gasped:</p>
<p>'I would well he were dead. But not by my cousin. They should
take my cousin and slay him.'</p>
<p>Cromwell had arranged this scene very carefully: for his power
over the King fell away daily, and that day he had had to tell
Baumbach, the Saxish ambassador, that there was no longer any
hope of the King's allying himself with the Schmalkaldner league.
Therefore he was the more hot to discover a new Papist treason.
The suggestion of Viridus that Katharine might be made either to
discover or to invent one had filled him with satisfaction. There
was no one who could be more believed if she could be ground down
into swearing away the life of her uncle or any other man of high
station. And to grind her down thus needed only many threats. He
infused gradually more terror into his narrow eyes, and spoke
more gravely:</p>
<p>'Neither do I desire the death of this traitor so hotly as
doth his Highness. For there be these foul lies&mdash;and have
you not heard the ancient fool's prophecy that was made over
thirty years ago: "That one with a Red Cap brought up from low
degree should rule all the land under the King. (I trow ye know
who that was.) And that after much mixing the land should by
another Red Cap be reconciled or else brought to utter
ruin"?'</p>
<p>'I am new to this place,' Katharine said; 'I never heard that
saying. God help me, I wish this man were dead.'</p>
<p>His voice grew the more deep as he saw that she was the more
daunted:</p>
<p>'Aye: and whether the land be reconciled to the Bishop of
Rome, or be brought to utter ruin, the one and the other signify
the downfall of his Highness.'</p>
<p>The Chancellor interrupted piously:</p>
<p>'God save us. Whither should we all flee then!'</p>
<p>'It is not,' Viridus commented dryly, 'that his Highness or my
lord here do fear a fool prophecy made by a drunken man. But
there being such a prophecy running up and down the land, and
such a malignant and devilish Red Cap ranting up and down the
world, the hearts of foolish subjects are made to turn.'</p>
<p>'Idiot wench,' the Chancellor suddenly yelped at her,
'ignorant, naughty harlot! You had better have died than have
uttered those your pretty words.'</p>
<p>'Why,' Cromwell said gently, 'I am very sure that now you
desire that your cousin should slay this traitor.' He paused,
licked his lips and held out a hand. 'Upon your life,' he barked,
'tell no soul this secret.'</p>
<p>The faces of all the four men were again upon her, sardonic,
leering and amused, and suddenly she felt that this was not the
end of the matter: there was something untrue in this parade of
threats. Cromwell was acting: they were all acting parts. Their
speeches were all too long, too dryly spoken: they had been
rehearsed! This was not the end of the matter&mdash;and neither
her cousin nor Cardinal Pole was here the main point. She
wondered for a wild moment if Cromwell, too, like Gardiner,
thought that she had a voice with the King. But Cromwell knew as
well as she that the King had seen her but once for a minute, and
he was not a fool like Gardiner to run his nose into a mare's
nest.</p>
<p>'There is no power upon earth could save you from your doom if
through you this matter miscarried,' he said, softly: 'therefore,
be you very careful: act as I would have you act: seek out that
secret that I would know.'</p>
<p>It came irresistibly into Katharine's head:</p>
<p>'These men know already very well that I have written to
Bishop Gardiner! This is to hold a halter continuously above my
head!' Then, at least, they did not mean to do away with her
instantly. She dropped her eyes upon the ground and stood
submissively whilst Privy Seal's voice came cruel and level:</p>
<p>'You are a very fair wench, made for love and such stuff. You
are an indifferent good Latinist who might offer good counsel.
But be you very careful that you come not against me. You should
not escape, but may burrow underground sooner than that. Your
Aristotle should not help you, nor Lucretius, nor Lucan, nor
Silius Italicus. Diodorus Siculus hath no maxim that should help
you against me; but, like Diodorus the Dialectician, you should
die of shame. Seneca shall help you if you but dally with that
fool thought who sayeth: "<i>Quaeris quo jaceas post obitum loco?
Quo non nata jacent.</i>" Aye, thou shalt die and lie in an
unknown grave as thou hadst never been born.'</p>
<p>She went, her knees trembling half with fear and half with
rage, for it was impossible to imagine anything more threatening
or more arrogant than his soft, cruel voice, that seemed to sound
for long after in her ears, saying, 'I have you at my mercy; see
you do as I have bidden you.'</p>
<p>Watching the door that closed upon her, Viridus said, with a
negligent amusement:</p>
<p>'That fool Udal hath set it all about that your lordship
designed her for the recreation of his Highness.'</p>
<p>'Why,' Cromwell answered, with his motionless smile of
contempt for his fellow men, 'it is well to offer bribes to fools
and threats to knaves.'</p>
<p>The Chancellor bleated, with amazed adulation, 'Marvel that
your lordship should give so much care to such a worthless
rag!'</p>
<p>'An I had never put my heart into trifles, I had never stood
here,' Cromwell snarled at him. 'Would that my knaves would ever
come to learn that!' He spoke again to Viridus: 'See that this
wench come never near his Highness. I like not her
complexion.'</p>
<p>'Well, we may clap her up at any moment,' his man
answered.</p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>The King came to the revels at the Bishop of Winchester's, for
these too were given in honour of the Queen, and he had altered
in his mind to let the Emperor and Francis know that he was
inclined to weaken in his new alliances. Besides, there was the
newest suitor for the hand of the Lady Mary, the young Duke
Philip of Wittelsbach, who must be shown how great were the
resources of the land. Young, gay, dark, a famous warrior and a
good Catholic, he sat behind the Queen and speaking German of a
sort he made her smile at times. The play was the <i>Menechmi</i>
of Plautus, and Duke Philip interpreted it to her. She seemed at
times so nearly human that the King, glancing back over his
shoulder to note whether she disgraced him, could settle down
into his chair and rest both his back and his misgivings. Seeing
the frown leave his brow all the courtiers grew glad behind him;
Cromwell talked with animation to Baumbach, the ambassador from
the Schmalkaldner league, since he had not seen the King so gay
for many days, and Gardiner in his bishop's robes smiled with a
black pleasure because his feast was so much more prosperous than
Privy Seal's had been. There was no one there of the Lady Mary's
household, because it was not seemly that she should be where her
suitor was before he had been presented to her.</p>
<p>The large hall was lit with tapers at dusk and hung with ivy
and with holly; dried woodruff, watermint and other sweet herbs
were scattered about the floors to give an agreeable odour; the
antlers of deer from the bishop's chase in Winchester were like a
forest of dead boughs, branching from the walls, some gilded,
some silvered, some supporting shields emblazoned with the arms
of the See, of the bishop, of the King or of Cleves; an army of
wood-pigeons and stock-doves with silver collars about their
necks was at one time let fly into the hall, and the swish of
their wings and afterwards their cooing among the golden rafters
of the high ceiling made pleasing sound and mingled with the
voices of sweet singing from the galleries at each end of the
hall, near the roof. The players spoke their parts bravely, and,
because this play was beloved among all others at the Court,
there was a great and general contentment.</p>
<p>For the after scene they had a display of theology. There were
three battles of men. In black with red hats, horns branching
above them and in the centre a great devil with a triple tiara,
who danced holding up an enormous key. These stood on the right.
On the left were priests in fustian, holding enormous flagons of
Rhenish wine and dancing in a drunken measure with their arms
round more drunken doxies dressed like German women. In the
centre stood grave and reverend men wearing horsehair beards and
the long gowns of English bishops and priests. Before these there
knelt an angel in flame-coloured robes with wings like the
rainbow. The angel supported a great volume on the back of which
might be read in letters of gold, '<i>Regis Nostri
Sapientia.</i>'</p>
<p>The great devil, dancing forward, brandishing his key, roared
that these reverend men should kneel to him; he held out a cloven
foot and bade them kiss it. But a venerable bishop cried out,
'You be Antichrist. I know you. You be the Arch Devil. But from
this book I will confound you. Thank God that we have one that
leads us aright.' Coming forward he read in Latin from the book
of the King's Wisdom and the great devil fell back fainting into
the arms of the men in red hats.</p>
<p>The King called out, 'By God, goodman Bishop, you have spoken
well!' and the Court roared.</p>
<p>Then one from the other side danced out, holding his flagon
and grasping his fat wife round the waist. He sang in a gross and
German way, smacking his lips, that these reverend Englishmen
should leave their godly ways and come down among the Lutherans.
But the old bishop cried out, 'Ay, Dr Martinus, I know thee; thou
despisest the Body of God; thou art a fornicator. God forbid that
our English priests should go among women as ye do. Listen to
wisdom. For, thank God, we have one to lead us aright!'</p>
<p>These words spread a sudden shiver into the hall, for no man
there knew whether the King had commanded them to be uttered. The
King sat back in his chair, half frowning; Anne blinked, Philip
of Wittelsbach laughed aloud, the Catholic ambassadors, Chapuys
and Marillac, who had fidgeted in their seats as if they would
leave the hall, now leant forward.</p>
<p>'Aye,' the player bishop called out, 'our goodly Queen cometh
from a Court that was never yet joined to your Schmalkaldners,
nor to them that go by your name, Dr Martinus, thou lecher. Here
in England you shall find no heresies but the pure and purged
Word of God.'</p>
<p>Chapuys bent an aged white hand behind his ear to miss no
word: his true and smiling face blinked benevolently. Cromwell
smiled too, licking his lips dangerously; Baumbach, the
Schmalkaldner, understanding nothing, rolled his German blue eyes
in his great head like a pink baby's, and tried to catch the
attention of Cromwell, who talked over his shoulder to one of his
men. But the many Lutherans that there were in the hall scowled
at the floor.</p>
<p>The player bishop was reading thunderous words of the King,
written many years before, against married priests. Henry sat
back in his round chair, grasping the arms with his enormous
hands.</p>
<p>'Why, Master Bishop,' he called out. The player stopped his
reading and looked at the King, his air of austerity never
leaving him. Henry, however, waved his hand and said no more.</p>
<p>This dreadful incident caused a confusion in the players: they
faltered: the player Lutheran slunk back to his place with his
wife, and all of them stood with their hands hanging down. They
consulted among themselves and at last filed out from the room,
leaving the stage for some empty minutes bare and menacing. Men
held their breath: the King was seen to be frowning. But a quick
music was played from the galleries and a door opened behind.
There came in many figures in white to symbolify the deities of
ancient Greece and Rome, and, in black, with ashes upon her head,
there was Ceres lamenting that Persephone had been carried into
the realms of Pluto. No green thing should blow nor grow upon
this earth, she wailed in a deep and full voice, until again her
daughter trod there. The other deities covered their heads with
their white skirts.</p>
<p>No one heeded this show very much in the hall, for the
whispers over what had gone before never subsided again that day.
Men turned their backs upon the stage in order to talk with
others behind them, and it was generally agreed that if this
refurbishing of old doctrines were no more than a bold stroke of
Bishop Gardiner's, Henry at least had not scowled very harshly
upon it. So that, for the most part, they thought that the Old
Faith might come back again; whilst others suddenly remembered,
much more clearly than before, that Cleves was a principality not
truly Lutheran, and that the marriage with Anne had not tied them
at all to the Schmalkaldner's league. Therefore this shadow of
the old ways caused new uneasiness, for there was hardly any man
there that had not some of the monastery lands.</p>
<p>The King was the man least moved in the hall: he listened to
the lamentations of Mother Ceres and gazed at a number of naked
boys who issued suddenly from the open door. They spread green
herbs in a path from the door to the very feet of Anne, who
blinked at them in amazement, and they paid no heed to Mother
Ceres, who asked indignantly how any green thing could grow upon
the earth that she had bidden lie barren till her daughter came
again.</p>
<p>Persephone stood framed in the doorway: she was all in white,
very slim and tall; in among her hair she had a wreath of green
Egyptian stones called feridets, of which many remained in the
treasuries of Winchester, because they were soft and of so little
value that the visitors of the monasteries had left them there.
And she had these green feridets, cut like leaves, worked into
the white lawn, over her breasts. In her left arm there lay a
cornucopia filled with gold coins, and in her right a silver
coronet of olive leaves. She moved in a slow measure to the
music, bending her knees to right and to left, and drawing her
long dress into white lines and curves, until she stood in the
centre of the green path. She smiled patiently and with a rapt
expression as if she had come out of a dream. The wreath of olive
leaves, she said, the gods sent to their most virtuous, most
beauteous Queen, who had brought peace in England; the cornucopia
filled with gold was the offering of Plutus to the noble and
benevolent King of these parts. Her words could hardly be heard
for the voices of the theologians in the hall before her.</p>
<p>Henry suddenly turned back, lifted his hand, and shouted:</p>
<p>'Be silent!'</p>
<p>Persephone's voice became very audible in the midst of the
terrified hush of all these people, who feared their enormous
King as if he were a wild beast that at one moment you could play
with and the next struck you dead.</p>
<p>'&mdash;How happy is England among the nations!' The voice
rang out clear and fluting like a boy's. 'Her people how free and
bold! Her laws how gentle and beneficent, her nobles how
courteous and sweet in their communings together for the public
weal! How thrice happy that land when peace is upon the earth!
Her women how virtuous, her husbandmen how satiated, her cattle
how they let down their milk!'&mdash;She swayed round to the gods
that were uncovering their heads behind her: 'Aye, my masters and
fellow godheads: woe is me that we knew never this happy and
contented country. Better it had been there to dwell than upon
high Olympus: better than in the Cyclades: better than in the
Islands of the Blest that hide amid the Bermoothean tempest. Woe
is me!' Her expression grew more rapt; she paused as if she had
lost the thread of the words and then spoke again, gazing far out
over the hall as jugglers do in performing feats of balancing:
'For surely we had been more safe than reigning alone above the
clouds had we lived here, the veriest hinds, beneath a King that
is five times blessed, in that he is most wealthy and generous of
rewards, most noble of courage, most eloquent, most learned in
the law of men, and most high interpreter of the law of God!'</p>
<p>Seeing that the King smiled, as though he had received a just
panegyric, a great clamour of applause went up in the hall, and
swaying beneath the weight of the cornucopia she came to the King
over the path of green herbs and boughs. Henry reached out his
hands, himself, to take his present, smiling and genial; and that
alone was a sign of great favour, for by rights she should have
knelt with it, offered it and then receded, giving it into the
arms of a serving man. She passed on, and would have crowned the
Queen with the silver wreath; but the great hood that Anne wore
stood in the way, therefore she laid it in the Queen's lap.</p>
<p>Henry caught at her hanging sleeve.</p>
<p>'That was a gay fine speech,' he said. 'I will have it
printed.'</p>
<p>Little ripples of fear and coldness ran over her, for her
dress was thin and her arms bared between the loops above. Her
eyes roved round upon the people as if, tall and white, she were
a Christian virgin in the agonies of martyrdom. She tried to pull
her sleeve from between his great fingers, and she whispered in a
sort of terror:</p>
<p>'You stay the masque!'</p>
<p>He lay back in his chair, laughing so that his grey beard
shook.</p>
<p>'Why, thou art a pert baggage,' he said. 'I could stay their
singing for good an I would.'</p>
<p>He looked her up and down, commanding and good-humouredly
malicious. She put her hand to her throat as if it throbbed, and
uttered with a calmness of desperation:</p>
<p>'That were great pity. They have practised much, and their
breaths are passable sweet.'</p>
<p>The godheads with their beards of tow, their lyres and
thunderbolts all gilt, stood in an awkward crescent, their music
having stopped. Henry laughed at them.</p>
<p>'I know thy face,' he said. 'It would be less than a king to
forget it.'</p>
<p>'I am Katharine Howard,' she faltered, stretching out her
hands beseechingly. 'Let me go back to my place.'</p>
<p>'Oh, aye!' he answered. 'But thou'st shed thy rags since I saw
thee on a mule.' He loosed her sleeve. 'Let the good men sing, 'a
God's name.'</p>
<p>In her relief to be free she stumbled on the sweet herbs.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a dark night into which they went out from the bishop's
palace. Cressets flared on his river steps, and there were
torches down the long garden for those who went away by road.
Because there would be a great crowd of embarkers at the bishop's
landing place, so that there might be many hours to wait until
their barge should come, Katharine, by the office of old Sir
Nicholas, had made a compact with some of the maids of honour of
the Lady Elizabeth; a barge was to wait for them at the Cross
Keys, a common stage some ten minutes down the river. Katharine,
laughing, gay with relief and gladdened with words of praise,
held Margot's hand tight and kept her fingers on Sir Nicholas'
sleeve. It was raining a fine drizzle, so that the air of the
gardens smelt moist even against the odour of the torches. The
old knight pulled the hood of his gown up over his head, for he
was hoarse with a heavy cold. It was pitch black beyond the gate
house; in the open fields before the wall torches here and there
appeared to burn in mid-air, showing beneath them the heads and
the hoods of their bearers hurrying home, and, where they turned
to the right along a narrow lane, a torch showed far ahead above
a crowd packed thick between dark house-fronts and gables. They
glistened with wet and sent down from their gutters spouts of
water that gleamed, catching the light of the torch, like threads
of opal fire on the pallid dove colour of the towering
house-fronts. The torch went round a corner, its light withdrew
along the walls by long jumps as its bearer stepped into the
distance ahead. Then it was all black. Walking was difficult over
the immense cobbles of the roadway, but in the pack of the crowd
it was impossible to fall, for people held one another. But it
was also impossible to speak, and, muffling her face in her hood,
Katharine walked smiling and squeezing Margot's hand out of pure
pleasure with the world that was so fair in the midst of this
blackness and this heavy cold.</p>
<p>There was a swishing repeated three times and three thuds and
twists of white on heads and shoulders just before her.
Undistinguishable yells of mockery dwindled down from high above,
and a rush-light shone at an immense elevation illuminating a
faint square of casement that might have been in the heavens.
Three apprentices had thrown down paper bags of powdered chalk.
The men who had been struck, and several others who had been
maltreated on former nights, or who resented this continual
'prentice scandal, began a frightful outcry at the door of the
house. More bags came bursting down and foul water; the yells and
battlecries rolled, in the narrow space under the house-fronts
that nearly kissed each other high overhead, and the crowd,
brought to a standstill, swayed and pushed against the walls.
Katharine lost her hold of the old knight's sleeve, and she could
see no single thing. She felt round her in the blackness for his
arm, but a heavy man stumbled against her. Suddenly his hand was
under her arm, drawing her a little; his voice seemed to say:
'Down this gully is a way about.'</p>
<p>In the passage it was blacker than the mouth of hell, and her
eyes still seemed to have in them the dazzle of light and triumph
she had just left. There was a frightful stench of garbage; and
it appeared to be a vault, because the outcry of the men
besieging the door volleyed and echoed the more thunderously.
There came the sharp click of a latch and Katharine found herself
impelled to descend several steps into a blackness from which
came up a breath of closer air and a smell of rotting straw. Fear
suddenly seized upon her, and the conviction that another man had
taken the place of the old knight during the scuffle. But a heavy
pressure of an arm was suddenly round her waist, and she was
forced forward. She caught a shriek from Margot; the girl's hand
was torn from her own; a door slammed behind, and there was a
deep silence in which the heavy breathing of a man became
audible.</p>
<p>'If you cry out,' a soft voice said, 'I will let you go. But
probably you will lose your life.'</p>
<p>She had not a breath at all in her, but she gasped:</p>
<p>'Will you do a rape?' and fumbled in her pocket for her
crucifix. Her voice came back to her, muffled and close, so that
she was in a very small cellar.</p>
<p>'When you have seen my face, you may love me,' came to her
ears in an inane voice. 'I would you might, for you have a goodly
mouth for kisses.'</p>
<p>She breathed heavily; the click of the beads on her cross
filled the silence. She fitted the bar of the crucifix to her
knuckles and felt her breath come calmer. For, if the man struck
a light she could strike him in the face with the metal of her
cross, held in the fist; she could blind him if she hit an eye.
She stepped back a little and felt behind her the damp stone of a
wall. The soft voice uttered more loudly:</p>
<p>'I offer you a present of great price; I can solve your
perplexities.' Katharine breathed between her teeth and said
nothing. 'But if you draw a knife,' the voice went on, 'I will
set you loose; there are as good as Madam Howard.' On the door
there came the sound of soft thuds. 'That is your maid, Margot
Poins,' the voice said. 'You had better bid her begone. This is a
very evil gully; she will be strangled.'</p>
<p>Katharine called:</p>
<p>'Go and fetch some one to break down this door.'</p>
<p>The voice commented:</p>
<p>'In the City she will find none to enter this gully; it is a
sanctuary of outlaws.'</p>
<p>There was the faintest glimmer of a casement square, high up
before Katharine; violence and carryings off were things familiar
to her imagination. A hundred men might have desired her whilst
she stood on high in the masque. She said hotly:</p>
<p>'If you will hold me here for a ransom, you will find none to
pay it.'</p>
<p>She heard the soft hiss of a laugh, and the voice:</p>
<p>'I would myself pay more than other men, but I would have no
man see us together.'</p>
<p>She shrank into herself, and held to the wall for comfort. She
heard a click, and in the light of a shower of brilliant sparks
was the phantom of a man's beard and dim walls; one tiny red glow
remained in the tinder, like an illuminant in a black
nothingness. He seemed to hold it about breast-high and to
pause.</p>
<p>'You had best be rid of Margot Poins,' the musing voice came
out of the thick air. 'Send her back to her mother's people: she
gets you no friends.'</p>
<p>Katharine wondered if she might strike about eighteen inches
above the tiny spark: or if in these impenetrable shadows there
were a very tall man.</p>
<p>'Your Margot's folk miscall you in shameful terms. I would be
your servant; but it is distasteful to a proper man to serve one
that hath about her an atmosphere of lewdness.'</p>
<p>Katharine cursed at him to relieve the agony of her fear.</p>
<p>The voice answered composedly:</p>
<p>'One greater than the devil is my master. But it is good
hearing that you are loyal to them that serve you: so you shall
be loyal to me, for I will serve you well.'</p>
<p>The spark in the tinder moved upwards; the man began to blow
on it; in the dim glimmer there appeared red lips, a hairy
moustache, a straight nose, gleaming eyes that looked across the
flame, a high narrow forehead, and the gleam of a jewel in a
black cap. This glowing and dusky face appeared to hang in the
air. Katharine shrank with despair and loathing: she had seen
enough to know the man. She made a swift step towards it, her arm
drawn back; but the glow of the box moved to one side, the ashes
faded: there was already nothing before she could strike.</p>
<p>'You see I am Throckmorton: a goodly knight,' the voice said,
laughing.</p>
<p>This man came from Lincolnshire, near her own home. He had
been the brother of a gentleman who had a very small property,
and he had had one sister. God alone knew for what crime his
father had cursed Throckmorton and left his patrimony to the
monks at Ely&mdash;but his sister had hanged herself.
Throckmorton had disappeared.</p>
<p>In that black darkness she had seemed to feel his gloating
over her helplessness, and his laughing over all the villainies
of his hateful past. He was so loathsome to her that merely to be
near him had made her tremble when, the day before, he had fawned
over her and shown her the side door to Privy Seal's room. Now
the sound of his breathing took away all her power to breathe.
She panted:</p>
<p>'Infamous dog, I will have you shortened by the head for this
rape.'</p>
<p>'It is true I am a fool to play cat and mouse,' he answered.
'But I was ever thus from a child: I have played silly pranks:
listen to gravity. I bring you here because I would speak to you
where no ear dare come to listen: this is a sanctuary of night
robbers.' His voice took on fantastically and grotesquely the
nasal tones of Doctors of Logic when they discuss abstract
theses: 'I am a bold man to dare come here; but some of these are
in my pay. Nevertheless I am a bold man, though indeed the step
from life into death is so short and so easily passed that a man
is a fool to fear it. Nevertheless some do fear it; therefore, as
men go, I am bold; tho', since I set much store in the
intervention of the saints on my behalf, may be I am not so bold.
Yet I am a good man, or the saints would not protect me. On the
other hand, I am fain to do their work for them: so may be, they
would protect me whether I were virtuous or no. Maybe they would
not, however: for it is a point still disputed as to whether a
saint might use an evil tool to do good work. But, in short, I am
here to tell you what Privy Seal would have of you.'</p>
<p>'God help the pair of you,' Katharine said. 'Have ye descended
to cellar work now?'</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' the voice came, 'for what manner of man do you
take me? I am a very proper man that do love virtue. There are
few such philosophers as I since I came out of Italy.'</p>
<p>It was certain to her now that Privy Seal, having seen her
thick with the Bishop of Winchester, had delivered her into the
hands of this vulture. 'If you have a knife,' she said, 'put it
into me soon. God will look kindly on you and I would pardon you
half the crime.' She closed her eyes and began to pray.</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' he answered, in a lofty tone of aggrievement,
'the door is on the latch: the latch is at your hand to be found
for a little fumbling: get you gone if you will not trust
me.'</p>
<p>'Aye: you have cut-throats without,' Katharine said. She
prayed in silence to Mary and the saints to take her into the
kingdom of heaven with a short agony here below. Nevertheless,
she could not believe that she was to die: for being still young,
though death was always round her, she believed herself born to
be immortal.</p>
<p>The sweat was cold upon her face; but Throckmorton was
upbraiding her in a lofty nasal voice.</p>
<p>'I am an honourable knight,' he cried, in his affected and
shocked tones. 'If I have undone men, it was for love of the
republic. I have nipped many treasons in the bud. The land is
safe for a true man, because of my work.'</p>
<p>'You are a werewolf,' she shuddered; 'you eat your
brother.'</p>
<p>'Why, enough of this talk,' he answered. 'I offer you a
service, will you take it? I am the son of a gentleman: I love
wisdom for that she alone is good. Virtue I love for virtue's
sake, and I serve my King. What more goeth to the making of a
proper man? You cannot tell me.'</p>
<p>His voice changed suddenly:</p>
<p>'If you do hate a villain, now is the time to prove it. Would
you have him down? Then tell your gossip Winchester that the time
approaches to strike, and that I am ready to serve him. I have
done some good work for the King's Highness through Privy Seal.
But my nose is a good one. I begin to smell out that Privy Seal
worketh treasonably.'</p>
<p>'You are a mad fool to think to trick me,' Katharine said.
'Neither you nor I, nor any man, believes that Privy Seal would
work a treason. You would trick me into some foolish utterances.
It needed not a cellar in a cut-throat's gully for that.'</p>
<p>'Madam Spitfire,' his voice answered, 'you are a true woman; I
a true man. We may walk well together. Before the Most High God I
wish you no ill.'</p>
<p>'Then let me go,' she cried. 'Tell me your lies some other
where.'</p>
<p>'The latch is near your hand still,' he said. 'But I will
speak to you no other where. It is only here in the abode of
murder and evil men that in these evil times a man may speak his
mind and fear no listener.'</p>
<p>She felt tremulously for the latch; it gave, and its rattling
set her heart on the jump. When she pulled the door ajar she
heard voices in the distant street. It rushed through her mind
that he was set neither on murder nor unspeakable things. Or,
indeed, he had cut-throats waiting to brain her on the top step.
She said tremulously:</p>
<p>'Tell me what you will with me in haste!'</p>
<p>'Why, I have bidden your barge fellows wait for you,' he
answered. 'Till cock-crow if need were. They shall not leave you.
They fear me too much. Shut the door again, for you dread me no
more.'</p>
<p>Her knees felt suddenly limp and she clung to the latch for
support; she believed that Mary had turned the heart of this
villain. He repeated that he smelt treason working in the mind of
an evil man, and that he would have her tell the Bishop of
Winchester.</p>
<p>'I did bring you here, for it is the quickest way. I came to
you for I saw that you were neither craven nor fool: nor high
placed so that it would be dangerous to be seen talking with you
later, when you understood my good will. And I am drawn towards
you since you come from near my home.'</p>
<p>Katharine said hurriedly, between her prayers:</p>
<p>'What will you of me? No man cometh to a woman without seeking
something from her.'</p>
<p>'Why, I would have you look favourably upon me,' he answered.
'I am a goodly man.'</p>
<p>'I am meat for your masters,' she answered with bitter
contempt. 'You have the blood of my kin on your hands.'</p>
<p>He sighed, half mockingly.</p>
<p>'If you will not give me your favours,' he said in a low,
laughing voice, 'I would have you remember me according as my aid
is of advantage to you.'</p>
<p>'God help you,' she said; 'I believe now that you have it in
mind to betray your master.'</p>
<p>'I am a man that can be very helpful,' he answered, with his
laughing assurance that had always in it the ring of a sneer.
'Tell Bishop Gardiner again, that the hour approaches to strike
if these cowards will ever strike.'</p>
<p>Katharine felt her pulses beat more slowly.</p>
<p>'Sir,' she said, 'I tell you very plainly that I will not work
for the advancement of the Bishop of Winchester. He turned me
loose upon the street to-night after I had served him, with
neither guard to my feet nor bit to my mouth. If my side goes up,
he may go with it, but I love him not.'</p>
<p>'Why, then, devise with the Duke of Norfolk,' he answered
after a pause. 'Gardiner is a black rogue and your uncle a yellow
craven; but bid them join hands till the time comes for them to
cut each other's throats.'</p>
<p>'You are a foul dog to talk thus of noblemen,' she said.</p>
<p>He answered:</p>
<p>'Oh, la! You have little to thank your uncle for. What do you
want? Will you play for your own hand? Or will you partner those
two against the other?'</p>
<p>'I will never partner with a spy and a villain,' she cried
hotly.</p>
<p>He cried lightly:</p>
<p>'Oh&eacute;, Goosetherumfoodle! You will say differently
before long. If you will fight in a fight you must have tools.
Now you have none, and your situation is very parlous.'</p>
<p>'I stand on my legs, and no man can touch me,' she said
hotly.</p>
<p>'But two men can hang you to-morrow,' he answered. 'One man
you know; the other is the Sieur Gardiner. Cromwell hath
contrived that you should write a treasonable letter; Gardiner
holdeth that letter's self.'</p>
<p>Katharine braved her own sudden fears with:</p>
<p>'Men are not such villains.'</p>
<p>'They are as occasion makes them,' he answered, with his voice
of a philosopher. 'What manner of men these times breed you
should know if you be not a fool. It is very certain that
Gardiner will hang you, with that letter, if you work not into
his goodly hands. See how you stand in need of a counsellor. Now
you wish you had done otherwise.'</p>
<p>She said hotly:</p>
<p>'Never. So I would act again to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'Oh fool madam,' he answered. 'Your cousin's province was
never to come within a score miles of the cardinal. Being a
drunkard and a boaster he was sent to Paris to get drunk and to
boast.'</p>
<p>The horror of the blackness, the damp, the foul smell, and all
this treachery made her voice faint. She stammered:</p>
<p>'Shew me a light, or let the door be opened. I am sick.'</p>
<p>'Neither,' he answered. 'I am as much as you in peril. With a
light men may see in at the casement; with an open door they may
come eavesdropping. When you have been in this world as long as I
you will love black night as well.'</p>
<p>Her brain swam for a moment.</p>
<p>'My cousin was never in this plot against me,' she uttered
faintly.</p>
<p>He answered lightly:</p>
<p>'You may keep your faith in that toppet. Where you are a fool
is to have believed that Privy Seal, who is a wise man, or
Viridus, who is a philosopher after my heart, would have sent
such a sot and babbler on such a tickle errand.'</p>
<p>'He was sent!' protested Katharine.</p>
<p>'Aye, he was sent to blab about it in every tavern in Paris
town. He was sent to frighten the Red Cap out of Paris town. He
was suffered to blab to you that you might set your neck in a
noose and be driven to be a spy.'</p>
<p>His soft chuckle came through the darkness like an obscene
applause of a successful villainy; it was as if he were gloating
over her folly and the rectitude of her mind.</p>
<p>'Red Cap was working mischief in Paris&mdash;but Red Cap is
timorous. He will go post haste back to Rome, either because of
your letter or because of your cousin's boasting. But there are
real and secret murderers waiting for him in every town in Italy
on the road to Rome. Some are at Brescia, some at Rimini: at
Padua there is a man with his neck, like yours, in a noose. It is
a goodly contrivance.'</p>
<p>'You are a vile pack,' Katharine said, and once more the
smooth and unctuous sound came from his invisible throat.</p>
<p>'How shall you decide what is vileness, or where will you find
a virtuous man?' he asked. 'Maybe you will find some among the
bones of your old Romans. Yet your Seneca, in his day, did play
the villain. Or maybe some at the Court of Mahound. I know not,
for I was never there. But here is a goodly world, with prizes
for them that can take them. Yet virtue may still flourish, for I
have done middling well by serving my country. Now I am minded to
retire into my lands, to cultivate good letters and to pursue
virtue. For here about the Courts there are many distractions.
The times are evil times. Yet will I do one good stroke more
before I go.'</p>
<p>Katharine said hotly:</p>
<p>'If you go down into Lincolnshire, I will call upon every man
there to fall upon you and hang you.'</p>
<p>'Why,' he said, 'that is why I did come to you, since you are
from where my lands are. If I serve you, I would have you to
smooth my path there. I ask no more, for now I crave rest and a
private life. It is very assured that I should never find that
here or in few parts of the land&mdash;so well I have served my
King. Therefore, if I serve you, you and yours shall cast above
my retired farms and my honourable leisure the shadow of your
protection. I ask no more.' He chuckled almost inaudibly. 'I am
set to watch you,' he said. 'Viridus will go to Paris to catch
another traitor called Brancetor, for the world is full of
traitors. Therefore, in a way, it rests with me to hang you.'</p>
<p>He seemed to be seated upon a cask, for there was a creaking
of old wood, and he spoke very leisurely.</p>
<p>Katharine said, 'Good night, and God send you better
thoughts.'</p>
<p>'Why, stay, and I will be brief,' he pleaded. 'I dally because
it is sweet talking to a fair woman in a black place.'</p>
<p>'You are easily content, for all the sweet words you get from
me,' she scorned him.</p>
<p>'See you,' he said earnestly. 'It is true that I am set to
watch you. I love you because you are fair; I might bend you,
since I hold you in the hollow of my hand. But I am a continent
man, and there is here a greater stake to be had than any amorous
satisfaction. I would save my country from a man who has been a
friend, but is grown a villain. Listen.'</p>
<p>He appeared to pause to collect his words together.</p>
<p>'Baumbach, the Saxish ambassador, is here seeking to tack us
to the Schmalkaldner heresies. Yesterday he was with Privy Seal,
who loveth the Lutheran alliance. So Privy Seal takes him to his
house, and shows him his marvellous armoury, which is such that
no prince nor emperor hath elsewhere. So says Privy Seal to
Baumbach: "<i>I love your alliance; but his Highness will naught
of it.</i>" And he fetched a heavy sigh.'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'What is this hearsay to me?'</p>
<p>'He fetched a heavy sigh,' Throckmorton continued. 'And your
uncle or Gardiner knew how heavy a sigh it was their hearts would
be very glad.'</p>
<p>'This means that the King's Highness is very far from Privy
Seal?' Katharine asked.</p>
<p>'His Highness hateth to do business with small princelings.'
Throckmorton seemed to laugh at the King's name. 'His high and
princely stomach loveth only to deal with his equals, who are
great kings. I have seen the letters that have passed about this
Cleves wedding. Not one of them is from his Highness' hand. It is
Privy Seal alone that shall bear the weight of the blow when
rupture cometh.'</p>
<p>'Well, she is a foul slut,' Katharine said, and her heart was
full of sympathy for the heavy King.</p>
<p>'Nay, she is none such,' Throckmorton answered. 'If you look
upon her with an unjaundiced eye, she will pass for a Christian
to be kissed. It is not her body that his Highness hateth, but
her fathering. This is a very old quarrel betwixt him and Privy
Seal. His Highness hath been wont to see himself the arbiter of
the Christian world. Now Privy Seal hath made of him an ally of
German princelings. His Highness loveth the Old Faith and the old
royal ways. Now Privy Seal doth seek to make him take up the
faith of Schmalkaldners, who are a league of bakers and unfrocked
monks. Madam Howard, I tell you that if there were but one man
that could strike after the new Parliament is called
together...'</p>
<p>Katharine cried:</p>
<p>'The very stones that Cromwell hath soaked with blood will
rise to fall upon him when the King's feet no longer press them
down.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton laughed almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>'Norfolk feareth Gardiner for a spy; Gardiner feareth the
ambition of Norfolk; Bonner would sell them both to Privy Seal
for the price of an archbishopric. The King himself is loth to
strike, since no man in the land could get him together such
another truckling Parliament as can Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>He stopped speaking and let his words soak into her in the
darkness, and after a long pause her voice came back to her.</p>
<p>'It is true that I have heard no man speak as you do...I can
see that his dear Highness must be hatefully inclined to this
filthy alliance.'</p>
<p>'Why, you are minded to come into my hut with me,' he
chuckled. 'There are few men so clear in the head as I am. So
listen again to me. If you would strike at this man, it is of no
avail to meddle with him at home. It shall in no way help you to
clamour of good monks done to death, of honest men ruined, of
virgins thrown on to dung-heaps. The King hath had the pence of
these good monks, the lands of these honest men, and the golden
neck-collars off these virgins.'</p>
<p>She called out, 'Keep thy tongue off this sacred King's name.
I will listen to no more lewdness.'</p>
<p>A torch passing outside sent a moving square of light through
the high grating across the floor of the cellar. The damp walls
became dimly visible with shining snail-tracks on them, and his
great form leaning negligently upon a cask, his hand arrested in
the pulling of his long beard, his eyes gleaming upon her,
sardonic and amused. The light twisted round abruptly and was
gone.</p>
<p>'You are monstrous fair,' he said, and sighed. She
shuddered.</p>
<p>'No,' his mocking voice came again, 'speak not to the
King&mdash;not to whomsoever you shall elect to speak to the
King&mdash;of this man's work at home. The King shall let him go
very unwillingly, since no man can so pack a Parliament to do the
King's pleasure. And he hath a nose for treasons that his
Highness would give his own nose to possess.'</p>
<p>'Keep thy tongue off the King's name,' she said again.</p>
<p>He laughed, and continued pensively: 'A very pretty treason
might be made up of his speech before his armoury to Baumbach.
Mark again how it went. Says he: "<i>Here are such weaponings as
no king, nor prince, nor emperor hath in Christendom. And in this
country of ours are twenty gentlemen, my friends, have armouries
as great or greater.</i>" Then he sighs heavily, and saith:
"<i>But our King will never join with your Schmalkaldners. Yet I
would give my head that he should.</i>"... Your madamship marks
that this was said to the ambassador from the Lutheran
league?'</p>
<p>'You cannot twist that into a treason,' Katharine
whispered.</p>
<p>'No doubt,' he said reasonably, 'such words from a minister to
an envoy are but a courtesy, as one would say, "<i>I fain would
help you, but my master wills it not.</i>"'</p>
<p>The voice suddenly grew crafty. 'But these words, spoken
before an armoury and the matter of twenty gentlemen with
armouries greater. Say that these twenty are creatures of my Lord
Cromwell, <i>implicitur</i>, for the Lutheran cause. And again,
the matter, "<i>No king hath such an armoury.</i>"...<i>No</i>
king, I would have you observe.'</p>
<p>'Why, this is monstrous foolish pettifogging,' Katharine said.
'No king would believe a treason in such words.'</p>
<p>'I call to mind Gilmaw of Hurstleas, near our homes,' the
voice came, reflectively.</p>
<p>'I did know him,' said Katharine. 'You had his head.'</p>
<p>'You never heard how Privy Seal did that,' the voice came back
mockingly. 'Goodman Gilmaw had many sheep died of the rot because
it rained seven weeks on end. So, coming back from a market-day,
with too much ale for prudence and too little for silence, he
cried, "<i>Curse on this rain! The weather was never good since
knaves ruled about the King.</i>" So that came to the ears of
Privy Seal, who made a treason of it, and had his sheep, and his
house, and his lands, and his head. He was but one in ten
thousand that have gone the same road home from market and made
speeches as treasonable.'</p>
<p>'Thus poor Gilmaw died?' Katharine asked. 'What a foul world
this is!'</p>
<p>'Time it was cleansed,' he answered.</p>
<p>He let his words rankle for a time, then he said softly:
'Privy Seal's words before his armoury were as treasonable as
Gilmaw's on the market road.'</p>
<p>Again he paused.</p>
<p>'Privy Seal may call thee to account for such a treason,' he
said afterwards. 'He holdeth thee in a hollow of his hand.'</p>
<p>She did not speak.</p>
<p>He said softly: 'It is a folly to be too proud to fight the
world with the world's weapons.'</p>
<p>The heavy darkness seemed to thrill with her silence. He could
tell neither whether she were pondering his words nor whether she
still scorned him. He could not even hear her breathing.</p>
<p>'God help me!' he said at last, in an angry high note, 'I am
not such a man as to be played with too long. People fear
me.'</p>
<p>She kept silence still, and his voice grew high and shrill:
'Madam Howard, I can bend you to my will. I have the power to
make such a report of you as will hang you to-morrow.'</p>
<p>Her voice came to him expressionlessly&mdash;without any
inflexion. In few words, what would he have of her? She played
his own darkness off against him, so that he could tell nothing
new of her mood.</p>
<p>He answered swiftly: 'I will that you tell the men you know
what I have told you. You are a very little thing; it were no
more to me to cut you short than to drown a kitten. But my own
neck I prize. What I have told you I would have come to the ears
of my lord of Winchester. I may not be seen to speak with him
myself. If you will not tell him, another will; but I would
rather it were you.'</p>
<p>'Evil dreams make thy nights hideous!' she cried out so
suddenly that his voice choked in his throat. 'Thou art such dirt
as I would avoid to tread upon; and shall I take thee into my
hand?' She was panting with disgust and scorn. 'I have listened
to thee; listen thou to me. Thou art so filthy that if thou
couldst make me a queen by the touch of a finger, I had rather be
a goose-girl and eat grass. If by thy forged tales I could cast
down Mahound, I had rather be his slave than thy accomplice!
Could I lift my head if I had joined myself to thee? thou Judas
to the Fiend. Junius Brutus, when he did lay siege to a town, had
a citizen come to him that would play the traitor. He accepted
his proffered help, and when the town was taken he did flay the
betrayer. But thou art so filthy that thou shouldst make me do
better than that noble Roman, for I would flay thee, disdaining
to be aided by thee; and upon thy skin I would write a message to
thy master saying that thou wouldst have betrayed him!'</p>
<p>His laugh rang out discordant and full of black mirth; for a
long time his shoulders seemed to shake. He spoke at last quite
calmly.</p>
<p>'You will have a very short course in this world,' he
said.</p>
<p>A hoarse and hollow shouting reverberated from the gully; the
glow of a torch grew bright in the window-space. Katharine had
been upon the point of opening the door, but she paused, fearing
to meet some night villains in the gully. Throckmorton was now
silent, as if he utterly disdained her, and a frightful blow upon
the wood of the door&mdash;so certain were they that the torch
would pass on&mdash;made them spring some yards further into the
cellar. The splintering blows were repeated; the sound of them
was deafening. Glaring light entered suddenly through a great
crack, and the smell of smoke. Then the door fell in half, one
board of it across the steps, the other smashing back to the wall
upon its hinges. Sparks dripped from the torch, smoke eddied
down, and upon the cellar steps were the legs of a man who rested
a great axe upon the ground and panted for breath.</p>
<p>'Up the steps!' he grunted. 'If you ever ran, now run. The
guard will not enter here.'</p>
<p>Katharine sped up the steps. It was old Rochford's face that
greeted hers beneath the torch. He grunted again, 'Run you; I am
spent!' and suddenly dashed the torch to the ground.</p>
<p>At the entry of the tunnel some make of creature caught at her
sleeve. She screamed and struck at a gleaming eye with the end of
her crucifix. Then nothing held her, and she ran to where, at the
mouth of the gully, there were a great many men with torches and
swords peering into the darkness of the passage.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the barge Margot made an outcry of joy and relief, and the
other ladies uttered civil speeches. The old man, whose fur near
the neck had been slashed by a knife-thrust as he came away,
explained pleasantly that he was able to strike good blows still.
But he shook his head nevertheless. It was evil, he said, to have
such lovers as this new one. Her cousin was bad, but this
rapscallion must be worse indeed to harbour her in such a
place...Margot, who knew her London, had caught him at the barge,
to which he had hurried.</p>
<p>'Aye,' he said, 'I thought you had played me a trick and gone
off with some spark. But when I heard to what place, I fetched
the guard along with me...Well for you that it was I, for they
had not come for any other man, and then you had been stuck in
the street. For, see you, whether you would have had me fetch you
away or no it is ten to one that a gallant who would take you
there would mean that you should never come away alive&mdash;and
God help you whilst you lived in that place.'</p>
<p>Katharine said:</p>
<p>'Why, I pray God that you may die on the green grass yet, with
time for a priest to shrive you. I was taken there against my
will.' She told him no more of the truth, for it was not every
man's matter, and already she had made up her mind that there was
but one man to whom to speak...She went into the dark end of the
barge and prayed until she came to Greenwich, for the fear of the
things she had escaped still made her shudder, and in the company
of Mary and the saints of Lincolnshire alone could she feel any
calmness. She thought they whispered round her in the night amid
the lapping of the water.</p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>The stables were esteemed the most magnificent that the King
had: three times they had been pulled down and again set up after
designs by Holbein the painter. The buildings formed three sides
of a square: the fourth gave into a great paddock, part of the
park, in which the horses galloped or the mares ran with their
foals. That morning there was a glint of sun in the opalescent
clouds: horse-boys in grey with double roses worked on their
chests were spreading sand in the great quadrangle, fenced in
with white palings, between the buildings where the chargers were
trained to the manage. Each wing of the buildings was a quarter
of a mile long, of grey stone thatched with rushwork that came
from the great beds all along the river and rose into curious
peaks like bushes along each gable. On the right were the mares,
the riding jennets for the women and their saddle rooms; on the
left the pack animals, mules for priests and the places for their
housings: in the centre, on each side of a vast barn that held
the provender, were the stables of the coursers and stallions
that the King himself rode or favoured; of these huge beasts
there were two hundred: each in a cage within the
houses&mdash;for many were savage tearers both of men and of each
other. On the door of each cage there was written the name of the
horse, as Sir Brian, Sir Bors, or Old Leo&mdash;and the sign of
the constellation under which each was born, the months in which,
in consequence, it was propitious or dangerous to ride them, and
pentagons that should prevent witches, warlocks or evil spirits
from casting spells upon the great beasts. Their housings and
their stall armour, covered with grease to keep the rust from
them, hung upon pulleys before each stall, and their polished
neck armours branched out from the walls in a long file, waving
over the gateways right into the distance, the face-pieces with
the shining spikes in the foreheads hanging at the ends, the
eyeholes carved out and the nostril places left vacant, so that
they resembled an arcade of the skeletons of unicorns' heads.</p>
<p>It was quiet and warm in the long and light aisles: there was
a faint smell of stable hartshorn and the sound of beans being
munched leisurely. From time to time there came a thunder from
distant boxes, as two untrained stallions that Privy Seal the day
before had given the King kicked against the immense balks of the
sliding doors in their cage-stalls.</p>
<p>The old knight was flustered because it was many days since
the King had deigned to come in the morning, and there were many
beasts to show him. In his steel armour, from which his old head
stood out benign and silvery, he strutted stiffly from cage to
cage, talking softly to his horses and cursing at the harnessers.
Cicely Elliott sat on a high stool from which she could look out
of window and gibed at him as he passed.</p>
<p>'Let me grease your potlids, goodly servant. You creak like a
roasting-jack.' He smiled at her with an engrossed air, and
hurried himself to pull tight the headstrap of a great barb that
was fighting with four men.</p>
<p>A tucket of trumpets sounded, silvery and thin through the
cold grey air: a page came running with his sallete-helmet.</p>
<p>'Why, I will lace it for him,' Cicely cried, and ran, pushing
away the boy. She laced it under the chin and laughed. 'Now you
may kiss my cheek so that I know what it is to be kissed by a man
in potlids!'</p>
<p>He swung himself, grunting a little, into the high saddle and
laughed at her with the air of a man very master of himself. The
tucket thrilled again. Katharine Howard pushed the window open,
craning out to see the King come: the horse, proud and mincing,
appearing in its grey steel as great as an elephant, stepped yet
so daintily that all its weight of iron made no more sound than
the rhythmic jingling of a sabre, and man and horse passed like a
flash of shadow out of the door.</p>
<p>Cicely hopped back on to the stool and shivered.</p>
<p>'We shall see these two old fellows very well without getting
such a rheumatism as Lady Rochford's,' and she pulled the window
to against Katharine's face and laughed at the vacant and
far-away eyes that the girl turned upon her. 'You are thinking of
the centaurs of the Isles of Greece,' she jeered, 'not of my
knight and his old fashions of ironwork and horse dancing. Yet
such another will never be again, so perfect in the old
fashions.'</p>
<p>The old knight passed the window to the sound of trumpets
towards his invisible master, swaying as easily to the gallop of
his enormous steel beast as cupids that you may see in friezes
ride upon dolphins down the sides of great billows; but
Katharine's eyes were upon the ground.</p>
<p>The window showed only some yards of sand, of grey sky and of
whitened railings; trumpet blew after trumpet, and behind her
back horse after horse went out, its iron feet ringing on the
bricks of the stable to die into thuds and silence once the door
was passed.</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott plagued her, tickling her pink ears with a
piece of straw and sending out shrieks of laughter, and
Katharine, motionless as a flower in breathless sunlight, was
inwardly trembling. She imagined that she must be pale and
hollow-eyed enough to excite the compassion of the black-haired
girl, for she had not slept at all for thinking, and her eyes
ached and her hands felt weak, resting upon the brick of the
window sill. Horses raced past, shaking the building, in pairs,
in fours, in twelves. They curvetted together, pawed their way
through intricate figures, arched their great necks, or, reined
in suddenly at the gallop, cast up the sand in showers and great
flakes of white foam.</p>
<p>The old knight came into view, motioning with his lance to
invisible horsemen from the other side of the manage, and the top
notes of his voice reached them thinly as he shouted the words of
direction. But the King was still invisible.</p>
<p>Suddenly Cicely Elliott cried out:</p>
<p>'Why, the old boy hath dropped his lance! <i>Quel
malheur!</i>'&mdash;and indeed the lance lay in the sand, the
horse darting wildly aside at the thud of its fall. The old man
shook his iron fist at the sky, and his face was full of rage and
shame in the watery sunlight that penetrated into his open
helmet. 'Poor old sinful man!' Cicely said with a note of concern
deep in her throat. A knave in grey ran to pick up the lance, but
the knight sat, his head hanging on his chest, like one mortally
stricken riding from a battlefield.</p>
<p>Katharine's heart was in her mouth, and all her limbs were
weak together; a great shoulder in heavy furs, the back of a
great cap, came into the view of the window, an immense hand
grasped the white balustrade of the manage rails. He was leaning
over, a figure all squares, like that on a court-card, only that
the embroidered bonnet raked abruptly to one side as if it had
been thrown on to the square head. Henry was talking to the old
knight across the sand. The sight went out of her eyes and her
throat uttered indistinguishable words. She heard Cicely Elliott
say:</p>
<p>'<i>What</i> will you do? My old knight is upon the point of
tears,' and Katharine felt herself brushing along the wall of the
corridor towards the open door.</p>
<p>The immense horse with his steel-plates spreading out like
skirts from its haunches dropped its head motionlessly close to
the rail, and the grey, wrinkling steel of the figure on its back
caught the reflection of the low clouds in flakes of light and
shadow.</p>
<p>The old knight muttered indistinguishable words of shame
inside his helmet; the King said: 'Ay, God help us, we all grow
old together!' and Katharine heard herself cry out:</p>
<p>'Last night you were about very late because evil men plotted
against me. Any man might drop his lance in the morning...'</p>
<p>Henry moved his head leisurely over his shoulder; his eyelids
went up, in haughty incredulity, so that the whites showed all
round the dark pupils. He could not turn far enough to see her
without moving his feet, and appearing to disdain so much trouble
he addressed the old man heavily:</p>
<p>'Three times I dropped my pen, writing one letter yesterday,'
he said; 'if you had my troubles you might groan of growing
old.'</p>
<p>But the old man was too shaken with the disgrace to ride any
more, and Henry added testily:</p>
<p>'I came here for distractions, and you have run me up against
old cares because the sun shone in your eyes. If you will get
tricking it with wenches over night you cannot be fresh in the
morning. That is gospel for all of us. Get in and disarm. I have
had enough of horses for the morning.'</p>
<p>As if he had dispatched that piece of business he turned,
heavily and all of one piece, right round upon Katharine. He set
his hands into his side and stood with his square feet wide
apart:</p>
<p>'It is well that you remember how to kneel,' he laughed,
ironically, motioning her to get up before she had reached her
knees. 'You are the pertest baggage I have ever met.'</p>
<p>He had recognised her whilst the words were coming out of his
great lips. 'Why, is it you the old fellow should marry? I heard
he had found a young filly to frisk it with him.'</p>
<p>Katharine, her face pale and in consternation, stammered that
Cicely Elliott was in the stables. He said:</p>
<p>'Bide there, I will go speak with her. The old fellow is very
cast down; we must hearten him. It is true that he groweth old
and has been a good servant.'</p>
<p>He pulled the dagger that hung from a thin gold chain on his
neck into its proper place on his chest, squared his shoulders,
and swayed majestically into the door of the stable. Katharine
heard his voice raised to laugh and dropping into his gracious
but still peremptory ardent tones. She remained alone upon the
level square of smooth sand. Not a soul was in sight, for when
the King came to seek distraction with his horses he brought no
one that could tease him. She was filled with fears.</p>
<p>He beckoned her to him with his head, ducking it right down to
his chest and back again, and the glances of his eyes seemed to
strike her like hammer-blows when he came out from the door.</p>
<p>'It was you then that composed that fine speech about the
Fortunate Isles?' he said. 'I had sent for you this morning. I
will have it printed.'</p>
<p>She wanted to hang her head like a pupil before her master,
but she needs must look him in the eyes, and her voice came
strangely and unearthly to her own ears.</p>
<p>'I could not remember the speech the Bishop of Winchester set
me to say. I warned him I have no memory for the Italian, and my
fright muddled my wits.'</p>
<p>Internal laughter shook him, and once again he set his feet
far apart, as if that aided him to look at her.</p>
<p>'Your fright!' he said.</p>
<p>'I am even now so frightened,' she uttered, 'that it is as if
another spoke with my throat.'</p>
<p>His great mouth relaxed as if he accepted as his due a piece
of skilful flattery. Suddenly she sank down upon her knees, her
dress spreading out beneath her, her hands extended and her red
lips parted as the beak of a bird opens with terror. He uttered
lightly:</p>
<p>'Why, get up. You should kneel so only to your God,' and he
touched his cap, with his habitual heavy gesture, at the sacred
name.</p>
<p>'I have somewhat to ask,' she whispered.</p>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p>'They are always asking! But get up. I have left my stick in
my room. Help me to my door.'</p>
<p>She felt the heavy weight of his arm upon her shoulder as soon
as she stood beside him.</p>
<p>He asked her suddenly what she knew of the Fortunate Islands
that she had talked of in her speech.</p>
<p>'They lie far in the Western Ocean; I had an Italian would
have built me ships to reach them,' he said, and Katharine
answered:</p>
<p>'I do take them to be a fable of the ancients, for they had no
heaven to pray for.'</p>
<p>When his eyes were not upon her she was not afraid, and the
heavy weight of his hand upon her shoulder made her feel firm to
bear it. But she groaned inwardly because she had urgent words
that must be said, and she imagined that nothing could be calmer
in the Fortunate Islands themselves than this to walk and
converse about their gracious image that shone down the ages. He
said, with a heavy, dull voice:</p>
<p>'I would give no little to be there.'</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard herself say, her heart leaping in her
chest:</p>
<p>'I do not like the errand they have sent my cousin upon.'</p>
<p>The blessed Utopia of the lost islands had stirred in the King
all sorts of griefs that he would shake off, and all sorts of
remembrances of youth, of open fields, and a wide world that
shall be conquered&mdash;all the hopes and instincts of
happiness, ineffable and indestructible, that never die in
passionate men. He said dully, his thoughts far away:</p>
<p>'What errand have they sent him upon? Who is your goodly
cousin?'</p>
<p>She answered:</p>
<p>'They put it about that he should murder Cardinal Pole,' and
she shook so much that he was forced to take his hand from her
shoulder.</p>
<p>He leaned upon the manage rail, and halted to rest his leg
that pained him.</p>
<p>'It is a good errand enough,' he said.</p>
<p>She was panting like a bird that you hold in your hand, so
that all her body shook, and she blurted out:</p>
<p>'I would not that my cousin should murder a Churchman!' and
before his eyebrows could go up in an amazed and haughty stare:
'I am like to be hanged between Privy Seal and Winchester.'</p>
<p>He seemed to fall against the white bar of the rail for
support, his eyes wide with incredulity.</p>
<p>He said: 'When were women hanged here?'</p>
<p>'Sir,' she said earnestly, 'you are the only one I can speak
to. I am in great peril from these men.'</p>
<p>He shook his head at her.</p>
<p>'You have gone mad,' he said gravely. 'What is this
fluster?'</p>
<p>'Give me your ear for a minute,' she pleaded. Her fear of him
as a man seemed to have died down. As a king she had never feared
him. 'These men do seek each other's lives, and many are like to
be undone between them.'</p>
<p>His nostrils dilated like those of a high-mettled horse that
starts back.</p>
<p>'What maggot is this?' he said imperiously. 'Here there is no
disunion.'</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes angrily and breathed short, twisting his
hands. It was part of his nature to insist that all the world
should believe in the concord of his people. He had walked there
to talk with a fair woman. He had imagined that she would pique
him with pert speeches.</p>
<p>'Speak quickly,' he said in a peremptory voice, and his eyes
wandered up the path between the rails and the stable walls. 'You
are a pretty piece, but I have no time to waste in woeful
nonsense.'</p>
<p>'Alas,' she said, 'this is the very truth of the truth. Privy
Seal hath tricked me.'</p>
<p>He laughed heavily and incredulously, and he sat right down
upon the rail. She began to tell him her whole story.</p>
<p>All through the night she had been thinking over the coil into
which she had fallen. It was a matter of desperate haste, for she
had imagined that Throckmorton would go at once or before dawn
and make up a tale to Privy Seal so that she should be put out of
the way. To her no counter-plotting was possible. Gardiner she
regarded with a young disdain: he was a man who walked in plots.
And she did not love him because he had treated her like a
servant after she had walked in his masque. Her uncle Norfolk was
a craven who had left her to sink or swim. Throckmorton, a
werewolf who would defile her if she entered into any compact
with him. He would inform against her, with the first light of
the morning, and she had trembled in her room at every footstep
that passed the door. She had imagined guards coming with their
pikes down to take her. She had trembled in the very stables.</p>
<p>The King stood above these plots and counter-plots. She
imagined him breathing a calmer air that alone was fit for her.
To one of her house the King was no more than a man. At home she
had regarded him very little. She had read too many chronicles.
He was first among such men as her men-folk because her men-folk
had so willed it: he was their leader, no more majestic than
themselves, and less sacred than most priests. But in that black
palace she felt that all men trembled before him. It gave her for
him a respect: he was at least a man before whom all these
cravens trembled. And she imagined herself such another being:
strong, confident, unafraid.</p>
<p>Therefore to the King alone she could speak. She imagined him
sympathising with her on account of the ignoble trick that
Cromwell had played upon her, as if he too must recognise her
such another as himself. Being young she felt that God and the
saints alike fought on her side. She was accustomed to think of
herself as so assured and so buoyant that she could bear alike
the commands of such men as Cromwell, as Gardiner and as her
cousin with a smile of wisdom. She could bide her time.</p>
<p>Throckmorton had shocked her, not because he was a villain who
had laid hands upon her, but because he had fooled her so that
unless she made haste those other men would prove too many for
her. They would hang her.</p>
<p>Therefore she must speak to the King. Lying still, looking at
the darkness, listening to the breathing of Margot Poins, who
slept across the foot of her bed, she had felt no fear whatsoever
of Henry. It was true she had trembled before him at the masque,
but she swept that out of her mind. She could hardly believe that
she had trembled and forgotten the Italian words that she should
have spoken. Yet she had stood there transfixed, without a
syllable in her mind. And she had managed to bring out any words
at all only by desperately piecing together the idea of Ovid's
poem and Aulus Gellius' Eulogy of Marcus Crassus, which was very
familiar in her ears because she had always imagined for a hero
such a man: munificent, eloquent, noble and learned in the laws.
The hall had seemed to blaze before her&mdash;it was only because
she was so petrified with fright that she had not turned tail or
fallen on her knees.</p>
<p>Therefore she must speak to him when he came to see his
horses. She must bring him to her side before the tall spy with
the eyes and the mouth that grinned as if at the thought of
virtue could give Cromwell the signal to undo her.</p>
<p>She spoke vehemently to the King; she was indignant, because
it seemed to her she was defiled by these foul men who had
grasped at her.</p>
<p>'They have brought me down with a plot,' she said. She
stretched out her hand and cried earnestly: 'Sir, believe that
what I would have I ask for without any plotting.'</p>
<p>He leant back upon his rail. His round and boding eyes avoided
her face.</p>
<p>'You have spoilt my morning betwixt you,' he muttered. First
it was old Rochford who failed. Could a man not see his horses
gallop without being put in mind of decay and death? Had he need
of that? 'Why, I asked you for pleasant converse,' he
finished.</p>
<p>She pleaded: 'Sir, I knew not that Pole was a traitor. Before
God, I would now that he were caught up. But assuredly a way
could be found with the Bishop of Rome...'</p>
<p>'This is a parcel of nonsense,' he shouted suddenly,
dismissing her whole story. Would she have him believe it
thinkable that a spy should swear away a woman's life? She had
far better spend her time composing of fine speeches.</p>
<p>'Sir,' she cried, 'before the Most High God...'</p>
<p>He lifted his hand.</p>
<p>'I am tired of perpetual tears,' he muttered, and looked up
the perspective of stable walls and white rails as if he would
hurry away.</p>
<p>She said desperately: 'You will meet with tears perpetual so
long as this man...'</p>
<p>He lifted his hand, clenched right over his head.</p>
<p>'By God,' he bayed, 'may I never rest from cat and dog
quarrels? I will not hear you. It is to drive a man mad when most
he needs solace.'</p>
<p>He jerked himself down from the rail and shot over his
shoulder:</p>
<p>'You will break your head if you run against a wall; I will
have you in gaol ere night fall.' And he seemed to push her
backward with his great hand stretched out.</p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>'Why, sometimes,' Throckmorton said, 'a very perfect folly is
like a very perfect wisdom.' He sat upon her table. 'So it is in
this case, he did send for me. No happening could have been more
fortunate.'</p>
<p>He had sent away the man from her door and had entered without
any leave, laughing ironically in his immense fan-shaped
beard.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship thought to have stolen a march upon me,' he
said. 'You could have done me no better service.'</p>
<p>She was utterly overcome with weariness. She sat motionless in
her chair and listened to him.</p>
<p>He folded his arms and crossed his legs.</p>
<p>'So he did send for me,' he said. 'You would have had him
belabour me with great words. But his Highness is a politician
like some others. He beat about the bush. And be sure I left him
openings to come in to my tidings.'</p>
<p>Katharine hung her head and thought bitterly that she had had
the boldness; this other man reaped the spoils. He leaned forward
and sighed. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>'You might wonder that I love you,' he said. 'But it is in the
nature of profound politicians to love women that be simple, as
it is the nature of sinners to love them that be virtuous. Do not
believe that an evil man loveth evil. He contemns it. Do not
believe that a politician loveth guile. He makes use of it to
carry him into such a security that he may declare his true
nature. Moreover, there is no evil man, since no man believeth
himself to be evil. I love you.'</p>
<p>Katharine closed her eyes and let her head fall back in her
chair. The dusk was falling slowly, and she shivered.</p>
<p>'You have no warrant to take me away?' she asked,
expressionlessly.</p>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p>'Thus,' he said, 'devious men love women that be simple. And,
for a profound, devious and guileful politician you shall find
none to match his Highness.'</p>
<p>He looked at Katharine with scrutinising and malicious eyes.
She never moved.</p>
<p>'I would have you listen,' he said.</p>
<p>She had had no one to talk to all that day. There was no
single creature with whom she could discuss. She might have asked
counsel of old Rochford. But apart from the disorder of his mind
he had another trouble. He had a horse for sale, and he had given
the refusal of it to a man called Stey who lived in Warwickshire.
In the meanwhile two Frenchmen had made him a greater offer, and
no answer came from Warwickshire. He was in a fume. Cicely
Elliott was watching him and thinking of nothing else, Margot
Poins was weeping all day, because the magister had been bidden
to go to Paris to turn into Latin the letters of Sir Thomas
Wyatt. There was no one around Katharine that was not engrossed
in his own affairs. In that beehive of a place she had been
utterly alone with horror in her soul. Thus she could hardly
piece together Throckmorton's meanings. She thought he had come
to gibe at her.</p>
<p>'Why should I listen?' she said.</p>
<p>'Because,' he answered sardonically, 'you have a great journey
indicated for you, and I would instruct you as to certain peaks
that you may climb.'</p>
<p>She had been using her rosary, and she moved it in her
lap.</p>
<p>'Any poor hedge priest would be a better guide on such a
journey,' she answered listlessly.</p>
<p>'Why, God help us all,' he laughed, 'that were to carry
simplicity into a throne-room. In a stable-yard it served. But
you will not always find a king among horse-straws.'</p>
<p>'God send I find the King of Peace on a prison pallet,' she
answered.</p>
<p>'Why, we are at cross purposes,' he said lightly. He laughed
still more loudly when he heard that the King had threatened her
with a gaol.</p>
<p>'Do you not see,' he asked, 'how that implies a great favour
towards you?'</p>
<p>'Oh, mock on,' she answered.</p>
<p>He leaned forward and spoke tenderly.</p>
<p>'Why, poor child,' he said. 'If a man be moved because you
moved him, it was you who moved him. Now, if you can move such a
heavy man that is a certain proof that he is not indifferent to
you.'</p>
<p>'He threatened me with a gaol,' Katharine said bitterly.</p>
<p>'Aye,' Throckmorton answered, 'for you were in fault to him.
That is ever the weakness of your simple natures. They will go
brutally to work upon a man.'</p>
<p>'Tell me, then, in three words, what his Highness will do with
me,' she said.</p>
<p>'There you go brutally to work again,' he said. 'I am a poor
man that do love you. You ask what another man will do with you
that affects you.'</p>
<p>He stood up to his full height, dressed all in black
velvet.</p>
<p>'Let us, then, be calm,' he said, though his voice trembled
and he paused as if he had forgotten the thread of his argument.
'Why, even so, you were in grievous fault to his Highness that is
a prince much troubled. As thus: You were certain of the
rightness of your cause.'</p>
<p>'It is that of the dear saints,' Katharine said...He touched
his bonnet with three fingers.</p>
<p>'You are certain,' he repeated. 'Nevertheless, here is a man
whose fury is like an agony to him. He looks favourably upon you.
But, if a man be formed to fight he must fight, and call the
wrong side good.'</p>
<p>'God help you,' Katharine said. 'What can be good that is set
in array against the elect of God?'</p>
<p>'These be brave words,' he answered, 'but the days of the
Crusades be over. Here is a King that fights with a world that is
part good, part evil. In part he fights for the dear saints; in
part they that fight against him fight for the elect of God. Then
he must call all things well upon his side, if he is not to fail
where he is right as well as where he is wrong.'</p>
<p>'I do not take you well,' Katharine said. 'When the
Laced&aelig;monians strove with the Great King...'</p>
<p>'Why, dear heart,' he said, 'those were the days of a black
and white world; now we are all grey or piebald.'</p>
<p>'Then tell me what the King will do with me,' she
answered.</p>
<p>He made a grimace.</p>
<p>'All your learning will not make of you but a very woman. It
is: What will he do? It is: A truce to words. It is: Get to the
point. But the point is this...'</p>
<p>'In the name of heaven,' she said, 'shall I go to gaol or
no?'</p>
<p>'Then in the name of heaven,' he said, 'you shall&mdash;this
next month, or next year, or in ten years' time. That is very
certain, since you goad a King to fury.'</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, but he silenced her with his hand.</p>
<p>'No, you shall not go to gaol upon this quarrel!' She sank
back into her chair. He surveyed her with a sardonic malice.</p>
<p>'But it is very certain,' he said, 'that had there been there
ready a clerk with a warrant and a pen, you had not again seen
the light of day until you came to a worse place on a hill.'</p>
<p>Katharine shivered.</p>
<p>'Why, get you gone, and leave me to pray,' she said.</p>
<p>He stretched out towards her a quivering hand.</p>
<p>'Aye, there you be again, simple and brutal!' His jaws grinned
beneath his beard. 'I love the air you breathe. I go about to
tell a tale in a long way that shall take a long time, so that I
may stay with you. You cry: "For pity, for pity, come to the
point." I have pity. So you cry, having obtained your desire,
"Get ye gone, and let me pray!"'</p>
<p>She said wearily:</p>
<p>'I have had too many men besiege me with their suits.'</p>
<p>He shrugged his great shoulders and cried:</p>
<p>'Yet you never had friend better than I, who bring you comfort
hoping for none in return.'</p>
<p>'Why,' she answered, 'it is a passing bitter thing that my
sole friend must be a man accounted so evil.'</p>
<p>He moved backwards again to the table; set his white hands
upon it behind him, and balancing himself upon them swung one of
his legs slowly.</p>
<p>'It is a good doctrine of the Holy Church,' he said, 'to call
no man evil until he be dead.' He looked down at the ground, and
then, suddenly, he seemed to mock at her and at himself.
'Doubtless, had such a white soul as yours led me from my first
day, you to-day had counted me as white. It is evident that I was
not born with a nature that warped towards sin. For, let us put
it that Good is that thing that you wish.' He looked up at her
maliciously. 'Let that be Good. Then, very certainly, since I am
enlisted heart and soul in the desire that you may have what you
wish, you have worked a conversion in me.'</p>
<p>'I will no longer bear with your mocking,' she said. She began
to feel herself strong enough to command for him.</p>
<p>'Why,' he answered, 'hear me you shall. And I must mock, since
to mock and to desire are my nature. You pay too little heed to
men's natures, therefore the day will come to shed tears. That is
very certain, for you will knock against the whole world.'</p>
<p>'Why, yes,' she answered. 'I am as God made me.'</p>
<p>'So are all Christians,' he retorted. 'But some of us strive
to improve on the pattern.' She made an impatient movement with
her hands, and he seemed to force himself to come to a point. 'It
may be that you will never hear me speak again,' he said quickly.
'Both for you and for me these times are full of danger. Let me
then leave you this legacy of advice...Here is a picture of the
King's Highness.'</p>
<p>'I shall never go near his Highness again,' Katharine
said.</p>
<p>'Aye, but you will,' he answered, 'for 'tis your nature to
meddle; or 'tis your nature to work for the blessed saints. Put
it which way you will. But his Highness meditateth to come near
you.'</p>
<p>'Why, you are mad,' Katharine said wearily. 'This is that
maggot of Magister Udal's.'</p>
<p>He lifted one finger in an affected, philosophic gesture.</p>
<p>'Oh, nay,' he laughed. 'That his Highness meditateth more
speech with you I am assured. For he did ask me where you usually
resorted.'</p>
<p>'He would know if I be a traitor.'</p>
<p>'Aye, but from your own word of mouth he would know it.' He
grinned once more at her. 'Do you think that I would forbear to
court you if I were not afraid of another than you?'</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders up to her ears, and he sniggered,
stroking his beard.</p>
<p>'You may take that as a proof very certain,' he said. 'None of
your hatred should have prevented me, for I am a very likeworthy
man. Ladies that have hated afore now, I have won to love me.
With you, too, I would essay the adventure. You are most fair,
most virtuous, most simple&mdash;aye, and most lovable. But for
the moment I am afraid. From now on, for many months, I shall not
be seen to frequent you. For I have known such matters of old. A
great net is cast: many fish&mdash;smaller than I be, who am a
proper man&mdash;are taken up.'</p>
<p>'It is good hearing that you will no more frequent me,'
Katharine said.</p>
<p>He nodded his great head.</p>
<p>'Why, I speak of what is in my mind,' he answered. 'Think upon
it, and it will grow clear when it is too late. But here I will
draw you a picture of the King.'</p>
<p>'I have seen his Highness with mine own eyes,' she caught him
up.</p>
<p>'But your eyes are so clear,' he sighed. 'They see the black
and the white of a man. The grey they miss. And you are slow to
learn. Nevertheless, already you have learned that here we have
no yea-nay world of evil and good...'</p>
<p>'No,' she said, 'that I have not learned, nor never
shall.'</p>
<p>'Oh, aye,' he mocked at her. 'You have learned that the Bishop
of Winchester, who is on the side of your hosts of heaven, is a
knave and a fool. You have learned that I, whom you have
accounted a villain, am for you, and a very wise man. You have
learned that Privy Seal, for whose fall you have prayed these ten
years, is, his deeds apart, the only good man in this quaking
place.'</p>
<p>'His acts are most hateful,' Katharine said stoutly.</p>
<p>'But these are not the days of Plutarch,' he answered. 'And I
doubt the days of Plutarch never were. For already you have
learned that a man may act most evilly, even as Privy Seal, and
yet be the best man in the world. And...' he ducked his great
head sardonically at her, 'you have learned that a man may be
most evil and yet act passing well for your good. So I will draw
the picture of the King for you...'</p>
<p>Something seductive in his voice, and the good humour with
which he called himself villain, made Katharine say no more
than:</p>
<p>'Why, you are an incorrigible babbler!'</p>
<p>Whilst he had talked she had grown assured that the King
meditated no imprisoning of her. The conviction had come so
gradually that it had merely changed her terrified weariness into
a soft languor. She lay back in her chair and felt a comfortable
limpness in all her limbs.</p>
<p>'His Highness,' Throckmorton said, 'God preserve him and send
him good fortune&mdash;is a great and formidable club. His
Highness is a most great and most majestic bull. He is a
thunderbolt and a glorious light; he is a storm of hail and a
beneficent sun. There are few men more certain than he when he is
certain. There is no one so full of doubts when he doubteth.
There is no wind so mighty as he when he is inspired to blow; but
God alone, who directeth the wind in its flight, knoweth when he
will storm through the world. His Highness is a balance of a pair
of scales. Now he is up, now down. Those who have ruled him have
taken account of this. If you had known the Sieur Cromwell as I
have, you would have known this very well. The excellent the
Privy Seal hath been beknaved by the hour, and hath borne it with
a great composure. For, well he knew that the King, standing in
midst of a world of doubts, would, in the next hour, the next
week, or the next month, come in the midst of doubts to be of
Privy Seal's mind. Then Privy Seal hath pushed him to action. Now
his Highness is a good lover, and being himself a great doubter,
he loveth a simple and convinced nature. Therefore he hath loved
Privy Seal...'</p>
<p>'In the name of the saints,' Katharine laughed, 'call you
Privy Seal's a simple nature?'</p>
<p>He answered imperturbably:</p>
<p>'Call you Cato's a complex one? He who for days and days and
years and years said always one thing alone: "Carthage must be
destroyed!"'</p>
<p>'But this man is no noble Roman,' Katharine cried
indignantly.</p>
<p>'There was never a nature more Roman,' Throckmorton mocked at
her. 'For if Cato cried for years: <i>Delenda est Carthago</i>,
Cromwell hath contrived for years: <i>Floreat rex meus.</i> Cato
stuck at no means. Privy Seal hath stuck at none. Madam Howard:
Privy Seal wrote to the King in his first letter, when he was but
a simple servant of the Cardinal, "I, Thomas Cromwell, if you
will give ear to me, will make your Grace the richest and most
puissant king ever there was." So he wrote ten years agone; so he
hath said and written daily for all those years. This it is to
have a simple nature...'</p>
<p>'But the vile deeds!' Katharine said.</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' Throckmorton laughed, 'I would ask you how
many broken treaties, how many deeds of treachery, went to the
making of the Roman state, since Sinon a traitor brought about
the fall of Troy, since Aeneas betrayed Queen Dido and brought
the Romans into Italy, until Sylla played false with Marius,
C&aelig;sar with the friends of Sylla, Brutus with C&aelig;sar,
Antony with Brutus, Octavius with Antony&mdash;aye, and until the
Blessed Constantine played false to Rome herself.'</p>
<p>'Foul man, ye blaspheme,' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>'God keep me from that sin,' he answered gravely.</p>
<p>'&mdash;And of all these traitors,' she continued, 'not one
but fell.'</p>
<p>'Aye, by another traitor,' he caught her up. 'It was then as
now. Men fell, but treachery prospered&mdash;aye, and Rome
prospered. So may this realm of England prosper exceedingly. For
it is very certain that Cromwell hath brought it to a great
pitch, yet Cromwell made himself by betraying the great
Cardinal.'</p>
<p>Katharine protested too ardently to let him continue. The land
was brought to a low and vile estate. And it was known that
Cromwell had been, before all things, and to his own peril,
faithful to the great Cardinal's cause.</p>
<p>Throckmorton shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>'Without doubt you know these histories better than I,' he
answered. 'But judge them how you will, it is very certain that
the King, who loveth simple natures, loveth Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>'Yet you have said that he lay under a great shadow,'
Katharine convicted him.</p>
<p>'Well,' he said composedly, 'the balance is down against him.
This league with Cleves hath brought him into disfavour. But well
he knoweth that, and it will be but a short time ere he will work
again, and many years shall pass ere again he shall misjudge.
Such mistakes hath he made before this. But there hath never been
one to strike at him in the right way and at the right time. Here
then is an opening.'</p>
<p>Katharine regarded him with a curiosity that was friendly and
awakened: he caught her expression and laughed.</p>
<p>'Why, you begin to learn,' he said.</p>
<p>'When you speak clearly I can take your meaning,' she
answered.</p>
<p>'Then believe me,' he said earnestly. 'Tell all with whom you
may come together. And you may come to your uncle very easily.
Tell him that if he may find France and Spain embroiled within
this five months, Privy Seal and Cleves may fall together. But,
if he delay till Privy Seal hath shaken him clear of Cleves,
Cromwell shall be our over-king for twenty years.'</p>
<p>He paused and then continued:</p>
<p>'Believe me again. Every word that is spoken against Privy
Seal shall tell its tale&mdash;until he hath shaken himself clear
of this Cleves coil. His Highness shall rave, but the words will
rankle. His Highness shall threaten you&mdash;but he shall not
strike&mdash;for he will doubt. It is by his doubts that you may
take him.'</p>
<p>'God help me,' Katharine said. 'What is this of "you" to
me?'</p>
<p>He did not heed her, but continued:</p>
<p>'You may speak what you will against Privy Seal&mdash;but
speak never a word against the glory of the land. It is when you
do call this realm the Fortunate Land that at once you make his
Highness incline towards you&mdash;and doubt. "Island of the
Blest," say you. This his Highness rejoices, saying to himself:
"My governing appeareth Fortunate to the World." But his Highness
knoweth full well the flaws that be in his Fortunate Island. And
specially will he set himself to redress wrongs, assuage tears,
set up chantries, and make his peace with God. But if you come to
him saying: "This land is torn with dissent. Here heresies breed
and despair stalks abroad"; if you say all is not well, his
Highness getteth enraged. "All is well," he will swear. "All is
well, for I made it"&mdash;and he would throw his cap into the
face of Almighty God rather than change one jot of his work. In
short, if you will praise him you make him humble, for at bottom
the man is humble; if you will blame him you will render him
rigid as steel and more proud than the lightning. For, before the
world's eyes, this man must be proud, else he would die.'</p>
<p>Katharine had her hand upon her cheek. She said musingly:</p>
<p>'His Highness did threaten me with a gaol. But you say he will
not strike. If I should pray him to restore the Church of God,
would he not strike then?'</p>
<p>'Child,' Throckmorton answered, 'it will lie with the way you
ask it. If you say: "This land is heathen, your Grace hath so
made it," his Highness will be more than terrible. But if you
say: "This land prospereth exceedingly and is beloved of the
Mother of God," his Highness will begin to doubt that he hath
done little to pleasure God's Mother&mdash;or to pleasure you who
love that Heavenly Rose. Say how all good people rejoice that his
Highness hath given them a faith pure and acceptable. And very
shortly his Highness will begin to wonder of his Faith.'</p>
<p>'But that were an ignoble flattery,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>He answered quietly:</p>
<p>'No! no! For indeed his Highness hath given all he could give.
It is the hard world that hath pushed him against you and against
his good will. Believe me, his Highness loveth good doctrine
better than you, I, or the Bishop of Rome. So that...'</p>
<p>He paused, and concluded:</p>
<p>'This Lord Cromwell moves in the shadow of a little thing that
casts hardly any shadow. You have seen it?'</p>
<p>She shook her head negligently, and he laughed:</p>
<p>'Why, you will see it yet. A small, square thing upon a green
hill. The noblest of our land kneel before it, by his Highness'
orders. Yet the worship of idols is contemned now.' He let his
malicious eyes wander over her relaxed, utterly resting
figure.</p>
<p>'I would ye would suffer me to kiss you on the mouth,' he
sighed.</p>
<p>'Why, get you gone,' she said, without anger.</p>
<p>'Oh, aye,' he said, with some feeling. 'It is pleasant to be
desired as I desire you. But it is true that ye be meat for my
masters.'</p>
<p>'I will take help from none of your lies.' She returned to her
main position.</p>
<p>He removed his bonnet, and bowed so low to her that his great
and shining beard hung far away from his chest.</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' he mocked, 'my lies will help you well when
the time comes.'</p>

<h2><a name="PART_THREE" id="PART_THREE"></a>PART THREE</h2>
<h2>THE KING MOVES</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>March was a month of great storms of rain in that year, and
the river-walls of the Thames were much weakened. April opened
fine enough for men to get about the land, so that, on a day
towards the middle of the month, there was a meeting of seven
Protestant men from Kent and Essex, of two German servants of the
Count of Oberstein, and of two other German men in the
living-room of Badge, the printer, in Austin Friars. It happened
that the tide was high at four in the afternoon, and, after a
morning of glints of sun, great rain fell. Thus, when the Lord
Oberstein's men set out into the weather, they must needs turn
back, because the water was all out between Austin Friars and the
river. They came again into the house, not very unwillingly, to
resume their arguments about Justification by Faith, about the
estate of the Queen Anne, about the King's mind towards her, and
about the price of wool in Flanders.</p>
<p>The printer himself was gloomy and abstracted; arguments about
Justification interested him little, and when the talk fell upon
the price of wool, he remained standing, absolutely lost in
gloomy dreams. It grew a little dark in the room, the sky being
so overcast, and suddenly, all the voices having fallen, there
was a gurgle of water by the threshold, and a little flood,
coming in between sill and floor, reached as it were, a tiny
finger of witness towards his great feet. He looked down at it
uninterestedly, and said:</p>
<p>'Talk how you will, I can measure this thing by words and by
print. Here hath this Queen been with us a matter of four months.
Now in my chronicle the pageants that have been made in her
honour fill but five pages.' Whereas the chronicling of the
jousts, pageants, merry-nights, masques and hawkings that had
been given in the first four months of the Queen Jane had
occupied sixteen pages, and for the Queen Anne Boleyn sixty and
four. 'What sort of honour is it, then, that the King's Highness
showeth the Queen?' He shook his head gloomily.</p>
<p>'Why, goodman,' a woolstapler from the Tower Hamlets cried at
him, 'when they shot off the great guns against her coming to
Westminster in February all my windows were broken by the
shrinking of the earth. Such ordnance was never yet shot off in a
Queen's honour.'</p>
<p>The printer remained gloomily silent for a minute; the wind
howled in the chimney-place, and the embers of the fire spat and
rustled.</p>
<p>'Even as ye are held here by the storm, so is the faith of God
in these lands,' he said. 'This is the rainy season.' More water
came in beneath the door, and he added, 'Pray God we be not all
drowned in our holes.'</p>
<p>A motionless German, who had no English, shifted his feet from
the wet floor to the cross-bar of his chair. Gloom, dispiritude,
and dampness brooded in the low, dark room. But a young man from
Kent, who, being used to ill weather, was not to be cast down by
gloomy skies, cried out in his own dialect that they had arms to
use and leaders to lead them.</p>
<p>'Aye, and we have racks to be stretched on and hang-men to
stretch them,' the printer answered. 'Is it with the sound of
ordnance that a Queen is best welcomed? When she came to
Westminster, what welcome had she? Sirs, I tell you the Mayor of
London brought only barges and pennons and targets to her honour.
The King's Highness ordered no better state; therefore the King's
Highness honoureth not this Queen.'</p>
<p>A scrivener who had copied chronicles for another printer
answered him:</p>
<p>'Master Printer John Badge, ye are too much in love with
velvet; ye are too avid of gold. Earlier records of this realm
told of blows struck, of ships setting sail, of godly ways of
life and of towns in France taken by storm. But in your books of
the new reign we read all day of cloths of estate, of cloth of
gold, of blue silk full of eyes of gold, of garlands of laurels
set with brims of gold, of gilt bars, of crystal corals, of black
velvet set with stones, and of how the King and his men do shift
their suits six times in one day. The fifth Harry never shifted
his harness for fourteen days in the field.'</p>
<p>The printer shrugged his enormous shoulders.</p>
<p>'Oh, ignorant!' he said. 'A hundred years ago kings made war
with blows. Now it is done with black velvets or the lack of
black velvets. And I love laurel with brims of gold if such
garlands crown a Queen of our faith. And I lament their lack if
by it the King's Highness maketh war upon our faith. And Privy
Seal shall dine with the Bishop of Winchester, and righteousness
kiss with the whoredom of abomination.'</p>
<p>'An my Lord Cromwell knew how many armed men he had to his
beck he had never made peace with Winchester,' the man from Kent
cried. He rose from his bench and went to stand near the
fire.</p>
<p>A door-latch clicked, and in the dark corner of the room
appeared something pale and shining&mdash;the face of old Badge,
who held open the stair-door and grinned at the assembly, leaning
down from a high step.</p>
<p>'Weather-bound all,' he quavered maliciously. 'I will tell you
why.'</p>
<p>He slipped down the step, pulling behind him the large figure
of his grandchild Margot.</p>
<p>'Get you gone back,' the printer snarled at her.</p>
<p>'That will I not,' her gruff voice came. 'See where my back is
wet with the drippings through the roof.'</p>
<p>She and her grandfather had been sitting on a bed in the upper
room, but the rain was trickling now through the thatch. The
printer made a nervous stride to his printing stick, and,
brandishing it in the air, poured out these words:</p>
<p>'Whores and harlots shall not stand in the sight of the
godly.'</p>
<p>Margot shrank back upon the stair-place and remained there,
holding the bolt of the door in her hand, ready to shut off
access to the upper house.</p>
<p>'I will take no beating, uncle,' she panted; 'this is my
grandfather's abode and dwelling.'</p>
<p>The old man was sniggering towards the window. He had gathered
up his gown about his knees and picked his way between the pools
of water on the floor and the Lutherans on their chairs towards
the window. He mounted upon an oak chest that stood beneath the
casement and, peering out, chuckled at what he saw.</p>
<p>'A mill race and a dam,' he muttered. 'This floor will be a
duck pond in an hour.'</p>
<p>'Harlot and servant of a harlot,' the printer called to his
niece. The Lutherans, who came from houses where father
quarrelled with son and mother with daughter, hardly troubled
more than to echo the printer's words of abuse. But one of them,
a grizzled man in a blue cloak, who had been an ancient friend of
the household, broke out:</p>
<p>'Naughty wench, thou wast at the ordeal of Dr Barnes.'</p>
<p>Margot, drawing her knees up to her chin where she sat on the
stairs, answered nothing. Had she not feared her uncle's stick,
she was minded to have taken a mop to the floor and to have put a
clout in the doorway.</p>
<p>'Abominable naughty wench,' the grizzled man went on. 'How had
ye the heart to aid in that grim scene? Knew ye no duty to your
elders?'</p>
<p>Margot closed the skirts round her ankles to keep away the
upward draught and answered reasonably:</p>
<p>'Why, Neighbour Ned, my mistress made me go with her to see a
heretic swinged. And, so dull is it in our service, that I would
go to a puppet show far less fine and thank thee for the
chance.'</p>
<p>The printer spat upon the floor when she mentioned her
mistress.</p>
<p>'I will catechize,' he muttered. 'Answer me as I charge
thee.'</p>
<p>The old man, standing on the chest, tapped one of the Germans
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>'See you that wall, friend?' he laughed. 'Is it not a noble
dam to stay the flood back into our house? Now the Lord
Cromwell...'</p>
<p>The Lanzknecht rolled his eyes round, because he understood no
English. The old man went on talking, but no one there, not even
Margot Poins, heeded him. She looked at her uncle reasonably, and
said:</p>
<p>'Why, an thou wilt set down thy stick I will even consider
thee, uncle.' He threw the stick into the corner and immediately
she went to fetch a mop from the cooking closet, where there
lived a mumbling old housekeeper. The printer followed her with
gloomy eyes.</p>
<p>'Is not thy mistress a naughty woman?' he asked, as a judge
talks to a prisoner condemned.</p>
<p>She answered, 'Nay,' as if she had hardly attended to him.</p>
<p>'Is she not a Papist?'</p>
<p>She answered, 'Aye,' in the same tone and mopped the floor
beneath a man's chair.</p>
<p>Her grandfather, standing high on the oak chest, so that his
bonnet brushed the beams of the dark ceiling, quavered at
her:</p>
<p>'Would she not bring down this Crummock, whose wall hath
formed a dam so that my land-space is now a stream and my
house-floor a frog pond?'</p>
<p>She answered, 'Aye, grandfer,' and went on with her
mopping.</p>
<p>'Did she not go with a man to a cellar of the Rogues'
Sanctuary after Winchester's feast?' Neighbour Ned barked at her.
'Such are they that would bring down our Lord!'</p>
<p>'Did she not even so with her cousin before he went to
Calais?' her uncle asked.</p>
<p>Margot answered seriously:</p>
<p>'Nay, uncle, no night but what she hath slept in these arms of
mine that you see.'</p>
<p>'Aye, you are her creature,' Neighbour Ned groaned.</p>
<p>'Foul thing,' the printer shouted. 'Eyes are upon thee and
upon her. It was the worst day's work that ever she did when she
took thee to her arms. For I swear to God that her name shall be
accursed in the land. I swear to God...'</p>
<p>He choked in his throat. His companions muttered Harlot;
Strumpet; Spouse of the Fiend. And suddenly the printer
shouted:</p>
<p>'See you; Udal is her go-between with the King, and he shall
receive thee as his price. He conveyeth her to his Highness, she
hath paid him with thy virtue. Foul wench, be these words not
true?'</p>
<p>She leaned upon her mop handle and said:</p>
<p>'Why, uncle, it is a foul bird that 'files his own nest.'</p>
<p>He shook his immense fist in her face.</p>
<p>'Shame shall out in the communion of the godly, be it whose
kin it will.'</p>
<p>'Why, I wish the communion of the godly joy in its hot tales,'
she answered. 'As for me, speak you with the magister when he
comes from France. As for my mistress, three times she hath seen
the King since Winchester's feast was three months agone. She in
no wise affected his Highness till she had heard his Highness
confute the errors of Dr Barnes in the small closet. When she
came away therefrom she said that his Highness was like a god for
his knowledge of God's law. If you want better tales than that go
to a wench from the stairs to make them for you.'</p>
<p>'Aye,' said their neighbour, 'three times hath she been with
the King. And the price of the first time was the warrant that
took thee to pay Udal for his connivance. And the price of the
second was that the King's Highness should confute our sacred
Barnes in the conclave. And the price of the third was that the
Lord Cromwell should dine with the Bishop of Winchester and
righteousness sit with its head in ashes.'</p>
<p>'Why, have it as thou wilt, Neighbour Ned,' she answered. 'In
my life of twenty years thou hast brought me twenty sugar cates.
God forbid that I should stay thy willing lips over a sweet
morsel.'</p>
<p>In the gloomy and spiritless silence that fell upon them
all&mdash;since no man there much believed the things that were
alleged, but all very thoroughly believed that evil days were
stored up against them&mdash;the bursting open of the door made
so great a sound that the speechless German tilted backward with
his chair and lay on the ground, before any of them knew what was
the cause. The black figure of a boy shut out the grey light and
the torrents of rain. His head was bare, his frieze clothes
dripped and sagged upon his skin: he waved his clenched fist half
at the sky and half at Margot's face and screamed:</p>
<p>'I ha' carried letters for thee, 'twixt thy mistress and the
King! I ha' carried letters. I...ha'...been gaoled for it.'</p>
<p>'O fool,' Margot's deep voice uttered, unmoved, 'the letters
went not between those two. And thou art free; come in from the
rain.'</p>
<p>He staggered across the prostrate German.</p>
<p>'I ha' lost my advancement,' he sobbed. 'Where shall I go?
Twenty hours I have hidden in the reeds by the riverside. I shall
be taken again.'</p>
<p>'There is no hot pursuit for thee then,' Margot said, 'for in
all the twenty hours no man hath sought thee here.' She had the
heavy immobility of an elemental force. No fright could move her
till she saw the cause for fright. 'I will fetch thee a dram of
strong waters.'</p>
<p>He passed his hand across his wet forehead.</p>
<p>'Thy mistress is taken,' he cried. 'I saw Privy Seal's pikes
go to her doorway.'</p>
<p>'Now God be praised,' the printer cried out, and caught at the
boy's wrist. 'Tell your tale!' and he shook him on his legs.</p>
<p>'Me, too, Privy Seal had taken&mdash;but I 'scaped free,' he
gasped. 'These twain had promised me advancement for braving
their screeds. And I ha' lost it.'</p>
<p>'Gossips all,' the Neighbour Ned barked out, 'to your feet and
let us sing: "A fortress fast is God the Lord." The harlot of the
world is down.'</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>During the time that had ensued between January and that month
of March, it had been proved to Katharine Howard how well
Throckmorton, the spy, voiced the men folk of their day. He had
left her alone, but she seemed to feel his presence in all the
air. He passed her in corridors, and she knew from his very
silence that he was carrying on a fumbling game with her uncle
Norfolk, and with Gardiner of Winchester. He had not induced her
to play his game&mdash;but he seemed to have made her see that
every man else in the world was playing a game like his. It was
not, precisely, any more a world of black and white that she saw,
but a world of men who did one thing in order that something very
different might happen a long time afterwards.</p>
<p>The main Court had moved from Greenwich to Hampton towards the
end of January, but the Lady Mary, with her ladies, came to a
manor house at Isleworth; and shut in as she was with a grim
mistress&mdash;who assuredly was all white or
black&mdash;Katharine found herself like one with ears strained
to catch sounds from a distance, listening for the smallest
rumours that could come from the other great house up stream.</p>
<p>The other ladies each had their men, as Cicely Elliott had the
old knight. One of them had even six, who one day fought a
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> for her favours on an eyot before the
manor windows. These men came by barge in the evenings, or rode
over the flats with a spare horse to take their mistresses
a-hawking after the herons in the swampy places. So that each of
them had her channel by which true gossip might reach her. But
Katharine had none. Till the opening of March the magister came
to whisper with Margot Poins&mdash;then he was sent again to
Paris to set his pen at the service of Sir Thomas Wyatt, who had
so many letters to write. Thus she heard much women's tattle, but
knew nothing of what passed. Only it seemed certain that Gardiner
of Winchester was seeing fit&mdash;God knows why&mdash;to be hot
in favour of the Old Faith. It was certain, from six several
accounts, that at Paul's Cross he had preached a sermon full of a
very violent and acceptable doctrine. She wondered what move in
the game this was: it was assuredly not for the love of God. No
doubt it was part of Throckmorton's plan. The Lutherans were to
be stirred to outrages in order to prove to the King how insolent
were they upon whom Privy Seal relied.</p>
<p>It gratified her to see how acute her prescience had been when
Dr Barnes made his furious reply to the bishop. For Dr Barnes was
one of Privy Seal's most noted men: an insolent fool whom he had
taken out of the gutter to send ambassador to the Schmalkaldners.
And it was on the day when Gardiner made his complaint to the
King about Dr Barnes, that her uncle Norfolk sent to her to come
to him at Hampton.</p>
<p>He awaited her, grim and jaundiced, in the centre of a great,
empty room, where, shivering with cold, he did not let his voice
exceed a croaking whisper though there was panelling and no arras
on the dim walls. But, to his queries, she answered clearly:</p>
<p>'Nay, I serve the Lady Mary with her Latin. I hear no tales
and I bear none to any man.' And again:</p>
<p>'Three times I have spoken with the King's Highness, the Lady
Mary being by. And once it was of the Islands of the Blest, and
once of the Latin books I read, and once of indifferent
matters&mdash;such as of how apple trees may be planted against a
wall in Lincolnshire.'</p>
<p>Her uncle gazed at her: his dark eyes were motionless and
malignant by habit; he opened his lips to speak; closed them
again without a word spoken. He looked at a rose, carved in a far
corner of the ceiling, looked at her again, and muttered:</p>
<p>'The French are making great works at Ardres.'</p>
<p>'Oh, aye,' she answered, 'my cousin Tom wrote me as much. He
is commanded to stay at Calais.'</p>
<p>'Tell me,' he said, 'will they go against Calais town in good
earnest?'</p>
<p>'If I knew that,' she answered, 'I should have had it in
private words from my lady whom I serve. And, if I had it in
private words I would tell it neither to you nor to any man.'</p>
<p>He scowled patiently and muttered:</p>
<p>'Then tell in private words back again this: That if the
French King or the Emperor do war upon us now Privy Seal will sit
upon the King's back for ever.'</p>
<p>'Ah, I know who hath talked with you,' she answered. 'Uncle,
give me your hand to kiss, for I must back to my mistress.'</p>
<p>He put his thin hand grimly behind his back.</p>
<p>'Ye spy, then, for others,' he said. 'Go kiss their feet.'</p>
<p>She laughed in a nettled voice:</p>
<p>'If the others get no more from me than your Grace of
Norfolk...'</p>
<p>He frowned ominously, pivoted stiffly round on his heels, and
said over his shoulder:</p>
<p>'Then I will have thy cousin clapped up the first time he is
found in a drunken brawl at Calais.'</p>
<p>She was after him beseechingly, with her hands held out:</p>
<p>'Oh no, uncle,' and 'Oh, dear uncle. Let poor fool Tom be
drunken when drunken brawls work no manner of ill.'</p>
<p>'Then get you sent to the King of France, through the channel
that you wot of, the message I have given you to convey.' He kept
his back to her and spoke as if to the distant door.</p>
<p>'Why must I mull in these matters?' she asked him piteously,
'or why must poor Tom? God help him, he found me bread when you
had left me to starve.' It came to her as pitiful that her
cousin, swaggering and unconscious, at a great distance, should
be undone because these men quarrelled near her. He moved stiffly
round again&mdash;he was so bolstered over with clothes against
the cold.</p>
<p>'It is not you that must meddle here,' he said. 'It is your
mistress. Only she will be believed by those you wot of.'</p>
<p>'Speak you yourself,' she said.</p>
<p>He scowled hatefully.</p>
<p>'Who of the French would believe <i>me</i>,' he snarled. He
had been so made a tool of by Privy Seal in times past that he
had lost all hope of credence.</p>
<p>'If I may come to it, I will do it,' she said suddenly.</p>
<p>After all, it seemed to her, this action might bring about the
downfall of Privy Seal&mdash;and she desired his downfall. It
would be a folly to refuse her aid merely because her uncle was a
craven man or Throckmorton a knave. It was a true thing that she
was to ask the Lady Mary to say&mdash;that if France and Spain
should molest England together the Cleves alliance must stand for
good&mdash;and with it Privy Seal.</p>
<p>'But, a' God's name, let poor Tom be,' she added.</p>
<p>He stood perfectly motionless for a moment, shrugged his
shoulders straight up and down, stood motionless for another
moment, and then held out his hand. She touched it with her
lips.</p>
<hr>
<p>There was a certain cate, or small cake, made of a paste
sweetened with honey and flavoured with cinnamon, that Katharine
Howard very much loved. She had never tasted them till one day
the King had come to visit his daughter, bearing with his own
hands a great box of them. He had had the receipt from Thomas
Cromwell, who had had it of a Jew in Italy. Mary so much
disaffected her father that, taking them from his hands with one
knee nearly upon the ground, she had said that her birth
ill-fitted her to eat these princely viands, and she had placed
them on a ledge of her writing-pulpit. Heaving a heavy sigh, he
glanced at her book and said that he would not have her spoil her
eyes with too much of study; let her bid Lady Katharine to read
and write for her.</p>
<p>'She will have greater need of her eyes than ever I of mine,'
Mary answered with her passionless voice.</p>
<p>'I will not have you spoil your eyes,' he said heavily, and
she gave him back the reply:</p>
<p>'My eyes are your Highness'.'</p>
<p>He made with his shoulders a slow movement of exasperation,
and, turning to Katharine Howard, he began once more to talk of
the Islands of the Blest. He was dressed all in black furs that
day, so that his face appeared less pallid than when he had worn
scarlet, and it seemed to her suddenly that he was a very pitiful
man&mdash;a man who could do nothing; and one who, as
Throckmorton had said, was nothing but a doubt. There beside him,
between the two of them, stood his daughter&mdash;pale, straight,
silent, her hands clasped before her. And her father had come to
placate her. He had brought her cates to eat, or he would have
beaten her into loving him. Yet Mary of England stood as rigid as
a knife-blade; you could move her neither by love nor by threats.
This man had sinned against this daughter; here he was brought up
against an implacability. He was omnipotent in everything else;
this was his Pillars of Hercules. So she exerted herself to be
pleasant with him, and at one moment of the afternoon he
stretched out a great hand to the cinnamon cakes and placed one
in his own mouth. He sat still, and, his great jaws moving
slowly, he said that he scarcely doubted that, if he himself
could set sail with a great armada and many men, he should find a
calm region of tranquil husbandry and a pure faith.</p>
<p>'It might be found,' he said; then he sighed heavily, and,
looking earnestly at her, brushed the crumbs from the furs about
his neck.</p>
<p>'One day, doubtless, your Highness shall find them,' Katharine
answered, 'if your Highness shall apply yourself to the task.'
She was impatient with him for his sighs. Let him, if he would,
abandon his kingdom and his daughter to set out upon a quest, or
let him stay where he was and set to work at any other task.</p>
<p>'But whether your Highness shall find them beyond the Western
Isles or hidden in this realm of England...'</p>
<p>He shrugged his great shoulders right up till the furs on them
were brushed by the feathers that fell from his bonnet.</p>
<p>'God, wench!' he said gloomily, 'that is a question you are
main happy to have time to dally with. I have wife and child, and
kith and kin, and a plaguey basket of rotten apples to make cider
from.'</p>
<p>He pulled himself out of his chair with both hands on the
arms, stretched his legs as if they were cramped, and rolled
towards the door.</p>
<p>'Why, read of this matter in old books,' he said, 'and if you
find the place you shall take me there.' Then he spoke bitterly
to the Lady Mary, who had never moved.</p>
<p>'Since your eyes are mine, I bid you not spoil them,' he said.
'Let this lady aid you. She has ten times more of learning than
you have.' But, taking his jewelled walking-stick from beside the
door, he added, 'God, wench! you are my child. I have read your
commentary, and I, a man who have as much of good letters as any
man in Christendom, am well content to father you.'</p>
<p>'Did your Highness mark&mdash;this book being my
child&mdash;which side of the paper it was written on?' his
daughter asked.</p>
<p>Katharine Howard sighed, for it was the Lady Mary's bitter
jest that she wrote on the rough side of the paper, having been
born on the wrong side of the blanket.</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' she said to Katharine with a cold sneer, as of
a very aged woman, 'my father, who has taken many things from me
to give to other women, takes now my commentary to give to you.
Pray you finish it, and I will save mine eyes.'</p>
<p>As the King closed the door behind him she moved across to the
chair and sat herself down to gaze at the coals. Katharine knelt
at her feet and stretched out her hands. She was, she said, her
mistress's woman. But the Lady Mary turned obdurately the side of
her face to her suppliant; only her fingers picked at her black
dress.</p>
<p>'I am your woman,' Katharine said. 'Before God and St Anthony,
the King is naught to me! Before God and the Mother of God, no
man is aught to me! I swear that I am your woman. I swear that I
will speak as you bid me speak, or be silent. May God do so to me
if in aught I act other than may be of service to you!'</p>
<p>'Then you may sit motionless till the green mould is over your
cheeks,' Mary answered.</p>
<p>But two days later, in the afternoon, Katharine Howard came
upon her mistress with her jaws moving voraciously. Half of the
cinnamon cates were eaten from the box on the writing-pulpit. A
convulsion of rage passed over the girl's dark figure; her eyes
dilated and appeared to blaze with a hot and threatening
fury.</p>
<p>'If I could have thy head, before God I would shorten thee by
the neck!' she said. 'Stay now; go not. Take thy hand from the
door-latch.'</p>
<p>Sudden sobs shook her, and tears dropped down her furrowed and
pallid cheeks. She was tormented always by a gnawing and terrible
hunger that no meat and no bread might satisfy, so that, being
alone with the cates in the cold spring afternoon, she had, in
spite of the donor, been forced always nearer and nearer to
them.</p>
<p>'God help me!' she said at last. 'Udal is gone, and the
scullion that supplied me in secret has the small-pox. How may I
get me things to eat?'</p>
<p>'To have stayed to ask me!' Katharine cried. 'What a folly was
here!' For, as a daughter of the King, the Lady Mary was little
more than herself; but because she was daughter to a queen that
was at once a saint and martyr, Katharine was ready to spend her
life in her service.</p>
<p>'I would stay to ask a service of any man or woman,' Mary
answered, 'save only that I have this great hunger.' She clutched
angrily at her skirt, and so calmed herself.</p>
<p>'How may you help me?' she asked grimly. 'There are many that
would put poison in my food. My mother was poisoned.'</p>
<p>'I would eat myself of all the food that I bring you,' said
Katharine.</p>
<p>'And if thou wast poisoned, I must get me another, and yet
another after that. You know who it is that would have me
away.'</p>
<p>At that hint of the presence of Cromwell, Katharine grew more
serious.</p>
<p>'I will save of my own food,' she answered simply.</p>
<p>'Till your bones stick through your skin!' Mary sneered. 'See
you, do you know one man you could trust?'</p>
<p>The shadow fell the more deeply upon Katharine, because her
cousin&mdash;as she remembered every day&mdash;the one man that
she could trust, was in Calais town.</p>
<p>'I know of two women,' she said; 'my maid Margot and Cicely
Elliott.'</p>
<p>Mary of England reflected for a long time. Her eyes sunk deep
in her head, grey and baleful, had the look of her father's.</p>
<p>'Cicely Elliott is too well known for my woman,' she said.
'Thy maid Margot is a great lump, too. Hath she no lover?'</p>
<p>The magister was in Paris.</p>
<p>'But a brother she hath,' Katharine said; 'one set upon
advancement.'</p>
<p>Mary said moodily:</p>
<p>'Advancement, then, may be in this. God knoweth his own good
time. But you might tell him; or it were better you should bid
her tell him... In short words, and fur...wait.'</p>
<p>She had a certain snake-like eagerness and vehemence in her
motions. She opened swiftly an aumbry in which there stood a
tankard of milk. She took a clean pen, and then turned upon
Katharine.</p>
<p>'Before thou goest upon this errand,' she said, 'I would have
thee know that, for thee, there may be a traitor's death in
this&mdash;and some glory in Heaven.'</p>
<p>'You write to the Empress,' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>'I write to a man,' the Lady Mary said. 'Might you speak with
clear eyes to my father if you knew more than that?'</p>
<p>'I do not believe that you would bring your father down,'
Katharine said.</p>
<p>'Why, you have a very comfortable habit of belief,' Mary
sneered at her. 'In two words! Will you carry this treasonable
letter or no?'</p>
<p>'God help me,' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>'Well, God help you,' her mistress jeered. 'Two nights agone
you swore to be my woman and no other man's. Here you are in a
taking. Think upon it.'</p>
<p>She dipped her white pen in the milk and began to write upon a
great sheet of paper, holding her head aslant to see the shine of
the fluid.</p>
<p>Katharine fought a battle within herself. Here was treason to
the King&mdash;but that was a little thing to her. Yet the King
was a father whom she would bring back to this daughter, and the
traitor was a daughter whom she was sworn to serve and pledged to
bring back to this father. If then she conveyed this
letter...</p>
<p>'Tell me,' she asked of the intent figure above the paper,
'when, if ever, this plot shall burst?'</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' the other answered, 'I heard thee not.'</p>
<p>'I say I will convey your Highness' letter if the plot shall
not burst for many days. If it be to come soon I will forswear
myself and be no longer your woman.'</p>
<p>'Why, what a pax is here?' her mistress faced round on her.
'What muddles thy clear head? I doubt, knowing the craven kings
that are of my party, no plot shall burst for ten years. And
so?'</p>
<p>'Before then thou mayest be brought back to thy father,'
Katharine said.</p>
<p>Mary of England burst into a hoarse laughter.</p>
<p>'As God's my life,' she cried, 'that may well be. And you may
find a chaste whore before either.'</p>
<p>Whilst she was finishing her letter, Katharine Howard prayed
that Mary the Mother of Mercy might soften the hatred of this
daughter, even as, of old times, she had turned the heart of
Lucius the Syracusan. Then there should be an end to plotting and
this letter might work no ill.</p>
<p>Having waved the sheet of paper in the air to dry it, Mary
crumpled it into a ball.</p>
<p>'See you,' she said, 'if this miscarry I run a scant risk.
For, if this be a treason, this treason is well enough known
already to them you wot of. They might have had my head this six
years on one shift or another had they so dared. So to me it
matters little.&mdash;But for thee&mdash;and for thy maid Margot
and this maid's brother and his house and his father and his
leman&mdash;death may fall on ye all if this ball of paper
miscarry.'</p>
<p>Katharine made no answer and her mistress spoke on.</p>
<p>'Take now this paper ball, give it to thy maid Margot, bid thy
maid Margot bear it to her brother Ned.' Her brother Ned should
place it in his sleeve and walk with it to Herring Lane at
Hampton. There, over against the house of the Sieur Chapuys, who
was the Emperor's ambassador to this Christian nation&mdash;over
against that house there was a cookshop to which resorted the
servants of the ambassador. Passing it by, Katharine's maid's
brother should thrust his hand in at the door and cry 'a pox on
all stinking Kaiserliks and Papists,'&mdash;and he should cast
the paper at that cook's head. Then out would come master cook to
his door and claim reparation. And for reparation Margot's
brother Ned should buy such viands as the cook should offer him.
These viands he was to bring, as a good brother should, to his
hungry sister, and these viands his sister should take to her
room&mdash;which was Katharine's room. 'And, of an evening,' she
finished, 'I shall come to thy room to commune with thee of the
writers that be dead and yet beloved. Hast thou the lesson by
heart? I will say it again.'</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>It was in that way, however sorely against her liking, that
Katharine Howard came into a plot. It subdued her, it seemed to
age her, it was as if she had parted with some virtue. When again
she spoke with the King, who came to loll in his daughter's armed
chair one day out of every week, it troubled her to find that she
could speak to him with her old tranquillity. She was ashamed at
feeling no shame, since all the while these letters were passing
behind his back. Once even he had been talking to her of how they
nailed pear trees against the walls in her Lincolnshire home.</p>
<p>'Our garden man would say...' she began a sentence. Her eye
fell upon one of these very crumpled balls of paper. It lay upon
the table and it confused her to think that it appeared like an
apple. 'Would say...would say...' she faltered.</p>
<p>He looked at her with enquiring eyes, round in his great
head.</p>
<p>'It is too late,' she finished.</p>
<p>'Even too late for what?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Too late in the year to set the trees back,' she answered and
her fit of nervousness had passed. 'For there is a fluid in trees
that runneth upward in the spring of the year to greet the
blessed sun.'</p>
<p>'Why, what a wise lady is this!' he said, half earnest. 'I
would I had such an adviser as thou hast,' he continued to his
daughter.</p>
<p>He frowned for a moment, remembering that, being who he was,
he should stand in need of no advice.</p>
<p>'See you,' he said to Katharine. 'You have spoken of many
things and wisely, after a woman's fashion of book-learning. Now
I am minded that you should hear me speak upon the Word of God
which is a man's matter and a King's. This day sennight I am to
have brought to my closet a heretic, Dr Barnes. If ye will ye may
hear me confound him with goodly doctrines.'</p>
<p>He raised both his eyebrows heavily and looked first at the
Lady Mary.</p>
<p>'You, I am minded, shall hear a word of true doctrine.'</p>
<p>And to Katharine, 'I would hear how you think that I can
manage a disputation. For the fellow is the sturdiest rogue with
a yard of tongue to wag.'</p>
<p>Katharine maintained a duteous silence; the Lady Mary stood
with her hands clasped before her. Upon Katharine he smiled
suddenly and heavily.</p>
<p>'I grow too old to be a match for thee in the learning of this
world. Thy tongue has outstripped me since I am become
stale...But hear me in the other make of talk.'</p>
<p>'I ask no better,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>'Therefore,' he finished, 'I am minded that you, Mog, and your
ladies all, do move your residences from here to my house at
Hampton. This is an old and dark place; there you shall be better
honoured.'</p>
<p>He lay back in his chair and was pleased with the care that he
took of his daughter. Katharine glided intently across the smooth
bare floor and took the ball of paper in her hand. His eyes
followed her and he moved his head round after her movements,
heavily, and without any motion of his great body. He was in a
comfortable mood, having slept well the night before, and having
conversed agreeably in the bosom of a family where pleasant
conversation was a rare thing. For the Lady Mary had forborne to
utter biting speeches, since her eyes too had been upon that ball
of paper. The King did not stay for many minutes after Katharine
had gone.</p>
<p>She was excited, troubled and amused&mdash;and, indeed, the
passing of those letters held her thoughts in those few days.
Thus it was easy to give the paper to her maid Margot, and easy
to give Margot the directions. But she knew very well by what
shift Margot persuaded her scarlet-clothed springald of a brother
to take the ball and to throw it into the cookshop. For the young
Poins was set upon advancement, and Margot, buxom, substantial
and honest-faced, stood before him and said: 'Here is your chance
for advancement made...' if he could carry these missives very
secretly.</p>
<p>'For, brother Poins,' she said, 'thou knowest these great
folks reward greatly&mdash;and these things pass between folks
very great. If I tell thee no names it is because thou canst see
more through a stone wall than common folk.'</p>
<p>So the young Poins cocked his bonnet more jauntily, and,
setting out up river to Hampton, changed his scarlet clothes for
a grey coat and puritan hose, and in the dark did his errand very
well. He carried a large poke in which he put the larded capons
and the round loaves that the cook sold to him. Later, following
a reed path along the river, he came swiftly down to Isleworth
with his bag on a cord and, in the darkness from beneath the
walls, he slung bag and cord in at Katharine Howard's open
window. For several times this happened before the Lady Mary's
court was moved to Hampton. At first, Katharine had her tremors
to put up with&mdash;and it was only when, each evening, with a
thump and swish, the bag, sweeping out of the darkness, sped
across her floor&mdash;it was only then that Katharine's heart
ceased from pulsing with a flutter. All the while the letters
were out of her own hands she moved on tiptoe, as if she were a
hunter intent on surprising a coy quarry. Nevertheless, it was
impossible for her to believe that this was a dangerous game; it
was impossible to believe that the heavy, unsuspicious and
benevolent man who tried clumsily to gain his daughter's love
with bribes of cakes and kerchiefs&mdash;that this man could be
roused to order her to her death because she conveyed from one
place to another a ball of paper. It was more like a game of
passing a ring from hand to hand behind the players' backs, for
kisses for forfeits if the ring were caught. Nevertheless, this
was treason-felony; yet it was furthering the dear cause of the
saints.</p>
<p>It was on the day on which her uncle Norfolk had sent for her
that the King had his interview with the heretical Dr
Barnes&mdash;nicknamed Antoninus Anglicanus.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary and Katharine Howard and her maid, Margot, were
set in a tiny closet in which there was, in a hole in the wall, a
niche for the King's confessor. The King's own chamber was empty
when they passed through, and they left the door between ajar.
There came a burst of voices, and swiftly the Bishop of
Winchester himself entered their closet. He lifted his black
eyebrows at sight of them, and rubbed his thin hands with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>'Now we shall hear one of Crummock's henchmen swinged,' he
whispered. He raised a finger for them to lend ear and gazed
through the crack of the door. They heard a harsh voice, like a
dog's bay, utter clearly:</p>
<p>'Now goodly goodman Doctor, thou hast spoken certain words at
Paul's Cross. They touched on Justification; thou shalt justify
them to me now.' There came a sound of a man who cleared his
throat&mdash;and then again the heavy voice:</p>
<p>'Why, be not cast down; we spoke as doctor to doctor. Without
a doubt thou art learned. Show then thy learning. Wast brave at
Paul's Cross. Justify now!'</p>
<p>Gardiner, turning from gazing through the door-crack, grinned
at the three women.</p>
<p>'He rated <i>me</i> at Paul's Cross!' he said. 'He thumped me
as I had been a thrashing floor.' They missed the Doctor's
voice&mdash;but the King's came again.</p>
<p>'Why, this is a folly. I am Supreme Head, but I bid thee to
speak.'</p>
<p>There was a long pause till they caught the words.</p>
<p>'Your Highness, I do surrender my learning to your Highness'.'
Then, indeed, there was a great roar:</p>
<p>'Unworthy knave; surrender thyself to none but God. He is
above me as above thee. To none but God.'</p>
<p>There was another long silence, and then the King's voice
again:</p>
<p>'Why, get thee gone. Shalt to gaol for a craven...' And then
came a hissing sound of vexation, a dull thud, and other
noises.</p>
<p>The King's bonnet lay on the floor, and the King himself alone
was padding down the room when they opened their door. His face
was red with rage.</p>
<p>'Why, what a clever fiend is this Cromwell!' the Lady Mary
said; but the Bishop of Winchester was laughing. He pushed Margot
Poins from the closet, but caught Katharine Howard tightly by the
arm.</p>
<p>'Thou shalt write what thy uncle asked of thee!' he commanded
in a low voice, 'an thou do it not, thy cousin shall to gaol! I
have a letter thou didst write me.'</p>
<p>A black despair settled for a moment upon Katharine, but the
King was standing before her. He had walked with inaudible
swiftness up from the other end of the room.</p>
<p>'Didst not hear me argue!' he said, with the vexation of a
great child. 'That poxy knave out-marched me!'</p>
<p>'Why,' the Lady Mary sniggered at him, 'thy brewer's son is
too many for your Highness.'</p>
<p>Henry snarled round at her; but she folded her hands before
her and uttered:</p>
<p>'The brewer's son made your Highness Supreme Head of the
Church. Therefore, the brewer's son hath tied your Highness'
tongue. For who may argue with your Highness?'</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment with a bemused face.</p>
<p>'Very well,' he said.</p>
<p>'The brewer's son should have made your Highness the lowest
suppliant at the Church doors. Then, if, for the astounding of
certain beholders, your Highness were minded to argue, your
Highness should find adversaries.'</p>
<p>The bitter irony of her words made Katharine Howard angry.
This poor, heavy man had other matters for misgiving than to be
badgered by a woman. But the irony was lost upon the King. He
said very simply:</p>
<p>'Why, that is true. If I be the Head, the Tail shall fear to
bandy words with me.' He addressed himself again to Katharine: 'I
am sorry that you did not hear me argue. I am main good at these
arguments.' He looked reflectively at Gardiner and said: 'Friend
Winchester, one day I will cast a main at arguments with thee,
and Kat Howard shall hear. But I doubt thou art little skilled
with thy tongue.'</p>
<p>'Why, I will make a better shift with my tongue than Privy
Seal's men dare,' the bishop said. He glanced under his brows at
Henry, as if he were measuring the ground for a leap.</p>
<p>'The Lady Mary is in the right,' he ventured.</p>
<p>The King, who was thinking out a speech to Katharine, said,
'Anan?' and Gardiner ventured further:</p>
<p>'I hold it for true that this man held his peace, because
Cromwell so commanded it. He is Cromwell's creature, and Cromwell
is minded to escape from the business with a whole skin.'</p>
<p>The King bent him an attentive ear.</p>
<p>'It is to me, in the end, that Privy Seal owes amends,'
Gardiner said rancorously. 'Since it was at me that this man, by
Cromwell's orders, did hurl his foul words at Paul's Cross.'</p>
<p>The King said:</p>
<p>'Why, it is true that thou art more sound in doctrine than is
Privy Seal. What wouldst thou have?'</p>
<p>Gardiner made an immense gesture, as if he would have embraced
the whole world.</p>
<p>Katharine Howard trembled. Here they were, all the three of
them Cromwell's enemies. They were all alone with the King in a
favouring mood, and she was on the point of crying out:</p>
<p>'Give us Privy Seal's head.'</p>
<p>But, in this very moment of his opportunity, Gardiner
faltered. Even the blackness of his hatred could not make him
bold.</p>
<p>'That he should make me amends in public for the foul words
that knave uttered. That they should both sue to me for pardon:
that it should be showed to the world what manner of man it is
that they have dared to flout.'</p>
<p>'Why, goodman Bishop, it shall be done,' the King said, and
Katharine groaned aloud. A clock with two quarter boys beside the
large fireplace chimed the hour of four.</p>
<p>'Aye!' the King commented to Katharine. 'I thought to have had
a pleasanter hour of it. Now you see what manner of life is mine:
I must go to a plaguing council!'</p>
<p>'An I were your Highness,' Katharine cried, 'I would be
avenged on them that marred my pleasures.'</p>
<p>He touched her benevolently upon the cheek.</p>
<p>'Sweetheart,' he said, 'an thou wert me thou'dst do great
things.' He rolled towards the door, heavy and mountainous: with
the latch in his hand, he cried over his shoulder: 'But thou
shalt yet hear me argue!'</p>
<p>'What a morning you have made of this!' Katharine threw at the
bishop. The Lady Mary shrugged her shoulders to her ears and
turned away. Gardiner said:</p>
<p>'Anan?'</p>
<p>'Oh, well your Holiness knows,' Katharine said. 'You might
have come within an ace of having Cromwell down.'</p>
<p>His eyes flashed, and he swallowed with a bitter delight.</p>
<p>'I have him at my feet,' he said. 'He shall do public
reparation to me. You have heard the King say so.'</p>
<p>There were tears of vexation in Katharine's eyes.</p>
<p>'Well I know how it is that this brewer's son has king'd it so
long!' she said. 'An I had been a man it had been his head or
mine.'</p>
<p>Gardiner shook himself like a dog that is newly out of the
water.</p>
<p>'Madam Howard,' he said, 'you are mighty high. I have observed
how the King spoke all his words for your ear. His passions are
beyond words and beyond shame.'</p>
<p>The Lady Mary was almost out of the room, and he came close
enough to speak in Katharine's ears.</p>
<p>'But be you certain that his Highness' passions are not beyond
the reverse of passion, which is jealousy. You have a cousin at
Calais...'</p>
<p>Katharine moved away from him.</p>
<p>'Why, God help you, priest,' she said. 'Do you think you are
the only man that knows that?'</p>
<p>He laughed melodiously, with a great anger.</p>
<p>'But I am the man that knoweth best how to use my knowledge.
Therefore you shall do my will.'</p>
<p>Katharine Howard laughed back at him:</p>
<p>'Where your lordship's will marches with mine I will do it,'
she said. 'But I am main weary of your lordship's threats. You
know the words of Artemidorus?'</p>
<p>Gardiner contained his rage.</p>
<p>'You will write the letter we have asked you to write?'</p>
<p>She laughed again, and faced him, radiant, fair and flushed in
the cheeks.</p>
<p>'In so far as you beg me to write a letter praying the King of
France and the Emperor to abstain from war upon this land, I will
write the letter. But, in so far as that helps forward the
plotting of you and a knave called Throckmorton, I am main sorry
that I must write it.'</p>
<p>The bishop drew back, and uttered:</p>
<p>'Madam Howard, ye are forward.'</p>
<p>'Why, God help your lordship,' she said. 'Where I see little
course for respect I show little. You see I am friends with the
King&mdash;therefore leave you my cousin be. Because I am friends
with the King, who is a man among wolves, I will pray my mistress
to indite a letter that shall save this King some troubles. But,
if you threaten me with my cousin, or my cousin with me, I will
use my friendship with the King as well against you as against
any other.'</p>
<p>Gardiner swallowed in his throat, winked his eyes, and
muttered:</p>
<p>'Why, so you do what we will, it matters little in what spirit
you shall do it.'</p>
<p>'So you and my uncle and Throckmorton keep your feet from my
paths, you may have my leavings,' she said. 'And they will be the
larger part, since I ask little for myself.'</p>
<p>He gave her his episcopal blessing as she followed the Lady
Mary to her rooms.</p>

<p>Her mind was made up&mdash;and she knew that it had been made
up hastily, but she was never one to give much time to doubting.
She wished these men to leave her out of their plots&mdash;but
four men are stronger than one woman. Yet, as her philosophy had
it, you may make a woman your tool, but she will bend in your
hand and strike where she will, for all that. Therefore she must
plot, but not with them.</p>
<p>As soon as she could she found the Lady Mary alone, and,
setting her valour up against the other's dark and rigid figure,
she spoke rapidly:</p>
<p>She would have her lady write to her friends across the sea
that, if Cromwell were ever to fall, they must now stay their
hands against the King: they must diminish their bands,
discontinue their fortifyings and feign even to quarrel amongst
themselves. Otherwise the King must rest firm in his alliance
with Cleves, to counterbalance them.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary raised her eyebrows with a show of insolent
astonishment that was for all the world like the King's.</p>
<p>'You affect my father!' she said. 'Is it not a dainty
plan?'</p>
<p>Katharine brushed past her words with:</p>
<p>'It matters little who affects what thing. The main is that
Privy Seal must be cast down.'</p>
<p>'Carthage must be destroyed, O Cato,' the Lady Mary sneered.
'Ye are peremptory.'</p>
<p>'I am as God made me,' Katharine answered. 'I am for God's
Church...' She had a sharp spasm of impatience. 'Here is a thing
to do, and the one and the other snarl like dogs, each for his
separate ends.'</p>
<p>'Oh, la, la,' the Lady Mary laughed.</p>
<p>'A Howard is as good as any man,' Katharine said. Her
ingenuous face flushed, and she moved her hand to her throat.
'God help me: it is true that I swore to be your woman. But it is
the true province of your woman to lead you to work for justice
and the truth.'</p>
<p>A black malignancy settled upon the face of the princess.</p>
<p>'I have been called bastard,' she said. 'My mother was done to
death.'</p>
<p>'No true man believes you misbegotten,' Katharine answered
hotly.</p>
<p>'Well, it is proclaimed treason, to speak thus,' the Lady Mary
sneered.</p>
<p>'Neither can you give your sainted mother her life again.'
Katharine ignored her words. 'But these actions were not your
father's. It was an ill man forced him to them. The saints be
good to you; is it not time to forgive a sad man that would make
amends? I would have you to write this letter.'</p>
<p>The Lady Mary's lips moved into the curves of a tormenting
smile.</p>
<p>'You plead your lover's cause main well,' she uttered.</p>
<p>Katharine had another motion of impatience.</p>
<p>'Your cause I plead main better,' she said. 'It is certain
that, this man once down, your bastardy should be reversed.'</p>
<p>'I do not ask it,' the Lady Mary said.</p>
<p>'But I ask that you give us peace here, so that the King may
make amends to many that he hath sorely wronged. Do you not see
that the King inclineth to the Church of God? Do you not
see...'</p>
<p>'I see very plainly that I needs must thank you for better
housing,' Mary answered. 'It is certain that my father had never
brought me from that well at Isleworth, had it not been that he
desireth converse with thee at his ease.'</p>
<p>Katharine's lips parted with a hot anger, but before she could
speak the bitter girl said calmly:</p>
<p>'Oh, I have not said thou art his leman. I know my father. His
blood is not hot&mdash;but his ears crave tickling. Tickle them
whilst thou mayest. Have I stayed thee? Have I sent thee from my
room when he did come?'</p>
<p>Katharine cast back the purple hood from over her forehead,
she brushed her hand across her brow, and made herself calm.</p>
<p>'This is a trifling folly,' she said. 'In two words: will your
Highness write me this letter?'</p>
<p>'Then, in four words,' Mary answered, 'my Highness cares
not.'</p>
<p>The mobile brows above Katharine's blue eyes made a hard
straight line.</p>
<p>'An you will not,' she brought out, 'I will leave your
Highness' service. I will get me away to Calais, where my father
is.'</p>
<p>'Why, you will never do that,' the Lady Mary said; 'you have
tasted blood here.'</p>
<p>Katharine hung her head and meditated for a space.</p>
<p>'No, before God,' she said earnestly, 'I think you judge me
wrong. I think I am not as you think me. I think that I do seek
no ends of my own.'</p>
<p>The Lady Mary raised her eyebrows and snickered
ironically.</p>
<p>'But of this I am very certain,' Katharine said. She spoke
more earnestly, seeming to plead: 'If I thought that I were grown
a self-seeker, by Mars who changed Alectryon to a cock, and by
Pallas Athene who changed Arachne to a spider&mdash;if I were so
changed, I would get me gone from this place. But here is a thing
that I may do. If you will aid me to do it I will stay. If you
will not I will get me gone.'</p>
<p>'Good wench,' Mary answered, 'let us say for the sake of peace
that thou art honest...Yet I have sworn by other gods than thine
that never will I do aught that shall be of aid, comfort or
succour to my father's cause.'</p>
<p>'Take back your oaths!' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>'For thee!' Mary said. 'Wench, thou hast brought me food: thou
hast served me in the matter of letters. I might only with great
trouble get another so to serve me. But, by Mars and Pallas and
all the constellation of the deities, thou mightest get thee to
Hell's flames or ever I would take back an oath.'</p>
<p>'Oh, madness,' Katharine cried out. 'Oh, mad frenzy of one
whom the gods would destroy.' Three times before she had reined
in her anger: now she stretched out her hands with her habitual
gesture of pitiful despair. Her eyes looked straight before her,
and, as she inclined her knees, the folds of her grey dress bent
round her on the floor.</p>
<p>'Here I have pleaded with you, and you have gibed me with the
love of the King. Here I have been earnest with you, and you have
mocked. God help me!' she sobbed, with a catch in her throat.
'Here is rest, peace and the blessing of God offered to this
land. Here is a province that is offered back to the Mother of
God and the dear hosts of heaven. Here might we bring an erring
King back to the right way, a sinful man back unto his God. But
you, for a parcel of wrongs of your own...'</p>
<p>'Now hold thy peace,' Mary said, between anger and irony.
'Here is a matter of a farthing or two. Be the letter written,
and kiss upon it.'</p>
<p>Katharine stayed herself in the tremor of her emotions, and
the Lady Mary said drily:</p>
<p>'Be the letter written. But thou shalt write it. I have sworn
that I will do nothing to give this King ease.'</p>
<p>'But my writing...' Katharine began.</p>
<p>'Thou shalt write,' Mary interrupted her harshly. 'If thou
wilt have this King at peace for a space that Cromwell may fall,
why I am at one with thee. For this King is such a palterer that
without this knave at his back I might have had him down ten
years ago. Therefore, thou shalt write, and I will countersign
the words.'</p>
<p>'That were to write thyself,' Katharine said.</p>
<p>'Good wench,' the Lady Mary said. 'I am thy slave: but take
what thou canst get.'</p>
<hr>
<p>Towards six of the next day young Poins clambered in at
Katharine Howard's window and stood, pale, dripping with rain and
his teeth chattering, between Cicely Elliott and her old
knight.</p>
<p>'The letter,' he said. 'They have taken thy letter. My
advancement is at an end!' And he fell upon the floor.</p>
<p>Going jauntily along the Hampton Street, he had been filled,
that afternoon, with visions of advancement. Drifts of rain hid
the osiers across the river and made the mud ooze in over the
laces of his shoes. The tall white and black house, where the
Emperor's ambassador had his lodgings, leaned in all its newness
over the path, and the water from its gutters fell right into the
river, making a bridge above a passer's head. The little
cookshop, with its feet, as it were, in the water, made a small
hut nestling down beneath the shadow of the great house. It was
much used by Chapuys' grooms, trencher boys and javelin men,
because the cook was a Fleming, and had a comfortable hand in
stewing eels.</p>
<p>Ned Poins must pass the ambassador's house in his walk, but in
under the dark archway there stood four men sheltering, in grey
cloaks that reached to their feet. Stepping gingerly on the brick
causeway that led down to the barge-steps, they came and stood
before the young man, three being in a line together and one a
little to the side. He hardly looked at them because he was
thinking: 'This afternoon I will say to my sister Margot:
"Fifteen letters I have carried for thy great persons. I have
carried them with secrecy and speed. Now, by Cock, I will be
advanced to ancient."' He had imagined his sister pleading with
him to be patient, and himself stamping with his foot and
swearing that he would be advanced instantly.</p>
<p>The solitary one of the four men barred his way, and said:</p>
<p>'No further! You go back with us!'</p>
<p>Poins swung his cape back and touched his sword-hilt.</p>
<p>'You will have your neck stretched if you stay me,' he
said.</p>
<p>The other loosened his cloak which had covered him up to the
nose. He showed a mocking mouth, a long red beard that blew aside
in a wild gust of the weather, and displayed on his breast the
lion badge of the Lord Privy Seal.</p>
<p>'An you will not come you shall be carried!' he said.</p>
<p>'Nick Throckmorton,' Poins answered, 'I will slit thy weazand!
I am on a greater errand than thine.'</p>
<p>It was strong in his mind that he was bearing a letter for the
King's Highness. The other three laid hands swiftly upon him, and
a wet cloak flapped over his head. They had his elbows bound
together behind his back before his eyes again had the river and
the muddy path to look upon. Throckmorton grinned sardonically,
and they forced him along in the mud. The rain fell down; his
cloak was gone. And then a great dread entered into his simple
mind. It kept running through his head:</p>
<p>'I was carrying a letter for the King&mdash;I was carrying a
letter for the King!' but his addled brains would bear his
thoughts no further until he was cast loose in the very room of
Privy Seal himself. They had used him very roughly, and he
staggered back against the wall, gasping for breath and weeping
with rage and fear.</p>
<p>Privy Seal stood before the fire; his eyes lifted a little but
he said nothing at all. Throckmorton took a dagger from the chain
round his neck, and cut the bag from the boy's girdle. Still
smiling sardonically, he placed it in Privy Seal's fat hands.</p>
<p>'Here is the great secret,' he said. 'I took it even in the
gates of Chapuys.'</p>
<p>Privy Seal started a little and cried, 'Ah!' The boy would
have spoken, but he feared even to cry out; his eyes were
starting from his head, and his breath came in great gusts that
shook him. Privy Seal sat down in a large chair by the fire and
considered for a moment. Then he slowly drew out the crumpled
ball of paper. Here at last he held the Lady Mary utterly in his
power; here at last, at the eleventh hour, he had a new
opportunity to show to the King his vigilance, his power, and how
necessary he was to the safety of the realm. He had been
beginning to despair; Winchester was to confess the King that
night. Now he held them...</p>
<p>'I have been diligent,' Throckmorton said. 'I had had the Lady
Mary set in the room that has a spy-hole beside a rose in the
ceiling. So I saw the writing of this letter.'</p>
<p>Cromwell said, 'Ah!' He had pulled the paper apart, smoothed
it across his knee, and looked at it attentively. Then he held it
close to the fire, for no blank paper could trouble the Privy
Seal. This was a child's trick at best.</p>
<p>In the warmth faint lines became visible on the paper; they
darkened and darkened beneath his intent eyes. Behind his back
Throckmorton, with his immense beard and sardonic eyes, rubbed
his hands and smiled. Privy Seal's fingers trembled, but he gave
no further sign.</p>
<p>Suddenly he cried, 'What!' and then, 'Both women! both...'</p>
<p>He fell back in the chair, and the sudden quaver of his face,
the deep breath that he drew, showed his immense joy.</p>
<p>'God of my heart! Both women!' he said again.</p>
<p>The rain hurled itself with a great rustling against the
casement. Though it was so early, it was already nearly dark.
Cromwell sat up suddenly and pointed at the boy.</p>
<p>'Take that rat away!' he said. 'Set him in irons, and come
back here.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton caught the quivering boy by the ear and led him
out at the door. He took him down a small stair that opened
behind a curtain. At the stair-foot he pulled open a small, heavy
door. He still held his dagger, and he cut the ropes that tied
Poins' elbows. With a sudden alacrity and a grin of malice he
kicked him violently.</p>
<p>'Get you gone to your mistress,' he said.</p>
<p>Poins stood for a moment, wavering on his feet. He slipped
miserably in the mud of the park, and suddenly he ran. His grey,
straining form disappeared round the end of the dark buildings,
and then Throckmorton waved a hand at the grey sky and laughed
noiselessly. Thomas Cromwell was making notes in his tablets when
his spy re-entered the room, with the rain-drops glistening in
his beard.</p>
<p>'Here are some notes for you,' Cromwell said. He rose to his
feet with a swift and intense energy. 'I have given you five
farms. Now I go to the King.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton spoke gently.</p>
<p>'You are over-eager,' he said. 'It is early to go to the
King's Highness. We may find much more yet.'</p>
<p>'It is already late,' Cromwell said.</p>
<p>'Sir,' Throckmorton urged, 'consider that the King is much
affected to this lady. Consider that this letter contains nothing
that is treasonable; rather it urges peace upon the King's
enemies.'</p>
<p>'Aye,' said Cromwell; 'but it is written covertly to the
King's enemies.'</p>
<p>'That, it is true, is a treason,' Throckmorton said; 'but it
is very certain that the Lady Mary hath written letters very much
more hateful. By questioning this boy that we have in gaol, by
gaoling this Lady Katharine&mdash;why, we shall put her to the
thumbscrews!&mdash;by gaol and by thumbscrew, we shall gar her to
set her hand to another make of confession. Then you may go to
the King's Highness.'</p>
<p>'Nick Throckmorton,' Cromwell said, 'Winchester hath to-night
the King's ear...'</p>
<p>'Sir,' Throckmorton answered, and a tremble in his calm voice
showed his eagerness, 'I beseech you to give my words your
thoughts. Winchester hath the King's ear for the moment; but I
will get you letters wherein these ladies shall reveal Winchester
for the traitor that we know him to be. Listen to me...' He
paused and let his crafty eyes run over his master's face. 'Let
this matter be for an hour. See you, you shall make a warrant to
take this Lady Katharine.'</p>
<p>He paused and appeared to reflect.</p>
<p>'In an hour she shall be here. Give me leave to use my
thumbscrews...'</p>
<p>'Aye, but Winchester,' Cromwell said.</p>
<p>'Why,' Throckmorton answered confidently, 'in an hour, too,
Winchester shall be with the King in the King's Privy Chapel.
There will be a make of prayers; ten minutes to that. There shall
be Gardiner talking to the King against your lordship; ten
minutes to that. And, Winchester being craven, it shall cost him
twice ten minutes to come to begging your lordship's head of the
King, if ever he dare to beg it. But he never shall.'</p>
<p>Cromwell said, 'Well, well!'</p>
<p>'There we have forty minutes,' Throckmorton said. He licked
his lips and held his long beard in his hand carefully, as if it
had been a bird. 'But give me ten minutes to do my will upon this
lady's body, and ten to write down what she shall confess. Then,
if it take your lordship ten minutes to dress yourself finely,
you shall have still ten in which you shall show the King how his
Winchester is traitor to him.'</p>
<p>Cromwell considered for a minute; his lips twitched cautiously
the one above the other.</p>
<p>'This is a great matter,' he said. He paused again. 'If this
lady should not confess! And it is very certain that the King
affects her.'</p>
<p>'Give me ten minutes of her company,' the spy answered.</p>
<p>Cromwell considered again.</p>
<p>'You are very certain,' he said; and then:</p>
<p>'Wilt thou stake thy head upon it?'</p>
<p>Throckmorton wagged his beard slowly up and down.</p>
<p>'Thy head and beard!' Cromwell repeated. He struck his hands
briskly together. 'It is thine own asking. God help thee if thou
failest!'</p>
<p>'I will lay nothing to your lordship's door,' Throckmorton
said eagerly.</p>
<p>'God knows!' Cromwell said. 'No man that hath served me have I
deserted. So it is that no one hath betrayed me. But thou shalt
take this lady without warrant from my hand.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton nodded.</p>
<p>'If thou shalt wring avowal from her thou shalt be the
wealthiest commoner of England,' Cromwell said. 'But I will not
be here. Nay, thou shalt take her to thine own rooms. I will not
be seen in this matter. And if thou fail...'</p>
<p>'Sir, I stand more sure of my succeeding than ever your
lordship stood,' Throckmorton answered him.</p>
<p>'It is not I that shall betray thee if thou fail,' Cromwell
answered. 'Get thee gone swiftly...' He took the jewelled badge
from his cap that lay on the table. 'Thou hast served me well,'
he said; 'take this in case I never see thy face again.'</p>
<p>'Oh, you shall see my triumph!' Throckmorton answered.</p>
<p>He bent himself nearly double as he passed through the
door.</p>
<p>Cromwell sat down in his great chair, and his eyes gazed at
nothing through the tapestry of his room.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>In Katharine Howard's room they had the form of the boy, wet,
grey, and mud-draggled, lying on the ground between them. Cicely
Elliott rose in her chair: it was not any part of her nature to
succour fainting knaves, and she let him stay where he was. Old
Rochford raised his hands, and cried out to Katharine:</p>
<p>'You have been sending letters again!'</p>
<p>Katharine stood absolutely still. They had taken her
letters!</p>
<p>She neither spoke nor stirred. Slowly, as she remembered that
this was indeed a treason, that here without doubt was death,
that she was outwitted, that she was now the chattel of whosoever
held her letters&mdash;as point after point came into her mind,
the blood fled from her face. Cicely Elliott sat down in her
chair again, and whilst the two sat watching her in the falling
dusk they seemed to withdraw themselves from her world of
friendship and to become spectators. Ten minutes before she would
have laughed at this nightmare: it had seemed to her impossible
that her letters could have been taken. So many had got in safety
to their bourne. Now...</p>
<p>'Who has my letter?' she cried.</p>
<p>How did she know what was to arise: who was to strike the
blow: whence it would come: what could she still do to palliate
its effects? The boy lay motionless upon the floor, his face
sideways upon the boards.</p>
<p>'Who? Who? Who?' she cried. She wrung her hands, and kneeling,
with a swift violence shook him by the coat near his neck. His
head struck the boards and he fell back, motionless still, and
like a dead man.</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott looked around her in the darkening room: beside
the ambry there hung a brush of feathers such as they used for
the dusting of their indoor clothes. She glided and hopped to the
brush and back to the hearth: thrust the feathers into the coals
and stood again, the brush hissing and spluttering, before
Katharine on her knees.</p>
<p>'Dust the springald's face,' she tittered.</p>
<p>At the touch of the hot feathers and the acrid perfume in his
nostrils, the boy sneezed, stirred and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>'Who has my letter?' Katharine cried.</p>
<p>The lids opened wide in amazement, he saw her face and
suddenly closed his eyes, and lay down with his face to the
floor. A spasm of despair brought his knees up to his chin, his
cropped yellow head went backwards and forwards upon the
boards.</p>
<p>'I have lost my advancement,' he sobbed. 'I have lost my
advancement.' A smell of strong liquors diffused itself from
him.</p>
<p>'Oh beast,' Katharine cried from her knees, 'who hath my
letter?'</p>
<p>'I have lost my advancement,' he moaned.</p>
<p>She sprang from her feet to the fireplace and caught the iron
tongs with which they were wont to place pieces of wood upon the
fire. She struck him a hard blow upon the arm between the
shoulder and elbow.</p>
<p>'Sot!' she cried. 'Tell me! Tell me!'</p>
<p>He rose to his seat and held his arms to protect his head and
eyes. When he stuttered:</p>
<p>'Nick Throckmorton had it!' her hand fell powerless to her
side; but when he added: 'He gave it to Privy Seal!' she cast the
tongs into the brands to save herself from cleaving open his
head.</p>
<p>'God!' she said drily, 'you have lost your advancement. And I
mine!... And I mine.'</p>
<p>She wavered to her chair by the hearth-place, and covered her
face with her white hands.</p>
<p>The boy got to his knees, then to his feet; he staggered
backwards into the arras beside the door.</p>
<p>'God's curse on you!' he said. 'Where is Margot? That I may
beat her! That I may beat her as you have beaten me.' He waved
his hand with a tipsy ferocity and staggered through the
door.</p>
<p>'Was it for this I did play the &mdash;&mdash; for thee?' he
menaced her. 'By Cock! I will swinge that harlot!'</p>
<p>The old knight got to his feet. He laid his hand heavily upon
Cicely Elliott's shoulder.</p>
<p>'Best begone from here,' he said, 'this is no quarrel of mine
or thine.'</p>
<p>'Why, get thee gone, old boy,' she laughed over her shoulder.
'Seven of my men have been done to death in such like marlocks. I
would not have thee die as they did.'</p>
<p>'Come with me,' he said in her ear. 'I have dropped my lance.
Never shall I ride to horse again. I would not lose thee; art all
I have.'</p>
<p>'Why, get thee gone for a brave old boy,' she said. 'I will
come ere the last pynot has chattered its last chatter.'</p>
<p>'It is no light matter,' he answered. 'I am Rochford of
Bosworth Hedge. But I have lost lance and horse and manhood. I
will not lose my dandery thing too.'</p>
<p>Katharine Howard sat, a dark figure in the twilight, with the
fire shining upon her hands that covered her face. Cicely Elliott
looked at her and stirred.</p>
<p>'Why,' she said, 'I have lost father and mother and men-folk
and sister. But my itch to know I will not lose, if I pay my head
for the price. I would give a silken gown to know this tale.'</p>
<p>Katharine Howard uncovered her face; it shewed white even in
the rays of the fire. One finger raised itself to a level with
her temple.</p>
<p>'Listen!' she uttered. They heard through the closed door a
dull thud, metallic and hard&mdash;and another after four great
beats of their hearts.</p>
<p>'Pikestaves!' the old knight groaned. His mouth fell open.
Katharine Howard shrieked; she sprang to the clothes press, to
the window&mdash;and then to the shadows beside the fireplace
where she cowered and sobbed. The door swung back: a great man
stood in the half light and cried out:</p>
<p>'The Lady Katharine Howard.'</p>
<p>The old knight raised his hands above his head&mdash;but
Cicely Elliott turned her back to the fire.</p>
<p>'What would you with me?' she asked. Her face was all in
shadows.</p>
<p>'I have a warrant to take the Lady Katharine.'</p>
<p>Cicely Elliott screamed out:</p>
<p>'Me! Me! Ah God! ah God!'</p>
<p>She shrank back; she waved her hands, then suddenly she caught
at the coif above her head and pulled forward the tail of her
hood till, like a veil, it covered her face.</p>
<p>'Let me not be seen!' she uttered hoarsely.</p>
<p>The old knight's impatient desires burst through his
terror.</p>
<p>'Nick Throckmorton,' he bleated, 'yon mad wench of
mine...'</p>
<p>But the large man cut in on his words with a harsh and
peremptory vehemence.</p>
<p>'It is very dark. You cannot see who I be. Thank your God I
cannot see whether you be a man who fought by a hedge or no.
There shall be reports written of this. Hold your peace.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless the old man made a spluttering noise of one about
to speak.</p>
<p>'Hold your peace,' Throckmorton said roughly, again, 'I cannot
see your face. Can you walk, madam, and very fast?'</p>
<p>He caught her roughly by the wrist and they passed out, twin
blots of darkness, at the doorway. The clank of the pike-staves
sounded on the boards without, and old Rochford was tearing at
his white hairs in the little light from the fire.</p>
<p>Katharine Howard ran swiftly from the shadow of the
fireplace.</p>
<p>'Give me time, till they have passed the stairhead,' she
whispered. 'For pity! for pity.'</p>
<p>'For pity,' he muttered. 'This is to stake one's last years
upon woman.' He turned upon her, and his white face and pale blue
eyes glinted at her hatefully.</p>
<p>'What pity had Cicely Elliott upon me then?'</p>
<p>'Till they are out of the gate,' she pleaded, 'that I may get
me gone.'</p>
<p>At her back she was cut off from the night and the rain by a
black range of corridors. She had never been through them because
they led to rooms of men that she did not know. But, down the
passage and down the stairway was the only exit to the rest of
the palace and the air. She threw open her press so that the
hinges cracked. She caught her cloak and she caught her hood. She
had nowhither to run&mdash;but there she was at the end of a
large trap. Their footsteps as they receded echoed and whispered
up the stairway from below.</p>
<p>'For pity!' she pleaded. 'For pity! I will go miles away
before it is morning.'</p>
<p>He had been wavering on his feet, torn backwards and forwards
literally and visibly, between desire and fear, but at the sound
of her voice he shook with rage.</p>
<p>'Curses on you that ever you came here,' he said. 'If you go
free I shall lose my dandling thing.'</p>
<p>He made as if to catch her by the wrist; but changing his
purpose, ran from the room, shouting:</p>
<p>'Ho la!...Throck...morton...That...is not...' His voice was
lost in reverberations and echoes.</p>
<p>In the darkness she stood desolately still. She thought of how
Romans would have awaited their captors: the ideal of a still and
worthy surrender was part of her blood. Here was the end of her
cord; she must fold her hands. She folded her hands. After all,
she thought, what was death?</p>
<p>'It is to pass from the hardly known to the hardly unknown.'
She quoted Lucretius. It was very dark all around her: the noises
of distant outcries reached her dimly.</p>
<p>'<i>Vix ignotum</i>,' she repeated mechanically, and then the
words: 'Surely it were better to pass from the world of unjust
judges to sit with the mighty...'</p>
<p>A great burst of sound roamed, vivid and alive, from the
distant stairhead. She started and cried out. Then there came the
sound of feet hastily stepping the stair treads, coming upwards.
A man was coming to lay hands upon her!</p>
<p>Then, suddenly she was running, breathing hard, filled with
the fear of a man's touch. At last, in front of her was a pale,
leaded window; she turned to the right; she was in a long
corridor; she ran; it seemed that she ran for miles. She was
gasping, 'For pity! for pity!' to the saints of heaven. She
stayed to listen; there was a silence, then a voice in the
distance. She listened and listened. The feet began to run again,
the sole of one shoe struck the ground hard, the other scarcely
sounded. She could not tell whether they came towards her or no.
Then she began to run again, for it was certain now that they
came towards her. As if at the sound of her own feet the
footfalls came faster. Desperately, she lifted one foot and tore
her shoe off, then the other. She half overbalanced, and catching
at the arras to save herself, it fell with a rustling sound. She
craved for darkness; when she ran there was a pale shimmer of
night&mdash;but the aperture of an arch tempted her. She ran and
sprang, upwards, in a very black, narrow stairway.</p>
<p>At the top there was&mdash;light! and the passage ended in a
window. A great way off, a pine torch was stuck in a wall, a
knave in armour sat on the floor beneath it&mdash;the heavy
breathing was coming up the stairway. She crept on tiptoe across
the passage to the curtains beside the casement.</p>
<p>Then a man was within touch of her hand, panting hard, and he
stood still as if he were out of breath. His voice called in
gasps to the knave at the end of the gallery:</p>
<p>'Ho...There...Simon!...Peter!...Hath one passed that way?'</p>
<p>The voice came back:</p>
<p>'No one! The King comes!'</p>
<p>He moved a step down the corridor and, as he was lifting the
arras a little way away, she moved to peep through a crack in the
curtain.</p>
<p>It was Throckmorton! The distant light glinted along his
beard. At the slight movement she made he was agog to listen, so
that his ears appeared to be pricked up. He moved swiftly back to
cover the stairhead. In the distance, beneath the light, the
groom was laying cards upon the floor between his parted
legs.</p>
<p>Throckmorton whispered suddenly:</p>
<p>'I can hear thee breathe. Art near! Listen!'</p>
<p>She leant back against the wall and trembled.</p>
<p>'This seems like a treachery,' he whispered. 'It is none.
Listen? There is little time! Do you hear me?'</p>
<p>She kept her peace.</p>
<p>'Do you hear me?' he asked. 'Before God, I am true to
you.'</p>
<p>When still she did not speak he hissed with vexation and
raised one hand above his head. He sank his forehead in swift
meditation.</p>
<p>'Listen,' he said again. 'To take you I have only to tear down
this arras. Do you hear?'</p>
<p>He bared his head once more and said aloud to himself,</p>
<p>'But perhaps she is even in the chapel.'</p>
<p>He stepped across the corridor, lifted a latch and looked in
at double doors that were just beside her. Then, swiftly, he
moved back once more to cover the stairhead.</p>
<p>'God! God! God!' she heard him mutter between his teeth.</p>
<p>'Listen!' he said again. 'Listen! listen! listen!' The words
seemed to form part of an eager, hissed refrain. He was trembling
with haste.</p>
<p>He began to press the arras, along the wall towards her, with
his finger tips. Her breast sank with a sickening fall. Then,
suddenly, he started back again; she could not understand why he
did not come further&mdash;then she noticed that he was afraid,
still, to leave the stairhead.</p>
<p>But why did he not call his men to him? He had a whole army at
his back.</p>
<p>He was peering into the shadows&mdash;and something familiar
in the poise of his head, his intent gaze, the line of his
shoulders, as you may see a cat's outlined against a lighted
doorway, filled her with an intense lust for revenge. This man
had wormed himself into her presence: he was a traitor over and
over again. And he had fooled her! He had made her believe that
he was lover to her. He had made her believe, and he had fooled
her. He had shown her letter to Privy Seal.</p>
<p>After the night in the cellar she had had the end of her
crucifix sharpened till it was needle-pointed. She trembled with
eagerness. This foul carrion beast had fooled her that he might
get her more utterly in his power. For this he had brought her
down. He would have her to himself&mdash;in some dungeon of Privy
Seal's. Her fair hopes ended in this filth...</p>
<p>He was muttering:</p>
<p>'Listen if you be there! Before God, Katharine Howard, I am
true to you. Listen! Listen!'</p>
<p>His hand shivered, turned against the light. He was hearkening
to some distant sound. He was looking away.</p>
<p>She tore the arras aside and sprang at him with her hand on
high. But, at the sharp sound of the tearing cloth, he started to
one side and the needle point that should have pierced his face
struck softly in at his shoulder or thereabouts. He gave a sharp
hiss of pain...</p>
<p>She was wrestling with him then. One of his hands was hot
across her mouth, the other held her throat.</p>
<p>'Oh fool!' his voice sounded. 'Bide you still.' He snorted
with fury and held her to him. The embroidery on his chest
scraped her knuckles as she tried to strike upwards at his face.
Her crucifix had fallen. He strove to muffle her with his elbows,
but with a blind rage of struggle she freed her wrists and, in
the darkness, struck where she thought his mouth would be.</p>
<p>Then his hand over her mouth loosened and set free her great
scream. It rang down the corridor and seemed to petrify his grasp
upon her. His fingers loosened&mdash;and again she was running,
bent forward, crying out, in a vast thirst for mere flight.</p>
<p>As she ran, a red patch before her eyes, distant and clear
beneath the torch, took the form of the King. Her cries were
still loud, but they died in her throat...</p>
<p>He was standing still with his fingers in his ears.</p>
<p>'Dear God,' she cried, 'they have laid hands upon me. They
have laid hands upon me.' And she pressed her fingers hard across
her throat as if to wipe away the stain of Throckmorton's
touch.</p>
<p>The King lifted his fingers from his ears.</p>
<p>'Bones of Jago,' he cried, 'what new whimsy is this?'</p>
<p>'They have laid hands upon me,' she cried and fell upon her
knees.</p>
<p>'Why,' he said, 'here is a day nightmare. I know all your tale
of a letter. Come now, pretty one. Up, pretty soul.' He bent over
benevolently and stroked her hand.</p>
<p>'These dark passages are frightening to maids. Up now, pretty.
I was thinking of thee.</p>
<p>'Who the devil shall harm thee?' he muttered again. 'This is
mine own house. Come, pray with me. Prayer is a very soothing
thing. I was bound to pray. I pray ever at nightfall. Up now.
Come&mdash;pray, pray, pray!'</p>
<p>His heavy benevolence for a moment shed a calmness upon the
place. She rose, and pressing back the hair from her forehead,
saw the long, still corridor, the guard beneath the torch, the
doors of the chapel.</p>
<p>She said to herself pitifully: 'What comes next?' She was too
wearied to move again.</p>
<p>Suddenly the King said:</p>
<p>'Child, you did well to come to me, when you came in the
stables.'</p>
<p>She leaned against the tapestry upon the wall to listen to
him.</p>
<p>'It is true,' he admitted, 'that you have men that hate you
and your house. The Bishop of Winchester did show me a letter you
wrote. I do pardon it in you. It was well written.'</p>
<p>'Ah,' she uttered wearily, 'so you say now. But you shall
change your mind ere morning.'</p>
<p>'Body of God, no,' he answered. 'My mind is made up concerning
you. Let us call a truce to these things. It is my hour for
prayer. Let us go to pray.'</p>
<p>Knowing how this King's mind would change from hour to hour,
she had little hope in his words. Nevertheless slowly it came
into her mind that if she were ever to act, now that he was in
the mood was the very hour. But she knew nothing of the coil in
which she now was. Yet without the King she could do nothing; she
was in the hands of other men: of Throckmorton, of Privy Seal, of
God knew whom.</p>
<p>'Sir,' she said, 'at the end of this passage stood a man.'</p>
<p>The King looked past her into the gloom.</p>
<p>'He stands there still,' he said. 'He is tying his arm with a
kerchief. He looks like one Throckmorton.'</p>
<p>'Then, if he have not run,' she said. 'Call him here. He has
had my knife in his arm. He holds a letter of mine.'</p>
<p>His neck stiffened suddenly.</p>
<p>'You have been writing amorous epistles?' he muttered.</p>
<p>'God knows there was naught of love,' she answered. 'Do you
bid him unpouch it.' She closed her eyes; she was done with this
matter.</p>
<p>Henry called:</p>
<p>'Ho, you, approach!' and as through the shadows Throckmorton's
shoes clattered on the boards he held out a thickly gloved hand.
Throckmorton made no motion to put anything into it, and the King
needs must speak.</p>
<p>'This lady's letter,' he muttered.</p>
<p>Throckmorton bowed his head.</p>
<p>'Privy Seal holdeth it,' he answered.</p>
<p>'You are all of a make,' the King said gloomily. 'Can no woman
write a letter but what you will be of it?'</p>
<p>'Sir,' Throckmorton said, 'this lady would have Privy Seal
down.'</p>
<p>'Well, she shall have him down,' the King threatened him. 'And
thee! and all of thy train!'</p>
<p>'I do lose much blood,' Throckmorton answered. 'Pray you let
me finish the binding of my arm.'</p>
<p>He took between his teeth one end of his kerchief and the
other in his right hand, and pulled and knotted with his head
bent.</p>
<p>'Make haste!' the King grumbled. 'Here! Lend room.' And
himself he took one end of the knot and pulled it tight,
breathing heavily.</p>
<p>'Now speak,' he said. 'I am not one made for the healing of
cripples.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton brushed the black blood from the furs on his
sleeve, using his gloves.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he said, 'I am in pain and my knees tremble, because I
have lost much blood. I were more minded to take to my pallet.
Nevertheless, I am a man that do bear no grudge, being rather a
very proper man, and one intent to do well to my country and its
Lord.'</p>
<p>'Sir,' the King said, 'if you are minded to speak ill of this
lady you had best had no mouth.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton fell upon one knee.</p>
<p>'Grant me the boon to be her advocate,' he said. 'And let me
speak swiftly, for Privy Seal shall come soon and the Bishop of
Winchester.'</p>
<p>'Ass that you are,' the King said, 'fetch me a stool from the
chapel, that I may not stand all the day.'</p>
<p>Throckmorton ran swiftly to the folding doors.</p>
<p>'&mdash;Winchester comes,' he said hurriedly, when he
returned.</p>
<p>The King sat himself gingerly down upon the three-legged
stool, balancing himself with his legs wide apart. A dark face
peered from the folding doors: a priest's shape came out from
them.</p>
<p>'Cousin of Winchester,' the King called, 'bide where you
be.'</p>
<p>He had the air of a man hardly intent on what the spy could
say. He had already made up his mind as to what he himself was to
say to Katharine.</p>
<p>'Sir,' Throckmorton said, 'this lady loves you well, and most
well she loveth your Highness' daughter. Most well, therefore,
doth she hate Privy Seal. I, as your Highness knoweth, have for
long well loved Privy Seal. Now I love others better&mdash;the
common weal and your great and beneficent Highness. As I have
told your Highness, this Lady Katharine hath laboured very
heartily to bring the Lady Mary to love you. But that might not
be. Now, your Highness being minded to give to these your happy
realms a lasting peace, was intent that the Lady Mary should
write a letter, very urgently, to your Highness' foes urging them
to make a truce with this realm, so that your Highness might cast
out certain evil men and then better purge this realm of certain
false doctrines.'</p>
<p>Amazement, that was almost a horror, made Katharine open wide
the two hands that hung at her side.</p>
<p>'You!' she cried to the King. '<i>You</i> would have that
letter written?'</p>
<p>He looked at her with a heavy astonishment.</p>
<p>'Wherefore not?' he asked.</p>
<p>'My God! my God!' she said. 'And I have suffered!'</p>
<p>Her first feeling of horror at this endless plot hardly gave
way to relief. She had been used as a tool; she had done the
work. But she had been betrayed.</p>
<p>'Aye, would I have the letter written,' the King said. 'What
could better serve my turn? Would I not have mine enemies stay
their arming against me?'</p>
<p>'Then I have written your letter,' she said bitterly. 'That is
why I should be gaoled.'</p>
<p>The King's look of heavy astonishment did not leave him.</p>
<p>'Why, sweetheart, shalt be made a countess,' he said. 'Y' have
done more in this than I or any man could do with my
daughter.'</p>
<p>'Wherefore, then, should this man have gaoled me?' Katharine
asked.</p>
<p>The King turned his heavy gaze upon Throckmorton. The big
man's eyes had a sunny and devious smile.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he said, 'this is a subtle conceit of mine, since I am
a subtle man. If I am set a task I do it ever in mine own way.
Here there was a task...</p>
<p>'Pray you let me sit upon the floor!' he craved. 'My legs
begin to fail.'</p>
<p>The King made a small motion with his hand, and the great man,
letting himself down by one hand against the arras, leaned back
his head and stretched his long legs half across the
corridor.</p>
<p>'In ten minutes Privy Seal shall be here with the letter,' he
said. 'My head swims, but I will be brief.'</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and passed his hand across his
forehead.</p>
<p>'I do a task ever in mine own way,' he began again. 'Here am
I. Here is Privy Seal. Your Highness is minded to know what
passes in the mind of Privy Seal. Well: I am Privy Seal's
servant. Now, if I am to come at the mind of Privy Seal, I must
serve him well. In this thing I might seem to serve him main
well. Listen...'</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and then spoke again.</p>
<p>'Your Highness would have this letter written by the Lady
Mary. That, with the help of this fair dame, was a thing passing
easy. But neither your Highness nor Privy Seal knew the channel
through which these letters passed. Yet I discovered it. Now,
think I to myself: here is a secret for which Privy Seal would
give his head. Therefore, how better may I ingratiate myself with
Privy Seal than by telling him this same fine secret?'</p>
<p>'Oh, devil!' Katharine Howard called out. 'Who was Judas to
thee?'</p>
<p>Throckmorton raised his head, and winked upwards at her.</p>
<p>'It was a fine device?' he asked. 'Why, I am a subtle man...Do
you not see?' he said. 'The King's Highness would have me keep
the confidence of Privy Seal that I may learn out his secrets.
How better should I keep that confidence than by seeming to
betray your secret to Privy Seal?</p>
<p>'It was very certain,' he added, 'that Privy Seal should give
a warrant to gaol your la'ship. But it was still more certain
that the King's Highness should pardon you. Therefore no bones
should have been broken. And I did come myself to take you to a
safe place, and to enlighten you as to the comedy.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Judas, Judas,' she cried.</p>
<p>'Could you but have trusted me,' he said reproachfully, 'you
had spared yourself a mad canter and me a maimed arm.'</p>
<p>'Why, you have done well,' the King said heavily. 'But you
speak this lady too saucily.'</p>
<p>He was in a high and ponderous good humour, but he stayed to
reflect for a moment, with his head on one side, to see what he
had gained.</p>
<p>'This letter is written,' he said. 'But Cromwell holdeth it.
How, then, has it profited me?'</p>
<p>'Why,' Throckmorton said, 'Privy Seal shall come to bring the
letter to your Highness; your Highness shall deliver it to me; I
to the cook; the cook to the ambassador; the ambassador to the
kings. And so the kings shall be prayed, by your daughter, whom
they heed, to stay all unfriendly hands against your
Highness.'</p>
<p>'You are a shrewd fellow,' the King said.</p>
<p>'I have a shrewd ache in the head,' the spy answered. 'If you
would give me a boon, let me begone.'</p>
<p>The King got stiffly up from his stool, and, bracing his feet
firmly, gave the spy one hand. The tall man shook upon his
legs.</p>
<p>'Why, I have done well!' he said, smiling. 'Now Privy Seal
shall take me for his very bedfellow, until it shall please your
Highness to deal with him for good and all.'</p>
<p>He went, waveringly, along the corridor, brushing the hangings
with his shoulder.</p>
<p>Katharine stood out before the King.</p>
<p>'Now I will get me gone,' she said. 'This is no place for
me.'</p>
<p>He surveyed her amiably, resting his hands on his red-clothed
thighs as he sat his legs akimbo on his stool.</p>
<p>'Why, it is main cold here,' he said. 'But bide a short
space.'</p>
<p>'I am not made for courts,' she answered.</p>
<p>'We will go pray anon,' he quieted her, with his hand
stretched out. 'Give me a space for meditation, I am not yet in
the mood for prayer.'</p>
<p>She pleaded, 'Let me begone.'</p>
<p>'Body of God,' he said good-humouredly. 'It is fitting that at
this time that you do pray. You have escaped a great peril. But I
am wont to drive away earthly passions ere I come before the
Throne of grace.'</p>
<p>'Sir,' she pleaded more urgently, 'the night draws near.
Before morning I would be upon my road to Calais.'</p>
<p>He looked at her interestedly, and questioned in a peremptory
voice:</p>
<p>'Upon what errand? I have heard of no journeying of
yours.'</p>
<p>'I am not made for courts,' she repeated.</p>
<p>He said: 'Anan?' with a sudden, half-comprehending anger, and
she quailed.</p>
<p>'I will get me gone to Calais,' she uttered. 'And then to a
nunnery. I am not for this world.'</p>
<p>He uttered a tremendous: 'Body of God,' and repeated it four
times.</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and she shrank against the wall. His
eyes rolled in his great head, and suddenly he shouted:</p>
<p>'Ungrateful child. Ungrateful!' Then he lost words; his
swollen brow moved up and down. She was afraid to speak
again.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, with a light and brushing step, the Lord Privy
Seal was coming towards them. His sagacious eyes looked from one
to the other, his lips moved with their sideways motion.</p>
<p>'Fiend,' the King uttered. 'Give me the letter and get thee
out of earshot.' And whilst Cromwell was bending before his
person, he continued: 'I have pardoned this lady. I would have
you both clasp hands.'</p>
<p>Cromwell's mouth fell open for a minute.</p>
<p>'Your Highness knoweth the contents?' he asked. And by then he
appeared as calm as when he asked a question about the price of
chalk at Calais.</p>
<p>'My Highness knoweth!' Henry said friendlily. He crumpled the
letter in his hand, and then, remembering its use, moved to put
it in his own pouch. 'This lady has done very well to speak to me
who am the fountainhead of power.'</p>
<p>'Get thee out of earshot,' he repeated. 'I have things as to
which I would admonish this lady.'</p>
<p>'Your Highness knoweth...' Privy Seal began again, then his
eye fell upon Winchester, who still stayed by the chapel door at
the far end of the corridor. He threw up his hands.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he said. 'Traitors have come to you!'</p>
<p>Gardiner, indeed, was gliding towards them, drawn, in spite of
all prudence, by his invincible hatred.</p>
<p>The King watched the pair of them with his crafty eyes, deep
seated in his head.</p>
<p>'It is certain that no traitors have come to me,' he uttered
gently; and to Cromwell: 'You have a nose for them.'</p>
<p>He appeared placable and was very quiet.</p>
<p>Winchester, his black eyes glaring with desire, was almost
upon them in the shadows.</p>
<p>'Here is enough of wrangling,' Henry said. He appeared to
meditate, and then uttered: 'As well here as elsewhere.'</p>
<p>'Sir,' Gardiner said, 'if Privy Seal misleads me, I have
somewhat to say of Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>'Cousin of Winchester,' Henry answered. 'Stretch out your
hand, I would have you end your tulzies in this place.'</p>
<p>Winchester, bringing out his words with a snake's coldness,
seemed to whisper:</p>
<p>'Your Highness did promise that Privy Seal should make me
amends.'</p>
<p>'Why, Privy Seal shall make amends,' the King answered. 'It
was his man that did miscall thee. Therefore, Privy Seal shall
come to dine with thee, and shall, in the presence of all men,
hold out to thee his hand.'</p>
<p>'Let him come, then, with great state,' the bishop stuck to
his note.</p>
<p>'Aye, with a great state,' the King answered. 'I will have an
end to these quarrels.'</p>
<p>He set his hand cordially upon Privy Seal's shoulder.</p>
<p>'For thee,' he said, 'I would have thee think between now and
the assembling of the Parliaments of what title thou wilt have to
an earldom.'</p>
<p>Cromwell fell upon one knee, and, in Latin, made three words
of a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>'Why, good man,' the King said, 'art a man very valuable to
me.' His eyes rested upon Katharine for a moment. 'I am well
watched for by one and the other of you,' he went on. 'Each of
you by now has brought me a letter of this lady's.'</p>
<p>Katharine cried out at Gardiner:</p>
<p>'You too!'</p>
<p>His eyes sought the ground, and then looked defiantly into
hers.</p>
<p>'You did threaten me!' he said doggedly. 'I was minded to be
betimes.'</p>
<p>'Why, end it all, now and here,' the King said. 'Here is a
folly with a silly wench in it.'</p>
<p>'Here was a treason that I would show your Highness,' the
Bishop said doggedly.</p>
<p>'Sirs,' the King said. He touched his bonnet: 'God in His
great mercy has seen fit much to trouble me. But here are
troubles that I may end. Now I have ended them all. If this lady
would not have her cousin to murder a cardinal, God, she would
not. There are a plenty others to do that work.'</p>
<p>He pressed one hand on Cromwell's chest and pushed him
backwards gently.</p>
<p>'Get thee gone, now,' he said, 'out of earshot. I shall speak
with thee soon.&mdash;And you!' he added to Winchester.</p>
<p>'Body of God, Body of God,' he muttered beneath his breath, as
they went, 'very soon now I can rid me of these knaves,' and
then, suddenly, he blared upon Katharine:</p>
<p>'Thou seest how I am plagued and would'st leave me. Before the
Most High God, I swear thou shalt not.'</p>
<p>She fell upon her knees.</p>
<p>'With each that speaks, I find a new traitor to me,' she said.
'Let me begone.'</p>
<p>He threatened her with one hand.</p>
<p>'Wench,' he said, 'I have had better converse with thee than
with man or child this several years. Thinkest thou I will let
thee go?'</p>
<p>She began to sob:</p>
<p>'What rest may I have? What rest?'</p>
<p>He mocked her:</p>
<p>'What rest may I have? What rest? My nights are full of evil
dreams! God help me. Have I offered thee foul usage? Have I
pursued thee with amorous suits?'</p>
<p>She said pitifully:</p>
<p>'You had better have done that than set me amongst these
plotters.'</p>
<p>'I have never seen a woman so goodly to look upon as thou
art,' he answered.</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, but he pulled them apart
and gazed at it.</p>
<p>'Child,' he said, 'I will cherish thee as I would a young
lamb. Shalt have Cromwell's head; shalt have Winchester in what
gaol thou wilt when I have used them.'</p>
<p>She put her fingers in her ears.</p>
<p>'For pity,' she whispered. 'Let me begone.'</p>
<p>'Why,' he reasoned with her, 'I cannot let thee have Cromwell
down before he has called this Parliament. There is no man like
him for calling of truckling Parliaments. And, rest assured,' he
uttered solemnly, 'that that man dies that comes between thee and
me from this day on.'</p>
<p>'Let me begone,' she said wearily. 'Let me begone. I am afraid
to look upon these happenings.'</p>
<p>'Look then upon nothing,' he answered. 'Stay you by my
daughter's side. Even yet you shall win for me her obedience. If
you shall earn the love of the dear saints, I will much honour
you and set you on high before all the land.'</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>'For pity, for pity. Here is a too great danger for my
soul.'</p>
<p>'Never, never,' he answered. 'You shall live closed in. No man
shall speak with you but only I. You shall be as you were in a
cloister. An you will, you shall have great wealth. Your house
shall be advanced; your father close his eyes in honour and
estate. None shall walk before you in the land.'</p>
<p>She said: 'No. No.'</p>
<p>'See you,' he said. 'This world goes very wearily with me. I
am upon a make of husbandry that bringeth little joy. I have no
rest, no music, no corner to hide in save in thy converse and the
regard of thy countenance.'</p>
<p>He paused to search her face with his narrow eyes.</p>
<p>'God knows that the Queen there is is no wife of mine,' he
said slowly. 'If thou wilt wait till the accomplished
time...'</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>'No, no!' and her voice had an urgent sharpness.</p>
<p>She stretched out both her hands, being still upon her knees.
Her fair face worked convulsively, her lips moved, and her hood,
falling away from her brows, showed her hair that had golden
glints.</p>
<p>'For pity let me go,' she moaned. 'For pity.'</p>
<p>He answered:</p>
<p>'When I renounce my kingdom and my life!'</p>
<p>From opposite ends of the gallery Winchester and Cromwell
watched them with intent and winking eyes.</p>
<p>'Let us go pray,' the King said. 'For now I am in the
mood.'</p>
<p>She got upon her legs wearily, and, for a moment, took his
hand to steady herself.</p>
