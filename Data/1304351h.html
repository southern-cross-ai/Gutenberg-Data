<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT
DIE!</h2>

<p class="first">BLUE flames flickered above the coal on the
stone-framed hearth, blue phantoms of fire that threw no light into
the vague tunnel of the long room. Even their warmth was cheerless,
and their dull mutter ominous, as though brooding fear had found
expression in the low crackle of the fire. There was no other
sound, except the whispered rattle of a pulled-down window shade,
whispering to the uncontrollable quiver of a slim hand that gripped
its edge.</p>

<p>The woman whose white fingers crumpled the hem of the blind,
pulling it away from the glass minutely to make a slit for her to
peer through fearfully, was a taut, pale blur against the broader,
vertical shadow of the window's embrasure. The man just behind her,
shrouded in gloom so that only the glimmer of his white shirt-front
and the pallid oval of his blunt-jawed face were visible; ached to
take her slender, maturely rounded form in his arms&mdash;to cover
her lips with kisses&mdash;although his scalp was a cap squeezing
his skull and his spine was an icy shiver. But instead, his hand
tightened on the rough butt of an automatic in the pocket of his
dinner jacket; his ears strained for some hint of approaching
menace.</p>

<p>Outside, the long slope of the hill was a boundaryless
down-sweep of soft luminousness into which great white snowflakes
were endlessly falling out of the night. They came down in hushed
myriads, silent as Death, implacable as Time, fluttering straight
down in slow haste, merging with those that had fallen before till
the blanched field seemed to lift visibly, inch by inch&mdash;a
rising tide of soundless doom.</p>

<p>But it was not the snow of which the two watchers were afraid.
Not the chill smooth snow, blanketing the brown earth. The woman
whimpered, far back in her throat. The man stirred, laid a hand on
her bare, cold arm. "Come, dear, this is foolish. Even if you were
right, he won't come tonight. No one could get here from the
valley. The snow must be six feet deep by now and..."</p>

<p>She didn't move, but her vibrant contralto voice, tight-cadenced
with the fight she was making for control, cut across his speech.
"He will come. Tonight. And&mdash;and then&mdash;God help us."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Miriam!" the other was suddenly gruff. "That's
impossible!" The harshness of his voice rose to shrillness. "You
identified his body yourself&mdash;what was left of it when they
put the fire out and pulled, it out of the wrecked train."</p>

<p>She whirled at that, half-crouching with virulence, and her
response was staccato, bitter. "Yes, I said it was he. The watch
was his, and the scarf-pin. That charred, blackened thing wasn't
even human, but I was sure it was his corpse. I..."</p>

<p>"There you are. A woman couldn't be mistaken after she had been
married to a man for five years..."</p>

<p>"Not if he were an ordinary man, but you know what he could do
to himself. The critics called him the greatest artist in make-up
ever born. I am not sure that I ever saw him as he really was."</p>

<p>"That's more nonsense. His screen-stuff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was nothing to what he did at home. I sometimes thought that
the parts he played, the monsters and madmen, had warped his soul
till he became like them. He used his skill to torture me, to try
and drive me insane. He came into my room once, as a bent old man,
with eyes sunk in a cadaverous, leprous face&mdash;with long-nailed
claws with which he tore my night clothes from me and&mdash;" She
stopped, a shudder ran through her. "He <i>was</i> that awful old
man, Ned. How do I know that his usual aspect was less of a fraud?
How do I know that it wasn't my wild hope of release at
last&mdash;and the thought of you&mdash;that made me certain the
corpse they showed me was his?"</p>

<p>"No one escaped from that smoking car. He <i>must</i> have been
killed." Ned said it defiantly but his eyes slid to the shade,
smoky, still half dubious. "It is impossible that he is still
alive."</p>

<p>Miriam seemed to be listening, listening intently for a sound
that did not come. Words dripped slowly from her lips. "Then he
<i>is</i> dead. But, alive or dead, he has sent me a message that
he will be here tonight. And when he does appear&mdash;" her voice
dropped to a husked whisper, "we shall not know him&mdash;until he
strikes."</p>

<p>"A message!" Ned jerked out. "You call that a message!" He
twisted. A stride of his long legs took him to the center of the
room. A lamp switch clicked and light swirled down to lay a cloth
of luminousness on a table-top. A tiny object seemed to gather the
light into itself, tinting it yellow&mdash;a semi-circle of gold,
half of a broken ring. The man glowered down at it as if it were
something vile, something beyond the pale. "That piece of
junk!"</p>

<p>Miriam spoke, startlingly beside him; he had not heard her move.
"'These rings bind us indissolubly together. Even death cannot
break their bond.' He said that on our wedding day, putting one
ring on my finger and one on his own, and I thrilled to the
romantic ring in his voice." She laughed, and the short undertone
of that laugh was a curse. "Fool that I was! 'Remember that, my
love, <i>not even death.'</i> That was just six years
ago&mdash;tonight!"</p>

<p>"He might have said it," the man growled, "but his saying it
could not make it true. He is dead, and you are rid of him
forever."</p>

<p>"Then how did that come here?" the woman questioned. "We found
it here when we came in at sunset, right here, and there were no
tracks in the snow except our own, no tracks in snow that had just
begun to fall and&mdash;no one in the house when we searched!"</p>

<p>"Your own ring&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's in my jewel box, upstairs, locked in. I looked. No. That
is half of <i>his</i> ring he sent. Living or dead, he sent it on
ahead to let us know that he would follow." Her flat, hopeless
accents were utterly resigned. "Ned, can a soul be so evil that it
cannot die? So vile that even Hell rejects it and it must remain
earth-bound forever?"</p>

<p>"No!" He flung the negative at her, swept the half-ring up from
the table. "Damn it, no! When a man's dead, he is eternally dead.
This was in your clothes, somewhere, in a handkerchief, in your
bag. It dropped out on this table when we went out and you didn't
notice it."</p>

<p>His hand jerked. A flash of gold streaked through the murk,
clinked into the fireplace, vanished between two coals into the
white heart of the fire. "That's the end of that, and we'll forget
it. We'll forget him too&mdash;" He whirled, seizing her, pulling
her roughly to him, devouring her lips with burning, avid kisses.
"You're my wife now, my wife! He's dead and gone and he cannot come
between us."</p>

<p>"Ned! Ned, darling. I... <i>What's that?"</i></p>

<p>They clung to each other and the ague of fear shook them. Fear
hissed in the slow burning of the coals, gibbered from black
shadow-pools beyond the lamp's radiance. Terror was a living
presence in the room, brooding in the white silence outside the
close-pulled blinds. Fear was a voice calling from that
silence&mdash;a long-drawn wail, snow-muffled, that rose, died
away, and came again&mdash;nearer. "He-e-lp! He-e-lp!"</p>

<p>Ned moistened dry lips. "Miriam. It's someone out in the storm,
calling for help. Someone in the snow!"</p>

<p>"Someone in the snow," the woman repeated, shuddering. Then as
the man moved, "No! No, Ned!" Her fingers snatched at him
feverishly, caught his lapels. "Don't open the door. Don't go out.
Maybe..."</p>

<p>He hesitated, his mouth tightening. "But dear," he almost
groaned. "This is the only house in miles. That snow is death to
anyone on foot. I..." He checked himself as the cry came once
more.</p>

<p>Miriam stiffened; her hands ceased their flutter. "That sounded
like a woman, Ned. A woman." Her whisper was plaintive. "He could
not imitate a woman's voice, could he?"</p>

<p>The man pulled her wrists away from his coat. "I don't know and
I don't care. I'm going out to see. Woman or ghost or devil, I'll
take care of you." Saying it flogged his own courage to belief.
"I'm not skulking here like a scared dog any longer." The feel of
the gun in his hand was comforting as he thrust out through the
portières to the entrance hall, his broad shoulders swinging.</p>

<p>There was no wind, but the snowfall had redoubled so that the
beam of the flashlight he had snatched up in the foyer shone
against a white wall only a few feet ahead of him, unrevealingly.
He went knee deep into wet softness that clogged his legs; wet
lumps settled on his mackinaw and uncovered head. "Hello," he
yelled, and the snow-filled air swallowed his shout. "Hell-o-o,
where are you?"</p>

<p>Silence again, and the soft hiss of the descending flakes. Ned's
skin prickled to the sensation of unseen eyes watching him,
inimical eyes somewhere in the snow-filled night. He threw a
haunted glance over his shoulder. Nothing was there but the
blanketed loom of the house, its windows black, irregular oblongs
against the white. "Where are you?" he called again.</p>

<p>A moan answered him, to the right, not far off. It couldn't be
far off or he would not have heard it. He plowed a step in that
direction, swung his torch, and its ray picked out a curling mound
in the snow&mdash;a mound that was not yet all white. He heaved to
it, saw brown fur, shaggy, framing an incredible face. It was huge,
unbelievably large. Beetling eyebrows and the faint down of a
mustache were ice-speckled. There was something unmistakably
feminine about it; but something evil, too, as only a woman can be
evil.</p>

<p>Ned shuddered, but he thrust the gun and flashlight into
pockets, bent, and pushed his arms under the great bulk. He could
not lift her; he had to drag her, and the snow fought silently,
viciously, to keep its prey. Another yard&mdash;he thought as he
felt stone steps under him&mdash;and he might not have made it.
"Miriam! It's all right. Open up!"</p>

<p>The knob rattled above him; warm air swept out and around him.
Miriam was at his side, helping him with his burden, sobbing a bit.
"She's frozen, exhausted. Oh, the poor thing! And I&mdash;wanted to
keep you from helping her."</p>

<p>They had her on the floor, near the fire. Her fur coat was a
dark pile near the table, lying in a gathering pool of melted snow.
She was tremendous, her lax arms elephantine, the slow heave of her
bosom like nothing so much as the swell of the sea. Her face was
dough-colored, was like a blob of unshaped dough. Straggly black
hair was plastered against the dead-white of her forehead. "I'll
give her some whiskey, Ned, and you go up and get the blankets from
our bed. We've got to get her warm."</p>

<p>The man stripped off his wet mackinaw as he hurried through the
entrance hall, tossed it over the banister-post of the stairs up
which he ran. Pitch blackness greeted him in the upper corridor,
but he did not stop to switch on a light. He would be up here only
a moment, and he would have his hands full when be returned.</p>

<p>His footfalls thudded on thick carpeting,
echoed&mdash;<i>did</i> they echo? He stopped short, his throat
drying, and those other footsteps stopped too. Of course what he
had heard had been an echo. Something, the snow perhaps, had made
this hall reverberant. Why, his very breathing was unnaturally loud
in the quiet up here.</p>

<p>But he could not rid himself of the eerie sensation that he was
not alone&mdash;that someone, something, was waiting in the dark.
Ned's hand stole to his pocket, fumbled in, fumbling for the gun,
felt only cloth. He had forgotten it&mdash;left it in the
thick-fabriced, short coat down below. He bit his lip, shrugged.
He'd get the blankets, get down again. And get the automatic out of
the mackinaw pocket as he passed.</p>

<p>A little light seeped into the bedroom. Ned stripped blankets
from the bed hastily, turned back to the door. What was that
thrumming noise? Did it come from within the house or from outside?
Just as he heard it, it stopped, and silence swept in again. It had
sounded almost like a laboring automobile motor, but no auto could
be passing on the hill road, deep as it was in the clogging snow.
What then? Could... A scream sliced the darkness, "Ned!
<i>Ned!</i>"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; WICKED, WATCHING
EYES</h2>

<p class="first">"MIRIAM! Coming, Miriam!" Ned hurtled down the
hall, flung himself down the long stairs, twisted and jerked aside
the curtains hiding the living room. Against the blue glow from the
fireplace a heaving mass swayed. Miriam screamed again, and Ned saw
that the monstrous woman from the snow towered erect. One ham-like
hand was tangled in his wife's long, golden hair, dragging so that
Miriam's body was arched backward, her white neck stretched taut.
The woman's face was contorted, a clammy gargoyle of mad fury, and
a knife gleamed in her other upraised hand even as Miriam's small
fists beat unavailingly at her pillowed, shaking breasts.</p>

<p>Ned's legs exploded under him like uncoiled springs. He flung
himself across the room, catapulted through the murky air,
quivering with horror, hurled himself against the sickeningly soft
mass of the woman's frame. His right hand snatched at, clutched the
sharp blade of the descending knife; his left fist thudded against
her chin. It smacked, rather, for there seemed to be no bone under
the fleshy roll. The fat dew-lap seemed to suck his knuckles
in&mdash;to nullify the force of the blow as putty would have. Ned
gasped, twisted at the knife. He did not feel its cut, but his hand
was suddenly scarlet, glistening. He pounded at the grayish face,
at the beady, reptilian eyes; he might have been flailing at a
statue of undried clay for all the effect his frantic blows
had.</p>

<p>He heard sounds, like the plop of a steam bubble in geyser mud;
he felt movements like the stirring of primordial slime in the huge
body against which he strained&mdash;and a clammy hand was on his
neck. Cold, moist, formless, the puttylike mass seemed to spread
till blobbed fingertips met over his throat, firmed and tightened.
They tightened slowly, inevitably, till his breath whistled through
his squeezed windpipe, till it was cut off and his lungs were
bursting. Tiny lightnings danced before his bulging
eyes&mdash;vanished in a black swirl of billowing blackness. Agony
stabbed mercilessly through his chest, pounded his temples. The
blackness invaded his brain...</p>

<p>Dull sound exploded somewhere finally, and he could breath
again. He pulled air into his tortured lungs, went down under a
sudden smothering bulk that fell on him and bore him to the floor.
His vision cleared; he saw Miriam standing over him, holding in her
hand splintered wood that had once been a small end-table. Her
mouth was a black circle in her pallid, distorted face. Blood
roared in his eyes, through its rumble he heard: "&mdash;right?
Ned! Are you all right?" He knew that it was her voice that he
heard.</p>

<p>"Yes." The monosyllable was a croak that rasped his throat.
"Yes, dear. You?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think so." Her hair was an aureate cascade over the
white round shoulders from which the gossamer frock had been torn.
Her eyes were wide, dark pools of terror. Ned heaved; the flaccid
mass overlaying him slid off; he realized that it was the woman who
had repaid rescue by a murderous attack. He sat up, pain racking
him. "Ned! Your hand! Your poor hand!"</p>

<p>He felt dull pain-throb in his right hand, looked down at it
dazedly. It was a scarlet mass of blood, dripping from a gash clear
to the bone across the palm. "Nothing!" he muttered. "Nothing,
dear. Tie&mdash;it up. What&mdash;what happened?"</p>

<p>"She let go of me&mdash;was choking you, killing you. I had to
do something. I grabbed this up, hit her over the head.
She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Brave&mdash;girl." Somehow he was on his feet, clamping his
wrist to stop the blood flow. "But&mdash;before. How?"</p>

<p>"There are no bandages in the house. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Handkerchief&mdash;my pocket." The room was whirling dizzily.
Ned fumbled to a chair, sat heavily down. Miriam was over him, the
sweet scent of her around him warm, grateful, as she bound his
wound.</p>

<p>Her voice was a murmur in his ears. "I got some whiskey between
her lips. She came to, grabbed the bottle from me and half of it
was down her throat in a flash. I tried to take it from her and,
suddenly, she was a crazed thing. She heaved to her feet, had me by
the hair and was pulling that knife from her bosom before I knew
what was happening. I screamed for you&mdash;her
eyes&mdash;Ned&mdash;hell itself burned in her eyes. She laughed,
horribly, the knife was coming down&mdash;and then you were
there..."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! If I'd been a second slower&mdash;She must have
wandered in the snow for hours, driven mad by her sufferings.
She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ned." Miriam's fingers trembled as she pulled the improvised
bandage tight. "Perhaps he&mdash;sent her. Or maybe&mdash;" She
stopped but the unspoken thought quivered fearsomely between
them.</p>

<p>The man forced a laugh. "Silly. She <i>is</i> a woman, isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I loosened her clothing. She is a woman, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothing. Listen, sweet, get that damnable idea out of your
head. With all his foul cleverness he couldn't change his body, his
sex. Besides, he's dead, six feet under. He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it. That's just it. He's dead, but his hate lives on.
And&mdash;<i>Oh God!</i>"</p>

<p>Sudden pounding reverberated like thunder through the house. It
choked off Miriam's speech, pulled Ned's head slowly around till he
stared fearfully at the opening into the entrance hall. The
hammering stopped, was renewed&mdash;a booming hollow sound like
the beating of savage drums. Her hand slid into his un-bandaged
one, fluttered there&mdash;icy.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;at the door," Ned pushed the words through stiffened
lips. "Someone&mdash;knocking."</p>

<p>"Someone&mdash;Who, Ned? Who? In this storm, this snow,
who?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know." The sound was a steady thump, implacable,
demanding. He pushed himself up out of his chair. "Got&mdash;to
see."</p>

<p>"Ned! He&mdash;" She clung to him, her face gray with terror,
"If it is <i>he</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man put her from him, gently. "There's no danger." His drawn
cheeks denied the bravado of his words. "I'll get my gun&mdash;"
The thought warmed him a bit as he made his legs move through the
viscous invisible fluid that seemed to sap the strength from them.
Miriam whimpered behind him, he was out in the foyer. The knocking
was loud on the other side of the bolted, sturdy door. One hand
found the rough cloth of his coat, still hanging on the
banister-post. His bandaged right dipped into its pocket for the
automatic.</p>

<p>It wasn't there! The other, then. His fingers felt the cold
round of the flashlight&mdash;and nothing else! A steel band
constricted Ned's forehead. He reeled, pulled himself back against
the banister. <i>Who&mdash;?</i></p>

<p>There was an instant's silence, quivering with unutterable fear,
a muffled shout reached him and the thumping on the door resumed.
He must have lost the gun in the snow outside, dragging the woman
in. That was it&mdash;it had slipped out of his pocket into the
snow. No one had taken it from the coat. No one could have taken it
from the coat; there was no one else in the house. But someone was
trying to get in!</p>

<p>He managed the few steps to the door, leaned against it. "Who is
it?" he called. Then more strongly, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>The knob rattled under his hand. "Let us in!" The voice was far
away&mdash;no, it was close by. The thick wood made it faint. Ned
shook his head, trying to clear it, trying to think. If Miriam were
right&mdash;but she couldn't be. The dead stayed dead, and Pavel
Borisoff was certainly dead.</p>

<p>God but his hand hurt now. "Who's there?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"State-police. Open&mdash;door." Relief whistled spent breath
through Ned's teeth. His fingers shook as they rattled bolts out of
their sockets, clicked the lock over, turned the knob. The big oak
portal swung inward, pushing him aside. Two figures surged into the
hall, flat caps of fur piled high with snow&mdash;snow deep on
thick shoulders. Boots were clotted with clinging flakes, but
between their tops and the border of the sheepskin short-coats, the
gray-green breeches of the rural constabulary showed.</p>

<p>"'Bout time," one grunted gruffly. "What's the matter in here,
everybody asleep?"</p>

<p>The big trooper who spoke stamped brawny legs and pulled a furry
collar away from his face. It was blue-jowled, brutish. Ned's skin
crawled at the heat in his eyes but he contrived a hoarse, "We've
had trouble. A woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Big female, face like a fat cow and arms like elephant's legs?"
the officer interrupted eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you know? She..."</p>

<p>"Yes, hear that, Dan? She's here. Fat Frieda's here!" Then to
Ned. "Where is she? She do any damage?" He saw the blood-stained
bandage and his hand went under his coat, came out with a blued,
squat revolver. "Gawd, I see she did. Is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's knocked out."</p>

<p>"Cripes! How'd you do it? I'll be damned if I'd want to meet up
with her alone. Wrung a matron's neck and sliced a guard's gullet
before she got away from Loomis."</p>

<p>"Loomis?"</p>

<p>"Looney house up at Vinefield. Didn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I remember. Where the penitentiary is, too. So she's
insane. No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She dead?" The other officer was shorter than the first. There
was a whine in his voice and his face was pinched, somehow
wolfish.</p>

<p>"No, she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'd better get the cuffs on her then before she comes to."</p>

<p>The taller cop turned to a door in the wall to the left, but Ned
stopped him. "Not in there, that's the dining room. She's in here."
He pointed.</p>

<p>"Oke," crisply. "Come on Dan. Get your cuffs out."</p>

<p>"How're we goin' to get the car started? How're we goin' to find
it? How're we goin' to lug her through th' damn' snow? She weighs a
ton." Dan's words ran together, complainingly, but steel clinked in
his hands and he was first through the archway. Miriam was a white
flame in the center of the room, her eyes wide. She saw the
officers and her hand went up, pulling the shreds of her dress
around her shoulders. The taller one grinned at her, but Dan went
right past her, knelt at the side of the stertorously breathing
flesh-mass they had called Fat Frieda. His hands moved deftly and
his cuffs clinked around her wrists. "Gimme yours, guy, for her
ankles."</p>

<p>"Oke. Here they are." The other tossed them, holstered his gun.
"She won't bother you none with them on, ma'am. Your husband tells
me there was a shindig here."</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, she did make a fuss." Ned wondered why her face
didn't lighten, why that little muscle twitched at the corner of
her mouth. There was nothing to fear any longer. The two policemen
could be persuaded to stay the night. Their guns would protect them
against any peril, fancied or otherwise.</p>

<p>Dan got to his feet, stood looking down at his prisoner. "An'
they expect me to haul that in to the station by myself? Ain't that
like 'em? If I hadn't met up with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Place looks like she did," the other went on, ignoring his
partner's complaints. "But you ain't got nothin' to worry about
now. Private Bill Sloane of the State Police will see to that."</p>

<p>Dan half-turned, appeared puzzled about something. "You'll stay
till morning?" Ned asked eagerly. "Your friend is right, you
couldn't get anywhere in this snow."</p>

<p>"Sure, we'll stay. I wouldn't go out again in that for money."
Sloane was gruffly hearty. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My orders are to bring her in pronto, Sloane, if I find her.
You know the regulations." Dan's voice had lost its whine, there
was a new quality in it, vibrant. "You may be on vacation, as you
said, but I'm on patrol." His hand moved toward his gun-butt,
checked.</p>

<p>The bigger man came around, lazily, but his cheek-muscles
hardened. "You said it, Dan Regan. I'm on vacation an' I'm stayin'
here." Tenseness had suddenly come back into the room, the peculiar
tenseness of a thunderstorm just before it breaks. "I can't see how
you're goin' to manage it alone."</p>

<p>Miriam's eyes caught Ned's. She was trying to signal something
to him, trying to get a silent message across to him. He didn't
understand, but the hair at the back of his skull bristled,
inexplicably. He seemed to be caught up in an intangible maelstrom
of eerie dread. The clash between the uniformed pair was somehow
more meaningful than the mere disagreement as to procedure it
appeared on the surface. It involved him, obscurely, and
Miriam.</p>

<p>"Alone!" Dan's word crackled, and his gun was suddenly in his
hand, snouting point-blank at the other trooper. "Reach, damn you!
I had a hunch there was something wrong about you when you asked
for a lift. <i>Now I know</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shot-crash pounded to the lance of orange flame from Dan's gat
as Sloane dropped to the floor, rolled to the bulking shelter of a
heavy sofa. Shot-crash answered from the floor; a red streak
whipped across Dan's cheek and stone-dust spurted from the mantel
behind him. He was down too, sheltered by the mound of the
madwoman's massive frame&mdash;Ned leaped to Miriam, thrust her
against the wall. "Oh, God," she whimpered, "oh dear God!"</p>

<p>There were no more shots as the antagonists lay flat behind
their respective shields. No more shots, but the tang of cordite
was the perfume of death in the opponents' nostrils, and death
poised, grinning, avid, for an incautious move on either's
part.</p>

<p>"Alone!" Dan snarled. "No trooper would run out on a pal, snow
or no snow. You fooled me for a while, but that crack tipped me.
What's your game?"</p>

<p>"That's for me to know, wise guy, and for you to find out."
Sloane growled from the safety of the thick-padded, heavy sofa.
Miriam's fingers tightened on Ned's shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's up now anyway," Dan snarled. "You can't stay there
forever. Throw your gun out in the middle of the floor and maybe
I'll forget one of the charges against you, resisting an officer.
That'll take six months off your sentence, whatever else you
get."</p>

<p>The one who called himself Sloane laughed grimly. "Guess again,
trooper. Mebbe I can't hit yeh without drillin' through Fat Frieda,
but the other lady's right over my sights an' I kin burn lead into
her without battin' an eyelash."</p>

<p>In the shadows where he lay across the floor, Ned could see the
pseudo trooper's eyes, weird red balls glaring out of the gloom.
Something in their uncanny light sent a shiver of sickish dread
through him that was distinct from the sharp flare of fear for
Miriam. Despite the heat radiating from the burning coals, a
feverish chill quivered in the room&mdash;a chill that seemed to
transmit itself to the woman's body, pressed against him. Ned's
heart was a leaden lump in his breast.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;yellow-belly!" Dan's curse was a groan. "You wouldn't
do that. It's a dog's trick."</p>

<p>"Try me," the other chuckled, evilly. "Just try me, mister.
I'll give you till I count five. <i>One</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>He mouthed the count with a sadistic, avid drawl and Ned knew
that the man longed to hear the thump of lead into white feminine
flesh&mdash;to see blood spurt over rounded breasts.</p>

<p><i>"Two&mdash;"</i> Even if Dan surrendered there was no safety
for Miriam. He who called himself Sloane would have them all his
mercy, then <i>and that was what he had come for!</i></p>

<p><i>"Three&mdash;"</i> Each tolled syllable retched Ned's
stomach, popped bitter fluid into his throat. His right arm was
around Miriam, clutching her to him in a frenzy of despairing
farewell, but his left hand crept along the wall, feeling its
wood-paneled surface, groping.</p>

<p><i>"Four&mdash;"</i> He knew an intaglio plaster cast of Janus
was hanging there. He found it, clutched it, ripped it from its
fastenings in one convulsive movement and hurled it! It crashed
against blued metal of Sloane's gun, smashed to a thousand
fragments. Flame spurted, thudded into the floor. Dan was
up&mdash;the pound of his shot a thunder-clap; its flash, a
lightning-bolt. Sloane jerked, screamed once&mdash;horribly. His
long body twisted out from behind the sofa spasmodically&mdash;and
was limply still. A dark stain spread on the rug, alongside his
breast.</p>

<p>Dan twisted, thrust a gnarled hand at Ned. "Thanks, buddy," he
growled. "I was just goin' to give in."</p>

<p>Miriam sobbed. Ned went over to her. She was crushed against the
wall, her arms outspread, palms flat. But her face was alight.
Terror and consuming dread had lifted from it. Her lips moved. Ned
bent closer. "I felt that it was he as soon as I saw him. And now
he's really dead&mdash;at last."</p>

<p>Ned brushed a kiss across her lips, turned to look once more at
the corpse over which Dan was bending. Borisoff had been as big as
Sloane. It was like his malevolent cunning to have gained entrance
to the house disguised as a trooper. How he must have laughed
inwardly at his meeting with the veritable officer, making his ruse
certain of success. But how had he escaped the train-wreck? The
smoking-car into which he had gone had been smashed to splinters by
a following locomotive, and then had flared to a fiery pyre. There
was no hint even of burn-scars on this dead man. <i>And how had he
managed to get the half-ring onto the table, hours before?</i></p>

<p>"Jeez!" the State cop looked around, his nostrils flaring, his
voice low, tense. "What do you know? This guy's Stan
Lindinger&mdash;one of the two yeggs who broke out of the pen day
before yesterday. Look!" He pointed. Ned saw that he had opened the
man's shirt, saw a puckered scar at the base of the corded neck.
"Another con did that with a file&mdash;two years ago." Dan's mouth
worked. "Fifteen grand reward in my pocket&mdash;just like
that!"</p>

<p>The words beat dully against Ned's numbed brain. "Pen&mdash;two
years." In those two years Borisoff had stalked across a million
screens, his incredibly gruesome portrayals distorting light into
blood-chilling horror. This wasn't he, then. The menace still hung
over Miriam, over him&mdash;the menace heralded by the inexplicable
appearance of the half-ring that was now a lump of molten gold.</p>

<p>Heavily, like a black pall, fear settled down on him once again,
gelid fear that seemed one with the dark pools of shadow lurking
along the oak-paneled walls and in the far corners of this room
where the only lights were from the bright cone beating down on the
round central table and the red glow of the aging fire. And with
it&mdash;an obscure premonition of horror yet to come&mdash;there
crept over him the weird feeling that he whom they dreaded was
close by, watching with narrowed, evil eyes the flutterings of
these beleaguered humans against the slow closing-in of inescapable
doom.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE TALISMAN OF
DREAD</h2>

<p class="first">THE jelly-like bulk of the mad-woman stirred,
pulling Ned's glance to her. Her lewd eyes stared at him from the
formless expanse of gray-white flesh that was her face. Her
incongruously small mouth was edged by a mirthless, obscene smile.
He knew that she was shackled, hand and foot, yet a ripple of
apprehension prickled Ned's spine, and he felt again the smooth yet
implacable pressure of her clammily soft fingers about his neck.
His hands knotted&mdash;then he saw that Dan was watching him
queerly. He forced unmeaning words to his tongue. "An escaped
convict, eh? Had you fooled nicely!"</p>

<p>"Said he was from Scottsville station, other end of the state.
Busted in a crap-game and hiking back to his station when the
snowstorm caught him. I was just startin' to follow Frieda's
tracks, draggin' into your field, an' I was glad o' help. Didn't
ask too many questions. Gawd! He almost got me!" The cop shrugged
his shoulders. "You never know..."</p>

<p>"How about some hot coffee, trooper?" Miriam's tone was natural,
as it had not been since they had come in and found the broken
circlet of gold. "You must be frozen." It was evident she had not
heard Dan's identification of Sloane; still thought he was
Borisoff. Ned started to speak, tightened his lips. Better that
way; she had endured enough already. From now on he must watch for
her as well as himself.</p>

<p>"Cripes, lady," Dan was answering her, "that would be swell. I
ain't got the cold out of my bones yet."</p>

<p>"We'll soon fix that," she threw over her shoulder, moving
lithely toward the hall.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Ned snapped. "Wait!" Miriam turned, looked inquiring.
"I'm going with you, I'll help you." It sounded lame after the
urgency of his exclamation. Miriam didn't notice that, but the
trooper caught the inflection and his glance flickered to Ned's
face again, flickered away. "I'll set the pantry table while you
put up the percolator. I couldn't swallow anything in here."</p>

<p>They went through the curtains, across the foyer. Melting snow
made a pool on the floor. Ned glanced at his mackinaw. Queer! He
had been so certain that he had thrust the automatic deep into his
pocket out there, that he had tucked in the flap. But it must have
fallen out in spite of that. No other explanation for its
disappearance was within reason. Reason! What had reason to do with
this mad night&mdash;with the fear that still brooded blackly
within him?</p>

<p>"I was so happy when he brought me through that door and told me
he had built this house for me, that it was mine. I thought it
meant that he had changed, that life with him would no longer be
hell." Miriam had paused, musingly, with her hand on the knob of
the dining-room door. "That was what he wanted me to think.
Disillusion would be all the more poignant."</p>

<p>Ned pulled her to him, drank greedily of her lips. "That's all
over now, sweetheart. I'll make it all up to you." Brave words, but
a bell seemed to clang within his skull, a deep-toned gong of
warning, and the kisses could not warm his blood. He held her in
his arms. The longer he held her, the longer it would be before she
opened that door. <i>He was afraid of what might be within!</i></p>

<p>But she pushed him from her, tenderly, her eyes starry. She
turned the knob. Blackness glowered at them. She clicked a switch
beside the door frame&mdash;Ned blinked to the sudden light. His
vision cleared. No one was there. He laughed silently at his fears.
The darkly gleaming oval of the big table seemed to fill the room
with its broad expanse. A long flat shadow lay across it.</p>

<p>Ned froze, staring. Directly in the centre of the glowing oak,
stubby and ominous, was his automatic! Light splintered on it,
flashed from it to stab his brain...</p>

<p>Glass crashed from the living room. A shot pounded. A man
shrieked in agony, and as Ned snatched up the gun, whirled,
shouted, "Stay here, Miriam!" The turmoil was cut off by sudden
silence. "Stay here," he repeated and was out in the foyer, across
it, lunging against velvet fabric that whipped across his face and
blinded him. It held him like something alive, virulent. He ripped
the portières aside, plunged through, stopped just within them. A
vicious, bestial snarl&mdash;an animal-sound&mdash;greeted him from
thick darkness. There was the acrid, pungent odor of burning
flesh.</p>

<p>What he saw photographed itself on his mind. It was implanted
forever like a deep-branded nightmare terror. The lamp was out, red
embers were scattered on the hearth. The little trooper lay face
down atop the hot coals. The still quivering haft of a knife
projected from his back; a dark fluid welled around its buried
blade. Frieda's mass was gone from the floor!</p>

<p>A cold wind chilled Ned's cheek. The snarl came
again&mdash;pulled his aghast eyes from the murdered man to where
something loomed against the jagged, pale aperture of a smashed
window. The thing moved, growling. A pallid glow from the
snow-filled night fell across it. It was a veritable giant of a
man, stripped to the waist, bloody gashes netting his torso, blood
masking his face so that Ned saw only crazed eyes and long green
fangs revealed by pulled-back, black lips.</p>

<p>The intruder bounded forward into a shadow, bounded forward,
long arms lifting, curved claws hooking. Ned crouched to the
attack, jerked up his gun, pulled the trigger. A click answered
him, a mocking click. He had time only to realize that the magazine
had been stripped when the sweaty, fetid monster thudded down on
him, overwhelmed him with its stink and horror, pounded him down
with its blood-slippery weight...</p>

<p>His skull crashed violently against wood. Miriam screamed
somewhere. Bursting oblivion took him...</p>

<p>Ned weltered up, slowly, painfully, through agony-filled
blackness&mdash;through a gibbering chaos of madness and
despair&mdash;till drab consciousness tugged at his eyelids and
dragged them open. A slaughter-house stench was in his nostrils,
the odor of blood and burned flesh&mdash;human blood and human
flesh! The eerie pale glimmer of a sky from which snow fluttered,
sifted into the room, obscuring rather than illuminating it. The
pain-wracked man pushed himself to a sitting posture, wondering
that he was still alive&mdash;that he had not been torn to bits by
the half-human monster which he had glimpsed for an appalling
second.</p>

<p>He was alive, miraculously. Strength seeped slowly into his
muscles and he staggered to his feet, staggered to a wall-switch
that no one had thought to use during the swift succession of
horrors this room had witnessed. His thumb pressed the white
button, and a chandelier, high in the beamed ceiling, spilled
yellow light on a shattered shambles that had once been a luxurious
living room.</p>

<p>Ned's aching stare fumbled to the fireplace. It held only gray
ashes now, and Dan's flaccid form. The madwoman was gone. Only a
great clotted stain showed where Sloane's corpse had lain.
Bloodstained splinters of glass lay on the floor beside it, on the
couch that had been a barricade for the fraudulent trooper. Jagged
splinters of glass framed the window above it, and the sill of that
window was wet with blood and melted snow.</p>

<p>The shattered threads of his brain began to knit together,
slowly, painfully. The half-nude giant must have smashed that
window, surging through it reckless of sharp edges tearing his
flesh. He must have plunged his knife into Dan's back so suddenly
that the officer had had time for only one shot, one scream. And
then&mdash;but what had become of Frieda and of Sloane's body?</p>

<p>Ned's burning gaze searched the rest of the floor. They were
nowhere. But&mdash;his skin crawled&mdash;but what was that? That
yellow gleam just at the edge of the curtains&mdash;just where they
closed the archway and hugged the floor?</p>

<p>The tiny thing wiped horror from his mind with greater horror. A
tiny thing&mdash;a semi-circle of gold&mdash;its ends serrated,
broken. Half of an old fashioned wedding ring. <i>The other half of
the ring that had brought dread and nameless fear into this
house.</i></p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THIS DREADFUL HOUSE</h2>

<p class="first">HE WAS in the house! Pavel Borisoff! The bloody,
green-fanged giant was Borisoff. He had come at last to claim his
wife, <i>Miriam!</i> Her name, the thought of her, was a red-hot
iron searing Ned. Miriam! <i>He</i> had her! He had her in his evil
clutches&mdash;that devil, that fiend whom hell itself had
rejected! Ned pushed himself away from the wall, whirled, started
through the curtains.</p>

<p>Started through! His legs thumped against something hidden by
the dark velvet! He fell forward; his flung-out hand plunged into
an oozy, squashy mass, queasily repulsive even in that instant of
falling. His other hand felt rounded, cold flesh. He sprawled
across a hulking body, rolled away from it. And he lay, shuddering,
on the foyer floor, staring at that over which he had fallen.</p>

<p>It was the nude, green-fanged giant! No longer green-fanged. His
head was a pulped, unrecognizable mass into which Ned's hand had
squashed. Ned's stomach turned over; nausea retched him. Then the
significance of the sight penetrated and he heaved to his feet, his
throat rasping to his cry: "Miriam! Miriam! Where are you?"</p>

<p>The squealed, hysterical call sliced silence&mdash;was quenched
by the same silence. The spasm that had brought Ned
erect&mdash;that ripped the cry from him, passed&mdash;was
succeeded by a rigid paralysis holding him immobile, voiceless.
Only his eyes were alive and they were focused on a thick iron bar,
a black bar smeared with red and with gray. This was the weapon
that had pounded&mdash;he understood now&mdash;had pounded through
the curtains, killed the giant and saved his life. Saved
him&mdash;<i>but had it been meant to save?</i> Whoever had wielded
it had struck through the curtains, had crashed it into darkness.
Only in that very instant had the giant's head loomed over his own
head to take the blow. And in that same instant, Borisoff's
half-ring had dropped to where he had found it, <i>from a pocket of
the person who struck that blow!</i></p>

<p>That one was Borisoff! But who, in God's name, who? Not Dan,
lying inside, murdered. Not Frieda&mdash;Miriam said <i>she</i> was
a woman, truly a woman. Not Sloane&mdash;shot dead long
ago&mdash;<i>shot dead</i>&mdash;Ned's whirling mind stuck at that.
Perhaps those once dead and returned to life can not again be
killed!</p>

<p>Blood thumped in his temples, pounded in his ears.
Miriam&mdash;what had he done to her? Where had he taken her? That
pounding was not in his ears. It was a slow thump, thump, thump
from somewhere beneath. The floor shook to it. It pounded against
the soles of Ned's feet, up his tensed legs, pulsing life back into
him&mdash;horror-filled, black-brained life, quivering to the
obscure, utter terror of that slow dinning that was so like the
leisurely blows of a hammer driving nails into a coffin-lid!</p>

<p>Ned's face was a blood-spattered, stony mask of grim despair.
His sunken eyes were dead orbs in which smoldered twin hell-candles
of hate and vengeance. He bent jerkily&mdash;picked up the
brain-smeared bar, straightened. He moved, fancying that he heard
the creaking of his pain-stiffened joints. The muffled, significant
thumping continued; his body twitched to each dulled impact as if
it were a sledge-blow at the base of his spine. Half-crouched, he
sidled to a door in the stair-casing; a door that led to the cellar
from which that sound must come. He fumbled it open, eased
through.</p>

<p>The door closed behind him without noise, and blackness engulfed
him. But the pounding was louder, clearer. Each thump was a clink
of metal on metal, under laid by a curious, soft thud that rippled
inexplicable horror through him.</p>

<p>Someone whimpered below. A husky, sexless voice said: "It's
pretty, isn't it, my lovely one? But you'll look even better. Ah,
yes!"</p>

<p>Ned tried to hurry but his terror-bound muscles would move just
so fast, and no faster. He curved around the winding steps, and the
darkness lightened slightly to dimness. The voice came again: "One
more, then it's your turn." The hammer-pound slowed, as if it were
reluctant to quit its task.</p>

<p>Ned made the last turn.</p>

<p>A single pendant light spread hazy illumination in a vaulted
basement. High stone arches were supported by vertical posts of
bark-stripped logs. Directly ahead Miriam lay, bound with strips of
her own gown that cut into her white arms, into the firm loveliness
of her bared thighs. To one side, somehow fouler by contrast with
his wife's sweet curves, loomed the gross mass of the madwoman. Her
monstrous countenance was contorted, blood-engorged. Her too-red
lips were parted in lewd ecstasy. The ruptured chain of a handcuff
dangled from the wrist of one upraised, columnar arm, and its hand
clutched a short-handled, heavy-headed hammer. Arm and hammer swept
down&mdash;to crash on a gleaming spike projecting from a throat,
from the encarmined throat of Sloane. His naked, big-thewed frame
bristled with spikes that held it to the gory wood of a splintered
pillar.</p>

<p>Frieda grinned, stepped back to gloat over her grisly work. "He
didn't last long," she lipped sorrowfully. "That bullet took most
of the life out of him and spoiled the fun. But you'll be
different, dearie. You'll scream sweetly, and beg me to kill you."
She half-turned, chuckling. "Well, now, if you haven't gone and
fainted. I'll have to go upstairs and get some water for you, so
that you won't miss anything." She came fully around&mdash;and fury
blazed in her face as she saw Ned, immobile with horror. She
squealed, lumbered toward him.</p>

<p>Ned jerked awake. The bar he held snapped up, whistled as it
flew from his hand, straight at the straggly black of her head.
Incredibly agile, she flung her hammer-hand up, parried it. The
iron crashed against the tool, both arced through the air. From his
slight elevation, Ned hurled himself at her. The top of his head
thudded between pendulous, pillow-like breasts; his fists flailed
into gruesome softness. The madwoman went down before his sudden
onslaught; he pounded frantically, blinded by his frenzy, shaken by
the red lust to kill that possessed him. The mass under him rolled
over, was atop him, crushing him with its loathsome weight. Panic
exploded desperate strength in him. He heaved, threw her off
momentarily, rolled away. She squirmed after him, uncannily
swift&mdash;clamped doughy, irresistible fingers on his ankle,
hauled him back to her. He glimpsed her slavering mouth and the
lurid laughter in her mad eyes. His other leg jerked up,
straightened, its shod foot sank into her belly.</p>

<p>An inhuman screech burst from her, her hold left his
ankle&mdash;and clamped on his throat! She rolled over atop him
again; she flowed, rather, like some un-skeletoned, protoplasmic
horror from primeval slime. He was flat on his back, his useless
arms outstretched to either side, the back of his head grinding
into the slimed concrete floor of the cellar. The boneless fingers
on his throat tightened. Suddenly they ceased the slow increase of
their pressure, but held their lethal squeeze.</p>

<p>Dimly, through the roaring in his ears, he heard viscid words
drip from the fish-belly gray of the amorphous face above him. "No!
Not so easy, my love. I have spikes enough for you and her too. She
shall share my sport with you."</p>

<p>Her meaning penetrated, and obscurely, Ned was glad. He would
take long to die&mdash;he determined&mdash;very long, thus delaying
the inevitable torture that must come to Miriam when he was gone.
Perhaps&mdash;indomitable hope still smoldered within him even
now&mdash;a miracle would occur to save his wife.</p>

<p>The woman-fiend slightly released her sodden weight. Her other
clammy hand gripped his shoulder to lift him&mdash;just as a calf
might be lifted by the butcher&mdash;to the column against which he
was to be crucified. She handled him as one would a toy. He felt
cold metal press into his hand, the sharp edges of the bar.</p>

<p>His fingers constricted, gripped. His arm-muscles lashed upward.
The iron was a live thing in his hand. It seemed to fly up of its
own volition. Bone crunched sickeningly; the red-gleaming, pig
small eyes above him were suddenly glazed; blood gushed from the
tiny, lascivious mouth, spewed its foetid nauseating warmth over
him. Jelly-like weight thumped down on him, but his throat was free
and he could breathe again.</p>

<p>There was almost no strength left in him. He crawled toward
Miriam, lay full length on the floor as he worked at her lashings.
But her dear voice, even edged by hysteria, was limpid, musical, in
his ears. "I saw you come down the stairs, pretended to faint so
that I could close my eyes for fear their expression would betray
you. Then I heard the crash of your bar, looked and saw you
fighting with her. I saw that the bar had landed here, right here
where I could reach it with my tied hands, but I couldn't do
anything more&mdash;couldn't do anything to help you until just now
when she had beaten you. Then I managed to squirm a bit nearer and
get it into your hand. I was afraid, my sweet, deathly afraid that
I was too late."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of any more. But we're going to get out of
this house, snow or no snow, as soon as I get you loose."</p>

<p>"Out of this dreadful house!" It was a prayer, a prayer of
thanksgiving. "And never come back. But even in your arms, Ned, I
shall dream of what I saw in that entrance hall."</p>

<p>"I know, I saw it."</p>

<p>"And that bar was at the woman's feet. I screamed. She whirled,
had her hands on me before I could move, held me helpless while she
tore the rest of my dress from me and tied me up. Then she went in
through the curtains, came out with Sloane slung over one shoulder.
He was groaning&mdash;I was startled to realize that he was still
alive&mdash;but limp, unconscious. She slung me to her other
shoulder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it. Don't think about it." Ned had Miriam's
arms free, started work on the bindings of her legs. His fingers
trembled, and weird, impossible thoughts crawled through the aching
morass of his mind. "The curtains acted queerly as I went through
them, she must have had them folded around her. But I can't
understand&mdash;" His mouth shut.</p>

<p>"What, Ned? What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. Nothing important." But it <i>was</i> important.
If the half-ring had been dropped by Frieda, <i>she</i> was
Borisoff. But that didn't make sense. Miriam knew her to be a
woman. Unless&mdash;could an outcast soul find lodging in another
form&mdash;a form vacated, perhaps, by its own soul and therefore
called mad? <i>Or had Borisoff been other than human?</i></p>

<p>Heavy footfalls sounded, descending the spiral stairs.</p>

<p>Oh, God! It was not yet finished!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE PYRE PREPARED</h2>

<p class="first">NED'S neck muscles corded so that it took all the
little strength that was left in his spent body to bring his head
around&mdash;till he could see at last the narrow opening in the
basement wall behind which those stairs ended.</p>

<p>The rays of the single small lamp burning down here did not
quite reach that wall. It was a misty barrier in the center of
which was a vertical rectangle of darker shadow, mysterious,
pregnant with dread.</p>

<p>The footfalls came slowly, but unhesitantly. Their very
leisureliness bespoke the certainty of the doom they heralded.</p>

<p>Miriam's fingers were icy, death-still on Ned's temple. There
was no sound in the dim basement except the implacable <i>pud, pud,
pud</i> of that which was coming.</p>

<p>Light spread from the straight-sided aperture, wavering light
that slid across the scummed floor and was suddenly still. The
sides of the opening cut it off so that it was a glistening bar of
uncanny light on that floor.</p>

<p>A shadow jagged the light-bar, the shadow of a clawed hand. It
grew, intermittently, with the thudding approach of the threat,
grew and crept toward the rigid couple till it was a gigantic hand
of blackness, reaching for them.</p>

<p>The hand was suddenly gone. But someone stood in the opening. An
oil lamp shielded by his hand threw light up on to his bulking
form. It threw unnatural shadows up across his broad-planed face,
made his heavy jaw, his thick lips, his heavy nose and dark-browed,
abysmal eyes into a countenance of infinite threat.</p>

<p>Breath puffed from Miriam, forming a name. "Pavel!"</p>

<p>Borisoff's smile was a ghastly thing, and Ned knew that he could
fight no longer.</p>

<p>"Tableau!" the man in the doorway said. "Enoch Arden returns to
find his faithless wife in the arms of another. But this wife did
not wait the conventional year to go to the arms of her lover. And
this Arden does not intend to slink back into the night from which
he came."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to us?"</p>

<p>"Do?" The booming, sepulchral voice mused. "Do? I wonder. What
is there that will give me greater pleasure on the night of my
wedding anniversary than that which I have already had, watching
your appreciation of the entertainment I staged for you? They
played their parts well; the convicts I aided to escape from their
cells, the madwoman to whom I supplied the knife with which she
made good her evasion. I sent them here, promising them sanctuary.
I regret exceedingly," mockery curdled his phrasing, "that
circumstances prevented my keeping that promise. I tried to help my
guests by knifing the trooper and releasing the feminine member of
my trio, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you were here all the time?"</p>

<p>"All evening, watching you and laughing at you. You forgot, my
dear wife, that I too might have a key to this house that I built
for you, that I might not have gambled it away on the ill-fated
smoker as I gambled away my watch and scarf-pin. Nor the ring.
Never the ring."</p>

<p>"Then it was not you that...?"</p>

<p>"No. The joy that leaped into your face when you looked at the
thing you thought was my charred corpse was uncalled for. I saw
that, from the bushes where I had been thrown, passing between cars
to return to you, and where I lay numbed, unable to move, but fully
conscious. If there had been a single twinge of regret in your
expression I might have had the farmer to whose home I was carried
let you know that I was alive. But you would not have welcomed that
news from the mouth of a stranger. I am sure you like it better
from mine. Do you not?"</p>

<p>Speech returned to Ned. "Damn your soul, Borisoff! You've done
enough to her. If you're human at all you'll stop torturing her
with your rotten tongue. It's hell enough for her to know you're
still alive."</p>

<p>Borisoff's demoniac smile deepened. "Ah, the gigolo is
ungrateful, even though I saved his life by spilling the brains of
my third guest. All right, my friend, I am a quite complacent
husband. I'll stop 'torturing her with my tongue,' as you so aptly
put it. On second thought, I'll even go away and leave you two
here&mdash;<i>to burn as you hoped I had burned!</i>" He shouted
the last and hurled the lamp far back into the cellar. It crashed,
spattered flame; Ned saw a great pile of dried wood there, its
chinks stuffed with rags and paper. He saw the blazing oil pour
over that pile, saw it roar up into a flare of torrid, whirling
flame. He turned back, Borisoff was gone. A door slammed above; the
rattle of bolts was quite clear. Running feet thudded overhead, and
another door slammed.</p>

<p>Unsupportable heat beat upon them already from the fiery
maelstrom. Ned lifted himself from the floor, Miriam came up with
him, and they dashed for the stairs, hoping against hope.</p>

<p>Heat surged up to them, enveloped them, and acrid smoke choked
them. Cursing, Ned battered at the door&mdash;battered till his
fists were bleeding, pulped&mdash;till he could scarcely breathe
and could not see although the black smoke that billowed around him
was shot through by scarlet glare. He felt consciousness slipping
from him. Sliding down along the immovable door, found Miriam's
slumped form, found her lips with his own. And hers moved a little,
returning his kiss...</p>

<p>Something crashed, somewhere. The door against which he leaned
shook. A pillar must have fallen, burned through, in the raging
furnace below. Another fell sounding like the knell of a doom-bell.
Voices were shouting somewhere near. How he managed it, Ned could
never remember, but he contrived one frantic yell, "Help!" and knew
nothing more.</p>

<p>Dimly, through waves of agony, Ned began to sense again. His
whole body was one vast ache, inside and out. Someone said, above
him, "The woman's all right but we've got to get this one to a
doctor damn' quick." Ned got his eyes open and saw a red glare in
the sky on a snow field with black silhouetted figures moving
phantasmally about him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what happened?" he gasped.
"Where&mdash;where&mdash;"</p>

<p>A face was bending over him, fur-capped, and under it was a
collar with the insignia of the state police. A gruff, kindly voice
said: "You come to, eh, guy? Gawd, we thought you'd never talk
again."</p>

<p>"Miriam?"</p>

<p>"The lady's fine&mdash;didn't even get burned. You fell across
her and kept the flames from her."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did we get here? Dan Regan 'phoned the station that he had
trace of Fat Frieda. He told us he was going ahead, but to send
help. We had a hell of a time getting through, and just as we got
to where he said he'd be, we saw a fire blaze out through cellar
windows. Took a chance on axing the door and damn' good thing we
did. Second later and you'd both been goners. Was there anyone else
alive in the house?"</p>

<p>"No. Yes. Big man&mdash;think he got out." Borisoff had escaped;
there would be no peace for Miriam while he lived. And he&mdash;he
wasn't her husband&mdash;never had been. The thought seared Ned's
dizzy brain. He...</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man. Your friend got out of the house, but&mdash;"
The trooper stopped. "Hell," he growled. "I'm forgettin' you're a
damn' sick guy. Plenty of time for that later."</p>

<p>Incredulous hope stirred within Ned. "No. Tell me. Tell me
now!"</p>

<p>"Sure yuh can take it?"</p>

<p>Ned nodded, emphatically, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, he must of gotten twisted around in the snow or
something. Anyways, there's a well out here, covered with snow. He
slipped on some ice, runnin', and tumbled into it. We got him out,
but there wasn't no use. His neck's broken."</p>

<p>Ned's lips twitched. Then he said something that made the
trooper sure he was delirious. "Can I take it? <i>Oh boy,</i> can I
take that!"</p>
