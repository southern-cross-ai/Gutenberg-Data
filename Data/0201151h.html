<h1><a name="A01">AUTHOR'S NOTE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Certain human myrmecologists to whom the present book was
submitted in manuscript--the editor wishing to make sure of his
facts, from the human point of view--suggested that, among ants, the
suspicion would arise that definite individuals had served as models
for the characters of the story.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they have--to the ant. The publication is
sponsored by an ant, namely, Wawa-quee, who, for reasons unknown to
the editor, wished mankind to become acquainted with her work.
Authors are notoriously vain.</p>

<p>If the editor's private opinion is asked for, he can only say
that, while he believes the picture of antdom given in these pages to
be essentially true to fact, and while he can vouch for the veracity
of the introduction, he suspects the remaining five chapters to be
the product of the ant's imagination and, therefore, pure
fiction.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pronunciation of names</p>

<p>In transcribing names the Pacific International Convention's rules
have been followed: all vowels have the Spanish values; all
consonants the German. Thus <i>e =</i> English <i>&#257;; a =</i>
English <i>ah; w =</i> English <i>v; qu =</i> English <i>kw.</i> A
mute <i>h</i> is used to lengthen vowel sounds.</p>

<p>A brief description of the city and the mode of life of Atta
Gigantea will be found in the appendix.</p>

<p>Here I will give a list of the chief characters of the book:</p>

<p>WAWA-QUEE (pronounce <i>Vahvah-quay),</i> organizer, leader and
commander-in-chief of the expedition.</p>

<p>BISSA-TEE (pronounce <i>Bissa-tay),</i> zoologist-in-chief.</p>

<p>ANNA-ZEE (pronounce <i>Anna-zay),</i> botanist-in-chief and
renowned philosopher.</p>

<p>LEMMA-NEE (pronounce <i>Lemma-nay),</i> geographer-in-chief and
most intimate friend of Wawa-quee.</p>

<p>ADVER-TEE (pronounce <i>Adver-tay),</i> expert in
communication.</p>

<p>AZTE-CA (pronounce <i>Aztay-cah),</i> chief signaller and
recorder.</p>

<p>ASSA-REE (pronounce <i>Assah-ray),</i> military commander-in-chief
of the escort of the expedition.</p>

<p>MINNA-CA (pronounce <i>Minnah-cah),</i> commander-in-chief of
Pogonomyrmex armies.</p>

<p>Names ending in 'ee' indicate that their bearers belong to the
highest nobility; if translation were aimed at, the syllable would
have to be rendered by 'Lord'.</p>

<p>Names ending in 'a' indicate that their bearers belong to the
second rank of the aristocracy, as in English the title 'Sir' would
indicate a member of the lesser nobility or gentry.</p>

<p>All characters are, of course, directly transcribed from life.</p>

<h1><a name="I01">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
</center>

<p>It has long been a question interesting both to the zoologist and
the psychologist how to interpret the social life of certain members
of the order Hymenoptera, In fact, scholastics and ethologists have
fought some of their most memorable battles over this problem. On one
side stood those who regarded instinct as a mere mechanism of
unconscious and hereditary impulses; on the other, those who saw in
it something closely approaching to plastic intelligence. In other
words, according as the human-race conceit of the investigator was
strongly or weakly developed, the behaviour of these insects, and
especially of the ants, was placed either in contrast or in
comparison with the behaviour of man.</p>

<p>The present book, I believe, will settle that question. The
Formicarian author, whether writing of her own congeners or, as she
occasionally does, of us humans, reveals a world of which, I venture
to say, few men have ever dreamt.</p>

<p>But let me explain how the book came into my hands.</p>

<p>For decades I had been an amateur myrmecologist; myrmecology had
been my hobby. My study of ants went back to a time when the science
was just developing into something like a systematic survey; and, I
being by training a classicist, it had taken its starting-point from
such ancient observations as those of Pliny and Aristotle. In more
recent times, footing on Latreille's and Mueller's investigations,
men like Forel, Huber, Emery, and, quite lately, Wheeler had in the
light of the evolutionary theory attacked the various problems
presented by the mass of known fact; and while adding considerably to
the foundations, both by observation in the field and by dissection
under the microscope, they gave their special attention to the task
of ethologic interpretation. Guided by the conclusions they had
arrived at, I improved what opportunities I had of observing such
species as were locally represented where I lived. Yet, until I met
with the works of Bates and Belt, my interest remained casual. These
two authors, who were not myrmecologists, properly speaking, and who,
perhaps for that very reason, kept the wider connections of the
subject more clearly in view, aroused in me, through the records of
their observations, the desire to see a little more for myself; and
since, while I remained at home, the demands on my time were always
manifold, I made up my mind, a few decades ago, to devote a prolonged
holiday to the purpose of hunting down one or two colonies of the
leaf-cutter ant of inter-tropical America. I intentionally restricted
the scope of my investigation to a single genus; nor had I, so far,
any idea of furthering science; I merely wished to satisfy my own
curiosity.</p>

<p>My choice of locality fell on Venezuela; and, during an otherwise
uneventful passage from Cuba to La Guaira, I had the good fortune of
falling in with an American planter naturalized in that country and
living on the very edge of the tropical forest in the eastern part of
the coastal plateau where he grew sugar-cane and coffee. On hearing
of my plans he very hospitably placed his house at my disposal; and
although I knew that Spanish-Americans will do so without dreaming of
the possibility that they might be taken at their word, I thought it
safe--he hailing by birth from Illinois--to accept his invitation as
being meant sincerely. After landing at La Guaira, I accompanied him
first to Caracas and then into the interior.</p>

<p>Since my purpose is not to write a book of general travel in the
tropics but simply to explain how this book came into being, I will
not expatiate upon the scenery or the flora and fauna of the country
which many an abler writer has depicted for the curious reader.
Suffice it to say that, arrived at my friend's plantation, I at once
settled down to a monotonous routine. Daily I rose at five in the
morning, before sun-up, and an hour later went to the margin of the
jungle where I soon located three colonies of the species Atta
Gigantea. About eleven I returned to the plantation and, after
partaking of a refreshment prepared by my bachelor-host's Chinese
servant, lay down in my hammock on the large, shady veranda which had
been assigned to me as my part of the spacious house. At four
o'clock, when the westering sun began to beat down less scorchingly,
and when the often violent showers of the early post-prandial hours
had somewhat cooled the air, I returned to my ant-hill to watch.</p>

<p>Often nothing worth recording happened for many days. Yet even
uneventful hours served to establish a certain relationship between
the ants and myself--a relationship which led to most extraordinary
developments.</p>

<p>I had arranged a not uncomfortable seat by cutting the arm-thick
stems of two hanging lianas close to the ground and twisting their
ends together so as to form a sort of swing, out of reach of possible
inroads of ants and other terrestrial insects.</p>

<p>Close by my aerial seat, a foot or so to the left--I faced
south--led one of the beaten tracks of the colony which I had singled
out as the largest. The main part of the hill which measured thirty
feet in diameter and which consisted of the coalesced
crater-entrances, each two inches across, to the subterranean burrows
was a few yards to the south and to the right or west of myself. A
second colony was established a hundred yards beyond the first; a
third, as many rods to the south-east. My detailed observations
remained restricted to the nearest one.</p>

<p>I always took a book along to read while I was perched on my seat;
for, since things extraordinary happened rarely, it would otherwise
have been tedious. I soon developed the power of subconsciously
keeping an eye on the ants; not, of course, on individual members of
the colony, but on their masses. Any unusual commotion at once
focused my attention; and, laying down my book, I could concentrate
on whatever happened.</p>

<p>I shall try to sketch the routine activities of these ants as they
would have gone on had I not been present or had my presence been
ignored.</p>

<p>The crowded craters of the hill always presented the spectacle of
numberless multitudes of ants entering and issuing forth. There was
no confusion; everything proceeded methodically; and continually
order evolved out of a seeming chaos. The ants dispersed on the
various paths radiating in all directions from the burrow. On the
track which passed at my feet and which was worn to a marvellous
smoothness, much more smoothly than human work could have made it,
three currents could be distinguished. The total width of the path
being about twenty inches, the central ten inches were covered by a
dense stream of ants returning to the colony; each individual carried
in its jaws, projecting perpendicularly upward and backward, a small,
circular leaf-disk which gave its bearer the appearance of a
medium-sized butterfly sitting with its wings folded up. These ants,
however, were not sitting still. Each disk was nearly an inch in
diameter while the ant carrying it was somewhat over half an inch in
length. One author has compared the procession to Birnam wood
advancing up the hill to Dunsinane. On both sides of this returning
column there was a counter-current of out-going ants each about five
inches wide; these ants, of course, went empty-handed or rather
empty-jawed.</p>

<p>By and by I came to know that, besides the main entrances in those
crater-like depressions in the mound, the colony had many other exits
or approaches which rose slantwise from the subterranean cavities and
opened to the surface at considerable distances from the hill, some
as far as fifteen or twenty yards away. These were never used by the
ants attending to the routine work. Such as I discovered I examined
from day to day; and I found them sometimes open, sometimes closed.
They served as ventilators to regulate the temperature in the brood
chambers, besides affording exits and entrances to those who, for the
moment, were not engaged in the routine work. In case of emergency,
of course, all openings would have been used; but no such case came
under my observation.</p>

<p>These ants do not by any means feed on the leaves which they cut.
As Belt conjectured and Mueller proved, they use them as the
substratum on which they grow their real food, a minute fungus which
is carefully cultivated and forced under optimal conditions of
temperature, moisture and illumination, or rather lack of
illumination.</p>

<p>Whenever I followed the worker column, I found that they were
operating at various and sometimes considerable distances from the
colony. They would come to a point under a young tree or bush where
the ground was strewn with the circular cuttings. Each ant picked up
a disk and instantly fell into line in the central, returning
column.</p>

<p>In the top of the tree, each leaf was tenanted by a worker who,
holding on with her hind-feet as a sort of pivot, was slowly swinging
around, making a circular cut with her scissor-jaws. When this cut
was nearly completed, the ant still standing on the disk, the
forefeet of the little worker took hold of the remainder of the leaf;
and when the last connection was severed, the disk fluttered to the
ground, the ant dexterously swung up on the blade and at once
proceeded to make a new cutting. No leaf was left while enough of the
blade remained to yield another disk of regulation size.</p>

<p>It would seem that such habits must be exceedingly destructive to
the forest; but I found no evidence that it was. When I first came,
the ants were working at a distance of sixty yards east of the
colony. I instantly concluded that they preferred certain kinds of
trees and went so far afield because their supply close to the hill
was exhausted. But it was not so. Plenty of trees of the same species
were to be found between the burrow and the scene of their cutting
activities; and not one of them was dead. Even in our north, of
course, a tree robbed of its foliage in early summer--by hail, let me
say--will put forth a second crop, though a less abundant one; and if
this growth remains undisturbed, the tree will recover. In the
tropics, I reasoned, where the demarcations of the seasons are
largely obliterated, such a process of recuperation would be possible
at any time provided the tree is not at once despoiled again:
perhaps, then, these ants did not return to the same tree till it had
had time to make good the loss sustained? If this could be proved, it
would go far to settle any doubt as to the truly agricultural
principle on which they work; they would not be "mining" the forest
but utilizing its surplus energies; just as man utilizes, without--in
theory--impairing, the fertility of the soil.</p>

<p>A single fact seemed to stand in the way of this explanation. The
human population which has had ample experience with these ants is
emphatic in the assertion that it is useless to plant vegetables and
fruit-trees; sooner or later these ants will find them; and they will
despoil them again and again, till plants and trees are killed. That
the ants might consciously discriminate against the plantations of
man never suggested itself to me till the fact was sprung on me as a
complete surprise when at last I entered into direct communication
with them. Amazing as it is, these astonishing little creatures
discourage the intrusion of man into the tropical forest with
definite intention and purpose. They do not approve of man.</p>

<p>I never dug into the burrows of the colony. I felt I had no right
to destroy their elaborate works just because I had the physical
power to do so; and that, I believe, was one of the reasons why I was
singled out for the mission with which I am entrusted.</p>

<p>But in order to give the human reader an adequate idea of the
material side of the life of these ants, I shall quote the results of
such investigations of others as confirmed my own conclusions. My
chief authorities are Bates, Belt, Sumichrast, and Mueller.</p>

<p>If the weather is propitious, the leaf-cuttings are carried right
into the upper chambers of the burrow. If, on the contrary, a shower
has wetted them, they are dumped outside and left to dry. In the
upper chambers, other workers, so-called medi&aelig; who on account
of their smaller size are better adapted for work in the crowded
galleries, take charge of the leaves and cut them into
microscopically small shreds which they work up into a loose, spongy
mass. In this condition still smaller medi&aelig; take them into the
garden-chambers and suspend them from their vaulted roofs to serve as
the soil for the growth of the fungus on which they feed. Their
charge now passes from the medi&aelig; to the minim&aelig; whom their
minuteness (they are less than an eighth of an inch in length, a
thirty-secondth in width) enables to pass freely through their
interstices; and theirs is the task of weeding and cultivating. All
these activities are supervised by the maxim&aelig; who are sometimes
erroneously called soldiers. Their chief characteristic consists in
the relatively enormous size of their heads which contain brains of a
corresponding development. This brain, I believe to be relatively the
largest single organ of any living being known. The work of feeding
and caring for the broods falls on the so-called callows or immature
workers; while the purely sexual functions of reproduction, at least
dimorphic reproduction, are the exclusive domain of the short-lived
male and the long-lived perfect female or queen.</p>

<p>In order to round off this sketch, I add a brief outline of the
history of a colony.</p>

<p>At a given time of year the young males and queens raised in the
colony issue for their marriage flight. No queen mates with a male of
her own colony. In every formicary hundreds of physiologically
perfect individuals of both sexes are raised. The time for this
marriage flight is carefully determined by the maxims; and, strange
to say, it is, within narrow limits, the same for all colonies of a
given district; so that, for a day or so, the air swarms with winged
ants, many of them, and those the most vigorous ones, flying at great
heights; while the vast majority perishes in the streams and pools of
the country.</p>

<p>The fertilized queen--one fertilization fills the seminal
receptacle for the life of the queen--at once locates the spot where
she desires to found her colony. She excavates a short gallery and,
at its end a small spherical chamber. Having done this, she closes
the entrance through which she is never again to pass unless
extraordinary disasters befall her colony. Next she dealates herself;
i.e., she gnaws off her wings. This is necessary in order to bring
about, within her tissues, those structural changes which enable her
to feed her first brood--as mammals do--on the secretions of her
body. At the same time she deposits in the small chamber a little
ball of the fungus hyph&aelig; or roots which she has brought from
the parent nest, thus providing for the food of her future broods.
Meanwhile her ovaries are maturing, and she begins to lay eggs. The
hyph&aelig; she manures with her anal secretions; and when the first
brood hatches, she feeds them with the metabolized tissues of her
hypertrophied organism. She herself can go without food for months at
a stretch. Her first offspring consists exclusively of minims. They
at once open the gallery; some of them continue the work of
excavation, some issue forth and start to cut leaves. Since even
their work, small as their number is, yields a surplus, the
fungus-garden soon expands. The next brood is reared by these minims
and fed with fungi; its members show the first differentiation in
size; and the division of labour begins. The queen never works again:
she lays eggs instead. In a year or two the colony exhibits all the
forms which constitute the complete social organism, a large
formicary of this species having been ascertained to harbour, in its
eighth year, slightly under a hundred thousand individuals.</p>

<p>A good deal of controversial literature has been written to
account for the seemingly automatic functioning of the ant-state. How
does the queen know what to do? How do the first minims learn to go
out and to cut leaves? On the whole, instinct has been held to
explain it all. It is interesting to see, in the pages that follow,
how much of man's activities ants ascribe to instinct. Instinct is a
convenient word without real meaning which, for that very reason,
serves admirably to veil the ignorance of those who use it. There can
be no doubt any longer that, as with us, not instinct, but tradition
and education furnish the true explanation of the facts: that much
this book settles beyond question. The queen is elaborately prepared
for her life-work while she still lives in the parent colony; and
she, in turn, teaches the first minims. Instinct is supposed to
function automatically and, by its very definition, to be
infallible.<sup>1</sup> But any observer can verify the fact that
ants make mistakes which they rectify. Belt has observed, and I can
confirm the statement, that young workers will cut and bring to the
burrow disks of the blades of grass which are unsuitable for the
growth of the fungi. "Aberration of instinct!" cry the scholastics,
explaining one meaningless term by another. If they would go to the
trouble of watching, they would see that the very ants that made the
mistake are forced to remove the grass and will never again bring it
into the burrow.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> This is Wheeler's definition: "An instinct is a more
or less complicated activity manifested by an organism which is
acting, first, as a whole rather than as a part; second, as the
representative of a species rather than as an individual; third,
without previous experience; and fourth, with an end or purpose of
which it has no knowledge."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having thus introduced my human readers to their formicarian
brethren, I resume my narrative. What I have so far described as the
routine of these ants is simply what I should have seen had I myself
been invisible or unscentable. As a matter of fact, however, my
presence created right from the start a sensation.</p>

<p>When, on the first day, I approached somewhat closely, I could not
but notice a certain degree of confusion in the lines on the path.
There was a momentary delay in their progress, especially in the
outgoing columns which spread in width; and this congestion was
speedily propagated back to the burrow. The central, returning
column, too, was retarded but after a second resumed its progress at
an accelerated pace. More important, however, than either of these
disturbances was the fact that, long before those who were passing me
when I appeared could possibly have reached the burrow, a number of
huge ants, measuring at least an inch in length, exclusive of
antenn&aelig; and legs, and endowed with enormous triangular heads,
apex down and base up, appeared in the openings of the formicary.</p>

<p>For a moment they lingered, surveying the scene; and I was much
impressed with their air of deliberation, while their geniculated
antenn&aelig; worked precisely like groping hands held up in the air.
Although I was eight feet from the burrow, I saw distinctly the
so-called stemmata or median eyes with which their heads were
equipped in addition to the compound lateral bundles of ommatidia.
These stemmata gave the giant ants a peculiar look, as though they
wore spectacles; and that bestowed upon them an oddly intelligent
air. I was reminded of Belt's remark, "The steady, observant way in
which they stalk about and their great size compared with the others
always impressed me with the idea that in their bulky heads lay the
brains that directed the community in its various duties." This
impression was strengthened when they came stalking up to the scene
of the disturbance. There can be no doubt but that the news of my
approach had spread with telegraphic speed, ahead of the returning
column. For the fraction of a second these big ants gave their
attention exclusively to me; but somehow they must have inferred that
my intentions were not hostile; for in less than half a minute after
their arrival order was restored in the triple procession: the
routine work went on as before.</p>

<p>The maxims, however, did not at once return to the hill. They
lingered and seemed to go into conference, touching each other with
their antenn&aelig;, now at the head, now at the thorax, and even at
various points of the abdominal segments.</p>

<p>My readers must figure themselves as being just within the margin
of a tropical forest, its giant trees hung with the festoons of
immense lianas. Travellers are emphatic in describing the interior of
these forests as the gloomiest place on earth. On a quiet day, such
as this was, a stealthy silence broods over the moist atmosphere and
in the impenetrable shade of the lofty foliage, becoming all the more
oppressive when it has occasionally been pierced by the unmelodious
scream of an invisible bird. Nothing is so suggestive of panic and
unreasoning fear as the thought of being lost, alone, in this vast
cradle of terrestrial life.</p>

<p>That day, this feeling was intensified by the weird,
incomprehensible scrutiny of these ants. Without analysing my
feelings, without even being conscious of the background of hearsay
knowledge from which they arose, I felt, almost as a physical
presence, the fact that nowhere does life prey on life as ruthlessly
as in these woods where fierce cats and serpents live on mammals,
spiders on birds, and numberless insects on all things quick and
dead. The extreme beauty of detail in the vegetation did not avail: I
was in the grip of primitive disquietudes; I was being surveyed and
appraised by alien eyes connected with an intelligence beyond my
mental grasp.</p>

<p>I did what I had come to do quickly, almost nervously: I prepared
the seat from which I intended to make my observations; and then I
returned to the estancia, unable to subdue my shivers. A few hours of
rest restored my equilibrium; and I laughed at the confusion into
which I had been thrown by my first encounter with these ants.</p>

<p>When, next day, I resumed my post, I had a book along. This
expedient proved successful; for it was several weeks before I felt
again unbalanced. Meanwhile I watched while reading. A careless
observer would henceforth not have noticed anything beyond the
routine of the carrier columns. But I made it a point not to be
careless. Whenever I mounted guard, two changes took place. One of
the giant ants made her appearance at a point in the flank of the
columns next to my seat. There she stalked up and down, up and down,
in a stately, watchful way, over a distance of from twelve to twenty
inches. Only once did I prove to myself that she had a definite
function. Intrigued by her eternal vigilance, I made, on arrival,
straight for the path as though to cross it. Instantly, the maxim
having just appeared, the column broke, leaving a clear space where
my foot would have descended. The movements were so minutely
concerted that there could be no doubt of their being executed in
pursuance of an order issued. When a half minute had gone by without
my repeating the threat, the column re-formed with the same
precision. The second change consisted in the appearance of another
maxim on top of the wide, flat mound formed by the coalesced entrance
craters. This ant stationed herself so as to be almost hidden in one
of the slanting galleries, with nothing but her large triangular head
protruding. I was reminded of a sniper in a trench or bomb-hole. She
stayed as long as I stayed, never once moving or changing her
position.</p>

<p>Thus weeks went by; and since nothing new ever happened, I began
to concentrate more and more on my reading. The monotonous routine
began to have a beneficial effect on my nerves; yet it seemed that,
apart from this, nothing further could be gained by prolonging my
stay. As I have said, I did not care to pursue my studies by
destroying their city; others had done so before; the purposes of
science had been served; and though this particular species, Atta
Gigantea, had, to my knowledge, never been investigated in detail, I
had no doubt that the burrow and the organization of the community
varied in no appreciable degree from those on which authors had
written.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, there was a strange fascination about my
work. I was convinced that these thousands upon thousands of ants
that filed along the path had come to know me and expected my
presence at given times of the day. That the maxims were on the
look-out for me, was evident; they appeared the moment I entered the
forest. A bond of sympathy established itself between myself and the
ants; exactly as a commuting clerk in a human city learns to expect
certain faces in the train which conveys him from the suburb where he
lives to the urban block where he works; till he would miss the face
of an individual otherwise unknown to him should that individual fail
to appear. I even conjectured long before I knew it to be a fact that
one set of workers filed past in the morning, and a different set in
the afternoon. It was not an actual observation; the only thing which
might have suggested the thought was the sight of workers of all
sizes issuing from certain side galleries and moving about in an
aimless way, apparently for no other purpose than that of recreation;
for, though they seemed busy enough as they scampered about, I never
saw them do any work.</p>

<p>Gradually, too, the character of the surveillance under which I
was kept underwent a change. At all times eyes were focused on me,
critically and appraisingly. But while, in the beginning, that
surveillance had been hostile, it had become expectant and
purposeful. I cannot say how this shading-off in their attitude was
conveyed to me, unless I were to ascribe it to a sort of transference
of thought. If anything fits me peculiarly for observational work, it
is an infinite patience with life in all its forms. Something like a
tacit understanding arose between myself and these ants; I began to
look forward to my hours in the forest as one looks forward to hours
of congenial company.</p>

<p>Then, one day, a series of extraordinary events opened up. I used
to sit tailor-fasion in the loop of the two lianas which formed my
seat, my back leaning against one of the pliant stems, my book
resting on one knee.</p>

<p>One day, soon after I had settled down, I suddenly saw, on
casually looking up, that, along the liana in front of me, one of
those giant ants or maxims was coming down from above. I cannot tell
whether this was the first time she had appeared there; but it was
the first time that I became aware of her. She must have climbed the
trunk of the tree, gone out on the branch, and descended along the
hanging trunk of the climber. When she arrived at the level of my
face, she stopped; and, fastening herself with her four hind-feet to
the scaly bark of the liana, she lifted her thorax and head so as to
look straight at me, and then she began to wave her antenn&aelig; in
the most regular, steady, and purposeful manner. For a few moments I
remained motionless; then I slowly raised my hand. Instantly she
dropped to the ground whence, in her stately and deliberate way, she
returned to the burrow.</p>

<p>The following day she reappeared as soon as I had taken my seat.
Again she stopped at the level of my face and began to wave her
antenn&aelig;. This time I did not offer to disturb her. I knew that
the bite of the powerful jaws of these maxims is amply capable of
drawing blood; but I was not afraid. As a matter of fact, violence
seemed to be the last thing she was bent on. For many minutes she sat
there, waving her antenn&aelig; eighteen inches from my face. More
than anything else it was her persistence which held me motionless.
The hand in which I grasped my book had sunk down, my knees were
spread.</p>

<p>Thus I sat for more than an hour. Involuntarily, my attention had
become centred on the black, polished stemmata or median eyes in her
head. Their glint and glitter seemed so human. With all the intensity
of which I was capable I wished to understand what this ant was
about; but her shining eyes and the unceasing motions of her
antenn&aelig; slowly had a confusing effect.</p>

<p>I was so absorbed that I lost track of my surroundings; till, with
a violent start, I became aware of the presence of a second ant. This
second ant had climbed up on the open pages of my book where she was
standing on all her six feet. She too, was waving her antenn&aelig;;
and her eyes glittered with the same intent purpose as those of her
sister. As I said, when I became aware of this second ant, I gave a
violent start; and as I did so, both dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>I was bewildered and puzzled as I returned to the plantation.
Something uncanny had unbalanced me. Without explaining it to myself,
I felt as though I were in the power of these ants. I half regretted
ever having taken an interest in any such insects. I played with the
idea of returning at once to the saner world of our North-American
cities. At the same time I was convinced that I should do nothing of
the kind; that, on the contrary, I should return to the ants next
day: I knew I had "to see this thing through".</p>

<p>Still, all night long I dreamed of gigantic ants, ants the size of
elephants, besetting my path in the forest and standing about,
holding me at bay with their huge, trunk-like, waving
antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p>A sort of obsession took hold of me. I read of nothing but ants; I
thought of nothing else; I talked of them; I dreamed of them. I could
no longer close my eyes without at once seeing myself in the gloomy
shades of a tropical forest, surrounded by ants of mammoth size that
lorded it over me. And what happened next was not calculated to rid
me of that obsession.</p>

<p>Two days later I was hardly seated at my post when the maxim
appeared on the hanging trunk of the liana; and this time she was
followed by two others who also engaged in the frantic and
incomprehensible waving of antenn&aelig;. I kept on the look-out for
the one that had climbed up on my book; but she did not come.
Instead, two whole rows formed on the ground, to both sides of my
seat, all waving their antenn&aelig; and focusing their eyes on mine.
A shiver ran down my spine; but I did not stir; and thus half an hour
went by.</p>

<p>Something was happening to me. A numbness invaded my limbs; I
tried to turn my eyes and could not. I knew that the routine work of
the carrier columns was going on all the time; but I did not know how
I knew. My mind, however, was singularly free and mobile; and this
gave me a queer sensation: much as a paralytic may contrast his
mental agility with his muscular rigidity. For my body was invaded,
like a separate entity, by a purely physical sense of drowsiness. I
made a violent effort to rouse myself; in vain.</p>

<p>And suddenly I was aware of the fact that that other ant had again
swung up on my book. By a sort of second sight, for I knew I had not
moved my eyes, I saw her sitting there, waving her antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my eyes remained focused upon the group of three ants in
front of my face. They formed a short isosceles triangle with its
apex down; all three were clinging to the bark of the liana with four
hind-feet, holding the front-feet stretched out, downward, as though
in the effort to counteract the violent upward twist of their thorax
which supported the triangular head with its waving antenn&aelig; and
glistening eyes.</p>

<p>I must have fallen into a state next to actual sleep or
an&aelig;sthesia. My eyes were open. Moments of clear but vacant
consciousness were obliterated by lapses of an absolute mental
void.</p>

<p>After one of these lapses I suddenly realized that the ants had
left me. This jarred my mental faculties back into functioning; and I
was once more capable of a normal exertion of the will. I tried to
swing my feet to the ground; but my movements, resembling those of a
man whose limbs have "gone to sleep", were very awkward. I fell with
a dull thud, bruising my head against the roots of the tree.</p>

<p>The violent impact roused me, and I got to my feet staggering. My
head ached; and without further thought I turned north, into the path
leading to the estancia.</p>

<p>My headache became worse; and, forcibly banishing all thought of
what had happened, I lay down in my hammock, and was soon asleep. For
once I dreamed neither of ants nor anything else; I lay like one
dead; and it was with some difficulty that my host roused me for the
evening meal. I did not say a word of my adventure; I was determined
first to find its key.</p>

<p>On awaking I had had a very peculiar sensation. I had not seemed
to be I.</p>

<p>Just what that portended I could not say as yet; but I felt that
is was momentous. I can imagine a doctor feeling like that when he
has gone into an area stricken with pestilence. He watches himself
for symptoms, alert at all times to apply to himself the remedies
which he has been administering to others. Even while he is in
perfect health, he keeps watching for signs of his being invaded by
the disease.</p>

<p>All sorts of inconsequential thoughts floated through my mind that
night. I wondered whether the ants who--of that I had no doubt--were
responsible for my condition felt as restless as I did myself;
whether this thing meant as much to them as it did to me. There was
no answer, of course. I pursued the questions only in order to let
the preoccupation with side-issues veil the tremendous significance
of the facts of the case. By some mesmeric action I, my
individuality, had been sucked up or down into an alien
mass-consciousness which communed with me through channels other than
those of the senses. The moment I surrendered myself, my
consciousness was that, not of my former self, but that of ants, and
of no individual ant, so far; but of all antdom, or at least of the
community of these particular ants. I felt as though I were on the
verge of a revelation.</p>

<p>"You did not sleep well last night?" my host asked next
morning.</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "The fact is I am on the point of an important
discovery in entomology."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear you are successful," he congratulated.</p>

<p>How inadequate it all seemed! As soon as I could decently do so, I
left him and hurried into the forest,</p>

<p>I had hardly sat down in my seat when I saw the first of my new
friends coming down the liana. Today her movements lacked that
ceremonial, circumspect, and mysterious air; they were businesslike
and matter-of-fact. Other maxims were all about, on the ground. The
individual on the liana gave some sort of signal to her companions,
but what this signal consisted in I could not have said. Instantly a
second ant swung up on the page of my book. Whether this was the same
ant that had been there before I did not know; I presumed so. Now I
had my first close look at this individual.</p>

<p>At once I knew her to be an ant of mark. She was hairier than the
others, though her hairs were much broken and worn in places. Since I
knew that the hairs of ants are improperly so-called, their function
being, not that of protection, but that of exceedingly delicate
sense-organs of odour and touch, I recognized in her a more
finely-organized being, brainier than her companions. I also had the
impression of extreme old age; her armour was deeply scored and
abraded; and though it may not have been a colour impression at all,
there was about her that which suggested greyness--and weariness,
that weariness which goes with great wisdom and a wide experience in
the ways of the world. Henceforth I should have recognized this ant
among thousands of swarming individuals of her caste.</p>

<p>This venerable dean among ants, then, set to work waving her
antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p>For a moment I was absorbed in watching her procedure. With head
lowered, she raised first one then the other of these delicate organs
and swung them down again; and slowly, as I watched these manoeuvres,
I became aware that the movements were not straight up and down
either, but modulated and embellished, as it were, by a thousand
different vibratory oscillations of varying amplitudes which had at
first remained unnoticed.</p>

<p>Almost immediately following that observation, a peculiar
sensation invaded me. I felt my own consciousness slipping. There was
an intermediate stage, resembling that of a person who is being put
under the influence of an an&aelig;sthetic: the stage when he is
still aware of what is being done to him but already finds it
impossible to defend himself against the influence invading him; he
tries to lift his hand in protest and thinks he is succeeding; but in
reality his body has already given in. At that stage I was still
seeing, still watching the ant; but already she was drawing my
consciousness into her own; and with her consciousness her purpose
had become my own.</p>

<p>That purpose was to convey to me an experience, the contents of a
whole life. Just how this experience and this life became my own, I
cannot tell, of course; nor how long this state of mesmeric
transposition of personality may have lasted. To me it seemed to
extend over years and years; in reality it was probably comprised
within minutes or even seconds. For, when, on awaking from this
trance, I staggered to my feet, I saw that the minute hand of my
watch seemed hardly to have moved at all.</p>

<p>I went "home"; that is, back to the estancia; but while doing so,
I knew that I was not yet I. I walked and acted like a human being;
but my mind was that of the ant; I had lived her life; and her memory
was mine. I could look back upon all she had gone through; and it
devolved upon me to put down a record of what, by some miracle, had
been communicated to, or infused into, my consciousness.</p>

<p>I cannot, therefore, claim that what follows is my work. It is the
work of Wawa-quee, the ant; and it must be read in that sense. I
merely set it down, under compulsion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should add that I went back to the formicary once or
twice. I never again saw my friend; but the activities of the tribe
went on undisturbed as though nothing had ever happened to interrupt
their placid flow.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As is well known to all Gigantean Attas, it has ever been one of
the glorious traditions of our dynasty that each queen succeeding to
the throne should, at least once in her reign, equip and send out,
for the furtherance of knowledge, an expedition into distant parts of
the world. In the past, such expeditions had consisted of from half a
dozen to a score of ants who, as a rule, had gone south, east, or
west. Their aim had invariably been that of geographical, geological,
meteorological, botanical, and zoological exploration; and the result
is known as consisting in the illustrious body of science contained
and digested in the scented records traced on the sacred trees east
of our city.</p>

<p>These records contain the natural history of our country. In the
past, it had been found that each acquisition of knowledge opened up
new provinces of ignorance. Each expedition that returned home, great
as was the store of new knowledge acquired, had brought in its train
new problems for investigation. For a long time, then, the object of
a further expedition had defined itself by the very achievement of
the one completed. Yet, when the last, undertaken a score of years
ago, had returned, the problem defining itself had seemed to be of
such a magnitude as to defy even the courage and enterprise of ants.
This had been in the reign of Her Glorious Majesty's predecessor
Orrha-wee CLXV.</p>

<p>When our present sovereign had entered upon the fourth year of her
reign without sending out, in pursuance of that august custom, a new
expedition, it was generally assumed that the apparent neglect was
due either to a profound conviction that further knowledge was beyond
our reach or to the suspicion that a greater interval of time was
needed to digest the results so far attained.</p>

<p>It remained a profound secret from the multitude that Her Majesty,
from the very beginning of her reign, far from being discouraged by
the problem which had defined itself as the result of previous
expeditions, had, on the contrary, conceived the plan of surpassing
all her predecessors by the scope of her project. In preparation she
had secretly, though in consultation with a few leading thinkers,
sent out certain individuals and even groups to reconnoitre the
country to the north which, so far, had been considered as presenting
insurmountable difficulties to our advance. Her Majesty had honoured
me by directing that all findings of these investigators were to be
reported to myself; and that I should receive and store up these
findings and ponder them till I had found ways and means to despatch
an expedition into those terrestrial regions of this continent which
lie north and west of the Great Narrows. In all my conferences with
Her Majesty it struck me that she never enjoined upon me to ponder
<i>whether</i> such an expedition would be possible; the problem was
simply <i>when and in what manner</i> it would be advisable to launch
it.</p>

<p>Her Majesty never doubted, never hesitated about the aim; but she
was willing to bide her time. Her faith in the powers of the
formicarian mind was nothing less than an inspiration; and when, in
the fourth year, I outlined to Her Majesty a plan which, I never
doubted, would be rejected, on account of the hazards which it
involved and the uncertainty of its success, she embraced it with the
greatest enthusiasm; and, a little to my discomfiture, she conferred
upon me unheard-of powers, appointing me to lead that expedition
myself and to take immediate steps to launch it into the unknown.</p>

<p>Now I had the honour of being of the exact age of Her Majesty; and
I shrank from the weight of the responsibility. This will be readily
understood: an Atta queen is, at four years, a young ant; but a mere
maxim has, at the same age, in all formicarian probability, entered
upon the declining quarter of her life. I pointed this out to Her
Majesty; but she insisted, calling my attention to the fact that a
great task had before this enabled ants of my caste to live beyond
their traditionally allotted term of life. She was pleased to use
many flattering expressions in explaining to me just why I was to act
as her deputy, referring to my previous record as an investigator and
organizer, and ultimately hinting that, in her opinion, the success
of the whole unheard-of enterprise depended on my devotion to Her
service; and perhaps I may add that at last she modified her request,
changing it from a command into a prayer. At that I could no longer
refuse.</p>

<p>Let me define the purpose of the expedition. To use Her Majesty's
own terms, it was to complete such a survey of all antdom as to
enable us to trace the evolution of the nation Atta from the humblest
beginnings of all ants and to make it possible for us to arrange the
whole fauna of the globe, or of such portions of it as could be
explored, in the form of a ladder leading up to our own kind. This
involved a cataloguing and a classification of all forms of life to
be found on the continent; a tremendous task.</p>

<p>Let me skip an interval of eight years and speak of the
present.</p>

<p>The results of the expedition which ultimately set out and which,
with one exception, namely, myself, perished in the course of its
work, have been set down in detail on 813 scent-trees surrounding our
city. This having been done, it pleased Her Majesty to ask me to
compose a popular account of the whole undertaking, to serve as an
introduction to the detailed study of special subjects; and the
present narrative is the result of my compliance with Her request.
The sequence of events and investigations observed is not strictly
chronological; and occasionally a record is introduced in an order
the very reverse of chronological; for the present aim of Her Majesty
is systemic rather than historical. It is to present the main results
in such a way that they can be grasped as a whole. Still, a thread of
narrative remains; for we found that, the farther we left our home
country behind, the less dominant were ants on earth; and the more
distinctly was their place taken by that curious mammal called man.
More than that; as we proceeded north and left one climatic province
after another behind, we found ever new genera and species of ants
assuming the leading part in the control of the country; and, as the
curious will scent, they offer, in their succession, a definite scale
of development. It will become abundantly clear that our own race
stands at the very apex of creation as far as that creation is
completed today.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As I have said, it pleased Her Majesty to give me discretionary
powers for the organization of the expedition. I immediately secured
the co-operation of five leaders in their respective fields. At first
I was tempted to reserve at least one department to myself; but I
feel convinced that it was wiser not to do so.</p>

<p>I secured "their co-operation"; for I realized that, though the
powers conferred upon me were sufficient to command their services,
it would have been inadvisable to use these powers. We were going to
be absent for a space of years; we were going to be exposed to
dangers from all sorts of sources; we were going to meet with
unheard-of hardships and difficulties: unless we were bound to each
other by the bonds of mutual esteem, loyalty, and even love, no
exertion of authority would have sufficed to keep us together; and
had we ever separated into smaller groups, we should have been doomed
to extinction.</p>

<p>Each of these leaders was in turn to secure her own staff, being
free to choose, from the vast bodies of ants learned or skilled in
their respective fields, whomever they thought fittest for the work
and best able to adapt themselves to the peculiar conditions and
problems that were bound to arise in an enterprise of so vast a
scope.</p>

<p>To myself I reserved no other privilege than that of convening the
plenary meetings for the deliberation of such problems as concerned
more than one group and of acting the part of a central
clearing-house of ideas and a depositary of their findings.</p>

<p>In this way I brought into being five bodies, each consisting of
from twenty-five to thirty-five individuals and aggregating 162
maxims. The leader of each group occupied with regard to its
remaining members the same position which I occupied with regard to
the whole body; and they were at liberty to group themselves into
smaller bodies for the discussion of special problems. One of these
groups consisted of geographers, one of botanists, one of zoologists,
one of experts in communication, and finally one of expert scenters
skilled in reducing the findings of any body into the briefest and
most pregnant scent-form. The task of keeping the meteorological
records was handed over to members of group four.</p>

<p>These, then, represented, apart from one other individual and
myself, the brains of the expedition and its High Command.</p>

<p>This other individual was the far-famed Assa-ree, our
general-in-chief, who was to be independent of the scientists,
experts, and artists and responsible to myself alone. She was not
told at the time that it had pleased Her Majesty to confer upon me
absolute and unconditional vice-regal powers by virtue of which I
held her life in my jaws. I will confess that, much as I shall have
to praise her undoubted genius in the field, her unequalled courage
in the face of an enemy, and her unheard-of ability to organize and
to control large bodies of ants, she had one grievous fault which I
feared as much as a source of evil as I appreciated its potentiality
for good: she was ambitious; she was impatient of control and illy
brooked any intervention between herself and Her Majesty. Since, at a
later stage, tremendous issues forced me to make use of my powers and
since she, as a consequence, did not return, I must enter into some
detail.</p>

<p>There had been rumours that she was herself a "throw-back"--an
individual not entirely normal and exhibiting characteristics which
aligned her with certain ancestral types of retarded development.
There had been talk that, though she had never had wings, she had
encroached upon the royal prerogative of laying
eggs--parthenogenetically produced--from which viable offspring had
been raised by our callows who never suspected that these eggs were
illegitimate. What lent these rumours an air of verisimilitude was
the fact that, from season to season, our broods were found to
contain numbers of "throw-backs" resembling an ancestral type of
fighting ants more closely than true Attas. There had finally been
rumours that treasonable thoughts were no strangers to Assa-ree's
heart; that she aspired to the crown; or to a position, below the
crown, of all but absolute power; and that, if she failed in her
ambitions, she would not hesitate, should occasion offer, to desert
her own nation and to join that nation's enemies. I had never
credited these rumours; and, I am glad to say, they had never reached
the antenn&aelig; of Her Majesty. There was, however, in our recent
military history, one circumstance which made me suspect the nature
of her powers; and that was the ease with which, on the occasion of
the last invasion of our territories by an enormous army of Eciton
Predator, she succeeded in side-tracking that army, so that we were
never even troubled with their raids. It was rumoured that she had
singly entered the hostile army and issued orders as coming from
their own supreme command. But whatever her powers might be, I held
to the fact that she had used them for the salvation of our
people.</p>

<p>Yet, when I approached her on the present occasion, I could not
rid myself of the impression that there was about her the faintest
aura of a fecal odour such as is well-known to surround all Ecitons;
and that was the reason why I solicited and obtained from Her Majesty
the special power over life and death to which I have referred and
which was given to me in the form of very small pellets of the three
great royal perfumes: the perfume of Supreme Command, the perfume of
favour, and the perfume of death.</p>

<p>When I first approached Assa-ree with my request for her
co-operation in the interest of the expedition, I was, for the
fraction of a second, conscious of an intensification of that fecal
odour. But my disquietude was allayed by the readiness with which she
embraced the plan. This was the more gratifying to me as, without
some sort of military escort, the expedition could not have started.
Her first demand, on the other hand, made me suspicious again. She
asked for absolute authority, not only in training but even in
levying the army. Unless she was given a free hand, she would not
undertake the task. Yet, having gone so far, I did not see how I
could refuse. In some mysterious way the conviction came to me that,
unless I indulged her, I should make myself the means of driving her
into open revolt; and I was too profoundly penetrated with the
teachings of our penologists not to feel that her extraordinary gifts
might be led into channels where they would work as readily for the
good of our nation as, under different circumstances, they might work
for its evil. Her next demand could, after this, no longer be denied:
she asked for permission to secede from our city: she urged that a
fighting body, drilled and organized, and mentally reoriented in such
a way as to make them obey her own single will rather than the call
of the community as such, would prove a serious source of disturbance
within a commonwealth where voluntary devotion to the common weal was
the central principle from which freedom flowed. In what she added
she seemed to me to be playing with fire, though she tempered her
plea with a peculiar ironical humour which was bending back upon
herself. Her argument was that, among Attas, military gifts were
necessarily associated with a retarded mentality, capable of holding
on to only one idea at a time; we were fortunate, she scented, in
having no small numbers of such backward members in our midst; for
without them we should speedily succumb to a hostile world; so long
as these were scattered as individuals among large numbers of fully
civilized ants, they might never even be suspected of aberrant
instincts; but the moment they were segregated and brought together
in solid masses, they would necessarily begin to feel their mettle
and become the cause of friction; they might even prove a serious
danger to the state.</p>

<p>All which was so reasonable and so self-evident that I agreed in
spite of my suspicion that Assa-ree was poking fun at me.</p>

<p>The next question was that of numbers. It so happened that there
had just been a census; the total number of Attas, maxims,
medi&aelig;, and minims in our city had been found to be 435,313
souls, which number was, of course, subject to slight fluctuations
from day to day. Callows were hatched, and old ants died. Now
Assa-ree asked for ten thousand; and this estimate was so little
above my own estimate of the number necessary, namely, eight
thousand, that I conceded it without argument.</p>

<p>But here is the point. When, four months later, Assa-ree reported
that her levy was complete and I reviewed the troops in person, I was
struck by the fact that the ranks presented an alien aspect and that,
above all, most of the officers seemed to have extraordinarily large
and curved jaws. Yet I had seen an occasional individual like that in
our city; what amazed me was the large number in which, on this
occasion, I saw them assembled. But, as Assa-ree and myself walked
along the front of the serried ranks of this army, the scent with
which I was cheered, though it, too, partook of that fecal quality
which I have mentioned, was so enthusiastic that I could not doubt
the loyalty of these troops, no matter of what suspicious-looking
elements they might be composed. So I suppressed my misgivings,
arguing that, if we wanted fighting power in our escort, we had
better take it as it offered itself; and that this army had that
fighting power, there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>Yet my suspicions were revived once more. Bissa-tee, chief
zoologist to Her Majesty and leader of the zoological group of the
High Command, expounded it as her theory that even in communities
devoted entirely to the arts of peace the birth rate rises when an
extraordinary enterprise demanding the possible sacrifice of life is
planned. She asked for a new census. When it was taken, she
triumphed, of course. In spite of the fact that, according to
Assa-ree, ten thousand individuals had been conscripted, the
population of the city had risen to 435,328, or fifteen more than
there had been before the draft. Even allowing for the correctness of
Bissa-tee's theory, this seemed so amazing that I could not account
for it.</p>

<p>I will anticipate and state that, years later, just before
Assa-ree made her final bid for power, by means of the most
detestable treason, I extracted from her an admission, which she made
in the form of a boast, that, while she had indeed levied numbers of
Attas exhibiting a military atavism (all of them closely related to
her; in fact, being her illegitimate offspring), the minutest search
for such individuals had failed to produce a levy, among the maxims
and medi&aelig;, of more than 2,114 able-bodied ants; the rest of the
levy she had made up by winning over, no doubt using her fecal odour
for the purpose, stray bodies of Ecitons, of the species Eciton
Hamatum, our deadly enemies.</p>

<p>In a way I cannot but rejoice at the fact that neither I nor
anyone else had the slightest knowledge or even suspicion of the
extent of her treason at the time; had we had such a suspicion, we
should never have started on our expedition; we should, instead, have
rushed into civil war; and who knows what, with such an enemy, the
outcome would have been? Our ignorance of the facts served the
commonwealth in two ways: in the first place, we led a most dangerous
potential enemy away from our country: more dangerous, in fact, than
a purely Eciton army of ten times its number would have been; for
against such an enemy our usual means of defence would have availed,
whereas this highly trained and efficient fighting unit knew all
about these means of defence and could have circumvented them, as
they would undoubtedly have done had we, by even the slightest
hesitation, betrayed any knowledge of its true nature and
composition; in the second place, enormous as were the losses
sustained in the course of our march through a largely hostile
continent, the expedition was led to a successful issue; and the
wealth of new knowledge acquired in its course has been made
available for the future, for our nation and all antdom, if only by
the survival of a single individual, namely, myself.</p>

<p>One last word with regard to the army. When I proposed eight
thousand as the number to be levied, I had in mind that a third or a
half of this number should be composed of Attas intermediate between
the fighting and the carrier types. For in addition to those
exclusively levied for purposes of defence and attack we needed a
considerable number of individuals who would carry a supply of
fungus-hyph&aelig;* or roots in their infrabuccal chambers. I
anticipated the possibility of meeting with climatic or other
conditions which would force us to entrench for weeks or months at a
time, and if, in times of unemployment, we had to go without our
accustomed food, it might prove an unendurable hardship. I felt
certain that we could always secure leaves suitable as a substratum
for the cultivation of our fungi; but lack of seed would, in such a
case, have been fatal. Besides, I had hit upon the plan of
establishing, in favourable localities, hidden fungus-gardens on
which we could fall back should hunger or defeat, by whatever enemy,
force us into a hurried retreat. I am glad to say that, at least in
this particular, the provision made by Assa-ree proved adequate,
though it fell far short of what I had expected her to do.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The order in which we set out, seven months after we had begun
preparations, was as follows. The van, to the number of two or three
hundred, was composed of scattered individuals and groups of
particularly powerful physique and intrepid spirit. All of them were
volunteers, which insured at least that they did not fear but rather
relished their task. Immediately behind them came a corps of skilled
signallers, specially trained to emit the most pungent and
fast-diffusing scents by which to give warning and information as to
what was happening in front.</p>

<p>Then followed a massed body of fighters, commanded from the rear
by Assa-ree. These formed a solid front and two solid flanks. Their
rear was supposed at all times to form a hollow crescent enclosing
that body which I have called the brains of the expedition and in
which no particular discipline or marching order was observed. It was
followed by another massed body of carriers and fighters who again
enclosed the central body with a crescentic arrangement of their
forward ranks.</p>

<p>Since the country which we had to traverse before reaching the
Great Narrows was well-mapped and known in every detail, we
travelled, to begin with, by night. This distance of 95,000,000
common antlengths<sup>1</sup> was covered by forced marches in 150
nights--no mean achievement.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> A common antlength (length of a media) is 1/2 inch.
750 miles. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When, after this forward thrust, we made our first stop, we were
in a peculiar country of great rocky mountains clothed with verdure
and studded with lakes, but exhibiting also more or less barren
uplands adorned with only a scanty vegetation of Cecropia and Acacia
trees.</p>

<p>So far, provisioning had offered no difficulty. Our march had led
past a good many friendly cities of our own kind where arrangements
had been made in advance to supply the High Command with shelter and
food. The army as such had never entered these cities; for Assa-ree
had undertaken to look after her own commissariat; and when I found
that she relied entirely on foraging raids, I rested content with
this arrangement. It was essential to reduce our demands on
hospitably-inclined colonies to a minimum; and even when we found
that these fighting hordes of ours reverted very largely to the
aboriginal custom of feeding on carrion, I did not object. For no
matter how we, the High Command, fared, it was important to conduct
matters in such a manner as always to provide amply for the rank and
file.</p>

<p>But now we were entering upon terra incognita; and though we met
at once with other tribes closely related to ourselves, the
&OElig;codomas, we were, for the first time, to have the experience
of finding our overtures tending towards friendly intercourse
repulsed.</p>

<p>To our agreeable surprise, Assa-ree had proved herself equal to
any emergency; but while we continued our advance, literally fighting
our way on all sides, we, the High Command, had at last to go without
food for forty or fifty days. And then our whole advance was brought
to a stop.</p>

<p>We came to a point where an unbroken chain of &OElig;codoma cities
reached from coast to coast in a north-south direction; more than
once we hurled massed bodies of our troops against this chain;
nothing was gained. We had to encamp.</p>

<p>I called a council of war to meet at night. I well remember the
occasion. We were at an elevation of at least 48,000 antlengths above
the sea. All about, we were surrounded by a barren, rocky highland
with a broken surface. In front, at a distance of 63,000 ants, rose a
forbidding escarpment to a height of 3,600 antlengths; but its crown
was covered with a dense forest reaching westward; it was within the
margin of that forest that the line of &OElig;codoma cities barred
our way. Almost overhead stood a full moon; and the atmosphere, in
the open, was chilly enough to stiffen our joints. But the meeting
was held in a recess of perpendicular rocks which retained the heat
of the day. To our left, the remainder of our central body had gone
to rest in a manner which we had learned from our bitterest enemies,
the Eciton Hamatum. This method was as follows: two of the strongest
ants attached themselves with their fore-legs to a low branch of a
dead acacia. To their hind-legs four were clinging; and so on, till,
in the ninth or tenth tier, the flaring curtain thus formed by living
bodies reached a width sufficient to fold over from both sides and to
enclose a hollow funnel which was filled by the remaining ants in a
dense cluster. The army was encamped in a similar manner south of us
and out of sight.</p>

<p>When I opened our deliberations, I gave it as my opinion that, at
no matter what cost of time or energy, we must establish friendly
relations with our cousins, the &OElig;codomas; and two of the
group-leaders, Bissa-tee, the zoologist, and Lemma-nee, the
geographer, were inclined to agree with me. But Anna-zee, the
botanist, pointed out, not perhaps without a semblance of justice,
that it was too late for attempts at conciliation; blood, she said,
had flowed on both sides; it could not be wiped out. So I asked her
what she had to propose; and she replied sardonically that, once
blood had been shed, there was only one remedy and that was to shed
more of it. Anna-zee, as we shall see, often had the disconcerting
knack of brushing aside what she called self-deceptions. At this very
moment I saw Assa-ree stepping into the gap between the walls of our
retreat.</p>

<p>By way of greeting she raised her antenn&aelig; and then brought
them down with a sweeping movement. Both Anna-zee and Bissa-tee spoke
to me later in admiration of the physical grace of this great
ant-of-war; both remarked upon the proud humility of her bearing. I
could not quite understand such a misinterpretation; but, since her
greeting was exclusively addressed to me, I being the only ant she
had to consult, they did perhaps not have a full opportunity to see
her in the same light in which I saw her. I could not overlook the
distinct outward swing which she knew how to impart to the movement
of her antenn&aelig;: it was an unmistakably ironic curve. The scents
with which she proposed a way out of our difficulty were respectful
enough; yet, to me they seemed to be too exaggerated to be quite
sincere. Very briefly, she engaged to induce any colony of
&OElig;codomas to leave their city for our special accommodation,
without the use of force. I was on the point of asking her why, if
such was in her power, she had not offered to do so before blood had
been shed. But my colleagues closed with her offer so
enthusiastically that I thought it best to observe a discreet
silence.</p>

<p>I must give Assa-ree her due: she was as good as her scent. Next
morning we entered a deserted city which contained a wealth of
fungus-gardens quite beyond our requirements. The rest of our High
Command, even Anna-zee and Bissa-tee, far and away the most eminent
of our scholars, accepted this service as a sort of miracle that must
not be too closely questioned; and, for the moment, it solved an
urgent problem.</p>

<p>But before we moved on, I made it my business to investigate. My
motive was neither that of an idle curiosity nor that of a desire to
spy on Assa-ree. But I considered that the safety of the whole
expedition depended on what I am tempted to call my own omniscience
with regard to the doings, the wishes, and the thoughts of all its
members.</p>

<p>Now, at the very time of entering this marvellously well-built
city of the &OElig;codomas I had been struck by the presence of a
faint smell that seemed suspicious. It was not the race-smell of any
leaf-cutting ant; nor was it the adventitious nest-smell peculiar to
every individual colony. These cannot be mistaken by any experienced
contact-odour sense such as I flatter myself to possess. It was an
alien smell, hard to identify because of its faintness. It had,
apparently, not been questioned by anyone else.</p>

<p>The most minute examination of the main entrance-craters failed to
furnish the slightest clue. Then, one day, bent on recreation, I took
a turn in the forest; and quite accidentally I came across a wasp on
the ground which seemed to be expiring; and instantly I recognized
the suspicious smell which here was pungent and pronounced. This
unfortunate wasp had been surprised by an army of Eciton Hamatum; had
been deprived of her power of motion; had been partially dismembered;
and had then, for some mysterious reason, been left behind. I hurried
back to our temporary abode and, armed with this clue, soon
discovered, in a crevice of one of the side-entrances, a tiny
fragment of the abdomen of this very wasp--a fragment so bitten into
and almost chewed up by the powerful sickle-jaws of Ecitons as to
make it practically unrecognizable.</p>

<p>How Assa-ree had got hold of this fragment I can, of course, not
tell; but her scheme now explained itself. These particular Ecitons
must be so powerful, and their power so well known that the mere
suspicion of their approach was enough to put to flight a whole
colony of &OElig;codomas. This Assa-ree knew; and that was the most
disquieting feature of the whole thing. I knew, and I knew that
Assa-ree knew, that we could not forever avoid meeting an army of
these Ecitons; I anticipated, and I suspected that Assa-ree
anticipated, that we should be attacked. If we were, it would be her
task to defend us, it was hard to say with what prospect of success:
an issue before which the stoutest heart might be permitted to
tremble. Yet she could use this fear of the Ecitons to play a joke
upon a whole nation of ants closely related to ourselves and, in a
manner, upon me and my associates. It was not a thought to allay my
secret disquietudes. Above all, I knew from that day on that sooner
or later matters must come to an issue between her and me.</p>

<p>To finish this topic by anticipation: a further discovery was in
store for me. Assa-ree had driven to flight, not only the one colony
of &OElig;codomas which she had promised she would persuade, by
peaceful means, temporarily to abandon their city for our
convenience, but the whole line of colonies stretching across, the
Narrows of the continent. This I discovered in the course of the
following days.</p>

<p>One night, the leaders of the High Command being again in
conference to discuss the best route to follow from that point, she
entered our conclave a second time. The meeting being held in a
subterranean chamber, we were in utter darkness, and I could not
watch her demeanour in detail. But in her greeting to me, in the
course of which she touched first my antenn&aelig;, then my thorax
and head, I seemed again to detect that exaggeration of deference
which could not but conceal her irony. The import of her message was
this. Since we should necessarily have to return by the same route,
she would like to point out the expediency of keeping this gap open.
Lemma-nee, the geographer, was so amazed at the boldness of the
proposal that she squirted out, "Can it be done?" Assa-ree brushed
the question aside by the slightest motion of her antenn&aelig; and
repeated her offer in a scent of affected weariness. I resolved to
embrace the plan and signified as much. I could feel Assa-ree
stiffening: she interpreted my lack of amazement as an affront. Yet
her resentment was expressed by nothing but an increase in deference.
You wish it, she signified, in scents still more subdued than mine
had been, and it is done.</p>

<p>Next morning, when we had left the city, I ascertained, while the
ranks were being formed, that she had cunningly concealed a tiny
fragment of the same wasp in each of the main entrances of the no
less than 103 &OElig;codoma cities which formed the barrier across
the narrowest point of the continent.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>IV</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I must now reach back in time and resume the narrative at the
point where we entered the &OElig;codoma city.</p>

<p>Not far from the northern end of this barrier across the Narrows
and just west of it, stood a city built by man. Although the detailed
zoological and ecological study of man was not directly comprised in
our instructions, I thought it inadvisable to neglect this
opportunity. Man, forming part of that large division of the animal
kingdom called the Mammalia, had been studied previously by a number
of expeditions, but with inconclusive results. It was known that, by
virtue of a number of peculiarities, he occupied a somewhat unique
position within that group. It was suspected, on the ground of things
reported by trustworthy observers, that his position among mammals
might somewhat resemble the position of ants among insects. It had
even been suggested that his development, in the past and in certain
branches of his kind, had almost reached the same level as ours
today; in that case he would represent that most interesting type of
a retrograded or degenerate race; and I must confess I was inclined
to embrace this view. One daring speculator had even hinted that
perhaps man possessed, or at least had possessed, that same imperial
gift of reason which is universally held to be the distinguishing
mark of ants.</p>

<p>Before I summarize what was previously known of man, I will
briefly state what led me to the conclusion that man is a degenerate
type. In this I shall, of course, anticipate the results of later
investigations. In the first place, it is an axiom among biologists
of the first rank that every individual of no matter what species, in
its development from the embryonic state to the imaginal, adult, or
final state, summarizes the development of the race. If, then, it can
be shown that the adult stage, in some essential point, shows a
retrogression from the development reached in an immature phase, the
only conclusion possible to be drawn is that the adult represents a
degenerate type. Now my students will have to take my scent for it
that man's instincts approach plastic intelligence in the young; the
adult shows no trace of it. For proof of this I must refer to
scent-tree number 349. In the second place, I cannot imagine a state
of affairs in which, the animal in question having reached the stage
where a social life (as distinct from a herd life) becomes possible,
as man has, the male is the dominant sex; and it is with man. This is
against all reason. Every male is capable of fertilizing many females
unless it dies in copula (male man does not); yes, the seminal fluid
discharged in a single copulation suffices (at least with us) to
fertilize thousands of ovules; even where the male is not restricted
to a single copulation (as it is with us), it is the rule that, after
having fulfilled its proper function, it serves for such menial
offices only as defence or the labour of procuring food, etc. I
cannot think of any other animal which has developed to the social
stage--distinctly an achievement of the female--and which
nevertheless supports its males in a dominant position. I therefore
conclude that, in the past, man, too, has lived under matriarchy as
we do today. If this conclusion needs further support, that support
is furnished by the fact that young human males play at being
females, acting as though they had brought forth callows and carrying
images of such about in their forelimbs. From this stage, which must
necessarily summarize a lost development of the race, they gradually
degenerate, even individually, into a pure, arrogant, and ignorant
masculinity. This argument seems, to me, to be conclusive.</p>

<p>Now for the summary of our previous knowledge of man.</p>

<p>Even in our own country these destructive animals are to be found
sporadically. As is well known, they kill, without provocation or
discrimination, all living things, sometimes at sight, sometimes
after having enslaved them for a time. The native vegetation on which
the rest of creation depends for shelter and food they destroy by
fire or otherwise.</p>

<p>On an average they are 70 ants long, 36 ants wide, and 20 ants
thick, measuring their length from the top of their heads to the fork
of their extraordinarily long hind limbs. Of these limbs, they have
four though, as a rule, they use only two for locomotion: a fact
characteristic of the contempt in which they hold nature's gifts. The
head resembles a hard sphere of bone overlaid with a thin layer of
pinkish flesh which, in turn, is covered with a more or less
dark-coloured filmy and pliable skin. It is provided with two round,
simple eyes excellent for distant, but singularly ill-adapted for
minute and accurate vision. Two prodigious skinny excrescences served
originally as covers for their ear-passages; but they have long
since, through disuse, become worthless for this purpose. A large,
fleshy protuberance in the centre of the face is presumed to harbour
the vestiges of a sense of smell, also largely lost by neglect. The
mouth, below, consists of a transverse slit armed with bony plates
for mastication and measuring from six to eight ants. The most
striking proof of a lack of natural intelligence, or of its loss, is
to be found in the fact that, by millennia-long neglect, man has
forfeited the most important means of communication, orientation, and
fixation of records, namely, the contact-odour sense. This sense,
which we, by intelligent use and careful breeding, have developed to
such a remarkable acuteness and applied to such sublime purpose, has,
with man, become rudimentary.</p>

<p>Their bodies are not, as ours, protected by a defensive, chitinous
ectoskeleton but with soft integuments of varying composition. I
shall later speak of them again. These integuments have, by certain
zoologists, been used to support the theory that man as a species has
never yet become fixed; they are of such extraordinary variety. The
latest observations, however, had led to the daring theory that man
moults at will. Of this, too, we shall treat later on.</p>

<p>To a certain extent man is social in his habits, not only with
regard to his own kind, but also with regard to certain mammals and
birds which, phylogenetically, stand quite remote from him; as, f.i.,
dogs, cats, parrots, chickens, and others. It is significant that all
his more intimate associates are chosen from the lowest of the great
subdivisions of the animal world, the vertebrates.</p>

<p>Such, apart from a few details which the curious can read up on
any standard scent-tree of zoology, was what was definitely known of
man.</p>

<p>Every now and then, however, the assertion is met with, in some
more speculative monoscent, that certain acts of man, observed and
recorded by careful investigators, argue for at least the traces of a
reasoning power. Such-and-such a thing, it has been said, cannot be
explained by a mere animal urge or "instinct"; it has to be
attributed to more or less conscious deliberation and logical
inference; it seemed to prove the existence of a "plastic
intelligence" directing a "plastic behaviour". But, if many learned
ants have advocated this view, an equal number have scoffed at it.
Reason seemed to be such an incomparably precious gift that it was
hard to imagine other creatures to be endowed with it, creatures
remote from our own race which was by nature destined to rule the
world.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the place for a brief digression. Everybody knows
that in most systems of philosophy evolved in the past it is tacitly
assumed that reason is one and indivisible, as though, to use a bold
metaphor, it had sprung fully armed from the brain of some super-ant.
It is now pretty well acknowledged by most biologists that this
theory or assumption is untenable. Even with us, reason is the result
of a long and slow assimilation of experience, and it is still in the
making. Wherever, therefore, in what follows, the word is used
without qualification, it is to be understood as referring simply to
the present phase of development among Attas.</p>

<p>Here, then, were a number of problems on which I thought it worth
our while to throw as much light as we could. Our present adventure,
however, which must excuse this digression, will be set down without
further comment. The facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>V</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first notice I received of the presence of man in these parts
came from reports given by Assa-ree; it consisted in no more than a
casual mention of the fact that a small colony, comprising some 500
individuals, was located on a bold cliff overjutting the sea.</p>

<p>I commissioned Assa-ree to reconnoitre; and her second report was
more detailed. The colony consisted of a number of dusky individuals
whose integuments were scanty and bright in colour. They were given
to rapid and incomprehensible chatterings resembling those of monkeys
in our native woods. I had a curious suspicion that these chatterings
might conceivably represent their method of communication; for the
widely attested fact of a social life, with its division of labour,
presupposed some such power. Among these darker men lived one
individual differing markedly from the others, both in colour of
facial skin and in integuments. The latter Assa-ree described as pure
white in colour and fine in texture, apart from his hind-feet which
were encased in an ectoskeleton of bright brown and of considerable
hardness. He--it was a male--must have occupied a leading position
among the rest; for a number of the dusky individuals seemed to wait
on him much as certain adult workers of ours wait on Her Majesty. His
abode consisted of a number of lofty and spacious chambers one of
which contained large cases of a transparent, rock-like substance
filled with glittering, uncanny-looking things of unknown
purpose.</p>

<p>These reports inspired me with a desire to see for myself. We knew
from former investigations that man's communities are often vastly
more numerous; I reasoned, therefore, that this was an opportunity to
study him individually, unconfused by numbers.</p>

<p>I had Assa-ree conduct me to the abode of this curious individual.
All her observations were confirmed, and at least one was added:
among the darker individuals waiting upon him was one who, with
regard to the rest (most of them females), occupied a position of
intermediate authority. His integuments closely resembled those of
the master, consisting of white, fine-textured tissues which covered
all but his head, his hands, and his feet; and in one point he was
unique: he had two pairs of eyes, one of them being external and
consisting of the same transparent, rock-like substance as the
mysterious cases of the chamber.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, Assa-ree and I entered this man's abode at
a moment when a dusky female came to call on the master. To our
amazement, the master, ordering the assistant about in a most
peremptory manner, placed the female in a peculiar position in an
ingeniously constructed seat and looked into her mouth. From his
behaviour I was inclined to think that he was going to osculate or to
regurgitate; but suddenly he inserted a claw of his fore-foot into
the open mouth of the female and shouted something to his assistant.
The latter opened one of the transparent cases and took from it a
sinister-looking <i>piece of apparatus</i><sup>2</sup> closely
resembling such tongs as certain aquatic members of the Articulata
exhibit in our own country. This <i>piece of apparatus</i> he handed
to the master who brutally thrust it into the mouth of the female,
seized with it one of the bony plates used for mastication, and, with
a powerful wrench, pulled it out, the female giving a pitiful groan.
Profoundly stirred by the suffering of the victim of this brutality,
I gave Assa-ree the signal of retreat; and we made our exit.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Whenever dealing with man, Wawa-quee's consciousness
became purely visual and was transferred to me in that form. I
recognised this "piece of apparatus", of course, as the sort of tongs
or forceps used by dentists to extract teeth. Whenever such a case
arises in which I understand what the ant does not, I shall, in what
follows, use italics. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Returned to our temporary dwelling, I shut myself up in the
queen's chamber. I will not dwell on my feelings but merely give the
results of my analysis of the facts. He whom I have called the master
had clearly enslaved the one whom I have called the assistant, as
well as the other members of his clan. It was not a case of
co-operation such as exists among ants. What the nature and method of
this enslavement might be remained unexplained; in physical power the
slave was manifestly superior to his master. But he was of a
different variety of the species man; his racial relation to the
master was approximately that of ourselves to the &OElig;codomas, or
the reverse. It was hard to say which; for now the one, now the other
of these two seemed the less civilized.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be best simply to relate what happened next and to
let the curious draw their own conclusions. I will frankly own that I
was little inclined to pursue my studies in this particular abode of
man; and I should have left well enough alone had I not been forcibly
carried back there.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to take Bissa-tee, the zoologist, into my
confidence. As far as Assa-ree was concerned, I had no intention of
letting her look too deeply into my thoughts and secrets. I knew her
to be at heart impatient of my control; and I knew it to be
impossible for her to appreciate my motives. Care for my personal
safety was dictated, of course, not by fear for myself, but by my
solicitude for the fate of the whole expedition the success of which
depended on the preservation of that unity of direction which centred
in myself. I have too often shown that death holds no terror for me
to have to give a cheap exhibition of courage when discretion is
clearly indicated by the circumstances.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee was one of those big, magnificent, and boisterous ants
who will rap their thorax with one antenna while they touch yours
with the other, and who will breeze in and out of a chamber with a
hearty nod; so that everyone mistakes them for commonplace ants and
thinks she knows all about them because they seem to carry their
heart upon the anterior joint. I knew that all this was mere pretence
and that she knew excellently well, as her name, too, signifies, how
to keep her own counsel. That was the reason why we were friends.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that we could not be spied upon, I led her
far from our temporary abode. I took a north-east path which led
close to the wide and open clearing that surrounded the human
village.</p>

<p>But I had hardly begun to explain my perplexities when I was
interrupted. We found we were not alone in this margin of the forest.
The ground shook with the rapid and ponderous tread of some large
animal, presumably a mammal. Both Bissa-tee and myself instantly
ceased from all motion and stood rigid, every muscle taut. And then,
what was my horror when I espied the very assistant of the master man
jumping about close by under the trees, bending over and reaching for
things on the ground! My first impulse was to hide; but the second
impulse was of curiosity. And this second impulse, which I followed,
seemed, for the moment, to prove our undoing; for suddenly the man
was right upon us.</p>

<p>To our amazement, he reached for us, not with the long, slender
toes of his fore-feet, but with a pair of <i>tongs.</i> Before I knew
what was happening, he had grasped me by my pedicel (of all places to
catch an ant: the pedicel!), lifted me and dropped me into a hollow
cylinder of the rock-like, transparent substance repeatedly
mentioned. Bissa-tee promptly followed me; and, to our horror, we
found ourselves confined with a score or two of huge Eciton Hamatum,
our worst enemies. The fear of the Eciton is so inbred in us Attas, I
presume, that, faced with them, we are capable of exertions which
under ordinary circumstances would be beyond our powers. Both
Bissa-tee and myself were, a moment later, clinging to the rough
paper cover of the cylinder. Ordinarily such a leap of at least
fourteen antlengths would have been impossible to any Atta. Yet the
imprisoned Ecitons were themselves too bewildered to pay the
slightest attention to us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our bearer was wildly shaking us up and down: apparently
he was running in his clumsy human way, using only his hind-feet.</p>

<p>Before we had had time to reflect, he had removed the cover from
the cylinder and was shaking us out on a flat white surface of
extraordinary smoothness. There, Bissa-tee and myself, together with
fifty Ecitons, were instantly rushing about in the wildest confusion.
The surface was circular and surrounded by a moat twelve antlengths
wide and filled with water. At last I stopped to recover my breath;
and as I did so, I looked about. Incredibly, we were in that precise
chamber where Assa-ree and I had witnessed the maltreatment of the
human female.</p>

<p>Still more incredibly, that same female was lying like one dead
stretched out on a raised platform close to the glistening plateau on
which we were. Her forefoot was bared to the upper joint and
exhibited a wide, bleeding gash twenty antlengths long and gaping,
with its ragged edges separated by at least four antlengths. How such
a gash can be produced I have of course no means of telling. But, as
I said, red blood was trickling from it.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should explain here what I came to investigate at a much
later stage. Man's blood, like that of all mammals, is confined in
large, tubular vessels and cannot flow outside of them. If he is
wounded and one of these vessels or veins is severed, the blood
escapes instead of simply changing its course and flowing around the
wound as it does with us; and with its escape life itself ebbs
away.</p>

<p>A moment later I saw the master hurrying about; he shouted
something to his assistant, and the assistant answered. Again I
should, perhaps, anticipate and explain that man produces sounds, not
by means of a stridula, but by sending a current of air forcibly over
two chord-like membranes concealed in his throat.</p>

<p>The master approached the female, knelt by her side, and laved the
wound; the assistant stood by, armed with a <i>forceps.</i> By this
time curiosity had completely conquered my panic. The Ecitons were
still rushing wildly about. No greater proof, I believe, can be found
of the superiority of the Atta than the fact that Bissa-tee had
coolly selected a point of vantage from which she watched the
proceedings; and her I now joined on the bank of the moat.</p>

<p>Having finished the task of laving the wound, the master, by a
gesture of his forelimb, gave the assistant a signal; and the latter,
bending over the platform, picked up a giant soldier Eciton, applying
the <i>forceps</i> to her pedicel. I distinctly remember how this
individual opened her formidable and menacing sickle-jaws as though
to attack her captor. There is one thing to be said for the Eciton:
she knows no fear; she is the personification of blind and bold fury;
but she is nothing else; she is a mere fighting machine.</p>

<p>As it turned out, this gesture of menace was exactly what the
human wanted to produce. With a touch much more gentle than I should
have expected him to be capable of, the master took the
<i>forceps</i> from his assistant; and while, with the extended toes
of his free forelimb, he pressed the ragged edges of the gaping wound
in the human female's arm together, he approached, with the other,
the head of the Eciton. At once the ant buried her jaws, on both
sides of the red line, in the human flesh and drew them close
together; whereupon the master slipped his soft toes back by two
ant-lengths and returned the <i>forceps</i> to his assistant. A
second Eciton was picked up; and the proceeding repeated; then a
third and a fourth.</p>

<p>Up to this point I had been so fascinated by what was going on
that I had no eyes for anything else. Now I cast a fleeting glance at
Bissa-tee. To my inexpressible astonishment I saw, behind her, in an
attitude of bold and close scrutiny, my ever-present rival Assa-ree.
Where did she come from? I feel convinced that, like ourselves, she
had been caught by mere chance; but, when questioned, later on, she
had the effrontery to assert, though her boldness was disguised under
an air of almost apologetic modesty, that she had intentionally
allowed herself to be captured in order to find out what these
Ecitons were wanted for. How she came to be in the very locality
which I had sought in order to escape her <i>espionage,</i> she has
never seen fit to explain.</p>

<p>I had not yet completely recovered from what amounted almost to
indignation at her presence when Bissa-tee touched me with her
antenna. The process of closing the wound had been finished.
Twenty-five Ecitons had buried their jaws in the human flesh and were
holding the edges of the wound together.</p>

<p>And now comes the most amazing thing of all: a thing so horrible
that I can barely bring myself to relate it. The master had risen and
was bending over the wounded arm. In one fore-foot he held a new
instrument, a pair of scissors, of the same metal as the forceps.
With this he severed the heads of the Ecitons from their bodies,
allowing the latter to fall to the ground. I nearly swooned. The only
thing which preserved me from so ignominious a breakdown was the
consciousness that, over Bissa-tee's tense body, Assa-ree's median
eye was fastened upon me, with an expression of diabolic
curiosity.</p>

<p>A few moments went by during which I was aware of nothing but my
own efforts not to give way. But suddenly I saw the master bending
over our platform, <i>forceps</i> in one, and the hollow cylinder in
the other fore-limb. He was picking up and re-imprisoning the
remaining Ecitons. Before I knew what to do in order to escape, he
had picked up Bissa-tee, but to my surprise he flung her to the
ground; apparently he did not think her suitable for his purpose. I
was just on the point of running blindly when I also felt myself
grasped. As he lifted me close to his eye, I saw Assa-ree clearing
the moat in a single, magnificent leap. Clearly, fear gave her, too,
strength beyond the measure ordinarily bestowed on ants. The next
moment I was, like Bissa-tee, flung to the ground.</p>

<p>I hastened to escape through the door; but instantly Bissa-tee was
by my side and detained me. I hardly know how I managed to attend to
what she was endeavouring to convey to me. Never before had such an
opportunity offered to measure the tenacity of life in Ecitons: since
we had forbidden vivisection by law, the only specimens on which she
and her colleagues had been able to work had been such as were
mutilated in war; and neither she nor anyone else had ever succeeded
in getting hold of beheaded specimens the exact hour of whose
execution had been known; nor had these specimens ever been free from
other mutilations and wounds. These Ecitons, on the other hand, were
in magnificent health, apart from the fact that they had lost their
heads; and so zoology must claim them, not only in order to determine
the protoplasmic vitality of the Eciton body as such, deprived of the
intelligent direction of the brain and even of the very possibility
of adding to the vital force by feeding it; but also in order to
study the distribution of instincts between body and head. Surely,
she argued, when the head is removed, activities can be directed only
by the dorsal and ventral ganglia. Help me, she added, to drive these
decapitated specimens, or at least some of them, to our station where
I shall provide an orderly as a guard for each individual; and
zoology will owe you an everlasting debt.</p>

<p>I could not help admiring this devotion to science which caused
Bissa-tee entirely to forget the danger she was in, for she had
stopped me in the very door through which numbers of humans were now
passing, lifting and bringing down their huge flat feet; to be caught
between them and the rock-like floor would have been equivalent to a
cataclysm in nature. Nevertheless, I was impatient with her; clearly,
this was the moment to think of our own safety first of all.</p>

<p>But at that juncture Assa-ree appeared, her attitude marking a
peculiar mixture of jaunty nonchalance and solicitude in our service.
As though to set an example of reckless disregard of danger, she came
through the very centre of the wide exit; and when the assistant
appeared behind her, she even stopped till the latter's hard and
smooth hind-foot was directly above her before, with a dexterous and
elegant twist, she evaded the descending destruction.</p>

<p>The remainder of this adventure is chiefly of interest to
specialists; and a detailed report has been given on scent-tree
number 319 to which I must refer the curious. Here I confine myself
to the bald statement that we succeeded in securing twelve of the
decapitated Ecitons whom Bissa-tee kept confined during the remainder
of our stay at the Narrows; when we left, she took them along under
escort. Those whom we did not thus capture returned to their army,
proving thereby that the homing instinct is independent of the
contact-odour sense; though with this restriction that the
individuals captured apparently never discovered that they were not
with an army of their own kind. In fact, when we set out again, they
seemed quite content to travel with us and even anxious never to
stray: travelling was, of course, the natural mode of their lives. It
was sometimes ludicrous to see how they begged for food, palpating us
with imaginary antenn&aelig; and lifting the stumps of their necks as
though they were opening shadowy mouths. Never have I seen a more
striking symbol of such systems of philosophy as try to explain the
universe by means of intuition. Anna-zee, our botanist, indulged in
inexhaustible mirth at the expense of these living corpses. They
lived for 39 days and kept up sufficient energy to continue marching
to within the last but one day of their lives. At no time did they
betray signs of conscious suffering--proof conclusive that the seat
of suffering is the brain, and likely the
imagination.<sup>3</sup></p>

<h2>VI</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The most interesting, not to say alarming feature of this
adventure consisted in the proof which it afforded of the fact that
there were Ecitons about. It was, of course, one of our tasks to
secure what information we could bearing on the life, the habits, and
the anatomy of these ants. But, seeing that their observation was
fraught with considerable danger, I had made up my mind to leave it
over to the end. We could not afford to run the risk of being greatly
reduced in number right from the start; and that was the reason why
we had so far travelled by night. For Ecitons, though almost blind,
hunt in daytime. In view of their at least partial blindness, this
could not be explained by conditions of light. In fact, there is one
race of Ecitons which is absolutely blind (Eciton C&aelig;cum); and
these hunt with the same efficiency, if not a greater one as those
endowed with a vestige of sight, and, what is more important, also in
daytime. They are almost completely hypog&aelig;ic; and when they
have to cross open rocky stretches where not even a cover of dead
leaves is available, they construct superterranean galleries, using a
sort of masonry in the construction of which they are highly adept.
Since this race of the blind Ecitons is the one which is
geographically most widely distributed, it can readily be inferred,
as Bissa-tee pointed out, that the whole trend of evolution, within
that genus, must be in the direction of blindness: for some reason or
other blindness favours, instead of handicapping, them in the
struggle for existence. The fact, then, that Ecitons hunt in daytime
must be explained by conditions of temperature rather; and this led
me to a further conjecture. Our geographers had already reported
that, though our progress in a south-north direction had so far been
small, the whole trend of the Narrows being westward, there had
already been a slight lowering of the mean temperature, perceptible
only to trained observers and by the most delicate physiological
tests. The spread between the temperatures at noon and midnight had
also increased. This led me to think that, since sooner or later our
route would bend more and more to the north, this lowering of the
mean temperature would become more and more pronounced. If, then, the
difference between day and night was even here sufficient to force
the Ecitons to go into bivouac at night, it seemed highly probable
that, as we proceeded north, the limit of their distribution would be
reached as soon as the daytime temperature fell to a low enough
level, at least occasionally, to prevent their being abroad: from
then on only did I think it safe to travel during the day.</p>

<p>When, therefore, our work at this station was finished and we all
had sufficiently recovered from the effects of fatigue and hunger, I
set the hour of departure once more for sunset. To omit all detail,
we thus marched for another 27 nights. Many minor observations were
made by geographers, zoologists, botanists and meteorologists; and
these were reported every morning before we went into our cluster
camp. When they were of special interest or too long to be committed
to memory, Adver-tee was employed to record them on trees marked in
some conspicuous way, so that we could pick them up again on our way
home. I often admired the skill with which Adver-tee could compress a
great deal of meaning into very brief scents.</p>

<p>And then, quite unexpectedly, we met with an extraordinary
obstacle: the whole continent was cut in two by water. It was not a
river, for the banks were straight and perpendicular, unmistakably
artificial, and of smooth stone. As we found later, it was a work
constructed by man: an engineering feat not unworthy of ants. For the
moment, however, we did not know that; or I should at once have
concluded that no doubt ways and means had been provided for crossing
this canal. As it was, there was nothing to do but to go into
quarters. This was the first place where we resolved to excavate a
cache or burrow in which to plant our own fungi. In this, our chief
difficulty arose, of course, from the fact, which I had foreseen,
that, we having no minims along to weed and cultivate the
plantations, the latter were at once overrun with great masses of
unsuitable and even poisonous fungi; and this necessitated burrows of
a size quite out of proportion to our numbers. Before our present
necessities were relieved by the accident to be related, the new hill
had reached the following dimensions: superficial diameter 768
antlengths, depth 380 antlengths; number of chambers averaging 60
antlengths in one and 20 in another direction, 94.</p>

<p>Meanwhile large adventitious bodies of locally represented ants
were pressed into service by Assa-ree whose methods I did not care to
enquire into; the end was welcome even if the means were not. For it
was clear that this great obstacle could be overcome only by a daring
feat of our own: we had resolved to fill in this canal or, failing in
this, to throw a dam across it. For a whole moon an ever-increasing
multitude (they must in the end have amounted to many hundreds of
thousands) was employed in rolling pellets of clay over the edge of
the embankment. Two shifts of workers prepared the pellets; and two
relays were employed in dumping them, so that the work went forward
without intermission, day and night. We soon came to the conclusion
that this great task would take us a year and 200 days to
accomplish.</p>

<p>And then an almost incredible event solved our difficulties for
us. One night it was reported to me that a floating monster carrying
many men was coming down from the north. I investigated at once and
found this monster to consist of a huge aquatic beetle resembling in
more than one way a firefly. Every Atta is, of course, familiar with
the purely aerial fireflies of our country<i>;</i> but the size of
this monster was almost unbelievable: it measured in length at least
7,000 antlengths.</p>

<p>Now, as this monstrous beetle came floating along, with a humming
noise, and as it was on the point of passing our station--where all
those of us who were endowed with eye-sight stood aligned on the bank
of this enormous ditch--the labour which we had so far expended in
the endeavour to dam the canal bore fruit in an entirely unexpected
manner: the beetle got caught between the far bank and our talus
which by this time reached out into the water to a distance of 350
ant-lengths. The firefly came to with a terrific crash which
dislocated the masonry of both banks. The whole floating population
of men, borne along by the monster, was knocked off their feet; and
even we were overthrown by the impact.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>4</sup> See New York <i>Daily Mail</i> of April 16, 1924 for
a report of this accident from the human side. The paper ascribes it
to a land-slide. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Again I must give Assa-ree her due. Very few minutes had elapsed
before she reported to me that she had established a practicable
route to the other side. I had to trust her blindly; for obviously,
if we were to profit by this extraordinary accident, no time was to
be lost. Beings who were able to construct such works as this canal
and to tame such insects as this beetle would soon find means to
extricate themselves. By one powerful emission of the proper scent I
issued the order to assemble and to obey Assa-ree in every point.</p>

<p>It was night; and the task of crossing was dangerous in the
extreme. But Assa-ree had provided for everything. Along the whole
route, with the exception of a few gaps of which I am going to speak,
she had stationed huge, alien ants holding in their jaws small
fireflies of the kind familiar to us; and these emitted a pale,
greenish light. They had already been employed to carry on the
night-work. Now they illumined a narrow, precipitous path through the
ruined masonry of the hither bank; and when, ultimately, we reached
the far bank, they were similarly lined up along its acclivity.
Assa-ree was here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee, Anna-zee, Lemma-nee, and myself led the way, Bissa-tee
in her intrepid manner ahead of us all. We wound our way down almost
to the water's edge, first through a rough and almost impassable gap
in the displaced rocks, then over the talus constructed by our gangs.
As we approached the water, Assa-ree appeared, enjoining caution. The
road abutted above the water at a point where, opposite, a round,
circular hole gaped like a trachea in the flank of the beetle. The
gap, of perhaps 120 antlengths, was bridged by a yielding and
excessively narrow, but tough and resistant sort of cable the
histological nature of which we had no time to examine. In itself it
would have admitted of no other passage than in single file. But
Assa-ree signalled a halt and issued an order. Whereupon several
hundred ants poured on to this bridge; these fastened themselves
sideways to the yielding fibres and thereby trebled its width. At a
further signal from Assa-ree we proceeded, marching four abreast. In
the opening of the trachea, Assa-ree was waiting for us.</p>

<p>What we walked over next, inside of the beetle, is beyond my
guessing. It was a tremendous task; for we had no light here; but
Assa-ree, keeping ahead of us, scented the road. At last we came out
on the far side; and it seemed that we had escaped one danger only to
succumb to another. Here there was no bridge. We were 200 or 300
antlengths above the water, and the bank was as far away.</p>

<p>Assa-ree, however, ran down the perpendicular flank of the beetle
and out on the water. As we discovered when we followed her, she was
supported from below by a chain of ants clinging together, six or
eight abreast, and submerged in the chilling flood. Never in my life
had I touched anything as cold as this water; but for good or evil we
were committed; and we struggled on.</p>

<p>Assa-ree left us; nor was there any need for further guidance; the
moment we set foot on solid ground, the fireflies lighted us again;
and we were soon on top of the bank. It took the greater part of the
night for the army to cross; and all the time there was a noisy and
mysterious commotion going on among the humans on or within the
beetle. When the last of us had landed, the grey of dawn was showing
in the east; and still there remained one task: the living float of
ants had to be withdrawn from the water; for we could not think of
leaving them who had been the means of our accomplishing the crossing
to drown in the icy floods of this tremendous cut.</p>

<p>However, this was soon done, and all of them were taken, in the
mandibles of our carriers, to a wooded patch west of the canal where
the rising sun restored all but one to consciousness and normal
life.</p>

<p>Such was the great adventure of the human <i>canal.</i></p>

<p>It came as an anticlimax when our geographers, shortly after,
discovered that this cut was, at regular intervals, provided with
gates over which we could have crossed without any trouble. At any
rate, this discovery settled all my worries with regard to our
eventual return.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>VII</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Thus, for another five months, we proceeded by night marches. How
the army fared I am unable to say; I did not enquire. As for
ourselves, the High Command, we never ate for weeks and weeks. It was
a hardship which we bore cheerfully for the sake of the cause.</p>

<p>As I have hinted, even our night marches yielded a rich harvest of
observations, geographical, meteorological, botanical and zoological.
My conjecture that the trend of the continent would be more and more
northward was soon confirmed; and though the fact might have admitted
of various interpretations, the mean temperature kept falling. Many
circumstances led us to think that the continent was widening out,
and this was corroborated when, a little later, the whole country was
mapped. Naturally, the farther we were at any point from the sea, the
greater would be the spread between day and night.</p>

<p>At last we came to a country where the whole character both of the
flora and the fauna underwent a subtle change. Thus, of 356 nocturnal
species of Blattoid beetles observed in our own country--a group
which had so far varied very little, by the occasional disappearance
of this or that species and the addition of a few others--we were
almost suddenly, i.e., within, let me say, a week's march, able to
locate only 41; and the remainder of the new Blattoid fauna consisted
of species not found before. The close biological connection which,
so far, had existed between our own country and the region traversed
was reduced to a slender thread.</p>

<p>This led me to a new conjecture which I wanted to verify; and so I
proclaimed another halt. We were at the northern end of a noble sheet
of water from the south end of which a not inconsiderable river
flowed roughly eastward. The surface, along the east shore of this
lake, was less rugged. It was clothed by magnificent forests
containing many trees new to us. Man was more common here, too; but I
was inclined to disregard this source of danger. To a lesser extent,
another consideration decided me, namely the desirability of
recuperating our strength; I knew from experience that a total
abstinence from food impaired our mental powers when prolonged beyond
six or seven moons.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Miss Fielde demonstrated the limit of time during
which maxims live without food to be 9 months; though queens, of
course, go without food in the natural course of events even longer.
E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now this district abounded with Attiine ants of a variety hitherto
unknown to us. I have made bold to name them after myself Atta
Wawaqueensis. And these ants had not attacked us.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p><sup> </sup></p>

<p><sup>6</sup> It is, of course, impossible for a human
myrmecologist to identify this species exactly. The "noble sheet of
water" I was at first inclined to identify with the Lake of
Nicaragua. But the geographical details given point to a more
northern location. Every detail applies to the north end of Fonseca
Bay, on the Pacific coast. But Fonseca Bay is salt; and I should
expect this important fact to be mentioned by so accurate a recorder
as Wawa-quee. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I, therefore, deputed Azte-ca, head of the department of
communications, to make an attempt at establishing friendly relations
with them. In this she was entirely successful; and the whole High
Command was most hospitably received in a huge city of these ants
where we were assigned separate chambers and separate fungus-gardens.
We had hardly entered our quarters when Her Majesty Angza-alla-antra
sent to command my presence; and in a brief interview she insisted on
having me with her during our stay, as her personal guest. Though I
feared that this honour would in a measure restrict my freedom of
movement, I could not very well refuse it; royalty will be
served.</p>

<p>Before I say any more about our hosts, I will briefly mention
that, as soon as we were established, I despatched Lemma-nee, our
leading geographer, with a dozen of her associates, on a survey of
this part of the continent; and I will anticipate here by stating
that this continent was found to have narrowed again and that,
further, a transverse valley forming a climatic barrier was found to
stretch right across it, from coast to coast, with a pass crossing
the mountains at an elevation of little more than 67,000 antlengths.
This confirmed my conjectures completely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the absence of this sub-expedition, we lived
comfortably with our hosts, the Wawaqueenses. For the benefit of her
subjects Her Majesty asked me in the most flattering manner to
deliver a number of scentures on our travels and their scientific
results. The reception of these scentures was all that could be
expected; but it struck me that those delivered on the more
adventurous parts held a greater appeal than those dealing with
purely scientific results. This interest in mere narrative, I might
say right now, became more and more pronounced as we proceeded north.
If I do say it myself, though my own interests are exclusively
scientific, I seem to have the gift of carrying away the masses by my
scents.</p>

<p>Particularly vivid is my memory of the enormous tension which took
hold of the multitudes assembled on the slopes of the mound when I
related the adventure with the wounded she-man. From all that vast
assembly--when I came to the more dramatic parts--not a scent was to
be perceived till I reached the moment of our escape. I must say
that, while delivering this scenture, I was standing at the very edge
of one of the main entrance craters. When I reached that point,
however, I was nearly thrown into a faint by a most powerful scent
proceeding from behind and below me. Although the same scent was
emitted by the countless thousands ranged in front of me, this
particular scent was more concentrated than that of all the others
combined. Startled, I half turned; and down there, a few ant-lengths
below the surface, I caught sight of Her Majesty Angza-alla-antra
who, accompanied by only a few of her favourite maxim attendants, was
listening in.</p>

<p>Later on she reproved me for never scenting to her privately in
such a fascinating way. I apologized, stating that I had thought she
would prefer to be instructed rather than entertained. But she gave
me such a scent, combined with a gentle touch of her antenn&aelig;,
that I could not defend myself against the suspicion that her
feelings for me were different from those of mere respect and
friendship. This suspicion became a certainty when, soon after, I
being alone with her, she hinted to me in the most delicate but
somewhat agitated way, her emotions betraying themselves by the
trembling of her gaster, that, alas, she was not happy. When I looked
up, she added, in a scarcely perceptible scent, that at this moment
she had only two regrets. I could not but notice that she wanted to
be urged to divulge what they were; and though I felt most
uncomfortable, I scented to her that, having honoured me above all
ants by going so far in her avowals, I should henceforth live in
tortures unless she scented me all. She seemed to languish for a
while; but at last she hung her head; and I had the greatest
difficulty in catching her next scents which were to this effect: she
wished, firstly, that she were not yet dealated; and, secondly, that
I were a male. I knew well what, on such an occasion, etiquette
prescribes at home; but I trembled lest Wawaqueensic custom differed
considerably from our own. Yet I could not remain inactive. I
approached her in the humblest way and offered osculation; to my
surprise I found it was regurgitation she wanted; and fortunately I
could serve her in that, too. Having received it, she seemed on the
point of fainting; and she weakly waved her antenn&aelig; to intimate
her desire to be left alone.</p>

<p>But it is time that I return to the sub-expedition sent out under
the command of our geographer-in-chief. This sub-expedition had now
been absent for over a month, and, the country swarming with Ecitons,
I was beginning to worry about its fate. Lemma-nee was one of those
small, inconspicuous maxims whose most prominent characteristic is an
excessive modesty. To see her, nobody would have thought her capable
of daring or endurance; yet she possessed both these qualities in the
highest degree. I knew that, if her task could be carried out at all,
she would carry it to a successful issue. But the very nature of that
task demanded daylight travel; for angles had to be taken to distant
points; base-lines had to be laid off; descriptions of surface
conditions had to be secured without travelling over every
square-inch of ground. Elevations, it was true, she could secure by
means of her living barometers whose protoplasmic flow had previously
been ascertained under all sorts of atmospheric conditions. Whatever
data could be secured without trigonometric calculations had all
along been recorded.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to wait one more half moon and, if we received
no news, to send out a relief party in search of her.</p>

<p>This interval having elapsed, I called a council which I invited
Assa-ree to attend. Little as I wished to be beholden to her, she had
given too many proofs of her resourcefulness for me to leave her out
of account.</p>

<p>At this meeting Bissa-tee did most of the scenting. She proposed
that the search party should be small and that it must consist of
ants whose eye-sight was especially acute. For, she reasoned, the
country being infested by Ecitons, scent-rays emitted by Lemma-nee
and her party would be interfered with by the fecal odours of these
hostile tribes--odours so strong that they would drown out, by night
as well as by day, any signals given by Attas. There remained, then,
only the sense of sight as a means of search. It implied daylight
travelling; and a small party would be better able to escape
detection than a large one. In a blundering sort of way which made me
quite impatient, she took it upon herself to name those whom she
considered best adapted for the work: Assa-ree, herself, and me.</p>

<p>That, of course, settled the question. Her reasoning was acute and
correct enough; and the remaining members of the council heaved a
scent of relief at being omitted from the list. Assa-ree fixed her
central median eye on myself; and I could not even betray the
slightest hesitation. I nodded; and the council adjourned.</p>

<p>We got ready at once; and after a touching farewell from Her
Majesty we set out on our perilous trip. Details are wearisome. Let
it suffice that, for close on to a moon, we travelled criss-cross
over the country to the south and south-west of our station without
finding sign or trace of Lemma-nee and her party. A hundred times we
had hair-breadth escapes from Ecitons. It was a life of unceasing
agitation which Bissa-tee seemed to enjoy to her heart's content. But
not everybody delights in breathless flight from a powerful enemy.
Assa-ree behaved admirably; and when the dangers surrounding us
seemed, at the last, to admit of no further escape, it was she who
saved our lives, though I almost hated her for it. She was of that
type which seems to have all her faculties sharpened by circumstances
which deprive others of their power of thought.</p>

<p>This situation in which we finally found ourselves was as follows.
In a lofty forest of broad-leaved trees which allowed no ray of
sunlight to penetrate their foliage, so that there was no
undergrowth, we came head-on in contact with the scouts of an Eciton
army. What made this possible was the fact that, throughout this
forest, the atmosphere was so heavy with the fecal odour often
referred to as to make any intensification imperceptible.</p>

<p>We retreated hastily; but in our flight we were taken between two
further armies advancing in such a manner as to converge upon
ourselves. There seemed to be no chance of escape; if caught, I knew
we should be torn limb from limb and devoured.</p>

<p>Assa-ree had arrived at the same conclusion; but her infernal
resourcefulness did not leave her.</p>

<p>She bade us stop; and with one of her amazing jumps she
disappeared behind a tree. Less than a second later she reappeared, a
large spider in her jaws. This spider, to my momentary disgust, she
urged me, in an almost imperious manner, to grasp by her pedicel; and
I actually did so. Once more she dis- and re-appeared with a similar
spider for Bissa-tee. Then she beckoned us and hastened to the only
tree which had a branch growing out from the trunk at the low height
of perhaps 150 antlengths. Here she dexterously caught a third spider
and then climbed up the trunk and out on the branch, with her capture
in her jaws.</p>

<p>I surmised that very likely she knew what she was about, though I
had not the slightest idea what it might be.</p>

<p>By this time we could not only scent one of the approaching armies
almost below us; we could also hear the twittering of the birds which
always follow these armies on their predatory marches; chief among
them being the ant-thrush wrongly so-called.</p>

<p>There we sat on the branch in a row, the three of us, watching.
The nearer of the threatening armies was coming from our right or
from the east; and as we peered out, the other column, approaching
from the west, suddenly swerved and disappeared in the undergrowth
south of us.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the nearer army swarmed all around our tree.
There were hundreds of thousands of them; the total body was at least
200 antlengths wide and ten times as long; and all these ants were
hurrying and scurrying in the utmost excitement and fury. Wherever
they advanced, they took immense numbers of insects by surprise:
crickets, grasshoppers, centipedes, wood-lice, beetles, spiders, and
others. Every tree they passed at once swarmed with smaller columns
branching off from the main body. I inferred that even this limb on
which we were would not protect us. The insects which they surprised
indulged, in their mortal fear--for they well knew their danger--in
the most amazing antics. Grasshoppers started a series of desperate
leaps, scores of antlengths in height; but every time they touched
the ground an Eciton, large or small, fastened dexterously on to one
of the great legs and, during the upward spring, secured herself to
femur or body. Among these were winged grasshoppers; and as they flew
up, the birds hovering over the column as camp-followers rushed
forward and caught them in their cruel beaks. The grasshoppers that
tried to save themselves by leaping were undone by the very
extravagance of their exertions; for they soon tired and, whenever
they rested for even a fraction of a second, scores of Ecitons
swarmed over them; and in a moment their enormous jumping-legs were
severed from their bodies. All these myriad insects were at once torn
to pieces and cut into fragments just small enough to be handled by
the carriers who rushed them to the rear of the column. Though every
single member of the army was moving about at utmost speed, the
motion of the army as such was quite unhurried.</p>

<p>At last they arrived at the foot of the tree on which we were.
Close to the trunk, but fastened to the branch, hung the huge paper
nest of a species of wasps. This nest was promptly invaded; and while
the adult wasps hovered about, humming angrily and in deathly fear,
the Ecitons ran through all the inner chambers, carrying off the eggs
and the larv&aelig; and pup&aelig; and young which they dropped to
the ground where they were at once picked up by the carriers. Above
the branch there was a bird's nest, in a hole of the trunk where
another branch had decayed. It was the nest of a trogon and contained
young birds. This nest was invaded next; though the adult bird at
first picked off the advancing ants singly, it was soon put to
flight; and a minute or so later various-sized fragments of the flesh
of the young began to be dropped to the ground from the edge of the
hole.</p>

<p>So far, our branch had remained unexplored; but the column which
was returning from the bird's nest invaded it at last.</p>

<p>Up to this point, Assa-ree had coolly watched every motion of the
ants on the tree. Now she gave a signal and carefully placed the
spider she was carrying on the very edge of the branch. Promptly,
with all the signs of mortal fear, it attached itself to the bark
and, spinning out an extra-strong thread, began to drop. Assa-ree
followed her, climbing down the thread which was still sticky and so
offered her feet an excellent hold. Needless to say that both
Bissa-tee and myself did exactly as she did. The spiders lowered
themselves to within thirty antlengths of the ground which was
covered by the excited and sanguinary hordes. Assa-ree waited till
they had come to a stop; then she descended with a rush; and the poor
spiders, mistaking us for Ecitons, in their panic bit off the thread
and dropped, to be torn to pieces forthwith. I distinctly saw
Assa-ree's antenn&aelig; jerking with a chuckle. She considered it
the height of a good joke to sacrifice to the thirst for blood of
these Ecitons those very spiders which had saved our lives.</p>

<p>At this point my strict veracity forces me to reveal what I should
gladly suppress, in spite of the fact that it holds considerable
physiological interest. Ever since Her Majesty Angza-alla-antra had
revealed her tender feelings for me I had occasionally been visited
by a queer sensation in my ovaries. In fact, I had not been quite
normal. I must protest, however, that never before, nor ever since,
had or have I indulged in treasonable practices. But at this moment
of extreme excitement I simply could not help myself. I dropped a
parthenogenetic egg into the midst of the Ecitons where, I am glad to
be able to say, it was at once devoured. The fact did not escape
Assa-ree's cool vigilance; and, to my discomfiture and indignation,
she emitted three brief and faint scents, "Oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>The Ecitons were meanwhile much puzzled. In addition to the egg,
they had our scent; but, being nearly blind, they failed to see us;
and the threads of the spiders escaped the notice of those who were
above us on the branch.</p>

<p>We were now in a marvellously favourable position for observation;
for we were suspended directly above the army of Ecitons and could
see in great detail all that has already been described. One more
incident I must record on account of its ludicrous effect. A large
harvest-man or false spider had been overtaken by the ravenous
hordes. Undoubtedly he had been where we saw him from the beginning.
He was a huge fellow, with legs three and four antlengths long. When
I first noticed him, he was standing in the very midst of his
enemies, each of the eight legs stretched straight up, at right
angles to the ground, so that he stood on his very toes, with his
body just out of reach of the boldest jumpers among these ants. He
was looking down and watching his enemies with the greatest coolness.
When an Eciton tried to use one of his legs as a ladder to scale the
prize, he carefully lifted it; and sometimes he lifted several of
them at a time. Once I saw him painstakingly but precariously
balanced on three of his eight legs, the other five being lifted high
above the level of his body.<sup>7</sup> Though I have no liking for
these harvest-men, I was so pleased with his circumspection and
cool-headedness that I was carried away and, in my enthusiasm,
emitted a very perceptible scent of applause. I truly believe that I
thereby saved his life; for the Ecitons within a radius of 60 or 70
antlengths, catching the scent, were thrown into complete confusion
and, for several seconds, forgot all about the harvest-man. In
consequence of which he had a welcome chance to rest on all his eight
legs. I am glad to say that, when the Ecitons finally moved on, he
was still alive.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>7</sup> See Belt's <i>Naturalist in Nicaragua,</i> end of Ch.
II, for a similar incident. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I am equally glad to say that Lemma-nee, our learned little
geographer-in-chief, was found late that very day, her return having
been delayed by just such encounters with Ecitons as we had had. The
number of her party, however, had been reduced from twelve to nine,
three of them having been dismembered by our enemies. The detailed
report of her adventures was at once scented on the trunk of a large
Heliconia tree; and it has since been made accessible to all Attas on
scent-tree number 423 to which the curious are referred. Having thus
attained the purpose of our sojourn at this station, we prepared for
a further advance, though we viewed the prospect of leaving our kind
hosts with regret. Her Majesty Angza-alla-antra was pleased to confer
upon me the title of S.I.R., making me a lady of her realm, perhaps
hoping that I should thereby be induced to stay. But of course it
could not be.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Again we had been travelling for weeks and weeks, yes, months and
months, first at night, then in daytime. The number of our High
Command had been sorely reduced from 162, exclusive of Assa-ree, to
129. The army was unimpaired in strength and fighting power; but I
suspected even then that this was due to Assa-ree's machinations in
recruiting new soldiers as we went. Her facility in ingratiating
herself with members of alien races had long since made me think that
there was at least some truth in those rumours that had been current
with regard to her. Yet I saw no reason to interfere; so far even her
possible treasons served the ends of the expedition.</p>

<p>On leaving the Wawaqueenses we had gone straight north. I wished
to verify my conjecture regarding the gradual change of temperature
incident to the increase in latitude. I also wished to leave the
Ecitons behind; and these two things were found to be closely
connected: with the fall of the mean temperature the limit of their
geographical distribution was soon reached. Consequently we were, for
a while, able to lead a comparatively quiet and uneventful life,
though the expedition was not, for that reason, bare of results. On
the contrary, the scientific interest was enhanced rather than
diminished: the farther north we went, the greater became the
divergence in climatic conditions and, therefore, in flora and fauna,
between our home country and the districts traversed.</p>

<p>Strange to say, of our own great family one nation seemed to be
omnipresent though never dominant. These were the Ponerines,
scavengers by nature. They are the most primitive ants, prototypes
from which, I believe, all others have been developed in the course
of untold geologic ages.</p>

<p>In the districts visited, the size of their colonies is
insignificant; and their workers are monomorphic though, as would be
expected from their entomophagous habits, by no means small. In fact,
our own tropical Dinoponera is among the largest of all known ants,
the worker measuring no less than two and a half common antlengths,
Attiine measure. Another striking characteristic of Ponerine ants
consists in the fact that their larv&aelig; spin cocoons in enpuping,
a fact which connects them with the lower orders of insects. And
lastly, their larv&aelig; are fed with the raw meat of insects,
without regurgitation--a most primitive feature.</p>

<p>All Ponerines are endowed with excellent eye-sight; and this led
me to conclude that even those that kill their prey and are not true
scavengers probably hunt singly instead of in armies. The partial or
total blindness of the Eciton is of great advantage to the species,
for it forces every individual to remain in close and unbroken
contact with the army; and since, politically, they are far enough
advanced to be communistic, it ensures food for all. I have observed
a small Eciton Predator that was continually distracted from the
common task by bright-coloured objects, such as butterflies; and
having had her captured, I found on examination that she was abnormal
in having well-developed eyes, both stemmata and ommatidia. But
Ponerines, especially those that, in addition to being scavengers,
are also hunters, are well served by their excellent eye-sight.</p>

<p>All the species which we had an opportunity to observe--and I
believe they comprise the fullest list ever catalogued--had certain
features in common. Above all, they are savage: they resemble man in
so far as they attack whatever moves and lives, either killing it or,
if that is beyond their powers, stinging ferociously and injecting
poisonous secretions. To us, though, they presented no danger; for,
partly on account of the small number contained in each colony,
partly on account of their clumsiness and their entire lack of
science, they were no match for even small detachments of our army.
In fact, Assa-ree considered them almost beneath her notice.</p>

<p>One point, however, had never been cleared up with regard to even
such species as are found in our native woods; and my excellent
friend Bissa-tee would not hear of letting an opportunity go by to
investigate it. It had been asserted that, though the pup&aelig; are
enclosed in cocoons, the adults hatch from the pupa without outside
aid; in other words, that midwifery was unknown among Ponerines. If
this could be proved by actual observation, it would indeed raise the
hypothesis of the primitive nature of these ants to the dignity of an
established fact.</p>

<p>Since the pup&aelig; could be observed only within the nests, the
undertaking had its difficulties. Bissa-tee, however, who was the
moving spirit in this investigation, worked out an excellent plan;
and since that plan proved her to share at least part of my
suspicions with regard to Assa-ree, I will give it in detail.</p>

<p>She proposed that she, Assa-ree, and myself should once more work
together. Her plan was not without its delicate touch of humour.
Assa-ree was to capture, or cause to be captured, a large myriapod
which was to be killed. All three of us were then to be encased in
the fatty tissues from its body. The fat, Bissa-tee asserted, if
applied carefully, so as not to leave a single ever so minute part of
our armour exposed, would completely absorb our tribal odour and
surround us with an aura familiar to these Ponerines. If, then, we
could enter a colony of Lobopelta or of Stigmatomma by night and with
sufficient care, we should have a good chance of escaping detection.
Just why Bissa-tee was so emphatic about having Assa-ree along, she
would not tell me; I gave in to her wish because I trusted her
implicitly.</p>

<p>Both Stigmatomma and Lobopelta were common in the district; and
our choice was entirely one of convenience. The nests of both species
are burrows in the ground; their single entrances are surrounded by
circular crater-like walls built of sand-grains to a not
inconsiderable height. We selected a Stigmatomma nest for our
investigation for no other reason than that its slanting gallery was
the largest in diameter that we could find. It happened to be the
only one into which I thought I could descend without making a noise
by hitting my head against its walls; it has already been inferred
that my brain is of phenomenal size.</p>

<p>We chose a moonless night for the enterprise. Though we had been
informed by our scouts that the Ponerines do not place sentinels at
the exits of their nests, we wanted to make sure that at least we
were not seen.</p>

<p>Lemma-nee was good enough, before we left our temporary burrow, to
verify our disguise. Only when she declared herself satisfied that no
ant, however acute her contact-odour sense might be, would suspect us
of being anything but ants feeding on myriapods did we venture
out.</p>

<p>Our procession to the burrow was in single file, Assa-ree leading
and Bissa-tee following. This order was indicated because I found
myself unable to pick up the scent laid down by our scouts for our
guidance: the myriapod scent seemed to drown out all else. Besides, I
wanted Bissa-tee in front of me so that she could, in our descent
into the gallery, give me warning of any obstruction against which I
might bring up with my head.</p>

<p>We scaled the circular rim with the utmost precaution. Not a
sand-grain did we dislodge. Arrived at its crest, Assa-ree descended
inside, in a slanting direction, till she reached level ground.
Bissa-tee, taking hold, with a hind-foot of hers, of a fore-foot of
mine, followed till she made contact with Assa-ree. Thus a living
parapet was established to facilitate my descent.</p>

<p>The night was exceedingly dark; and as soon as we had located the
entrance, we filed into it. I found it very difficult not to touch
the walls with my head; but everything went as well as it could
possibly go. Presently we arrived in the first chamber of the burrow,
spacious for so small a colony. We palpated the walls in order to
find our way. Bissa-tee showed her usual intrepidity by signalling to
us to remain motionless while she reconnoitred the galleries opening
from this entrance hall.</p>

<p>She returned in a few moments, communicating the result of her
exploration by touches of her antenn&aelig;. Straight ahead lay the
spherical chamber of the queen; to the right of it there was a
passage too narrow for us and leading she did not know where; to the
left, a wider passage led to the brood chambers of which there were
three, one containing eggs, one larv&aelig;, and the third one
pup&aelig;. Opposite the latter, she reported, was a niche in the
wall large enough to receive us; but it was doubtful whether there
would be light enough to observe what we had come to observe. I did
not see that we could do anything but proceed to that niche and
signified my opinion to that effect.</p>

<p>So far, there had not been the slightest alarm. We had, however,
hardly arrived in the niche, when a Stigmatomma worker followed us;
apparently she was attracted by our scent. We flattened ourselves
against the wall; for detection would have frustrated our whole
design.</p>

<p>We were aware of her slow and cautious approach; and I, being the
hindmost, was the first to be reached. For several minutes nothing
happened except that I felt her palpating me.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, I felt a sharp pain in my
abdomen, just above my repugnatorial glands. I could, of course, give
vent to my feelings neither by scent nor by sound. It was a most
embarrassing situation; for the Stigmatomma seemed to have no hostile
intentions. For several moments I was at a loss to explain her savage
bites; then it dawned upon me that, very naturally, she was mistaking
me for a myriapod and thought she had found a banquet. I endured the
pain as best I could and did not stir; but I began to fear that she
would bite her way into me far enough to find out what misconception
hers was. So, in the most cautious way, I brought one antenna forward
and, by careful palpation communicated my predicament to
Bissa-tee.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee acted at once. Just what she did, I was not aware of at
the time; but the fact was that the Stigmatomma ceased from her
attack on my vitals. When, later on, I asked Bissa-tee by what means
she had prevailed upon this ferocious little savage to leave me
alone, she just jerked her antenn&aelig; in silent mirth; and every
allusion to the matter threw her into fits of merriment. It was at
least a fortnight before she would give me the slightest hint as to
her proceeding. Then she asked me suggestively whether I was female
or not? When I indignantly replied that I hoped at least I was no
male, she went on to say that she wasn't either; but that she knew,
for all that, how a male would behave if he met a buxom lass at
midnight in a dark lane in the clouds; not for nothing was she a
zoologist; and for at least five minutes she could not control her
amusement. When I, half angrily, protested that I did not understand,
she became serious. Even we, she intimated--and I could not but
acknowledge the justice of her remark--even we, Atta maxims, had
feelings of a certain kind--well, in one scent, feelings; and
occasionally we laid eggs; at least she had done so; and so had I;
even though it might be thought treason; and of course, they had been
entirely parthenogenetic. Well, if even we were not free from such
visitations, how much less could a Stigmatomma be expected to resist
temptation--an ant of the very lowest order, only a single step
removed from a prototype in which sexual and worker functions must
have been united in every single individual! In fact, she added, the
ovarian tubules of many Ponerine workers are the same in structure
and number as those of their queens; and some have even a
receptaculum seminis. Thus she had simply taken advantage of her
ecological and phylogenetic knowledge.</p>

<p>To return, however, to our narrative. We waited through the
remainder of the night till day broke, when we were rewarded by the
perception of a faint ray of light creeping straight down through the
entrance gallery into our retreat. We ourselves remained in the dark;
but the pupal chamber was dimly lighted.</p>

<p>In front of us lay the Stigmatomma worker on her back, in a
convulsion of ecstasy. But she soon rose and hurried into the larval
chamber, followed by scores of other ants not one of whom ever
noticed us. Every one carried in her jaws pieces of insects of
various origin; the scent of their booty effectively preventing them
from becoming aware of our myriapod scent. Again and again I saw
among them that worker who had inflicted upon me a wound which only
now began to smart. In the light of Bissa-tee's revelation, her
philoprogenitive zeal is easily understood as a consequence of her
nocturnal adventure. Time after time she took food to the larv&aelig;
who, as I have mentioned, have not yet evolved the more civilized way
of feeding on regurgitation.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon, that day, there was a commotion in the pupal
chamber opposite our niche. A number of pup&aelig; were getting ready
to emerge. Though they formed an irregular pile, all were oriented in
the same way, the anterior pole of each cocoon pointing into the
gallery. Whenever a callow was on the point of emerging, the whole
pile was shaken by seismic movements; and the anterior pole of the
pupa began to describe a circular figure in the air. Next a mandible
was thrust through the cocoon; a transverse slit was gnawed half-way
around its pole. Then the mass came to rest once more; and after an
interval an ant began to struggle out. This is a painful process
taking many hours: first appears one antenna, then the other; the
fore-legs follow; and at last, after many intervals of rest, unless
it has died in the process, the adult crawls out.</p>

<p>No help whatever was given by the adults that were feeding the
larv&aelig;: what a contrast to the elaborate care with which our
callows are trained in obstetrics! The emerging ants, indeed,
stretched out fore-legs and antenn&aelig; in gestures of
supplication; occasionally they even succeeded in palpating thorax or
abdomen of the passing adults. No notice was taken of them. But
whenever one of them died in the struggle to free herself, an adult
returning from the larval chamber at once removed the cocoon from the
pile and carried it away; we saw them later on the refuse pile which
was located a few dozen antlengths east of the outer rim of the
burrow.</p>

<p>Thus this vexed question was settled once for all; no Atta will
henceforth doubt that we must indeed look for the most primitive type
of all ants among the Ponerines; very likely they represent the form,
or at least a form closely resembling that, in which ants were first
created.</p>

<p>It had been my purpose to leave the burrow during the following
night in the same manner in which we had entered it. What Bissa-tee
and Assa-ree had, somewhat to my later indignation, concocted between
them, I did not know at the time. At any rate, our retreat during the
night was cut off by the fact that at least a dozen workers came into
our gallery and lay down, patiently waiting. They did not attack or
molest us; but they barred our exit. I could not imagine what they
wanted. I understand it perfectly now, of course. That individual of
the previous night had been unable to keep her secret to herself. As
Bissa-tee said, we were all ants; and much must be forgiven even to
Attas.</p>

<p>When daylight came next morning, I noticed a mysterious activity
going on between Bissa-tee and Assa-ree. I questioned Bissa-tee; but
all she would tell me was to wait and to follow them when they moved;
she could promise me a rare entertainment.</p>

<p>So I waited patiently, absorbed by my observation of the
pup&aelig;.</p>

<p>It must have been nearly noon when a sudden rush ran through the
formicary. The earth shook with it. All the adults that had been
feeding the larv&aelig; passed us as though shot out; and every one
carried larva, egg, or pupa in her jaws. When the last of them went
by, Assa-ree fell in line behind them; Bissa-tee followed; and I
brought up the rear, entirely at a loss how to interpret the
commotion. At first I had surmised that the burrow was threatened by
an attack from the outside; but surely, all these Stigmatommas would,
in that case, have rushed into our gallery to rescue the remaining
brood.</p>

<p>It was not till we came to the point where our gallery opened into
the great central chamber that I had a hint of the cause of the rout.
These ants have a savage enemy in a small mammal, Mus Insectivorus,
which is provided with a most offensive smell-gland. How Assa-ree had
got hold of it, I do not know and did not care to enquire, but she
held a small fragment of this gland between her jaws; and the
powerful scent drove the whole colony frantic. She must have had it
carefully coated with the adipose tissues of the myriapod which, to
me, was scarcely less offensive than what it concealed; but, of
course, neither held any association of terror for me; no mouse would
dare to expose itself to the bite of my jaws.</p>

<p>What we saw was ludicrous enough. The pugnacious Ponerines rushed
in upon Assa-ree, ready to bite and to sting; but whenever they came
close enough to receive the full force of the scent, a sort of
insanity came over them. They turned tail and attacked their own
sisters with a perfect frenzy of valour. Soon things became
interesting. For those who had had only a slight whiff of the perfume
exerted themselves to prevent others from rushing in; but, getting a
little more of the scent, they threw themselves at Assa-ree. The
moment they did so, their reason was gone, and they attacked their
own kind. Fortunately for the colony as such, there were still a few
of the workers unaffected when the queen emerged from her chamber.
This was the first time I saw her; and I was forcibly struck by the
fact that she was barely differentiated from the workers: there was
nothing about her of the awe-inspiring bulk and the next-to-inability
to move on her own power which characterizes and distinguishes our
own beloved queen Orrha-wee or even my friend Angza-alla-antra. Nor
was she accompanied by any body-guard whatever.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw her seized by one of the ants who had not yet come
near Assa-ree. It was a powerful individual; and I saw her shining
sting flashing in and out of its sheath. She seized the queen by her
mandibles; and in an instinctive reaction to this grasp, which is
very common among the less highly civilized ants, she at once curled
her body up over the thorax of her captress who rushed out of the
exit.</p>

<p>Altogether there were between two and three hundred of these ants;
and of these perhaps fifty escaped, half of them grasping other
workers in exactly the same manner in which the individual previously
mentioned had grasped the queen. The rest fell in this sororicidal
fight. Apart from these corpses that were covering the ground, the
formicary was emptied in less time than it takes to tell about the
battle.</p>

<p>We had now an opportunity of examining the formicary in detail;
but beyond the lay-out already described we found nothing of
interest. There were altogether six chambers.</p>

<p>This brief section on the Ponerines will prevent the curious from
adopting the common error of assuming that the hunting, the pastoral,
and the agricultural ants represent all the stages of development
that have led up to our own kind, the Attas. Below and behind the
steady growth in civilization outlined there still lies the chaos
represented by the Ponerines who live on what they can get and who
show the first beginnings of a movement towards civilization only in
the fact that they do not live singly. No earlier stage of
formicarian evolution is preserved; but there must have been one in
the past when even these beginnings of a social life were unknown,
every individual hunting and feeding for herself, and fighting for
herself when attacked; yes, and succumbing by herself till a few of
them had learned the wisdom of uniting their forces.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I must now reach back in time; for the adventure with these
Ponerines took place after we had left behind the country where we
met the first ants which follow an entirely different mode of
life.</p>

<p>All pastoral ants use for their food sweet plant secretions,
honey, or honey-dew, the latter consisting in the excretions chiefly
of aphids, coccids, and Lyc&aelig;nid larv&aelig;.</p>

<p>While such ants as live chiefly on the direct secretions of plants
cannot strictly be called pastoral, I suspect, and Bissa-tee agreed
with me, that they, as a race, go back to the same phylogenetic type
as the honey ants properly speaking; and, that being so, I shall here
give a brief account of our adventures with Pseudomyrmex Fulvescens
who live on the so-called bull's-horn thorn, Acacia
Sph&aelig;rocephala, which is found throughout that part of the
continent lying north of the Narrows, though not in its forest
regions. When, in the following sections, we go north again, we shall
discuss the geographical distribution of all these tribes in a more
general way.</p>

<p>The bull's-horn thorn is a peculiar structure. The tree does not
grow to any great height; and it prefers a dry and grassy, semi-arid
habitat. The spines or thorns are always united at their bases and
grow in pairs, on trunk and branches alike. When they first appear,
they are soft and filled with a sweetish pulp.</p>

<p>The bi-pinnate leaves of this acacia form an excellent substratum
for the growth of our fungi; and so, wherever a young tree springs
up, the Attiine ants that are numerous in these districts despoil
them; and for the first time in the course of our travels we found
these ants ruthless with regard to the tree; wherever it was
untenanted by the Psendomyrmex, they cut the leaves again and again
till the tree died; on such trees the spines dried up into yellow,
harmless prickles. On more than one occasion we excavated temporary
burrows for ourselves and stocked them with fungus-gardens grown on
shredded acacia-leaf cuttings.</p>

<p>But mostly we found the trees pre-empted by populous colonies of
Pseudomyrmex; and when this happened the first time, an elaborate
burrow having already been prepared and our need of recuperation
being extreme, we resolved to oust these audacious tenants.</p>

<p>The tribe was entirely unknown to us; for neither it nor its host,
Acacia Sph&aelig;rocephala, occurs in the verdant districts of our
own country; and so, finding these ants to be very small, less than
half an Attiine antlength from head to tip of gaster, we never
anticipated any difficulty. I ordered half a dozen of Assa-ree's
soldiers to march in and clear the road. To our amazement it was not
long before these six lay on the ground underneath the tree,
lifeless. Assa-ree, determined not to give way, ordered a detachment
of twenty forward. They were repulsed in the same seemingly
effortless way. Resistance, however, served only to spur Assa-ree on,
and she swore she would put the whole colony to the jaw unless they
surrendered. This sentence she requested Azte-ca, chief officer of
communications to the expedition, to convey to the defenders of the
tree. Azte-ca spent the better part of the day, assisted by a dozen
signallers, in an attempt to make them see reason; all she got for
her pains was a fierce challenge for us to do our worst; they would
defend their stronghold to the last ant. This, to use a vulgar
phrase, got even my epinotum up. But, it being near nightfall, we
temporarily withdrew.</p>

<p>Next morning Assa-ree had five hundred picked fighters ready,
chosen not so much for weight and strength as for agility; not one of
them was above the size required for the largest medi&aelig;. When
Assa-ree gave the scent of attack, they scaled the tree in a closed
phalanx, shoulder to shoulder, jaws forward and opened wide. Within a
few minutes, the ground was covered with their corpses; and in
another few minutes a miserable remainder, less than a score,
cravenly crawled back, defeated. These were in exquisite pain; and
when Bissa-tee who, in addition to her function as chief-zoologist to
the expedition filled the office of chief medical officer, had
examined them, she reported that each of them carried, covering part
of the cranium, the severed head of a Pseudomyrmex, with its jaws
buried in the chitin and, in several cases, reaching through this
armour into the optic ganglia. Bissa-tee at once desired some of her
assistants to attend to them; and in course of time all of them
recovered though several remained blind, and one was deprived of the
use of her left antenna which was pinned back over her head by the
head of the Pseudomyrmex. Assa-ree, in her first fury, jumped up and
down and threatened to court-martial these cravens for having
returned alive. I interposed; and ever after they carried these
Pseudomyrmex heads about like trophies; for Bissa-tee decided it
would be better not to remove them, the operation (which would have
involved the baring of very sensitive nerve-centres) being too
delicate to be performed while we were on the march.</p>

<p>But this last attack had taught us a lesson: our enemies had shown
us how to defeat them. From the unanimous testimony of the survivors,
the Pseudomyrmex cannot use her sting before she has secured a
jaw-hold. The bite of the jaws is sufficient to repel any ordinary
assault, whether it is made by other ants, wasps, or those huge,
browsing cattle which frequent the grassy plains on which this Acacia
thrives. The fact remains that they bite first and then sting; and it
is the sting which is deadly. This gave Assa-ree her clue.</p>

<p>Two days were used to train the columns that were to make the next
attack. A thousand majors were picked and taught to hold between
their mandibles, and covering the cranium, a tough and coherent mass
of vegetable detritus gathered from the turf. Their jaws they held
appressed to their thorax but ready to flash up from below and to
sever the heads of the Pseudomyrmex as soon as their mandibles were
buried in the detritus.</p>

<p>This method proved successful; and when, on the fourth day, the
attack was launched, we cleared the tree of its occupants in less
than half an hour.</p>

<p>This done, our medi&aelig; were set to work cutting leaf-disks;
and Bissa-tee and myself scaled the tree to explore the stronghold of
our late enemies.</p>

<p>The huge bull's-horn thorns were all perforated near the tip, the
holes being just wide enough to admit a Pseudomyrmex. We, of course,
had to have them enlarged. Every thorn--in this tree they were hard
and hollow--contained the nest of a small squad of these ants. In a
few we found pear-shaped but minute bodies of a gold-yellow colour
and a sweet taste. Obviously, they were stored for food. Next we
explored the tree to determine the origin of these bodies and found
that they grow on the very tips of the leaflets.<sup>1</sup> They
made excellent eating. More than that, each leaf carries, on the
midrib or petiole, near its base and on the upper side, a nectary in
the form of a small, oblong crater. These numerous nectaries were at
the time flowing with honey. Such a tree seemed to present these
brave and fiery little ants with a veritable paradise to live in.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> See Belt, Ch. XII. They are called Beltian bodies.

<p> </p>

<p>I felt almost sorry when Anna-zee, our botanist-in-chief who had
meanwhile conducted an independent investigation, made her report at
night and presented to us the reverse side of this picture of bliss.
It was true, she intimated, in her slow and sardonic way (she was no
longer young and afflicted with obesity), nodding her head sideways,
with a trick she had, over her left shoulder, that our view of the
matter held good for the present; but, she added, we were in the
rainy season; and these were all young leaves; unless she was much
mistaken, the golden bodies grew on the tips of the leaflets only
when the leaves first unfolded; and if removed they did not come on
again; that much could even now be inferred from the state of the
tips. And surely, even though all these minute bodies were collected
and stored for use in the dry season, there would never be enough
food to tide so populous a tribe over months and months of aridity.
Furthermore, the extranuptial nectaries being located on the petiole
which would fall with the leaf, this source of food would also vanish
in the dry season when all acacias were known to drop their foliage.
In fact, Anna-zee went on, instead of this being a striking example
of a perfect adaptation on the part of the ant, she could not but
come to the conclusion that, on the contrary, it was a striking
example of a very imperfect or at least incomplete adaptation. As the
dry season came, many, yes, most of the adults were bound to perish
from want; and their survival, as a large, prosperous colony, could
only be tribal. The eggs, indeed, would survive; but the population
of any given year must necessarily be provided by a new generation,
with the exception of a few individuals to take care of the broods.
As for the thorns, excellent as the shelter was which they provided,
they could serve as a source of food only when quite young, for the
sweet pulp which they contained at that time was as little renewed as
the golden bodies at the tips of the leaflets.</p>

<p>This gave us food for thought; and Azte-ca, who was a bit of a
poet, besides being a most ingenious interpreter, remarked upon the
sorry plight of all ant-life on earth, in the face of a hostile
barrenness of nature.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this account of the Pseudomyrmex without mentioning
that our investigation gave Bissa-tee, our impetuous zoologist, the
first idea of a great and fruitful theory which, while it was proved
to be erroneous in the present instance, explained a good many things
later on. Visibly, Bissa-tee hated to accept the cruel inferences
drawn by Anna-zee. She wanted to save these Pseudomyrmex in spite of
themselves. She suggested that they might survive by going into a
summer-sleep, an &aelig;stivation, which, by reducing the expenditure
of energy almost to zero, would enable them to subsist on surplus
tissues built up in the season of plenty. Further observations made
this theory untenable in the present case; but when we came to
districts where, not summer, but winter is the sterile season,
hibernation became a fact of actual observation.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Perhaps there are more ants on this globe that live, at least in
part, symbiotically or in a state of mutualistic co-operation with
certain other beings, such as aphids, coccids, membracids, and
fulgorids, or with the caterpillars of Lyc&aelig;nid butterflies or
blues than in any other way. Some of them, keeping membracids, are
well known in our own country and have been minutely studied in the
past. Excellent monoscents are available to the student.</p>

<p>If, then, I shall consider one or two of them once more, there are
three reasons for doing so. In the first place, this record is to be
a bird's-eye view of the whole of antdom. In the second place,
certain ants keeping cattle have reached a degree of civilization
second only to our own; and since they do not reach that high level
in our own country, they demand particular notice here. In the third
place, it has been rumoured that man also keeps cattle; and from that
fact it has been inferred by certain bold speculators that he must
have reached a social and intellectual stage little below that of
certain ants, though not the most highly developed kinds. It will be
seen how dangerous it is to pursue external analogies into the realm
of ultimate values, and how exceedingly difficult for any
investigator, to rid herself of myrmecomorphic or myrmecocentric
fallacies when dealing with the lower animals.</p>

<p>A brief digression is called for. Northern ants are generally of
the opinion that, the more inexorably climatic difficulties challenge
the ingenuity of ants in their struggle for existence, the greater
will be the development of that ingenuity; and that, therefore, the
highest level of civilization can be reached only by ants whose every
faculty and energy is called into play by the fight for the daily
bread. That this is a fallacy will not be denied by anyone who
reflects that such an intellectual development, as is called forth by
a purely material condition, is also made subservient to a purely
material end. The struggle for existence, while it creates, also
absorbs intellectual and spiritual powers. I have no doubt that, as
the development of these northern races proceeds, they will
ultimately produce sporadic individuals gifted with sufficient genius
to see life whole; these will set before their races certain ideals;
and these ideals will inspire great practical leaders who, at long
last, will precipitate a return of all higher ants to the tropics
whence life has sprung and where it will find its final setting. One
clear proof of the inferiority of the northern races is surely
furnished by the fact that no such expedition as the present was ever
dreamt of by these ants whom we had come to visit; and I can
positively say that, to many, it was a revelation as well as an
inspiration to see us appear out of infinite space.</p>

<p>But to come to the point. Among ants that keep cattle we must
distinguish two or even three groups. There are those that live an
arboreal life, those that live a terrestrial life, and those that
combine the two.</p>

<p>Again a generalization is indicated here. Speaking by-and-large,
of all animals that need the air as a medium to live in, terrestrial
species are the most highly favoured. Arboreal insects, f.i, come in
contact with hardly anything but their tree; flying insects (and ants
have flown in remote antiquity) meet, during a considerable part of
their existence, with nothing but the empty air and know of
terrestrial things hardly anything but what concerns their stomachs.
Whereas on earth, every step taken establishes a contact which
presents a problem; the moment repetition enters into these contacts,
memory arises; and the development of memory is the first step in the
birth of conceptual thought.</p>

<p>Among arboreal ants perhaps none has so far advanced as the genus
Cremastogaster; I shall restrict myself to this single genus.</p>

<p>A word about aphids and coccids. Both these insects, otherwise of
a low order in the phylogenetic scale, are provided with a sharp
proboscis with which they pierce the epidermis of leaves and
chlorophyll-bearing stems to suck the newly-elaborated plant-juices
which contain three chief ingredients in watery solution; cane sugar,
invert sugar, and albumen, all of them almost completely assimilable.
Yet, strange to say, these insects imbibe quantities vastly greater
than they can use; and they eliminate the unused portion through
their anus by squirting it out on the surface of leaf or stem, often
throwing it to a considerable distance: a process which at first
sight looks exceedingly wasteful. To account for it I will advance a
hypothesis which will need further investigation to confirm or refute
it. Perhaps these insects assimilate primarily the albuminoids which
occur in the plant-juices in minute quantities; in order, therefore,
to get enough of these, they must incidentally imbibe relatively
enormous quantities of sugar and water in solution. What seems to
give this explanation a high degree of verisimilitude is the fact
that both aphids and coccids lead an extraordinarily sedentary life
which requires only small quantities of energy-food; but all sugars
are exclusively energy-foods, readily assimilable by insects which by
reason of their active lives require a large proportion of them, such
as ants. In these northern latitudes there are few ants who do not at
least occasionally partake of them. In fact, only the strictly
carnivorous Ponerines and Dorylines (Ecitons) on the one hand and the
highly graminivorous and fungus-growing Myrmicines on the other
despise them altogether.</p>

<p>When the surplus sap is ejected, it dries on the leaf and forms
what is variously called honey-dew, lerp, or manna. Ants that are
more or less omnivorous (like man) partake of this source of
energy-food only in this form by licking it up.</p>

<p>But ants do not stop there. Our investigations showed that they
have learned to extract from this source all it will yield. These
aphids and coccids suffer from distension after imbibing; and this
suffering can be relieved by a very simple process. If the distended
abdomen of these insects is gently stroked, in just the way in which
I have seen man stroke the udder of a cow, the juice is exuded
without explosive action in the form of a beautiful clear drop; and
that is precisely what all those ants living in a close association
with these insects have learned to do; and then they imbibe the food
directly from the anus. Curiously, I have seen a peculiarly
disreputable-looking human lie down under a cow and apply his mouth
to a teat of her udder while he stroked it at the same time: a most
remarkable case of convergent development between ants and
mammals.</p>

<p>Both aphids and coccids are, by the very reason of their sedentary
habits, exposed to the attacks of numerous enemies. Thus there is the
lace-wing larva of Chrysopa, popularly called the aphis-lion, which
is powerful enough to cope on occasion even with an ant. There are
the Coccinellid beetle, the syrphis fly, certain small dragon-flies
and numerous hymenoptera that live a more or less parasitic life.</p>

<p>From the attacks of some of these even ants are not immune; and
that fact would seem to handicap the latter in their defence of these
omnipresent insects. The Cremastogasters whom we investigated
domesticate the aphids and coccids; and to guard them the more
effectively, they build sheds for them in the shelter and protection
of which they can devote all their energies to the extraction of
plant-juices. Cremastogaster Lineolata is particularly versatile in
the exploitation of various materials; if clay is available, she
becomes a mason; if not, she manufactures paper to build her tents
with. Both materials are admirably adapted to the purpose, for they
equalize the temperature--a fact which in these northern latitudes
was particularly important; rain was rare; and the position of these
tents, around the more or less perpendicular stems of plants, with
the tip pointed and the base spreading, took care of what
precipitation there was. I found a coccid tent constructed by a
hairier species, Cremastogaster Pilosa, particularly interesting: it
was built of paper, such as wasps make for their nests, and placed
around a twig of pitch-pine, in a position which protected it at once
from excessive exposure to the summer sun, from rain, and from
wind.</p>

<p>But the most advanced type of pastoral life is found among
terrestrial species, such as Lasius Umbratus. These excavate their
nests about the roots of wormwood and similar plants and go on
regular raids to capture root-aphids which they bring into their
burrows where they soon become tame.</p>

<p>Aphids are wingless in their early stages but develop wings later
on. So I was not at all surprised to witness one day, in company with
Bissa-tee, how certain ants dealated the full-grown insects. At first
sight it might have looked as though this were done to facilitate the
imbibing of the excretions, for the wings projected over the abdomen
and interfered with the process of stroking it. But Bissa-tee called
my attention to the fact that these imaginal aphids were swollen with
eggs: the ants dealate them to prevent them from taking their brood
elsewhere. This led us to investigate further; I am glad to be able
to say that Lasius collects and stores the eggs of aphids in the
fall; and that, as their herds increase in their subterranean
chambers, they are ever enlarging the galleries around the roots, so
as to facilitate the work of the aphids. As for their eggs, they
shift them about and transfer them from chamber to chamber in order
to keep them under optimal conditions of temperature and moisture,
just as they move and tend their own eggs.</p>

<p>We made our observations with the utmost care, mostly remaining
unnoticed by the ants, whether they were arboreal Cremastogasters or
terrestrial Lasius. But occasionally we disturbed these aphidicoles
inadvertently, as, f.i., when, by our massive bodies and our great
weight, we occasioned a land-slide near the entrance of a Lasius
burrow. At once all the aphids within the galleries were seized and,
by way of a side-entrance, carried to a place of safety. This
furnished clear proof that the ants, though holding the aphids as a
sort of communal property, yet consider the interests of their cattle
as much as their own. Sometimes the arboreal tents are erected over
the herds at considerable distances from the habitations of the ants;
the latter protect them against their enemies; and, while some of the
species that tend them are not entirely mellivorous and retain
carnivorous habits, we never saw an ant kill either aphid or coccid
for the purpose of devouring it. Clearly, both classes of insects
enter willingly into this mutual association; the aphids do not
attempt to escape, except when on the point of oviposition; and when
solicited by the ants, they exude the droplets with especial care, so
as not to eject them forcibly. I can positively state that this
association constitutes a true symbiosis.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We shall now, by way of contrast, briefly examine man's relation
to such members of his own subdivision of the animal kingdom, the
mammals, as he has been able to induce to enter with him into a
relationship remotely resembling that of these ants to the
aphids.</p>

<p>We had proceeded so far north that we were occasionally exposed to
considerable hardships from the climate; and towards the end of our
fourth summer abroad, we were made at last aware of the fact that the
differentiation of the two main seasons of the year is
progressive.</p>

<p>Even during the summer in which our observations on Cremastogaster
and Lasius were made, the days had occasionally been so cool as to
interfere with the freedom of our progress. Nevertheless we had,
within the season, covered some 38,000,000 antlengths; and all of
this distance had been travelled in a more or less northerly
direction. Moreover, we were, as our physiological barometers showed,
at an altitude of over 120,000 antlengths above the sea.</p>

<p>In spite of these seemingly unfavourable circumstances, human
habitations had become more and more frequent. As a rule we had
avoided them; we were not anxious to renew such experiences as we had
had with that medical man near the Narrows.</p>

<p>But one evening we had a strange adventure with ants. It had been
raining heavily; and a little brook which we should otherwise easily
have bridged was swollen into a foaming torrent. We were spread out
along its southern bank, trying to find some way of crossing it when
Bissa-tee who was near me suddenly espied a dark, rounded mass
floating down the current. This mass landed, or rather was caught,
not far from where we stood, by the projecting trunk of a fallen
tree; and there it seemed to disintegrate. It consisted of a large
raft of ants held together by their legs which they had hooked into
each other; their young, their eggs, larv&aelig;, and pup&aelig; as
well as their queen they had been carrying in the centre of this
raft; and, loaded with their broods, they were now rapidly filing
landward along the tree-trunk. To our surprise we found them to be a
tribe of Solenopsis Geminata, the fire-ant, which we thought we had
long since left behind. This is a graminivorous ant of medium size
which is very common and much dreaded in the warmer parts of the
country; and it is well known that they like to build their nests
near streams.</p>

<p>When they saw us lined up along the edge of this raging torrent,
they seemed to forget their ferocity and to be overcome with wonder.
I flatter myself that my own venerable appearance was not without its
influence in thus subduing their fiercer instincts. But Bissa-tee
deserves no little credit for offering a helping foot to one or two
workers who were in danger of falling back, under their burdens, into
the water. Fortunately neither Assa-ree nor any of our more unruly
escort were near, or a battle would surely have ensued; and by this
time we could no longer afford to fight any but strictly defensive
battles.</p>

<p>I must admit that it was Bissa-tee's gallant action which
suggested my next step. For at this very moment I saw the aged queen
of the colony struggling out of the disintegrating cluster of the
raft. I rushed to her side and, shouldering her escort away, offered
her my antenna as a support. The whole crowd of Solenopsis cheered by
emitting a most unbearable scent and even by stridulation. For that
I, with my massive body and head which set me apart as at least an
ant of considerable distinction, should extend my antenn&aelig;
instead of a foot, must indeed have seemed almost too much honour. I
had reason to regret this excess of gallantry; for it took Bissa-tee
two weeks of careful nursing to repair the injury inflicted on these
antenn&aelig; by Her Majesty's rough and serrate jaws. However, she,
in turn, did me the honour of discarding her other attendants and of
gaining the shore leaning heavily on my shoulder. Meanwhile, she was
not unconscious of the burden she must have been; for, while
awkwardly dragging herself along, she scented to me this challenge,
"Now confess, lady-errant, that I am the heaviest and roughest queen
in these parts." Since, at that very moment, we reached a flat stone
on the shore, I stepped back, bowed my antenn&aelig; to the very
ground, and replied, "In the world, madam, in the world!" Which ready
repartee completely won us her good will; and so mutually hospitable
relations were established for the night. Her Majesty persisted in
treating me like a male and an old gallant of hers, although she was
at least twice my age; and every utterance was accompanied by that
ironical curve of her waving antenn&aelig; to which she apparently
owed much of her ascendency over her tribe. She was one of those
enormous dowager ladies who, while apparently expecting everyone,
even her servants, to make love to her, at the same time laugh, half
good-naturedly, half contemptuously, both at them and themselves. I
have found such behaviour to be either the result of having received
immense satisfactions from life or of having gone on from
disappointment to disappointment; the latter they are too proud to
show; and the feeling of their own vital superiority is driven inward
to ferment into an acid scorn for all their kind.</p>

<p>Both Her Majesty and myself, immediately after the rescue, gave
orders to prepare the clusters for the night. There were plenty of
old, hollow willows about, to serve as temporary quarters. This
measure was partly indicated by the failing of the light; and partly,
I suppose, it was dictated by a desire on both sides to get rid of
subordinate witnesses to the conference between the High Commands of
both parties.</p>

<p>Within an hour or so we were assembled in a hollow of the ground.
The weather had cleared; and a magnificent half-moon stood high in
the sky. I had been anxious to secure just such a conference with
ants that knew the country and could advise us; and, since our next
great adventure was to be the direct outcome of that night's
revelations, I must give them in some detail.</p>

<p>Naturally, the proceedings were started by Her Majesty who asked
me to give an account of ourselves. She knew, she said, we must have
come from afar and no doubt had much to tell that was worth listening
to. I complied; and, having finished, went on to say that I was
chiefly worried at finding man so common in these parts.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, adding that she could not understand the common
prejudice against man. A number of her counsellors who formed the
body-guard gravely nodded assent; and when I asked her whether she
did not think, no matter what else might be said for or against man,
he was at least highly noxious to ants, she expressed herself amazed
at such a notion. Not at all, she replied; on the contrary, she
considered him outright beneficial.</p>

<p>As for her reasons, I seemed unable to elicit anything that was
conclusive beyond the fact that he harbours vermin; this indeed was
enlarged upon: he being a very wasteful animal, the earth around and
near his dwellings is always littered with vegetable and animal
detritus which gives cover and sustenance to such forms of life as
would otherwise find it hard to subsist; and those are the very ones
which are most palatable to many ants. Even in his crops, she added,
which were almost invariably alien to the climate in which they are
grown and therefore attracted an immense number of insect-parasites,
he provided an inexhaustible supply of food for his betters. She went
so far as to assert that, if nature had not given man to ants, ants
would, at least in these parts, have had to invent or to breed
something much resembling man in order to subsist in safety. But, of
course, having created ants, the crown and supreme achievement of her
work, nature could be trusted to provide for them; and so she had
also created man.</p>

<p>I glanced at Anna-zee who sat in the background, massive and
sardonic; I was half afraid she might give utterance to her thought;
but she considered such teleological vapourings beneath her
notice.</p>

<p>Personally, I was struck by one single thing in all the queen had
said: and that was a brief but pregnant reference to the climate of
"these parts". We had boldly pushed into the unknown increasing our
altitude as well as our latitude; I had not the slightest idea of
what might be ahead of us. This anxiety of mine I thought it now
expedient to express without reserve.</p>

<p>Her answer amazed me. Did we not know? In that case there was only
one of two things for us to do. Either we must turn back at once and
try, by forced marches, to regain a district where existence was
possible for such as ourselves in winter-time; or we must drop our
silly prejudice against man and seek shelter in such buildings as he
erected either for himself or for the animals with which he
associated. For truly, she added, with a side-glance at my enormous
head, even if we could find a friendly tribe in these parts, no ant
excavated burrows with galleries large enough to admit us, nor deep
enough to protect us from the upper cold; not, at least, south of the
Garden of the Gods; and, coming as we did from the tropics, she
presumed we had never adapted ourselves to a winter sleep. This was,
by the way, the first time I heard the so-called Garden of the Gods
mentioned; and before we all retired for the night, I took care to
make the most detailed enquiries with regard to this locality. And
then this old Solenopsis queen launched into a description of winter
in "these parts" which I thought truly eloquent and, in its sombre
way, almost poetic.</p>

<p>The sun, she said, would lose his power because he would never
rise to any great height in the heavens. He would blaze down with a
cruel, cold light on what she called a frozen earth, blindingly
white. Bitter winds would sweep these slopes; water would freeze into
a transparent colourless rock; no rain would fall from the sky; but
instead there would be whirling masses of six-pointed slabs of
shining ice; and the ground would harden to such an extent that none
could burrow and none could hunt. To an ant, she said, the mere touch
of that earth was instant death; for she would stiffen and harden and
remain in that state till she was beyond recovery; or, if milder
weather intervened, it would be so much the worse; for she would
freeze and thaw and thaw and freeze till there was no help for her:
her shining armour would burst, and she would fall a prey to decay in
spring or be picked up by carrion-feeding birds with which the
district abounded.</p>

<p>This was terrible news indeed; and we sat silent when she had
ended. Every statement of hers had been confirmed by a nod on the
part of every one of her council; and on my side Lemma-nee, I could
see, despaired of any hope of salvation.</p>

<p>I, however, on whom it devolved to keep up the morale of the
expedition, promptly asked for further and detailed information about
the dwellings of man; and Her Majesty, signifying that any of her
counsellors could supply the information fully as well as herself,
rose heavily to leave the circle and to withdraw. I and my companions
lowered our antenn&aelig; to the ground as she swept out, supported
by her attendants; and, in the bright moonlight, I saw her eyes
twinkle as she acknowledged our salute.</p>

<p>We now received a most accurate account of the lay-out of a man's
dwelling, together with directions how to reach it. The counsellor
who gave us this account which I recommended to Lemma-nee's special
attention was one of those over-scrupulous and painstaking
individuals who will give no one else credit for a bit of
understanding, considering everyone as being in need of as much
detail as they would require themselves; and so, long before she had
finished, both Bissa-tee and I were sound asleep. In fact, I did not
wake till I felt myself supported and almost carried along to the
cluster formed by the lesser members of the High Command in the
hollow of a huge willow tree.</p>

<p>Next morning, our friends of the night before set out to return to
their abode along the upper reaches of the creek whence the flood had
ousted them. We, having had a good rest, resolved to follow Her
Majesty's advice and, under the command of our geographer-in-chief,
made straight for the farm of man which had been described to us; and
there we intended to go into winter quarters.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>We arrived in the evening of the third day and found the compound
to consist of a large dwelling in which the man, his female, and
three young were housed; and behind this dwelling, a little lower
down the hill, but still above the creek which traversed the meadows,
of an enormous building divided into four parts: first vertically,
for, below, there were the quarters of the animals with which this
man associated, and, above, the huge caves in which he kept his
forage crops; second, horizontally, for cows, horses, and pigs were
kept in separate chambers divided from each other by partitions.</p>

<p>Besides, a large flock of huge birds of the gallinaceous order
roamed freely over all chambers.</p>

<p>We had been recommended to take up our abode in the cow
department; no other part of the barn, we had been told, would be
warm enough. On very cold nights, our advisers had intimated, we
might find it expedient to climb up on these huge mammals and to
crawl into the thick hair on their backs; the clumsy counsellor had
thought it necessary to add that it would be unwise to seek shelter
on their bellies since we should be in danger of being crushed when
they lay down! To our delight we found in this compartment great
store of crushed grain which, though itself unpalatable, yet gave us
a convenient medium in which to hollow out a number of caves; and we
had reason to congratulate ourselves on a timely discovery of
Anna-zee's who, on the third or fourth day, reported to me that, in
the great store of dried grasses above us, she had found certain
clovers which, shredded or triturated and moistened, would serve as a
substratum on which to grow fungi. This news much heartened every
member of the High Command.</p>

<p>So far, the days were still fine, though the nights became rapidly
colder. We soon made the acquaintance of our unwitting host; and he
did not appear to be one of the worst specimens of his kind. Although
to us he seemed of course truly enormous, he was, in his own measure,
no more than medium-sized. What pleased us was the almost formicarian
way of his intercourse with the animals. These were not yet kept in
the stable throughout. They were let out in day-time and housed at
night, at least horses and cows of which there were four of the
former and ten of the latter kind. The pigs still remained altogether
outside. Now this man never mistreated the cows and horses which were
naturally the first to come under our observation; he spoke kindly to
them and patted their rumps, though he invariably shooed the chickens
out of his way; but, then, these were exceedingly savage and stupid
birds.</p>

<p>What, however, at this stage, delighted me most was his relation
to the pigs. A marvellously fine spell of weather intervening, I took
to going out a good deal, often accompanied by Bissa-tee or
Lemma-nee, the only two members of our command with whom I was really
intimate. They, too, seemed to be the only ones affected in the same
way as myself by the often stifling atmosphere of the barn.</p>

<p>The pigs were not kept in one of those unspeakable enclosures to
which they were confined on other farms which we came to visit, but
in a field where they could run and roam at pleasure; and a cleanly,
jolly bunch they were, though, of course, they were only mammals. All
day long they played and gambolled about, hunting grasses and roots;
and we observed that the human young that lived on the place would
come out and play and run with the little ones among them, and even
fondle them in their arms.</p>

<p>Every evening, at a given hour, their master would appear on the
road from the farmyard, carrying on his back a bagful of Indian corn.
The pigs were waiting for him in a corner of the field where the gate
was; there they assembled, expecting him long before he appeared;
when the noise he made in walking or some other sign betrayed his
approach, they would rear on their hind-legs, resting their fore-feet
on the bars of the gate; and at sight of their beloved master they
would squeal and grunt in expectation of their feast. The man would
stop and laugh at their antics; and sometimes he would pat one of
them or playfully hold out an ear of corn and withdraw it again in
jest when one of them snapped at it. This man, I thought, realizes
that he is dealing with life like his own; he knows that even in a
pig there lives happiness and joy, sorrow and pain, trust and anguish
and despondency. They did not fear him; they came and sniffed at his
hands and rubbed their backs against his legs. Was he not their
benign and gracious master who fed them and who had taught them to
rely on him in all their needs?</p>

<p>Only one old sow did I see that never took part in these antics.
She had a wistful look in her yellow, slit-like eyes and stood back,
grunting angrily whenever this pleasant scene was enacted. She knew;
and a little later I, too, was to know.</p>

<p>A few weeks went by; and almost abruptly all that the old
Solenopsis queen had foretold of winter was on us. Though the sun
might shine, it was impossible for us to be outside even in the
middle of the day; and for a while it seemed as though we had
undertaken more than we could do. All the animals kept on the place
remained in the barn now; and our lives, too, were strictly confined.
Strange to say, the master seemed to protect us; but it was a long
while before I found out the reason for that. Bissa-tee and myself,
however, soon resumed our rambles even though they had to be confined
to the inside of our refuge.</p>

<p>Thus, before long, we found the pigs again; they were now kept in
a shed at the back of the barn where there was a large enclosure
connecting by a low door with a smaller stall and by swing-traps with
a second enclosure outside, so that, at all times, they could either
crowd together in the stall or enjoy a somewhat greater freedom in
the pen or in the open. They did not look so clean any longer; nor
were they quite so high-spirited as they had been in the field. But
they were well fed and had shelter against the death-on-earth that
had swept the country. We often went to look at them, climbing up on
a partition that separated pen and stall from a gallery on which they
bordered.</p>

<p>Now one frosty morning when we had gone there, the man entered
briskly, carrying on his shoulder a weapon made of a heavy steel
blade into which a long wooden handle was fixed. This he leaned
against the outside of the pen, then he climbed in; and as he did so,
I caught a glimpse of that wise old sow which had never betrayed any
joy at sight of her master in the field. With a grunt she pushed
through the swing-trap into the open. But all the other pigs pressed
eagerly forward as if they expected a treat.</p>

<p>He, however, chased all of them out but one; that one he held
firmly gripped by an ear and the tail. When all the rest had followed
the sow, he pulled the remaining one into the stall and, with his
hind-foot, closed its door.</p>

<p>Then he fetched the axe which was clearly unknown to the pig, for,
as he returned with it, the poor brute betrayed nothing but an
expectant curiosity. He raised the weapon aloft, heel forward; and
for a moment he held it thus poised, in estimation of the distance.
Then he brought it down with a tremendous, relentless swing, straight
on to the centre of the pig's head. The pig did not fall but stood
stunned; blood rushed into its eyes; it was completely taken by
surprise. An immense, bottomless abhorrence was mingled with the
agony of pain; it tried to take a step; but it reeled; and then it
seemed to awake to his purpose and tried to escape. But the man had
coolly raised his axe again and stood motionless, waiting his chance;
and at last, when the pig, in a frenzy of fear, finding the door
closed, rushed past him once more, he brought the powerful weapon
down on that head a second time. The pig collapsed; its legs went
rigid, though still atremble. Life was not yet extinct; but the man
plunged a sharp instrument resembling the sickle of an Eciton but
much larger into its neck, so that the blood rushed out like a
fountain. Life ebbed; the joints relaxed; the brute lay limp.</p>

<p>We, Bissa-tee and myself, fled in horror; and it was weeks before
we cared to see any more of man's doings. Surely, man, as an animal
endowed with reason, if reason it can be called, is a mere upstart. I
would rather call him endowed with a low sort of cunning. His
self-styled civilization is a mere film stretched over a horrible
ground-mass of savagery. Man is no farther advanced in his own
development than Ecitons or Ponerines are in theirs.</p>

<p>Soon after the adventure just related we had a revelation of the
means by which Assa-ree kept her army alive in that barn.
Incidentally, this revelation explained the conciliatory attitude of
the man to ourselves.</p>

<p>I must explain that this man had mysterious means of lighting his
barn at night. At regular intervals huge, white, bulb-like fire-flies
were fixed to the ceiling. These he could induce at will to emit an
almost blinding radiance. It is well known, of course, that our own
fire-flies respond to any superficial irritation. No doubt he uses
some such means; at any rate, he always touched a certain button in
one of the walls when he wanted to bring on the light and when he
wanted to extinguish it. Now one night he forgot to touch that button
when he left after having milked his cows.</p>

<p>We had long gone to rest when a great noise wakened me. I got up
and groped my way into the next chamber excavated in the crushed
grain which was tenanted by Bissa-tee, Lemma-nee, and Azte-ca. I
gently touched the former two; and they joined me at once. I bade
them listen; and when they heard the commotion, they followed me in
silence. Cautiously we made our way to the partition dividing our bin
from the great central aisle of the barn.</p>

<p>We saw an amazing sight. Assa-ree was marshalling her hordes into
a great compact body; and never had they looked quite so unmistakably
like an army of Ecitons. What puzzled me most was how she gained her
ascendency over these alien ants and what induced them to follow her
and to obey her commands. It was all to become clear later on.</p>

<p>At a given signal the whole horde started in the greatest hurry
and excitement to climb up the stanchions and partitions and even the
rough wall that protected the building against the outside.
Everywhere they peered into cracks and crannies, seizing hibernating
spiders and cockroaches, pulling flies out of their hiding-places,
and sending grasshoppers and crickets, still half torpid, flying into
the central aisle where they were torn to pieces.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of these columns started a rat. I must say that these
rats were not kept here as part of man's establishment; they were
intruders and hated as much by man as by ourselves. This rat was
skilfully driven into the thick of the army on the main floor; and
apparently it was utterly bewildered and frightened out of its
wits.</p>

<p>Had it rushed straight through the crowd, it could have escaped;
but instead it came to a stop and tried to turn back. This moment of
hesitation proved fatal; for at once several hundred of its
tormentors swarmed over it; and though it still struggled, it fell,
pouring forth its blood which was eagerly lapped up.</p>

<p>We looked on for another half hour or so; and then the murderous
crowd turned away to seek the burrow next to our own. Of the rat,
nothing was left but a skeleton picked clean of every vestige of
flesh.</p>

<p>I often witnessed such raids after this; for the barn swarmed with
rats and mice; and I did not feel that I could interfere. But I was
much worried at the thought that this was the army on which we relied
for protection. Here we were, the very flower of our intelligentsia,
bound on a mission of peace; and for our escort we had, through
Assa-ree's treason, a gang of thugs and cutthroats, ready no doubt,
on the first provocation, to turn against ourselves!</p>

<p>Besides, the very usefulness of our army to our host led to one of
the worst disasters that could befall us. For this man began to take
an interest in us. Without ever interfering, he watched what we were
doing. He knew by this time where we had nested and was careful not
to disturb our burrows. His very interest, however, harboured our
danger.</p>

<p>The explanation of what follows was at the time no more than a
bold conjecture; but it has been since confirmed. I shall relate it
as though we had known all the time what it meant. There are human
scientists who make us ants the special object of their studies. They
do not know as much about us as we know about them; but they betray a
blundering sort of interest in us. No doubt our host knew such a one
and had told him about us; for one day, soon after the winter
solstice, he appeared in the barn with a stranger who at once began
to observe such of our numbers as happened to be abroad. He was armed
with all sorts of weapons, <i>forceps,</i> transparent cylinders,
bags, boxes, and <i>trowels.</i> What some of these were for I knew;
and I gave the signal for retreat to the burrow.</p>

<p>He, accompanied by our host, followed us and closely examined the
entrances to the two burrows. I, hidden in the crater of ours,
availed myself of a moment of inattention to gain a post on the
wooden partition between bin and aisle. To my horror I saw thence how
this stranger--who, by the way, had two pairs of eyes like the
assistant at the Narrows--suddenly wielded his trowel and dug into
the burrow which harboured our army. Our host, meanwhile, was holding
a small bag of tough tissue open; and the stranger, with a deft
movement, scooped up a fine lot of Ecitons and dumped them into that
bag. Having done this, the two men retired.</p>

<p>In the burrow, there was the utmost confusion. Assa-ree stalked
about, surveying the damage done. It was the only time on our way out
that I ever saw her excited. She behaved exactly like one of those
beheaded Ecitons at the Narrows; she had figuratively, as they
literally, lost her head. But this was of short duration; in a few
seconds she regained her nonchalant composure and gave the necessary
orders to have the burrow repaired. Undoubtedly she knew that her
safety as well as ours depended on maintaining order among her unruly
hordes.</p>

<p>I gave them time to effect these repairs; and then I ordered a
general review of the troops. Assa-ree obeyed sullenly; but she
obeyed; and the count revealed that the numbers of the army were now
reduced to about half of what they had been four years ago. I cannot
say that I was entirely displeased, especially since this last loss
had fallen exclusively on the soldiers.</p>

<p>A few more moons went by; the winter came to an end; our host
turned his animals out into the meadows; and we began to think of
moving on; for I had received scent, through our friends the
Solenopsis, of a most remarkable tribe of pastoral ants on the
highlands just west of a first range of the stupendous mountain
system that we had now to our left; and I wished to have unlimited
time for their study. After that, I half intended to turn back, for
at this time I felt much discouraged by the climatic difficulties
opposing themselves to our enterprise. I little knew that most of our
sufferings lay still ahead.</p>

<p>My discouragement was much deepened by the final adventure at this
human farm. So far, we had carefully avoided any encounter with those
ferocious birds that were kept on the place; and when we at last made
our final exit through wide doors which now remained open all day, we
had carefully ascertained through scouts that none of them was about.
They were all, we were told, scratching in the newly stirred
garden-lot south of the dwelling.</p>

<p>I allowed our army to precede us; and the whole body had filed out
in safety before I and my 120-odd assistants followed. Now we had
just gained the wide entrance chamber of the barn which was floored
with a single slab of smooth rock when, from a wooden pocket fastened
to the wall, one of these birds flew down, landing right in our
midst. No sooner had it alighted than it began to pick up, with its
hard, horny beak, some of the most eminent of our scholars. Their
surprise was so great that they did not even try to defend themselves
but allowed that ill-omened bird to swallow them alive. Thus perished
a score of my most indispensable assistants: all but one of our
physiological barometers, f.i.; and a not inconsiderable number of
our surveyors and experts in communication. But I could have done
without them if worse had not been in store.</p>

<p>For Lemma-nee, my intimate friend, geographer-in-chief to the
expedition, seeing some of the most important members of her staff
attacked, in a generous impulse went to their assistance. Bissa-tee
and myself did our utmost to restrain her; but she shook us off and
rushed to the scene of carnage.</p>

<p>At once the bird pecked at her; but she buried her pincer-like
jaws in its tongue, nearly severing its tip. The bird threw her high
up in the air and again pecked at her as she fell to the ground. But
once more Lemma-nee was ready. This time she succeeded in stinging
the tongue and in injecting a plentiful dose of formic acid. The
effect was such that the bird promptly dropped her; and, the tongue
swelling prodigiously, it found itself unable to close its beak. It
emitted a gurgling sound and stood as though dazed with pain.
Lemma-nee, grievously hurt and bleeding from a score of wounds, was
just on the point of picking herself up again, when the bird, too,
rallied and, though incapacitated to the extent of being unable to
use its beak, yet in insensate fury rushed forward and jumped on
Lemma-nee with its hard, armoured claws and began to scratch. In less
than a second my dear friend and one of the greatest scholars living
was reduced to pulp.</p>

<p>What, compared to such a loss, was the death or the capture of a
thousand soldiers! I should willingly have parted with the whole army
if I could have recalled her to life. It seemed a mere irony of fate
that, by her sacrifice, she should have covered the safe retreat of
the rest of the High Command, though our number was reduced to
109.</p>

<p>Such was our lamentable exit from this farm of man.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>VI</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was late in the spring when those of us who remained reached
the highlands of the Garden of the Gods. This was the fifth summer of
our wanderings; and we had now covered a total distance of
400,000,000 common antlengths, Attiine measure.</p>

<p>By a detour we had just avoided passing through a human city where
there were remarkable mineral hot-springs which I could have wished
to visit, for I was beginning to suffer from rheumatic troubles. We
had had to cross a number of rapid and turbulent streams, using
various devices for the purpose; sometimes fallen trees had served as
bridges; sometimes Assa-ree's soldiers had been ordered into the
water to span it; and on one occasion when the latter method failed
because there were no longer sufficient numbers left to make a living
bridge reaching to the far bank, we had made use of the lesson
learned from the Solenopsis and, picking a spot where the current had
a diagonal set, we had floated over in a cluster. Every one of these
crossings had cost us a few lives; but on the whole our losses had
been insignificant.</p>

<p>Thus we had arrived on a wide, elevated table-land surrounded by
mountains. Ahead of us stood two masses of bright-red rock towering
up to a height of over seven thousand antlengths and forming
something like a gate.</p>

<p>This was the landmark which the Solenopsis queen had given me.</p>

<p>We halted, and I gave orders for the army to go into quarters
here; for I anticipated an interesting and important investigation;
and I was not going to endanger it by having these hordes about,
which were becoming panicky and unruly. Naturally, Assa-ree had to
remain with them; and to my surprise she submitted without a
murmur.</p>

<p>The rest of us, 109, proceeded on our road and soon passed through
that gateway of red rock.</p>

<p>Beyond, we entered a rough plain strewn with the strangest masses
of red and white sandstone and crossed by fantastic mountainous
ridges. Vegetation was scarce on this plain; the rare trees consisted
of shin-oaks and a few pines. Over large stretches the ground seemed,
at first sight, to consist of wind-blown waves of rock, their backs
sloping up gradually, their fronts as abrupt as the face of a comber
in the sea when it is on the point of breaking. This illusion of a
wind-blown arm of the sea having suddenly been petrified is enhanced
by sharp, narrow points of rock projecting over the crests of these
waves, as though their spray had also been congealed.</p>

<p>A closer examination, however, revealed that not all of this
expanse was solid rock. Especially below the breaking crest of the
waves the process of weathering has provided a talus. This soil, if I
may call it that, is held together by the long, tough roots of
xerophytic plants, besides being itself singularly tenacious.
Anna-zee, our botanist-in-chief, pointed out to me how singularly
well-adapted this hard soil was for the construction of the most
elaborate burrows.</p>

<p>We spent a number of days exploring the plain, and we had abundant
proof that the soil-faces of the rock-waves were used by ants.
Everywhere they were pierced, near the crest, by wide craters
excavated in the central depression of a flat, cone-shaped mound
formed of pebbles. These entrances were fully an antlength in
diameter, many of them larger; and they seemed to lead into sloping
galleries pointing right under those rocky masses. But never an ant
did we see.</p>

<p>We were at an elevation of over 144,000 antlengths; and from that
it will be clear that the nights were excessively chilly. The climate
is arid; radiation, therefore, is swift at night; and shortly after
sunset the temperature used to fall to a point where it was dangerous
for any of us to be abroad. Fortunately, we found that, in the deeper
crevices, the rock retained enough of the heat of the day to make it
possible for us to spend the nights there without burrowing. If at
all possible I wished to avoid the latter means of providing shelter,
for I had learned so much of the high state of civilization, the
learning, and the urbanity of the ants that inhabit these districts
that I desired nothing so much as to establish peaceful and friendly
relations with them. If we burrowed, I feared we might inadvertently
break into and disturb their galleries, thereby prejudicing them in
our disfavour.</p>

<p>One night, however, hearing a slight noise, Bissa-tee, now the
only one of my friends with whom I was intimate, ascended the naked
rock at the back of a wave and was promptly numbed. When, within
several hours, she did not return, I tried to follow her but found it
impossible to do so, on account of the piercing cold. She was found
next morning, frozen stiff; and when, having been brought in, she
thawed, she was for a long while unable to move or to answer my
solicitous enquiries; but ultimately she recovered though she
remained for ever after subject to excruciating headaches.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee reported that, soon after she had been reduced to a
semi-comatose state, but before she had lost consciousness
altogether, she had been visited by a number of ants of no great
size; but beyond that she could give no details. From which we drew
the conclusion that our unknown friends were strictly nocturnal.</p>

<p>In this conclusion we were confirmed a few nights later when a
stray ant from one of the formicaries unexpectedly entered our
conclave, for it so happened that we were in conference. Azte-ca was
nearest to her at the moment. Much amazed to scent us so
unexpectedly, she stopped short in her hurried walk. Azte-ca is in
her way a genius; we shall hear more of her singular gifts by and by.
But she is frivolous and given to sometimes indecorous joking; though
this time this propensity of hers served us well enough.</p>

<p>I am sure she was as much surprised as the rest of us; but she
recovered herself instantly, bowed, and signalled in a most
ceremonious way, "This is a conspiracy; and the only way of avoiding
danger is to join it." I saw the antenn&aelig; of the stranger
jerking and knew at once that our difficulty was solved. Make an
enemy laugh and prepare for peace negotiations, says the proverb.
Azte-ca had used ambiguous scents, such as an ant is apt to use when
she is not sure of being understood. Incidentally she had danced her
shoulders as if in clownish merriment. The stranger saw through her
artifice and was pleased. She answered promptly, "I shall; but only
with Her Majesty's permission." We all knew, of course, that she
meant the queen of her colony; but she managed to impart to this
sentence an air of ambiguity by fixing her exceedingly minute ocelli
on myself, giving me at the same time the salute royal. I bowed and
signified that we desired nothing better. She withdrew, and we waited
patiently.</p>

<p>In a short time she returned, accompanied by half a dozen majors
who conveyed an invitation from Her Majesty Allas-ta, queen of the
Myrmecocysts, for our leaders to follow them into the presence. When
I referred to the cold, they assured us that we should be well taken
care of and guided through the warmest crevices of the rocks.</p>

<p>We fell in line behind them, five of us: myself, Anna-zee,
Bissa-tee, Azte-ca, and Adver-tee; and in a few minutes we entered
the crater of their city. Here we had to delay in order to recover a
proper sense of time; for, unaccustomed as we were to the climate,
our own physiological processes had been retarded by the chill to
such an extent as to make all external events seem to be
extraordinarily accelerated. Whatever happened, to us it came as a
surprise. So we preferred to re-establish the normal functioning of
our perceptions before we went out. Then we were taken down through a
wide but short, steeply sloping gallery which, at a distance of
perhaps ten antlengths from the entrance broke up into a series of
galleries only slightly smaller than the outer one; these, too,
sloped steeply and opened into vaulted chambers four antlengths wide,
from five to six long, and two high. Overhead they were hung with
strange spherical bodies. The floors were marvellously smooth. It was
quite warm here; and the air was dry and sweetly scented.</p>

<p>Beyond, we again entered a sloping gallery which again opened into
a vaulted chamber. Thus we went on from gallery to chamber and from
chamber to gallery till I estimated that we were fully eighty
antlengths below the surface and more than twice as far from the
entrance.</p>

<p>And suddenly we saw a dazzling sight. In a large chamber at the
end of the gallery which we were threading, surrounded by a strong
bodyguard, we beheld Her Majesty by the light of phosphorescent
masses of vegetable detritus. She was very young, pale yellow
throughout, and of marvellous beauty, looking almost virgin in her
pride of place. I surmised that this was the first time it was her
duty to receive ambassadors from foreign lands; but she acted her
part to perfection. She was all trembling eagerness, restrained only
by the knowledge that she represented her nation. I could fairly see
how near she was to giving way to her palpitating vitality.</p>

<p>Even as it was, she came to meet us at the entrance to the
audience-chamber and deftly prevented me from giving her the salute
royal by taking my fore-foot, with a gesture at once intimate and
betraying her consciousness of the fact that she was bestowing the
highest honour in her gift. My four companions she allowed to grasp
the earth with their fore-feet and to lift their hind-feet and
abdomens into the perpendicular, as they had seen the first
Myrmecocyst do to me. They were fortunate indeed in having been able
to observe her; for how else could they have known what was indicated
under the circumstances?</p>

<p>We entered the audience-chamber; and, Her Majesty seating herself
at its upper end, we were motioned to form a half-circle about her,
with myself in the centre. A decent interval was allowed to elapse
before Her Majesty signified her pleasure. I had already noticed that
her subjects conferred with each other exclusively by touches of
their antenn&aelig; which largely accounted for the singular purity
of the air in these chambers. Scents might have polluted it. All the
more did I appreciate it when Her Majesty <i>scented</i> her request
for information as to who we were and whence we came.</p>

<p>"Unscentable, O queen," I replied at once, using the gentlest and
sweetest scents for my answer, "is the sorrow which you command me to
renew"; and then, having to that extent acknowledged her courtesy in
making use of this method of communication, I abandoned it and
proceeded by readily interpretable touches on Bissa-tee's body.
Before I was going to tell her who we were and how we had come, I
begged to be excused for making so bold as to ask a favour. Her
Majesty, already impressed by the adroitness with which I had
switched back to touch-language, graciously bade me name it.
Whereupon I, not ordinarily given to an empty exchange of civilities,
indicated to her my desire to be permitted to face Bissa-tee rather
than herself, adding that I should not feel at ease if I had to face
her beauty and dazzling splendour while searching for the motions
appropriate to convey my meaning. I saw at once that I had not
miscalculated in this appeal to ant nature. All perfect females are
alike: vanity lurks under their skin. Her antenn&aelig; trembled with
pleasure as she looked upon my simulated confusion. I even saw her
cast a swift glance at one of her counsellors, a particularly
duenna-like individual of enormous girth, as she gave the permission
I asked for. In half turning towards Bissa-tee, however, I was
careful to stop short at a point which still permitted me to give Her
Majesty now and then a furtive glance of admiration.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to repeat what I signified; it would involve a
repetition of the contents of the preceding scent-trees. If I do say
it myself, it was a masterpiece of emotion;<sup>2</sup> and more than
once I carried Her Majesty, figuratively speaking, off her feet.
Suffice it to say that it was morning before I finished; and that was
the usual hour for Her Majesty to retire.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> A word, formed by analogy to elocution? E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Before she did so, she was pleased to order that ample provision
be made for my own accommodation as well as for that of all my
companions; and I, in turn, charged Adver-tee with the commission of
transferring our whole High Command into our new quarters as soon as
the temperature of the plain permitted.</p>

<p>I will merely state that we remained with these new friends of
ours for more than a moon and then proceed to an account of their
remarkable commonwealth, abandoning all attempt at giving our
discoveries and investigations in their chronological order. My
information derives from one of Her Majesty's counsellors, a very
great dignitary of the realm indeed.</p>

<p>First of all I was informed that the city in which we were was one
of the largest of its kind in the district. The old queen had died
quite recently; and sixteen years ago, she had, in turn, succeeded
her own mother at a time when the colony had already been a
prosperous and populous one. Her present Majesty had only very
recently been adopted. Thus I estimated the age of this colony at
roughly forty years, which undoubtedly accounted for its wealth and
its quiet functioning.</p>

<p>Considering the small size of the ants (the largest workers were
exactly one antlength from head to tip of abdomen; the smallest less
than half as long), the extent of the excavations was truly
surprising. There were at least a score of chambers; and those hung
with the mysterious spherical bodies were magnificent structures,
with floors of great smoothness and roughened vaults above; and of
these there were six. The whole burrow was excavated in very hard and
dry soil; and, as I have already intimated, the connecting galleries
were of exceptionally large diameter and perfectly tubular. Most of
the chambers were placed below the rock, which insured their complete
freedom from moisture. In fact the chief engineering problem these
ants set themselves seemed to be that of securing dryness and
ventilation. As for the proper regulation of temperature, it was
taken care of by the depth of the burrow.</p>

<p>These ants live exclusively on honey. The shin-oaks of the plain
are abundantly covered with peculiar galls the size of a large pea;
and at a given time of the year, which happened to be the very time
when we were there, these galls exude each from ten to twenty
droplets of honey which is carefully collected by these ants. In
addition, there are numberless herds of coccids and aphids stationed
on these oaks as well as pines. The Myrmecocysts do not enclose them
in tents; but by treaty each nation secures the exclusive right of
tending those that inhabit given trees and plants.</p>

<p>Now this supply is seasonal: it is excessively abundant in early
spring, but soon dwindles as the summer advances and the dry time of
the year begins; in winter it gives out altogether.</p>

<p>This is the point where the mystery of the spherical bodies came
in for solution; these spherical bodies are the abdomens of the
so-called repletes; and the whole economy of the state revolves
around them.</p>

<p>Certain workers are, from early youth, trained to imbibe an
over-supply of the honeyed liquids. All of them are volunteers;
though certain physiological adaptations must be present if a callow
is to be eligible; of that, more in a moment. The peculiar difficulty
of the problem will be grasped more readily if I first describe an
adult replete.</p>

<p>At first sight she looks simply like a spherical ball three
quarters of an antlength or more in diameter. On looking more
closely, I found that to one pole of this ball there is appended a
perfectly normal thorax and head three eighths of an antlength long,
provided with all the ordinary appendages of the adult, legs,
antenn&aelig;, etc. The sphere, in other words, is the distended
abdomen of a living adult. This distension is truly enormous: the
ordinary armour-plates which, in a normal ant, cover the segments of
the abdomen, joined by an articulate membrane, are spaced over the
surface of this sphere at intervals of more than an eighth of an
antlength, nowhere touching each other, and looking like little
isolated hairy ridges that do not reach anywhere around the sphere
even in a direction at right angles to its axis. The articulate
membranes are stretched to the bursting point and to a degree of
thinness which makes them transparent. All abdominal organs except
the ingluvies or pro-stomach are pressed flat against the outer skin,
so that these repletes are unable to feed in the usual way. It is
that ingluvies which is filled with the sweet liquid.</p>

<p>The repletes never leave the burrow: they are filled by the
ordinary workers who bring in the honey, themselves slightly
distended after each forage trip. These regurgitate, and the slack
repletes imbibe the honey from their mouths; it takes many scores of
such feedings before a replete is filled. When that stage is reached,
three or four of the maxims who do not themselves go out to forage
hoist her up so that she can take hold with her fore-feet of the
roughened roof of her cave. There, she can move about with a freedom
which, in so bulky a body, is truly amazing. In case of emergency,
during an invasion, let me say, she can even drag herself about on
the ground with considerable agility; but she is unable to lift
herself back to the roof. I had thought that perhaps the surprising
width and height of the galleries is meant to facilitate their exit
should flight become necessary; but Bissa-tee assigned another reason
for this apparently wasteful way of building: she pointed out that
the honey, when collected by the workers, is sterile and remained so
till imbibed by the repletes. Only when stored in their abdomens,
through which it exudes to a degree that keeps the outer skin of the
sphere moist, is it liable to foster the growth of moulds on the
bodies of the repletes. It was, therefore, she argued, of the utmost
importance to keep the air in these caves dry and in motion; and my
guide, when questioned, while perhaps from mere courtesy admitting
the justice of my own conjecture, confirmed that of Bissa-tee as
being the chief object they had in view.</p>

<p>Of these repletes I counted no less than sixty in a single
chamber, all hanging motionless side by side; and in the total there
must have been nearly four hundred in the various chambers though, of
course, not all of them were filled at the time. Those that were not
presented a truly hideous spectacle, their abdomens hanging slack and
imparting to them an air of weird old age and ugly decay.</p>

<p>An enquiry from my guide brought the information that even from
their ingluvies these authors<sup>3</sup> can absorb, directly into
the blood, sufficient nutriment to keep them alive. They feed others;
but they do not eat themselves except when they are slack. When the
dry season comes and foraging stops, one or two of these authors are
taken down from the roof by the maxims and stationed in the chamber
of the queen where, till they are emptied, they form part of her
body-guard. Every one of the authors covets this honour. Her Majesty
imbibes from their mouths what she needs.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, one
or two are taken down daily for the workers who, however, are
strictly rationed.</p>

<p><sup> </sup></p>

<p><sup>3</sup> I hesitate about leaving this word; but there is no
doubt about it. From this point on the manuscript ceases to call them
repletes and substitutes the above word; it occurs a score of times.
E.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Considering the name of "authors", I am surprised
that Wawa-quee does not call these privileged repletes "Poets
Laureate". E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>All these authors, with very few exceptions, were of uniform size;
they were majors or maxims. But there were a few medi&aelig; and even
minims. When I remarked upon this to my guide, she explained with a
humorous trembling of her antenn&aelig; that these were prodigies who
had "had the call".</p>

<p>Since this expression puzzled me, she deigned to give me a few
details. When, among the maxim callows, enquiry was made in order to
find volunteers to replace those authors that had succumbed to old
age or other infirmities, the first thing that was done with those
coming forward was to subject them to a very rigorous medical
examination. There were always some who showed abnormal developments
of their alimentary tract: a flattening of the true stomach or a
shortening of their intestines. Only such were admitted to training.
It was a strange fact, our guide went on, that nearly every volunteer
who seemed really anxious to become an author showed some such
abnormality. The two things seemed to go together: the spiritual call
and the physiological, or, perhaps, more correctly, the pathological
structure. Should an ant, as rarely happened, profess to have the
call (which, our guide explained a little cynically, really means the
devouring ambition) to become an author without being physically
abnormal, she was never admitted to the course of training; and in
that case the call had, as a rule, a knack of disappearing. Now
authors were held in great esteem in the commonwealth; that is to
say, they were ostentatiously honoured and secretly despised as
unnecessary and unproductive members of society; yet it was the
custom of inscribing their names on a roll of honour and thus
conferring upon them a sort of immortality, after death; and
sometimes it happened that a media or a minim whose ordinary function
in life it would have been to climb about among the authors and to
keep them clean and sanitary, picking off specks of dust and spores
of fungi and moulds which might alight on their moist abdominal
spheres--it sometimes happened that such so-called critics professed
to have had the call and at the same time showed such physical
irregularities as would have entitled a major or a maxim to the full
course of training. In that case she was, without any such training,
admitted to the rank of an author; but her name was never inscribed
on the roll of honour; it was allowed to die with her.</p>

<p>All this filled me with a sense of wonder; and I expressed the
wish to be further informed about the details of this course of
training. My guide very kindly condescended to enlighten me.</p>

<p>All those who wished to become authors were first of all required
to fast for a full year, or for a quarter of their lives, many of
them dying during this period of their training. Next they were, for
a period of from two to three moons, exposed to all sorts of
practical jokes, expressions of contempt, and an utter isolation:
only critics or minims having access to them. The purpose of this,
our guide said, was to sweeten their tempers; for no ant that did not
have a sweet temper could possibly be successful as an author; every
violent impulse, every bitter thought would spoil the contents of
their ingluvies for public consumption; and that in spite of the fact
that they were at all times exposed to peculiar provocations; for the
honour given them freely when they were dead was withheld from them
during life; and they had to be at the beck and call of even the
humblest of their fellow ants who, no matter how excellent the honey
they furnished might be, thought themselves entitled to nag at the
food they received; and that in the exactly inverse ratio of their
qualifications as judges. Only when they had stood this test were
they admitted to a final course of scentures. Our guide told us that
more than once it had been her privilege to deliver these scentures
to such as aspired to the career of authors; in fact, she said, that
was the very reason why Her Majesty had detailed her for this service
as our guide. In these scentures it had been her duty, for a period
of a moon, to tell these callows (for the training was administered
at a low age) daily what was ahead of them: that for month after
month, and for year after year they would have to remain suspended
above the common herd, unable to take part in their pleasures and
diversions except as lookers-on; debarred from all friendly and
intimate intercourse, forbidden even to converse with their
fellow-authors among whom there might be one infected with bitterness
and apt to impart this disability to her neighbours; for their
task--to keep the common inheritance sweet and fresh, and to protect
it from any contamination--demanded the most absolute concentration
of every mental and physical faculty on the state of their abdomen;
they must cease to exist as individuals and live exclusively for the
common weal.</p>

<p>All which amazed us much; and we looked with a new interest on
these authors that were hanging from the roof of their circumscribed
world.</p>

<p>A last question remained: did many of those who volunteered for
this exacting service drop out, deterred by the rigours of the course
of training? Quite a few, our guide replied, quite a few; those who
do are commonly honoured among the ants of their time; for they
plainly value what the others value, namely, the pleasures of the
belly, above immortal fame. As a rule they went on storing honey in
small quantities, but in a dilute though highly palatable form which
was neither highly nutritious nor capable of being preserved for any
length of time; and since their honey, unless replenished, is soon
exhausted, they are not required to remain suspended above the crowd
with which, on the contrary, they mingle freely in all their
diversions. Many, however, adhere to their purpose, lured by that
fame conferred upon them after death by the inscention of their names
upon the roll of honour.</p>

<p>I do not know of anything that we met with in the whole course of
our travels which deserved greater admiration than the selfless
devotion of these authors who persist in devoting their lives to an
unattainable ideal, in the face of going without the common pleasures
of life.</p>

<p>By the time we had received all this information and thoroughly
investigated the whole economy of this tribe, the dry season had
begun; and I judged it expedient to set out again, this time towards
the east where, I had no doubt, new and amazing adventures were
waiting for us. Her Majesty honoured me by giving me a night-long
parting audience; and still further by dismissing all her train from
her presence.</p>

<p>I knew that something like a declaration was expected from me; and
so I had provided myself with a number of love-poems, both of scent
and motion: all these were composed by Adver-tee, with material
furnished her by Azte-ca. Her Majesty graciously intimated that she
grasped my meaning; but, as I could readily understand, that she did
not and could not share my feelings. I assured her that, indeed, I
did understand; and that, for the rest of my life, I should be the
happier for having known her. She took it all at its face value and
felt tremendously flattered.</p>

<p>The morning after this audience, we took our leave.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>And now began that disastrous march to the east on which we
started 4,243 strong and the end of which saw only three of us
surviving.</p>

<p>Right at the start we were faced with terrible difficulties: it
proved much harder to descend the mountains than it had been to
ascend them. Not a day went by without casualties; and as soon as we
reached the more level country to the east, it is hardly too much to
say that for weeks and months we fought one single battle till we
reached the Atlantic seaboard. Sometimes we fought both in the van
and the rear while struggling forward at the top of our speed;
sometimes we went into trenches and defended ourselves as best we
could; for the smaller ants that inhabit these northern regions are
excessively fierce and barbarous, even though, in a material sense,
they are far advanced; and man or his slaves proved even more
destructive than ants. In those latitudes, man was gifted with a
peculiar, restless energy which kept him active at fever heat; and he
occurs in such numbers as to make his presence a problem to be
reckoned with at every step.</p>

<p>The very first day confronted us with the three chief dangers we
had to face in the course of this march which soon assumed all the
characteristics of a retreat and which ended as a rout. Sadly
depleted as were our ranks from the start, we still presented a proud
body full of energy and the lust for adventure--a body, I flattered
myself, which any power would hesitate to attack. I anticipated
difficulties; and I had already expressed myself to the effect that
henceforth we should have to consider ourselves as soldiers first and
as ants of science only afterwards; but I had not even anticipated
what awaited us on our first day.</p>

<p>We were in high spirits when, having crossed a small river which
barred our way, we saw ahead of us, on a sloping mountainside, a man
who was riding on a curious machine consisting of two revolving
wheels one of which was capable of being turned sideways. This man,
strange to say, we were destined to meet with more than once; and so
I shall give him a name and call him the Wheeler.</p>

<p>At sight of him, seized by forebodings, I called a halt.
Unfortunately, our scouts were too far advanced for immediate and
effective control; and the Wheeler, who was looking right and left,
must have caught sight of one of them who had lost touch with the
columns following her. He alighted; and, having done something at his
wheel which, at this distance, I could not observe in detail,
straightened up, armed with a bag, a forceps, and a trowel, and
looking singularly like that other man who had scooped up so many
hundreds of our soldiers in the human barn.</p>

<p>Instantly I was alert; and a moment later Bissa-tee signified to
me that she, too, had recognized him. It was, indeed, the
myrmecologist.</p>

<p>But for the moment it did not look as though he were bent on
booty. Apparently he was stooping over the scout, leaving her alone.
She reported later that she lay motionless under his scrutiny,
shamming death. From her he proceeded a few steps in our direction. I
am afraid I made a tactical mistake; for we were still separated from
those scouts by a distance of at least a hundred antlengths; and had
we remained motionless, we might have escaped detection. In fact,
such was plainly Assa-ree's plan; for she gave the signal to lie low.
But I had already gathered all the scent material needed for a
general order and could no longer retain it. So my overruling command
welled forth, half in spite of myself: Seek cover. It was instantly
obeyed; and instantly the motion attracted the Wheeler's attention.
Three or four steps of his brought him into our midst; and he bent
down to raise, with his forceps, every leaf of every one of the
sparse xerophytic plants that covered the ground. Nothing else could
be done: we all shammed death. He opened a little bag and, with his
forceps, picked up a score of us, slowly and deliberately, scanning
each as he did so through his double eyes. He actually picked me up,
too; but he dropped me again, preferring to put Bissa-tee into his
bag. Since I had no longer any doubt that he was collecting ants for
the purpose of study, it was a source of mortification to me that he
should choose Bissa-tee as a specimen instead of myself. But, as I
have said, Bissa-tee was physically a rather splendid ant, big and
active; I had nothing to recommend me but my brain.</p>

<p>Next, this human myrmecologist did something which I did not
understand at the time but which I can explain now. He took out a
note-book and, with an instrument called a pencil, jotted down notes
about the observations he had made. For we found that man's memory is
poorly developed; he could never have kept a record like the present
one without such aids; and as, for direct communication, he relies
exclusively on his voice and his ear, so, for indirect communication,
he relies on his very imperfect sense of sight, making visible marks
on paper which he knows how to produce. Next, to my utter amazement,
he unhooked his outer pair of eyes, put them into a shell resembling
a very large pupal case, and slipped them into a fold of his
integuments.</p>

<p>And then he was gone from among us. Remounting his double wheel,
he turned about.</p>

<p>I was much disconcerted, for I never expected to see Bissa-tee
again; but, freed from the menace of the human presence, I at once
asked for a report of the missing. It was found that the Wheeler had
picked up twelve soldiers and eight scholars of whom, fortunately,
Bissa-tee was the only leader.</p>

<p>What was to be done? I gave orders to re-form the ranks and to
proceed. I might say that by this time the whole body of the army was
massed in front, a formation indicated by the reduction in our
numbers.</p>

<p>We were still descending the now gently sloping mountainside,
having been on the march again for another three or four hours, when
a confusion in front was slowly propagated backward. None of us knew
what was going on there; and I was most indignant at not having
instantly received a telescent report. Assa-ree, who had lately
become exceedingly independent, asserted afterwards that such a
report had been given at once but, for unknown reasons, had failed to
reach the rear.</p>

<p>The whole column had come to a stop before I knew that anything
was amiss. I was anxious not to be delayed; for, though we had been
descending all day, and though it was now midsummer, we were still at
too great an elevation to be quite safe from the cold. A most
vexatious delay held us up. Since Lemma-nee's death in the battle
with the chicken I had, in addition to my other functions, assumed
that of geographer-in-chief to the expedition, for unfortunately
Lemma-nee, in picking her associates, had aimed more at completeness
in her subordinate staff than at the qualities of leadership which
would be needed in case of accident to herself. So I consulted our
only remaining physiological barometer which registered a low
atmospheric pressure; from which fact, in conjunction with other
indications, I drew the conclusion that the night was going to be
overcast and probably warm.</p>

<p>I had hardly done so when a messenger arrived from Assa-ree. This
messenger, instead of simply giving her report and quietly awaiting
my orders, thought fit to indulge in the most impertinent scents,
asking what was the matter with the High Command that there were no
orders forthcoming? Were we all asleep that we left the vanguard to
perish without support, without sense or purpose?</p>

<p>Such insubordination I could not overlook, and my whole staff
agreed with me. Somehow we were all in a state of tension; everyone
felt by this time that we had entered upon the most trying part of
our enterprise. At the isthmus, surrounded by numberless vagrant
hordes of Ecitons, we had never felt thus: our morale had been
excellent, our discipline beyond reproach; and the spirit with which
our troops had faced danger and certain death had often called forth
my admiration. Even this very morning, as I have intimated, we had
been in excellent fettle. And now? What worried me most was the
question to what extent the behaviour of this messenger might reflect
the attitude of Assa-ree.</p>

<p>I moved my right antenna the slightest bit; and I am glad to say
that Azte-ca, who was nearest to the offender, understood me
instantly. With one leap she was on the offender's back, bearing her
down by sheer weight and clasping her neck between her jaws. Thus she
waited for my verdict, I lowered my antenn&aelig;; the culprit's head
was severed; and her body was given over to the soldiery in front. It
was not a lovely sight to see them tear it to shreds which were
promptly devoured.</p>

<p>Necessary as was this act of discipline, it still further delayed
matters, for no report was forthcoming. I despatched Adver-tee, the
recorder, to summon Assa-ree.</p>

<p>Adver-tee hurried away. In less than five minutes she was back,
dejected and in consternation. The vanguard, she reported, was in
touch with a formidable hostile army consisting of many tens of
thousands of a small, unknown ant. Assa-ree was in command; and she
had absolutely and disrespectfully refused to obey the summons.</p>

<p>Was this mutiny? I gave orders not to stir and moved forward
myself, through the lines of my dismayed staff and through the very
centre of the army, the soldiers opening a lane for me. But this they
did in a sullen way; and here and there I noticed disrespectful
scents that were being emitted as I passed. So far, I chose to
disregard them.</p>

<p>I found matters as Adver-tee had reported. The ants with which the
vanguard was engaged were quite unknown to me; and at this juncture
Bissa-tee's absence was particularly regrettable. Assa-ree was in the
very front line; some five hundred of our fiercest fighters were with
her. In front of them, the ground was strewn with corpses: but
ninety-five per cent of them belonged to the enemy. They were small
but savage little creatures; and as their ranks were mown down by our
sickle-jawed soldiers, wave after wave of new troops of theirs came
up to the slaughter.</p>

<p>Fortunately, night was at hand. I waited patiently; and in less
than an hour I noticed an abatement in the fury with which the enemy
attacked. Gaining a slight hill, I could soon observe backward,
concentrating movements in their ranks; they left only just enough
troops in the fighting lines to cover their retreat. Now the
extraordinary powers which I had received from Her Majesty Orrha-wee
before setting out from home had been given in the shape of pellets
of the royal perfumes which I carried in my infrabuccal chamber. I
carefully selected one of them, the perfume of supreme command, and
rolled it forward between labrum and tongue. I left it exposed to the
air for just one hundredth of a second and then gave my summons; the
effect was instantaneous and complete. Assa-ree shrugged her
shoulders, dropped her antenn&aelig;, and turned to follow me.</p>

<p>I had half intended to expose, in the midst of the army, the
perfume of instant death, most formidable of the powers conferred
upon me by Her Majesty, just to set an example among the mutinous
hordes and to show them that, the moment I wanted to, I could make
them drop like flies before a poisonous breath; but when I saw what
an effect Assa-ree's appearance produced in the ranks as she meekly
followed in my wake, I thought it wiser to refrain. The whole
incident convinced me once more, if further proof was needed, that
sooner or later things would come to an issue between me and
Assa-ree; but I was not unmindful of the fact that it lay in the
interests of the expedition to postpone the evil moment as long as
possible, for, though willy-nilly, we were still advancing. The
battle we fought was nothing less than a defensive one.</p>

<p>We reached the point where my staff was assembled; and as if by
mutual consent they arranged themselves in a half circle to receive
us. The open diameter of this half circle was formed by the
rear-guard of the army; and in its centre lay the head of the
decapitated messenger, still moving convulsively its antenn&aelig;
and eyes.</p>

<p>It looked like a carefully prepared arrangement; and it suited my
purpose. I led Assa-ree to a point just behind that head and bade her
stay there. I myself took up a position in the midst of my staff,
facing Assa-ree. After an impressive pause I scented my plea,
addressing my associates as a court martial.</p>

<p>"What," I asked, "is the penalty for wilfully disobeying Her
Majesty's Supreme Command in peace and war?" "Death," came the
unanimous verdict in a lugubrious scent. "You have heard the
sentence," I addressed the prisoner. "Do you know any reason why it
should not be pronounced?" And I touched the pellet of the perfume of
death with my labrum--a motion which did not escape Assa-ree.</p>

<p>She blackened; but her sullen defiance was not yet broken; I do
not think she knew what the perfume was which I held there. For a few
minutes she hesitated, deliberating perhaps whether or not to treat
my indictment with silent contempt. But she, too, knew that the time
was not ripe for an open breach. My own unconditional followers were
still too numerous.</p>

<p>Within a few seconds she stirred. "High Commander," thus ran her
plea, "I did refuse obedience; but to whom? I was much provoked. I
had long been in the fore-front of battle and was wounded. The stings
and bites I had received were smarting; dust and grit had entered all
my wounds. I had been holding the enemy with nothing but my vanguard;
for I did not care to engage the rest of the army without your
consent. Give that consent at this late hour, and I shall sweep
resistance away. I sent a messenger to ask for an order; she did not
return. Your orderly appeared at a critical moment; I know the ant
you sent: an idle scenter who, even at that moment, could not forget
that her strongest point was sweetness and seductiveness of scent. In
the very act of giving your summons, she saw fit to brush a speck of
dust from her antenna with her strigil and to polish up her fifth
abdominal segment with a hind-foot. I felt overcome with anger and
answered sullenly, I suppose. And who could blame me? I am a fighter,
unendowed with the gift of meek ingratiation. But scents emitted
under such circumstances signify nothing. I have done and leave the
rest to you."</p>

<p>Now I could not deny a certain justice to that plea. Adver-tee was
somewhat of a fop; and perhaps it had been a mistake to send her. To
execute at the present moment a sentence of death, with the only two
of my staff missing who had been intimate with me, would have been
injudicious; I was not yet prepared to dispense with the army; and
only Assa-ree could hold it in subjugation. The very fact that she
had condescended to plead amounted to an apology, given in the
presence of my whole staff and the rear-guard of the army. Her
services had more than once enabled the expedition to do its work;
and while, under the present circumstances, it was peculiarly
distressing that she should have been unable or unwilling--it was
hard to tell which--to avoid an armed conflict, I saw at once that,
should it prove impossible to appease the enemy, there was only one
way of getting past, namely, by a wheeling movement which would take
us around the hostile formicary while a continuous battle was being
fought on a slanting front. Such a battle could not be fought without
Assa-ree.</p>

<p>So I allowed an appropriate interval to elapse and then raised my
right antenna into the perpendicular, in sign of suspended sentence.
I was conscious of a feeling of relief all around. Assa-ree stood
motionless for a while. Then, with a profound salute, so exaggerated
as to make me doubt her sincerity, she turned away.</p>

<p>But the thing was done. I gave orders to encamp for the night.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We were not yet settled when, to my immense surprise and relief,
Bissa-tee appeared in our midst. She was in a state of terrific
excitement. One might have expected that excitement to proceed from
exaltation or exultation; but it did not: it was simply the result of
extreme exhaustion and depression.</p>

<p>All the members of the staff rushed over to her and recoiled; they
had meant to overwhelm her with congratulations. But she waved them
aside. She never stopped till she had reached me; and I was
profoundly moved at the sight of her: her eyes were glazed her
antenn&aelig; ragged; she staggered; and the moment she reached me,
she rolled over at my feet.</p>

<p>I had her attended to at once; all her wounds were thoroughly
licked; her antenn&aelig; and her legs were straightened out and
rubbed.</p>

<p>But the most terrifying thing about her was that she exhaled a
disabling smell which made everyone who came near her feel faint. She
was soaked in poison. From her whole body a gas exuded; most
distressingly from her trache&aelig;, especially those on the meso-
and metathoracic segments; for the latter, ordinarily closed in
Myrmicine adults, had opened under the influence of the poison which
was readily absorbed by the adipose tissues and which considerably
reduced even my weight by liquefying my fat which oozed away into the
ground. A physiological analysis which I ordered at once to be made
proved it to be a highly complex hydrocarbon.</p>

<p>Fortunately my weather forecast had proved correct; the sky was
clouded, and the atmosphere damp and warm. This was especially
welcome because Bissa-tee's unexpected return and the nursing she
required interrupted the preparations for encampment. I anticipated
days of delay.</p>

<p>Night had fallen when Bissa-tee stirred again. By this time the
exhalations from her body had become fainter. In the dim, diffused
light of a hidden moon I saw her slowly move her antennas and,
thinking that she was groping for me, I stepped into the path of her
movements. She at once signified to me that she wished me to come
close and to dismiss all those attending upon her. I did so; and with
extreme exertion, slowly, and in fits and starts, she told her
tale.</p>

<p>First of all she enumerated our associates who had been picked up
with her; to add that everyone of them was dead. The Wheeler was
indeed a myrmecologist. At his abode in the human city he kept whole
tribes of ants in captivity, confined in artificial nests of
<i>glass.</i> He had dropped a dozen or more of her fellow-captives
into these nests, one at a time, and reaching for a new nest whenever
he picked up a new Atta. Meanwhile, Bissa-tee had been confined in a
large cylinder whence she had been able to look on at the
proceedings. In each and every case the ant thus dropped into an
alien nest had at once been torn to pieces. Bissa-tee had fully
expected to share the same fate; but, strange to say, she had escaped
it. When only she was left, the Wheeler had fetched a flat wooden
case smelling strongly of certain oils found in the earth. To her
horror, she had seen, in this case, innumerable ants of all
descriptions, dead, and pierced by steel spears four ants long which
were stuck into the floor of the case: it had been a sight to make
her blood curdle.</p>

<p>He had picked Bissa-tee up with a forceps and compared her with
these specimens. Having done so with one case, he had fetched
another; and thus he had been occupied for hours without any result.
Every now and then he had consulted huge tomes similar in shape
(though much larger) to the note-book in which he had jotted down
observations at the time of her capture. These Bissa-tee described at
great length, for she did not know that I had already seen this human
device; nor did I interrupt her; I feared to distract her and to
break the thread of her terrible tale. At last, putting her back into
the glass cylinder, he had foolishly tried to tempt her with all
sorts of food: honey, starch, fragments of insects, etc. Failing in
this, he had picked her up again and, placing three small sticks on a
piece of white paper, in the position of three radii of a circle, he
had inverted over them a bell-glass and slipped her under it. For a
while longer he had sat and looked at her. But ultimately he had
taken up a small wad of cotton and dipped it into a liquid contained
in a stoppered glass; this he had inserted under the bell imprisoning
her. From it the poison had come with which she had been impregnated
on her arrival among us. It was gruesome to listen as she went on:
how she had first fainted, then partly recovered; and henceforth, for
an hour or so, crouched low, feeling and watching the process as this
poison slowly entered her body, dissolving in and spreading through
her tissues. By this time the Wheeler had left her.</p>

<p>At last she had made up her mind to escape or perish in the
attempt. But she was weakened; for the rough and inconsiderate
handling to which she had been exposed had bruised and abraded her in
many delicate parts; and for a long while she had been unsuccessful
in all her attempts. Yet she had realized that she must not rest.</p>

<p>And then a great thought had struck her: if she succeeded in
removing one of the wooden sticks, the glass would tilt over on that
side; and perhaps she would be able to upset it. She had gone to work
at once; and to her great joy she had found the task comparatively
easy. Yet, in her weakened state, overcome as she was every now and
then by the fumes, she had taken an unconscionable time to accomplish
it. She had seemed to be working for hours and hours, pushing and
pulling; and when the stick had at last come out, it had cost her two
metatarsal joints of her right middle foot on which the glass had
come down. This had been particularly unfortunate, for she had
counted on getting to the other side of the bell glass before the
momentum of its tilting movement had been arrested. As it was, the
glass retained only a slight trembling motion when she got there.
Nevertheless, she had succeeded in inserting her antenn&aelig; under
its rim and, having done so, had tried to follow them up with the
points of her jaws. But she had selected a position too close to one
of the two remaining sticks; her jaws had been too thick to pass
smoothly through the crack between glass and paper; the glass began
to slip away from her. She realized her mistake at once and tried
again in the exact centre between the sticks. She met with better
success, the crack being wider here. For a long while, however, all
she could do was to synchronize her successive heaves rhythmically
with the vibrations of the glass, thereby increasing them; and
gradually they became sufficient to make the glass rock on the paper,
till it actually left the support of the sticks, though it fell back
upon them after each jump. Under ordinary circumstances, unweakened
by the poison, she would now have been able to knock the glass over
altogether; but of that she despaired. At last she had watched her
opportunity and swung out as the rim on her side was ascending; and
she was just fast enough to reach freedom before it came down
again.</p>

<p>She had now allowed herself to drop from the edge of the platform
on which all this had taken place; and she had soon reached the open.
But there was no scented trail which she might have followed. Yet, a
gust of wind having swept away some of the fumes impregnating her
body, she had, in a moment of sudden lucidity, seen a way out of her
difficulty: she had thought of the wheel. Near the human dwelling,
all tracks had, of course, been utterly confused; but she had
travelled on at random, away from the dwelling, for a matter of a
thousand antlengths or so; and then she had circled the hominary.
This had taken an hour or longer; but at last she had hit upon the
smooth track of those wheels. This track had been paved with an
infinitesimally thin but continuous film of rubber on the sandy
surface of a human road. She had simply followed it to its end; and
there, to her indescribable satisfaction, she had picked up our trail
crossing that of the wheel.</p>

<p>Thus ran her tale, delivered throughout in a scent of horror and
almost despondency which was hard to reconcile with Bissa-tee's
buoyant and unconquerable temper.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before I could answer; for that horror and
despondency affected me profoundly. I have said that, on this first
day of our eastward march, we were to experience the three great
dangers that were to dog us throughout the remainder of the summer;
and if we had, so far, been confronted with only two of them, namely
the incomprehensible animosity of these northern ants and mutiny
within our own ranks, here was the third, the danger from man. In
addition to man's innate hostility to all forms of life other than
his own, there was this particular inducement for him to treat us
with a special savagery in that ants of our kind were unknown in this
country and therefore attracted his attention and aroused his
curiosity.</p>

<p>But I could not afford to indulge in gloomy reflections; there
were immediate problems to be solved; I needed Bissa-tee's help.</p>

<p>For another minute or so I stroked her antenn&aelig;
affectionately, to convey to her some little fraction of what I felt.
Then, pulling myself together, I told her by a single scent that we,
too, had had our troubles during the day. To my relief, Bissa-tee was
at once alert. "Ants?" she asked. And, by a few quick motions, I gave
her a summary of the day's doings.</p>

<p>For a second she pondered. Then she scented succinctly, "A
prisoner." I did not at once understand; and she elucidated. "We must
know who they are. Ask for volunteers to go on a raid and bring in a
prisoner. We may have to dig ourselves in before morning. Don't lose
a moment."</p>

<p>My first impulse was to rush to the quarters of the army. But
better counsel came like an inspiration. I went, instead, to the
place where our colleagues were still assembled in great excitement
over Bissa-tee's return. There, I issued a proclamation on which I
pride myself to this day: "Ants wanted for dangerous service, without
reward."</p>

<p>Every single one pressed forward.</p>

<p>My mind was busy. It was plainly a case of taking the enemy by
surprise. Surprise demanded silence and secrecy. The utter calm of
the night would almost certainly be disturbed if any large number
were sent. Three would have to be the limit. I gave the order to line
up in parade order; and I walked along the line, touching every ant
with my antenn&aelig;, for purposes of recognition. By the time I had
reached the far end, I called Anna-zee, Azte-ca, and Adver-tee to the
front. Turning to Anna-zee, I signified to her my desire that she
should pick from her associates a young ant, nimble and alert, for
this service; for she herself was getting old, and her
ever-increasing obesity disqualified her in any case. She returned
with a singularly powerful and agile individual and assured me that I
could place the most absolute trust in her discretion and
ability.</p>

<p>I outlined my plan. They were to approach the hostile formicary in
the most careful manner; all the rest of us would meanwhile move to a
point half-way between our army and the hill; there, having halted,
we should all stridulate so as at once to alarm the enemy, drawing
forth her scouts, and to cover any noise our raiders might
inadvertently make in their approach. Having picked a scout, they
were to seize her and to bring her in, giving the scent of purpose
achieved as a signal for our retreat behind the lines.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which my instructions were received gave me
heart. The three selected for the service were fretting at every
delay. Yet I restrained them. It seemed imperative that they should
not be rash. I gave orders for them to remain with the rest of us
till we had reached a certain point between the lines. The night was
utterly dark now; the clouds overhead had thickened till every trace
even of starlight was excluded. We fell into marching order and
circled the army. Two or three times we were challenged by Assa-ree's
scouts; but, giving them the scent of the day, we moved on without
halting; in about half an hour we reached as favourable a station as
we could wish.</p>

<p>All those who were to remain with me--there were less than a
hundred now--began to stridulate; and this was the signal for our
three raiders to advance. I will insert a continuous narrative here,
as though I had been with them; in reality it is pieced together from
their reports.</p>

<p>The hill of the unknown ants was straight east of us. Anna-zee's
assistant was to approach it in a straight line; the other two from
the north-east and the southeast respectively.</p>

<p>All over the mound, as our raiders approached, the scent of the
enemy was distinctly perceptible; yet none of our ants had met with
anyone when they reached the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chorus of our stridulation was distinctly audible
there; and the enemy must have been aware of it. It seemed
unthinkable that they should have posted no sentinels. Besides, our
raiders had also failed to locate an entrance crater. The whole
ground under them--the hill was a hundred antlengths high and covered
a circular area with a diameter of at least 240 antlengths--trembled
and vibrated with activity. It was a certainty, then, that the enemy
was expecting trouble. But where was the entrance? Had it been closed
in expectation of just such a raid?</p>

<p>They resolved to circle the mound in a downward spiral: this took
over an hour, for the slope was gentle, and they went <i>en
&eacute;chelon,</i> Azte-ca leading and in touch with the upper trail
which they had made on their previous circuit. To their surprise they
had descended two-thirds of the slope before they became unexpectedly
aware of the immediate proximity of numbers of the enemy just below
them. They halted to take their bearings. By careful observation they
arrived at the conclusion that the single entrance to the enormous
hill was located excentrically, on the flank, within a score of
antlengths from the base; and this entrance was swarming with ants
who were in the greatest excitement; in fact, their excitement was
such as almost to invite an immediate attack.</p>

<p>It served our purposes particularly well that their whole
attention was centred on the plain below. Our raiders were actually
within jumping distance and yet remained unperceived.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we were stridulating in a manner which amounted
to actual hard work. Fortunately, Assa-ree had moved to the front of
our army; and while she was left in entire ignorance of our
intentions, she was still sufficiently subdued to hold her hordes
back when, among the scents which reached her in confusion, she
isolated my body-scent. As we were getting fatigued, however, I began
to worry over the delay. Should it be necessary for us to entrench
ourselves, we should need time; and this thought made me anxious.</p>

<p>Having communicated with each other and agreed upon a plan, our
raiders at last made a sudden rush; and then they retreated at once
to the top of the mound. Each of them had secured a maxim. Azte-ca
had been least lucky in the grasp with which she secured her
prisoner; for, on being seized, the latter had promptly doubled up
and stung her severely in the thorax, injecting what amounted to a
fatal dose of some albuminous poison. So far, however, she held on
and actually succeeded in bringing her prisoner to the rear.</p>

<p>It was Adver-tee who gave the signal of success; and we promptly
ceased from stridulating. In returning to the rear of the army, I
scented instructions to Assa-ree to refrain from all hostilities and
to await further orders. In case of need she was to retreat.</p>

<p>To our amazement, we came ourselves in touch with the enemy's
scouts as we were circling south and west. It was only for a second;
and the scouts withdrew at once; but it was a warning to be on the
alert.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, we had rejoined Bissa-tee whom we found much
improved though still very weak. We waited patiently for the return
of our raiders. When, at last, Adver-tee entered our conclave, she
was without Azte-ca and the nimble botanist; but she brought her
prisoner; and, having surrendered her to one of her associates, she
reported that she had left Azte-ca, overcome by the poison of a
sting, in the care of the third raider, half-way from the strange
formicarium, whence she proposed a number of carriers should bring
her and the other two prisoners in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bissa-tee betrayed considerable excitement. She
carefully circled Adver-tee's prisoner, limping in a way painful to
behold. When she turned to me, her first utterance was one of sorrow;
she lamented the fact that our contact with this tribe, which she
called Pogonomyrmex Occidentalis, should have been a hostile one. She
assured me that they belonged to the great harvesting ants, most
interesting and civilized in their habits, though formidable as foes.
If Azte-ca had received a full dose of the poison, she added, we
should be delayed for days and days, unless indeed we were able to
carry her while on the march.</p>

<p>She had barely finished her report when the detachment of carriers
which I had sent came in with Azte-ca and the botanist, not to forget
their two prisoners. Azte-ca was, indeed, in a deplorable condition;
and I was struck with amazement at sight of the comparatively great
size and the fierce and proud bearing of the prisoner she had
taken.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Bissa-tee seen the latter when, in spite of her
debilitated condition, she gave a jump; and, bowing her still
bleeding antenn&aelig; before the stranger, in a most amusing and yet
respectful manner, half ironically, half triumphantly, gave her the
salute due only to a commander.</p>

<p>"Here," she scented exultantly, turning to me, "we have, as a
hostage, Her Majesty's deputy-commander-in-chief of all the
Pogonomyrmex forces; her capture has cost us heavily, namely, the
certain death of our friend Adver-tee, unless we can induce Her
Excellency to furnish us with the antidote--which, by the way, I
believe we shall be able to do. But even if not, we have paid no more
than this capture is worth."</p>

<p>At these scents Minna-ca, to give her her name as I came to know
it, gave a furious spring as though to attack Bissa-tee in spite of
her wounds and to end her life there and then. But she was in good
jaws; and all she could do was to protrude her sting sheath from
which the gleaming weapon flashed forth ineffectually.</p>

<p>At this juncture I saw fit to interpose and to express, in
conciliatory scents, my regret, as that of the supreme commander of
the Attiine forces, that matters had come to this pass between a
peaceful delegation of scientists and a highly disciplined and
civilized tribe of ants of whom we had heard so much. This was an
empty compliment; for apart from rumours and uncertain tales that had
reached us, we knew nothing of these Pogonomyrmex. Even Bissa-tee
admitted later on that her whole speech had been based on a bold
guess which she herself had been surprised to see confirmed by the
behaviour of Minna-ca. I was still at a loss to explain her knowledge
of this name; but when I expressed my perplexity, Bissa-tee merely
laughed as was her way when she had scored a point. "Wa, be nimble,"
she said, "Wa, be quick!" And suddenly it dawned upon me that
undoubtedly the first prisoner, brought in by Adver-tee, had,
unnoticed by myself, but astutely marked by Bissa-tee, saluted her
with the salute due to a commander-in-chief. I could never induce
Bissa-tee to admit as much, however; she merely repeated that nursery
rhyme when I alluded to the subject.</p>

<p>Now Minna-ca was quite intelligent enough to see that in spite of
our small numbers we were a formidable enemy; perhaps she even
divined that we had weapons which we had not yet used. Whether my
remarks flattered her or not, I do not know; but her attitude became
more conciliatory. The rest was a mere matter of negotiation.</p>

<p>Within half an hour a truce had been concluded for the day. Our
army was to withdraw to the west; and Minna-ca was to send one of the
lesser ants that had been captured to her own city and to enjoin upon
her soldiers to refrain from all hostilities. She herself was to
remain as a hostage; and she agreed to furnish us with an antidote
against the poison injected into Azte-ca.</p>

<p>Perhaps these were severe terms; but we had to make use of the
situation as it had shaped itself. Already a plan was forming in my
mind whereby we might achieve the higher ends of science.</p>

<p>The terms of the truce were adhered to on both sides; and, seeing
that quiet prevailed on the front of yesterday's battle, I more than
once took occasion to engage Minna-ca in a brief exchange of
courtesies in order to enlighten her with regard to the aims of our
expedition. When she began to grasp its scope, she became interested;
and in the afternoon she began to ask a few questions. These referred
chiefly to the climatic and topographical details observed in our
march to the north, and to astronomical questions such as why we
considered the earth to be a sphere; how we explained the alternation
of day and night; what brought about the seasons and the inequalities
of day and night, in summer as well as in winter; whether we
considered the inclination of the axis of the earth to be 66
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> degrees from the plane of its orbit or 23
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> degrees from the perpendicular to it; and
how we accounted for the fact that below the surface there was a
region of almost invariable temperature in the ground. But she also
asked about the civic organization of our state: whether it was
communistic or anarchistic; whether our queens were adopted or
whether we insured the continuity of our dynasty by adelphogamy.</p>

<p>The way in which she listened to my answers convinced me that she
was mostly speaking with her tongue in her cheek. Compared with her
own compatriots, she considered us as mere conceited barbarians; as I
have invariably found that every nation, except that endowed with the
highest degree of culture, thinks itself superior to all others.</p>

<p>When, however, I broached to her the plan that had formed in my
mind, she gave it the most favourable consideration. This plan was
that we should exchange hostages; and that, when this exchange was
effected, we, the Attas, should be permitted to send a delegation
into their city for purposes of study.</p>

<p>Within a few hours this was arranged for. I had the impression
that Minna-ca could not imagine any better means of insuring our good
will than to let us see the perfect appointments prevailing in her
city. The only minor captive remaining was accordingly released to
submit my proposals to the assembly of maxims. The number to be
exchanged was fixed at four; and the exchange was speedily
effected.</p>

<p>I, therefore, accompanied by Anna-zee, Adver-tee, and Assa-ree
repaired to neutral ground. Assa-ree I took along because only thus
could I make sure that there would be no further mischief. Azte-ca
and Bissa-tee had perforce to remain behind.</p>

<p>Arrived at the place agreed upon, we were met by a delegation of
maxims from the so far hostile city. Both delegations, I should add,
were escorted by a force sufficient to guard against treachery.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes we came to the entrance which was situated on
the southern slope of the mound. Our reception was cool but
respectful; and I quickly convinced myself that there was nothing to
fear. Our escort undoubtedly considered that the life of Minna-ca and
her three fellow-hostages was worth any number of dead Attas; and the
agreement was that, should anything happen to any one of us, she
should be the first to be put to the jaw. Only once, in the course of
our visit, did I see a sting flash; and, one of our escort bending an
antenna towards the offender, the motion was immediately changed into
a military salute.</p>

<p>As for the city, a brief summary of what we saw must suffice; for
details the student is referred to scent-tree number 703 in which, as
nearly as possible, considering that Adver-tee was dead, her minute
report has been embodied.</p>

<p>The whole mound was surrounded by a disk of earth 360 antlengths
in diameter cleared of every trace of vegetation; beyond it, to the
east, lay the kitchen-middens or refuse piles. The mound itself was
most carefully constructed of small pebbles brought from the
subterranean chambers, of which there were about a thousand. The
matter excavated had invariably been piled up north of the entrance
where it was in turn at once riddled with excavations; in fact, the
higher we penetrated within the mound, the greater was the proportion
of excavated space to solid masonry; and the lower we went down, the
farther from each other were the chambers spaced. From the whole
arrangement I could readily reconstruct, in my imagination, the
history of the colony. Like those of most ants, it must have taken
its inception from a single and unattended queen who, having
excavated a tiny chamber and piled the matter removed in a fan-shaped
mound north of the entrance, at once proceeded to rear her first
brood of minims.</p>

<p>A large majority of these chambers was filled, or partly filled,
with the carefully husked and cleaned grains of grasses, especially
towards the top of the mound. Since these grains had often, after
heavy rains, to be brought to the surface in order to be dried, and
in order that those that had sprouted might be removed, this seemed a
very sensible arrangement; whereas the brood chambers were located at
a depth which insured a minimum of change in temperature.
Individually, these lower chambers were hard to ventilate; but their
more scattered position and the great steepness of the connecting
galleries prevented any serious vitiation of the air. In fact,
though, as compared with the burrow of the Myrmecocysts, this mound
seemed close and crowded, there prevailed a degree of neatness and
even elegance which did not fail to impress me.</p>

<p>As for the ants themselves, I was struck with the great size and
weight of the hammerlike heads of certain individuals. These, I was
told were the crushers whose chief duty it was to comminute the hard
grains for consumption by larv&aelig;, callows, and minims. Each
fragment of starchy matter was, before being fed to a larva, coated
with saliva; and thereby the starch was, at least partly, changed
into sugar and made more readily digestible. The workers were,
however, not highly polymorphic.</p>

<p>We did not see a sign of Her Majesty. I made a discreet enquiry
and was promptly told that Her Majesty was upset by yesterday's
losses and had gone into mourning.</p>

<p>So, when our circuit was completed, we were politely ushered back
to the entrance; and we took the hint. Our guides had observed the
most scrupulous courtesy; but it had remained untempered by any
cordiality. We had, indeed, been invited to partake of the crushed
seeds; they were tendered, however, not as the offerings of
hospitality, but solely for the sake of acquainting us with their
strictly vegetarian diet.</p>

<p>We returned in solemn procession to our starting-point where we
were met by a detachment of our own ants surrounding the four
Pogonomyrmex hostages which included Minna-ca.</p>

<p>There remained a last formality: that of ratifying the terms of
our retreat. Minna-ca insisted on our leaving within seven days. I
had been in hopes that we should not be exposed to such a demand;
but, after having sent a messenger to enquire from Bissa-tee and
Azte-ca whether they thought seven days sufficient for their recovery
and having received an answer in the affirmative, I agreed. This
messenger I sent chiefly in order to save my face; I did not want it
to appear as though I embraced Minna-ca's terms too readily.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we held a general review on the fourth day
and departed within the next twenty-four hours. We still went
straight east; and for a number of days we passed one Pogonomyrmex
colony after the other. There was constant battle; wherever we
appeared, we were attacked; and this warfare of attrition did not
cease till we were beyond the range of these ants. Whenever we came
within 2,400 antlengths of any clearing of theirs, we were in contact
with their scouts; and at last we established a regular routine in
getting past. We trained a shock-troop of some 500 picked fighters
who met the attacking column and, gradually swinging to the right or
the left, as the case might be, so as to cover our flank, they kept
the enemy engaged while we marched past; when we had done so, they
defended our rear till we were disengaged. No doubt the records of
these numerous colonies boast to this day of an unbroken series of
victories over an invading army of giants.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that such actions could not be fought
without losses; and while they were comparatively slight on our side,
they counted more heavily against us than those a hundred times as
large counted against our enemies. The worst of it was that we soon
came to the point where we had to leave our wounded behind. At first
we made an attempt to carry them with us; but we found that we were
unconscionably delayed by them and that the efficiency of our army
was seriously impaired by such a burden. Assa-ree claimed that our
wounded were the direct cause of further losses; for, if we marched
unencumbered, we passed each hostile colony in half the time; and our
losses were directly proportional to the time required for doing so.
Still another consideration had to be urged in favour of the unantly
expedient of abandoning our casualties to the untender mercies of our
enemies: only about half of them recovered ultimately. Only too often
did we find that we had carried an ant along for four or five days in
order to have her die anyway at the last. I even found that, in
Assa-ree's ranks, there were those who found themselves unable, in
spite of all warnings, to resist the temptation of cannibalism; and
all those who partook of these ghoulish feasts were promptly taken
ill themselves, some of them with fatal results. I was in despair.
Expediency demanded that I should do what no Atta had ever done
before; and I was to do it on the motion of Assa-ree! The whole
expedition had now entered a phase in which we could consider nothing
but the ultimate aim: not to let the ever increasing sum of our
findings perish with ourselves.</p>

<p>Desperate counsel came to me sometimes, at night. I knew it was
the opinion of Bissa-tee, Anna-zee, Azte-ca, and many others that we
could increase our chances by getting rid of the army and advancing
henceforth by stealth. They admitted that, without the army, we could
never have done what we had succeeded in doing; they even suspected
that, without it, we might find it next to impossible to get home
again. Yet they did not shrink from the conclusion that, for the
present, our chances of survival would be increased if we could make
ourselves less conspicuous. Occasionally I was almost inclined to
reason as they did, especially when one of my own associates fell a
victim to the sting of a Pogonomyrmex. We thus lost our last two
physiological thermometers and the only remaining barometer. All
three had to be abandoned; for here is another point: we could no
longer claim privileges over the rank and file; differences between
privates and officers were wiped out. I could neither detail carriers
for the service of conveying members of the High Command nor delay
our incessant battles by allowing those among ourselves who
volunteered to carry their own associates; in either case I should
have precipitated a mutiny in the ranks.</p>

<p>Yet, for a handful of us to sneak away and to leave the rest to
their fates--no, I could not yet do that.</p>

<p>And then, one night, I received an entirely unexpected revelation
which added tremendously to the burden of care which I was bearing
already. We had somehow managed to evade two hostile armies; and
every ant in the army as well as in the High Command was completely
fagged. I had been in hopes that I might still give the order to
entrench; for we were in the centre of an area which served as a
no-ant's-land for three equidistant Pogonomyrmex colonies, all of
them ready, at the first provocation, to fall on us or on each other.
But Assa-ree declared that she dared not give any such order before
the troops had had some rest. "Very well," I replied, "form
clusters." Fortunately we had a few dead gum-trees in sight; and
preparations were instantly made. I was, during a last tour of
inspection, forcibly struck with the slenderness of the army cluster
suspended from the small branch of a tree. Our own cluster was
outright minute.</p>

<p>I was turning to the latter in order to insert myself in its very
centre when I was accosted by an ant from Assa-ree's staff. She
touched my abdomen and then crouched down in deep grass. At first I
thought she was wounded; but her next touch conveyed to me a desire
to have private communication with me on a vital matter. She was a
powerful ant; and I hesitated: she came from Assa-ree's immediate
entourage, and there might be treachery afoot. Yet I liked her way:
she seemed to be worried but frank. I allowed her to take the lead
and to guide me to a secluded point within the cleared disk around
one of the Pogonomyrmex mounds. I suppose she chose this location
because it enabled us to see all about us: no spy could have
approached unperceived.</p>

<p>Treachery was afoot indeed. This was what Assa-ree's aide
communicated to me.</p>

<p>All our findings, geographical, geologic, climatic, zoological,
and botanical, had been carefully watched by Assa-ree and records of
them entrusted to certain ants in her suite; among ourselves, they
were severally entrusted to certain ants, besides being communicated
to myself who, by reason of my enormous memory, was best fitted to
act as a depositary and a check on the separate mnemonic prodigies
which formed Adver-tee's group of associates.</p>

<p>This was amazing news. Assa-ree had no scientific training; nor,
of course, had any member of her staff. They were unable to grasp the
import of our findings except in a popular recast. Any check record
would have been welcome; but the value of these records kept by
Assa-ree was necessarily impaired by the fact that they were made by
ants who knew nothing of what they were supposed to record. Whole
contexts were almost sure to be entangled and subverted.</p>

<p>But above all, what was the purpose?</p>

<p>My informant hesitated; and what she signified next made me
inclined to place an absolute trust in her. Much of what she had to
say was conjectural, she admitted; but it was based on facts
observed. Thus, one day, Assa-ree's body-servant being indisposed,
she, my informant, had been detailed, much to her indignation, to
supply that functionary's service. Knowing Assa-ree's ungovernable
temper--a characteristic I was unacquainted with, never having served
under her in an inferior capacity--she had complied without protest;
and, while absolute certainty in such a matter could be arrived at
only by a medical examination, yet she would be willing to stake her
life on the assertion that Assa-ree was fertilized.</p>

<p>This was a tremendous blow. I saw it all in a flash. It explained
so many things that I accepted it at once as true. It had been
rumoured at home that Assa-ree laid eggs. It was no uncommon thing
for a worker to lay an occasional egg; the fact was treated as a
misfortune rather than as a crime, though repeated lapses were looked
at askance. But among Attas, as among most other ants,
parthenogenetic eggs produce males only; and, if Assa-ree had laid
parthenogenetic eggs habitually, it must have resulted in a
preponderance of males over females in our colony; it had not done
so; in fact, the approximate equality of the numbers of males and
females in the perfect castes of our colony had been the cardinal
fact in my disregarding and discrediting all those rumours. If it was
true that Assa-ree was impregnated, the fact furnished a new and
different explanation.</p>

<p>And then came another still more staggering revelation. My
informant, having given me time to digest what she had told me, went
on as though there had been no pause. In spite of the fact that
Assa-ree had, at the time, not partaken of any food whatever for more
than twenty days, there had been a distinct fecal odour about the tip
of her gaster.</p>

<p>I could only stammer, "What do you mean to imply?" But of course I
knew well enough before she told me. That fecal odour could have
proceeded only from her receptaculum seminis. Horrible as it was in
its implications, the inference could not be escaped. The
implications were not only horrible in the extreme; they were so
far-reaching that I reeled with their impact.</p>

<p>The first of them was, of course, that Assa-ree herself, though
she had certainly never had wings, had been fertilized by an Eciton;
all her offspring, therefore, were crosses between Atta and Eciton;
and that accounted for many things: for their easy fraternization
with pure-bred Ecitons; for their ferocity and their strange
appearance; for the ease with which they had lived on the land as we
went; for their fanatical attachment to their leader.</p>

<p>But would an Eciton male have paired with Assa-ree at the time of
her criminal romance if she had herself been undoubtedly Atta? If
not, there must have been, a generation ago, an older Pseudogyne or
false female among our mothers and foster-mothers; and a third before
that; and so on, back into the past, ad infinitum: a terrible
thought! Unless, indeed, this whole series of crimes was initiated,
at a comparatively recent time, by some freak of nature? But that was
unlikely; for all biological experience shows that variation takes
place in a divergent, not a convergent line. The whole thing was
bewildering in the extreme.</p>

<p>And what about the future? Assa-ree, knowing that she was
fertilized and, therefore, able to produce offspring of all three
castes, male, female, and worker, was securing to herself the results
of this expedition which constituted the greatest undertaking ever
ventured upon by ants. With what aim in view? There could be only a
single one. She harboured treasonable thoughts: she was going to
return to our home; and she was going to court popularity there by
making it appear as though she and not we were the ones through whose
devotion, enterprise, and initiative the findings of our scholars had
been obtained and preserved. But in order to reap all that glory for
herself, she would have to dispose of us, the true explorers. What
could be easier? She had the army: she would turn the army against
us; and in all normal probability we were lost, one and all. Then,
what? She would lead the remainder of her forces home in triumph;
and, patiently waiting her time, she would ultimately reap even the
crown or, alternatively, bring the crown under her domination. She
would pass herself off as a perfect dealated queen; and there would
be the end of our glorious nation. She might even attempt a <i>coup
d'&eacute;tat,</i> deposing or beheading our Gracious Queen, Her
Majesty Orrha-wee. Nothing would be beyond her reach.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, why should she go on protecting us? Clearly,
for one single reason. Without us all further exploration would
cease. Every day new discoveries were being made, new territory was
described; for that she needed us; without us she could do one thing
only, fight her way home. Neither she nor any of her associates could
do our work: the only record she could have accumulated would have
been of a military exploit: and she knew, of course, that Attas lay
little stress on military fame. No doubt she meant to keep us till we
had reaped the full harvest and then to sacrifice us to her
ambitions.</p>

<p>In this she had overlooked one single point, namely, that, as the
highest of the powers conferred upon me, I held that little pellet of
the royal perfume of death in my infrabuccal chamber; and Assa-ree,
not being a perfect female, was unable to produce either it or that
other perfume which annuls the former's action.</p>

<p>A second point was in my favour: I was forewarned and therefore
forearmed: and Assa-ree did not know it; at least not yet. But
henceforth continual watchfulness and suspicion must be the order of
the day; never again could I approach Assa-ree without being prepared
to lay her low at a moment's notice; and, what was worse, never again
could I allow myself to be cradled in sleep without having someone
stand guard over me and mine.</p>

<p>I pondered this. The thought struck me that this officer who was
apparently pure Atta might join us and that she and I might take
turns in this duty. It would not do. Such a course would betray my
knowledge to Assa-ree who was bound to notice what I had done. I
could not even allow this officer to return to the army. Just how
much she knew of what her revelations implied I could not tell; but,
unless she realized at least part of their import, she would hardly
have come to me in this way. In other words, she was essentially a
traitress; she must know that she had delivered over her supreme
commander into my jaws. This was a terrible dilemma. If safety there
was for me and mine, it was owing to her; but it was achieved through
treason. Without that treason we might at any moment have been
murdered. Yet treason begets treason. Treason is not a casual act of
misdemeanour. Treason is the outcome of a treasonable disposition;
and a treasonable disposition deserved death. But, though her death
was indicated, I resolved to make her happy before she had to
die.</p>

<p>Slowly I brought forward, in my infrabuccal chamber, between
labrum and tongue, the pellet of royal favour which, when inhaled
after the royal perfume of death, overrules it; but, when inhaled
before it, merely makes the latter painless in its effect but is
itself overruled by it. I saw the officer who shall remain nameless
faint with ecstasy; and then, as I allowed the pellet of royal favour
to slip back and brought forward the pellet of instant death, I saw
her rear on her hind-feet as though in greeting; and then she was
blotted to the ground. Peace be with her soul!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We remained at this station for three days. Even I needed the
rest. I was now in my ninth year; and, while Her Majesty's prediction
that my life would be prolonged by the greatness of my task had
undoubtedly come true, yet I was beginning to feel the effect of
extreme old age. I am happy to be able to say that it did not impair
the powers of my mind; but the incessant marches of the last forty
days told on my bodily strength; and the constant worry had
superinduced a severe insomnia.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that my rest remained unbroken, I issued orders
that nobody should leave camp. I took Bissa-tee and Azte-ca partly
into my confidence, telling them that I feared mutiny in the army;
and henceforth both faithfully shared my vigils. I have mentioned
that our cluster was fastened to the lowest branch of a dead
gum-tree; and every night we took turns in mounting guard on that
branch.</p>

<p>Now the third night Bissa-tee who had had the second watch, did
not, when I came to relieve her, go to rest in the centre of the
cluster but remained with me on the branch. I at once surmised that
she had something to communicate.</p>

<p>The night was absolutely calm; and the lower atmosphere was laden
with moisture. On such nights all scents seem intensified: the
perfume pervading the air dissolves in the minute droplets of water
afloat and saturates them. Bissa-tee was facing the point where I had
had my interview with Assa-ree's disaffected officer; and suddenly
she raised her antenn&aelig; rigidly up into the darkness above. I
did the same and perceived a peculiar though very faint odour coming
from that quarter. It was a scent of death and decay, uncanny,
alarming. It was not carried by any motion of the air; it was itself
dead and motionless. Whatever was decaying there was exhaling an aura
that expanded about its point of origin like a huge atmospheric
hemisphere; but, this aura being heavier than air, it flattened out
in this utter calm and reached our post by gravity.</p>

<p>My first thought was, of course, of the officer who had dropped
there; but a little reflection caused me to dismiss it; to create an
aura pervading such a distance an ant of the size of a horse would
have been needed. I was profoundly disquieted; and so was Bissa-tee.
She had made no motion, had emitted no scent. We stood there for half
an hour or longer, as though the prolongation or repetition of our
perception could have furnished a clue.</p>

<p>At last I lowered my antenn&aelig; and turned to descend the tree.
Bissa-tee followed me; but, as we passed the cluster of our
associates, she touched me to signify her wish that I should wait for
her. She entered the cluster and, in a few minutes, returned with one
of her subordinates who at once began to lick me from head to
sting-sheath, coating my whole exoskeleton with her saliva which I
recognized as being aseptic. Having finished with me, she did the
same for Bissa-tee who at last desired her to go back to sleep. I
felt grateful to Bissa-tee for taking this precaution dictated by her
solicitude.</p>

<p>When we reached the ground and began to proceed in the direction
of the smell, it became speedily intensified and so distasteful that,
under any other circumstances, I should have turned back. Soon we
distinguished the germs of pestilence floating about in the air,
greatly enjoying themselves in the warmth of the night; for it was
now midsummer. Some of them were charming little things, iridescent
in the faintest colours of the rainbow. The wisdom of the precaution
taken by Bissa-tee became apparent now; for many of these germs began
to alight, in frolicsome and elastic springs, on our armour,
especially in the neighbourhood of our mouth-parts and our
trache&aelig;. Every one was instantly killed by the protective
coating we had received.</p>

<p>At last, through an ever-thickening cloud of these germs, we
approached the scene of my interview with the officer; and an
appalling sight met our eyes, for by this time there was the faintest
trace of light in the east.</p>

<p>In front of us lay an enormous heap of dead ants, all of the
hostile species. It was piled just inside the cleared disk
surrounding the mound of the nearest colony. There were hundreds of
thousands of them, piled to the height of a hundred antlengths; and
all were stark-dead. It was a scene to shake the stoutest heart. Far
in the east the grey of dawn stood in a sky of featureless cloud; a
sloping plain stretched away to meet it, without a tree, without a
shrub, without even a tall weed, featureless like the sky which it
seemed to reflect. It looked like chaos before the creation; or like
some scene from the end of the world, such as our poets sing of, when
life has just become extinct on earth. We shivered.</p>

<p>And then we turned back. Bissa-tee, the unconquerable, was
conquered. "We must flee," she scented as we went. "This is the end
of all life on earth; at least of all ant-life. An epidemic is
sweeping the world." And then, having turned for a last look, she
stood arrested again.</p>

<p>I had been following my own thoughts; but when she stood still, I,
too, stopped and looked back. And now we saw something which seemed
for the moment still more appalling. We had swerved a little to the
west of our former path; and so a corner of the pile came in sight
which had before been hidden from our eyes.</p>

<p>There, from a neighbouring formicary, a long line of living ants
was coming through the low-growing and spreading plants. On and on
they came, hurrying, scurrying, helter-skelter, all pressing forward
toward that pile of destruction. Those that reached it, promptly
began to scale its flanks, hastening upward and spreading out and
then falling dead and forming a new layer over the old ones.</p>

<p>This was so amazing that for some time I could not tear myself
away; and when I did so at last, I moved over still farther to the
west. Thence I saw a second line of ants coming from the east,
behaving exactly like the first; and then a third and a fourth line;
they were coming from all directions; and all of them climbed the
pile of death and fell dead themselves, most of them remaining where
they fell, though a few of them rolled down the slope and widened the
base.</p>

<p>The light was getting stronger with every moment; and the germs
which in the previous dimness had been phosphorescent and easily
visible began to pale; but when I held my eyes focused a little in
front of the pile, I could still see them. They formed a dense cloud
covering the pile like a hood. Since they thrive in darkness, they
were all trying to enter the interstices between the dead ants; but
the temptation to feast was too great; and they are peculiarly
organized in such a way that they coil up in contact with a surface
from which they absorb food through the skin. This is quite
mechanical; and as the food is absorbed, their bodies swell out at
the point of contact; but, in order to distribute the absorbed
liquid, they straighten out with a sudden jerk which, by reason of
their exceeding lightness, sends them flying up again. It was,
therefore, a long while before I could see any diminution in the size
of the cloud. But very slowly it contracted.</p>

<p>It was time for us to depart; orders had been given to be ready
for marching at sun-up.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee signified her desire to take one of the dead ants along
for analysis and dissection; but I, knowing how the destruction had
been wrought, interposed my absolute veto.</p>

<p>At our tree nothing was stirring yet; and I was glad of it; I
thought it best to avoid all unnecessary enquiries. I remounted my
post, enjoining the greatest secrecy on Bissa-tee; and I remained on
the branch for another half hour before I gave the general alarm.</p>

<p>In that interval I pondered what I had seen. The dead Attiine
officer had, in her death, been impregnated, first with the perfume
of royal favour, then with the perfume of instant death; and though I
had given her only infinitesimal doses of both, they are very
tenacious; and I had been able to distinguish both in the faint aura
as we had approached the pile. Now the perfume of royal favour is
much more volatile than the perfume of death; and it has this further
peculiarity that the faintest trace of it, absorbed by an ant,
induces that ant to bring into play her power of differential
apperception: she will ignore all other scents but this single one;
it she will follow no matter where it leads; for it seems to promise
power and everlasting satisfaction of all desires; and this
satisfaction appears suddenly as a veritable heaven on earth. She
has, from that moment on, no other desire than to inhale this
money.<sup>1</sup> Nothing will hold her back; no consideration of
honour; no love of kind; no sense of formicarian dignity. Have it she
must should it lead her to death. But the royal perfume of death
lingered more closely about the officer's body; and, as the pile of
its victims grew, it was successively absorbed by the outer layers at
the top.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> This is another case where, in the text, as
communicated to me by Wawa-quee, a word appears which seems to have
no connection with the context and the provenance of which I am
unable to explain. In the previous chapter it was the word "author".
I leave these words without trying to account for their presence in
the text. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That was the appalling explanation of what we had seen.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>V</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I was fully aware that, in leaving the place, we should have to
use great care not to expose our own forces to danger from the
perfume of royal favour; though I had already concluded from
Bissa-tee's immunity that Pogonomyrmex, perhaps by reason of their
smaller size, perhaps by reason of the more material bent of their
minds, were accessible to the effect of vastly smaller doses than we
were ourselves. We must leave at once; or we should be caught by the
pest; the urgency of the case admitted of no delay.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a light south wind sprang up before the day was far
advanced. Yet I ordered a south-east direction to be taken for our
line of march; and when we had gone a matter of some two hundred
thousand antlengths, I sent word to Assa-ree to bend north-west
again, so as to resume our original line of travel.</p>

<p>More than once, I might say, we came upon hurrying columns of
Pogonomyrmex, all striving with might and main to reach that pile of
destruction which I was anxious to leave behind. They had caught the
scent and were doomed. As we advanced and broke through their lines,
they seemed to have lost all their pugnacity; they were not bent upon
battle; they were bent on the perfume of royal favour and death. We
had to kill not a few in order to force them to give us our way.</p>

<p>All day long, and for a week more, we pursued our march downhill;
and from the second day on it was fight, fight, fight once more;
though the formicaries seemed to become less populous as we went.
Bissa-tee was much interested in this fact and, from it, at last drew
a conclusion of comfort which, to our joy, we had shortly an
opportunity of verifying as correct. This conclusion was that these
ants do not live below a given altitude; for under the increased
pressure of the atmosphere they become sluggish.</p>

<p>Having travelled a matter of twelve million ant-lengths, we were
at last freed from this scourge and could breathe freely once
more.</p>

<p>No sooner were we assured of this than I called a halt and held a
grand review. The result of the census taken was that our army had
shrunk by more than a third: there were 2,314 fighters, officers
included; and the High Command consisted of 69 scholars. This was
terrible news; and it had a depressing effect on most minds.</p>

<p>Even Bissa-tee seemed to be inclined to advise an immediate
retreat to the south; but when I reminded her of the old legends that
tell of slave-making ants, her enthusiasm was revived. That was what
I loved in her: the passion for knowledge made her forget all danger
and every suffering past or to come. Never lived a more intrepid
spirit.</p>

<p>The plenary meeting of the remainder of our Command was memorable
in more ways than one.</p>

<p>In the first place, the scientific results of this march through a
hostile country were discussed in great detail (see scent-tree number
567). It must not be thought that the Pogonomyrmex were the only
ants, or ants the only object of our study. There were the flora and
the fauna, and within the latter the more or less parasitic insect
fauna; there were the ecto- and endoparasites symbiotic or
synechthrous with Pogonomyrmex, some of them polishing their armours
in their endeavour to make a living off their skeletal excretions or
the coatings with which they covered each other; some preying upon or
within their intestines. Above all, however, there were ants who, in
spite of the dominance of Pogonomyrmex were able to eke out a living
in the midst of enemies and who would perhaps have been unable to
subsist anywhere else. To illustrate, there is the little Dorymyrmex
Pyramicus which builds its tiny nest on the slope of the Pogonomyrmex
mound and subsists by waylaying and robbing, in numbers, single
members of the host species--if it can be so called--as they return
home laden with booty; for Pogonomyrmex never hunts in files, as we
concluded from the fact that no well-paved highways radiate from
their clearings. Why individuals of the more powerful species submit
to these hold-ups without invoking the revenge of the whole tribe on
the robbers was long a secret to us. At last Bissa-tee hit upon the
explanation: every single individual so robbed would be careful not
to expose herself to the ridicule of the whole tribe by admitting
that she had yielded to the compulsion of ants manifestly inferior in
size and power. Probably there were not many Pogonomyrmex in any
mound who had not at one time or other been held up successfully; but
they would never admit it; on the contrary, they would be all the
more emphatic in scoffing at anyone who proclaimed her shame. This
conjecture was strikingly confirmed when a Dorymyrmex was caught; the
sardonic and contemptuous way in which she referred to her hosts as
vain, arrogant, and blundering giants was comical to see; and we,
having no tenderness for Pogonomyrmex, released the little thing, not
without admiring her psychological insight. In a purely ethnographic
sense this encounter was highly interesting because this Dorymyrmex
had a distinct race odour almost identical with that of Tapinoma and
Formica Incerta, the former a close relative (a Dolichoderine), the
latter from a different sub-family, but both occurring over the same
area.</p>

<p>We had also made further observations on man; and we had even seen
the Wheeler again. The latter, however, did not come near us.</p>

<p>A general survey of ants was arrived at. There could be no doubt
that, in our own country, we were the dominant ants; in the next
climatic zone to the north, the Ecitons were masters of the
situation; and thus we mapped the continent out as far as it had been
explored. The eastern plateaux of the mountains were ruled by honey
ants; their eastern slopes by the harvesters. This does not mean, as
I have already pointed out, that no other ants occurred in these
zones; but all ants inhabiting the same zone, must, in every aspect
of their lives, take into account the dominant ants.</p>

<p>This led to a great discussion between Anna-zee, our botanist who
was also a philosopher, and Bissa-tee. But of that anon.</p>

<p>One word about man in this connection. I will admit that I had
long feared that ultimately we might reach districts in which man was
dominant. But the conclusions arrived at on the present occasion and
confirmed later on pointed to the fact that man is nowhere on earth
truly dominant except within his cities and his superterranean
burrows; and often not even there. While he forces individual ants
and individual tribes to adjust themselves to him, yet, on the whole,
he must adjust himself to ants. Ants are vastly more adaptable, more
plastic than man. Even where man grows crops over large areas of the
surface of the globe, ants utilize these crops to a greater extent
than man; so that, in a more profound view, man also has been
subjected and made serviceable to ants. This is one of the great
general and important conclusions arrived at: no matter where you go,
into the tropics or into the subarctic zones, wherever life subsists
at all, there ants subsist and subdue nature to their ends; the rest
of creation pays them toll. To this conclusion about the fundamental
dominance of ants as lords of the animal world there is only one
single exception: we Attas alone have reached a level of civilization
which makes it possible for us to live self-contained lives,
respecting, and not interfering with, other forms of animal life
unless we are ourselves interfered with. That is the reason why,
without any hesitation, we can now assert, as a conclusion backed by
science, what, in the past, has perhaps been asserted as a matter of
mere national prejudice, namely, that we Attas must ultimately redeem
the world from the sin of predacious life. We alone are in full
accord with nature's purpose; we alone, as our ancestors would have
expressed it, serve the will of God.</p>

<p>Now for a summary of the discussion that took place between
Bissa-tee and Anna-zee. I have already said that even Bissa-tee, at
the nadir of our fortunes, would have been inclined to advise an
immediate return home; and that she had changed her mind when I
referred to the ever-accumulating evidence pointing towards a fourth
mode of life discovered by ants, namely, that of enslaving other ants
or, which means the same thing, of making themselves dependent upon
these slaves.</p>

<p>As for Anna-zee, it was at all times difficult to arrive at a
precise estimate of her views; she was so given to ironical statement
that she often seemed to argue on both sides of the question.</p>

<p>When we were to decide whether to proceed or to return, Bissa-tee
spoke convincingly in favour of going on with our task; and since
both Azte-ca and Adver-tee fulfilled functions not immediately, but
only indirectly bearing on the ultimate aims of the expedition, they
were open to conviction. I, therefore, welcomed Bissa-tee's eloquent
effort; for it will be remembered that I had deprived myself of my
vote and could only act as chairman of our meetings and as a
clearing-house of ideas. Once a thing was resolved upon, it was my
duty to see to it that it was done; and to this there was only the
one exception of a dead-lock in the meeting of department heads, in
which case I held the casting vote.</p>

<p>Having listened to Bissa-tee, Anna-zee, in the manner
characteristic of her, wagged her huge head over her left shoulder
and slowly heaved herself to her feet. Even the privations and
hardships of our last desperate march had not availed to reduce her
obesity. There are ants who will thrive on next to nothing; and
Anna-zee was one of them. Amid a profound silence she began her great
argument.</p>

<p>All formicarian endeavour, she scented, was oriented in one of two
directions: towards the knowable or the unknowable. In a superficial
view it might seem as though, for a reasoning being, there could be
no choice: the knowable alone was worthy of her effort. But the mere
fact that, throughout the millennia, those who represented perhaps
the finest minds among ants had striven towards the unknowable must
bid us pause; and when we looked at the present state of our precious
inheritance, what did we find? Did not the mass of what was handed
down to us in the fields of philosophy, art, poetry, religious
thought, etc. vastly outweigh what was handed down to us in the field
of science? In fact, what was left of the science of a few millennia
ago? Names, that was all; and, perhaps, a few things to laugh at.
Venerable names--names revered in spite of the fact that the
theories, hypotheses, and so-called discoveries with which they were
associated have long since disappeared into the limbo of a forgotten
childhood of thought. Did we think it would be different with our
findings?</p>

<p>Science asks one question only, she went on: the question "How?"
But ant insists on asking that other question "Why?" This latter
question has not only never been answered; it has been proved to be
unanswerable except by so-called spiritual vapourings which, by any
thinking ant, cannot be received with anything but scepticism. The
question "How?" on the other hand, can be answered after a fashion by
one provisional answer after the other. In a matter of fact, it would
seem, certainty is within our reach; the trouble is that certainty on
one point answers one limited question only and itself opens up other
questions. The achievement of any ant of science is merely the basis
for the achievement of another ant of science; from moment to moment
it is superseded. In fact, she went on, gathering momentum as she
went, since the province of fact, unknown but knowable, is infinite
in extent, all that is knowable will never be known; though, in a
way, we might be said to approach that end; in another way, however,
we may be said to be farther from the goal the nearer we come to it;
for everything knowable that becomes known opens up a view into
realms of the knowable not yet known which exceed in magnitude all
the provinces of the knowable already known by something resembling
infinity.</p>

<p>But suppose for a moment this were not so; suppose that, with
everything knowable that becomes known, we diminished by exactly that
much the realm of the knowable not yet known; and that ultimately we
succeeded in changing all knowable things into known things, what
should we have gained? Precisely nothing. Man, it is true, from what
she had seen of him, might conceivably think himself a gainer; for
man does not strive after knowledge for the sake of knowledge; he
strives after it for the sake of increasing his power. Ants, who have
long since abandoned that aim, seeing clearly that material
progress--which means no more and no less than the increase of power
for the achievement of material ends--would side-track them in their
essential task which was to live this life of theirs fully--ants
could never be satisfied with so low an aim; and that for the very
reason that they see themselves as thinking, exploring, feeling, and
reasoning beings--not as slaves of material ends. What, then, stands
at the end of a complete exploration of the knowable world? What, if
such an end there is, stands at the end of science? At that end
stands neither more nor less than a complete realization of our
ignorance. For, since it is ant-nature, since it always has been and
will ever remain ant-nature, to ask that question "Why?" we shall
merely find ourselves confronted with the whole realm of the
unknowable; in other words, the best that science, even on the basis
of our assumption, can achieve is the conversion of the vast knowable
universe into an unknowable universe.</p>

<p>But, of course, as she had already pointed out, the knowable
universe being infinite, this dilemma could never arise. Well, then,
ultimate value there is none in science. Meanwhile, is there a
relative value? There is; but that value is not increased by
increasing knowledge. A single known fact would be sufficient to
create that value. For the moment a fact is known, the moment a
single how is known, that moment ant-reason hammers at it with the
question why; and in that lies its sole and exclusive ultimate value.
Ants are constituted in such a way that they must ever try to storm
heaven. They are suspended between two worlds: the world of the
knowable and the world of the unknowable; and from that very fact
arises their transcendent mission which consists in the task of
expressing their feelings with regard to a callous universe. To go on
adding to the collection of known fact is merely one more way of
expending one's life uselessly, not superior, perhaps not even
equivalent, to that other way of swinging the hammer "Why?" But, if
it had to be one or the other, the gift of expressing her feelings
being denied her, she, being old and obese, preferred the latter; and
she could swing that hammer sitting in comfort at home.</p>

<p>This, she proceeded, after an impressive pause, might seem
strange, as coming from one who had gone so far. But it had always
been her opinion that one thing was as good as another; and, while
she hoped that we should support her by our vote, she would go on
with us if such were our pleasure. It did not matter. She simply
found it easier to sit and be fed than to march and go hungry.</p>

<p>She stood with her antenn&aelig; trembling sardonically. Then she
dropped heavily to the ground, resting her case and spreading out her
legs sideways.</p>

<p>Her discourse had made a profound impression on both Azte-ca and
Adver-tee. I was vainly searching in my mind for something to
counteract that impression when, opportunely, Bissa-tee stirred her
long limbs and briefly gave her opinion to the effect that all that
was "rank nihilism".</p>

<p>Anna-zee's head shook over her left shoulder, and her
antenn&aelig; trembled. It was most unusual for her to deliver
herself of long speeches; in all my experience she had done so only
twice; once on the occasion of our visit to the ant-colonies on
Acacia Sph&aelig;rocephala, and just now. For the former she had made
up by a silence of many months, broken only by monosyllabic remarks
on the flora of the districts traversed. In the present case, all
four of us understood her silence to mean that she considered
Bissa-tee a consummate ass; and I could at once see that Adver-tee
was sufficiently sensitive to be won back to Anna-zee's side by this
attitude of silent contempt.</p>

<p>Azte-ca remained doubtful. In her way she was a genius; she could
find ways and means of communicating with ants and other insects and
even, as we shall see, with mammals which no one else could find; but
essentially she was an ability in the concrete, without brains. Yet
she stood too near the throne and the powers that be; the scent
nihilism had thoroughly frightened her; and her expression betrayed,
when she looked at me, that she was conscious of having very nearly
walked into a trap--a fact of which I was glad.</p>

<p>Adver-tee, on the other hand, was won to Anna-zee's side; and in a
way I could not but admire her for it. Whoever is familiar with the
reaction of sullen resistance which had, at home, greeted advanced
and ultramodern speculations, political as well as scientific,
tending in the direction of this scientific nihilism or in that of
political anarchism, will at once understand that Bissa-tee could not
have said anything more effective in counteracting her opponent's
arguments than the thing she had said. At home, the mere suspicion of
being in sympathy with such dangerous speculations had been
sufficient to ruin an ambitious ant's career. Yet Anna-zee's prestige
was such--and since the very beginning of our expedition it had been
steadily on the increase among the members of the High Command--that
a comparatively young ant like Adver-tee was dazzled by her
intellectual powers and foolishly inferred that Anna-zee was a coming
ant.</p>

<p>As for me, I was now quite satisfied with the course the argument
had taken; I knew what I had to expect. I promptly put the question
to the vote, which was evenly divided: a fact which gave me what I
wanted, the chance of deciding the issue by my casting vote. With its
help it was resolved to proceed as soon as we were sufficiently
rested.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a strange coincidence that in course of time we should once
more have run across our old human enemy the Wheeler. But one day, a
month or so later, there he was again, crossing our very line of
march a few thousand antlengths ahead, riding on his two wheels. I
promptly gave the signal to halt and to lie low.</p>

<p>But he never troubled us; and since we were marching without a
vanguard of scouts, we were not perceived, in spite of the fact that
he alighted straight in front, in the margin of a small copse. Having
laid his wheels on the ground, he picked up a stick of wood and stuck
it into the soil and into certain masses of decaying wood. Then he
bent down and, with his fore-feet, took hold of a huge flat stone
which he upended and allowed to drop upside down.</p>

<p>At this moment a tremendous wave of sound swept over us, produced
by a second human whom we had so far not noticed. He was stationed a
considerable distance to the north, in the margin of the same copse;
and he was excitedly shouting to the Wheeler, no doubt summoning him
to his assistance; for the latter ran for his wheels and
departed.</p>

<p>We were near enough to getting beyond reach even should he turn
back. So I gave the signal to proceed.</p>

<p>Our path lay a little to the north of the point where the Wheeler
had been halting; and since I had given the order for a forced march,
we soon passed it. Judging that we were out of danger from the
humans, I halted again; for I was curious to see what the Wheeler had
been doing. I took the precaution, however, of sending scouts back to
watch their movements, with instructions to give the alarm should
they, or either of them, turn back in our direction. As for the army
and the remainder of the High Command, I gave orders not to break
ranks and to be ready to march at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Then Bissa-tee and myself made for the point where, at the foot of
a tree, the Wheeler had raised the huge flat stone. A very short time
only had elapsed; and we were able to witness the last consequences
of the Wheeler's action.</p>

<p>In order not to expose ourselves unnecessarily, we climbed the
north side of the tree to a height of perhaps seventy antlengths and
then circled the trunk.</p>

<p>To our delight, we saw a large, irregular, flat chamber which had
been covered by the stone. In its centre a cylindrical opening led
perpendicularly down into the soil. A small corner of the chamber was
still filled with naked pup&aelig; and excitedly hurrying workers of
a pale, medium-sized ant of the genus Formica. As I have said, we
were just in time; for the workers promptly seized the remaining
pup&aelig; in their jaws and poured down, with them, into the
subterranean galleries.</p>

<p>We were on the point of turning away when, in the south, a motion
caught my eye. I stopped, watching closely; and within a few moments
I became aware of a widespread disturbance in the sparse, parched
grass covering the soil. Bissa-tee had also seen it.</p>

<p>A minute later it became clear that it arose from the approach of
an army of a larger ant belonging to the same genus Formica. They
were drawn out in an irregular semicircle south of the uncovered
nest, advancing rapidly and excitedly.</p>

<p>When the first scouts reached the uncovered spot, they stopped,
emitting volley after volley of scent signals which much increased
the excitement prevailing behind. Soon the edge of the uncovered
patch was swarming with ants, many of them clambering over those in
front to get sight or scent of what lay before them. But they did not
invade the chamber. In fact, their hesitation and the indignation of
the ants in the front lines who kept pressing back while those behind
pressed forward was ludicrous to behold. They quarrelled and jostled
till the very rear-guard of the army had arrived, and even
longer.</p>

<p>At last a huge worker leapt into the chamber and made for the
opening to the burrow. But at its edge she suddenly turned tail and
scurried back. Her example, however, had brought down three others.
These, in a more dignified manner, approached the opening less
precipitously; and, having reached its edge, seemed to be peering
down, as though trying to explore it without entering. This again
went on for several minutes, the hordes on the edge of the clearing
meanwhile pushing and jostling each other in the most laughable
manner. Those behind called those in front cowards and slackers; but
the moment they reached the edge of the chamber themselves, they
became cowards and slackers in turn.</p>

<p>Till at last another powerful individual made her way from the
rear, over the bodies of those in front. This ant, with a sort of
deliberate braggadocio, approached the entrance and actually vanished
in it. But in less than a second she came flying out again as though
propelled by some superformicarian power. For the whole remainder of
the time she stood in a corner, brushing and combing legs and
antenn&aelig; with her strigils, and working jaws and lips as though
anxious to remove whatever had been flung on her.</p>

<p>From then on one ant after the other did exactly as she had
done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile orators had begun within the ranks to deliver the most
insulting and stinging scents which increased the general confusion;
for those wedged in struggled fiercely to pull these demagogues down
from their exalted stations on the shoulders of the rest.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after more than half an hour, the whole army surged
forward and poured down into the entrance till it seemed as though
they must fill every subterranean chamber and gallery to capacity.
Yet they remained invisible for fully a quarter of an hour before the
first of them re-emerged with a larva in her mouth, setting off for
home. After another interval a second ant appeared, carrying a
pupa.</p>

<p>Then, to our amazement, the queen of the species attacked made her
exit, followed by a solid phalanx of her own workers, all carrying
larv&aelig; and pup&aelig;; and these escaped, breaking through the
ranks of a cordon which had remained behind, circling the edge of the
patch. The ants in this cordon tried to tear these fugitives to
pieces; but they, dropping their pup&aelig; and larv&aelig; which
were promptly seized by the assailants, offered such a resistance
that the robbers were glad to let them escape.</p>

<p>And now began a general flight from the nest. The assailed species
left everything behind as they poured out. Arrived at the surface,
they still fought on; but they did so only to cover their retreat,
leaving many of their number on the field of battle, whereas the
assailing species had very few casualties. Fifteen minutes after the
commencement of the retreat no ants of the attacked species were left
on the premises; and the raiders, laden with larv&aelig; and
pup&aelig;, went home in triumph.</p>

<p>Within two hours of our arrival neither assailants nor assailed
were to be seen. We secured one each of the corpses of the two
species and returned to the army. Both these species were new to
science, and Bissa-tee named them very appropriately Formica
Rubicunda and Formica Subsericea, the Rubicundas being the
assailants.</p>

<p>This raid which we had witnessed opened up a number of problems;
and Bissa-tee and myself were discussing them on our way back when
one of the scouts returned to report that the humans were approaching
rapidly on their wheels. We reached the army in record time.</p>

<p>I gave orders to our forces to dig themselves in. But to my
surprise Azte-ca asked for leave of absence. Naturally, I demurred.
She insisted; and when I asked for her reasons, she hesitatingly made
an amazing announcement. To put it briefly, she proclaimed that
<i>she had found a key to the human language.</i></p>

<p>This was so extraordinary a thing that, had I fully grasped its
import, I should have been willing to send the whole army and my own
associates into certain death, provided that such recklessness had
given <i>me</i> that key. As it was, I gasped; and Azte-ca spluttered
out her tale. Ever since we had met with man, she had carefully noted
his sound-symbols; and by tabulating them, she had been able to
arrange them in order of frequency--till she had succeeded in
interpreting half a dozen of them with a fair degree of certainty.
But the great find had come during our stay in the human barn when
she had made it a rule to scale the great height of the human
shoulder, thus, unperceived herself, going about with the man as he
did his work and listening to the ejaculations in which he indulged
and to the occasional louder speech with which he addressed other
humans; soon she had enlarged her vocabulary to a degree which
enabled her to grasp the drift of almost anything he might say. She
had kept this a secret even from me because she had wished to attain
perfection before we reached that part of the country in which,
according to the legends handed down to us, man was more or less
dominant.</p>

<p>I was at once dumbfounded and delighted; and so was Bissa-tee who
begged me to let her accompany Azte-ca. I had only one hesitation.
Azte-ca--and I believe I have said this before--was in her way a
genius; and I did not wish to expose her to any danger. Yet, when I
saw the eagerness and enthusiasm of these two who, as far as age
went, were mere striplings as compared to myself, I too was
infected.</p>

<p>In a flash my mind was made up. I would not only send them: I was
going to go myself. This did not suit Azte-ca; for the first time I
saw her half rebellious; but a moment later she submitted,
stipulating, however, that I should mount a tree and look on from a
distance only. Stipulating! Under any other circumstances I should
have punished her for daring to prescribe to me. But in my excitement
I overlooked the fact and agreed. After a last look around, to see
that my orders were being obeyed, I turned, and we departed.</p>

<p>On the way to the point where we expected to find the humans we
ran into the excited multitudes of the Subsericeas who, however, did
not pay the slightest attention to us; they were far too busy digging
a new nest for themselves under the enormous half-decayed root of a
fallen tree. The humans we found examining their deserted nest.</p>

<p>We halted at a respectful distance and adopted a waiting attitude.
They soon left the Subsericea nest and methodically began to circle
it. No doubt they were searching for the Rubicundas, intending to
enslave them in turn.</p>

<p>A matter of 5,000 antlengths straight south they came upon their
burrow. Azte-ca, as by common consent, assumed command of the
situation. She led the way to a tree near the new location and
climbed it, signalling me to follow her and Bissa-tee to wait at its
base.</p>

<p>When we had reached a convenient height, she motioned to me to
remain where I was and herself dropped to the ground. I was mortally
afraid that her motions would attract the attention of the humans;
but they, too, were preoccupied. I lost sight of my companions and
did not see them again for some little time.</p>

<p>It was mere chance that I did so at last. Imagine the daring of
these investigators! When I caught sight of them, they were stationed
on the concave rims of the boat-shaped integuments covering the
crania of the giant marauders. I admit these were excellent points of
observation; but, considering that the humans were rapidly moving
about, bending down and straightening up, I trembled for their
safety.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the humans were incessantly conversing and laughing;
for thus I interpreted the seismic tremblings of their shoulders and
the spasmodic withdrawals of their thick lips from their flashing
teeth, symptoms occasionally accompanied by rumblings as from distant
earthquakes.</p>

<p>Next, one of the two, the Wheeler, dug into the Rubicunda nest
with a huge instrument consisting of a flat metallic blade and a
wooden handle. Azte-ca later assured me that it was called a "spade"
though these humans did not so call it; they used a different sound
which she tried to imitate and which sounded like "pelle". I will not
waste time over the matter; we found later that humans have many
different systems of communication called languages which they can
use interchangeably though the medium used is always the voice: thus
language serves two purposes with them, the purpose of communication
and the purpose of preventing communication.</p>

<p>The Wheeler having opened the formicary, his companion scooped up
a large number of the frightened inmates who were wildly trying to
escape with their larv&aelig; and pup&aelig;. But their speed could
not compare with that of these ruthless robbers who, by a single
step, could cover a distance of eighty antlengths.</p>

<p>The whole raid was over in a tenth of the time which the Rubicunda
raid against the Subsericeas had taken. Laughingly the humans packed
up their booty; and then they gathered their tools, fastened them to
their wheels, mounted the latter, and departed. Where were my
friends?</p>

<p>I was just ascertaining that half of the Rubicunda nest remained
undisturbed when, to my infinite relief, I saw both Bissa-tee and
Azte-ca waiting for me at the foot of the tree. Their purpose
achieved, they had dropped to the ground and escaped. The Rubicundas
had been too dismayed to molest them.</p>

<p>The eyes of my companions glistened with excitement; and since I
was very anxious to hear whether they had observed anything that had
escaped my vigilance, I beckoned them to join me on the tree and to
report. Azte-ca briefly stated what I have already told, adding that,
under the circumstances, the progress made in her knowledge of human
speech had been negligible.</p>

<p>But Bissa-tee had secured more information with regard to the
composition of this colony than she could have secured by any other
means in the course of many days. In this nest there had been at
least three Subsericeas for every Rubicunda; and the Subsericeas, the
slaves, had been just as much dismayed by the human raid as the
Rubicundas, and just as anxious to rescue the broods which had also
consisted of the same proportions of the two species. A few adult
Subsericeas, however, had apparently been taken in the recent dulotic
raid; and those, she had been able to observe, had still retained the
alien nest-odour. Not even the general disaster of the human
irruption had sufficed to overcome the hostility of the worker mob to
this foreign body in the commonwealth. She had seen Subsericea and
Rubicunda workers laden with eggs and larv&aelig; dropping their
burdens to decapitate in passing these alien adults who had been
brought in, perhaps by mistake, perhaps by callows not yet
sufficiently versed in the tactics of the Rubicundas. For the adult
Subsericeas that had the nest-odour of the formicary were treated as
equals by the Rubicundas and even seemed to applaud them and to
rejoice in the success of the recent raid which must have added
hundreds of eggs and larv&aelig; to the common stock. What interested
me most was that Bissa-tee, in one or two cases, had actually
observed Rubicundas in the act of devouring Subsericea larv&aelig;;
for this fact explained to me the origin of these mixed colonies: it
was hunger that sent the robbers on their raids; the keeping of
slaves was more or less incidental.</p>

<p>Another interesting point was that among the slaves there were a
few individuals of a third species (Neoclara) which shows that the
militant Rubicunda does not, when driven by hunger, restrict herself
to a single species of victims. But, once adopted or raised in the
nest, the slaves are accepted on an equal footing with the broods of
the host. The raiding army, however, had consisted exclusively of
Rubicundas.</p>

<p>Those were the results of our observations. Before I leave this
subject of the Rubicundas, however, I will add that we met with them
every now and then for many weeks, and that once we had the singular
experience of being the object of one of their raids.</p>

<p>On that occasion, Bissa-tee presumed so far as to issue a general
order without consulting me. We were entrenched in a temporary
formicary and had made a futile attempt at raising fungi on
leaf-shreds of the corn plant cultivated by man. Bissa-tee's order
was to lie low and to offer no resistance. I did not think it
advisable to insist on a reckoning with her for this breach of
discipline; for, as it turned out, I could not have given a better
order myself. The Rubicundas swarmed all through our chambers,
expressed their disgust at our abortive fungus gardens and their
admiration at our size; but, finding neither eggs nor larv&aelig; or
pup&aelig;, left us unmolested and departed to search for more
suitable victims.</p>

<p>In this I am anticipating; for by that time we were already in
contact with another type of ant which saw to it that, throughout the
remainder of this march to the east, we did not forget them.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We did not remain in as continuous a contact with this new ant of
the genus Polyergus (the species varied with the locality) as we had
been, let me say, with the Ecitons of the isthmus or the Pogonomyrmex
of the slopes; we met them only occasionally; but when we did, we had
to admit that, as far as sheer courage and military brilliance were
concerned, Pogonomyrmex and Ecitons had been mere amateurs and
bunglers. Both Ecitons and Pogonomyrmex had been formidable chiefly
through their numbers; but the colonies of Polyergus were not
populous. Neither was their sting as formidable as that of
Pogonomyrmex; nor their jaws as large as those of Eciton. They were
perhaps the most beautiful terrestrial creatures whom it was our fate
to meet with in the whole course of our expedition. They were
wine-coloured; or, when two-coloured, the gaster was black and the
rest of the body a delicate mauve-red; or, towards the Atlantic
seaboard, the reverse. As for their stature, the first species we
met, which Bissa-tee called Polyergus Breviceps, were stockily-built,
and their legs were short; but as we advanced and met with the
two-coloured species, their stature underwent a corresponding change,
becoming slenderer, longer-legged, and more elegant, till, in
Polyergus Lucidus, the largest of them all, we had to acknowledge
that, owing to the delicate proportions of their slim and shining
bodies, their long, gracefully articulated legs, and their brilliant
colouring, we seemed to see the ideal of earthly beauty. Strange to
say, among these, the male was the greatest marvel, for the
colour-scheme of the body was almost miraculously enhanced by the
fact that their wings were pure white.</p>

<p>But what made them such formidable enemies? Their morale.</p>

<p>When we had our first meeting with them, we were approaching that
great river which divides the northern continent into two unequal
halves; and we were travelling through an almost level country
densely populated and cultivated by man.</p>

<p>The season was that marvellous one in which the year seems to come
to a halt. The heat of the summer sun still seems to linger in soil,
rock, and water. Yet a certain crispness of the atmosphere calls for
brisk exercise and the exertion of all physical powers. At the
precise moment of the meeting we had been on the march for eight or
nine hours; but we hardly felt any fatigue; the dry and clear air
made us forget such hardships as we had had to endure.</p>

<p>The order of our inarch was the usual one, with a few scouts in
front, spread out in fan-shaped lines, and the shrunken body of the
army following in massed formation, with the High Command bringing up
the rear. The army, I should say, marched in a loose column, sixteen
abreast.</p>

<p>Suddenly report after report came in from our scouts, of the
approach of a small body of red ants from the south, at right angles
to the direction of our march.</p>

<p>Anxious to avoid hostilities, yet impressed with the necessity of
being prepared for anything, I gave orders to execute a flank
movement, thereby doubling the width of our column. Our soldiers, I
am afraid, were itching for a fight: the movement was carried out
with beautiful precision. We never stopped or even slowed our
march.</p>

<p>Assa-ree repeated my orders in a precise, almost nonchalant way
which showed that she was in no way flustered or alarmed. Her
attitude was exactly what I should have wished; it was well
calculated to make a potential enemy inclined to negotiate rather
than to fight.</p>

<p>The Polyergus came straight on, led by some four or five maxims
who, however, were constantly changing.</p>

<p>Assa-ree now speeded up our march in such a way as to let the
clash, if clash there was to be, take place between the van of the
approaching enemy and the strongest part of our own body where our
ranks now marched thirty-two abreast.</p>

<p>Both she and I had climbed the stems of some tall weeds so that we
could communicate with each other across the whole hostile army; for
by this time a conflict seemed unavoidable. I gave the signal to halt
and to face the enemy.</p>

<p>The Polyergus came on in a dense, massed formation of twenty-five
ranks twelve abreast; they strained eagerly forward as though unaware
of our presence.</p>

<p><i>And there was no battle.</i> The Polyergus kept straight on,
barely delayed. With their short, sickle-shaped mandibles they put
our soldiers to the jaw as though they were defenceless callows of
some peaceful kind; or as though they sabred their way through so
many dead masses of vegetable debris.</p>

<p>And then, having passed through our ranks without a casualty on
their side, they disappeared to the north.</p>

<p>We could only gasp. Yet I must say that we were as yet hardly
aware of what had happened; the whole encounter, if such it can be
called, had not taken more than ten or twelve seconds. Where, half a
minute ago, the flower of our veteran forces had stood, straining for
battle, there was nothing but an expanse of sparse, cropped grass
strewn with writhing bodies in the agony of death.</p>

<p>Disconsolately I climbed down and advanced to the scene of the
disaster where I met Assa-ree. For the second time since the
beginning of the expedition she, too, was prostrated with dismay and
grief. Every one of our soldiers who had been in the line of the
Polyergus march had head or thorax pierced; and either brains or
ganglia were trailing in the dust. There were 384 casualties, forming
a lane twelve antlengths wide through the centre of our army; and
every one of these casualties was a total loss; but the worst
consequence of this disaster, as I realized at once, was the effect
it was bound to have on the morale of the dwindling remainder of our
troops.</p>

<p>What with the occasional small losses which we had had of late,
our total number was now reduced to less than 1,800. Two or three
more encounters like this, and where was our chance of survival? How
were we going to cross that great river which I was firmly convinced
we should shortly reach? Yet, of course, it would never have done to
let anyone in army or Command suspect how this disaster discouraged
me. I gave orders for our medical officers to examine the wounded and
to save as many lives as they could. We were delayed for an hour or
so, till Bissa-tee, rejoining me, reported that nothing could be
done.</p>

<p>I had the ranks re-formed; and we proceeded; it seemed imperative
to get away from the place.</p>

<p>On the march, Bissa-tee kept close by my side. For a while she
observed silence; but at last she began to communicate to me the
thoughts which had been set in motion by this encounter.</p>

<p>The tribe of Polyergus, she signified, belonged to the
slave-making ants. That column which had just marched through our
lines was bound on a dulotic raid. From the numbers of other ants
available in the district it seemed likely that their slaves were the
same as those of the Rubicundas. No ant, indeed, had been as commonly
met with during the last few weeks as the peaceful and comparatively
uninteresting Subsericea. Whenever and wherever we had met them, they
had invariably been occupying newly excavated nests; and rarely had
there been many callows; which seemed to point to the fact that their
formicaries had recently and frequently been raided for their broods.
Subsericeas, then, were the most likely slaves.</p>

<p>What sort of life did the masters live? Bissa-tee reasoned thus: a
military endowment so brilliant, so irresistible, cannot but be
compensated for by the lack of endowment in other directions; it
implied generation upon generation of tradition and a lifelong
training besides. This, then, was the picture she painted for me.</p>

<p>In the nests which swarm with Subsericea slaves--probably there
are six or seven slaves to every master--these amazons of the jaw
lead an idle life doing nothing. Their mouth-parts are such as to
disable them from taking nourishment by themselves except perhaps a
little liquid food on which they stumble by chance. Left to
themselves, even with an abundance of food available within easy
reach, they would starve to death. Most of their time in the
intervals between raids is taken up by their begging food from their
slaves who regurgitate freely to them; or by their submitting to the
complex processes of the toilette which is also performed by the
slaves who never tire of combing their antenn&aelig; and legs and of
polishing and coating the highly chitinized and exceedingly hard
plates of their armour. Thus these hero-masters lounge about, abject
in their behaviour to the slaves, or treating them with the haughty
disdain of a superior race; but constantly degenerating in all the
faculties demanded for the ordinary functions of life and developing
at the same time in that one direction of military exploit and
enterprise.</p>

<p>The time comes when the whole colony, masters and slaves, face
starvation unless a raid is made. Since the very continuance of the
colony is dependent on the raising of pillaged pup&aelig; and of the
eggs laid in the nest by the Polyergus queen (who, Bissa-tee
conjectured, is probably not much larger than the soldiers), it would
never do for them to feed on uninjured pup&aelig; of the
slave-species; and the broods of the master-species are of course
sacrosanct.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the masters must sally forth for a raid. Meanwhile,
individual scouts have been scouring the neighbourhood, travelling
singly; the results of their explorations have been communicated and
discussed in great detail by all the soldiers. Their plans are made
in advance: everybody knows exactly what is to be done.</p>

<p>One afternoon they start out. There is no hesitation. The location
of the Subsericea nest or the nest of any other species to be
plundered is exactly known. If, when they arrive, everything is found
to be as it was signalized, they never stop but pour in at once.
According as they do or do not meet with resistance, they plunder or
fight. A colony of the slave-species that has never been plundered
before is apt to oppose itself to the proceedings; but those who are
familiar with the results sure to follow submit, bent only on
escaping alive without irritating the raiders into violence.</p>

<p>On returning home, the masters are greeted by their slaves who
admire their prowess and take their booty from their jaws. Carefully
they sort out the larv&aelig; and such pup&aelig; as are injured by
the hard, denticulate mandibles of the robber-barons. The uninjured
pup&aelig; are stacked in the brood-chambers; the others placed in
the coolest parts of the burrow where they are likely to remain
longest alive.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Polyergus soldiers are impatiently tramping
about, stamping the floor of the chambers and loudly demanding to be
fed. The slaves pay little attention to them till their task of
sorting and storing is done. But at last they hurriedly fill their
ingluvies; and, having done so, they hasten to placate, by
regurgitation, their masters who by that time are threatening to put
every slave to the jaw unless their appetites are stilled at
once.</p>

<p>The larv&aelig; and the worst-injured pup&aelig; are eaten first;
the less badly injured pup&aelig; are left for later; and often the
slaves hide from their masters large numbers of them which promise
partial recovery; for the inclement seasons of the late fall, before
hibernation begins, and of the early spring have to be provided for
by storing living food.</p>

<p>Often, Bissa-tee continued her imaginative sketch, the lust of
battle overtakes the Polyergus, especially the younger ones, long
before such food as has to be consumed at once is exhausted. In that
case the slaves restrain their masters in their military ardour; and
often, among the old, the reverse happens: the slaves have to urge
them to go on a raid long before they like to do so. Who, then,
exclaimed Bissa-tee, is master, who slave?</p>

<p>Worse may happen. The free Subsericeas have observed a Polyergus
scout exploring their locality. They hold a council; and as a result
of their deliberations they decamp. When the Polyergus arrive, there
are no slaves to be carried off; they have had their pains for
nothing.</p>

<p>Perhaps they have been in the neighbourhood for a year. Every
colony of the slave-species is aware of their presence; every one of
them migrates. No matter how eager, brave, and brilliant the raiders
are, there is no booty, there are no slaves to be found; from raid
after raid they come home empty-jawed. Perhaps, when they can find no
more nests of their proper slave-species, they try the expedient of
bringing in booty from the nests of a new species. But their slaves
are partial to their own kind. They tear all the pup&aelig; of these
alien species to pieces; and the masters find themselves threatened
with the extinction of their slaves. Perhaps, however, an
ever-increasing proportion of a new slave-species is raised by the
old. In that case, in the course of a few years, a new
slave-population takes the place of the old, thus postponing but not
eliminating the evil day; for the perhaps once numerous formicaries
of the new slave-species also decrease in number; and ultimately they
disappear. And then the evil day has come indeed; the masters must
follow their slaves, perhaps invading the territory of a rival colony
of their own kind with which they will henceforth be at war till
either they or their rivals are exterminated.</p>

<p>Truly, Bissa-tee added in conclusion and with a deep sigh, the
life of the capitalist<sup>1</sup> is no bed of roses.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> This is the third time that a word occurs in the text
which seems to be not only without precedent but without
justification. But again I leave it because it is unmistakably there.

<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now the strange thing about these speculations of Bissa-tee was
that they were so strikingly confirmed in the near future; in order
not to weary by repetition, I shall content myself with this mere
statement, omitting the incidents which brought that
confirmation.</p>

<p>When we proceeded, we did so in a state of extreme nervousness;
and henceforth we had almost daily proof of a disintegration of the
fighting spirit in our army. I tried to close my eyes to a good deal
of what was going on; but much of it was forced upon my
attention.</p>

<p>Thus, one day when we had halted for a rest, I saw a small group
of our soldiers who had organized a game outside of the lines of our
bivouac taking flight from a single Polyergus scout, thus leaving us
completely exposed on that side. This scout, therefore, came boldly
into our midst. I happened to be on the outskirts of our encampment;
and so I promptly summoned Assa-ree and told her what I had
witnessed. Whereupon she flew into a towering rage which, I thought
at first, would turn against myself. But suddenly she gave the
general alarm; and the whole remainder of the army boiled up as it
were out of the ground. She had just begun to stalk along the lines
in order to find those who had offended when the Polyergus scout
appeared boldly in front of these very lines behind Assa-ree's back.
I gave her a warning; and she veered about.</p>

<p>A moment later she and the scout had closed in single combat. I
was inclined to give Assa-ree credit for the noblest motives in thus
exposing herself to the gravest danger. Who knows but that she
thought of what might not have happened to us if this scout had
returned to her tribe? That, however, did not worry me. It was late
in the afternoon; and it was unlikely that an attack would be made at
once. Besides, why should they attack us? As far as I knew we had no
brood with us. But Assa-ree might well have overlooked these two
facts. I was still far from having fathomed the whole of her
treachery.</p>

<p>The fight which followed furnished a sight worth seeing, indeed.
Never had I seen anything as ludicrous as the surprise of that
Polyergus scout when she found herself suddenly rough-handled. I
believe these slave-makers have no enemies at all capable of preying
upon them; and it was this element of surprise which gave Assa-ree
her first tremendous advantage. In her initial whirl-wind attack she
succeeded in tearing one antenna and one middle leg from her
adversary's body; but even in doing so she realized her own danger.
The Polyergus was so quick that Assa-ree's superior length and power
of jaw and even her much greater weight were a handicap rather than
an advantage. The Polyergus scout got to her flank whence she could
ward off the bite of her aggressor; she might even have fastened on
to her in a death-grapple in which the greater hardness of her jaws
would have been of immense benefit to her. But again Assa-ree adopted
the exactly suitable tactics: she sprang free and did not return to
the attack for several seconds. This gave the Polyergus time to
realize her wounds which, by this time, had no doubt begun to
smart.</p>

<p>The moment Assa-ree had left her, the scout began a series of
motions which to all lookers-on seemed utterly laughable.</p>

<p>Apparently she did not grasp the fact that her left antenna was
gone; but she must have been conscious of the pain produced by the
fact; for she promptly lifted her left front-leg which was provided
with a pectinated strigil and tried to comb the smart off the missing
antenna. But the moment she lifted the front-leg, she remained
unsupported, on that side, except by her hind-leg; and so she tumbled
over on her shoulder. She righted herself with the help of the
fore-leg and tried the same manoeuvre again, with the same
result.<sup>2</sup> Clearly the fact that both antenna and middle-leg
on that side were gone was beyond her grasp; nothing of the kind had
ever happened to her before. Again and again the same sequence of
motions was repeated; and unmistakably, in the course of these futile
endeavours, the fighting spirit oozed out of her. She seemed to
forget that she was in the presence of the enemy, and bent only on
brushing away whatever irritated that missing antenna of hers: the
very mishap occurring when she lifted her left front-leg prevented
her from realizing or ascertaining that that antenna was no longer
there.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> See Wheeler, <i>Ants,</i> 1913, page 484, for a
similar description. Was "the Wheeler" an unobserved observer of this
scene? E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we all stood about, our antenn&aelig; trembling with
mirth, all except Assa-ree who patiently bided her time. When at last
the Polyergus scout, in utter dejection, turned away to go home,
thinking no doubt to resume her attempts with more success there, her
tormentor was suddenly on her again, moving like a tornado. This time
she straddled her victim from behind; and in less than a hundredth of
a second she had clasped her neck between her jaws. It was all over,
of course. On the highly chitinized armour of head or thorax she
could not have made the slightest impression with her jaws which,
powerful though they were, were not hard enough even to scratch that
armour; but she could easily sever the articulate membranes; and when
she sprang free again, the scout's head lay on the ground, its jaws
opening and shutting convulsively.</p>

<p>For a moment we lost sight of Assa-ree. Bissa-tee was now running
around the amazon's headless body, closely observing it as it moved
off in a sort of high-legged, indignant prance.</p>

<p>When I saw what was happening--undoubtedly she was returning to
her formicary--I gave a quick warning to Bissa-tee. Would not the
return of a headless amazon set all sisters upon our trail? But
Bissa-tee waved a reassuring answer. The trail had not yet been
scented; and while this scout could find her way home in a purely
instinctive manner, she would, without a brain, be unable to find her
way back to our quarters; and in her present state she was unlikely
to scent the route.</p>

<p>When I turned away, I saw Assa-ree once more stalking along the
lines of our army; she was entirely unhurt; and soon she had singled
out all those who had run from the Polyergus scout. There were six of
them; and she aligned them in front of the ranks. Then, before I had
time to interfere in their behalf, she gave the order to tear them to
pieces. As, somewhat later, when everything had once more assumed the
peaceful air of a bivouac, I pondered this proceeding of hers, I came
to the conclusion that perhaps it had been a wise one. Coming
immediately after her own demonstration of the fact that these
amazons were not invincible, the punishment of deserters in the face
of an enemy was bound to raise the morale of the army; and it did
seem to have that effect; for there was a new spirit in the camp that
night. Everywhere, till sun-down, groups were standing or lounging
about, discussing the duel and appreciatively recalling every detail
of Assa-ree's tactics.</p>

<p>But this revival of morale was destined to be of short
duration.</p>

<p>Next morning we came to a strange structure which could not be
natural. We spent several hours in exploring it before I gave the
order to cross. We had, of course, many times come upon roads made by
man; but never upon one like this. We had at first concluded that
this, too, must be a human road; it had the same crosswise
dimensions, and it showed signs of having been scored lengthwise in
the same manner in which other human roads had been scored, either by
such wheels as we had seen used by the Wheeler and his companion, or
by the iron-shod wheels of certain gigantic wooden platforms which
man uses to convey burdens on. The material with which the scorings
on this road had been produced was the same as that observed by
Bissa-tee in escaping from her human captor a few months ago. But the
scorings themselves were much wider; and there were four bands of
them. Besides, the surface of the road was not of earth but of a
substance which must have been liquid when applied. The two or three
chemists who were still with us pronounced it to be a tarry secretion
of some unknown animal, probably, Bissa-tee added, an animal enslaved
by man.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no profit in delaying over an unsolvable
problem. Reluctantly I gave the order to cross.</p>

<p>Now we were hardly well on the road when a most terrifying thing
happened. The road began to heave under us like a living thing; and
from a distance, coming from the north, there swept over us an
ever-increasing noise, compounded of a strident swish and a pulsating
thunder. I did not know how far our army had advanced. I did not even
know where my own associates were; for when we arrived at this
strange structure, we had scattered considerably; and after I had
given the order to cross, I had myself been delayed by a call of
nature. As soon as these terrible portents manifested themselves, I
therefore gave the counter-signal to return to the west side of the
road. This order, however, was already being interfered with by a
powerful current of air rushing along the road and spreading out
fan-wise to the south. A moment later a weird and gigantic shape,
glittering like a newly polished beetle but many million times as
large and rushing along at an inconceivable speed, loomed up from our
left. The speed was such that I hesitate over a comparison that
suggested itself: the speed of a meteorite such as have been known to
fall out of the heavens to the earth.</p>

<p>This monster, whatever it was, animal or heavenly body, was barely
upon us when it was gone again, to the south; and the whole series of
portents: the increasing heavings, the wind, the pulsations, and the
strident swish went through a series of mutations in an opposite
sense, decreasing instead of increasing. As for the wind, nothing
will give so adequate an idea of its force as the statement that, at
the moment of the monster's passing, I--who am no light-weight and
who, even in a hurricane, am held down to the ground by my head--that
even I, I say, was whirled off my feet, lifted high into the air, and
turned round and round, being carried along for seven or eight
hundred antlengths, before I fell down again, in the middle of the
road, rolling over and over many times.</p>

<p>I was stunned; but as soon as I recovered I started back to the
scene of the disaster. Already I was painting to myself what must
have happened; for the terror of the thing had completely unnerved
me; and I was prepared for the worst. Nevertheless I must confess
that this time my imagination proved entirely inadequate to the
facts.</p>

<p>A not inconsiderable part of the remainder of our army had been
killed; but I saw at a glance that the High Command had fared worse.
With a feeling of utter nausea I turned away and emitted the scent of
rally. I trembled at what I might see.</p>

<p>The first ant I saw was Assa-ree; she was as much unnerved as I.
Perhaps the word unnerved is rather mild: we felt annihilated; both
of us could hardly stand; we trembled from head to foot. Yet Assa-ree
had only yesterday vanquished the amazon in single combat!</p>

<p>Behind her, out of still whirling dust, emerged Bissa-tee and
Azte-ca; and these three, besides myself, were all that were left of
the High Command!</p>

<p>Gradually a few hundred soldiers straggled in, all of them
bewildered, many wounded, a few disabled to the point where they
could barely move their limbs. I had to hold on to myself in order
not to surrender to the same sort of despair as Assa-ree. To give
those who survived something to do and thereby time to get over their
first shock, I ordered a count to be taken. Only 1,204 soldiers and
four officers answered the roll-call. I was still hoping that others
would straggle in; but in that hope I was disappointed.</p>

<p>The only one of us who kept her head was Bissa-tee. Having assured
herself that, apart from contusions and abrasions, I was unhurt, she
went off by herself to investigate.</p>

<p>Since I had to readjust all our plans to the altered
circumstances, I gave orders to prepare a small burrow. Somehow I
felt that we could not immediately leave the scene of this disaster;
and since we had to be prepared for similar monsters rushing along
the road, I thought it imperative that we should have a retreat which
offered safety.</p>

<p>While these preparations were going on, the soldiers, still
preparing, from force of habit, a separate burrow for me and my two
associates, I pondered the situation. For that purpose I sought
refuge behind a grassy dry ditch flanking the tarry expanse; and
there I was joined, after a while, by Bissa-tee.</p>

<p>If, at the rally after the disaster, she had still preserved a
measure of her jaunty air, it was now gone. She was profoundly
serious. For a moment she remained motionless; then, as though
despairing of her ability to give me an adequate idea of what she
wished to convey, she touched me with her right antenna on the third
abdominal segment, thereby indicating her desire that I should follow
her.</p>

<p>We went out on the road; and Bissa-tee began to explain to me just
how things had happened. The monster had been moving on four wheels;
this she had observed with the greatest distinctness; there was no
possibility of a mistake. The army had been in a position half-way
beyond and half-way this side of the far pair of wheels; so that the
most central part of it had been crushed. But the High Command had
been exactly in the path of the near pair of wheels. That was the
reason why the disaster had taken such a terrible toll of ourselves.
But she wanted to show me certain details, she added; she despaired
of conveying to me in any other way the extent and the pathos of the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>I followed half unwillingly; and a moment later she was pointing
out what indeed was calculated to make the stoutest heart
tremble.</p>

<p>Sixty-six great scholars, every one a leader in her field; and
collectively perhaps the greatest and most amazing aggregate of
learning that had ever been seen assembled on earth, were reduced to
a greasy smear on a highway! The futility of it all! The utter
senselessness! And, as though still further to emphasize the inanity
of all antly endeavour, Bissa-tee led me forward to show me one such
smear spread in front of the others, detached and isolated from the
rest. Here, a single ant had been caught in the act of trying to
escape: the smear was enormous in size, measuring at least eight
antlengths in width and thirty in length. It was still possible to
distinguish the various parts of the body. To both sides the legs
were flattened out; and the articulations between femur and tibia and
between tibia and tarsus were still recognizable. In front of the
head, the antenn&aelig; stretched away, a quarter of an antlength
wide and six antlengths long, still showing the geniculate joints. I
marvelled at the size of the smear, wondering whose remains these
might be. Once more Bissa-tee touched me; and then she scented a
name. This, then, was what was left of Anna-zee, that storehouse of
botanical knowledge, that fountain of searching philosophy, that
greatest of all sceptics! If such was her end, what, then, was the
use of all antly striving? What the meaning of the thirst for
knowledge and achievement which had burnt in that obese body with the
brightest aspirations on this globe? How much more easily could we
not have spared a hundred soldiers, nay, every last one that
remained! I vowed that, should I ever return to our own blessed
country where such monsters did not exist, I would myself scent her
name on the tree of honour--a vow which, I am glad to be able to say,
I have kept. And to that vow I added another: I had now become the
sole depositary of all the results of her investigations and
speculations on subjects botanical: these I would carefully rehearse
to myself from time to time; and, in the exceedingly improbable event
of my safe return, I would devote a separate scent-tree to her
findings and her often highly ingenious theories, so as to preserve
them for posterity.</p>

<p>Immersed in such thoughts and glowing with a sombre flame of
sadness, I was on the point of turning back when Bissa-tee asked me
once more to follow her. This time she led me to the front of the
huge smear which now represented the flower of what had been the
central squadrons of our army. Here, too, flattened smaller smears
were detached from the main one; and these had a peculiar circular
shape which puzzled me much. Within each of these circular smears
there was the flattened image of an ant that had been crushed in a
peculiar position: with her legs folded and appressed to the body, as
though she had tried to withdraw into the smallest possible
space.</p>

<p>I could not, or perhaps I should say, I dared not explain this
sight to myself, till Bissa-tee cruelly formulated this sentence:
"The pup&aelig; which the carriers released as they were caught and
which, therefore, had rolled ahead of them!" The pup&aelig;! There
was indeed no other explanation of these marks. And their
carriers--such is the philoprogenitiveness of ants--had still thought
of saving them, when they themselves had perhaps already begun to be
crushed by the monster! Perhaps they had even tried to give them an
accelerated sideways motion as they rolled from their jaws. But the
destruction had been too swift.</p>

<p>I did not, at the time, grasp the full significance of this
discovery; nor did Bissa-tee. We simply concluded that parts of the
army, taught by the Rubicundas and the Polyergus, had gone on raids
to provision themselves with portable food. Little as yet did I
fathom the whole depth of Assa-ree's treason; entrusted as she was
with our protection, she had been plotting our utter overthrow.</p>

<p>I signified to Bissa-tee my desire that she keep our discoveries
strictly to herself, so as not to lower the morale of the survivors
still more; and she agreed mournfully, adding that she, at least,
would go on with her task as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>IV</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We remained at this station for only a single day; and then,
though in our state of physical and emotional exhaustion a longer
rest would have been most welcome, I gave orders to proceed, impelled
to do so chiefly by the fact that every now and then one of those
roaring monsters passed along the road, now going north, now south;
and every time our soldiers were thrown into a panic, till I came to
the conclusion that my first duty was to distract their thoughts from
the disaster that had overtaken us. Assa-ree soon recovered from her
despair and grew even more jaunty than she had been before, the
obsequious deference with which she treated me assuming a still more
ironical shading. Plainly, a reckoning with her was approaching; but
I must wait till we had crossed that great river which we had so long
been expecting to find.</p>

<p>For close to a moon we went on by forced marches, and sometimes,
when the weather was warm, we prolonged our forward struggle far into
the night.</p>

<p>Three things kept me from brooding too much on our misfortunes. In
the first place, Azte-ca seemed now to be attracted to me in a closer
friendship; she showed much solicitude for my comfort and conversed
more freely with me. She admitted that, in the past, her ambition to
find the key to the human language had stood in the way of any
intimacy between her and the rest of us; but she had realized, she
said, that without our help and sympathy she was not likely to work
her problems out to an entirely successful issue. She asked for my
advice and sometimes for my assistance. Whenever we spent the night
near a human habitation, she visited it, discussing with me ways and
means and telling me of the progress she was making. Her chief
difficulty arose from the very loudness of man's voice which
prevented her from distinguishing its modulations. I advised her to
coat her ear-drums with many successive applications of saliva till
she was deaf to sounds of ordinary intensity; and when she did this,
she made the most amazing progress.</p>

<p>In the second place, I had been much struck with what we had seen
of our slave-making sisters; and this formed the subject of endless
discussions between myself and Bissa-tee. There were two problems
involved. Firstly that of the line of development through which this
mode of life had arisen among ants; and in the solution of this
problem Bissa-tee showed once more her profound penetration and
unrivalled ingenuity. Again I must refer the student to the special
scent-trees, numbers 734 and 735, in which I have given the details
of her reasoning. While Bissa-tee acknowledged that of the three
great modes of life, the hunting, pastoral, and agricultural modes,
the latter was the highest, making possible a degree of security
which cannot be attained through any other, yet it contained already
the germs of degeneration, evolution splitting up from that point on:
one line leading to the mode of life adopted by ourselves, the Attas,
who devote the energy liberated from the struggle for existence
entirely to the pursuit of intellectual aims; the other line leading
on to the mode of life chosen by the slave-makers, through a
corruption of the instincts making for security of the material life
into instincts demanding the accumulation of property; which
accumulation led back to a military life, for it demanded the
adoption of methods, first of defence, and then of aggression.
Secondly there was the problem of the ultimate phase of this line of
development; and this was the one in which I took a special interest
myself.</p>

<p>In the third place, there was the problem of these tarry roads
which became more and more common as we went east. We had no further
losses from this cause; for now that we knew about the monsters
travelling along these roads we soon learned to avoid them. Whenever
we reached such a structure, a scout was sent to its centre; and if
the slightest vibration was perceptible, we waited; if not, we
proceeded at a run. Bissa-tee's conjecture that the animals
travelling along these roads were enslaved by man was soon confirmed.
They enclose huge hollow spaces, produced probably, similarly to the
air-spaces in the bodies of our queens, by the atrophy of certain
muscular tissues; and into these hollow spaces men insert themselves
when they travel; time and again we had occasion to observe them. As
for the origin of the roads themselves, that problem was also solved
in entire accordance with the theories advanced by our lamented
chemists. One day we actually saw a huge animal of an entirely
different and new shape crawling along such a road; and it was, near
the anal end, provided with an enormous serictery from which a score
or more of thick strands of the tarry substance were spun out; these,
on reaching the ground in a viscously liquid state, promptly spread
out sideways and coalesced, producing a smooth surface which slowly
hardened. As, in a spatial sense, everything about these animals is
colossal, so, in a temporal sense, the hardening of this substance
took an enormous length of time. We had to make a vast detour in
order not to be entangled in the sticky mass.</p>

<p>Nothing else needs to be added with regard to this part of our
march except that, on the twenty-seventh day after the great
disaster, we suddenly found ourselves on the muddy banks of the great
river which we had so long expected to encounter.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>V</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Naturally, this river being one of the most stupendous obstacles
to our progress, we settled down to explore it and to find ways and
means of crossing. It was so wide that we could barely see its far
shores; and its channel was divided by many islands all of which
seemed to be massive and wooded at their upper extremities, whereas,
at their lower ends, they trailed out into long shallows and
sand-banks. The current was sluggish enough and would have permitted
us to cross by means of a living bridge if we had had the ant-power
to make one. As it was, we had to concentrate from the beginning on
other methods of accomplishing the task.</p>

<p>All sorts of ways were proposed: to form a raft and trust to the
current, taking boldly to the water in a mass; to use spiders
floating, at this time of year, on their webs, anchoring one strand
of such a web on the hither bank and forcing the spider to keep on
spinning by following her and frightening her into ever more frantic
efforts; to roll logs into the river and again, bestriding them,
trust to the current. In all which methods we were, in the last
resort, depending on a favourable wind.</p>

<p>Two of them were actually tried. Assa-ree caught spiders and sent
them on their aerial voyage. She had the brilliant idea of releasing
a score of them at the same time, from the outermost tips of the
branches of willow trees growing on our bank, and entangling their
threads into a stout cable upheld by the floating power of twenty
webs at once. She then launched out behind them. But, the threads
being anchored, progress depended entirely on the spinning power of
the spiders; and it was exhausted long before the first island was
reached. Then they came to a stop, suspended over the water; and, the
wind failing, Assa-ree slowly sank down into the muddy flood where
she must have perished had not our workers pulled her out by hauling
the cable in. A few days later, when she had recovered, she set out
on a large chip of wood but found that, weighted down by its load, it
did not offer the wind a sufficient hold and was too much deflected
downstream. To her discomfiture, she landed ignominiously on a
sand-spit of the hither bank.</p>

<p>Thus, in the face of this huge expanse of water, we were delayed
from day to day and at last began to think that we should have to
acknowledge defeat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Azte-ca was not idle and kept going about from one
human habitation to the other. She reported strange things. There
were black men living here; and paler humans of all shadings of
colour between white and black; and it was during this forced delay
that she made her next great discovery: she succeeded in deciphering
human records inscribed on paper with black fluids.</p>

<p>We were just beginning to suffer from the effects of idleness
among the remainder of our troops, while the leaders were exploring
the neighbourhood, when one night Azte-ca returned from a two-days'
absence in a state almost of exaltation but so utterly exhausted that
she could barely move her antenn&aelig;. Yet she managed to convey to
us the idea that our problem was solved. Having grasped as much, both
Bissa-tee and myself urged her to rest and postpone further
communications to the next day.</p>

<p>In the morning, then, she scented to us that she had found a line
of most peculiar structures crossing the river--structures which were
joined to each other by metallic threads apparently spun by enormous
spiders. On the basis of the proportion obtaining between the
thickness of an ordinary spider's web and these metallic threads, she
had calculated the size of these spiders as being many times that of
a horse, the latter being the largest animal hitherto encountered.
She had not seen these spiders, but--such was her obsession by this
time--she had no doubt that they, too, were enslaved by man; for the
more she saw of the latter, the more she stood in awe of his
powers.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee and I were of course very curious to see this marvel: a
spider's web consisting of native copper instead of a glutinous
carbohydrate; but we were also alarmed at Azte-ca's report. Yet we
were willing to attempt almost anything in order to get away from
where we were; it was one of the least favourable stations we had
ever been at; for the ground was so saturated with moisture that we
could not possibly have wintered here, and that terrible winter
season was rapidly approaching now. Something had to be done at
once.</p>

<p>So, early next morning, we prepared for another march; and at noon
we arrived at the spot signalized by Azte-ca. We found the strange
structure to consist of white steel; and it resembled a huge,
four-legged harvest-man or false spider standing on the tips of its
toes. Azte-ca at once climbed up on one of its legs; and, seeing her
so sure of herself, a number of us followed. I venture to say that
the height to which we climbed was not less than a thousand
antlengths; and there, to a framework of nervures, still of steel, we
found fastened large mushroom-shaped bodies of <i>glass</i> around
which these copper cables were wound. To the west, they stretched
away as far as we could see, dipping ultimately below the horizon; to
the east, they reached all the way across the river, looping from
island to island at a dizzy height above the waters.</p>

<p>There we stood, Azte-ca, Bissa-tee, and myself; and behind and
below us the whole army--what was left of it--came clambering up,
with Assa-ree at the head. Assa-ree looked at me with such a Satanic
glance, half ferocious, half grinning; and she had the three of us so
absolutely in her power there that I did not see what else I could
do. I started ahead post-haste and began to cross the river via these
aerial threads. As for the copper, it was strong enough to support
any number of us; but I could not rid myself of the idea that this
was not a spun thread at all: I had a vague feeling that there was
something going on inside that thread; or that in some mysterious way
it was alive. This feeling became stronger as we advanced, I leading,
with Bissa-tee behind me; for the thread began to vibrate and to hum
in the most frightening manner so that we had at last the greatest
difficulty in holding on. This difficulty was enormously increased
when, after an hour or so, a violent wind began to blow from the
south. Below us, the river raised angrily foaming waves; and in order
not to be swept off, we now crawled forward in the shelter afforded
by the thread on its north side. On and on we went; and the thread,
under the ever-rising sun, became intensely hot, till it scorched our
feet.</p>

<p>On and on we went, hour after hour; and then, just as the weather
took an ugly turn, we reached the next steel support where I called a
halt. The wind had blown up huge domed clouds which now obscured the
sun. Convoluted thunderheads pushed north straight overhead, their
inner chambers lighted up by fitful winkings. A hush had fallen over
the landscape; and then, suddenly, like a Polyergus let loose, a
flash of lightning leapt, passing close by us; and the universe shook
with the vicious bark of the thunder. The afternoon light assumed a
lurid shade.</p>

<p>Below us there was the first of a series of islands; and I gave
the signal for a quick descent. Long before we reached solid ground,
the rain fell in torrents; and we had the greatest difficulty in
resisting its wash.</p>

<p>I, Bissa-tee, and Azte-ca had barely touched ground when the world
about us exploded. Behind us, the earth leapt up around one of the
legs of the steel support; Assa-ree was catapulted forward over our
heads; all about, it seemed to hail ants; and even the pebbles of the
beach on which we were, danced. Lashed by the wind and the rain we
stood blinded, unable to realize what was happening. The water,
though pouring down from above, seemed simultaneously to spout up
from every pore of the ground, such was the violence of its rebound.
Within a few seconds rivulets were scoring the soil into the pattern
of miniature mountains and valleys; and we could only stand and hold
on.</p>

<p>This lasted for half an hour before the fury of the storm abated.
Then, the rain slowly subsiding into a warm, steaming drizzle, we had
a chance to breathe once more. But another half hour went by before
we were in a state to investigate.</p>

<p>When we did so, we found that almost one half of the remainder of
our army had been killed. That ghastly flash of lightning had struck
the support of the copper threads; it had fused the quartz pebbles at
the foot of the leg over which we had been descending; and the
intense heat had not only killed, it had shrivelled up five hundred
of our soldiers; Assa-ree and the rest had saved themselves by a
desperate leap.</p>

<p>By this time night was falling; and all we could do, surrounded as
we were by water, was to make for such shelter as some straggling
bushes afforded on the crest of the beach. It turned cold after the
storm; and though we little knew what was ahead of us, we did not
remember ever having passed so miserable a night. I personally do not
think I could have survived had not Bissa-tee and Azte-ca insisted on
covering me with their bodies.</p>

<p>But there was no way out of it: when morning came, we had to go
on. Again we climbed up to one of those copper threads and proceeded.
It was a cold raw day; there was little wind; but the sky remained
overcast.</p>

<p>All day we struggled along; and if yesterday the heat of the
thread had caused discomfort, today the cold caused misery. On and on
we went, hour after hour, passing island after island below; and yet,
when night fell, we were still far from the goal. Owing to the
intense cold which invaded our bodies from contact with the metal,
our progress became slower and slower. We could not stop to rest, for
that would have meant certain death; we could never have held on; we
should have fallen into the icy flood below where we should have been
swallowed by the fishes which we had had ample opportunity to
observe.</p>

<p>If it had not been for this cold, we should have finished this
trip about midnight; as it was, we travelled on well into the next
day; and when at last the task was accomplished and we descended to
the ground, there was not one of us who would have wished to go on.
Everyone, on the other hand, would have taken food of almost any
description, be it ever so nauseating.</p>

<p>Yet there was one thought which sustained at least the three of
us: we had accomplished an almost super-formicarian task. Who could,
after this, say that there are things from which formicarian
ingenuity and formicarian enterprise must shrink? Who, that Attas
could ever be daunted?</p>

<p>As for food, the small remnant of our army was plentifully
provided: in the course of the wind-storm the river had disgorged
innumerable fishes, large and small; and we knew that our soldiers
did not despise such fare. What Assa-ree did, I do not know; but she
recovered in a remarkably short time. Bissa-tee, Azte-ca, and myself
managed to find some enormous fungi growing like shelves on dead
trees; but we consumed barely enough to restore our strength, they
were so unpalatable. If I looked in any way like Bissa-tee, I must
have been a sorry sight.</p>

<p>So we three were not anxious to make a long stay; and on the third
morning I issued the order to proceed. I had half expected trouble;
but all went smoothly. It is true, there was in the bearing of the
soldiers a subtle something resembling insolence; but there was no
outright mutiny. I was prepared for anything; for I had now also come
to the conclusion that the army was henceforth an encumbrance; but
for the moment it was probably best to wait and see.</p>

<p>I began to despair of the very possibility of reaching the
Atlantic seaboard this fall, the sixth since our departure from home.
Five years were the average lifetime of all but the queen among
Attas; and I was now twice that age. Even Bissa-tee and Azte-ca began
to show their years; and the only member of the High Command who
looked as young as ever was Assa-ree. The trip home, I reflected,
would take two years; I felt that I still had it in me to live
through such a term; but I also felt that I could not leave our
geographical exploration of the continent unfinished. Another year. .
. It was almost more than I could face with equanimity; and if
anything happened to Bissa-tee and Azte-ca?</p>

<p>The burden of responsibility seemed almost too great to be borne;
and Bissa-tee felt and sympathized with me. Only Azte-ca was blindly
pushing on: she was now entirely preoccupied with man and his works.
She was haunted by the insane idea that man had perhaps surpassed
even Attas in the development of his mental powers; and she was bound
to find out. I wished to indulge her, if only for the purpose of
convincing her of her error.</p>

<p>But, after another month or so of ceaseless struggle, fate took a
hand and decided all our questions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>VI</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I had at last given in and accepted the fact that we had to remain
in this northern country for another year. The season was beginning
to be too inclement to proceed when we came upon a location which
seemed favourable for wintering.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should mention that every now and then we had, of late,
met with friendly tribes of minute ants who lived a very precarious
life within human habitations; and occasionally we found among them
some who, to our amazement, had travelled widely and seen much of the
world. They laughed at us when they heard that we were marching; they
never did. From their descriptions we concluded at first that they
made use of those monstrous animals which we had seen on the tarry
roads; but it seemed there were still other ways and means of
utilizing human contrivance. These little ants told us of what they
called space-machines. At any rate, the stories which reached us
mostly through Azte-ca had given me hope that perhaps we should
winter in a human city; for we heard much of a huge hominary built
around certain inlets of the eastern sea; and what we were told about
this hominary made me think that it must be a place very different
from the human farm. But it so happened, much to our ultimate
advantage as it turned out, that we were caught by a wintry spell at
a point far removed from any human habitation.</p>

<p>We arranged for what we thought would be our winter quarters. A
small but deep formicary was excavated in a steep hillside protected
by a fringe of trees. It held only one chamber for Bissa-tee,
Azte-ca, and myself; and in addition there were four fungus-gardens.
Fortunately, there were still a score or so of carriers left,
preserving pellets of fungus-hyph&aelig; in their infrabuccal
chambers; and fortunately, too, there were, in that fringe of trees,
a few Gleditschias which supplied us, in their leaves, with a
substratum suitable for growing them. At the depth at which our
gardens lay the ground was still warm enough to ensure a growth
sufficient for our needs. A second, larger formicary was dug for the
remainder of the army, considerably lower down that hillside; and it
was stocked with the wingless bodies of grasshoppers and crickets
paralysed by the sting of wasps; for this hillside was a favourite
haunt of these insects.</p>

<p>When we had been living here for some ten or twelve days, fretting
but resigned, the weather changed again, and a spell of marvellous
mellowness succeeded the wintry winds of the last fortnight. All our
ants, accustomed now, for more than five years, to a wandering life,
became restless again; and it was quite a task to keep single small
groups from straying off by themselves.</p>

<p>But not in our formicaries only did life revive; the whole
hillside swarmed again with insects and finally with ants.</p>

<p>I was naturally reluctant, now we had resigned ourselves, to
sacrifice the preparations for wintering which had been made,
especially since fungus-hyph&aelig; were beginning to be scarce. Nor
could we know just how long this summery weather would last. Already
we saw, in the leafy domes of the trees below us, indications of a
new colour to come: that colour which in these latitudes precedes the
fall of the foliage. But one afternoon, the air being exceptionally
warm, a series of events began which settled my troubles once for
all.</p>

<p>A large army of Polyergus overran our formicary. Bissa-tee,
Azte-ca, and myself were lazily basking in the sun near the entrance
to our little burrow when Bissa-tee gave the alarm. We dived down
into our chamber above the fungus-gardens; and Bissa-tee closed its
entrance with her head. Hundreds of these dreaded and murderous
amazons swarmed in and out of our burrow; not one seemed to suspect
our hiding-place, for they brushed past without stopping, never even
touching Bissa-tee's head; and then they left us. A hurried
investigation showed that they had done only inconsiderable damage to
our gardens. They had torn the leaf-sponges open; but they had not
carried them off nor sprayed them with their poisonous excretions.
They were after eggs and pup&aelig;, Bissa-tee concluded laconically;
and with that she led the way to the open.</p>

<p>The Polyergus were just swarming into the second formicary; and we
saw some of the fiercer of our soldiers, led by Assa-ree, engaged in
a desperate battle against the raiders who, however, had come in such
numbers that Assa-ree's defence barely delayed them.</p>

<p>As we appeared at the opening of our gallery, we were just in time
to witness the whole proceeding. It was only a very few moments
before the first of those who had entered returned. We had expected
to see them carrying fragments of those orthoptera that had been
stored as winter-food for the soldiers; but to our amazement they
carried nothing of the kind. They carried eggs. Eggs? Eggs. And these
eggs were of a shape and size which no ant native to these parts
could have produced. There were only two nations known to us that
could have produced them: Atta Gigantea and Eciton Hamatum; and we
soon saw that there were hundreds and thousands of them; for the
Polyergus who, by the way, were fiercer and more elegant, both in
colouring and build, than any we had so far seen, promptly carried
these eggs away and then returned for more. The coming and going
lasted for half an hour.</p>

<p>In the meantime, east of the entrance, the battle was waging.
Assa-ree performed marvels of valour; but her small band of helpers
was rapidly dwindling; the Polyergus had distinctly the upper jaw;
the merest touch of the tips of their mandibles pierced the armour of
our soldiers; and soon the hillside was strewn with their corpses;
before the raid was over, there were hundreds of them to the enemy's
scores. It seemed that only Assa-ree had both the science and the
strength to slay her assailants.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee was immensely puzzled; more so than I; for I had never
told her what, months ago, had been revealed to me by the officer on
the Pogonomyrmex disk. Yet it was Bissa-tee who connected this sight
of the eggs with another puzzling discovery which we had made
together. "The pup&aelig;!" she scented suddenly. "What pup&aelig;?"
I asked absent-mindedly. "On the first tar-road," she replied. "Don't
you remember?"</p>

<p>I remembered indeed. With a sickening feeling I realized the whole
depth of Assa-ree's treason; and I could barely refrain from sending
at once absolute and final execution down that hillside. In fact, I
took several steps forward but was held back by my companions. They
were right, of course. No matter how treasonable Assa-ree's conduct
had been, her condign punishment must wait till the last Polyergus
had departed. Nor did we have long to wait; and as soon as I was sure
that no living enemy remained on the premises, I summoned my two
companions to accompany me.</p>

<p>Assa-ree had disappeared into the crater of her burrow, exhibiting
all the signs of bewilderment and despair. We took our stand on the
north side of the entrance, forty antlengths above the upper lip.
Azte-ca and Bissa-tee were visibly nervous; to re-assure them, I
divulged for the first time the great secret that I was carrying a
pellet of the royal perfume of instant death which I held ready to
use at any moment; and then I gave the great scent of summons.</p>

<p>I had expected mutiny and revolt; but Assa-ree promptly obeyed,
raising her head within the hollow of the entrance. Her enquiry,
however, as to what was wanted was sullen and defiant. She did not
care what happened to her.</p>

<p>Holding the pellet ready between labrum and tongue, I launched
forth into what, I flatter myself, was one of the greatest pieces of
forensic eloquence ever delivered by an Atta. I regretted even then
the untimely loss of Adver-tee who alone would have been able to
record it in full for the instruction and delight of future ages. As
it is, I can give only the barest abstract.</p>

<p>I went back to Assa-ree's early life in the formicary at home and
summarized the rumours that had been current about her; and next I
mentioned the circumstances which had seemed suspicious to me during
the early years of our expedition. All this, I told her, I had
disregarded because her unrivalled courage and resourcefulness had
seemed to outweigh whatever might be said against her. But, I went
on, since she was now facing the most solemn moment of her life, I
asked her to answer my questions with absolute truthfulness: were the
soldiers with whom she had started out without exception true
Attas?</p>

<p>She darkened; and then, true to her nature, she answered boldly,
"They were Ecitons."</p>

<p>"And the recruits enrolled at the isthmus?"</p>

<p>"Ecitons."</p>

<p>The frankness, I went on, with which she had answered these
questions did honour to her soldierly character. I next referred to
her methods of foraging which were unworthy of any Atta; but I
conceded that they had been most convenient for the expedition and
therefore should not serve as the basis of an indictment. I was
coming, I said, to the more important points. We had proof of the
fact that she had used the carriers of the army for the
transportation of pup&aelig;. Where had they come from?</p>

<p>They were carried, she evaded, in order to maintain the morale of
the troops. Was it not well-known to me that ants of a less exalted
kind than ours were ever willing to fight in defence of their
broods?</p>

<p>That, too, I supposed, was the reason why she had this day been
detected in harbouring thousands of eggs in her burrow?</p>

<p>It was. Though incidentally they were meant to recruit the army in
spring.</p>

<p>Would she tell me, I asked at last, whence these eggs and
pup&aelig; had come?</p>

<p>At that she saw she had marched straight into a trap. Yet she
recovered her composure in a moment. She issued entirely from the
crater and now stood in full view. I divined her purpose: she was
giving the few of her most trusted soldiers who remained a chance to
come close to the lip of the crater; I saw a dozen claws reaching up
to its edge; they were ready to mow us down with their flashing jaws.
Then she raised herself proudly and answered, "I am an
ergatogyne."</p>

<p>At this Bissa-tee moved. I knew her favourite theory that all the
types transitional between the three chief castes, the male, the
female, and the ergate or worker, were pathological; and no doubt she
was on the point of signifying as much when I restrained her.</p>

<p>Was it, or was it not, a fact, I went on, that she was not so much
an ergatogyne as an abortive queen?</p>

<p>"I have never been winged," she said.</p>

<p>I did not know; but I professed myself profoundly interested. At
any rate I did know that her eggs produced all normal castes and
thence concluded that she was fertilized?</p>

<p>What if she was?</p>

<p>It explained her ambitions, I replied. What could be her purpose
in carrying with her recorders who were in possession of all the
important results of the expedition?</p>

<p>She had thought fit to make sure that these results, secured
chiefly through the protection she had given us, should not perish if
we perished.</p>

<p>And she had felt sure that we were going to perish, had she
not?</p>

<p>To this she did not condescend to reply; but I saw her move her
antenn&aelig; so as to verify the fact that her followers were
ready.</p>

<p>I should now, I went on, summarize my indictment by revealing to
her those plans which she thought were entirely hidden from me. In
the first place, she was not a true Atta herself but a hybrid. In the
second place, she was fertilized by an Eciton male wherever she might
have encountered him. In the third place she aspired to the throne or
to a position within the monarchy which could enable her to hold even
the crown in subjection. The former two points, while less terrible
things had among Attas before this been thought deserving a sentence
of death, did not dishonour her personal character; but the latter
constituted treason. If she aspired to the throne, why, then, it
might be asked, had she come on this expedition? That, too, I was
prepared to explain. She had admitted that she was an ergatogyne; and
I was willing to prove that she was fertilized. Physiologically,
therefore, she was able to assume all the functions of a queen; and,
interpreting many puzzling and suspicious circumstances observed in
the past by the light shed upon them by recent discoveries, I was
prepared to show that she had exercised these functions even before
we had left the maternal formicary; for the carriers taken from that
formicary for the army had been her daughters. But she knew that no
Attiine nation would ever consent to be ruled by an ant not a true
queen unless that aspirant had claims to glory and distinction
eclipsing the exaltation of royal birth. These claims she had meant
to establish by first aiding our explorations and then depriving us
and even our memories of their results. For she must not think for a
moment that I was ignorant of the fate she reserved for ourselves.
Yet, what I had resolved upon was not the outcome of self-regarding
fear: it was what the danger of the state at home demanded. As a
matter of fact, I wound up in a stinging peroration, the thought of
that state being ruled by an ergatogyne could be borne: but in my
opinion she was not an ergatogyne but a
gyn&aelig;coid.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p> </p>

<p><sup>3</sup> An ergatogyne is produced by the physiological
degradation of a queen; a gyn&aelig;coid by the excess development of
a worker or ergate. The expression means, therefore, that Assa-ree
had risen from the ranks. Apparently, among ants, too, genius ranks
below birth. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>At this Assa-ree could no longer contain herself; it appeared to
her a fortuitous insult; and in that rage which can deprive even an
ant of her self-control, she issued the scent of attack. Her few
adherents surged up through the opening behind her. She herself
advanced, flashing her scissor jaws; but I was ready.</p>

<p>I, too, advanced, so as not to expose Bissa-tee and Azte-ca to any
side-thrust of the deadly perfume which was already sending its
murderous rays straight ahead.</p>

<p>A moment later, just before she came within reach of me, Assa-ree
reared up in the typical attitude of one stricken by Her Majesty's
most potent perfume; and as she did so, those following her also
stood up on their hind-feet and then broke down. More and more ants
followed them, and all went to instant death. Knowing as I did from
former experience how persistent the perfume and its effect must be,
I at once retreated, giving my two associates the signal to follow me
promptly.</p>

<p>We climbed up the hillside to the crater of our burrow and thence
looked back. There were still a few ants issuing from the lower
formicary; and every single one shared the fate of her leader till
the whole remainder of the army had perished. Not one was left of
that proud body which more than five years ago had started out except
Bissa-tee, Azte-ca, and myself.</p>

<p>What I had done had been done under the dictates of state-craft. I
venture to say that no ruling caste among ants or any other order of
animals would have hesitated doing the same. Yet, somehow, when it
was done, the world seemed empty.</p>

<p>We retired to our chamber underground; and there Bissa-tee
relieved her mind of all her misgivings.</p>

<p>What, she asked, if in future we should need a formicary? Our jaws
were not adapted for digging. What if we were attacked? Azte-ca, it
was true, was still nimble enough to defend herself. But we?</p>

<p>I did not answer at once. These and similar questions had occurred
to me, too. But such perplexities could not outweigh the danger in
which we were so long as Assa-ree lived.</p>

<p>Azte-ca was not interested in such things. She accepted what I had
done because it was done and could not be undone in any case. Why
waste time on it, then? She was impatient to be gone; and her
impatience helped Bissa-tee and myself to get over the first shock of
so radical a change in the conditions under which the future must be
lived. It was for that very reason that I did not at once give her
the permission which she asked for. She fidgeted about in evident
embarrassment. For a little while Bissa-tee and I enjoyed this game;
we even asked her certain questions; but her answers were confused
and so much at cross purposes that we had to laugh; and when she had
thus helped us to overcome the constraint laid upon us by the
solemnity of the occasion, I turned to her at last, signifying that
she might be off to her beloved humans. And she shot out of our
formicary in such a precipitous way that Bissa-tee and I were highly
amused. She did not return for two full days.</p>

<p>I went out to make sure that the perfume of death could not be
blown our way; in a dead calm it would travel downhill, of course,
since it was heavier than air. There was no wind.</p>

<p>When Bissa-tee and I were alone in our chamber at last, we settled
down to a freer and less worried rest than we had had for many a
month; and my good friend let herself go and rumbled along in the
most comfortable way, speculating on what had happened.</p>

<p>"I admire you," she said; "but on what grounds do you justify your
verdict?"</p>

<p>"On the grounds of necessity."</p>

<p>She asscented. "What is justice? Take this case. Treason? Assa-ree
could not help herself. She was what she was. You called her a
hybrid; and I believe you were right. Could she help that? Is the
accident of birth to be made the basis of moral condemnation? I have
my doubts about her being a gyn&aelig;coid, by the way. I don't
believe that any excess development of the ergate will ever enable
her to become capable of fertilization except in the lowest orders of
ants, the Ponerines perhaps, in which the differentiation of castes
has not yet reached any high degree. But even if she was an
ergatogyne, she was unique in Attiine experience. Ergatogynes, too,
occur as a regular thing only with ants of the lower orders. Be that
as it may; she could not help herself. If she was an ergatogyne, it
was certainly her fate to seek fertilization; and I defy any perfect
female to remain a virgin when she is courted by an expert male. The
very hybridity of her sexual union would in my view rather excuse her
than aggravate what you called her crime. If her union had been
adelphogamous, she must have done the courting herself."</p>

<p>Little as I was inclined to argue the point--for I was
surrendering to the comfortable feeling of being for once out of
danger--I could not refrain from throwing in, "It may have been
adelphogamous at that; she was half Eciton herself."</p>

<p>"So you say," Bissa-tee went on; "so you say; and perhaps you are
right. But that does not solve the problem either; it merely removes
the difficulty further back in time. I still disagree; I can still
not acknowledge that what you have done is justice."</p>

<p>"Justice? I do not call it justice. I call it expediency; it was
she or we, that is all."</p>

<p>"Quite," Bissa-tee agreed. "If you put it on that basis, there is
nothing else to be said. But a higher being, if such there is, might
question whether she or we had more right to survive."</p>

<p>I was nearly asleep by this time; but I still managed to murmur,
"My dear Bissa-tee, justice is not a question of right but of
might."</p>

<p>"Ah," Bissa-tee asscented. "Now you are scenting something. And .
. ."</p>

<p>That was the last I perceived, for I was sound asleep; and though
even in my dreams I remained conscious that Bissa-tee had been
thoroughly aroused and was holding forth at the top of her
scent-glands, I did not grasp any longer what it was she was
propounding; nor did I want to. For the moment I felt as though I did
not have a care in the world.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>VII</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I must, now, very briefly, unfold certain speculations of mine;
for I wish to wind up what is known and inferred about slave-making
ants before I proceed to the strangest of all our adventures, namely,
our life among men of a city.</p>

<p>By the comparison of Pogonomyrmex Occidentalis, Formica Rubicunda,
and the various tribes of Polyergus I seemed to have arrived at a
very definite though incomplete line of development. Perhaps I
should, instead of Pogonomyrmex Occidentalis, have mentioned
Dorymyrmex Pyramicus, for the latter species is really the one in
which the slave-making instincts take their inception. These little
ants live, as I have mentioned, in burrows placed within the cleared
disks or even on the flank of the mound erected by Pogonomyrmex; and
they provide their sustenance by relieving single harvesters of the
booty they are bringing in. If we consider this as the beginning of
slavery, its origin is clearly to be looked for in piracy.</p>

<p>Now true slavery may be of two kinds, but one of them is
practically unknown among ants, whereas man has both. One of these
two kinds is characterized chiefly by the loss of personal freedom on
the part of the slave. The slave-maker uses her superior powers to
force the slaves to perform tasks which are uncongenial and irksome
to herself; and the slave, confined to such tasks, works unwillingly
and must be restrained from the full use of her powers. This type of
slavery is very common among men. The other kind cloaks a relation
which is originally similar under the form of symbiosis; and it is
not as dangerous and degrading, in the long run, to the slave as to
the master; for it produces, in the latter, a physiological
degeneration which makes it actually impossible for the master to
live apart from her slaves; the slaves acquiesce, for any sort of
symbiosis is apt to produce a state of mind to which this symbiosis
appears as the natural order. The masters, on the other hand, develop
powers which, though valueless for the purpose of sustaining life,
yet enable them to render certain apparent services to the slaves,
f.i., to defend them against their enemies.</p>

<p>While, therefore, in the case of the Rubicunda, the keeping of
slaves seems to be the by-product of simple piracy, the Polyergus ant
represents the perfect phase of a slave-keeping state. The masters
are no longer able to attend to the simplest tasks of their lives:
they cannot even eat by themselves. Even the power of finding food
which is readily available seems to be lost. They can live on honey;
but we had seen them, crazed with hunger, swarming all over a hive of
bees; and they did not notice that all they needed to do was to lick
the honey up. That, physiologically, they were able to do so was
proved by the fact that one of these valiant fighters happened to
slip, head foremost, into a honey cell; and, the food thus having
been accidentally brought into contact with her tongue, she promptly
gorged herself. Much less are they able to excavate their
formicaries. Their mandibles are hard and brittle and, as we had
reason to know, eminently adapted for piercing the armour of an
enemy; but they were utterly unfit for the ruder task of struggling
with rock and soil. This fact makes them dependent on alien races
even in the establishment of their formicaries. For, while the
Rubicundas could simply invade an alien nest and put queen and
workers to the jaw in order to raise the broods they found, no
Polyergus could possibly raise larv&aelig; and thus train a band of
slaves for herself. There is only one procedure open to the young
Polyergus queen when she invades the nest of her slave-species. It is
well known that, when such an intruding queen succeeds in
establishing herself on the back of the queen of the invaded nest,
the workers will leave her alone. Thus she has time, while tolerated,
to acquire the nest-odour; and as soon as she has done so, she can
devote all her energies to the congenial task of sawing off her
protectress' head; and when this task is completed, she takes the
place of that unfortunate potentate. Figuratively, the same procedure
is adopted in many of the organizations of man, especially the
political ones; and though we never witnessed the thing among
Polyergus ants, we may well draw a conclusion from analogy. From the
beginning the Polyergus queen is dependent on the good will of her
slaves who raise the broods, first of their own, then of the alien
kind. Still, as the Polyergus colony becomes established in a Fusca
or Pallidefulva nest, it assumes its own proper functions; it brings
in the broods of other colonies, partly for food, partly for the
purpose of preserving the race of the slaves.</p>

<p>This leaves the development incomplete; and since our observations
on ants were at this point to come to an end, owing to the
extraordinary events to be related in the following chapter,
speculation must take the place of observation; and again that
speculation with regard to ants is confirmed by certain things of
which we were informed as being prevalent among men, especially among
their royal families and what they call their plutocracy.</p>

<p>I must anticipate. When at last we were able to decipher man's
records, we found in them reports of man's observations on ants which
would go far towards confirming my own conclusions were it not for
one single thing, namely, that, in these human records, assertions
are made which it is impossible for an ant gifted with reason and
critical faculties to accept--a fact which would seem to discredit
all his so-called science. These observations on slave-making ants
purported to have been made in a far country across the seas to the
east. Since in this ocean islands are known to exist, this subterfuge
might still have passed if, in certain other human records,
geographical ones, distances and dimensions had not been given. Thus
this country which they call Europe was said to be over 3,000 miles
from our own continent, across the sea--or about four hundred million
antlengths--a distance which certainly no terrestrial mammal can
swim. But what is much more important, the orbit of the earth around
the sun and the path it describes in its swing around the moon
postulate an entirely smooth surface on the far side of the globe,
such as can be furnished only by an unbroken hydro-hemisphere. From
what knowledge I gained of human nature, my conjecture is that this
so-called continent of Europe, and two or three other continents as
well, is simply an invention of a human caste, the merchants, who
claim that certain goods they "sell"--or exchange for other
goods--are brought from these far countries overseas--goods which are
in reality, of course, produced right at home--in order to enhance
their value. This explanation is in such close accord with human
nature that, to any ant acquainted with man as we became acquainted
with him, it would carry <i>prima-facie</i> conviction even if man's
assertions were not flatly contradicted by the unanimous conclusions
of our formicarian geographers and astronomers. The fact, therefore,
that my speculations about the final evolution of slave-making ants
is confirmed by man constitutes the one circumstance which makes me
hesitate in affirming their unconditional collusiveness.</p>

<p>But I must propound them, nevertheless, in order not to leave the
present chapter incomplete in a purely scientific sense.</p>

<p>The most striking thing about any race of slave-making ants is
undoubtedly to be looked for in the methods employed in order to
found a colony. The slave-making queen grafts herself, as it were, on
an already existing colony of the slaves. Only then does she proceed
to lay eggs from which the three castes of her own kind are produced.
Her own workers or soldiers, as far as the ordinary functions of life
are concerned, are from the beginning entirely dependent on the
slaves with this one exception that, as the colony grows, they forage
for them. Now let this slave species be of an aggressive kind easily
able to support itself, and the slave-making workers or soldiers can
obviously be dispensed with. But it is an axiom universally accepted
by biological science that organs which are not needed first become
rudimentary and finally disappear; and this holds good not only for
the individual organism but for the social organism as well. Applying
this principle to the compound colony of slaves and masters, we can
draw only one conclusion, namely, that the slave-making workers or
soldiers will disappear; and finally a state of affairs will be
reached in which the progeny of the slave-making queen will consist
exclusively of perfect males and females who exist for one purpose
only, i.e., the propagation of their own caste and who, in every
other function of life, are entirely dependent upon their slaves.
But, since the generations of the slaves are never renewed, neither
by natural propagation nor by capture, the end of any colony that
adopts the slave-making queen is, from that moment on, in sight.
According to man, this state of affairs is actually reached in
mythical Europe by certain species which he calls Anergates or
workerless ants. It is not without interest for our knowledge of man
that, in these fictions, he is just sagacious enough to postulate an
exceedingly small size for the males and females of these Anergates;
but not sufficiently so to arrive, from analogy, at the exactly
opposite result. I suppose the reasoning, if such it can be called,
on which he bases his own conclusion is as follows. Since the slave
or host species of such degenerate slave-makers must be able to look
after their own provisioning, they are apt to be of greater size than
the slave-makers; and especially their males and queens are larger,
the latter being perhaps even so-called macrogynes or giants. If that
is the case, there is a momentary advantage to them in the adoption
of these parasitic queens who are supposed to be minute and therefore
require less feeding; and the slaves are of a sufficiently low
mentality to be unable to forecast their own racial extinction as a
result of their policy; for we must not forget that, in order to
explain this hypothetic state of affairs, man must postulate that the
queen of the slaves be killed by her own workers, the slave-making
queen or parasite being, on his own premises, unequal to such a
task.</p>

<p>Man himself, at least if we may trust his own records to that
extent, which would be doubtful if they remained unconfirmed by our
conclusions, has castes which live thus parasitically; but these
parasites, contrary to what he postulates with regard to ants, are
enormous in size and over-developed to the point where their organs
become useless to them, not from atrophy but from hypertrophy.
Needless for me to do my students' thinking for them; they will, from
that, be able to draw the proper inference. With this hint, then, I
will abandon this speculative glance into the realms of the
unobserved.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I was freed of the danger of Assa-ree's proximity; but I still had
much to worry me; and I fully realized that whatever we might
undertake henceforth would be in the nature not only of a dangerous
but a desperate enterprise; and Bissa-tee shared that conviction.</p>

<p>We were both in this frame of mind when, early on the third
morning after her departure, Azte-ca returned in a state of complete
physical exhaustion. I was on the point of administering to her a
minimal dose of the perfume of royal favour in order to put her to
sleep; for it seemed to me that she needed nothing so badly as a
complete rest. She, on the other hand, would not hear of anything of
the kind; she urged us in the most insistent way to load up with
fungus-hyph&aelig; and to follow her. The greatest of all our
adventures, she scented, was ahead of us, provided we did not delay.
We wanted to ask questions but she waved them aside. There would be
time for all that. Just now action was needed.</p>

<p>She set both example and pace. She completely despoiled one of our
fungus-gardens, tearing it apart and selecting the innermost and
tenderest hyph&aelig; which she rolled into a ball. This ball she
pressed and pressed, turning it over and over, till it was small and
compact enough to be pushed, with our help, into her infrabuccal
chamber. This done, she at once proceeded to despoil a second
fungus-garden for Bissa-tee who entered into the spirit of the thing
with gusto. A dozen times Bissa-tee and myself judged that the ball
was large enough; but she insisted in her vivid and dramatic way that
a zoologist could swallow and carry a larger one. I will anticipate
and state right here that, though we succeeded in inserting the ball
as it was when she declared herself satisfied into Bissa-tee's
infrabuccal chamber, it remained there to the day of her death which,
strange to say, was caused by starvation while food aplenty was
stored below her mouth whence it could not be removed without a
surgical operation, so tightly was it wedged in. Next, Azte-ca wanted
to roll a third ball for myself; but I pointed out to her that my
infrabuccal chamber was already filled with the three perfume
pellets. Hers being a single-track mind, this put her quite out of
countenance for the moment; and, becoming conscious of her extreme
fatigue, she squatted down, doubling her legs under her body.</p>

<p>But this lapse lasted only for moments. She rose again and turned
to me, asking me to surrender the leadership to her for the space of
seven days. "If you do," she added, "I undertake to place you in a
human habitation where you will not be offended with any of the
cruder aspects of human life and where we all shall be comfortable
throughout the winter. As far as I can see, mine is the only plan
that can save our lives."</p>

<p>I glanced at Bissa-tee who, by this time, was catching the
infection of excitement from Azte-ca. She winked at me; and I
conscented.</p>

<p>Whereupon Azte-ca promptly led the way. We travelled all day.
Fortunately, the mild weather still held though I seemed to discern
the signs of a coming change. Most of our day's progress was in the
margin of an ordinary human road which, from the ever-increasing
traffic we concluded to be one leading to some human centre. Towards
evening, however, having covered some 700,000 antlengths, Azte-ca,
now reduced to a state in which her motions were purely automatic,
signalled to us to remain behind and to wait till she returned.</p>

<p>It was many hours before we saw her again; Orion had risen in the
east; and the night was far advanced though by no means dark, for the
moon shone brightly, and the sky was dusted over with stars.
Altogether, Bissa-tee and myself enjoyed the interval, for the
weather was fine.</p>

<p>Azte-ca was not alone when she returned; with her were four small,
very pretty ants whose bright, shining eyes scanned us curiously.
They were tremendously impressed with our size; yet they were too
well-bred to stare at us; and it amused me to watch them as they
tried to examine us without appearing to do so. Meanwhile, Azte-ca
told us that these friends of hers had come from a human city
millions of antlengths to the east, in fact, the chief human city of
the continent; and they had done so by utilizing what they called a
human invention to which they were willing to introduce us. This was
the first time that we met with this scent "invention" as applied to
human beings. We ants seek for discoveries rather than inventions;
but it is characteristic of human perversity to prefer to invent
things: I have already intimated that they invent whole continents.
However, both Bissa-tee and myself signalized our willingness to be
saved further marching; but, we added, even though the whole of the
human world might be entirely imaginary, we did not care to be turned
into human inventions ourselves; for we had work to do, and we meant
to do it. One of our new little friends assured us that, while there
might be discomforts, there would be no danger of our disappearing;
just as an ant had, at one time, invented a time-machine, so man had
invented a space-machine. You entered a large chamber; you were
shaken a bit; and when you left the chamber, you were somewhere
else.</p>

<p>All this sounded so absurd that both Bissa-tee and I laughed; but
Azte-ca was almost offended; perhaps she feared we might at the
eleventh hour refuse to follow her leadership. We raised no
difficulty, however; we were only too curious ourselves.</p>

<p>We asked our little friends, great admirers of man, to lead the
way; and for the rest of the night we struggled along, using our
legs. But towards morning we arrived in a human town where all was
still quiet; and having crossed a not inconsiderable part of it, we
reached a wide open space traversed by pairs of steel-bands from
eight to ten antlengths high. At the east end of this open space
stood a number of huge, rectangular, wooden parallelepipeda on wheels
which in turn rested on the steel-bands mentioned. As we made for
them, we discovered that they were hollow and thence concluded that
they were structures similar to the aphid tents of the pastoral ants.
I will confess that, when I saw them, I was profoundly sceptical as
to the truth of what our little friends had told us about them. They
might be built by humans; in fact, they probably were; but as to
their being space-machines in the sense in which our venerable
Etsch-Dschie had, as Azte-ca had put it, invented the time-machine, I
could not yet believe it: I remembered too well the endless
discussions as to whether that time-machine had been real or
imaginary.</p>

<p>However, from the open door of one of these chambers a twisted
cable was hanging down; and our friends promptly climbed it, we
following in their wake. The inside was not a pleasant place; it was
covered with a litter of debris, like a many-years-old kitchen midden
of harvesting ants. Azte-ca gave a single glance around and, looking
at one of the little ants for confirmation that this was the place,
promptly went to sleep in a corner. Bissa-tee and myself, seeing that
our little friends were about to depart, took a courteous leave from
them, thanked them for having gone to the trouble, and, a moment
later, were left alone.</p>

<p>We waited for hours and hours before anything happened; then
suddenly a great shouting arose outside, unmistakably human; and a
few minutes later the enormous doors were shut. Another half hour
went by before, with a rumble like that of an earthquake and a great
puffing like that of a snorting mammal, but a million times as loud,
something passed outside. We saw nothing, but I must report that
Bissa-tee trembled. Suddenly we were both violently thrown off our
feet; and Azte-ca rolled over half a dozen times without awaking.
Then a strident whistling noise; and the whole structure came to life
with a series of deafening clankings. From now on and for several
days during which we lost track of the passage of time, that chamber
did not again come to rest except for short periods occurring at
irregular intervals of several hours. The floor of our chamber
vibrated and leapt in the most amazing way, in all three directions
at once, forward and backward, right and left, and upward and
downward; so that we kept rolling and pitching about till we were
sick. What made it worse was that these motions were every now and
then complicated by adventitious jumps of a quite unimaginable
violence. We came to the conclusion that the chamber must be alive
after all and that it was trying to escape from its fetters.</p>

<p>Azte-ca slept for three days before she awoke. Meanwhile, we had
more than once tried to escape but without success. Smaller ants
could have squeezed through various cracks around the door; but we
were fairly caught; and from the moment on when Azte-ca woke up, she
restrained us from our endeavours, assuring us that all we were going
through was perfectly normal. I replied that, no matter how general
insanity might be among humans, it could never be called normal so
long as there remained a single sane ant in the world.</p>

<p>As I said, we lost track of the passage of time; and when, after
what seemed an eternity, that chamber came to rest without starting
again while we were in it, we all three went to sleep from utter
exhaustion; and I have no means of telling how long we slept. This
sleep was finally disturbed by a sensation of intense cold; and after
another half day or so we were roused by a most terrific noise
accompanied by a renewed trembling of the floor; simultaneously an
icy draught swept over us; and wet flakes of snow settled all about
and even on our backs. I was at once convinced, from the quality of
the air, that we were at the seaboard if not actually on the sea.</p>

<p>I was on the point of issuing a command when Azte-ca anticipated
me, insisting that she was in charge. We left the chamber by dropping
down from the edge of its floor where the door had been; it was
wonderful to have the solid earth underfoot again; but the air was
like a threat of death; and the ground was covered with a mixture of
liquid and frozen water which chilled our limbs to the flesh.</p>

<p>It was night; and all about were amazing sights. We were on a sort
of jetty thrown out into the water and scored with two double bands
of steel on one of which rested the chamber from which we had come,
with many similar chambers in front and behind. The deep gurgling
water to both sides of the jetty was in perpetual motion and, to the
east, reflected a high half moon. To the west, whence the wind came,
no stars were visible, for the sky was obscured by low-hanging
clouds. Straight ahead of the jetty, on the far side of the inlet,
for such we concluded it to be, from the fact that the fine spray
which dashed up on the jetty was salt, there loomed thousands of
hominaries, all shining with lights similar to those we had seen in
the human barn, only much brighter. What amazed us most, however, was
the fact that the water of the inlet was alive with scores of firefly
beetles of a size undreamt of in our latitudes; some of them must
have been fully 2,400 antlengths long; and all of them carried more
than one light, red and green as well as white. Altogether it was a
sight as of some scene in the dim, geologic past.</p>

<p>The air was vibrating with noise: whistling noises and human cries
lifted themselves against a background of a low, rumbling humming.
When one of these enormous fireflies swept by close to the jetty, I
could distinctly see how it moved; it had a tail under water which it
kept twisting around, with a sound as of churning: alligators lashing
the water produce such a sound.</p>

<p>All this we observed in a space of time so short that it seemed as
though we had not stopped at all. For, in the first place, Azte-ca,
acting as if she were perfectly familiar with these sights, summoned
us to follow her; and in the second place, we could not stand still,
from fear of being congealed by the cold.</p>

<p>We followed our temporary leader; and she turned south. Here,
human beings were running along the jetty, carrying fireflies in
their forefeet, encased in <i>glass</i> spheres. We paid no attention
to them but struggled on in Azte-ca's wake, dodging snow-flakes as we
went, and splashing through pools of ice-cold water. On and on, for
hours and hours.</p>

<p>And then we came to a wide road leading west, flanked on both
sides by enormous dark and sinister-looking structures and dimly
lighted by occasional fireflies perched on poles. The centre of this
road was crowded with such animals on wheels as we had already met on
the tar roads in the west. Both sides of this thoroughfare were
raised by about ten antlengths above the centre; and on these sides
human beings were hurrying east or west in great numbers. We had
considerable trouble in finding a safe path close to the buildings on
our side. Azte-ca never stopped, but hurried on as if she knew
exactly what she was about.</p>

<p>It was turning colder all the time, the temperature at last
falling almost to the freezing point; the clouds had now hidden the
moon; and snow and sleet were whirling through the air, carried by a
dark wind. Our progress became slower and slower, though our extreme
exertions counteracted to a certain extent the chilling effect of the
cold.</p>

<p>On and on, for hours and hours.</p>

<p>Then Azte-ca, still leading, turned north. Bissa-tee and myself
hardly knew any longer where we were or what we were doing; we
struggled forward as in a trance. Azte-ca was now darting this way
and that, dodging the crushing feet of humans who paid no attention
to us; and suddenly we became aware that we were right on top of one
of those enormous beetles which we had seen shooting about over the
water with their red and green lights. It was an extremely smelly
place, the atmosphere being laden with the scent of human sweat and
the exhalations of the beetle itself. Azte-ca, following the
apparently minute and accurate directions she had received from our
small friends, now invaded, without a moment's hesitation, the inner
anatomy of the monster on which we were. Soon we were out of the
weather; the air was warmer; in fact, we seemed to change from one
extreme to the other. We were amazed at the amount of mineral matter
to be found within the bodies of these beetles: the floors of the
inner cavities were of iron; and when, a few minutes later, we found
ourselves actually within its gaster, we saw that even its intestines
were metallic; everywhere this iron and steel and copper was coated
with an oily secretion; and from it radiated the monster's
body-heat.</p>

<p>Then there was a terrific snorting; the vitals of the beetle began
to move in the most unexpected way, hissing and screeching; and the
floor on which we stood, keeping out of sight as much as we could,
began to tremble and to vibrate, just as the floor of the
space-machine had done, though not to the same extent. We became
aware that we were moving; and we soon arrived at the conclusion that
we were crossing the inlet. In addition to ourselves, the monster
carried hundreds of humans.</p>

<p>The passage across the water took over a quarter of an hour; and
then, with a bump and a terrific noise of churning, we came to
against a jetty similar to the one at which we had first left the
space-machine.</p>

<p>Here my memory gives out. I still seem to hear the noise of
innumerable human feet shuffling about, and to see ourselves, after a
long time of renewed effort, hurrying along at the bottom of a canyon
2,000 antlengths deep, struggling, struggling. Daylight came, dim and
dismal; and then night came again; but it brought no rest.</p>

<p>Once more, in this compound hominary, we came out into a new sort
of canyon where there were not only thousands of human feet shuffling
along, but in the centre of which space-machines were gliding on
steel bands; these, however, were brilliantly lighted; and they
stopped here and there to take on and to discharge human passengers.
Man, as we found out by and by, is obsessed with the idea that
continual motion is bliss. But we were too tired to watch; and it
seemed as though forever after we should have to follow Azte-ca's
crazy lead.</p>

<p>Once more day came and once more night fell; and still we were
struggling along; but it was not dark; the walls of the canyon
through which we proceeded were pierced on both sides with enormous
hollows from which light flooded out as by magic into the central
space. The thundering noise of the space-machines and the purring and
hooting of the land-beetles which were darting about on every hand
fairly stunned us and made us indifferent and insensible. There was
barely any abatement in the numbers of humans crowding along on their
mysterious errands. No doubt some purpose propelled them all; but
what that purpose was seemed to transcend formicarian
understanding.</p>

<p>And then day came for the third time since our landing. We were
committed to a ceaseless wandering through a world gone insane. We
were still hurrying on at the foot of the structures occupying the
south side of the canyon, now over solid snow that began to
accumulate there, and in a never-ending, blind monotony of endeavour
which seemed to deprive us of reason and sense. But Azte-ca led; and
we followed; to stop would have been to invite certain death.</p>

<p>Then that certain death seemed to swoop down on me anyway. I
remember it had just struck me as strange that we were not being
observed: here we were, three scholars of great repute, come to
explore this human city; and the humans did not even seem to be aware
of our presence. I should have thanked my stars for their
callousness! For suddenly I <i>was</i> observed. A human hurrying
along, with his head bent low, saw me and stopped. He stopped and,
deliberately lifting his near hind-foot, he brought it down on top of
me in order to crush me out of existence! I had just time to scent a
warning to the other two while I was furiously digging myself into
the snow before the enormous flat sole of that foot descended. I
succeeded to the point where its pressure was largely taken up and
absorbed by the snow to both sides; but exhausted as I was and no
longer as nimble as I had been in my youth, I was not quite fast
enough; and so I felt my carapace crack and nearly swooned. I don't
know how I know; but that man's name was Ayr; and I want to hand at
least his appellation over to the everlasting condemnation of
antkind. Fortunately he was too stupid to understand that his fell
purpose was not achieved; and so he went on at once. I was badly
hurt: several of the dorsal plates of my thorax were cracked; but I
had buried my head deep down in the snow; and Bissa-tee, who made a
quick preliminary examination, pronounced my wounds to be serious but
not mortal. In front, Azte-ca was clamouring for us to follow her,
assuring us that before long we should have a chance to rest; and so
I dragged myself forward again, racked with pain, but triumphant
nevertheless at the thought that I had saved my brain from
destruction.</p>

<p>It was some time after noon that day when Azte-ca turned at right
angles. In thinking this adventure over, without actually remembering
the details, I have come to the conclusion that we must, in the
course of our wanderings, have crossed many side-roads; and whenever
we did, we must have been in the gravest danger of being crushed to
death. But our danger had no doubt been slight compared with the
risks we had to run now; for as we traversed this main artery of
human traffic, thundering space-machines and humming beetles
surrounded us on every foot. I can only say that more than once we
were separated; and I, being the oldest and heaviest, was always in
the rear. Somehow or other I never failed to pick up Bissa-tee's
scent again, even after I had, on one occasion, crouched down with a
space-machine thundering along right over my head and flashes of
lightning breaking right and left. It was an incredible
experience.</p>

<p>But at last we arrived in a sort of forest cleared of underbrush,
just east of the canyon. This forest was traversed by a number of
human roads or paths; and on these we saw human males and females
hurrying up to a great structure ahead of us or issuing from it.
This, as we were to find out, was Azte-ca's destination, and it
consisted of an enormous hominary containing human records. We were
destined to spend two whole winters there.</p>

<p>In the forest we stopped, and Bissa-tee examined me once more.
Then, having conferred with Azte-ca, she gave it as her opinion that
I stood a fair chance of getting to the end of our journey. I myself
was not so sure of it, for my wounds had by this time become chilled;
and in this forest the snow lay deep; but I was determined to go on
or perish: there was no choice; we could not remain where we
were.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when, singly, we made our way into
the hominary, for each of us had to wait till a human entered or
issued, we being unable to move the enormous doors.</p>

<p>The moment we were inside, we had one relief: it was warm there;
but the edges of my wounds had been frozen; and as they thawed, I
fainted. From that moment on I cannot tell what happened
further.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I recovered my consciousness, I was alone, surrounded by
twilight, though, throughout the outer reaches of the structure in
which I was, broad daylight flooded the air. I had some trouble in
remembering; too much had happened. But as my memory returned, I saw
myself, or rather the three of us, struggling again through snow and
sleet and rain, the human road roaring with noise and traffic; and I
felt sorry for myself.</p>

<p>I tried to move but could not. Where was I? Though I recalled that
I must be in that great hominary where the humans of this city kept
their records, I had not the slightest idea of what was immediately
surrounding me. To the right, a rough earthen wall rose to a dizzy
height; to the left, there were peculiar columnar structures fifteen
antlengths high, terminating in an uneven line above; these exhaled
the smell of paper made of wood and of cotton fabrics mixed with that
of fish glue and oil--a mixture I had never smelt before.</p>

<p>There was no light near me; but as my glance followed the
right-hand wall upward, it lost itself in a sea of sunlight above,
barred with black lines of shadow. Again I tried to move and failed
in the attempt. My wounds, which I now remembered again, did not
smart while I lay still; but at every motion a pain as of tightening
ligatures encircled my thorax, so intense that I winced and
henceforth was content to remain motionless. Thus I lay for
hours.</p>

<p>Then, to my infinite joy, I scented Bissa-tee approaching along
the broken upper edge of the columnar structures to my left. I even
saw her peering down at me. But she did not yet come. In my weakened
and helpless state, this precipitated me into the depths of despair.
I feared I was completely abandoned; I was left there to die alone;
for, unless I was surrounded by the care of helpful friends, I could
see nothing ahead of me but a miserable end.</p>

<p>However, presently Bissa-tee returned.</p>

<p>I must here express my profound and sincere sorrow at Bissa-tee's
untimely death of which we shall hear in due course; not only because
by that death she was deprived of the full harvest of renown and
glory which was her due on account of her great discoveries and
achievements in zoology; but also because the example of her
unrivalled tact as a medical ant was lost to ant-kind. Her surgical
and medicinal knowledge and skill, I have no doubt, can be equalled
by others, remarkable though they were; but the subtle gradations of
her bedside manner were unique. It was her theory that a patient must
above all heal herself; and that a doctor could help most by putting
her into the humour which was appropriate to her condition. Thus when
rest and relaxation were indicated, she could be so tenderly and
sorrowfully sympathetic that her patient simply surrendered herself
to her ministrations, just as a callow surrenders herself to her
nurse-ant; and when a cheerful fighting spirit was needed, she would
beat her thorax and rumble along in a loud, boisterous way which made
you laugh and desire to get up at once in order to have a playful
bout with her. Between these two extremes she had an infinite number
of gradations so subtly adapted to the condition of the patient that
I am inclined to assert her mere occasional presence had a curative
effect even on my wounds, however slight or serious they may have
been.</p>

<p>On the present occasion she was all soothing drowsiness. In sweet,
soporific scents she assured me that I was doing famously; but I must
not yet try to satisfy my curiosity; I must lie quite still; with
proper treatment and nourishing food I should, in a very few days, be
exploring again for myself.</p>

<p>At the scent of "nourishing food" I realized with something like a
pang just how hungry I was; for I had not eaten since, led by our
tiny friends, we had left our station in the middle-west of the
continent. So, when Bissa-tee gently raised my head and regurgitated
food for me, it seemed the most natural thing for her to do--as
though the mere fact of her having anything to regurgitate were not
an almost miraculous circumstance. And what she had was fungi; it is
true they were not the species cultivated at home; in fact, as I
found out, they were properly moulds and not fungi at all; but
Bissa-tee administered them with such a matter-of-course air that I
swallowed them readily, in spite of a slightly bitter taste which I
ascribed to medicinal ingredients. Meanwhile she kept up a constant,
murmuring stream of scents, conveying to me the information that, for
the time being, all our troubles were at an end: man was providing
for us, not only shelter and heat, but excellent food as well.</p>

<p>If it was her purpose to put me quietly to sleep again, she
succeded completely; as, after having partaken of this food, I became
drowsy, her manner changed to one of absolute somnolence; as though,
like some goddess of sleep, she were pouring hypnotics into my
antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p>I believe I slept for many days; for, when I awoke at last, my
wounds were nearly healed; and Bissa-tee had completely changed her
behaviour. This time she was present at the moment of my awaking; and
she was engaged in dissolving those tight bands about my thorax by
applying saliva to them. No sooner did she notice that I was emerging
from my long sleep than she began to scent to me in the most
inspiriting way that, as soon as she had finished removing my
bandages, I might go and find out where I was.</p>

<p>Only then did it strike me as curious that, while I had a
subconscious memory of the frequent visits of Bissa-tee during my
long illness, I had not once, in all that time, been visited by
Azte-ca. I promptly enquired after her; and Bissa-tee shook with
laughter. It took her quite a while to recover from her mirth; but
when she did, she told me that Azte-ca was indeed lost to the world:
she had succeeded in deciphering the human records and had now no
time for anything else. She was positively reckless, Bissa-tee added;
she was transscenting some of her more amazing discoveries at a point
to which she, Bissa-tee, could lead me if I so desired. Her
recklessness consisted in pursuing her studies day and night, often
under the very noses and eyes of man; and she devoted no more than an
indispensable minimum of time to rest and sleep. She frankly
admitted, Bissa-tee added, that she exposed herself to constant
danger; but she had gone insane with her curiosity; and she averred
that, since her discoveries were scented on the wall of the building,
her death did not matter, so long as she could pursue her studies, as
she called them, to the end.</p>

<p>My impatience became such that I could hardly wait till Bissa-tee
had finished her task before I asked her to show me these
scent-fields--for such she called them--of Azte-ca's. Accordingly, as
soon as we could, we set out for the place which was excellently
chosen, for to the left, there being a gap in the obscuring columnar
structures, a warm current of air ascended along the wall. These
walls curved upwards from all sides to a circular opening which was
crowned by a vaulted dome admitting a flood of light from above. As
far as I could survey it, the whole chamber resembled, on a gigantic
scale, those which we build for our fungus-gardens. No doubt some man
had seen the latter and brought home the art; for man is the most
imitative of all animals.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I discovered on this first trip of exploration the
source of the food which Bissa-tee had administered to me. I must,
however, not forget to mention that she had also informed me of the
nature of the columnar structures which I had noticed to my left.
They were what, in a scent new to me, she called books or human
records; and in describing them as a collective unit she used another
scent unknown to me--a scent which I will render by our own scent
literature. Now all this human literature was mouldy; and as I walked
along behind my physician and nurse, I could not refrain here and
there from nibbling at these moulds which had the exact taste of
Bissa-tee's regurgitation. When, on the present occasion, she saw me,
she laughed. "Bitter?" she asked; and when I agreed, she added,
"Queer stuff; no doubt the bitterness is imparted by the contents.
It's wholesome food; but, if I'm any judge, it must be poison for
man. You won't see many healthy and normal specimens here, such as
we've seen in the fields and the streets; those that come here,
somehow look like worms to me; if it were not flattering them, I'd
call them bookworms. I hope no real bookworm will scent me, though."
And again she laughed in her boisterous way, shaking from head to
gaster as she went on, "They'd have made good food for our lamented
friend Assa-ree and her hordes."</p>

<p>I thought her almost frivolous; it had been tacitly understood
between us that Assa-ree was not to be mentioned.</p>

<p>But to come to our records. I was soon absorbed in what Azte-ca
had recorded: it formed amazing scenting.</p>

<p>First of all, in an introduction of her own, she explained the
physical nature of human records. Man had a limited number of visual
symbols standing for sounds. These sound-symbols were arranged in
groups called words; and words were arranged in lines; and groups of
lines in pages. These pages were imprinted on sheets of paper made by
chewing wood--a manufacture familiar to us from certain tribes of our
own kind as well as from wasps. These sheets of paper, both sides of
which were used, were then fastened together in bunches of from one
to three hundred and formed a book. The only way in which an ant,
even when she had deciphered this cumbersome system of symbols, could
read human records was to run along line after line and to look at
symbol after symbol, carefully fitting them together into an
auditional perception; and, next, to fit the auditional perceptions
together into a conceptual context. By way of an admiring foot-note,
Azte-ca added that man had taken great pains to guard against these
records being used by the uninitiated; for, she explained, the same
symbol or group of symbols is often used for very different sounds;
and many symbols are carefully imprinted between others without
having any sound-value whatever: a perversity which, to me, seemed to
render the whole system worthless. I was inclined to think that
Azte-ca was simply mistaken her assumptions; I convinced myself later
on that she was right; but I did not agree with her in admiring man
for having found a way of making access to his records intellectually
very difficult to his fellow-men. Still later I found, from man's own
records, that it takes his callows, according to the degree of
initiation required, from six to sixteen years to acquire the art of
deciphering such records as they may need in the station of life
which they wish to occupy. On the other hand, it took me, once I had
grasped the complicated principles involved, exactly one hour to
learn to read any record of his.</p>

<p>But to continue. When such a book is opened, two consecutive pages
are accessible; to make the next two available, a leaf has to be
turned. And this, Azte-ca stated, she had learned to do. One
considerable difficulty, which I discovered later, Azte-ca failed to
mention, namely, that the order in which the primary sound-symbols
are printed runs invariably from left to right, instead of
alternating from line to line, which means that we, after having run
along one line, had to return to our starting-point idle. The labour
involved was thereby doubled.</p>

<p>In order to finish this topic before I proceed, I will anticipate
here. Azte-ca was indefatigable in her labours and soon became so
infatuated with man's perverse ways that she devoured this literature
of his seemingly for no other purpose than to transscent it on the
walls of the building. Whatever books she found open on the reading
tables provided for humans she went through indiscriminately.
Bissa-tee, on the other hand, though she learned the art of
deciphering, never indulged in its exercise beyond a measure which
she prescribed for herself for the purpose of reducing or "slimming"
as she called it; like our lamented Anna-zee, she was rapidly
becoming obese.</p>

<p>I myself used more discrimination in the choice of books which I
read. I soon found that Azte-ca was wasting her time on an enormous
amount of what the humans call fiction, i.e., books written on
entirely imaginary things; she actually used to get excited about
them, especially when they dealt with crime and its detection. It did
not take me long to find out that, whenever she came to a record of
human science or history, she promptly left it; I only needed to
watch her in order to have the very thing which I wanted; it was
invariably what she disdained. As for her omnivorous and injudicious
reading, I will give one or two figures. During the seventeen moons
which we spent in this hominary, she read no less than 6,321 books;
which feat involved travelling, afoot and at top speed, a total
distance of 1,769,880,000 antlengths or about 13,696 human miles. In
all which she had no other aim than to satisfy a vulgar curiosity. I
myself, on the other hand, aimed at understanding man's social
organization which would decide his position in the phylogenetic
scale of evolution.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that in this brief record I cannot even
summarize the information gathered. The curious are referred to
scent-trees 346 to 389 and 733 to 813 for such a summary. At present
I must be content to relate events rather than give the results of
investigation and research.</p>

<p>During our stay in this <i>library</i> we had, naturally, to
adjust our own day to that of the humans. Or perhaps it would be more
correct to state that I had to do so; for Bissa-tee stood apart from
our labours, learning to decipher the records of man more from a
motive of vanity than from that of a thirst for knowledge which is
the fountain head of all intellectual achievement; and Azte-ca, in
spite of repeated warnings, took such risks as no ant should
take.</p>

<p>To speak of her first, I might say that she pursued her reading at
almost any time of the day or night. Usually the library began to
fill with human readers quite early in the morning; and Azte-ca soon
knew a good many of them. That is to say, she knew their tastes in
literature and the places where they preferred to sit. There was
accommodation for eight hundred human readers. I will briefly tell of
the circumstances which first induced her to disregard all danger. On
the counter near the door where at night nearly all books that had
been used and were required again must be deposited, she had become
acquainted with a record which, from what she reported about it,
dealt with a peculiarly intricate murder story; and she had just
reached the most exciting part of it (for in all this branch of
literature man aims chiefly at excitement) when, next morning, the
human officers of the library arrived; so far, she had always taken
that for a signal to retire; and she did so on this occasion. She
watched, however, for she was trembling with excitement; and soon she
saw a human female appear and take up this record which she carried
to a certain favourite seat of hers. This was exactly what Azte-ca
had expected. But within an hour the human female finished her
reading and returned the book to the counter where she was supplied
with another. Azte-ca had, in the meantime, on one of the shelves
where the books were kept, run the whole round of the hall, getting
herself quite out of breath with hurry. She hated to lose sight of
that precious record. To her disgust, a human attendant promptly
picked it up and replaced it on one of the shelves. Again Azte-ca ran
a race with this man and, helpless to prevent it, saw what he did.
There it was to stand henceforth, much regretted by Azte-ca, tightly
wedged in between other records. I believe that, had she lived a
thousand years, she would still have been impatient whenever anyone
alluded to that book; for although she read meanwhile thousands upon
thousands of other books, she could never forget her being
disappointed of this one. She asserted, of course, that her curiosity
was solely concerned with the question whether man's resolution of
the mystery agreed with her own which she pronounced to be highly
ingenious. We often teased her about it. But from that day on she
began to take undue risks. Whenever, henceforth, she had been unable
to finish a book, she made it a point to linger about the counter
where she could not turn the pages without being detected; and when
the human reader returned for the book, she jumped on to his flowing
outer integuments and climbed up on shoulder or head of this reader.
When he sat down, she remained and read with him. This was an art
which she acquired by infinite practice: I never did; my eye-sight
was no longer good enough. For man does not run along the lines when
he reads; he merely follows them with his eyes; and Azte-ca who, as I
have repeatedly said, was a genius in her way, soon learned from him.
Many and many a time she was seen, of course, and ruthlessly brushed
to the ground by a human fore-foot; but she was not to be discouraged
by such slight reverses, not even after she had lost a middle leg by
a fall. Ultimately, as we shall see, Azte-ca brought disaster upon
herself and came near bringing it upon Bissa-tee and me as well.</p>

<p>I myself read chiefly at night and rested in daytime. The sort of
books I read--science, history, philosophy, and the like--were mostly
used by privileged human readers of a more or less advanced age who
had the right to leave them, piled together, on the tables where they
had their seats; and there these books were left undisturbed when at
night their readers went home. Such records, which were often of
considerable bulk, presented, however, one considerable difficulty,
namely, that they were exceedingly hard to open. Almost every night I
had to enlist the help of both my associates in order to achieve that
feat; and though I did manage to turn the often large and stiff pages
by myself, that task, too, required the exertion of every ounce of my
strength. I pursued my studies invariably till the first human
readers appeared which was an hour or two after the attendants had
arrived at the counter.</p>

<p>As for Bissa-tee, I have already said that she took no interest
whatever in our pursuits; for two or three hours every morning she
indulged in what she called gymnastics, in order to keep her ever
growing bulk within manageable limits; after that she undid whatever
effect these exercises might have had by roaming all over this
hominary in search of the choicest moulds; she asserted that these
varied considerably according to the kind of literature they grew on,
being bitter and tasting of medicinal substances when growing on
philosophic works; sweet and ethereal, when growing on poetry written
by females; and having an outright intoxicating effect when growing
on works of so-called theology. Personally, I never could taste the
difference.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>For a long while--in fact, for over a year--life thus went on
placidly enough. The moulds growing on this human literature
furnished an inexhaustible and nourishing though, to me, slightly
unpalatable food; the temperature was almost as equable as in our
brood-chambers; and we seemed to be perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Then I had the first terrifying intimation of the fact that our
presence had not remained unnoticed. What I am about to relate forms
one of the most harassing memories of this period; and it is with
some hesitation that I set it down; only a strict regard for truth
forces me not to suppress a single feature of the adventure.</p>

<p>I had by this time completely mastered the art of understanding
human speech. For this purpose I had my ear-drums coated, just as in
the past I had coated those of Azte-ca; but we now used a different
substance for the purpose, namely, a liquid which, on exposure to the
air, hardened quickly and which we found in large glasses on the
counter by the door; man calls it <i>mucilage.</i> These coatings
which Bissa-tee applied for me, so deadened the thunder of the human
voice that it reached my delicate auditory nerves as from a great
distance, resembling the pleasant murmur of a brook.</p>

<p>One night, then--I believe it was in the fourteenth moon of our
stay in the library--I had run across a book dealing with ourselves.
My students will hardly credit the fact, which is nevertheless quite
true: this book was written by our old friend or enemy, the Wheeler.
It seems only natural that I should have been sufficiently absorbed
to lose track of the passage of time; and suddenly I became aware
that I had read on, still turning the pages, till it was broad
daylight. Already there were numbers of human readers scattered
throughout the great chamber and engaged in their studies. Now the
human which had frequented this particular reading platform, in a
remote corner of the hall, was a young female which did not, as a
rule, make its appearance much before noon. So, glancing about and
finding that I was in fair privacy, I made up my mind that it was
safe to go on for another hour or so; for I had just reached an
account, from the human point of view, of the Attas.</p>

<p>To my dismay, however, the human female appeared shortly, and at
the very moment when I was laboriously turning a page. She was a bold
sort of callow, not over forty years old; and humans, I suppose,
would have called her handsome. Her head was covered by a sort of
smooth clypeus; and her neck rolled up in a thick fur resembling that
of a fox (I shall have more to say about these singular human
integuments in the next section). She was tall, slender, and
athletic; and her face showed several coatings of a wax-like
substance of two colours, white and red. This coating, Bissa-tee
conjectured, was applied by the tongues of males; one day, she
asserted, she had, in a recess of the library, distinctly seen a male
applying its mouth to the cheek of a female; and, investigating at
once, she had, beyond the possibility of a doubt, ascertained the
fact that the same substance, also red and white, was coating the
lips of the male which promptly protruded its tongue to lick it back
into its mouth.</p>

<p>Now I must explain that, from the very moment on when Azte-ca had
first deciphered human speech and records, I had cherished the hope
of establishing communication with man. This could not be done
orally; for man's auditory nerves are far too coarse to perceive the
fine and delicate sounds we produce by stridulation. It could be done
only by way of his records, and I had already conceived a practicable
method.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the human female appeared on this fateful
morning, I made up my mind to attempt this great task then and there.
Here, I said to myself, is a human being which, by the very nature of
its reading, shows that it is interested in ants. What better
opportunity could I expect to find?</p>

<p>I dropped the leaf I was on the point of turning and began running
along the lines of the page; and whenever I found one of the symbols
I needed, I carefully deposited a drop of my black anal secretion
below it. I could not believe that she would fail to see it.</p>

<p>Imagine, therefore, my surprise when this female, at sight of me,
uttered a low scream and instinctively, at least so it seemed, swept
me to the ground by a terrible swoop of her fore-foot. Yet even then
I could not conceive of a young female's soul being so devoid of all
finer stirrings as to make it instinctively bent on murder. Had she
watched for just a minute, she could not have failed to grasp my
intention. But what did she do? She ran after me and, raising her
hind-foot, tried to bring it down on me, just as the man had done in
the street some fourteen moons ago.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune that I did not for a moment lose my
presence of mind. Seeing what this human female was about, I
remembered an anatomical peculiarity of the female foot as compared
with that of the male. The fore-part of the foot consists, on its
under side, of a huge, flat expanse which, towards the rear, curves
up into a vault behind which there is a columnar heel; this heel is,
in the female, much higher than in the male. I have sometimes thought
that it would be possible to classify human beings by their heels:
the higher it is, the larger the share of the female characteristics,
even in males; and the lower it is, the larger the share of the male
characteristics, even in females. I believe this would furnish a
perfectly sound basis for division. But to return to my story.</p>

<p>Remembering this peculiarity of the foot of the female, I turned
on my back when I saw the foot descending upon me. At the exactly
right moment I propelled myself upward with an extreme exertion,
first raising abdomen and head and then bringing them down with a
thump on the smooth stone of the floor, imparting a spring to my
whole body. I had to calculate that jump to a nicety; for had I
reached sole or heel instead of the arch of the foot, it would have
meant certain death. To my relief, however, I found myself, a moment
later, securely clinging to the vaulted roof of that arch; and then
the foot, with a terrific impact, came down on the floor, nearly
dislodging me.</p>

<p>Apparently the human female was half exhausted by the effort; for
she dropped into a sitting posture in what humans call an arm-chair.
This sitting position was of a kind peculiar to humans which must
ever seem offensive to the modesty of ants. My students can imagine
the state of mind I was in. The moment the tension resolved itself
into the feeling of relief, I simply shook with indignation: a clumsy
human female had nearly annihilated me, the depositary of the most
advanced science of ants!</p>

<p>In relating the remainder of this adventure, however, I cannot but
confess to a certain degree of shame. I, a votary of science, having
just, by a special dispensation, escaped from imminent danger, should
not have allowed myself to be carried away by unreasoning anger. Yet,
had I not been so carried away, we should not have had the warning to
which I have referred. Let the student remember that even science
leaves us, in our lesser moments, mere formicarian beings subject to
passion. For my own justification I can say that I struggled against
the lower impulse which, however, proved stronger than my more
elevated thought.</p>

<p>Slowly and stealthily I left the cave of my refuge and swung up on
top of that foot. There, too, it was partly covered with the same
coriaceous integument as the sole. I proceeded upward along the
tibial reach of the leg, covered, up to and slightly beyond the
genicular joint, by a different, fibrous integument. Over this I ran
carefully and swiftly, feeling comparatively safe, for I was here
hidden from the female's eye by a series of outer, long, curtain-like
coverings. More than once, however, the human female made sudden
rubbing movements, leg against leg, as if to brush me off, just as we
should try to brush off a particle of dust irritating our legs.
Whenever she did so, I stopped, keeping out of the way.</p>

<p>And then I reached a large, bare expanse of soft white skin and
stopped. I was standing on the very edge of the fibrous integument
covering her tibia. While pausing, I collected in my poison glands as
large a quantity of formic acid as I could muster; and, taking hold,
with my jaws, of the soft flesh, I injected, in a sudden giddy burst
of passion quite unworthy of myself, an enormous dose of the
poison.</p>

<p>A scream resounded such as I never hope to hear again. The sound
loosened my joints. It was followed by a most violent motion. The
human female had, with one single bound, sought the privacy of a
niche behind a book-rack; and before I was aware of what was
happening, she there lifted up her outer, loose integuments. She must
actually have seen me in the act of withdrawing my sting. Fortunately
her scream had attracted the attention of a number of males who came
running; and as they appeared, the young female for one reason or
other dropped those fringe-like integuments. I took a leap, reached
the rear edge of these fringes, and jumped to safety on a
book-shelf.</p>

<p>Thence I watched and listened. The young female turned to one of
the males who seemed to be a man in authority and said, her eyes
flashing, "The whole place swarms with ants!" "Yes," replied the
male. "We have had complaints before. I shall see to it shortly."</p>

<p>That was our warning; and I did not fail to communicate it to my
associates. The incident has been given in such detail chiefly
because I suspect it led directly to the catastrophe which was to
terminate our stay in the library. But, strange to say, this
catastrophe was delayed for several moons, perhaps because we, having
had a warning, became much more cautious; till, early in the spring
of the second year, the seventh of our absence from home, we became
just a little careless again and thereby perhaps precipitated the
vengeance of man.</p>

<p>One morning there appeared a whole squad of old human females of a
type which we had, so far, seen only singly. They were the charwomen
who looked after the cleaning of the floors. Bissa-tee was, at the
time, absorbed in her gymnastic exercises which she now performed
religiously every morning in order to keep her ever growing
corpulency down: she was at the back of that row of books behind
which, a year and a half ago, I had regained consciousness. Azte-ca
was on the counter near the open door, reading a detective story and,
therefore, lost to the world. I was sunning myself on a shelf along
the eastern wall. It was a most beautiful day of the early
spring.</p>

<p>The moment I saw that squad of old women with their pails,
carrying long-handled, loose, fringy things called mops, I felt
invaded by a sense of coming disaster. They looked so sinister and
determined. Only then did it strike me that no human readers had yet
appeared although it was quite late in the day. For a moment I
thought this must be one of those periodically recurring days on
which the library remained closed. But I also knew that these days
came in a regular succession and that none was due. I felt it my duty
to investigate at once.</p>

<p>One of the women emptied the fluid in her pail on the floor; and
promptly all of them began to swish it about with their mops. By this
time I had gained a vantage-point on a window-ledge directly above
them.</p>

<p>There I felt suddenly assailed by sickening fumes rising from that
liquid which they were mopping about. For the fraction of a second I
remained inactive; for the fumes seemed to deprive me of the power of
motion; in fact, I came very near to falling off the ledge.</p>

<p>Then, with the sense of a coming disaster intensifying, I made a
superformicarian effort and hastened away, towards the place where
Bissa-tee was performing her exercises. I was still under the
illusion that Azte-ca was on the counter near the door. Unfortunately
I chose the outside of the shelf for my hurried run. Had I been on
the inside, between books and wall, I could not but have passed the
very place where, at that moment, Azte-ca was engaged in recording
the contents of her latest story on the wall. Only when I arrived
opposite the spot where, an hour or so ago, I had left Bissa-tee, I
swung up on the cliff formed by the books; and, a moment later, I
espied Bissa-tee who had interrupted her exercises and was now
standing rigid, waving her antenn&aelig; in a first realization of
the coming danger; for the fumes were already faintly perceptible
even here. When she saw me, she scented the single word, "Chlorine",
and stared at me. I told her what I had observed; and she turned at
once, scenting, "Come," and began to scale the wall. This wall
consisted of a rough-cast of aluminious clay. I soon passed Bissa-tee
who, by reason of her recently-acquired obesity, was no longer quite
as quick as she might have been. But when she reached the dizzy
height of the next tier of windows, her scent overtook me, signalling
"Stop!" We were here above the fumes; but I feared that, owing to the
diffusing power of gases, they would soon reach us. I waited for
Bissa-tee who was laboriously following in my wake. She turned at
right angles to our previous line of ascent; and, going north, we
reached a window-shelf, I being first again; but when Bissa-tee
caught me up, she, to my infinite relief, pointed out a small round
opening between frame and sash of the window--an opening through
which a strong current of fresh air was entering from the outside.
This opening was large enough for us to crawl through, a feat which
Bissa-tee promptly proposed to perform. It was a feat indeed, for the
air pressure against which we should have had to work was enormous.
At the very moment, however, at which Bissa-tee was inserting her
head into this tunnel, I thought of Azte-ca and held her back.</p>

<p>Having communicated to her my misgivings with regard to our
associate, I took a flying leap down to the topmost book-shelf where
I intended to wait for Bissa-tee. But when she did not come, I looked
up and saw her on the very edge of the ledge where she stood, waving
to me in great distress that, owing to a fatty degeneration of her
heart, she dared not to take the leap. I signalled back to her to
wait and hurriedly ran south, in the direction of the counter near
the door. Azte-ca was not there. I became frantic with alarm.</p>

<p>I quickly descended to the lower shelf on which we had had our
quarters. Here, the fumes were now much thicker; but disregarding all
danger I dashed forward at a speed of which I should not have thought
myself capable. I had barely reached our abandoned station when I
caught sight of Azte-ca on the wall where she had only just become
aware of the fumes.</p>

<p>I noticed that these fumes had here already taken sufficient
effect to shrivel up the delicate moulds on which we had lived so
long. But I did not delay over that; I was bent only on attracting
Azte-ca's attention; and I cannot believe that the powerful scents I
emitted should have failed to reach her; yet she paid no attention to
them.</p>

<p>For a long while Azte-ca had shown symptoms of a peculiar mental
aberration. It had become a mania with her to imagine herself in the
part of a human being engaged in detecting crime. She had even
elaborately constructed methods of committing such crime in a way
which would make its detection impossible or at least exceedingly
difficult. I am sorry to say that both Bissa-tee and myself had, in
the beginning, encouraged her in this pernicious activity. We took an
unreasonable pride in the fact that an ant should prove herself
superior in ingenuity to man, a thing we should have treated as a
matter of course. For our justification I can only aver that we
ceased doing this as soon as we became aware of the effect this
preoccupation had upon Azte-ca's practical sense.</p>

<p>This utter lack of practical sense, a consequence of the
submersion of her mind in human folly, showed itself disastrously at
the present moment. Already half overcome by the fumes, Azte-ca,
instead of obeying my summons, precipitated herself from the dizzy
height at which she was to the floor beneath. She was alive when she
landed; but in her panic she made a dash in a direction exactly
opposite to that which she should have taken. A moment later she lay,
expiring, in the swirling flood whence our danger arose. It was my
sad destiny to see her perish there. One of the old women said in a
voice full of unspeakable disgust, "The nahsty crayture!" and
squarely planted her foot on the dying ant. Thus perished Azte-ca,
one of the most ingenious signallers the world had ever seen. She was
crushed to a pulp. To such senseless accidents are we ants exposed on
this earth!</p>

<p>I could not help her; I was by that time half overcome myself; and
I sought safety in flight.</p>

<p>When I rejoined Bissa-tee, the news I brought almost prostrated
her; and if I had not kept my head and propelled her towards the
tunnel, she would have stayed behind and perished like Azte-ca. There
was not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the passage came near frustrating our escape.
More than once Bissa-tee found her abdomen tightly jammed between its
walls. Fortunately I was behind her; and so, after much squeezing and
pushing, we arrived outside. When we did, we were so exhausted that
we resolved to anchor ourselves as best we could and to stay where we
were till we had regained a measure of our strength. During the
interval of waiting we vowed to each other that under no
circumstances would we allow ourselves to be separated after we had
descended to earth. There was much speculation with regard to the
direction to follow; for neither of us had paid much attention to
this matter when we had arrived a year and a half ago: at that time
we had simply followed the lead of our lamented Azte-ca.</p>

<p>We left our eyrie with the fall of night; and when the steep
descent was accomplished, we struck east. There was no lack of light
and scarcely a diminution of the traffic usual on these human roads;
and we found this so harassing that, after a few hours, we were glad,
on catching sight of another huge hominary, to be able to escape from
it. This hominary which we thus entered by a mere chance turned out
to be a sort of aphis-shed or stable for those enormous beasts that
pull the human space-machines over the bands of steel provided for
their progress.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><sup> </sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In human words, it was a railway station, probably
the 42nd Street station in New York. E.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We remained there for many days, watching and studying; Bissa-tee
regained a measure of her former agility and enterprise and spent
many hours exploring by herself. Ultimately she brought the news that
she had found out when and whence a certain space-machine was going
to start for the south-west.</p>

<p>That this south-west of the continent must be our destination was
tacitly understood between us. With only the two of us left, we were
bound to strike for home at last; and such is the power of hope which
dwells forever in the breast of ants, that from now on we began to
live mentally once more in the great and glorious formicary in the
valley of the Orinoco River. I, for one, needed only to close my eyes
in order to see myself stretched out luxuriously while half a dozen
medi&aelig; groomed my long-neglected body--a luxury which I had
foregone for so many years. Bissa-tee, too, avowed that when she
slept she dreamt of home; and henceforth, when we were awake, we both
struggled and fought in order to get there. Already the sufferings
and incessant labours which lay behind us counted for nothing; ahead
of us lay the happy return.</p>

<p>A matter of six or seven days later we arrived, in a human
space-machine, in a city near the mouth of that very river which we
had crossed so long ago by way of the metal-threads of that
mysterious spider which we had never seen after all. This river we
crossed by an enormous bridge built on the same principle of which we
make use in spanning smaller waters; and after various vicissitudes
of which there is no need to speak in detail, we were launched on our
last great march to the south and west. The difficulties and
privations we had to cope with were worthy to inspire our minstrels
and to be preserved for the memory of posterity as an inspiration to
future generations. Before I record a few details, however, I must
briefly summarize the conclusions we arrived at with regard to
man.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>First of all, then, both Bissa-tee and myself verified the
remarkable fact that man moults at will, seasonally as well as
diurnally. This gift seems at first sight to place him apart from all
the rest of nature as one of the luckiest of all created beings. Yet,
when we reflect what pangs, let me say, a grasshopper has to endure
in order to change his coat three or four times in his life, we may
well hesitate in pronouncing him blessed in this fact. We shall soon
see that, though man moults at will and is able to adapt himself to
all changes of the weather, there is good reason to infer that he
does not do so without suffering and pain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we had, in the earlier part of our stay among men,
small opportunity to observe man in his more intimate private life.
The nearest we came to such observations was on our last trip in the
great space-machine which took us south; for this space-machine was
provided with special chambers to which the human passengers retired
at night for the purpose of resting. There, then, we saw this curious
mammal in a state least protected against the vicissitudes of the
climate. The integuments which he wore in daytime were discarded and
others were donned, of a kind which would serve but poorly to keep
out the cold and to shed rain, sleet, or snow. The process of change
from one set to another, which we had a good chance to observe, was
essentially similar to that by which a grasshopper moults: man
crawled out of the integument to be discarded, often using his limbs
to push it forward while he withdrew. When every one of the
successive integuments was removed, the body was found to be covered
only by a soft membranaceous skin of a porous texture with a
sprinkling of hair here and there and a few chitinous plates
distributed over the extremities of his limbs. The hair was
rudimentary; not one of them retaining even a trace of the power to
serve as a sensilla. The chitinous plates were found exclusively on
the upper surfaces of the toes of both fore- and hind-limbs where
they serve as a protection to the most sensitive nerve-endings of
these members. This, too, is curious in the extreme. For of what use
can these sensitive nerve-endings be when they are covered with an
insensitive armour? That they are there, was conclusively shown when
a man's extreme toe-tips were caught between the frame and the
movable part of a heavy door: this man gave evidence of pain by using
frightful language, calling upon his god and that god's counterpart
to bear him witness that the door had wronged him.</p>

<p>When, on retiring at night, man had thus divested himself of his
diurnal integuments, he remained in this naked state for only a
minimum of time; and then followed what seemed to be the most
startling part of the performance. For, while, no doubt, a new
integument is gradually being secreted by the inner skin, he assumed
provisionally another integument <i>by crawling into it.</i>
Similarly in the morning, when the nocturnal integument was
discarded, he crawled back into the diurnal ones. What is more, he
carried about with him a choice of such integuments, both diurnal and
nocturnal: a most amazing thing which would have been entirely
incomprehensible to us if we had not in a manner already been
prepared for some such discovery.</p>

<p>During our long stay in the hominary of the great human city we
had more than once had an opportunity of listening in when two or
three human beings, mostly females, indulged in a little relaxed
conversation about their integuments. Strange to say, integuments
form the chief and most absorbing theme of their thoughts, and they
are the chief object of their pride. It was long before we understood
this. As far as I could make out, both male and female man produce
these integuments in advance and in number, so as to have them on
hand. It is exactly as though a grasshopper moulted three or four
times in succession without growing in size and, therefore, without
outgrowing the discarded moults. He would, then, store these moults,
which would be of varying strength and consistency, in a place which
he could remember; or he would carry them about, suspended, let me
say, in an appropriate leaf-fold from his forefoot; for that is
exactly what man does.</p>

<p>The process by which these integuments are produced we had no
opportunity to watch; but I heard a good deal of it; enough to give
me a fairly accurate idea.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly man produces his integuments in exactly the manner of
the grasshopper; namely, as a secretion of his skin. This was
strikingly confirmed by a conversation which I overheard in a remote
recess of the library where it took place between a young male and a
female who were getting ready for their marriage flight. The male
reproached the female for never having time for him; and she replied
that she had to keep working in order to have integuments to cover
her nakedness; man, by the way, is not satisfied with one plain and
clear word for anything; in this case she called her integuments
"clothes". Whereupon the male said smilingly, "In the sweat of thy
brow shalt thou clothe thyself, eh?" If any ant can put a
satisfactory interpretation on these words other than the one
suggested, I should like to know it. I visualized that condition of
the female. Just like the grasshopper she sat or lay, sweating in
anguish as she produced a new integument. Worse than the grasshopper,
she had to go on maturing this integument till she could slip it off;
for only from that moment on was it of any use to her. Unlike the
grasshopper, she could henceforth slip back into it at will. This
explanation of the process furnishes at least a working hypothesis,
scientifically sound because it explains all the known facts.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature about these integuments, perhaps the
most remarkable of all, is more difficult to explain; and for the
present I must content myself with a simple statement of the facts.
All man's integuments are mimetic. I presume it to be well known that
mimicry occurs among insects wherever a species is either formidable
on account of the weapons with which it is provided or unpalatable to
its potential enemies. The most striking examples of this human
mimicry came under our observation during the two winter seasons
spent in the human city. Nearly every human wore an outer integument
closely resembling the hairy covering of some other mammal. Bissa-tee
identified among them those of the wolf, the fox, the beaver, the
squirrel, the sheep, the marten, the mink, and many others. Why man
who, in his own cities, can to a certain extent be said to be the
dominant animal should mimic, let me say, the rat, in his
integuments, is beyond my power to understand. As a matter of fact,
Bissa-tee was of the opinion that not man but the small rodents,
rats, mice, etc., were dominant there. To me, the relation between
man and these rodents seemed to be rather of the nature of a
symbiosis. I do not think that man could live without the scavenging
service performed by the rodents; in return for which man furnishes
them with shelter, warmth, and food.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Bissa-tee had another remarkable theory which
might explain at least some of the facts. She suggested that these
integuments were not true integuments at all but trophies; just as
some of our soldiers had been wearing the heads of Pseudomyrmex ever
since the battle at the isthmus. This theory of Bissa-tee's, highly
ingenious as it was, seemed inadequate to me. If, f.i., the
integuments mimicking rat skins had been real rat skins worn as
trophies, we should occasionally have seen humans who wore only two
or three such skins, or five or six; but the integuments in question
were always complete. It cannot be presumed that in every battle
between humans and rats--and battles do take place--the two species
are always represented in the exact proportion of one man to
so-and-so-many rats, enough to furnish the former with a complete
integument; nor that man should always and invariably be victorious
to the extent of killing the exactly right number. Further
observation will be needed to decide between these two contending
theories; but I venture to say, after mature deliberation, that there
is no third way of explaining the facts.</p>

<p>So much for the morphological side of this mooted question.</p>

<p>There is, however, an ecological and even an ethnological side to
it; and a very brief summary of our investigations is perhaps needed
here to round off the subject. I must say, however, that in this
respect our expedition shared the fate of all former expeditions sent
out from our own city: it opened up more problems, at least with
regard to man, than it answered. In saying this, I am well aware that
I am confirming the speculations about the ultimate fate of all
scientific enquiry which our lamented botanist-in-chief expounded to
us in her disquisition on the knowable and the unknowable worlds.</p>

<p>So far, it has been considered as axiomatic that only insects have
reached a point of development where the division of labour attendant
upon a social life is reflected in a morphological division into
physiological castes. Such castes, it has been held, do not exist in
any other subdivision of the animal kingdom, least of all among
mammals. Not even the dimorphism of the sexes was, strictly speaking,
and apart from the purely sexual functions, reflected in a division
of castes. The cow grazes as much as the bull; the she-panther hunts
as laboriously as the male. Now the very conditions under which we
studied man imposed certain limitations upon our investigations. But
enough was seen to place one fact beyond doubt, namely, that man's
whole social organization is built up on at least the ideal of a
strict division into castes. If I add that much of the certainty with
which I can assert this derives from human records, I must beg leave
to point out that, in this particular case, the general unreliability
of these records does not invalidate our conclusions. They are based,
not on what man consciously meant to put down, but on a critical
interpretation of what he put into them without being aware of its
import.</p>

<p>Thus certain integuments disqualify their bearer for certain
occupations. No conclusion could be more certain; and if Azte-ca's
promiscuous reading in human fiction had any value whatever, it must
be looked for in the confirmation her summaries gave to this theory
of mine. When, in a story, a man wishing to perform certain work is
debarred from achieving his ambition, because he lacks the proper
integuments, that is evidence of the highest importance; and it is
trustworthy for the very reason that it is indirect. Nevertheless, if
there is such a purely physiological division, it is not yet rigid or
fixed; for, strange to say, man can pass from one caste into another,
provided he can produce the integuments proper to that caste. At
first sight this may seem wholly admirable. I thought of the
medi&aelig; and the minims among the Myrmecocysts of the Garden of
the Gods, those unfortunates who, while physiologically not adapted
for the function of authors, yet thought they had had "the call". But
among humans it leads to a state of affairs which, among ants, would
never be tolerated. For man's occupations--i.e., among workers--are
not considered as of equal value, or, as he would express it, of
equal prestige; and this is the incomprehensible thing about it: the
more necessary and indispensable a given kind of work is, the more it
is despised; and the less necessary and indispensable it is, the more
highly is it rewarded; till absolute idleness and parasitism become
the coveted goal.</p>

<p>Consequently, man's chief aim in life is to produce such
integuments as confer upon him the admission into a higher caste,
either in fact or in semblance. If we can trust the conclusions we
drew from Azte-ca's transscentures of human fiction, most of human
life is taken up by a frantic endeavour to produce ever finer and
more respected integuments; most men, and especially females, spend
the greater part of their waking hours in so-called "sweat shops" to
produce them; and, having produced them, they spend the remainder in
flaunting or discussing them. We even met with evidence tending to
show that integuments can be produced by one individual for another;
but what reward can be offered to induce anyone to do so is beyond my
understanding, especially when I reflect that such vicarious
production might enable the producer himself to enter the higher
caste. From what I have said, however, it will be clear that the very
fact of the fluidity of the castes, instead of being a blessing, is a
curse to mankind; it keeps man enslaved to purely material ends. It
was a surprise to find that, under the circumstances, there should be
any men at all who devoted themselves to science, art, and other
things of the spirit. The difficulty was partly solved when we found
that these are precisely the ones who despise the pomp of integument;
and that, on the whole, they live the lives of the lowest castes.</p>

<p>One more point I must mention though I cannot explain it. Man has
a way of enslaving his fellow-men by means of a thing of which we
read much--a thing he calls money and which some have and others have
not. Just what it is, I do not know; and neither, I suspect, does man
himself. It is a cruel thing, since its lack condemns to abject
slavery or actual want; whereas its possession confers the highest
privileges. It has something to do with man's integuments; but just
what the connection is I never found out.</p>

<p>Since man has the rudiments of a medical science, I could never
understand either why he does not, by certain innocent surgical
manipulations, so alter the structure of the brain of all those whom
he intends for slaves as to make it impossible for them to covet a
higher status. If he gave his medical officers the power to enquire
into the financial circumstances (as he calls them) of the parents of
a new-born child--man, as I infer from analogy with other mammals, is
viviparous--and, if these financial circumstances are found to be
such as to predestine the child to a life of slavery, what could be
simpler than for this medical officer to make the future man happy in
that acquiescence in slavery which will be enforced in any case, but
by methods both cruel and inefficient?</p>

<p>The curious will infer from this neglect of simple expedients that
man has either not yet risen to any very high degree of civilization;
or--which is my own opinion--that he has considerably degenerated
from a level previously attained. In this opinion I was confirmed by
certain historical records of man which dealt with the past of this
continent from the human point of view.</p>

<p>If, then, I were, in conclusion, to give my final idea of man,
based on such experience as we had with him, I should say that he is
at present a degenerate type; and that, even in a happier past, he
has never attained a level of civilization which could in any way be
called comparable to our own.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bissa-tee and myself had been struggling along for months and
months, going roughly in a south-west direction. So long as we were
north of the range of the Ecitons, we travelled in daytime, resting
at night in any hollow that offered, mostly in the cracks of the bark
of certain trees. We suffered as we had never suffered before, from
hunger, from exhaustion, from that depression which I now recognized
as arising from the fact that we were alone. This may sound strange;
the point is that the responsibility for others and the very
magnitude of the task which had so far been ahead of us had, during
the first five or six years of the expedition, distracted our
thoughts from ourselves. A whole compound organism had been
functioning; and we had been part of that organism. It had carried us
along. Now that organism had disappeared; the task, apart from
reporting our results, had been accomplished or abandoned. Perhaps
both of us felt that we were entitled to our rest; both of us
resented the fact that we had to go on struggling in order to get
home before we could rest; and, worst of all, each of us resented any
delay that became necessary, not as a new misfortune opposing us, but
as the fault of the other.</p>

<p>Thus, one evening, we came to a stream which, at any earlier date,
we should have promptly crossed, for it was shallow and all but
bridged by stones. I was the first to arrive; and had I been leading
any considerable number of my associates, I should have gone on and
crossed at once. As it was, I waited for my companion; but during
that wait my joints stiffened; for the day's work that lay behind me
had been enormous. By the time Bissa-tee joined me, I was moving
about painfully. She recommended a rest, speaking sharply, as though
she noticed my condition only now, and with alarm; there was another
hour of daylight left. I, thinking chiefly of her--for she had lost
considerably more weight than I--acquiesced; I was willing enough not
to exert myself; and I will admit I dropped without replying. This
was bad; I had more than once reflected upon the desirability, if not
the absolute necessity, of observing the strictest forms of
politeness all the more punctiliously when any discourtesy on my part
was apt to be interpreted as pointing directly against the only
companion I had left. I saw Bissa-tee darkening. But, instead of
feeling compunction on account of my rudeness, I resented the
interpretation she put upon my silence. Any over-exertion which is
continuously repeated has this demoralizing effect. Half an hour
later I felt suddenly as though it were absolutely necessary to cross
the brook at once; and, gathering every remaining ounce of my
strength, I rose and signified as much. But by this time Bissa-tee
had reached that state of stiffness in which I had been when she
arrived. She groaned as she rose; seeing which, I scented somewhat
impatiently that we might as well stay for the night. She was
obstinate now and painfully moved on to the ford. From the way she
moved I concluded that she would never be able to take those
desperate leaps from stone to stone which were required. I, using the
scent of supreme command, gave the order to postpone the crossing to
the next day, impersonally, as though the order were addressed to an
army; and simultaneously I turned to search for a hollow suitable to
spend the night in. Bissa-tee had hesitated; then, I having meanwhile
found a place, she followed me resentfully. Neither of us gave a
scent. We did not even wish each other good-night. There being
nothing to eat, we dropped and were instantly asleep.</p>

<p>That night it rained; and next morning the brook carried a turbid
flood which covered all the stones: for a whole week it was
impossible to effect a crossing.</p>

<p>During that week the relationship between Bissa-tee and myself--a
relationship which could no longer be that between a commander and an
inferior officer--slowly disintegrated. I remember how, the first
morning, we both stood on the bank and looked out over the flood. No
signal, no scent passed between us. But both of us wept. Had we
crossed last night, we should now have been well on the way. But
Bissa-tee's attitude conveyed an unmistakable reproach. "I was
willing to go on," it seemed to say. "You prevented me; and now see
what has come of it." I was thinking of the fact that, when I had
arrived at the brook, I had had to wait for Bissa-tee; had she not
lagged behind, neither of us would have stopped. We turned in silence
and began to search for such food as we could find, each for herself.
It was little enough, very unpalatable, and not sufficiently
nutritious to repair a day's loss of strength.</p>

<p>Thus the time went by; the brook subsided and then swelled once
more, as a consequence of another rain. Every now and then I caught
Bissa-tee, now recovered to a point to which I, being so much older,
could not recover any longer, looking wistfully across the brook and
scanning the horizon; and I knew that she was blaming me in her
heart. How I knew I cannot tell. Perhaps it is simply ant-nature to
judge your fellow by yourself.</p>

<p>Towards the seventh evening the brook showed once more signs of
subsiding. But then the sky clouded over again; and though I kept a
furtive eye on these clouds myself, I resented it in Bissa-tee that
she, ostentatiously I thought, climbed a hummock to look about. For a
while I merely looked on, darkening slowly; but at last, when my
anger had reached an explosive pressure, I emitted a faint scent of
rally. I did this only to relieve myself; I never thought the scent
would reach Bissa-tee. But it did, and she veered around, snarling. I
will throw a scent-screen over the scene that followed. For more than
an hour we indulged in mutual recriminations. Both of us were partly
in the right; and that fact blinded us to that other fact that we
were both wholly in the wrong. At last we ceased from sheer
exhaustion; for, though we had found little bits of food, tiny moulds
and fungi which, however, caused us severe digestive disturbances, we
were very weak; and at no time did we, up to the day of Bissa-tee's
death, succeed in recuperating to the full measure of our natural
strength.</p>

<p>An hour or so before dark I retired to our temporary quarters,
angry and despondent, but at the same time longing for comfort and
companionship, longing for Bissa-tee to come and make it up. She did
at last; slowly and shame-facedly she came in; touching me with her
antenn&aelig;. Both of us felt stirred to our depths; and we begged
forgiveness from each other, blaming fate, blaming the state we were
in; feeling sorry for each other, feeling sorry for ourselves.</p>

<p>The amazing thing was that, half an hour later, we had somehow
crossed the brook. We spent the night on the far bank; and for a few
days all went well; we were most solicitous of each other; carefully
we avoided any cause of possible disagreement; we rehearsed to each
other the sum of our findings as though we were anxious only to make
sure that, no matter what happened to either of us, should one
survive, they would not perish.</p>

<p>But under the extreme exertions of our ever-slowing
forward-thrust, and under the privations which we had to endure, our
mutual solicitude slowly waned again; once more it was each for
herself; our communicativeness merged again into a sullen
taciturnity; more and more frequently one of us lagged behind while
the other ostentatiously pushed forward; the latter blamed the former
for delaying progress; the lagging one blamed the other for a lack of
consideration. The resentment was borne till it had again reached
explosive pressure; and then a quarrel ensued, more violent from time
to time and the more demoralizing the less our state of exhaustion
permitted us to give vent to our feelings.</p>

<p>Thus matters went from bad to worse; the weaker we grew, the more
of our resentment remained unexpressed on each occasion; and what
remained unexpressed naturally formed the starting point and nucleus
of a new quarrel.</p>

<p>And then we were back in the country of the Ecitons. There,
certain findings of ours had been recorded on conspicuously marked
trees. Without any express agreement we arranged our marches, which
were night marches now, in such a way as to lead us through familiar
territory; and as we found that we succeeded beyond our boldest
hopes, picking up station after station where, six years ago, we had
spent a night or rested for some time, a false semblance of strength
returned to us. A great hope beckoned: the hope of finding the
friendly formicary of Angza-alla-antra where, we felt sure, we should
find rest and food aplenty. This hope united us once more; we
struggled on in an almost cheerful spirit. On, on, and on. We
conversed again; we even laughed at the idea that, six years ago, we
had marched over this same territory, 10,162 strong; and that now we
were just two!</p>

<p>On, on, and on. Marching at night; resting in daytime. And
then--we were already far into the northern part of the isthmus--I
had a terrible revelation. Bissa-tee, my intimate friend, the
companion of all my adventures, was turning traitress!</p>

<p>Though we had struggled on more cheerfully, we had not had
anything like a sufficiency of food for months and months. We were
mere skeletons; I venture to say that what we now called a night's
march would have been little more than an hour's march two years ago.
Somehow Bissa-tee had become habituated; mostly we halted because it
was I who could not go on. Bissa-tee had often energy enough left to
hunt for some sort of food, unsuitable though it might be: Beltian
bodies or a little honey or a rare, rare fungus. Whatever she found,
I suppose, she meant to share fairly; the fact remained that,
whenever she found a supply, she fed on the spot and brought me what
was left. How much was needed to support life we had to guess at, for
we had long since ceased to feel the pangs of hunger. But it was a
fact that Bissa-tee recovered to a certain extent: she was gaining in
strength now, if not in weight, while I was still falling off.</p>

<p>At any rate, on the morning on which I made the fateful discovery
I had been unable to proceed before the sun rose; and Bissa-tee had
rather cheerfully advised me to rest in the crotch of a tree; she
herself would go and hunt for food. So far, whenever we had done
this, I had promptly gone to sleep; but it so happened that this
morning my inability to proceed arose, not so much from excess of
fatigue as from a sore foot which pained me badly. So I watched
Bissa-tee as she climbed to the ground; and it struck me right then
that, the moment she reached the earth, she turned back, not like one
who is searching at random, but like one who knows exactly where she
is going and what she is after.</p>

<p>Within half an hour she reached a tree north of the resting-place;
and she promptly began to run round and round that tree, in an upward
spiral, <i>rescenting a record.</i> There could be no doubt. The tree
was one of those on which, six years ago, we had scented our
findings. In my preoccupation with the difficult task of moving I had
overlooked it in passing. At once the question flashed through my
mind how often a similar thing might not have happened before this,
when I had been sound asleep. I watched for Bissa-tee's return; if
this was an isolated first occurrence, she would naturally at the
first opportunity tell me about it; if she did not, I should have
proof that she had done the same thing before and was hiding her
purpose from me. Her purpose? There must be a purpose. What was it?
There was one explanation, and one only: she counted on returning
home <i>alone</i> and was making sure that she had all our findings.
Why was she counting on returning home alone? Was she predicting an
early death for me? From natural causes? Or was she going to make
sure that I did not return with her? I was in a state of tremendous
excitement. I felt suddenly so tired that I could not have slept; and
yet I should have been willing to go to sleep never to rise again. I
was weary, weary of life, of everything.</p>

<p>Bissa-tee came back to my resting place and, bringing a small
supply of food, wakened me; at least she thought she did. Even then
the possibility struck me that she might be administering to me a
slow, wasting poison. I did not care. I accepted her regurgitation. I
was bound to sound her treason to its utmost depth. For she did not
volunteer the slightest hint of her discovery. That secret of the
scent-tree she meant to keep to herself. I could have wept.</p>

<p>What can I say? We went on next night, on, on, and on; and the
overnext night and every following night, covering less and less
ground in every succeeding march; for I did not rest any longer; I
watched. Occasionally I saw, late in the night, towards morning, a
scent-tree which we had marked on our way out; and intentionally I
did not call Bissa-tee's attention to it but proceeded a short
distance before I signified my desire to rest for the day.
Invariably, as soon as she thought I was asleep, Bissa-tee returned
to it and rescented its contents. Never once did she mention the fact
to me. But now I waited on my part till, having returned, she went to
sleep and then hurried down to rescent the tree myself. This in turn
exhausted my strength and retarded our progress. Again several months
went by.</p>

<p>And then, one morning when we climbed a tree to find a
halting-place, I saw the gleam of water ahead: this was the noble
lake at the north end of which we had enjoyed Angza-alla-antra's
hospitality. All thought of rest was gone, of course. I communicated
my discovery to Bissa-tee; and though the country swarmed with
Ecitons, she did not hesitate a moment. Food, rest, help, and proper
nursing were within our grasp: we must proceed at once.</p>

<p>In the course of four more hours of a slow, weary march we arrived
at the head of the lake. The Wawaqueensic colony, as both of us
remembered with the utmost distinctness, had been situated a few
thousand antlengths south-east of a rock rising sheer out of the
waters of the lake; and we saw this rock to our left. Having reached
it, we took our bearings with the greatest care; we could not afford
to waste a motion. We were surprised not to have met any Wawaqueenses
so far; for their favourite foraging grounds had been near this rock.
But we reflected that quite likely they had shifted the scene of
their activities to the east or the south.</p>

<p>After a short rest we went on, holding anxiously to the line on
which we had decided. Every three or four antlengths we had to halt
now; for my exhaustion was extreme; and I could no longer take twenty
paces at a time. And then, directly in the line of our slow advance,
we saw the mound. My heart sank; for no ants were going out to, or
returning from, their labours. Yet we went silently forward; and at
last we reached the first of the main entrance craters on the flat
top of the hill.</p>

<p>To our infinite disappointment and grief we found the burrow a
perfectly desolate habitation. There were the chambers, it is true;
but they were slowly caving in; and there was no sign of a
fungus-garden; there was no trace of the once populous tribe that had
inhabited it; there was not even a scented record of where they might
be found. It would be impossible to describe our sensations after
entering this abode: both Bissa-tee and I shed tears.</p>

<p>In our first dismay we simply let ourselves drop to the floor of
the last chamber which we had entered in the hope of finding at least
a survivor. Neither of us slept; yet sleep, and though it had been a
never-ending sleep, would have been the most welcome gift.</p>

<p>But Bissa-tee, who was not nearly as much exhausted as myself,
soon began to stir. I did not know what her purpose might be; I did
not care. Not without bitterness I thought that, if she was going to
hunt for the kind of food on which we had been subsisting, she would
most likely return too late to rescue me; but that did not matter,
either: I had never withheld from her a single item of our findings;
her memory was excellent; and if, perhaps, it did not serve her quite
as well as mine did me, at least for the earlier phases of our
expedition, she had recently refreshed it by her rescentings of the
records left behind. I had now referred everything that happened to
us for so long to this one aim only, to take safely home the results
of our long and arduous labours, that my own personal fate weighed
very light in the balance; and, for the moment at any rate, I only
wanted to be left to myself.</p>

<p>Yet, when Bissa-tee returned from her first absence, I accepted
regurgitation; but I am afraid I did so in an impatient, ungracious
way. Bissa-tee, however, took no notice of it and promptly went out
again.</p>

<p>The scanty food which I had imbibed had at least the effect that
it put me to sleep; it worked like a powerful soporific. In an
indistinct, shadowy way, however, I remained conscious, as though in
a dream, of a constant going and coming. When, many hours later, I
awoke to a full consciousness of my surroundings, I saw that
Bissa-tee had brought in a not inconsiderable quantity of
leaf-cuttings which, in one of the garden chambers, she was now
engaged in shredding.</p>

<p>I must remind my students of the fact that, before we left our
last station in the northern parts of the middle-west of the
continent, Azte-ca and Bissa-tee had filled their infrabuccal
chambers with large pellets of the hyph&aelig; of our fungus.
Azte-ca's pellet had perished with her; but Bissa-tee's, as I
mentioned at the time, was so tightly wedged in that we had found it
impossible to remove it. We had often tried, of course; for, had we
been able to propagate that seed, we should, at least in the south,
have had a permanent supply of food; all we should have needed to do
was to stop from time to time, to grow our fungi, and, when we moved
on again, to take a new pellet of the hyph&aelig; along. But, the
pellet having swollen and hardened, we had found it impossible to
remove it or even part of it from the chamber; to get it out, a major
operation, namely, the removal of the tongue, including the salivary
glands, would have been necessary. Although I am no surgeon,
Bissa-tee had more than once proposed that, under her direction, I
should perform that operation. Three considerations had kept me from
doing so. Firstly, we had no orderlies left; and they, as is well
known, are chosen for the aseptic properties of their saliva; to
perform a major operation without proper asepsis seemed too risky to
me. Secondly, I feared that the scar-tissue which must form over the
wound would deprive the opening of the infrabuccal chamber of the
elasticity necessary for the retention of further pellets of
hyph&aelig;, so that we should indeed have had a single supply of the
fungi during our retreat, but no more. Thirdly, we both had our
doubts whether the hyph&aelig;, after having been carried so long
tightly compressed, still retained their viability; the small chance
of their doing so did not seem to justify the risks involved. It was
true that, with regard to the second objection, Bissa-tee had argued
that I might leave the pellets of the three royal perfumes behind and
charge myself with the task of carrying the hyph&aelig;. This I had
been unwilling to do for two reasons. In the first place, I had still
expected I might be in need of these pellets, at least of one of
them. In case of an encounter with Ecitons, I could, if alone, defeat
any number of enemies by exposing the pellet of the royal perfume of
instant death; for I myself, having carried that other pellet, of the
perfume of royal favour, for so many years, was impregnated with it
to such a degree as to be immune from the effects of the mortal
perfume; though any companion of mine would most probably have shared
the fate of the Ecitons. In the second place, I felt that, if I left
them behind, they would cause another disaster like that worked by
the exposure of the body of that officer who had first given me proof
of Assa-ree's treasonable practices; in fact, the slaughter of all
antdom over a considerable area would have borne an even worse
aspect; for the pellet of supreme command would have deprived the
death of hundreds of millions of ants of its character of suicide; it
would have changed it into murder on my part. For all these reasons I
was still carrying the pellets; and Bissa-tee, the ball of
hyph&aelig;.</p>

<p>But when I saw her shredding the leaf-cuttings, I knew of course
that she had made up her mind to induce or even to force me to
perform the operation; and by this time things had come to such a
pass that I did not see how I could refuse. Dark thoughts accompanied
the recognition of this necessity. Bissa-tee had turned traitress: if
she insisted on having the operation performed, she was going to do
so, not to save me, but to save herself. She was younger than I was.
She stood a better chance to reach home than I did. On that she was
counting. I could not imagine that her treason extended to the point
where she would actually kill me; she was not a murderess; but she
was not unwilling to let nature take her course with me after she had
done her utmost to keep me alive long enough to have my help in
carrying the fungi which she could no longer carry till home was
within reach. On the way out it had taken us a year or longer to
reach our present station. We knew the road now; and no further
explorations were going to cause delay. It would take us perhaps
nine, perhaps only six months to get home. Was I likely to survive
another six months? I thought I was; but perhaps she did not share
that belief; and she was a medical ant.</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts during that day and the three days that
followed; for the leaf-shreds had to shrink and to decay before they
would support the fungi.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning, having fed me by regurgitation, she
approached me with her demand. I conscented. Nothing else could be
done. She gave me the clearest and minutest directions; and apart
from these no communication was exchanged. Then she placed herself in
the most favourable position; and in a few minutes I was at work.</p>

<p>The operation was highly successful. When it was finished, I
removed the ball of hyph&aelig; and at once tore it apart and placed
the best of the roots in contact with the leaf-shreds. Before evening
they had begun to grow; but Bissa-tee lay expiring. She had felt sure
she would survive; but one of the last things she communicated to me
was that, no doubt as a consequence of the utter lack of proper
grooming during the last year or two, the wound had turned septic.
Then she went on to tell me that she had, of late, often rescented
the records which we had left behind on our way out without telling
me about it; she had wished, so she averred, to save me all
unnecessary trouble; but she wished now to give me a condensed
report. This she did. Whether, in this her most solemn hour, she
spoke truth or whether she was impelled by an unquiet conscience to
give up her secret, I do not know and do not care to surmise. She
died by night.</p>

<p>Next morning I had my first meal of fungi. I remained at this
station for a full moon. When I set out again, I had discarded two of
the three pellets of the royal perfumes and retained only that of
instant death; instead of the others I carried a very small ball of
fungus hyph&aelig;.</p>

<p>Five months later I arrived at home.</p>

<center>
<p>Note on the habitat and mode of life of Atta Gigantea</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As far as is known, the geographical distribution of Atta Gigantea
is limited to the interior of central and southern Venezuela and of
the northernmost provinces of Brazil where the latter drain into the
Orinoco basin.</p>

<p>Atta Gigantea lives in huge, partly hypergean, partly subterranean
structures. Most of their older cities number hundreds of thousands
of ants. Like all ants they are polymorphic, that is, each tribe is
composed of a queen and three castes: the maxims, the medi&aelig;,
and the minims. The maxims are the leaders and organizers; the
medi&aelig;, the ordinary outdoor workers or leaf-cutters; the minims
the indoor workers who attend to the culture of the fungi on which
the Attas feed.</p>

<p>Their burrows are many-chambered, the upper ones serving, as it
were, as residences; those only slightly below the surface of the
ground, as brood-chambers; the deepest, for their fungus-gardens.</p>

<p>Armies of the medi&aelig;, every day, repair to certain acacia
trees where they swarm into the foliage to cut circular disks of the
leaves which they carry home, to be shredded by the minims and to be
inoculated with the hyph&aelig; or spores of the fungus which grows
on them. All work is directed and supervised by the maxims.</p>

<p>In their fungus-gardens the leafy substratum forms a huge spongy
mass which can be penetrated only by the minute minims who weed and
cultivate the fungi and see to it that they remain at a uniform,
optimal temperature. To the latter end they open or close
perpendicular passages used for no other purpose. Except as a measure
of warfare against man no trees but Acacias are ever attacked; and a
tree despoiled of its foliage is given time to recuperate before it
is attacked again. This fact constitutes the whole race a truly
agricultural tribe. As the book proves, their civilization is of the
highest order.</p>
