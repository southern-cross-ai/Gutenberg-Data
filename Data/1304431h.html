Interior Discovery in New South Wales</em>.</strong> By Allan
Cunningham, Esq. Communicated by Viscount Goderich&mdash;Read
27th February and 12th March, 1832.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="a">From:</span> <big>Journal of
the Royal Geographical Society of London</big><br>
<br>
Volume 2, 1832, pages 99-132.</p>
<p><span class="a">Amidst</span> the ardour with which
geographical research has been patronized and prosecuted in
almost every other portion of the globe, it is a subject of
surprise and regret that so little anxiety should have been shown
by geographers, and even by men of science in general, to
increase our knowledge of the interior of the Australian
continent. But so it is,&mdash;that land of anomalies may still
be said to be almost a <i>terra incognita</i>; and, limited as
may be the information which we possess of its internal features,
yet, with the conviction that some concise notice of the way in
which that knowledge has been progressively acquired will not
prove altogether uninteresting to the Geographical Society, I beg
to lay before it, in a brief view, the results of the several
expeditions, which have been employed in inland discovery since
the first settlement was formed at Port Jackson; to which I have
added, a few occasional remarks on the different routes which
have been pursued, and which will be further illustrated by the
accompanying map.</p>
<p>To that fine settlement, in whose internal prosperity and
advancement I have, during my long residence among its
inhabitants, ever felt a lively interest, I shall consider myself
as having rendered no small service, if what may appear in the
following pages should induce this society to promote, by such
means as it may have at command, the more extensive examination
of the interior of New South Wales. We possess colonies, on its
eastern and western shores, which are daily exciting more and
more interest in this country; and, should the tide of emigration
continue to flow, as it has done for some years past, new land
must be thrown open to meet the wants of the settlers.</p>
<p>It would appear that, from the earliest periods of the
settlement at Port Jackson, there were not wanting individuals of
skill and enterprise to undertake the task of inland
discovery,&mdash;of whom it may suffice to mention the names of
Bass, Caley, and Barrallier. But their utmost endeavours to
penetrate beyond the Blue Mountains were entirely defeated by the
difficulties with which they had to contend, and which,
ultimately, obliged each party, after suffering great fatigue and
privation, to return with the full conviction of the utter
impossibility of passing to the westward of so formidable a
barrier,&mdash;an opinion, which appeared, at that period, not a
little supported by the fact, that such of the aborigines as had
become known to the colonists, were totally ignorant of any pass
to the interior, through that elevated chain of mountains.</p>
<p>A period of twenty-five years thus passed away without any
information being gained as to the breadth of the Blue
Mountain-ranges westerly, or the aspect of the country beyond
them. At length, in 1813, the colonists were visited by a most
distressing season of drought, in which the country, from the
sea-coast to the base of the hills, was burnt up&mdash;the
secondary water-courses entirely failed, and the cattle of the
colonists, hemmed in on all sides, died in great numbers for want
of pasturage. Out of evil how often does good arise!&mdash;for
these most distressing circumstances were the means of opening
the country, and saving the colonists. Three enterprising
individuals, Messrs. Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson, were
induced, at this period, to unite and employ their best exertions
and experience, in making one other attempt to penetrate through
that chain of mountains, which had been considered, for so many
years, an impregnable barrier. With this determination they
ascended the mountains near the Grose River (a tributary to the
Hawkesbury), and by keeping steadily in view, that, which no
preceding explorer had ever once thought of, namely, the fall of
the waters into the Warragumba on the one side, and into the
Grose on the other, they maintained their position on a main
range, which although, from its intricate windings, it oftentimes
obliged them to follow a course opposite to that which they had
intended to pursue, nevertheless enabled them, by adhering to it
closely, eventually to penetrate to a distance of twenty-five
geographical miles, <i>due west</i>, from the Nepean River, to a
terminating <i>point</i> in those mountains. After having
traversed a bleak and dreary waste, by a route exceeding fifty
miles in length, it may be readily conceived with what joy these
laborious travellers beheld, from the rugged brow of this
precipice, a grassy, well-watered vale, which appeared to extend
some miles to the westward,&mdash;a failure of provisions,
however, obliged the party to retrace their steps back to the
colony. On this occasion, their example being followed up by Mr.
W. Evans, Assistant Surveyor, by order of the Government, that
fine pastoral country, the Downs of Bathurst, and the rivers
Macquarie and Lachlan, were shortly afterwards discovered. During
the following year (1814) a practicable line of road was
constructed, by convict labour, over mountain-ridges, which in
some parts have been since ascertained to be three thousand four
hundred feet above the level of the sea; and thus was thrown open
that extensive range of sheep and cattle pasturage, which has
since been of such immense value to the colony.</p>
<p>The encouraging results which attended this enterprise,
naturally suggested the propriety of sending an expedition to
explore the newly-discovered streams, which, although they were
nearly eighty miles asunder at the points where they were first
met, it was nevertheless expected would be found to unite in the
interior, and become a river of considerable magnitude, running
to the sea. The late Surveyor-General, Mr. Oxley, was accordingly
dispatched, in the winter of 1817, to trace, in the first place,
the course of the Lachlan; and, having myself just arrived in the
colony, I most gladly accepted an invitation to join, under so
able and intelligent an officer, the first expedition which was
undertaken for the purpose of exploring the interior of the
Australian continent.</p>
<p>The River Lachlan, as will be remembered, was followed by the
party through a flat inhospitable country, and so far from its
forming a junction with the Macquarie, it was found not to
receive even a single tributary stream in any part of its long
and tortuous course, which, with great patience and perseverance,
Mr. Oxley explored beyond the westernmost range of hills to an
interior, a dead level, forming a chain of plains, which appeared
alone bounded by the horizon&mdash;their ample surface bearing
the very evident proofs of being, in seasons of continued rains,
extensively inundated. Over these Australian <i>steppes</i>,
which were not more than two hundred and fifty feet above the
level of the sea, Mr. Oxley pushed his way westerly, in his
further examination of this river; and, notwithstanding the slimy
nature of their surface, and the distressed condition of his
horses, he was, nevertheless, enabled to continue his journey
upwards of one hundred miles to the westward of the last rise or
hill-like undulation of that part of the interior, before his
progress was arrested by extensive and impassable morasses, the
river (if worthy of the name at that extremity of his journey)
having divided itself into several small channels, and its water
having become perfectly stagnant, and unfit for use. This
termination of the labours of the expedition, westerly, occurred
in longitude 144½° E.; and during the stay of the party at that
remote station, besides the many astronomical observations which
were taken to determine its position, the rising amplitude was
observed, as at sea, which gave 7° 25' easterly variation. Of the
extent of those vast levels the party could form no just idea. In
the direction in which the expedition had proceeded down the
river, namely, from N.E. to S.W., a chain of plains, destitute of
trees, extended for upwards of one hundred and thirty miles; and,
at right angles with that line of bearing, namely, from N.W. to
S.E., the flat country appeared alone terminated by the horizon.
Still, however, it must be observed, that where the mind and the
sight are alike fatigued by the monotonous character of the view
around, the traveller naturally becomes impressed with the idea
that the extent of the open country he is traversing, is far
greater than it is in reality.</p>
<p>With a reduced stock of provisions, and at a distance of more
than four hundred miles inland from the colony, Mr. Oxley
commenced his journey homeward, little thinking, that could he
have penetrated but twenty miles farther to the S.W., he would
have arrived at the Morrumbidgee River, at that time not known in
any part of its course, and only recently ascertained (although
long-supposed) to receive the drainings of the Lachlan Marshes.
It may here be worthy of remark, that, in retracing their steps
over those wet unhealthy levels to the hills which skirted them
on their eastern side, Mr. Oxley and his party repeatedly
witnessed, in the morning before the sun had risen many degrees
above the horizon, the singular appearance of the <i>mirage</i>,
or the extraordinary effect of refraction upon those apparently
unbounded plains. In one direction they beheld, with surprise,
the few straggling trees, the line of which separated one expanse
of plain from another, with their rounded heads suspended in the
air, being apparently separated from their trunks by a watery
medium; whilst in another were distinctly traced, on the verge of
the distant horizon, an outline of hills, with pointed or conical
summits, and bluff precipitous terminations. These, however, had
no actual existence; for, no sooner had the day advanced, than
the cones became truncated&mdash;the aërial ridge began to break
and dissolve, and the whole soon afterwards disappeared. After a
severe march of six days, the travellers regained the rising
grounds, and crossing the Lachlan with some difficulty, by means
of a raft, they quitted that turbid stream altogether, which had
become suddenly swollen by floods from the eastward. The party
now shaped a more northern course homewards, than they otherwise
would have done, in hopes of meeting with the long-lost Macquarie
River, which they had not seen since they quitted Bathurst, the
downs of which it waters. All travellers, in exploring new tracts
of country, are subjected more or less to sudden vicissitudes: in
this expedition to trace the source of the Lachlan, these were
numerous, and oftentimes of a distressing character. The simple
mention of one of these changes, arising out of the circumstances
of the country, may here suffice. Five weeks were employed in
traversing those steppes over which the waters of the Lachlan are
dispersed, and on no one occasion, during that period, did the
party meet with a dry spot, on which to encamp at the close of
the day. On the contrary, comfortless as it really was, still,
having been for sometime accustomed to accommodate themselves to
circumstances, they cheerfully sought repose from the fatigues of
the day, upon any part of those wet plains, where exhaustion, and
the approaching night, had obliged them to halt.</p>
<p>On leaving the right bank of the Lachlan, however, Mr. Oxley
entered on a country, in point of character, the very reverse of
that which he had recently quitted. For nearly a hundred miles
the expedition had to encounter those privations, which are
inevitable in a tract of country, where, from extreme sterility,
neither water nor pasturage for the horses could occasionally be
found; and where the surface, although somewhat elevated above
the low plains, which the travellers had just left, being, for a
considerable extent, of a light, red, sandy soil, was only
capable of producing a scrubby vegetation, alone interesting to
the botanist. At length, however, upon passing to the eastward of
those arid regions, they leached a better country, and one that
improved daily as they advanced. Hills lightly wooded, and grassy
to their very summits, appeared before them: these were found to
furnish springs, which formed small rivulets in the adjoining
valleys, in one of which, of considerable extent and romantic
appearance, to which the name of Wellington was given, they
found, with no small satisfaction, a river, flowing silently to
the N.W. This was the Macquarie, so long the object of their
search. The discovery of this river, at a distance of one hundred
miles to the north-west of Bathurst, in a measure recompensed the
travellers for all their toils on the Lachlan; and Mr. Oxley's
report of it to the local government, inducing the hope that it
would, when increased by other tributary Streams, find its way to
the sea, a new expedition was directed, in the winter of the
following year, to explore it downwards Irom Wellington
Valley.</p>
<p>Great expectations were entertained from this second
expedition, and the disappointment, therefore, was severe, when
the Macquarie was traced to a low marshy interior, in a
north-westerly direction; where the hills again disappeared, and
the country becoming 'perfectly level', the flooded river eluded
further pursuit, by spreading its waters far and wide, between
the compass-points of N.W. and N.E. This expanse of shoal water
our indefatigable Surveyor-General explored in a boat, amidst
reeds of such height, that having at last 'totally lost sight of
land and trees', he was obliged to return to the party which he
had left encamped on Mount Harris&mdash;a detached hill on the
river's bank, elevated about two bundled feet above the plane of
the neighbouring flats. Having thus followed the Macquarie also
to a reedy morass, of apparently unbounded extent, beyond which
(in a westerly direction) it was, at that period, perfectly
impossible to penetrate, Mr. Oxley determined (with such means as
he had at command) to prosecute his discoveries easterly, in the
parallel 31° 15', in which latitude his examination of the river
had terminated. In that most arduous portion of his journey, he
encountered numerous difficulties before he was fully enabled to
emerge from the marshes, to firmer and more elevated grounds. In
his progress easterly, Liverpool Plains, and a hilly,
picturesque, and well-watered country were discovered, and he
reached the coast at Port Macquarie, in 31½° S. latitude; from
which the expedition returned southerly along shore to Port
Jackson. Highly important to the colony as were these
acquisitions to its geographical knowledge, still the result of
the last researches, respecting the termination of the Macquarie,
seem, for a time, to have damped the ardour of the Colonial
Government for further discoveries in the interior.</p>
<p>Up to that period, (1819) the colonists knew nothing of the
southern country, beyond the cow-pastures, where that extensive
patch of thicket, called the 'Bargo-brush', formed a boundary,
which had not been penetrated. At length, about this time, both
that and the Wombat-brush, in Argyle, were passed, and a third
river flowing inland, and called by the aborigines
'Morrumbidgee', was discovered. Minor excursions were immediately
afterwards made by individuals into that interesting country,
where many fine tracts of land were found, which have since
proved of great value to the grazier. It was not, however, until
the winter of 1823, that an extensive tract of undulated country,
clear of timber, and watered by the Morrumbidgee, was discovered
by a party, conducted by an officer of the navy, at a point
nearer to its source than had before been seen. This open
country, which was named, upon its discovery, 'Brisbane Downs',
the travellers learnt from a tribe of natives was called in
aboriginal language, 'Monaroo'; and its extent was described by
the Indians as very considerable. These fine sheep-walks were
ascertained, by accurate observations, to lie immediately to the
eastward of the meridian of 149°, and were found to extend
upwards of forty miles to the southward of the parallel of 36°
15', which appears to be the latitude of their northern skirts.
They are further described as being bounded on the east by the
coast range of hills, which give an interior direction to the
course of the streams, by which they are permanently watered; and
on their western side, by those lofty mountains, now known by the
native name Warragong.</p>
<p>The elevation of Brisbane Downs, above the sea-shore (distant
from them to the eastward about seventy miles), although it has
never been measured, cannot be less than two thousand feet; and
as they are in higher latitude than other portions of land,
within the present boundaries of the colony, the climate may
probably be found more congenial to the growth of wool and the
constitution of sheep, than that of those extensive tracts of
pastoral country, from which the colonists are annually obtaining
so many thousand fleeces for the English market. The mean height
of any one point of the great Warragong Chain, which appears to
extend without interruption to Wilson's Promontory (the
southernmost extremity of the Australian continent), has not yet
been determined. That portion, however, of what may be called the
backbone of the country, is, probably, of greater elevation above
the level of the ocean than any other * range of mountains along
the eastern coast, either within or beyond the tropic, since its
summit is not simply covered with snow during the winter months,
but has been seen perfectly white at other seasons of the
year.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Whilst engaged at Moreton Bay (to the north of
Port Jackson), in the winter of 1828, I penetrated to the base of
a range of mountains bearing S.S.W. about sixty miles from that
penal settlement.</p>
<p class="foot">The principal summit of that range, which was
named at the time 'Mount Lindesay', I ascertained, by
trigonometry, to be four thousand seven hundred and fifty feet
above the plane of the country on which it stood, and the spot I
had encamped on; and this latter I found, by the mean of several
barometrical observations, to be nine hundred and fifty-three
feet above the shoves of Moreton Bay: thus making the mean height
of 'Mount Lindesay' five thousand seven hundred feet above the
level of the sea,&mdash;an elevation by far the most considerable
that has been measured and ascended by Europeans in that
country.]</p>
<p>At the same time that these important geographical researches
were carrying on in the southern parts of the colony, I was
occupied with a party in the elevated country on the north of
Bathurst, in which direction, at a distance of fifty miles from
that settlement, the Cudgeegong, a tributary to the Macquarie,
had been previously discovered, and stock stations erected on its
banks.</p>
<p>In my excursion through that mountainous country, I succeeded
not only in effecting a clear, well-defined route for the grazier
to Liverpool Plains from Bathurst, but also in bringing the
settlers of the latter district in direct communication with
those farmers, who had taken their lands on Hunter's River.</p>
<p>The year 1824 had nearly passed away without the smallest
addition being made to the knowledge already acquired of the
interior country to the south of Port Jackson. Towards its close,
however, Messrs. Hovell and Hume, two enterprising agriculturists
(and the latter a native of the colony, possessing a considerable
local knowledge), undertook a journey in a south-westerly
direction from Argyle, with the design of reaching the sea-coast
near Bass' Strait, and of ascertaining the nature of the
intermediate country, of which the colonists, at that time, knew
absolutely nothing. In their outfit for such an arduous
excursion, the Colonial Government afforded but a partial
assistance. Their more perfect equipment was derived from their
own farms; and the results therefore of their tour claimed for
them, very justly, the greater share of merit. Our travellers
took their departure from a stock-station near Lake George, with
the intention of pursuing a direct course to the south-west. This
line of route, however, led them into great and insurmountable
difficulties, for they soon found themselves entangled in a range
of mountains connected with those of the Morrumbidgee, through
which they could not possibly penetrate. They, however, soon
perceived, that the only way by which they could extricate
themselves and cattle from their difficulties, without being
absolutely obliged to retrace their steps to the point whence
they had originally set out, was to proceed, in the first
instance, more to the westward, before they attempted to make any
southing. This they effected without material injury to their
burdened cattle, and having passed to the westward of the
meridian of 148°, they found no further impediments in their
route to the south-west, having broadly on their left hand, or a
little to the eastward of them, the great Warragong Chain. In
latitude 36°, the party crossed a river, which derived its source
from those snow-clad mountains, and was flowing with considerable
rapidity among the hills towards the north-west. To that stream,
which, in consequence of its depth and width, (exceeding one
hundred yards,) they had some difficulty in passing, they gave
the name of 'Hume'. Their journey was now conducted through a
fine, open, thinly-timbered country; its surface was, for the
most part, hilly, or moderately undulated, and occasionally, to
diversify the scene, there broke upon the view a patch of plain,
without a tree, but abundantly clothed with a grassy vegetation.
This pastoral country was found, even in the summer months, well
watered by streamlets from the hills around, the waters of which,
collecting, had formed a second river, to which our travellers
gave the name of 'the Ovens', upon fording it in latitude 36°
40'. This was described as being of less magnitude than the Hume,
but its stream was of equal velocity, and the direction given it
by a break in the hills, and the apparent inclination of the
country, was also to the north-west; in which bearing, wherever a
commanding position on the hills afforded the party a view, a
declining wooded country was observed, with scarcely a single
elevation.</p>
<p>Southerly, the land continued equally good, but rising in
altitude, presented a more broken, irregular surface to our
travellers, who, however, patiently surmounting the difficulties
which lay in their way, at length came to a third stream, to
which they gave the name of 'Goulburn'. This river, which was
formed by a junction of several streamlets, which came from the
hills to the eastward, ran southerly in the direction of the
course pursued by the expedition as far as latitude 37°, when it
also took a decided bend towards the north-west.</p>
<p>The exploring party now passed the meridian of 146°, and
beheld before them the coast range of hills. This proved to them
a source of no small encouragement to continue their journey, for
they had began to despair of reaching the sea-coast, in
consequence of the exhausted condition of their burdened beasts,
and of the loss which they had sustained in their stock of
provisions, by accidents and the great heat of the weather. A
beautiful country, however, appeared before them, and as it
exhibited an alternation of plain and woodland of like interest,
as affording an unlimited range of sheep and cattle pasture, they
had the more inducement to pursue their route to the southward
cheerfully; and this they did until at length they reached salt
water and a sandy shore.</p>
<p>On the 16th of December of the above year, Messrs. Hovell and
Hume arrived at the northern shore of what they considered
Western Port, notwithstanding they looked in vain for the large
island, which the charts show us lying within it. This was,
however, their mistake; for, without being aware of it, they had
actually effected more than had been originally expected of them,
for they had made the north-eastern side of Port Phillip&mdash;a
large bay on the south coast, half a degree to the westward of
the point at which they had supposed themselves at the time to
have arrived. Of this fact the late Mr. Oxley was assured, when
it was seen that their report of the extent of the Port they had
made on the coast, and the country to the northward of it, agreed
so fully with what was known of both from the year 1803; when
Port Phillip was visited by Mr. Charles Grimes, at that time
surveyor-general, who was sent to survey the harbour more
minutely than either Captain Flinders or the discoverer of it,
Lieutenant John Murray, R.N., were enabled, in the preceding
year, to effect.</p>
<p>In their journey back to the colony, which they immediately
commenced, Messrs. Hovell and Hume pursued a line of route
altogether to the westward of their outward-bound track; and
thus, by travelling on a much lower level, avoided entirely that
broken hilly country, which had proved so harassing to their
cattle in their former journey.</p>
<p>The extent to which this line of country will, doubtless, be
ere long occupied by the colonists, may be understood by
describing it as stretching south-westerly from 35° of latitude
to the shores of Port Phillip in 38°. The boundary, on its
eastern side, is a diagonal line, drawn from the meridian of
149°, as it passes the parallel of 35°, to longitude 145½°,
cutting the latitude of 38°; as that line will, most probably,
intersect the bluff terminating points of ridges, forming
abutments against the great eastern chain: whilst its western
limit may be defined by another diagonal line continued from
about 147°, where the parallel of 35° passes it, until it meets
the meridian of 145°, in latitude of 37°. The local knowledge of
which we are now in possession, induces us to view it as
extremely probable that, with the exception of any narrow belts
of alluvial land which may extend along the immediate banks of
the three rivers discovered by these travellers, a great extent
of low steril region exists to the westward of the last-mentioned
line of limitation, being, probably, a continuation of that arid
desert which is shown on Mr. Oxley's chart, lying between the
parallels of 33° and 35°, and under the meridians of 146° and
147°,&mdash;a country literally a perfect waste, entirely
destitute of water at any season, if we except those small
quantities of rain which occasionally fall and are caught in the
shallow excavations of sandstone rocks on the ridges, from which
alone the party of the expedition of 1817 derived their scanty
supply, after quitting their boats on the Lachlan River.</p>
<p>To that valuable tract of country, first laid open to our view
by the above-mentioned indefatigable persons, the attention of
future emigrants will, doubtless, be directed; since, from the
fact of its being bounded immediately on the east by the
Warragong Chain, no doubts can be entertained of its being found,
when occupied, far better watered than the country already
located, and less liable to the effects of those droughts which
have so frequently distressed the northern parts of the
colony,&mdash;its higher southern latitude giving it, as a
further recommendation, a cooler climate and one which more
resembles that of England.</p>
<p>With the exception of my examination of the western and
northern sides of Liverpool Plains in the month of May, 1825,
which enabled me to furnish something more than what had been
previously known of those extensive levels, our stock of
geographical knowledge received no accession during either that
or the following year. The year 1827, however, a new scene opened
to the colonists; for a journey which the late Mr. Oxley had
himself at one period contemplated, was determined on, viz., to
explore the entirely unknown country, lying on the western side
of the dividing range, between Hunter's River in latitude 32° and
Moreton Bay in latitude 27° S. For this purpose a well appointed
expedition, equipped fully for an absence of five months, was
placed by the Colonial Government under my direction.</p>
<p>On the 30th of April of that year, (1827,) having provided
myself with the necessary instruments,* and with an escort of six
servants and eleven horses, I took my departure from a station on
an upper branch of Hunter's River, and upon crossing the dividing
range to the westward, at a mean elevation above the level of the
sea of three thousand and eighty feet, I pursued my journey
northerly, through an uninteresting forest country, skirting
Liverpool Plains on their eastern side. As it is my intention to
lay before the public, erelong, a narrative of this journey,
which, in consequence of the long drought by which this part of
the country had suffered, cost my party no ordinary exertions, I
trust that an outline of it will now be sufficient.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Among these instruments was an excellent
portable mountain-barometer by Jones, which, by care, I succeeded
in carrying throughout the journey uninjured.]</p>
<p>On the 11th of May, we crossed (in latitude 31° 2') Mr.
Oxley's track easterly towards Port Macquarie in 1818, and from
that point the labours of the expedition commenced on ground
previously untrodden by civilized man. It was my original design
to have taken a fresh departure to the northward, from the point
at which the late Surveyor-General had passed the river named by
him the 'Peel', upon our reaching the above-mentioned parallel,
and which bore from a spot on which we had encamped, due east
about twelve miles: however, the intermediate country, although
Mr. Oxley had passed it, proved too elevated and rocky for my
heavily-burdened horses; and I was, therefore, obliged to
continue the course of the expedition to the north under the
meridian of our tents, (viz. 150½°,) being well aware that as the
final course of that river was towards the interior, we should
cross its channel whenever the chain of lofty hills which bounded
us on the east, and which appeared to stretch far to the north,
should either terminate or become so broken as to allow of its
escape through them to a lower level. Thus we continued our
journey to the north through a barren, but densely-timbered
country, of frequently brushy character, and altogether very
indifferently watered. Each day as we advanced, our barometer
showed us that these poor forest-grounds, which, to add to the
difficulty of penetration, were occasionally traversed by low
arid ridges of argillaceous ironstone and clayslate, rose in
elevation from the low level of the northern margin of Liverpool
Plains, which I found to be only eight hundred and forty feet
above the level of the sea. This rise of surface was, however,
most gradual; for, after a march of forty miles directly to the
north, we found on reaching the bank of a small stream, a branch
evidently of the Peel, that we had attained but a mean height of
one thousand nine hundred feet above the sea-coast&mdash;an
elevation which was too inconsiderable to produce any obvious
change for the better, either in the growth of the timber, the
nature of the soil, or of the scanty herbage. Through those
gloomy woods, with scarcely a trace of either Indian or kangaroo,
we patiently pursued our way until the 19th of May, when, upon
passing the parallel of 30°, we descended from some stony hills
to the head of a beautiful well-watered valley, affording
abundance of the richest pasturage, and bounded, on either side,
by a bold and elevated rocky range. This grassy vale we followed
northerly about sixteen miles to its termination at the left bank
of a large river, which, in seasons less unfavourable to
vegetation, appeared evidently a stream of considerable
magnitude. This was the Peel of Mr. Oxley; which, after pursuing
its course to the north for upwards of a degree of latitude from
the point at which that officer had passed it in 1818, had at
length forced its passage through a break in the eastern ranges,
and, passing the lower extremity of the valley in latitude 29°
51', flowed on towards an open country observed beyond it at
north-west. So considerable was the dip of the vale, along which
our route had extended, that we found ourselves in the channel of
this river, again nearly on the level of the northern or lower
sides of Liverpool Plains&mdash;the mean of the results of our
morning and evening observations of the barometer giving us only
nine hundred and eleven feet. The channel of the Peel, which, at
this period, exhibited a bed of gravel two hundred and fifty
yards in breadth, is, in seasons of long rains, entirely filled
by floods to the depth of twelve and fifteen feet, as was obvious
from the marks of those freshes on the upper banks. The long
continuance of dry weather, which had alike distressed the colony
and these distant parts of the interior, had, however, reduced
its stream to a mere rill, which we forded without difficulty.
Passing the channel of this river, by which a considerable tract
of broken mountainous country to the S.E. is drained, we resumed
our journey to the north, between the meridian of 150° and 151°.
Our course led us through a variety of country; for, on quitting
the river, we traversed a barren, brushy tract, which extended
more or less for fourteen miles; beyond, however, the land
materially improved, and as it was less encumbered with small
timber and more open to the action of the atmosphere, a
considerable growth of grass was produced. A succession of open
forest hills of moderate elevation, and narrow intermediate
valleys, with an occasional patch of plain, of a good soil,
characterised the line of country, which the expedition
afterwards crossed; and although the land (the mean elevation of
which did not exceed eleven hundred feet) was, generally
speaking, rich, and productive of much grass, it was,
nevertheless, distressing to meet with tracts, many miles in
extent, entirely destitute of water. Traces of the natives were
frequent, although not of recent date. We met, however, with
neither the wandering Indian nor any description of animal, for
the parched state of vegetation and the distressed condition of
the country generally, had evidently driven both to other parts
of the interior, where the means of sustaining life were less
precarious, or, at least, where a permanent supply of water,
although it might be in a stagnant state, was to be obtained.
Hitherto our view towards the west had been circumscribed by a
continued chain of thinly-wooded ridges, which had extended,
northerly, parallel to the course we were daily pursuing. On
reaching the latitude of 29° 10', which we did on the 25th of the
month, all the hills to the westward of our line of route
terminated, and a level, open interior, of vast expanse, bounded
on the north and north-west by a distant horizon, broke suddenly
on our view! At north-west, more particularly, it was evident to
all of us that the country had a most decided dip, and on that
bearing, the line of sight extended over a great extent of
densely wooded, or brushed, land, the monotonous aspect of which
was here and there relieved by a brown patch of plain: of these
some were so remote as to appear a mere speck on the ocean of
land before us, on which the eye sought anxiously for a rising
smoke, as indicative of the presence of the wandering aborigines;
but in vain: for, excepting in the immediate neighbourhood of a
river of the larger magnitude, these vast solitudes may be fairly
said to be almost entirely without inhabitants. We had now all
the high grounds on our right hand, or to the east of us, and
before us, at north, a level, wooded country. With an anxious
curiosity to explore so extraordinary a region, we continued our
route on the 26th of May, from a rocky creek, where we had rested
upon some tolerable pasture. Our elevation above the sea-shore,
we found by our barometer to be one thousand two hundred and
twenty-eight feet, and we soon discovered that we had entered a
barren waste, over which was spread a loose sand, (the debris of
the prevalent rock formation of the eastern hills,) which gave it
a desert-like aspect. A blighted kind of the iron-bark tree,
(apparently Eucalyptus resinifera,) scarcely twenty-five feet
high, clothed its surface, on which were here and there
interspersed dense patches of underwood, composed of plants
formerly observed on the western skirts of Liverpool Plains. In
this stage of our journey we crossed the parallel of 29°, in
about the meridian of 150° 40'; and having very little
expectation of meeting with water, in any state, in so arid a
region, we were most agreeably surprised to find the channel of a
river from eighty to one hundred yards in width, winding its
course to the westward. This stream, which received the name of
Dumaresq's River, although greatly reduced by drought, presented,
nevertheless, a handsome piece of water, half a mile in length,
about thirty yards in width, and evidently very deep. My
barometer, which I set up on the gravelly bed of the river, gave
me only eight hundred and forty feet of elevation above the
sea-coast, from which we were distant to the westward about one
hundred and seventy English miles.</p>
<p>It was my full intention to have continued my course in the
direction of the meridian, at least to the parallel of 27°,
before I made the least easting towards the coast-line; this
design, however, the existing circumstances of the country we had
penetrated compelled me to abandon; for the great debility to
which the whole of my horses were reduced, by the labours of the
journey through a line of country parched up by the drought, at
once obliged me to pursue a more eastern course; in which
direction, upon gaining the higher lands, I could alone expect to
meet with a better pasture, than that on which they had for some
time subsisted.</p>
<p>On our new course to the northward and eastward, we had to
struggle through a desert waste for many miles, before we gained
a more undulated surface to the eastward of 151°, when the
country through which we journeyed for about thirty miles,
presented a succession of thinly wooded stony hills, or low
ridges of sandstone rock, separated from each other by narrow
valleys, in which my half-famished horses met with but scanty
subsistence. At length, on the 5th of June, having gained an
elevation of about nine hundred feet above the bed of Dumaresq's
River, we reached the confines of a superior country. It was
exceedingly cheering to my people, after they had traversed a
waste oftentimes of the most forbiddingly arid character, for a
space, more or less, of eighty miles, and had borne, with no
ordinary patience, a degree of privation to which I had well nigh
sacrificed the weaker of my horses&mdash;to observe, from a ridge
which lay in our course, that they were within a day's march of
open downs of unknown extent, which stretched, easterly, to the
base of a lofty range of mountains, distant, apparently, about
twenty-five miles. On the 6th and following day, we travelled
throughout the whole extent of these plains, to the foot of the
mountains extending along their eastern side, and the following
is the substance of my observations on their extent, soil, and
capability.</p>
<p>These extensive tracts of clear pastoral country, which were
subsequently named Darling Downs, in honour of his Excellency the
Governor, are situated in, or about, the mean parallel of 28° S.,
along which they stretch east, eighteen statute miles to the
meridian of 152°. Deep ponds, supported by streams from the
highlands, immediately to the eastward, extend along their
central lower flats; and these, when united, in a wet season,
become an auxiliary to Condamine's River&mdash;a stream which
winds its course along their south-western margin. The downs, we
remarked, varied in breadth in different parts of their
lengthened surface: at their western extremity they appeared not
to exceed a mile and a half, whilst towards their eastern limits,
their width might be estimated at three miles. The lower grounds,
thus permanently watered, present flats, which furnish an almost
inexhaustible range of cattle pasture at all seasons of the
year&mdash;the grasses and herbage generally exhibiting, in the
depth of winter, an extraordinary luxuriance of growth. From
these central grounds, rise downs of a rich, black, and dry soil,
and very ample surface; and as they furnish an abundance of
grass, and are conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the
reach of those floods, which take place on the flats in a season
of rains, they constitute a valuable and sound sheep pasture. We
soon reached the base of some hills, connected laterally with
that stupendous chain of mountains, the bold outline of which we
had beheld with so much interest during the three preceding days.
These hills we found clothed, from their foot upwards, with an
underwood of the densest description, in the midst of which, and
especially on the ridges, appeared a pine, which I immediately
discovered to be the same species as that observed in 1824, on
the Brisbane River. Encamping, I ascended a remarkable
square-topped mount, which formed the western termination of one
of these ridges; and from its summit had a very extensive view of
the country lying between north and south, towards the west. At
N. and N.N.W. we observed a succession of heavily-timbered
ridges, extending laterally from the more elevated chain of
mountains immediately to the east, which evidently forms the main
dividing range in this part of the country; whilst from
north-west to west, and thence to south, within a range of twenty
miles, a most beautifully diversified landscape, made up of hill
and dale, woodland, and plain, appeared before us.</p>
<p>Large patches of land, perfectly clear of trees, lying to the
north of Darling Downs, were named Peel's Plains, whilst others,
bearing to the south and south-east, and which presented an
undulated surface with a few scattered trees, were called after
the late Mr. Canning. Directing our view beyond Peel's Plains to
the north-west, an expanse of flat, wooded country met the eye,
being evidently a continuation of those vast levels, which we had
frequently observed, in the progress of our journey, extending to
the westward of our line of route, and which, it was now
perceived, were continued northerly at least to the parallel of
27°.</p>
<p>In a valley which led to the immediate base of the
mountain-barrier, I fixed my northernmost encampment,
determining, as I had not the means of advancing further in
consequence of the state of my provisions and the low condition
of my horses, to employ a short period in a partial examination
of the principal range, to the western base of which we had
penetrated from the southward, through a considerable portion of
barren interior. In exploring the mountains immediately above our
tents, with a view more especially of ascertaining how far a
passage could be effected over them to the shores of Moreton Bay,
a remarkably excavated part of the main range was discovered,
which appeared likely to prove a very practicable pass through
these mountains from the eastward. Its more particular
examination, however, I left to the period of a visit, by sea, to
Moreton Bay, which I had already contemplated, and which I was
enabled to effect in the course of the succeeding year (1829).
And the brief notice of my having thus, in a most satisfactory
manner, connected my sketch of the Brisbane River country with
this pass, and with the lands to the westward, will be seen in
another part of this paper.</p>
<p>The situation of my tents in the valley was determined to be
as follows. Latitude, by meridional altitudes of the sun being
the mean of five observations, 28° 10' 45" south. Longitude, by
account corrected by bearings taken to fixed points on or near
the coast-line, and compared with the mean results of several
sets of distances of the sun and star antares from the moon, 152°
7' 45" E. The variation of the compass was found by azimuths to
be 8° 18' E. The mean height of the spot above the level of the
sea, by the mercurial column noted morning and evening, was one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven feet; and its distance
from the penal settlement on the Brisbane River, which bore by
compass about north-east from us, was estimated at about
seventy-five statute miles. Circumstances now urged me to
commence my journey homewards, and this I determined to prosecute
with as much despatch as the condition of my horses and the
nature of the country would admit of. I had also resolved to
pursue my course to the southward, under the meridian of our
encampment, as that would lead us through a tract of perfectly
unknown country, lying nearly equidistant between our
outward-bound track and the coast-line.</p>
<p>On the 16th of June, therefore, I again put my people in
motion, and quitting the vale in which we had rested, (and which
I had named after the late Captain Logan, at that period
commandant of Moreton Bay,) I shaped my course to the southward;
and after passing through a fine, open, forest tract, abounding
in excellent pasturage, in nine miles gained the north-eastern
skirts of Canning Downs, of which I had had a view from a station
on the hills which we had left.</p>
<p>At the close of the 18th, after penetrating an uninteresting
forest, chiefly of red gum (<i>Eucalyptus robusta</i>,) we
reached the borders of a broken mountainous country, which
exhibited a geological structure, that had not been previously
met with in any part of our journey. The rock was a very hard
granite, in which the quartz, greatly preponderating, was
unusually large; and at this stage of our homeward-bound journey
our difficulties commenced. During the succeeding week, our daily
journies were attended with great fatigue both to my people and
horses; for being surrounded by high lands, we had no alternative
but to pursue our way southerly, from one rocky range to another
of greater elevation; until at length we found ourselves upon an
open heath, totally devoid of trees, but covered with a low,
scrubby vegetation, and interspersed with small patches of spongy
swamp, in aspect similar to parts of the Blue Mountains to the
westward of Port Jackson. And although the base continued of
granite, and the difference of latitude was nearly 5°, yet the
same species of plants as are to be observed upon those elevated
ranges of the colony were, for the most part, to be found. At
noon of the 25th, our latitude, observed on a very bleak sterile
spot on those mountains, (two thousand nine hundred and
sixty-nine feet above the sea-shore,) was 28° 45' S., and our
longitude reduced from the meridian of our encampment in Logan
Vale, was about 151° 59' E. From that point, notwithstanding our
elevation, our view towards the east was altogether circumscribed
by lofty ranges, whose summits towered far above the height we
had attained. In the course of the succeeding day, the progress
of the expedition to the south was arrested by a most wild and
frightful region, which obliged me at once to seek a more
practicable country, by directing the course of my party to the
westward, in which direction we, with difficulty, gained a lower
level, and thence prosecuted our journey to the south-west, by
such stages as the reduced strength of my horses was able to
accomplish. On passing to the southward of the parallel of 29°,
which we did in longitude 151° 32' E., we again forded Dumaresq's
River about fifty miles nearer its source, or to the eastward of
the point at which we had discovered it on our outward-bound
journey. Here our barometer gave us an elevation of one thousand
and forty feet above the level of the sea, which showed a mean
fall of four feet per mile, between the two fords.</p>
<p>On the 9th of July, after having traversed in a south-western
direction a great diversity of country, in general of broken,
rocky surface, we fell in with our former track, and on the
following day crossed the channel of what I had considered the
Peel, but which I subsequently named the Gwydir, upon finding it
formed by a junction of Mr. Oxley's River with another as large,
to which I gave the title of Horton's River. This latter has a
course parallel to the Peel, through a valley lying to the
westward of it, along which I was again enabled to direct my
party to the south many miles, before a series of elevated forest
ridges, stretching laterally from Hardwicke's range of Mr. Oxley,
once more obliged us to climb the hills. These we ascended from
the head of the vale, by a steep acclivity, and, at an elevation
of one thousand three hundred feet above its level, resumed our
course to the south. Among these hills we again observed granite,
but of a reddish appearance, in consequence of the quantity and
colour of the felspar which might be seen disseminated through
the rock, of which Hardwicke's range is evidently formed; the
elevation, above the level of the sea, of whose curiously formed
cubical and chimney-shaped summits cannot be less than three
thousand five hundred feet. The vegetation of this group of hills
exhibited nothing remarkable; the ridges were generally grassy,
but the <i>gramineæ</i>, as well as the timbers, which were of
<i>Eucalyptus</i>, were of species frequent in the colony. At the
close of our second day's journey, we had traversed these lateral
ranges to their southern side, which overlooked an apparently
level, wooded country, extending to Liverpool Plains, the greater
body of which at length appeared before us to the south-west, at
a distance of forty miles. Repeatedly, in our attempts to descend
to the lower country, were we stopped by rocky ravines several
hundred feet in depth; and it was not without considerable
difficulty and danger to the horses that we gained the levels
beneath us, having actually descended a wooded ridge, from which
there was an abrupt declivity of one thousand five hundred and
forty feet. After a severe march of thirty miles through a barren
forest, for the most part of blighted Iron-bark, furnishing but
little pasturage and still less water, we at length arrived at
Barrow's Valley of Mr. Oxley, which, in seasons of long rains, is
evidently laid under water by the overflow of Field's River,
which, in its course inland, we met meandering north-west,
through the adjacent forest. On the bank of this river, where I
gave my horses a day's rest upon the richest meadow-land we had
seen in the whole tour, it was with pleasure that I hailed the
colonial blue gum (<i>Eucalyptus piperita</i>) of stupendous
size, the alluvial grounds on each bank producing also the
herbage of the flooded flats of the Hawkesbury River in the
colony. On the 20th of July, we resumed our route to the
southward, and after pursuing a steady course for about
twenty-seven miles through a barren, brushy country, not nine
hundred feet above the level of the sea, we passed the northern
margin of Liverpool Plains, throughout which, such had been the
effect of drought, that we crossed their extensive surface almost
to the foot of the dividing range (a space of twenty-five miles)
before we found water for the horses or ourselves. On the 28th my
party repassed the Mountain Range, and after an absence of
thirteen weeks, we returned to the station from which we had
departed, on the Hunter, having, in that period, traversed
upwards of eight hundred miles of every description of
country.</p>
<p>My report to the Colonial Government of this journey&mdash;of
the spacious downs we had discovered in latitude 28°&mdash;and
the considerable tract of very indifferent country, in part
actual desert, that lay between the colony and those extensive
pastoral lands, immediately suggested the importance of examining
the space between those downs and the sea-coast at Moreton Bay;
since, should the Gap, which had been discovered in the main
dividing range in the above parallel, prove, on actual survey, to
admit of a passage through that chain of mountains, the readiest
point of access to the very desirable country on their western
side would be from the shores of Moreton Bay and Brisbane
River,&mdash;on the banks of the latter of which a penal
settlement had already been established for several years. This
inquiry became one of the objects of my voyage from Port Jackson
the following year; and its results proved every way most
satisfactory to the colonial government, and the colonists
generally.</p>
<p>As I propose to make some general remarks elsewhere on the
character of the country around Moreton Bay&mdash;a country alike
interesting to the botanist and geologist&mdash;I will here
simply remark, that in exploring the intermediate tract between
the Brisbane River and the point where my overland journey of the
preceding year had terminated, I ascertained that a line of road
could be easily constructed from the western downs, easterly
through the mountain pass, and thence in a north-eastern
direction to the head of the navigation of a branch of the
Brisbane River, named the Bremer; to which point evidently the
future produce of the interior beyond those mountains will be
conveyed, since from it the means of water-carriage to shipping
in the bay will be found practicable at all seasons of the year,
whatever may be the effect of drought on the land; the tide,
which daily sets into the Brisbane for fifty miles above its
mouth, flowing also up the channel of the Bremer, the depth of
water in which it augments eight or more feet.</p>
<p>I was happy on this occasion of my visit to the Brisbane
River, with in part other objects in view, to be enabled to carry
on my survey from Darling Downs to the very shores of Moreton
Bay; and in effecting it, I derived an additional pleasure, in
closing my sketch of an extent of intricate country,
comprehending from Hunter's River to Brisbane Town, 5° of
latitude, to find but a very small error in my longitude. In the
winter of the following year, (1829,) I again made a voyage to
Moreton Bay, where I was engaged more particularly in botanical
research. From that most interesting occupation, in so novel and
ample a field as the banks of the Brisbane River afforded me, I
found a short period of leisure to devote to geographical
inquiry; and, accordingly, in an excursion to the north-west, I
explored that stream far towards its source, through an irregular
country,* which presented much diversity of surface to interest
the geographer. During that short journey, in which I employed a
small party about six weeks, I traced the principal branch of the
river as far north as latitude 26° 52', until its channel assumed
merely the character of a chain of very shallow stagnant pools.
In this excursion I made such observations as fully established
two facts, viz.&mdash;That the Brisbane River, at one period
supposed to be the outlet of the marshes of the Macquarie,
&amp;c., originates on the eastern side of the dividing range,
its chief sources being in elevated lands, lying almost on the
coast line, between the parallels of 26° and 27°; and that the
main ranges, which separate the coast-waters from those that flow
inland, continue to the north in one unbroken chain as far as the
eye could discern from a commanding station near my most distant
encampment up the river, and present no opening or hollow part in
their elevated ridge, through which to admit of a road being
made, to the interior beyond them. My pass, therefore, through
those lofty mountains (the mean elevation of which above the
shores of Moreton Bay cannot be less than four thousand feet)
seems thus the only opening to the interior country from the
coast between the parallels of 26° and 29° south.</p>
<p class="foot">[* One of the most remarkable points, in that
particular tract of country, is a conical densely-wooded
mountain, to which I gave the name of 'Hay's Peak', in compliment
to R.W. Hay, Esq., the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.
It is situated on the eastern side of the dividing range in lat.
27° 36' S., and long. 152° 8' E.]</p>
<p>Whilst I was engaged at Moreton Bay, the long droughts to
which our distant colony has been repeatedly subjected since its
foundation, and which again visiting that country in 1826, had
continued with most distressing severity for upwards of three
years, led the colonial government to inquire into the state of
the interior, to the westward of the termination of the Macquarie
River, with the view of attempting to make some discoveries in
that quarter. Whilst the drought continued, an expedition was
despatched under the direction of Captain Sturt, an officer of
his Majesty's 39th regiment, to Mount Harris, a detached hill
upon the Macquarie River, where Mr. Oxley had left his boats upon
proceeding easterly towards the coast. Upon reaching that
remarkable eminence, which Captain Sturt and the party forming
his expedition were enabled to do on the 20th of December, he
ascended the summit to survey the country below. But how much had
the evaporation of the sun, which, in its operation, had
continued during a period of three years, changed the face of
those regions! The plains which Mr. Oxley had left entirely under
water in 1818, now presented an expanse of dried up surface,
which to all appearance extended northerly, without the slightest
semblance of rising ground, to a distant 'clear unbroken
horizon'. Encouraged by these appearances, the expedition traced
the Macquarie, through the last stage of its existence, to the
woodlands below Mount Harris, where its channel, becoming broken
and in parts having altogether disappeared on the common level,
ceased 'to exist in any shape as a river'. In exploring the
country beyond this point, the party traversed the bed of that
extensive morass, into which the late surveyor-general had ten
years previously descended in his boat: this they now found 'a
large and blasted plain, on which the sun's rays fell with
intense heat'; the ground itself, parched to an extreme,
exhibiting in many places deep and dangerous clefts, which
clearly demonstrated the long existence of those droughts, to
which every known part of New South Wales was at that period
exposed. On these inhospitable levels, Captain Sturt passed a
week; and in that period he skirted three distinct patches of
marsh, in which were found broken channels of the river, forming
so many stagnant lagoons or canals, surrounded by reeds.</p>
<p>In whatever direction they advanced to satisfy themselves as
to the fate of the Macquarie, whether on the plains or wooded
grounds, reeds of gigantic stature (the clearest indication of
what such a country is in a regularly wet season) encompassed
them, and greatly obstructed their progress. Mr. Hume, whose
enterprising disposition was abundantly manifested in his journey
to the south coast, which has been already noticed in this paper,
was associated with Captain Sturt on this occasion. With such
aid, the latter proposed to divide the party, in order to
undertake at the same time two distinct excursions, to ascertain
more iully the nature and extent of those marshy flats, and set
at rest any doubts which might be entertained as to the mode in
which that river terminated&mdash;that is, of its non-existence
in that low country, after the devastating operation of a drought
of three years. Accordingly, one party, conducted by Mr. Hume,
proceeded in a north-easterly direction, towards the Castlereagh,
whilst Captain Sturt himself pursued a course to the
north-west.</p>
<p>It would indeed have been most interesting, at this stage of
the expedition, had Captain Sturt been provided with good
barometers, to have ascertained the mean height above the level
of the sea, not only of the lowlands over which the party had so
patiently borne the burden and heat of the day, but also of the
country which Captain Sturt traversed in his excursion to the
north-west, and which he found, 'after travelling between twenty
and thirty miles', began to rise; also his level at the end of
his journey, which was extended to an estimated distance of one
hundred miles, where he '<i>made a hill of considerable
elevation</i>', from the summit of which he had '<i>a view of
other high lands</i>'; one in particular to the south-west, which
he describes as '<i>being a very fine mountain</i>'; and which he
afterwards visited and found '<i>of sand-stone formation</i>',
elevated above the '<i>desert waste</i>' on which it stands,
<i>one thousand three hundred feet</i>. Captain Sturt, however,
had no barometer on which he could in the least depend; the
instrument with which he had been provided on his quitting
Sydney, having sustained an injury on the Macquarie, four days
before the expedition reached Mount Harris.</p>
<p>The observations made during these short excursions, satisfied
the party, that the river had no existence in any shape beyond
the 'third marsh' previously explored. Mr. Hume passed from east
to west, along the northern skirts of those extensive reedy
flats, without either meeting with a further trace of a channel
northerly, or finding water enough to supply his daily wants. And
the character and direction of those vast flats, as well as the
points to which the waters discharged upon them by the Macquarie
in seasons of prolonged rains, tend, were now fully
determined.</p>
<p>From the report of Captain Sturt's examination of those
lowlands, then, affected as they were at the time by drought,
these facts may be gathered. At a distance of about twenty-eight
miles below Mount Harris, the flat-lands commence, and there the
Macquarie itself ceases to be a river, having no banks, or
continued channel, by which to prevent the dispersion of its
waters when they rise in rainy seasons. The surface of those
flats, however, has not one continued dip, but presents a
succession of levels and inclinations, with each a detached
lagoon-like channel, hemmed in on all sides by high reeds which
catch the waters as they spread; and it is only when these are
overflowed that the floods spread over the level, 'until', as
Captain Sturt observes, 'a slight declivity giving them fresh
impulse', they arrive at a second channel, and so spread to a
third, until a considerable extent of surrounding country is laid
under water. When such a general inundation takes place, as that
witnessed in 1818, there is a current through the body of these
marshes, setting, agreeably to the configuration of the ground,
(as at length shown to us by Captain Sturt,) to the north and
north-north-east, where, uniting with the waters of Morissett's
ponds, the whole is thrown into the channel of the Castlereagh
River.</p>
<p>To the north-west of those marshy grounds, Captain Sturt
describes the country as rising, and therefore preventing any
flow of the waters of the morass to that point of the compass.
This rise of the surface, which I observe is elsewhere described
as 'a table-land with scarcely water to support its inhabitants',
may be clearly understood as meaning a series of low terraces of
dry forest-land, which present a level tract of ground, or one
but slightly undulated, extending, probably, a considerable
distance, until a second rise of the ground takes place. And the
extreme perpendicular elevation of such a tract above the plane
of the marshes is far too inconsiderable to justify its being
considered a rising hilly country; nor is its actual mean height
above the level of the sea raised in the least, because it has
been ascertained that there are upon its desert-like surface a
few rocky hills, which, standing far detached from each other,
appear, when viewed with the country surrounding the base of
each, like so many islands in the ocean. This view of the face of
the country bounding the marshes of the Macquarie on the
north-west will assuredly be verified, whenever a barometer is
carried to that part of the interior.</p>
<p>Finally, before I quit the subject of those low marshy
grounds, which have excited so much interest and speculation
among geographers since the report of them given by Mr. Oxley, I
would briefly remark, that although a drought of unparalleled
duration had disposed of their waters, so as to enable Captain
Sturt and his party to traverse their bed in a dried up, hardened
state, still, whenever a wet season sets in, and rain falls upon
the mountainous districts of that colony, in the same quantity
that it did in the years 1817 and 1818, it can scarcely be
doubted that a like considerable inundation will again take place
in that part of the interior; and when it is considered (as
Captain Sturt informs us) that a space, twenty miles in breadth,
and more than fifty in length, is subject to be thus deluged, can
it be a subject of surprise that the late indefatigable
surveyor-general, when he descended in his boat to such an
expanse of water, to which he could perceive neither boundary nor
shore, should, with no previous knowledge of such a water, or of
the features of the surrounding country, have conceived himself
in the 'vicinity of an inland sea or lake', of the temporary or
more permanent existence of which he did not, nor could he have
offered an opinion?</p>
<p>Captain Sturt now directed his expedition to the north-west,
with a view to further discoveries, aware as he was, from the
observations he had previously made during his own short
excursion, that a clear open country was before him in that
direction. In their route his party traversed plains 'covered
with a black scrub', yet furnishing in parts some good grass. The
detached hills already spoken of, as relieving the otherwise
monotonous aspect of that part of the interior, and in the
neighbourhood of which Captain Sturt had directed his course, he
describes 'as gentle picturesque elevations, for the most part
covered with verdure'. Of two of these isolated spots, the one
'Oxley's Table Land', the other 'New Year's Range', it appears
our indefatigable officer determined the positions; these were as

<p>In continuing their journey westerly over this level country,
its total want of water, excepting in creeks where the supply was
both bad and uncertain, became a source of considerable annoyance
to the party; who ultimately were obliged to follow one of the
water-courses, which, when tracing it to the north-west, brought
them (on the 2d of February) to the left bank of a large river,
the appearance of which 'raised their most sanguine
expectations'. To the utter disappointment of the travellers,
however, its waters were found perfectly salt; and this
circumstance was the more severely felt, as the horses of the
expedition had travelled long in an excessively heated
atmosphere, and had been without water a considerable time. After
making some arrangement in favour of his exhausted animals,
Captain Sturt, accompanied by Mr. Hume, proceeded to explore this
river, to which he gave the name of Darling. They followed it in
the direction of its course (south-westerly), about forty miles,
and throughout found its waters not only not drinkable, but
rather becoming, as they advanced more considerably impregnated
with salt. In one part they observed 'brine-springs', and the
banks throughout were encrusted with 'salt', or, probably, with
aluminous particles. The breadth of the river, at the point they
first made it, was estimated at sixty yards, and its boundary
banks were from thirty to forty feet in height&mdash;dimensions
which they maintained as far as it was possible to explore the
river.</p>
<p>At length the want of 'drinkable water' along its bank, and
the appearance of a loose red sandy soil, at the point to which
the patience and perseverance of the travellers had induced them
to trace the river, at once destroying all hope of meeting with
the most scanty supply in the back country, obliged them to give
up its further examination. The extreme point to which the
Darling was traced, and from which it continued its course
through a level country to the south-west, Captain Sturt marks on
his map, in latitude 30° 16' south, and longitude 144° 50'
east.</p>
<p>Thus was a portion of the interior of New South Wales,
comprehending two degrees of longitude to the westward of the
part to which Mr. Oxley had penetrated in the marshes, explored;
and although the country is little better than a desert waste,
and, therefore, can hold out no prospect of an advantageous
'extension of the colony in that direction', its character,
nevertheless, was ascertained, and so much of the map of the
country, previously a blank, was at length filled up.</p>
<p>The expedition had daily intercourse with the natives who
inhabit the river and adjacent country, which it would seem is,
comparatively speaking, well peopled; for Captain Sturt estimates
that he could not have seen fewer than two hundred and fifty of
these Indians, among whom his party passed on the most friendly
terms, and, indeed, were frequently indebted to them for kindly
acts.</p>
<p>Captain Sturt, however, draws a most melancholy picture of
these distant regions, which, notwithstanding the population
found on their surface, were rendered, by the distress of the
season, scarcely habitable. 'The natives', he observed, 'were
remarked wandering in the desert, and from the badness of the
water which they were obliged to drink, had contracted a
cutaneous disease, which was fast carrying them off. Birds, which
were noticed sitting on the trees, appeared to be gasping for
existence, amidst the glare of torrid heat. The wild dog, or
dingo, was seen prowling about in the day-time, being unable from
debility to avoid the party; and whilst minor vegetation was
altogether burnt up, the very trees were absolutely drooping from
the depth to which the drought had penetrated the soil. Several
of the party were affected by ophthalmia, produced by the
reverberated heat from the plains which they had traversed, where
the thermometer stood in the shade at three p.m. at 122°, or from
98° to 102° Fahrenheit, at sunset.'</p>
<p>The Darling may be justly considered the largest river which
has been discovered in New South Wales, since it is formed by a
junction of all the streams which were discovered by Mr. Oxley in
1818 (and these were five in number, each of considerable
magnitude), as well as of those I met with in my journey of 1827;
and thus it constitutes the great drain of a tract of mountainous
country lying between the parallels of 27° and 33½°. But what
ultimately becomes of this river so sustained, to what other
channels it becomes united, what course it eventually pursues,
beyond the spot where Captain Sturt and his comrade left it
flowing through a desert country to the south-west, or on what
coast it is discharged, if it really does make the sea at any
point, remains wholly unknown, and is therefore still to be
discovered.</p>
<p>The party were now glad to direct their steps towards
Bathurst; but before they finally quitted these parched levels,
they shaped a course to the eastward, with the view of meeting
with the Castlereagh, the channel of which (one hundred and
eighty yards in width) Mr. Oxley experienced no small difficulty
in crossing, as the rains which had fallen on the mountains to
the south-east, whence it derives its principal sources, had
swollen its waters to the level of its upper banks. On making
this river they traced it down full one hundred miles to its
junction with another part of the Darling, the water of which
they found even Salter than it was at the point at which the
expedition had originally fallen in with it; nor did they find a
sufficiency in the Castlereagh to meet their daily demands, for
its bed was laid bare 'for a distance of thirty miles at a
stretch', which obliged our travellers to 'search the country
round' for the little water which it had to yield them.</p>
<p>Surrounded as the party were by difficulties in a region
'deserted by the native tribes', scarcely capable of sustaining
animal life, and in which all the dogs of the expedition fell a
sacrifice, still Captain Sturt appears to have been unwilling to
quit his ground; for although the briny waters of the Darling
were in themselves quite enough to have induced him to have made
a hasty retreat southerly, to higher grounds and a better
country, we, nevertheless, find him crossing the Salt River, to
see what the country was in a north-westerly direction; nor does
it appear that the curiosity of our travellers was at all
satisfied, until they had penetrated a considerable distance on
that course, where they found the ground uniformly level, and the
surface in no part broken by either creek or minor water-course,
the entire country around being, as far as could be seen from the
highest tree, 'a boundless flat', the elevation of which above
the level of the sea was, probably, not more than five hundred
feet. Captain Sturt had at length done his utmost; he, therefore,
very wisely directed his party to the southward, and soon reached
Bathurst.</p>
<p>Thus, much of our knowledge of the internal parts of New South
Wales in the parallel of 30°, was derived from the labours of
this indefatigable officer; to whom was entrusted, at the close
of 1829, the direction of a second expedition, destined to trace
the course of the Morrumbidgee, another western stream, rising in
a range of mountains situated to the southward of the parallel of
35°, and under the meridian of 149°, at a distance of about
eighty miles inland from the eastern coast line, and within what
is now denominated the county of Murray. Of the character of this
river it may be here briefly remarked, that its bed forms a
succession of planes, of which some are of great inclination;
along these its waters flow with considerable velocity in nearly
a west direction.</p>
<p>After receiving the Yass River and some other minor streams,
all which fall into it at an early stage of its progress, namely,
in longitude 148½°, the Morrumbidgee pursues a long and tortuous
course for upwards of three hundred statute miles, without
deriving the slightest increase from the country it waters; and
thus in this respect it resembles the Lachlan, which maintains a
parallel course through the low interior to the northward. From
this fact may be inferred the generally steril character of a
considerable portion of the country lying between the channels of
these two rivers, and which was in part ascertained by Mr. Oxley
in 1817. As its course extends to the westward of the meridian
147°, the Morrumbidgee falls on a low level; the hills of
sandstone rock, which give a picturesque appearance to the lands
on its banks, higher up the stream, disappear; and flats of
alluvial deposit occupy their place.</p>
<p>Thus far the river had been followed down some years ago, by
stock-keepers in pursuit of strayed cattle, who also ascertained
in their long rides along its banks, the extent to which the
country westerly, from its elevation above inundation, might be
safely occupied as grazing stations. The direction, which this
river was also at that period known to take towards the marshes
of the Lachlan, led to the conclusion, that both streams were
united in those morasses; and on so low a level, (as was
ascertained by Mr. Oxley in 1817,) as to favour the opinion that
their confluent waters were rather dissipated over an extensively
flat surface, than carried on in one body to the ocean, distant
at least three hundred miles. And this opinion, gratuitous as it
was, would nevertheless have proved to have been correct, had the
Morrumbidgee not pursued its course so far to the westward as to
reach the channel of a much larger river; since, as will
presently be seen, it has neither magnitude nor velocity
sufficient to force its way two hundred and sixty miles to the
sea-coast; but which the principal stream, by its volume and
strength, has the power to effect.</p>
<p>The second expedition conducted by Captain Sturt proceeded
from Sydney to explore the Morrumbidgee, in December, 1829.
Tracing it down on its right bank, until he had passed every
rapid or fall that might impede its navigation, he established a
depôt&mdash;launched a boat, which he had conveyed overland from
Sydney, and having, by dint of great exertion, built another on
the spot, he lost no time in commencing his examination of the
river to the westward. Before we follow the enterprising party on
their voyage, it may be interesting to give the height of the
river at the depôt, above the sea-coast, as derived from the
observations of the late surveyor-general many years ago, on the
adjacent country, which results it would have been very
satisfactory had Captain Sturt been possessed of the means of
verifying. This will show not only how slight is the inclination
of its bed to give an impetus to its stream westerly towards the
ocean, but also how perfectly unavailable to the colony are those
vast flats of low country, which were observed to extend along
its banks. The situation of his depôt Captain Sturt found to be
in latitude 34¼° south, and longitude 143° 57' east, or about
twenty-seven geographic miles south-west from Mr. Oxley's extreme
point of penetration on die steppes of the Lachlan, in July 1817,
the mean elevation of which above the level of the sea, that
accurate traveller had determined, by barometrical admeasurement,
to be not more than two hundred and fifty feet. Now, as Captain
Sturt informs us that the dispersed waters of those morasses
again unite, and drain into the Morrumbidgee by a 'large creek',
which he passed about twelve miles west from his depôt, it is
very evident that the bed of this latter river, and the country
immediately adjacent, are at a somewhat lower level than Mr.
Oxley's last or westernmost encampment.</p>
<p>On the 7th January, the expedition moved forward down the
river, and on the fourth day, having passed extensive alluvial
flats, on which were patches of reeds, the navigation became much
interrupted by 'fallen timber', and as the current was frequently
very rapid, particularly in those parts of the river where its
channel had become contracted, the boats were oftentimes in great
danger from sunken logs. After advancing on their voyage about
ninety miles to the westward, through a country of level,
monotonous aspect, the party were relieved from the state of
anxiety which a week's most difficult and dangerous navigation
had caused, by their arrival at (to use Captain Stint's words)
'the termination of the Morrumbidgee', for its channel, much
narrowed and partially choked by driftwood, delivered its waters
'into a broad and noble river', the current of which was setting
to the westward at the rate of two miles and a half per hour,
with a medium width from bank to bank of from three to four
hundred feet. This 'new river', which was called the Murray, and
into which the diminished waters of the Morrumbidgee fall, is
evidently formed by a junction of the 'Hume' and
'Ovens',&mdash;which streams, taking their rise in the great
Wanagong Chain, were first made known to us by the travellers
Messrs. Hovell and Hume, who crossed them, two hundred and fifty
statute miles nearer their sources, in their excursion to Port
Philip in 1824. Pursuing the course of the Murray, on the 14th
January, the voyagers made 'rapid progress to the W.N.W.',
noticing, as they passed on, a low 'unbroken and uninteresting
country of equal sameness of features and vegetation', to that
observed whilst descending the intricate Morrumbidgee on quitting
their depôt.</p>
<p>After nine days voyage down the Murray, in which period they
made about one hundred miles of westing, without observing the
slightest change of country for the better, or the least rise in
its surface, the expedition passed the mouth of a stream flowing
from the north by east, with a strong current, and in point of
magnitude but 'little inferior' to the Murray itself. Ascending
it, Captain Sturt found it preserved a breadth of one hundred
yards, and its banks, on which were many natives, 'were overhung
with trees of finer and larger growth' than those of the Murray.
Its waters were, moreover, ascertained to be two fathoms in
depth; of turbid appearance, but 'perfectly sweet to the taste'.
The confluence of these two rivers takes place, it appears, (by
Captain Sturt's reckoning,) in exactly longitude 141° east, and
immediately to the south of the parallel of 34°. It was at this
stage of the expedition that the face of the country began to
assume (comparatively speaking) an interesting appearance; and
the first rise of ground which had been seen in the advance of
the party to the westward in a direct line of more than two
hundred miles, was observed at a moderate distance from the river
to the north-west. Previous to his reaching the point of
confluence of the two rivers, Captain Sturt, it would appear, had
entertained a doubt as to the 'decline of the vast plain through
which the Murray flows', as well as of 'the probable fall of the
waters of the interior' to the north of it; but on observing a
new stream flowing into the Murray, the circumstance of the
'parallel' (meridian doubtless) in which he had struck it, 'and
the direction from which it came', combined to satisfy him, 'that
it could be no other than the Darling'. It was therefore
concluded that the whole of the internally formed streams, at
present known in that country, from my Dumaresq's River,
(discovered in 1827 in lat. 29°,) to the Murray in 34°, are
discharged into the ocean on the south-coast&mdash;the dip of the
continent within the parallels of 28° and 35½°, being of course
to that point. However, the identity of this tributary to the
Murray with the Darling, remains still to be ascertained,* before
the declension of so considerable a portion of the interior can
be said to be southerly, and before one can positively assert,
with the president of a society in New South Wales, either that
an interesting fact has been established&mdash;viz. 'that all the
waters from the Bathurst country, owing to the dip of the earth,
run to the south-west extremities of eastern Australia',&mdash;or
that these discoveries have opened a water communication from the
south coast, 'one thousand miles through a variety of
agricultural and pastoral country, in one of the finest climates
which the world can boast of', and capable of sustaining
'millions of emigrants'.</p>
<p class="foot">[* There is an intermediate tract of unknown
country, exceeding in extent four hundred miles, between the
southernmost point of Captain Sturt's examination of the Darling
River, and the junction of the stream, discovered in the progress
of this second expedition, flowing from the northward into the
<i>Murray</i>; and as these exhibit no one character common to
both, we cannot, in the present state of our information, arrive
at a satisfactory conclusion, that the tributary to the
<i>last-mentioned</i> river, and that great drain of the country
to the north of the parallel of 34°, the Darling, are one and the
same stream. The river flowing into the Murray is said to be
sweet to the taste; the Darling, on the other hand, is described
as strongly impregnated with salt.]</p>
<p>The character of the Darling, as also the general direction of
its course, beyond the point to which it has been traced, we have
yet to ascertain. Since, however, it is by far the most
considerable inland stream at present known in that country, it
is to be hoped, that its further examination, which may furnish
much interesting information respecting the actual features of
the more remote regions of the interior to the north-west, will
ere long be prosecuted. But to follow the expedition down the
Murray.</p>
<p>That river, after it receives the supposed Darling, continues
its course upwards of a degree farther to the westward, and in
that space receives a second stream, which falls in on its left
bank from the south-east. This tributary stream, which is
described as a river of 'considerable importance', and was named
the 'Lindesay', is most probably the 'Goulburn' of the same
indefatigable explorers, whose journey overland to the south
coast in 1824, I have already adverted to, and who, in fording
their river at a part where its channel presented a breadth of
eighty yards, left it winding its course to the north-west. From
this point, the Murray assumed a new feature, and along its
northern bank extended a range of cliffs, which appeared to the
party, as they passed beneath them, to be of 'partial volcanic
origin'. The navigation at length became rather intricate, for
those cliffs being immediately succeeded by others on each bank,
of limestone, the river was found to force its way through a glen
of that rock, in its passage frequently striking bases of
precipices of the same formation, which rose to a perpendicular
elevation of two hundred feet, and in which 'coral and fossil
remains' were remarked to be plentifully imbedded. At this stage
of their passage, those long ranges of forest hills, which extend
along the eastern shore of the Gulf of St. Vincent became
discernible, indicating to the exploring party their approach to
the coast. On the 3d February, the river having reached the
meridian of 139¾°, the disposition of the bounding cliff's gave
its course a decided bend to the southward, through a
continuation of the glen, which at length opened into a
valley.</p>
<p>Here the river was observed to have lost the sandy bottom
which it had exhibited throughout its long course from the
eastward, for its bed having now dipped to almost the level of
the sea, its waters had become 'deep, still, and turbid'. Its
course to the south was followed by the voyagers along reaches of
from two to four miles in length; and upon their passing the
parallel of 35°, a more open country appeared before them, for
the cliff's having partially ceased, had given place to
picturesque hills and lower undulations, beneath which extended
'thousands of acres of the richest flats'; but, as Captain Sturt
adds that these were covered with reeds, and were evidently
liable to inundation from the river, the value to the
agriculturist of such marshy grounds, scarcely at all elevated
above the sea-shore, may be easily estimated.</p>
<p>On the 8th of February (the thirty-second day of the voyage
from the depôt) the hills 'wore a bleak appearance', and the few
trees, which had at one period fringed their ridges, were for the
most part broken off, 'as if by the prevalent winds'. At noon,
upon entering the river's last reach, no land could be discerned
at its extremity; some low hills continued, however, along its
left bank, whilst its right was hid by high reeds. Immediately
afterwards, these enterprising voyagers entered an extensive
lake, the body of which stretched away far to the south-west, in
which direction 'the line of water met the horizon'. This lake,
which received the name of 'Alexandrina', was estimated at from
fifty to sixty miles in length, and from thirty to forty in
breadth. A large bight was observed in it to the south-east, and
an extensive bay at the opposite point; still, notwithstanding
these dimensions, this very considerable sheet of water appears
to be but a mere shoal throughout, since Captain Sturt states
'its medium depth' is but 'four feet'!</p>
<p>Upon this vast but shallow lake, he pursued his voyage to the
southward, remarking that its waters, which at seven miles from
the point of discharge of the Murray into it were brackish, were
at twenty-one miles across perfectly salt, and there the force of
the tide was perceived. As the party approached the southern
shore, the navigation of the boats was interrupted by mud flats,
and soon their farther progress was effectually stopped by banks
of sand. Captain Sturt therefore landed, and walking over some
sandy hummocks, beyond which he had, from his morning's position,
seen the sea, almost immediately came out upon the coast at
Encounter Bay of the charts, whence he took bearings to Cape
'Jarvoise', (rather Jervis of Captain Flinders,) and the
south-east point of Kangaroo Island. At the lower part of the
lake seals were observed, and near the spot on the southern
shore, where the party had effected a landing, some natives were
seen grouped together, but as they bore arms and had their bodies
painted, it was obvious that their intentions were far from being
friendly; nor did they, although they saw the party were
peaceably disposed, attempt to visit the encampment of the
travellers during their stay on the margin of the lake.</p>
<p>Having thus seen the termination of the Murray and the outlet
of the lake into which it falls upon the south coast, Captain
Sturt lost as little time as possible in conducting his party
back by water to his depôt&mdash;circumstances not permitting of
a more perfect examination of that extensive piece of water, from
the north-western extremity of which, some hopes had been
entertained of there being a clear and open communication with
the Gulf of St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Now we gather from the results of this second tour of
discovery of Captain Sturt, simply this, and no more,
viz.&mdash;in what way the Morrumbidgee, as well as the several
streams which were crossed by Messrs. Hovell and Hume in 1824,
and the waters of the Lachlan of Oxley in 1817, (all which
unite,) are disposed of; as also the nature of the 'unbroken,
uninteresting country', lying to the westward of the marshes of
the latter. It must, however, be acknowledged that, in effecting
this service, Captain Sturt has added largely to the geographical
knowledge which we previously possessed, since the facts
ascertained by him during the progress of his expedition have
enabled him to fill up no inconsiderable blank on the map of that
part of New South Wales, lying to the west and south-west of Port
Jackson. That the expedition of this enterprising officer has
opened to the settler 'unmeasurable tracts of well-watered'
country previously unknown, as stated in the report of a society
in the colony already referred to, his despatch to the local
government does not in the slightest degree support; nor does it
contain the announcement to the colonists, that a river,
navigable for commercial purposes, has been discovered in that
country, which can be available at some future day 'to convey to
the coast the wools and other exportable produce' of the
settlers, who may hereafter be established in those parts of the
interior which lie in the neighbourhood of its banks. The reverse
is the fact. The Murray, when flooded from the eastward, will
doubtless carry a boat safely down its channel, but as a
navigable river at all seasons, it is, like the Macquarie, and
indeed every other western stream, useless to the colonists. Even
if the Murray were throughout the year, and during the driest
seasons, a deep navigable river, its waters could not be rendered
of use for the purposes of commerce, since it discharges itself
into a shoal lake, and that again into the sea at Encounter Bay,
where, although the passage is, as Captain Sturt states, 'at all
periods of the tide, rather more than a quarter of a mile in
width, and of sufficient depth for a boat to enter', still, as he
also observes, and the master of every coaster well knows, '<i>a
line of dangerous breakers</i>', which are constantly rolling
against the sand-bars thrown up by the prevalent winds, '<i>will
always prevent an approach to the lake from the sea, excepting in
the calmest weather; whilst the bay itself will at all times be a
hazardous place for any vessel to enter under any
circumstance</i>.' The opinion also, which has been entertained,
that a more practicable communication with the lake might be
found from the Gulf of Saint Vincent is wholly gratuitous, for a
reference to the voyage of Captain Flinders, who closely examined
the shores of that deep bight, and an inspection of the chart of
that able navigator, (the accuracy of which, generally, no seaman
ever doubted who had sailed by it,) on which is laid down a range
of wooded hills, extending from the promontory of Cape Jervis
northerly, along the whole of the eastern shore of the gulf, are
sufficient for us rather to entertain every doubt of the
existence of such a channel of communication with the
north-western bay of the lake, which is <i>itself</i>, in all
probability, nothing else than an extensive mud-shoal *.</p>
<p class="foot">* [Since Mr. Cunningham's observations on this
subject were written, the Colonial Office has received accounts
from New South Wales, which show that the expectations which were
entertained by Captain Sturt of the existence of a communication
between the Gulf of St. Vincent and the Lake Alexandrina were
destitute of foundation. With the view of setting this question
at rest, an accurate survey of the Lake was recently made by
Captain Barker, an officer of the 39th regiment, on his return
from King George's Sound, where he had been employed on detached
duty; and it is a matter of sincere regret, that from an excess
of zeal in geographical science, this enterprising officer should
have lost his life, in the prosecution of this object.]</p>
<p>I have now given the sum of our geographical knowledge of New
South Wales up to the present period; and dividing the map of
that vast country into seven equal parts, one division will fully
include the tracks of all the journeys which have been undertaken
since 1817, with a view to discovery, by Oxley, Sturt, Hovell and
Hume, myself, and others; whilst the remaining six portions,
which comprehend a great expanse of interior beyond the tropic,
and the whole of the equinoctial part of the continent, continue,
at this day, a vast region, entirely unknown. The want of
navigable rivers in that 'Great South Land', must necessarily
impede the progress of discovery in the interior of the
country.</p>
<p>In closing these geographical remarks on New South Wales, I
trust I may be permitted to point out the directions in which
more extended expeditions of discovery might be employed in that
country, and which, if conducted by individuals every way
competent to such service, would assuredly put us in possession
of such information, as would go far towards showing us the real
features and character of central Australia,&mdash;its animal and
vegetable productions,&mdash;the extent to which a region so
remote from the coasts is peopled, and that which would not be
the least interesting in the inquiries of such exploring
parties&mdash;its system of rivers.</p>
<p>One expedition might be despatched to follow the course of the
Darling, from the point Captain Sturt quitted it in January,
1829; or the party might be directed to trace up, in a northerly
direction, the auxiliary stream that falls into the Murray, which
was supposed to be the Darling; either would set at rest all
doubts respecting the identity of these waters, or furnish clear
proof of their being distinct rivers.</p>
<p>A second long and interesting journey might be undertaken,
from any one of my points in the Moreton Bay-country, on the
western side of the dividing range, to penetrate to the tropic,
by pursuing a course as much to the westward of north-west, as
the internal country, by furnishing the requisites, grass and
water for the animals employed, would permit. An expedition well
appointed, and furnished with six months' provisions, and
moreover favoured by the country affording wherewithal to sustain
animal life, might cross the tropical circle in longitude 140°:
upon gaining which, the party might be directed to descend
southerly under that meridian to the latitude of Moreton Bay;
and, reaching that parallel, to shape a course to the eastward,
in order to make the point on the coast-line, from which the
expedition had originally taken its departure. In the
considerable triangle which such a route would describe, the
character of a large tract of internal country would be fully
ascertained; and if there are any high lands to the westward of
the above-mentioned meridian, which is perhaps very doubtful,
these would be seen, and even visited, if not too far remote, and
the several rivers, of which there are doubtless many, in four
and a half degrees of latitude, flowing inland from the dividing
range to the eastward, would, in the progress of such a journey,
be repeatedly crossed and their tendency ascertained.</p>
<p>Again; of all the coasts of the continent of Australia, the
north-western, as affording encouragement to hope that outlets of
internally collected waters might be there discovered, calls for
peculiarly minute and patient examination. Upwards of one hundred
and thirty years ago, that celebrated navigator, Dampier, whilst
on that coast, found the southern parts of De Witt's Land to
consist of a range of islands (now bearing his name), among which
he remarked such an extraordinary rise and fall of the tides, as
induced him to give it as his opinion that the northern part of
New Holland was separated from the lands to the southward by a
strait; unless, says he, 'the high tides and indraughts
thereabouts should be occasioned by the mouth of some large
river, which hath often low lands on either side of the outlet,
and many islands and shoals lying at its entrance.' This opinion,
says Captain Flinders, he supports by a fair induction of facts,
and the opening of twelve miles wide, seen near that part of the
coast by Vlaming's two vessels, and in which they could find no
anchorage, strongly corroborates Dampier's supposition.</p>
<p>What those early navigators remarked, has been more than
abundantly confirmed, lately, by Captain King, whose more
extended observations upon the character of the tides, the
rushing force of the currents, and other phenomena on those
inter-tropical shores, all lead to the conclusion, that if that
peculiarly constituted country furnishes any streams of magnitude
worthy to be compared with those of other continents, the
estuaries of such will most assuredly be found on that extensive
line of coast.</p>
<p>At the close of the surveys of this latter very able navigator
in 1822, there remained between Dampier's Archipelago, in
latitude 22°, and Cape Hay in 14°, about five hundred miles of
coast, wholly unsurveyed and unseen. Moreover, there is reason to
believe, that even of those portions of that coast which were
examined during those voyages, which employed between four and
five years, some parts will be found to be rather large groups of
islands,&mdash;the main shore itself, being probably, far distant
to the eastward.</p>
<p>To complete the survey of that considerable range of coast,
the employment of a vessel, thoroughly equipped for so intricate,
dangerous, but, at the same time, most interesting service, would
at once settle the great geographical question, viz. whether or
not Australia, with a surface equal nearly to that of Europe,
discharges on its coast, a river of sufficient magnitude to lead,
by a long, uninterrupted course of navigation to its central
regions; by which alone a knowledge of the capabilities of such
distant parts of the interior may be acquired, and the produce of
the soil be one day conveyed to its coast.</p>
