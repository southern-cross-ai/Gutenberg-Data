<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>First Walk</h2>

<p>BEHOLD me, then, as if alone upon the earth, having neither
brother, relative, friend, or society, but my own thoughts; the
most social and affectionate of men, proscribed, as it were, by
unanimous consent. They have sought in the refinement of their
hatred, what would be the most cruel torment to my susceptible
soul, and have rent asunder every bond which attached me to them. I
should have loved mankind in spite of themselves, and it was only
by throwing off humanity that they could avoid my affection. At
length, then, behold them strangers, unknown, as indifferent to me
as they desired to be; but thus detached from mankind, and
everything that relates to them, what am I? This remains to be
sought. Unhappily, the search must be preceded by casting a glance
on my own situation, since I must necessarily pass through this
examination, in order to judge between them and myself.</p>

<p>It is now above fifteen years since I have been in this strange
situation, which yet appears to me like a dream; ever imagining,
that disturbed by indigestion, I sleep uneasily, but shall soon
awake, freed from my troubles, and surrounded by my friends. Yes,
surely, I have glided unconsciously from nightly watchings into
profound sleep, or rather from life to death; dragged, I know not
how, from the natural order of things, I find myself precipitated
into an incomprehensible chaos, where I can distinguish nothing,
and the more I consider my present situation, the less I seem to
comprehend it.</p>

<p>How could I possibly foresee the destiny that awaited me? Or,
how can I even now, though betrayed into this state, form any
adequate idea of it? Could I, if in my right senses, suppose that
one day, the man I was, and yet remain, should be taken, without
any kind of doubt, for a monster, a poisoner, an assassin, the
horror of the human race, the sport of the rabble, my only
salutation to be spit upon, and that a whole generation would
unanimously amuse themselves in burying me alive? When this strange
revolution first happened, taken by unawares, I was overwhelmed
with astonishment; my agitation, my indignation, plunged me into a
delirium, which ten years have scarcely been able to calm: during
this interval, falling from error to error, from fault to fault,
and folly to folly, I have, by my imprudence, furnished the
contrivers of my fate with instruments, which they have artfully
employed to fix it without resource.</p>

<p>For a long time, my struggles were as violent as unavailing,
employed without art, dissimulation, or prudence: warm, open,
impatient, and frank in my disposition, every endeavour to
disengage myself did but entangle me the more, and give my enemies
incessant advantages, which they took care to improve: at length,
finding all my efforts useless, all my uneasiness vain, I adopted
the only means that remained; which was, to submit without
murmuring to my fate; and found an indemnification for my
misfortunes, by the tranquillity, which this resignation procured
me, and which could not be allied with the continual struggle of a
painful and ineffectual resistance.</p>

<p>Another circumstance has contributed to this tranquillity: in
the eagerness of their malice, my persecutors had omitted one thing
highly necessary to the accomplishment of their designs, this was,
to portion out the effects of their malice in such a manner that
they might maintain and renew my sorrows by successive oppressions.
Had they possessed the skill to have left me some beam of hope,
they might have held me by that, and continued me their play-thing
by false lures, till at length they had totally overwhelmed me by
successive torments, arising from deceived expectation; but they
exhausted all their inventions at once, and in stripping me of
every hope, deprived themselves of every resource. The defamation,
oppression, scandal, and derision with which they have loaded me,
are no more capable of augmentation than they are of being
palliated, and can no more increase my misfortunes, than I can
remove them; they have been so precipitate in bringing my misery to
the utmost pitch, that all the powers on earth, aided by all the
machinations of hell, can add nothing to it; even bodily pains,
instead of augmenting my calamities, serve only to divert them, and
while they extort groans, prevent shudderings; the pangs of my body
making me less sensible to those of my soul.</p>

<p>What then have I to fear from mankind, since my situation cannot
be rendered worse? No more can they alarm me; inquietude and fear
are evils from which they have delivered me forever; which is no
insignificant consolation. Present evils make little impression on
me; when I encounter them, I readily take my measures; but it is
different with those that keep me in doubt; alarmed imagination
combines, turns, extends, and augments the idea of them, tormenting
me an hundred times more than their reality can do, the threat
being ever more terrible than the stroke. When misfortunes actually
arrive, being stripped of every imaginary horror, and reduced to
their real weight, I always think them much less than I had feared,
and find relief even in the midst of my sufferings. In this state,
freed from fear, and delivered from suspense and hope, even custom
alone will suffice to render that situation daily more supportable,
which no calamities can render worse. By degrees, the sensation of
unhappiness becomes less acute, when there remains no possibility
of giving it re-animation; and this service I have received from my
persecutors, for by showering down at once the whole violence of
their animosity, they have lost all authority over me, and
hereafter I can securely laugh at their malice.</p>

<p>For about two months since, a complete calm has been
re-established in my heart. I had long been a stranger to fear; but
I continued to encourage hope; this sentiment sometimes flattered,
sometimes frustrated, was a medium, through which a thousand
different passions found means to agitate me: an event, as
melancholy as it was unforeseen, has at length banished from my
heart every beam of hope, and made me consider my worldly destiny
as irrevocably fixed; since then, I have resigned myself without
reserve, and have regained my tranquillity. When I became
acquainted with the extent of the plot formed against me, I totally
gave tip the idea of regaining, during life, the good opinion of
the public; and even was this acquisition possible, the confidence
could not be reciprocal, and consequently must be useless. Should
mankind return to me it would be vain, I am no longer to be found;
they have inspired me with such disgust, that their commerce would
not only be insipid, but painful; and I am an hundred times happier
in my solitude, than I could possibly be in their company. They
have torn from my heart all the sweets of society, which at my age
can never spring up again; 'tis too late!&mdash;henceforward let
them do me good or harm it is perfectly indifferent, my
contemporaries can never give me a moment of concern.</p>

<p>I once looked forward to the future, and hoped for a better
generation, who, examining with care and impartiality the opinion
formed by the present, and thence forming a judgment between us,
would easily unravel the artifice of those who gave rise to it, and
view me as I really am. This hope suggested the idea of writing my
Dialogues, with a thousand useless expedients to make them reach
posterity, and though distant, kept my mind in the same agitation
as when I endeavoured to find a mind actuated by principles of
justice in the present age, still rendering me the sport of my
contemporaries. I have mentioned in my Dialogues, on what this
expectation was founded; it was a mistake, and I have happily
discovered my error time enough to enjoy before my last hour an
interval of perfect tranquillity. This interval began from the time
I have already mentioned, and I have reason to believe will never
more be interrupted.</p>

<p>Few days pass, without my being confirmed by new reflections,
how much I erred in flattering myself that I should ever recover
the good opinion of the public, even in a future age; considering
it is conducted by guides who are perpetually renewed in those very
societies that hold me in such implacable aversion. Particulars
die, but collective bodies never can; the same passions are
perpetuated, and their ardent hatred, immortal as the demon that
inspires it, has ever the same activity. Though all my particular
enemies should be no more, Physicians and Oratorians will still
exist, and should I have no other persecutors, those two
description of people, I may be assured, will show no more savour
to my memory, than they have done to my person. Perhaps in the
course of time, the Physicians whom I have really offended, might
be appeased; but the Oratorians, whom I loved, esteemed, in whom I
placed the utmost confidence, and whom I never offended, the
Oratorians,* church-men, and half-monks, will be forever
implacable, their own iniquity being my crime, which self-love can
never par on; and the public, whose animosity they will continually
increase and re-animate, will no more be appeased than
themselves.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* An order of priests, who take their name
from the orator of St. Jerome, at Rome.]</p>

<p>My fate, therefore, is absolutely fixed; no circumstance can
bring me either good or evil; nothing remains for me either to hope
or fear in this world; yet, though plunged into this fearful abyss,
behold me tranquil!&mdash;poor, unfortunate, and infirm; but
completely beyond the reach of suffering.</p>

<p>Every future occurrence will be immaterial to me; I have in the
world neither relative, friend, or brother; I am on the earth, as
if I had fallen into some unknown planet; if I contemplate anything
around me, it is only distressing, heart rending objects;
everything I cast my eyes on, conveys some new subject either of
indignation or affliction; I will endeavour, henceforward, to
banish from my mind all painful ideas, which unavailingly distress
me. Alone for the rest of my life, I must only look for
consolation, hope, or peace, in my own breast; and neither ought,
or will, henceforward, think of anything but myself. It is in this
state, that I return to the continuation of that severe and just
examination which I formerly called my Confessions; I consecrate my
latter days to the study of myself; and to the preparation of that
account, which I must shortly render up of my actions. I resign my
thoughts entirely to the pleasure of conversing with my own soul;
that being the only consolation that man cannot deprive me of. If
by dint of reflection on my internal propensities, I can, attain to
putting them in better order, and correcting the evil that remains
in me, their meditations will not be utterly useless; and though I
am accounted worthless on earth, shall not cast away my latter
days. The leisure of my daily walks has frequently been filled with
charming contemplations, which I regret having forgot; but will
write down those that occur in future; then, every time I read them
over, I shall forget my misfortunes, disgraces, and persecutors, on
recollecting, and contemplating, the integrity of my own heart.</p>

<p>These sheets will only contain a concise journals of my
reveries, treating principally of myself, because a solitary must
be very much employed with his own person, but if during my walk
other ideas pass through my mind, they shall equally find place. I
will relate my thoughts, precisely as they strike me, and with as
little connection as the ideas of yesterday have with those of
today, since from these will result a clearer knowledge of my
temper, with the complexion and tendency of those thoughts and
sentiments which are my daily food, in the singular situation I am
thrown into, than could otherwise be obtained. These sheets,
should, therefore be looked on as an appendix to my Confessions;
but I no longer give them that name, since I have more anything to
say that suits the appellation my heart is purified by repeated
strokes of adversity and I can hardly find, though I search with
the utmost care, any remains of reprehensible inclinations. What
should I confess then, when all terrestrial affections are erased?
I have as little to praise as blame, for henceforward I am nothing
among mankind; nor can I ever be otherwise, possessing no actual
relation or real society'; no longer having it in my power to
attempt any good, which would not turn to evil, nor to act without
injuring either others or myself, thus obstinacy has become my
greatest duty, and I maintain it to the utmost of my power. But in
this inactive state of body my soul is still alive, producing
thoughts and sentiments; its moral and internal faculties, appear
to have augmented by the death of every earthly and temporal
concern; my body is only an embarrassment, an obstacle, which I
already endeavour to disengage myself from.</p>

<p>A situation so singular, certainly deserves to be both examined
and described; it is to this examination I consecrate my future
days, and in order to accomplish it with success, I should proceed
with circumspection and methods but I am incapable of such labour,
nay it would even divert me from my purpose, which is to render an
account to myself of the successive modifications of my soul. In
some measure, I perform the operation on myself, which physicians
do on the air, in order to ascertain the daily condition of it;
applying (if I may use the expression) the barometer to my soul,
not doubting but these experiments, well directed, and constantly
repeated, will procure information equally to be depended on; but I
do not equally extend my views, content with keeping a register of
operations, without seeking to reduce them into a system. I
undertake the same enterprise Montaigne did, but for a direct
contrary purpose; he wrote his Essays only for others, I my
Reveries entirely for myself. If in my more advanced age, and on
the verge of dissolution, I remain (according to my present wish)
in the same disposition, I shall recollect, on reading these
Reveries, the pleasure I experienced on writing them; and thus,
recalling past time, shall redouble my existence. Even in spite of
mankind, I shall yet enjoy the charms of society, and, when
decrepit with age, hold converse with myself, as I now should with
a friend younger than I am.</p>

<p>I wrote the first of my Confessions, and my Dialogues, in
continual care; being anxious to preserve them from the rapacious
hands of my enemies, and transmit them, if possible, to other
generations, This uneasiness no longer torments me, I know what I
write will be useless, and a desire to be better known by mankind
is extinguished in my heart, where nothing remains but profound
indifference on the fate of my real writings and monuments of my
innocence, which, perhaps, are by this time totally annihilated.
Let them watch all my motions, and disquiet themselves about these
sheets; let them seize, suppress, and defame them, it is
henceforward absolutely equal to me; I will neither conceal, or
endeavour to make them public; if they are taken from me while I
live, they cannot deprive me of the pleasure of having wrote them,
the remembrance of their contents, or the solitary meditations of
which they are the transcript, and whose source can only be
exhausted with my being.</p>

<p>If, at the beginning of my calamities, I had but known how to
refrain from struggling with my fate; could I have adopted the
method I do at present; all the efforts of man, all their
tremendous contrivances, would have been ineffectual; their plots
would no more have destroyed my tranquillity, than the success of
them can henceforward. Let them enjoy my disgrace, they cannot
debar me from the enjoyment of my innocence; and I shall conclude
my days in peace, spite of all their machinations.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Second Walk</h2>

<p>HAVING resolved to describe the habitual state of my soul, in
the most unaccountable situation that ever mortal experienced, I
can find no manner so simple and effectual, to execute this
purpose, as to keep a faithful register of my solitary walks, and
the reveries which accompany them; when I find my mind entirely
free, and suffer my ideas to follow their bent, without resistance
or control These hours of solitude and meditation are the only ones
in the day when I am entirely myself, and for myself, without
diversion, or obstacle; and when I can truly say, I am what nature
designed me.</p>

<p>I was soon convinced that I had begun this project too late; my
imagination, being already less lively, is not, as formerly,
enraptured at the contemplation, temptation of those objects which
animate it. I am less intoxicated with the delirium of my reveries,
there is more of remembrance than creation in their productions; a
cold languishment enervates all my facilities; the animal spirits
extinguish by degrees; my soul creeps painfully from its feeble
tenement, and were I deprived of the hope of that state to which my
soul aspires, because I feel a right to the expectation of it, I
should no longer exist but in remembrance. Thus, if I would
contemplate myself before my decline, I must at least look back
some years, to the time, when losing all hope below, and finding no
support for my heart on earth, I accustomed myself, by little and
littler to nourish it with its own substance, and to seek, support
entirely within myself.</p>

<p>This resource, which I adopted too late, became so fruitful,
that it soon recompensed me for every loss. The habit of retiring
within myself, made me soon lose the feeling, and almost the
remembrance of my sorrows; thus I learned, by my own experience
that the source of true happiness is in ourselves, and that it is
beyond the power of man to render those truly miserable, who
determine to be otherwise. For five or six years past, I have
enjoyed habitually those inward delights which are found in the
contemplations of mild, affectionate souls; the raptures, the
ecstasies which I sometimes experienced in my lonely walks, were
enjoyments which I owed to my persecutors; without them, I should
never have found, or known, the treasures contained within myself.
In the midst of so much riches, how was it possible to keep a
faithful register? Endeavouring to recall so many pleasing
reveries, instead of describing, I fall into them again; it is a
state which remembrance recalls, and which it would be impossible
to relate, did I entirely cease to feel it.</p>

<p>I experienced the truth of this in those walks which immediately
succeeded the project of writing the continuation of my
Confessions, particularly in that I am about to relate, and in
which, an unforeseen accident broke the thread of my ideas, and
gave them for some time a different turn.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the twenty-fourth of October, 1776, I walked after
dinner through the <i>Boulevards</i>, as far as the <i>Rue du
Chemin-verd</i>; from whence I gained the heights of
<i>Menil-montant</i>, and, pasting through the vineyards and
meadows, crossed, as far as <i>Charronne</i>, the lovely manor that
separates those two villages; after which, I took a circle,
designing to cross the same meadows by another path. While walking
through them, I felt that pleasure and interest which agreeable
prospects ever give me, frequently stopping to examine plants which
I saw among the grass. I perceived two which are seldom found near
Paris, though common enough in this place; one was the
<i>Pieris</i> <i>Hieracioides</i>, and the other the <i>Bupleurum
Falcatum</i>. This discovery amused me for a long time, and ended
by my finding a plant still more scarce, especially in a high
country; this was the <i>Cerastium Aquaticum</i>, which,
notwithstanding the accident that happened the same day, I
afterwards found in a book I then had about me, and placed it in my
collection. In short, after having observed several plants that
were in flower, the appearance and examination of which, though
familiar, ever gave me pleasures, by degrees I discontinued my
observations, and gave myself up to the no less pleasing
impressions they had altogether made upon me. The vintage, which
brings so many walkers from the city, had been over a few days; the
peasants too, having completed their autumnal labour, had retired
till the return of Winter should furnish them with fresh
employment; the country was yet green and pleasant, though the
trees, partly stripped of their leaves, presented the picture of
solitude, and indicated the approach of a more dreary season. From
these various objects, resulted a mingled impression of melancholy
and pleasure, too analogous to my age and fate, not to enforce the
application. I contemplated within myself the decline of an
innocent, though unhappy life, my soul still full of lively
feelings, and my mind yet graced with some remaining lustre, though
already faded with grief, and dried up by sorrow. Lonely and
forsaken, I felt the forward frost steal on me; exhausted
imagination no longer peopling my solitude with beings formed to
delight my heart. I said to myself, with a sigh, what have I to do
on earth; I was made for life, and am dying without having enjoyed
it; but this was not my fault, and I shall bear to the Author of my
being, if not an offering of good works, which I was prevented from
performing, at least a tribute of good intentions frustrated, found
sentiments, but given without effect, and a patience proof against
man's disdain. I was moved with these reflections, recapitulating
the motions of my soul from my early youth, during my riper years,
since my sequestration from mankind; and in the course of that long
retreat in which I shall conclude my days. I reviewed with
complacency all the affections of my heart, all its tender, though
blind attachments, those ideas, more consoling than melancholy,
with which I had sustained my mind for some years past, and was
preparing to recollect every particular sufficiently to describe
them, with a pleasure equal to what I felt on experiencing those
emotions Having passed my afternoon in these peaceful meditation, I
was returning very content with my walk, when I was drawn from my
reveries by the following event:</p>

<p>About six o'clock, as I was on the descent of
<i>Menil-montant</i>, just opposite the <i>Galant Jardinier</i>;
some people that walked before me having suddenly turned aside, I
saw a large Danish dog rushing towards me. He was running with his
utmost swiftness before a coach, and had neither time to stop his
speed, or turn aside, when he perceived me in his way. I judged
that the only means I had to prevent being thrown down, was to take
a high leap, so exactly timed, that the dog might pass under my
feet. This idea, which struck me with the rapidity of lightning,
and which I had neither time to consider or execute, was the last
before my accident. I neither felt the blow or fall, nor anything
that followed it, till I returned to my senses.</p>

<p>It was almost night when I came to myself, and found I was
supported by some young people, who told me what had happened. The
dog not being able to stop his speed, had leaped violently against
my legs, and with his size and swiftness had thrown me head
foremost with my whole weight on my upper jaw, on a very rough
pavement, and what increased the shock, Being on a descent, my head
fell lower than my feet.</p>

<p>The coach the dog belonged to immediately followed, and must
have passed over me, if the coach-man had not instantly pulled in
his horses. This account I had from those who took me up, and
continued supporting me when I returned to my senses. The state I
was in at that moment is too singular to pass without being
described.</p>

<p>The night was advancing, I saw the sky, some stars, and a little
verdure. This first sensation was delightful; and at that time I
felt nothing further. It appeared that I was just awakened into
life, and had inspired me with the charm of my new existence every
object that surrounded me. Fully occupied with the present moment,
I remembered nothing that had passed, had no distinct idea of
myself, nor the least notion of what had just happened. I neither
knew who I was, nor where I came from; felt no pain, fear, or
inquietude and saw my blood run as I would have seen a rivulet,
without thinking in any manner that it belonged to me. I felt
throughout my whole being the most ravishing calm, to which, on
recollection, I can find nothing comparable among our most active
and distinguished pleasures.</p>

<p>They asked me where I lived?&mdash;It was impossible for me to
resolve them. I enquired, in return, where I was?&mdash;They
informed me at the <i>Haute Borne</i>; they might as well have told
me I was at Mount Atlas. I should have demanded the name of the
kingdom, province, and part where I found myself; yet even that
would not have been sufficient to restore my recollection. It was
necessary I should recall to my memory every recent circumstance,
even to walking through the <i>Boulevards</i>, in order to
recollect my name and dwelling. A gentleman whom I did not know,
and who had the charity to accompany me some part of the way,
understanding that I lived at such a distance, advised me to take a
coach from the Temple to my own house. I walked very well and
lightly, without feeling any wound or pain, though I continued
spitting a great deal of blood; but I had cold shiverings, which
made my loosened teeth chatter very disagreeably. On my arrival at
the Temple, I Imagined that as I had walked without pain, it was
better to continue my way on foot, than expose myself to the danger
of perishing with cold in a hackney-coach; I therefore walked the
half league from the Temple to <i>la rue Platriere</i>, keeping on
without difficulty, shunning interruption and coaches, and finding
my way as if I had been in perfect health. I arrive at home, open
the door by a private spring, go up stairs in the dark, and enter
my apartment, without any accident, except the above mentioned fall
and its consequences, which I was not yet sensible of.</p>

<p>The screams of my wife on my appearance, informed I was more
hurt than I had apprehended. I passed the night without feeling, or
being sensible of my situation; but felt it the next day. My upper
lip was slit on the inside, quite up to my nose the skin having
prevented a total separation; four of my teeth were forced into the
upper jaw, and that part of my face that covered them was much
swelled and bruised; my left thumb extremely hurt, the right thumb
bruised and swelled very large; the left arm violently sprained;
the left knee swelled, and incapable of bending, form a large and
painful contusion, but with all this hurt nothing was broken, not
even a tooth, which happiness, in such a violent fall, was almost a
prodigy.</p>

<p>This is a true account of my accident, which in a few days was
spread all over Paris, but so altered and disfigured, that it was
impossible to recognize it. I ought to have expected some such
metamorphosis before hand, but so many ridiculous circumstances
were added, so many obscure private inferences were drawn, and they
were mentioned to me with an air so laughably discreet, that the
appearance of so much mystery gave me some uneasiness. I ever hated
ambiguities; they naturally inspire a horror, which those I have
been surrounded by for so many years have not been able to
eradicate. Among the singularities which attended this occurrence,
I shall only remark one, which will be sufficient to furnish some
idea of the rest:</p>

<p>Monsieur Lenoir, Lt. General of Police, with whom I had never
been acquainted, sent his Secretary to enquire after my health, and
make me pressing offers of service, which in my present
circumstances, did not appear of any utility or consolation. The
Secretary pressed me very warmly to accept them, adding, that if I
could not depend on him, I might immediately write to Monsieur
Lenoir. The urgency with which he Pressed this, and the air of
confidence that accompanied it, made me apprehend that some
mystery, was concealed under all this, which I fought in vain to
develop. So much was not necessary to alarm me, particularly during
the agitated state in which the accident and its attendant fever
had put my head. I gave myself up to a thousand uneasy and
melancholy conjectures, making commentaries on all that surrounded
me, which rather indicates the delirium of a fever than the apathy
of a man who no longer interested, himself in anything.</p>

<p>Another circumstance helped to disturb my tranquillity: Madame
D'Ormoy had sought my acquaintance for some years, by many little
affected insignificancies without my being able to divine the cause
of it; her frequent visits, without object of pleasure, seeming to
mark some secret end. She had mentioned the plan of a novel, which
she had a mind to write, and present to the Queen: I told her my
opinion of female authors, and she gave me to understand that this
project was formed for the re-establishment of her fortune, which
required protection. This reason was certainly an unanswerable one.
She afterwards informed me, that not being able to gain access to
the Queen, she had determined to give her book to the Public: there
was no longer any necessity to offer advice, which was not required
and which she would not have followed had I given it. She proposed
showing me her manuscript: I declined seeing it, and accordingly no
more was said on the subject.</p>

<p>One fine day, during my convalescence, I received this book from
her, printed, and even bound. In the preface were such gross
encomiums on myself, daubed on with such affectation, that I was
disgusted; the palpable flattery it contained, never been allied to
real good wishes, is what my heart was ever on its guard
against.</p>

<p>Some days after, Madame D'Ormoy paid me a visit attended by her
daughter. She informed me that her book had made a great noise,
occasioned by a note it contained. In running over the novel, had
hardly remarked this note; after her departure I read it over
again, examined it, and thought I could plainly discover the
motives of her visits, her coaxing, and all the violent praises in
the preface, judging they were designed to make the public
attribute this note to me, and consequently the blame its author
might incur under the circumstances in which it had been published.
I had no means of crushing this report, and the impressions it
might give rise to, all could possibly do, was not to suffer a
repetition of the vain and troublesome visits, either of Madame
D'Ormoy or her daughter for which purpose; I wrote the following
note: As Rousseau receives no author at his house, he thanks Madame
D'Ormoy for all former civilities; but declines in future the
honour of her visits.</p>

<p>She answered this by a very polite letter, but in the style of
all those written to me on similar occasions: I had barbarously
plunged a dagger in her feeling heart, and; I was to believe, that
possessing for me such true and lively sentiments, her death must
infallibly be the consequence of this rupture. Thus it is, that an
upright, frank behaviour, is made to appear like a fearful crime in
the eyes-of the world! And I am convinced I should seem wicked and
ferocious in the opinion of my contemporaries, though, they could
attribute no other crime to me than not being as false and
perfidious as themselves.</p>

<p>I had already been out several times since my accident,
frequently walking even to the <i>Thuileries</i> when, by the
visible astonishment of several persons I met, I was convinced
something new was stirring with respect to me, but could not
possibly conjecture what; till at length, I learned it was
currently reported, I had died from the effects of my fall, and
this news was propagated so rapidly, and maintained with such
obstinacy, that even a fortnight after, I heard it was mentioned at
Court as an absolute certainty; and the courier of Avignon (as
somebody took the pains to write to me word) in announcing this
happy news, had not failed to anticipate that tribute of outrage
and indignity which is prepared for my memory, on quitting this
world, by a kind of funeral oration. This piece of information was
accompanied by a circumstance yet more singular, which I only
learned by chance, and could never get any particular account of;
this was, that a subscription had actually been opened for printing
the collection of manuscripts that should be found at my house.
This convinced me that a parcel of fabricated writings were kept
ready to be attributed to me after my decease; for to imagine they
would print any faithfully that might be found at the time of my
death, was a folly that could never enter the imagination of any
thinking person, whom fifteen year's experience had sufficiently
enlightened.</p>

<p>These incidents; which were sudden, and followed by others not
less extraordinary, added fresh indignation to my feelings, which I
thought already callous, and the dark clouds that perpetually
surrounded me, revived the horror they naturally give rise to in my
heart. I fatigued myself with conjectures, endeavouring to develop
these, to me incomprehensible mysteries. The constant explanation
of these enigmas, tended to confirm my former belief, which was,
that my fate and reputation having been concerted and determined by
the unanimous concurrence of the present generation, could not be
over-ruled by any effort of mine, since it would be impossible to
transmit any deposit to a future age, without its having to pass in
this through hands that would be interested to suppress it.</p>

<p>But I now carried my conclusions further; the concurrence of so
many accidental circumstances, the situation of my most cruel
enemies, distinguished as it were by rank and fortune, all that
governed the state, all those who have the direction of the public
opinion, place-men, everyone in credit, seeming eager to find those
who had any secret animosity, and would join the general cry
against me; this universal agreement is too extraordinary to be
entirely fortuitous. The refusal of one single person to become an
accomplice in this persecution, one favourable event on my side, a
single unforeseen circumstance, as an obstacle to their designs,
might have staggered my opinion; but all dispositions, fatalities,
accidents, and revolutions, have contributed to further the
attempts of man by so striking a concurrence, that it appears
miraculous, and leaves me no room to doubt but their success was
established by an immutable decree, and a multitude of observations
both on the past and present, confirm me so entirely in this
persuasion, that I cannot help, henceforward, regarding that work
as one of the secrets impenetrable to human reason, which I
hitherto looked on as proceeding, from the wickedness of
mankind.</p>

<p>This idea, far from being melancholy, consoles and tranquilizes
my mind, teaching me resignation; though I cannot go so far as St.
Augustine, who was comforted even under the idea of damnation, if
such should prove to be the will of God. My resignation arises from
a more interested source, I must confess, but not less pure, and
more worthy, in my opinion, of that perfect Being I adore.</p>

<p>God is just; it is his will that I should suffer; he knows my
innocence: this is the foundation of my confidence, and both my
heart and understanding combine to assure me I am not deceived. Let
mankind and fate, therefore, pursue their course; let me learn to
suffer without murmuring; at length all things will regain their
natural order, and sooner or later my turn will be remembered.</p>

<p class="cpb">In Continuing to Learn I Grow Old</p>

<p>SOLON frequently repeated these words in his old age: in one
sense, I may repeat them likewise in mine; but it is a melancholy
science which I have acquired in twenty year's experience, even
ignorance is preferable to it. Adversity is, doubtless, a great
master, but a master whose lessons are dearly purchased, and
sometimes not worth the price we give for them. Besides, before we
have obtained sufficient knowledge from such tardy studies, the
season to profit by it is over. Youth is the proper time to acquire
wisdom, age is the period when we should practice it. I confess
that experience ever improves, but can only be of service for the
future. Is it not too late to learn how we ought to live, at the
very moment we are about to die? Of what utility are the
informations so lately and sorrowfully acquired on my own fate, and
the contrivances of those who have been the instruments of it? I
have only learned to know mankind, that I might feel more acutely
the miseries into which they have plunged me: this knowledge, only
discovering their snares, without enabling me to avoid them. Why
did I not always remain in that thoughtless, but pleasing
confidence, which rendered me for so many years, the scorn and
plaything of my pretended friends? So far from guarding against
their contrivances, I had not the least suspicion of them. I was
their dupe and victim, it is true, but I thought myself beloved,
and my heart enjoyed the sweets of that friendship with which they
had inspired me while I attributed to them an equal portion of it.
These pleasing illusions are melancholy truth, which time and
reason have unveiled, in making me feel my misfortunes, has also
shown me they are without remedy; that resignation is my only
resource; that all the experience of age, in my situation, is
without present utility, and utterly unprofitable for the future.
At our birth we begin that race whose goal is death; of what
utility would it be to learn to conduct the chariot with skill, at
the very end of our journey? To think of quitting it gracefully, is
all that is then necessary. The only proper study for an old man,
if any remains for him, is to learn to die, a business least
attended to in an advanced age, everything but that being thought
of. Old people hold more to life than children, and leave it with
more reluctance than young ones; because their cares having been
all for this world, they find on quitting it that they have lost
their labour. All their hopes, all their wealth, the fruit of so
many laborious watchings, must then be relinquished, having thought
of gaining nothing during life, which they can carry with them.</p>

<p>I began this study in good time, and if I did not profit by my
reflections, it was not for want of having made, or well considered
the weight of them. Thrown at an early age into the storms of life,
I learned by experience that I was not formed for this world, and
should never attain that condition which my heart felt the
necessity of. Despairing, therefore, to find happiness among
mankind, my ardent imagination leaped over that space of my
existence which I had yet scarcely entered on, as over a strange
inhospitable soil, wishing to fix my abode in a more tranquil
asylum.</p>

<p>This sentiment, nurtured by education from my infancy, and
strengthened during my whole life by that inexhaustible train of
sorrows and misfortunes which have accompanied it, has called me at
all times to the consideration of the nature and destination of my
being with more attention and care than I have observed in any
other person. I have seen many who philosophize more learnedly than
myself, but their philosophy (to use the expression) is foreign to
themselves. Wishing to appear wiser than others, they examine the
arrangement of the world, as they would study some complicated
machine through mere curiosity, contemplating human nature, that
they may speak of it learnedly, but without any thought of self
improvement; still labouring to instruct others, without
enlightening themselves. Some of these determine to write a book,
no matter what, provided it is well received. When wrote and
published, its contents interest the author no longer, except by a
wish to have others adopt the opinions it inculcates, and a
resolution to defend them in case of an attack; but he entertains
no idea of using it for his own improvement, or embarrassing
himself whether these opinions are true or false, provided no one
refuses them. On the contrary, whatever I desired to learn was for
nay own information, and not to instruct others. I have ever been
persuaded that before we set tip for teachers, we should acquire a
competent knowledge of ourselves, and of all the studies I have
pursued, while surrounded by the bustle of the world, there is none
I should not equally have applied to, had I been confined to a
desert isle for the rest of my days. What we ought to do depends,
greatly on what we ought to believe, and in all that does not
relate to the immediate calls of nature, our opinions are the rule
of our actions. Governed by these principles, which were ever mine,
I long and repeatedly sought to regulate the enjoyment of my life,
to discover its real allotment, and was, at length, consoled for my
want of aptitude in conducting myself skilfully in this world, on
feeling it; is a science we should not endeavour to attain.</p>

<p>Born in a family where morality and piety were conspicuous,
afterwards brought up by a minister remarkable for wisdom and
religion, I imbibed principles, maxims, some will say prejudices,
which have never forsaken me. Given up to my own government, while
yet a child, allured by caresses, seduced by vanity, and
constrained by necessity, I became a Catholic, but still remained a
Christian. Confirmed in time by habit, my heart was sincerely
attached to my new religion the instructions and example of Madame
de Warrens gave stability to this attachment, the rural solitude in
which I passed the flower of my youth, the study of good books, to
which I applied myself, strengthened these natural propensities and
affectionate dispositions, rendering me religious almost after the
manner of <i>Fenelon</i>. Placed in a calm retreat, meditation, the
study of Nature, the contemplation of the universe, incessantly
carries the thoughts of a recluse, towards the Author of all these
objects, prompting him to search with pleasing inquietude the final
destination of what he sees, and the source of his feelings.
Afterwards, when my destiny again threw me in the torrent of the
world, I recognized nothing that could delight my heart for a
single moment. The regret of my peaceful leisures continually
pursued me, and mingled indifference and disgust with every
pleasure that was within my reach, and with every pursuit that
could conduct me to riches or honour. Irresolute in my
unsatisfactory wishes, I hoped little, obtained less, and felt, in
the allurements of prosperity, that even should I obtain all I
believed myself in search of I should not find that happiness my
heart so ardently sought after, without entertaining any precise,
idea of its object. Thus, everything contributed to detach my
affections from this world, even before misfortunes had entirely
estranged me from it. To the age of forty I continued floating
between indigence and riches, wisdom and folly, full of habitual
failings, without any vicious inclinations; living at hazard,
without being guided by principles, or regulated by reason;
wavering in my duties, without despising them, but frequently
without comprehending their tendency.</p>

<p>From my youth, I had fixed on the age of forty as the period of
my efforts and pretensions of every kind, fully resolved, that when
I should attain that age, in whatever situation I might find
myself, I would contentedly remain there for the rest of my life,
living from day to day, without care for my future subsistence.
When that period arrived, I executed my resolution without regret;
and though my fortune seemed inclined to take a more favourable
turn, relinquished it, not only without pain, but even with a
sensible satisfaction. In renouncing every false hope and
allurement, I delivered myself up to that calm repose which was
ever my predominant taste, the most durable of my inclinations. I
gave up the world and its vanities, and renounced all superfluous
ornaments, no longer wore a sword, watch, white stockings, or lace,
confining myself to a good cloth suit, with a plain wig, and what
was still better, rooted, from my heart, those covetings and
desires which stamped a value on those objects. I gave up the
situation I then occupied, for which I felt Nature: had not
designed me, and; set about copying music at so much a page, and
employment always had a decided inclination for.</p>

<p>I did not confine my reform to exteriors. I was sensible that
these privations required others, more difficult, doubtless, but
far more necessary, and resolving not to do my work by halves,
undertook: to submit my interior to a strict examination, which
might reduce it to that state I should wish to find it in at my
death.</p>

<p>A remarkable resolution which had lately taken place in me, a
new moral world which began to present itself, the unreasonable
judgment of mankind, which (without foreseeing how much I should
become its victim) I began to feel the absurdity of, the increasing
necessity of a more substantial good than literary fame, which
inclination had securely reached me before I felt myself disgusted
with it, the desire to pursue, for the remainder of my life, a more
salutary course than that which had employed the most valuable part
of it; in a word, every consideration tended to point out the
immediate necessity of this reform, which I had long felt the want
of, I undertook it, therefore, and spared nothing that depended on
me to render the execution of my enterprise effectual.</p>

<p>It is from this epoch, that I may date an entire renunciation of
the world, and an increased desire for solitude, which has never
since forsaken me. The work I had resolved on could not be
accomplished without an absolute retreat; it required long and
uninterrupted meditations, which the tumult of society would not
admit; this forced me to adopt, for some time, a different manner
of life, and presently I so well relished its enjoyments, that I
never discontinued it since, except at intervals and by constraint,
ever returning to it again, then opportunity offered, with
redoubled affection; and, in the sequel, when mankind had rendered
this sequestration necessary, I found that what they supposed would
have rendered me miserable, turned out my greatest happiness, which
I could not otherwise have procured myself.</p>

<p>I entered on the work I had resolved-to undertake with a zeal
proportioned to its importance, and the necessity I felt to perfect
it. At that time I lived, I lived among modern philosophers, who
bear little; resemblance to the ancients; these, instead of
removing doubts or fixing irresolutions, presently staggered all
those certitudes which I thought it necessary to obtain
confirmation of; for your ardent missionaries of atheism, and
furious dogmatists, cannot endure those who differ from themselves
in the most trifling particular. I frequently defended my opinion
weakly, partly from a dislike to disputes, and partly for want of
talents to maintain them; but I never adopted their distressing
doctrines; and this resistance, to intolerant minds, who, besides,
had private views to answer, was not one of the least causes of
their animosity.</p>

<p>They had not prevailed on me to adopt their sentiments, but they
had rendered me uneasy in my own: their arguments had staggered,
but not convinced me I could not think of any pertinent answers,
but I felt their objections were not unanswerable; I accused myself
less of error than ineptitude, and my feelings, disputed much
better than my reason.</p>

<p>At length, I said, shall I forever: suffer myself to be tossed
about by the sophism of these plausible reasoners, when I am not
even certain that they believe what they preach to others with so
much earnestness? Those passions which govern their opinions,
self-interest, which demands you should believe this or that,
render it impossible to penetrate their true sentiments. Should we
seek for the simplicity of truth in the leaders of a party? Their
philosophy is designed for others, I must have one of my own: let
me seek it diligently while it is yet time that I may possess a
fixed rule for the conduct of my latter days. I am now in a mature
age, possessed of all the powers of my understanding, already I
approach the decline; if I wait longer, my intellectual faculties
will have lost their activity, and my tardy deliberations may be
less useful than they promise to be at this time: I will,
therefore, seize the present moment; it is the epoch of my external
and mental reform; let me ultimately fix my opinions and
principles, remaining for the residue of my life, what mature
deliberation shall convince me I ought to be.</p>

<p>I executed this project slowly, and at different times, but with
as much application and care as I was capable of employing, being
fully persuaded that the repose of my life and future happiness
depended on it. At first, I found myself in such a labyrinth of
embarrassments, difficulties, objections, and obscurity, that I was
tempted twenty, times over to abandon all, to renounce my vain
researches, and level my deliberations to the rules of common
prudence, without searching further into those principles it was so
much labour to develop; but this prudence was foreign to my
disposition, and I felt myself no more able to adopt it, than I
should have been to profit by its admonitions; labouring to acquire
it, therefore, was failing over a stormy sea without rudder or
compass, in search of a light-house, which, when found, directed to
no port.</p>

<p>I persisted, notwithstanding every discouragement: for the first
time in my life, I possessed courage, and to that I am indebted for
having been able to sustain the horrible destiny which from that,
period began to envelope me, without my entertaining the least idea
of its approach. After the most ardent and sincere researches that
were ever undertaken, perhaps, by one mortal, I determined on those
sentiments for the residue of my life, which appeared reasonable
and necessary, and, if I have been mistaken in the result, have at
least the consolation of knowing, that my errors cannot be imputed
to me as a crime, since I used my utmost efforts to guard against
mistakes. I make no doubt but the prejudices of childhood, and the
secret wishes of my heart, may have inclined the balance to that
side which procured me most consolation; for is it difficult to
defend our belief from what we ardently desire. Who can doubt, but
being interested to admit or reject particular notions of a future
state, determines the belief of the major part of mankind, through
the medium of their hopes and fears? These, I allow, might
fascinate my judgment, but not render my faith less sincere, for I
examined cautiously, and feared to be mistaken in every particular.
If our whole term of existence is confined to this life, it was
expedient for me to know this, that I might take my measures
accordingly, while some part of my being remained, and before I was
completely duped; but what I had most to fear, in my present
undertaking, was, venturing the everlasting state of my soul for
the sake of temporal enjoyments, which in my opinion, were never
very desirable.</p>

<p>I confess that I did not answer to my own satisfaction all the
difficulties that had embarrassed me, and which our philosophers
had so often thundered in my ears; but being determined to decide
on points which human understanding has so little direction to, and
finding on all hands impenetrable mysteries and unanswerable
objections, I adopted in each question, such sentiments as appeared
to me best established, and most conformable to reason, without
stopping at those objections which I could not resolve, and which I
knew were opposed by others, not less powerful, in the opposite
system. A dogmatical method of treating these subjects is only
conformable to a spirit of imposition; meantime, it is necessary to
have a belief of one's own, and to select it with all possible
maturity of judgment. If, in spite of these precautions, we yet
fall into error, we cannot in justice be pronounced culpable, since
we have not erred either wilfully or carelessly. This was the
immovable principle which I established as the basis of my
security.</p>

<p>The result of my wearisome researches were nearly those opinions
which I have since put together in the Confession of Faith of my
Savoyard Vicar, a work that has been unworthily profaned by the
present generation, but which may one day cause a revolution in the
opinions of mankind, if good sense and truth should ever revive
among them.</p>

<p>From this time, easy in the principles I had adopted, after such
long and painful meditation, I have made them the fixed rule of my
conduct and belief, without perplexing myself, either with those
objections I cannot resolve, or those I could not foresee, and
which, presenting themselves from time to time, have sometimes
staggered, but never overthrown me. I have ever said, these are but
metaphysical subtleties, arguments which should have no weight
against found principles, adopted by reason, confirmed by the
feelings of my heart, and bearing the seal of inward approbation,
by the silence and subjection of the passions. In these concerns,
so superior to human understanding, shall one objection, which I
cannot resolve, overthrow a body of doctrine so well constructed,
so firmly connected, composed with so much meditation and care, so
well appropriated to my understanding, my heart, my whole being,
and reinforced by that, internal satisfaction which I feel wanting
in all others? No vain delusive arguments shall ever; destroy that
affinity which I perceive between my immortal nature, and the
construction of this world, with the exact order which reigns
therein. I find in the correspondent and moral order of things,
from whence the system I have adopted results, those very resources
which I stand in need of to support the miseries of life. In any
other system I should live without comfort, and die without hope,
being the most miserable of all creatures; let me then adhere to
that opinion which is alone sufficient to make me happy, in spite
of fortune or mankind.</p>

<p>This deliberation, and the conclusion I drew from it, seemed
dictated by reason itself, as a preparation for the destiny that
was approaching, which might enable me to sustain it. What would
have been my fate, or what would yet become of me, among the
dreadful trials with which I have been surrounded, and in the
incredible situation to which I am reduced for the rest of my life,
if without asylum from my implacable persecutors, indemnification
for the scandals which have been heaped on me by the world, or hope
of ever obtaining that justice I feel due to me, I saw myself given
up without future hope to the most horrible fate a mortal can
possibly experience? While tranquil in my innocence I pictured
nothing but affection and benevolence among mankind, my believing,
confident heart was laid open to them as to friends and brothers;
meanwhile, the traitors silently entangled me in nets forged at the
bottom of Hell. Surprised by the most unforeseen of all
misfortunes, the most terrible for a feeling haughty soul, dragged
into the snare without knowing why, or to what end, I plunged into
an abyss of ignominy, surrounded by fearful obscurity, through
which I could discover nothing but distressing objects. On the
first surprise, I was overwhelmed, and should never have recovered
from the fit of horror these unforeseen misfortunes plunged me
into, had I not already, laid up a magazine of strength, which
served to raise me from my fall.</p>

<p>It was not until after years of agitation, that recovering my
spirits, and beginning to return to myself, I felt the full value
of those resources I had procured for my moments of adversity;
when, deciding on all those things which I saw it necessary to form
a judgment of, I saw, in comparing my maxims with my situation,
that I gave infinitely more importance to the opinions of men, and
the little wants of this transitory existence, than, they deserved;
since this life, being but a state of probation, it is immaterial
what kind of trials we experienced in it, provided they produced
the designed effect; consequently, the greater and more multiplied
our afflictions are, the more meritorious it is to sustain them
properly. The most acute troubles lose their edge with those who
consider the great and sure reward that attends them; and the
certainty of obtaining this recompense, was the principal fruit I
had gathered from my former meditation.</p>

<p>It is true, that in the midst of those numberless outrages, and
unbounded indignities, which overwhelmed me from all parts, some
intervals of uneasiness and doubt, from time to time, shook my
hopes, and disturbed my tranquillity. The powerful objections,
which I could not resolve, during these moments of despondency,
presented themselves to my mind with redoubled strength, and added
to the hopelessness of my situation, when weighed down with my
destiny, I was ready to give up all for lost. Frequently, new
arguments which I heard, took hold of my thoughts, and strengthened
those that already tormented me.&mdash;"Alas!" said I, my heart
overwhelmed with grief, "what shall save me from utter despair, if,
in the darkness of my fate, I contemplate only as chimeras those
consolations which my reason had collected? If destroying thus, its
own work, it strikes away the prop of hope and confidence it had
procured me in adversity, what support have I but those illusions
which amuse myself alone? The whole present generation viewing only
errors and prejudices in what I singly adopt, finding truth and
evidence in a contrary system, and appearing scarce able to believe
that I am sincere in my profession of them; while giving into these
opinions with my utmost belief, I find insurmountable difficulties,
which yet do not prevent me from persisting in them. Am I, then,
alone wise and enlightened among mankind? To be persuaded that
things are thus, is it sufficient that they accord; with my ideas,
and that I find this order of them convenient? Can I derive a firm
confidence from appearances, which have no solidity for the rest of
mankind, and which would appear delusive even to myself if my heart
did not support my reason? Ought I not rather to have sought my
persecutors with equal weapons, by adopting their maxims, than to
depend on delusions of my own, and become a prey to their attempts,
without a single effort to replace them? I think myself prudent,
while, perhaps, I am but the dupe, victim, and martyr of a vain,
error."</p>

<p>How many times, in these moments of doubt and uncertainty, have
I been ready to abandon, myself to despair! and had I ever passed a
month in that state, it would have been all over with me in this
world; but their attacks, though frequent, were short, and though
even yet I am not entirely delivered from them, they have become so
scarce and momentary, that they have not even strength to interrupt
my felicity, being light inquietudes, which, no longer affect my
soul, any more than the falling of a feather into a river, can
affect its course.</p>

<p>I am convinced that re-considering those points which I had
formerly concluded on, is supposing myself to possess more
information, more discernment, or a greater degree of zeal, than I
employed at the time these decisions were made; but I am persuaded
this is not the case, and no substantial reason can induce me to
prefer those opinions, which while overwhelmed with despair served
only to augment my misery, to sentiments adopted in the vigour of
my age, in the full maturity of my understanding, after the most
serious examination, and at a period when the serenity of my life
left no predominant interest but the investigation of truth. Now
that no heart is wrung with distress, my soul weighed down by
cares, my imagination bewildered, my brain perplexed by the
multitude of distressing mysteries which surround me; now when
every faculty, enfeebled by age and sufferings, have lost their
vigour, shall foolishly cast away those resources I had so
carefully procured, giving more confidence to the declining state
of my intellects, in order to render myself unavailingly miserable,
than to my reason, when possessing all its vigour, it endeavoured
to guard me against the anguish of unmerited misfortunes? No; I am
neither wiser, better instructed, nor more sincere than when I
decided these important questions. I was not then unconscious of
those difficulties which now perplex me, they were then surmounted,
and if at present some new ones start up, which I was not then
aware of, they are the sophisms of subtle metaphysicians, which
should not be permitted to invalidate those eternal truths which
have been admitted at all times, and by all the sages, which are
acknowledged by all nations, and are engraven on the human hearten
characters indelible. I knew when meditating on these subjects,
that human reason, circumscribed by the senses, could not
comprehend them in their full extent; I contented myself,
therefore, with that evidence that was within my reach, without
attempting what was beyond it: this conclusion was reasonable, and
I adhere to it with the full approbation of my heart and reason. On
what evidence should I renounce it, which might not be combated by
still more forcible arguments to continue, firm in my attachment?
What dangers do I find in this adherence? What advantages would
accrue from a change? That morality without root or produce which
they pompously display in some of their writings, or theatrical
representations, without an idea of its producing any effect on the
heart or understanding; or rather that secret and crude morality,
the inferior doctrine of all their adherents, to which the former
serves as a mask, which they only follow in their outward conduct,
and have so dexterously made use of with regard to myself; this
hostile morality, is of no use for defence, being good for nothing
but attack. Of what use, then, would it be to me, in the condition
I am reduced to? Innocence is the only support I depend on in my
sufferings, how much more wretched then should I make myself, if
relinquishing this last, this powerful resource, I substituted
wickedness in its place? Could I hope to rival them in the art of
mischief? And even could I attain to it, what consolation should I
derive from the retribution I might deal them! I should forfeit my
own esteem and gain nothing in return.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus with myself, I so far established my principles,
as to have them shaken no longer by captious arguments, or
unanswerable objections, by difficulties beyond my reach and
perhaps beyond the reach of human reason. Resting my belief on the
most solid basis I could possibly establish for it, I accustomed
myself to repose pose so securely under the shadow of my
conscience, that no contradictory arguments, either ancient or
modern, could have power for a single instant to shake or trouble
my repose. Declined into a languor and inactivity of understanding,
I have even forgot the evidences and maxims on which my belief was
founded, but I shall never forget the conclusions, which with the
approbation of my reason and conscience, I drew from them, and to
this point I will adhere. Let all the philosophers of the universe
unite to explode these principles, I will continue firm for the
rest of my life, in every particular to the decisions of that time,
when I was more able than I now am of choosing wisely.</p>

<p>Tranquil in these dispositions, together with self approbation,
I find them supply that hope and those consolations, I stand so
much in need of in my present situation. It is impossible that a
solitude so complete, permanent, and distressing in itself, the
perpetually active animosity of the whole present generation, and
the indignities it is perpetually loading me with, should not
sometimes depress my spirits, that my hope should not be shaken,
and that discouraging doubts should not arise at times to trouble
my soul and sill it with distress; but it is then, when incapable
of those exertions which would be necessary to give me assurance,
that I recall my former resolutions; it is then that the care,
attention, and sincerity of heart, with which I formed them, return
to my remembrance, and bring back my fleeting hopes.</p>

<p>Thus confined to the contracted sphere of my former
acquisitions, I have not, like Solon, the happiness of gaining some
piece of information every day of my old age, since I find it
necessary to guard against the dangerous pride of endeavouring to
acquire that knowledge I formerly found beyond my comprehension;
but there remain few acquisitions to hope for on the side of useful
knowledge, many important ones remain on the side of those virtues
necessary in my situation. This is the proper season to enrich and
ornament my soul with those acquirements she may carry with her,
when delivered from this mortal body, which clouds every object,
and viewing the truth without a veil, she will perceive the poverty
and insufficiency of all that knowledge, which our learned pedants
are so vain of, and will lament those moments as lost in this life,
when she endeavoured to obtain it; but patience, gentleness,
resignation, and impartial justice, are possessions she will carry
with her; with these we may enrich ourselves incessantly, without
fearing that death should rob us of our acquisitions, or diminish
their value. It is to this invaluable study alone that I will
consecrate the remainder of my old age, happy if by the knowledge
of myself I can attain to leave life, not better, for that is
impossible, but more virtuous than I entered it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Fourth Walk</h2>

<p>AMONG the small number of books I yet continue to read, the
works of Plutarch are what I am most attached to, and profit most
by. This was the first study of my childhood, will be the last of
my old age, and is almost the only author that I never read without
reaping some advantage. Two days ago I read in his moral works, the
treatise, <i>How to profit by our Enemies</i>. The same day, while
ranging some papers which had been sent me by different author I
met with one of the journals of the Abb Rosier, to which he had
put these words, as a motto, <i>Vitam vero impendent</i>! Rosier.
Too well acquainted with the turns of these gentlemen to be
mistaken in this, I was convinced he meant to convey a cruel piece
of irony under this appearance of politeness? but on what could it
be founded? What reason was there for this sarcasm? What occasion
could I have given him? Wishing to practice the lessons of the good
Plutarch, I resolved to examine myself during my next day's walk on
the article of lying, being well confirmed in the opinion I had for
some time past entertained, that the <i>know thyself</i>, of the
temple of Delphos, was not a point so easily attained as I had
imagined in my Confessions.</p>

<p>The next day, having begun my walk in order to fulfil this
design, the first idea that presented itself to my imagination, was
the remembrance of a dreadful untruth, advanced in my early youth,
the recollection of which has troubled my whole life, and reaches
even to my old age, grieving that heart already rent by so many
sorrows. This lie, which was a great crime in itself, was probably
more terrible in its effects, which I have ever remained ignorant
of, but which remorse has pictured in the most distressing colours;
aid yet, were my dispositions at the time I committed this crime to
be considered, it could only be called false shame; since, far from
being occasioned by a design to injure her who was the victim of
it, I can vow, in the light of Heaven, that at the very moment this
invincible shame rent it from my lips, I would joyfully have given
every drop of my blood, to have turned all the evil of it on
myself. It was a delirium which I cannot explain, otherwise than by
saying (what I am persuaded was the fact) that my natural timidity
had mastered, during that moment, every other feeling of my
soul.</p>

<p>The remembrance of this unhappy crime, and the inextinguishable
and bitter remorse which has followed it, have inspired me with a
horror and detection for lying, which effectually secured me, ever
after, from that vice. When I first chose my motto as an author, I
was persuaded it was what I merited, and I made no doubt but I
should find myself worthy of it, when, on the insinuation of the
Abb Rosier set about a more serious re-examination of my
conduct.</p>

<p>Proceeding in this review with the utmost circumspection, I was
greatly surprised at the number of things I had mentioned as
truths, which were purely of my own invention, at the very time,
when proud of my love of truth, I sacrificed to it my safety,
interest, and person, with an impartiality, perhaps, without
example.</p>

<p>What surprised me most, on the recollection of these inventions,
was to find I had never experienced any real repentance on that
account I, in whom the horror of falsehood is so great, that I know
nothing my heart so much detests; I, who have braved sufferings,
which I could easily have evaded by a lie, by what unaccountable
extravagance of disposition could I be guilty of this folly for
mere pastime, without any advantage in view, and by what
inconceivable contradiction did I escape feeling the least regret
on that account, while the remorse of a single untruth has not
ceased to afflict me for fifty years? I was never hardened in my
crimes; moral instinct has ever conducted me right; my conscience
has ever maintained its primitive integrity, and even had it
sometimes declined, and faded with my interest, how, maintaining
all its uprightness on those occasions, where man, hurried away by
his passions, might at least plead human weakness as an excuse,
should it sleep over indifferent transactions, where vice had
nothing to excuse it? I was convinced, that on the solution of this
problem, depended the justice of that decision I had to pronounce
in this particular on myself, and after having examined it
thoroughly, I arrived, by the following means, at a conclusion:</p>

<p>I remembered to have read, in some philosophical treatise, that
concealing a truth we ought to divulge is to lie: It naturally
follows, from this definition, that to conceal a truth we ought not
to divulge, is not to lie. But he, who not being bound to speak the
truth, advances the contrary, does he lie? According to the former
definition it cannot properly be said he does, for if we give
counterfeit money to a man we are not indebted to, we may deceive
him, it is true, we do not rob him.</p>

<p>On these premises two questions present themselves for
examination, and both of great importance; first, on what occasions
we ought to speak the truth, since we are not always bound to a
declaration of it? and, secondly, whether there are situations in
which we may deceive innocently? This latter question is, I know,
already copiously decided on: negatively, in books, where the most
austere morality costs the author nothing; affirmatively, in
society, where the morality of books passes for an impracticable
jargon: leaving, therefore, these two authorities, let me
endeavour, from my own principles, at an attempt to resolve these
questions for myself.</p>

<p>Abstract and universal truth is the most precious of all things.
Without her, man would be blind; she is the eye of reason; it is by
her he is taught to conduct himself, and arrive at what he ought to
be, to perform his duty, and accomplish the end of his creation.
Particular and individual truth, does not always confer a benefit,
it is sometimes an evil, and frequently indifferent. The things a
man should be acquainted with, the knowledge of which are necessary
to his happiness, are not, perhaps, very numerous; but in whatever
number they may be, they are his property, and he has an undoubted
right to claim them wherever they may be found, and no one can keep
him from the possession of them, without being guilty of the most
unjustifiable of all thefts, since they are the common right of
all, and a communication deprives no one of his acquisitions.</p>

<p>As to those truths which are of no kind of utility, either for
instruction or practice, how can they become a debt? for since
property is only founded on utility, where there is no possible
advantage to be derived there can be no claim. An estate, though
barren, may be demanded, because, at least, it may serve to build a
habitation on, but an idle tale, indifferent in every particular,
whether true or false, cannot be of consequence to anyone. In the
moral order of things nothing is useless, any more than in the
physical. Nothing can become a debt that is not of some possible
utility; consequently that truth may become so, it must be that
species of it, by which justice might be affected; and it is
profaning the sacred name of truth, to apply it to those frivolous
objects, whose existence is utterly indifferent to everyone, and
the knowledge of which is absolutely unavailing. Truth, then,
divested of all possible utility, cannot become a debt, and,
consequently, he who is silent, or disguises it, in such
circumstances does not lie.</p>

<p>But can truths, however trivial they may appear, be utterly
without use? This is another question, that remains to be
discussed, which we will return to presently; at present, let us
pass to the second question.</p>

<p>To leave unsaid that which is true, and to speak that which is
false, are two things very different in themselves, but which,
notwithstanding, frequently produces the same effect. In every case
where the truth is indifferent, the opposite error must be equally
so; from whence it follows, by a parity of reasoning, that he who
deceives in advancing a falsehood, is not more unjust than he who
deceives by not declaring the truth. In respect to unmeaning truth,
error is not worse than ignorance; for example, whether I believe
the sand at the bottom of the sea to be white or red, is of no more
service than to be ignorant what colour it is. How can he be unjust
that injures no one, since injustice consists in wrong done to our
neighbour?</p>

<p>But these questions, decided in this summary manner, could not
yet furnish me with any certain rule for my practice, without many
preliminary examinations, which would be necessary, in order to
apply them with precision in all possible exigences that might
present themselves; for if the obligation to speak truth is only
founded on its utility, how halt I become a competent judge of this
expediency? Very frequently the advantage of one party is the
detriment of the other, and private interest is almost always
contrary to the public: &mdash;How then should we conduct ourselves
in these situations? Must the interest of the absent person be
sacrificed to him we speak to? Must we be silent, or speak that
truth, which being serviceable to one party, may be an injury to
the other? Is it necessary to weigh all that ought to be said for
public good, or distributive justice? And am I sufficiently assured
that I am acquainted with all these relations so fully, as always
to determine on the side of equity? Again; in examining what we owe
to others, have I sufficiently examined what we owe to ourselves,
and what we owe to truth for its own sake? If I do no wrong to
another, does it follow that I do none to myself? And does it
suffice, never to have been unjust, to be always innocent?</p>

<p>How many embarrassing discussions might we avoid by resolving
always to declare the truth, whatever might be the consequence!
Justice herself dwells in the truth of things; lying is always
iniquity; error becomes imposture when we give that which is not,
for the rule of what ought to be done or believed; and whatever
effects may result from truth, we are ever unblameable when that
alone is employed, and nothing of our own invention mingled with
it.</p>

<p>But this is cutting the question without resolving it. The
object of the present enquiry is not, whether we should always
speak the truth, but whether we are at all times equally obliged to
it; and, on the definition before recited, supposing we are not,
how to distinguish those cases where the truth is rigorously due,
from those we may be silent on without injustice, or disguise
without lying: for I have found that such cases really exist. It
remains, therefore, to discover a certain rule, by which we may
judge, and determine between them.</p>

<p>But whence extract this rule, and the evidence of its
infallibility? In all difficult questions like the present,
relating to morality, I have always found it safer to resolve them
by the dictates of my conscience, than by the information of my
reason. Never has moral instinct deceived me, having maintained
until now its purity in my heart sufficiently to authorize this
reliance; and if it has sometimes been silent in the presence of my
passions, has regained its empire over them in my recollections,
where I judge myself with as much severity, as, perhaps, I shall be
at the bar of the? Sovereign Judge of all.</p>

<p>Deciding on discourses from the effects they produce, is a
method very liable to error; for, exclusive of the consideration
that these effects are not always sufficiently obvious, they vary
to infinity, with the circumstances that produce them: we should
endeavour, therefore, to weigh the intention of the speaker, and
determine the degree of malice or benevolence they contain. To
advance an untruth, is not to lie, except it is done with an
intention to deceive, and even that intention, far from being
always attended by a mischievous design, has sometimes a quite
contrary tendency. But to render a lie innocent, it is not
sufficient there should be no injury intended; a fixed persuasion
should be obtained, that the mistake into which we lead the person
our discourse is directed to, can be of no possible detriment
either to him or any other: but it is difficult to obtain this
certitude, consequently it is very seldom that a lie can be
innocent. To lie for self-advantage is imposture; to lie for the
emolument of another is fraud; to be guilty of a falsehood that may
do harm is calumny, which is the worst kind of lying; and to
advance an untruth, without profit or prejudice either to ourselves
or others, is not lying, but fiction.</p>

<p>Fictions which have a moral tendency are called apologues or
fables; and as their design is only to convey some useful truth
under striking and agreeable similitudes, it is not necessary to
preserve even the appearance of reality, and he who invents and
relates a fable as such, does not lie in any respect.</p>

<p>There are other fictions purely idle, such as the greater part
of our novels and tales, which, without containing any real
instruction, aim only at amusement. A judgment should be formed of
these from the apparent intention of the author; but when published
under an assurance of being real facts, it is impossible to give
any other name than direct lies; meantime, whoever scrupled being
guilty of these falsities? Or, whoever seriously reproached anyone
with them as a crime? Suppose, for example, there is some moral
purpose in the <i>Temple de Gnide</i>, that object is secured and
vitiated by voluptuous descriptions and seducing images, which the
author has endeavoured to varnish over with an affectation of
modesty. He pretends this work was translated from a Greek
manuscript, giving such a history of its discovery as he thought
most likely to impose it on his readers for a truth; and if this is
not a direct lie, let anyone inform me what is? Yet no one ever
thought of reproaching this author with it as a crime, or treating
him as an imposture!</p>

<p>It will be said, this was but a pleasantry; that in making this
affirmation he never expected to be believed, and that the Public
never entertained any doubt but he was the inventor of this Greek
work, which he pretends only to have translated. I answer, that
such a pleasantry without object, would have been a very childish
amusement; that a liar is no less guilty of falsehood because his
lie is universally discovered: that we should distinguish between
the enlightened part of the Public, and the multitude of simple,
credulous readers, on whom the history of this manuscript, related
by a grave author with an air of seriousness, has really imposed,
and who drink that poison without scruple from an antique vase,
which they would have rejected had it been offered in a modern
cup.</p>

<p>Whether these distinctions are to be found in; any book is
immaterial, their existence is not less real in the heart of every
man who is in earnest, with himself, and will not indulge in
anything his conscience can reproach him with for the invention of
what is merely advantageous to ourselves is not less a lie than if
it tended to the disadvantage of our neighbour, though the cases
are not equally criminal. To procure an advantage for anyone which
he has no right to enjoy, is to subvert the order of justice.
Falsely to attribute to ourselves, or others, any action, from
which praise or blame, inculpation or exculpation may ensue, is to
be guilty of injustice; then, everything contrary to truth, which,
tends to the subversion of justice, is a lie, and this is the
precise boundary of that vice; but that which is not truth, yet has
no kind of influence on natural justice, is only fiction; and I
must confess, that whoever reproaches himself with simple fiction
as being guilty of a lie, has a conscience more delicate than
mine.</p>

<p>Those which are called good-natured, or obliging falsehoods,
are, notwithstanding, real lies; because an imposition, whether to
the advantage of ourselves or others, is not less unjust than an
imposition of a contrary tendency. That a man who bestows either
praise or blame contrary to truth is guilty of a falsehood, when
any real person is spoken of; but if imaginary beings only are
concerned, he is at liberty to say what he pleases, without being
guilty of a lie; provided he does not undertake to decide on the
morality of the imaginary facts, and forms no false conclusion, for
then if he does not lie in regard to facts, he lies against moral
truth, which is an hundred times more respectable.</p>

<p>I have seen those whom the world calls people of veracity, whose
regard to truth amounted only to being scrupulously exact in
frivolous conversations such as reciting with the utmost exactitude
every circumstance of time, place, and persons, not permitting
themselves the least latitude for fiction, or a single circumstance
to be embellished or exaggerated. In every particular where their
interest is not concerned, they maintain an inviolable fidelity in
their relations; but let any subject be started by which any
advantage may be obtained, every art is employed to represent
things in the most favourable light, and should downright lies
appear necessary, if they abstain from telling them, they take care
to act in such a manner, that others may adopt erroneous opinions,
without their suffering the imputation of falsehood, and thus, when
prudence takes the opposite side, bid adieu to veracity.</p>

<p>The man of real veracity pursues a direct contrary course: in
things perfectly indifferent, he pays little regard to that
exactitude which the other class so much pride themselves on; he
makes no scruple of amusing a company by feigned relations, from
whence no unjust conclusion can be drawn, either for or against any
person, dead or living; but every conversation which might unjustly
produce good or evil, profit or loss, esteem or disdain for anyone,
he considers as a lie, which is never suffered to take possession
of his heart, his lips, or his pen. He is of strict veracity, even
in opposition to his interest, though he prides himself little on
maintaining it in idle conversation. He is of strict veracity,
because he never seeks to deceive, but is as firm to the truth that
condemns, as to that which honors him, never attempting imposition,
either for his own advantage, or to the detriment of his enemies.
The difference, then, between the man of real veracity, and he who
only puts on the appearance of it, is, that the latter is most
rigorously punctual to that truth which costs him nothing, but no
further: while the former never adheres so pertinaciously to his
veracity as when sacrificing his interest to the love of it.</p>

<p>But it will be said, how can this relaxation, in regard to
indifferent concerns, be consistent with that ardent love of truth,
which I make the principal distinction of the man of real veracity?
Is not this love of truth contaminated in admitting such an alloy?
No; it is pure and sincere; it is an emanation from the love of
justice, which would scorn to be false, though frequently
fictitious. Justice and truth, in his idea, are synonymous terms,
which he uses indifferently. The holy truth, which his heart
adores, consists not in frivolous expressions, or in indifferent
actions, but in rendering everyone what is actually his due,
whether it may be imputations favourable or unfavorable, either
retributions of honour or shame, praise or disapprobation. He
scorns to do his neighbour the slightest wrong, either from
ill-will, or for his own emolument; his love of equity prevents the
former, nor would his conscience suffer him to appropriate to his
own use what belongs to another. He is ever most anxious to
preserve the esteem of his own hears, it is the satisfaction he can
least bear to part with, and he would feel a loss on acquiring the
approbation of the whole world, at the expense of his own. He will
lie, then, sometimes, in things indifferent, without scruple or
consciousness of acting wrong; but never to the detriment, or
advantage of his neighbour, or of himself. In everything that
concerns historical truth, in all that respects the conduct of
mankind, justice, social intercourse, or useful knowledge, he will,
to the utmost of his abilities, keep both himself and others from
error; and beyond this, he cannot conceive the existence of a lie.
If the <i>Temple de Guide</i> is a useful work, the account of the
Greek manuscript is an innocent fiction; if the work has an immoral
tendency, it is an unjustifiable falsehood.</p>

<p>Such were the rules my conscience established with regard to
truth and lying; but I felt, on examination, that I had followed
these rules instinctively, before they were approved by my reason,
moral instinct having ever made the application. That criminal lie
of which poor Marion became the victim, was followed by
inextinguishable remorse, which secured me for the rest of my life,
not only from all lies of equal turpitude, but from all those (of
whatever kind they might be) that could possibly affect the
interest or reputation of another. By this general exclusion I have
avoided the necessity of weighing whether the good which might
follow a deviation from truth, was greater than the evil; for in
thus marking the precise limits of lying, I have equally excluded
mischievous or good-natured untruths, and regarding both as
culpable, have forbid myself the use of either.</p>

<p>In this particular, as in most others, my disposition has
greatly influenced my maxims, or, rather my habits; for I was never
governed by rules, having ever followed the guidance of natural
impulse. Never did a premeditated lie take possession of my
thoughts, never did I lie for my interest, though frequently from
shame, to extricate myself from embarrassment, in things utterly
indifferent, or, at least, only interesting to myself when having a
converse ion to sustain, the tardiness of my ideas rendered my
discourse unentertaining, and obliged me to have recourse to
fiction, which might furnish something to say. When it was
necessary to speak, and amusing truths did not present themselves
to my mind, I made use of fiction rather than remain silent; but,
in the invention of these fables, I took every possible precaution
that they should not be lies; that is to say, that they should
neither wound justice, or interfere with that truth we owe to our
neighbour, confining those discourses to a kind of fiction
indifferent to myself and all mankind. I attempted to substitute
moral possibilities in the place of moral facts; to represent the
natural affections of the human hearts and draw some useful
instruction from them; in one word, to invent moral tales and
apologues; but it required more presence of mind, and facility of
expression, than ever I possessed, to turn the familiar chat of
conversation into useful instruction; its course, being too rapid
for my ideas, forced me, generally, to speak before I thought, and
by this means to utter ridiculous follies, which my reason,
disapproved, and my heart rejected, at the very moment they were
passing my lips, but which, continually preceding my judgment,
could not be reformed by its censures.</p>

<p>It is, likewise, from this sudden irresistible impulse of
constitution, that in circumstances entirely unforeseen, shame and
timidity frequently force lies from me, without my will having any
part in them, being produced by the necessity of an instant reply.
The profound impression of the wrong done to poor Marion, is
sufficient to restrain any that might be injurious to others, but
not to prevent those which serve to extricate me from
embarrassment, when none but myself is concerned, though not less
contrary to my conscience and principles, than those which might
influence the fate of others.</p>

<p>I call Heaven to witness, that if I could the next instant
recall the lie that has excused, and declare the truth that would
upbraid me, without doing myself an additional injury by such
manifest retraction, I would do it gladly; but the shame of
exposing myself thus evidently, forbids this acknowledgment, and I
sincerely repent my fault, without having the power to repair it.
One example will explain this better than all I can say, and show
that I neither lie from interest or self love, still less from any
mischievous intention; but merely from embarrassment and false
shame, though frequently conscious that the lie is obvious, without
even that consideration having power to prevent it.</p>

<p>Sometime ago M. Foulquier persuaded (contrary to my usual
custom) to bring my wife, and join with him and M. Benoit in a
friend dinner, which was provided for us at Mrs. Voussin's, the
tavern-keeper, who was invited to dine with us, as were her two
daughters. While we were at table, the eldest of these, who had
lately been married, and was now with child [...*] looking in my
face, asked me suddenly, whether I ever had any children? I
answered with confusion, that I had not that happiness; on which,
smiling maliciously, she looked round at the company, in a way that
sufficiently expressed her meaning.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Some words illegible in the manuscript.]</p>

<p>It is evident this was not the answer I should have wished to
make, even had I meant to deceive them, for I plainly saw by the
looks of the company that my answer would not change their opinion
in this particular. The negative I gave this question was expected;
nay it was proposed on purpose to enjoy the satisfaction of making
me lie, and I was not so stupid as not to perceive this. Two
minutes after, the following answer, which I should have returned,
presented itself to my mind. <i>This is a very strange question
from a young woman, to a man who remained a bachelor till his old
age</i>. Had I spoke thus, without lying, or making any avowal, I
should have had no cause to blush, since I should have had the
laughers on my side, with the satisfaction of having given her a
kind of lesson, which might have taught her to be more cautious in
questioning me impertinently. But I let this opportunity slip;
indeed I seldom say what I ought, usually blundering on the
contrary. It is certain, in this instance, that neither my judgment
or will, dictated the answer I returned, which was the mechanical
effect of my embarrassment. Formerly, I was less sensible of this
shame, avowing my faults with more frankness than confusion;
because I made no doubt, but the sorrow for them, which I felt so
strongly, would be perceived; but the eye of malignity wounds and
disconcerts me, as my unhappiness increases I become more fearful,
and never did I venture on a lie but from timidity.</p>

<p>I was never more sensible of my natural aversion to falsehood
than while writing my Confessions, for then temptations to this
vice were strong and frequent, had my disposition inclined that
way; but far from having concealed or used dissimulation in any
particular I had to charge myself with, by a turn of mind I find it
difficult to describe, and which proceeded, perhaps, from my
dislike to every species of imitation, I rather found myself
inclined to err in a contrary sense, by accusing myself too
severely, than by covering my faults with too much indulgence; and
my conscience assures me, that one day I shall be judged with more
lenity than I have already dealt to myself. Yes, I aver with a
noble elevation of soul, that I carried veracity and freedom as
far, or I dare believe further, in that work, than ever man did;
for feeling that the good outweighed the evil, I was proud to
divulge all; accordingly nothing was concealed.</p>

<p>I have never said less than the truth, I have sometimes said
more, not in regard to facts, but the feelings they produced; and
this kind of falsehood was rather an effect of the delirium of
imagination, than an act of my will. I do wrong even to call this
falsehood, for none of these additions deserve that name. I wrote
my Confessions in my old age, after having been disgusted with the
vain pleasures of life, which I had lightly ran over, and which my
heartfelt the insufficiency of. I wrote from memory; this
frequently failed me, of furnished but imperfect ideas; I was
obliged therefore to fill up these chasms by the assistance of
imagination, which never contradicted reality. I loved to dwell on
the happy moments of my life, and sometimes to embellish them with
ornaments, which tender regret for their loss supplied me with. I
represented those things which had escaped my memory, as I was
persuaded they had been, and perhaps, as they really were; but
never different from what I recollected of them. I might give truth
some borrowed charms, but never did I put lies in the place of it,
in order to palliate my vices or enhance my virtues.</p>

<p>If, sometimes, by an involuntary motion, while painting myself
in profile, I have exhibited that side which was least deformed,
these concealments have been fully compensated by others more
extraordinary, by which I have frequently concealed graces more
carefully than dissects. This is a singularity in my disposition
which mankind will be very pardonable in disbelieving; but which,
however incredible, is no less true. I have often exposed my faults
in all their turpitude; but I have seldom related what was
praise-worthy with every possible advantage, and I have sometimes
suppressed altogether what seemed to give me too much honour, lest,
instead of writing my Confessions, I should seem to have been
writing my panegyric. I have described my early youth without
dwelling on those happy qualities with which my heart was endowed,
and even sometimes concealing facts which would have put them
beyond doubt. I now recollect two in particular, both which
occurred while writing my Confessions, that I omitted them for the
above mentioned reason.</p>

<p>I went almost every Sunday to pass the day at Paques with
Monsieur Fazy, who had married one of my aunts, and who had a
manufactory there of India stuffs. I was one day in the calendering
room, looking at the brass rollers, whose brightness took my
attention and tempted me to rub my fingers on them; when young
Fazy, having got into the wheel, gave it about the eight of a turn
so suddenly, that the rollers caught the ends of two of my fingers
and crushed them. I screamed out, and Fazy instantly turned back
the machine; but my nails continued on the cylinder, and the blood
ran from my fingers. Fazy cried out with fright, hastened from the
wheel, embraced me, conjuring me to cease my cries, or he should be
undone. In the height of my anguish, his uneasiness affected me; I
was silent; we went to the carp pond where he helped to wash my
fingers, and stop the blood with some moss. He begged me with tears
not to accuse him; I promised him I would not, and kept my word as
well, that twenty years after, nobody knew by what accident my
fingers had been scarred, for they ever remained so. I was obliged
to keep my bed for three weeks on this account; it was more than
two months before I was able to use my hand, and when anyone
enquired how I came by this hurt, I said a great stone had fallen
on my fingers, and crushed them.</p>

<p class="poem">Magnanima menzgna! or quando  il vero<br>
Si bello che si possa  te preporre?</p>

<p>One circumstance, however, that attended this accident, rendered
it very vexatious; it happened to be at the time they were teaching
the citizens their exercise; they had formed a rank with three
other boys, who, with myself, in our uniforms, were to exercise in
the company which belonged to our quarter of the town, and I had
the mortification to hear the drum pass under my window, attended
by my three companions, while I was confined to my bed.</p>

<p>The other instance is similar, but happened when I was something
older.</p>

<p>I was at <i>Plain-Palais</i> with one of my acquaintance, whose
name was Plince, playing a game at mall. Happening to quarrel in
our game, we fought, and during the combat, he gave me a blow on
the head with the mall, so well applied, that, with a little more
strength, it must have split my skull. I instantly fell, and never
in my life was witness of such violent agitation as this poor boy
expressed on seeing the blood run down my hair. He thought I was
killed, threw himself on me and bursting into tears, even shrieked
out with anguish. I embraced him, as well as I was able, mingling
my tears with his, being sensible of an emotion that was not
without its charms. At length he endeavoured to stop the blood,
which yet continued to run, and finding we could not effect this
with our handkerchiefs, he took me to his mother, who had a little
garden just by. This good lady could hardly support herself on
seeing me in this condition; she retained strength enough, however,
to administer the assistance I stood in need of, and after having
fomented my wound, dressed it with lilies steeped in brandy, which
is reckoned an excellent vulnerary, and is much used in that
country. Her tears, and those of her son, penetrated my heart to
such a degree, that for a long time after, I looked on her as my
mother, and him and my brother; till after having been absent some
years, I gradually forgot them.</p>

<p>I was as secret in this instance as I had been in the former,
and an hundred circumstances of this kind have happened in my life,
which I was not tempted to speak of in my Confessions; so little
did I endeavour to make the most advantage of those good qualities
I felt in my character. No; whenever I spoke contrary to known
truth, it was in things that were utterly indifferent, and
proceeded from the difficulty I found in expressing my thoughts, or
the pleasure of writing, and not from any interested motive, or to
the prejudice of any person; and whoever will be at the pains of
reading my Confessions impartially, if that should ever be the
case, will find that those particulars which I have avowed are more
humiliating and difficult to be acknowledged than many of greater
atrocity, but less disgraceful, and which I have not considered,
because I never, with intention, committed them.</p>

<p>It follows from all these reflections, that the profession of
veracity I had made was rather founded on my own sentiments of
uprightness and equity than on the nature of things, and that in my
practice I have rather followed the dictates of my conscience than
any abstract notions of truth and falsehood. I have often invented
fables, but seldom lied. By following these principles, I have
often given my enemies advantage over me, but have done no wrong to
anyone, nor have I attributed more merit to myself than was my due.
It seems to me, that truth is only a virtue when considered in this
light; in other respects, it is only a metaphysical study, from
which neither good or evil can result.</p>

<p>I do not, however, feel my heart sufficiently satisfied to
believe myself absolutely irreprehensible In weighing so carefully
what I owed to others, have I sufficiently examined what I owed to
myself? If we should be just to our neighbour, we certainly should
be so to ourselves; it is an homage which every honest man should
pay to his own dignity. When I supplied the barrenness of my
Conversation with innocent fiction, I was certainly wrong, because
we ought never to disgrace ourselves in order to amuse others; and
when carried away by the pleasure of writing, I added to reality
invented ornaments, I was still more blameable, since to decorate
truth with fables, is in fact to disfigure it.</p>

<p>But what rendered me still less inexcusable was the motto I had
chosen, which obliged me more than any other man to a strict
adherence to truth; it was not sufficient, therefore, that I should
sacrifice my interest and inclinations, I should likewise have
conquered my weakness and natures timidity if should have shown
courage and strength on all occasions, and fiction or fable should
never have escaped the lips or pen which were particularly
consecrated to truth. Thus I should have resolved, when I adopted
that proud device, and this should have been continually in my
remembrance while I dared to bear it. Never did premeditated
falsehood dictate my deviations from truth, they ever arose from
weakness; though I confess this is a bad excuse. A weak soul finds
sufficient difficulty in abstaining from vice; but it is arrogance
and temerity for it to make profession of heroic virtues.</p>

<p>Perhaps these reflections would never have occurred, had not the
Abb Rosier suggested them. It is very late, doubtless, to put them
in practice; bus it is not too late to be convinced of my errors,
and to rectify my will: henceforward, that is all that depends on
me; but on this, and every other similar occasion, the maxim of
Solon is applicable to all ages, and it is never too late to learn,
even from our enemies, to be just, modest, and unpresuming.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Fifth Walk</h2>

<p>OF all the places I have inhabited (and I have been in some that
were delightful) none ever rendered me so truly happy, or left such
pleasing impressions on my memory, as the Island of Saint Pierre,
in the Lake of Bienne. This little island, which is called at
Neufchtel the Isle of La Motte, is little known, even in
Switzerland, no traveller, that I recollect, having mentioned it;
notwithstanding it is very agreeable, and peculiarly calculated for
the happiness of a man who loves to circumscribe his steps: for
though I am, perhaps, the only one in the world to whom Fate has
given law in that particular, I cannot believe I am the only person
who possesses so natural a taste, though, to the present moment, I
have never happened to meet with anyone of that disposition.</p>

<p>The banks of the Lake of Bienne are more wild and romantic even
than those of the Lake of Geneva, since the rocks and woods
approach nearer to the edge of the water, and in other respects are
no less delightful. If well cultivated meadows and vineyards are
not so numerous; if there are fewer towns and houses, there is more
natural verdure, fields, study retreats and groves; in a word,
agreeable and well-contrasted objects more frequently present
themselves. As there is no commodious road on these smiling banks
for carriages, the country is little frequented by travellers; but
is highly interesting to the contemplative philosopher, who loves
to ruminate at leisure on the charms of Nature, while retiring into
a silence broken only by the cry of eagles, the mingled warbling of
various song-birds, or the rustling of torrents which precipitate
themselves from the surrounding mountains. This beautiful basin,
which is almost round, contains near its centre, two small islands;
one, cultivated and inhabited, which is about half a league in
circumference; the other, smaller, desert and wild, which will in
time be totally destroyed, from the transportation of earth, which
is continually being removed to repair the devastation made by the
waves and storms on the larger one. Thus, in every instance, the
substance of the weak; is employed to give additional strength to
the powerful. There is but one house at this place, which is large,
agreeable, and commodious, this belongs to the hospital of Berne,
as does the whole island, and is inhabited by the Steward of this
estate, his family and domestics; who has poultry in abundance, a
dove house, fish-ponds, lie. The island, though small, is so
diversified by its various products and aspect, that it presents a
variety of prospects; being proper for every kind of culture, you
see alternately, fields, vineyards, orchards, and rich pastures,
shaded by groves of trees, and intermingled with shrubs of all
kinds, which, from the vicinity of the water are kept perpetually
fresh. A high terrace, planted with two rows of trees, runs the
whole length of the island, and in the middle of this terrace a
pretty saloon is erected, where the inhabitants from the
neighbouring shores meet and dance on Sundays, during the vintage.
In this island I took refuge, after the lapidation of Motiers, and
found its situation so delightful, and the life I led there so
conformable to my humour, that I resolved to end my days in this
place, and had no inquietude, except a doubt, whether I should be
permitted to execute this project, which did not accord with that
which carried me to England, for I already began to feel that
inclination, and those presentiments of future suffering which yet
pursued me. I wished this asylum had been made my perpetual prison,
that I had been confined there for life, and deprived of the power
or hope of quitting it; cut off from all communication with the
rest of the world, ignorant of what passed there, that I might
forget its existence, and that mine also be forgotten.</p>

<p>I was permitted to pass only two months in this island, but I
could have passed two years, a whole eternity there, without one
moment's weariness, though I had, except Teresa, no other company
than the above mentioned Steward and his family, who were all very
good sort of people, and nothing further; but that was precisely
what was necessary for me. I reckon these two months as the most
pleasing part of my life; I was so truly happy, that I could have
been satisfied with it during my whole existence, without a single
wish arising in my soul to exchange that felicity for another kind
of enjoyment.</p>

<p>What did this happiness consist of, and what was it I so
particularly enjoyed? I leave that to be guessed by the present
generation, from the description I shall give of it. The precious
<i>far niente</i> was the first and principal of these enjoyments,
which I indulged unto the utmost extent, and all I did during my
residence there, was but the pleasing and necessary occupation of a
man devoted to indolence.</p>

<p>The hope that nothing more could be derived by my persecutors
than to leave me in this lonely spot, where I had willingly
ensnared myself, which, it was impossible for me to quit with
privacy or without assistance, and where I could have neither
communication or correspondence, but through the medium of those
who surrounded me. This inspired me with expectation of concluding
my days in more tranquillity than I had hitherto passed them, and
the idea that I should have time to settle all at leisure,
occasioned me to neglect everything. Hurried there naked and alone,
I successively sent for my wife, my books, and some other little
necessaries, which I never had the pleasure of unpacking, but left
my cares and chests as they arrived, living on the spot where I
hoped to conclude my life, as in an inn, which I purposed to quit
the next day. I found everything here so perfectly to my mind, that
to have made any change would have spoiled all. One of my greatest
pleasures was, to leave my books well packed, and to have no
ink-stand, and on receiving any troublesome letter, which I was
obliged to answer, I borrowed the Steward's, grumbling the whole
time, and hastening to return it, with the vain wish that I might
have no more occasion for pens or ink. Instead of stupid
manuscripts and musty books, I filled my apartment with; flowers
and plants, for I was then in the first server of botany, which
taste the Doctor of Invernois had lately inspired me with, and
which presently became a passion. Rejecting, therefore, all
laborious researches, I was only for studies which suited an
indolent life, and would furnish amusement, without much trouble. I
undertook to compose: the <i>Flora Petrinsularis</i>, and describe
all the plants of the island, without a single exception, a detail
sufficient to have employed all the rest of my days.</p>

<p>'Tis said that a certain German wrote a book on the zest of a
lemon; I should have written one on each herb the field produced,
on every kind of moss that adhered to the trees, on each weed that
covered and: adorned the rocks; in short, I designed that not a
single blade of grass or vegetable atom should escape an ample
description.</p>

<p>In consequence of this noble resolution, every morning after
breakfast (which we partook of all together) I went, with a
magnifying glass in my hand, and my <i>Systema Natura</i> under my
arm, to visit a certain portion of the island, which I had, for
that purpose, divided into four parts, with an intention to explore
them successively in each season of the year. Nothing can be more
singular than the delight and ecstasy I experienced on each
observation of the structure, organization, and action of the
sexual parts in the fructification of vegetables; which system was
hitherto absolutely new to me. The distinction of generical
characters which I traced among common plants till others should
present themselves, and which I had not before the least conception
of, charmed me beyond measure. The long forked stamina of the
<i>Brunelle,</i> the observations I made on those of the nettle and
pellitory, the explosion of the fruit of the balfam-apple, and the
bud of the box-tree, a thousand little acts of fructification which
I observed for the first time, overwhelmed me with delight; I was
ready to run to everyone and enquire, whether they had seen the
horns of the <i>Brunelle</i>, as Fontaine enquired if anyone had
ever read Habakkuk. In two or three hours, I usually returned with
an ample provision&mdash;a stock of amusement for the employment of
the afternoon at home, in case of rain. I employed the rest of the
morning, in going with the Steward, his wife, and Teresa, to see
the husbandmen, and observe the harvest, usually putting my hand to
the work; and frequently, when the inhabitants of Berne came to
visit me, they found me perched up in a great tree, girded about
with a sack that I was filling with fruit, and which I afterwards
let down by a cord. The exercise I had taken in the morning, and
the good humour inseparable from it, rendered rest at dinner-time
very agreeable, but when it was too long, and the fine weather
invited me abroad, I could not spare so much time, and while others
were yet at table, I stole away, then leaping into the boat, rowed
it to the middle of the Lake, and when the water was calm, laying
at my whole length, with my eyes towards Heaven, let it drive
slowly with the waters, sometimes, for several hours, enjoying a
thousand pleasing, though confused reveries, which, without any
particular and fixed object, were, in my opinion, an hundred times
preferable to what I had ever found among the most delightful of
what are called the pleasures of life. Sometimes on being informed
by the declination of the Sun, that it was time to return home, I
found myself so far from the island, that I was obliged to labour
with my utmost strength to reach it before night.</p>

<p>At other times, instead of passing my time on the water, I
amused myself in walking along the verdant banks of the island,
where the limpid waters and refreshing shades frequently invited me
to bathe; but one of my most customary excursions, was a voyage to
the small island, where I used to disembark, and pass the afternoon
in extremely circumscribed walks, in the midst of water-pepper,
thistles, rook-stalk, and shrubs of every kind. Sometimes reposing
on the top of a sandy hillock, covered with graft, wild thyme,
flowers, and even clover, which possibly had been sown there
formerly, and was very proper nourishment for rabbits, who might
multiply there in peace, without fear for themselves, or injury to
anything. I made this remark to the Steward, who sent to Neufchatel
for some rabbits, and went with great ceremony, accompanied by his
wife, one of his sisters, Teresa, and myself, to establish them on
this little island, which they began to people before my departure,
and where, without doubt, they continued to increase, if they could
sustain the rigor of the winter. The planting of this little colony
was a holiday, and the pilot of the Argonauts could not have been
prouder of his office than I was on that occasion, while taking the
company and rabbits from the large to the small island; nor did I
forget to remark, that the Steward's wife, who was extremely
apprehensive of water, embarked with confidence under my care, and
showed no signs of fear during the passage.</p>

<p>When the Lake was too much agitated to permit my navigating it
with safety, I passed the afternoon in walking through the island,
herbalizing in all parts, or seating myself on some pleasant
solitary spot, enjoyed at ease the charm of contemplation. At other
times, I gained the natural terraces and heights of the island,
from whence my eye ran over the magnificent and delightful prospect
of the Lake and its shores, crowned on one side by the neighbouring
mountains, exhibiting on the other a view of open and richly
cultivated plains, beyond which the sight was lost among the bluish
mountains which bounded the horizon. On the approach of night, I
descended from these eminences, and, seated on the sands at the
edge of the Lake, or in some concealed retreat, where the roaring
of the waves, and commotion of the waters taking my attention,
chased the idea of every other agitation from my soul, plunging it
into delicious reveries, during which night frequently stole on me
unperceived.</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of the water, its continual noise, increased at
intervals by the wind, perpetually striking on the organs of sight
and hearing, kept up those inward sensations which my reveries
almost extinguished, just enough to make me sensible of my
existence, without the trouble of reflection; and if at times some
comparisons occurred On the instability of worldly concerns, which
were aptly compared to the troubled face of the waters, these light
impressions were quickly effaced by the continued uniformity of the
scene. Charmed, without any active concurrence of my soul, I felt
myself so powerfully attached to the spot, that when informed by
night and the appointed signal, that it was time to return, I could
not quit it without regret.</p>

<p>After supper, when the evening was fine, we walked all together
on the terrace, and breathed the fresh air from the Lake, or,
seated, in the pavilion, laughed, chatted, or sung some good old
songs, which were preferable to the laboured composition of our
modern ones; and, at length, retired to rest, content with the
pleasures of the day, and desirous of spending the succeeding one
in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Thus passed my time, during my residence on this island, when
not interrupted by unforeseen and troublesome visitors. But what
was there in all this sufficiently attractive to excite in my heart
regrets so lively, tender, and durable, that after fifteen years,
it is impossible to think of this beloved habitation, without
feeling myself in a manner transported thither by the ardour of my
wishes?</p>

<p>I have remarked during the vicissitudes of a long life, that the
periods of sweetest enjoyment, and most lively pleasure, are not
those whose remembrance wins and delights me most. These moments of
delirium and passion, however charming they might be, appear from
their vivacity itself, but as points thinly scattered along the
line of life, being too detached and rapid to constitute any
permanent idea of felicity. The happiness my heart regrets is not
composed of fugitive moments, but is an uniform and lasting
condition, which has nothing ravishing in itself, but whose
continuation increases the charm, till at length it arrives at
supreme felicity.</p>

<p>Everything fluctuates on earth; nothing remains in a constant
and lasting form, and those affections which are attached to
external things necessarily change with their object. We are ever
looking forward or backward, ruminating on what is past, and can
return no more, or anticipating the future, which may never arrive;
there is nothing solid to which the heart can attach, itself,
neither have we here below any pleasures that are lasting.
Permanent, happiness is, I fear, unknown, and scarcely is there an
instant in our most lively enjoyments when the heart can truly say,
May this moment last forever!!! How then can such a fugitive state
be called happiness, which leaves an uneasy void in the heart,
which ever prompts us to regret something that is past, or desire
something for the future?</p>

<p>But if there is a state where the soul can find a hold strong
enough to lean on securely, to attach its whole being to, without a
single wish to recall the past or anticipate the future, where time
appears avoid, and the present is extended without our noticing its
duration, or tracing its successions without any idea of privation
or enjoyment, pleasure or pain, desire, fear, or sensation, except
of our existence, that sentiment alone employing it, while this
state lasts, the person who feels it may call himself happy; not
possessing an imperfect happiness, poor and dependent, but a
complete felicity, perfect and full, which leaves no wish or void
in the soul.</p>

<p>Such is the state in which I frequently found myself in the
island of Saint Pierre, in my solitary reveries; whether stretched
in a boat which I let float to the will of the waters, seated on
the banks of the agitated Lake, on the borders of a beautiful
river, or by a brook murmuring over its pebbled bottom.</p>

<p>In what does the enjoyment of such a situation consist? In
nothing beyond ourselves, nothing foreign to our own existence, for
while this state lasts (like the supreme) the enjoyment of that
alone is sufficient felicity. The consciousness of existence,
divested of every other sensation, is a sentiment of contentment
and peace, which alone suffices to render it dear and satisfactory
to whoever can put away those sensual and earthly affections which
perpetually disturb and embitter our terrestrial felicity.</p>

<p>But the greater part of mankind, agitated by continual passions,
are little acquainted with this state, and having imperfectly
enjoyed it, during a few instants, perhaps, thence form a very
inadequate idea, which prevents their feeling its worth. Perhaps it
might not be convenient, in the present order of things, that, lost
in pleasing ecstasies, mankind should be disgusted with an active
life, since their multiplied wants have prescribed it as a duty.
But an unfortunate being, cut off from human society, who can no
longer perform anything useful here below, either for himself or
others, may find in this state a pleasing consolation, which
neither fortune or man can deprive him of.</p>

<p>It is true that these consolations cannot be felt by all minds,
nor in all situations. It is necessary that the heart should be at
peace, that no passion should arise to disturb this calm; it
requires not only a disposition adapted to it on the part of the
person who is to experience this felicity, but a concurrence of
surrounding objects; neither an absolute repose, or too much
agitation but an uniform form and moderate disposition, not subject
to sudden gusts of passion, or utter despondency.&mdash;Without
motion, life is but a lethargy; but if the agitation is unequal, or
too violent, it awakens our feelings, fixes them too much on
external objects, destroys the pleasure of the reverie, and,
tearing us from ourselves, instantly replaces us under the yoke of
fortune and mankind, giving us back the sensation of our
misfortunes. Absolute rest is productive of melancholy, and
presents the image of death; then the assistance of a cheerful
imagination is necessary, which voluntarily presents its aid to
those on whom Heaven has bestowed it. This degree of emotion,
therefore, if not supplied by outward objects, should arise from
within ourselves; this lessens our repose 'tis true, but it is also
more agreeable, when the inward soul does nothing more than lightly
touch the surface. There should be only just enough to recollect
ourselves, and forget all our misfortunes. This kind of reverie may
be enjoyed in every situation where we can obtain tranquillity; and
I have often thought that in the Bastile, or in a dungeon, where no
object struck my sight, I could enjoy agreeable contemplations.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, these were more agreeably produced in a
fertile, though solitary island, naturally circumscribed and
detached from the rest of the world, where nothing but smiling
objects presented themselves, where no painful remembrances were
recalled, and where the society of a small number of inhabitants
was connected and pleasing, without being sufficiently interesting
to occupy me entirely; where, in fine, I could either give myself
up for the whole day to those occupations which were most
comfortable to my disposition, or to the most luxurious indolence.
The occasion was, doubtless, delightful, and a contemplative mind,
that could even produce agreeable chimeras, when surrounded by
displeasing objects, could enjoy itself completely when presented
with a concurrence of every charm that could fill the senses with
delight. Awaking from a long and charming reverie, beholding myself
surfeited by verdure, flowers and birds, letting my senses wander
to the distant romantic shores and vast extent of crystalline
waters, I connected all those pleasing objects with my fictitious
enjoyments, and returning by degrees to my reason, could scarcely
distinguish the point of separation between ideal and real
delights; so much did everything concur to complete the happiness
of that quiet solitary life I led In this charming abode. Why
cannot I recall it? Why cannot I go and finish my days in that
peaceful life, without ever quitting it, or seeing any inhabitant
of the continent, who might once recall those calamities of all
kinds, which have been showered on me during so many years?
Delivered from all earthly passions which are engendered by the
tumults of society, my soul would frequently bound above its
atmosphere, and anticipate its communion with those celestial
intelligences whose number it shortly hopes to augment. I know
mankind will beware of affording so quiet an asylum, but they
cannot prevent me from transporting myself each day on the wings of
imagination to that happy spot, and enjoying, for some hours, the
pleasure I tasted while I dwelt there. Was I on that island, my
pleasing reveries might be more conveniently enjoyed; but if I can
imagine myself there, is it not the same thing? It is frequently
more; for in addition to abstract and monotonous contemplation, I
join every charming idea that could vivify the scene. Real objects
frequently escape my senses, during these ecstasies; but the more
profound my reveries, the more expressively they represent ideal
ones. I am frequently in the midst of these delights, and they
appear even more charming than when on the island of Saint Pierre I
actually beheld them.</p>

<p>The misfortune is, that as imagination cools, they are
represented with more difficulty, and are of shorter
duration&mdash;Alas! 'tis when we are about to quit this mortal
covering, that we are most embarrassed with it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Sixth Walk</h2>

<p>SCARCELY have we a mechanical propensity whose cause might not
be traced in our hearts, if we knew how to search for them.
Yesterday, in passing the new Boulevard, to herbalize along the
side of the Bivre, next to Gentilly, I turned to the right, on
approaching the <i>Barriere d'Enfer</i>, getting into the country
on the road to Fontainbleau, and gaining the heights which border
that little river. This walk was very indifferent in itself: but
recalling to my memory that I had often mechanically taken the same
route, I sought within myself for the cause, and could not help
laughing on the discovery of it.</p>

<p>In one corner of the Boulevards, as you pass the <i>Barrier
d'Enfer</i>, a woman is daily stationed, during the summer, who
sells fruit, ptisan, and small loaves. This woman has a son, an
agreeable boy, but lame, who hobbling on his crutches, asks charity
of the passers by with a tolerable good grace. I scraped a kind of
acquaintance with this little fellow, and he never failed to pay
his compliments as I passed by, which was always followed by my
little gratuity. At first, I was pleased to see him, bestowed my
mite willingly, and continued to do so for some time with unabated
satisfaction, often listening to, and exciting his little prattle,
which I found very entertaining. This pleasure became habitual, and
found itself by degrees, I know not how, transformed, into a kind
of duty, which I soon felt the weight of, and particularly, as in
the preliminary harangue, which one must listen to, he never failed
to call me repeatedly Monsieur Rousseau, to demonstrate that he
knew me; but which informed me, on the contrary, that he knew me no
better than those who had instructed him. From that time, I passed
this spot less willingly and, at length, mechanically got into the
habit of taking a round when I approached this crossway. On
reflection, I discovered the reason of my conduct, for nothing of
all this had distinctly occurred till now.</p>

<p>This observation recalled successively a multitude of others,
which confirmed me in the opinion, that the true and primitive
motives of the greater part of my actions, are not so clearly
perceived by myself as I had supposed them. I know and feel, that
to do good is the truest happiness that the human heart can
experience; but this happiness has been long since out of my reach,
and it is riot in so miserable state as mine, that I can hope to
select one single action that would be productive of real good. The
greatest care of those who govern my fate having been, that
everything in respect to me should bear a false deceitful
appearance, a seeming virtuous motive, is no more than a lure,
which they present in order to lead me into that snare which they
have set to entangle me. I am fully sensible of this, and also that
the only good remaining in my power is to abstain from acting, for
fear of doing ill, without intending or knowing it.</p>

<p>I have known happier moments, when following the emotions of my
heart, I could sometimes bestow content on others; and I owe myself
the honourable testimony, that whenever I could enjoy that
satisfaction, I found it more delightful than any other. This
inclination was lively, true, pure, and nothing in my most secret
thoughts ever contradicted it, though I have frequently felt the
weight of those benefits I conferred, by the chain of obligations
they drew after them. On these occasions the pleasure disappeared,
and I no longer found in the continuation of my favours, that charm
which had before delighted me; but instead of it, a most
insupportable constraint.</p>

<p>During my short-lived prosperity, numbers had recourse to me,
and never, in any service I could render them, did I once refuse my
assistance; but those first benefits, bestowed in the full effusion
of my heart, forged chains of successive engagements which I could
not foresee, and whose weight I could not support. My first
services were, in the opinion of those who received them, an
earnest of many which were to follow, and whenever any unfortunate
circumstance threw on me the grapple of a benefit received, it was
all over with me; this voluntary and free gift established an
indisputable debt in all those emergencies which might occur
hereafter, without inability itself being a sufficient excuse; and
thus a very pleasing and rational enjoyment was, in time,
transformed into a burthensome obligation.</p>

<p>These chains, however, did not seem very heavy to me while the
public remained ignorant of them, and I lived in obscurity; but
when once my writings had made my person known (a great fault,
doubtless, but more than expiated by my misfortunes) I became the
universal resort of the unfortunate, or those calling themselves,
such, of all adventurers who sought a dupe, and of all those who
under cover of the great credit they pretended to attribute to me,
endeavoured to profit by my easiness. It was then I had occasion to
experience that every natural propensity, not excepting even
benevolence itself, when carried to extremes, and practiced in
society without prudence or discrimination, change their nature,
and frequently become as dangerous as they would be useful under
proper regulation. So many cruel experiments altered my disposition
by degrees; or rather, confined it within proper limits, teaching
me to follow my inclination of doing good less blindly, or deny
assistance, when it only served to favour the wickedness of others.
But I do not regret these mortifications, since they procured me,
by reflection, new lights on the knowledge of myself, and on the
true motives of my conduct in a thousand particulars, in which I
had been usually deceived.</p>

<p>I have found, that in order to do good with satisfaction to
myself, it is necessary I should act with freedom; that the
pleasure a virtuous action should bestow, is lost when once it
becomes a duty, and that the pressure of obligation is sufficient
to convert the most pleasing enjoyment into an intolerable burthen.
This conviction has greatly modified the opinion I long since had
entertained of my own virtue; for there is none in following our
inclinations, and doing good, because it procures us satisfaction;
but in vanquishing our propensities when duty demands it, ever
acting as that prescribes, which I have known less how to perform,
than any man in the world.</p>

<p>Born with a feeling and virtuous heart, carrying pity and
commiseration even to weakness, my soul exulting in every act of
generosity, I was humane, benevolent, and charitable, from
inclination, and even through the influence of the passions; my
heart alone being interested. I should have been the best and most
merciful of men, had I been the most powerful, and to have
extinguished in my breast every desire of vengeance, it was only
necessary to have put revenge within my reach. I should have been
just without constraint, though in opposition to my interest; but,
to the disadvantage of persons dear to me, I could never resolve to
be so. When my duty and heart were at variance, the former seldom
gained the victory, unless forbearance alone was necessary, then I
was frequently strong; but to act from duty in opposition to
inclination, I found impossible. Let duty, or even necessity,
command, when my heart is silent my inclination is also deaf, and I
cannot obey: I see the evil that threatens, and let it arrive,
instead of attempting to prevent it; I sometimes make an effort,
but it presently tires me, and I find it impossible to persevere.
Among the things I might easily perform, what I cannot do with
pleasure, I find it in vain to attempt. Yet more; constraint,
though in instances which naturally accord with my disposition, is
sufficient to deaden, and convert them into repugnance, or even
aversion, if it acts too strongly: this it was that rendered
painful the good actions required of me, though I should have
performed them freely had they been undemanded. Unconstrained
benevolence is what I love to bestow; but when those who have
received it, pretend to extort a continuation, under pain of their
hatred, and make out an obligation of ever continuing a benefactor,
because I once took pleasure in being such, from that moment
constraint arrives and inclination vanishes. What I then give into,
is from weakness, or false shame; good will no longer subsists,
and, far from applauding, I even reproach myself for acting thus in
opposition to my feelings.</p>

<p>I know there is a kind of contract, and even of the most
reasonable kind, subsisting between the benefactor and the obliged:
it is a sort of society which they form with each other, more
closely connected than that which generally unites mankind. If the
person obliged engages himself to gratitude, the benefactor engage,
in the same degree, to preserve for the other, as long as he shall
remain worthy of it, that good will he has thought fit to
demonstrate, and to renew those acts of beneficence as often as his
abilities will permit, and they should be required of him: these
are the express conditions and natural effects of that compact
which is established between them. The person who refuses the first
favour demanded of him, gives no right of complaint to the person
refuse but he who will not repeat a favour formerly granted,
frustrates a hope himself has authorized, deceiving and defeating
an expectation he at first gave rise to. This refusal is thought
more unjust and harsh than the first would have been, though
equally proceeding from that independence which the soul loves, and
which it cannot renounce without difficulty. When I pay a debt, I
fulfil a duty; when I bestow a gift, I procure myself a
satisfaction: the pleasure attending the former arises from
habitual virtue, that which attends the latter, is a spontaneous
effect of nature, and of an inferior quality.</p>

<p>After so many melancholy experiments, I have learned to foresee
the consequences which would result from following the first
impulse of my feelings, and have frequently abstained from a good
action I had both will and ability to perform, from a dread of the
obligation it might hereafter draw upon me, if I gave into it
inconsiderately. I was not always sensible of this fear; on the
contrary, in my youth, I generally became attached to those who
received obligations from me, and frequently experienced a return
of affection, founded more on gratitude than interest. But things
have changed their appearance in this particular, as in most
others, since the commencement of my misfortunes. From that time, I
have lived as in a new generation which bears no resemblance to the
former; and my opinion in regard to others has experienced as great
a change as theirs can possibly have done in respect to me. The
very people I was acquainted with in the former, appear quite
different in this latter generation, and (to use the expression)
have assimilated into it. Formerly, open, frank, and generous;
then, as they now are, having changed with the times, and acted
like the rest. How, then, can I maintain the same opinion for those
who have adopted sentiments quite contrary to those which gave rise
to it? I do not hate mankind, because I cannot feel hatred; but it
is impossible to refuse them that disdain they merit, or refrain
from, expressing my disapprobation.</p>

<p>Perhaps a greater change than was necessary has taken place even
in myself, without my being sensible of it: but what man could
remain unaltered in a situation similar to mine, convinced by
twenty years experience, that all the happy dispositions Nature had
implanted in my heart, were turned by my destiny, or the
contrivance of those who direct it, to the prejudice of myself or
others, and can no longer look on a good action demanded of me, but
as a snare under which some certain mischief is concealed? I am
convinced, that whatever the effect might be, I should no less have
the merit of my good intentions; but the interior charm is no more,
I feel nothing but indifference and apathy, for being persuaded,
that instead of doing an useful action, I am only duped,
indignation and self-love join the disapprobation of my reason,
inspiring repugnance and aversion, instead of that candour and zeal
I should have felt in my natural state of mind.</p>

<p>There are adversities which elevate and strengthen the soul, but
there are others which deaden and depress it, and of these I am the
prey. Had there been any bad leaven in my soul, the fermentation
might have been raised to excess, and made me frantic; but in my
present situation, it has only rendered me of no use in the world,
being incapable of doing a good action for myself or others. I,
therefore, abstain from the endeavour; and this state, which is
only innocent because unavoidable, makes me experience a kind of
pleasure in giving wholly without reproach, into the natural
indolence of my disposition. I doubtless go too far when I avoid
every occasion of acting, even where I see nothing but good can
result from it; but convinced that I am not permitted to view
things as they really are, I abstain from judging by appearances,
and whatever lure is thrown over any arguments for acting, their
being put in my way, is sufficient to convince me they are
fallacious.</p>

<p>Even from infancy, my destiny seems to have spread the first
snare which so long since rendered me liable to fall into others.
Born the most credulous of men, during a period of forty years, my
natural confidence was never once deceived: Falling suddenly among
a different order of beings, I gave into a thousand snares without
once suspecting them, and twenty years experience has scarcely
sufficed to acquaint me with my fate. At length convinced that the
demonstrations of regard and friendship they lavished on me, were
only falsehood and deceits I passed rapidly to the opposite
extreme; for when once we have quitted the natural bias of our
inclinations, no bounds contain us. From that time, I was disgusted
with mankind, and my will coinciding with theirs in this respect,
held me at a greater distance from the world than all their
machinations.</p>

<p>Do all they can, my repugnance can never amount to aversion.
When I consider the dependence under which they have placed
themselves to me, that I might remain equally dependent on them,
they inspire me with real pity. If I am not unhappy, they are so,
nor do I ever contemplate this subject, without finding their
condition truly lamentable. Pride, perhaps, has some influence over
my own feelings; conscious superiority forbids my hatred; they may
excite my disdain, but it can go no further; in short, I love
myself too well to admit of hatred for anyone; that would be
closing, contracting my existence, which I rather wish to extend
over the whole universe.</p>

<p>I had much rather fly than hate mankind. Their aspect strikes my
senses, and through them my heart, with impressions which a
thousand cruel circumstances render painful; but the uneasiness
ceases the moment the object that caused it disappears. While
present, I think of them in spite of myself, but never by means of
recollection, and when absent they are as if they did not
exist.</p>

<p>They are only indifferent in what relates to myself; for when
others are concerned, they interest and move me, like the
characters of a drama which I see represented on the stage; for to
render justice indifferent to me, my moral being must be
annihilated. Scenes of injustice and wickedness yet make my blood
boil with anger, while acts of virtue, in which neither affectation
or ostentation appear, make me even tremble with delight, and draw
tears of satisfaction from my eyes. But then, it is necessary I
should see and be convinced of their reality, since after what I
have experienced, trusting report, or the judgment of others, would
be madness.</p>

<p>If my person and features were as much unknown to mankind as my
disposition and temper, I should yet live quietly among them, and
their society might even be pleasing, while I remained a perfect
stranger. Given up without constraint to my natural inclination, I
should yet love them, if they never troubled themselves with me,
should exercise an universal and perfectly disinterested
benevolence, and, without forming any particular attachment, or
bearing the joke of any duty, would do for them freely, all they
have taken so much pains to incite by their self-love, or enforce
by their laws, dictated by vanity, and pursued with severity.</p>

<p>If I had remained free, obscure, and alone placed in the
situation Nature designed me for, I should have done nothing but
what was right, for my heart bears not the seeds of any mischievous
passion. Had I been invisible and powerful as the Almighty, I
should have been benevolent and good like him: it is power and
freedom that make good men, weakness and slavery never made any but
wicked ones. Had I been in possession of Gyges's ring, it would
have removed me from dependence on mankind, and have made them
dependent on me. When in my air-built castles, I have frequently
asked myself what use I should make of this ring? For a temptation
to abuse is very nearly allied to the power. Master of satisfying
my desires, everything within my reach, without a possibility of
being deceived by anyone, what could I have desired beyond it? Only
one thing: that would have been, to see all hearts content: the
appearance of universal felicity being alone able to inspire my
soul with permanent happiness, while the ardent desire to increase
it, had been my most constant passion. Just without partiality, and
good without weakness, I should equally have secured myself from
blind distrust or implacable hatred: because seeing mankind as they
really are, and reading the very bottom of their hearts, I should
have found none amiable enough to merit all my affection, few
odious enough to deserve all my hatred, or whose wickedness itself
did not dispose me to pity, by a certain knowledge of the misery
they procured themselves, while endeavouring to inflict it on
others. Perhaps, in my moments of gaiety I should have felt a
childish inclination for acting prodigies; but perfectly
disinterested for myself, needing no law beyond my natural
benevolence, and for one act of severe justice, should have done a
thousand of clemency and equity. Minister of Providence, and
dispenser of its laws according to my will, I should have performed
more useful and sagacious miracles than those of the Golden Legend,
or the tomb of St. Mdard.</p>

<p>There is but one single circumstance in which the power of
penetrating everywhere invisible could have drawn, me into
temptations which I might not have resisted, and once engaged in
these wanderings, whither would they have conducted me! I must be
little acquainted with the nature of my own heart to flatter myself
that these facilities would not have seduced, or that reason would
have withheld me in this fatal inclination. Sure of myself in every
other instance, by this I should have spoiled all. Whoever is
endowed with a power superior to mankind, should also be above the
weakness of humanity, without which, that excess of strength would,
in effect, only sink him below the most feeble, or what he would
actually have been, had he remained their equal.</p>

<p>Everything considered, I believe I had better throw away my
magic ring, before it has made me commit some folly.</p>

<p>If men determine to suppose me the reverse of what I really am,
and the sight of me increases their injustice, it is my wisest way
to shun, but not to be eclipsed, among them. Let them study arts to
conceal their contrivances; let them shun the light of day, and
bury themselves in the earth like moles, or let them look on me if
they please; so much the better; but that they, cannot do, they
will never, see any but the J.J. of their own imagination,
fashioned at their will, to be hated at their pleasure. I should do
wrong, therefore, to interest myself in the fate of this ideal
being, since it is not me they see under this form.</p>

<p>The conclusion I draw from all these reflections is that I was
never formed for civil society, where all is constraint, obligation
and duty; my natural love of independence ever rendering me
incapable of the subjections necessary to those who wish to live
well with mankind. While I act freely, I am good, and do nothing
but what is right; but the moment I feel the yoke imposed, either
by necessity or the will of mankind, I become rebellious, or rather
stubborn and useless; for when called on to act against
inclination, let what will be the consequence, performance is
impossible; nay, from weakness, I neglect even what my inclinations
call me to. I abstain from acting, for in that my incapacity is
conspicuous; my strength is merely negative, my very sins being of
omission, rarely of commission. I ever imagined that the liberty of
man consisted in doing whatever he felt an inclination for; but
never supposed it consistent with, being forced to do what is
disagreeable. An exemption from this is what I have ever claimed,
frequently preserved, and by asserting my right to it have most
offended my cotemporaries; an active, artful, ambitious race, who
detest liberty in others, nor desire it for themselves; provided
they sometimes have their will, or rather are permitted to control
the will of others; who would suffer constraint during the whole
term of their existence, act in a manner repugnant to their
inclinations, and omit nothing that is servile, to obtain command.
There wrong does not consist in excluding me as an useless member
of society, but-in proscribing me as a pernicious one: I have done
very little good, I confess, but no ill, that never having once
accorded with my inclination; and I question whether any man in the
world has really done less, than myself.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Seventh Walk</h2>

<p>HARDLY have I begun this collection of my copious reveries, yet
I am already sensible that I draw near the conclusion of it.
Another amusement succeeds, absorbs, and even deprives me of
opportunity to contemplate and give into my design. This
inclination has acquired an ardour which almost reaches to
extravagance, nor can I refrain from laughing when I reflect on it;
yet even that does not restrain me, for in my present situation, I
have but one rule for my conduct, which is, to follow my
inclination freely. I cannot change my fate; I have only innocent
inclinations; hereafter the opinions of mankind will be;
immaterial, and wisdom itself prescribes that I should please
myself with everything that remains within my reach, whether in
public or alone, having no rule but my fancy, no bounds except the
little strength I have remaining; behold me, then, confined to a
vegetable diet, and fully employed in botanical researches.</p>

<p>I was already advanced in-years, when I took the first
inclination for this study, while with the Doctor, of Invernois, in
Switzerland. I herbalized with sufficient success during my travels
to acquire a tolerable knowledge of the vegetable kingdom; but
having passed the age of sixty, finding my strength insufficient
for extensive botanical researches, and being likewise sufficiently
occupied with copying music to require no other employ, I deserted
my herbal, sold my books, and was content with inspecting those
common plants I found in my walks about Paris. During this
interval, the little I had learned almost entirely escaped my
memory, with more ease and expedition than it had been placed
there. Now that I am turned of sixty-five, deprived of the little
memory I once possessed, and strength to ramble about the country,
without books, without garden, and even without a common, herbal;
behold me once more suddenly seized with this folly, with more
ardour than I felt for it on the first attack, and seriously
undertaking to learn by heart the whole <i>Regnum Vegetabile</i> of
Murray, and to get acquainted with all the various plants on the
habitable globe.</p>

<p>Unable to purchase a fresh collection of botanical books, I have
set about transcribing those I borrow, and resolve to begin a
herbal more copious than my former one, since I design it shall
include all the productions of the sea and Alps, with every tree in
both the Indies. Mean time, I make sure of the pimpernel, the
chervil, borage, and groundsel, botanizing learnedly at the side of
my bird cage, and at every trifling plant I meet with, cry with
satisfaction, "this is one herb more, however."</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to justify the resolution I have taken of
giving into this propensity; though it is a very reasonable one, in
my opinion, since I am persuaded, that to give up myself to those
amusements which offer themselves, is the wisest thing I can do in
my present situation, and even a great virtue; being a means of
preventing any leaven of hatred and vengeance from taking root in
my heart; for to find any taste for pleasure in circumstances like
mine, gives proof of a disposition little subject to irascible
passions; but it is my method of being revenged on my persecutors,
for I cannot inflict a severer punishment than by being happy,
notwithstanding their endeavours to make me otherwise.</p>

<p>Yes, doubtless, Reason herself permits, nay even prescribes,
that I should give into every harmless inclination; but she does
not inform me why this amusement invites, or point out what
attractions I can find in a vain study, pursued without profit or
improvement, which recalls me to the fatigues of youth and the
exercises of a school-boy, While weighed down by age and
infirmities, and possessing neither activity or memory. This is a
whimsicality I wish to investigate, since I imagine it would throw
some new light on that knowledge of myself, to which I have
consecrated my remaining leisure.</p>

<p>I have sometimes studied profoundly, but seldom with pleasure,
almost always against inclination, and as it were by force.
Reveries recreate and amuse, but study fatigues and distresses me,
thought being ever a painful and unentertaining occupation.
Sometimes my reveries end in meditation, but more frequently my
meditations convert to reveries; and during these wanderings my
soul fleets lightly over the universe on the wings of imagination,
wrapped with ecstasies which surpass every other enjoyment.</p>

<p>While I could indulge in the full extent of these ideal
pleasures, every other occupation appeared Insipid; but when once
engaged in a literary career, by an impulse foreign to my
disposition, I felt the fatigue of mental labour, and the
importunity of an unhappy celebrity; while pleasing reveries grew
cold and languid, my thoughts turning to the melancholy of my
situation in spite of every effort to the contrary, and I could
seldom enjoy any of those charming ecstasies, which during fifty
years had supplied the want of same and fortune, rendering me in a
state of indolence, without any other expense than that of time,
the happiest of mortals.</p>

<p>Trees, shrubs, and plants, are the decoration and covering of
the earth. What is more melancholy than the sight of a naked barren
country, which presents the eye with nothing but stones, earth, and
sand? but enlivened by nature, and clothed in its wedding suit, in
the midst of fragrant flowers, springs of water, and the warbling
of various birds, the earth offers, in the concurrence and harmony
of the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms, a scene interesting
and full of charms, the only object in nature which can never weary
the eye or heart.</p>

<p>The more sensibility the soul of a contemplative man possesses,
the more it gives into the exact excited by this concord: a
pleasing and profound reverie takes possession of his senses, being
lost in the delicious intoxication and immensity of this charming
system, with which he feels himself so intimately connected.
Detached objects make no more impression on him, he only sees and
feels the whole, and some particular circumstance must contract and
circumscribe his ideas, before he is enabled to enter on a partial
observation of that universe, which his imagination is on the
stretch to compass.</p>

<p>This is what naturally happened to me, when my heart, contracted
by distress, concentrated every impulsive motion about itself, in
order to preserve those remains of heat which were almost
evaporated and extinguished by the melancholy into which it sung by
degrees. I wandered carelessly in the woods and over the mountains,
not daring to think for fear of increasing my sorrows; while
imagination, which, in me, recoils from painful objects, permitted
my senses to run into the light by pleasing impressions produced by
the surrounding scenes: my eyes wandered perpetually from object to
object, nor was it possible in so great a variety but some should,
have power to arrest and amuse them.</p>

<p>I conceived a fondness for this recreation of the fight, which
calms and amuses the unfortunate blunting the edge of their
sorrows. The nature of the objects which present themselves,
greatly aids this amusement, and renders it more seducing,
Odoriferous smells, brilliant colours, and the most elegant forms,
seem to dispute the right of fixing our attention. A love of
pleasure is alone sufficient to make us give into those delightful
sensations, and if this effect does not take place in all those who
contemplate these charms, it is owing, in some, to natural
insensibility, but generally proceeds from the mind being so much
occupied with other concerns, that it only steals time for the
consideration of those objects which immediately strike the
senses.</p>

<p>Another reason which contributes to withdraw the attention of
polite people from the vegetable kingdom, is that custom of
considering a collection of plants as so many drugs and medicines.
Theophrastus thought differently on the subject, and this
philosopher, who may be looked on as the only botanist of
antiquity, is not much known among us. But thanks to a certain
Dioscorides, a great compiler of recipes, and to his commentators,
physic has taken such possession of plants, transforming them into
simples, that those properties only are pointed out, which it is
impossible to discover; that is to say, the pretended virtues which
it pleases the generality of botanists to attribute them. It is not
conceived that the organization of vegetables can of itself merit
our attention. People who pass their lives in learnedly arranging
shells, ridicule botany as an useless study, unless accompanied, as
they express it, by its application; that is to say, when one does
not abandon the observation of Nature, which never lies, and is
silent on this system, to give entire credit to the authority of
men, who seldom speak truth, yet affirm a number of particulars
that we must-believe on their word, which is frequently founded on
some borrowed authority. Stop in an enamelled meadow, examine
successively the flowers that adorn it; those who observe you thus
employed, supposing you are of the healing fraternity, will
approach, and enquire what herbs are good to cure the scald in
children, the itch in men, or the glanders in horses.</p>

<p>This disgusting prejudice is partly destroyed in other
countries, particularly in England, thanks to Linnaeus, who has, in
some measure, rescued botany from the school of pharmacy, restoring
it to natural history and economical uses; but in France, where
this study has not become so general, they have remained so
ignorant in this particular, that a Parisian wit, being in the
environs of London, and viewing a garden which belonged to some
virtuoso, exclaimed, as if that was the greatest encomium that
could be bestowed on it, "What a charming garden for an
apothecary!" According to this account, Adam should have been the
first apothecary, or it is not easy to form an idea of a garden
better stocked with plants than that of Eden.</p>

<p>These medicinal Ideas, certainly are not calculated to render
the study of botany agreeable; they tarnish the enamel of the
meadows, cause the vivid dyes of the flowers to fade, and wither
the freshness of the groves, rendering their shades and verdure not
only insipid but disgusting. All those charming and beautiful
statures which continually present themselves, are nothing to those
who only wish to pound them in a mortar; and who would seek or
imagine garlands for smiling shepherdesses, among the ingredients
for a clister?</p>

<p>But an idea of pharmacy never damped my rural pleasures, nothing
being more distant from my thoughts, than diet-drink and plasters.
I have often thought, while considering the fields, vineyards,
woods, and their numerous progeny attentively, that the vegetable
kingdom was a plenteous magazine of food bestowed by nature on man
and animals; but it never struck me to seek for drugs and medicines
there, nor do I see anything in those various productions which
indicates such a destination, and certainly Nature would have
pointed out the use, had they been intended for this purpose, as
she has done respecting what is proper for food. I am sensible that
the pleasure I feel in wandering I through the groves would even be
embittered by an idea of human infirmities, and would utterly
vanish if once I began to consider fevers, the stone, gout, or
epilepsy. I do not mean, however, to dispute the great virtues
attributed to vegetables, and shall only add, that supposing these
virtues real, it is sheer malice in any person to continue ill,
since there is not a single malady incident to man, but may be
radically cured by twenty different kinds of herbs.</p>

<p>That turn of mind which is ever connected with personal
interest, making us seek everywhere for profit or relief, but would
incline us to look on all nature with indifference if we were in
health and affluence, never governed me. I feel myself, in that
particular, quite contrary to other men, since everything that
bears any reference to the consideration of my wants, saddens and
depraves my ideas; nor could I ever find any real charm in the
pleasures of the mind, but when they were entirely independent of
personal interest. Had I, then, ever so much confidence in physic,
and the practice was in itself ever so agreeable, I could never
apply to it, or experience in the study, those pleasures which,
flow from a pure and disinterested contemplation, since my soul
could not expand and enjoy the works of Nature, while I felt it
confined by the bonds of mortality.</p>

<p>Without ever having much faith in medicine, I have put great
confidence in physicians, whom I have esteemed and loved, having
trusted them with the absolute management of my bodily health.
Fifteen years experience has informed me, to my cost, what
conclusion I should draw; and returning again to the simple laws of
Nature, I have, through them, regained my former health: If the
physicians, physicians, therefore, had no other quarrel against me,
who can wonder at their animosity? I am a living proof of the
vanity of their art, and the inutility of their prescriptions.</p>

<p>No, nothing personal, nothing that is connected with interested
views, can truly employ my soul. I never meditate so delightfully
as when freed in the fullest sense from every regard to myself;
then I experience ecstasies, enjoyments inexpressible; it is then,
that rushing as it were into the great system of beings, I
assimilate with universal Nature. While I considered mankind as my
brethren, I formed plans of terrestrial happiness; and these
projects being relative to all, I could only be happy in public
felicity; the idea of private, detached advantage, never having
reached my heart till I saw mankind seek theirs in my misery: then,
if I would avoid hating, I found it was necessary to shun them;
taking refuge, therefore, with our common mother, I sought in her
arms to sustain myself against the attacks of her children; I
became a solitary, or according to them, an unsociable
misanthropist, because I thought the wildest retreat preferable to
the society of depraved mortals, who are only nourished with
treasons and malice.</p>

<p>Abstaining from thought, lest the remembrance of my misfortunes
should obtrude in spite of all my efforts to the contrary; obliged
to suppress the refrains of a cheerful, though now languishing
imagination, which so many sorrows might at length depress; reduced
to the necessity of endeavouring to forget mankind, who endeavour
to overwhelm me with scandal and indignity, lest indignation should
at length convert my thoughts into bitterness against them; I
cannot concentrate my whole existence within myself, since my
expansive soul seeks to extend its ideas and faculties to other
objects; nor can I rush blindfold into the vast ocean of nature,
because my weakened and relaxed intellects no longer find objects
within their reach sufficiently fixed and powerful to sustain them.
I have not strength to wade through the chaos of my former
ecstasies, my ideas are now scarce anything but sensations, and the
sphere of my understanding is not superior to the objects which
immediately surround me.</p>

<p>Shunning mankind and seeking solitude, fancying little, thinking
less, yet, notwithstanding, endowed with a lively temper, which
preserved me from a languishing and melancholy apathy, I began to
find employment, in what surrounded me, and by a very natural
instinct, gave the preference to the most agreeable objects.</p>

<p>The mineral kingdom has in it nothing amiable and attractive;
its riches, enclosed in the bosom of the earth, seem to be hidden
from the sight of man that they may not tempt his avarice, being
there as in reserve, to supply one day the place of those true
riches that are more within his reach, for which he loses the
inclination in proportion as he becomes corrupt; then must he call
industry, pain, and labour to the aid of his sorrows, he digs in
the bowels of the earth, searches to the centre at the risk of life
and the expense of health, for imaginary treasure, instead of the
real wealth, which was freely offered, while he knew how to employ
it: he shuns the sun, and hurries himself alive!&mdash;he does
well, being no longer worthy to enjoy the cheerful light of the
day. From thence, quarries, pits, forges, furnaces, with all the
apparatus of anvils, hammers, smoke, and fire, succeed to the
pleasing images of rural labour. Squalid features, unhappy wretches
who languish in the infectious vapour of the mines, sooty forges,
hideous Cyclops, are the objects and inhabitants which the mines
substitute in the bowels of the earth, for that of verdure,
flowers, the azure sky, amorous shepherds and robust labourers, who
live and are happy on its surface.</p>

<p>It is easy, I confess, to gather sand or stones, to fill our
pockets and cabinets with them, and on the strength of these
collections to assume the air of a naturalist; but those who attach
and bound their researches to this kind of collections, are, in
general, wealthy dunces, who seek no further than the pleasure of
arranging and making a show of them. To profit by the study of
minerals, it is necessary to be both a chemist and a physician, to
make painful and expensive experiments; working in laboratories,
spending much time and money among coals, crucibles, furnaces, and
alembics, in suffocating vapours and smoke; always at the risk of
life, and frequently at the expense of health. From all this
insipid and fatiguing labour, results, in general, more pride than
knowledge, for even the most indifferent chemist will imagine he
has penetrated into the great mysteries of Nature, because chance,
perhaps, has taught him a few combinations of that art.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom is more within our reach, and certainly
merits much better to be considered; but this study has likewise
its difficulties, embarrassments, disasters, and troubles,
particularly for a solitary, who has no one to make observations
for him, or to assist his labours. How should I observe, dissect,
study, and understand the birds of the air, fish in the waters,
quadrupeds fleeter than the wind, and stronger than man, who are
not more disposed to offer themselves for my examination, than I am
able to overtake or make them submit by force? I must then have
recourse to snails, worms, and flies; pass my life, and spend my
breath, in running after butterflies, impaling poor insects alive,
dissecting mice, when I could catch them, or the dead carcasses of
animals which I might find by chance.</p>

<p>The study of animals is nothing without anatomy; it is by that
we are taught to consider their genus, and to class and distinguish
their various species. In order to study their manners and
characters, aviaries, reservoirs, and menageries, would be
necessary; they must be constrained, by some contrivance, to
continue within reach of my observation; but I have not the means
to keep them in captivity, nor activity enough to follow them in
their speed while in a state of freedom; I must, therefore, study
them when dead, separate their bones, and turn at leisure their
palpitating entrails! What an assemblage does an anatomical
amphitheatre exhibit!&mdash;Stinking bodies, putrid and lived
flesh, blood, loathsome entrails, hideous skeletons, and
pestilential vapours!&mdash;It is not among such objects, I promise
you, that J. J. will seek amusement.</p>

<p>Beautiful flowers, enamelled meadows, refreshing shades, brooks,
groves, and verdure, come and purify my imagination, soiled by
these hideous objects. My soul, dead to all lively emotions, can,
henceforth, only be affected by sensible images; I have no longer
anything but sensations, and through those alone can feel pain or
pleasure here below. Attracted by the smiling objects which
surround me, I consider, contemplate, compare, and at length learn
to class them: behold me, then, on a sudden, as much a botanist as
is requisite for any person to be, who only wishes to study Nature,
that he may discover perpetual sources of delight. I do not seek
instruction, it is too late; besides, I have never found that
profound science contributed to the happiness of life; but I seek
to procure myself pleasing and innocent amusements which I may
enjoy without constraint, and which, meantime, beguiles my
misfortunes. I neither run into expense or trouble while wandering
carelessly from herb to herb, from plant to plant, examining and
comparing their various characters, and noting their affinity or
difference; in short, while I observe vegetable organization
follow, in a manner, the course and play of these living machines,
seek (sometimes successfully) their general laws, the reason and of
their different structures, I give myself up to the charms I feel,
in a grateful admiration of that Power, who bestows on me the
enjoyment of so many wonders.</p>

<p>Plants appear to have been sown upon the earth in the same
profusion that stars are planted in the firmament, and equally
invite man, by the attractions of pleasure and curiosity, to the
study of Nature; but the stars are placed far from us, and need
preliminary studies, instruments, machines, immense ladders (if I
may use the expression) to place us where we may understand them.
Plants are naturally within our reach, they spring up under our
feet, and even in our hands: if the minuteness of their constituent
parts are sometimes imperceptible to the naked eye, the instruments
necessary to discover them are more easily obtained and applied,
than those requisite in the study of astronomy. Botanical objects
are most proper to an indolent solitary, a needle and magnifying
glass being all the apparatus necessary to consider them; he
wanders freely from one object to another, viewing each flower with
pleasing curiosity; and when he begins to understand the structure
and use of their various parts, enjoys a satisfaction, purchased
without care or labour, yet as pure and lively as if obtained with
the utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>There exists in this idle occupation, a charm that is not to be
experienced except in the full calm of the passions, which alone
suffices to render life pleasing and happy, but the moment a motive
of interest or vanity mingles with it, whether you seek to obtain a
place, or write a book; if you study in order to instruct, and
herbalize only to become author or professor, all its attractive
charms vanish, and plants, being no longer considered but as
instruments of our passions, no more real pleasure can result from
the study of them. Our end, then, is not to gain knowledge, but to
make others sensible of our acquirements; and while in the wood, or
on the hills, considering ourselves as on the theatre of the world,
we are employed with, the idea of being admired. Others contract
botany within the narrow bounds of the garden or cabinet, and
instead of observing vegetables in their natural state, are only
busied with systems and rules, furnishing eternal subjects of
dispute, which are not calculated to make one single plant better
understood, and consequently can throw no light on the natural
history of the vegetable kingdom. From thence arises that hatred,
and those jealousies, which an emulation for same excites among
botanical authors more than those of any other class: thus, taking
this pleasing study from its native seat, they have transplanted it
into cities and academies, where it is sure to degenerate, like
exotic plants in the gardens of the curious.</p>

<p>Very different dispositions have concurred to render this study
a kind of passion to me, which occupies the void of those I no
longer feel. I climb the rocks and mountains, descend into the
valleys and woods, to withdraw myself as much as possible from the
remembrance of man, and the pursuits of the wicked. It appears to
me, that when shaded by a forest I am forgotten, free and peaceful
as though I had no longer any enemies, or that the leaves shield me
as much from their attempts, as they put them from my remembrance;
supposing, in my folly, that as I no longer think of them, they no
longer think of me; and I find so great a pleasure in this
illusion, that I should give into it entirely, did not my
situation, weakness, and wants, forbid me.</p>

<p>The more profound the solitude in which I now live, the more do
I feel that some objects are necessary to fill up the void, and
those which imagination denies, or that my memory repulses, are
supplied by those spontaneous productions, which the earth, in her
uncultivated states offers to my view in every direction, The
pleasure of seeking in the desert for new plants, conceals the pain
of flying from my persecutors, and when I light on any spot where I
can discover no trace of human footsteps, I breathe at ease, as in
an asylum where their hatred cannot overtake me.</p>

<p>I shall never, during my whole life, lose the recollection of a
herbalizing I one day made on the side of the Robaila, a mountain
belonging to the <i>Justicier Clere</i>. I was alone, exploring the
hollows and chasms of this mountain, from wood to wood, from rock
to rock, when, at length, I discovered a retreat so truly
concealed, that never in my life did I behold so wild and romantic
a scene. Black firs were mingled with prodigious beech trees,
several of which had fallen with age, and crossing each other, shut
up this retreat as with an impenetrable barrier. Through some
opening of this dreary enclosure, the eye was presented with craggy
peaked rocks and horrible precipices, which I dared not cast a look
at, without laying down with my face to the ground. The horned owl,
the raven, and the spray, screamed from the clefts of this
mountain, while some small birds, scarce but familiar, tempered the
horror of the solitude. There I found the notched
<i>heptaphyllos</i>, the <i>cicclamen</i>, the <i>nidus avis</i>,
the greater <i>laserpitium</i>, and some other plants, which
delighted and amused me for some time; but insensibly governed by
the forcible impression made on me by so many striking objects, I
forgot my botany, and seating myself on a bed of <i>lycopodium</i>
and moss, began to contemplate at my ease, supposing I was in a
retreat unknown to the whole world, and where my persecutors could
never find me. A sentiment of pride was mingled with this reverie;
I compared myself to those great voyagers who discover desert
islands, and said, with self-complacency, "doubtless, I am the
first mortal whoever penetrated this retreat," regarding myself as
another Columbus. While I was indulging this idea, I heard, at some
small distance, a kind of clattering noise, which seemed familiar
to me; I listen&mdash;the noise is repeated and increased.
Surprised, and curious, I rose hastily, and crept through the
bushes, on that side from which the found proceeded; when, in a
thicket, not twenty paces distant from that retreat which I thought
no one but myself had ever discovered, I perceived&mdash;a stocking
manufactory!</p>

<p>I cannot express the confused and contradictory agitation I felt
in my heart on this discovery. My first sensation was an
involuntary joy at again finding myself among mortals, when I had
supposed myself totally alone; but this emotion, more rapid than
lightening, soon gave place to a melancholy and more lasting
reflection, which was, that I could not possibly hide myself, even
among the cliffs of the Alps, from the cruel search of men, who
would delight to torment me; for I was well convinced, there was
not, perhaps, two people in this manufactory, but what were
initiated into the combination of which that sorry preacher
Montmollin was the chief, who drew his hearers from a much greater
distance. I hastened to drive away this disagreeable idea, and
concluded this adventure at laughing at my ridiculous vanity, and
the whimsical manner in which it had been punished.</p>

<p>But who would have expected to find a manufactory on the edge of
a precipice? Indeed, there is no spot in the world which exhibits
such a mixture of uncultivated nature and human industry, as
Switzerland; the whole country, to use the expression, is nothing
but one great city, whose streets, longer and wider than those of
St. Antoine, are adorned by forests, or separated by mountains, and
whose straggling lonely dwellings, only communicate by a kind of
English gardens. While on this subject, I recollect another
botanical excursion that Du Peyron, Descharney, Colonel Pury, the
Justicier Clerc and myself, had taken some time before on the
mountain of Chasseron, from whose summit seven lakes may be
perceived. We were informed there was but one house on this
mountain, and certainly we should never have divined the profession
of its inhabitant, if our informer had not added, he was a
bookseller, who even gained a very comfortable subsistence in this
country*. A single trait of this kind throws a greater light on
Switzerland than all the descriptions of travellers.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It was doubtless the resemblance of names
which caused M. Rousseau to apply the anecdote of this bookseller
to Chasseron instead of Chasseral, another very high mountain on
the frontiers of the principality of Neuschatel. Fr. Editor.]</p>

<p>I shall relate one more of the same kind, which tends to
characterize a very different people. During my residence at
Grenoble, I made many little botanical excursions out of the city
with the Sieur Bovier, an attorney of that country; not that he
loved or understood botany, but having undertaken to be my
companion, he scarcely quitted me a moment. One day, as we were
walking by the side of the Isere, in a spot covered with thorny
willows, I saw some ripe fruit on these shrubs, which I had the
curiosity to taste, and finding an agreeable acidity, began eating
it by way of refreshment. The Sieur Bovier was by my side, but
neither spoke to me, nor followed my example; when one of his
friends coming up, and seeing me gather these berries,
exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Sir! what are you doing? Do you not know that fruit is
poisonous?"</p>

<p>"This fruit poisonous!" replied I with surprise.</p>

<p>"Without doubt," answered he, "and everyone is so well aware of
it, that not a single person in the country will taste it."</p>

<p>I looked at the Sieur Bovier, and said,</p>

<p>"Why did not you inform me of this?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Sir," replied he, respectfully, "I did not dare to take
that liberty."</p>

<p>I laughed, heartily at his provincial humility, but discontinued
my collation, though I was then persuaded, as I am yet, that every
natural production which is agreeable to the palate cannot be
pernicious, unless taken to excess; however, I confess I took some
care of myself for the remainder of the day; but felt no ill effect
from this fruit, except a little inquietude; I supped well, slept
better, and rose the next morning in perfect health, after having
allowed the day before fifteen or twenty berries of this terrible
hippophae, of which a very small dose certainly poisons, as
everyone assured me the day following at Grenoble. This adventure
appeared so ridiculous, that I never recollect it without laughing
at the singular discretion of the lawyer Bovier.</p>

<p>My botanical excursions, the local impressions of various
objects which have struck me in them, the ideas they gave rise to,
and the incidents that occurred, were mingled together, and have
left impressions which are renewed by the sight of those plants I
then used to gather. I shall no more behold the beautiful
landscapes, forests, lakes, groves, rocks, and mountains, whose
aspect has ever touched my heart; but though I can no longer stray
through those happy regions, I have only to look over my
collection, and I am immediately transported thither, the very
fragments of plants which I gathered at that time, being sufficient
to, make me recollect those magnificent spectacles. My collection
is, therefore, to me, a journal of botanical excursions, which
brings them back to my memory with new charms, and, producing the
effect of a camera, delineates them as present to my sight.</p>

<p>It is this concatenation of ideas which attaches me to botany,
by recalling to my recollection all those images that are most
delightful; the meadows, waters, woods, and solitudes, but more
particularly the peace and repose enjoyed among them, are by this
means retraced incessantly on my memory. This makes me forget the
persecutions of mankind, the hatred, disdain, wrongs, and all the
injuries with which they have repaid my tender and sincere
attachment to them. This transports me into peaceful habitations,
among innocent and worthy people, like those I was formerly
accustomed to. It recalls my youth and harmless pleasures, making
me again enjoy them; and often renders me happy, though plunged by
Fate into the most melancholy, situation that ever mortal
experienced.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Eighth Walk</h2>

<p>Meditating on the dispositions of my soul, in every situation of
life which I have passed through, I am extremely surprised at the
disproportion I perceive between the different combinations of my
destiny, and the habitual conceptions of good and evil with which
they have affected me. The several intervals of my short-lived
prosperity have scarcely left one permanent agreeable remembrance
of the manner in which I enjoyed, them; while, on the contrary,
during the greatest miseries of my life, I constantly experienced
the most tender sentiments, which, though affecting, were
delicious; these, shedding a salutary balm on the sorrows of my
wounded heart, seemed to convert grief into enjoyment, and the
amiable remembrance of those pleasing sensations, frequently
returns, unaccompanied by those sorrows that formerly attended
them. It appears to me that I have given more into the pleasure of
my existence, and more truly lived, when the peculiarity of my fate
had concentrated all my feelings, as it were, about my own heart,
than when they evaporated outwardly, in pursuit of those objects
which merit so little in themselves, yet constitute the whole
felicity of those we think most happy.</p>

<p>When all was right around me, when I was content with
everything, and satisfied with the sphere I was to occupy, I filled
it with my affections, while my expansive soul, extending itself to
other objects, was perpetually attracted by a thousand different
inclinations, and by amiable attachments, which continually
employed my heart: in these situations I forgot myself in some
measure, thinking principally on what was foreign to me, and
experiencing in the continual agitation of my feelings, all the
vicissitude of earthly things. This exquisite sensibility left me
neither inward peace, nor outward repose; happy in appearance only,
I had not a single sentiment that could have borne the proof of
reflection, or with which I could truly have been content. Never
was I perfectly satisfied either with others or myself; the tumult
of the world made me giddy, solitude wearied me, I perpetually
wished for a change of situation, and met with happiness in none.
Meantime, I was entertained well, and caressed everywhere; I had
not a single enemy, none who bore me ill-will, none that were
envious, everyone sought to oblige me, and I frequently had it in
my power to oblige others. Without wealth, employment, or
flatterers; without any display or reputation of particular
talents, I enjoyed every advantage that could have resulted from
them all, and saw no one in a situation which I thought preferable
to my own. What then was wanting to make me happy? I cannot answer
this; but I am fully sensible I was not so. What additional
misfortune is wanting at this time to make me the most miserable of
mankind? Nothing that human malice can add; yet in this deplorable
situation, I would not change my being and destiny with the most
fortunate among my persecutors; but would rather be myself in the
midst of these misfortunes, than any of those who figure in all the
glare of prosperity. Cut off from every connection, my soul must
nourish itself on its own substance; but she is not exhausted,
though I ruminate on a void, if I may be allowed the expression, my
clouded imagination and faded ideas no longer furnishing sufficient
aliment to my heart, while my soul dimmed and obstructed by the
weakness of its bodily organs, sinks daily under the weight of
them, having no longer strength sufficient to free itself, and dart
as heretofore from its aged and feeble covering.</p>

<p>This entering into ourselves, is what we are naturally forced to
by adversity, and this, perhaps, renders it so insupportable to the
generality of mankind: for my part (who have only weaknesses to
reproach myself with) I easily find consolation, for never did
premeditated evil approach my heart: Yet, unless I was fortified by
stupidity, how could I contemplate my situation, though but for a
single moment, without seeing it in all its horrors, and sinking
under the weight of grief and despair? Far from that, though the
most feeling of beings, I consider it unmoved, and without struggle
or effort nay almost with indifference, see myself in a state which
no other man, perhaps, could support the idea of without the utmost
perturbation.</p>

<p>How did I acquire this insensibility? For I was very far from
this peaceful disposition when I first opened my eyes on that plot
which had been so long ensnaring me in secret. I was instantly
overwhelmed with this new discovery: infamy and treason fell on me
unawares, for what honest soul could be prepared for such attacks,
since they must be merited to be foreseen? When I found myself
entangled in the snares they spread for me, indignation, fury, and
delirium took possession of my heart; I knew not how to act, my
head was giddy; while in the fearful obscurity into which they had
plunged me, I could discover no light to direct, no support or
hold, whose help I might rely on, to resist the despair which
threatened to overwhelm me.</p>

<p>How could I hope for happiness or peace in this dreadful
situation? yet, though I still continue in it, and am even plunged
deeper than ever into this fearful abyss, I have found tranquillity
and ease, am happy and cheerful, laughing sometimes at the
perpetual torments which my persecutors are giving themselves,
while I am content, and so employed with flowers, stamina, and
childish amusements, that I do not even think of them.</p>

<p>But how was this change produced? Naturally, insensibly, and
without effort. The first surprise indeed was dreadful. I who felt
myself worthy of love and esteem; I who thought myself honoured and
respected, as I deserved to be, found myself on a sudden
transformed into the most fearful monster, such a one, indeed, as
never existed. I saw a whole generation precipitate itself into
this unreasonable opinion, without explanation, doubt, or shame,
and even without my being able to learn the cause of this strange
revolution. At first, I struggled violently, and did but entangle
myself the more, I wished to force my persecutors to some
explanation; but they took care not to satisfy me in this
particular. After having a long time tormented myself to no
purpose, it was necessary to take breath; meantime, I still hoped,
and said to myself, "so stupid a blindness, so absurd a prejudice,
cannot long influence the whole human race; there are men of sense
who will not share this delirium there are upright minds who detest
traitors and imposture, I will seek them; at length, surely, I
shall find a man, and if I meet with one, the rest will be
confounded." I sought in vain, I found none; the combination was
universal, without exception or difference, and I am reduced to a
certainty of concluding my days in this horrid proscription,
without ever being able to penetrate the mystery.</p>

<p>It is in this deplorable situation, after long and dreadful
agonies, that, instead of despair, which seemed my inevitable
portion forever, I once more found serenity, tranquillity, peace,
and even happiness; since each day of my life I recall the
occupations of the preceding one with pleasure, and desire no
variation for tomorrow.</p>

<p>From whence proceeds this difference? From one single
circumstance, which is, that I have learned to bear the yoke of
necessity without murmuring. Formerly, I was attached to a thousand
things, all which connections have been rent asunder successively,
and I am reduced to depend on myself, and adopt my own plan for
happiness. Now that I am pressed on all sides, I maintain my
equilibrium, because, no longer attached to anything, I depend on
myself alone.</p>

<p>When I struggled with so much ardour against public opinion, I
still bore its yoke, though I did not perceive it; for while I
entertained an advantageous idea of mankind, or at least of a part
of them, the opinions they might form could not be indifferent to
me. I had frequently found that the judgment of the public was very
equitable; but did not then perceive that this equity was the
effect of chance, or that the rules on which their opinions are
founded were drawn from their passions or prejudices, and that even
when they judge uprightly, it frequently springs from a bad
principle; since they may pretend to honour the merit of another,
not from a love of justice, but to give themselves an air of
impartiality, that they may caluminate the same man, on other
subjects, more securely. But when, after long and vain experiments,
I found everyone, without exception, remained in the most cruel and
absurd system that infernal malice ever invented; when I saw that,
in respect to me, reason was banished from all heads, and equity
from all hearts; when I found a frantic generation given up without
reserve to the blind furore of its guides, against an unfortunate
being who never did, wished, or attempted harm against anyone, it
was time to lay aside my lantern, and exclaim "There are none such
as I sought for!"</p>

<p>From that time I began to consider myself as alone upon the
earth, and that my contemporaries were, in regard to me, but
mechanical beings, who acted by mere impulsion, and whose actions
could only be calculated by the laws of motion. Whatever intention,
whatever passions I might suppose in their souls, these would never
explain their conduct on my account, in any manner that I could
comprehend. Their interior dispositions, therefore, cease to be of
any consequence to me; since I no longer consider them in any other
light than machines moving in various directions, but destitute, in
regard to me, of all good or moral reflection.</p>

<p>In all the evils that befall us, we look more to the intention
than the effect. A tile falling from a house may wound us more, but
does not vex us half so much as a stone thrown from an
ill-designing hand; the blow, indeed, may fail, but the intention
never misses its mark. Corporeal sufferings are least felt amid the
strokes of adverse fortune; and when the unhappy know not on whom
to charge their sufferings, they attribute them to Destiny, whom
they personify on this occasion, and supply with eyes and
understanding, that he may be in a capacity to torment them
wilfully. Thus it is with the gamester, who, enraged with his
losses, is in a fury, though he knows not with whom; he, therefore,
imagines a fate maliciously tormenting him, and thus, giving food
to his passion, becomes enraged and exasperated against an enemy
himself has created; but a wise man, who only views the misfortunes
which happen to him as the strokes of blind Necessity, has not
these unreasonable agitations: he complains in his affliction, but
without heat or passion, he only feels the actual pain of those
evils which assail him; the strokes he receives may slightly wound
his person, but not one of them can reach his heart, or in the
least remove the early impression of a religious and virtuous
education.</p>

<p>It requires much labour to arrive thus far, but this is not all;
if we stop there, we only cut off the evil, but leave the root
behind, and this root is not implanted in others, but in our own
bosoms, from whence we must endeavour to eradicate it. This I was
perfectly sensible of when my recollection returned, my reason
pointing out nothing but absurdity in all the explications I had
given to my sufferings, been soon convinced that the causes,
instruments, and means of all this, were unfathomable,
inexplicable, and ought to be regarded with indifference; in short,
that I ought to consider my whole destiny as so many acts of pure
fatality, in which neither plan, intention, nor moral cause
existed; that I should submit without murmuring or uneasiness,
since both were utterly unavailing; that all I had now to do on
earth, was to look on myself as a being merely passive, and that I
should not waste that strength in useless struggles against my
fate, which was given me in order to support it. This is what I
thought both my reason and heart acquiesced in; yet I felt the
latter sometimes complain. From whence arose this murmur?&mdash;I
sought, and found the cause: it arose from self-pride, which having
been irritated with mankind, rose up also against the conviction of
reason.</p>

<p>This discovery was not so readily made as some may imagine; for
an innocent, persecuted man, is apt to mistake affection to his own
person for a pure love of justice; but when once the true source is
discovered, it may easily be stopped, or at least turned into its
proper channel. Self-esteem is the strongest incentive to elevated
souls: self-pride, fertile in illusions, often disguises itself,
and is mistaken for the former; but when once the fraud is
discovered, the danger ceases; for though it is difficult to
eradicate it entirely, it may easily be kept in subjection.</p>

<p>I was never much inclined to self pride, but this factitious
passion increased with me in the world, particularly after I
commenced author: I had less of it, perhaps, than many others, but
yet I had a prodigious quantity. The terrible lessons I received,
presently confined it within just bounds. This reformation began by
a simple dislike of injustice, and concluded by a thorough disdain
of it: then, relying on the integrity of my own heart, and striking
off those exterior relations which render self importunate, by
renouncing all comparisons and preferences, this passion was
reduced again to self-esteem, resumed its natural course, and has
delivered me from the yoke of opinion.</p>

<p>From this time, my soul regained its peace, and almost its
felicity; for in whatever situation we may find ourselves, it is
through the mind only that we can be completely miserable; when
that is composed, and we listen to the voice of Reason, she
consoles us for all those woes which it was not in our power to
avoid, and even annihilates them, when they do not immediately act
upon us, since we are certain to escape their sharpest stings, the
instant they cease to employ our attention; the most distressing
situations being nothing to those who do not think of them.
Offences, revenge, over-reaching, outrages, or injustice, lose
their force with those who, in the evils they experience, see only
the actual injury, without considering the intention, and whose
self-esteem does not depend on that opinion it pleases others to
bestow on their actions. In whatever light men think fit to view
me, they cannot change my being, and, in spite of their power or
dark intrigues, I shall continue, let them do what they please, to
remain precisely what I am. It is certain that their behaviour, in
respect to me, influences my real situation; the barrier they have
placed between themselves and me, cutting off all resource,
subsistence, or relief, which my old age and wants require, renders
even money useless, since it cannot procure me those services which
are necessary. There is neither commerce, reciprocal trust, or
correspondence between me and mankind; alone in the midst of them,
I have no resource but myself, and that is a very weak one at my
age, especially in the state to which I am reduced. These sorrows
are undoubtedly great; but they have lost their force with me,
since I have learned to bear them without anger. The situations in
which real want is felt, are not very numerous; foresight and
imagination multiply them, and it is this continuity of sensation,
which causes our inquietude and unhappiness. For me, it is in vain
that I am sensible I shall suffer tomorrow, it suffices to render
me content, that I do not suffer today. I am not affected with the
evils I foresee, but only with those I feel, which reduces my
portion of suffering to very little. Alone, sick, and abandoned in
my bed, I might die with want, cold, and hunger, without any person
concerning himself about it; and, provided I remain unmoved, and as
little affected as the rest, of what consequence is all this? But
is it nothing, particularly at my age, to view life and death,
sickness and health, riches and poverty, glory and defamation, with
equal indifference? Other old men are uneasy about everything,
while I am regardless of all; nor is this indifference the effect
of my own wisdom, but of the malice of my enemies, and is a
compensation for the ills they have dealt me; for, by rendering me
insensible to the strokes of adverse fortune, they have done me
more service than if they had left me free from its attacks; since
never having experienced adversity, I should continually have
dreaded its approach, but now that it is vanquished, I can fear it
no more.</p>

<p>This state of mind restores me, in the midst of all the crosses
of life, to the enjoyment of my natural disposition, almost as
completely as if I lived in the highest prosperity, except during
those short intervals, when I am recalled by the presence of some
particular object to the most melancholy inquietudes. At other
times, given up to the guidance of my inclinations, of the
affections which most attract me, my heart yet nourishes itself by
the indulgence of those sentiments for which it was formed, and I
enjoy and partake of them, with the imaginary beings my fancy
creates, as though all these things really existed: nay, they do
exist for me who create them, and I neither fear they should betray
or abandon me; they will exist while Memory holds her seat, or
Reason maintains her empire; they will endure while my miseries
remain, and suffice to make me forget them.</p>

<p>Everything concurs to bring me back to that peaceful and happy
state for which Nature designed me. I pasted three-fourths of my
time, either employed with instructive and even agreeable objects,
to which I give up my mind and senses with pleasure, or with those
ideal beings my fancy forms according to my heart; a commerce with
whom, yet keeps its feelings and affections alive: if not thus
employed alone, and content with myself, I already experience that
happiness which I am conscious is due to me. In all this, self-love
does the whole work, self-pride is of no account. It is not thus in
those melancholy moments which I yet sometimes pass among men, the
dupe of their treacherous caresses, their false deceitful
compliments, and honied malignity: however I endeavour to suppress
it, self pride then prevails, and the hatred and animosity I
perceive in their hearts, through every weak concealment, tears
mine with keenest sorrow; while the idea of being taken for so
gross a dupe, adds to my grief a childish vexation, the fruit of
this foolish pride, which, though I feel the ridiculousness of, I
cannot conquer. The efforts I have made to bear these insulting and
satirical looks unmoved, are amazing: an hundred times have I
passed in the public walks, in order to accustom myself to these
painful trials; but so far from having been able to blunt my
feelings, I could never advance a single step towards it, and all
my vain efforts have left me as susceptible of trouble and vexation
as ever.</p>

<p>Governed by the senses, notwithstanding all my endeavours, I
have never been able to resist their impressions, and while the
object continues to act upon them, my heart cannot cease to be
affected; but these fugitive afflictions last no longer than the
sensation which gives rise to them. The presence of a malicious
person affects me violently; but the instant he disappears, the
impression ceases; he is immediately banished from my memory, and
if I am ever so well assured he is busying himself about me, I
cannot trouble myself about him. The evil which I do not actually
feel, does not in the least affect me; and the persecutor I do not
see, can give me no concern. I am sensible of the advantage this
disposition gives to those who rule my destiny; but let them
dispose of it at their pleasure, I had rather they should torment
me without resistance, than that I should be forced to think of
them, in order to avoid the efforts of their malice.</p>

<p>It is my senses, acting thus immediately on my heart, that
occasion the sole torment of my life: In retreats, where I see no
one, I think no more of my misfortunes, no longer feel them, no
longer suffer, but am happy and content, without obstacle or
interruption. At other times, I rarely escape some sensible attack,
and frequently when I least expect it: a gesture or malicious look
that I observe, an envenomed word that I hear, or an adversary I
chance to meet with, suffices to overthrow me. All I can do in
these cases is to forget and fly from these affronts as fast as
possible; my pain vanishes with the subject that caused it, and
calmness resumes it place the moment I am alone, or if anything
then disturbs my peace, it is a fear of meeting in my way some new
object of inquietude. This is my principal concern; but this is
sufficient to embitter my happiness: I lodge in the midst of Paris;
in going from my house, I sigh for the country and solitude; but I
have a considerable way to go before I can breathe at ease, and in
this space I encounter a thousand objects which wound my heart, and
half the day passes in agonies, before I can find the wished
asylum, happy if at length I am permitted to reach it. The moment I
escape the sight of injurious man is delicious, and when I find
myself under the trees, surrounded by verdure, I think myself in a
terrestrial Paradise, enjoying as lively an interval of pleasure as
the happiest of mortals can experience.</p>

<p>I perfectly remember that during my short-lived prosperity, the
very same solitary walks, now so delightful to me, were insipid and
wearisome. When I happened to be at anyone's house in the country,
the necessity of using exercise, and breathing a freer air, made me
frequently go out alone; then, escaping like a thief, I wandered in
the park, or about the country; but far from finding the pleasing
calm I experience at present, I carried with me the vain agitation
that employed me in the house, the remembrance of the company I
quitted pursued me even to my solitude, while the vapours of
self-pride, seemed to tarnish the freshness of the groves, and
disturb the quiet of my retreat. It was in vain that I fled to the
recesses of the woods, an importunate crowd followed me everywhere
in idea, and all nature faded in my sight; nor was it till since I
have been detached from social passions, and their melancholy
train, that I have found her again in all her charms.</p>

<p>Convinced of the impossibility of restraining these powerful
involuntary emotions, I have ceased to attempt it. At every fresh
attack, my blood ferments, while rage and indignation immediately
take possession of me; I therefore give up to Nature this first
explosion, which all my strength could not overcome. I only
endeavour to prevent the effects they might produce, if left to
themselves; meantime, my eyes sparkle, my features are agitated, I
feel an universal trembling and suffocating palpitation; all these
proceed from physical causes, and depend on constitution, nor can
any effort of reason conquer them; but after having given way to
this first transport, we may re-obtain the government of ourselves,
and recover our senses by degrees. I attempted this a long time
without success; but at length more happily, when ceasing to
exhaust my strength in vain resistance, I waited the moment that
reason might govern, to vanquish my weakness, for she never speaks
but when she may be heard. Alas! what do I say? until reason might
govern! I should do wrong to bestow on her the honour of this
triumph, in which she has no share; all this is the effect of a
versatile disposition, which an impetuous wind sometimes agitates,
but which resumes it native calmness the moment this hurricane
ceases to blow: it is my natural ardour which catches the momentary
agitation, it is my natural indolence which as instantaneously
appeases me. I give into every present impulse, each shock
occasions a violent emotion; but the cause vanishing, the effect
ceases; nothing communicated is lasting, and all the events of
fortune, all-the machinations of man, can have but little hold on a
being thus formed.</p>

<p>To afflict me with lasting pain, it would be necessary to renew
the impression every moment, for intervals, however short, are
sufficient to restore me to myself. I am what it pleases men to
make me, while they continue to work on my senses; but in the first
instant of relaxation, I am again what Nature designed me. To this
point, therefore, notwithstanding all endeavours to the contrary, I
most constantly return; and in this situation, even in despite of
fate itself, enjoy that happiness for which I feel myself
peculiarly formed. I have described this state in one of my former
reveries, which suits me so well, that I wish for nothing during
its continuance, and fear nothing but to see it disturbed. I am not
in any manner affected with the evils mankind have heaped on me,
the fear of what they may yet do, is alone capable of giving me the
smallest agitation; but convinced they have no new contrivance by
which they can permanently affect me, I laugh at their inventions,
and enjoy myself in spite of their malignity.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch" id="ch"></a>Ninth Walk</h2>

<p>HAPPINESS is a permanent condition, which does not seem designed
for man, while here below. Everything on earth is in a state of
continual fluctuation, which will not permit anything to maintain a
constant form. Every object with which we are surrounded, changes;
we are equally mutable, nor can any man be certain he shall love
tomorrow what he loves today: thus all our plans for happiness in
this life, are purely chimerical. Let us, then, prize contentment
whenever it offers; let us beware how we banish it by our own
folly, neither let us embarrass ourselves with forming projects to
ensure its continuance, since such projects are certain follies; I
have seen few men, perhaps none, in a state of happiness; but I
have seen many content, and of all the objects that ever struck me,
it is that which conveys the greatest satisfaction to my heart, and
I believe this is a natural consequence of the great power of
involuntary sensation on my internal feelings.</p>

<p>Happiness has no particular outward sign to discover itself by;
we must be able to view the heart before we can be certain who are
truly happy; but contentment is to be read in the eyes, the
conversation, the accent, the manner, and seems to communicate
itself to him that perceives it. Can there be a greater pleasure
than to see a whole people given to the enjoyment of a holiday,
every heart expanding with the exhilarating rays of pleasure, which
pass joyfully but rapidly amid the clouds of life?</p>

<p>Three days ago, M. P. came with extraordinary haste to show me a
eulogy on Madame Geoffrin by M. d'Alembert. The reading was
preceded by repeated bursts of laughter on the ridiculous phrases
this piece contained, and the silly play on words with which he
said it abounded. Still continuing to laugh, he began reading,
while I listened with a seriousness, which (on observing that I did
not imitate him) calmed his levity. The longest and most laboured
article of this piece turned on the pleasure Madame Geoffrin took
in seeing children, and exciting their harmless prattle. The author
drew from this, and with reason, the proof of an amiable
disposition; though he did not stop here, but directly accused
these who had not the same taste, with evil dispositions, and
wickedness. He maintained this so far, as to assert, that if all
the malefactors who are taken up to the gallows or the wheel, were
interrogated on that subject, they would universally agree in
confessing, they had never loved children. These assertions
appeared very singular in the situation they were placed-in; for
supposing all this true, was it necessary to foil the praise due to
an estimable woman, with disgusting images of executions and
malefactors? I easily understood the true motive of this paltry
affectation, and when M. P. had finished reading this piece, after
praising what I thought worthy, I added, that the author had less
friendship than hatred in his heart when he wrote it.&mdash;The
next day, the weather being fine, though cold, I took a walk as for
as the military school, expecting to meet with some moss in full
bloom. During my walk, I reflected on the visit of the preceding
evening, and on the work of M. D. which I could not believe the
far-fetched episode I have before remarked, could be placed there
without design. The affectation of bringing this trifle to me, from
whom they usually conceal everything, was sufficiently expressive
of their meaning. I had sent my children to the Asylum; this was
sufficient to make me pass for an unnatural father; from thence,
extending and exaggerating the idea, they had deduced, as a
necessary consequence, that I hated children. In following the
gradations of this chain of thought, I admired with what art human
industry may change white to black: for I do not believe that ever
man loved better to see these little puppets play together, than
myself, and frequently in the streets or public walks, I stop to
observe their little tricks and sports, with a degree of interest
which I never observed in any other person. The very day I was
visited by M. P. and not an hour before his arrival, I had received
one from the two younger children of Soussoi, my landlord, the
eldest of whom might be about seven years old. They had embraced me
so freely, and I had repaid their caresses with such tenderness,
that notwithstanding the disparity of years, they seemed sincerely
satisfied with me, while I was transported with pleasure to find
that my aged figure had not disgusted them: Even the youngest came
to me so willingly, that, more childish than they were, I felt
myself most attached to him, and saw his departure with as much
concern as if he had belonged to me.</p>

<p>I know that the reproach of have sent my children to the Asylum,
has readily degenerated, with the assistance of very little
alteration, into that of being an unnatural father, and hating
children; though, it is certain that the fear of exposing them to a
destiny a thousand times worse, and almost inevitable by any other
means, obliged me to take that step. Had I been less concerned for
what might become of them, not being in a situation to bring these
children up myself, I should have left them to their mother, who
would have spoiled them, or to her family, who would have converted
them into monsters&mdash;I even yet tremble to think of
it!&mdash;What Mahomet made of Saide, is nothing to what would have
been made of them in respect to me, and I am certain, from the
snares which were afterwards spread for me on that account, that
the project was formed. It is true, I was very far, at that time,
from suspecting these atrocious snares, but was then fully
convinced that the education least dangerous to them would be that
of the Asylum, and accordingly I placed them there. I should do so
again, and with less concern, was I in the same circumstances;
though I am convinced no father can feel more tenderness for his
children than I should have felt for mine, and habit in some degree
assisted Nature.</p>

<p>If I have made any progress in the knowledge of the human heart,
it is to the pleasure I have experienced in seeing and observing
children, that I owe it. This same pleasure, in my youth was rather
an obstacle, for I joined so gaily and heartily in their play, that
I never thought of studying their dispositions; but as I grew old,
and found they were alarmed at the sight of my feeble frame, I
abstained from teasing them, rather wishing to deprive myself of a
pleasure, than to disturb their joy; I therefore satisfied myself
with observing their little tricks and sports, and found a
recompense for the sacrifice I made of my satisfaction, by the
lights these observations threw on the study of the first and
genuine dispositions of Nature, of which our learned men understand
nothing. I have given sufficient proof in my writings, of having
too carefully and minutely attended to this study, not to have done
it with pleasure; for it must certainly appear the most incredible
circumstance in the world, that Eloisa and Emilius should have been
written by a man who did not love children.</p>

<p>I never possessed either presence of mind or facility of speech,
and since my misfortunes, both my tongue and head are still more
embarrassed; the idea and expression equally escape me, and nothing
requires greater discernment, or a more proper choice of
expressions, than a discourse held with children. What augments
this embarrassment in me, is the interpretation and weight they
give to every word that proceeds from a man who has wrote
professedly for children, and whose discourse is supposed to have
the weight of oracles for them. The constraint and inaptitude I
feel on these occasions, make me uneasy and disconcerted, and I
should be more at ease before an Asiatic monarch, than before a
child it was necessary to make prattle.</p>

<p>Another inconvenience, which I have already hinted at, puts me
at a greater distance from children, and though, since my
misfortunes I see them with the same satisfaction, yet I no longer
enjoy an equal familiarity. Children do not love old age; the sight
of decaying nature is hideous in their eyes: the repugnance I
discover in their little faces overwhelms me, and I had rather
abstain from caressing, than inspire them with disgust; but this
scruple is nothing to our modern philosophers of either sex. Madame
Geoffrin was little concerned whether children were pleased with
her or not, provided she was amused with them; but to me, that that
enjoyment is nothing unless it is reciprocal, and I am no longer in
an age or situation to see the hearts of children bound with
pleasure to meet mine; should that ever happen again, the
satisfaction, from its scarceness, would be more lively. I had a
striking proof of this the other morning, by the pleasure I took in
caressing the little ones of Soussoi; not only because the presence
of the good nurse who attended them laid me under no restraint, but
particularly from the cheerful air with which they accosted me, and
because, during the visit, they neither appeared weary, or
displeased with my company.</p>

<p>Alas! could I yet experience some moments of real tenderness,
proceeding from the heart, were it only from a child; could I once
more observe Joy and contentment in some eye, communicated by my
presence, for how many sorrows and troubles would it atone, by the
short, but delightful effusions my heart would experience! I should
not then be reduced to seek among animals that look of friendship
which is denied me by mankind. I can judge the effect it would
produce by a very few examples; but those are ever dear to my
memory. I will describe one, that in any other situation would have
been forgotten, and the impression it made on me, may furnish some
idea of the unhappiness of mine.</p>

<p>Two years ago, having been walking towards <i>La Nouvelle
France</i>, I turned to the left, and willing to extend my walk
round <i>Montmartre</i>, crossed the village of
<i>Clignancourt</i>. As I walked along, thoughtful, and regardless
of the surrounding objects, I felt something clasp my knees, and
immediately perceived it was a child of about five or six years
old, clinging round them, who at the same time looked up so fondly
and familiarly in my face, that I was greatly moved, saying to
myself, "thus I should have been treated by my own." I took the
child in my arms, and after having kissed it several times, in a
kind of transport, continued my way. I felt as I walked on that
something was wanting to complete my satisfaction, and this obliged
me to return. I reproached myself with having quitted the child so
soon, thinking I had discovered in its manner a kind of
inspiration, which ought not to have been slighted. Giving into the
temptation, I ran towards the child, embraced it again, and gave
him money to buy some small <i>Nanterre</i> loaves, a man who sold
them happening to be passing by. I began to make him talk, and on
asking whose son he was, he pointed to a man that was hooping some
barrels. I was just preparing to quit the child, in order to speak
to the father, when I was prevented by seeing a man whisper him,
who appeared to be one of those spies who are ever at my heels.
While this person was speaking, I remarked that the cooper's eyes
were fixed attentively on me, with no very friendly aspect: this
sight contracted my heart in an instant, and I quitted both father
and child, with greater expedition than I had returned to them; but
with a sensation less agreeable, and which altered my whole chain
of feelings. I have, notwithstanding, frequently felt these
sentiments revive, and have often passed <i>Clignancourt</i>, in
hopes of seeing this child again, but have never since met either
with him or his father, and the only result of this encounter is, a
lively remembrance, intermingled with that pleasing melancholy
which is natural to me in all those emotions that penetrate my
heart.</p>

<p>There is a compensation in all things; if my pleasures are short
and seldom occur, they are more lively when enjoyed, than if they
were more frequent. I renew them, if I may so express myself, by
frequent recollections, and though scarce, if they were unmixed and
pure, perhaps I should experience more happiness than I did in my
greatest prosperity. In extreme poverty, a very little makes us
rich; a beggar who picks up a crown piece is more affected with his
good fortune than a rich man would be on finding a purse of gold.
The world would laugh could they see into my soul, and view the
impression the smallest pleasures of this kind make on it, when I
can steal from the vigilance of my persecutors. Four or five years
ago, a most pleasing incident presented itself, which I never
recollect without delight, from having so well enjoyed it.</p>

<p>One Sunday I went with my wife to dine at Porte Maillot, after
which we crossed the wood of Boulogne, as far as <i>La Muette</i>;
there we sat down in the shade, waiting the decline of
the sun, designing to return gently through Passy. Soon after,
about twenty young girls, conducted by a kind of nun, arrived at
the same place: some seated themselves on the grass, while others
played round about us. During their play, a man with wafers passed
by, furnished with his drum and his lottery-board, seeking for
customers. I soon perceived that the young lasses longed for the
wafers, and two or three of them, who had, I suppose, some
farthings in their pockets, asked leave to play. While the
governess was hesitating and disputing on this point, I called the
man to me, bidding him let the young ladies draw once each, and I
would pay for them. This command inspired so much pleasure
throughout the whole company, that the sight of it would more than
have repaid me had I emptied my purse for that purpose. As I saw
their haste occasioned confusion, with the permission of the
governess, I ranged them all on one side, making them pass to the
other as they drew. Though there were no blanks, and each must at
least get one wafer, which would prevent entire discontent, yet I
privately took an opportunity of bidding the man use his ordinary
dexterity in a contrary sense so as to bestow as many prizes as
possible, and I would pay the difference. By this means near an
hundred wafers were distributed among them, though they drew but
once each, for on that score I was inexorable, neither favouring
those who were least fortunate, or showing any preference that
might raise discontents. My wife prevailed with those who had good
lots to share them with their comrades, by which means the prizes
were nearly equal, and the joy universal.</p>

<p>I entreated the nun to draw in her turn, though dreading to have
my offer disdainfully refused; but she accepted it with pleasure,
drawing like the pensioners, and taking her lot cheerfully. I
respected her for this conduct, looking on it as a kind of
politeness far preferable to any airs of affectation. During this
sport some disputes arose, which were brought before my tribunal,
at which these little ones pleaded in their turns, giving me an
opportunity to observe, that though none of them were pretty, the
gentility of some obliterated the idea of their want of beauty.</p>

<p>At length we separated, extremely well satisfied with each
other, and this afternoon was one of those which I recollect with
the greatest satisfaction. The amusement was not a very expensive
one, since for thirty sous, which was the most it cost me, I had an
hundred crown's worth of content; so true it is that pleasure does
not depend on extravagance, and that joy is as readily purchased by
pence as pounds. I went several times to this place, in hopes of
meeting the same little company, but was never fortunate enough to
do so.</p>

<p>This recalls to my memory another amusement of the same kind,
but much further back. It was during that unhappy period, when
familiar with the rich and men of letters, I was sometimes
constrained to partake of their melancholy amusements. I was at
<i>La Chevrette</i>, at a festival occasioned by the birthday of
its owner: all the family were assembled to celebrate it, with
every kind of noisy entertainment; neither shows, feasting, or
fireworks, were omitted; there was hardly time to breathe; it was
all giddiness, without amusement. After dinner, we took a walk in
the avenue, where a kind of fair was kept. The villagers were
dancing: the gentlemen condescended to dance with the country
maids; but the ladies maintained their dignity. There were people
here who sold gingerbread: a young gentleman took it in his head to
buy some, and throw it piece by piece among the crowd; and all the
company were so delighted to see the clowns scramble, fight, and
overthrow each other in quest of it, that everyone was eager to
contribute towards the sport. Gingerbread, therefore, flew in every
direction, while men and maids, running, falling, and laming each
other, offered a most charming amusement to the spectators. Though
not really pleased as they were, I did like the rest, from a
principle of false shame; but soon weary of emptying my purse in
order to lame my fellow creatures, I quitted the good company, and
walked alone through the fair. The variety of objects that
presented themselves, amused me for a considerable time: among
others, I perceived five or six Savoyard boys round a young girl,
who had about a dozen pititful apples yet remaining in her basket,
which she would willingly have parted with, but the Savoyards could
not muster above two or three farthings among them all, and these
were insufficient to make the desired purchase. This basket was to
them the garden of the Hesperides, and the young wench the dragon
that guarded this precious fruit. The farce amused me for some
time; at length, I concluded it by buying the apples, and
distributing them among the boys. I then enjoyed the most pleasing
spectacle that can flatter the heart of man, that of seeing joy,
united with the innocence of youth, spread itself all around me,
for the spectators, in contemplating, shared it; but I who
purchased it so cheaply, had the additional pleasure of feeling it
was my own work.</p>

<p>In comparing this amusement with that I had just quitted, I
felt, with satisfaction, the difference between real inclination
and natural pleasures, and those that spring from opulence, which
are engendered by derision and disdain; for what amusement should
be derived from seeing a number of our fellow-creatures, greedy
through poverty, overthrowing, choking, and brutally laming each
other, from eagerness to procure some morsels of gingerbread, which
had been trampled on, and were covered with dust?</p>

<p>For my part, when I reflect on the kind of voluptuousness I have
enjoyed on various occasions, I find it consisted less in
sentiments of benevolence than in the pleasure of contemplating
happy faces. That sight has, indeed, to me a charm, which, though
it penetrates my heart, appears to rise entirely from animal
sensation; for if I do not feet the satisfaction I bestow, though
fully convinced, of its reality, it does not give me half the
pleasure. This is to me even a disinterested enjoyment, which does
not depend on the part I take in it; for in public holidays, the
pleasure of contemplating a number of happy faces, has ever
attracted me. This pleasure has often been frustrated in France,
for that nation, who pretend to so much gaiety, show little of it
in their sports, Formerly, I often went to the Guinguettes, to see
the poorer sort of people dance; but these dances were so awkward,
and their behaviour and countenances so dull and melancholy, that I
always left them rather wearied than amused; but at Geneva, and in
Switzerland, where mirth and laughter do not continually evaporate
in malignant tricks, everything breathes contentment and gaiety in
their public entertainments. The hideous aspect of poverty is
banished, neither does pride show its insolence; but good-will,
friendship, and concord dispose all hearts to cheerfulness.
Frequently, in the transports of innocent joy, strangers accost,
embrace, and invite each other to share the pleasures of the day.
In order to enjoy these pleating sports, it is not necessary I
should be actually engaged in them, let me but see, and I am
certain to partake of the jollity; and among so many contented
faces, I am convinced there would not be found one heart more happy
than my own.</p>

<p>Though this is a pleasure arising only from sensation, it has
certainly a moral cause, and what is a proof of this, the same
objects, instead of delighting, wound me with grief and
indignation, when I am convinced that these expressions of
satisfaction and pleasure on the faces as the mischievous, are only
signs that their malice is accomplished. An appearance of innocent
joy is the only kind that delights my heart; cruel, satirical
mirth, overwhelms and afflicts it though I am not the object of its
malignity. These symptoms, certainly, are not exactly the same,
arising from such different principles: yet they are equally the
marks of satisfaction, and the perceptible difference cannot he
proportionate to the emotions which they excite in me.</p>

<p>Expressions of sorrow and pain affect me even yet more
powerfully, to a height which I cannot sustain, without being
agitated with emotions more lively than those which occasioned
them. Imagination adds to the acuteness of my feelings, and
incorporates me with the suffering person, frequently inflicting
greater torments than himself endures. A discontented face is
another sight I cannot support, particularly if I think the cause
bears any reference to myself; I cannot tell how many crown pieces
the lowring, ill-natured looks of the foot men who waited, have
forced out of my pocket, in those houses to which I formerly had
the folly to let myself be dragged, and where the servants always
made me pay dearly for the hospitality of their masters. Ever too
much affected with sensible objects, especially by those which
demonstrate pleasure or dissatisfaction, benevolence or aversion, I
suffer myself to be influenced by these exterior expressions,
having no resource to escape their influence but flight. A sign, a
gesture, a glance of the eye, from, an unknown person; is
sufficient to destroy my happiness, or calm my sufferings strings.
I am only in my own power when alone; at other times, I am the
sport of all those who happen to surround me.</p>

<p>Formerly, I lived in the world with pleasure, when I saw nothing
but benevolence in every countenance, or, at worst, indifference in
those who were unknown to me; but, at present, when my persecutors
do not take less pains to make my person generally known, than to
hide my disposition, I cannot set my foot in the streets without
finding myself surrounded with heart-rending objects. I hasten with
my utmost speed into the country, and the instant I perceive the
verdure I begin to breathe at ease. Is it astonishing that I am fond
of solitude, since I see nothing but animosity on the faces of
mankind, while Nature ever wears a smile at my approach?</p>

<p>I must confess, notwithstanding, that I yet feel pleasure in
living among those who are strangers to my person, but this
satisfaction they have almost entirely deprived me of. I loved,
some years ago, to ramble through the villages, to see the
countrymen in the morning, mending their flails, or the women
sitting at the doors with their children. This sight had in it an
inexpressible charm, which touched my heart: I sometimes stopped
instinctively to observe the contrivances of these good people,
sighing, I knew not why. I am ignorant whether my persecutors took
notice that I enjoyed this trifling amusement, and therefore
resolved to deprive me of it; but from the altered looks of the
villagers, as I passed by, and the air with which they seemed to
examine me, I was persuaded that great care had been taken to
deprive me of that satisfaction. The same tiling was still more
strikingly observable at the Hospital 6s the Invalids: that
excellent establishment has ever interested me, nor can I behold
without tenderness and veneration, those good old men, who may say
with those of Lacedemon,</p>

<p class="poem">Once we were, though now grown old,<br>
Valiant, hardy, young, and bold.</p>

<p>One of my favorite walks used to be round the military school,
where I frequently met with some invalids who having preserved
their ancient military civility, saluted me as I passed. This
salute, which my heart returned, an hundred fold, flattered and
augmented the pleasure I felt at seeing them. Not being able to
conceal anything of this kind, I frequently spoke of the invalids,
and the manner in which their presence affected me&mdash;No more
was necessary&mdash;soon after I perceived I was not unknown among
them, or rather that was worse than known, since they now viewed me
with the public eye. From that time, no more civility, no more
salutations; a distant air and visible shyness took place of their
former urbanity. The freedom of their ancient profession not
permitting them to conceal animosity under smiles and falsehood,
they openly showed me the most violent hatred; and such is the
extreme misery of my situation, that I am constrained to esteem
them most, who least disguise their ill will.</p>

<p>Since then, I walk with less pleasure by the Hospital of the
Invalids: but my opinion of them does not depend on their thoughts
of me, and I never see without respect and veneration, those
ancient defenders of their country, though I feel the hardship of
having the justice I do them so indifferently repaid. If by chance
I meet with one who has escaped the common information, or not
knowing my person, expresses no aversion, the friendly salute I
receive from him compensates for the repulsive behaviour of the
rest. I forget their unkindness, to remember his good nature,
imagining he possesses a soul like mine, into which hatred cannot
enter.</p>

<p>I fully experienced this pleasure last year, in crossing the
water to the Isle of Swans. A poor old invalid was waiting the
arrival of more company; when I came up, I stepped into the boat,
and bid the ferryman put off. The water was rough, and the passage
tedious. I hardly dared address a word to the invalid, for fear of
being repulsed, as usual; but his civility reassured me. We chatted
together; he appeared to be a man of sense and morality&mdash;I was
delighted with his affable and courteous behaviour, not being
accustomed to so much kindness; but my surprise ceased when I
learned he had just arrived from the country, consequently it was
natural to surmise that my person had not been pointed out to him,
and that he had not received the usual instructions. I profited by
this opportunity to converse one moment with a man, and felt, from
the pleasure I experienced in it, how much the value of our most
common pleasures is capable of being augmented by their scarcity.
When we were about to leave the boat, he prepared his poor
halfpenny; but I paid the passage, begging him to put it up,
though, I trembled at the same time for fear I should displease
him, which, however, did not happen; on the contrary, he seemed
sensible of my attention, and particularly to that (as he was older
than myself) of helping him out of the boat. Who would believe that
I was child enough to cry with pleasure! I ardently wished to put a
twenty-sous piece into his hand, to have furnished him with
tobacco, but could not take courage to attempt it. The same shame
has often prevented me from doing laudable actions, from which I
have abstained, deploring my imbecility.</p>

<p>For once, after quitting my invalid, I consoled myself by
reflecting, that I should have acted against my own principles, in
mingling with native benevolence, pecuniary objects, which foil and
degrade its disinterestedness, We should ever hasten to succor
those in want; but in the ordinary concerns of life, let us leave
benevolence and urbanity to do their work, without daring to
approach or corrupt so pure a source with anything venal or
mercenary. It is said that the people in Holland make yon pay for
being told the hour of the day, or directed to the place you want
to find. How despicable must that people be, how lost to the
endearing quality of benevolence, who thus sordidly make a traffic
of the most simple duties of humanity!</p>

<p>I have remarked, that hospitality is only sold in Europe:
throughout Asia you are lodged gratis. I well know that it is not
so abundantly furnished with conveniences; but is it nothing to be
enabled to say, "I am a man, and as such, received by my fellow
creatures: pure humanity affords me this shelter?" Small privations
are easily endured when the mind is better treated than the
body.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Tenth Walk</h2>

<p>THIS day is Palm Sunday. It is precisely fifty years since my
acquaintance commenced with Madame de Warrens. She was then eight
and twenty, being born with the century. I wanted something of
seventeen, and the increasing warmth of a temperament which I was
yet unacquainted with, gave additional heat to a heart naturally
full of life. If it was not astonishing that she should conceive an
affection for a young man, who, with an agreeable person, was
lively, though mild and modest; it is surely less extraordinary,
that a charming, sensible, and elegant woman, should inspire me
with gratitude, and with a yet more tender sentiment, which I could
not distinguish from it; but what is rather particular, this first
moment produced an inevitable chain of fate throughout my whole
future life. My natural organs not having yet developed the most
precious faculties of my soul, it had received no fixed form, but
seemed to wait with a kind of impatience for the moment that should
impress it, which moment, though accelerated by this meeting, did
not arrive so soon as might have been expected; since, by the
simplicity of manners which education had given me, that delightful
but rapid state was prolonged, in which love and innocence inhabit
the same heart. She sent me from her; but everything recalled me
back again: I found it necessary to return; this return fixed my
destiny, and long before she was mine, I lived for her alone. Ah!
had I been everything to her heart, as she was sufficient to mine,
what peaceful and happy days should we have passed together! We
have spent such; but they were short and rapid, and what a fate has
followed them! Not a day passes in which I do not recollect with
pleasure and tenderness, this short, and only time in my life, when
I enjoyed myself fully, without alloy or obstacle, and in which I
could be truly said to live. I can nearly say with the Roman
Prefect, who being disgraced under Vespasian, went to end his days
peaceably in the country, I have passed seventy years on the earth,
and have lived seven. Had it not been for this short but precious
interval, I should have remained a stranger to myself during my
whole life, having been so agitated, thrown, and dragged about by
the passions of others (though almost passive and unresisting)
through a stormy existence, that I should be puzzled to separate
what is really my own, in my actions or conduct, from what has been
compulsive, so much has cruel necessity kept me in subjection. But
during those few years, beloved by a most amiable and accomplished
woman, I acted as I pleased, was what I wished to be; while by the
employment of my leisure hours, aided by her lessons and example,
my soul (yet inexperienced and simple) received the impressions
best suited to its nature, and which it has ever since adhered to.
An inclination for solitude and contemplation sprang up in my
heart, with the expansive and tender sentiments which naturally
accompany such propensities. Tumult and noise contract and suppress
these feelings, while calmness and peace re-animate and exalt
them.</p>

<p>Solitude is necessary to me when in love: I engaged Madame de
Warrens, therefore, to retire into the country. A lonely house, on
the gentle declivity of a valley, was our asylum, where, for the
space of four or five years, I enjoyed an age of life, a full and
pure happiness, which enlivens with the charms of its remembrance
even my present wretched situation. I wished for a friend adapted
to my heart: I possessed her&mdash;I sighed for a country life; I
obtained it&mdash;I could not bear subjection; I was perfectly
free, and more than free; since following my attachments only, I
did no more than was delightful, my whole time being divided
between affectionate cares and rural employments. I only wished for
the continuation of so mild a fate, I felt no fear except that
which arose from the uncertainty of its continuance; this the
difficulties of our situation gave birth to, and it was not without
foundation. This too, suggested the idea both of endeavouring to
divert this uneasiness, and of providing resources against poverty.
I imagined that the attainment of talents was the most certain
security against the evils I dreaded; and, therefore, resolved to
employ my leisure so as to put myself in a situation to return one
day, if possible, to the best of women, that assistance I had
received from her.</p>
