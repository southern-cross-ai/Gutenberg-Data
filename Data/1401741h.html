  <h2>BILTMORE OSWALD<br>
  <small>THE DIARY OF A HAPLESS RECRUIT</small></h2>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Feb. 23d.</b></i> "And what," asked the enlisting
  officer, regarding me as if I had insulted him, his family and his live
  stock, "leads you to believe that you are remotely qualified to join the
  Navy?"</p>

  <p>At this I almost dropped my cane, which in the stress of my patriotic
  preoccupation I had forgotten to leave home.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I replied, making a hasty calculation of my numerous useless
  accomplishments, "nothing at all, sir, that is, nothing to speak of. Of
  course I've passed a couple of seasons at Bar Harbor&mdash;perhaps
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bar Harbor!" exploded the officer. "Bar! bah! bah&mdash;dammit," he broke
  off, "I'm bleating."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said I with becoming humility. His hostility increased.</p>

  <p>"Do you enlist for foreign service?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Sure," I replied. "It will all be foreign to me."</p>

  <p>The long line of expectant recruits began to close in upon us until a
  thirsty, ingratiating semi-circle was formed around the officer's desk. Upon
  the multitude he glared bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Orderly! why can't you keep this line in some sort of shape?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, give the old tosh some air," breathed a worthy in my ear as he
  retreated to his proper place.</p>

  <p>"What did you do at Bar Harbor?" asked the officer, fixing me with his
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"Oh," I replied easily, "I occasionally yachted."</p>

  <p>"On what kind of a boat?" he urged.</p>

  <p>"Now for the life of me, sir, I can't quite recall," I replied. "It was a
  splendid boat though, a perfect beauty, handsomely fitted up and all&mdash;I
  think they called her the 'Black Wing.'"</p>

  <p>These few little remarks seemed to leave the officer flat. He regarded me
  with a pitiful expression. There was pain in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," he whispered, "that you don't know what kind of a boat
  it was?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately no, sir," I replied, feeling really sorry for the wounded
  man.</p>

  <p>"Do you recall what was the nature of your activities aboard this
  mysterious craft?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed I do, sir," I replied. "I tended the jib-sheet."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said he thoughtfully, "sort of specialized on the jib-sheet?"</p>

  <p>"That's it, sir," said I, feeling things taking a turn for the better. "I
  specialized on the jib-sheet."</p>

  <p>"What did you do to this jib-sheet?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"I clewed it," said I promptly, dimly recalling the impassioned
  instructions an enthusiastic friend of mine had shunted at me throughout the
  course of one long, hot, horrible, confused afternoon of the past
  summer&mdash;my first, and, as I had hoped at the time, final sailing
  experience.</p>

  <p>The officer seemed to be lost in reflection. He was probably weighing my
  last answer. Then with a heavy sigh he took my paper and wrote something
  mysterious upon it.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make an experiment of you," he said, holding the paper to
  me. "You are going to be a sort of a test case. You're the worst applicant I
  have ever had. If the Navy can make a sailor out of you it can make a sailor
  out of anybody"; he paused for a moment, then added emphatically, "without
  exception."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," I replied humbly.</p>

  <p>"Report here Monday for physical examination," he continued, waving my
  thanks aside. "And now go away."</p><br>

  <p class="caption">'Do you enlist for foreign service?' He snapped.<br>
  'Sure,' I replied, 'It will all be foreign to me.'</p><br>

  <p>I accordingly went, but as I did so I fancied I caught the reflection of a
  smile lurking guiltily under his mustache. It was the sort of a smile, I
  imagined at the time, that might flicker across the grim visage of a lion in
  the act of anticipating an approaching trip to a prosperous native
  village.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Feb. 25th.</b></i> I never fully appreciated what a
  truly democratic nation the United States was until I beheld it naked, that
  is, until I beheld a number of her sons in that condition. Nakedness is the
  most democratic of all institutions. Knock-knees, warts and chilblains,
  bowlegs, boils and bay-windows are respecters of no caste or creed, but visit
  us all alike. These profound reflections came to me as I stood with a large
  gathering of my fellow creatures in the offices of the physical examiner.</p>

  <p>"Never have I seen a more unpromising candidate in all my past
  experience," said the doctor moodily when I presented myself before him, and
  thereupon he proceeded to punch me in the ribs with a vigor that seemed to be
  more personal than professional. When thoroughly exhausted from this he gave
  up and led me to the eye charts, which I read with infinite ease through long
  practise in following the World Series in front of newspaper buildings.</p>

  <p>"Eyes all right," he said in a disappointed voice. "It must be your
  feet."</p>

  <p>These proved to be faultless, as were my ears and teeth.</p>

  <p>"You baffle me," said the doctor at last, thoroughly discouraged.
  "Apparently you are sound all over, yet, looking at you, I fail to see how it
  is possible."</p>

  <p>I wondered vaguely if he was paid by the rejection. Then for no particular
  reason he suddenly tired of me and left me with all my golden youth and glory
  standing unnoticed in a corner. From here I observed an applicant being put
  through his ear test. This game is played as follows: a hospital apprentice
  thrusts one finger into the victim's ear while the doctor hurries down to the
  end of the room and whispers tragically words that the applicant must repeat.
  It's a good game, but this fellow I was watching evidently didn't know the
  rules and he was taking no chances.</p>

  <p>"Now repeat what I say," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"'Now repeat what I say,'" quoted the recruit.</p>

  <p>"No, no, not now," cried the doctor. "Wait till I whisper."</p>

  <p>"'No, no, not now. Wait till I whisper,'" answered the recruit, faithfully
  accurate.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I whisper, you blockhead," shouted the doctor.</p>

  <p>"'Wait till I whisper, you blockhead,'" shouted the recruit with equal
  heat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" cried the doctor despairingly.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, God!'" repeated the recruit in a mournful voice.</p>

  <p>This little drama of cross purposes might have continued indefinitely had
  not the hospital apprentice begun to punch the guy in the ribs, shouting as
  he did so:</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, can't you?"</p>

  <p>At which the recruit, a great hulk of a fellow, delivered the hospital
  apprentice a resounding blow in the stomach and turned indignantly to the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"That man's interfering," he said in an injured voice. "Now that ain't
  fair, is it, doc?"</p>

  <p>"You pass," said the doctor briefly, producing his handkerchief and
  mopping his brow.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you standing around for?" he said a moment later, spying
  me in my corner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, doctor," I cried, delighted, "I thought you had forgotten me."</p>

  <p>"No," said the doctor, "I'll never forget you. You pass. Take your papers
  and clear out."</p>

  <p>I can now feel with a certain degree of security that I am in the
  Navy.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Feb. 26th.</b></i> I broke the news to mother to-day
  and she took it like a little gentleman, only crying on twelve different
  occasions. I had estimated it much higher than that.</p>

  <p>After dinner she read me a list of the things I was to take with me to
  camp, among which were several sorts of life preservers, an electric bed
  warmer and a pair of dancing pumps.</p>

  <p>"Why not include spurs?" I asked, referring to the pumps. "I'd look very
  crisp in spurs, and they would help me in climbing the rigging."</p>

  <p>"But some officer might ask you to a dance," protested mother.</p>

  <p>"Mother," I replied firmly, "I have decided to decline all social
  engagements during my first few weeks in camp. You can send the pumps when I
  write for them."</p>

  <p>A card came to-day ordering me to report on March 1st. Consequently I am
  not quite myself.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Feb. 27th.</b></i> Mother hurried into my room this
  morning and started to pack my trunk. She had gotten five sweaters, three
  helmets and two dozen pairs of socks into it before I could stop her. When I
  explained to her that I wasn't going to take a trunk she almost broke
  down.</p>

  <p>"But at least," she said, brightening up, "I can go along with you and see
  that you are nice and comfortable in your room."</p>

  <p>"You seem to think that I am going to some swell boarding school, mother,"
  I replied from the bed. "You see, we don't have rooms to ourselves. I
  understand that we sleep in bays."</p>

  <p>"Don't jest," cried mother. "It's too horrible!"</p>

  <p>Then I explained to her that a bay was a compartment of a barracks in
  which eight human beings and one petty officer, not quite so human, were
  supposed to dwell in intimacy and, as far as possible, concord.</p>

  <p>This distressed poor mother dreadfully. "But what are you going to take?"
  she cried.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take a nap," said I, turning over on my pillow. "It will be
  the last one in a bed for a long, long time."</p>

  <p>At this mother stuffed a pair of socks in her mouth and left the room
  hastily.</p>

  <p>Polly came in to-night and I kissed her on and off throughout the evening
  on the strength of my departure. This infuriated father, but mother thought
  it was very pretty. However, before going to bed he gave me a handsome wrist
  watch, and grandfather, pointing to his game leg, said:</p>

  <p>"Remember the Mexican War, my boy. I fought and bled honorably in that
  war, by gad, sir!"</p>

  <p>I know for a fact that the dear old gentleman has never been further west
  than the Mississippi River.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Feb. 28th (on the train).</b></i> I have just gone
  through my suit-case and taken out some of mother's last little gifts such as
  toilet water, a padded coat hanger, one hot water bottle, some cough syrup,
  two pairs of ear-bobs, a paper vest and a blue pokerdotted silk muffler. She
  put them in when I wasn't looking. I have hidden them under the seat. May the
  Lord forgive me for a faithless son.</p>

  <p>The departure was moist, but I managed to swim through. I am too excited
  to read the paper and too rattle-brained to think except in terrified
  snatches. I wonder if I look different. People seem to be regarding me
  sympathetically. I recognize two faces on this train. One belongs to Tony,
  the iceman on our block; the other belongs to one named Tim, a barkeep, if I
  recall rightly, in a hotel I have frequently graced with my presence. I hope
  their past friendship was not due to professional reasons. It would be nice
  to talk over old times with them in camp, for I have frequently met the one
  in the morning after coming home from the other.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 1st.</b></i> Subjected myself to the intimate
  scrutiny of another doctor this morning. I used my very best Turkish bath
  manners. They failed to impress him. Hospital apprentice treated me to a shot
  of Pelham "hop." It is taken in the customary manner, through the
  arm&mdash;very stimulating. A large sailor held me by the hand for fully
  fifteen minutes. Very embarrassing! He made pictures of my fingers and
  completely demolished my manicure. From there I passed on to another room.
  Here a number of men threw clothes at me from all directions. The man with
  the shoes was a splendid shot. I am now a sailor&mdash;at least,
  superficially. My trousers were built for Charlie Chaplin. I feel like a
  masquerade.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">'I feel like a masquerade.'</p><br>

  <p>A gang of recruits shouted "twenty-one days" at me as I was being led to
  Mess Hall No. 1. The poor simps had just come in the day before and had not
  even washed their leggings yet. I shall shout at other recruits to-morrow,
  though, the same thing that they shouted at me to-day.</p>

  <p>Our P.O. is a very terrifying character. He is a stern but just man, I
  take it.</p>

  <p>He can tie knots and box the compass and say "pipe down" and everything.
  Gee, it must be nice to be a real sailor!</p><br>

  <p class="caption">This, I thought, was adding insult to injury.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 2d.</b></i> Fell out of my hammock last night
  and momentarily interrupted the snoring contest holding sway. I was told to
  "pipe down" in Irish, Yiddish, Third Avenue and Bronx. This, I thought, was
  adding insult to injury, but could not make any one take the same view of it.
  I hope the thing does not become a habit with me. I form habits so readily.
  In connection with snoring I have written the following song which I am going
  to send home to Polly. I wrote it in the Y.M.C.A. Hut this afternoon while
  crouching between the feet of two embattled checker players. I'm going to
  call it "The Rhyme of the Snoring Sailor." It goes like this:</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="verse">The mother thinks of her sailor son<br>
  As clutched in the arms of war,<br>
  But mother should listen, as I have done,<br>
  To this same little, innocent sailor son<br>
  Sprawl in his hammock and snore.<br>
  <br>
  Oh, the sailor man is a rugged man,<br>
  The master of wind and wave,<br>
  And poets sing till the tea-rooms ring<br>
  Of his picturesque, deep sea grave,<br>
  And they likewise write of the "Storm at Night"<br>
  When the numerous north winds roar,<br>
  But more profound is the dismal sound<br>
  Of a sea-going sailor's snore.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="verse">Oh, mothers knit for their sailor sons<br>
  Socks for their nautical toes,<br>
  But mothers should list to the frightful noise<br>
  Made by their innocent sailor boys<br>
  By the wind they blow through their nose.<br>
  <br>
  Oh, life at sea is wild and free<br>
  And greatly to be admired,<br>
  But I would sleep both sound and deep<br>
  At night when I'm feeling tired.<br>
  <br>
  So here we go with a yo! ho! ho!<br>
  While the waves and the tempests soar,<br>
  An artist can paint a shrew as a saint,<br>
  But not camouflage on a snore.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="verse">Oh, mothers, write to your sons at sea;<br>
  Write to them, I implore,<br>
  A letter as earnest as it can be,<br>
  Containing a delicate, motherly plea,<br>
  A plea for them not to snore.<br>
  <br>
     Oh, I take much pride in my trousers wide,<br>
     The ladies all think them sweet,<br>
        And I must admit that I love to sit<br>
        In a chair and relieve my feet.<br>
     Avast! Belay! and we're bound away<br>
     With our hearts lashed fast to the fore,<br>
        But when mermaids sleep<br>
     In their bowers deep,<br>
     Do you think that the sweet things snore?</p><br>

  <p>Our company commander spoke to us this morning in no uncertain terms. He
  seems to be such a serious man. There is a peculiar quality in his voice, not
  unlike the tone of a French 75 mm. gun. You can easily hear everything he
  says&mdash;miles away. We rested this afternoon.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 3d.</b></i> Sunday&mdash;a day of rest, for
  which I gave, in the words of our indefatigable Chaplain, "three good,
  rollicking cheers." Some folks are coming up to see me this afternoon. I hear
  I must moo through the fence at them like a cow. (Later.) The folks have just
  left. Mother kept screaming through the wire about my underwear. She seemed
  to have it on her brain. There were several young girls standing right next
  to her. I really felt I was no longer a bachelor. Why do mothers lay such
  tremendous stress on underwear? They seem to believe that a son's sole duty
  to his parents consists in publicly announcing that he is clad in winter
  flannels.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">Mother kept screaming through the wire about my
  underwear.</p><br>

  <p>Polly drove up for a moment with Joe Henderson. I hope the draft gets hold
  of that bird. They were going to have tea at the Biltmore when they got back
  to the city. I almost bit the end off of a sentry's bayonet when I heard this
  woeful piece of news. Liberty looks a long way off.</p>

  <p>I made an attempt to write some letters in the Y.M.C.A. this evening but
  gave up before the combined assault of a phonograph, a piano, and a flanking
  detachment of checker players. Several benches fell on me and I went to the
  mat feeling very sorry for myself.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 4th.</b></i> The morning broke badly. I lashed
  my hand to my hammock and was forced to call on the P.O. to extricate me. He
  remarked, with ill-disguised bitterness, that I could think of more
  ineffectual things to do than any rookie it had been his misfortune to meet.
  I told him that I didn't have to think of them, they just came naturally.</p>

  <p>Last night I was nearly frightened out of my hammock by awakening and
  gazing into the malevolent eye of my high-powered, twin-six wrist watch. I
  thought for a moment that the Woolworth tower had crawled into bed with me.
  It gave me such a start. I must get used to my wrist watch&mdash;also wearing
  a handkerchief up my sleeve. I feel like the sweet kid himself now.</p>

  <p>Drill all day. My belt fell off and tripped me up. Why do such things
  always happen to me? Somebody told us to do squads left and it looked as if
  we were playing Ring Around Rosie. Then we performed a fiendish and
  complicated little quadrille called a "company square." I found myself, much
  to my horror, on the inside of the contraption walking directly behind the
  company commander. It was a very delicate situation for a while. I walked on
  my tip-toes so that he wouldn't hear me. Had he looked around I know I'd have
  dropped my gun and lit out for home and mother.</p>

  <p>Forgot to take my hat off in the mess room. I was reminded, though, by
  several hundred thoughtful people.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 5th.</b></i> Stood for half an hour in the mail
  line. Got one letter. A bill from a restaurant for eighteen dollars' worth of
  past luncheons. I haven't the heart to write more.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 6th.</b></i> Bag inspection. I almost put my eye
  out at right hand salute. However, my bag looked very cute indeed, and
  although he didn't say anything, I feel sure the inspecting officer thought
  mine was the best. I had a beautiful embroidered handkerchief holder,
  prominently displayed, which I am sure must have knocked him cold. He missed
  the dirty white, but I will never be the same.</p><br>

  same.</p><br>

  <p>Fire drill! My hammock came unlashed right in front of a C.P.O. and he
  asked me if I was going to sleep in it on the spot. It was a very inspiring
  scene. Particularly thrilling was the picture I caught of a very heavy sailor
  picking on a poor innocent looking little fire extinguisher. He ran the thing
  right over my foot. I apologized, as usual. I discovered that I have been
  putting half instead of marlin hitches in my hammock, but not before the
  inspecting officer did. He seemed very upset about it. When he asked me why I
  only put six hitches in my hammock instead of seven, I replied that my rope
  was short. His reply still burns in my memory. What eloquence! What
  earnestness! What a day!</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 7th.</b></i> Second jab to-morrow. I am too
  nervous to write to-day. More anon.</p>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 16th.</b></i> Life in the Navy is just one round
  of engagements to keep. Simply splendid! All we have to do is to get up at 6
  o'clock in the morning when it is nice and dark and play around with the
  cutest little hammock imaginable. When you have arrived at the most
  interesting part of this game, the four hitch period, and you are wondering
  whether you are going to beat your previous record and get six instead of
  five, the bugle blows and immediately throws you into a state of great
  indecision. The problem is whether to finish the hammock and be reported late
  for muster or to attend muster and be reported for not having finished your
  hammock. The time spent in considering this problem usually results in your
  trying to do both and in failing to accomplish either, getting reported on
  two counts. Any enlisted man is entitled to play this game and he is sure of
  making a score. After running around innumerable miles of early morning camp
  scenery and losing several buttons from your new trousers, you come back and
  do Greek dances for a man who aspires to become a second Mordkin or a Mr.
  Isadora Duncan. This is all very sweet and I am sure the boys play prettily
  together. First he dances, then we dance; then he interprets a bird and we
  all flutter back at him. This being done to his apparent satisfaction, we
  proceed to crawl and grind and weave and wave in a most extraordinary manner.
  This is designed to give us physical poise to enable us to go aloft in a
  graceful and pleasing manner. After this dancing in the dew you return for a
  few more rounds with your hammock, clean up your bay and stand in line for
  breakfast. After breakfast we muster again and a gentleman talks to us in a
  voice that would lead you to believe that he thought we were all in hiding
  somewhere in New Rochelle. Then there are any number of things to do to
  divert our minds&mdash;scrub hammocks, pick up cigarettes, drill, hike and
  attend lectures. As a rule we do all of these things. From 5 p.m. until 8:45
  p.m. if we are unfortunate enough not to have a lecture party we are free to
  give ourselves over to the riotous joy of the moment, which consists of
  listening to a phonograph swear bitterly at a piano long past its prime. The
  final act of the drama of the day is performed on the hammock&mdash;an
  animated little sketch of arms and legs conducted along the lines of Houdini
  getting into a strait-jacket, or does he get out of them? I don't know,
  perhaps both. Anyway, you get what I mean.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 17th.</b></i> This spring weather is bringing
  the birds out in great quantities. They bloomed along the fence today like a
  Ziegfeld chorus on an outing. One girl carried on a coherent conversation
  with six different fellows at once and left each of them feeling that he
  alone had been singled out for her particular favor. As a matter of fact I
  was flirting with her all the time and I could tell by the very way she
  looked that she would have much rather been talking to me. Last week I had to
  convince mother that I was wearing my flannels; this week I had to convince
  her I still had them on. The only way to satisfy her, I suppose, is to appear
  before her publicly in them. Poor, dear mother, she told me she had written
  the doctor up here asking him not to squirt my arm full of those horrid
  little germs any more. She said I came from a good, clean family, and had
  been bathed once a week all my life, except the time when I had the measles
  and then it wasn't advisable. I am sure this must have cheered the doctor up
  tremendously. She also asked him to be sure to see that I got my meals
  regularly. I can see him now taking me by the hand and leading me to the
  mess-hall. When I suggested to mother that she write President Wilson asking
  him to be sure to see that my blankets didn't fall off at night, she said
  that I was a sarcastic, ungrateful boy.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 18th.</b></i> There is something decidedly wrong
  with me as a sailor. I got my pictures to-day. Try as I may, I am unable to
  locate the trouble. There seems to be some item left out. Not enough salt in
  the mixture, perhaps. I don't know exactly what it is but I seem to be a
  little too, may I say, handsome or, perhaps, polished would be the better
  word. I'm afraid to send the pictures away because no one will believe them.
  They will think I borrowed the clothes.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 19th.</b></i> A funny thing happened last Sunday
  that I forgot to record. A girl had her foot on the fence and when she took
  it down every one yelled, "As you were." Sailors have such a delicate sense
  of humor. Well, that's about enough for to-day.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 20th.</b></i> We had a lecture on boats to-day.
  The only thing I don't know now is how to tell a bilge from a painter. The
  oar was easy. It is divided into three parts, the stem, the lead and the
  muzzle. I must remember this, it is very important. The men are getting so
  used to inoculations around here that they complain when they don't get
  enough. We're shaping up into a fine body of men, our company commander told
  us this morning, and added, that if we continue to pick up cigarette butts
  several more weeks we'll be able to stack arms without dropping our guns.
  Eli, the goat, seems unwell to-day. I attribute his unfortunate condition to
  his constant and unrelenting efforts to keep the canteen clear of paper. It
  is my belief that goats are not healthy because of the fact that they eat
  paper, but in spite of it, and I feel sure that if all goats got together and
  decided to cut out paper for a while and live on a regular diet, they would
  be a much more robust race. The movies were great to-night. I saw Sidney
  Drew's left ear and a mole on the neck of the man in front of me.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 21st.</b></i> A fellow in our bay asked last
  night how much an admiral's pay was a month and when we told him he yawned,
  turned over on his side and said, "Not enough." He added that he could pick
  up that much at a first-class parade any time. We all tightened our wrist
  watches. Been blinking at the blinker all evening. Can't make much sense out
  of it. The bloomin' thing is always two blinks ahead of me. It's all very
  nice, I dare say, but I'd much rather get my messages on scented paper. I got
  one to-day. She called me her "Great, big, cute little sailor boy." Those
  were her exact words. How clever she is. I'm going to marry her just as soon
  as I'm a junior lieutenant. She'll wait a year, anyway.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 22d.</b></i> I made up verses to myself in my
  hammock last night. Perhaps I'll send some of them to the camp paper. It
  would be nice to see your stuff in print. Here's one of the poems:</p>

  <h3>THE UNREGENERATE SAILOR MAN</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="verse">I take my booze<br>
  In my overshoes;<br>
  I'm fond of the taste of rubber;<br>
  I oil my hair<br>
  With the grease of bear<br>
  Or else with a bull whale's blubber.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="verse">My dusky wife<br>
  Was a source of strife,<br>
  So I left her in Singapore<br>
  And sailed away<br>
  At the break of day&mdash;<br>
  Since then I have widowed four.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="verse">Avast! Belay,<br>
  And alack-a-day<br>
  That I gazed in the eyes of beauty.<br>
  For in devious ways<br>
  Their innocent gaze<br>
  Has caused me much extra duty.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="verse">I never get past<br>
  The jolly old mast,<br>
  The skipper and I are quite chummy;<br>
  He knows me by sight<br>
  When I'm sober or tight<br>
  And calls me a "wicked old rummy."</p><br>

  <p>A sort of sweetheart-in-every-port type I intend to make him&mdash;a
  seafaring man of the old school such as I suppose some of the six-stripers
  around here were. I don't imagine it was very difficult to get a good conduct
  record in the old days, because from all the tales I've heard from this
  source and that, a sailor-man who did not too openly boast of being a
  bigamist and who limited his homicidical inclinations to half a dozen
  foreigners when on shore leave, was considered a highly respectable
  character. Perhaps this is not at all true and I for one can hardly believe
  it when I look at the virtuous and impeccable exteriors of the few remaining
  representatives with whom I have come in contact. However, any one has my
  permission to ask them if it is true or not, should they care to find out for
  themselves. I refuse to be held responsible though. I think I shall send this
  poem to the paper soon.</p>

  <p>It must be wonderful to get your poems in print. All my friends would be
  so proud to know me. I wonder if the editors are well disposed, God-fearing
  men.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">Liberty Party</p><br>

  <p>From all I hear they must be a hard lot. Probably they'll be nice to me
  because of my connections. I know so many bartenders. Next week I rate
  liberty! Ah, little book, I wonder what these pages will contain when I come
  back. I hate to think. New York, you know, is such an interesting
  place.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 25th.</b></i> Man! Man! How I suffer! I'm so
  weary I could sleep on my company commander's breast, and to bring oneself to
  that one must be considerably fatigued, so to speak. Who invented liberty,
  anyway? It's a greatly over-rated pastime as far as I can make out,
  consisting of coming and going with the middle part omitted.</p>

  <p>One man whispered to me at muster this morning that all he could remember
  of his liberty was checking out and checking in. He looked unwell. My old
  pal, "Spike" Kelly, I hear was also out of luck. His girl was the skipper of
  a Fourteenth Street crosstown car, so he was forced to spend most of his time
  riding, between the two rivers. He nickeled himself to death in doing it. He
  said if Mr. Shonts plays golf, as no doubt he does, he has "Spike" Kelly to
  thank for a nice, new box of golf balls. And while on the subject, "Spike"
  observes that one of those engaging car signs should read:</p>

  <p>"Is it Gallantry, or the Advent of Woman Suffrage, or the Presence of the
  Conductorette that Causes So Many Sailors to Wear Out Their Seats Riding Back
  and Forth, and So Many Unnecessary Fares to Be Rung Up in So Doing?"</p>

  <p>His conversation with "Mame," his light-o'-love, was conducted along this
  line:</p>

  <p>"Say, Mame."</p>

  <p>"Yes, George, dear (fare, please, madam). What does tweetums want?"</p>

  <p>"You look swell in your new uniform."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Georgie, do you think it fits? (Yes, madam, positively, the car was
  brushed this morning, your baby will be perfectly safe inside.)"</p>

  <p>"Mame."</p>

  <p>"George! (Step forward, please.) Go on, dear."</p>

  <p>"Mame, it's doggon hard to talk to you here."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it just! (What is it lady? Cabbage? Oh, baggage! No, no, you can't
  check baggage here; this isn't a regular train.) George, stop holding my
  hand! I can't make change!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, Mame, who do you love?"</p>

  <p>"Why, tweetums, I love&mdash;(plenty of room up forward! Don't jam up the
  door) you, of course. (Fare, please! Fare, please! Have your change
  ready!)"</p>

  <p>"Can't we get a moment alone, Mame?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear; wait until twelve-thirty, and we'll drive to the car barn
  then. (Transfers! Transfers!)"</p>

  <p>"Spike" says that his liberty was his first actual touch with the horrors
  of war.</p>

  <p>Another bird that lived in some remote corner of New York State told me in
  pitiful tones that all he had time to do was to walk down the street of his
  home town, shake hands with the Postmaster, lean over the fence and kiss his
  girl (it had to go two ways, Hello and Good-by), take a package of clean
  underwear from his mother as he passed by and catch the outbound train on the
  dead run. All he could do was to wave to the seven other inhabitants. He
  thought the Grand Central Terminal was a swell dump, though. He said: "There
  was quite a lot of it," which is true.</p>

  <p>As for myself, I think it best to pass lightly over most of the incidents
  of my own personal liberty. The best part of a diary is that one can show up
  one's friends to the exclusion of oneself. Anyway, why put down the
  happenings of the past forty-three hours? They are indelibly stamped on my
  memory. One sight I vividly recall, "Ardy" Muggins, the multi-son of Muggins
  who makes the automatic clothes wranglers. He was sitting in a full-blooded
  roadster in front of the Biltmore, and the dear boy was dressed this wise
  ("Ardy" is a sailor, too, I forgot to mention): There was a white hat on his
  head; covering and completely obliterating his liberty blues was a huge
  bearskin coat, which when pulled up disclosed his leggins neatly strapped
  over patent leather dancing pumps. It was an astounding sight. One that
  filled me with profound emotion.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a trifle out of uniform, Ardy?" I asked him. One has to be so
  delicate with Ardy, he's that sensitive.</p>

  <p>"Why, I thought I might as well embellish myself a bit," says Ardy.</p>

  <p>"You've done all of that," says I, "but for heaven's sake, dear, do keep
  away from Fourteenth Street; there are numerous sea-going sailors down there
  who might embellish you still further."</p>

  <p>"My God!" cries Ardy, striving to crush the wind out of the horn, "I never
  slum."</p>

  <p>"Don't," says I, passing inside to shake hands with several of my friends
  behind the mahogany. Shake hands, alas, was all I did.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 26th.</b></i> I must speak about the
  examinations before I forget it. What a clubby time we had of it. I got in a
  trifle wrong at the start on account of my sociable nature. You know, I
  thought it was a sort of a farewell reception given by the officers and the
  C.P.O.'s to the men departing after their twenty-one days in Probation, so
  the first thing I did when I went in was to shake hands with an Ensign, who I
  thought was receiving. He got rid of my hand with the same briskness that one
  removes a live coal from one's person. The whole proceeding struck me as
  being a sort of charity bazaar. People were wandering around from booth to
  booth, in a pleasant sociable manner, passing a word here and sitting down
  there in the easiest-going way imaginable. Leaving the Ensign rather
  abruptly, I attached myself to the throng and started in search of ice cream
  and cake. This brought me up at a table where there was a very pleasant
  looking C.P.O. holding sway, and with him I thought I would hold a few words.
  What was my horror on hearing him snap out in a very crusty manner:</p>

  <p>"How often do you change your socks?"</p>

  <p>This is a question I allow no man to ask me. It is particularly
  objectionable. "Why, sir," I replied, "don't you think you are slightly
  overstepping the bounds of good taste? One does not even jest about such
  totally personal matters, ye know." Then rising, I was about to walk away
  without even waiting for his reply, but he called me back and handed me my
  paper, on which he had written "Impossible" and underlined it.</p>

  <p>The next booth I visited seemed to be a little more hospitable, so I sat
  down with the rest of the fellows and prepared to talk of the events of the
  past twenty-one days.</p>

  <p>"How many Articles are there?" suddenly asked a C.P.O. who hitherto had
  escaped my attention.</p>

  <p>"Twelve," I replied promptly, thinking I might just as well play the game,
  too.</p>

  <p>"What are they based on?" he almost hissed, but not quite.</p>

  <p>"The Constitution of these United States," I cried in a loud,
  public-spirited voice, at which the C.P.O. choked and turned dangerously red.
  It seems that not only was I not quite right, but that I couldn't have been
  more wrong.</p>

  <p>"Go," he gasped, "before I do you some injury." A very peculiar man, I
  thought, but, nevertheless, his heart seemed so set on my going that I
  thought it would be best for us to part.</p>

  <p>"I am sure I do not wish to force myself upon you," I said icily as I
  left. The poor man appeared to be on the verge of having a fit.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to tie some knots?" asked a kind-voiced P.O. at the next
  booth.</p>

  <p>"Crazy about it," says I, easy like.</p>

  <p>"Then tie some," says he. So I tied a very pretty little knot I had
  learned at the kindergarten some years ago and showed it to him.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" says he.</p>

  <p>"That," replies I coyly. "Why, that is simply a True Lover's knot. Do you
  like it?"</p>

  <p>"Orderly," he screamed. "Orderly, remove this." And hands were laid upon
  me and I was hurled into the arms of a small, but ever so sea-going appearing
  chap, who was engaged in balancing his hat on the bridge of his nose and
  wig-wagging at the same time. After beating me over the head several times
  with the flags, he said I could play with him, and he began to send me
  messages with lightning-like rapidity. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Really," I replied, "I lost interest in your message before you
  finished."</p>

  <p>After this my paper looked like a million dollars with the one knocked
  off.</p>

  <p>"What's a hackamatack?" asked the next guy. Thinking he was either kidding
  me or given to using baby talk, I replied:</p>

  <p>"Why, it's a mixture between a thingamabob and a nibleck."</p>

  <p>His treatment of me after this answer so unnerved me that I dropped my gun
  at the next booth and became completely demoralized. The greatest
  disappointment awaited me at "Monkey Drill," or setting up exercises,
  however. I thought I was going to kill this. I felt sure I was going to
  outstrip all competitors. But in the middle of it all the examiner yelled out
  in one of those sarcastic voices that all rookies learn to fear: "Are you
  trying to flirt with me or do you think you're a bloomin' angel?"</p>

  <p>This so sickened me at heart that I left the place without further ado,
  whatever that might be. Pink teas in the Navy are not unmixed
  virtues.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 27th.</b></i> My birthday, and, oh, how I do
  miss my cake. It's the first birthday I ever had without a cake except two
  and then I had a bottle. Oh, how well I remember my last party (birthday
  party)!</p>

  <p>There was father and the cake all lit up in the center of the table; I
  mean the cake, not father, of course. And there was Gladys (I always called
  her "Glad"). She'd been coming to my birthday parties for years and years.
  She always came first and left last and ate the most and got the sickest of
  all the girls I knew. It was appalling how that girl could eat.</p>

  <p>But, as I was saying, there was father and the cake, and there was mother
  and "Glad" and all the little candles were twinkling, lighting up my presents
  clustered around, among them being half a dozen maroon silk socks, a box of
  striped neck ties, all perfect joys; spats, a lounging gown, ever so many
  gloves and the snappiest little cane in all the world. And what have I around
  me now? A swab on one side, a bucket on the other, a broom draped over my
  shoulder, C.P.O.'s in front of me, P.O.'s behind me and work all around
  me&mdash;oh, what a helluvabirthday! I told my company commander last night
  that the next day was going to be my birthday, hoping he would do the
  handsome thing and let me sleep a little later in the morning, but did he?
  No, the Brute, he said I should get up earlier so as to enjoy it longer. As
  far as I can find out, the Camp remains totally unmoved by the fact that I am
  one year older to-day&mdash;and what a hubbub they used to raise at home. I
  think the very least they could do up here would be to ask me to eat with the
  officers.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 28th.</b></i> These new barracks over in the
  main camp are too large; not nearly so nice as our cosey little bays. I'm
  really homesick for Probation and the sound of our old company commander's
  dulcet voice. I met Eli on the street to-day and I almost broke down on his
  neck and cried. He was the first familiar thing I had seen since I came over
  to the main camp.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>March 29th.</b></i> This place is just like the
  Probation Camp, only more so. Life is one continual lecture trimmed with
  drills and hikes&mdash;oh, when will I ever be an Ensign, with a cute little
  Submarine Chaser all my own?</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 6th.</b></i> The events of the past few days
  have so unnerved me that I have fallen behind in my diary. I must try to
  catch up, for what would posterity do should the record of my inspiring
  career in the service not be faithfully recorded for them to read with
  reverence and amazement in days to come?</p>

  <p>One of the unfortunate events arose from scraping a too intimate
  acquaintance with that horrid old push ball. How did it ever get into camp
  anyway, and who ever heard of a ball being so large? It doesn't seem somehow
  right to me&mdash;out of taste, if you get what I mean. There is a certain
  lack of restraint and conservatism about it which all games played among
  gentlemen most positively should possess. But the chap who pushed that great
  big beast of a push ball violently upon my unsuspecting nose was certainly no
  gentleman. Golly, what a resounding whack! This fellow (I suspect him of
  being a German spy, basing my suspicions upon his seeming disposition for
  atrocities) was standing by, looking morosely at this small size planet when
  I blows gently up and says playfully in my most engaging voice:</p>

  <p>"I say, old dear, you push it to me and I'll push it to you&mdash;softly,
  though, chappy, softly." And with that he flung himself upon the ball and
  hurled it full upon my nose, completely demolishing it. Now I have always
  been a little partial to my nose. My eyes, I'll admit, are not quite as
  soulful as those liquid orbs of Francis X. Bushman's, but my nose has been
  frequently admired and envied in the best drawing rooms in New York. But it
  won't be envied any more, I fear&mdash;pitied rather.</p>

  <p>Of course I played the game no more. I was nauseated by pain and the sight
  of blood. My would-be assassin was actually forced to sit down, he was so
  weak from brutal laughter. I wonder if I can ever be an Ensign with a nose
  like this?</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 7th.</b></i> On the way back from a little
  outing the other day my companion, Tim, who in civil life had been a
  barkeeper and a good one at that, ingratiated himself in the good graces of a
  passing automobile party and we consequently were asked in. There were two
  girls, sisters, I fancy, and a father and mother aboard.</p>

  <p>"And where do you come from, young gentlemen?" asked the old man.</p>

  <p>"Me pal comes from San Diego," pipes up my unscrupulous friend, "and my
  home town is San Francisco."</p>

  <p>I knew for a fact that he had never been farther from home than the Polo
  Grounds, and as for me I had only the sketchiest idea of where my home town
  was supposed to be.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Westerners!" exclaimed the old lady. "I come from the West myself. My
  family goes back there every year."</p>

  <p>"Yes," chimed in the girls, "we just love San Diego!"</p>

  <p>"In what section of the town did you live?" asked the gentleman, and my
  friend whom I was inwardly cursing, seeing my perplexity, quickly put in for
  me:</p>

  <p>"Oh, you would never know it, sir," and then lowering his voice in a
  confidential way, he added, "he kept a barroom in the Mexican part of the
  town."</p>

  <p>"A barroom!" exclaimed the old lady. "Fancy that!" She looked at me with
  great, innocent interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued this lost soul, "my father, who is a State senator, sent
  him to boarding school and tried to do everything for him, but he drifted
  back into the old life just as soon as he could. It gets a hold on them, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said the old lady, sadly, "my cook had a son that went the
  same way."</p>

  <p>"He isn't really vicious, though," added my false friend with feigned
  loyalty&mdash;"merely reckless."</p>

  <p>"Well, my poor boy," put in the old gentleman with cheery consideration,
  "I am sure you must find that navy life does you a world of
  good&mdash;regular hours, temperate living and all that."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, sport," says I bitterly, assuming my enforced role, "I
  haven't slit a Greaser's throat since I enlisted."</p>

  <p>"We must all make sacrifices these days," sighed the old lady.</p>

  <p>"And perhaps you will be able to exercise your&mdash;er&mdash;er rather
  robust inclinations on the Germans when you meet them on the high seas,"
  remarked the old man, who evidently thought to comfort me.</p>

  <p>"If I can only keep him out of the brig," said this low-down friend of
  mine, "I think they might make a first-rate mess hand out of him," at which
  remark both of the girls, who up to this moment had been studying me
  silently, exploded into loud peals of mirth and then I knew where I had met
  them before&mdash;at Kitty Van Tassel's coming out party, and I distinctly
  recalled having spilled some punch on the prettier one's white satin
  slipper.</p>

  <p>"We get out here," I said, hoarsely, choking with rage.</p>

  <p>"But!" exclaimed the old lady, "it's the loneliest part of the road."</p>

  <p>"However that may be," I replied with fine firmness, "I must nevertheless
  alight here. I have a great many things to do before I return to camp and
  lonely roads are well suited to my purposes. My homicidal leanings are
  completely over-powering me."</p>

  <p>"Watch him closely," said the old lady to my companion, as the car came to
  a stop.</p>

  <p>"He will have to," I replied grimly, as I prepared to alight.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Mr. Oswald will mix us a cocktail some day," said one of the
  sisters, leaning over the side of the car. "I have heard that he supported
  many bars at one time, but I never knew he really owned one."</p>

  <p>"What," I heard the old lady exclaiming as the car pulled away, "he really
  isn't a bartender at all&mdash;well, fancy that!"</p>

  <p>There were a couple of pairs of rather dusty liberty blues in camp that
  night.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 8th.</b></i> Yesterday mother paid a visit to
  camp and insisted upon me breaking out my hammock in order for her to see if
  I had covers enough.</p>

  <p>"I can never permit you to sleep in that, my dear," she said after
  pounding and prodding it for a few numbers; "never&mdash;and I am sure the
  Commander will agree with me after I have explained to him how delicate you
  have always been."</p>

  <p>Later in the afternoon she became a trifle mollified when I told her that
  the master-at-arms came around every night and distributed extra blankets to
  every one that felt cold. "Be sure to see that he gives you enough
  coverings," she said severely, "or else put him on report," which I
  faithfully promised to do.</p>

  <p>She was greatly delighted with the Y.M.C.A. and the Hostess Committee.
  Here I stood her up for several bricks of ice cream and a large quantity of
  cake. My fourth attempt she refused, however, saying by way of explanation to
  a very pretty girl standing by, "It wouldn't be good for him, my dear; my son
  has always had such a weak stomach. The least little thing upsets
  him."</p><br>

  <p class="caption">She was greatly delighted with the Y.M.C.A.</p><br>

  <p>"I believe you," replied the young lady, sympathetically, as she gazed at
  me. I certainly looked upset at the moment. This was worse than the
  underwear.</p>

  <p>"So that's an Ensign!" she exclaimed later in an obviously disappointed
  tone of voice; "well, I'm not so sure that I want you to become one now." The
  passing ensign couldn't help but hear her, as she had practically screamed in
  his ear. He turned and studied my face carefully. I think he was making sure
  that he could remember it.</p>

  <p>"Now take me to your physician," commanded mother, resolutely. "I want to
  be sure that he sees that you take your spring tonic regularly."</p>

  <p>"Mother," I pleaded, "don't you think it is time you were going? I have a
  private lesson in sale embroidery in ten minutes that I wouldn't miss for the
  world&mdash;the sweetest man teaches it!"</p>

  <p>"Well, under the circumstances I won't keep you," said mother, "but I'll
  write to the doctor just the same."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do," I urged, "send it care of me so that he'll be sure to get
  it."</p>

  <p>Mother is not a restful creature in camp.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 9th.</b></i> "Say, there, you with the nose,"
  cried my P.O. company commander to-day, "are you with us or are you playing a
  little game of your own?"</p>

  <p>I wasn't so very wrong&mdash;just the slight difference between port and
  present arms.</p>

  <p>"With you, heart and soul," I replied, hoping to make a favorable
  impression by a smart retort.</p>

  <p>"That don't work in the manual," he replied; "use your brain and
  ears."</p>

  <p>Unnecessarily rough he was, but I don't know but what he wasn't

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 10th.</b></i> I hear that I am going to be put
  on the mess crew. God pity me, poor wretch! How shall I ever keep my hands
  from becoming red? What a terrible war it is!</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 11th.</b></i> Saw a basket ball game the other
  night. Never knew it was so rough. I used to play it with the girls and we
  had such sport. There seemed to be some reason for it then. There are a
  couple of queer looking brothers on our team who seem to try utterly to
  demolish their opponents. They remind me of a couple of tough gentlemen from
  Scranton I heard about in a story once.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 12th.</b></i> The price of fags (gee! I'm
  getting rough) has gone up again. This war is rapidly cramping my
  style.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 14th.</b></i> I have been too sick at heart to
  write up my diary&mdash;Eli is dead! "Pop," the Jimmy-legs, found the body
  and has been promoted to Chief Master-at-arms. It's an ill wind that blows no
  good. I don't know whether it was because he found Eli or because he runs one
  of the most modernly managed mess halls in camp or because his working
  parties are always well attended that "Pop" received his appointment, but
  whatever it was it does my heart good to see a real seagoing old salt, one of
  our few remaining ex-apprentice boys, receive recognition that is so well
  merited. However, I was on much more intimate terms with Eli when I was over
  in Probation Camp than I was with "Pop." He almost had me in his clutches
  once for late hammocks, me and eight other poor victims I had led into the
  trouble, and he had our wheelbarrows all picked out for us, and a nice large
  pile of sand for us to play with when fate interceded in our behalf. The poor
  man nearly cried out of sheer anguish of soul, and I can't justly blame him.
  It's hard lines to have a nice fat extra duty party go dead on your
  hands.</p>

  <p>But with Eli it was different. When I was a homeless rookie he took me in
  and I fed him&mdash;cigarette butts&mdash;and I'll honestly say that he
  showed more genuine appreciation than many a flapper I have plied with costly
  viands. He was a good goat, Eli. Not a refined goat, to be sure, but a good,
  honest, whole-souled goat just the same. He did his share in policing the
  grounds, never shirked a cigar end or a bit of paper and amused many a mess
  gear line. He was loyal to his friends, tolerant with new recruits and a
  credit to the service in general. Considering the environment in which he
  lived, I think he deported himself with much dignity and moderation. I for
  one shall miss Eli. Some of the happier memories of my rookie days die with
  him. He is survived by numerous dogs.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 25th.</b></i> Yesterday I wandered around
  Probation Camp in a very patronizing manner and finally stopped to shed a
  tear on the humble grave of Eli.</p>

  <p>"Poor sinful goat," I thought sadly, "here you lie at last in your final
  resting place, but your phantom, I wonder, does it go coursing madly down the
  Milky Way, butting the stars aside with its battle-scarred head and sending
  swift gleams of light through the heavens as its hoofs strike against an
  upturned planet? Your horns, are they tipped with fire and your beard
  gloriously aflame, or has the great evil spirit of Wayward Goats descended
  upon you and borne you away to a place where there is never anything to butt
  save unsatisfactorily yielding walls of padded cotton? Many changes have
  taken place, Eli, since you were with us, much adversity has befallen me, but
  the world in the large is very much the same. Bill and Mike have been shipped
  to sea and strange enough to say, old Spike Kelly has made the Quartermasters
  School. I alone of all the gang remain unspoken for&mdash;nobody seems
  anxious to avail themselves of my services. My tapes are dirtier and my white
  hat grows less "sea-going" every day and even you, Eli, are being forgotten.
  The company commander still carols sweetly in the morning about "barrackses"
  and fire "distinguishers," rookies still continue to rook about the camp in
  their timid, mild-eyed way, while week-old sailors with unwashed leggins
  delight their simple souls with cries of 'twenty-one days.' New goats have
  sprung up to take your place in the life of the camp and belittle your past
  achievements, but to me, O unregenerate goat, you shall ever remain a
  refreshing memory. Good butting, O excellent ruminant, wherever thou should
  chance to be. I salute you."</p>

  <p>This soliloquy brought me to the verge of an emotional break-down. I
  departed the spot in silence. On my way back through Probation I chanced upon
  a group of rookies studying for their examinations and was surprised to
  remember how much I had contrived to forget. Nevertheless I stopped one of
  the students and asked him what a "hakamaback" was and found to my relief
  that he didn't know.</p>

  <p>"Back to your manual," said I gloomily, "I fear you will never be a
  sailor."</p>

  <p>Having thus made heavy the heart of another, I continued on my way feeling
  somehow greatly cheered only to find upon entering my barracks that my
  blankets were in the lucky bag. How did I ever forget to place them in my
  hammock? It was a natural omission though, I fancy, for the master-at-arms so
  terrifies me in the morning with his great shouts of "Hit the deck, sailor!
  Shake a leg&mdash;rise an' shine" that I am unnerved for the remainder of the
  day.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 29th.</b></i> Life seems to be composed of just
  one parade after another. I am weary of the plaudits and acclamation of the
  multitude and long for some sequestered spot on a mountain peak in Thibet.
  Every time I see a street I instinctively start to walk down the middle of
  it. Last week I was one of the many thousands of Pelham men who marched along
  Fifth Avenue in the Liberty Loan parade. I thought I was doing particularly
  well and would have made a perfect score if one of my leggins hadn't come off
  right in front of the reviewing stand much to the annoyance of the guy behind
  me because he tripped on it and almost dropped his gun. For the remainder of
  the parade I was subjected to a running fire of abuse that fairly made my
  flesh crawl.</p>

  <p>At the end of the march I ran into a rather nebulous, middle-aged sort of
  a gentleman soldier who was sitting on the curb looking moodily at a manhole
  as if he would like to jump in it.</p>

  <p>"Hello, stranger," says I in a blustery, seafaring voice, "you look as if
  you'd been cursed at about as much as I have. What sort of an outfit do you
  belong to?"</p>

  <p>He scrutinized one of his buttons with great care and then told me all
  about himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm a home guard, you know," he added bitterly, "all we do is to escort
  people. I've escorted the Blue Devils, the Poilus, the Australians, mothers
  of enlisted men, mothers of men who would have enlisted if they could, Boy
  Scouts and loan workers until my dogs are jolly well near broken down on me.
  Golly, I wish I was young enough to enjoy a quiet night's sleep in the
  trenches for a change."</p>

  <p>Later I saw him gloomily surveying the world from the window of a passing
  cab. He was evidently through for the time being at least.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 30th.</b></i> I took my bar-keeping pal home
  over the last week- end liberty. It was a mistake. He admits it himself.
  Mother will never have him in the house again. Mother could never get him in
  the house again. He fears her. The first thing he did was to mix poor dear
  grandfather a drink that caused the old gentleman to forget his game leg
  which had been damaged in battles, ranging anywhere from the Mexican to the
  Spanish wars, according to grandfather's mood at the time he is telling the
  story, but which I believe, according to a private theory of mine, was really
  caught in a folding bed. However it was, grandfather forgot all about this
  leg of his entirely and insisted on dancing with Nora, our new maid. Mother,
  of course, was horrified. But not content with that, this friend of mine
  concocted some strange beverage for the pater which so delighted him that he
  loaned my so-called pal the ten spot I had been intending to borrow. The
  three of them sat up until all hours of the night playing cards and telling
  ribald stories. As mother took me upstairs to bed she gazed down on her
  father-in-law and her husband in the clutches of this demon and remarked
  bitterly to me:</p>

  <p>"Like father, like son," and I knew that she was thoroughly determined to
  make both of them pay dearly for their pleasant interlude. Breakfast the next
  morning was a rather trying ordeal. Grandfather once more resorted to his
  game leg with renewed vigor, referring several times to the defense of the
  Alamo, so I knew he was pretty low in his mind. Father withdrew at the sight
  of bacon. Mother laughed scornfully as he departed. My friend ate a hearty
  breakfast and kept a sort of a happy-go-lucky monologue throughout its entire
  course. I took him out walking afterward and forgot to bring him
  back.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>April 31st.</b></i> Have just come off guard duty and
  feel quite exhausted. The guns are altogether too heavy. I can think of about
  five different things I could remove from them without greatly decreasing
  their utility. The first would be the barrel. The artist who drew the picture
  in the last camp paper of Dawn appearing in the form of a beautiful woman
  must have had more luck than I have ever had. I think he would have been
  closer to the truth if he had put her in a speeding automobile on its way
  home from a road house. It surely is a proof of discipline to hear the
  mocking, silver-toned laughter of women ring out in the night only ten feet
  away and not drop your gun and follow it right through the barbed wire. After
  the war, I am going to buy lots of barbed wire and cut it up into little bits
  just to relieve my feelings.</p>

  <p>Last night I had the fright of my life. Some one was fooling around the
  fence in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm Kaiser William," came the answer in a subdued voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, I wish you'd go away, Kaiser William," said I nervously, "you're
  busting the lights out of rule number six."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asks the voice.</p>

  <p>"Not to commit a nuisance with any one except in a military manner," I
  replied, becoming slightly involved.</p>

  <p>"That's not such a wonderful rule," came back the voice in complaining
  tones. "I could make up a rule better than that."</p>

  <p>"Don't try to to-night," I pleaded.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a moment, then the voice continued seriously, "Say,
  I'm not Kaiser William really. Honest I'm not."</p>

  <p>"Well, who are you?" I asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm Tucks," the voice replied. "Folks call me that because I take so
  many of them in my trousers."</p>

  <p>"Well, Tucks," I replied, "you'd better be moving on. I don't know what
  might happen with this gun. I'm tempted to shoot the cartridge out of it just
  to make it lighter."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can't shoot me," cried Tucks, "I'm crazy. I bet you didn't know
  that, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't sure," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm awfully crazy," continued Tucks, "everybody says so, and I look
  it, too, in the daylight."</p>

  <p>"You must," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, good night," said Tucks in the same subdued voice. "If you find a
  flock of pink Liberty Bonds around here, remember I lost them." He departed
  in the direction of City Island.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 1st.</b></i> I visited the office of the camp
  paper to-day and found it to be an extremely hectic place. In the course of a
  conversation with the Chief I chanced to look up and caught two shining eyes
  staring malevolently at me from a darkened corner of the room. This creature
  blinked at me several times very rapidly, wiggled its mustache and suddenly
  disappeared into the thick shadows.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" I cried, startled.</p>

  <p>"That's our mad photographer," said the Chief. "What do you think of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Do you keep him in there?" I asked, pointing to the coal-black
  cupboard-like room into which this strange creature had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Chief, "and he likes it. Often he stays there for days at
  a time, only coming out for air." At this juncture there came from the dark
  room the sounds of breaking glass, which was immediately followed by strange
  animal-like sounds as the mad photographer burst out of his den and
  proclaimed to all the world that nothing meant very much in his life and that
  it would be absolutely immaterial to him if the paper and its entire staff
  should suddenly be visited with flood, fire and famine. After this gracious
  and purely gratuitous piece of information he again withdrew, but strange
  mutterings still continued to issue forth from his lair. While I was sitting
  in the office the editor happened to drift in from the adjacent room crisply
  attired in a pair of ragged, disreputable trousers and a sleeveless gray
  sweater which was raveling in numerous places. It was the shock of my
  life.</p>

  <p>"Where's our yeoman?" he grumbled, at which the yeoman, who somehow
  reminded me of some character from one of Dickens's novels, edged out of the
  door, but he was too late. Spying him, the editor launched forth on a violent
  denunciation, in which for no particular reason the cartoonist and sporting
  editor joined. There they stood, the three of them, abusing this poor simple
  yeoman in the most unnecessary manner as far as I could make out. Three
  harder cut-throats I have never encountered. While in the office, I came upon
  a rather elderly artist crouched over in a corner writhing as if he was in
  great pain. He was in the throes of composition, I was told, and he looked
  it. Poor wretch, he seemed to have something on his mind. The only man I saw
  who seemed to have anything like a balanced mind was the financial shark, a
  little ferret-eyed, onery-looking cuss whom I wouldn't have trusted out of my
  sight. He was sitting with his nose thrust in some dusty volume totally
  oblivious of the pandemonium that reigned around him. He either has a great
  mind or none at all&mdash;probably the latter. I fear I would never make an
  editor. The atmosphere is simply altogether too strenuous for me.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 4th.</b></i> There seems to be no place in the
  service for me; I cannot decide what rating to select. To be a quartermaster
  one must know how to signal, and signaling always tires my arms. One must
  know how to blow a horrid shrill little whistle in order to become a
  boatswain mate, and my ears could never stand this. To be a yeoman, it is
  necessary to know how to rattle papers in an important manner and disseminate
  misinformation with a straight face, and this I could never do. I fear the
  only thing left for me is to try for a commission. I'm sure I would be a
  valuable addition to any wardroom.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 6th.</b></i> "Man the drags! Hey, there, you
  flannel-footed camel, stop galloping! What are you doing,
  anyway&mdash;playing horses?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous," I cried out, hot with rage and humiliation; "you
  know perfectly well I'm not playing horse. I realize as well as you do that
  this is a serious&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this juncture of my brave retort a gun barrel stove in the back of my
  head, some one kicked me on the shin and in some indescribable manner the
  butt of a rifle became entangled between my feet, and down I went in a cloud
  of dust and oaths. One-fourth of the entire Pelham field artillery passed
  over my body, together with its crew, while through the roar and confusion
  raised by this horrible cataclysm I could hear innumerable C.P.O.'s howling
  and blackguarding me in frenzied tones, and I dimly distinguished their forms
  dancing in rage amid descending billows of dust. The parade ground swirled
  dizzily around me, but I had no desire to arise and begin life anew. It would
  not be worth while. I felt that I had at the most only a short time to live,
  and that that was too long. The world offered nothing but the most horrifying
  possibilities to me. "What is the Biltmore to a man in uniform, anyway?" I
  remember thinking to myself as I lay there with my nose pressed flat to an
  ant hill, "all the best parts of it are arid districts, waste places,
  limitless Saharas to him. Death, where is thy sting?" I continued, as an
  outraged ant assaulted my nose. The world came throbbing back. I felt myself
  being dragged violently away from my resting place. I was choking. Bidding
  farewell to the ants, I prepared myself to swoon when gradually, as if from a
  great distance, I heard the voice of my P.O. He was almost crying.</p>

  <p>"Take him out," he pleaded; "for Gord sake, take him out. He's hurtin' our
  gun."</p><br>

  <p class="caption">One fourth of the entire Pelham field artillery passed
  over my body.</p><br>

  <p>This remark gave me the strength to rise, but not gracefully. My intention
  was to address a few handpicked words to this P.O. of mine, but fortunately
  for my future peace of mind I was beyond utterance. Weakly I tottered in the
  direction of the gun, hoping to support myself upon it.</p>

  <p>"Hey, come away from that gun!" howled the P.O. "Don't let him touch it,
  fellers," he pleaded. "Don't let him even go near it. He'll spoil it. He'll
  completely destroy it."</p>

  <p>"Say, Buddy," said the Chief to me, and how I hated the ignominy of the
  word, "I guess I'll take you out of the game for to-day. I'm responsible for
  Government property, and you are altogether too big a risk."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" I asked, huskily. "Where shall I go?"</p>

  <p>"Do?" he repeated, in a thoughtful voice. "Go? Well, here's where you can
  go," and he told me, "and this is what you can do when you get there," and as
  I departed rather hastily he told me this also. The entire parade ground
  heard him. How shall I ever be able to hold up my head again in Camp? I
  departed the spot, but only under one boiler; however, I made fair speed.
  Like a soldier returning from a week in the trenches, I sought the comfort
  and seclusion of the Y.M.C.A. Here I witnessed a checker contest of a low
  order between two unscrupulous brothers. They had a peculiar technique
  completely their own. It consisted of arts and dodges and an extravagant use
  of those adjectives one is commonly supposed to shun.</p>

  <p>"Say, there's a queen down at the end of the room," one of them would
  suddenly exclaim, and while the other brother was gazing eagerly in that
  direction he would deliberately remove several of his men from the board. But
  the other brother, who was not so balmy as he looked, would occasionally
  discover this slight irregularity and proceed to express his opinion of it by
  word of mouth, which for sheer force of expression was in the nature of a
  revelation to me. It was appalling to sit there and watch those two young
  men, who had evidently at one time come from a good home, sit in God's bright
  sunshine and cheat each other throughout the course of an afternoon and lie
  out of it in the most obvious manner. The game was finally discontinued,
  owing to a shortage of checkermen which they had secreted in their pockets, a
  fact which each one stoutly denied with many weird and rather indelicate
  vows. I left them engaged in the pleasant game of recrimination, which had to
  do with stolen golf balls, the holding out of change and kindred sordid
  subjects. In my weakened condition this display of fraternal depravity so
  offended my instinctive sense of honor that I was forced to retire behind the
  protecting pages of a 1913 issue of "The Farmer's Wife Indispensable
  Companion," where I managed to lose myself for the time in a rather
  complicated exposition of how to tell which chicken laid what egg if any or
  something to that effect, an article that utterly demolished the moral
  character of the average hen, leaving her hardly a leg to roost on.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 8th.</b></i> "Give away," said the coxswain
  to-day, when we were struggling to get our cutter off from the pier, and I
  gave away to such an extent, in fact, that I suddenly found myself balanced
  cleverly on the back of my neck in the bottom of the boat, so that I
  experienced the rather odd sensation of feeling the hot sun on the soles of
  my feet. This procedure, of course, did not go unnoticed. Nothing I do goes
  unnoticed, save the good things. The coxswain made a few comments which
  showed him to be a thoroughly ill-bred person, but further than this I was
  not persecuted. After we had rowed interminable distances through leagues
  upon leagues of doggedly resisting water a man in the bow remarked casually
  that he had several friends in Florida we might call upon if we kept it up a
  little longer, but the coxswain comfortably ensconced upon the hackamatack,
  was so deeply engrossed in the perusal of a vest pocket edition of the
  "Merchant of Venice" that he failed to grasp the full meaning of the remark.
  I lifted my rapidly glazing eyes with no little effort from the keelson and
  discovered to my horror that we had hardly passed more than half a mile of
  shore-line at the most. What we had been doing all the time I was unable to
  figure out. I thought we had been rowing. I could have sworn we had been
  rowing, but apparently we had not. I looked up from my meditation in time to
  catch the ironical gaze of the coxswain upon me, and I involuntarily braced
  myself to the assault.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">The procedure, of course, did not go unnoticed.</p><br>

  <p>"Say, there, sailor," said he, with a slow, unpleasant drawl, "you're not
  rowing; you're weaving. It's fancy work you're doing, blast yer eyes!"</p>

  <p>All who had sufficient strength left in them laughed jeeringly at this
  wise observation, but I retained a dignified silence&mdash;that is, so far as
  a man panting from exhaustion can be silent. At this moment we passed a small
  boat being rowed briskly along by a not unattractive girl.</p>

  <p>"Now, watch her," said the coxswain, helpfully, to me; "study the way that
  poor fragile girl, that mere child, pulls the oars, and try to do
  likewise."</p>

  <p>I observed in shamed silence. My hands ached. A motor boat slid swiftly by
  and I distinctly saw a man drinking beer from the bottle. "Hell isn't dark
  and smoky," thought I to myself; "hell is bright and sunny, and there is lots
  of sparkling water in it and on the sparkling water are innumerable boats and
  in these boats are huddled the poor lost mortals who are forced to listen
  through eternity to the wise cracks of cloven-hoofed, spike-tailed coxswains.
  That's what hell is," thought I, "and I am in my probation period right
  now."</p>

  <p>"Feather your oars!" suddenly screamed our master at the straining
  crew.</p>

  <p>"Feather me eye!" yelled back a courageous Irishman. "What do you think
  these oars are, anyway&mdash;a flock of humming birds? Whoever heard of
  feathering a hundred-ton weight? Feather Pike's Peak, say I; it's just as
  easy."</p>

  <p>Somehow we got back to the pier, but I was almost delirious by this time.
  The last part of the trip was all one drab, dull nightmare to me. This
  evening my hands were so swollen I was forced to the extremity of bribing a
  friend to hold the telephone receiver for me when I called up mother.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Rowing," came my short answer.</p>

  <p>"What a splendid outing!" she exclaimed. "You had such a lovely day for
  it, didn't you, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Hang up that receiver!" I shouted to my friend; "hang it up, or my mother
  shall hear from the lips of her son words she should only hear from her
  husband."</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 9th.</b></i> I am just after having been killed in
  a sham battle, and so consequently I feel rather ghastly to-day. I don't
  exactly know whether I was a Red or a Blue, because I did a deal of fighting
  on both sides, but always with the same result. I was killed instantly and
  completely. People got sick of putting me out of my misery after a while and
  I was allowed to wander around at large in a state of great mystification and
  excitement, shooting my blank bullets into the face of nature in an aimless
  sort of manner whenever the battle began to pall upon me.</p>

  <p>Most of the time I passed pleasantly on the soft, fresh flank of a hill
  where for a while I slept until a cow breathed heavily in my face and
  reminded me that it was war after all. My instructions were to keep away from
  the guns, and get killed as soon as possible. As these instructions were not
  difficult to follow, I carried them out to the letter. I stayed away from the
  guns and I permitted myself to be killed several times in order to make sure
  it would take. After that I became a sort of composite camp follower,
  deserter and straggler.</p>

  <p>In my wandering I chanced upon an ancient enemy of many past
  encounters.</p>

  <p>"Are you Red or Blue?" I asked, preparing to die for the fifth time.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, sarcastically, "I'm what you might call elephant ear
  gray."</p>

  <p>"Are you the guy the reporter for the camp paper was referring to in his
  last story?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "the slandering blackguard."</p>

  <p>"You hit me on the nose with a push-ball," said I.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it again," said he.</p>

  <p>"That reporter, evidently a man of some observation, said you didn't wash
  your neck and that you had the habits of a camel."</p>

  <p>"But I do wash my neck," he said, stubbornly, "and I don't know anything
  about the habits of a camel, but whatever they might happen to be, I haven't
  got 'em."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, as if to myself, "you certainly should wash your neck.
  That's the very least you could do."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you," he cried, desperately, "I keep telling you that I do
  wash my neck. Why do you go on talking about it as if I didn't! I tell you
  now, once for all time, that I do wash my neck, and that ends it. Don't talk
  any more. I want to think."</p>

  <p>We sat in silence for a space, then I remarked casually, almost inaudibly,
  "and you certainly shouldn't have the habits of a camel."</p>

  <p>The depraved creature stirred uneasily. "I ain't got 'em," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good," I cried heartily. "We understand each other perfectly. In the
  future you will try to wash your neck and cease from having the habits of a
  camel. No compromise is necessary. I know you will keep your word."</p>

  <p>"Go away quickly," he gasped, searching around for a stone to hurl at me,
  and discarding several because of their small size. "Go away to somewhere
  else. I'm telling you now, go away or else a special detail will find your
  lifeless body here in the bushes some time to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I've already been thoroughly killed several times to-day," I said,
  putting a tree between us, "but don't forget about the camel, and for
  heaven's sake do try to keep your neck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A stone hit the tree with a resounding crack, and I increased the
  distance.</p>

  <p>"Damn the torpedoes!" I shouted back as I disappeared into the pleasant
  security of the sun-warmed woods.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 11th.</b></i> "What navy do you belong to?" asked
  an Ensign, stopping me to-day, "the Chinese?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask, sir?" I replied, saluting gracefully. "Of course I don't
  belong to the Chinese Navy."</p>

  <p>"What's your rating?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Show girl first class attached to the good ship Biff! Bang! sir," came my
  prompt retort.</p>

  <p>"Well, put a watch mark on your arm, sailor, and put it there pronto, or
  you'll be needing an understudy to pinch hit for you."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact I have never put my watch mark on, for the simple
  reason that I have been rather expecting a rating at any moment, but it seems
  as if my expectations were doomed to disappointment.</p>

  <p>Nothing matters much, anyway, now, however, for I have been selected from
  among all the men in the station to play the part of a Show Girl in the
  coming magnificent Pelham production, "Biff! Bang!" At last I have found the
  occupation to which by training and inclination I am naturally adapted. The
  Grand Moguls that are running this show came around the barracks the other
  day looking for material, and when they gazed upon me I felt sure that their
  search had not been in vain.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you write a 'nut' part for him?" asked one of them of the
  playwright as they surveyed me critically as if I was some rare specimen of
  bug life.</p>

  <p>"That would never do," he answered. "Real 'nuts' can never play the part
  on the stage. You've got to have a man of intelligence."</p>

  <p>"Look here," I broke in. "You've got to stop talking about me before my
  face as if I wasn't really present. Nuts I may be, but I can still understand
  English, even when badly spoken, and resent it. Lay off that stuff or I'll be
  constrained to introduce you to a new brand of 'Biff! Bang!'"</p>

  <p>Saying this, I struck an heroic attitude, but it seemed to produce no
  startling change in their calm, deliberate examination of me.</p>

  <p>"He'll do, I think, as a Show Girl," the dance-master mused dreamily.
  "Like a cabbage, every one of his features is bad, but the whole effect is
  not revolting. Strange, isn't it, how such things happen." At this point the
  musician broke in.</p>

  <p>"He ain't agoing to dance to my music if I know it. He'll ruin it." At
  which remark I executed a few rather simple but nevertheless neat steps I had
  learned at the last charity Bazaar to which I had contributed my services,
  and these few steps were sufficient to close the deal. I was signed up on the
  spot. As they were leaving the barracks one excited young person ran up and
  halted the arrogant Thespians. "If I get the doctor to remove my Adam's
  Apple," he pleaded wistfully, "do you think you could take me on as a
  pony?"</p>

  <p>"No," said one of them, not without a certain show of kindness. "I fear
  not. It would be necessary for him to remove the greater part of your map and
  graft a couple of pounds on to your sadly unendowed limbs."</p>

  <p>From that day on my life has become one of unremitting toil. Together with
  the rest of the Show Girls I vamp and slouch my way around the clock with
  ever increasing seductiveness. We are really doing splendidly. The ponies
  come leaping lightly across the floor waving their freckled, muscular arms
  from side to side and looking very unattractive indeed in their B.V.D.'s,
  high shoes and sock supporters. "I can see it all," says the Director, in an
  enthusiastic voice, and if he can I'll admit he has some robust quality of
  imagination that I fail to possess.</p>

  <p>Us Show Girls, of course, have to be a little more modest than the ponies,
  so we retain our white trousers. These are rolled up, however, in order to
  afford the mosquitoes, who are covering the show most conscientiously, room
  to roost on. And sad to relate, the life is beginning to affect the boys.
  Only yesterday I saw one of our toughest ponies vamping up the aisle of Mess
  Hall No. 2 with his tray held over his head in the manner of a Persian slave
  girl. The Jimmy-legs, witnessing this strange sight, dropped his jaw and
  forgot to lift it up again. "Sweet attar of roses," he muttered. "What ever
  has happened to our poor, long-suffering navy?" At the door of the Mess Hall
  the pony bowed low to the deck and withdrew with a coy backward flirt of his
  foot.</p>

  <p>I can't express in words the remarkable appearance made by some of our
  seagoing chorus girls when they attempt to assume the light and airy graces
  of the real article. Some of the men have so deeply entered into their parts
  that they have attained absolute self-forgetfulness, with the result that
  they leap and preen about in a manner quite startling to the dispassionate
  spectator. My career so far has not been a personal triumph. In the middle of
  a number, the other night, the dancing master clapped his hands violently
  together, a signal he uses when he wants all motion to cease.</p>

  <p>"Take 'em down to the end of the room, boys," he said. "I can tell three
  minutes ahead of time when things are going to go wrong. That man on the end
  didn't have a thought in his head. He would have smeared the entire number."
  I was the man on the end.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 23d.</b></i> This has not been a particularly
  agreeable day, although to a woman no doubt it would have been laden with
  moments of exquisite ecstasy. Feminine apparel for me has lost for ever the
  charm of mystery that formerly touched it with enchantment. There is nothing
  I do not know now. Its innermost secret has been revealed and its revelation
  has brought with it its full burden of woe. All knowledge is pain and vice
  versa. I have always admired women; whether so profoundly as they have
  admired me I know not; however that may be, I have always admired them
  collectively and individually in the past, but after today's experience my
  admiration is tinged with pity. The source of these reflections lies in no
  less an article than a corset. As a Show Girl, it has been my lot to be
  provided with one of these fiendish devices of medieval days. It is too much.
  The corset must go. No woman could have experienced the pain and discomfort I
  have been subjected to this day without feeling entitled to the vote. Yet I
  dare say there are women who would gladly be poured into a new corset every
  day of their lives. They can have mine for the asking. Life at its best
  presents a narrow enough outlook without resorting to cunningly wrought
  devices such as corsets in order further to confine one's point of view or
  abdomen, which amounts to the same thing. The whale is a noble animal, it was
  a very good idea, the whale, and I love every bone in its body, so long as it
  keeps them there. So tightly was my body clutched in the embrace of this
  vicious contraption that I found it impossible to inhale my much needed
  cigarette. The smoke would descend no further than my throat. The rest of me
  was a closed port, a roadway blocked to traffic. I have suffered.</p>

  <p>But there were also other devices, other soft, seductive under strappings.
  I know them all to their last most intimate detail. I feel that now I could
  join a woman's sewing circle and talk with as much authority and wisdom as
  the most veteraned corset wearer present. My views would be radical perhaps
  but at least they would have the virtue of being refreshing.</p>

  <p>However, I can see some good coming out of my unavoidably acquired
  knowledge of female attire. In future days, while my wife is out purchasing
  shirts and neckties for me, I can easily employ my time to advantage in
  shopping around Fifth Avenue in search of the correct thing in lingerie for
  her. It will be a great help to the household and I am sure impress my wife
  with the depth and range of my education, which I will be able to tell her,
  thank God, was innocently acquired.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 28th.</b></i> I am slowly forming back into my
  pristine shape but only after having been freed from bondage for some hours.
  After several more sodas, concoctions which up till recently I have despised
  as injurious, I guess I will have filled out to my usual dimensions around
  the waist line, but when I consider the long days of womanhood stretched out
  before me in the future I will admit it is with a sinking not only of the
  waist, but also of the heart.</p>

  <p>More indignities have been heaped upon me. Why did I ever take up the
  profession of a show girl? To-day I fell into the clutches of the barbers.
  They were not gentle clutches, brutal rather; and such an outspoken lot they
  were at that.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked one of them as I stood rather nervously before him
  with bared chest.</p>

  <p>"Why, that," I replied, a trifle disconcerted, "that's my chest."</p>

  <p>He looked at me for a moment, then smiled a slow, pitying smile. "Hey,
  Tony," he suddenly called to his colleague, "come over here a moment and see
  what this bird claims to be a chest."</p>

  <p>All this yelled in the faces of the entire Biff-Bang company. It was more
  inhuman and debasing than my first physical examination in public. The
  doctors on this occasion, although they had not complimented me, had at least
  been comparatively impersonal in despatching their offices, but these men
  were far from being impersonal. I perceived with horror that it was their
  intention to use my chest as a means of bringing humor into their drab
  existences. Tony came and surveyed me critically.</p>

  <p>"That," he drawled musically, "ees not a chest. That ees the bottom part
  of hees neck."</p>

  <p>"I know it is," replied the other, "but somehow his arms have gotten mixed
  up in the middle of it."</p>

  <p>Tony shrugged his shoulders eloquently. He assumed the appearance of a man
  completely baffled.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, now, young feller," continued my first tormentor, "are you
  serious when you try to tell us that that is your chest?"</p>

  <p>He drew attention to the highly disputed territory by poking me diligently
  with his thumb.</p>

  <p>"That's the part the doctor always listened to whenever I had a cold," I
  replied as indifferently as possible. The man pondered over this for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied at length, "probably the doctor was right, but to the
  impartial observer it would seem to be, as my friend Tony so accurately
  observed, the bottom part of your neck."</p>

  <p>"It really doesn't matter much after all," I replied, hoping to close the
  conversation. "You all were not sent here to establish the location of the
  different parts of my anatomy, anyway."</p>

  <p>The man appeared not to have heard me. "I'd swear," he murmured musingly,
  standing back and regarding me with tilted head, "I'd swear it was his neck
  if it warn't for his arms." He suddenly discontinued his dreamy observations
  and became all business.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he began briskly, "now that we've settled that what do you
  want me to do to it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, shave it, of course," I replied bitterly. "That's what you're here
  for, isn't it? All us Show Girls have got to have our chests shaved."</p>

  <p>"An' after I've shaved your chest, dear," he asked in a soothing voice,
  "what do you want me to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"With what?" I replied, enraged, "with my chest?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered easily, "not your chest, but that one poor little
  pitiful hair that adorns it. Do you want me to send it home to your ma, all
  tied around with a pink ribbon?"</p>

  <p>I saw no reason to reply to this insult, but stood uneasily and tried to
  maintain my dignity while he lathered me with undue elaboration. When it was
  time for him to produce his razor he faltered.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," he said brokenly, "I haven't the heart to cut it down in
  its prime. It looks so lonely and helpless there by itself." He swept his
  razor around several times with a free-handed, blood-curdling swoop of his
  arm. "Well, here goes," he said, shutting his eyes and approaching me. Tony
  turned away as if unable to witness the scene. I was unnerved, but I stood my
  ground. The deed was done and I was at last free to depart. "That's a
  terrible chest for a Show Girl," I heard him to say to Tony as I did
  so.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>May 29th.</b></i> The world has come clattering down
  around my ears and I am buried, crushed and bruised beneath the debris. There
  was a dress rehearsal to-day, and I, from the whole company, was singled out
  for the wrath of the gods.</p>

  <p>"Who is that chorus girl on the end acting frantic?" cried out one of the
  directors in the middle of a number. My name was shouted across the stage
  until it echoed and resounded and came bounding back in my face from every
  corner of the shadow-plunged theater. I knew I was in for it and drew myself
  up majestically although I turned pale under my war paint.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell him he isn't walking on stilts," continued the director, and
  although it was perfectly unnecessary, I was told that and several other
  things with brutal candor. The dance went on but I knew the eyes of the
  director were on me. My legs seemed to lose all proper coordination. My arms
  became unmanageable. I lost step and could not pick it up again, yet, as in a
  nightmare, I struggled on desperately. Suddenly the director clapped his
  hands. The music ceased, and I slowed down to an uneasy shuffle.</p>

  <p>"Sweetheart," said the director, addressing me personally, "you're not
  dancing. You're swimming, that's what you're doing. As a Persian girl you
  would make a first class squaw." He halted for a moment and then bawled out
  in a great voice, "Understudy!" and I was removed from the stage in a
  fainting condition. This evening I was shipped back to camp a thoroughly
  discredited Show Girl. I had labored long in vicious, soul-squelching corsets
  and like Samson been shorn of my locks, and here I am after all my sacrifices
  relegated back to the scrap heap. Why am I always the unfortunate one? I must
  have a private plot in the sky strewn with unlucky stars. Camp routine after
  the free life of the stage is unbearably irksome. My particular jimmy legs
  was so glad to see me back that he almost cried as he thrust a broom and a
  swab into my hands.</p>

  <p>"Bear a hand," he said gleefully, "get to work and stick to it. We're
  short of men," he added, "and there is no end of things for you to do."</p>

  <p>I did them all and he was right. There surely is no end to the things he
  can devise for me to do. I long for the glamour and footlights of the gay
  white way, but I have been cast out and rejected as many a Show Girl has been
  before me.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 1st.</b></i> The morning papers say all sort of
  nice things about Biff-Bang but I can hardly believe them sincere after the
  treatment I received. I know for a fact that the man who took my place was
  knock-kneed and that the rest of his figure could not hold a candle to
  mine.</p>

  <p>I still feel convinced that Biff-Bang lost one of its most prepossessing
  and talented artists when I was so unceremoniously removed from the
  chorus.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 10th.</b></i> I was standing doing harm to no one
  in a vague, rather unfortunate way I have, when all of a sudden, without word
  or warning, a very competent looking sailor seized me by the shoulders and,
  thrusting his face close to mine, cried out:</p>

  <p>"Do you want to make a name for yourself in the service?"</p>

  <p>I left the ground two feet below me in my fright and when I alighted there
  were tears of eagerness in my eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied breathlessly, "oh, sir, yes."</p>

  <p>"Then pick up that," he cried dramatically, pointing to a cigar butt on
  the parade ground. I didn't wait for the laughter. I didn't have to. It was
  forthcoming immediately. Huge peals of it. Sailors are a very low tribe of
  vertebrate. They seem to hang around most of the time waiting for something
  to laugh at&mdash;usually me. It is my belief that I have been the subject of
  more mirth since I came to camp than any other man on the station. Whatever I
  do I seem to do it too much or too little. There even seems to be something
  mirth-provoking in my personal appearance, which I have always regarded
  hitherto not without a certain shade of satisfaction. Only the other day I
  caught the eyes of the gloomiest sailor in camp studying me with a puzzled
  expression. He gazed at me for such a long time that I became quite
  disconcerted. Slowly a smile spread over his face, then a strange, rusty
  laugh forced itself through his lips.</p>

  <p>"Doggone if I can solve it," he chuckled, turning away and shaking his
  head; "it's just simply too much for me."</p>

  <p>He looked back once, clapped his hands over his mouth and proceeded
  merrily on his way. I am glad of course to be able to bring joy into the
  lives of sailors, but I did not enlist for that sole purpose. Returning to
  the cigar butt, however, I was really quite disappointed. I do so want to
  make a name for myself in the service that I would eagerly jump at the chance
  of sailing up the Kiel canal in a Barnegat Sneak Box were it not for the fact
  that sailing always makes me deathly sick. I don't know why it is, but the
  more I have to do with water the more reasons I find for shunning it. The
  cigar butt episode broke my heart though. I was all keyed up for some heroic
  deed&mdash;what an anti-climax! I left the spot in a bitter, humiliated mood.
  There is only one comforting part about the whole affair&mdash;I did not pick
  up that cigar butt. He did, I'll bet, though when nobody was looking. I don't
  know as I blame him&mdash;there were still several healthy drags left in
  it.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 11th.</b></i> This war is going to put a lot of
  Chinamen out of business if it keeps up much longer. The first thing a sailor
  will do after he has been paid off will be to establish a laundry, and he
  won't be a slouch at the business at that. I feel sure that I am qualified
  right now to take in family laundry and before the end of summer I guess I'll
  be able to do fancy work. At present I am what you might call a first class
  laundryman, but I'm not a fancy laundryman yet. Since they've put us in
  whites I go around with the washer-woman's complaint most of the time.
  Terrible shooting pains in my back! My sympathy for the downtrodden is
  increasing by leaps and bounds. I can picture myself without any effort of
  the imagination bending over a tub after the war doing the family washing
  while my wife is out running for alderman or pulling the wires to be
  appointed Commissioner of the Docks. The white clothes situation, however, is
  serious. It seems that every spare moment I have I am either washing or
  thinking of washing or just after having washed, and to one who possesses as
  I do the uncanny faculty of being able to get dirtier in more places in the
  shortest space of time than any ten street children picked at random could
  ever equal, life presents one long vista of soap and suds.</p><br>

  business.</p><br>

  <p>"You boys look so cute in your funny white uniforms," a girl said to me
  the other day. "It must be so jolly wearing them."</p>

  <p>I didn't strike her, for she was easily ten pounds heavier than I was, but
  I made it easily apparent that our relations would never progress further
  than the weather vane. I used to affect white pajamas, the same seeming to
  harmonize with the natural purity of my nature, but after the war I fear I
  shall be forced to discontinue the practise in favor of more lurid attire.
  However, I still believe that a bachelor should never wear anything other
  than white pajamas or at the most lavender, but this of course is merely a
  personal opinion.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 14th.</b></i> I have been hard put to-day. The
  Lord only knows what trials and tribulations will be visited upon me next. At
  present I am quite unnerved. To-day I was initiated into all the horrifying
  secrets and possibilities of the bayonet, European style. Never do I remember
  spending a more unpleasant half an hour. The instructor was a resourceful man
  possessed of a most vivid imagination. Before he had finished with us
  potential delicatessen dealers were lying around as thick as flies. We were
  brushing them off.</p>

  <p>After several hair-raising exhibitions he formed us into two lines facing
  each other and told us to begin.</p>

  <p>"Now lunge," he said, "and look as if you meant business."</p>

  <p>I glanced ingratiatingly across at my adversary. He was simply glaring at
  me. Never have I seen an expression of greater ferocity. It was too much. I
  knew for certain that if he ever lunged at me I'd never live to draw another
  yellow slip.</p>

  <p>"Mister Officer," I gasped, pointing across at this blood-thirsty man,
  "don't you think that he's just a little too close? I'm afraid I might hurt
  him by accident."</p>

  <p>The officer surveyed the situation with a swift, practical eye.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess he can take care of himself all right," he replied. That was
  just what I feared.</p>

  <p>The man smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"But does he know that this is only practise?" I continued. "He certainly
  doesn't look as if he did."</p>

  <p>"That's the way you should look," said the officer, "work your own face up
  a bit. This isn't a vampire scene. Don't look as if you were going to lure
  him. Y'know you're supposed to be angry with your opponent when you meet him
  in battle, quite put out in fact. And furthermore you're supposed to look
  it."</p>

  <p>I regarded my opponent, but only terror was written on my face. Then
  suddenly we lunged and either through fear or mismanagement I succeeded only
  in running my bayonet deep into the ground. In some strange manner the butt
  of the gun jabbed me in the stomach and I was completely winded. My opponent
  was dancing and darting around me like a local but thorough-going lightning
  storm. I abandoned my gun and stood sideways, thus decreasing the possible
  area of danger. Had the exercises continued much longer I would have had a
  spell of something, probably the blind staggers.</p><br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">I stood side-ways, thus decreasing the possible area of
  danger.</p><br>

  <p>"You're not pole vaulting," said the instructor to me, as he returned the
  gun. "In a real show you'd have looked like a pin cushion by this time." I
  felt like one.</p>

  <p>Then it all started over again and this time I thought I was doing a
  little better, when quite unexpectedly the instructor shouted at me.</p>

  <p>"Stop prancing around in that silly manner," he cried, "you're not doing a
  sword dance, sonny."</p>

  <p>"He thinks he's still a show girl," some one chuckled, "he's that
  seductive."</p>

  <p>Mess gear interrupted our happy morning. The sight of a knife fairly
  sickened me.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 24th.</b></i> Last week I caught a
  liberty&mdash;a perfect Forty- three&mdash;and went to spend it with some
  cliff dwelling friends of mine who, heaven help their wretched lot! lived on
  the sixth and top floor of one of those famous New York struggle-ups. Before
  shoving off there was some slight misunderstanding between the inspecting
  officer and myself relative to the exact color of my, broadly speaking,
  Whites.</p>

  <p>"Fall out, there," he said to me. "You can't go out on liberty in
  Blues."</p>

  <p>"But these, sir," I responded huskily, "are not Blues; they're
  Whites."</p>

  <p>"Look like Blues to me," he said skeptically. "Fall out anyway. You're too
  dirty."</p>

  <p>For the first time in my life I said nothing at the right time. I just
  looked at him. There was a dumb misery in my eyes, a mute, humble appeal such
  as is practised with so much success by dogs. He couldn't resist it. Probably
  he was thinking of the days when he, too, stood in line waiting impatiently
  for the final formalities to be run through before the world was his
  again.</p>

  <p>"Turn around," he said brokenly. I did so.</p>

  <p>"Fall in," he ordered, after having made a prolonged inspection of my
  shrinking back. "I guess you'll do, but you are only getting through on a
  technicality&mdash;there's one white spot under your collar."</p>

  <p>Officers are people after all, although sometimes it's hard to realize it.
  This one, in imagination, I anointed with oil and rare perfumes, and costly
  gifts I laid at his feet, while in a glad voice I called down the blessings
  of John Paul Jones upon his excellent head. Thus I departed with my kind and
  never did the odor of gasoline smell sweeter in my nose than did the fumes
  that were being emitted by the impatient flivver that waited without the
  gate. And sweet, too, was the fetid atmosphere of the subway after the clean,
  bracing air of Pelham, sweet was the smell of garlic belonging to a mustache
  that sat beside me, and sweet were the buttery fingers of a small child who
  kept clawing at me while their owner demanded of the whole car if I was a
  "weal mavy sailor boy?" I didn't look it, and I didn't feel it, but I had
  forty-three hours of freedom ahead of me, so what did I care?</p>

  <p>All went well with me until I essayed the six flight climb-up to the cave
  of these cliff-dwelling people, when I found that the one-storied existence I
  had been leading in the Pelham bungalows had completely unfitted me for
  mountain climbing. As I toiled upward I wondered dimly how these people ever
  managed to keep so fat after having mounted to such a great distance for so
  long a time. Somehow they had done it, not only maintained their already
  acquired fat but added greatly thereto. There would be no refreshing cup to
  quaff upon arriving, only water, or at best milk. This I knew and the
  knowledge added pounds to my already heavy feet.</p>

  <p>"My, what a dirty sailor you are, to be sure," they said to me from the
  depth of their plump complacency.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," I gasped, falling into a chair, "I seem to remember having
  heard the same thing once before to-day."</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 25th.</b></i> Neither Saturday nor Sunday was a
  complete success and for a while Saturday afternoon assumed the proportions
  of a disaster. After having rested from my climb, I decided to wash my Whites
  so that I wouldn't be arrested as a deserter or be thrown into the brig upon
  checking in. The fat people on learning of my intentions decided that the
  sight of such labor would tire them beyond endurance, so they departed,
  leaving me in solitary possession of their flat. I thereupon removed my
  jumper, humped my back over the tub, scrubbed industriously until the garment
  was white, then hastened roofwards and arranged it prettily on the line. This
  accomplished, I hurried down, removed my trousers, rehumped my back over the
  tub, scrubbed industriously until the trousers in turn were white and once
  more dashed roofwards. I have always been absent minded, but never to such an
  appalling extent as to appear clad only in my scanty underwear in the midst
  of a mixed throng of ladies, gentlemen and children. This I did. Some
  venturous souls had claimed the roof as their own during my absence so that
  when I sprang from the final step to claim my place in the sun I found myself
  by no means alone. With a cry of horror I leaped to the other side of the
  clothes-line and endeavored to conceal myself behind an old lady's petticoat
  or a lady's old petticoat or something of that nature. Whoever wore the thing
  must have been a very short person indeed, for the garment reached scarcely
  down to my knees, below which my B.V.D.'s fluttered in an intriguing
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Sir," thundered a pompous gentleman, "have you any explanation for your
  surprising conduct?"</p>

  <p>"Several," I replied briskly from behind my only claim on respectability.
  "In the first place, I didn't expect an audience. In the second&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, sir," broke in this heavy person in a quarterdeck voice.
  "Who, may I ask, are you?"</p>

  <p>"You may," I replied. "I'm a God-fearing sailor man who is doing the best
  he can to keep nice and clean in spite of the uncalled for intervention of a
  red-faced oaf of a plumber person who should know better than to stand around
  watching him."</p><br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">I'm a God-fearing sailor man who is<br>
  doing the best he can to keep clean.</p><br>

  <p>"Don't take on so, George," said one of the women whom I suspected of
  edging around in order to get a better view of me, "the poor young man is a
  sailor&mdash;where is your patriotism?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," broke in the other woman, edging around on the other side, "he's
  one of our sailor boys. Treat him nice."</p>

  <p>"Patriotic, I am," roared George wrathfully, "but not to the extent of
  condoning and looking lightly upon such a flagrant breach of decency as this
  semi-nude, so-called sailor has committed in our midst."</p>

  <p>"If you'd give me a couple of Thrift Stamps," I suggested, "I might be
  able to come out from behind this blooming barrage."</p>

  <p>"Shameless," exploded the man.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I replied, "in the olden days it was quite customary for
  young gentlemen and elderly stout ones like yourself, for instance, to drop
  in at the best caves with very much less on than I have without any one
  considering their conduct in any degree irregular. In fact, the ladies of
  this time were no better themselves, it being deemed highly proper for them
  to appear in some small bit of stuff and nobody thought the worst of it at
  all. Take the early days of the fifteenth century B.C.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this point in my eloquent address a young child, who had hitherto
  escaped my attention, took it upon herself to swing on the line with the
  result that it parted with a snap and my last vestige of protection came
  fluttering to the roof. For one tense moment I stood gazing into the dilated
  eyes of those before me. Then with surprising presence of mind, I sprang to a
  ladder that led to the water tank, swarmed up it with the agility of a cat
  and lowered myself with a gasp of despair into the cold, cold water of the
  tank. From this place of security I gazed down on the man who had been
  responsible for my unfortunate plight. I felt myself sinned against, and the
  longer I remained in that water, up to my neck, the more I felt my wrongs. I
  gave voice to them. I said bitter, abusive things to the man.</p>

  <p>"Clear the quarter deck," I shouted, "get aft, or, by gad, I'll come
  fluttering down there on your flat, bald head like a blooming flood. Vamoos,
  hombre, pronto&mdash;plenty quick and take your brood with you." Then I said
  some more things as my father before me had said them, and the man withdrew
  with his women.</p>

  <p>"He's a sailor," he said as he did so. "Hurry, my dears, this is worse
  than nakedness."</p>

  <p>I emerged and sat in a borrowed bathrobe the rest of the evening. The next
  morning my clothes were still damp. Now, that's what I call a stupid way to
  spend a Saturday night on liberty. The fat people enjoyed it.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>June 29th.</b></i> I met a very pleasant dog
  yesterday, whom I called Mr. Fogerty because of his sober countenance and the
  benign but rather puzzled expression in his large, limpid eyes, which were
  almost completely hidden by his bangs. He was evidently a visitor in camp, so
  I took him around and introduced him to the rest of the dogs and several of
  the better sort of goats. In all of these he displayed a friendly but
  dignified interest, seeming to question them on the life of the camp, how
  they liked the Navy and what they thought were the prospects for an early
  peace. He refused to be separated from me, however, and even broke into the
  mess hall, from which he was unceremoniously ejected, but not before he had
  gotten half of my ration. In some strange manner he must have found out from
  one of the other dogs my name and address and exactly where I swung, for in
  the middle of the night I awoke to hear a lonesome whining in the darkness
  beneath my hammock and then the sniff, sniff of an investigating nose. As I
  know how it feels to be lonely in a big black barracks in the dead of night I
  carefully descended to the deck and collected this animal&mdash;it was my old
  friend, Mr. Fogerty, and he was quite overjoyed at having once more found me.
  After licking my face in gratitude he sat back on his haunches and waited for
  me to do something amusing. I didn't have the heart to leave him there in the
  darkness. Dogs have a certain way about them that gets me every time. I
  lifted Mr. Fogerty, a huge hulk of a dog, with much care, and adjusting of
  overlapping paws into my hammock, and received a kiss in the eye for my
  trouble. Then I followed Mr. Fogerty into the hammock and resumed my slumber,
  but not with much comfort. Mr. Fogerty is a large, sprawly dog, who evidently
  has been used to sleeping in vast spaces and who sees no reason for changing
  a lifelong habit. Consequently he considered me in the nature of a piece of
  gratifying upholstery. He slept with his hind legs on my stomach and his
  front paws propped against my chin. When he scratched, as he not infrequently
  did, what I decided must be a flea, his hind leg beat upon the canvas and
  produced a noise not unlike a drum. Thus we slept, but through some
  miscalculation I must have slept over, for it seems that the Master-at-arms,
  a very large and capable Irishman, came and shook my hammock.</p><br>
  <a name="fig22"
        id="fig22"></a>

  <p class="caption">I took him around and introduced him to the rest<br>
  of the dogs and several of the better sort of goats.</p><br>

  <p>"Hit the deck there, sailor," he said, "shake a leg, shake a leg."</p>

  <p>At this point Mr. Fogerty took it upon himself to peer over the side of
  the hammock to see who this disturber of peace and quiet could be. This was
  just a little out of the line of duty for the jimmy legs, and I can't say as
  I blame him for his conduct under rather trying circumstances. Mr. Fogerty
  has a large, shaggy head, not unlike a lion's, and his mouth, too, is quite
  large and contains some very long and sharp teeth. It seems that Mr. Fogerty,
  still heavy with slumber, quite naturally yawned into the horrified face of
  the Jimmy-legs, who, mistaking the operation for a hostile demonstration,
  retreated from the barracks with admirable rapidity for one so large, crying
  in a distracted voice as he did so:</p>

  <p>"By the saints, it's a beast he's turned into during the night. Sure, it's
  a visitation of Providence, heaven preserve us."</p>

  <p>It seems I have been washing hammocks ever since. Mr. Fogerty sits around
  and wonders what it's all about. I like Fogerty, but he gets me in trouble,
  and in this I need no help whatsoever.</p><br>

         alt="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">I resumed my slumber, but not with much comfort.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 1st.</b></i> This day I almost succeeded in
  sinking myself for the final count. The fishes around about the environs of
  City Island were disappointed beyond words when I came up for the fourth time
  and stayed up. In my delirium I imagined that school had been let out in
  honor of my reception and that all the pretty little fishes were sticking
  around in expectant groups cheering loudly at the thought of the conclusion
  of their meatless days. Fortunately for the Navy, however, I cheated them and
  saved myself in order to scrub many more hammocks and white clothes, an
  object to which I seem to have dedicated my life.</p>

  <p>It all come about, as do most drowning parties, in quite an unexpected
  manner. For some reason it had been arranged that I should take a swim over
  at one of the emporiums at City Island, and, as I interposed no objections, I
  accordingly departed with my faithful Mr. Fogerty tumbling along at my heels.
  Since Mr. Fogerty involved me in trouble the other day by barking at the
  Jimmy-legs he has endeavored in all possible ways to make up for his
  thoughtless irregularity. For instance, he met me this morning with an almost
  brand new shoe which in some manner he had managed to pick up in his
  wanderings. It fits perfectly, and if he only succeeds in finding the mate to
  it I shall probably not look for the owner. As a further proof of his good
  will Mr. Fogerty bit, or attempted to bite, a P.O. who spoke to me roughly
  regarding the picturesque way I was holding my gun.</p>

  <p>"Whose dog is that?" demanded the P.O.</p>

  <p>Silence in the ranks. Mr. Fogerty looked defiantly at him for a moment and
  then trotted deliberately over and sat down upon my foot.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so he belongs to you!" continued the P.O. in a threatening voice.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I faltered; "you see, it isn't that way at all. I belong to Mr.
  Fogerty."</p>

  <p>"Who in&mdash;who in&mdash;who is Mr. Fogerty?" shouted the P.O. "And how
  in&mdash;how in&mdash;how did <i>he</i> happen to get into the
  conversation?"</p>

  <p>"Why, this is Mr. Fogerty," I replied; "this dog here, sitting on my
  foot."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that so?" jeered the P.O., a man noted for his quick retorts.
  "Well, you take your silly looking dog away from here and secure him in some
  safe place. He ain't no fit associate for our camp dogs. And, furthermore,"
  he added, "the next time Mr. Fogerty attempts to bite me I'm going to put you
  on report&mdash;savez?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fogerty is almost as much of a comfort in camp as mother.</p>

  <p>Well, that's another something else again and has nothing to do with my
  swim and approximate drowning at City Island. Swimming has always been one of
  my strong points, and I have taken in the past no little pride in my
  appearance, not only in a bathing outfit, but also in the water. However, the
  suit they provided me with on this occasion did not show me up in a very
  alluring light. It was quite large and evidently built according to a model
  of the early Victorian Era. I was swathed in yards of cloth much in the same
  manner as is a very young child. It delighted Mr. Fogerty, who expressed his
  admiration by attaching himself to the lower half of my attire and remaining
  there until I had waded through several colonies of barnacles far out into
  the bay. Bidding farewell to Mr. Fogerty at this point, I gave myself over to
  the joy of the moment and went wallowing along, giving a surprising imitation
  of the famous Australian crawl. Far in the distance I sighted an island, to
  which I decided to swim. This was a very poor decision, indeed, because long
  before I had reached the spot I was in a sinking condition owing to the great
  heaviness of my suit and a tremendous slacking down of lung power. It was too
  late to retreat to the shore; the island was the nearest point, and that
  wasn't near. On I gasped, my mind teeming with cheerless thoughts of the
  ocean's bed waiting to receive me. Just as I was about to shake hands with
  myself for the last time I cleared the water from my eyes and discovered that
  the island though still distant was not altogether impossible. Therewith I
  discarded the top part of my suit and struck out once more. The island was
  now almost within my grasp. Life seemed to be not such a lost cause after
  all. Then suddenly, quite clearly, just as I was about to pull myself up on
  the shore, I saw a woman standing on the bank and heard her shouting in a
  very conventional voice:</p>

  <p>"Private property! Private property!"</p>

  <p>I sank. This was too much. As I came up for the first count, and just
  before I sank back beneath the blue, I had time to hear her repeat:</p>

  <p>"Private property! Please keep off!"</p>

  <p>I went down very quickly this time and very far. When I arose I saw as
  though in a dream another woman standing by the first one and seemingly
  arguing with her.</p>

  <p>"He's drowning!" she said.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I can't help that!" the other one answered. And then in a loud,
  imperious voice:</p>

  <p>"Private property! No visitors allowed!"</p>

  <p>The water closed over my head and stilled her hateful voice.</p>

  <p>"No," she was saying as I came up for the third time; "I can't do it. If I
  make an exception of one I must make an exception of all."</p>

  <p>Although I hated to be rude about it, having always disliked forcing
  myself upon people, I decided on my fourth trip down that unless I wanted to
  be a dead sailor I had better be taking steps. It was almost too late. There
  wasn't enough wind left in me to fatten a small sized bubble.</p>

  <p>"There he is again!" she cried in a petulant voice as I once more
  appeared. "Why doesn't he go away?"</p>

  <p>"He's just about to&mdash;for good!" said the other lady. With a pitiful
  yap I struck out feebly in the general direction of the shore. It wouldn't
  work. My arms refused to move. Then quite suddenly and deliriously I felt two
  soft, cool arms enfold me, and my head sank back on a delicately unholstered
  shoulder. Somehow it reminded me of the old days.</p>

  <p>"Home, James," I murmured, as I was slowly towed to shore. Just before
  closing my eyes I caught a fleeting glimpse of a young lady clad in one of
  the one-piecest one-piece bathing suits I had ever seen. She was bending over
  me sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Private property!" cried my tormentor, shaking a finger at me. "What a
  pity!" I thought as I closed my eyes and drifted off into sweet dreams in
  which Mr. Fogerty, my beautiful rescuer, and myself were dancing
  hand-and-hand on the parade ground to the music of the massed band, much to
  the edification of the entire station assembled in review formation.</p>

  <p>Presently I awoke to the hateful strains of this old hard-shell's
  voice:</p>

  <p>"See what you've done!" she was saying to the young girl. "You've brought
  in a half naked man, and now that he has seen you in a much worse condition
  than he is, we'll have ten thousand sailors swimming out to this island in
  one continuous swarm."</p>

  <p>"Oh, won't that be fun!" cried the girl. And from that time on, in spite
  of the objections of her mother, we were fast friends.</p>

  <p>When I returned to shore it was in a rowboat with this fair young
  creature. The faithful Fogerty was waiting on the beach for me, where, it
  later developed, he had been sleeping quite comfortably on an unknown woman's
  high powered sport hat, as is only reasonable.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 2nd.</b></i> Mother got in again. There seems to
  be no practical way of keeping her out. This time she came breezing in with a
  friend from East Aurora, a large, elderly woman of about one hundred and ten
  summers and an equal number of very hard winters. The first thing mother said
  was to the effect that she was going to see what she could do about getting
  me a rating. She did. The very first officer she saw she sailed up to and
  buttonholed much to my horror.</p>

  <p>"Why can't my boy Oswald have a pretty little eagle on his arm, such as I
  see so many of the young men up here wearing about the camp?"</p>

  <p>The abruptness of this question left the officer momentarily stunned, but
  I will say for him that he rallied quickly and returned a remarkably
  diplomatic reply to the effect that the pretty little eagle, although
  pleasing to gaze upon, was not primarily intended to be so much of a
  decoration as means of identification, and that certain small qualifications
  were required, as a rule, before one was permitted to wear one of the emblems
  in question; qualifications, he hastened to add, which he had not the
  slightest doubt that I failed to possess if I was the true son of my mother,
  but which, owing to fate and circumstances, I had probably been unable to
  exercise. Whereupon he bid her a very courteous good-day, returned my salute,
  and passed on, but not before the very old lady accompanying my mother
  saluted also, raising her hand to her funny bit of a bonnet with unnecessary
  snappiness and snickering in a senile manner. This last episode upset me
  completely, but the old lady was irrepressible. From that time on she
  punctuated her progress through the camp with exaggerated salutes to all the
  officers she encountered on the way. This, of course, was quite a startling
  and undignified performance for one of her years, very embarrassing to me, as
  well as mystifying to the officers, who hardly knew whether to hurl me into
  the brig as vicarious atonement or to rebuke the flighty old creature, on the
  grounds of undue levity. Most of them passed by, however, with averted eyes
  and a discountenanced expression, feeling, I am sure, that I had put her up
  to it. Mother thought it quite amusing, and enjoyed my discomfiture hugely.
  Then for no particular reason she began to garnish her conversation with
  inappropriate seagoing expressions, such as "Pipe down," "Hit the deck,"
  "Avast," and "Hello, Buddy!" Where she ever picked up all this nonsense I am
  at a loss to discover, but she continued to pull it to the bitter end.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Buddy!" was the way she greeted the Jimmy-legs of my barracks
  after I had introduced her to him with much elaboration. This completely
  floored the poor lad, and rendered him inarticulate. He thinks now that I
  come from either a family of thugs or maniacs, probably the latter. I
  succeeded in shaking the old thing for a while, and when I next found her she
  was demonstrating the proper method of washing whites to a group of sailors
  assembled in the wash room of one of our most popular latrines. She was
  heading in the direction of the shower baths when I finally rounded her up.
  She was a game old lady. I'll have to hand her that. Her wildest escapade was
  reserved for the end of her visit, when I took her over to the K. of C. hut,
  and she challenged any sailor present to a game of pool for a quarter a ball.
  When we told her that the sailors in the Navy never gambled she said that she
  was completely off the service, and that she thought it was high time that we
  learned to do something useful instead of singing sentimental songs and
  weaving ourselves into intricate figures. This remark forced us to it, and
  much against our wills we proceeded to show the old lady up at pool. She had
  been bluffing all along, and when it came to a showdown we found that she
  couldn't shoot for shucks. When the news spread around the hut the sailors
  crowded about her thick as thieves, challenging her to play. She was a wild,
  unregenerated old lady, but she was by no means an easy mark, as it later
  developed when she matched them for the winnings, got it all back, and I am
  told by some sailors that she even left the hut a little ahead of the game. I
  don't object to notoriety, but there are numerous ways of winning it that are
  objectionable, and this old lady was one. Mother must have been giddier in
  her youth than I ever imagined.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 3d.</b></i> Yesterday I lost my dog Fogerty and
  didn't find him until late in the afternoon. He was up in front of the First
  Regiment, mustered in with the liberty party. When he discovered my presence
  he looked coldly at me, as if he had never seen me before, so I knew that he
  had a date. He just sat there and shook his bangs over his eyes and tried to
  appear as if he were somewhere else. When the order come to shove off he
  joined the party and trotted off without even looking back, and that was the
  last I saw of him until this morning, when he came drifting in, rather
  unsteadily, and regarded me with a shifty but insulting eye. I am rapidly
  discovering hitherto unsuspected depths of depravity in Mr. Fogerty, which
  leads me to believe that he is almost human.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 4th.</b></i> This has been the doggonest Fourth
  of July I ever spent, and as a result I am in much trouble. All day long I
  have been grooming myself to look spic and span at the review held in honor
  of the Secretary when he opened the new wing to the camp. I missed it. I lost
  completely something in the neighborhood of ten thousand men. It seems hard
  to do, but the fact, the ghastly fact, remains that I did it. When I dashed
  out of the barracks with my newly washed, splendidly seagoing, still damp
  white hat in my hand my company was gone, and the whole camp seemed deserted.
  Far in the distance I heard the music of the band. Fogerty looked inquiringly
  at me and I fled. He fled after me.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">I lost completely something in the neighborhood of 10,000
  men.</p><br>

  <p>"Fogerty," I gasped, "this is a trick I have to pull off alone. You're not
  in on this review, and for God's sake act reasonable."</p>

  <p>I couldn't bear the thought of chasing across the parade ground with that
  simple-looking dog bounding along at my heels. My remark had no effect.
  Fogerty merely threw himself into high, and together we sped in the direction
  of the music. It was too late. Thousands of men were swinging past in review,
  and in all that mass of humanity there was one small vacant place that I was
  supposed to fill. I crouched down behind a tree and observed the scene
  through stricken eyes. How could I possibly have managed to lose nearly ten
  thousand men? It seemed incredible, and I realized then that I alone could
  have accomplished such a feat. And I had been so nice and clean, too, and I
  had worked so hard to be all of those things. I bowed my head in misery, and
  Mr. Fogerty, God bless his dissolute soul, crept up to me and tried to tell
  me it was all right, and didn't matter much anyway. I looked down, and
  discovered that my snow white hat was all muddy. Fogerty sat on it.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 8th.</b></i> As a result of my being scratched
  out of the Independence day review I have been tried out as punishment in all
  sorts of disagreeable positions, all of which I have filled with an
  inefficiency only equaled by the bad temper of my over-lords. Some of these
  tasks, one in particular was of such a ridiculous nature that I refuse to
  enter it into my diary for an unfeeling posterity to jeer at. I am willing to
  state, however, that the accomplishments of Hercules, that redoubtable handy
  man of mythology, were trifling in comparison with mine.</p>

  <p>To begin with, the coal pile is altogether too large and my back is
  altogether too refined. There should be individual coal piles provided for
  temperamental sailors. Small, colorful, appetizingly shaped mounds of nice,
  clean, glistening chunks of coal they should be, and the coal itself could
  easily be made much lighter, approaching if possible the weight of feathers.
  This would be a task any reasonably inclined sailor would attack with relish,
  particularly if his efforts were attended by the strains of some good, snappy
  jazz. However, reality wears a graver face and a sootier one. Long did I
  labor and valiantly but to little effect. More coal fell off of my shovel
  than remained on it. This was due to the unfortunate fact that coal dust
  seems to affect me most unpleasantly, much in the same manner as daisies or
  golden rod affect hay fever sufferers. The result was that every time I had
  my shovel poised in readiness to hurl its burden into space a monolithic
  sneeze overpowered me, shook me to the keel, and all the coal that I had
  trapped with so much patience and cunning fell miserably around my feet, from
  whence it had lately risen. Little things like this become most discouraging
  when strung out for a great period of time. In this manner I sneezed and
  sweated throughout the course of a sweltering afternoon, and just as I was
  about to call it a day along comes an evilly inclined coal wagon and dumps
  practically in my lap one hundred times more coal than I had disturbed in the
  entire course of my labors. On top of this Fogerty, who had been loafing
  around all day with his tongue out disporting himself on the coal pile like a
  dog in the first snow, started a landslide somewhere above and came bearing
  down on me in a cloud of dust. I found myself buried beneath the delighted
  Fogerty and a couple of tons of coal, from which I emerged unbeamingly, but
  not before Mr. Fogerty had addressed his tongue to my blackened face as an
  expression of high good humor.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">Fogerty came bearing down on me in a cloud of
  dust.</p><br>

  <p>"Take me to the brig," I said, walking over to the P.O., "I'm through. You
  can put a service flag on that coal pile for me."</p>

  <p>"What's consuming you, buddy?" asked the P.O. in not an unkindly
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Take me to the brig," I repeated, "it's too much. Here I've been working
  diligently all day to reduce the size of this huge mass, when up comes that
  old wagon and humps its back and belches forth its horrid contents all over
  the place. It's ridiculous. I surrender my shovel."</p>

  <p>"Gord," breathed the P.O., looking at me pityingly, "we don't want to go
  and reduce that coal pile, we want to enlarge it."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" I replied, stunned, "I didn't quite understand. I thought you wanted
  to make it smaller, so I've been trying to shovel it away all afternoon."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't oughter have done that," replied the P.O. as if he were
  talking to an idiot, "I suppose you've been shoveling her down hill all
  day?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that I had.</p>

  <p>"You see," I added engagingly, "I began with trying to shovel her up hill,
  but the old stuff kept on rolling down on me, so I drew the natural
  conclusion that I'd better shovel her down hill. It seemed more reasonable
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Easier," suggested the P.O.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed.</p>

  <p>There was a faraway expression in his eyes when he next spoke. "I'd
  recommend you for an ineptitude discharge," he said, "if it wasn't for the
  fact that I have more consideration for the civilian population. I'd gladly
  put you in the brig for life if I could feel sure you wouldn't injure it in
  some way. The only thing left for me to do is to make you promise that you'll
  keep away from our coal pile and swear never to lay violent hands on it
  again. You'll spoil it."</p>

  <p>I gazed up at the monumental mass of coal rearing itself like a dark-town
  Matterhorn above my head and swore fervently never to molest it again.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your outfit and get washed and tell your P.O. for me that you
  can't come here no more, and," he added, as I was about to depart, "take that
  unusual looking bit of animal life with you&mdash;it's all wrong. Police his
  body or he'll ruin some of your pals' white pants and they wouldn't like that
  at all."</p>

  <p>I feared they wouldn't.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," I replied in a crumpled voice, "Much obliged, sir."</p>

  <p>"Please go away now," he said quietly, "or I think I might do you an
  injury." He was fingering the shovel nervously as he spoke. Thus Fogerty and
  I departed, banished even from our dusky St. Helena.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 9th.</b></i> Working on the theory of opposites,
  I was next placed as a waiter in the Chief Petty Officer's Mess over in the
  First Regiment. I wasn't so good here, it seems. There was something wrong
  with my technique. The coal pile had ruined me for delicate work. I
  continually kept mistaking the plate in my hand for a shovel, a mistake which
  led to disastrous results. I will say this for the chiefs, however&mdash;they
  were as clean-cut, hard-eating a body of men as I have ever met. It was a
  pleasure to feed them, particularly so in the case of one chief, a venerable
  gentleman, who seemed both by his bearing and the number of stripes on his
  sleeve to be the dean of the mess. He ate quietly, composedly and to the
  point, and after I had spilled a couple of plates of rations on several of
  the other chiefs' laps he suggested that I call it a day and be withdrawn in
  favor of one whose services to his country were not so invaluable as mine.
  Appreciating his delicacy I withdrew, but only to be sent out on another job
  that defies description. Even here I quickly demonstrated my unfitness and
  have consequently been incorporated once more into the body of my
  regiment.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 10th.</b></i> I had the most terrible experience
  in mess to-day when a guy having eaten more rapidly than I attempted to take
  my ration. When I told him he shouldn't do it he merely laughed brutally and
  kicked me an awful whack on the shin. This injury, together with the sight of
  witnessing my food about to be crammed down his predatory maw, succeeded in
  bringing all my latent patriotism to the fore and I fell upon him with a
  desperation bred of hunger. We proceeded to mill it up in a rather futile,
  childish manner until the Master-at-arms suggested in a certain way he has
  that we go away to somewhere else. Hereafter if any one asks if I did any
  actual fighting in this war I am going to say, "Yes, I fought like hell many
  hard and long battles in camp for my ration," which will be true.</p>

  <p>"Say, buddy," said my opponent, after we had landed quite violently on the
  exterior of the Mess Hall, "you didn't git no food at all, did yer?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied bitterly; "at all is right."</p>

  <p>He looked at me for a moment in a strange, studying manner, then began
  laughing softly to himself.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what made me do it," he said more to himself than to me. "I
  wasn't hungry no more. I didn't <i>really</i> want it. I wonder what makes a
  guy brutal? Guess he sort of has a feelin' to experiment with himself and
  other folks."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tried that experiment on some one else," I replied, thinking
  tenderly of my shin.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I feel so doggon strong and mean," he continued, "I just can't
  keep from doing things I don't naturally feel like doing. I guess I'm sort of
  an animal."</p>

  <p>"Say," I asked him in surprise, "if you keep talking about yourself that
  way I won't be able to call you all the names I am carefully preparing at
  this moment."</p>

  <p>He peered earnestly down on me for a space.</p>

  <p>"Does my face make you talk that way?" I asked, feeling dimly and
  uncomfortably that it did.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "it's your face, your foolish looking face. I can't
  help feeling sorry for it and your funny empty little belly."</p>

  <p>"You're breaking me down," I answered; "I can't stand kindness."</p>

  <p>"I ain't no bully," he said fiercely, as if he was about to strike me. "I
  ain't no bully," he repeated, "I'll tell you that."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I replied soothingly, keeping on the alert, "you ain't no
  bully."</p>

  <p>Here he took me by the arm and dragged me along with him.</p>

  <p>"Come on, buddy," he said, "I'm going to take you to the canteen and feed
  you. I'm going to do it, I swear to God."</p>

  <p>So he fed me. Stacks and stacks of stuff he forced on me until the flesh
  rebelled, after which he put things in my pockets, repeating every little
  while, "I ain't no bully, I'll tell you that, I ain't no bully." He spent
  most of his money, I reckon, but I did not try to stop him. He wanted to do
  it and I guess it made him feel better. After the orgy I took him around and
  let him pat Mr. Fogerty. He seemed to like this. Fogerty took it in good
  part.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>July 11th.</b></i> There's something about Wednesday
  afternoons that doesn't appeal to me. First they make you go away and dress
  yourself up nice and clean and then they look you over and make you feel
  nearly as childish as you look. Then they put a gun into your hand that is
  much too heavy for comfort and make you do all sorts of ridiculous things
  with this gun, after which you fall in with numerous thousands of other men
  who have been subjected to the same treatment, and together we all go
  trotting past any number of officers, who look you over with uncanny
  earnestness through eyes that seem to perceive the remotest defect with
  fiendish accuracy. Then we all trot home again and call it a review.</p>

  <p>This is all very well for some people, but not for me. I'm a little too
  self-conscious. I have always the feeling that I am the review, that it has
  been staged particularly for my discomforture, and that every officer in camp
  is on the lookout for any slight irregularity in my clothes or conduct. In
  this they have little difficulty. I assist them greatly myself. To-day, for
  instance:</p>

  <p>Item one: Dropped my gun.</p>

  <p>Item two: Talked in ranks. I asked the guy next to me how he would like to
  go to a place and he said that he'd see me there first.</p>

  <p>Item three: Failed to follow the guide.</p>

  <p>Item four: Didn't mark time correctly.</p>

  <p>Item five: Was in step once.</p>

  <p>Now all of these things are trifling in themselves, but taken en mass, as
  it were, it leads up to a sizable display; at least, so I was told in words
  that denied any other interpretation by my P.O. and several pals of his.
  After the review our regimental commander lined us up and addressed us as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"About that review to-day," he began, "it was terrible" (long, dramatic
  pause). "It was probably the worst review I have ever seen (several P.O.'s
  glanced at me reproachfully), not only that," he continued, "but it was the
  worst review that anybody has ever seen. Anybody! (shouted) without
  exception! (shouted) awful review! (pause) Terrible!"</p>

  <p>We steadied in the ranks and waited for our doom.</p>

  <p>"It will never be so again," he continued, "I'll see to that. I'll drill
  ye myself. If you have to get up at four o'clock in the morning to drill in
  order to meet your classes, I'll see that ye do it. Dropping guns! (pause).
  Talking in ranks! (pause). Out-o-step (terrible pause). Marking time wrong.
  Everything wrong! Company commanders, take 'em away."</p>

  <p>We were took.</p>

  <p>"All of those things," said my P.O. in a trembling voice, "you did. All of
  'em. Now the old man's sore on us and he's going to give us hell, and I'm
  going to do the same by you."</p>

  <p>"Shoot, dearie," says I, with the desperate indifference of a man who has
  nothing left to lose, "I wouldn't feel natural if you didn't."</p>

  <p>And in my hammock that night I thought of another thing I might have said
  if it had occurred to me in time. I might have said, "Hell is the only thing
  you know how to give and you're generous with that because it's free."</p>

  <p>But I guess after all it's just as well I didn't.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>August 1st.</b></i> Mr. Fogerty has returned aboard.
  My worst fears are realized. For a long time he has been irritable and
  uncommunicative with me and has indulged in sly, furtive little tricks
  unbecoming to a dog of the service. I have suspected that he was concealing a
  love affair from me. This it appears he has been doing and his guilt is heavy
  upon him. I realize now for the first time and not without a sharp maternal
  pang that he has reached an age at which he must make decisions for himself.
  I can no longer follow him out into the world upon his nocturnal exploits.
  His entire confidence is not mine. I must be content to share a part of his
  heart instead of the whole of it. Like father like son, I suppose. However, I
  see no reason for him to put on such airs. On his return from City Island
  this time he had somehow contrived to get himself completely shaved up to the
  shoulders. The result is startling. Fogerty looks extremely aristocratic but
  a trifle foppish. However, he seems to consider himself the only real
  four-footed dog in camp. This is a trifle boring from a dog who has never
  hesitated to steal from the galley anything that wasn't a permanent fixture.
  I can't help but feel sorry for him though when I see that far-away look in
  his eyes. Sad days I fear are in store for him. Ah, well, we're only young
  once.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>August 3d.</b></i> "Well, now, son," he was saying,
  "mind me when I tell yer that I'm not claiming as to ever have seen a
  mermaid, but what I am saying is this and that is if anybody has ever seen
  one of them things I'm that man. I'm not making no false claims, however,
  none whatsoever."</p>

  <p>I carefully placed my shovel against the wheelbarrow and seating myself
  upon a stump prepared to listen to my companion. He was a chief of many
  cruises and for some unaccountable reason had fixed on me as being a suitable
  recipient for his discourse. One more hash mark on his arm would have made
  him look like a convict. I listened and in the meanwhile many mounds of sand
  urgently in need of shoveling remained undisturbed. Upon this sand I
  occasionally cast a reflective and apprehensive eye. The chief, noticing
  this, nudged me in the ribs with an angular elbow.</p>

  <p>"Don't mind that, sonny," he said, "I'll pump the fear-o'-God into the
  heart of any P.O. what endeavors to disturb you. Trust me."</p>

  <p>I did.</p>

  <p>"Now getting back to this mermaid," he began in a confidential voice,
  "what I say as I didn't claim to have saw. It happened this way and what I'm
  telling you, sonny, is the plain, unvarnished facts of the case, take 'em or
  leave 'em as you will. They happened and I'm here to tell the whole world
  so."</p>

  <p>"I have every confidence in you, chief," I replied mildly.</p>

  <p>"It is well you have," he growled, scanning my face suspiciously. "It's
  well you have, you louse."</p>

  <p>"Why, chief," I exclaimed in an aggrieved voice, "isn't that rather an
  unappetizing word to apply to a fellow creature?"</p>

  <p>"Mayhap, young feller," he replied, "mayhap. I ain't no deep sea
  dictionary diver, I ain't, but all this has got nothing to do with what I was
  about to tell you. It all happened after this manner, neither no more nor no
  less."</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat and gazed with undisguised hostility across the
  parade ground. Thus he began:</p>

  <p>"It was during the summer of 1888, some thirty odd years ago," quoth he.
  "I was a bit young then, but never such a whey face as you, certainly
  not."</p>

  <p>"Positively," said I, in hearty agreement.</p>

  <p>"At that time," he continued, not noticing my remark, "I was resting easy
  on a soft job between cruises as night watchman on one of them P.O. docks at
  Dover. The work warn't hard, but it was hard enough. I would never have taken
  it had it not been for the unpleasant fact that owing to some little trouble
  I had gotten into at one of the pubs my wife was in one of her nasty,
  brow-beating moods. At these times the solitude and the stars together with
  the grateful companionship of a couple of buckets of beer was greatly to be
  preferred to my little old home. So I took the job and accordingly spent my
  nights sitting with my back to a pile, my legs comfortably stretched out
  along the rim of the dock and a bucket of beer within easy reach."</p>

  <p>"Could anything be fairer than that?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said he, and continued. "Well, one night as I was sitting there
  looking down in the water as a man does when his mind is empty and his body
  well disposed, I found myself gazing down into two glowing pools that weren't
  the reflections of stars. Above these two flecks of light was perched a
  battered old leghorn hat after the style affected in the music halls of those
  days. Floating out back of this hat on the water was a long wavery coil of
  filmy hair, the face was shaded, but two long slim arms were thrust out of
  the water toward me, and following these arms down a bit I was shocked and
  surprised to find that further than the hat the young lady below me was
  apparently innocent of garments. Now I believe in going out with the boys
  when the occasion demands and making a bit of a time of it, but my folks have
  always been good, honest church people and believers in good, strong, modest
  clothing and plenty of 'em. I have always followed their example."</p>

  <p>"Reluctantly and at a great distance," said I.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said he and continued. "So when I sees the condition the
  young lady was in I was naturally very much put out and I didn't hesitate
  telling her so.</p>

  <p>"'Go home,' says I, 'and put your clothes on. You ought to be ashamed of
  yourself&mdash;a great big girl like you.'</p>

  <p>"'Aw, pipe down, old grizzle face,' says she; 'wot have you got in the
  bucket?' And if you will believe me she began raising herself out of the
  water. 'Give me some,' says she.</p>

  <p>"'Stop,' I cries out exasperated; 'stop where you are; you've gone far
  enough. For shame.'</p>

  <p>"'I'll come all the way out,' says she, laughing, 'unless you give me some
  of wot you got in that bucket.'</p>

  <p>"'Shame,' I repeated, 'ain't you got no sense of decency?'</p>

  <p>"'None wot so ever,' she replied, 'but I'm awfully thirsty. Gimme a drink
  or out I'll come.'</p>

  <p>"Now you can see for yourself that I couldn't afford to have a woman in
  her get-up sitting around with me on the end of a dock, being married as I
  was and my folks all good honest church folks, and bright moon shining in the
  sky to boot, so I was just naturally forced to give in to the brazen thing
  and reach her down the bucket, a full one at that. It came back empty and she
  was forwarder than ever.</p>

  <p>"'Say,' she cries out, swimming around most exasperatingly, 'you're a nice
  old party. What do your folks know you by?'</p>

  <p>"I told her my name was none of her business and that I was a married man
  and that I wished she'd go away and let me go on with my night watching.</p>

  <p>"'I'm married too,' says she, in a conversational tone, 'to an awful mess.
  You're pretty fuzzy, but I'd swap him for you any day. Come on into the sea
  with me and we'll swim down to Gold Fish Arms and stick around until we get a
  drink. I know lots of the boys down there. There ain't no liquor dealers
  where I come from,' and with this if you will believe me she flips a bucket
  full of water into my lap with the neatest little scale spangled tail you
  ever seen.</p>

  <p>"'No,' says I, 'my mind's made up. I ain't agoing to go swimming around
  with no semi-stewed, altogether nude mermaid. It ain't right. It ain't
  Christian.'</p>

  <p>"'I got a hat,' says she reflectively, 'and I ain't so stewed but wot I
  can't swim. Wot do you think of that hat? One of the boys stole it from his
  old woman and gave it to me. Come on, let's take a swim.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' says I, 'I ain't agoing.'</p>

  <p>"'Just 'cause I ain't all dolled up in a lot of clothes?' says she.</p>

  <p>"'Partly,' says I, 'and partly because you are a mermaid. I ain't agoing
  messing around through the water with no mermaid. I ain't never done it and I
  ain't agoing to begin it now.'</p>

  <p>"'If I get some clothes on and dress all up pretty, will you go swimming
  with me then?' she asks pleadingly.</p>

  <p>"'Well that's another thing,' says I, noncommittal like.</p>

  <p>"'All right,' says she, 'gimme something out of that other bucket and I'll
  go away. Come on, old sweetheart,' and she held up her arms to me.</p>

  <p>"Well, I gave her the bucket and true to form she emptied it. Then she
  began to argue and plead with me until I nearly lost an ear.</p>

  <p>"'No,' I yells at her, 'I ain't agoing to spend the night arguing with a
  drunken mermaid. Go away, now; you said you would.'</p>

  <p>"'All right, old love,' she replies good-naturedly, 'but I'll see you
  again some time. I ain't ever going home again. I hate it down there.' And
  off she swims in an unsteady manner in the direction of the Gold Fish Arms.
  She was singing and shouting something terrible.</p>

  <p class="verse">"'Oh, bury me not on the lonesome prairie<br>
  Where the wild coyotes howl o'er me,'</p>

  <p class="first">was the song she sang and I wondered where she had ever
  picked it up.</p>

  <p>"Well," continued the chief, "to cast a sheep shank in a long line, these
  visits kept up every evening until I was pretty near drove distracted. Along
  she'd come about sun-down and stick around devilin' me and drinking up all my
  grog. After a while she began calling for gin and kept threatening me until I
  just had to satisfy her. She also made me buy her a brush and comb, a mouth
  organ and a pair of spectacles, together with a lot of other stuff on the
  strength of the fact that if I refused she would make a scene. In this way
  that doggon mermaid continually kept me broke, for my wage warn't enough to
  make me heavy and I had my home to support.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you ever go home?' I asked her one night.</p>

  <p>"'No,' she replied, 'I ain't ever going back home. I don't like it down
  there. There ain't no liquor dealers.'</p>

  <p>"'But your husband,' exclaims I. 'What of him?'</p>

  <p>"'I know,' says she, 'but I don't like him and I'm off my baby, too. It
  squints,' says she.</p>

  <p>"'But all babies squint,' says I.</p>

  <p>"'Mine shouldn't,' says she. 'It ain't right.'</p>

  <p>"Then one night an awful thing happened. My wife came down to the dock to
  find out how I spent all my money. It was a bright moon-lit night and this
  lost soul of a mermaid was hanging around, particularly jilled and
  entreating. I was just in the act of passing her down the gin flask and she
  was saying to me, 'Come on down, old love; you know you're crazy about me,'
  when all of a sudden I heard an infuriated shriek behind me and saw my wife
  leaning over the dock shaking an umbrella at this huzzy of a mermaid. Oh,
  son," broke off the Chief, "if you only knew the uncontrolled violence and
  fury of two contending women. Nothing you meet on shipboard will ever equal
  it. I was speechless, rocked in the surf of a tumult of words. And in the
  midst of it all what should happen but the husband of the mermaid pops out of
  the water with a funny little bit of a merbaby in his arms.</p>

  <p>"'Go home at once, sir,' screams my wife, 'and put on your clothes.'</p>

  <p>"'I will,' he shouts back, 'if my wife will come along with me.'</p>

  <p>"He was a weazened up little old man with a crooked back. Not very
  prepossessing. I could hardly blame his wife.</p>

  <p>"'So that bit of stuff is your wife, is it?' cries out my old lady, and
  with that she began telling him her past.</p>

  <p>"'I know it,' says the little old merman at last, almost crying; 'I know
  it, but I ain't got no control over her whatsoever. I've been trying to get
  her to come home for the last fortnight, but she just won't leave off going
  around with the sailors. The whole beach is ashamed of her. It's general talk
  down below. What can I do? The little old coral house is going to wrack and
  ruin and the baby ain't been properly took care of since she left. What am I
  going to do, madam? What am I going to do? I'm well nigh distracted.'</p>

  <p>"But his wife was too taken up with the gin bottle to pay much heed to his
  pitiful words. She just kept flirting around in the water and singing
  snatches of bad sailor songs she'd picked up around the docks.</p>

  <p>"'Take her home,' said my wife, 'take her home, you weakling, by
  force.'</p>

  <p>"'But I can't when she's in this condition. I got a child in my arms.'</p>

  <p>"'Give me the baby,' said my wife, with sudden determination. 'I'll take
  care of it until to-morrow night when you can come back here and get it.'</p>

  <p>"He handed the flopping little thing up to my wife and turned to the
  mermaid.</p>

  <p>"'Lil,' he says to her, holding out his arms to her, 'Lil, will you come
  home?'</p>

  <p>"Lil swims up to him then and takes him by the arm and looks at him for a
  long time.</p>

  <p>"'Kiss me, Archie,' she says suddenly, 'I don't mind if I do,' and
  flipping a couple of pounds of water upon the both of us on the pier, she
  pulls him under the water laughing and that's the last I saw of either of
  them. Now I ain't asaying as I have ever seen a mermaid mind you," continued
  the chief, "but what I do say is that if any man has ever seen one I'm the
  man."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," said I, "and what, chief, became of the
  baby?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the baby," said the chief, thoughtful like; "the baby&mdash;well, you
  see, about that baby&mdash;" he gazed searchingly around the landscape for a
  moment before replying.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the baby," he said suddenly, as if greatly relieved, "well, my wife
  took the baby home and kept it in the bathtub for a couple of days after
  which she returned it in person to its father. She made me give up my job. It
  did squint, though," said the chief, as he got up to go, "ever so
  little."</p>

  <p>I turned to my shovel.</p>

  <p>"But I ain't saying as I have ever seen a mermaid," he said, turning back
  in his tracks, "all I'm saying is that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, Chief," I said wearily, "I fully appreciate your delicacy and
  fairness. You're not the man to make any false claims."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not I," he replied, as he walked slowly away.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>August 5th.</b></i> In order to distract Mr. Fogerty's
  attention from his love affair and in a sort of desperate endeavor to win him
  back to me I took him away on my last liberty with me. Fogerty doesn't come
  under the heading of a lap dog, but through some technical quibble I managed
  to smuggle him into the subway. All he did there was to knock over one
  elderly lady and lick her face effusively when he had gotten her down. This
  resulted in a small but complete panic. For the most part, however, he sat
  quietly on my lap and sniffed at those around him. At last we reached
  Washington Square, whereupon I proceeded to take Mr. Fogerty around and show
  him off to my friends. He was well received, but his heart wasn't with us. It
  was far away in City Island.</p><br>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">For the most part, however,<br>
  he sat quietly on my lap and sniffed.</p><br>

  <p>At one restaurant we ran into a female whose hair was nearly as short as
  Fogerty's. She was holding forth on the Silence of the Soul vs. the Love
  Impulse, the cabbage or some other plant. Fogerty listened to her for a while
  and then bit her. He did it quietly, but I thought it best to take him
  away.</p>

  <p>After supper we went up to another place for coffee, a fine little place
  for sailormen, situated on the south side of the square. Here we were
  received with winning cordiality and Fogerty was given a fried egg, a dish of
  which he is passionately fond. But even here he got into trouble by putting
  one of his great feet through a Ukulele, which isn't such a terrible thing to
  do, except in certain places.</p>

  <p>Getting back to the station was a crisp little affair. Fogerty and myself
  rose at five and went forth to the shuttle. The subway was a madhouse. We
  shuttled ourselves to death. At 5.30 we were at the Times Square end of the
  shuttle, at 5.45 we were at Williams, at 6 o'clock we had somehow managed to
  get ourselves on the east side end of the shuttle, five minutes later we were
  back at Times Square, ten minutes later we were over on the east side once
  more. At 6.15 I lost Fogerty. At 6.25 I was back at Times Square. "Hello,
  buddy," said the guard, "you back again? Here's your dog."</p>

  <p>At 7 o'clock we were at Van Cortlandt Park, at 8 we were at Ninety-sixth
  Street, 9 o'clock found us laboring up to the gate of the camp, with a
  written list of excuses that looked like the schedule of a flourishing
  railroad. It was accepted, much to our surprise.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 7th.</b></i> I have a perfectly splendid idea. Of
  course, like the rest of my ideas it won't work, but it is a perfectly
  splendid idea for all that. I got it while traveling on the ferry boat from
  New York to Staten Island&mdash;the longest sea voyage I have had since I
  joined the Navy. On this trip, strangely thrilling to a sailor in my
  situation, but which was suffered with bored indifference by the amphibious
  commuters that infest this Island in those waters, I saw a number of ships so
  gaudily and at the same time so carelessly painted that any God-fearing
  skipper of the Spanish Main would positively have refused to command. Captain
  Kidd himself would have blushed at the very sight of this ribald fleet and
  turned away with a devout imprecation.</p>

  <p>This was my first experience with camouflage, and it impressed me most
  unfavorably. An ordinary ship on a grumbling ocean is difficult enough as it
  is to establish friendly relations with, but when trigged out in this
  manner&mdash;why serve meals at all, say I. Nevertheless it occurred to me
  that it would not be a bad idea at all to camouflage one's hammock in such a
  manner that it took upon itself the texture and appearance of the bulkhead of
  the barracks in which it was swung. In this manner a sailor could sleep
  undisturbed for three weeks if he so desired (and he does), without ever
  being technically considered a deserter.</p>

  <p>One could elaborate this idea still further and make one's sea bag look
  like a clump of poison ivy, so that no inspecting officer would ever care to
  become intimate with its numerous defects in cleanliness. One might even go
  so far as to camouflage oneself into a writing desk so that when visiting the
  "Y" or the "K-C" and unexpectedly required to sing one would not be forced to
  rise and scream impatiently and threateningly "Dear Mother Mine" or "Break
  the News to Mother." Not that these songs are not things of rare beauty in
  themselves, but after a day on the coal pile one's lungs have been
  sufficiently exercised to warrant relief. This is merely an idea of mine, and
  now that everybody knows about it I guess there isn't much use in going ahead
  with it.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 8th.</b></i> "This guide i-s l-e-f-t!" shouted
  the P.O., and naturally I looked around to see what had become of the poor
  fellow.</p>

  <p>"Keep your head straight. Eyes to the front! Don't move! Whatcha lookin'
  at?"</p>

  <p>"I was looking for the guide that was left," says I timidly. "It seems to
  me that he is always being left."</p>

  <p>"Company dismissed," said the P.O. promptly, showing a wonderful command
  of the situation under rather trying circumstances, for the boo-hoo that went
  up from the men after my remark defied all restraints of discipline.</p>

  <p>"Say, Biltmore," says the P.O. to me a moment later, "I'm going to see if
  I can't get you shipped to Siberia if you pull one of them bum jokes again.
  You understand?"</p>

  <p>"But I wasn't joking," I replied innocently.</p>

  <p>"Aw go on, you sly dog," said he, nudging me in the ribs, and for some
  strange reason he departed in high good humor, leaving me in a greatly
  mystified frame of mind.</p>

  <p>Speaking of getting shipped, I have just written a very sad song in the
  style of the old sentimental ballads of the Spanish war days. It's called
  "The Sailor's Farewell," and I think Polly will like it. I haven't polished
  it up yet, but here it is as it is:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">A sailor to his mother came and said, "Oh, mother dear,<br>
       I got to go away and fight the war.<br>
  So, mother, don't you cry too hard, and don't you have no fear<br>
       When you find that I'm not sticking 'round no more."</p>

  <p class="verse">"My boy," the sweet old lady said, "I hate to see you
  go.<br>
       I've knowed you since when you was but a kid,<br>
  But if the question you should ask, I'll tell the whole world so&mdash;<br>
       It's the only decent thing you ever did."</p>

  <p class="verse">A tear she brushed aside,<br>
  And then she sadly cried:</p>

  <p class="verse">CHORUS</p>

  <p class="verse">"I'm proud my boy's a sailor man what sails upon the
  sea.<br>
       I've always liked him pretty well although he is so dumb.<br>
  For years he's stuck around the house and disappointed me.<br>
       I thought that he was going to be a bum."</p>

  <p class="verse">He took her gently by the hand and kissed her on the
  bean<br>
       And said, "When I'm about to fight the Hun<br>
  You shouldn't talk to me that way; I think it's awfully mean&mdash;<br>
       I ain't agoin' to have a lot of fun."</p>

  <p class="verse">"I know, my child," the mother said. "The parting makes me
  sad,<br>
       But go you must away and fight the war.<br>
  At least you will not live to drink as much as did your dad&mdash;<br>
       So here's your lid, my lad, and there's the door."</p>

  <p class="verse">Then as he turned away<br>
  He heard her softly say:</p>

  <p class="verse">CHORUS</p>

  <p class="verse">"The sailors I have ever loved. I'm glad my lad's a gob,<br>
       Although it seems to me he's much too dumb.<br>
  But after all perhaps he isn't such an awful slob&mdash;<br>
       I always knew that Kaiser was a bum!"</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 9th.</b></i> The best way to make a deserter of a
  man is to give him too much liberty. For the past week I have been getting my
  dog Fogerty on numerous liberty lists when he shouldn't have been there, but
  not contented with that he has taken to going around with a couple of yeomen,
  and the first thing I know he will be getting on a special detail where the
  liberty is soft. I put nothing past that dog since he lost his head to some
  flop-eared huzzy with a black and tan reputation.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 10th.</b></i> All day long and a little longer I
  have been carrying sacks of flour. The next time I see a stalk of wheat I am
  going to snarl at it. This new occupation is a sort of special penance for
  not having my hammock lashed in time. It seems that I have been in the
  service long enough to know how to do the thing right by now, but the seventh
  hitch is a sly little devil and always gets me. I need a longer line or a
  shorter hammock, but the only way out of it that I can see is to get a
  commission and rate a bed.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">I carried all the flour to-day that was raised last<br>
  year in the southern section of the state of Montana.</p><br>

  <p>I carried all the flour to-day that was raised last year in the southern
  section of the State of Montana, and I was carrying it well and cheerfully
  until one of my pet finger nails (the one that the manicure girls in the
  Biltmore used to rave about) thrust itself through the sack and precipitated
  its contents upon myself and the floor. A commissary steward when thoroughly
  aroused is a poisonous member of society. One would have thought that I had
  sunk the great fleet the way this bird went on about one little sack of
  flour.</p>

  <p>"Here Mr. Hoover works hard night and day all winter," he sobs at me, "and
  you go spreading it around as if you were Marie Antoinette."</p>

  <p>I wondered what new scandal he had about Marie Antoinette, but I held my
  peace. My horror was so great that the real color of my face made the flour
  look like a coat of sunburn in comparison.</p>

  <p>"There's enough flour there," he continued reproachfully, pointing to the
  huge mound of stuff in which I stood like a lost explorer on a snow-capped
  mountain peak and wishing heartily that I was one, "there's enough flour," he
  continued, "to keep a chief petty officer in pie for twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"Just about," thought I to myself.</p>

  <p>"Well," he cried irritably, "pick it up. Be quick. Pick it up&mdash;all of
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Pick it up," I replied through a cloud of mist, "you can't pick up flour.
  You can pick up apples and pears and cabbages and cigarette butts for that
  matter, but you can't pick up flour."</p>

  <p>The commissary steward suddenly handed me a piece of paper upon which he
  had been writing frantically.</p>

  <p>"Take this to your P.O.," he said shrilly, "and take yourself along with
  it.</p>

  <p>"A defect in the sack," I gasped, departing.</p>

  <p>"And there's a defect in you," he shouted after me, "your brain is
  exempted."</p>

  <p>"Take this man and kill him if you can find any slight technical excuse
  for it," the note ran, "and if you can't kill him, give him an inaptitude
  discharge with my compliments, and if you are unable to do either of these
  two things, at least keep him away from my outfit. We don't want to see his
  silly face around here any more at all."</p>

  <p>The P.O. read it to me with great delight.</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll have to send you to Siberia after all," he said
  thoughtfully, "only that country is in far too delicate a condition for you
  to meddle with at present. Go away to somewhere where I can't see you," he
  continued bitterly, "for I feel inclined to do you an injury, something
  permanent and serious." I went right away.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 11th.</b></i> Mother has just paid one of her
  belligerent visits to the camp, and as a consequence I am on the point of
  having a flock of brainstorms. Some misguided person had been telling her
  about the Officer Training School up here, and she arrived fired with the
  ambition to enter me in to that institution without further delay. True to
  form, she bounded headlong into the matter without consulting my feelings by
  accosting the very first commissioned officer she met. He happened to be an
  Ensign, but he might as well have been a Vice-Admiral for all Mother
  cared.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, young man," she said to this Ensign, going directly to the
  point, "do you see any reason why my boy Oswald should not go to that place
  where they make all the Ensigns?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the officer firmly, "I do."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do," snapped Mother angrily, "and pray tell me what that reason
  might be?"</p>

  <p>"Your son Oswald," replied the Ensign laconically.</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Mother, "you mean to say that my Oswald is not good
  enough to go to your silly old school?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the Ensign, weakening pitifully before the withering fury of
  an aroused mother, "but you see, my dear madam, he has not a first class
  rating."</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" said Mother.</p>

  <p>"Crossed anchors," replied the Ensign.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," continued Mother, "I think the whole thing is very
  mysterious and silly, and I'm not going to let it stop here. You can trust
  me, Oswald," she went on soothingly. "I am going to see the Commander of the
  station myself. I am going this very instant."</p>

  <p>"But, Mother," I cried in desperation, tossing all consequences to the
  wind, "the 'skipper' isn't on the station to-day. He got a 43-hour liberty. I
  saw him check out of the gate myself."</p>

  <p>For a moment the Ensign's jaw dropped. I watched him anxiously. Then with
  perfect composure he turned to Mother and came through like a little
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," he stated, "your son is right. I heard his name read out
  with the liberty party only a moment ago. He has shoved off by now."</p>

  <p>I could have kissed that Ensign.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure," said Mother, "it's very funny that I can never get to
  the Captain. I shall write him, however."</p>

  <p>"He must have an interesting collection of your letters already," I
  suggested. "They would be interesting to publish in book form."</p>

  <p>"Anyway," continued Mother, apparently not attending to my remark, "I
  think you would look just as well as this young man in one of those nice
  white suits."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, madam," replied the Ensign propitiatingly, "no doubt."</p>

  <p>"Come, Mother," said I, "let's go to the Y.M.C.A. I need something cool to
  steady my nerves."</p>

  <p>"How about your underwear?" said Mother, coming back to her mania, in a
  voice that invited all within earshot who were interested in my underwear to
  draw nigh and attend.</p>

  <p>"Here, eat this ice cream," I put in quickly, almost feeding her. "It's
  melting."</p>

  <p>But Mother was not to be decoyed away from her favorite topic.</p>

  <p>"I must look it over," she continued firmly.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that every eye in the room was calmly penetrating my
  whites and carefully looking over the underwear in which Mother took such an
  exaggerated interest. "Socks!" suddenly exploded Mother. "How are you off for
  socks?"</p>

  <p>"Splendidly," I said in a hoarse voice. A girl behind me snickered.</p>

  <p>"And have you that liniment to rub on your stomach when you have cramps?"
  she went on ruggedly.</p>

  <p>"Enough to last through the Fall season," I replied in a moody voice. I
  didn't tell her that Tim the barkeep had tried to drink it.</p>

  <p>"Polly!" suddenly exclaimed Mother. "Polly! Why, I forgot to tell you that
  she said that she would be up this afternoon. She must be here now."</p>

  <p>The world swam around me. Polly was my favorite sweetie.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mother!" I cried reproachfully, "how could you have forgotten?"</p>

  <p>At that moment I heard a familiar voice issuing from the corner, and
  turning around, I caught sight of the staff reporter of the camp paper, a
  notoriously unscrupulous sailor with predatory proclivities. He had gotten
  Polly in a corner and was chinning the ear off of her. As I drew near I heard
  him saying:</p>

  <p>"Really it's an awful pity, but I distinctly remember him saying that he
  was going away on liberty to-day. He mentioned some girl's name, but it
  didn't sound anything at all like yours."</p>

  <p>Polly looked at him trustfully.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Savanrola," the lying wretch supplied without turning a hair.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Mr. Savanrola, that he has left the station?"</p>

  <p>"Saw him check out with my own eyes," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>I moved nearer, my hands twitching.</p>

  <p>"Now with an honest old seafaring man like myself," he continued, in a
  confidential voice, "it's different. Why, if I should wear all the hash marks
  I rate I'd look like a zebra. So I just don't wear any. You know how it is.
  But when I like a girl I stick to her. Now from the very first moment I laid
  eyes on you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Human endurance could stand no more. I threw myself between them.</p>

  <p>"Why, here's Oswald hisself," exclaimed the reporter with masterfully
  feigned surprise. "However did you get back so soon?"</p>

  <p>"I have never been away anywhere to get back from, and you know it," I
  replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"Strange!" he said, "I could have sworn that I saw you checking out. Can I
  get you some ice cream?" he added smoothly.</p>

  <p>"What on?" I replied bitterly, knowing him always to be broke.</p>

  <p>"Your mother must have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come," said I to Polly, "leave this degraded creature to ply his
  pernicious trade alone. I have some very important words to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Mr. Savanrola," said Polly.</p>

  <p>"Until we meet again," answered the reporter, with the utmost
  confidence.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 12th.</b></i> It's all arranged. Those words I
  had to say to Polly were not spoken in vain. She has promised to be my
  permanent sweetie. Of course, I have had a number of transit sweeties in the
  past, but now I'm going to settle down to one steady, day in and day out
  sweetie. I told Tim, the barkeep, about it last night and all he said
  was:</p>

  <p>"What about all those parties we'd planned to have after we were paid
  off?"</p>

  <p>This sort of set me back for the moment. The spell of Polly's eyes had
  made me forget all about Tim.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tim," I replied, "I'll have to think about that. Come on over to
  the canteen and I'll feed you some of those honest, upstanding sandwiches
  they have over there."</p>

  <p>"Say," says Tim, the carnal beast, forgetting everything at the prospect
  of food, "I feel as if I could cover a flock of them without trying."</p>

  <p>So together Tim and I had a bachelor's dinner over the sandwiches, which
  were worthy of that auspicious occasion.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 17th.</b></i> We were standing on a street corner
  of a neighboring town. The party consisted of Tim the barkeep, the "Spider,"
  an individual who modestly acknowledged credit for having brought relief to
  several over-crowded safes in the good old civilian days; Tony, who delivered
  ice in my district also in those aforementioned days, and myself. These
  gentlemen for some time had been allowing me to exist in peace, and I had
  been showing my gratitude by buying them whatever little dainties they
  desired, but such a comfortable state of affairs could not long continue with
  that bunch. Suddenly, without any previous consultation, as if drawn together
  as it were by some fiendish undercurrent, they decided to make me
  unhappy&mdash;me, the only guy that spoke unbroken English in the crowd. This
  is the way they accomplished their low ends. When the next civilian came
  along they all of them shouted at me in tones that could be heard by all
  passers-by:</p>

  <p>"Here comes a 'ciwilian,' buddy; he'll give you a quarter."</p>

  <p>"Do you need some money, my boy?" said the old gentleman to me in a kindly
  voice.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I stammered, getting red all over, "thank you very much, but I
  really don't need any money."</p>

  <p>Ironical laughter from my friends in the background.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," cries Tim sarcastically, "he don't need no money. Just watch him
  when he sees the color of it."</p>

  <p>"Don't hesitate, my son," continued the kind old man, "if you need
  anything I would be glad to help you out."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I replied, turning away to hide my mortification, "everything
  is all right."</p>

  <p>"Poor but proud," hisses the "Spider." The old gentleman passed on, sorely
  perplexed.</p>

  <p>For some time I was a victim of this crude plot. When I tried to move away
  they followed me around the streets, crying after me:</p>

  <p>"Any 'ciwilian' will give you a quarter. Go on an' ask them."</p>

  <p>Several ladies stopped and asked if they could be of any service to me. I
  assured them that they couldn't, but all the time these low sailors whom I
  had been feeding lavishly kept jeering and intimating that I was fooling and
  would take any amount of money offered me from a dime up. This shower of
  conflicting statements always left the kindhearted people in a confused frame
  of mind and broke me up completely. I had to chase one man all the way down
  the street and hand him back the quarter he had thrust into my hand. My
  friends never forgave me for this.</p>

  <p>At length, tiring of their sport, they desisted and stood gloomily on the
  curb as sailors do, looking idly at nothing.</p>

  <p>"It don't look like we was ever going to get a hitch," said the "Spider,"
  after we had abandonedly offered ourselves to several automobiles.</p>

  <p>At that moment a huge machine rolled heavily by.</p>

  <p>"There goes a piece of junk," said Tim. The lady in the machine must have
  heard him, for the car came to and she motioned for us to get in.</p>

  <p>"Going our way?" she asked, smiling at us.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, lady," replies Tim, elbowing me aside as he climbed aboard.</p>

  <p>"Dust your feet," I whispered to Tony as he was about to climb in.</p>

  <p>"Whatta you mean, dusta my feet?" shouted Tony wrathfully, "you go head
  an' dusta your feet! I look out for my feet all right."</p>

  <p>"What did he want yer to do, Tony?" asked Tim in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>"Dusta my feet," answered Tony, greatly injured.</p>

  <p>"What yer doin', Oswald?" asks Tim sarcastically, "tryin' to drag us
  up?"</p>

  <p>"I only spoke for the best," I answered, sick at heart.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" grated Tim, "guess you think we ain't never rode in one of these
  wealthy wagons before."</p>

  <p>"Arn't you rather young?" asked the lady soothingly of the "Spider," who
  by virtue of his mechanical experience in civil life had been given a first
  class rating, "Arn't you rather young to have so many things on your
  arm?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the "Spider" promptly, "but I kin do a lot of tricks."</p>

  <p>The conversation languished from this point.</p>

  <p>"We always take our boys to dinner, don't we, dear?" said the lady to her
  husband a little later.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear," he answered meekly, just like that.</p>

  <p>Expectant silence from the four of us.</p>

  <p>"Have you boys had dinner?" the lady asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," we cried, with an earnestness that gave the lie to our
  statement, "no dinner!"</p>

  <p>"None at all," added Tim thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>The automobile drew up at a 14k. plate-glass house that fairly made the
  "Spider" itch.</p>

  <p>"Gosh," he whispered to me, looking at the porch, "that wouldn't be hard
  for me."</p>

  <p>During the dinner he kept sort of lifting and weighing the silver and then
  looking at me and winking in an obvious manner.</p>

  <p>"Not many people here to-night," said Tony from behind his plate.</p>

  <p>"Why, there is the usual number," said the husband in surprise, "my wife
  and myself live alone."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Tony, looking around at the tremendous dining hall, "I thought
  this was a restaurant."</p><br>

  <p class="caption">'Oh,' said Tony, 'I thought this was a
  restaurant.'</p><br>

  <p>Tim started laughing then, and he hasn't stopped yet. He's so proud he
  didn't make the mistake himself.</p>

  <p>The "Spider" didn't open his mouth save for the purpose of eating. He told
  me he was afraid his teeth would chatter.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Aug. 20th.</b></i> Got a letter from Polly to-day. She
  says that her finger is just itching for the ring. I told the "Spider" about
  it and he said that he had several unset stones he'd let me have for next to
  nothing. A good burglar is one of the most valuable friends a man can
  possess.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Sept. 3d.</b></i> I had such a set-back to-day. Never
  was I more confounded. This morning I received a notice to report before the
  examining board for a first class rating. Of course I had been expecting some
  slight recognition of my real worth for a long time, but when the blow fell I
  was hardly prepared for it. Hurrying to "My Blue Jacket's Manual," I
  succeeded by the aid of a picture in getting firmly in my mind the port and
  starboard side of a ship and then I presented myself before the
  examiners&mdash;three doughty and unsmiling officers. There were about twelve
  of us up for examination. Seating ourselves before the three gentlemen, we
  gazed upon them with ill-concealed trepidation. One of them called the roll
  in a languid manner, and then without further preliminaries the battle began,
  and I received the first shock of the assault. I don't quite remember the
  question that man asked me, it was all too ghastly at the time, but I think
  it was something like this:</p>

  <p>"What would you do if you were at the wheel in a dense fog and you heard
  three whistles on your port beam, four whistles off the starboard bow, and a
  prolonged toot dead ahead?"</p>

  <p>"I would still remain in a dense fog," I gasped in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Speak up!" snapped the officer.</p>

  <p>"Full speed ahead and jumps," whispered a guy next to me. It sounded
  reasonable. I seized upon it eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I'd put full steam ahead and jump, sir," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" shouted the amazed officer.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," I hastened to assure him, "only profoundly perplexed. I think,
  sir, that I would go into a conference, under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>The officer seemed to be on the verge of a breakdown.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" asked another officer suddenly.</p>

  <p>I told him.</p>

  <p>"Initials?"</p>

  <p>I told him. He looked at the paper for a moment.</p>

  <p>"That explains it," he said with a sigh of relief, "you're not the man.
  There has been some mistake. Orderly, take this man away and bring back the
  right one. Pronto!"</p>

  <p>That Spanish stuff sounds awfully sea-going. I was taken away, but the
  officer had not yet recovered. He regarded me with an expression of profound
  disgust. Anyway I created a sensation.</p><br>

  <p class="caption">'I would still remain in a dense fog,' I gasped in a low
  voice.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Sept. 4th.</b></i> Things have been happening with
  overwhelming rapidity. On the strength of being properly engaged to Polly, my
  permanent sweetie, I went to my Regimental commander this morning and applied
  for a furlough. He regarded me pityingly for a moment and then carefully
  scanned a list of names on the desk before him.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said finally, "but not only am I not able to grant your
  request, but I have the unpleasant duty to inform you that you are a little
  less than forty-eight hours from the vicinity of Ambrose light."</p>

  <p>"Shipped!" I gasped as the world swam around me.</p>

  <p>"Your name is on this list," said the officer not unkindly.</p>

  <p>"Shipped!" I repeated in a dazed voice.</p>

  <p>"It does seem ridiculous, I'll admit," said the officer, smiling, "but you
  never can tell what strange things are going to happen in the Navy. If I were
  in your place I'd take advantage of this head start I have given you and get
  my clothes and sea-bag in some sort of condition. If I remember rightly, you
  have never been able successfully to achieve this since you've been in the
  service."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," I gasped, and bolted. In my excitement I ran violently
  into a flock of ensigns stalking across the parade ground.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be shipped," I cried by way of explanation to one of them as
  he arose wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"You're going to be damned," said he, and I was. Too frantic to write
  more.</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Sept. 5th.</b></i> All preparations have been made.
  Tim, Tony and the Spider are going too. I have just been listening to the
  most disturbing conversation. It all arose from our speculating as to our
  probable destination and the nature of our services. The Master-at-arms, who
  had been sleeping on the hammock rack as only a Master-at-arms can, permitted
  himself to remain awake long enough to join in.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be at all surprised," said he, "if you were shipped to one of
  these new Submarine Provokers."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" I asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's a sort of a dee-coy," said he, stretching his huge hulk, "a
  little, unarmed boat that goes messing around in the ocean until it finds a
  submarine and then it provokes it."</p>

  <p>"How's that?" asked Tim.</p>

  <p>"Why, you see," continued the jimmy-legs, "it just sort of steams back and
  forth in front of the submarine, just steams slowly back and forth in front
  of the submarine until it provokes it."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said I, taking a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he continues cheerfully, "and the more you provoked the submarine
  why the harder it shoots at you, so of course it doesn't notice the real
  Submarine Sinker coming up behind it. See the tactics."</p>

  <p>"Oh," says I, "we just provoke the submarine until it loses its temper and
  the other boat sinks it."</p>

  <p>"That's it," says the jimmy-legs, "you just sort of steam back and forth
  in front of it slowly."</p>

  <p>"How slowly?" asks the Spider.</p>

  <p>"Very," replied the jimmy-legs.</p>

  <p>"No guns at all?" asks Tim.</p>

  <p>"None," says he.</p>

  <p>"A regular little home," suggests Tony.</p>

  <p>"Sure," says the jimmy-legs, "nothing to do at all but steam slowly
  back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't dwell on that point any more!" I cried. "We
  understand it perfectly."</p>

  <p>"A regular lil' home," muttered Tim as he began to stow his bag.</p>

  <p>(Later) I write these lines with horror. Some one has told me that the
  Navy needs Powder tasters, something I'd never heard of before, and that
  perhaps&mdash;that's what we are going to be used for. All you have to do,
  this guy says, is to taste the powder to see if it's damp or dry and if it's
  damp you take it away and bake it. This sounds worse than the Submarine
  Provoker.</p>

  <p>(Still later) Rumor is rife. The latest report is that we are going to be
  Mine Openers.</p>

  <p>"What's a Mine Opener?" I asked my informant.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's a guy," says he, "that picks up the mines floating around his
  boat, but only the German mines of course, and opens them to see if they are
  as dangerous as they look. Some are not half as dangerous as they look," he
  continues easily, "some are not quite so dangerous and of course some are a
  great deal more so. But they are all dangerous enough."</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," I replied, turning away miserably, "a pinwheel is quite
  dangerous enough for me."</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i><b>Sept. 6th.</b></i> This is being written from the
  gate. My bag and hammock are beside me. Tim lashed them together for me so
  they wouldn't come undone. We are waiting for the truck. Tony in his
  excitable way wants to kiss the guard good-by. The guard doesn't want him to.
  My last moments at Pelham have been hectic. The doctor said I looked one
  hundred per cent better than when I came in, but that wasn't enough. If you
  didn't look at me very closely you wouldn't know that I was such an awful
  dub. This is progress at any rate. The telephone wires between mother's house
  and the camp were dripping wet with tears when I phoned her that I was being
  shipped. However, she braced up and said she was proud of me and said she
  hoped I'd tell the captain good-by and thank him for all he has done. I
  assured her I would do this, or at least leave a note. Polly was a trump. The
  Spider talked to her and said that he was going to save the best uncut stone
  for her that he had ever bitten out of a ring. The Spider has been very
  valuable to us all. He seems to have the uncanny faculty of being able to
  take the cloth straps off other people's clothes right before their eyes.
  Consequently we are well supplied. At present he's looking at the handle of
  the gate in a musing way. I think he would like to have it as a souvenir.
  Here comes the truck. Pelham is about to lose its most useless recruit. I
  must tuck these priceless pages in my money belt. Wish I had a picture of
  Polly. Well, here's to the High Adventure, but there's something about that
  Submarine Provoker I can't quite get used to. It seems just a trifle one
  sided. However, that is in the lap of the gods. Instead of a camp I will soon
  have the vast expanses of the ocean in which to demonstrate my tremendous
  inability to emulate the example of one John Paul Jones.</p>

  <p>"Bear a hand there, buddy," the P.O. has just cried at me.</p>

  <p>"Buddy" I came in and "buddy" I go out. We're off! I can dimly distinguish
  Mr. Fogerty, that unscrupulous dog that abandoned my bed and board for a
  couple of influential yeomen. Farewell, Fogerty, may your evil ways never
  bring you to grief. I do wish I had a picture of my Sweetie.</p><br>
