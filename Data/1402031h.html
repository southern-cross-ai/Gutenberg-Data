  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; HAIL HAPPY MORN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE awoke with a smile. She had slept well; her
  digestion was good&mdash;her conscience clear; and she had not an enemy in
  the world.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to warn her that, within the next hour, she would be
  selected as a victim to be murdered.</p>

  <p>As she threw aside the sheets and sat up in bed, she looked beautiful.
  Just as every dog has his day, every woman has her hour. Since Miss
  Loveapple's dress allowance was shaved to the limit, she triumphed when she
  was in undress.</p>

  <p>Her low sleeveless nightdress revealed the whiteness of her skin which had
  not been exposed to the sun. Her fair hair fell over her shoulders in thick
  plaits. As she stretched out her arms in a yawn, she seemed to be welcoming
  the gift of life.</p>

  <p>It was a blue windy day in late summer. The sun shone brightly upon her
  toilet table, striking through the cut-glass trinket set in rainbow gleams.
  She could hear the welcome rattle of china which told her that the maid was
  mounting the stairs with her early tea and the <i>Times.</i></p>

  <p>Birds were singing in the beech-tree which shaded her window, as though to
  celebrate good news. It had come, the night before, by the last post, in a
  letter from a London house agent. He had told her of an unexpected chance to
  let her town house, which would enable her to take a rare holiday abroad.</p>

  <p>'Switzerland,' she said aloud. <i>'Mountains.</i> You lucky me.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple believed in her luck. She was positive that Providence had
  drawn up a schedule of beneficent events for her special benefit. If any
  sceptic doubted that she was under the direct protection of an unseen Patron,
  she could offer proof of her claim.</p>

  <p>To begin with, out of millions of hopeful gamblers, she, alone, was chosen
  to draw a certain horse in an Irish Sweep and consequently to realise the
  supreme ambition of her life.</p>

  <p>In addition to this spectacular slice of good fortune, she could produce a
  long list of minor examples of her luck. Royalty died after she had bought a
  black hat, to justify an extravagance. On the nerve-racking occasion when she
  had forgotten to provide cakes for her At Home day, it rained heavily,
  spoiling the hay harvest, but keeping every visitor away.</p>

  <p>Little things like that.</p>

  <p>Each year, when her vegetable marrows or her gladioli received the coveted
  blue ticket&mdash;First Prize&mdash;at the local flower show, she would
  inhale the hot mashed-grass and fruit-laden atmosphere of the tent, as though
  it were incense compounded for her.</p>

  <p><i>'My</i> luck again,' she would declare to her disappointed competitors.
  'Not your fault. Too bad&mdash;when you tried so hard.'</p>

  <p>And then her hearty laughter would ring out, for she was genuine rather
  than tactful.</p>

  <p>She was fortunate even over the circumstances in which she was orphaned.
  Her parents thoughtfully went on living until she was twenty-one and had
  finished her education and received proper dental attention. She was
  therefore spared the restrictions imposed upon a minor when they both died of
  epidemic influenza, just as the Local Authorities had passed the plans of a
  new by-pass road.</p>

  <p>As these involved the sacrifice of the old family home, she received, in
  compensation, a sum higher than she could have hoped to get had the property
  come into the open market.</p>

  <p>She was on the fringe of the leisured class and had a small private
  income; so she bought a well-built and comfortable residence&mdash;Pond
  House&mdash;which was too large and ambitious for her needs, and settled down
  to life in a select residential village in Kent.</p>

  <p>Soon she was accepted as a fixture, together with her maid, her cat, her
  dog and everything that was hers. She was popular, for she entered into the
  social spirit of the community; and although she was younger than the
  majority of the residents, gardening and housework gave her the exercise she
  might have missed.</p>

  <p>Yet, while she was friendly to all, she was intimate with none. In spite
  of her breezy good-nature, no one asked her personal questions, or called her
  by her Christian name. It was doubtful whether any one knew it, for she
  remained Miss Loveapple, of the Pond House.</p>

  <p>On the sole occasion when she burst her sheath of reserve, it was a
  voluntary impulse. The revelation took place on a warm, wild All Hallows
  E'en, when a few ladies came to tea with her. Among them was a visitor from
  London, who brought with her a passport to popularity&mdash;a planchette.</p>

  <p>She was a dark, skinny woman with the remnants of beauty and a suggestion
  of parched passion still lingering in her eyes. She wore an artistic gown of
  nasturtium-hued velvet and a long string of amber beads. Her personality was
  magnetic, so that the other women were excited to confidences as they sat in
  the firelight.</p>

  <p>The windows of the drawing-room were open to the blue October twilight.
  Fallen beech-leaves rustled as the wind whirled them over the lawn, covering
  the violet-border. Witches and wonders were abroad.</p>

  <p>'Ask the thingummy if I will get married,' invited a masculine-looking
  woman wistfully.</p>

  <p>The planchette, although plainly anxious to please, had its record for
  accurate prediction to consider. It hesitated for a little time before it
  advised her 'not to give up hope.'</p>

  <p>The inquirer, whose name was Miss Pitt, laughed in proof of sporting
  spirit.</p>

  <p>'Optimistic beggar,' she said. 'But tactless. The standard of face value
  in the Spirit World seems much the same as ours.'</p>

  <p>It was then that Miss Loveapple asked her question. 'I don't believe in
  it,' she declared positively. 'But&mdash;shall I get my wish?'</p>

  <p>The London lady looked at her fine legs&mdash;generously displayed in the
  firelight&mdash;her admirable colouring and the firm moulding of her face.
  When she attempted to convey her own impression to the super-sensitive
  planchette, it proved instantly responsive.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' it wrote firmly. Taking a chance, it added: 'Soon.'</p>

  <p>'Wish I could bank on that,' said Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'Someone you know, or still a stranger?' hinted the London lady.</p>

  <p>'My wish?' Miss Loveapple laughed heartily. 'It isn't a husband...No. I
  want to have three houses. One town, one country and one seaside.'</p>

  <p>As the others stared at her, she spoke breathlessly in her excitement.</p>

  <p>'I can't explain it, but it's been my great ambition ever since I can
  remember. Mother used to tell me about the Royal residences, so perhaps they
  set me going. Do you know I was furious when I heard that the family had
  given up Osborne House. Somehow it seemed to break the sequence, like losing
  a quin or quad...If ever I get hold of a lump sum, I shall have my three
  houses...Sounds mad, doesn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Merely border-line,' said Miss Pitt generously.</p>

  <p>All Hallows E'en...The wind blew down the chimney and burst through the
  window, in gusts of moist earthy air, faintly perfumed with violets. A slip
  of a moon&mdash;panic-stricken&mdash;dodged wildly amid the celestial traffic
  of racing clouds. Spirits drifted like mist from opening graves. The living
  mingled with the dead...</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards, Miss Loveapple drew her horse in the Sweep. After her
  windfall had been duly pared, she received the sum of four thousand odd
  pounds. This was promptly put back into circulation by her purchase of two
  more houses&mdash;one in London and a bungalow on the south coast.</p>

  <p>While her action was locally criticised, no one was authorised to offer
  advice. Only her lawyer hinted at the disadvantages.</p>

  <p>'This property will prove a white elephant. Besides Rates, Insurance and
  upkeep, you have all these monthly instalments to pay on your furniture. You
  will be definitely crippled.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Miss Loveapple, 'my income will be as much as it is now. I've
  figured it all out. But I shall not cut my Charity list. That might be
  unlucky. My only worry is whether I am anti-social, having all these empty
  rooms when people are overcrowded in slums.'</p>

  <p>Apparently she came to some working agreement with her conscience, for her
  three houses made her completely happy. She was now free from the
  restrictions of environment. Whenever she was bored with the landscape, she
  could exchange it for the spectacle of waves rolling over the beach. If she
  grew tired of looking at the wallpaper in her London bedroom, she had only to
  return to the Pond House.</p>

  <p>But far stronger than the satisfaction obtained by scenic change, was the
  inflation of her sense of ownership. Whenever she moved, she opened her own
  front door&mdash;trod on her own carpet&mdash;broke her own china. The
  knowledge filled her with a consciousness of dormant power and placed her in
  the small company of maiden queens, dictators and hospital matrons.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it endowed her with definite spinster status. Although
  the news of her engagement would create no real surprise&mdash;since she was
  of eligible age&mdash;no one in the village expected her to get married.</p>

  <p>On the day when she was chosen for future newspaper
  publicity&mdash;consequent to a nasty experience in order to qualify as 'the
  victim'&mdash;Miss Loveapple was still on the right side of thirty. Those
  whose taste had not been impaired by the rationed beauty of the Screen would
  have considered her attractive. Fair-haired, with good features and
  colouring, she could have posed for a poster of a Britannia who had dieted
  sufficiently to compromise with modern dress.</p>

  <p>On this special morning, after she had reminded herself of the luck of the
  London offer, she went over the list of her static blessings.</p>

  <p>'I am well and strong. I don't owe a cent. The sun is shining. And I have
  my three houses.'</p>

  <p>On the chair beside her, the blue Persian cat, David, lay asleep in his
  basket, clasping his Woolworth furry toy in his great paws. He was not a year
  old, but was so enormous that he resembled a lion-cub, while spoiling had
  kept him in the kitten class.</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple beamed maternally at him, the maid entered the room,
  followed by the Aberdeen terrier, Scottie. Elsie was about the same age as
  her mistress, but she looked older. She was supposed to be delicate, so she
  did all the lady-like jobs&mdash;cleaning silver and arranging
  flowers&mdash;while Miss Loveapple scrubbed and polished.</p>

  <p>'Good-morning madam,' she said, speaking in a low, muffled voice. 'I hope
  you slept well. Here's your young gentleman come to see you.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple assisted Scottie to scramble onto the low divan-bed before
  she spoke.</p>

  <p>'I am going to London to-morrow, Elsie.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, madam.'</p>

  <p>Elsie laid down the tray carefully on the bed-table, poured out a cup of
  tea, placed a cigarette between her mistress' lips and struck a match to
  light it. Then she took David from his basket and cuddled him so that his
  great sleepy head drooped on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>'David says,' she remarked, speaking in a loud, coarse voice to prove that
  she had assumed David's identity, 'David says he doesn't want his mistress to
  go away from the nice cool country. He says it doesn't make sense to go up to
  that blinking hot London.'</p>

  <p>'Then you can tell David,' said Miss Loveapple, 'that if his mistress
  doesn't snap at her chance to make some money, there might be no cool country
  for him and no nice Elsie either.'</p>

  <p>Elsie still looked resentful as she nursed the cat in silence while her
  mistress fed Scottie with biscuits.</p>

  <p>Presently Miss Loveapple asked her maid a direct question.</p>

  <p>'What have you got against London, Elsie?'</p>

  <p>Elsie's pale face grew red. 'Because&mdash;Oh, madam, I always feel it's
  unlucky.'</p>

  <p><i>'Unlucky?'</i> Miss Loveapple's voice was sharp. 'Why?'</p>

  <p>'I mean&mdash;if you'll excuse the liberty&mdash;it was coming the way it
  did, with gambling and breaking the law.'</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of that household that Elsie should refer to luck.
  But the fact remained that if Miss Loveapple had not acquired a London
  address, at that moment she would have been secure in her Zone of Safety.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; A VACUUM-CLEANER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the early hours, Miss Loveapple never forgot that she
  was mistress of three houses. Later on, she might become supplementary Staff
  and cheerfully do the heavier work for which Elsie was less adapted by
  nature; but she always made her toilet at leisure and breakfasted in
  dignity.</p>

  <p>When she came down the shallow stairs, she wore a full-skirted house-coat,
  pale yellow in colour and patterned with brilliant flowers. It enhanced her
  natural opulence and suggested prosperity allied with bounty. As the
  sun&mdash;shining through the window behind her&mdash;gilded her hair to the
  semblance of a halo, she might have been a seasonal goddess, bearing her
  largesse of floral trophies, but also open to a deal with the market
  gardener.</p>

  <p>As usual, she paused on the half-way landing, in order to appreciate the
  beauty of the property to which she was most attached. Although it had cost
  more to furnish her London house, she had sunk most money in the Pond House,
  by installing central heating and remaking the garden.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant Georgian building, panelled in white wood and spaciously
  but wastefully planned, with broad landings and superfluous steps. There were
  only two reception-rooms and three bedrooms, but all were large and finely
  proportioned. None of her houses contained an official maid's-room to
  mitigate her standard of perfection. She and Elsie chose their
  sleeping-quarters&mdash;and changed them again&mdash;according to season and
  caprice.</p>

  <p>Everything looked especially pleasant that sunny morning. The
  parquet-flooring of the hall advertised her own 'elbow grease.' A vase of
  second-crop pale-blue delphiniums was reflected in a mirror on the wall.
  Humming a tuneless melody, Miss Love-apple strolled into the dining-room,
  which, owing to its superior dimensions&mdash;was also the living-room.</p>

  <p>The drawing-room looked out on to the front lawn, which was shaded with
  beech-trees. Here there were only a few flowers&mdash;violets under the
  windows and bulbs planted in the grass. The dining-room, however, ran the
  entire length of the house and had windows at either end.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the general colour scheme, its furnishings were white,
  relieved with pale green&mdash;an extravagant choice which was criticised
  locally. It had vindicated her by remaining fresh and clean, although even
  she attributed this to her own labour, rather than luck.</p>

  <p>As she crossed to the table, where her breakfast was keeping hot in a
  chafing-dish, she stared approvingly at the carpet.</p>

  <p>'It certainly paid me to get a vacuum,' she reflected. 'I ought to have
  one in London, too. If I budget strictly over my holiday, perhaps the rent
  will run to one.'</p>

  <p>She cut a piece of bread and threw out crumbs for the birds on the front
  lawn before she walked to the back windows, to admire the garden. She had
  transformed it from a gloomy wilderness to its former old-world charm. The
  pond&mdash;which lent its name to the house&mdash;had degenerated to a
  stagnant pool, enclosed with a low railing and shadowed by willow-bushes.
  Advised by the local builder, and even doing some of the work herself, the
  hollow had been filled in and the water enclosed in sunken shallow tanks
  planted with lily-pads. Here, too, was her herb-garden, her famous
  rose-patch, her perennial-border and the vegetables which won so many
  prizes.</p>

  <p>As she gazed through the window, she sniffed the appetising odour of bacon
  which Elsie was frying for her own breakfast. The maid was unable to share
  her mistress' grilled kidneys, owing to a dislike of 'insides'&mdash;a
  disability which Miss Loveapple quoted with a queer pride as proof of Elsie's
  refinement.</p>

  <p>Reminded of her appetite, she sat down at the table and made a large meal,
  beginning with cereal and ending with toast and honey. When she had finished,
  she lit a cigarette...</p>

  <p>By a strange coincidence, her action synchronized with that of a young man
  who lay in bed in a darkish London flat. He drained his cracked cup and began
  to smoke as a prelude to business.</p>

  <p>His appearance was typical of the average young man who recognises the
  value of a good appearance and has conformed to the rules. His voice had the
  clipped Public School accent&mdash;which can be imitated by any one with an
  ear for vowels and&mdash;when dressed&mdash;he wore an old school tie, such
  as can be acquired at its source, or bought in a shop.</p>

  <p>His teeth were good, his hair well brushed, his smile pleasant. Certainly
  his face betrayed nothing of the dark intention in his heart as he stretched
  out his arm for the Telephone Directory, which lay on the battered bamboo
  table beside his bed.</p>

  <p>It was the red-covered volume and it opened at the 'L' section. Flicking
  over the pages with fingers which had been recently manicured, he skimmed
  through the legion of 'Longs.' Occasionally he paused to note a name and then
  to reject it, but his selections were not so casual as they appeared.
  Underneath this weeding-out process was a definite purpose.</p>

  <p>Although his motive was entirely impersonal, and remote from malevolence,
  the lady of his choice had to possess certain qualifications before he could
  be definitely interested. She had to be not only a spinster or widow, but
  unprotected by any male relative. She had to be of sufficient importance to
  invite a visit from a burglar, yet not so wealthy as to keep an inconvenient
  staff of servants. It was essential, too, that she lived in a select but
  unfashionable locality which was discreetly lit and not over-patrolled by
  policemen.</p>

  <p>In his impatience, he probably passed over some ideal candidates for
  immortality, as he exhausted the 'Longs' and 'Lords,' on his way to the
  'Loves.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly his attention was arrested by an uncommon name&mdash;'Loveapple.'
  The prefix was 'Miss,' which encouraged him to notice the address.</p>

  <p>No. 19, Madeira Crescent was somewhere in northwest London. It suggested a
  picture of a solid house, left stranded by the receded tide of fashion, with
  an imposing flight of steps and a lot of damp fallen leaves on the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>'I'll O.K. her,' he decided indolently. 'Tomorrow will do.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, Miss Loveapple felt vaguely depressed and worried.
  Although she had no knowledge that she had been invited as guest-of-honour to
  a murder-party, she began to dislike the idea of letting her London
  house.</p>

  <p>The basic idea underlying the acquisition of her three houses was the
  sense of personal ownership. They must be vacant, swept and garnished, ready
  for her occupation, whenever she wanted change of scene.</p>

  <p>Already she had lowered her standard by letting her bungalow regularly for
  the summer months. In one way she was rather proud of the fact that it was
  always in keen demand. It was the result of a definite policy&mdash;the
  installation of a refrigerator and the lavish use of white enamel-paint.</p>

  <p>But while it was true that she did not care for the south coast during the
  holiday season, she always felt guilty about the transaction. She had
  exploited something which was intensely personal&mdash;her seaside house. It
  was almost as though she had profited in a White Paint Traffic.</p>

  <p>Apart from her sense of shame, she vaguely felt that those convenient
  people who so cheerfully overpaid her for temporary accommodation were bound
  to leave some shred of their personality behind them. The atmosphere of the
  bungalow was no longer pure undiluted 'Loveapple,' but a compound of 'Brown,
  Smith and Robinson.'</p>

  <p>She frowned in indecision as she re-read the house agent's letter. He
  advised her that a client wished to rent a furnished family house in a London
  suburb for about a month. He added that if she were inclined to consider an
  offer, he believed that this Major Brand would be a desirable tenant.</p>

  <p>The clock ticked away momentous minutes while her future hung in the
  balance. At that moment she was safe. Miss Loveapple, of the Pond House,
  Highfield, lived in a different world from that of a gentleman in a darkish
  flat in the Charing Cross Road. So long as she remained where she was, they
  were divided by the immensity of Space.</p>

  <p>The threat was exclusive to Miss Love-apple of No. 19, Madeira Crescent,
  London, N.W.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a time limit to the danger period, even in her case. If the
  gentleman called at her London address, according to his schedule, on the
  following day and found it shuttered and unoccupied he was not likely to
  waste time over a return journey, which might attract attention. One woman
  was as good as another for his purpose&mdash;and the Telephone Directory was
  full of other names...</p>

  <p>Still a million worlds away from him and secure in the sanctuary of her
  green-and-white dining-room, Miss Loveapple felt the first stir of her
  instinct to organise. She believed that she had administrative talent, owing
  to the fact that she always made a quick decision and stuck to it, regardless
  of consequence.</p>

  <p>In this case, it seemed indicated that she should travel to Switzerland
  direct from London, in order to save a double railway fare. But while this
  trip was essential&mdash;since she would not accept any tenant she had not
  first seen and approved&mdash;it was necessary to cut her visit as short as
  possible. There was always extra expense involved in running two separate
  establishments, although it would not pay her to move her family to town for
  so limited a period.</p>

  <p>Taking up her purse-calendar, she began to calculate dates. That day was
  the eleventh of August. If she travelled up to London on the twelfth, three
  days should be sufficient to finish her business. Therefore she would be
  ready to start on her holiday on the fifteenth, which would allow her a full
  fortnight abroad.</p>

  <p>Although she had not committed herself to a resolution, her mind began to
  function with fatal ease. First she must telephone to the house agent in
  London and ask him to arrange a meeting with the Major upon the following
  morning. When she had received the advance payment&mdash;for which she always
  stipulated&mdash;she had to wait until she had passed his cheque through the
  local branch of the London bank where she had a credit account. Afterwards
  everything would be in order for her to buy her tickets from Cook.</p>

  <p>By this time, details had arranged themselves so tidily in her mind that,
  unconsciously, they assumed the rigidity of a plan. She waited until
  nine-fifteen before she put through a call to the house agent's office, when
  she was annoyed to find that only the staff was present.</p>

  <p>After she had expressed her wishes clearly and somewhat in the style of a
  dictator's ultimatum, she strolled into the garden, to find Elsie.</p>

  <p>Although it was still early, the dew had dried even in the shade and the
  hot air was drawing out the perfume of mignonette and heliotrope from the
  perennial border. Overblown roses shed their petals in a drift of crimson,
  yellow and pink over the beds. Patches of clear water amid the lily leaves in
  the tank reflected the sky in gleams of burning blue.</p>

  <p>The maid was not visible, but Miss Love-apple could hear shouts of coarse
  laughter mingled with the excited barking of a dog. Guided by the sounds, she
  went through a clipped-yew archway to the drying ground, where Elsie was
  rolling on the grass with Scottie and David.</p>

  <p>At her mistress's approach she rose to her hands and knees and peered up
  through the hair which covered her eyes, like a lion's mane; the next second
  she was on her feet, with every permed lock in order and not a wrinkle in her
  artificial silk stockings.</p>

  <p>'David's doing the Lambeth Walk,' she said primly.</p>

  <p>'Oi,' responded Miss Loveapple mechanically. 'Elsie, I am waiting for a
  trunk call. If it is favourable, we shall have to be busy. I must pack for
  Switzerland to-day&mdash;and you must make a copy of the London house
  inventory.'</p>

  <p>Although it was a coveted job, for Elsie was proud of her neat
  handwriting, the girl looked glum.</p>

  <p>'Won't you take us with you?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No, Elsie,' replied Miss Loveapple. 'You'd have to go into
  quarantine.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, madam. Will you be away for long?'</p>

  <p>'About three weeks. But I will ask Miss Pitt to call and see if Scottie
  and David are keeping fit. Captain Brown will advise you about the flowers
  and if there are any vegetables to spare the rector will be glad to
  distribute them. You see, you will have no worry. And I know I can trust you
  to carry on.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, madam.'</p>

  <p>Elsie understood the position perfectly. Notwithstanding the fact that her
  mistress professed perfect trust in her, a village C.I.D. with trained
  sporting instincts would be on her trail.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the maid's gloomy face, Miss Loveapple tickled David on his
  Prinny-like stomach.</p>

  <p>'David says sulking gets you nowhere,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to go nowhere,' burst out Elsie. 'But I don't like your
  going away without me to look after you. All the terrible things happen
  abroad...You may be murdered.'</p>

  <p>'And I may be murdered in England, if that's what you plan for me.'</p>

  <p>'Not if I'm there to open the door to strangers and send them away.'</p>

  <p>'But why should any one want to murder <i>me? I</i> don't go about in
  sables and diamonds. And nobody's got a grudge against me.'</p>

  <p>'There are criminal lunatics. <i>They</i> aren't particular.'</p>

  <p>'But you have to encourage them first. They are usually invited home by
  the wretched women they murder.'</p>

  <p>'Not in lonely places.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not going into the woods by myself. The problem will be to find a
  spot in Grindelwald that's not crawling with tourists...Don't be silly,
  Elsie. Snap out of it.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple spoke in her briskest tone to hide the fact that she was
  touched by Elsie's devotion. As she looked at the pale face and flat figure,
  she felt a sudden pang at the thought of separation.</p>

  <p>'If I didn't keep up three houses,' she reflected, 'I could afford a good
  holiday for all three of us.'</p>

  <p>Even while she was weakening, she heard the ringing of the telephone bell
  inside the house. London had come through, to tell her that Major Brand would
  meet her about noon on the following day at her London address.</p>

  <p>It was such convincing testimony to her powers of organisation that she
  closed her heart against sentiment. She decided to leave Pond House and
  travel up to No. 19, Madeira Crescent, London, N.W.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE INVISIBLE PLAYER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHETHER she worked in the house or garden, Miss Loveapple's
  official wear was shorts. These were ready-made and possessed the discretion
  of the Boy Scout pattern, rather than the frankness of a bathing belle model.
  All the same, she paid tribute to local susceptibilities by buttoning a grey
  flannel skirt over them before she went into the village.</p>

  <p>She had grown too used to its old-world charm to see it through the eyes
  of enthusiastic tourists who arrived in their cars and motor coaches. The
  raised pavements&mdash;darkly arcaded with trees&mdash;the numerous flights
  of steps, the Tudor houses on the green, the stocks and the ancient church
  were accepted by her merely as environment.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, everything looked much as usual as she clumped over the
  little cobbled square to reach the shade of the lime avenue. It was unusually
  hot and most people were at home, sleeping in darkened rooms or sitting in
  the privacy of quiet walled gardens.</p>

  <p>Yet, in spite of the dusty golden haze which powdered the air&mdash;as
  though the heat had become visible&mdash;there must have been active forces
  quivering behind the thick blue atmosphere. That intangible
  quantity&mdash;Miss Loveapple's Luck&mdash;had been threatened by a blind
  dive into a telephone directory.</p>

  <p>It was on its guard against a malignant intelligence which had taken it
  unawares. Therefore, although Miss Loveapple met only three persons that
  afternoon, and in each case the conversation was of a casual nature, every
  contact was a move in a game played by invisible players and had its
  repercussion on the future.</p>

  <p>She was accompanied by Scottie, who was delighted to take her for a walk.
  He showed off by covering every stretch of distance three times to her once,
  but he always returned to assure himself of her safety. In spite of this
  proof of fidelity, whenever he met another dog he ignored her completely and
  pretended he was out alone on his legitimate business.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Miss Loveapple left the shade of the leafy tunnel. She crossed
  the shrunken river by the hump-backed bridge and reached the green which was
  ringed with white chains swung between posts. It was here she met the
  masculine spinster of the All Hallows E'en party.</p>

  <p>Unaffected by the heat, Miss Agatha Pitt was exercising her dogs. A felt
  hat was jammed down over her eyes and she wore a tailored suit of green
  knitwear which reproached Miss Loveapple's home-made jumper and skirt. As she
  raised her hand in greeting, Miss Loveapple could not keep back her news, in
  spite of a previous resolution to affect nonchalance.</p>

  <p>'My luck again,' she cried triumphantly. 'I'm going to Switzerland.'</p>

  <p>Agatha Pitt showed no sign of shock.</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i>'m going to Beer,' she said. 'South Devon.'</p>

  <p>'Nice name.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't it? I could do with some now. But I'd swap it for&mdash;wherever it
  is you're going.'</p>

  <p>'Grindelwald.'</p>

  <p>Agatha Pitt wrinkled her nose in doubt.</p>

  <p>'It <i>used</i> to be very nice, even in the summer,' she said. 'My aunts
  went there regularly. But they run so many popular trips now. You'll meet
  people.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind about them, as long as the mountains are the same shape. I'm
  going to meet <i>them.</i> But I haven't been there since I was a child. Can
  you give me any tips?'</p>

  <p>Miss Pitt brightened at the opening.</p>

  <p>'To begin with, you must travel light,' she advised. 'One suitcase only
  and a small bag for the night in the train. Have you a passport?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I got one when I went to Brussels, four years ago. What about
  clothes?'</p>

  <p>'Your oldest.' True to type, Miss Pitt was faithful to a tradition which
  still lingers in select country circles. 'If you have any old rag you want to
  wear out, or something that's not suitable for home, now's your chance.'</p>

  <p>'Suits me,' declared Miss Loveapple. 'The Pond House is wearing my new
  dress. Have you noticed the white satin curtains?'</p>

  <p>'I have. Positively bridal.'</p>

  <p>Agatha Pitt's sun-flushed face grew redder as she fought her natural
  disinclination to offer advice. To her, there was a crazy element in a scheme
  when the house wore a wedding garment instead of the mistress.</p>

  <p>'I wish you'd meet someone nice in Switzerland,' she said, 'and come back
  engaged.'</p>

  <p>'Why? You haven't.'</p>

  <p>'Leave me out of it. I've missed it&mdash;but it doesn't amuse me
  particularly to see the other foxes running about without tails. Have you
  never thought of getting married?'</p>

  <p>'Sometimes. It means a hopeful young man will expect me to live in
  <i>his</i> house and spend my money on a new car, every Olympia, and public
  schools for the boys. No, thanks.'</p>

  <p>'But is it worth it?' persisted Agatha Pitt. 'Keeping up three houses, I
  mean. What do you get out of it?'</p>

  <p>'A lot,' confessed Miss Loveapple. 'It's difficult to explain, but it
  makes me feel up in the sky. Different from other people. Tomorrow when I'm
  in the train I can say to myself, "I may be shabby, but I'm the only person
  here with three houses.'"</p>

  <p>'Are you travelling up early, as usual?' hinted Miss Pitt.</p>

  <p>'Yes, by the workman's train.' Miss Loveapple laughed with perfect good
  temper. 'Don't try to be subtle. Leave that to George Arliss. I admit there
  won't be much competition&mdash;but if I were travelling in a Pullman with
  rich people, I wouldn't mind betting I would still be the only person with
  three houses.'</p>

  <p>Miss Pitt changed the subject, since she felt too prejudiced to argue
  politely.</p>

  <p>'Would you like me to keep an eye on your animals while you are away?' she
  asked.</p>

  <p>'I was hoping you would offer. You are an angel...But please be tactful,
  because Elsie is so sensitive. Do you know her taste is so delicate she can't
  eat "insides"&mdash;not even sweetbreads?'</p>

  <p>'I'll make a note of it for the next time she comes to dinner. "No
  sweetbreads for Miss Loveapple's maid."...By the way, you will miss the
  Garden Fête.'</p>

  <p>'I know. I'm on my way to the Rectory, to break it to Mrs
  Bosanquet...Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>'Good-bye. Don't forget to travel light and wear your oldest clothes.'</p>

  <p>'I shall wear my shorts.'</p>

  <p>Agatha Pitt concealed her shudder, for in her code 'cut' ran neck-to-neck
  with Cleanliness, to come in second to Godliness.</p>

  <p>'If I don't see you again, "Good luck,"' she said.</p>

  <p>'I shall get that,' declared Miss Loveapple confidently.</p>

  <p>Although she had been the herald of personal good fortune, her triumph had
  proved faintly bittersweet. As she followed Scottie across the green, some
  residue of doubt kept rising to cloud her satisfaction. She was reminded that
  the village afforded opportunities for friendship of which she was not able
  to avail herself. Owing to her constant migrations, she had lost touch with
  the natives.</p>

  <p>For example, there was Agatha Pitt. Apart from an inability to appreciate
  Elsie properly, she had excellent qualities. She had just proved herself not
  only free from envy, but cheerfully ready for personal service.</p>

  <p>A small scarlet sports car shot by, packed with golf-sticks, dogs, two
  large young men and a girl who was driving. They all bowed to her with the
  formality due to a superior adult, instead of greeting her with shouts or
  waves.</p>

  <p>'I can't be much older than that girl,' reflected Miss Loveapple, 'but I'm
  always paired with Agatha Pitt and her gang...Odd.'</p>

  <p>Then the burnt grass of the misnamed green made her think of
  snow-mountains and her usual happiness returned.</p>

  <p>'Rectory, Scottie,' she said.</p>

  <p>The small dog immediately led her towards the long flight of stone steps
  which led up to the church.</p>

  <p>Any one who lived in Highfield was qualified to take a postman's job,
  since much of the village was built on elevated ground and was reached only
  by climbing stairs. As Miss Loveapple mounted the hollowed treads, on either
  side of her were picturesque cottages, overgrown with creepers and
  nasturtiums.</p>

  <p>Half-way up, she paused on a broad paved landing and, turning to the
  right, passed through tall wrought-iron gates. The shady grass square inside,
  with its clipped yews, was somewhat like a monastery garden; but the illusion
  was shattered, as she drew near the front door of the Rectory, by a clamour
  of shrill feminine voices.</p>

  <p>The rector's wife was holding a Mother's Meeting in the dining-room.
  Before her marriage, she had been matron of a Cottage hospital, so she was in
  her element as she laid down the law on the subject of hygiene. She ruled the
  Parish with kindly efficiency, but she had never grown accustomed to the
  absence of her cap. That afternoon, in spite of the heat and the fact that
  she was in her own house, she wore a hat with strings tied under her chin to
  mark an official occasion.</p>

  <p>She liked Miss Loveapple, for she saw in her the ideal probationer, after
  she had been subdued by drudgery and snubs; but all the same, she challenged
  her unauthorised entrance.</p>

  <p>'Since when have <i>you</i> become a mother? Produce the infant&mdash;or
  you'll get no tea.'</p>

  <p>'You know perfectly well I have two fur sons,' said Miss Loveapple.
  'Besides, I've not come to cadge.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, the cook appeared to announce the tea interval, so the
  rector's wife was free to listen to Miss Loveapple's explanation about her
  absence from the Garden Fête.</p>

  <p>She made no secret of the fact that she was very annoyed by the news.</p>

  <p>'It is most discouraging,' she said, 'after all my efforts to make the
  Fête a success. Lady Pontypool has promised to open it, and naturally I want
  to pay her the compliment of a full muster of parishioners.'</p>

  <p>'Lady Pontypool,' echoed Miss Loveapple in surprise. 'Why&mdash;she's
  big.'</p>

  <p>'No. About eight stone.'</p>

  <p>'I mean&mdash;rich, important.'</p>

  <p>'She's not important to <i>me.</i> I nursed her when she had pleurisy. My
  hospital loaned me...Surely you can put off your visit to Switzerland?'</p>

  <p>'No, I've made my arrangements to go up to London tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>The rector's wife saw that her mind was made up, so turned back to her
  mothers. 'I'll keep an eye on Elsie,' she muttered automatically.</p>

  <p>Hot and thirsty, Miss Loveapple hurried homewards to her tea. On her way
  she was fortunate enough to meet Captain Brown&mdash;her rival at many flower
  shows. He was a mild little man, who had endured a martyrdom of malarial
  exile with sufficient fortitude to win the V.C. on Active Service.</p>

  <p>His eyes gleamed when he promised to look after her garden in her
  absence.</p>

  <p>'I warn you, I shall take plenty of loot,' he said. 'One has to be
  drastic. Before I go away, I cut off every flower and every bud in my garden.
  Put it to sleep, you know. If I didn't, everything would bloom and
  seed&mdash;and the garden would be finished.'</p>

  <p>Although he was advocating only a temporary measure of precaution, Miss
  Loveapple objected to the wholesale destruction of her beloved plants.</p>

  <p>'I think you follow the book too closely,' she said. <i>'You</i> told me
  to dig three spades deep for my sweet-peas and to coat the seeds with red
  lead to keep the mice from nibbling them...Well, I didn't. And my sweet-peas
  beat yours at the show.'</p>

  <p>Captain Brown, who was the best horticulturist in the district, writhed at
  the thrust.</p>

  <p>'You do everything wrong,' he complained. 'Yet your flowers come up. You
  must have green fingers.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'm lucky.'</p>

  <p>'You certainly were over your house. Can't imagine why any one should want
  to stay in London in August.'</p>

  <p>'It was because I wanted to go to Switzerland. Things always turn out for
  me...But I must hurry home. I've got to pack. I've only got one more night
  here.'</p>

  <p>Only one more night in which she could sleep in safety...At that moment,
  it seemed as though Miss Loveapple's luck had lost the game.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE EMPTY HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EARLY next morning, Miss Loveapple climbed the wooden stairs
  leading to the elevated railway station. She lugged a heavy suitcase, packed
  to capacity, while Elsie carried the small bag which contained oddments for
  the night.</p>

  <p>During the walk, the maid had scarcely spoken, while her face expressed
  the desperate resignation of a sea-sick sailor. It was not until Miss
  Loveapple had taken her place in a third-class carriage that she came to
  life.</p>

  <p>'Please, madam, will you promise me not to open the door to any one?'</p>

  <p>'Pull yourself together,' advised Miss Loveapple. 'I've got to open the
  door to Major Brand.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know what he looks like?'</p>

  <p>'No, we've not exchanged photographs.'</p>

  <p>'Then how will you know it's <i>him?'</i></p>

  <p>'By his cheque. That's good enough evidence for me.'</p>

  <p>The guard dropped the green flag and the train began to draw out of the
  station. Running by the side of it, Elsie continued to shout:</p>

  <p>'Watch out for gloves. Notice if he keeps them on. Criminals always wear
  gloves, so as to leave no fingerprints.'</p>

  <p>'All right...Good-bye, Elsie. Be sure you come to meet me.'</p>

  <p>'Gloves. Don't forget gloves.'</p>

  <p>'Be sure you bring Scottie to the station. <i>Scottie</i>.'</p>

  <p><i>'Gloves.'</i></p>

  <p>Elsie got the last word as they screamed against each other. Then
  <i>Miss</i> Loveapple sank back in her seat, to find that every one in the
  carriage was staring at her.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she almost believed that they paid homage to her three
  houses, before she realised the real reason for their interest.</p>

  <p>'I suppose I look Continental,' she thought complacently.</p>

  <p>She had availed herself of the licence implied in <i>Miss</i> Pitt's
  advice about old clothes, to wear a white elephant which had been hanging in
  her wardrobe for years. It was a dressmaker's suit of black satin, bought for
  a wedding and too smart for general wear. Although the cycle of fashion had
  nearly caught it up, it was definitely dated, while the tight skirt was
  frankly 'seated.'</p>

  <p>The direct result of some unimportant feminine chatter on the green was
  publicity for Miss Loveapple. She was too striking a figure to be overlooked,
  even when she got out of the train at Charing Cross Station. Marching along,
  a bag in either hand, an old camel-hair coat slung over her shoulder and her
  fair hair uncovered, people turned to look at her again.</p>

  <p>Too simple to be an exhibitionist, she was naively pleased with the notice
  she attracted.</p>

  <p>'It pays to travel in smart clothes,' she thought. 'And I'm saving my good
  tweeds.'</p>

  <p>It was hot and airless in the Underground and the carriage was jammed with
  workers on their way to office and shop; but in spite of the congestion she
  was offered a seat immediately as a tribute to her appearance. Eyes stared at
  her, reflecting mixed emotions&mdash;criticism, derision, admiration,
  envy.</p>

  <p>When she came out of the tube station into the crowded street, she thought
  regretfully of the lily tank in the Pond House garden. Although it was still
  early, the temperature was already high. The stale air stank of dust and
  petrol, the pavements were grimed and a pneumatic drill was tearing up a
  section of the road.</p>

  <p>She had not far to walk before she turned down a side road which led to
  Madeira Crescent. Situated in a quiet backwater, it was a semi-circle of
  Victorian houses&mdash;well built, with pillared porticoes and long flights
  of front steps, guarded by plaster lions. A few had been converted into flats
  and there were two residential hotels; but although their regional glory had
  departed, the standard was not unduly relaxed.</p>

  <p>In front was a private garden, reserved for residents. At present it was a
  wilderness of shaggy grass and smutted evergreen shrubs, although in the
  spring lilacs and laburnums lent it temporary beauty.</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple approached No. 19, she stood and looked up at its buff
  stucco front. The blinds were down, so that she could not admire her
  expensive curtains, but she felt her usual surge of proud ownership.</p>

  <p><i>'Mine</i>. My London house.'</p>

  <p>She unlocked the door and then hesitated as she peered into the darkness
  of the interior. After the glare of the street, her eyes were too dazzled to
  focus properly, or to recognise the outlines of any familiar object. It
  looked alive with a confusion of shifting shadows and tenebrous as a
  jungle.</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had gone into the house alone. Usually the entry
  was a scene of noise and excitement. Elsie&mdash;forgetful of her official
  voice&mdash;shouted to Scottie, who was always quivering with eagerness to be
  'first foot,' while David leaped about inside his basket like a landed
  fish.</p>

  <p>She told herself that she was missing the others as she lingered, feeling
  a strange reluctance to enter. Although she was not normally imaginative, the
  house did not feel empty. She had an uneasy sense that it held an uninvited
  tenant who paid no rent.</p>

  <p>Someone&mdash;or something&mdash;was waiting for her in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Shaking off the impression, she forced herself to step into the hall and
  shut the door. Nothing leaped upon her out of the gloom as she jerked up the
  spring blind, letting in a shaft of sunlight.</p>

  <p>It revealed a prune piled carpet which was her special pride. She stopped
  and rubbed it with her finger, making a slightly darker patch.</p>

  <p>'It's holding the dust,' she reflected. 'I'll have to face it and get a
  vacuum...And now I'll make a cup of tea.'</p>

  <p>Running down the stairs to the semi-basement kitchen, she unbolted the
  back door, which was sheltered by a deep porch from the area. Slung on the
  handle outside was a basket, holding a loaf of bread and a bottle of
  milk.</p>

  <p>Although she was so busy yesterday, she had not forgotten to write
  instructions to the local Dairy. Pleased with her command of the details
  which were essential to efficient organisation, she filled a kettle with
  water and placed it on the gas stove.</p>

  <p>But although she was thirsty, she felt none of the excitement and joyous
  thrill which was present during the preparations for the first picnic meal.
  While it was impossible to trace the source of her discomfort, she was
  vaguely disturbed and ill at ease as she waited for the kettle to sing.</p>

  <p>She found herself thinking of the house as it had looked when it was
  empty, with faded wallpapers, cobwebbed windows and rusted iron grates. At
  the time, she had been reminded of <i>The Barretts of Wimpole Street</i>, and
  wondered vaguely whether its walls had witnessed scenes of parental cruelty
  or the terror of children frightened by nurserymaids; but the decorators and
  electrician had banished every Victorian bogey.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised why she was feeling nervous. It was the thought of
  all those darkened rooms upstairs.</p>

  <p>'I'd better open up,' she thought, 'and then I can enjoy my tea.'</p>

  <p>Turning down the gas-jet to a blink, she went upstairs. The house was tall
  and narrow, with large rooms and numerous cupboards On the ground floor were
  the dining-room and the morning-room, and on the first, the drawing-room, the
  best bedroom and the bathroom. Two other bedrooms, together with a linen
  cupboard and a box room, occupied the next floor, while the top part of the
  house was given up to Scottie and David.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple went from room to room, twitching aside curtains with a
  clash of rings and throwing open windows, with her usual brisk efficiency.
  Her procedure was more thorough than her habitual routine, for she opened
  every cupboard and wardrobe and looked behind every door. She even stooped so
  low as to grovel under the beds.</p>

  <p>By the time she had finished the job, her customary good spirits had
  returned. There was no trace of that gaunt Victorian relict in this
  prosperous mansion, with its new and expensive furniture. She was especially
  proud of her carpets and of the fact that only the kitchen and attic flights
  of stairs were covered with linoleum.</p>

  <p>Completely reassured, she ran downstairs and made her tea. As she was
  drinking it, the front door bell rang. It was too early to expect Major
  Brand, but she dared not risk missing him, so she went upstairs and opened
  the door.</p>

  <p>A man wearing a clerical round collar and soft felt hat stood outside. His
  bluish chin showed that he subdued a stiff beard with difficulty, while his
  mobile lips were slightly suggestive of an actor.</p>

  <p>She summed him up with her native penetration which deserted her so
  completely in a crisis.</p>

  <p>'Black gloves. Collecting-book. Something tells me you were never in holy
  orders, my friend.'</p>

  <p>His smile was attractive, however, and when he spoke his voice had no
  professional whine.</p>

  <p>'Another glorious day. We are lucky to be able to see the sky. Out of
  gratitude, won't you give me a contribution for the blind?'</p>

  <p><i>'"We,</i>"' Miss Loveapple reminded him. 'You can see as well as I can.
  What form is your own gratitude going to take?'</p>

  <p>Meeting her shrewd blue eyes, he summed her up and decided on his line of
  action.</p>

  <p>'Fifty per cent of what I collect,' he replied frankly.</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>I</i> can always spot a professional collector. Honestly, I wish I
  could give you something, although I am a subscriber already. But my charity
  list is full strength and I can't afford to increase it.'</p>

  <p>The collector looked at the thick gold chain around her neck. Attached to
  it was an elephant with his trunk upraised.</p>

  <p>'If you can't afford any more,' he said, 'why not make some extra money?
  Surely you've heard of the Twins?'</p>

  <p>'Quins? Of course.'</p>

  <p>'No, Browning's Twins. You remember his poem of the poverty-stricken
  monastery, which held two inmates&mdash;Date and Dabitur. "Give" and "It
  shall be given," you know.'</p>

  <p>He began to quote:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'While Date was in good case,<br>
  Dabitur flourished too;<br>
  For Dabitur's lenten face<br>
  No wonder if Date rue.<br>
  Would you retrieve the one?<br>
  Try and make plump the other&mdash;'</p><br>

  <p>He stopped his recitation and opened his book.</p>

  <p>'Have I made myself clear?' he asked. 'Give me a small gift and count it
  as an investment. You'll get it back with interest.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple knew that he was playing upon her superstitious weakness,
  yet she could not resist his bait. She told herself that it was a lucky
  omen.</p>

  <p>'I shall get more than I expect for the house,' she thought, as she opened
  her bag.</p>

  <p>After the resourceful collector had gone, not only the house, but the
  neighbourhood seemed strangely silent. It had never struck her before how
  completely the Crescent was withdrawn from the main thoroughfare, as well as
  in itself. The solid walls of each house permitted no intrusion of the
  affairs of its neighbour. There were no voices or footsteps audible on either
  side of her. Only a distant hum floated in through the windows.</p>

  <p>A board at each entrance warned the public against trespass and
  objectionable traffic. 'NO FUNERALS' indicated the Crescent as an awkward
  place wherein to die, were the injunction taken literally.</p>

  <p>'Any one could be murdered here and no one would hear a sound,' thought
  Miss Loveapple, with justifiable pride at this proof of a select and secluded
  property.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; GLOVES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the church clock was striking twelve, the front door bell
  rang again.</p>

  <p>'Thank goodness they teach them punctuality in the army,' reflected Miss
  Loveapple. 'My money's not entirely wasted.'</p>

  <p>It was typical of her mentality to forget that any one paid rates and
  income-tax besides herself.</p>

  <p>She ran up the kitchen stairs, in her eagerness to admit Major Brand; but
  when she opened the door, the man who stood outside was not of military
  appearance. Younger than she had expected&mdash;tall, spare and well
  groomed&mdash;he looked an average type of educated Englishman, except for
  the penetration of his hazel eyes and the disillusionment of his
  expression.</p>

  <p>This vanished when he smiled, revealing excellent teeth.</p>

  <p>'Is Miss Loveapple at home?' he said.</p>

  <p>'I am Miss Loveapple,' she told him.</p>

  <p>He stared at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>'But you can't be the owner of this house? Not a girl like you.'</p>

  <p>The sheer novelty of the description made Miss Loveapple gasp. But
  although it pleased her to discover that, outside her circle, she was not
  predated, the familiarity offended her self-esteem.</p>

  <p>'I certainly am the owner,' she said stiffly. 'Are you Major Brand?'</p>

  <p>'No, his brother-in-law. He's gone off fishing in Wales. But he wants a
  place to park his family, so I offered to O.K. one and fix things up.'</p>

  <p>Offended by the casual tone, <i>Miss</i> Loveapple looked at him, making
  no secret of the fact that he was under inspection. She noticed that his suit
  was well-cut, though shabby, and that his expensive boots were beginning to
  crack.</p>

  <p>She also noticed that he wore washable doeskin gloves.</p>

  <p>Elsie's warning floated into her mind as she shook her head in doubt.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure that I can arrange anything with a second party,' she said.
  <i>'My</i> house is newly decorated and furnished. So I'm naturally
  particular about whom I let it to. I'm sorry, but I must have a personal
  interview.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'To form my own impression.'</p>

  <p>A smile flitted across the stranger's face.</p>

  <p>'Do you claim to do that?' he asked. 'Suppose I am a prospective client,
  instead of my brother-in-law. Just by looking at me, can you decide whether I
  chuck lighted cigarettes on the carpets or scribble on the wallpaper?'</p>

  <p>'I'm not concerned about that part of it,' she told him. 'All damage will
  have to be made good and every missing article replaced. I've brought a copy
  of the inventory for Major Brand to check.'</p>

  <p>'You are business-like. You see, <i>I</i> can sum up people, too. May I
  tell you something else about yourself? You have a suspicious nature. You
  keep me outside on the doorstep.'</p>

  <p>Forgetful of her resolution not to admit him, Miss Loveapple flushed.</p>

  <p>'Please come in,' she said hastily.</p>

  <p>She reproached herself for her lapse from courtesy, as she led the way to
  the morning-room. This gloved visitor, at least, was above suspicion, because
  he was Major Brand's representative. The fact that he knew all about the
  agent's proposition stamped his visit as an authentic mission.</p>

  <p>She had made a bad start which was impolitic, if she wished to benefit by
  the lesson of Browning's 'Twins.' She must make amends before she led him
  gently to the discussion of terms.</p>

  <p>Apart from the financial consideration, she was glad of a rare opportunity
  to exhibit the splendour of her London house. There was no white paint here,
  but sombre mahogany and rich dark colours, suggestive of stained glass, to
  harmonise with massive furniture. To her delight, the effect was not wasted
  on the young man who praised her taste with unforced enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'I'll hand it to you,' he said. 'All this is vastly different from the
  ordinary furnished house. That's my favourite colour.' He touched a fuchsia
  damask curtain. 'And I adore your carpets. It must be the Persian in me.'</p>

  <p>'Do you really like it?' beamed Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>At that moment, she actually resembled an overgrown schoolgirl whose work
  had been praised by her form mistress.</p>

  <p>'I do. Unreservedly.'</p>

  <p>'I'm so glad. Do sit down. I wish I had something to offer you, but
  there's nothing in the house. I'm only just in.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you live here?'</p>

  <p>'Sometimes. I've just come from the country.'</p>

  <p>It cost Miss Loveapple a real effort to restrain herself from giving
  particulars of the Pond House.</p>

  <p>'Mean to boast,' she thought. 'Especially as he doesn't look too lucky...I
  wonder if it is too soon to mention the terms.'</p>

  <p>As she sat in silence, her deep blue eyes dreamy, the man studied her,
  noticing the excellent bone-structure of her face, and the amber gleams in
  her hair. He remarked, too, the stubbed toes of her shoes and the
  old-fashioned cut of her suit.</p>

  <p>Then he looked around him, at the luxury of the room, with its thick
  carpets and deep, softly-padded chairs. It was very warm and the windows were
  darkened by closely-drawn fuchsia net curtains, which screened a view of the
  opposite 'backs.' In the dim light and linked by their mutual silence they
  seemed to be stranded in an oasis miles distant from the roar of London
  traffic.</p>

  <p>'It is very quiet here,' he said.</p>

  <p>'It is,' she agreed briskly. 'It's a very great advantage.'</p>

  <p>'That's according to taste...Are you alone?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you nervous?'</p>

  <p>She burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>'What of? I keep nothing of value here. No plate, no jewellery, no money.
  Burglars always get to know...Shall we talk business?'</p>

  <p>'That's what I am here for...What's your name?'</p>

  <p>'I've told you. Miss Loveapple.'</p>

  <p>'I mean&mdash;your Christian name.'</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple remained pointedly silent, he went on talking.</p>

  <p>'Is it "Flora"? It ought to be. By the way, my name is "Buckingham." I'm
  Mrs Brand's brother. Just connect me with a palace, if you forget.'</p>

  <p>'Then, Mr Buckingham, what about the terms?'</p>

  <p>'I'm leaving those to the agent. In my brother-in-law's interest, I must
  tell him to screw them down as low as possible. But if I were discussing them
  directly with you, it would be the other way around.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple bit her lip with disappointment. She began to wonder
  whether she had bungled the interview. Instead of snubbing the young man, she
  should have encouraged him.</p>

  <p>'Do you know the date Major Brand wants to come in?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. He wants to move his family in on September the fourteenth. That's
  the date of his return to India, but he won't go until the evening.'</p>

  <p>'But I <i>must</i> see him before I go to Switzerland. I'm going to
  Grindelwald for a fortnight.'</p>

  <p>'Then you've time to work it in all right.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head miserably. All her schemes were constructed after the
  fashion of an Oriental craftsman who carves a nest of boxes, each enclosed
  within the other. The postponement of the date was upsetting her original
  plan to meet the Major and, consequently receive his cheque. This was
  essential to her own holiday; but, as matters now stood, she was not sure
  whether he would consider payment so long in advance.</p>

  <p>'It's customary,' she said diffidently, 'to pay rent in advance. Do
  you&mdash;could you arrange that with your brother-in-law?'</p>

  <p>'Leave it to me.' His voice was confident. 'Now we've settled the business
  end, might I smoke?'</p>

  <p>Opening his case, he offered it to her. When she refused, he took a
  cigarette and lit it, without removing his gloves.</p>

  <p>In spite of the slight flutter of her heart, she refused to feel
  nervous.</p>

  <p>'Have you hurt your hand?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'In a way. My fingers look rather repulsive at present. I've been doing
  some experimental work. Inventing some sweet little gadget for slaying my
  fellow men.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple accepted his explanation with outward calm. If, for a
  moment, she thought wistfully of Elsie, she assured herself that it was not
  for moral support, or protection, but rather that she might ring for the maid
  to show Mr Buckingham the front door.</p>

  <p>At that moment, she was conscious of two desires at conflict. One was
  disturbing, because it was treachery to her own standard of independence. She
  admitted to herself that she was definitely conscious of this young man and
  responsive to his personality. She wanted to remain with him in this dim
  warmth and let their mutual attraction develop into intimacy.</p>

  <p>The other desire was partly subconscious, but it swayed her will with the
  force of a deep-sea current.</p>

  <p>She must get rid of this young man at once.</p>

  <p>'When may I expect the cheque?' she asked in a level voice.</p>

  <p>'I can't tell you that off-hand,' replied Buckingham. 'I shall have to
  wait until I get an address from Brand, before I can write to him about it.
  Of course, it must be made out to the agent.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple grew red.</p>

  <p>'Are you trying to imply that I shall not pay him his commission?' she
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Of course not. But, as you've been reminding me, this is business.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple rose with difficulty from the clinging depths of her
  chair.</p>

  <p>'In that case,' she said, 'it seems a waste of time for me to remain in
  London. I shall travel to Switzerland on the thirty-first of August and
  return to London on the thirteenth of September, so as to meet Major Brand on
  the fourteenth. The cheque can be sent to my country house.'</p>

  <p>'Have you <i>two</i> houses?' he asked.</p>

  <p>This time, she could not resist the opening. Since he had insisted on
  treating her as a girl&mdash;and one who was attractive&mdash;it was time for
  him to learn that she was an important woman of property.</p>

  <p>'Three,' she corrected. 'I have a bungalow by the sea.'</p>

  <p>'That all? Haven't you a villa in the South of France and a sky-scraper in
  New York?'</p>

  <p>She elevated her chin.</p>

  <p>'If that is intended as a joke, I am not amused.'</p>

  <p>Her voice was iced with such disapproving dignity that it might have been
  the echo of Queen Victoria's historic remark, winging through the years.</p>

  <p>He followed her to the front door.</p>

  <p>'Where is your country house?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Kent.'</p>

  <p>'You're almost too confiding. Don't you trust me?'</p>

  <p>'It is not a matter of trust. It is merely that I cannot see the
  connection between personal details and a business
  interview...Good-morning.'</p>

  <p>As she closed the front door after him, she was chilled by a sudden
  thought.</p>

  <p>The gentleman who had just gone had left behind him no fingerprints.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE APPOINTMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE returned to the morning-room as she felt the
  need of a cigarette; but instead of finding the usual solace in tobacco, she
  grew angry as she went over the interview in her mind.</p>

  <p>It was characteristic that her annoyance was directed chiefly against
  herself. Underneath her surface importance, was a vast area of fundamental
  humility which made her ready to assume the blame for any mishap.</p>

  <p>'Everything's mucked up,' she thought despairingly. 'It's all my fault.
  Gold-digging and boasting. I hate myself.'</p>

  <p>However, by the time the cigarette was reduced to a stub, she found
  herself reacting to the usual swing.</p>

  <p>'Honestly, why shouldn't I talk about my houses? When people have
  triplets, they don't hush it up and talk about "Our child," as if they were
  one...My three houses mean achievement. I wanted to do something against the
  odds&mdash;and I did it. I did it all by myself. And I've done no one any
  harm. It's the other way round.'</p>

  <p>She remembered her purchase of her London home and the gratitude of the
  lean grey man who could not afford to live there any longer. To save rates,
  it had remained empty for years, which accounted for its neglected condition.
  Large family residences of that type were a drug on the market, particularly
  as the land was not available for a rebuilding proposition.</p>

  <p>The building-contractor too, who had sold her the seaside bungalow, had
  wanted to turn his money over and so needed to make a quick sale. She had
  helped to put money into circulation, so was an actual benefactor to the
  nation.</p>

  <p>The fact remained, however, that her plans were upset&mdash;and she hated
  altering any of her arrangements. Yet, in the uncertain state of affairs, it
  seemed hardly worthwhile to open the London house. Although it went dead
  against the grain, it would be wiser to own herself beaten and return at once
  to Highfield.</p>

  <p>As she hesitated, the trifles of yesterday assumed their places in the
  pattern. If she stayed on in London, Captain Brown would have extra time in
  which to slaughter her beloved garden. Tied down to a limit of two weeks, he
  could not do so much damage.</p>

  <p>There was another inducement. When she had promised to help at the
  refreshment stall, at the Garden Fête, she had expected the usual dull
  affair. Now the presence of Lady Pontypool&mdash;a photographed and
  paragraphed beauty&mdash;would attract strangers and turn it into a function.
  As matters stood, Miss Loveapple was committed to send contributions to the
  stall for which she would receive no entertainment value.</p>

  <p>The snow mountains which were her secret passion still beckoned to her
  with polar magnetic fingers, but she reminded herself that they were
  eternal.</p>

  <p>'They've waited so long for me,' she reflected, 'that they can wait a
  little longer.'</p>

  <p>She shut the window of the morning-room, shook up a cushion which was
  hollowed by the impress of Buckingham's head and picked up the ash-tray which
  contained the ashes of his cigarette and hers.</p>

  <p>As she ran down the basement stairs to the kitchen, she was conscious that
  her spirits had risen at the prospect of returning to the Pond House. Feeling
  hungry, she cut off a generous crust from the loaf and ate it, butterless,
  while she drank the milk. Then she went upstairs and began to shut windows
  and draw curtains.</p>

  <p>Once again, a bell rang. This time it was the telephone exchange, trying
  to get her number. As she lifted the receiver, she recognised the leisurely
  voice of Mr Lemon, the house-agent.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I have some disappointing news,' he said. 'Major Brand has
  been called away to Wales on business.'</p>

  <p>'I know all about that,' Miss Loveapple told him. 'The fish have caught
  him, for a change. His brother-in-law has just been here and spilled the
  beans.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know he had one.' Mr Lemon lost his drawl. 'I hope you didn't
  settle anything with him?'</p>

  <p>'No. I did not. But I want to get the Major's cheque just as soon as you
  possibly can.'</p>

  <p>'I will, but it will take some time. I shall have to wait until I receive
  his address...Meantime, something has turned up which might interest you. Mrs
  Brand has taken a fancy to the house, as it is quiet and there is a garden
  for the children...So, if you would like to sell, I have no doubt I can get a
  good offer from Major Brand before he returns to India.'</p>

  <p>There was a marked pause before Miss Loveapple replied.</p>

  <p>'I have no intention of selling the house.'</p>

  <p>'Not at present,' remarked the agent. 'But turn it over in your mind, as
  there are points about it. In any case, I should like to discuss it with you,
  as I think it might prove to your ultimate advantage.'</p>

  <p>'Well, there's no harm in talking it over,' agreed Miss Loveapple. 'But I
  must come at once, for I am not stopping in London.'</p>

  <p>The agent was naturally aghast at this threat to his golf.</p>

  <p>'You've forgotten it is Saturday afternoon and all offices are closed,' he
  said. 'I'm rushing now, to catch a train. Can you come in Monday?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple frowned, hesitated and finally gave in.</p>

  <p>'Well, since I'm here, I suppose I can stay the weekend. A personal
  interview saves so many letters. I'll call not later than ten-thirty.
  Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>After she had rung off, she repented her decision. She would have to make
  up a bed for only a couple of nights, besides using towels and napery. But
  while this objection had a definite basis of economy, there was a submerged
  reason for her reluctance to stay.</p>

  <p>She vaguely realised that she was beginning to take a dislike to the
  house.</p>

  <p>Although it had been papered and furnished so lavishly, she could not
  forget the desolation which was hidden. It was as though the natural order
  had been reversed and she had seen a skeleton before it was covered by
  flesh.</p>

  <p>Looking back, she came to the conclusion that while she was especially
  proud of No. 19, Madeira Crescent, she had never felt really at home in it,
  even when she had the cheerful company of Elsie and the pets.</p>

  <p>'This is ridiculous,' she told herself. 'Snap out of it.'</p>

  <p>Her suitcase was still in the hall, so she carried it up to the large
  first-floor bedroom. It was a fine but sombre apartment, with a colour scheme
  suggestive of autumnal leaves&mdash;brown, bronze and umber. The suite was
  walnut&mdash;the curtains burnt orange. Outside the windows were wrought-iron
  verandas.</p>

  <p>In spite of the luxurious fittings and the concealed lighting, Miss
  Loveapple knew that she was not looking forward to the night. She had never
  been nervous before, either in the Pond House or the bungalow, when Elsie had
  been away on her holiday. On these occasions she had been surrounded by
  lonely country and empty beach, yet she had felt no pang of loneliness. Here,
  in London, sandwiched between two other buildings occupied by people, she
  felt apprehensive and uneasy.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she smiled at her recognition of a familiar factor.</p>

  <p>'Why, it's my Luck again,' she told herself. 'My present loss is future
  gain. I've found out I don't care for this house, just at the very time I
  have a chance to sell it. If I hadn't gone cowardly, I might have chucked the
  chance away...No, I'll sit tight over the weekend and tell the crafty Lemon
  I've changed my mind. I believe he knows me better than I know
  myself...There's the bell again.'</p>

  <p>Glad of a chance to speak to someone, she ran downstairs to the hall and
  opened the front door.</p>

  <p>For the third time that day, a man waited outside. A general description
  would cover both Buckingham and himself, inasmuch as they might have gone to
  the same public school, but they were not alike. His face was a narrow oval,
  his eyes softer, his smile more resolutely stressed.</p>

  <p>'Got something to sell,' decided Miss Loveapple. 'Poor devil.'</p>

  <p>'A beautiful day,' he remarked hopefully.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple laughed in the friendly manner which marked her intercourse
  with those whom she did not wish to impress.</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to agree,' she said. 'The last time I did, it cost me ten
  shillings.'</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she noticed that the last button of his waistcoat was
  unfastened and that he wore grey suède gloves which matched his new suit. In
  his turn, he was studying her.</p>

  <p>'Ten bob is no good to me,' he said. 'I'm a salesman but I can see that I
  cannot interest <i>you.</i> In our line, we learn to read faces like
  books.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know I was so obvious.' In her loneliness, Miss Loveapple wished
  to prolong an interview which committed her to nothing. 'Besides, you should
  not assume that you've no chance. That is defeatist policy. You should appear
  confident...What do you sell?'</p>

  <p>'Vacuum cleaners.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple grew suddenly alert.</p>

  <p>'But I <i>am</i> thinking of getting one,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Is that on the level?' The young man spoke eagerly. 'If it is, I am
  trying to put over a new line that's the best value in the market. I can let
  you have the literature now, if you are interested, I can give you a
  demonstration.'</p>

  <p>He opened his small attaché-case and drew out a pamphlet.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid the only one left is soiled,' he said. 'That fine thumb-print
  on the cover was made by a prospective customer. It is not mine. You see, I
  always wear gloves.'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter,' said Miss Loveapple. 'I'll read it up and let you
  know if I decide anything.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks a million. Here's my card.'</p>

  <p>She read the name printed upon it.</p>

  <p>'"Henry Watkins." Your name does not suit you too well.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary, my friends used to assure me that I was an ideal
  "Hugo."'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;that's not your real name?'</p>

  <p>'No. Merely assumed for business purposes. I haven't much left, but at
  least, I can keep my own name.'</p>

  <p>'Come down in the world?' asked Miss Loveapple with blunt sympathy.</p>

  <p>'No, going up. People used to sell me things&mdash;and I was always mug
  enough to buy. And I was always taken in. Now it's the other way round. I get
  a real kick out of pitting my brain against the customer&mdash;the gentleman
  who is always right.'</p>

  <p>His smile was bitter as he continued to talk, while he kept his soft brown
  eyes fixed upon her face.</p>

  <p>'Usually he is resistant by nature, so I have to compel him to accept my
  suggestion that he <i>wants</i> to buy. Of course, he is not always taking
  any. It's a definite clash of personality&mdash;and I love it.'</p>

  <p>'Are you rather giving away the show?' asked Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>The young man joined in her laughter.</p>

  <p>'No,' he said. 'I've got you taped. You'd see through my usual salesman's
  patter. You are strong-willed and sensible and you would do nothing against
  your judgment. I only ask you to judge the vacuum on its merits. When can I
  give you a demonstration?'</p>

  <p>'Not just at present. I'm leaving London on Monday, for a few weeks.'</p>

  <p>'But couldn't I show your servants how it works?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple opened her lips to explain and then refrained, from
  instinctive caution.</p>

  <p>'Pumping me,' she decided. 'Wants to know if the house will be empty.'</p>

  <p>'I couldn't accept any one else's opinion,' she told him.</p>

  <p>'Then&mdash;might I call this evening?' he persisted.</p>

  <p>She thought rapidly. As the house would be shut again until the thirteenth
  of September, it was sheer waste of opportunity to give any of her carpets a
  free cleaning. But if the young man were to call on the morning of the
  fourteenth, before the Brand family came into residence, she would reap the
  advantage of a free demonstration. In any case, she would have to write to
  the agency she patronised, asking them to send a reliable woman to clean the
  house in readiness.</p>

  <p>'I'm engaged this evening,' she said. 'But I shall be returning from
  Switzerland on September the thirteenth and shall stay here for the night. If
  you care to come quite early on the following morning, you can try out the
  vacuum. But it must be at your risk, for I cannot give you a definite promise
  to buy the machine.'</p>

  <p>'That is always understood,' explained Mr Watkins. 'I'll make a note of
  the date.'</p>

  <p>As he was scrawling in his book, he made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if I might see the carpet you would like me to work on. I want
  to see the size. You see, if I started and could not finish the effect would
  be patchy.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's transparent face showed her discomfiture.</p>

  <p>'It <i>is</i> rather big,' she admitted. 'You had better come in and see
  it.'</p>

  <p>The young man entered the house and she shut the front door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE LISTENER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER the glare of the August sun, it seemed almost dark
  inside the hall, where only one narrow side window admitted a shaft of dusty
  light. Yet Miss Loveapple felt no nervous qualms about being shut up in the
  house with a gloved stranger. As she turned to him, her mind was occupied
  only with business considerations.</p>

  <p>'If it's possible,' she said, 'I should like you to clean the drawing-room
  carpet.'</p>

  <p>'Where is it?' asked Mr Watkins, turning towards the dining-room. 'This
  room?'</p>

  <p>'No. Upstairs. First floor.'</p>

  <p>He dropped behind, to let her ascend the stairs first, but she refused to
  take the lead.</p>

  <p>'Go on ahead,' she said. 'It is the first door. I hate any one treading on
  my heels.'</p>

  <p>The same instinctive caution warned her against being drawn into making
  any admission when he began to display a professional interest in the
  arrangement of the house.</p>

  <p>'I imagine it is on the same plan as the other houses in the Crescent,' he
  remarked casually. 'Two to three rooms on each floor and about three flights
  of stairs which would need carpet. Certainly it would pay you to buy a vacuum
  cleaner...I suppose the servants sleep on the top-floor?'</p>

  <p>'There are no carpets in the attics or in the basement,' explained Miss
  Loveapple, keeping him within the limits of his own department, without
  telling a lie.</p>

  <p>When the drawing-room was reached, he turned to her with a smile.</p>

  <p><i>'You</i> understand,' he said softly. 'This room has atmosphere. Not a
  jarring note. Restoration, not renovation. I, too, have a feeling for old
  houses.'</p>

  <p>'The carpet,' she reminded him.</p>

  <p>'Superb. I've visited some wealthy homes, both professionally
  and&mdash;<i>before.</i> But I've not seen a more beautiful carpet.'</p>

  <p>In spite of his praise, however, it was obvious that something else had
  captured his interest. He crossed to examine closer a small oil-painting of a
  dark brownish landscape which was hung high on the wall.</p>

  <p>'An original?' he asked. 'It looks like an Old Master.'</p>

  <p>This time, Miss Loveapple answered frankly.</p>

  <p>'I should like to think it was. I picked it up in an antique shop. But
  I've a lucky eye.'</p>

  <p>'Have you had it valued? Is it safe here?'</p>

  <p>'Of course. I'm insured...Well, what's the verdict? Is the carpet too
  big?'</p>

  <p>The young man shrugged as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I'll do it, but only because I am certain I shall make a sale, when you
  see how well it comes up...Please, may I have the name?'</p>

  <p>'Loveapple.'</p>

  <p>'Mrs?'</p>

  <p>'Miss.'</p>

  <p>He made a note in his book and then spoke diffidently.</p>

  <p>'You mentioned something about going to Switzerland. I wonder if I might
  suggest your leaving the top windows open and asking the policeman to keep an
  eye on the premises when you are away. You see, when you shutter up a house,
  you advertise the fact that the place is empty. It's an invitation for
  burglars to call.'</p>

  <p>His advice was unwelcome to Miss Loveapple, for two reasons. To begin
  with, it was an oblique reflection on the judgment of an unmarried woman and
  a statement of her need of masculine advice. It also raised a point about
  which she and Elsie had heated discussions.</p>

  <p>Her elevated chin hinted that he had taken a liberty.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' she said coolly, 'but I am capable of making my own
  arrangements. I &mdash;<i>Oh!</i>'</p>

  <p>She stepped away from the window with a cry.</p>

  <p>It's that man come back again,' she said.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the front door bell rang loudly.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to see him,' she confided impulsively.</p>

  <p>'Then let him ring,' advised 'Watkins.'</p>

  <p>'No, he saw me. I'd better go. Will you wait for me here? I won't be
  long.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed Providential that Buckingham had called while Watkins
  was in the house. On the historic principle of setting a thief to catch a
  thief, one gloved stranger should be protection from another.</p>

  <p>Not daring to leave Major Brand's brother-in-law on the doorstep
  indefinitely, lest he had some encouraging news for her, she ran downstairs
  and opened the door.</p>

  <p>In contrast with the other deferential stranger, who had to efface his
  personality to meet the demands of salesmanship, Buckingham appeared
  confident and positive.</p>

  <p>'Sorry to crash in again,' he said, 'but I think I left my cigarette-case
  here. May I look?'</p>

  <p>Taking her permission for granted, he walked into the morning-room and
  slipped his fingers under the soft cushioned seat of a chair.</p>

  <p>'Found it,' he said, holding it up for her inspection. 'All these luxury
  chairs are traps.' Then he looked up sharply at the sound of a dull thud.</p>

  <p>'What's that?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I didn't hear anything,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'It was like someone closing the front door.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, how annoying. It must be the man who wants to sell me a vacuum
  cleaner. He promised he would wait...Idiot.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple spoke crossly because she felt vaguely disturbed, as though
  some muddled thoughts had been stirred into circulation.</p>

  <p>Buckingham followed her into the hall, where she picked up one of
  Watkins's business-cards, from the hall table.</p>

  <p>'Sorry. September the fourteenth,' was pencilled upon it.</p>

  <p>'What's going to happen on September the fourteenth?' asked Buckingham
  whose eyes were sharp as well as penetrative.</p>

  <p>As she did not reply, he asked another question.</p>

  <p>'Will this house be shut up when you are in Switzerland?'</p>

  <p>'Why? Are you going to give me advice about how to diddle burglars?'</p>

  <p>'No. It doesn't matter either way. Any one who wanted to break in could do
  it with one hand tied behind him, with all these balconies.'</p>

  <p>'A most encouraging thought. Are you an Insurance agent?'</p>

  <p>'No, for the time being, I am not classified...Fact is, I was a
  problem-child&mdash;and my problem is not yet solved.'</p>

  <p>'Well, anyway you've found your case,' remarked Miss Loveapple, opening
  the front door.</p>

  <p>'Yes, thanks.'</p>

  <p>Before he reached the threshold, Buckingham turned back into the hall.</p>

  <p>'Won't you show me over the house?' he asked. 'I promised to report on it
  to my sister, but I haven't seen it yet.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head, obeying an urge to exercise caution, since she was no
  longer chaperoned by the other gloved stranger.</p>

  <p>'It's not necessary,' she told him. 'Your sister likes it well enough to
  think of buying it. The agent rang me up about it. That's something you
  <i>don't</i> know apparently. Now, if you don't mind, I have things to do.
  Have you left anything else behind you? I warn you, I shall not open the door
  again to any one.'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter. We shall probably meet again.'</p>

  <p>'Where?'</p>

  <p>'Switzerland, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'Pleasant holiday&mdash;but I don't think we shall meet.'</p>

  <p>Feeling pleased with herself, Miss Loveapple shut the door. She was in
  excellent spirits again because her business acumen scented a profitable
  transaction. While she had bought No. 19, Madeira Crescent, cheap, her
  improvements justified her raising her price to show a substantial
  profit.</p>

  <p>Another cause for satisfaction was the way in which she had handled
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>'Tried to play me for a sucker,' she thought. 'He certainly knows
  <i>something</i> about the Brands's business, but that's about all. Well, I
  suppose I must unload.'</p>

  <p>When she reached the large bedroom, where her locked suitcase stood upon
  the floor, she changed her mind. It was packed in readiness for Switzerland,
  with every article tightly wedged into the minimum of space and interlocked
  with its fellow, after the fashion of a jigsaw puzzle. As the bulk of it
  consisted of spare underwear and extra shoes which she would not need at
  High-field, she decided not to disturb it, but leave it intact for her
  holiday.</p>

  <p>Everything she needed for her two nights in London was in her
  attaché-case, including a house pyjama-suit. She had bundled it inside at the
  last moment, to save creasing her satin skirt during the night in the train,
  were she lucky enough to lie down on the seat.</p>

  <p>'I must make up the bed, anyway,' she muttered.</p>

  <p>She mounted the next flight of stairs up to the linen-closet, and began to
  get down sheets and towels from the shelves. As a rule she yielded to the
  temptation to gloat over her store&mdash;to count the various piles in order
  to check them with her inventory&mdash;to redistribute the bags of lavender;
  but, this afternoon, she was only conscious of a wish to finish as soon as
  possible.</p>

  <p>She could not account for her unusual sensations. While she was afraid of
  nothing, she felt apprehensive and jumpy as though every faculty were keyed
  up to keep her on the alert. She found herself straining to listen and
  starting at the slightest sound&mdash;the creak of a board or the rustle of a
  window curtain.</p>

  <p>Presently she grew aware that her nerves were rasped, while her skin
  pricked and tingled as though at the intrusion of an antagonistic
  element.</p>

  <p>'Those silly people who are afraid of cats pretend to know if there's one
  in the room,' she thought. 'Perhaps there is something in it, after all. But
  what the dickens can there be in the house to affect <i>me</i> like
  this?'</p>

  <p>Clutching her armful of linen, she bolted down the stairs to her bedroom,
  where she made up the bed at record speed. She was impelled by the same sense
  of urgency&mdash;the vital need to be quick&mdash;to get away. When a distant
  tapping&mdash;as though someone was hammering nails down in the
  basement&mdash;made her jump&mdash;she summoned up her common sense and
  refused to go down to investigate.</p>

  <p>Feeling the need of a change of scene, she decided to go out and do her
  shopping. She was making a list of what she would require during the
  week-end, when she remembered suddenly the collector for the blind. In spite
  of the need for personal economy, her instincts were generous and her
  response to his appeal had been characteristic.</p>

  <p>'Gosh, I gave him the note,' she reminded herself, as, zipping open her
  bag, she began to count her loose change.</p>

  <p>It amount to four shillings and ninepence halfpenny.</p>

  <p>'I must cash a cheque,' she muttered.</p>

  <p>The next second, she recollected the fact that it was Saturday. The bank
  would be closed and also the house-agent's office. Once again her plans
  seemed doomed to dislocation as she reviewed the position. If she spent all
  her money on food, she would be penniless over the week-end and she disliked
  the idea of having no money, lest an emergency should arise. In any case, she
  could not cater according to her usual standard, for she liked her three good
  meals a day.</p>

  <p>'Better go home while the going's good,' she decided.</p>

  <p>A single railway ticket to Highfield cost four shillings and twopence and
  the Tube fare was sixpence&mdash;so she had a margin of three halfpence, if
  she played for safety.</p>

  <p>'Those dam' Twins,' she muttered wrathfully.</p>

  <p>But although she was irritated by the waste of time and money and the
  general futility of her journey, she experienced a lightening of spirit
  similar to the relief which followed her earlier decision. She was eager to
  be on her way&mdash;to sit in the railway carriage and watch the shorn fields
  stream by, until she was able to pick up the first landmark which told her
  that she was near her journey's end.</p>

  <p>Too impatient to take the sheets off the bed, she left them in readiness
  for September the thirteenth, when she would pass the night in London. As she
  picked up her suitcase, however, she stopped and then replaced it on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>An unpleasant thought had just slid into her mind. She told herself that
  she had no proof that the vacuum cleaner salesman had left the house. She had
  only heard the bang of the door, whereas he could have opened and shut it
  himself before slipping back up the stairs.</p>

  <p>It was an old trick which she had seen performed in films, while he
  himself had the soft thick gaze of a cinema-villain of the sugar-coated
  variety.</p>

  <p>'He knew I should be alone, to-night,' she thought. 'Well, if he thinks
  he's going to be a Romeo, he's jolly well mistaken...If he's still here, I'll
  soon run him out.'</p>

  <p>It never occurred to her that there was any element of risk in her
  man-hunt, although she was always furious with the heroines of the screen,
  when they rushed into danger while usurping a G man's job. She hurried
  through the house, opening every door behind which a man might have concealed
  himself, but she was not so thorough as in her previous search.</p>

  <p>There was a train to catch, for the service was not frequent to Highfield.
  Conscious of being pressed for time, she raced down to the kitchen, to find
  that the tapping sound came from a dripping tap. Wrenching it round, she
  rinsed the milk bottle and placed it outside the back door, while she solved
  the problem of how to dispose of the bread.</p>

  <p>If she threw it into the area for the birds, the sun would soon bake it to
  the consistency of grit; on the other hand, she could not leave it to attract
  mice. In the end, she made a parcel of it, to take it away.</p>

  <p>Tucking it under her arm, she rushed upstairs to the first floor, where
  she had left her suitcase. She snatched it up and then stopped to listen.</p>

  <p>She could have sworn that she heard stealthy footsteps moving somewhere
  overhead.</p>

  <p>'I never searched the attics,' she thought.</p>

  <p>In spite of the episode of the dripping tap, she was mounting to the top
  storey, when she glanced at her watch...The next second she turned and raced
  down to the hall&mdash;leaping the last steps&mdash;in panic lest she should
  lose her train. Slamming the front door behind her, she ran all the way along
  the Crescent until she reached the Tube station.</p>

  <p>It was not until she stood on the escalator, that a sub-conscious
  impression floated into her mind&mdash;so dim as to appear a figment of
  imagination. While she was thudding down over the thickly carpeted stairs, it
  had seemed to her that the sounds were dully duplicated from above.</p>

  <p>At the time, she was obsessed by the need to make her connection, so had
  neither stopped nor turned her head; and even now she was completely vague as
  to what had really occurred.</p>

  <p>'I was fussing about nothing,' she told herself. 'Besides, even if I've
  left Romeo shut up in the house, he can let himself out...Who cares?'</p>

  <p>In spite of the heat and the crowded carriages, she enjoyed every yard of
  the journey back, from the moment she got into the Tube up to the time the
  local train steamed into Highfield Station. It was an adventure to swing
  along the lane, raising a cloud of dust, and to steal across the beech-shaded
  lawn of the Pond House.</p>

  <p>She rang the bell, so as to give Elsie a surprise. When the maid appeared,
  she tried to compose her face.</p>

  <p>'Is Miss Loveapple at home?' she asked.</p>

  <p>Before she finished speaking, she was in shrieks of laughter, while Elsie
  joined in her hysterical mirth. In the midst of the excitement, Scottie
  rushed up barking. He was followed by David&mdash;running low over the
  ground, like an animated muff&mdash;and the welcome was complete.</p>

  <p>'What have you got there, madam?' asked Elsie presently, as she took Miss
  Love-apple's parcel from her.</p>

  <p>'Bread,' she replied. 'I didn't leave it behind. That's a good mark for
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, madam. Where's your attaché-case?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple smote her forehead.</p>

  <p>'I've left it behind,' she declared. 'Bringing the bread made me forget
  it. I knew I had both my hands full...Really, Elsie, I've never known such a
  mess. Instead of having a personal interview with Mr Lemon, I shall have to
  ring him up, which is not so good. And it's all because I handed out ten
  shillings to a collector for the blind, who had a marvellous line...I cannot
  think what's happened to my luck to-day. It's dead out.'</p>

  <p>On that occasion, by the irony of fate, Miss Loveapple was unable to
  realize her supreme good fortune. The collector who had halved her
  contribution, received five shillings which was poor payment for his
  unconscious intervention.</p>

  <p>For that night, a gloved gentleman visited No. 19, Madeira Crescent,
  N.W.&mdash;and found it empty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; ALL CATS ARE GREY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following day was one of the happiest that Miss
  Loveapple could remember. Her steady glow of gratitude began when she awoke
  to the peace of the country, instead of the gloomy splendour of her London
  bedroom. Elsie always 'slept in' on Sunday morning and her example was
  followed by David who was curled round his basket and holding his nose
  tightly with both huge paws.</p>

  <p>As a rule, Miss Loveapple also lay in bed until the arrival of the early
  tea; but this morning, she felt too energetic to wait. Slipping on a
  washed-out kimono, she went downstairs and opened the front door, letting in
  the sunlight.</p>

  <p>The Sunday papers were lying on the step. She took a <i>Times</i> and
  <i>Observer</i> alternately, for the sake of maintaining an even mental
  keel&mdash;although she never knew which of the two she was reading. Elsie,
  however, was faithful to the <i>News of The World</i> which was her literary
  fodder for the entire week.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple used to joke about her love of sensation, but she knew that
  the maid's life would be shorn of some of its interest were the supply of
  victims to dry up. That morning, for the first time, she shuddered at the
  realization that actual horrors were enacted to provide entertainment for the
  Elsies of the world.</p>

  <p>'People who were alive last Sunday, are dead to-day. Murdered some of
  them. Ghastly. When life is so beautiful.'</p>

  <p>After she had made the tea, she poured out a cup for herself and then
  carried the tray up to the maid's room. Elsie&mdash;with her hair arranged
  under a setting-net and wearing pale green pyjamas of artificial
  satin&mdash;looked like the mistress of the house, for she was in a more
  favoured position and could spend her wages on her back.</p>

  <p>She started awake in great distress.</p>

  <p>'Oh, madam,' she cried reproachfully, 'you shouldn't ought to wait on me.
  Why didn't you tap on the wall when you woke up?'</p>

  <p>'Don't splutter, Elsie. There's a marvellous bag of murders for you this
  morning. Your <i>News of The World</i> won't owe you much. But aren't you
  smart&mdash;all in green?'</p>

  <p>Elsie's pale face flushed at the praise.</p>

  <p>'I thought you would like me to match the room,' she confessed.</p>

  <p>'You silly sap.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's comment was characteristic and calculated to put the maid
  at her ease, since it was a language she understood. As she went downstairs,
  however, she wanted to boast to the world of this new proof of Elsie's
  loyalty. She drank her tea and then wandered into the back garden, walking
  bare-footed on the grass while her long fair hair streamed in the breeze.</p>

  <p>It was much cooler, with a constant flicker of green leaves against a
  white clouded sky. Looking rather like Shelley's lady of 'The Sensitive
  Plant,' she strolled around her domain. Although she was always inarticulate
  when her sense of beauty was stirred, she was acutely conscious of the purity
  of the light, the colours of the flowers and the unfamiliar shadows of the
  sunrise.</p>

  <p>Presently she shattered the illusion of poesy to do physical jerks. She
  felt recharged with energy which could only be realized by violent exercise.
  Each bound and stamp might have been symbolic of the triumph of resurrection
  over annihilation&mdash;even although she recked nothing of an evil thought
  which had faded with the other shadows of the night&mdash;the dim image of a
  broken body, shapeless as one of Elsie's dummies, huddled on the floor in the
  gloom of a London house.</p>

  <p>But although she had escaped the immediate danger, she was only reprised.
  Even then, in a darkish London flat, a pleasant-faced young man stretched out
  his arm for the telephone. Speedily he dialled a number and then spoke
  cautiously into the receiver.</p>

  <p>'That you? Listen. Something slipped up last night...No, no, it's in the
  bag for September the thirteenth.'</p>

  <p>One of the concessions to human susceptibility is the comforting knowledge
  that a condemned prisoner eats a hearty last breakfast. Certainly Miss
  Loveapple enjoyed her meal that morning, for it was the usual Sunday
  menu&mdash;bacon and sausages. Afterwards, while she waited for the church
  bells to ring, she strolled on to the lawn where Elsie shelled peas.</p>

  <p>She looked unfamiliar and not nearly so attractive in her best frock and
  hat, and she tugged at her gloves. She craved a cigarette, but would not
  smoke until after Divine Service, according to one of her rules.</p>

  <p>'Have you got your collection?' asked Elsie. 'You don't want to be caught
  short, with nothing but a note, like yesterday, do you, madam?'</p>

  <p>The reminder was a hint to be told something about the London visit
  without reference to business. Although Miss Loveapple talked freely to her,
  she confided her money-matters to no one, besides her lawyer and
  bank-manager. As a consequence, Elsie had the greatest respect for her
  mistress as an exponent of high finance and placed her on a level with any
  magnate with a string of secretaries and a row of press-bells.</p>

  <p>'Yesterday,' repeated Miss Loveapple. 'I didn't tell you what happened.
  Three young men called at the house. And they <i>all</i> wore gloves.'</p>

  <p>'It just shows,' murmured Elsie darkly.</p>

  <p>'It does. All three of them couldn't have been criminals.'</p>

  <p>'You never know...Oh, madam, look at the angel.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple gazed down at David who lay spread-eagled on his back,
  kicking vigorously while he savaged a pea-pod he had stolen. Suddenly she
  began to laugh at a momentary reminder of a soap
  advertisement&mdash;somebody's baby, sprawling on a towel after its bath.</p>

  <p>'Elsie, aren't we funny?' she said. 'Here were are, two grown women,
  holding our breath over a cat, when we ought to have babies of our own.'</p>

  <p>'He's <i>not</i> a cat,' objected Elsie passionately. 'He's David.'</p>

  <p>'I know. I know. But wouldn't you like a baby, Elsie?'</p>

  <p>'I'd like one of yours to look after. I only want the things that belong
  to you.'</p>

  <p>'That would include a husband. If that's how you feel about it, no, thank
  you, Elsie. There's the bell. Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's super-appreciation of her blessings lasted during service
  in the chilly stone church at the top of the mount. When it was over, she
  crossed the churchyard and waited beside the parapet which encircled the
  summit. She was gazing out, over the trees and house-tops to the distant line
  of hills, when the Rector's wife came down the path, flagged with
  tombstones.</p>

  <p>'I'm staying over for the Garden Fête,' called out Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'Good girl,' approved the Rector's wife. Will you undertake entire charge
  of the refreshments? I want you to organise and make the others work.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple beamed at the tribute to her administrative ability.</p>

  <p>'On one condition,' she promised. 'Elsie must help at the produce
  stall.'</p>

  <p>'Won't she be more useful waiting at the teas?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;but that wouldn't be any change for her. Oh, I know you all
  think she's lazy and too big for her boots, but she gives me something that
  money can't buy. She's devoted to me. I know she would follow me "to the
  gallows'-foot&mdash;and after."'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple laughed to prove that she was not emotional, as she added,
  'I'll throw in my mint jelly and my prune cheese, as a bargaining basis.'</p>

  <p>When the Rector's wife glumly nodded assent she clattered triumphantly
  down the two long flights of steps. At the bottom, Miss Agatha Pitt, with a
  pack of dogs, waited for her.</p>

  <p>'What's London like?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Grim,' replied Miss Loveapple. 'That's why I came back.'</p>

  <p>'Then it's not because of the new attraction. I thought you had heard. Mrs
  Ram has promised to tell fortunes at the Fête. You can't have forgotten
  her.'</p>

  <p>'Mrs Ram.' As she listened, Miss Love-apple's thoughts went back to a wild
  All Hallows E'en&mdash;the shuffle of dried leaves&mdash;firelight leaping in
  amber beads and twin flames reflected in magnetic black eyes.</p>

  <p>'Is she going to bring her jigger with her?' she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Her planchette? No, not at a church affair. Too suggestive of witchcraft.
  She's got to confine herself to palmistry and cards. Of course, it will be
  <i>called</i> "Character reading." But every one will flock to her, after the
  way she foretold you.'</p>

  <p>'I was a fluke. She flopped with the rest of you.'</p>

  <p>'But we were only playing the fool. Asking idiotic questions just to egg
  her on.'</p>

  <p>'I know you were. Well, I must have another dip into the future with her,
  because soon, I expect to be in the news again.'</p>

  <p>'I hope it is a young man, this time.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple grimaced as she shook her head; but on her way home to the
  Pond House she was reproached by the memory of two inconsequent
  sentences&mdash;'A girl like you' and 'We shall meet again.' At the time she
  had been indignant at Buckingham's audacity; but in retrospect, they
  flattered her vanity by marking a division between herself and the mature
  spinsters of the parish.</p>

  <p>Throughout the day she continued to congratulate herself on escaping a
  solitary Sunday in London. She over-ate and over-smoked and slaughtered
  garden bugs without deference to the humane methods of 'The Sensitive Plant'
  lady. Consequently she awoke, on Monday, to vain regret and lost
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>Mr Lemon shared her opinion when she rang up the estate office. He was a
  fluent speaker and believed that business could not be legitimate without the
  maximum number of words during its transaction.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry you could not stay over the week-end,' he said. 'There are
  aspects about this offer which I should like to enlarge on. As it is, I can
  only give you the bones. I told you there is a prospect of selling No. 19,
  Madeira Crescent to Major Brand. Since then, I think I can do better than
  that for you. I have met both the Brands and been favourably impressed.
  Excellent people, very sound and all that. But, definitely, the Major wears
  the trousers.'</p>

  <p>'Well, he was born with them,' interposed Miss Loveapple inaccurately.</p>

  <p>'Quite. What I am driving at is this. His wife is a little under his thumb
  and I imagine he does not think much of her taste. She's fluffy, you know,
  while he's solid. He likes good things. Sound stuff. I don't think he would
  trust her to furnish the house, always supposing he should buy it. Now, it
  has occurred to me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He might like to buy my furniture,' finished Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'Exactly. I suppose you don't know how much you paid for it? Have you a
  rough idea? Did you keep your receipts?'</p>

  <p>'I know the price of every article and the aggregate value.'</p>

  <p>'Really? Surprising. Then if you will send me all the details, I will
  decide the price we will try to push him up to. And this is where <i>you</i>
  come in. It is difficult not to put it crudely, so I hope you won't be
  offended when I say I am sure you will get a better price if you have a
  personal interview with him.'</p>

  <p>'Why <i>me?'</i></p>

  <p>'Because, as a man of the world, I have to sum people up. I don't mean to
  infer that the Major is not a model husband and father, but I fancy he is
  susceptible. And I am sure you will make a specially good impression. You
  see, he complained bitterly to me of the standard of the modern chorus girl.
  He compares them unfavourably with George Edwardes's Gibson Girls...Do you
  understand?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple flushed with pleasure.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said. 'I am his type. When do I meet him?'</p>

  <p>'I will arrange the meeting for September the fourteenth, at my office,
  ten-thirty sharp. He is catching the boat-train in the afternoon. They won't
  be back in London before then. They are going on to Scotland and Ireland,
  after Wales. I got a letter from him by first post, this morning...So you see
  how important it is for you to keep the date?'</p>

  <p>'You can count me in,' promised Miss Loveapple. 'I can just fit it in with
  my holiday.'</p>

  <p>When she explained her arrangements, Mr Lemon was horrified.</p>

  <p>'It's risky to cut it so fine when you're coming bad from the Continent,'
  he said. 'The Channel may be too rough for you to cross. Can't you alter the
  date of your visit to Switzerland?'</p>

  <p>'Impossible. I've just booked myself for a local Fête. I can't leave them
  in the lurch. Don't worry, I will be there...But even if I was held up, I can
  trust <i>you</i> to do my talking for me.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Miss Loveapple. But remember, I am counting on the personal
  touch.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was in high spirits when she rang off. Contrary to her
  custom not to refer to a transaction until it was a certainty, she confided
  in Elsie her hope of selling No. 19, Madeira Crescent, together with its
  contents.</p>

  <p>'The place is lousy with other people's thoughts,' she said. 'I wish I had
  not to spend even one night there. But now my luck is in again, after
  Saturday. So is yours, Elsie. I've got some news for you.'</p>

  <p>When she told the maid that she was to be elevated to the rank of
  saleswoman at the Fête, instead of running round with the other maids, the
  girl made several ineffectual efforts to speak.</p>

  <p>'You know me,' she blurted out. 'I keep myself to myself. I have my proper
  pride...But when I let myself go for any one, I go the whole blooming
  hog.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple understood. Elsie was trying to tell her that she would not
  only walk with her to the gallows-foot, but even substitute her own neck for
  the drop.</p>

  <p>The prospect of sacrifice was not so remote as it seemed. During the
  Sunday, an idea was shaping in Elsie's brain. Like most gloomy people, she
  worshipped humour. The episode of her mistress' snap homecoming had appealed
  to her as exquisite comedy and had thrilled her imagination.</p>

  <p>In her turn she began to wonder whether she could take Miss Loveapple by
  surprise. She could leave the pets in Miss Pitt's charge on the night of
  September the thirteenth and keep Miss Loveapple company in London during the
  night.</p>

  <p>She pictured her own excitement as she crept into the darkness of the
  empty house and waited for her mistress to insert her latch key in the lock.
  Directly she heard it, she would switch on the light, fling open the door and
  say, 'Miss Loveapple is not at home'&mdash;if she could keep herself from
  laughing before she made the announcement.</p>

  <p>She could see no flaw in her plan. The clerks at the estate office knew
  her by sight and would raise no objection to letting her have a key,
  especially as they knew that Miss Loveapple was expected back from the
  Continent that evening.</p>

  <p>Events were shaping well for the young man in a darkish London flat. In
  the twilight, all the cats are grey&mdash;and one woman was as good as
  another for his special purpose.</p>

  <p>It was merely a question of which was first to enter No. 19, Madeira
  Crescent, London, on the night of September the thirteenth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE CARDS TALK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the next few days, Miss Loveapple was wrung by a
  fever of unrest. She wanted to go away to Switzerland without delay. At night
  she dreamed of snow-mountains with iced peaks, towering to incredible
  heights. During the day she kept seeing continually the triple range of the
  Eiger, the Mönch and the Jungfrau.</p>

  <p>When her desire was at its height, she became possessed of the means to
  satisfy it. Mr Lemon sent her Major Brand's cheque for the advance rent of
  No. 19, Madeira Crescent. The figure was higher than she dared expect, since
  even she had to acknowledge that the house was in an unfashionable
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts flew at once to Buckingham.</p>

  <p>'Wonder if he had anything to do with it. That was an excuse he made to
  come back. He wanted to see me again.'</p>

  <p>Then her face lit up at a sudden thought. She realized that now there was
  nothing to hinder her from starting off to Grindelwald. She could enjoy every
  minute of her fortnight, without any worry at the end, lest she should lose
  her connection and miss her interview with Major Brand. What was more, she
  could cut out the night at London altogether. If she altered her timetable
  for the return journey, she could come back directly to the Pond House and
  take the workman's train up from Highfield, on the morning of the fourteenth
  of September.</p>

  <p>'I do want to be <i>welcomed</i> in,' she thought. 'To know someone is
  expecting me. Waiting for me.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, Miss Loveapple's Luck had nearly won the game. Miss
  Loveapple was on the point of yielding to her impulse when she remembered
  that she had blocked the way by a fatal premature move.</p>

  <p>She was pledged to remain for the Fête, because of Elsie. She knew that if
  she were to break her promise to the Rector's wife, she could not expect
  preferential treatment for her maid. Unable to disappoint the girl, she
  resolved to keep to her original plan and travel to Switzerland the day after
  the Fête.</p>

  <p>She completed all her arrangements for the journey. Railway tickets were
  bought, reservations made and her room booked at a quiet but good-class
  Pension-hotel. Less than a week divided her from her holiday when she had a
  complete change of feeling.</p>

  <p>She found herself dreading the prospect of parting with Elsie and her
  beloved animals. A ridiculous lump arose in her throat whenever Scottie did
  his famous marathon around the lawn or David displayed his starfish
  sprawl.</p>

  <p>The weather, too, had changed and was perfect, with a stiff breeze to whip
  up the clouds and keep them rolling over a deep blue sky.</p>

  <p>Her house had never appeared more desirable or her garden so beautiful.
  The autumn flowers arrived early, while the summer blooms yet lingered, so
  that chrysanthemums, Michaelmas daisies and dahlias met the gladioli,
  marigolds, and poppies they were scheduled to replace.</p>

  <p>'It's a crime to leave it,' she declared, gazing at her Kelway border,
  where patches of colour&mdash;purple, pink, blue, orange, scarlet and yellow
  blended in a vivid rainbow blur.</p>

  <p>'But you will be picking great bunches of edelweisses,' Elsie reminded
  her.</p>

  <p>Neglecting her <i>News of The World,</i> the maid spent her spare time
  studying the fashions in the advertisement columns of Miss Love-apple's
  papers, to find inspiration for a new dress.</p>

  <p>'I want to look like a lady, and not like a film-star,' she confided to
  her mistress.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple went on doggedly with the preparation of preserves and
  pickles for the Produce Stall; but three days before the Fête, she knocked
  off work and caught the bus which passed through Highfield on its way to more
  important places.</p>

  <p>After a three-mile ride, she got out before the inn of a large village
  which only just missed the status of a small town. There were shops in its
  street, which sold fish and meat&mdash;objectionable trade, according to the
  Highfield standard. There was also a bank, a small cinema and the
  professional premises of a doctor, a dentist and a lawyer.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple hated the errand to which she was committed. She gritted
  her teeth with determination as she lowered her head to enter the doorway of
  an ancient lath-and-plaster building. The interior of the office was dark as
  a cavern and had the traditional smell of mouldy paper, but the lawyer
  himself was a florid cheerful soul.</p>

  <p>'I want to make my Will,' Miss Loveapple told him.</p>

  <p>'A proper precaution,' he said, beaming at her. 'It has surprised me that
  you've not done so before. You are so business-like.'</p>

  <p>'Well, make it short and simple. I must sign it before I go to
  Grindelwald.'</p>

  <p>The lawyer knew all about her visit, since he lived at Highfield and
  competed with her for floral honours.</p>

  <p>'You'll cut up very nicely,' he remarked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, do you really think so?' Miss Loveapple beamed at the compliment to
  her estate. 'Now I want everything to be realized and one-half of the
  proceeds to go to my maid&mdash;Elsie Wordsworth&mdash;and the other half to
  charities. Here is the list. Elsie will take my cat and dog, but I want a
  trust for them.'</p>

  <p>'Doubtful of the maid?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not. But she's not strong, and so devoted to me that I am
  afraid that she might crash herself if anything happened to me. Here's a list
  of people I can trust to see that my pets are cared for until they die. As
  you see, Miss Pitt comes first.'</p>

  <p>The lawyer jotted down her instructions. He was too accustomed to making
  last Wills and Testaments to find anything incongruous in the fact of death
  in connection with so vital a client. As he shook hands with her, on parting,
  he made a joke.</p>

  <p>'Don't tell the maid about the Will or you might get rat-poison in your
  tea.'</p>

  <p>It was a relief to Miss Loveapple when the business was settled finally.
  She paid another visit to the lawyer's office&mdash;when the Will was signed
  and witnessed, the evening before the Garden Fête. This time, the lawyer
  congratulated her on her radiant appearance.</p>

  <p>'I prophesy it will be a very long time before any one benefits through
  you,' he said.</p>

  <p>When the next day dawned, Miss Loveapple was glad she had stayed for the
  Fête. It was always an important local event, but this year, the excitement
  was increased by Lady Pontypool's patronage.</p>

  <p>When Miss Loveapple and Elsie reached the grounds of Highfield
  Park&mdash;where the Fête was held&mdash;they presented a marked contrast.
  Elsie had displayed her usual good taste over her new frock and looked like
  any girl of the leisured classes. On the other hand, Miss Loveapple had made
  no attempt to compete with her maid, but wore a short-sleeved white linen
  dress which buttoned down the front and displayed her fine sunburnt arms.</p>

  <p>As they entered the Marquee, Miss Pitt drew Miss Loveapple aside.</p>

  <p>'Mrs Ram is supposed to be a mystery palmist,' she whispered. 'She calls
  herself "Zora". Don't recognise her, or she'll be disappointed.'</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple promised, a burst of clapping heralded the entrance of
  Lady Pontypool. She was a beautiful woman&mdash;apart from the fact that she
  was aided by every device of fashion and artifice. Her gown was an
  inspiration to her sex, while her speech was a perfect example of its kind.
  In a few words, she managed to convince her audience that she had never
  attended before such a charming function nor been welcomed by such a
  delightful people.</p>

  <p>What was more to the point, she set an example to the public by making a
  round of the stalls. Just as she reached the Produce Stall, the rector's
  wife, who accompanied her, was called away by the head of the tea-committee.
  In the absence of the usual introductions, therefore, Lady Pontypool glanced
  at the stall-holders and selected Elsie as saleswoman, to Miss Loveapple's
  secret annoyance.</p>

  <p>She was disappointed because she had looked forward to being presented to
  this glamorous leader of Society; but she concealed her feelings as she drew
  the other helper aside. She noticed that Elsie was recommending a pot of
  heather-honey with the maximum of respect, before her attention was engaged
  by another customer. She was the more surprised, a little later, to find that
  Lady Pontypool was still at the stall and carrying on an animated
  conversation with her maid.</p>

  <p>'I hope Elsie isn't putting on dog,' she thought.</p>

  <p>The next second she was ashamed of her unworthy suspicion, for the girl
  flushed with pleasure as she caught her eye.</p>

  <p><i>'This</i> is my mistress,' she said proudly to Lady Pontypool.</p>

  <p>Lady Pontypool greeted her with pleasure which she contrived to make sound
  sincere.</p>

  <p>'Your maid has been establishing a link between us,' she said. 'I hear
  that her sister is parlour maid to my cousin. I know her well.' (She did not
  add 'by sight'.) 'She has been telling me, too, about the pleasure you
  arranged for her. So understanding of you...And now I must buy something from
  <i>you.</i> Something that you made yourself.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was not too dazzled by Lady Pontypool's personality to
  charge a profiteering price for her damson-cheese. While she was selling it,
  she managed to slip in the information that she was crossing to the
  Continent, the following day.</p>

  <p>'So am I,' cried Lady Pontypool. 'Quite a coincidence. Where are you
  going?'</p>

  <p>'Grindelwald.'</p>

  <p><i>'Ah,</i> lovely place. I envy you. I'm motoring. Dalmatia. May return
  by way of Switzerland. So we may meet again.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't it be strange if we met in Paris? I've got to buy a hat. I don't
  wear them as a rule, but <i>yours</i> makes me feel there must be something
  in the idea.'</p>

  <p>'Then I must tell you the name of my milliner. You must keep it a
  secret.'</p>

  <p>Elsie produced a pencil and paper and Miss Loveapple was entrusted with a
  confidence denied to Lady Pontypool's own circle. Then her ladyship finished
  her round of stalls, had tea with the rector's wife&mdash;who scolded her for
  smoking too much&mdash;and drove away.</p>

  <p>After she had left, the glamour faded from the Fête. Miss Loveapple felt
  none of her usual keenness to scoop in the maximum sum. As she gazed around
  at the familiar features of any small country entertainment, she became both
  critical and bored. So few young people&mdash;such a shortage of men. It
  needed someone with the audacity of a Buckingham to ginger up interest. There
  would be definite merit in trying to sell him a jar of pickles he did not
  want.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she remembered the palmist.</p>

  <p>'It's all rubbish&mdash;but I'll have my fortune told,' she decided.</p>

  <p>On her way to Zora's tent she was stopped by Miss Pitt.</p>

  <p>'Lady Pontypool brought us some Egyptian jewellery,' she said. 'Buy a
  scarab from a mummy's tomb, to bring you luck. You know you are
  superstitious.'</p>

  <p>'I'm <i>not,'</i> declared Miss Loveapple as she chose a blue-green
  beetle.</p>

  <p>When she reached the palmist's lair she was received by a local lady who
  acted as receptionist and intelligence officer. She took Miss Loveapple's
  shilling and disappeared through curtains into the inner compartment. After a
  rush of whispers, Miss Loveapple was admitted into a hot smoky cave of
  mystery, which was dimly lit by a purple lantern. An oriental pastille failed
  to disguise the odour of Mrs Ram's brand of cigarette, but the palmist
  herself was completely transformed.</p>

  <p>She wore a huddle of black draperies and her head and face were covered by
  a wine-red veil, under which gleamed a metallic-gold mask, slitted for eyes
  and lips. It looked so unhuman that Miss Loveapple felt a shock of relief
  when the graven image began to speak in an artificial voice.</p>

  <p>'Cards or hand?'</p>

  <p>'Cards, please.'</p>

  <p>The idol spread out part of the pack upon a small table and began to count
  with golden-gloved fingers.</p>

  <p>'You will have a letter containing an invitation,' she said. 'I think it
  is to a wedding. Yes, here is a ring, in combination with hearts. Within a
  month, you may expect a present from an elderly man. Very soon you will get a
  surprise. I also see a journey. You are going to cross the water.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' remarked Miss Loveapple, 'I am going to Grindelwald. It is not
  exclusive news. Every one knows it.'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i> see it in the cards. On this journey you will meet new friends.
  There are men in your fortune. One is thinking of you now.'</p>

  <p>'Must be the one I gave short change to.'</p>

  <p>Bored with the conventional items, Miss Loveapple began to try and
  interpret the cards herself.</p>

  <p>'Isn't that the death card?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Not necessarily,' replied the idol. 'Only in combination with other
  cards.'</p>

  <p>'But there's the ace of spades reversed, with ten and nine of spades.
  That's bad, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'You certainly should be careful.'</p>

  <p>'What of?'</p>

  <p>'A man.'</p>

  <p>'Is he my enemy?'</p>

  <p>'No, you are surrounded by friends. This man is definitely hostile to
  another man.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly the idol forgot her metallic voice and lapsed into contralto.</p>

  <p>It is all most confusing,' she complained. 'No one wishes you
  ill&mdash;yet there is a threat to your safety. It is my duty to warn you
  that there is danger.'</p>

  <p>'Good thing I've made my will. Is the dangerous man someone I know?'</p>

  <p>'No, he is a stranger.'</p>

  <p>'Then why pick on <i>me?</i> It doesn't make sense.' Aware that she was
  beginning to take her fortune seriously, Miss Loveapple began to laugh. 'He
  must be an engine-driver. I'm going to be in a railway smash.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said the idol, 'the danger is at the house...May I look at your hand
  for a moment?'</p>

  <p>As the disguised Mrs Ram held her outstretched palm, Miss Loveapple
  thought that her fingers trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>'Oh, what a lucky hand,' declared the palmist. 'You have everything: a
  husband, happiness, children, prosperity, a long life. Only&mdash;there is
  the same indication of danger.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks.' Miss Loveapple glanced at her watch and exclaimed, 'Golly,
  Elsie's had no tea. I must fly back to relieve her.'</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Mrs Ram accompanied her to the entrance.</p>

  <p>'Please be very, <i>very</i> careful,' she urged, speaking in her natural
  voice. 'It's not a joke. Remember I told you your fortune before&mdash;and it
  came true.'</p>

  <p>She had barely returned to her tent when Miss Pitt poked her head through
  the flap at the back.</p>

  <p>'Are you free to tell me my fortune?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Not now,' replied Mrs Ram in an agitated voice. 'Please go away. I must
  have a whiff, to soothe my nerves before my next client. I'll explain
  later.'</p>

  <p>The Fête dragged on to its end, in boredom for Miss Loveapple and golden
  hours for Elsie. Presently the rector made his speech of general thanks, in
  which he announced the total of the receipts. Every one clapped and the
  village band played 'God Save the King.'</p>

  <p>When the last coloured light was out and the park nearly deserted, Miss
  Loveapple stopped packing up and spoke to Elsie.</p>

  <p>'I've just remembered I left my attaché-case in London. I'll see if I can
  borrow one from Mrs Bosanquet.'</p>

  <p>Since it was her boast never to borrow, the rector's wife was the only
  person she could approach. She knew that the ex-hospital matron could always
  be relied on to cope with an emergency.</p>

  <p>On this occasion she did not fail Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'No, my dear,' she said, 'I can't spare one of mine. Always in use. But
  there's something here that might meet the case. Lady Pontypool's maid packed
  that Egyptian rubbish in an old jewel-case. She left it behind her as
  junk...Here it is.'</p>

  <p>Fishing behind some stacked trestles, she held up an expensive but
  somewhat worn case.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple accepted it with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'It's beautiful leather. Much nicer than a new cheap case. I'd like to
  borrow it for my holiday.'</p>

  <p>'It's yours. But keep the coronet out of sight.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's acquisition of the jewel-case marked a critical stage in
  the game of two great opposing Forces. The Fête&mdash;in its regulation of
  Miss Loveapple's time-table&mdash;placed the blind malignant Fate in a
  position of almost certain victory; but, on the point of being beaten, the
  Luck pushed forward Lady Pontypool upon the board.</p>

  <p>There was still a faint chance.</p>

  <p>One person, however, nursed no illusions of safety. As Miss Loveapple and
  Elsie, laden with piled-up property, staggered home to the Pond House, Miss
  Pitt entered the palmist's tent. Mrs Ram had removed her gilt mask and was
  smoking as she counted up her takings, not yet given in.</p>

  <p>'What was the matter with you when I came in before?' asked Miss Pitt.</p>

  <p>Her question was the signal for Mrs Ram to dramatise herself.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my dear,' she said. 'I'd just had a most terrible shock. I was
  reading the cards for someone&mdash;I cannot tell you <i>who</i>&mdash;and I
  saw a violent death. It was in her hand, too&mdash;a break in the
  life-line...She is going to be murdered.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; WHITE HEATHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE felt her first thrill of anticipation when
  she reached Victoria Station the following afternoon. Until then the parting
  had hung heavily over her, from the moment she awoke in the greyness before
  the dawn. Too restless to lie in bed, she got up and went down to an
  unfamiliar garden.</p>

  <p>Everything looked flat and colourless as in a photograph. Pallid
  toadstools cropped up in clusters amid the grass. Long spectral strands of
  bedewed cobweb floated in the air. There was a chill in the atmosphere which
  reduced her to deeper depression as she stood and shivered in her cotton
  kimono.</p>

  <p>'It might be before the beginning of Wells' History,' she thought, with a
  rare flight of imagination. 'Lightless and so terribly lonely. I feel
  unborn.'</p>

  <p>Later, when the sunrise had performed its magic of transformation and
  breakfast had restored her to normality, the beauty of her flower-borders
  filled her with vain regrets.</p>

  <p>'What gets me down is knowing that I've actually <i>paid</i> to leave it
  all,' she confided to Scottie. 'The sooner I go and get it over the
  better.'</p>

  <p>Fortunately when she caught the earlier train there were no harrowing
  scenes of farewell. Elsie summoned up her fortitude to wish her 'Good-bye,'
  with stoical indifference, while the pets mistook her emotion for weakness
  and tried to lead her to the meat-safe. But all the way up to London, she
  watched each landmark with the fond eyes of one going into exile.</p>

  <p>'In fifteen days' time I shall be seeing it all again,' she reminded
  herself for comfort.</p>

  <p>Although it was cooler in London than on her last visit, no rain had
  fallen to wash the streets. The buildings looked grimed and the cheap
  tea-shop where she had a light lunch was overcrowded and understaffed.</p>

  <p>After trying to kill time at the National Gallery, she decided to wait at
  Victoria Station. Almost instantly, her mood changed in response to her
  surroundings. The hurrying passengers, the new novels on the bookstalls, the
  tea-trolleys, the trucks of piled luggage&mdash;all affected her like the
  first notes of a prelude. Stimulated by the noise and bustle, she began to
  look forward to her holiday with sharp-edged enjoyment.</p>

  <p>She was going to have the supreme tonic of change; different faces,
  different food, different language, different scenery. She would actually see
  again those snow-mountains which had haunted her dreams. Although it was so
  long ago, she still retained a clouded memory&mdash;a panoramic view of a
  white frieze of peaks seen from the top of the Schynige Platte.</p>

  <p>Once again she was able to appreciate her special luck; but even while she
  respected it as a benevolent Force, she was practical and believed in helping
  it to function.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if I can buy some white heather for the journey,' she
  thought.</p>

  <p>To her delight, she found several sprigs in a florist's shop inside the
  station. After asking its price, her frugal mind urged her to delay the
  purchase, in case she could buy cheaper from a street hawker. She was on her
  way to the nearest exit when she began to feel thirsty.</p>

  <p>With so much spare time on hand, she decided to have tea, instead of
  waiting for it to be served on the train. Entering the nearest
  refreshment-room, she found that it was filled chiefly with passengers for
  the Continental Express. Seated at a tiled table, while she smoked a
  cigarette, her attention was attracted to a group who were some distance
  away.</p>

  <p>She could hear every word they uttered, however, since they talked of
  their private affairs at the top of their voices and treated the rest of the
  company as non-existent. Judged by their appearance, they seemed to be
  prosperous and of some social importance. As was natural, Miss Loveapple took
  most notice of the two who were dressed for travel and&mdash;from their
  remarks&mdash;going on the Continent.</p>

  <p>The elder woman had been a beauty and still possessed a fragile but
  sterilised attraction; her face had a plaintive expression and her large dark
  eyes hinted at suffering. Her daughter was plainer, with black
  hair&mdash;worn in Edwardian fashion&mdash;a high colour and white protruding
  teeth.</p>

  <p>Presently a chauffeur in smart livery entered the refreshment room and
  crossed over to their table. He was carrying their light cases and had come
  for instructions about the heavier luggage. After a high-pitched reference to
  a new car&mdash;a Rolls-Royce&mdash;Miss Loveapple tried to tune out of their
  sound-wave by listening to the conversation of the people at her own table;
  but her attention was captured again against her will.</p>

  <p>'Mean to say you haven't got sleepers?' remonstrated a masculine
  voice.</p>

  <p>'They're not worth the expense,' explained the fragile elderly lady.
  'Besides, you have to travel first and we are going second-class. But it
  doesn't matter. <i>I</i> shall be privileged. I always am.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, mother has only to look pathetic and someone always comes across,'
  declared the daughter.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple congratulated herself on the corner seat she had booked in
  the Calais-Interlaken Express. She did not like the people and hurried over
  her tea, so as to return to the station.</p>

  <p>The scene had grown more animated in her absence, for the Continental
  Express had now come in. It was too early to board her, but Miss Loveapple
  passed through the barrier in order to find her carriage. As she strode down
  the platform, she compelled attention, just as the superior passengers in the
  tearoom had practically taken their surroundings by vocal assault.</p>

  <p>Since she believed her experience in London justified Miss Pitt's
  unfortunate advice, she was wearing the incongruous black satin suit. A
  hatless summer had deepened her colour to tropical warmth&mdash;her golden
  hair was uncovered&mdash;her deep blue eyes beamed with radiance. With head
  erect and swinging a heavy suitcase, she marched along, as though she
  trampled down opposition which divided her from a triumphant goal.</p>

  <p>Soon her seat was located in a Pullman coach. It met with her full
  approval, as it was beside a window and had the further convenience of a
  table. Hoisting her coat and case up on the rack, she jumped from the
  carriage and began to pace the platform. In her turn she watched the other
  passengers&mdash;wondering which among the number were going to Switzerland
  and picking out distinctive people from the crowd.</p>

  <p>She had just been reassured by seeing the superior tea-room ladies in a
  remote section of the train and completely out of conversational range, when
  a couple caught her attention.</p>

  <p>The man was thin and dark, with a slight indication of a moustache and
  dark waxed hair. He was characteristic of a variety of types, so that she
  could imagine him as a titled foreigner, a hair-dresser or the conductor of
  an orchestra. His companion, on the other hand, was unique.</p>

  <p>Her face was beautiful, when considered in separate parts. Fine, dark,
  slanting eyes and glossy hair were perfect as the faultless geranium-red lips
  and oval chin of magnolia whiteness. Unfortunately these flawless halves were
  united&mdash;or, rather, disjointed&mdash;by a nose which was too long and
  slightly crooked.</p>

  <p>'It's like looking at a face in a cracked mirror,' decided Miss Loveapple.
  'Paris labels. I bet they're a pair of crooks.'</p>

  <p>She did not know that one of the oldest dramas was being
  enacted&mdash;that of the watcher being watched. While she covertly studied
  the couple, she, too, was under observation.</p>

  <p>Distinct from the general notice of the crowd, someone was taking a direct
  personal interest in her movements.</p>

  <p>It was a well-dressed young man, of public school type, with excellent
  teeth and a pleasant smile. Slipping behind pillars, passengers and trucks
  piled with luggage, he took cover continually as he followed her with his
  eyes. In her case, his tactics were successful, but presently he attracted
  the attention of the woman with the crooked nose.</p>

  <p>'Look,' she whispered in great excitement to her companion. 'Do you see
  what I see?'</p>

  <p>'Gorblimey, it's <i>him,'</i> gasped the man. 'Didn't know he was out. Now
  things will ginger up a bit...Is he trailing any one?'</p>

  <p>'Seems to be the tall blonde dame.'</p>

  <p>'Then you can bet he's on to something hot. Now what do you think about
  that?'</p>

  <p>'This: if it's <i>his</i> game, it'll be better for our health to keep out
  of it.'</p>

  <p>'Sure. But if the blonde is on the Paris train, there's no harm in
  sticking round.'</p>

  <p>He spoke wistfully, for the couple were humble criminals&mdash;always
  holding back while others took the risk and made the kill&mdash;but
  reasonably content with pickings. Like a pair of jackals, they crawled
  forward only in the shadow of the tiger.</p>

  <p>Then the woman glanced at her wristwatch.</p>

  <p>'Time to get back to our carriage,' she said.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was already in her seat. She was impatient to
  start&mdash;to speed up the drawn-out farewells. While the engine panted and
  the air was full of good wishes and advice, she was being kept back&mdash;on
  the threshold.</p>

  <p>Directly the guard waved the green flag, her holiday would
  begin...Suddenly her face puckered with dismay as she remembered the white
  heather she had failed to buy.</p>

  <p>'Too late now,' she told herself. 'Don't be a fool. It's nothing but
  superstition.'</p>

  <p>All the same, at the back of her mind, she knew that the sprig would make
  all the difference to her happiness. If she started it, she could not travel
  in real confidence.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock and then sprang from the train. Clutching Lady
  Pontypool's jewel-case, which held her tickets, money and passport, besides
  some toilet articles, she rushed down the platform, through the barrier and
  back to the florist's shop. Too breathless to speak, she snatched a spray of
  white heather, threw down half a crown and dashed away, without waiting for
  her change.</p>

  <p>Her sprint back to the train was a spectacular performance, but not
  without danger, to the astonished spectators. After she had charged the
  official at the barrier, she heard the rip of her skirt and felt a new
  freedom in motion. Running still faster, she sped down the bay, just as the
  train was beginning to pull out.</p>

  <p>Her own carriage was too far away for her to attempt to reach it, but she
  managed to grasp the door handle of the last coach. It swung open as someone
  gripped her and hauled her inside.</p>

  <p>'What luck,' she panted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; CALAIS-INTERLAKEN EXPRESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT first, Miss Loveapple was too confused and breathless to
  be conscious of her surroundings. As she felt herself drawn down to a vacant
  seat, she included every one in the carriage in her gratitude.</p>

  <p>'Thanks so very much. It's frightfully good of you. I was afraid I was
  going to be left behind.'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i> thought so too,' agreed a voice which she had heard before. 'I
  saw you jump off the train and run. That's why I kept the door open on the
  chance of a snatch-and-grab.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple stared incredulously at the young man who had saved the
  situation.</p>

  <p>'You!' she gasped.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' replied Buckingham. 'I told you we should meet again. I am
  going to Switzerland.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him with mixed feelings&mdash;grateful for his help and
  flattered by his persistency, even while it annoyed her. Because she was
  country bred, she liked him better in plus-fours and pullover than in town
  clothes. Glancing curiously at his ungloved hands, she noticed that they were
  now free from chemical stains or scars.</p>

  <p>'Grindelwald too?' she asked ironically.</p>

  <p>'How did you guess?'</p>

  <p>'The same hotel?'</p>

  <p>'Even that would not surprise me...Good. I believe the sun is going to
  break through.'</p>

  <p>In the preservation of her dignity, Miss Loveapple was doing her utmost to
  control her lips; but her natural good-nature won and she joined in his
  laughter.</p>

  <p>'Did Brand come across with his cheque?' he asked, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p>'He did. Am I to thank you for it?'</p>

  <p>'I did apply some high-frequency. Dilatory beggar. Always forgets to put
  his watch forward when Summer Time comes in, so he never really catches
  up...Well, here we are. How are you liking it?'</p>

  <p>Reminded of her personal plight, Miss Loveapple groaned.</p>

  <p>'I'm a mess.'</p>

  <p>It was the blank impersonal stare of a girl in the opposite corner which
  made her suddenly conscious of a torn skirt and disordered hair. She was a
  type which Miss Loveapple resented and secretly envied&mdash;a pocket edition
  of perfection. Her small features were flawless, her eyes large, her lashes
  thick and dusty. Brunette in colouring, the clever artifice of her complexion
  suggested healthy natural pallor, to contrast with ripe-cherry lips. She was
  immaculately dressed in a travel outfit of leaf-brown tweed which reduced the
  black satin suit to salvage from some rag-bag.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple summed her up.</p>

  <p>'A fairy. "Small Lady." They make the fashion for <i>her</i>.'</p>

  <p>She was furious with herself for feeling jealous, especially as she was
  honestly incapable of admiring meagre proportions. Convicted in her own
  imagination of overweight and vulgarity, she rose from her seat.</p>

  <p>'I must get back to my own carriage,' she said.</p>

  <p>'You can't,' gloated Buckingham. 'This is a long train, all made up of
  bits and pieces.'</p>

  <p>Her face puckered as, for the first time, she noticed that there was no
  corridor to the coach.</p>

  <p>'I've left my coat and suitcase on my seat,' she said.</p>

  <p>'You can collect them at Dover. It's all right.'</p>

  <p>'No, it's <i>not</i> all right. I've lost my corner seat.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly the 'small lady' spoke in a low, husky voice.</p>

  <p>Will you change places with me?'</p>

  <p>The offer was so unexpected that Miss Loveapple felt like a rich maiden
  aunt.</p>

  <p>'No, thank you,' she said quickly.</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry. I thought you wanted a corner seat. What lovely white
  heather.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple laughed in a shamefaced manner as she placed her sprig
  inside her case for safety.</p>

  <p>'That's what I went back for,' she confessed. 'I hope it's worth it.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, do you believe in luck?'</p>

  <p>'I do in my own. I am always lucky.'</p>

  <p>'Then I'm glad you're coming on the Swiss train as a mascot. I'm always
  terrified of accidents.'</p>

  <p>'Don't worry. You will be safe with me.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple felt in her rightful element again as she made her
  prophecy. After suffering the humiliation of an inferiority complex, besides
  the loss of her corner seat, she was restored to her superior plane of
  special favours. In the circumstances, she was pleased to allow others to
  benefit from the overflow.</p>

  <p>'Can you guarantee a smooth crossing?' went on the girl.</p>

  <p>'Of course. <i>I'm</i> crossing too.'</p>

  <p>'That settles it.' Buckingham turned to the girl. 'We'll stick by
  her.'</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had included her in the conversation, but she
  appeared to be waiting for an overture. Her nod and quick smile was the seal
  of an alliance and reminded Miss Loveapple of the snap of a dog after
  sugar.</p>

  <p>'I ought to keep out of the Luck Syndicate,' she said. 'I am a stranger,
  while you know each other already. But when one is travelling alone, it makes
  all the difference to meet&mdash;nice people.'</p>

  <p>In spite of the compliment, Miss Loveapple felt under no illusion. The
  girl was of the stressed feminine type which seeks to appropriate any
  unattached man. While her face had the smooth contours of a schoolgirl, her
  composure testified to mature and competent character.</p>

  <p>Within the next minute she proved her quality.</p>

  <p>'May I mend your skirt?' she asked. 'I've a sewing outfit in my case. You
  can't do it yourself. But it looks too grim.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple glanced up at the rack and noticed that the girl's luggage
  matched her colour scheme, in further evidence of her attention to details.
  When the offer was accepted and the girl stooped over the black satin seam,
  Miss Loveapple had to admit the perfection of her manicure, the artistry of
  her wave and the sweep of her long lashes.</p>

  <p>'I'll just draw the edges together for the journey,' she explained. 'When
  you are back, you can take it to an invisible-mending place.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple made a vaguely grand gesture which restored her
  self-esteem.</p>

  <p>'Directly I get back, I shall throw it out,' she said.</p>

  <p>Although they were a lively party on their way to the coast, she was
  conscious of secret disappointment. The holiday had not begun according to
  plan. She had looked forward to travelling free from conversational
  obligations&mdash;at liberty to lie back in her corner and watch the fields
  and houses fly by.</p>

  <p>Directly Dover was reached, she jumped from the carriage and sprinted up
  the platform. She reached her old compartment, in time to see a porter dump
  her suitcase and coat on a truck. Disregarding Buckingham's offers of help,
  she joyfully gripped her belongings and boarded the Channel steamer&mdash;a
  free agent.</p>

  <p>The white heather gave proof of its virtue, for the twilit sea was too
  calm to upset the poorest sailor. Miss Loveapple enjoyed the short crossing,
  although she had to exercise strategy to avoid her fellow-passengers. When
  she boarded the Calais-Interlaken Express, her luck accompanied her, for she
  found only a quiet French couple in possession of her carriage.</p>

  <p>Before she had settled her property on the rack, she heard the girl's
  husky voice.</p>

  <p>'Do you mind if I take the last corner? If I don't, you may have a fat man
  with a snore.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple admitted the risk and accepted the compromise, although she
  considered secretly that the white heather was not straining itself on her
  behalf. She accompanied the girl to the restaurant-car and thoroughly
  appreciated her dinner, while the train roared through the green twilight of
  France. Everything looked strange and exciting on this side of the Channel,
  as afterwards she stood in the corridor and watched the lights of small
  stations flash by.</p>

  <p>After a time, she returned to her own carriage, to find the others already
  settled in their corners. They dimmed the lights in the hope of getting some
  rest, even if they could not sleep. Miss Loveapple had begun to like the
  sensation of rocking through the darkness, when she became aware of voices in
  the corridor.</p>

  <p>Some passengers were searching for fresh quarters. They all listened
  anxiously&mdash;dreading the worst&mdash;when the blow fell.</p>

  <p>'Only four here,' said a high-pitched voice.</p>

  <p>Opening her eyes, Miss Loveapple recognised the superior ladies from
  Victoria Tearoom. The elder looked in the last stage of exhaustion as she
  sank on a seat and smiled with dim sweetness.</p>

  <p>'I know we cannot be welcome,' she apologised. 'I'm so very sorry. But
  we've walked <i>miles,</i> trying to find a more comfortable carriage.'</p>

  <p>Then she spoke briskly to the official who was carrying their cases.</p>

  <p>'Put them up there, porter.'</p>

  <p>'But, mother,' interrupted the girl, 'you know you ought to have a corner
  seat, with your heart.'</p>

  <p>'My darling, it will be a corner in a cemetery if I have to walk another
  yard. Do you mind getting out the brandy?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple appreciated the comedy with grim amusement, as she recalled
  the delicate lady's boast to her friends. Even as she grinned, however, the
  dark girl gave another proof of an unselfish nature.</p>

  <p>'Do have my seat,' she urged.</p>

  <p>'How perfectly sweet of you,' said the invalid. 'People are so selfish
  to-day. It helps to account for the anti-social state of society.'</p>

  <p>In spite of their gratitude, Miss Loveapple received the impression that
  the newcomers considered the girl had spoken out of her turn. Her suspicion
  was sharpened when the daughter looked hopefully at her own place.</p>

  <p>'That lady's seat would be better for my mother, because it faces the
  window,' she explained to the girl. 'Perhaps she wouldn't mind changing to
  your corridor-corner?'</p>

  <p>'Sorry,' said Miss Loveapple calmly, 'but I'm afraid she would.'</p>

  <p>From that moment, she was made to feel not only in disgrace but an
  interloper. In the same manner that they invaded Victoria Station, so the
  ladies converted the carriage immediately into their own parochial territory.
  They settled the question of lighting and ventilation with deference only to
  the girl's preference, after she had given proof of an accommodating
  taste.</p>

  <p>'I can never sleep in a train,' explained the delicate lady, who had
  forgotten the threat of faintness. 'That's why I travel second. The time goes
  so much quicker when one is talking.'</p>

  <p>The dark girl agreed eagerly. She seemed to have assured herself of the
  stranger's social importance in the same manner as she had summed up Miss
  Loveapple and found her wanting, where a seam was concerned. Apparently she
  was in her element as she began to discuss the leaders of London Society.</p>

  <p>As she listened, Miss Loveapple felt that a bomb had exploded in the
  carriage, liberating a shower of clippings from the Social Register. Her head
  began to whirl with a succession of titles. She told herself that such
  exalted people must have begun life at the Top&mdash;that the bishops had
  never been curates or the generals started their careers as subalterns.</p>

  <p>Presently a mutual acquaintance was discovered, which was the signal for
  an interchange of names. The mother and daughter introduced themselves as Mrs
  Furse and Miss Olivia Furse, while the girl gave them her card.</p>

  <p>'"Miss Auchterloney,"' she said with a laugh. 'Give it up and call me
  "Viva", like every one else.'</p>

  <p>From that moment she became 'Viva' to her new acquaintances, while Miss
  Loveapple reflected bitterly:</p>

  <p>'It's as easy as that. But if there's a smash&mdash;when St Peter asks me
  for my claim to entry, he'll call <i>me</i> "Miss Loveapple."'</p>

  <p>Because she was very tired, she began to feel sorry for herself. She
  reminded herself that it was years since any one had called her by her
  Christian name. In a short time she would have forgotten it
  herself...Meanwhile, she longed for sleep, but the voices seemed wound up for
  a non-stop session. She lacked the philosophy of the French couple who had
  shrugged themselves back to slumber. At the same time as she longed for
  silence, she was indignant at being treated as a cypher.</p>

  <p>Presently she managed to summon her common sense to her aid as she
  reminded herself that this infliction was only a transitory experience. In a
  few hours' time, all these people would have passed out of her life.</p>

  <p>'I'm on my way to Switzerland,' she told herself.</p>

  <p>Once Miss Olivia Furse remembered her existence and made a slight gesture
  of friendship as she offered her a crumpled magazine.</p>

  <p>'Would you like to read this?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple rejected the favour which had come too late.</p>

  <p>'No, thank you,' she said. 'I can't read.'</p>

  <p>As the night wore on and her eyelids grew heavy, it seemed as though a
  great leaden pendulum inside her head were beating in time to the voices. The
  swaying of the carriage, the shrieks of passing engines, the smuts which
  drifted over her&mdash;all were parts of an endless nightmare. Then suddenly
  she was roused to painful attention, as Viva asked a question:</p>

  <p>'Where are you going in Switzerland? Moving on?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Mrs Furse. 'I have to rest. We are going to
  Grindelwald.'</p>

  <p>'So am I. Where are you staying?'</p>

  <p>Mrs Furse gave the name of Miss Love-apple's hotel and advised Viva to try
  to get a room, because of its high reputation.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple felt almost stunned from shock, as though her trust in an
  old friend had been betrayed.</p>

  <p>'What's happened to my luck?' she asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>As the time passed, although she was not conscious of sleeping, she knew
  she must have had periods of unconsciousness, for whenever her head jerked
  forward, she realised a change of subject...Mr Chamberlain and the Crisis.
  Walt Disney and Snow-White. Bread and butter as a means for slimming. On and
  on...</p>

  <p>In her discomfort, her thoughts kept straying back to the peace and beauty
  of the Pond House&mdash;the cool of her empty bed. She pictured Elsie asleep,
  with David in his basket beside her and Scottie snoring on his
  cushion&mdash;and she longed to be back again.</p>

  <p>Her envy was wasted, since Elsie's night was more restless than her own.
  The girl's mind was tortured by anxiety as to her mistress's safety. It
  seemed to her that she was in constant danger from transport; first, during
  the railway journey, and afterwards from funicular, mountain-rail,
  lake-steamer and motor coach. Even if she did not travel, there was always a
  chance of a slice of snow-mountain hurling itself down to bury her.</p>

  <p>She passed the hours in ceaseless intercession.</p>

  <p>'Please, if there's <i>got</i> to be an accident, let me stop the
  bus...'</p>

  <p>Towards dawn, the machinery began to show signs of running down, when Mrs
  Furse explained that she thought she could sleep if her daughter dimmed the
  lights. It was when the carriage was plunged into semi-darkness that Olivia
  Furse made her memorable remark.</p>

  <p>'Isn't the first night thrilling? There's such a sense of <i>destiny</i>
  in a railway journey. Your holiday&mdash;and even your life&mdash;may be
  influenced by the people you meet as strangers.'</p>

  <p>In that moment, Miss Loveapple made a passionate mental resolution.</p>

  <p><i>'No.</i> You've spoilt my journey completely. But you shall not spoil
  my holiday. Directly we get to Grindelwald, I'm free of you all&mdash;and
  I'll stay free. If I can avoid it, I'll never speak to any of you again. And
  I'll travel home by way of Paris.'</p>

  <p>Ten hours later, she stood on the wooden veranda of her hotel, gazing up
  at the great barrier of mountains. She recognised her old friends, the Eiger
  and the Wetterhorn, before she began to pick out the Upper and Lower Glaciers
  and the slash of the Gorge. Her eyeballs felt like jelly, but her face was
  enraptured.</p>

  <p>In spite of the ordeal of the night, her mind had stored its memories;
  coffee and rolls, while the train rolled through sunlit meadows&mdash;the
  turquoise-blue surfaces of Lake Thun&mdash;lunch under the chestnuts at
  Interlaken-Ost&mdash;the final journey up the tree-lined pass, beside the
  boiling Lutschine.</p>

  <p>But, at the moment, her chief need was tea. Her head throbbed and her
  throat felt parched as she walked down the shallow stairs, to find a
  discouraging situation. Apparently every one in the hotel had anticipated her
  idea. The lounge was crowded with visitors, who had commandeered every table,
  while a myopic staff hurried past her with laden trays.</p>

  <p>Just as she despaired of finding any one to take her order, a hand clasped
  her elbow.</p>

  <p>'Come along,' said Buckingham. 'Your tea's waiting. We ordered for
  you.'</p>

  <p>He led her out on to the veranda, towards a table laid for five, where Mrs
  Furse sat with her daughter Olivia and Viva. They had begun their meal, but
  they waved to her and pointed to her vacant chair.</p>

  <p>Instantly Miss Loveapple forgot her isolation policy and her resentment,
  as, beaming with pleasure at her welcome, she hurried to join the party.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; THE REAL MISS LOVEAPPLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE had a shock when she realised the
  comparatively high standard of dress at the hotel. In order to keep her
  suitcase light&mdash;so that she could carry it herself&mdash;she had packed
  only a few of her oldest clothes. After she had cursed Miss Pitt fervently
  for her misleading advice, she went out on her veranda to consider the
  position.</p>

  <p>As she gazed up at the mountains, they gradually drew her resentment from
  her, leaving her refreshed and comforted. Standing under the shadow of their
  peaks, it seemed both stupid and petty to allow her holiday to be spoilt by
  such a trifle as the opinion of other people.</p>

  <p>'I'll wear my shorts,' she decided, 'and they can lump them.'</p>

  <p>But when she went down to dinner in her evening outfit&mdash;a white
  Ottoman silk coatee worn over the black satin skirt of her suit&mdash;she
  could not rid her mind of the feeling that her first holiday rapture was
  flawed. She noticed that Viva&mdash;in a Victorian dress of flounced
  net&mdash;was sitting with the Furses and shared with them a keen sense of
  social values. Their interest was focused on those better-dressed visitors
  who had the upper seats at the banquet, and they evidently considered that
  they had discharged any obligation to their travelling companion during
  tea.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple assured herself that she was lucky to escape their company.
  She still felt herself rocking with the motion of the train, and she wanted a
  good sleep. Hurrying over her meal, to avoid the threat of
  Buckingham&mdash;whose appetite made him stay the courses&mdash;she pulled on
  a coat and went for a stroll through the village. At first she was delighted
  with the novelty of the holiday scene&mdash;visitors drinking coffee or beer
  on every flower-wreathed veranda and shops with their wood carvings and lace;
  but as she had left the lights behind her and began to follow the hilly road
  towards the Upper Glacier, she grew gradually aware of anti-climax.</p>

  <p>This holiday was decreed by Fate to influence her destiny, and the first
  disconnected threads of the pattern were beginning to straggle across the
  loom...Therefore, although the night held all she craved&mdash;the stars, the
  solitude, the mountains&mdash;instead of drowning her personality in
  immensity, she found herself yielding to some very human impulses.</p>

  <p>The Furses and Viva despised her for a shabby nonentity. She wanted to
  introduce them to the real Miss Loveapple of prize-marrow fame and the owner
  of three houses.</p>

  <p>After a good night's rest, she awoke in excellent health and spirits, but
  determined to assert herself if the opportunity arose. Wearing her shorts
  with complete lack of self-consciousness, she came into the restaurant.</p>

  <p>Viva was again sharing a table with the Furses and seemed absorbed in
  their conversation. Beyond bows and a charming smile&mdash;thrown in by Mrs
  Furse as a bonus&mdash;none of the women took any further notice of her,
  except the daughter, Olivia, who stared fixedly at her legs.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple sat down at the only vacant table, which was next to
  theirs, and began her breakfast of coffee and rolls. Her mind had journeyed
  back to Highfield, and she was envying Elsie her bacon, when Buckingham
  entered the restaurant. Blind to Viva's gestures of invitation, he seated
  himself opposite to her.</p>

  <p>'Mind if I share your table?' he asked. 'I don't talk. Too early.'</p>

  <p>'Suits me,' she said, conscious of a feminine thrill of conquest.</p>

  <p>Owing to the chaotic state of her mind during the journey, her impression
  of him was confused. Refreshed by her sleep, she studied his face with
  interest. She noticed then that the hardness of his expression was due to the
  lines of strain so often present on the faces of post-War manhood.</p>

  <p>As they remained silent, they found themselves listening to the
  conversation at the next table. Mrs Furse first told Viva of their Surrey
  estate which they had sold recently, and then went on to describe their
  London flat, which had every modern luxury and improvement, including a view
  of synthetic country landscape.</p>

  <p>In the first pause, Olivia Furse, who seemed more sociable than her
  companions, tried to draw Miss Loveapple into the conversation.</p>

  <p>'Do you live in the country?' she asked.</p>

  <p>It was the opportunity for which she had been waiting; but before she
  could reply, Mrs Furse resumed her description of the flat.</p>

  <p>'It's a four-figure rent, but it is really an economy, as we need less
  staff.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple decided not to enter the competition.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I am living in the country,' she replied.</p>

  <p>To her secret gratification, Buckingham acted as her publicity agent.</p>

  <p>'Actually, Miss Loveapple has three houses,' he explained. 'One in London,
  one in the country, and one on the coast.'</p>

  <p>As they all looked at the despised passenger in surprise, Olivia snatched
  at an explanation.</p>

  <p>'Oh&mdash;are they guest houses?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was outraged by the suggestion.</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied, 'they are private houses and my personal property. I
  live in them, by turns. I like a change.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Furse broke the strained silence which followed with a gentle
  reproach:</p>

  <p>'How enchanting...All the same, I don't think I could own three houses at
  once. I should consider it a crime when so many poor families have to crowd
  into one room.'</p>

  <p>'Have you always got a slum family in your spare-room?' asked Miss
  Loveapple sharply.</p>

  <p>'That question is in the same class as, "Have you left off beating your
  wife?"' remarked Buckingham appreciatively. 'Now, Mrs Furse, you'll either
  convict yourself of being anti-social or you will have to admit that your
  marvellous flat has not got a spare-room.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Miss Loveapple was smitten by disgust of the episode. She was
  ashamed of having yielded to self-advertisement and also, more vaguely, of
  trying to live in three houses at once. Rising abruptly, she went out into
  the garden to smoke.</p>

  <p>She was shielding her match from the wind when Buckingham joined her.</p>

  <p>'Are you furious with me for giving you away?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' she admitted honestly. 'You only repeated what I told you myself.
  It's my lookout if I'm fool enough to splutter my private affairs to
  strangers. Besides, how do you know I <i>have</i> three houses?'</p>

  <p>'I don't. Have you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Have you a sister?'</p>

  <p>'Why not? They're common.'</p>

  <p>'Not common enough. I haven't one. What's Mrs Brand like?'</p>

  <p>'Men don't notice their sisters. She managed to get married. I don't know
  if that was due to attraction or luck.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple broke into her characteristic hearty laughter.</p>

  <p>'You're specially vague about your family,' she said. 'I had to tell you
  your brother-in-law wants to buy my London house. I expect the sale will be
  put through while I am here. But I intend to get back and settle about the
  furniture myself.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Because I am a business woman.'</p>

  <p>'Business woman?' Buckingham's voice was bitter. 'You mean you've never
  made a penny in your life. A man earned the money you inherited and another
  man advised you how to invest it. Then just because you read the Stock Market
  Report to see if Rubber is up, you claim to be a keen business woman. Any
  child who sits in a cash-desk has better claim to the title.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple flushed scarlet.</p>

  <p>'Are you trying to be rude?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied. 'I did better than that. I <i>was</i> rude. I forgot I
  was talking to you. I apologise...The truth is, all my life I've been a
  Have-not. My people were the poor relations of our family. It's made me raw
  where money is concerned.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's rush of sympathy was her warning to harden her heart in
  instinctive self-defence. She often reminded herself that some of her luck
  consisted in the knowledge of her happiness. Since she remained single from
  choice, she was suspicious of any disguised threat to her spinster
  status.</p>

  <p>The attraction she felt for Buckingham was so foreign to her nature that
  she diagnosed it as flabby moral tissue which must be cut away ruthlessly. To
  complicate the situation with pity would be catastrophic.</p>

  <p>'You're wrong about one thing,' she told him. 'I made some of my money. I
  won it in a Sweep.'</p>

  <p>'How many tickets?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'One.'</p>

  <p>'Your last ten bob?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>Not even sporting.'</p>

  <p>'Well!' she gasped. 'The mountains take the conceit out of me. But you've
  rolled me out flat.'</p>

  <p>Although she was careful never to mention her three houses again to any
  one in the hotel, the incident had definite consequences. The worldly-wise
  Mrs Furse and Viva considered her worthy of acquaintance. They invited her to
  join them in various excursions which would have been too expensive for her,
  unless the cost were shared with a party.</p>

  <p>When she was alone and could analyse her feelings, she had to acknowledge
  her secret disappointment. This was not the ideal holiday she had planned
  with such rapture. Mrs Furse had the qualities of a social leader and
  impressed herself upon the other guests at the hotel. Her invitations were
  regarded as honours, so that Miss Loveapple found it difficult to resist
  being drawn into her select circle, which also included Buckingham.</p>

  <p>They went to the Blue Lake of Kandersteg, the Gorge of the Aare and the
  Great Rhone Glacier. But although she was excited and thrilled, she was often
  jarred and dissatisfied. There were too many people to distract her&mdash;too
  many faces and too many voices. What she really wanted was to be
  alone&mdash;to lie high up on mountain-turf and watch the clouds drift across
  the changing faces of the ranges.</p>

  <p>It was not long before she became an outstanding figure at the hotel.
  Although she had no wish to attract attention, her personality was too
  forceful and genuine to be suppressed. When she expressed an opinion, it was
  an honest statement, made without deference to the feelings of her
  listeners.</p>

  <p>Her shorts were partly responsible for the tribute paid to her character,
  because she wore them with such complete nonchalance. They were a challenge
  to Viva, who appeared daily in a fresh sports outfit of exclusive
  fashion.</p>

  <p>The morning she came down to breakfast wearing navy blue trousers, Miss
  Loveapple could not control her indignation.</p>

  <p>'I never saw a more disgusting spectacle,' she declared to Olivia Furse.
  I'd rather go naked than wear trousers.'</p>

  <p>To vindicate her outraged modesty, she went up to her room and cut two
  inches off her Boy Scout shorts.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; THE PARAGON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Pond House seemed empty and lifeless without Miss
  Loveapple. When she was at home, she swept through it like an invigorating
  gale. She shouted, she scolded, she raised a dust; but she also ventilated,
  cleansed and cheered. Because Miss Loveapple, of three addresses, considered
  herself lucky, she was happy&mdash;and as others benefited by the overflow of
  her high spirits, indirectly they shared her luck.</p>

  <p>David and Scottie reacted to the stagnant atmosphere. They became moody
  and difficult about their food, just to show they resented Elsie's regency.
  To make matters worse for her, they developed a harrowing habit of lying upon
  Miss Loveapple's bed and mourning like funeral mutes. They put on this show
  for her benefit, for directly they were no longer under observation, they
  sneaked away, to make whoopee in the garden.</p>

  <p>Elsie missed Miss Loveapple from morning to night, not to mention those
  hours when she awoke to remember that her mistress was not sleeping under the
  same roof. She found herself listening continually for the sound of her firm
  footsteps and her ringing laugh. In her daily bulletin to her, however, she
  was careful to suppress the personal note.</p>

  <p>These letters followed a formula. She gave the weather, the news, the
  meals, the work and Miss Pitt's report on the health of the pets. David and
  Scottie supplied the surprise item, while her own contribution was a
  warning.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that Miss Loveapple had not played the game by Elsie.
  Had she been free entirely, she might have got some good out of the holiday.
  A late heat-wave made her long to put on her swimming-suit and sunbathe in
  the privacy of the back garden. So long as the work was done, there was no
  reason why she should not relax and rest, except that she had to be ready for
  the visits of the local Vigilance Society.</p>

  <p>Feeling sure that any lapse from her high standard would be reported to
  Miss Loveapple, she changed daily from her lilac cotton morning dress to her
  afternoon uniform of grey alpaca. None of her visitors ever found her off
  guard or lacking in respect, although&mdash;true to local
  tradition&mdash;they were careful not to arrive at a set time.</p>

  <p>Miss Pitt committed a breach of decorum by entering the house directly she
  had rung the bell. She further annoyed Elsie by addressing her conversation
  exclusively to the pets.</p>

  <p>'What did you have for dinner to-day, Scottie?' she would ask.</p>

  <p>When Elsie had supplied the information, she always insisted on feeling
  David, to find out whether he was overeating. This was a direct slur on
  Elsie, who was the diet disciplinarian and not Miss Loveapple; yet she
  managed to remain silent.</p>

  <p>There was a reason for her diplomacy. Miss Pitt's co-operation would be
  essential, in case she went up to London on the thirteenth of September, to
  surprise her mistress at the London house.</p>

  <p>It was more difficult to control her indignation when the garden was
  looted by Captain Brown. Although it gave her extra work, she filled every
  vase in the house, in order to decrease the supply for his knife.</p>

  <p>'What do you want with all these flowers with your mistress away?' he
  asked, when she had forestalled him by cutting the early chrysanthemums he
  had earmarked for his wife's dinner-party.</p>

  <p>'They're for David,' she explained. 'He likes to scoop them out of the
  water.'</p>

  <p>'Well, why not give him withered ones to scoop?'</p>

  <p>'No, he likes the flowers to be big and coloured.'</p>

  <p>'Human nature,' grinned the captain&mdash;a remark which offended Elsie's
  sense of propriety.</p>

  <p>Although she stood in more awe of the rector's wife, she always stood and
  watched while cabbages were cut and beans pulled, in order to make mysterious
  entries in a note-book.</p>

  <p>'Madam will want to know how much she's helped the Parish and the Cottage
  Hospital,' she explained.</p>

  <p>'Rubbish,' scoffed Mrs Bosanquet. 'You can count apples, but you can't
  weigh beans without scales.'</p>

  <p>'I check up before and <i>after,'</i> hinted Elsie darkly. 'I know
  everything that's in the garden. I'd miss a blade of grass if&mdash;if the
  gardener stole it.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Elsie. It's nice to know you don't suspect us. Your mistress
  is lucky to have a paragon.'</p>

  <p>When the rector's wife had gone, Elsie looked up the word in the
  dictionary. She would have been less gratified by the compliment had she
  known that&mdash;while she was called 'The Paragon' by Miss Love-apple's
  friends&mdash;they would not have had her as a gift. They considered her
  hopelessly spoilt and only fit for specialised service, where the mistress
  did the heavy work.</p>

  <p>At the same time, after they had trained cooks and housemaids to leave
  them for higher wages, they sometimes were envious of Elsie's loyalty. Miss
  Loveapple alone among the local ladies knew nothing about the rates for small
  advertisements or Registry Office fees.</p>

  <p>Lately, Elsie's devotion manifested itself in an extraordinary manner.
  Every day she made a practice of crossing the road before an oncoming car.
  Although she cut it perilously fine, she was nimble enough in leaping to
  safety; but she was the cause of much inspired profanity and many shocks to
  nervous motorists.</p>

  <p>No one knew that this experiment was the corollary to her nightly
  petition: 'If there's got to be an accident, let <i>me</i> be the one to stop
  the bus.'</p>

  <p>On the principle of 'Safety First,' she continued to send a daily warning
  to Grindelwald. Miss Loveapple read the postscript to her latest letter out
  to Buckingham as they stood together on the veranda looking up at the lights
  of the Eiger Glacier Station.</p>

  <p>'Just listen to this. Elsie says, "<i>Please, madam, be careful when you
  cross the road and watch out for those nasty avalanches.</i>"'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple broke off in her laughter to add, 'She's always warning me
  of something new. I mustn't get bitten by a mosquito. I must boil the water
  before washing. I must wear spiked shoes to go mountain-climbing.'</p>

  <p>'Better not mention the Lion of Lucerne to her,' advised Buckingham.</p>

  <p>He stifled his yawns while Miss Loveapple recited fresh proofs of Elsie's
  devotion.</p>

  <p>'I really believe she would give her life to save mine. She doesn't like
  me to be alone in the house, without her to protect me. The joke of it is
  that she can terrify a tramp who's twice her weight.'</p>

  <p>'You ought to have a man about the place,' said Buckingham.</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'To do the heavy work.'</p>

  <p>'I do that. I dig in the garden and chop wood. Good for my figure.'</p>

  <p>'Well, what about yourself? You run risks. You were entertaining a strange
  young man in your bedroom when I met you in London.'</p>

  <p>'Drawing-room,' corrected Miss Loveapple. 'The poor fellow was a pathetic
  pansy. And don't forget you were a strange young man at the time.'</p>

  <p>Her words were an unconscious recognition of the growth of their
  friendship. Buckingham's voice lost its casual note as he asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>'What will you do when the devoted Elsie gets married?'</p>

  <p>'She isn't going to marry,' replied Miss Loveapple. 'And neither am I. So
  we're a partnership for life.'</p>

  <p>Her lips were set in so stern a line that he looked at her in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>'Are you serious?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I was never more serious about anything,' Miss Loveapple told him. 'Why
  should I marry? I have everything I want. My life is perfectly happy. I
  wouldn't risk a change...Why are you looking at me?'</p>

  <p>As he did not reply, she unconsciously threw back her head and expanded
  her shoulders as though in challenge to his gaze.</p>

  <p>'You've guessed it,' he said with a laugh. 'I <i>was</i> admiring your
  figure. It's a fine one&mdash;and you know it. But it only makes the contrast
  more deplorable. Any woman who deliberately rejects marriage must be mentally
  malformed. I should say your mind is as much of a freak as a three-legged
  calf.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple smiled scornfully, to show him how little she cared for his
  criticism.</p>

  <p>'You've a delicate touch,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>Yet his words implanted a sting which she could not draw from her mind.
  Had Elsie known, she might have added another danger to her list, which
  included every Alpine contingency.</p>

  <p>But it made no mention of Clarence Club.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; LONG-DISTANCE MURDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE thirteenth of September was an important date to
  Clarence Club. Before night fell, he proposed to murder his enemy&mdash;Henry
  Watkins. It was a long-distance crime, for, at first, his victim would have
  no idea that he was removed from the land of the living. He would continue to
  carry on in the usual way&mdash;unaware of his fate&mdash;until the blow
  which was struck on September the thirteenth, found its appointed mark.</p>

  <p>In other words, Club proposed to commit a murder for which Watkins would
  be hanged.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple had met Club already. On that occasion, she had consented
  to a demonstration of his hypothetical vacuum-cleaner on her drawing-room
  carpet. At the time, he had impressed her favourably, but not sufficiently
  for a clear recollection of him.</p>

  <p>She vaguely remembered a pleasant young man with an oval face, soft brown
  eyes and a small heart-shaped mouth. His appearance was gentlemanly and his
  accent managed to suggest a Public School education, since his animal mimicry
  was as instinctively perfect as that of a moth, invisible against the bark of
  a tree.</p>

  <p>In his turn, he had scarcely been conscious of her. His chief interest had
  been to establish her circumstances and surroundings. If he had met her in
  the street, twenty minutes later, he would have passed her without
  recognition. To him, she was merely one of his stage-properties&mdash;sawdust
  and a squeak; a Judy to be knocked over by Punch.</p>

  <p>Both Watkins and Club had drifted into a life of crime. Watkins had a
  small antique shop, but his principles were crooked; after he discovered that
  a fake brought him more profit than a genuine article, he specialised in
  fraud.</p>

  <p>Club&mdash;who considered himself a brilliant misfit&mdash;had been
  'unlucky' in a variety of jobs, although his employer had always been
  unluckier. He was a piano-tuner when first he met Watkins. As his musical
  performance was sufficiently monotonous to drive away any audience, he was
  able to learn the geography of the houses he visited, as well as acquire
  knowledge of any valuable portable objects.</p>

  <p>He and Watkins formed a useful partnership in a modest way. Watkins
  disposed of the swag which he collected, either on the spot or during a later
  nocturnal visit to his patrons' premises. It was true that they were not
  always successful, for both were convicted at intervals and served short
  stretches for petty theft.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was the knowledge that he was documented at the Yard
  which drove Club to persevere in his profession. It inflamed his vanity and
  made him realise the possibilities of his name&mdash;Club. In his ambition to
  be known as 'The Ace,' he planned an ambitious jewel-robbery for which he
  requisitioned Watkins' services as his accomplice.</p>

  <p>It was an unlucky venture for which they had neither the organisation nor
  the experience. Unable to dispose of the jewels and conscious of
  incriminating evidence, Watkins cracked under the strain. Rather than wait
  for his inevitable arrest, he became confidential with the Police, in the
  hope of a reduced sentence.</p>

  <p>Club was blinded by his vanity and had no doubts of the complete success
  of the robbery. He was furious at the exposure and made the mistake of
  resisting the Police&mdash;which is a pleasant way of putting it, considering
  what the policeman looked like afterwards. Fortunately for him, the man
  recovered, to save him from the drop, but, this time, his sentence was for
  years instead of months.</p>

  <p>As he considered himself a type of ultra-refinement, he resented the hard
  labour even more than the loss of his liberty. Every pang of humiliation he
  endured was attributed to his partner's treachery. As years passed, he lost
  all sense of proportion and restrain, until through continual brooding, his
  hatred grew to a fixed purpose.</p>

  <p>He resolved to murder Henry Watkins.</p>

  <p>The time ceased to drag as he plotted the perfect crime. On one point, he
  was definite&mdash;it had to be foolproof, for he did not intend to swing for
  Watkins. But although he evolved some ingenious ideas, he was discouraged by
  an obvious conclusion.</p>

  <p>He, himself, would be the first suspect, since he had shouted threats to
  Watkins, from the Dock, when he was sentenced.</p>

  <p>This display of decent natural feeling might be construed as motive if
  Watkins' violent death coincided with his own release from prison.</p>

  <p>Presently he got his inspiration. He would frame Watkins for a murder
  committed by himself and let the Law act as his deputy.</p>

  <p>He had the highest opinion of the brain-power of the Police, since he had
  proved them to be always a jump ahead of himself. He had heard that they were
  familiar with every criminal's methods, so that if he planted clues which
  were characteristic of Watkins, they would identify his signature.</p>

  <p>The scene of the crime must not be plastered with evidence lest they
  should become suspicious. He had to trust entirely to their perspicacity.
  They would discover a minute nick in the canvas of a dark oil-painting in
  Miss Loveapple's drawing-room, as though someone had been about to remove the
  picture before he decided it was valueless.</p>

  <p>This was one pointer to an antique-dealer who faked Old Masters.</p>

  <p>The second indication could only be discovered by a thorough examination
  of the papers in the bureau of the deceased. Mixed with a miscellaneous pile,
  there would be a vacuum-cleaner catalogue, decorated on its cover with the
  impress of a dirty thumb.</p>

  <p>The Police would find it corresponded with a print in their own
  collection.</p>

  <p>The next logical stage in their investigations should be an interest in
  Watkins' movements at the time of the murder. He would provide them with a
  truthful alibi when he stated that he had been in the company of his
  lady-friend, Amy.</p>

  <p>At this point he was due to feel the first tickle of the rope around his
  neck...Amy, who was still spell-bound by her former
  lover&mdash;Club&mdash;would not only repudiate his alibi, but produce an
  ornament lifted from the dead woman's body, in proof that she had been bribed
  to lie. For this, Club had earmarked the golden elephant and chain which Miss
  Loveapple had worn during their interview. As the trunk had been upraised, to
  attract good luck, he counted on a superstitious nature to hang it always
  around her neck.</p>

  <p>The master touch would be its identification by means of a torn filament
  of Miss Loveapple's hair twisted around a link of the chain. He had secured
  this from a comb on the toilet table, when he had hidden in her bedroom.</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple had vaguely suspected, he had only pretended to shut the
  front door after him while she was talking to Buckingham in the morning-room.
  Afterwards, when she was alone in the house with him, he suddenly realized
  that he had an opportunity to commit the crime without waiting for
  night-fall. But while he was creeping down the stairs, something had
  apparently startled her, for she had suddenly rushed out of the house.</p>

  <p>He was grateful that he was prevented from yielding to his impulse when he
  remembered that Watkins might have produced an unpuncturable alibi for the
  afternoon. It made him alive to the danger of a premature performance, so
  that he returned to his flat and rang up Amy, telling her to nobble Watkins
  for that night.</p>

  <p>He paid his call at No. 19 Madeira Crescent, only to find it empty. Miss
  Loveapple had gone away to the country.</p>

  <p>As he thought over his revenge, he could see no possibility of being
  connected with a motiveless crime. If questioned, he resolved to admit that
  he had no alibi. Lately, the Police seemed inclined to suspect a perfect
  alibi, in much the same carping spirit as they were discrediting the value of
  fingerprints, after they had put the whole of the criminal class to the
  expense of procuring gloves.</p>

  <p>His egotism blinded him to the truth that his personal safety was an
  illusion. Once he committed murder, he became vulnerable to attack from the
  blundering force of Chance. He was at the mercy of any trifle which controls
  the suspension of Destiny. An accident&mdash;slight as the first rip in the
  envelope of a balloon&mdash;could send him to the gallows.</p>

  <p>The wind might shift as he crouched in the shadow and blow a betraying
  paper to his hiding-place. Lovers hidden in the darkness of the tradesmen's
  alley might testify that they had seen him near the scene of the crime. Amy
  might fail him through force of circumstance.</p>

  <p>Whatever his ultimate fate, however, the fact remained that any lady who
  entered No. 19 Madeira Crescent, without an escort, on the thirteenth of
  September, was due to get a very unpleasant reception.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; MOUNTAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the thirteenth of September drew nearer, Miss Loveapple
  grew dimly conscious of a sense of frustration and loss. She began to dream
  again of mountains by night, when she saw vast white ranges soaring to
  breathless heights. During her sleep, she climbed peaks of incredible
  altitude with so joyous a feeling of liberty and achievement, that she always
  awoke to keen disappointment.</p>

  <p>This nightly ecstasy of release was symptomatic of a chaotic mind.
  Although she could write a clear business letter, she was inarticulate when
  any deep emotion was stirred. While tears stood in her eyes at the
  realization of another's sorrow, she would ask the mourner to accept 'my
  condolence in your bereavement.'</p>

  <p>To her, mountains were a rapture&mdash;a passion&mdash;almost a religion.
  But she never spoke of them and avoided the subject. She would not even think
  consciously of them, lest the fetters of unuttered words should weigh down
  her spirit.</p>

  <p>The less spectacular mountains of the Bernese Oberland haunted her by day,
  yet she could not draw close to them. She looked at them but doubted whether
  she actually saw them, because of the distraction of other people's
  interests. All around her was the stir of petty social
  activity&mdash;chattering voices&mdash;shallow laughter.</p>

  <p>As the days passed, she consoled herself with a promise. She vowed that
  she would escape from company and go up alone to the Kleine Scheidegg.</p>

  <p>Part of her unrest had a baser source than starved artistic yearning. For
  the first time in her life, she was conscious of another woman. There was no
  doubt of Viva's supremacy at the hotel. She did not rely on her attraction
  alone to gain her popularity but was invariably kind and sympathetic to the
  other guests. Yet while she was as ready to listen to servant-troubles as to
  offer advice about a peeled nose, she contrived to remain impersonal and
  remote.</p>

  <p>This contrast piqued Miss Loveapple, especially as she noticed that Viva
  was the perfect opportunist and managed to avoid the complication of contact
  with visitors minus acquaintance value. Gradually she felt the stirring of a
  spirit of emulation. Although her nature was too big to admit actual
  jealousy, she was used to being first and she did not relish a back seat.</p>

  <p>'There was no competition in Highfield,' she reflected. 'Only women older
  than myself. But before I'm through, I'll show her exactly where she gets
  off.'</p>

  <p>She was surprised to discover that her subconscious distrust of Viva was
  shared by Olivia Furse. Together they strolled over to the Bear Hotel, to
  watch the dancing, when they witnessed a charming episode. Viva, who was
  swaying in the arms of a beautiful Teutonic youth, suddenly became aware of a
  neglected girl.</p>

  <p>Within a few minutes, she arranged for the transfer of her reluctant
  partner to the wallflower, before she was snapped up herself by another
  hovering man.</p>

  <p>'That's kind,' admitted Miss Loveapple honestly.</p>

  <p>'Kind as hell,' said Olivia bitterly. 'I was the victim the other night.
  No one noticed I wasn't dancing until the searchlight was turned on me. Then
  every one said, "How kind." I was happy before. I enjoy being a
  spectator.'</p>

  <p>The vehemence of Olivia's voice made Miss Loveapple realize the
  humiliation of her position. As the unattractive daughter of a mother who was
  a social success, the girl had acquired her aggressive manner to hide an
  inferiority complex. She felt a bond of sympathy with her as Olivia went on
  talking.</p>

  <p>'Viva's got me guessing. There's something queer somewhere. Mother thinks
  she is tops. But why is she so interested in all our friends and in every one
  that is anybody? I believe she's got an axe to grind. You can tell by her
  eyes she doesn't really care twopence about you. Perhaps she's been sent out
  by some firm to advertise their clothes.'</p>

  <p>'But she never mentions where she buys anything,' Miss Loveapple reminded
  Olivia. 'Besides she hangs on to me&mdash;and I'm not in Society.'</p>

  <p>'That's only because you have Buckingham. There are so few loose men
  here.'</p>

  <p>The remark rankled in Miss Loveapple's mind. For several years, she had
  been accustomed to give orders and not even to take advice. Such preferential
  treatment was bound to foster a streak of autocrat. While she was trying to
  ignore Viva's existence, a chance came to assert herself.</p>

  <p>She joined with Mrs and Olivia Furse, Viva and Buckingham in an afternoon
  excursion. They motored down the valley of Interlaken and partly encircled
  the green water of Lake Brientz to the Giessbach Falls. While they were
  having tea in front of the hotel, and watching the river descend in seven
  mighty leaps from the mountain, Buckingham waved his hand over the table.</p>

  <p>'This is on me,' he said.</p>

  <p>Later on, after their return to the hotel, Miss Loveapple inquired the
  price of her share of the car.</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' said Viva gaily. 'Richard threw the party.'</p>

  <p>'He only meant the tea,' explained Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'But we all thanked him&mdash;and he liked it. Better leave it. You can't
  make a man feel a fool.'</p>

  <p>'I'll risk it.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was in her element as she interviewed the hall-porter. She
  knew that Buckingham was out of a job and guessed that his finances would be
  strained by an unexpected demand. As the bill for the car-hire was still
  owing, she paid it herself before she pounced down on the other women.</p>

  <p>'I'm sticking you for your shares of the car,' she told them. 'It's
  difficult for a man to collect.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Furse discharged her double debt with her customary charm. Viva
  followed her example, but she did so with a veiled reluctance which was balm
  to Miss Loveapple's self-esteem. She felt a watered-down throb of savagery,
  faintly akin to the elementary urge of a jungle beast to protect its mate,
  when she went in search of Buckingham.</p>

  <p>She found him in the garden where he was smoking glumly. He did not speak
  to her but stared when she laid down a bundle of notes on the wicker
  table.</p>

  <p>'Thanks for the tea,' she said.</p>

  <p>The undisguised relief in his face prompted her to dare a tactless
  question.</p>

  <p>'Tight?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly sober,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'Financially embarrassed then, since you can't understand short
  words?'</p>

  <p>'Solvent now, but only thanks to you,' he admitted. 'Before you fluttered
  in at my window, I was wondering how I should make out on the journey home. I
  am leaving before the rest of you.'</p>

  <p>The news gave her a pang of regret as she seated herself beside him on the
  bench.</p>

  <p>'Why did you take a holiday you can't afford?' she asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>'You,' he told her.</p>

  <p>'Fool.'</p>

  <p>'I'm serious. I fell for you at once. I'm not noble and I liked you better
  because you had money. Useful stuff. I'm a chemist with a brilliant future,
  only no one will stake me.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's eyes darkened from blue to violet as she listened. Her
  spurt of primitive jungle loyalty had been but a momentary spark blown from
  an almost extinct fire. It was replaced by a more civilised form of the same
  instinct&mdash;a woman's ambition to control the plastic future of a man.</p>

  <p>She crushed down the dangerous urge and spoke lightly.</p>

  <p>'You'll get your chance. Every one does. You must marry some rich woman
  who is free from my mental freak-formation.'</p>

  <p>He looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>'Were you serious about not wanting to marry?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I was,' she replied. 'I am. And I always shall be.'</p>

  <p>'Then you've no right to look like you do. It's cheating.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple merely wished that Viva could hear him, in proof that she
  had cooled down to her usual practical self.</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry you are going,' she said, 'because I wanted you to help
  me.'</p>

  <p>When she confided her wish of a solitary expedition up the Kleine
  Scheidegg, he nodded.</p>

  <p>'It will have to be to-morrow,' he said. 'Mrs Furse and daughter are
  visiting a relative in Berne. I'll sell Viva the idea of Lauterbrunnen. I'll
  see her safely on the way as far as Zweilütschinen and then tell her that
  tale about business at Interlaken.'</p>

  <p>'I can't thank you,' faltered Miss Loveapple. 'This means a lot to me.
  I&mdash;I can't explain.'</p>

  <p>As she looked out at the vast spread of valley, speckled with tiny lights
  on distant slopes, she felt that they were open to the night and very close
  to it. It was flowing up to their feet in waves of darkness&mdash;and
  sweeping around them&mdash;but she felt no fear. She knew that she could walk
  without a tremor down the hill, to cross the grey-white foaming Lütschine and
  wander in the witched wood of glimmering tree-trunks and gurgling water.</p>

  <p>And yet, on a sunny summer morning she had shrunk from entering the
  darkened hall of No. 19 Madeira Crescent, lest someone should be waiting
  there for her.</p>

  <p>As she shuddered at the memory, Buckingham broke the silence.</p>

  <p>'You told me you thought of breaking your journey in London, on your way
  back, didn't you?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'Well, what about me meeting your train and seeing you in? It's grim going
  back to an empty house.'</p>

  <p>'I wish you would.'</p>

  <p>With these four words, she knocked a hole in Clarence Club's perfect
  murder scheme.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; KLEINE SCHEIDEGG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NO one in the hotel had reason to suspect Miss Loveapple of
  a secret passion for mountains. She rarely appeared to notice them except on
  picture postcards, when she confined herself to discussing their price. When
  strangers appealed to her for information, she snapped out their names
  curtly, as though they were a troupe of performing dogs.</p>

  <p>'Eiger, Fiescherhorn, Wetterhorn&mdash;'</p>

  <p>One almost expected to see them rear themselves up on their mighty
  haunches, obedient to the voice of command.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was impossible to guess that each succeeding day of her
  holiday was a rung of the ladder which led her up to the crowning miracle of
  her trip by mountain railway, up to the Jungfraujoch. She was waiting for
  that great moment when&mdash;from the Kleine Scheidegg&mdash;there would
  burst upon her the triple glory of the Eiger, the Mönsch and the
  Jungfrau.</p>

  <p>On the morning after she had helped Buckingham, he kept his promise and
  played the lion to her mouse. When the Furse family had departed for Berne,
  Viva&mdash;in dark-blue trousers and pullover, with an apple-green
  scarf&mdash;left the hotel accompanied by Buckingham. A little later, Miss
  Loveapple started&mdash;outwardly a fair sunburnt girl in shorts, without a
  hat and carrying a packed lunch&mdash;but inwardly a humble and passionate
  pilgrim bound for Mecca.</p>

  <p>It was a brilliant morning of breeze and sunshine&mdash;of rolling white
  clouds and deep blue sky. Responsive to the weather, she felt alive in every
  bone and fibre&mdash;surcharged with energy, yet sensitive to the least
  impression. She wanted to absorb every detail, to hoard it in her memory and
  possess it, even the sun-warmed wood of her hard seat in the third-class
  carriage and the optical illusion of slanting buildings as the train rolled
  down the slope.</p>

  <p>It crossed the noisy little river and began to chug up the gradient, past
  meadows and dark fir-trees, up to the wilder region of boulders, dried water
  courses and grey-green cembra pines. As it rounded the last bend and she
  caught sight of the three snow giants, Miss Loveapple drew a deep breath.
  Still holding it, she staggered out of the carriage and stood staring
  upwards, as though stunned by the vision.</p>

  <p>In that moment, she felt dizzy and confused, yet strangely exalted. The
  blood was pounding in her head like a rush of waters. Something strong and
  vital was beating within her, in a struggle to escape. Part of her seemed to
  be soaring through space, even while her clumsy nailed shoes, clamped to the
  ground, were like an anchor dragging her back to earth.</p>

  <p>She started at the sound of a pedantic voice.</p>

  <p>'How insignificant one feels. What an impressive and magnificent
  spectacle.'</p>

  <p>'Very nice,' agreed Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>The monocled lady who had spoken glanced at her flushed face.</p>

  <p>'Does the altitude affect your blood-pressure?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Miss Loveapple triumphantly. 'I'm going higher.'</p>

  <p>On her way to the Jungfraujoch train, she became normal again. She
  realized that she was merely bound on an exciting adventure and that she was
  free from the exactions of company. She had barely settled herself in her
  carriage, however, when they came to a halt. After running along the ridge,
  they plunged into a short tunnel and emerged close to the vast glaciers of
  the range.</p>

  <p>During the stop at Eiger Glacier Station, she did not explore the ice
  grotto, but remained in the sunshine, on a balcony of the little hotel. As
  she lingered, there was a roar as of thunder and she saw a huge block of ice
  break away from an overhanging glacier of the Jungfrau, to fall far below
  down to the abyss of the Trümmleten Valley. The smash was so appalling that
  she was almost glad to return to the safety of the railway carriage.</p>

  <p>It took more than a quarter of an hour to run through the five-mile
  tunnel. After a while she grew bored with staring out at hard limestone walls
  and began to study her fellow-passengers. She was trying to group them in
  their various nationalities when her attention was caught by a couple whose
  faces seemed familiar.</p>

  <p>The man was dark, undersized and had a crafty expression. He was
  accompanied by a lady who was expensively and unsuitably dressed in black,
  trimmed with monkey-fur. As Miss Loveapple remarked the long and slightly
  crooked nose which flawed an otherwise beautiful face, she remembered where
  she had seen them before.</p>

  <p>'Victoria Station,' she thought. 'They look rather like crooks. The
  confidence kind. What are they doing up here? No good them asking us to find
  the lady. We all know which of the three is the Jungfrau.'</p>

  <p>Amused by her feeble joke, she sprang out at Eigerwand Station and pressed
  forward to get a good view from one of the high windows, of Grindelwald in
  the valley below. It was a clear day, so that she could see beyond the
  mountains of Central Switzerland to the Chains of the Jura, while the Black
  Forest was visible on the horizon.</p>

  <p>As she peered through the telescope, she did not know that she herself was
  under observation.</p>

  <p>'See that blonde before?' asked the small dark man.</p>

  <p>'At Vic,' replied his wife. 'The Ace was trailing her.'</p>

  <p>Clarence Club would have been proud had he heard his title. It was homage
  to mark their approval of the policeman's injuries&mdash;a printed
  description of which had brought sadistic joy to the small-fry of the
  profession.</p>

  <p>Naow,' said the man contemptuously. 'Not her. Look at her pants. They're
  something chronic. She's only a blasted girl scout.'</p>

  <p>'That's right,' agreed his wife.</p>

  <p>They took no further interest in Miss Loveapple, who travelled up to
  Eismeer Station in another carriage; and by the time the Jungfraujoch Station
  was reached, she had forgotten about them. She felt that she must be in a
  dream as she followed the trickle of passengers through a tunnel in the rock
  to the ground floor of the Berghaus. The waiting-room with its heated floor,
  the booking-offices and the restaurant&mdash;panelled in cembra
  pine&mdash;were so preposterously unexpected, that she could only gasp in
  wonder.</p>

  <p>She took the lift with the other tourists, but she did not follow them to
  the dining-room which was on the first floor. Instead she walked down the
  gallery, connecting the building with the plateau, while she jeered at her
  own enforced economy.</p>

  <p>'Three houses&mdash;and can't rise to the price of a meal. It stinks.'</p>

  <p>When she got outside into the rare air, the view was almost overpowering.
  All that she had seen only in parts from the lower stations was now visible
  as a whole. Around her was the dazzle of sun upon snow as she gazed from the
  green meadows and valley on the Grindelwald side across to the chopped sea of
  glaciers and mountain peaks.</p>

  <p>'I'll have lunch here,' she decided.</p>

  <p>As she was unstrapping her knapsack, suddenly she began to feel strangely
  unreal, as though her body were dissolving while her brain swam in space.
  There was a roar in her ears but no avalanche fell.</p>

  <p>'I don't seem to be here,' she thought.</p>

  <p>In the silence that followed, she remembered the pedantic lady's remark
  about blood-pressure. Like most strong people, she was terrified by the
  threat of illness.</p>

  <p>'It's the altitude,' she told herself. 'It's affecting me. I must go down
  at once to the Kleine Scheidegg...Slowly. I mustn't rush. Dangerous...'</p>

  <p>The journey down from the Joch was anticlimax, when she grew very tired of
  sitting still. The marvels of a masterpiece of modern engineering took second
  place to the railway station at Kleine Scheidegg. Seated on the terrace, with
  coffee before her, she gazed rapturously at the pure cone of the
  Silberhorn.</p>

  <p>'Gosh,' she thought. 'I am lucky.'</p>

  <p>The disturbing sensation of being part of a dissolving film had departed.
  She no longer dipped and wavered, like a candle-flame in a breeze, but felt
  comfortably solid as the good earth. With a keen appetite she ate the entire
  contents of her lunch package&mdash;sandwiches, hard-boiled egg, cheese,
  chocolate and fruit. Then she lit a cigarette and surrendered herself to
  perfect happiness.</p>

  <p>'That view from the top was rather like the way they try to explain
  Einstein's time-theory,' she reflected. 'I saw the whole at once..."now I see
  all of it&mdash;only I'm dying"...That's Browning...I should hate to
  die.'</p>

  <p>At that moment dying seemed very far away&mdash;about as far as September
  the thirteenth. When she was on holiday, her thoughts rarely strayed to the
  date of her departure because of her fortunate capacity to live in each
  minute.</p>

  <p>As she sat and smoked, she studied every detail of the busy scene, with
  vivid interest. The union of trains coming and going from Grindelwald,
  Lauterbrunnen and the Joch made her compare the Pass with Clapham Junction.
  There was a constant ebb and flow of tourists and she heard every language
  which she was able to recognise.</p>

  <p>When a fresh train came down from the Jungfraujoch, she recognised two of
  the passengers as the doubtful couple she had first seen at Victoria Station.
  They took no notice of her as they flopped down at the next table. Both
  looked slightly green and the man ordered brandy with emphasis.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple glanced away from them and continued to gaze at the
  animated scene&mdash;the hotels, the bazaars, the post office and the great
  coloured umbrellas, under whose shade English people were drinking tea. There
  was a constant cluster around the great Zeiss telescopes as visitors tried to
  pick up climbers on the snow-slopes.</p>

  <p>Childishly she closed her eyes tightly&mdash;to wipe everything and
  everybody from the Pass, leaving it bare and empty&mdash;before she opened
  her lids and stared fixedly on the white summits.</p>

  <p>'I am alone with the mountains,' she exulted.</p>

  <p>As the thought flashed across her mind, she heard a voice.</p>

  <p>'Miss Loveapple. What are you doing up here?'</p>

  <p>She turned her head and saw Viva standing in the doorway of the station
  restaurant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THE JEWEL-CASE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE'S first disappointment was followed by anger
  with Buckingham. He had failed to keep his promise. It cost her an effort to
  disguise her resentment when she spoke to Viva.</p>

  <p>'I thought you went to Lauterbrunnen.'</p>

  <p>'I did,' explained Viva. 'But I felt at a loose end after Richard went. Of
  course, I did the Trummelbach Falls. They left me breathless. But one wants
  to share a marvellous experience. It seems selfish to be alone. So I came up
  the other side, by the Wengenalp Railway, on the chance of meeting someone I
  knew. I'm glad I met you.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I must be selfish,' said Miss Loveapple stonily. '<i>I</i>
  came up to see the mountains by myself.'</p>

  <p>Immediately Viva's face assumed a holy expression as she gazed at the
  triple range. Miss Loveapple knew what she was going to say and she was not
  impressed.</p>

  <p>'They make me feel small,' said Viva.</p>

  <p>'So can I,' Miss Loveapple reminded her. 'They haven't got to strain
  themselves.'</p>

  <p>'But surely they must make you feel small too?' persisted Viva, ignoring
  the flippancy.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was dimly aware of a voice which spoke within her.</p>

  <p>'No. They make me feel big. They remind me I am part of Eternity. I love
  them. I worship them. Under the shadow of their protection, I feel safe.'</p>

  <p>When she answered Viva's question, protective instinct made her conceal
  her real feeling.</p>

  <p>'It hasn't struck me that way. But they make a nice view. I must buy some
  postcards.'</p>

  <p>'I'll come with you...But first, I must look and <i>look.</i> Mountains
  always make me feel as though I were in church. More so, because there are no
  prayers and things to distract one...Have you a cigarette?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple told herself bitterly that Viva's share-out policy was
  being put into operation as she opened her case.</p>

  <p>'Matches,' suggested Viva.</p>

  <p>'I haven't any.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was shocked by her own lie. Her nature was so essentially
  generous that the fact that she was capable of grudging a trifle proved that
  her latent antipathy to Viva had flared up into actual dislike.</p>

  <p>Although it was impossible for her to point to actual discourtesy, the
  cumulative effect of infinitesimal slights was an impression that, in Viva's
  private opinion, she had not status. And now her perfect day was spoiled.
  Although she intended to escape, her liberty would cost her precious hours of
  solitude.</p>

  <p>She jumped up from the table.</p>

  <p>'I must get going,' she told Viva. 'I'm going to walk down to
  Grindelwald.'</p>

  <p>'You'd better not. Walking downhill all the way puts a strain on the same
  muscles. You'll feel your legs for days.'</p>

  <p>'I know. I expect to take them back with me. Sort of souvenir.'</p>

  <p>Viva's disdainful expression showed that she was not amused. This time it
  was Miss Loveapple who felt small, although her moment of triumph was
  near.</p>

  <p>A train which had just come down from the Joch was disgorging its load of
  tourists. At the sight of a beautiful woman with a faultless profile, Miss
  Loveapple's face lit up with excitement. She remembered to snatch up her
  case, as it held her money and her passport which was essential for the
  extension of her regional ticket; but she left her satchel behind her on the
  table and ran forward.</p>

  <p>'Lady Pontypool,' she cried, 'do you remember me? Highfield Fête.'</p>

  <p>With the gracious charm which&mdash;together with a memory for
  faces&mdash;had made her a social queen, Lady Pontypool recognised her
  immediately.</p>

  <p>'Of course, I remember you. How is my dear Sister Monica? Tell me about
  her. And about yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Mrs Bosanquet is more like herself than usual,' said Miss Loveapple.
  'She's bossing my wretched maid while I'm away.'</p>

  <p>Lady Pontypool laughed.</p>

  <p>'She still treats me as her patient&mdash;and a very naughty one,' she
  said. 'I adored the heather honey you sold me at your Fête. Are you going to
  buy that hat in Paris?'</p>

  <p>As they chatted, Miss Loveapple expanded in the genial sunshine of Lady
  Pontypool's friendliness.</p>

  <p>'You said we might meet,' she reminded her. 'It's marvellous that we have.
  I've been up to the Joch, but it felt too fabulous. Have you been staying
  there?'</p>

  <p>'For one night. I ran away from every one, including my maid. I'm not
  supposed to go so high. Don't tell Sister Monica. My car is waiting for me at
  Lauterbrunnen.'</p>

  <p>While they chatted Miss Loveapple's enjoyment was checked by a memory
  which made her feel violently self-conscious. All this time she had been
  holding Lady Pontypool's jewel-case. Although it was a discard, she
  remembered that Mrs Bosanquet had warned her not to expose the coronet, while
  in reality it was loaned only for her journey.</p>

  <p>With a sense of guilt, she thrust it behind her back while she tried to
  cover it with her woollen cardigan. Her stealthy movements attracted the
  attention of the couple who sat at the table next to hers.</p>

  <p>'Girl scout is hiding something,' remarked the man, whose name was
  Amor.</p>

  <p>'Maybe the Ace was on to something after all,' agreed Mrs Amor.</p>

  <p>They watched Miss Loveapple accompany Lady Pontypool to the Lauterbrunnen
  train and noticed the deferential manner in which she insisted on carrying
  her case and camera. When she returned to her table they both stared at her
  furtively, although Viva displayed only a languid interest.</p>

  <p>'Someone from your village?' she asked.</p>

  <p>The instinct to get even with Viva was too strong for Miss Loveapple to
  resist. She raised her voice.</p>

  <p>'Didn't you recognise her? That was Lady Pontypool.'</p>

  <p>The crooks heard. Within two seconds, they had marked Miss Loveapple as
  their prey. Amor instantly lit a cigarette and dropped the lighted match upon
  the ground. As he stooped to pick it up, he craned forward to get a close-up
  of the coronet on Miss Loveapple's case.</p>

  <p>It confirmed his suspicions. This woman was carrying Lady Pontypool's
  famous jewels. Straining his ears, he managed to overhear scraps of
  conversation from the next table.</p>

  <p>'Lady Pontypool?' repeated Viva in an agitated voice.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Miss Loveapple had seen her betray emotion. She
  seemed partly tremulous with excitement and partly staggered by the
  information.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' she said. 'I should have known her. She's exactly like her
  photographs. But I&mdash;I never knew she was a friend of yours.'</p>

  <p>Although elated by her triumph, Miss Loveapple was too honest to claim the
  honour.</p>

  <p>'She's not a friend,' she explained. 'I just know her...It's beginning to
  cloud over. I must start. See you later.'</p>

  <p>At the same time, Amor snapped his fingers to the waiter and paid for the
  brandy. As Miss Loveapple swung down the first steep gradient of the path, he
  and his wife boarded the Grindelwald train. Although their second-class
  carriage was empty, they sat close together and spoke in whispers.</p>

  <p>'That was her maid,' said Mrs Amor. 'I heard she was big and blonde.
  Explains what she wore at Vic. I said to myself, "That was never made for
  <i>you.</i>" I said, "That's been a good suit in its day, but that was a long
  time ago and corpses shouldn't be dug up." Of course, it was one of her
  perks.'</p>

  <p>'Shut up,' growled Amor. 'The Ace was on to her. We've got to figure this
  out.'</p>

  <p>They had read in the papers that Lady Pontypool was motoring on the
  Continent and had worn her jewels at opera and ball, at the various capitals.
  As they were only humble crooks, they had taken little interest in the fact,
  for they knew that swell members of the profession were certain to cover her
  movements.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed as though a woman's freak had thrown the chance of a
  lifetime into their lap. On a former occasion, Lady Pontypool's jewels had
  been stolen during a train journey on the Continent. It was possible that she
  had decided to travel back alone by way of Switzerland and send her maid on
  with the jewels, to Paris. Although they had not noticed the actual
  interchange, they must have met by appointment at such an isolated little
  junction. Moreover the stealthy way in which the maid had tried to hide the
  jewel-case was of utmost significance.</p>

  <p>It was not a brilliant diagnosis, for they were doomed never to rise in
  their profession, but Amor had a line of his own which was connected with
  lonely women and handbags.</p>

  <p>'You go back to the hotel and get packed ready to leave,' he told his
  wife. 'I'll drop off at Alpiglen and wait for her behind the rocks and trees
  lower down. I'll trip her up and snatch up the case and run. Take her by
  surprise, I will.'</p>

  <p>'You'll have to put her to sleep first,' objected his wife. 'She's worth
  two of you.'</p>

  <p>'But I haven't got my tools with me.'</p>

  <p>'You ought to be a plumber...Here's my scarf. Find a nice shaped stone and
  wrap it inside. You'll get a good swing with the ends.'</p>

  <p>Amor looked rather doubtful, for he was accustomed to operate on elderly
  ladies who wore their hair dressed high and trimmed hats.</p>

  <p>'Suppose she's got one of these thin skulls and I slug too hard,' he said.
  'She's got no hat.'</p>

  <p>'Then that will be too bad for her,' remarked his wife.</p>

  <p>While they prepared to surprise her, Miss Loveapple began to bounce down
  the steep path of the descent. It was rough going, but her spirits were high.
  Exhilarated by the scenery and the solitude, her voice rang out in jubilant
  song.</p>

  <p>She believed that she was leaping lightly as a chamois, when she heard a
  rattle of stones on the path behind her.</p>

  <p>'Stop,' called Viva. 'I'm coming too.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; FACE VALUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE'S expression was grim as she dug her heel
  into the slippery path and waited for Viva. Her action was symbolic, since
  she had reached the limit of her patience and meant to make a stand against
  further encroachment. She reminded herself that she had a right to enjoy her
  holiday in her own way, so that at the risk of being rude, she intended to
  clarify the fact.</p>

  <p>While she was searching for words which would explain the position with
  the minimum of offence, Viva began to speak.</p>

  <p>'Do you mind me coming too? I want a private talk...I have a confession to
  make.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple's eyes lit up with interest.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>'I'll tell you when we are walking. I want exercise myself.'</p>

  <p>'It's a stiff walk down.'</p>

  <p>'I'll take the train at Alpiglen.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple reflected that she would be free from company ultimately,
  as Viva began to lead the way&mdash;springing lightly across the débris of
  stones and smashed fir-trees, where a landslip had diverted the track. When
  the path was comparatively smooth again, she broke the silence.</p>

  <p>'Don't look so thrilled. It's not murder or anything dashing. It's just
  awkward. The fact is I've given you all a false impression. You think me a
  Society girl. But I'm not to blame. I told you my name that first night in
  the train. I thought every woman knew "Viva".'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple began to see a glimmer of light.</p>

  <p>'Are you a business?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Of course, I am. I control the leading Toilet Salon in the West End. I am
  famous. My clients include Royalty, besides the leaders of Society and the
  stage. I was simply <i>staggered</i> when none of you recognised my
  name.'</p>

  <p>Her voice vibrated with such indignation that Miss Loveapple tried to
  console her.</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I'm out of all these things myself.'</p>

  <p>Viva ignored her apology.</p>

  <p>'I thought it might create awkwardness if I explained then,' she went on,
  'so I left things as they were. It was a refreshing novelty to be out of the
  limelight. Of course, when we said "Good-bye" I intended to give you my
  business cards and offer you reduced terms, or free treatment in return for
  the introduction of new clients.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple began to feel that she had paid a stiff price to gratify
  her curiosity.</p>

  <p>'But we've not said "Good-bye" yet,' she remarked bluntly. 'Why did you
  run after me now?'</p>

  <p>'Because of Lady Pontypool,' exclaimed Viva breathlessly. 'I simply
  couldn't wait to put a proposition to you. You see, I had no idea that she
  was a friend of yours.'</p>

  <p>'She isn't.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes she is. You were laughing together and I heard her ask you to
  give her love to her sister, Monica. Please don't prevaricate. This is of
  vital importance to me.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'I want you to persuade Lady Pontypool to patronise my Salon. I'll pay you
  a percentage on every treatment and purchase. We'll settle the terms later,
  but I promise you they shall be generous.'</p>

  <p>Her voice was so eager that Miss Loveapple felt guilty of having raised
  her hopes unintentionally.</p>

  <p>'No,' she said curtly. 'I can't do it. I have told you already she is
  <i>not</i> a friend.'</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Viva did not believe her, for she continued to press
  the point.</p>

  <p>'It would be a mutual benefit. Lady Pontypool is quite beautiful, but she
  lacks specialised glamour. I could do a lot with her face. The Duchess of
  Mulberry's face is one of ours. We also made the face which got Lina
  Leominster her best contract...I'm always on the qui vive for ideas straight
  from Nature. In fact, I never see a face without breaking it up inside my
  mind and then putting it together properly.'</p>

  <p>As she listened, Miss Loveapple understood what had puzzled her formerly.
  Viva's words explained that impersonal gaze which considered a human being as
  a facial problem. They were also a key to her unselfish consideration for
  others, which had seemed so strangely divorced from genuine kindliness.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' thought Miss Loveapple, 'it must be second nature for her to
  give service to the customer.'</p>

  <p>She chuckled involuntarily, but her amusement was checked when Viva
  switched from faces in general to her own personal appearance.</p>

  <p>'I could transform you,' she promised. 'You've got something there. But
  you are too straight. I should make you slant slightly&mdash;brows, lips,
  eyes. And your hair is too springy. It looks like live hair. It needs
  plastic-varnish treatment, to make it suggest metal.'</p>

  <p>'Not me, thanks,' cried Miss Loveapple hastily. 'It may sound conceited,
  but confidentially, I rather like my face. Anyway, it's clean. I could sweep
  a chimney without looking dirty.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' conceded Viva generously, 'your colouring is marvellous. But it's
  Nature&mdash;and Nature can't compete with Art. She hasn't the organisation
  or the resources. We have such an infinite variety of shades to blend.'</p>

  <p>'Such as&mdash;?' prompted Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>The question was guileful, since she was not interested in cosmetics. She
  only wanted to encourage Viva to lecture on her special subject, so that she
  could devote her attention to the piled-up mountain scenery.</p>

  <p>'I shall get rid of her at Alpiglen,' she reminded herself.</p>

  <p>By this time the little train had reached Alpiglen and lost a passenger.
  Amor slipped from his carriage unobtrusively and began to slither down the
  path which rounded the base of the Eiger. In spite of town boots, his
  progress was swift, for he had the sure step and balance of one who combined
  dancing with a dash of cat-burglary.</p>

  <p>Whenever he heard voices, he was careful to hide behind a tree or a
  boulder. He had learned, by bitter experience, the importance of not being
  confused with that sinister-looking character, which&mdash;according to
  witnesses&mdash;was always observed in the neighbourhood of a crime.</p>

  <p>Besides this precaution, he had to collect a suitable instrument for his
  attack on Lady Pontypool's maid. This part of the programme annoyed him
  because he had a dislike of makeshift tools. Presently, however, he found a
  stone which was of requisite weight and shape. After padding it carefully
  with his socks, he knotted it inside his wife's scarf and began to practise
  his stroke.</p>

  <p>When he had stunned a few fir-trees, he felt he had mastered the technique
  sufficiently to choose the spot. After descending the mountain slope for some
  distance, he selected a position in the dense shadow of crowded firs, where
  he could hide between great boulders which overhung the path. Its gradient
  was especially steep, so that if it rained, as it threatened, the track would
  be a mud-slide.</p>

  <p>'She'll drop with such a wallop that she'll think she slipped down on her
  tail and bumped her head,' he thought.</p>

  <p>It was even possible that in her dazed condition, she might stagger down
  towards the valley without realising her loss. Later, when she returned to
  search for her case, she might either be too confused to find the exact spot
  where she had fallen, or she might conclude that, in the interval, it had
  been found by some dishonest person.</p>

  <p>Crouching on the mossy ground, while he leaned against the supporting
  rocks, Amor chewed gum, since he was afraid to smoke. He was appreciative of
  the cleverness of Lady Pontypool's ruse because it had failed to delude his
  superior brain. To his mind, it seemed subtle to dress the maid as a hiker
  and make her walk down to Grindelwald&mdash;in support of her
  character&mdash;with practically thousands of pounds hidden in her old canvas
  knapsack, while the big shots were trailing the mistress's car.</p>

  <p>The worst feature of the business was a long and uncomfortable wait. In
  spite of cramp, he dared not relax, lest he should doze and miss the sound of
  footsteps. To get his start, he had to catch a train which allowed him too
  much time, for Miss Loveapple was still only just within sight of the little
  station.</p>

  <p>'Here's Alpiglen,' she announced joyfully.</p>

  <p>She was high above a sea of tree-tops, yet she would drop lower and lower
  and still see the green roof lying at her feet. The wide stretch of valley
  filled her with a sense of expansion and liberty. She felt invigorated by the
  keen air&mdash;excited by the wind which whistled as it drove the rain-clouds
  before it. Anticipating the joy of freedom, she spoke to Viva with genuine
  warmth.</p>

  <p>'We part here. You won't have to wait long for a train. It's nice of you
  to tell me about yourself. I appreciate it.'</p>

  <p>'Then you'll come in with me on Lady Pontypool?' asked Viva eagerly.</p>

  <p>'No. That really is final. Good-bye. I shall think of you on my walk. You
  are rather marvellous&mdash;to look like a little girl when you are a famous
  business-woman.'</p>

  <p>'You don't know the half of it. Wait till I tell you how I started. I had
  no money or influence. But a business man put up the capital because he had
  faith in me. The offer had no strings to it and I paid him back within three
  years.'</p>

  <p>To Miss Loveapple's dismay, Viva walked past the station without a pause
  and proceeded to follow the downward path. She began to realise that her
  effort to soften her refusal with a compliment had been fatal policy, since
  it had launched Viva on the recital of a success-story.</p>

  <p>'You'd better not try to walk down to Grindelwald,' she urged. 'It's
  steeper farther down.'</p>

  <p>'It won't affect me,' boasted Viva. 'I'm never out of condition. League of
  Health and Beauty, skating and swimming&mdash;and so on. I let my secretaries
  do all my sitting.'</p>

  <p>'But it's going to rain.'</p>

  <p>'Good. I shall be able to give my skin a shock.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple resigned herself to endure a stretch of elongated monologue
  as Viva enumerated the successive stages of her triumphant progress. The wind
  spattered their faces with the first drops of the storm and then the rain
  began to fall in a fine steady shower. Protected by the trees, at first they
  only realised it as a soft pattering sound overhead, but as it grew heavier,
  the firs ceased to act as umbrellas. The path became soft and turned
  presently to mud which poulticed the soles of their shoes.</p>

  <p>'You'd better go back to Alpiglen,' said Miss Loveapple hopefully. 'You'll
  be soaked.'</p>

  <p>'What about you?' asked Viva.</p>

  <p>'I like rain.'</p>

  <p>'So do I. We can't catch cold while we are walking.'</p>

  <p>'But your trousers will never look the same again.'</p>

  <p>'They're only holiday kit. My maid packed and I didn't know what she put
  in. I rely on her taste implicitly. She looks after all my clothes for
  me.'</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple listened, she decided to suppress mention of her Elsie,
  who was not even capable of polishing a floor. She tried to forget her
  companion and accept the challenge of the storm, as she threw back her head
  and expanded her lungs. Driven by the wind, the rain dashed against her face,
  deluged her hair and dripped down her neck.</p>

  <p>She loved it all&mdash;the friction of soaked clothing against her skin,
  the invigorating air, the earthy and resinous odours, released by the
  downpour. The rain drew out something else not so pleasant&mdash;enormous
  black slugs which crawled across the path. Viva screamed at the sight of
  them, but Miss Loveapple only laughed.</p>

  <p>'They are better looking than certain people they remind me of,' she
  remarked. 'The dark slimy sort. There was a perfect specimen up at the
  Scheidegg. I almost expected him to leave a damp trail behind him when he
  walked.'</p>

  <p>By this time they had nearly reached the spot where Amor was ambushed. He
  was in a miserable plight, for he dared not move and was only partially
  protected by the boulders behind which he crouched. In spite of drenched
  clothing and aching muscles, he had to remain poised and vigilant, so as not
  to miss the first sounds of his victim's approach.</p>

  <p>After one or two false alarms, when he ducked behind the rocks to escape
  observation, he heard Miss Loveapple's footsteps, slipping and squelching
  down the streaming path. She was well in advance of Viva who had ceased to
  chatter, since her words were blown behind her. Peering at her, Amor was
  surprised to notice how thoroughly she sustained her character of hiker, for
  she was smiling and showed no signs of distress.</p>

  <p>'She must be a blasted Swiss miss,' he decided.</p>

  <p>The next second his face turned livid with rage and disappointment as a
  second figure&mdash;slim and trousered&mdash;appeared around the bend. He had
  not foreseen the complication of a companion, while he waited for a solitary
  female. Cursing the pair of them, he dodged between the boulders and wormed
  himself under cover of the drenched vegetation beside the track.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple gave a start and then clutched at the support of a pine, as
  she wiped the rain from her eyes.</p>

  <p>'I'm seeing things,' she shouted to Viva. 'I could have sworn I saw the
  top of a man's head with black shiny hair, just there. But it's only a bit of
  rock.'</p>

  <p>By now the path had become so steep that it was little better than a
  rushing torrent and they had to swing from one fir-trunk to another, in order
  to keep their footing. When they reached the wet spongy meadows and the first
  chalet, although they still had some distance to walk, they felt practically
  home again.</p>

  <p>'Don't tell any one what I told you,' Viva warned Miss Loveapple. 'I think
  Mrs Furse might introduce some useful people, if she is approached the right
  way.'</p>

  <p>'I won't mention it,' promised Miss Loveapple. 'I'm still amazed. I looked
  on you as very very feminine and only wanting to be married.'</p>

  <p>'Go on thinking like that. I am&mdash;and I do.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you'd give up your career for a man?'</p>

  <p>'Never.'</p>

  <p>'Then you'd support a husband?'</p>

  <p>'That's the last thing I would do. What I want is to incorporate a husband
  with my business. Make him pull his weight and give him a joint-interest, or
  he'd lose his self-respect and then I could not respect him. He must have a
  strong independent character. You see, I'm luckier than you. A man needn't
  marry <i>me</i> for my money.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly the conversation began to assume significance to Miss
  Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'What profession?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'A chemist,' replied Viva. 'He could go in for research work. An important
  medical discovery was made through experiments with dyes. Don't you think it
  would be ideal, especially with so many clever young men only waiting for a
  real opportunity and start?'</p>

  <p>'I expect you'll get your wish.'</p>

  <p>'I usually do.'</p>

  <p>Viva's voice was so quietly confident that, for the first time, Miss
  Loveapple recognised her possession of a strong and vital character.</p>

  <p>She was silent on their way down to the river which was swollen with
  glacier-water and thickly overhung with a pall of condensed vapour. When she
  considered the subject honestly, she admitted that alliance with Viva would
  be a satisfactory solution to Buckingham's difficulties&mdash;especially as
  she did not wish to marry him herself.</p>

  <p>In her opinion, people should marry when quite young, or not at all,
  except for reasons of companionship or expediency. She herself had known the
  rapture and sting of unappeased love, in her early youth. The unresponsive
  young man's name was 'David' and she kept his memory fresh through the medium
  of more than one loved pet.</p>

  <p>Since she had acquired economic independence, she had been completely
  happy. Her nature was practical rather than sentimental and she had a tidy
  mind. She was never ill&mdash;never bored&mdash;never lonely. In the
  circumstances, therefore, to grudge Buckingham to Viva would be to display a
  mean and selfish disposition.</p>

  <p>When they parted in the hotel, she spoke to Viva.</p>

  <p>'Good luck,' she said.</p>

  <p>Stepping gingerly over the polished wooden stairs, she reached her room
  and gave her sodden clothing to the chambermaid. Refreshed by a hot bath, she
  felt restored and at peace with the world, as she stood at her window,
  smoking and drinking tea. By contrast with her comforts, she could appreciate
  more fully the grandeur of the storm as it swept across the valley in sheets
  of torrential rain.</p>

  <p>Presently through the streaming pane, she saw the back of a man when he
  passed the hotel. She noticed that his ankles were bare as he limped along in
  sodden patent-leather boots. His drenched clothing stuck to his spare form,
  so that he looked dilapidated as last year's scarecrow, while he left behind
  him an oozing trail.</p>

  <p>His dejection touched Miss Loveapple's warm heart. Raising her cup, she
  drank a toast to the unconscious Amor.</p>

  <p>'Not your day out,' she said aloud. 'We're in the same boat, little man.
  Better luck next time.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; NOCTURNAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BUCKINGHAM looked guilty when he met Miss Loveapple in the
  lounge that evening.</p>

  <p>'I forgot that there were two ways up,' he said defensively.</p>

  <p>'Not your fault,' conceded Miss Loveapple. 'It didn't pan out as I hoped.
  That's all.'</p>

  <p>'But you think I let you down?'</p>

  <p>'Does it matter? Whichever way it turned out, it would be over now. It's
  far more important for you to keep your promise.'</p>

  <p>'You can depend on me to be at Victoria Station, on September the
  thirteenth, to meet the seven-fifteen from the Continent. Whatever turns up,
  I shall be there.'</p>

  <p>It was a definite relief to Miss Loveapple to know that he had memorised
  the date of her return. Although her common sense made her resolve to subdue
  any superstition which might clash with business, she had been aware of a
  subconscious reluctance to think of the end of her holiday. She recognised
  this as a heritage of her experiences in London, for it faded completely
  after Buckingham's offer to accompany her back to the empty house.</p>

  <p>'I haven't told you the sale of the house to your brother-in-law has gone
  through,' she said. 'At noon, September the fourteenth, I cease to own
  nineteen Madeira. The prepaid rent has been deducted from my cheque, of
  course.'</p>

  <p>'What will you do with the cash?' asked Buckingham.</p>

  <p>'Buy another town house, of course. It may not be London again. Harrogate
  or Bath, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I give you up. You should be simple&mdash;but your mind is far too
  complex for me.'</p>

  <p>He turned to Viva with obvious reluctance when she joined them.</p>

  <p>'Richard,' she appealed, 'do find out what's wrong with my camera.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple left them together, but she felt the old Eve rising in
  rebellion. Her sense of ownership had been assaulted. She resented the cool
  way in which Viva had ignored her own feelings&mdash;if any&mdash;in the
  matter and also the feline stab when she suggested that Buckingham's interest
  in herself was mercenary.</p>

  <p>'I've only to lift my little finger to take him away from her,' she
  thought. 'I'd like her to know that.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Furse and Olivia were having coffee at the far end of the lounge and
  they beckoned to her to join them. When she reached them, Olivia, whose face
  was sunburnt to the colour of a crimson apple, cautioned her with habitual
  bluntness.</p>

  <p>'Don't let her take him away from you. He's yours. I've seen him look at
  you...if any one looked at me like that, I'd pass out, "James Lee."'</p>

  <p>'She can have him,' said Miss Loveapple crossly. 'I don't intend to marry.
  I know when I'm well off. I look younger and I have better health than most
  of my school-fellows who are married and have families.'</p>

  <p>'Don't I know it?' groaned Mrs Furse. 'You may not believe it, but I used
  to be an athlete. I actually played at Wimbledon, if I didn't survive the
  first round. Having Olivia has made me the wreck I am.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple failed to feel sympathetic, for she had proved the
  fragile-looking lady to be possessed of tireless energy. However, she valued
  her opinion as a woman of the world, so she listened attentively as Mrs Furse
  went on speaking.</p>

  <p>'Really, my dear, you would be mental to marry now. You've left it too
  late.'</p>

  <p>'I'm only twenty-eight,' said Miss Loveapple indignantly.</p>

  <p>'I wasn't alluding to age. I mean you haven't a flexible mind. Your ideas
  are as set as jelly should be when it's properly boiled. You like your
  comfort and you like your own way. It would break you up to have a man
  rooting among your things and interfering with your garden. He'd want an
  onion-bed where you want to plant carnations.'</p>

  <p>'No. Onions for me, every time.'</p>

  <p>'Then he'll want carnations...If you take my advice, you'll know when you
  are well off. You already have the things which women marry to get&mdash;an
  income and a house.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple had already noticed the existence of a censorship on the
  subject of her other two houses. Apparently only the Pond House was
  recognised as legitimate property.</p>

  <p>She smiled derisively when, after her championship of celibacy, Mrs Furse
  became aware suddenly of treachery to her sex.</p>

  <p>'All the same,' she concluded weakly, 'every woman should get
  married.'</p>

  <p>Now you're just being conventional,' jeered Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>She felt pleasantly languid and disinclined to stir from her chair as she
  watched the scene with the detachment of a spectator. In contrast with the
  ornate luxury of the lakeside hotels, the room was bare and simple. Plain
  white net curtains barely veiled the windows and revealed the background of
  firs on the mountain slopes. The electric light pendants were shaped like
  flower-cups. As the orchestra had begun to play, the inevitable couples
  danced on the bare space in the middle of the waxed floor.</p>

  <p>Reinforced by Mrs Furse's advice, she reminded herself that in a week's
  time she would be back again at the Pond House, restored to home-ties and
  local tradition&mdash;reclaimed by familiar routine.</p>

  <p>'The Pond House is <i>real,</i>' she thought. 'It's my whole life and I
  mustn't risk losing it...But soon, all this will seem a dream. And these
  people won't matter any more.'</p>

  <p>Among the dancers was Viva, whose energy rebuked her own lethargy.
  Although she was not as tired as she expected to be, the muscles in the back
  of her legs were beginning to localise themselves. Not caring to remain in
  the background, she hoisted herself from her low basket-chair and went up to
  her room.</p>

  <p>When she was undressed, she came out to her veranda, to smoke a last
  cigarette. All the front rooms on the first floor opened on a common veranda;
  but even in the daytime, the visitors were scrupulous about remaining in
  their own sections and did not promenade, lest they surprise the privacy of
  others. At night, most of the English kept their French windows wide open,
  although Continental guests and nervous people were careful to close their
  jalousies.</p>

  <p>As she gazed at the mountains, Miss Loveapple reviewed Viva's plans for
  Buckingham's future.</p>

  <p>'Fine,' she thought. 'Give him a microscope and let him make stinks, and
  he'll be happy. He'll probably discover something which will bring her in a
  fortune and that will appeal to his pride. It's all fine.'</p>

  <p>She did not know that during the entire time she remained on the veranda,
  she was under observation. On the other side of the road and nearly opposite
  the hotel was a Pension which she rarely noticed. Sitting in the window of a
  darkened bedroom was a woman in a lilac wrapper trimmed with dejected fronds
  which bore as little resemblance to feathers as harbour scum to sea foam. She
  held field-glasses to her eyes while she entertained her husband with a
  ribald commentary on the different stages of Miss Loveapple's toilet.</p>

  <p>'She's got sauce, not drawing her curtains to undress,' she remarked. 'And
  now she's out on the veranda in her nightie. Well, we've got her room number.
  It's the third from left.'</p>

  <p>A minute later she finished her report on a note of triumph.</p>

  <p>'Her light's out and she's left her window open.'</p>

  <p>'Check up on the rest,' advised Amor, who shivered in bed, although he
  wore his dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>Although he had not heard her hopes for his future success, the little
  man&mdash;whose plight had moved Miss Loveapple to pity&mdash;was already
  preparing to try again. If his wife's observations confirmed his hopes, his
  second attempt on her person and property was scheduled for the following
  night.</p>

  <p>The people at the hotel kept early hours, so soon after twelve Mrs Amor
  was able to return to her bed.</p>

  <p>'It's in the bag,' she gloated. 'There's one room which never lit up. So
  late in the season as this, it's sure to be empty.'</p>

  <p>'I'll rent it to-morrow,' said Amor.</p>

  <p>'And leave me here without h. or c.'</p>

  <p>'Well, who had to lay in that chronic rain to-day?'</p>

  <p>'Cheer up...Law, I've had some laughs tonight. There was one regular old
  maid, but she left her window open. What I call hopeful.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Amor might not have been so amused had she known that the lady in
  question&mdash;who was a dean's sister&mdash;would play a more important part
  in Miss Loveapple's drama than mere comic relief.</p>

  <p>The following day's the visitors at the hotel were interested to hear of a
  romance. Two of the visitors who had come out to Switzerland to
  climb&mdash;both college students and belonging to the Oxford
  Group&mdash;admitted to their engagement, since they were too much in love to
  keep their happiness a secret.</p>

  <p>Viva appeared to be especially thrilled by the news. Watching her
  excitement, Miss Loveapple wondered whether she anticipated her own
  marriage.</p>

  <p>'Look at the future bridegroom,' she cried, smiling at the youth who was
  beaming acknowledgment of the congratulations. 'He's radiant.'</p>

  <p>Buckingham grunted scornfully.</p>

  <p>'Any chap's a chump to propose on a holiday,' he said. 'He's bound to
  confuse the girl with her background. I know a fellow who got engaged on a
  cruise. The marriage was off within a year. He admitted to me afterwards that
  he proposed to a fjord and part of a girl&mdash;but he had to marry the girl
  only, and he wasn't stuck on the other bit of her.'</p>

  <p>'Are you warning us not to hope until you come knocking at our doors?'
  asked Viva.</p>

  <p>'I wasn't being personal. Besides, I have met Miss Loveapple in her London
  House.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple purposely avoided Buckingham for the rest of the day. The
  whole party climbed up to the Bregg in the afternoon, and from that
  starting-point went on a stiff walk. There was no dancing in the evening, for
  every one was tired. The presence of a new guest was unnoticed, as the
  retiring little man in question dined in the restaurant and did not appear in
  any of the public rooms.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple lost no time in getting to bed. She hurried over her
  undressing and neglected to pay her nightly homage to the mountains from the
  veranda. Soon after her head was on the pillow she was sound asleep.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she opened her eyes with a start. 'There's someone in the room,'
  she thought.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; NIGHTMARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS she raised herself on one elbow and stared into the
  semi-darkness, Miss Loveapple realised that her breathing was quickened,
  while her forearms tingled, as though before a thunder-storm. But although
  she felt uneasy and suspicious, she was perplexed rather than afraid. She
  could not understand why she had received this impression of an intruder.
  Whatever its cause&mdash;a rustle, a gasp, a stir in the air&mdash;it was too
  impalpable to be other than a trick of imagination.</p>

  <p>Switching on the light, she looked around her room. It was very untidy,
  for in her haste to get to bed she had strewn her clothes impartially over
  the furniture and floor&mdash;producing the effect of a clothes-line hit by a
  gale. Apart from the disorder, however, she could detect nothing unusual.</p>

  <p>'Nothing here,' she thought. 'Whatever made me jump up like that? I wonder
  if the altitude is beginning to affect me again. I am about three thousand
  feet up.'</p>

  <p>The open French window framed a panel of night sky and mountain. For a
  moment she thought of closing the jalousies, only to reject the idea. All the
  visitors whose rooms opened on to the veranda were above suspicion, while her
  own door leading to the corridor was locked.</p>

  <p>'Shall I get up and search the room?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>There were only two places where any one could hide&mdash;inside the
  cupboard-wardrobe and under the bed. A vision of herself stooping down to
  search for a man was so suggestive of old-fashioned music hall humour that
  she began to laugh at the mere idea. While she was trying to make the effort
  of leaving her comfortable mattress, her lids drooped and she began to
  yawn.</p>

  <p>'If I don't lie down again while I'm still heavy, my brain will get
  started and then I'll lie awake for hours,' she warned herself.</p>

  <p>Switching off the light, she shut her eyes and relaxed her muscles. Before
  she drifted into unconsciousness, however, she had to drive away two
  will-o'-the-wisp fancies. The first was a feeling that, although she had not
  reassembled her shed garments, but left each lying where it fell, she could
  not remember pulling out any drawers or opening her suitcase, contrary to the
  evidence. The second was an unpleasant reminder of an empty room which also
  opened out to the veranda. Its corridor door was kept locked; but one of the
  hotel staff might have stolen the key and gone on a thieving prowl.</p>

  <p>The intrusion of these ideas robbed her of real rest. Since she had been
  in Grindelwald, stiff exercise and mountain air had combined to make her
  sleep heavily. Now, however, like an iceberg&mdash;only seven-eighths of her
  senses were wholly submerged; the remaining one-eighth&mdash;vigilant and on
  guard&mdash;resisted oblivion.</p>

  <p>After a confused and uneasy dream of being followed by an unseen tracker,
  suddenly she awoke to the reality of fingers plucking at her pillow. Someone
  leaned over her in the darkness. Even as she realised the fact she was
  shocked into instantaneous reaction. Screaming automatically, she hit the
  dark form with all the muscular force she had acquired from polishing
  floors.</p>

  <p>The effort taxed her strength and hurt her hand. Panting with pain and
  anger, she switched on her light. She was too late to catch a glimpse of the
  man, but as she rushed out on to the veranda she collided with
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>His hair was rough and he wore a dark dressing-gown. Before he could
  speak, she slapped his face vigorously.</p>

  <p>'That will teach you to come into my room,' she said.</p>

  <p>He caught her hand as she was about to give a repeat performance.</p>

  <p>'I'm hanged if I came into your room,' he shouted indignantly. 'I heard
  you yell and thought you were murdered. No such luck.'</p>

  <p>'Oh&mdash;sorry. I&mdash;I was only half-awake when I biffed you. But,
  really, there was a man in my room.'</p>

  <p>'Did you see him?'</p>

  <p>'Not actually. It was dark.'</p>

  <p>By the time that other guests had joined them on the veranda, Miss
  Loveapple was beginning to feel she had made a fool of herself. They
  completed her confusion by crowding inside her untidy room and searching it,
  to demonstrate that she was the victim of a nightmare. She was almost
  convinced herself before they drifted back to their own rooms.</p>

  <p>Not all the guests were present on the veranda. Among the absentees were
  Mrs Furse, who sent her scout, Olivia, to report while she guarded her toilet
  secrets. The dean's sister also remained in her bed and suffered the
  commotion in grim silence. She held an important position in the scholastic
  world, and had come to Switzerland to recuperate after a strenuous
  session.</p>

  <p>As the girls passed her open window on their way back to their rooms, she
  overheard Viva's remark to Olivia.</p>

  <p>'You can't blame a man making a fool of himself if he's been led to expect
  a welcome.'</p>

  <p>The lady mentally filed the comment for future reference.</p>

  <p>Soon the veranda was empty and silent again. There had been a time,
  however, when a sharp-eyed person&mdash;who chanced to glance in the right
  direction&mdash;might have seen a figure steal from the hotel garden and
  across the road to the darkened Pension.</p>

  <p>The watcher was Mrs Amor, returning to her ground-floor bedroom, by way of
  her window.</p>

  <p>The following morning, in the clean glitter of sunlight and the fresh
  mountain air, she met her husband at a little patisserie on the main street.
  Seated at a painted table on the pavement, they watched the shrunken stream
  of tourists, while they sipped raspberry-sirop, to sustain their
  impersonation of harmless trippers. The woman still wore black georgette,
  trimmed with monkey-fur, and high-heeled toeless sandals, to reveal scarlet
  nails, while both were heavy-eyed and resentful over their failure.</p>

  <p>'I was planted in that dam' garden, waiting for you to drop the doings,
  for donkeys' years,' complained Mrs Amor. 'What got unstuck?'</p>

  <p>'She woke up and landed me a kidney-punch,' growled Amor.</p>

  <p>'Cor, why didn't you try again?'</p>

  <p>'With her waiting for me with the poker next time? Not half.'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;when?'</p>

  <p>'To-night. She's got the ice all right. Case was under her pillow...She
  won't suspect me. I'm laying low. I had my coffee brought up to my room this
  morning.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Amor scratched her nose reflectively.</p>

  <p>'She'll shut her window to-night, unless she's loopy,' she prophesied.</p>

  <p>'Safe to,' agreed her husband. 'Only I'm not coming in through the window.
  Her room's next to mine with connecting doors. Both locked, of course, and
  the keys removed. I'm going to get some wire this morning, and if I can't
  pick them locks I'll chuck everything and go into the Church.'</p>

  <p>His eyes glinted viciously as he added, 'I'll bring my tools with me and
  make a job of it to-night.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Amor stared at him in surprise, for they were cowardly and timid
  marauders who took no risks, but preferred to pick the bones after someone
  else's kill.</p>

  <p>'It might be manslaughter,' she warned him.</p>

  <p>'And it might not. I've been over the course. She's a heavy sleeper at
  first. Last night I left it too late.'</p>

  <p>'Snores?'</p>

  <p>'No, but she breathes deep. I shall know. I'll cosh her before I get on
  with the job...She's coming with a bloke.'</p>

  <p>Both turned their heads and professed an interest in the patisserie
  window, as Miss Loveapple and Buckingham passed them. Neither noticed the
  couple, for she gazed steadfastly at the mountains, while he was lighting his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>As he looked after her, Amor glared spitefully at her strong back and her
  straight tanned legs. She wore no hat and her hair glittered in the sunlight.
  In his imagination, he aimed a blow at that fair head...He saw it streaked
  with bloodstains and he drew a deep breath of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple bore no trace of her disturbed night as she swung easily up
  the steep incline. Her blue eyes were deep and happy, reflecting the
  refreshment of her spirit. She had breakfasted early to escape unwelcome
  publicity.</p>

  <p>'I feel such a fool about last night,' she confided to Buckingham. 'The
  hotel seems to think I was dreaming.'</p>

  <p>'One-half of the hotel,' he corrected her. 'The other half thinks I
  gate-crashed.'</p>

  <p>'Fools.'</p>

  <p>'What's your own idea&mdash;if any?'</p>

  <p>She frowned thoughtfully as her gaze explored the distance.</p>

  <p>'I think it was a mix-up,' she replied. 'One of the Wharton boys told me,
  this morning, that there's a man in the room next to mine. He described him
  as a little wart. It's probable that he wandered out on the veranda, to look
  at the moon or mountains, and mistook my open door for his own. If he did,
  I've given him a real bump of locality. I hit out like mad.'</p>

  <p>Buckingham did not join in her laughter. He listened intently as she went
  on speaking.</p>

  <p>'The queer part is that I woke up, before that, and thought someone was in
  the room. You know that feeling, when the air seems to be still moving?'</p>

  <p>He nodded while his lips grew stern.</p>

  <p>'Promise me to pull down your shutter tonight,' he said.</p>

  <p>'That meat-safe affair?' asked Miss Loveapple. 'I can't sleep without
  air.'</p>

  <p>'Then change your room.'</p>

  <p>'No, it's all right. I am going to put a chair in front of the window and
  fix up a contraption with my cow-bells. If any one tries to get in, the noise
  will wake me up.'</p>

  <p>Not a bad idea. All the same, I wish I were not going to-night.'</p>

  <p>'It will seem funny without you,' remarked Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>She felt guilty at her own feelings of relief, because she welcomed the
  prospect of returning to her isolationist policy and her freedom from
  emotional entanglement. Although she had promised not to reveal Viva's
  identity prematurely, she could not resist introducing the subject. At the
  moment, she was feeling grateful to Viva because of the expert manner in
  which she had whisked away the principal exhibits when the other guests had
  invaded her disgracefully untidy bedroom the night before.</p>

  <p>'Is it true you don't like business-women?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'I don't know one,' Buckingham replied.</p>

  <p>'You will...You will. How would you like to marry one who was young and
  attractive and who had worked up a marvellous business by her own brains and
  energy?'</p>

  <p>'I'd cherish her. I'd keep her books. There should be no secrets between
  us. Is it you?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Then why ask me?'</p>

  <p>'Because you never know your luck.'</p>

  <p>They walked for some distance in silence which was broken by
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>'What's your name?' he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>The question gave Miss Loveapple a little shock of surprise. She had grown
  so used to thinking of herself in terms of a title, that when she told him
  she almost questioned her identity.</p>

  <p>An outraged expression flitted across his face.</p>

  <p>'No,' he protested. <i>'No.</i> I shall call you "Flora."'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; MATCH-POINT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Dean did not see his sister that day until they met for
  lunch. He noticed at once the familiar signs of insomnia in her drawn
  expression and sunken eyes.</p>

  <p>'Haven't you slept well?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied. 'There was rather too much excitement in the
  night.'</p>

  <p>Although she felt tired and irritable, she tried to give her brother an
  unbiased account of the disturbance.</p>

  <p>'You must not conclude that I am casting any reflection on the girl's
  character,' she told him. 'She seems quite nice. Unfortunately she appears to
  attract unwelcome attention. Those bare legs might have something to do with
  it&mdash;not that there is any harm in wearing shorts.'</p>

  <p>A smile flitted over the Dean's austere face.</p>

  <p>'I felt self-conscious about my legs when I first wore gaiters,' he said.
  'Now I forget I'm not wearing trousers. She's probably so used to shorts that
  she never gives them a second thought...All the same, I don't like the
  prospect of broken nights for you.'</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' agreed his sister. 'Don't worry. I intend to move in the
  matter.'</p>

  <p>The lady's interview with the hotel proprietor took place after lunch.
  While they were talking, Miss Loveapple clattered down the shallow stairs
  into the lounge.</p>

  <p>The proprietor advanced to meet her.</p>

  <p>'I am distressed to hear that you were disturbed last night,' he told her.
  'Such a thing has never happened before in my hotel. I cannot understand it
  at all.'</p>

  <p>'Neither can I,' agreed Miss Loveapple in an astringent voice. 'Such a
  thing has never happened to me before in <i>any</i> hotel.'</p>

  <p>The Dean's sister considered it time to intervene.</p>

  <p>'It must have been very unpleasant,' she said. 'The important thing is to
  avoid a repetition of the annoyance. My brother wonders whether you would
  feel more comfortable in his room. It's at the back and has no veranda. If
  you care for the idea, he will change with you.'</p>

  <p>For a moment Miss Loveapple was inclined to turn down the proposal. The
  change involved the loss of her view of the mountains. As she hesitated,
  however, she realised the benefit of being able to sleep without listening
  for a possible intruder.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' she said. 'I'll be glad to accept your brother's offer.
  Frankly, he'll get the best of the bargain, for my room has an enchanting
  view. But it is more important to sleep soundly.'</p>

  <p>'That is my opinion also,' agreed the Dean's sister dryly.</p>

  <p>As both the Dean and Miss Loveapple possessed the minimum of luggage, the
  change was soon made. Amor knew nothing about it, as he took refuge in the
  pension during the day, lest Miss Loveapple should recognise him and suspect
  that he had followed her. He had completed his professional purchases and lay
  on his bed, smoking until the coast was clear for him to slip across to the
  hotel and operate on the bedroom locks.</p>

  <p>In her capacity of intelligence officer, his wife sat at the window, with
  her field-glasses focused upon the hotel. Suddenly she gave a thin
  scream.</p>

  <p>'I'm sure she's changed her room,' she declared. 'I've not seen her once.
  And now there's a sky pilot standing at her bedroom window. Smoking a pipe,
  too.'</p>

  <p>'So what?' asked Amor, after an interlude of appropriate profanity.</p>

  <p>'You're through at the hotel,' said his wife promptly. 'Nothing doing
  there. She'll bolt her door, and you can't risk being pinched outside in the
  corridor...But she'll have them on her. You don't leave ice lying about on
  your dressing-table for the chambermaid to wipe away with the powder.'</p>

  <p>'In a bag around her neck,' agreed Amor. 'Or special pockets in her pants.
  We'll have to trail her when she's alone.'</p>

  <p>Such a prospect seemed very remote to Miss Loveapple. It was a broken day
  for her because of Buckingham's departure for England. She did not like to go
  out on a solitary ramble&mdash;were such a course possible&mdash;since his
  time was so short. When she returned to the hotel for lunch, there had been a
  letter which made her feel still more unsettled. It was from Elsie, and as
  she read it it brought her own return very near.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Captain Brown has stopped his murdering [wrote the maid].
  He says now he wants the garden to be full of flowers for you. I've warned
  him I want to fill every vase in the house, to welcome you, and if you find
  anything wrong, you will know what to do.</p><br>

  <p>Miss Loveapple grinned at the implication of herself calling upon Captain
  Brown with a horsewhip. Then her eyes grew wistful when she read the
  postscript.</p>

  <p>'The hot-water bottles are in your bed. And there are two more outside.
  You can guess their names. They send their love.'</p>

  <p>'It's time I went home,' decided Miss Loveapple. 'This has not been a
  lucky holiday, but I'm not beaten. I'll come again, before the other
  people.'</p>

  <p>While her thoughts were winging back to England, Elsie was re-reading her
  last letter to a bored audience of Scottie and David. There was a note of
  finality about it which seemed to bring her mistress nearer home.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">This will be my last letter [wrote Miss Loveapple]. 'And
  don't write to me after today. My address will be uncertain, for I may go on
  to Paris. But expect me for tea at the Pond House on the fourteenth of
  September. I do wish I was coming there direct. Remember to have Scottie and
  David there to meet me. I want a real welcome home. I know I can depend on
  you.</p><br>

  <p>As Elsie smiled, she heard the opening of the front door and the sound of
  firm footsteps. For a moment she thought that Miss Loveapple was in the
  house. But while she waited for the laughter&mdash;which was music to her
  melancholy mind&mdash;Miss Agatha Pitt's voice announced her arrival.</p>

  <p>'She's set on us all being here,' she thought. 'If I go up to London
  she'll rumble me. I'll say nothing to Miss Pitt, after all.'</p>

  <p>Things were not shaping well for the delayed murder of Mr Henry Watkins.
  One lady had decided to cancel her visit to Number Nineteen Madeira Crescent,
  while the other had arranged to bring her own gentleman-friend, to provide
  any personal attentions...</p>

  <p>Buckingham was leaving Switzerland by the night express from Interlaken,
  so that tea was his last meal at Grindelwald. When it was over, he asked Miss
  Loveapple to accompany him on a quick farewell visit to the Gorge. They
  rushed all the way until they had rounded the last bend, where they leaned
  over the rail and watched the torrent boiling over the rocks.</p>

  <p>'I've been collecting addresses,' said Buckingham, as he opened his
  wallet. 'In spite of my latent savagery, people have asked me to call. I'm
  going to pay my visits now.'</p>

  <p>He flicked a handful of visiting-cards into the river.</p>

  <p>'So sorry you are not at home,' he remarked.</p>

  <p>'Are the Furses down there?' asked Miss Loveapple, pointing to a whirlpool
  of foam.</p>

  <p>'Both,' he replied. 'I've only kept one card. Viva's. I mean to look her
  up.'</p>

  <p>'Do you like her?'</p>

  <p>'Of course. She has qualities which appeal to most men. I've never seen
  her rattled or bad-tempered...Talking of tempers, I'm coming to Highfield.
  May I?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Do.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple spoke warmly. She wanted Buckingham to see her in her own
  special surroundings where she would be reinforced against any assault of
  sentiment. The Pond House represented her kingdom which she did not intend to
  share with a consort.</p>

  <p>'You'll be able to meet Scottie and David,' she added.</p>

  <p><i>'David?'</i></p>

  <p>'My blue Persian cat. What are you laughing at?'</p>

  <p>'<i>My</i> name is "David,"' he explained.</p>

  <p>'Not "Richard"?'</p>

  <p>'I was christened "Richard." But my mother was a copy-cat. It wasn't too
  amusing for her to be a poor relation, for she wanted rather a lot, like her
  precious son. But it didn't cost anything to copy Royalty, so I was renamed
  after the Prince of Wales.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was disproportionately dismayed by the news, because a
  gipsy had once traced a 'D' in her palm and told her that it was the initial
  of the man she would marry.</p>

  <p>'You'll miss your train,' she said shortly.</p>

  <p>They ran all the way through the cool, moist wood veined by wandering
  water, but after they had crossed the bridge of the Lutschine they slackened
  their pace to walk up the hill.</p>

  <p>'I've finished at the hotel,' said Buckingham. 'My bags are being brought
  to the station. The mayor and corporation are waiting there to give me an
  official sendoff...I shan't say "Good-bye" to you, because I shall soon be
  meeting your train at Victoria. That reminds me. I have an idea.'</p>

  <p>'What?' asked Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'This: We won't have supper on the way to the house. Let's buy stuff and
  eat it at nineteen Madeira. We might do a spot of cooking.
  Sausage-and-mashed.'</p>

  <p>'No,' interrupted Miss Loveapple. 'Kippers.'</p>

  <p>'So long as we keep it refined, anything. I'll make coffee.'</p>

  <p>'You dare touch my stove&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Then I'll wash up.'</p>

  <p>'And mess up my sink?'</p>

  <p>'That's the idea. I want to see you in action&mdash;Flora.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Miss Loveapple realised how easily the glorious scramble of their
  picnic meal might be a foretaste of married life. The prospect appealed to
  her because she was one of the pillow-fight honeymoon sisterhood, to whom a
  love-affair was both a joyous and boisterous affair.</p>

  <p>She loved a scrap where she could give as good as she got. Imagination
  pictured a wild chase up and down stairs, and through the house, in which she
  would be both huntress and quarry. She remembered how the earlier
  'David'&mdash;after capture&mdash;had swung her off her feet and kissed
  her.</p>

  <p>This was the first step&mdash;leading to the inevitable second&mdash;when
  Buckingham would menace her onion-bed.</p>

  <p>Instantly she took fright and dashed for refuge in the blind corner of her
  mind. Although she was naturally truthful, she was stampeded into telling a
  lie.</p>

  <p>If it were true that Miss Loveapple was protected by a beneficent
  force&mdash;which was involved in a match to save her from a malignant
  fate&mdash;it would appear that her luck had won. She was guarded from attack
  on her person by her removal to an impregnable bedroom; she was guarded from
  attack on her life by a powerful personal guard.</p>

  <p>Driven on by fatal impulse, she proved herself her own enemy.</p>

  <p>'I'd love it,' she said, her eyes pleading against the tyranny of her
  will. 'But I've altered my plans. I'm washing out the night in London, so as
  to have an extra day here. I shall be at Victoria on September the
  <i>fourteenth.'</i></p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the station, where an impressive muster from
  the hotel was waiting to say 'Good-bye' to Buckingham. It was not until his
  train was pulling out that he spoke to Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'<i>Au revoir</i>,' he shouted, 'till September the fourteenth.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; A CUP OF COFFEE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE left Grindelwald on September the
  eleventh&mdash;a day earlier than she had intended. Mrs Furse was the
  indirect cause of her change of plan. After Buckingham left, there were no
  unattached men in the hotel, with the exception of the Dean. When she
  established the fact of an invalid wife at home in the Deanery, Mrs Furse
  decided to go elsewhere.</p>

  <p>'We may try the Dalmatian coast,' she explained. 'I've had my rest, so I
  mustn't be selfish. Olivia wants some social life again. In any case, we
  shall go to a fashionable place.'</p>

  <p>'I hope she will meet some nice man,' remarked Miss Loveapple to Viva
  afterwards. 'She's the neglected sort of girl that makes the best wife.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was always benevolent on the subject of marriage for any
  one except herself, but Viva did not share her enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'Not a hope,' she said. 'She's definitely without glamour. I should begin
  her face by extracting her front teeth.'</p>

  <p>'But they're perfect,' gasped Miss Loveapple. 'Even if they protrude a
  bit, they give character to her face.'</p>

  <p>'But they suggest something to eat with.'</p>

  <p>'What else are teeth for?'</p>

  <p>'To smile with. The flash of white provides the contrast with the
  lip-stick. They are also necessary to underpin the structure of the
  face.'</p>

  <p>By this time Miss Loveapple had discovered that Viva had no sense of
  humour. When she remembered Buckingham's complimentary estimate of her
  qualities, she wondered whether this were another attraction, in his
  opinion.</p>

  <p>After the Furses left Grindelwald, Viva favoured Miss Loveapple with her
  exclusive company. Her objective was Lady Pontypool's future patronage, which
  she regarded as invaluable publicity.</p>

  <p>'If you secure the queen bee, the swarm will follow,' she explained to
  Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'The swarm are all working bees,' objected Miss Loveapple. 'There's no
  time to do up faces in the honey-racket. Besides, I've told you already I
  have no pull with Lady Pontypool.'</p>

  <p>'You are too modest. Never mind. Just think it over.'</p>

  <p>Instead of following her advice, Miss Loveapple became infected with some
  of the prevailing diplomacy as she tried to persuade Viva to join the
  Furses.</p>

  <p>'You are too young and attractive to be wasted in this wilderness,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately Viva proved adamant to suggestion.</p>

  <p>'My doctor ordered three weeks' perfect quiet and rest for my nerves,' she
  explained. 'So I shall stay three weeks and not one day less...Whenever I'm
  trying out a new facial treatment, I always follow the formula faithfully,
  even if it's against my own judgment.'</p>

  <p>'Did you say "nerves?"' asked Miss Loveapple, staring sceptically at the
  complete composure of Viva's face which reminded her vaguely of an ornamented
  shell.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Result of overwork. One of my girls left to set up for herself. I
  actually used to lie awake and wonder whether she would take away any of my
  clients. <i>That</i> will tell you the state of my nerves.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you combine another interest with your work?'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to. I intend to get married.'</p>

  <p>Viva's policy was such a subtle compound of ruthlessness and tact that
  Miss Loveapple was no match for it. Too kind-hearted to be brutally blunt,
  she gave up her attempts to go on solitary rambles.</p>

  <p>'Next time,' she whispered to the mountains.</p>

  <p>Had she eluded her escort, however, she would have had other company. The
  Amors were on her trail, waiting for an opportunity to try those
  shock-tactics for which they were temperamentally unsuited. Whenever a
  solitary feminine figure emerged from the hotel, they followed her, like
  malignant shadows, up to the inevitable minute when she was joined by another
  woman.</p>

  <p>Such persistent guardianship seemed to them another proof that the maid
  wore a more expensive outfit than was apparent from the evidence of her
  surface value. On the night before her departure from Grindelwald, they had
  further confirmation of their theory.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple left the hotel after dinner, to buy greengages for her
  train journey. She walked to her favourite fruit stall at one end of the
  village which was very poorly lit. The street was crowded by a noisy company
  of students who sang and shouted on their return from a camping holiday.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple concluded that one of them must have been very careless
  with his stick, for as she watched them, suddenly she felt her ankle
  hooked.</p>

  <p>Instead of grasping the counter of the fruit stall, she fell flat on her
  face. The instinct which would cause most people to try to save themselves
  was overpowered by a stronger motive&mdash;to hold on to her jewel-case. It
  contained her tickets, her money and her precious passport.</p>

  <p>In the darkness and confusion, she did not notice the polite little man
  with a felt hat pulled over his eyes, who helped her to her feet. Nor did she
  remark the fact that the woman beside him held a case which could have been
  substituted for her own, had it fallen to the pavement.</p>

  <p>Even her sturdy optimism was not proof against this latest misfortune. She
  cut her knee and bruised her arms when she fell. Her last pair of stockings
  was laddered, while the seam of her black satin skirt&mdash;which formed half
  her evening outfit&mdash;had been split open again.</p>

  <p>She felt so bewildered by the accident as she limped back to the hotel,
  that she slumped down in the first chair in the veranda and spoke
  impulsively.</p>

  <p>'Do you believe in luck?'</p>

  <p>She put the question to the nearest person before she recognised the
  intellectual features of the Dean.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm sorry,' she said. 'I suppose I shouldn't ask <i>you</i>
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' The Dean smiled. 'Luck is always an interesting subject for
  discussion. All the same, I do not believe in it. My personal belief is that
  everything is ordained by God.'</p>

  <p>'But big events are influenced by trifles,' persisted Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'I do not agree. It is our own character which determines Destiny. You may
  consider you have proof that some important event hinged upon an
  insignificant incident. In reality, it was your own reaction to this trifle
  which developed the situation.'</p>

  <p>As the Dean spoke, Miss Loveapple remembered the unworthy desire to assert
  her own importance on the Kleine Scheidegg which led to her recognition of
  Lady Pontypool, and consequently to Viva's monopoly of her company.</p>

  <p>'I believe you are right,' she said slowly. 'There was that night when the
  man came into my bedroom. I crashed completely. If I had a better-balanced
  character, I should not have lost my veranda and my view of the
  mountains.'</p>

  <p>'That misfortune can be remedied,' the Dean reminded her. 'To-night, if
  you like.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no, I didn't mean that. I always speak without thinking. It was
  frightfully kind of you to suggest it. Besides, it's not worth making any
  change now.'</p>

  <p>As the Dean smoked in silence, she returned to her argument.</p>

  <p>'All the same, I believe in luck, because I've been exceptionally lucky.
  Things have always turned out well for me. All except this holiday. I looked
  forward to it&mdash;but it has been a disappointment. Everything has gone
  wrong from beginning to end.'</p>

  <p>'You forget this,' said the Dean. 'You have not yet reached the end. You
  are judging prematurely. For all you know now, every accident may have been a
  piece of good fortune in disguise. And when I say "fortune," I do not mean
  "luck."'</p>

  <p>'I hope you're right.' Miss Loveapple's voice was doubtful. 'I am going
  home tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>'Then I will wish you "God-speed."'</p>

  <p>Fortified by a blessing and cheered by sunlight, Miss Loveapple left
  Grindelwald in the best of spirits. She could endure to gaze at the
  snow-streaked crest of the Eiger without a pang because she looked forward to
  a reunion in happier circumstances. From the moment she entered the little
  wooden train she felt she was on her way back to her beloved Pond House.</p>

  <p>She allowed herself plenty of time to wander in Interlaken. Strolling down
  the Höheweg, she glanced occasionally from the glittering white peak of the
  Jungfrau to the brilliant flowers in every hotel garden. This lapse of homage
  was due to the revival of her horticulturist spirit. When she reached the
  smart modern shops, she lingered before watches and lace until she was
  satiatied with window display.</p>

  <p>Presently she crossed the bridge where the blue-green water still boiled
  and raced after its recent passage over a weir, and walked beside the river
  back to Interlaken-Ost. Seated at a table under the yellowed chestnuts before
  the Hotel du Lac, she ordered a cup of coffee, to pass the time. When she
  opened her cigarette-case, a polite little man suddenly sprang forward with a
  lighted match.</p>

  <p>'Allow me,' he said.</p>

  <p>As she looked up to thank him, she noticed his companion and recognised
  her by her costume of filmy black, trimmed with monkey-fur. The people at the
  next table were the incongruous couple she had noticed before&mdash;once at
  Victoria Station and later on the Jungfraujoch train.</p>

  <p>The Amors were keyed-up for desperate action and had arranged a plan of
  campaign to cover several contingencies. Their last hope of scooping in a
  fortune depended on their daring and skill to take advantage of the journey
  back to England. Moistening her painted lips nervously, Mrs Amor smiled at
  Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'Pardon,' she said. 'Haven't we met before? I mean, on the mountain?'</p>

  <p>'Which mountain?' asked Miss Loveapple vaguely.</p>

  <p>'The one with the funny name. It's funny how you keep meeting the same
  people out here until you feel you know them. If they're English, I mean,
  same as you and us. But you could sit by them at the Corner House for years
  and never speak.'</p>

  <p>As Miss Loveapple remained unresponsive, Amor began to apologise.</p>

  <p>'You must excuse her, lady. She's homesick. She wants to get back to her
  baby.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Amor recognised the remark as a false step, in view of the fact that
  personal maids should be without encumbrances. A recollection of Lady
  Pontypool's charities&mdash;which included animal welfare&mdash;inspired her
  own effort.</p>

  <p>'That's his sauce,' she complained. <i>'My</i> baby is a little cat. My,
  she knows every word I say. I'd sooner starve than let her go hungry. It
  beats me how people can be cruel to dumb animals.'</p>

  <p>'They are not people,' declared Miss Loveapple. 'They are
  degenerates.'</p>

  <p>'That's right,' agreed Mrs Amor.</p>

  <p>At one time the Amors had put on a music hall show in which she claimed to
  have eyes which could penetrate any receptacle and proclaim its contents. The
  act did not last long because, in spite of her magnetic gaze, her brain was
  too clumsy to interpret her husband's code of signals.</p>

  <p>Now as she gazed at Miss Loveapple's case, she did not need super-vision
  to know that the jewels were inside. The maid had discarded her
  shorts&mdash;with their secret pockets&mdash;and wore the tight black satin
  suit which was so obviously a perquisite.</p>

  <p>Although she claimed to possess the superior acumen, it was her husband's
  instinct which bridged the gulf between their victim and themselves. As she
  tried to improve their acquaintance with a remark about the weather, Amor
  spoke in a dejected voice.</p>

  <p>'Dry up, Mimi. Can't you see the lady doesn't want to be disturbed.'</p>

  <p>The humility of the remark touched Miss Loveapple's generous heart.
  Moreover, apart from the need of that solitude which was vital to communion
  with the mountains, her nature was generous. Since she had returned to the
  sophistication of Interlaken, she had begun to feel lonely. She reminded
  herself that this pathetic little couple were fellow-travellers&mdash;both to
  England and Eternity&mdash;and that it was merely human to force an interest
  in their holiday.</p>

  <p>After she asked them their impressions of Switzerland, Amor spoke
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Might I take the liberty of asking you to have cawfee with me and the
  missus? Plenty of time before the train.'</p>

  <p>She thanked him and explained that she had already given an order. While
  she was speaking, the waiter brought a steaming cup to the table. The Amors
  exchanged glances as she waited for it to cool, and then Mrs Amor opened a
  film weekly paper.</p>

  <p>'Have you seen this picture?' she asked.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple began to study the photographs of a crook drama.</p>

  <p>'I like good crime,' she remarked. 'But it's got to be convincing. I don't
  believe, of course, but I like to be carried away.'</p>

  <p>'Did you see <i>The Thin Man</i>?' asked Mrs Amor. 'It was chronic the way
  they carried on. Not like real married life.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple suppressed a guilty smile at the thought of Buckingham and
  herself in similar rôles.</p>

  <p>'I agree with you,' she said. 'Most films are unreal stuff. Abductions and
  doped drinks. Absurd.'</p>

  <p>She held the paper to her eyes, so that it screened her view of the table.
  As though awaiting a cue, Amor's hand flashed out and dropped a white pellet
  in her cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>'Such things don't happen in real life,' continued Miss Loveapple. 'Not
  even abroad.'</p>

  <p>The couple exchanged a glance. They knew that the train would be almost
  empty at first, so that if they could arrange to share a carriage with Miss
  Loveapple, the jewels were as good as theirs. Very soon she would be sleeping
  like a log.</p>

  <p>The whistle of an engine in the distance made Amor glance at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>'That's the Paris train,' he said. 'Don't forget to drink your cawfee,
  miss.'</p>

  <p>The warning made Miss Loveapple flurry. She stretched for the sugar-basin
  in such haste that she swept over her cup with the cuff of her
  travelling-coat, while the coffee flooded the table and dripped down on the
  gravel.</p>

  <p>'Bee bad luck,' muttered Amor savagely.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; 'WHEN SHE SLEEPS'</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE was astonished by her compatriots' indignant
  sympathy. They appeared as concerned as though the accident were their own
  affair. She declined the little man's urgent offer to rush back to the hotel
  for fresh coffee, but, because of it, she was unable to feel annoyed when
  they entered her compartment. The train was sparsely filled at the Ost
  Station, but even at this stage she could not expect to get a carriage to
  herself.</p>

  <p>With the generic selfishness of travellers, they arranged their wraps and
  luggage over the seats, to create the impression of a full muster when they
  stopped at Interlaken. Their strategy proved a success, for no one had joined
  them when they steamed out of the station.</p>

  <p>Amor pulled his hat down over his eyes and drew his blind.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to play shut-eye,' he explained.</p>

  <p>'Me too,' said his wife. 'We shan't be able to lay down, if we fill up,
  later on.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple did not follow their example, for she wished to enjoy the
  scenery while the daylight lasted. She congratulated herself on the
  possession of sleeping-partners, when she contrasted their silence with the
  distracting conversation on the outward journey. Her face was unruffled as
  the glassy blue water of Lake Thun below as she gazed out at the vivid green
  landscape.</p>

  <p>The carriage was very warm but she did not like to lower the window,
  because she felt certain that her unobtrusive companions did not share her
  enthusiasm for fresh air. As she looked at their stunted forms and narrow
  chests she felt sorry for them.</p>

  <p>'Like cellar plants,' she thought.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to avoid contrast with her own vigorous growth and
  development or not to feel grateful to the air and sunshine on which she had
  thriven. There was no personal vanity in her heart as she acknowledged
  herself a perfect specimen&mdash;in horticultural terms.</p>

  <p>'A bit pot-bound, perhaps,' she admitted.</p>

  <p>Clutching her jewel-case, she opened the door cautiously and slipped into
  the corridor to smoke. Instantly the lids of two pairs of dark eyes split
  apart as the sleepers awoke. They noticed how she held the case wedged
  against her side by the pressure of her underarm while she was lighting her
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>As though she sensed their interest, at that moment she was thinking of
  their sympathy and kindness.</p>

  <p>'I'll be decent to them,' she resolved. 'It's their holiday too, poor
  little weeds.'</p>

  <p>When she returned to the carriage, they were apparently dozing, so she
  decided to take advantage of the present lull to be comfortable. Winding a
  scarf around her hair, she leaned back in a corner and watched the slow slide
  of fields, starred with the pallid mauve crocuses of autumn.</p>

  <p>Gradually the green glide stretched out into a continuous line as the
  pastures blurred together. Soothed by the warmth and motion, she began to
  grow drowsy. She felt as though she were slipping into a hot tropical sea as
  the grass continued to heave past her drooping lids. The steady chug of the
  engine kept time with the hypnotic breathing inside the carriage...</p>

  <p>Suddenly her head fell forward with a jerk and she awoke with a violent
  start. Her heart was leaping from a momentary delusion. In that fractional
  pause between oblivion and consciousness, she could have sworn she saw a dark
  distorted face&mdash;like a disembodied shape of evil&mdash;hovering near her
  own.</p>

  <p>But no one was there except her travelling companions, who slumbered in
  their corners. Shivering from the vividness of her fancy, she tried to follow
  their example. It was wasted effort, for whenever she reached the edge of the
  pleasant drowsy boundary-line and was on the point of fading out, an
  alarm-bell seemed to ring inside her brain, jangling her back to reality.</p>

  <p>Somehow she received the impression of an intrusion&mdash;as though there
  were enemies in the carriage. They advanced towards her, only to shoot away
  whenever she stirred. Once she shrank back and clutched her case tighter as
  though fingers were touching it; but when she looked around her she could
  detect no cause of alarm.</p>

  <p>Once again she stood by the open window of the corridor and let the cool
  air flow against her face.</p>

  <p>She was not deceived in her recognition of an invasion, for an evil
  thought is a real thing. The hideous idea came to birth in the murky depths
  of the woman's eyes and darted thence, like a deadly viper, into the man's
  brain.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fiasco of their professional act, there was actual
  telepathy between the Amors. They often understood each other without the aid
  of words. It was plain to them that Lady Pontypool's maid guarded her
  treasure almost as though her fingers had grown into the leather of the case.
  Worse, she slept like a cat, while there would be no further opportunity to
  drug her.</p>

  <p>As they could not risk exposure or another fumbled job, she must be
  silenced effectively. The time for qualms was now past. On the first likely
  opportunity when the train stopped on the way to Paris they would jump off
  with their lot. When the guard made his round later he would not remark a
  motionless lady covered with a rug, because most of the passengers would be
  also asleep.</p>

  <p>Amor leaned forward and whispered to his wife.</p>

  <p>'After Pontarlier.'</p>

  <p>'That's right,' she nodded. 'When she sleeps.'</p>

  <p>They looked up guiltily when Miss Loveapple returned to the carriage and
  began to clear their belongings off the seat, as though they were encroaching
  on her space. To remove their inferiority complex, she smiled at them with
  genuine warmth.</p>

  <p>'Is this the first time you've been abroad?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'First time we've been in the country,' replied Mrs Amor. 'I've been in
  Berlin, Buda, Paree and all the big towns. I'm in the Profession, you know. I
  help an illusionist. Hand him his properties, you know, and take the
  attention of the public off his tricks. I wear a saucy costume&mdash;trunks
  and a topper.'</p>

  <p>'Keep it clean,' urged her husband. 'Tell the lady you wear shoes...Might
  I ask if you have a job, miss?'</p>

  <p>'Don't be a fool,' broke in Mrs Amor. 'Can't you see the lady is
  private?'</p>

  <p>Not wishing to erect a barrier between her travelling-companions and
  herself, Miss Loveapple compromised with a technically true answer.</p>

  <p>'Of course I have a job,' she replied as she thought of her strenuous work
  in both house and garden.'</p>

  <p>'A superior job, miss?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you could call it that. I'm my own mistress.' To change the subject,
  she added, 'Perhaps we shall meet in Paris? I'm stopping there for one
  night.'</p>

  <p>'What hotel, miss?' asked Amor.</p>

  <p>He shook his head when she mentioned the name.</p>

  <p>'Too classy for us. I hope we shan't meet, miss. If we do it will mean
  we've struck unlucky in a deal. But they say, "Try, try again."'</p>

  <p>His wife broke into a thin scream of laughter which she silenced abruptly.
  Glancing at her, Miss Loveapple felt a momentary chill, for the high note
  synchronised with a spasm of mirth which flickered across the woman's face.
  The overhead light exaggerated the length of the crooked nose and revived a
  nightmare recollection of a distorted mask pressed almost against her
  own.</p>

  <p>The impression passed as Amor spoke.</p>

  <p>'We're coming into Bern. Coo, there won't be half a mob. A regular
  jam-session&mdash;and I don't mean music.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple looked out at the spread of roofs and the illuminations of
  a city as the train slackened speed. When it ran into the station she gave a
  cry of annoyance at the sight of the crowded platform.</p>

  <p>'Half the population seems coming up to Paris,' she said. 'If we stand at
  the door and windows, we may bluff them that the carriage is full.'</p>

  <p>At first it seemed as though their strategy were favoured by fortune. Miss
  Loveapple was always a striking figure, and she formed an impressive barrier
  as she guarded the entrance to their compartment. The string of passengers
  filed along the corridor and made no attempt to enter until, when all danger
  seemed past, a French family stormed the carriage.</p>

  <p>There were six of them&mdash;representing three generations&mdash;and all
  were restless and excited. The adults talked and laughed shrilly while the
  children devoured food and romped about the limited space. They spilt crumbs
  and banana skins on the floor, wiped their fingers on Miss Loveapple's skirt
  and trod on her toes until she felt nearly distracted.</p>

  <p>To her, they were merely noisy intruders, for her eyes were blinded to
  half a dozen guardian angels. As she endured the uproar, she wondered whether
  a tip to the guard might secure more comfortable quarters. It seemed hardly
  worth while to make a change before Pontarlier&mdash;where they had to go
  through the Customs&mdash;so she struggled out into the corridor, only to be
  joined by the Amors.</p>

  <p>'There's an empty first in the next coach,' whispered the little man.
  'Shall we park there?'</p>

  <p>Catching his signal, his wife shook her head.</p>

  <p>'Catch me. They'll make us pay.'</p>

  <p>'Aw, be a sport. We're British, aren't we? We shouldn't stand for being
  treated worse than dead sardines.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Amor still refused to venture, while Miss Loveapple's expression grew
  thoughtful. She prided herself on mental courage and common sense which
  assured her that it was ridiculous to be overcrowded while there were empty
  carriages on the train.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to chance it,' she said. 'Won't you come?'</p>

  <p>'Mustn't leave the missus,' declared the little man.</p>

  <p>He helped her to collect her belongings, but he did not accompany her to
  the next coach. From that time onward, he did not want to be seen in Miss
  Loveapple's company. Her society was tainted with a dangerous element to the
  last person with whom she came in contact.</p>

  <p>They returned to their crowded carriage and were affable to the French
  family, while Miss Loveapple congratulated herself on the undisturbed comfort
  of her first-class carriage. She decided to try and strike a bargain with the
  guard or ticket-collector, so that she might be allowed to remain there for
  the rest of the journey. The only official who noticed her, displayed an
  encouraging apathy regarding her trespass; he merely shrugged his shoulders
  and passed the door without making any protest.</p>

  <p>Presently lights began to flash through the darkness and the train stopped
  at Pontarlier. Carrying her luggage, Miss Loveapple joined in the stampede to
  the Douane. She resolved to return boldly to the first-class
  carriage&mdash;hers by right of possession&mdash;and settle down for the
  night directly she had got through the tiresome formality of the Customs.</p>

  <p>She arrived at an opportune moment, for the officials were piling up the
  evidence against an individual who had informed them he had nothing to
  declare. Although she had to wait for attention, her own suitcase was
  unopened and decorated with a chalk scrawl.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to promise a successful run up to Paris. She bought
  rolls and chocolate at the buffet and returned cheerfully to the train. It
  seemed to have grown longer during her absence, but she attributed this
  impression to her fancy. Locating her section by the French children's yellow
  berets at a carriage window, she climbed up the steep steps and reached the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>She was immediately conscious of change. The first thing she noticed was
  her travel-coat, which she had left behind her in the first-class carriage,
  to stake out her claim. It was now crumpled up to a rough ball and bundled on
  the rack.</p>

  <p>Stretching out her arm, she was about to pull it down, when she realised a
  more ominous circumstance. There was no longer any connecting passage leading
  to the next coach.</p>

  <p>As she stared at the blank wooden partition which barred her way, the
  Frenchman explained.</p>

  <p>'That portion has been shunted off and we've joined up with some full
  coaches. We shall be very crowded. No matter. It will be warmer to
  sleep.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple tried to accept his philosophy during a night of intense
  discomfort. The carriage swayed and the engine shrieked as the train plunged
  through the darkness. There were irritating stops at various stations, where
  they picked up more passengers. Although Amor prowled the length of the
  train, he could find no empty compartment where a lady could be stunned in
  privacy.</p>

  <p>Presently, in spite of the close air and the pressure of bodies, Miss
  Loveapple fell asleep. She awoke to the light of dawn&mdash;grey and dirty as
  a rain-splashed pane. All around her was noise and movement as people
  prepared to leave the train. Paris lay at the end of the rails&mdash;only a
  short distance away.</p>

  <p>It was September the twelfth.</p>

  <p>Across the Channel, in London, Clarence Club greeted the date with savage
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow.' He sucked in his breath. 'I'll ring up
  Amy&mdash;<i>to-morrow</i>.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; A DOSE OF SALTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT has been stated that the success of Clarence Club's plan
  to incriminate Henry Watkins depended on the collaboration of his
  lady-friend&mdash;Amy. Although this introduction of the human element robbed
  it of claim to be a fool-proof proposition, he had no fear for his personal
  safety. Amy was not only ensnared by his glamour of and proven loyalty, but
  she was counting the days also to their reunion.</p>

  <p>The fact that she had not changed her name to 'Aimée' was some indication
  of her quality. Born in the country, of respectable parents, she was a
  barmaid in the village inn when a commercial gentleman had suggested certain
  experiments with the cash-register. As she was lax and lazy, besides being
  very susceptible to masculine influence, she kept up the game until the
  shortage was discovered.</p>

  <p>To give her her due, she was not grasping. She got nothing out of the
  affair herself, except an amorous adventure and the loss of her liberty for
  three months.</p>

  <p>After she came out of prison, she drifted into a career to which she was
  temperamentally attracted; but although she was caught up in a vicious
  circle, she kept out of the reach of the law and merely acted as social
  hostess to her protectors. In this capacity, there was not much difference
  between her and the average housekeeper. Her habits were slovenly, but she
  was sober, honest and loyal to whichever member of the criminal class was
  paying her rent.</p>

  <p>As Club was almost a professional Romeo, he felt sure of his power over
  Amy. She responded with her usual pliant amiability, when he told her that
  she must cease to visit him in prison, while he resigned his claim on her in
  favour of Henry Watkins. Although&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;Henry was a
  very plain man, she made the best of a bad bargain and regarded it chiefly as
  a basis for future partnership with Club.</p>

  <p>In order to preserve the illusion of a complete break between Amy and
  himself, Club would not meet her after his release from prison, but
  ostentatiously entertained other charmers. His private conversations with her
  were held over the telephone, when he gave her the instructions which were to
  control Watkins' alibi.</p>

  <p>Radiant at the prospect of a speedy reunion, she thrilled at the sound of
  his whisper, when he called her up on the morning of the thirteenth of
  September.</p>

  <p>'Do your stuff to-night,' he said. 'You've got to keep Watkins with you.
  Remember, the vital hours are from seven to nine, but hold him all night, in
  case the doctor won't swear to the time.'</p>

  <p>'Seven to nine,' repeated Amy. She added, 'He'll want to go to the
  dogs.'</p>

  <p>'Then dope his drink. <i>You</i> know.'</p>

  <p>Amy knew. She was an expert mixer of drinks, and had often slipped a dose
  into the glass of an inconvenient visitor.</p>

  <p>'All right,' she agreed. 'When will I see you again?'</p>

  <p>'Not till it's safe. Keep away from me until I send for you. I'll post you
  that bit of jewellery to-night.'</p>

  <p>Will there be&mdash;blood on it?'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;only a hair. Don't monkey with <i>that.'</i></p>

  <p>Amy's expression was thoughtful after she had rung off. She had no
  imagination, but she retained her common sense, as well as her health. It had
  taken a long time for a certain fact to soak in, but that morning she
  realised that she was about to become an accessory to murder.</p>

  <p>'I don't like it,' she said to her Peke.</p>

  <p>But since her lord and master had spoken&mdash;and it was her fate to be
  passive&mdash;she went to the kitchenette where she kept her tins and
  bottles, in order to check the essential ingredients.</p>

  <p>It was late afternoon when Henry Watkins returned to the murky comfort of
  the untidy flat.</p>

  <p>'Had a good day, duck?' she asked, as she unlaced his shoes.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>'Did a demonstration in a house in Eaton Square. Rotten window-catches and
  two good Constables.'</p>

  <p>'Good?' Her tone was sceptical. 'Policemen?'</p>

  <p>'No, nothing nasty. Just pictures. Old Masters. Maybe I'll be seeing them
  again.'</p>

  <p>While he rested his feet, Amy took stock of him, together with the
  situation. His hair was thin, his legs bandy, his eyes sharp; but he had
  certain domestic virtues. He would get up in the morning and make her an
  early cup of tea. He was kind to the Peke. His money was regular, instead of
  the shortage or surfeit which she had experienced with Club.</p>

  <p>Life with Watkins included the privilege of marriage, combined with the
  advantage of the run-out. On the other hand, Club gave her romance, while his
  mesmeric whisper still rang in her ears.</p>

  <p>'Dope him.'</p>

  <p>Stifling a sigh, she perched herself on Watkins' knee and rubbed her cheek
  against his, with manufactured charm.</p>

  <p>'My, you're pimply,' she said. 'Your face is like seedcake. Let me mix you
  a dose of salts, or I'll have to give up kissing you.'</p>

  <p>Even while he protested, she had slipped away to the dark kitchenette. He
  heard the clink of a spoon against glass, followed by the hiss of a
  soda-water syphon, before she returned with a frothing glass.</p>

  <p>'Only a quick one,' she explained. 'Drink it up, duck. You won't taste the
  salts.'</p>

  <p>There was a glint in her eyes when he swallowed the last drop&mdash;a
  gleam which was half-fearful, half-triumphant. Whatever the outcome of her
  action, it was now too late to undo it.</p>

  <p>As the time crawled on without any results from her dose, she began to
  grow anxious. Watkins showed no signs of drowsiness, but, on the contrary,
  became strung-up and irritable. The heat of the flat and the blare of hot
  music from the wireless seemed to worry him subconsciously, as much as the
  flies which were collecting for a last rally.</p>

  <p>He kept wanting to go out to tea, and it was only with difficulty that she
  succeeded in side-tracking him from his intention. Presently the Peke created
  a welcome diversion by being sick, when Watkins proved, as usual, kind and
  helpful; but when he got up from stooping over the floor, she noticed that
  his forehead was beaded.</p>

  <p>'You're sweating,' she said. 'Is anything the matter, duck?'</p>

  <p>'Belly-pains,' he replied. 'Just a touch of wind...Here, I can't stick
  around. Fetch my shoes. We'll have another drink and go to the dogs.'</p>

  <p>In a panic, she looked at her watch. The time was five minutes past
  seven&mdash;and Club had told her that the vital hours were from seven to
  nine. Moistening her lips nervously, she hurried into the kitchenette and
  switched on the light.</p>

  <p>The next second she screamed like a steam-siren.</p>

  <p>'It's not my fault,' she yelled. 'It's that girl again. She's moved the
  tins. I mixed it in the dark. It's an accident.'</p>

  <p>His face green from a sudden internal twinge, Watkins staggered across to
  the kitchenette.</p>

  <p>'What have you given me?' he gulped.</p>

  <p>For answer, she held out a tin which bore the picture of a dying rodent on
  its label.</p>

  <p>'It was the wrong tin,' she sobbed. 'Lay down, duck. Don't you worry.
  We'll put you right again.'</p>

  <p>As the terrified man collapsed into a chair, he heard her shrieking to the
  landlady from the landing:</p>

  <p>'Help! Fetch the doctor. Watkins has taken rat-poison.'</p>

  <p>Soon the room was invaded by a rush of excited lodgers. The air was
  vibrant with voices&mdash;shouting into the telephone, giving orders and
  calling out advice against the blare of the wireless, which no one remembered
  to switch off. Mustard and water was mixed, only to be spilt on the carpet by
  the struggles of the panic-stricken Watkins.</p>

  <p>When the confusion was at its height, the doctor arrived, complete with
  stomach pump. From that point onwards, the temperature of the audience scaled
  a fever-peak of baffled curiosity. Banished from the flat, the lodgers
  crowded on the landing, trying to reconstruct the painful and intimate drama
  which was being enacted on the other side of the door...</p>

  <p>Towards half-past eight, the doctor expressed himself satisfied and left
  the house. Directly he had gone, Amy turned to the landlady and pressed a
  pound note into her hand.</p>

  <p>'I've got to slip out,' she whispered. 'Sit by him and don't leave him for
  one minute until the proper nurse comes. He might collapse, so be ready with
  the brandy.'</p>

  <p>Satisfied with her arrangements for the patient's safety, Amy put on her
  hat, powdered her nose and descended in the lift to the street level.
  Directly she was outside the block of flats, she hailed a taxi.</p>

  <p>'Scotland Yard,' she said to the driver.</p>

  <p>When she arrived at the building and stated that her business was both
  private and important, she had not to wait long before receiving official
  attention. This preferential treatment was due to the fact of her known
  friendship with certain gentlemen who were of interest to the police.</p>

  <p>As she sat in the office, there was nothing of the traditional gangster's
  moll in her appearance. She did not chew gum, smoke a cigarette, or pull up a
  tight skirt, to cross her legs. Although her hair was ginger, she was minus
  the snap which is supposed to be characteristic of a Rufus. Her red lips were
  soft and sloppy&mdash;her eyes a milky-blue. She wore a well-cut black suit,
  a white organdie blouse and clean white gloves.</p>

  <p>As he looked at her, the inspector was vaguely reminded of a rabbit he had
  kept in boyhood.</p>

  <p>'Well, Amy,' he asked, 'who's your boyfriend? Club?'</p>

  <p><i>'Was,'</i> she replied indifferently. 'It's Henry Watkins.'</p>

  <p>'So I've heard. How's the vacuum-cleaner trade?'</p>

  <p>'No luck.'</p>

  <p>'Too bad. Better warn Henry it's time he makes a sale. He mustn't neglect
  business while he's getting familiar with the lay of people's houses.'</p>

  <p>'You've nothing on him.'</p>

  <p>'Not yet...Well, what have you come about?'</p>

  <p>Amy began to smooth a wrinkle in her glove, to prove her nonchalance.</p>

  <p>'I've come to alibi Henry Watkins,' she said defiantly. 'I could do it
  myself, only I couldn't trust the police to believe the truth, along of me
  being his friend. But at seven o'clock this evening he was took sick in the
  flat. A doctor's been working on him with a stomach-pump and he's turned
  inside-out.'</p>

  <p>'Poison?' asked the inspector.</p>

  <p>'I told him it was rat-poison. And I showed him an empty tin, just to fool
  him. But all I really gave him was a dose. Something harmless, to grip him a
  bit and make him vomit.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'To cover the times, of course. Now I've got witnesses to prove he didn't
  do the murder.'</p>

  <p>The inspector's face grew suddenly keen.</p>

  <p>'What murder?' he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>'The one Club is going to frame Henry for,' replied Amy vaguely. 'He's
  doing it himself. Some woman. She's coming back to an empty house and he's
  waiting there for her. But I've got my witnesses to prove&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What is the address of the house?'</p>

  <p>Flustered by the Inspector's tone, she stared at him, while her eyes
  blurred with stupid distress.</p>

  <p>'Law, I forgot all about <i>her</i>,' she faltered. 'All the time I kept
  thinking about how to alibi Henry&mdash;'</p>

  <p><i>'What's</i> the address?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. Oh, give me a minute. You've drove it from my head.'</p>

  <p>As he looked at the soft quivering face, the Inspector managed to control
  his impatience. He knew that any attempt to jog Amy's memory would only add
  to her mental confusion. Lighting a cigarette, he placed it between her lips
  and then patted her paternally on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Take your time,' he said. 'You'll remember it.'</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes fixed on the clock as it ticked away those precious
  minutes in which the life of a woman might be saved. His fingers drummed on
  the table and then closed over the telephone, in readiness. He missed the
  actual moment when Amy's face was lit by a gleam of intelligence.</p>

  <p>'Nineteen Madeira Crescent, North-West,' she declared triumphantly. 'I
  knew it would come back&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What time is the woman expected?' interrupted the Inspector.</p>

  <p>'Well, her train got in at Victoria soon after seven. Club said she'd come
  by Tube and be there eight at the latest. I've covered the times and I've
  witnesses&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The Inspector did not hear her. As he began to speak into the telephone,
  he glanced again at the clock.</p>

  <p>The time was ten minutes past nine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; THE UNDERWORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'THESE are the sewers of Paris,' reflected Miss Loveapple.
  'I'm seeing life.'</p>

  <p>She did not refer to the Public Utility Works of 'The Seventh Heaven,' but
  to the localised corruption which was on view to tourists for so many francs
  per head. In the company of some pleasant strangers, she was being escorted
  through the underworld of Paris.</p>

  <p>This trip was different from the excursions organised by reputable
  agencies, to view the night life of the city. It was a specialised
  entertainment, calculated to create horror and repulsion, in order to
  fascinate through force of contrast. Here, well-fed prosperous bunnies could
  look through protective panes of glass and view the writhing of hungry
  serpents.</p>

  <p>Although Miss Loveapple did her utmost to coerce her emotions, she could
  not succeed in forcing a thrill. She would not admit to defeat, but she was
  thoroughly tired out. The fact was that she had been too gluttonous in her
  attempt to swallow the French capital in a one-day mouthful. The soles of her
  feet ached, her head throbbed, her stomach was surprised&mdash;but she was
  chiefly conscious of disappointment and disgust.</p>

  <p>When she arrived at Paris, at six in the morning, instead of driving to
  her hotel and getting some sleep, she had hung about the railway station,
  while waiting for the shops to open. As the waiting-rooms were being cleaned,
  there was not even a bench upon which she could rest. She had to pace the
  platforms and watch the arrival of early trains, with the unusual spectacle
  of workers perched on outside seats.</p>

  <p>At the time, she was excited by her surroundings and exultant in her sense
  of liberty. It was happiness to be alone again, for she had shaken off the
  Amors. Before her stretched a whole day, and she determined not to waste a
  minute of it, but to absorb the Gallic atmosphere in educative spirit.</p>

  <p>She had breakfast at a café, where she sat on the pavement and watched a
  sleepy dribble of Parisian life, instead of the advertised gay whirl. There
  was a spiteful wind which blew dust in her eyes as well as draping her ankles
  with dirty papers, but she would not go inside. This was an essential feature
  of French life&mdash;to eat in the open and tilt her hat over one eye as she
  smoked a cigarette.</p>

  <p>Before long, she attracted some attention which she did not reciprocate.
  Literally shoving her pallid little admirer away, she went to Cook's office
  and booked as many escorted excursions as she could cram into her limited
  time.</p>

  <p>The rest of the day was spent in an orgy of sight-seeing. She craned her
  neck to stare at the outside of famous buildings&mdash;meekly followed the
  flock through picture galleries and museums&mdash;bought picture postcards
  with selective economy and wrote down the names of all the celebrated persons
  mentioned by the guide. Thanks to her clear brain, she was able to escape the
  average tourist's jumble of impressions, but when she got back to her hotel,
  she felt that she had triumphantly sustained a severe mental and physical
  strain.</p>

  <p>She was pleasant to the Amors when she met them after dinner, in the dingy
  restaurant of the hotel.</p>

  <p>'Law, you do look tired,' said Mrs Amor.</p>

  <p>'But you should see the others,' Miss Loveapple told her. 'Ask me what
  I've <i>not</i> seen.'</p>

  <p>'Did you go with a party?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I'd rather wander alone but so many Frenchmen want to teach me
  English.'</p>

  <p>The couple exchanged glances. 'Would you think it a liberty if we asked
  you to come to the Folies Bergères with us tonight?' asked the little man
  humbly. 'That's a show you mustn't miss, if you can stand some sauce.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple hesitated.</p>

  <p>'I'd like to be able to say afterwards I had gone,' she confessed, 'but
  I've got to see the night life of Paris. Cook is doing a tour. I can't
  telescope the two.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you can,' Amor told her. 'We'll show you the <i>real</i> thing
  later.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple did not enjoy the performance at the Folies. The atmosphere
  was very heated and the show annoyed her. She grew so bored by the posturing
  of a profile nude that she longed for the artiste to drop her scarf, just to
  break the monotony.</p>

  <p>'I always get tired of looking at the same view,' she complained.</p>

  <p>When they were outside the theatre again, she determined to call it a day.
  She shook her head when Amor pointed to a scarlet motor-coach which bore the
  alluring notice <i>'Route de l'Enfers</i>.'</p>

  <p>'I'm going back to bed,' she explained.</p>

  <p>'You won't sleep,' he said. 'The noise is chronic. The traffic will be
  stopped when we get back.'</p>

  <p>She considered his argument, for although overtired, she was too excited
  to feel sleepy. As she was not leaving Paris until the afternoon, she could
  stay in bed all the next morning, instead of buying a hat. Her ambition to
  patronise Lady Pontypool's milliner had faded from too many frank reflections
  of her black satin suit in Parisian shop windows.</p>

  <p>While she hesitated, the conductor of the Infernal Tour joined them. Like
  the degenerate-looking driver, he wore a smart white linen coat and cap, with
  bands of black patent leather. He captivated Miss Loveapple by the engaging
  wickedness of his smile. Speaking English as perfectly as he swore in the
  argot of the gutter, he suggested a gallant little dare-devil who had
  graduated in a superior social circle.</p>

  <p>'Would you like to be a good sport?' he asked her. 'We can't start this
  tour without a minimum number, or we'll run it at a loss. There are some
  charming people so desperately keen to visit the damned. Of course, I can see
  <i>you</i> are not attracted by vice.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she agreed, 'I hardly suggest consumption and white camellias, do
  I?'</p>

  <p>He looked at her with genuine admiration.</p>

  <p>'You make me think of English roses and Worthington ale,' he said. 'Please
  be British and do any old thing once.'</p>

  <p>By this time, the other prospective clients had joined the group. They
  made an attractive Anglo-American foursome&mdash;a young English married
  couple and a pretty American girl with her lover. The women wore
  evening-dress under short fur coats and the men were in dinner-suits.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple liked them at sight. They were such a refreshing change
  after the uncongenial Amors that she did not like to disappoint them. While
  she was chatting to them and exchanging impressions, some other tourists
  entered the coach, so that she need not have stayed; but by then, she was
  beginning to enjoy the adventure.</p>

  <p>At first she felt the stirring of romance as they drove through a darkness
  pricked with the crocus-gold of gas-lamps. Her thoughts turned confusedly to
  the Orient&mdash;to lilies and lanterns and strange sweet music. She
  remembered Buckingham and wished he were beside her as she noticed that the
  American girl and her lover were holding hands.</p>

  <p>As the tour continued, however, her mood was clouded by the chill of
  disillusionment, so that she could not join in her companions' light-hearted
  enjoyment. The presentment of evil seemed stunted and stale in its externals.
  She grew jaded by the heat, the standing and the poisonous air of the various
  dens they visited. They spent a long time in a specially fetid booth where
  they were entertained by some curious singing and dancing&mdash;a good part,
  or rather, a bad part of which was lost upon them.</p>

  <p>They supped at a Chinese restaurant on chop-suey, sharks' fins, boodle,
  chicken with pineapple and tea flavoured with chrysanthemum buds. While they
  were eating, the conductor came to their table, to make an announcement.</p>

  <p>'We are next going to present our crowning thrill. We will show you an
  opium-den. In the raw...but first, I must give you a warning. The ladies must
  not lose sight of the gentlemen, or let themselves be decoyed away by any one
  for a single second.'</p>

  <p>'Why?' asked the American girl.</p>

  <p>The merest flicker of a wink passed between the conductor and one of the
  young men.</p>

  <p>'Shall I?' asked the conductor. 'Or will it scare them too much.'</p>

  <p>'No, give them the works,' decided the youth. 'They ought to be on guard.
  Tell them.'</p>

  <p>'All right,' grinned the conductor. 'Some years ago, a young Englishman
  and his sister did this tour&mdash;but not with <i>us</i>. They saw the
  shows, fed and all the rest. Just like you. In fact, it might have been
  to-night. Then, when they were in the opium-den, the chap was called to the
  door to see a bloke who had some fresh thrill to suggest. He turned back, to
  find the room empty. His sister had gone.'</p>

  <p>'Where?' asked Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'The Devil alone knows. The boy went off his rocker. He rushed from room
  to room. He found nobody. Then he called in the police. They raided the
  place. But they never found her...In time, the police were hypnotised to
  believe that the English girl was a legend. For she was never seen
  again.'</p>

  <p>'What became of her?'</p>

  <p>'Better not think.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>'Then you're for it, conductor,' she said. 'I'm going to hook on to you
  and not let you out of my sight for a minute. My eyes will be fixed on the
  white coat. You see, I've got to be back in England to-morrow, because I have
  some important business.'</p>

  <p>The Amors exchanged crafty glances. They guessed the nature of that
  mission which was to restore the jewels to Lady Pontypool.</p>

  <p>Every one started to the opium-den in a mood of riotous scepticism; but
  when they peeped around the corner into a low and tenebrous room, they were
  not prepared for the horror which awaited them. A few flickering lights dimly
  revealed filthy couches on which was dumped bundles of rubbish, as though
  awaiting the dust-cart. One with mottled pale-blue skin drawn tightly over a
  bony face, looked like a corpse long overdue for burial; the features of
  another were shapeless and yellowed, like a wax doll which had been left in
  the sun.</p>

  <p>The air was laden with compound odours which united in one overpowering
  reek; the steam-laundry of stewing humanity; food&mdash;dead food:
  sanitation&mdash;lack of sanitation: mice, gas, bhang, betel-nut and the
  sickly-sweet stench of opium.</p>

  <p>The only sound was a continuous broken hiss, like the last bubbles of air
  from leaking lungs.</p>

  <p>The silence was broken by the American girl.</p>

  <p>'Let's go.' Her voice held a hysterical note. 'I hate this place.'</p>

  <p>As they all followed her outside, the young men began to laugh.</p>

  <p>'Betty is scared,' said the Englishman. 'We'd better come clean...Listen,
  you folks. Everything you've seen to-night is fake, from beginning to end.
  It's all got up specially for tourists. That yarn about the lost girl is twin
  to the Spanish Prisoner tale. All fake.'</p>

  <p>He clapped the conductor on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Tell them what you told me,' he urged. 'Tell them they've been had.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; SCREEN MAGIC</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE conductor took no notice of the appeal beyond a cynical
  grin. Beckoning his patrons to surround him, he made a little speech.</p>

  <p>'Ladies and gentlemen, the tour is now finished. I hope you will profit by
  its moral and that I have not failed you as your courier to the Underworld. I
  hope also that we shall not meet again&mdash;in Hell. Ladies and gentlemen,
  thank you, very much.'</p>

  <p>As his audience began to straggle towards the motor-coach, he called them
  back.</p>

  <p>'One minute, ladies and gentlemen. Although I am no longer in your
  employment, I am still at your service. Perhaps you would like to visit a
  warehouse and see some genuine Chinese embroideries? Under the hat, they are
  smuggled goods, so you will not be stung.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was longing to return to her hotel, but the rest of the
  tourists swallowed the bait. The girls were both radiant at the chance of a
  bargain and tried to make her share their enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'We shall get marvellous kimonos and house-coats for the half of nothing,'
  they told her.</p>

  <p>'There's duty,' snapped Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'No,' interrupted the conductor, 'the Chink will put down on your bill
  only half of what you pay. He'll mark it damaged goods.'</p>

  <p>'Then he can't be a genuine Chinese,' said Miss Loveapple. 'They're an
  honest race.'</p>

  <p>He stared at her before he turned to the rest of the party.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid,' he said, 'that I shall have to ask you to walk, as the
  streets are too narrow for the <i>char-à-banc</i>. But it is not far. After
  me, ladies and gentlemen.'</p>

  <p>Snapping his fingers behind him, as a signal for them to follow, he led
  them through a tangle of mean streets and a network of small courts. The
  party walked after him blindly, except Miss Loveapple who memorised the
  turnings with instinctive caution.</p>

  <p>'There's going to be no lost girl story told about me,' she decided.</p>

  <p>Just behind her, the Anglo-American foursome was discussing the
  opium-den.</p>

  <p>'Anyhow, the bloke himself told us it was all fake,' said the Englishman.
  'And that was my own opinion. You could only see two faces distinctly. The
  blue and the yellow. They could easily be made up to look like that, in the
  dim light. Remember, we were only invited to peep. We were not allowed to go
  in and investigate.'</p>

  <p>'Who'd want to?' asked the American girl. 'One whiff of that poison would
  shrivel a skunk. Of course, it was a fake. All the other figures looked like
  corpses, because they were <i>not</i> alive. They were dummies.'</p>

  <p>'I agree the whole show could be faked quite easily,' argued her lover.
  'At the same time, it would be cheaper and simpler to give us a glimpse of
  the genuine thing. I am sure it was that. The conductor was lying because he
  didn't want the women scared.'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple listened vaguely to the argument which was interrupted by
  their arrival at the warehouse. After going through a door in an otherwise
  blank wall, they scaled a ladder-like stair, to reach a vast upper room. It
  was low ceilinged and of irregular shape, but it was impossible to visualise
  it clearly or to see more than a few yards in any direction, owing to the
  profusion of screens, curtains and tall cabinets which blocked the view.</p>

  <p>The dim lighting came from grape-blue paper lanterns, decorated with green
  devices, which imparted an illusion of moonlight. There was no ventilation
  and the air was heavy with the scent of aromatic odours, perfumes and woods.
  Everywhere was a wealth of beautiful merchandise; red lacquer furniture,
  rolls of choice carpets and snowy matting, silken hangings and embroideries,
  porcelain tea-cups, bulbs in whose shrivelled hearts lay the promise of rare
  lilies.</p>

  <p>Owing to the congestion, the party was immediately split up into couples
  and lonesome prowlers in search of a bargain, so that Miss Loveapple failed
  to notice that they were not a complete muster. After a rapid whisper to his
  wife, Amor had stayed behind to talk to the degenerate-looking driver of the
  motor-coach.</p>

  <p>Bored and footsore, Miss Loveapple prayed for the moment of release, when
  she could return to her hotel. That wish was continually frustrated by the
  enthusiasm and hesitation of the others. They were like butterflies who could
  not settle on any flower, because there were too many blooms. A corpulent
  Chinese who owned the warehouse waited for them to make a choice with
  Oriental calm, while his assistants seemed to enter into the spirit of the
  game.</p>

  <p>They gave the impression of being one man only, unless they chanced to
  appear together, as they drifted behind screens, always to emerge with fresh
  goods, as though they were incarnations of the spirit of temptation.</p>

  <p>Wherever she looked, Miss Loveapple saw a reproduction of the dragon,
  either in silk, or tinsel or paint. As she gazed, she was haunted by a
  memory. The sense of familiarity became so strong that she began to wonder
  whether she had actually been a porcelain princess in some former life.</p>

  <p>She burst out laughing when she realised the explanation. The place really
  reminded her of the stage of some Hippodrome or Coliseum, where a so-called
  Oriental conjurer would flit behind a screen for one second and then reappear
  in the form of a dancing girl, whirling around a bowl of fire.</p>

  <p>It was magic&mdash;but magic worked through the agency of a screen.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple searched for the conductor and fixed her eyes on his white
  coat.</p>

  <p>'If I lose sight of him for a moment,' she told herself, 'he'll turn into
  a rabbit.'</p>

  <p>As the time crawled slowly away, she began to near the limit of her
  endurance. While she had refused to let herself be affected by the organised
  thrill of the opium-den, the cumulative impression of the tour weighed
  heavily on her mind. Flashes from mean court and alley returned to crowd her
  memory; the stiff lace of a paralysed beggar, like a slab of dead
  fish&mdash;the blotched features and bloated body of a brandy-soaked
  woman&mdash;a tipsy girl in her teens, of the educated classes, dancing in a
  café.</p>

  <p>These horrors were real and disconnected from any fraudulent agency which
  catered for the entertainment of tourists. Because fatigue had reduced her to
  a supersensitive condition, she was filled with sudden loathing of her
  surroundings. She felt that she had left all cleanliness and decency behind
  her and passed the confines of Law and Civilization to the blackness of
  chaos, brooded over by the lunatic brain of a drugged devil.</p>

  <p>She shook off her mood when the pretty American spoke to her.</p>

  <p>'Wish we could get back to the hotel. I want a shower. A bug's biting
  me.'</p>

  <p>The words made Miss Loveapple realise that she, too, had picked up a
  flea.</p>

  <p>'Same here,' she said, rubbing her leg. 'Can't you speed up your
  friends?'</p>

  <p>But the young English couple were pricing lumps of amber and refused to be
  rushed. In her impatience Miss Loveapple began to assert her
  independence.</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to be kept hanging about here, to suit other people's
  whims. I shall go back to my hotel. If I can't pick up a taxi, I shall
  walk.'</p>

  <p>'Can you find your way?' asked the American girl.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, I've a good bump of locality.'</p>

  <p>'I do admire your British calm. You rarely hear of an Englishwoman losing
  her head.'</p>

  <p>Secretly conscious of her racial superiority over the rest of the world,
  Miss Loveapple responded with the usual deceptive nonchalance.</p>

  <p>'Oh, we manage to muddle through somehow.'</p>

  <p>While she was talking, she kept her eyes fixed automatically on the
  conductor's white coat. He yawned as he glanced at his watch before speaking
  to her.</p>

  <p>'Nothing here to tempt you, madam?'</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied. 'I don't believe in something for nothing. There's
  bound to be a catch. This Chinese has to make the commissions he must pay
  away.'</p>

  <p>'You mean I get a rake-off. Well, I don't work overtime for my
  health.'</p>

  <p>At that moment Mrs Amor, who had dogged Miss Loveapple persistently,
  attracted her attention to a panel of stiff blue silk, embroidered with
  lotus-flowers.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't this make a lovely centre for a bridal bedspread?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple held it against the light and shook her head.</p>

  <p>'It's rotten,' she said. 'Can't you see the pin-holes?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps it's an antique...Oh, where's our conductor?'</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple realised that she had forgotten her resolution not to lose
  sight of her guide. She darted around the screen and picked up the white coat
  as it disappeared behind a curtain.</p>

  <p>'Where is he gone?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'He's by the door,' replied Mrs Amor. 'Look, he's beckoning us to follow.
  You can't blame the poor bloke. He has to do this every night, bath night and
  all.'</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the conductor snapped his fingers behind him in the familiar
  signal, before he went out of the warehouse.</p>

  <p>'Where are the others?' asked Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>'I expect they've gone on. He's waiting for us.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, Miss Loveapple heard a girl's laughter.</p>

  <p>'No, they're still here,' she said. 'I must tell them we are going. Wait
  here for me.'</p>

  <p>She hurried in the direction of the voices, slipping behind screens and
  hanging until she reached an alcove where a girl and a man were bargaining
  with a Chinese salesman.</p>

  <p>'Hurry up,' she called. 'We're going&mdash;Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you
  belonged to my party.'</p>

  <p>As she looked at the surprised faces of the strangers, she had her first
  prick of discomfort. It seemed hopeless to continue her search for the
  Anglo-American foursome in such a confusing place, especially as the chances
  were that they had gone on ahead. It was true that she had talked about
  returning alone to her hotel; but since she had memorised the turnings of the
  network of streets, her mind had grown weary and she was no longer
  confident.</p>

  <p>'I must follow the conductor,' she decided.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of him when she left the warehouse and stared down the
  length of a dark malodorous passage. It was dimly-lit, at its farthest end by
  a naked gas jet, from which flared a long bluish flame. The boards were
  rotten, the skirting nibbled by mice and the scaling plaster walls covered
  with scribbles.</p>

  <p>She gave a shudder of repulsion.</p>

  <p>'What a filthy hole,' she thought. 'Why doesn't the wretched man wait for
  me?'</p>

  <p>As Mrs Amor had also disappeared, she began to run in an effort to catch
  her up. When she reached the bend and saw only a second passage which twisted
  out of sight, she felt another pang of definite uneasiness. In spite of her
  common sense, she had the sensation of being lured away from the safety of
  her base. At that moment, she was stranded, for she had lost both the
  conductor and the other tourists.</p>

  <p>As she paused, through the rusty grating of a small window set high in the
  wall, she caught a glimpse of a gibbous moon. Her superstition made her fear
  and distrust it vaguely, whenever it was on the wane. It seemed a
  warning&mdash;a sign to her of coming disaster.</p>

  <p>She tried to justify the American girl's compliment and keep her head as
  she weighed the possibility of some ambushed disaster. Even if she accepted
  the official explanation of faked thrills and a 'lost girl' fable, she had to
  face the fact that an unprotected woman who explored the Underworld of any
  large city, ran a grave risk. She had often read of crimes committed for the
  sake of only a few pounds.</p>

  <p>'I'll go back to the warehouse,' she decided. 'There must be other decent
  people there who'll have to get back to their hotels.'</p>

  <p>She was turning to retrace her steps, when she heard a faint sound in the
  distance. Someone was calling her by name.</p>

  <p>In the circumstances, the summons was nearly as welcome as an Archangel's
  trumpet. Shouting to announce her coming, she dashed down the passage and
  rounded the bend. She was just in time to see Mrs Amor's head pop up from the
  well of a dilapidated stairhead.</p>

  <p>'Come on,' she cried. 'We're all waiting for you. You're holding us
  up.'</p>

  <p>As she clattered&mdash;like an overgrown schoolgirl&mdash;down the rotten
  treads, Miss Loveapple could see the conductor's white coat glimmering
  through the gloom below. His back was turned towards her, but when she
  reached the bottom, he swung round, with both arms upraised, as though he
  were driving off at golf.</p>

  <p>Something damp and heavy&mdash;suggestive of a pot-pudding tied in a
  cloth&mdash;struck her head and she sat down heavily, her back propped
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>Before she lost consciousness, she had a moment of overpowering repulsion
  and shock. Instead of the engaging grin of the little conductor, she saw
  Amor's dark face, stretched and contorted by concentrated effort.</p>

  <p>In that second of revelation, she felt as though a drain had suddenly
  burst before her, to liberate a sewer-rat...</p>

  <p>Amor snatched up the jewel-case and thrust it into his wife's hands.</p>

  <p>'Quick,' he commanded. 'Jump a taxi. I'll join you at the Gare du
  Nord.'</p>

  <p>She had barely unbarred the door when he called her back.</p>

  <p>'Hell, she's not half a lump. Help me lay her outside&mdash;curse
  her.'</p>

  <p>While they were dragging and bumping Miss Loveapple over the cobbles, she
  was being missed in the warehouse. As the conductor finished checking his
  invoices with the spurious Chinese proprietor, he remembered her thrust about
  the native honesty of the celestial race.</p>

  <p>'Wish he was a Chink, instead of this twister,' he thought.</p>

  <p>When he returned to his patrons, he looked around for her.</p>

  <p>'Where is the English rose?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Gone back to her hotel,' replied the pretty American.</p>

  <p>'Without saying "good-bye" to me. But <i>she'll</i> come to no harm...That
  lady almost makes me wish for family life...Too late now. Too many women. I'm
  damned eternally.'</p>

  <p>With a change of tone, he added, 'I'm not responsible for you any longer.
  But if you come with me now, I will take you to the cab-rank.'</p>

  <p>A little later, he entered his own respectable little flat, hugged his
  tiny wife and rubbed the baby's gums.</p>

  <p>'Tooth through yet?' he asked. 'By gosh, I'd a champion lot of chumps
  to-night. Only one didn't fall. <i>She</i> was jannock. Colour like a rose
  and big without a lump of fat...Nay, don't clout me. I didn't pinch her.'</p>

  <p>With an apron tied over his smart suit, the happy little man sat down to
  supper with his loving wife...</p>

  <p>More or less unconscious, Miss Loveapple lay on the filthy flags of a
  small courtyard. At intervals she awoke to glimpses of a nightmare
  environment. A jagged line of bottles stuck out on a high wall. A protracted
  bottle-party and a cat-fight&mdash;both conducted in an unfamiliar argot. A
  creeping cold, an unclean smell&mdash;the throb of her broken head.</p>

  <p>The first pallid gleam of dawn was lighting the sky, when she opened her
  eyes to welcome a rescue party in the shape of a sweeper in a blouse and a
  policeman. They were talking together in low, excited voices.</p>

  <p>As the official greeted her return to consciousness with a torrent of
  questions, she proved her common sense in a crisis. Her own French was that
  of the ordinary well-educated girl, but lacked the idiom of the native.
  Moreover the situation was confused while her head was unequal to a
  strain.</p>

  <p>As she sat up, everything began to whirl around her; but before she
  fainted she managed to utter, clearly and firmly, two magic words.</p>

  <p>'Thomas Cook.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; THE VIGIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the thirteenth of September, Elsie awoke early and nipped
  the old leaf off the calendar. Although she had been looking forward to this
  date when Miss Loveapple was due to return to England, her happiness was
  diluted with indecision. Throughout a broken night, whenever she thought of
  her mistress who was in the Calais train she kept reviewing her problem.</p>

  <p>To go&mdash;or not to go to London.</p>

  <p>Her own choice was to stay at home and get the house ready, at her
  leisure; but whenever she resolved to take the easier course, her conscience
  accused her of cowardice. She shrank from the idea of Miss Loveapple
  returning to a dark and empty house, with no one to answer the bell and send
  strange men away.</p>

  <p>Goaded by her recollection of the gloomy crescent at nightfall, she spent
  the morning in a frantic rush of work, to which her strength was unequal.
  Although she knew that she had achieved only what Miss Loveapple called 'A
  lick and a promise,' she was shaking from exhaustion, when she tore off her
  overall and hurried across the Green.</p>

  <p>The Pitts lived in a large Georgian house, on the outskirts of the
  village. The eldest daughter, Agatha, was mowing the front lawn, when she
  heard the squeak of the gate and looked up to see Elsie. Contrary to her
  usual high standard of neatness, the girl looked both dirty and untidy, as
  though she were taking advantage of the absence of authority.</p>

  <p>'Would you like to invite two young gentlemen to stay with you to-night?'
  asked Elsie gaily.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately her effort to strike a light note annoyed Miss Pitt.</p>

  <p>'Are you proposing to do <i>me</i> a favour?' she asked stiffly. 'If so, I
  am in no need of one, thank you.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no, miss,' Elsie assured her quickly. 'Only Madam comes home to-night
  and I think I ought to be at the London house to see her in and do for her,
  if you would kindly look after our boys.'</p>

  <p>Agatha Pitt did not stop to consider the merits of the case. All she knew
  was that the proposed guests would cause trouble with her own inhospitable
  dogs, while she did not care sufficiently for Elsie to sacrifice her own
  peace.</p>

  <p>'Does Miss Loveapple expect you?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No, but I think it would be a nice surprise.'</p>

  <p>'Well, Elsie, you'll have to surprise her at the Pond House. I can't make
  myself responsible for Scottie and David. I have an engagement.'</p>

  <p>Without another glance at the girl, Agatha Pitt began to make the grass
  fly again in a furious green hail, in proof that the palaver was ended.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Elsie was actually relieved by the decision which
  relieved her from worry. She walked slowly back to the Pond House, for she
  had time in hand, now that the matter had passed beyond her control. There
  was no one besides Miss Pitt to whom she could entrust the pets and she could
  not dream of leaving them alone, during the night.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, her mind had not the fixity of the Pole Star. Before an
  hour had passed, she was reduced again to a state of mental flux. The
  reminder that she must be ready to catch the three-fifty-five train, in case
  of need, drove her on to sweep and polish at high pressure. When she broke
  off in order to change, she poked out her tongue at the telephone.</p>

  <p>'Ring your blinking bell off,' she told it. 'I'm not coming down wet, to
  answer you...'</p>

  <p>While Elsie was splashing in her bath, Miss Loveapple was having her
  second interview with the Paris representative of Thomas Cook. This took
  place in her bedroom, as the hotel had no public rooms. In any case, she had
  to remain in bed, by order of the doctor. He had strapped up her forehead and
  prescribed rest for the shock of her injury, while he made a tactful
  reference to the fact that she had sat down with considerable force.</p>

  <p>'No, you must not get up. You will be sitting in the train to-morrow. It
  is better for you to lie on your side, all the time, to relieve all
  pressure.'</p>

  <p>It was mental torture to Miss Loveapple to submit to passive treatment.
  Her rebellion was inflamed after the visit of Cook's agent, because he
  brought with him her lost passport and railway tickets.</p>

  <p>'The case was found in an alley, where they had thrown it,' he told her.
  'They'd cleaned it out, but they left these. Probably they were nervous of
  using the tickets, in case their serial numbers should be known. Lucky they
  left your passport. That might cause trouble if it got into undesirable
  hands. But they appear to be only small pikers.'</p>

  <p>'You should have seen them,' agreed Miss Loveapple. 'But now that I have
  my passport, there's nothing to stop me making a dash to get back to London,
  to-night. I have an important deal to put through tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>She hammered the point, but Cook's agent finally dissuaded her with the
  argument that she would not be in a fit state to transact business. After he
  had made all the arrangements for her return on the fourteenth, she asked him
  to put through two telephone calls to England.</p>

  <p>The first was to her bank to guarantee her financial status and arrange
  the cover for her loan; the second, to Mr Lemon, the house-agent, to ask him
  to deputise for her in the interview with Major Brand.</p>

  <p>'Get in your message, before he starts talking,' she advised.</p>

  <p>She grinned as she lay and listened while the telephone barked and
  spluttered until Cook's agent ruthlessly rang off.</p>

  <p>'Just telling me of his first visit to Paris,' he said. 'I think that
  covers everything. <i>Au revoir</i>.'</p>

  <p>As he was going out of the room, Miss Loveapple called him back.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if you would put through another call,' she asked. 'It's to my
  home. I'll take it myself.'</p>

  <p>She had made the decision after losing a stiff fight with her economical
  instinct. At first, she was relieved when the operator reported that there
  was no reply from the Pond House.</p>

  <p>'My maid must be out,' she said. 'Please wait. I think I should let her
  know. Will you get me another number?'</p>

  <p>Successful in his second attempt, the agent handed her the receiver and
  hurried from the bedroom, before she could think of another request.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple glanced around the conventional dingy hotel apartment, as
  she heard Mrs Bosanquet's gruff voice at the other end of the line. At that
  moment, she realized the modern miracle which had linked her up with an
  English Rectory, which could only be reached by mounting two long flights of
  steps.</p>

  <p>'Miss Loveapple speaking from Paris,' she said importantly. 'I've just
  rung up Elsie, but got no reply. Would you tell her that I'm cutting out
  London and returning direct to the Pond House, to-morrow afternoon, usual
  train. The fourteenth. Got that? Sorry to bother you...Oh, you might tell her
  I'm stopping in Paris to&mdash;to buy a hat.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Bosanquet repeated her message in curt business style. 'It's my
  Mother's Meeting,' she added reproachfully.</p>

  <p>'How should I know that, since you refuse to acknowledge Scottie and
  David?'</p>

  <p>Mrs Bosanquet was chuckling as she, in her turn, rang up the Pond House,
  from a confused feeling that there must be more virtue in a local call. When
  she got no answer, she swore briefly, but fervently. Then she glanced at her
  watch and decided that there was time for a personal delivery of the message
  before her Meeting.</p>

  <p>Since she was strictly conscientious&mdash;and her hat was on already, she
  set out immediately for the Pond House and reached it, just as Elsie finished
  her toilet. She was wearing the pale banana-yellow frock she had bought for
  the Fête and she stood before the glass, approving her reflection, when she
  heard the prolonged peal of the front door-bell.</p>

  <p>Although her instinct was to answer it, she shrank back guiltily from the
  window and stood, listening. Mrs Bosanquet rang again and knocked loudly. She
  knew that the house could not be empty, because she could hear Scottie
  barking in the hall. As she turned away, however, she looked up at the
  windows and was puzzled to notice that all were fastened, in spite of the
  fine afternoon.</p>

  <p>Peeping between the folds of the curtains, Elsie watched her until she was
  out of sight. Her heart was pounding and her throat dry, when she crept down
  the stairs and assured herself that she had left sufficient food and drink
  for the animals.</p>

  <p>'Suppose the house catches fire,' she thought miserably.</p>

  <p>Even while she acted, she could not be sure in which direction lay her
  duty. Actually, she was deserting her post, although it was to serve her
  mistress. It was an additional complication that she had to catch the train
  which left at five minutes to four, in order to collect the key of No. 19
  Madeira Crescent, before the house-agent's office closed.</p>

  <p>The early start left her with time to kill in London, which could be spent
  more profitably at the Pond House.</p>

  <p>'I'll get everything ready for her meal,' she planned. 'I can leave it in
  the kitchen and go up and wait in the hall in the dark. When I hear her key,
  I'll surprise her...And if she's snooty with me. I'll go back to Scottie and
  David by the mid-night train. I won't mind then. She'll have had her welcome
  and I shall know she's safe in.'</p>

  <p>Slightly reassured by the thought that she was leaving open one way of
  retreat, she kissed the pets passionately before she stole from the house, by
  the back entrance.</p>

  <p>She had nearly reached the station, when Agatha Pitt&mdash;who was
  returning from the golf-course stopped her car to shout to Mrs Bosanquet.</p>

  <p>'You look in a hurry. Mother's Meeting? I'll run you to the foot of the
  church steps.'</p>

  <p>The Rector's wife gladly accepted the offer of a lift. On the way towards
  the Rectory, she told Miss Pitt about Miss Loveapple's message and her own
  failure to inform Elsie. Agatha listened with interest then, in her turn,
  related the story of the girl's morning visit to her house.</p>

  <p>'Depend on it,' she remarked, 'she's cut loose and gone up to London on
  the sly. She'll get it in the neck when Miss Loveapple hears about it. Good
  thing, too. That's a situation I never like&mdash;a mistress dominated by her
  maid. She'll probably leave her all her money.'</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Mrs Bosanquet did not share her satisfaction. Her grim
  face was thoughtful as she spoke to Miss Pitt.</p>

  <p>'When Elsie finds out that Miss Loveapple is not coming tonight, she may
  try to save her face by coming back on the midnight train. She's a
  respectable girl, and she may be annoyed by rough characters. You must go
  after her at once and stop her.'</p>

  <p>Miss Pitt grimaced as she glanced at her wrist.</p>

  <p>'Too late,' she said. 'It's five to four already.'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i> make it twelve to four,' Mrs Bosanquet told her.</p>

  <p>'You're slow. But I'll see if I can overtake her. It's the Will of Allah.
  It all depends on whose watch is right.'</p>

  <p>As the Rector's wife stood and watched the car out of sight, her face was
  grave. Although she was a strict disciplinarian, she believed in Elsie's
  devotion to Miss Loveapple which absolved her from Miss Pitt's suspicion of a
  stolen jaunt.</p>

  <p>'She's lost her head,' she reflected. 'Let's hope she'll lose nothing
  else.'</p>

  <p>She was thinking of a congenial situation, for, in her opinion, Elsie was
  not every one's choice. As she toiled up the long flights of steps, which
  Miss Loveapple had skipped over so lightly in her telephone call, her fingers
  sought the stiff bow of her hat-strings, as though for reassurance.</p>

  <p>The mothers came. The mothers went. Mrs Bosanquet lectured them and gave
  them tea&mdash;forgetting about Elsie. Miss Pitt returned from her mission
  and played clock-golf with her father, before dinner. As the light faded from
  the sky, the cat and dog inside the Pond House licked their plates clean, as
  a preliminary to retiring to their beds...</p>

  <p>It grew dark earlier up in London and particularly inside No. 19 Madeira
  Crescent, since all the blinds and curtains were drawn. The air was hot and
  stagnant&mdash;the atmosphere tense from the strain of protracted vigil.
  Because of the lack of traffic each sound assumed a disproportionate
  significance. Footsteps seemed to move about in the basement, as though a
  spectral cook had returned to the scene of her earthly activities. There was
  a faint clink which might have been caused by china&mdash;a creak of boards
  in the distance&mdash;a tapping which simulated the drip of water.</p>

  <p>As he crouched in the darkness&mdash;waiting&mdash;Clarence Club worked
  himself to a fever of suppressed excitement. His passion for revenge was
  about to be consummated. When he struck his blow it would not be a woman who
  crumpled up on the ground, but his enemy&mdash;Henry Watkins. Afterwards, he
  could read about the tragedy in the papers and admire the course of English
  justice, as administered by the Law.</p>

  <p>So far, everything had gone without a hitch. He could swear no one had
  observed him when he swarmed up a water-pipe to the balcony of a back window,
  on the first floor. The tradesmen's alley was deserted&mdash;he had seen no
  glimmer of light&mdash;heard no whisper.</p>

  <p>He had only to listen for the scrape of a key in the front door lock and
  then to steal towards the bottom of the stairs, where a glow of light from
  the street fell through the transom, on to the wall.</p>

  <p>The shadow thrown upon this illuminated patch would be the signal for him
  to strike, so that his victim would be taken by surprise and slump to the
  ground, without a struggle or scream.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that he waited for an unduly long time, but he dared not
  strike a match to look at his watch. Although the Crescent was so silent and
  withdrawn from the traffic of the main street, he had to remember the
  presence of people in the houses on either side. Someone outside in the
  garden might notice the faint thread of light through a chink of a
  curtain.</p>

  <p>He told himself that the train was late&mdash;or his victim had stopped at
  some place, to get a meal. Sooner or later, she was bound to enter the house.
  His part was to listen and wait...</p>

  <p>It was not until his patience was nearly exhausted, that he heard a sound
  from the hall below him. It was the closing of the front door. She had taken
  him unawares, for he had missed her footsteps on the pavement, as well as the
  thud of her suitcase when she dumped it down, in order to free both her
  hands.</p>

  <p>A thin line of foam frothed round his lips as he realized that the moment
  of his revenge had come. Through the mist which clouded his eyes, he saw a
  distorted shadow of a head thrown upon the wall. His heart leaped wildly as
  he gripped the iron poker tighter before he swung it high, taking aim at the
  dim shape below him in the hall.</p>

  <p>As he heard the crash of its fall and felt its force jarring the muscles
  of his arm, a throb of triumph surged over him.</p>

  <p>With that blow, he had just killed a man&mdash;a man who would continue to
  walk and talk, as though he were still alive.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE FIRST BIT OF LUCK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS LOVEAPPLE returned to England on the fourteenth of
  September.</p>

  <p>As she sat in the train on her way from Paris to Calais, her gloom
  contrasted sharply with the radiant mood in which she had started her
  holiday. Her confident bearing had gone, and&mdash;like a gallant, gilded
  frigate, battered by a gale&mdash;she bore the marks of her recent ordeal in
  her deteriorated appearance.</p>

  <p>The day was close, but she wore her camel-hair coat to conceal the
  dilapidation of the black satin suit. It could not hide the ladders in her
  stockings, but she had sunk to a level where she ceased to worry over
  personal trifles. Her pale face and heavy eyes betrayed a thumping head,
  while a strip of plaster covered a superficial cut on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Far worse than her physical plight was her bewilderment of spirit. She had
  suffered disappointment&mdash;an unnerving episode&mdash;financial loss. But
  what hurt most was the knowledge that, for the first time in her life, her
  luck had utterly deserted her.</p>

  <p>She could not understand its failure. As she looked at the dun fields and
  advertisement boards flashing past the window, she tried to localise the
  source of her bad fortune.</p>

  <p>'It began in London,' she decided, 'when I left my attaché-case behind me
  and had to borrow Lady Pontypool's jewel-case.'</p>

  <p>But the solution did not satisfy her, since it failed to account for a
  holiday which was substandard in every particular. A bad start had been
  followed by a nightmare train journey and the complication of personal
  entanglements.</p>

  <p>She told herself that since she had been so careless as to expose the
  coronet on the jewel-case, the crooks were bound to try and snatch it. It was
  an unpleasant episode, but&mdash;granted that it was inevitable&mdash;it
  would have been far better if it happened that day up at the Kleine
  Scheidegg. She would have been spared the sordid horror of the Paris
  adventure and it would not have involved a change of her plans.</p>

  <p>Cook would have arranged for her return from Grindelwald, so that she
  could have arrived in London, on the evening of the thirteenth of September,
  in time to keep her appointment with Major Brand. By now, however, Mr Lemon
  would have concluded the sale of her furniture and she had wasted a golden
  opportunity to prove the triumph of the personal element.</p>

  <p>'I did my best,' she thought. 'I left nothing to chance. I even risked
  losing my train, to buy white heather.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed as she traced back the convolutions of her fortune. The
  mischief was due to the fact that, during her last days in Switzerland, she
  had been protected unconsciously by a bodyguard of women. By postponing the
  attack to her Paris visit, these good people had upset her time-table at the
  final minute, and thus ruined her carefully-planned schedule.</p>

  <p>If she had met them for the first time in Grindelwald, at the hotel, they
  would have remained strangers. That night in the Calais-Interlaken express
  had been the beginning of a general intimacy for which Viva had been
  responsible. Had Viva been absent&mdash;and unable to display her unselfish
  disposition&mdash;the Furses would have passed her carriage, when they made
  their tour of the train, in search of a corner seat.</p>

  <p>Viva's presence there was accounted for by the fact that she had attached
  herself to Miss Loveapple, whom, she professed to regard as a lucky mascot.
  Yet, in the ordinary course of events, they should not have met, since Miss
  Loveapple's seat was booked in the Pullman coach, while Viva was in the end
  carriage. Their encounter was the result of her own last-minute rush to catch
  the train.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple unwound the last loops of the coil. 'Can you beat that?'
  she asked herself. 'My bad luck <i>started</i> with the white heather.'</p>

  <p>To her surprise, she began to laugh. Then she noticed that the train was
  getting near the coast. The bushes straining in the wind and the sway of the
  telegraph wires indicated a rough crossing. As she watched the gulls swooping
  overhead and the drift of blown sand, her thoughts flew ahead to No. 19
  Madeira Crescent, N.W.</p>

  <p>It was strange to think that it was hers no longer. She did not regret it
  but she was perplexed by minor worries. While she resolved to write to Mrs
  Brand&mdash;requesting the return of her attaché-case&mdash;she wondered
  whether she could ask for David's and Scottie's toys to be included in the
  parcel. They were chiefly rubber articles&mdash;the worse for teeth&mdash;and
  were left in the pets' playrooms at the top of the London house.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps not,' she decided reluctantly, as she thought of Buckingham's
  criticism. 'They might fancy I was peculiar.'</p>

  <p>While she frowned over her problem, the sinister element had already been
  routed from the atmosphere of No. 19 Madeira Crescent by the invasion of
  youth. The Brand family had taken possession of their new house. A tribe of
  children yelled like savages in their excitement as they galloped up and down
  stairs, exploring their domain from basement to attic.</p>

  <p>When they reached the top storey and discovered the large
  rooms&mdash;fitted with rubber flooring, dangling rope-ladders and other
  devices for the exercise of two confined animals&mdash;they took instant
  possession of their kingdom. The eldest boy shouted the news to his mother,
  who was in the hall. He had heard his parents discuss Miss
  Loveapple&mdash;but not by name&mdash;so his gratitude was expressed in a
  libel.</p>

  <p>'Mum, the blessed spinster lady has left us her children's toys.'</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the wreck of her reputation, Miss Loveapple boarded the
  Channel steamer. Her mood was still bleak, although the salty air revived her
  as she leaned over the side of the boat and watched the bubbles of foam
  below. The sky was clouded, but, at intervals, gleams of light burst through
  and picked out green patches amid the rolling sea.</p>

  <p>Swaying with every lurch of the vessel, she suddenly recalled the young
  man who had made an appointment to demonstrate his vacuum-cleaner early that
  morning. By then, the poor fellow had suffered a disappointment. It was an
  unpleasant reminder that she had let him down, because, in spite of his
  nonchalance, she was sure that he was one of life's failures. Although in the
  altered circumstances she could not have bought a vacuum cleaner, she could
  have paid him for his services.</p>

  <p>'I wish I could send him something to compensate for the loss of his
  time,' she thought. 'But I don't know what I did with his card.'</p>

  <p>She need not have worried, for the address she had lost was merely a
  fiction invented by Mr Henry Watkins, for business purposes. Besides, at the
  present time, Mr Clarence Club had changed his living-quarters. Instead of
  tenanting the darkish flat, he was lodged again at the expense of the
  Government.</p>

  <p>He had enough to occupy his mind to the exclusion of Miss Loveapple's
  carpets. It was difficult to think of a really satisfactory motive to explain
  why he was hiding inside certain locked premises and why he had attacked the
  staircase banister so savagely with a kitchen poker.</p>

  <p>Once again he had been lucky to avoid the mess of a dead policeman. The
  constable&mdash;whose shadow on the wall had so wilfully deceived
  him&mdash;was prepared for attack and had ducked in time to avoid it. But
  what bothered poor Clarence was the terrible dent in the solid mahogany of
  the stair rail, because the police appeared to regard it as evidence of
  murderous intention...</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple knew nothing of this, but in her turn she forgot Club as
  she watched the white cliffs of Dover grow clearer. She actually felt a stir
  of patriotic fervour when her foot touched English soil again. When she was
  among the first to pass through the customs unchallenged, her spirits rose at
  this proof of preferential treatment.</p>

  <p>Her start gave her time to get a cup of tea and a ham-sandwich from a
  trolley. As she had eaten only the usual Continental breakfast, the
  refreshment revived her. By the time her train steamed out of Dover station,
  her head had ceased to ache and she was soothed to a state of dreamy
  contentment as she looked out at the flying landscape.</p>

  <p>She noticed that the country had felt the first nip of frost, for there
  were golden boughs pendant amid the dark foliage of the trees. The orchards
  were heaped with piles of small red apples. In further evidence of autumn,
  the hedges were festooned with old-man's-beard which reminded her of Harvest
  Festival at Highfield and the unholy competition to decorate the pulpit.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her spirits soared as she realised that she was going back to all
  she held dear&mdash;her well-ordered life, the comfort of her home, the
  beauty of her garden, the trifling stir but tremendous importance of village
  life. Those whom she loved would be waiting to welcome her. She was glad that
  she was returning directly to the Pond House instead of breaking her journey
  at London. In spite of her financial disappointment, money was not the first
  factor...</p>

  <p>While her mistress thought of her, Elsie was in a state of happy
  excitement. But even as she prepared for Miss Loveapple's reception, she felt
  cold whenever she thought of her own lucky escape. To-day she could not
  understand what flare of sudden madness had compelled her to disobey orders
  and start out to travel up to the London house.</p>

  <p>It was only by the merest chance that she did not get into the train which
  was waiting when she reached the Station. As she heard the peremptory hoot of
  a car on the road behind her, she turned her head and saw Miss Pitt making
  frantic signals to her. For a moment she was tempted to rush on to the
  platform, but her training prevailed and she returned sullenly to the
  car.</p>

  <p>After Miss Pitt had explained Miss Love-apple's change of plan a lump
  arose in her throat, so that she could not thank her for her
  intervention.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't have half copped it when she found out,' she said.</p>

  <p>'And you'd have deserved it,' commented Miss Pitt. 'What made you do such
  a silly thing?'</p>

  <p>Elsie shook her head bashfully.</p>

  <p>'It was something come over me. I couldn't abide her staying alone at that
  blinking London house.'</p>

  <p>When Miss Pitt had driven away, she regretted her uneducated expressions,
  especially as David was not present to accept their responsibility. She did
  not know that Miss Pitt had never liked her better than when she stood and
  gaped, while her face changed from red to white, in proof of the intensity of
  her emotions.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, in the safety of the Pond House, she arranged an artistic
  bowl of nasturtiums for Miss Loveapple's toilet table, while she tried to
  drum an idea into the heads of David and Scottie by constant repetition.</p>

  <p><i>'Mistress is coming home to-day.'</i></p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple was very happy to be coming home. Every minute the train
  was bringing her so much nearer to her front door. There was only one cloud
  on the future, and that was the prospect of her interview with Buckingham.
  She was certain that he would keep his word and subject her to another
  distressing discussion.</p>

  <p>While she was in Switzerland, he had been a disturbing influence,
  dislocating her set ideas and trying to scoop her out of her happy routine.
  Even now, while she was slipping back into her rut, she had a sense of
  friction as though she were not fitting into the proper grooves.</p>

  <p>'So futile of him to come,' she thought. 'He knows I shall refuse
  him.'</p>

  <p>At that moment the sun burst through the clouds, drenching the sombre
  landscape with golden light. As she stared at the transformed fields, the
  rigid mould of her mind suddenly cracked apart, to admit a new and startling
  idea.</p>

  <p>'Other people get married. I am not unique...Why shouldn't <i>I</i>?'</p>

  <p>The change of view involved such a violent mental wrench that it affected
  her almost as a physical shock. Her face grew scarlet and her eyes glared in
  the fierceness of her opposition to the threat of recantation. She had grown
  so used to being Miss Loveapple. She knew Miss Loveapple intimately and she
  liked her very much.</p>

  <p>But now some powerful submerged instinct was urging her to exchange Miss
  Loveapple for a stranger. Mrs Buckingham was the unknown element and her
  mystery held a challenge to the future.</p>

  <p>Miss Loveapple accepted this new test of her character. As she had made a
  good job of all she undertook, she was certain that her marriage would be a
  success. As an inducement, it would involve plans and readjustments. She
  would have to build on a new wing to the Pond House and help to establish
  Buckingham in a congenial career.</p>

  <p>But on one point she was definite: Her future husband must change his
  Christian name. There was only one 'David'&mdash;a blue Persian cat. To avoid
  confusion, she would endow him with her favourite name of 'Hubert' in return
  for his gift of 'Flora.'</p>

  <p>As the idea of marriage continued to expand, she was carried away on a
  tidal wave of excitement, so that she never noticed when fields and hedges
  were replaced by masonry. She gave a start of surprise as the train steamed
  under the domed room of Victoria Station. Again she strode along the
  platform, her face radiant with happiness. She left the yard and crossed the
  road to Victoria Street, while she rehearsed the announcement of her
  engagement to the rector's wife.</p>

  <p>'You won't save a tea on me much longer. <i>I'm</i> going to qualify for
  your blessed Mothers' Meeting.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly, just as she was entering a tea-shop, she was rent by a pang of
  home-hunger. She felt that she could not endure another minute spent away
  from her precious Pond House. There was an earlier train back to Highfield,
  but it involved a rush to make the connections, so that she had ruled it out
  of her programme.</p>

  <p>Glancing at her watch, she discovered that there still remained a narrow
  margin of time in which to catch the train. Unfortunately, however, she could
  not decide on the quickest form of transport. She had heard that traffic
  blocks were avoided on the Underground; but if she returned to the station
  and descended to the District Railway she would have to walk up the hill from
  the Embankment.</p>

  <p>The minutes were passing while she stood in irresolution. After letting
  empty taxis pass her, they all whirled by with their flags down. She was
  beginning to think that she had wasted too much time and had better discard
  the idea in favour of a leisurely tea, when a Charing Cross bus swung around
  the corner.</p>

  <p>She regarded it as a hopeless proposition, for it appeared to be full
  already, while a group of people waited at its stopping-place, farther down
  the street. At that moment, however, a policeman held up his hand and it
  stopped level with Miss Loveapple.</p>

  <p>As a passenger took advantage of the stop to jump out, she leaped up the
  steps and sank into his vacant seat.</p>

  <p>It seemed an omen for the future&mdash;a formal restoration to her
  rightful plane of good fortune. Thrilled and elated, she beamed around her as
  she impulsively took every one into her confidence.</p>

  <p><i>'There!</i> That's the first bit of luck I've had this trip.'</p>
