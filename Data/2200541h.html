<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. His Own Man</h2>

<p>"James Lewis Macfarlane."</p>

<p>The bearer of this name swung his feet to the floor and sat up
suddenly, cupping his big hands over his knees to steady himself.
For the past hour, between periods of half-conscious drowsiness, he
had been hearing the verdict that men in authority were pronouncing
upon men over whose destinies they held control; but it had not
appealed to him that his own case might come under
consideration.</p>

<p>That morning he had sat for an hour in the sunshine in front of
the huge hospital where our country is trying to restore men who
had been abroad to take their part in the war. Of late he had been
realizing that in his fight for health he was waging a losing
battle. He had not been able to combat the shrapnel wound in his
left breast with the same success with which he had fought the
enemy. So he had resolved to test his strength. He had gotten up
and started down the road to learn precisely how far his legs would
carry him. He had forgotten to reckon on the fact that going down a
mountain is much easier than climbing one; so he had gone on until
his knees began to waver and he found his strength exhausted. He
had rested awhile and then turned back, but the upward trip had
been slow business, painful work, work that set a cold perspiration
running and a gnawing fire burning in his left breast, while the
bandages over his shoulders and around his body had become things
of torment. The hot sun of California had beaten down on him until
he was panting for breath. He was forced repeatedly to stop and to
seek a resting place on any projecting stone or dry embankment of
the mountain-side. His tired eyes were wearied with the panorama of
brilliant colour that lay stretched everywhere around him the green
of the live oak, the bright holly berries, the pinkish-white urns
of the manzanita, the purplish velvet of the pitcher sage, the
clotted blue-lavender cobwebs of the thistle sage. The only things
he did see were the frequent heads of Indian Warrior, and he saw
them because they were like wounds on the earth, as red as real
blood, as red as the blood that had soaked many a battlefield,
dripped in many a hospital, that he saw every day on the dressings
that were removed from his side.</p>

<p>He had seen so much blood that anything that reminded him of it
was nauseating, so he turned from the gorgeous flower eagerly
painting the mountain-side, and looked up to the blue of the sky.
But looking toward the sky only more clearly defined the rough path
he must follow. There came to his mind a passage that he had heard
his father read from his pulpit on Sabbath mornings with the burr
of Scotch that a generation of our country had not eliminated: "I
will lift mine eyes to the hills from whence cometh my help."</p>

<p>He was lifting his eyes to the hills, but no help came. He
wondered whether this was because he was obeying the dictates of
other men, or whether it was because he had forgotten God. In his
childhood his father and mother had taught him to pray and to
believe that his prayers would be answered. When he had gone out to
serve his country, for some inexplicable reason he had stopped
praying and concentrated all his forces on fighting. There were
atrocities that had been committed against men of his race and
blood in the beginning of the war that drove all men of Scottish
ancestry and sympathies a trifle wild.</p>

<p>He had reached the war period one of the gentlest of men. But he
had embarked in the venture that other men of our country of
different ancestry felt was freeing the world from tyranny, with
outrage in his breast, a feeling that was shared by all men of the
race and country of his people. Things had happened to one certain
band of Scots, that no man having a drop of Scottish blood in his
veins ever could or wanted to forget. Under the stress of this
feeling, the lad whose mother had always lovingly referred to him
as "my Jamie" forgot her teachings and her God, and went out to see
how much personal vengeance he could wreak upon the men who had
wounded the heart of all Scotland deeper than the exigencies of
ordinary warfare need wound the heart of a nation.</p>

<p>He had gone for vengeance and he had revenged himself thoroughly
on many an enemy; then the hour had come when a ragged sliver of
filth-encrusted iron had entered his breast and poisoned his blood.
After weeks on the border land he had dragged back to his feet, and
now he carried with him two wounds that would not heal, one in his
heart that the world could not see, and one on his breast over
which doctors and nurses vainly laboured.</p>

<p>When it was definitely settled that he could not go back to
service he was sent home. There another wound was added to the
already deep ones that were torturing him. During the three years
of his absence the frail little mother, eaten with fear and anxiety
for her only son, had made her crossing, and his father, always
dependent upon her, had not long survived. The small property had
been sold to pay for their resting places, and nothing remained in
all this world that belonged to him&mdash;neither relative nor fire
side. Even his friends had scattered, and there was nothing for him
but to remain a ward of the Government until such time as he was
pronounced able to begin life again for himself.</p>

<p>In recognition of valiant service, indicated by a couple of
medals and a Service Bar pinned over the wound he carried, he had
been sent to California, where it was hoped that the brilliant
sunshine, the fruits, and the clean salt air, the eternal summer of
a beneficent land, would work the healing that the physicians had
been unable to bring about. He had been given the benefit of the
best place there was to send men in his condition. The mountain
resort, Arrowhead Springs&mdash;high on a mountain covered with the
foliage of every tree, bush, and vine native to such a location,
where the air was perfumed with flowers and full of bird
song&mdash;the Government had taken and had made into a great
hospital; and the reason for the location was that at this point
Nature brought to the surface a stream of boiling-hot water, water
so hot that it was not possible to thrust the hand into it, water
that boiled from some cavern below where the unquenched fires that
are always burning in the heart of the earth flamed their reddest
and the streams came up with the tang of sulphur and many chemicals
and with unvarying heat year after year. The springs were piped
through the hospital, where all their medicinal properties were
turned upon the men who, like Jamie MacFarlane, must be healed of
stubborn wounds before they could return home to take up a man's
work in the affairs of our land.</p>

<p>As he struggled up the mountain that morning the perspiration,
streaked his cheeks. While his knees wavered and his white hands
clutched at any tree or shrub that offered support, James
MacFarlane was thinking. He was thinking fast and thinking deeply.
He was wondering, since one year at these boiling mineral springs
had done him no good whatever, whether another year would
accomplish what the first had failed in doing. He was wondering if
he were not weaker, less of a man, than he had been a year ago. He
was wondering how long the Government was going to keep him at
these springs when their water did him no good. He knew of the
bitter denunciations that were being made all over the country of
those in charge of caring for our returned soldiers. He knew of the
red tape, the graft, and the slowness involved in reaching the boys
with the treatment that they needed and which should have been
accorded them with all the speed that was used in starting them on
their perilous venture. He knew there was bitterness in the heart
of almost every wounded man on this point. There was poignant
bitterness in his own heart. So many weeks had been wasted. So many
months had passed before decision had been made as to what was to
be done, and how it was to be done, and where it was to be done. So
much had been taken for granted and so little efficiently
accomplished after peace had been declared.</p>

<p>In his enforced moments of rest, he kept lifting his eyes to the
sky. He could not look at the sky without his thoughts climbing
very high, and sometimes that morning they almost skirted the foot
of the throne. He realized that he would have given anything in
this world if he could have gone home and knelt at the knees of his
mother, laid his head on her lap, and tried the one thing that he
had not yet tried&mdash;just the plain, old-fashioned thing of
asking God for the help he had not been able to secure from
man.</p>

<p>And so at last he had reached the palms and roses, the loquats
and oranges, and the grape-covered slopes where cultivation had
begun to provide food for those who lived on the mountain-top. He
looked at the bloom-laden orchards almost with distaste. He was so
tired. The air was sickeningly sweet with the penetrant and
enduring perfume. He thought with impatience that he would be glad
if his eyes might rest upon some spot where a blood-red flare would
not strike them to bitter memory, for persistently around the rocks
of the mountain-side, close to the spots of cultivation in which
each tree was rooted, there blazed the flame of the Indian Warrior.
So he had at last dragged up the driveway and up the front steps
where he had done a thing that was not customary.</p>

<p>All the grounds and the side verandas were for the men, but
disabled soldiers were not supposed to drape them selves over the
reed davenports near the big entrance doors. There happened to be a
davenport standing under a broad window at one side of the entrance
that offered him the first solution of a resting place. He glanced
at several automobiles he did not recognize as he climbed the
steps; then he headed straight for the lounge and stretched himself
on it, where for a time he lay unconscious of what was going on
around him.</p>

<p>As he became rested, voices on the inside of the window at first
were only voices, and then, as his heart quieted and the burning in
his side eased and his tired limbs relaxed, he realized that name
after name was being read from a list and each name represented a
man whose case was being discussed and what was eventually to be
come of him was being decided upon. But he had not realized as they
went down the J's and the K's and the Us that M was coming soon. He
had been in the hospital so long; he was so accustomed to his room,
to his nurses, to the routine, and the men he knew, that the place
was home, the only home on earth he had. Everyone had been kind. He
had no fault to find with the doctors or the nurses. They had done
their best, and he had done his best; but the truth remained that
he was no better, that lately doubts had arisen as to whether he
were even as well as he had been when he came. And then, with all
the suddenness of an unexpected blow, clear on his ears came his
own name, in that cold, impersonal tone of business men transacting
an affair of business with an eye single to the welfare of the
greatest good to the greatest number. He did not recall ever having
heard his name spoken in precisely such tones before. It made him
feel as if he were not a man, but merely an object. And then he
realized that the matter under discussion was the disposal of that
particular object. He heard his place of enlistment, his war
service, his awards, a description of his wounds recited in such a
monotonous tone that he realized it was being droned from a book,
and then a brisker voice inquired:</p>

<p>"How long has MacFarlane been here?"</p>

<p>The answer came: "A little more than a year."</p>

<p>Then the question: "Have the springs done him any good? Is he
better?"</p>

<p>Then the answer: "Not so well. His wound is stub born and in
spite of all we can do it refuses to heal."</p>

<p>The sweat of Jamie's exertion had dried up on his body but it
broke out again with the next question.</p>

<p>"Is he tubercular?"</p>

<p>And the answer was: "No. Not yet. But he is in a condition where
at any minute tuberculosis might develop. There never was more
fertile ground for it."</p>

<p>Jamie MacFarlane sat gripping his knees and licking his dry lips
and waiting to hear the verdict. It came in few words.</p>

<p>"Send him to Camp Kearney."</p>

<p>For a minute the red of the Indian Warrior flamed be fore the
eyes of the listening man until he could only see red. For a minute
hot anger seared his body in scorching protest. He had heard them
say that he was not tubercular, but that he was fine breeding
ground for the dread disease. Now they were planning to send him
into a place where every man either had the plague, or was so near
it that he had been sent to take the risk of contracting it, as was
proposed in his case. It was not fair! It was not just! He had
enlisted early and eagerly. He was not a drafted man. He had fought
to the limit of his power. He had taken whatever came
uncomplainingly. The medals he wore attested his daring. He would
march into that room and he would tell those doctors what he
thought of them and their callous decision.</p>

<p>He tried to rise and found that he was too weak to stand on his
feet, and then he heard the doctor who had read off the names
voicing a protest in his behalf: "I can hardly feel that it is fair
to send a man of MacFarlane's achievements and in his fertile
condition to what is admittedly a place for the tubercular."</p>

<p>The other voice answered: "If a year here has left him not so
well as he was, why hope that another year will do more than keep
him in the place of a physically better man who might come in and
make a recovery if he had MacFarlane's chance?"</p>

<p>At the cold justice of that statement Jamie MacFarlane sank on
the lounge and lay back on the pillow, and of how long he lay there
he kept no count. He only knew that the voices were going on inside
of the window and that men were being judged, that hopeless cases
were being sent to what appealed to him as a hopeless place, while
those who had a chance were being given the greatest opportunity to
recover. And that was fair; that was just. But being of Scottish
extraction, having been born with a fight in his veins and an
eternal and steadfast love of the mountains and the stars and the
sky and the sea and his fellow men, he decided that he would no
longer be any man's man or the man of any government. He was alone
and derelict. He would be his own man. If he must die, why die in
Camp Kearney where the greatest plague that ravages humanity gnawed
in the breast of every doomed man? Without time for mature
deliberation, without any preparation whatever, James Lewis
MacFarlane reached up and gripped the window sill with one hand,
with the other laid hold on an arm of the couch and brought himself
to a standing posture. He retraced his steps down to the roadway,
and there he turned to the right, which faced him toward the north,
and with slow, careful steps, he began his Great Adventure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. The Great Adventure</h2>

<p>Now a great adventure may be killing white hippopotami in Africa
to one man and commanding his own soul for an hour to another. To
Jamie MacFarlane, after years of steadily taking orders from
superior officers, there was something exhilarating in assuming an
erect position and for the first time deciding for himself whether
he would seek his fortune toward the north or the south. Why he
decided on going north, he had not the slightest notion, but it was
probably because the road led down in that direction, and he had
found mountain-climbing more than he could endure. So he started
north and on a down grade. He went very slowly; he kept looking at
the sky, the trees, and it seemed to him that the blooming orange
orchards he passed and the lemons and the loquats were less heavy
in their perfume, the air grew more bracing. He began to wonder if
he could ever reach the sea, if he could have a strong tang of salt
in the air if it might not be bracing. He picked up a stick beside
the road and used it as a cane upon which to lean. After a while he
came to a crossroad and there he paused intently to examine each of
the three directions, any of which he might travel if he chose.
Truly he was having a heady adventure!</p>

<p>As he stood there a car approached from the east, and noticing
Jamie's uniform, his emaciated face and hands, the driver stopped,
as all drivers stopped in those days, only Jamie, confined in
hospitals, did not know it, and asked him if he would like to ride.
The car was turning north, so Jamie said that he would very much
like to ride. That is how it happened that the wheels of an
automobile carried him so far from the region of the hospital that
when he was really missed and nurses were sent out to seek him, one
hundred miles away and still speeding north ward, Jamie was making
fine progress on his big adventure.</p>

<p>He liked the road that led to the north. He liked it so well
that when finally the driver told him he was turning west at the
next crossroad, where he had business in a big city, Jamie decided
that a man in a uniform who might be sought by government officials
had better remain in the country, and so he climbed from the car
and slowly plodded north.</p>

<p>In an enforced rest, he began to realize that night was coming
and that he was hungry. He had not a cent in his pockets, and to
lie on the ground in the chill of a California night would probably
kill him very speedily. Then he realized that quite likely death
was the Great Adventure he was seeking; that in taking his fate in
his own hands and walking out of the hospital and away from the
provisions that were made for him by his government, he had known
that he would exhaust himself speedily to such a point that his
troubles would be ended in the quickest way. He spent a few minutes
wondering whether his troubles would be ended or only just begun,
because the Scots have a way of teaching hell, and lire, and
brimstone, and having been to the world's latest war, Jamie
MacFarlane knew more about hell than any Scottish minister who ever
had described it from a pulpit, and having carried an open wound in
his breast for nearly two years, there was no one who could tell
him much about fire, and the brimstone at the springs had not
worked.</p>

<p>So he went on through the evening shadows until he could go no
longer; then he sat down on a nice, big, warm boulder beside the
road, crossed his feet, and waited to see what would happen. The
very thing that he might have known would happen had he been living
among a world of well men, did happen. Another car came along, and
the owner, noting his pallor and his uniform and having a vacant
seat, stopped, and again he was asked if he would care to ride.</p>

<p>"Slick!" said Jamie to himself. "Maybe this isn't going to be so
bad after all."</p>

<p>He looked at the car, which was loaded to the running boards
with camping paraphernalia. He could see rolls of bedding; he could
scent food. The man had a friendly face, the girl on the seat
beside him was young and pretty. The woman with whom he was invited
to occupy the back seat was of motherly appearance. Her round face
was strong and attractive, and, under the spell of it, Jamie was
guilty of evasion. He said he had just left a hospital where he had
been for a year. He gave the impression that the doctors had
discharged him. He did not say that he had discharged himself, that
he was a fugitive. He did say that he was looking for work and that
he would be mighty glad to ride with them until he reached a
location where something promising offered for men newly mustered
from the service and weak from illness.</p>

<p>The driver said that he was William Brunson from Iowa; that he
and his wife and daughter had been touring California in their car
during the winter, but now they were going to the north part of the
state to visit friends until it came time to head for home as they
must reach Albion in time to put in the crops.</p>

<p>And Jamie, fearing that in starting his Great Adventure he might
get into the papers, neglected to say what his name was, but he did
say that he would be wonderfully glad to ride with them as far as
they were going in his direction.</p>

<p>He was glad to ride, but he was not half so glad to ride as he
was when the car stopped and in the mouth of a canyon near the road
a camp was made. He hoped no one saw that he staggered or how short
his breath came as he tried to help in unloading the car. He had to
be careful because the one big thing for which he was thankful
beyond words had happened. He had only looked toward the hills. He
had only thought about asking the Lord for help. He wondered
vaguely if there might be a possibility that God had been looking
in his direction at that instant, if He had seen his need, if He
had sent these kind, hearty people who were offering supper, a bed
roll for the night, and a lift on his journey for the morrow. That
was that much. And so he put up the very best bluff that he could
at being a whole man and a sound man while he gathered wood for a
night fire, and prospected for a place to spread the beds and find
comfort. He had a feeling that he did not quite deserve the thing
that was happening to him. He had been wondering if he would be
forced to crawl away among the bushes like a whipped dog and in the
chill of the night find a certain but painful release. This was not
exactly as he had expected things to happen. He was going to have a
supper of hot food and a blanket. In deference to his white face
and shaking hands, he had been offered a choice location close to
the camp fire, so there was no reason why to-morrow should find him
any worse for the experience.</p>

<p>Ann Brunson was a jolly soul. She was everybody's friend. She
persisted in calling Jamie "You Mr. Soldier-man," and when she saw
how very white and uncertain on his feet he was, she mercifully
gave him a seat and set him to peeling potatoes, while she left her
daughter and her husband to do the rougher work of completing the
camp.</p>

<p>As he had made his way down the driveway from the hospital to
the road, it had occurred to Jamie MacFarlane that for a man in his
condition to walk out of the only shelter on earth to which he was
entitled without a penny in his pockets was a Great Adventure. As
he sat peeling potatoes for Ann Brunson while her daughter and her
husband showed him all the tricks that could be concealed in and
around the body of a five-passenger car, the neat little cupboard
on the running board for dishes and food, the tiny refrigerator,
the two-plate gasoline stove for boiling the coffee and cooking the
meat and potatoes, the possibility of getting many things into an
amazingly small compass, he thought that his adventure was going to
be homelike and common and that the country was full of kindly
people who had not forgotten their soldier boys. There was a bare
chance that he might find some light work that he could do, that
something might happen which would at least be better than
permanent retirement to the City of the White Plague. So he tried
to be very careful and peel the potatoes thin and handle them as he
had been taught by his thrifty mother when he helped her in a
kitchen of childhood. As he worked it did not appeal to him that
there might be an adventure each minute drawing nearer. He had
taken the precaution to place himself behind the car so that any
passer-by might not see him, and after supper was finished and the
beds made up, he had lifted a pair of eyes trained to scouting and
had seen a flickery light, far above but slowly descending, so he
had said that he would take a short stroll.</p>

<p>He had left the Brunsons and slowly and quietly had made his way
back through the canyon among thickets of holly and live oak,
looking for a spot where he might rest for even a short time and
watch that uncanny light, be alone and try to plan for the morrow.
One thing he felt imperative to his flight, and that was as
speedily as possible to get rid of his uniform. If the officials
really missed him from the hospital, if they sent out a general
call, his uniform would be the thing which would quickly identify
him. Every man in uniform would be scrutinized; there would be
radios, telephones, newspapers against him. He must think what he
could do and how he could do it.</p>

<p>So he went up the canyon until he left the light and the voices
of the camp behind him and when he found he was tired, he sat down
in the white moonlight and looked up for the light and it was gone.
Foolish of him to be uneasy. Someone had lost a trail and had now
found it. He did not realize that the rock upon which he sat so
blended with the overhanging branches of a live oak that he was
invisible. He did not realize it until in one breath of soft breeze
sweeping down the mountain at his back he found himself face to
face with plenty of adventure and of sufficient size to satisfy
him. He did not realize how long he had sat figuring on what he
could possibly do. What aroused him was a Something coming down to
the canyon on his right, and as he looked steadily in that
direction, he saw the figure of a large man emerge from the bushes
and begin carefully making his way, with as little sound as
possible, straight toward him.</p>

<p>As the man cleared the shadows and stepped into full moonlight
Jamie could see that he was tall, bareheaded, in his shirt sleeves,
wearing boots and breeches. There was a heavy belt filled with
cartridges around his waist, and when he turned to look over the
path that he had traversed and to listen, Jamie MacFarlane could
see the big gun on the right hip convenient to the man's hand. So
his breath came very softly, and as stilly as in No Man's Land he
wormed farther back among the overhanging branches.</p>

<p>The reason a great adventure is an adventure is because the
things that happen are so very simple and so very natural. Why it
is great is merely because one has not expected it, not because it
could not very well have been expected had one's wits been working.
A formidable man with a big gun headed down the canyon toward
Jamie, he reflected, <i>might</i> constitute something of an
adventure. The might grew to large possibilities when the ears of
Jamie, who had done quite a bit of scouting and much work on his
stomach between firing lines, realized that down the mountain to
the left of him there was coming a Something else that was alive,
Something that was slipping, that was using the utmost caution, and
yet slowly and surely was coming his way.</p>

<p>The adventure loomed large enough to suit Jamie's wildest ideas
of adventure when a second man, not quite so large as the first but
still formidable, a darker figure since he wore a coat and hat, who
carried an ugly revolver in his right hand, slowly parted the
bushes and stepped into the canyon slightly to the left.</p>

<p>Then Jamie sat in open-mouthed wonder while these two men met
because of the signal light he had seen and the big man told the
other that he had been down to the road to see what the smoke and
the fire meant; that there was a party of tourists, a mere mouse of
a man, they could risk his being unarmed while either of them could
handle him with one hand. The turnout looked as if undoubtedly a
few hundred dollars could be depended on somewhere about the man,
or one or the other of the women, or the car.</p>

<p>The second man had straightened up and said slowly: "One man and
two women. Are the janes young and likely looking?"</p>

<p>All the blood in James MacFarlane had rushed to his head, and
then back to his hands and feet, where fighting blood is most at
home. He was no longer a sick soldier dependent on the mercy of a
passing stranger. His stomach was fortified with the potatoes and
the meat and the coffee and the bread that smiling Ann Brunson had
shared with him. He had drunk the water that laughing little Susan
had brought to him, and bathed his tired face in it. He had no
doubt but money to pay the expenses of the journey was in the
pockets of one of the party. They had earned it by hard work on a
farm. They had gone pleasuring as was their right, and so far they
had had a pleasant time, but if they were to be robbed of their
money, if William Brunson were to be beaten to insensibility or
killed, if the women who had befriended Jamie were to be left to
the mercy of these two in the canyon before him, then there was
something very worth while in the world remaining for him to do, or
at least to give what life he had left in attempting to do.</p>

<p>So, like a snake over the stones, he drew himself together and
felt with a long arm for a big piece of loose rock, and when the
precise moment arrived at which the big man drew near to the
smaller one to hear what description he would give of the women of
the camp, softly, under cover of the oak branch, at one and the
same time Jamie MacFarlane did two things. With his right hand he
reached for the revolver in the holster on the back of the big man;
with his left he smashed the jagged rock squarely into the face of
the man who was slavering over the description of a sweet young
girl. When the big man wheeled he found his own revolver in his own
face, and there was nothing to do but to back away with his hands
in the air as he was ordered, while Jamie MacFarlane, even taller
and more massive of frame, slid down from the rock and extricated
the weapon from the fingers of the bleeding and half-senseless
bandit. With the two guns in his possession, Jamie put sufficient
distance between himself and the men for safety.</p>

<p>Then he said to the bigger one: "Throw me your cartridge belt
and your shoes and trousers." In reference to the smaller man he
said: "Peel off his coat and throw it to me, also his hat." When he
had these garments in his possession, he backed still farther away,
and then he laid one of the guns very conveniently and with the
other shifting from his right hand to his left, he man aged to shed
the uniform of a soldier of the United States. He got out of the
boots and the breeches and the coat, saving nothing but his
identification tag and valour medal, and he put on the things that
he had accumulated.</p>

<p>Then he kicked together in a bundle the things he was leaving
and with both guns and the belt in his possession he backed his way
down the canyon until he had put sufficient distance between
himself and the two bandits so that he dared to turn and make his
way as speedily as possible back to camp.</p>

<p>In the darkness made by the shadow of a branch, he awakened
William Brunson as quietly as possible and explained his change of
wardrobe, and he thrust into the hand of his host one of the guns
that he carried. In the fear that there might be accomplices who
might follow with the bandits, camp was broken hastily, everything
piled into the car, and speedily many miles were placed between
themselves and the men who preyed without discrimination upon the
purses and the happiness of others.</p>

<p>When the car moved away with its load, Jamie MacFarlane leaned
back and rested his head against the sup ports of the car top and
laughed weakly.</p>

<p>"After all," he said to the Brunsons, "army training is not so
bad. If I had never been a soldier, I doubt seriously if I could
have made myself invisible or if at one and the same time I could
have taken the gun of one man and smashed the face of another. And
as for collecting their wardrobe, I understand that our government
does not desire soldiers who have been discharged to use their
uniforms for any great length of time, so it is well to get rid of
mine the first day I become a plain American citizen."</p>

<p>Exactly what William Brunson and his wife and daughter might
have thought of this in the safety of an Iowa farm, where time for
thinking occurs frequently, is one thing. What they thought of it
as they fled down a California road with two guns in the car, two
irate bandits behind them who might possibly overtake them in a
speedier car at any minute, and possibly a third bandit with them,
was a different proposition entirely. Susy Branson sat on the front
seat and held the revolver that had been given her father
convenient to his reach. Mrs. Branson sat on the back seat with her
eyes round and a heart full of consternation. William Brunson
stepped on the gas and turned at every crossroad he encountered. He
did not in the least care where he went. All he wanted was to lose
proximity to where he had been. He had a feeling that the lights of
any small town that California proffered would look very good to
him at that minute. As for Jamie MacFarlane, he had enjoyed his
supper; he had clothes that would not identify him as the man who
was missing from the Arrowhead Hospital; he knew where he hoped to
get his breakfast, he considered himself lost to the world of
hospitals, and if he could achieve this ad venture during his first
day of freedom, there was every hope that he might be able at least
to hold his own on the morrow. And so, through utter exhaustion,
his head began slowly to sink down and over. Mrs. Brunson, dubious
about the clothes, studied him as intently as she could by the
night light. He looked exactly like any decent American of Scottish
extraction, debilitated by illness. Finally she whispered to her
daughter, "Susy, can't you dig out a pillow for this poor boy? You
can see he has been awfully sick and he is plumb tired out."</p>

<p>Susy managed to get the pillow from the end of a roll on the
running board, and Mrs. Brunson laid it on her shoulder and against
the back end of the car and pulled Jamie's head over on it, while
Susy knelt on the front seat and with tears of thankfulness still
wet on her young face, tucked a blanket over the shoulders of Jamie
MacFarlane as she said, "I tell you, Ma, from what he said to Pa,
we have had a pretty close call, and I believe we better ship the
car and get on the train, and go north by the quickest, safest
route."</p>

<p>But Mother Brunson, being made of sterner stuff, re plied: "Oh,
I guess not. We will just keep closer to the towns when night
comes. We will stop this sleeping be side the road. We'll keep the
gun your Pa's got and get some cartridges for it at the first stop.
I think we can make it all right and finish our trip."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. The Bee Master</h2>

<p>"Ma, do you think we've shook 'em?" inquired William Brunson
over his shoulder along in the cold, still hours between three and
four the next morning.</p>

<p>"Got any idea how many miles we've come?" asked his wife, and
William said he had not. He had forgotten to look at the
speedometer when they stopped to make camp but he was certain that
he had turned a hundred corners and taken every crossroad he saw,
and the small town they were entering appeared as if there might be
some place in it where they could find a clean bed and have a few
hours of rest. As they drove down the main street they saw the open
door and the lights of a hotel and so they decided that they would
have beds and a good rest, and then they would have baths and
breakfasts, and after that they would hold a counsel and decide
what they would do.</p>

<p>When it came to leaving the car, they found their guest of the
road sleeping so heavily it seemed a pity to awaken him, so they
locked the car, threw an extra blanket over him, and left him to
the luxury of the en tire back seat. That was how it happened that
when the life of the town began to stir on the streets that
morning, James MacFarlane awoke with a bewildered sense of being
lost. He had no idea what had happened to the Brunsons or where he
was, but he speedily learned that, by reading signs on the streets
around him, and he figured that nothing could have happened to the
Brunsons in a town of several thousand population; so his first
thought concerned breakfast. He had hoped the night before that he
would be with the Brunsons, probably at the location on which they
were camped before making a start for the day. Now, evidently,
their plans had changed. They would probably come from the hotel
before which the car was standing, refreshed with sleep, baths and
food. He reflected that he had enjoyed refreshing sleep, he could
postpone the bath, but there was an insistent demand in the pit of
his stomach for food. He was in no mood to be particularly choice.
He was so ravenously hungry that he felt he could have eaten almost
anything, and tantalizingly there arose from restaurants, from the
hotel building, from cafes and corner stands around him, the odours
of ripe fruits. Later the aroma of coffee and cooked foods assailed
his nostrils, so he began to figure on how he could materialize
breakfast.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that he would step from the car and stretch
his legs on the sidewalk and see if he could shake himself into
slightly better circulation. He found himself sniffing ham and
fried potatoes and toast and coffee and bacon and waffles somewhere
in the immediate neighbour hood; merely from force of habit,
because he knew there was not a penny in his pockets, he ran his
hands into the region where the pockets of a male are usually
located and stood in stupefied bewilderment because he brought the
hand back to the light, and in it there was quite an assortment of
nickels and dimes, a quarter or two, and a fifty-cent piece. His
mouth fell open slowly and his eyes widened, and without in the
least knowing why he did it, he looked above the line of the
buildings over the range of the mountains in the distance and on
across the cloudless deep blue of the California sky and said, very
politely: "I thank thee, Lord."</p>

<p>He could not have told how long it had been since he had
reverently said, "I thank thee, Lord." He had been figuring that in
the few years past he had not experienced very much for which to
thank the Lord, at least not since a fire had been eating in his
breast and weakness had assailed his limbs and shaken his big,
capable hands. He did not stop to reflect either that the Lord
might not have had much to do with the fact that he was wearing
another man's trousers, but, after all, Jamie felt that he needed
the trousers, he needed them exceedingly, and he had given his own,
which were much better looking and infinitely cleaner, in exchange
for the ones he had acquired, the looking down upon which filled
his fastidious soul with repulsion. He reflected that if he had
been in a position to see the trousers he might have risked one
more day wearing his uniform.</p>

<p>Having no idea when the Brunsons might return to their car, and
being increasingly hungry since there was money in his fingers and
he need not delude himself with the idea that he was not hungry, he
squared his shoulders and looked around to see if his particularly
sensitive nostrils could detect from which of the surrounding
places where food was being cooked exactly the most delicious
odours were emanating. That recalled him to the change he held in
his palm. He spread his right hand in line of vision and with the
forefinger of the left slowly pushed the coins around. He was so
rejoiced over his findings that he could have shouted like a small
boy. The half and the quarters made a dollar; the nickels and the
dimes and a few pennies for good measure totalled eighty-seven
cents.</p>

<p>He reflected that by judicious ordering, by making it mostly
coffee with a little toast and bacon to add back bone, he would not
be utterly at the mercy of the world for another day at least.
Since he had thanked the Lord merely for the feel of small change
in his hands, it occurred to Jamie, even in his hunger and his
desire to keep near the car, that he might ride further if
possible, that it would be a good thing once more to pay tribute.
So again he looked to the sky, and this time with a burr that might
have descended to him from the tongue of a grandfather on either
side of his house, he said, right out loud there on the sidewalk of
the California town: "It's unco gude o' you, Lord." And when his
ears heard him talking like a Scot they telegraphed the strange
proceeding to his brain and Jamie, who a few minutes before had
felt decidedly aggrieved, laughed aloud and, turning, started down
the street toward the most insistent odour of bacon and coffee that
he could detect.</p>

<p>It was while he was sitting on a high stool with his feet on a
railing before a counter that the clothing he had adopted drew
closely around him and he became aware that he was wearing a hip
pocket that contained something that from the feel of it might have
been several things; but at first shot Jamie decided that he would
guess a bill book. Then it occurred to him that it might be a good
thing, since one pocket had yielded a living for a day at least, to
go through all of them. And so he began on the outside breast
pocket of the coat in which he found a couple of cheap cigars. In
the other pockets there were some bits of string and several
buttons and a filthy handkerchief, the big revolver and a handful
of cartridges. Then he tried the inside pockets and found a couple
of letters which he decided to attend to later. Then he ran his
hand in his left pants pocket and brought it away empty. And then,
to finish the job, he reached around to the hip pocket and brought
out the bill book. It really happened to be a bill book, and it
really happened to have several bills in it, and instantly Scot
caution asserted itself in Jamie's mind. He had heard considerable
about bandits and light-fingered gentlemen and taking your
neighbour's property without his knowledge or con sent. On the mere
knowledge that there were two or three bills that might be of
reasonable denominations, he slipped the book shut and slid it back
in his pocket, and then he leaned his elbows on the counter and
thought deep and fast.</p>

<p>He was not a thief. He never had been. But he was on a great
adventure. It was becoming greater every minute. He reflected that
if his little mother, up close to the throne, had been looking down
at him and praying with all her might for his safety and his
success in his undertaking, and if the Lord had been bending her
way and listening with loving, indulging ears, Jamie thought he
could not have gotten along much better so far. Only half a day,
only a night, and through the blessing of an automobile&mdash;two
automobiles, to be exact&mdash;he was more than two hundred miles
from where he had started, and since those two hundred miles led to
the north and the west, he must be considerably nearer the sea.
Precisely why all his being had begun clamouring for the sea the
minute he had gotten to his feet and made his start, Jamie did not
know. He had not taken time to analyze himself or to try to find
out why he wanted water, worlds of water, clean, jade-green and
sky-blue and indigo-blue water, salty water, and foam, great swaths
of snowy foam. He wanted to see waves, big waves, piling up high on
a beach, and then he was obsessed with the ridiculous feeling,
probably because he missed his morning bath, that he wanted to get
in that water. Then he wanted to lie on the sand and bake in the
sun and sleep endlessly and go back to the sea water again.
Possibly it was not boiling water from an interior spring that was
needed to fit his peculiar conditions. Maybe it was cold water,
salt water, sea water that would turn the trick.</p>

<p>He was thinking so intently of the bare possibility that the sea
might do something for him that the springs had not done that he
almost forgot the odours of food around him. He could afford to
forget, since he would not be forced to abstain. He was going to
have a cup of coffee, with thick, rich cream in it, and crispy
toast and real bacon in only a minute. About the money in his
pocket&mdash;he did not know precisely what the man to whom the
breeches he was wearing belonged, owed society in general, but he
had an idea from the enterprise in which he had found him engaged,
from his talk and familiarity with the situation, that this man
might owe a fairly heavy debt. Jamie had the feeling that, since he
had captured two guns and defeated the brutes, the two of them, in
what he had heard them saying aloud in clear English that they in
tended to inflict upon a man who evidently was a very decent man
and who, through long years of economy and hard work, had amply
earned the vacation he was taking, he was entitled to the contents
of their pockets. As for the fresh young girl and her equally
wholesome and interesting mother, a wave of nausea swept Jamie's
whole being, and regardless of who might be looking, he pulled the
bill book from his hip pocket and opened it wide and emptied it,
and found in his amazed fingers exactly forty-nine dollars even, in
ones, fives, and tens. This time he was really stunned, and the
ceiling of the restaurant was so uninviting that, if he did glance
upward, even involuntarily, he forgot his thanks. He made a wild
and desperate resolve on the instant: When he had eaten the food he
had ordered, he was going to have a bath, he was going to have
clean, fresh underclothing, he was going to have trousers and a
coat that fitted and would not fill him with repulsion, and he was
going to have a hat in which he might appear at least as attractive
as it was possible for him to look.</p>

<p>He gave the ethics of the case very slight consideration. He had
frustrated the attack on the camp; he had gotten away from two men
with their artillery. He had been of sufficient benefit to William
Brunson and his wife and daughter so that they should be willing
for him to have forty-nine dollars as his reward, and from the
depth of his soul and the ceaseless grind of the wound in his left
breast he felt that the Lord would absolve him for buying clothes
that were new and clean. What was it the doctor had said? That he
was the best breeding ground imaginable for germs? One glance at
the legs of the trousers he was wearing made him feel like the
original factory in which germs had been invented. So he stuck his
long arms as far out of the coat sleeves as he could and pushed the
side lapels as far back as they would go and gulped coffee so hot
it almost scalded him and ate bacon that really was crisp and toast
that was properly browned. He paid his bill and, carrying the
wealth of a mint on his person, went back to the sidewalk and
looked for the Brunson car.</p>

<p>It was standing where he had left it, so he went over and walked
past the hotel office. He could see no sign of any of the Brunsons,
so he went to the clerk and asked to see the register. When he
found what he was looking for, he told the clerk to tell his
friends, if they came down before he returned, that he had gone to
get a shave and some fresh clothing. Some way he got a decided
feeling of uplift from the fact that he would not have to tell
William Brunson and his wife and daughter that he was whipped and
sore, a broken hulk of a man with not a penny in his pockets and
fleeing from a government with whose regulations he was not even
familiar so slight was his own prospect of release. Such a thing as
walking from the care of the Government without any notion as to
where he was going or what would happen to him had never occurred
to him, even among far-reaching possibilities, and now that he was
doing the thing, he had to admit that he did not know whether he
was a deserter or not. Certainly he could not be a deserter,
because the war had been over for so many long months. Of course,
there was some formality that probably had been gone through with
to keep him on record and in care of the Government. There was the
barest possibility that a day might come in which he would want to
ask for the official history pertaining to the decorations he
carried.</p>

<p>He left the hotel with instructions from the clerk as to where
the best outfitting store of the town could be found and bought
himself the clothing he needed to make him clean and comfortable.
Sparingly, of the cheapest things he could find that would possibly
serve his needs, he bought what he felt he required, and then he
went into a barber shop, and when his hair was cut and he was
freshly shaved, he paid for a bath, and this he followed up by a
change into his new clothes. When before a mirror in the bathroom
he tried on his new hat, he reflected that if he had red blood in
his veins and a hundred pounds of beef steak on his bones, he might
not be such a bad-looking man. Tall he would always be, and big
boned like his Scottish ancestors; his lean hands were tapering,
his features were finely cut, and his deep, blue-gray eyes at least
looked as if they might be honest eyes, kind eyes, interesting
eyes.</p>

<p>So Jamie went back to the hotel carrying a neatly wrapped bundle
which contained another man's coat and yet another man's trousers.
He meant to drop it by the wayside somewhere along his journey,
merely in case some man as sorely pressed as he had been might find
it and it might fill a need, even as his needs had been served.</p>

<p>When William Brunson walked into the office, Jamie, fortified by
neat gray trousers and a coat that really fitted him and a shirt
that was clean and fresh, arose smilingly, holding out a hand, but
instead of recognition he received a cold stare. He had to remove
his hat and work his Scottish burr before William Brunson would
accept him as his passenger of the previous day; while the wonder
with which he had gone to sleep as to whether he was leaving his
car in the possession of a third bandit for ever vanished from his
mind. There had not been even the ghost of a bandit for ten
generations in the ancestry of the man before him. On that William
Brunson would have taken oath. As he stood holding Jamie's hand, he
looked at him laughingly and said: "Well, I'll be darned! I didn't
know you, and if I stand away from you, I bet Ma and Susy won't
either!"</p>

<p>Jamie laughed in return. "I made that lightning change in the
dark last night," he said. "Moonlight is a mighty deceptive thing.
I only wanted to shed the uniform of Uncle Sam pronto, so I took
the first chance that offered, but when I woke up this morning and
found that my clothes were better fitted to walk than I was, I
decided that I'd see how quick I could change them."</p>

<p>"Come on to breakfast," said William Brunson.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I've had my breakfast," said Jamie MacFarlane. "If
you are going to be good enough to let me ride with you so long as
you are going north and west, that will be fine."</p>

<p>"There isn't any question about how long you may ride with the
Brunsons," said the husband and father of the Brunson family. "You
may ride just as long as you darn please. It doesn't make any
difference to me if it is all the way to Iowa!"</p>

<p>So Jamie picked up a morning paper and read until Mrs. Brunson
and Susy came into the office, and they really did not know him, so
he had to work the burr on them before they would believe that he
was their passenger of the previous night. Both of them quite
agreed with the judgment of their husband and father: They did not
care how long this man rode with them, and he did not care either.
So they went a considerable distance that day, with dinner by the
wayside and the night at a small hotel, and then Jamie felt that
the time had come when he must turn west. He could journey by easy
stages. He had enough change in his pockets to carry him through
food and lodging for several days, he figured, and so, throughout
the long, sunny day, plodding along, he made his way west. Then he
found he had gone too far north, so he laid his course west by
south.</p>

<p>He had no desire to go where cold would wrack his aching bones.
He wanted to stay where the sunshine was uninterrupted and
penetrant. He went slowly and sat awhile frequently and at a noon
rest when he felt that it was almost time to be thinking about
lunch, in the mottled sunshine of a live oak, with his arm on a
stone for a pillow, he fell sound asleep, and when a passing drove
of cattle finally awakened him he rose, picked up the stick he was
carrying, and stretched himself for his journey. As he did so he
missed something. He had to think a minute to recall what it could
be. It struck him that his trousers were not setting exactly as
they had when he fell asleep, and running his hands around his body
he encountered an empty hip pocket, and then an empty coat
pocket&mdash;the gun, too!</p>

<p>Almost sick with shock and disappointment, Jamie sat back on the
rock and looked around him. Lying on the ground a few yards up the
mountain-side he could see the bill book he had appropriated. There
was no use in exerting himself even to climb to it. It lay spread
open, rifled of course, and so he was once more about where he had
started. Enough remained of the nickels and dimes in his breeches
to carry him through that day and perhaps breakfast for the
morning, but the bed which he needed almost more than food had gone
as mysteriously as it had come.</p>

<p>Jamie looked more nearly Scot than he did American as he sat on
the stone, dourly frowning. Exactly why he had not put that bill
book in his breast pocket and buttoned his coat he could not
imagine. He had found it in the hip pocket, it fitted there, and he
had put it back mechanically. If he had been using his brains, he
reflected, he would have practised caution. He reflected, also,
that there must be something in the fact that a large part of the
world had lost its ancient sense of honour. There had been no
question of honour between the bandits who meant to prey on the
Brunsons. They had talked as if anything the Brunsons had might
belong legitimately to them. Jamie recalled the fact that he had
not been troubled by any particular qualms about taking what he had
found in the bandit's trousers. He spent a minute on the subject
and still remained firm in his convictions that he had acquired a
right to it, and that was why he was feeling so particularly sore
that he had not taken better care of it. When a bed meant the
question of whether he lived slightly longer or died very speedily,
and probably very painfully, why had he been so careless with that
which meant necessities and fresh bandages that he would soon be
needing?</p>

<p>After a while Jamie arose to his feet and laid out his course
still west by south. The honest hunger that had been in the pit of
his stomach an hour before was replaced by a flat nausea and he had
not gone far when he found a cold perspiration beginning to break
out in his palms, at his temples, on his body. He did not even look
up at the sky to decide whether he would voice an appeal or not. He
deliberately walked in all the sunshine he could find because, from
a taste of night out of doors, he thought he would need all the
stored warmth he could accumulate.</p>

<p>At his last resting place he took all the change from his pocket
and carefully divided it. He might reach a town where for fifty
cents at some cheapest of lodgings he could hire a bed. What
remained would have to be equally divided between supper and
breakfast. After that he was at the mercy of the world again, and
at that minute he was feeling that the world might very possibly be
quite as much against him as it was for him. The one consolation
upon which he could rest was that if a call had been sent out from
the hospital and descriptions of him had been posted, thanks to the
bandit, he was so changed that no one would feel that he was the
man who answered the descriptions that would be given. So Jamie
followed his programme until after breakfast the next morning, and
then, with only a few cents left, still headed west by south, he
stumbled on. He realized that he was almost at the limit of
endurance. Persistent walking had tired his feet and legs until
they were beginning to swell so that his shoes were feeling too
small. The sun had beaten on his unaccustomed head until he was
dizzy. His eyes were so tired that he could have cried for the
relief of dark glasses, and the price he might have paid for them
at that time yesterday was lacking when he needed it so badly
to-day.</p>

<p>Of the greater part of that day Jamie had no very clear memory
remaining. The most he knew was that he had alternated walking as
long as he could walk with dropping any place he could sit or lie
when he could go no farther. Just where he got into a road that led
him into a canyon, he did not know. He had been pushing on so
nearly in sensible to everything around him that he had not
realized that the road had narrowed to a bridle path and the bridle
path had narrowed to a footpath, and the footpath had begun to wind
around the base of one side of a mountain that in the general
upheaval of things had been split asunder from top to bottom. He
had rounded a curve and faced the panorama before him suddenly, and
at one and the same time he realized two things. He was hearing
singing water. He was hearing water that was rushing and falling
and spilling and laughing and doing all the heartening things that
water knows how to do when it is left to follow a rocky bed down a
canyon.</p>

<p>Jamie stood still and looked to the right and to the left and at
his feet. On the right he saw walls opening up that began at
ordinary range and climbed higher and higher until hundreds and
then thousands of feet had been attained. These walls had stood
through so many ages that the crevices and irregularities were
filled with live oak and holly and sage, with yucca and frosty,
blue-green cotyledon. Ferns were hanging down near places where the
high walls seeped water. On the left the same panorama of exquisite
beauty spread before him, and at his feet lay a well-defined
smoothly worn path, a path that he could see had been beaten by the
feet of countless foot passengers, and here and there his eyes,
even though over tired, could detect the hoof print of a horse: a
range rider, he thought probable.</p>

<p>The water at his feet seemed clean. It had to be cool. It was
falling over rocks. It was leaping small precipices. It was
dropping down before grottoes, fem-lined, of delicate beauty, and
trim little ouzels were darting through the spray, very likely to
nesting places that lay protected by falling water.</p>

<p>Jamie promptly sat down in the sunniest place on the warmest
rock he could find and studied the situation, and after he had
rested awhile he got down and drank from his cupped hands. Then he
dusted off his new clothing, which was getting rather rough usage,
and took up his stick and followed the footpath. It was not so
difficult to follow, because it was downhill all the way, and
before he had gone any great distance he began hearing voices. Then
he realized that a place of such exquisite beauty would attract
people, that probably campers or picnickers might be enjoying
themselves beside the water that ran so impetuously that never
before had he seen water travel in such haste. Jamie reflected that
there was a possibility that he had done the wrong thing in
discarding his uniform. From the frequency with which he had been
offered rides when he wore it, from the utter indifference with
which cars had whizzed past him hundreds of times that day even
when he had stood very close and raised his hand to ask for
passage, he figured out that a man in uni form would be given
assistance. A man in civilian clothes might be loaded with
revolvers and have a mind full of evil intentions. The day seemed
to be past when any traveller having a vacant seat would have
despised him self if he had failed to offer any one journeying on
foot the privilege of riding.</p>

<p>There was no question of riding now. Right foot for ward, then
the left, and then the right again, and oh, but they were swollen
stiff, and oh, but they ached! Just when Jamie decided that he
would take off his shoes and stockings and bathe his feet in the
cold water and see if he could not reduce the aching and the
swelling, he came face to face with a freshly painted big notice
which stated that the water before him supplied Clifton, no doubt a
town near by, that a ranger rode the canyon to protect it, and that
any one who in any way polluted the water would be promptly
arrested. So Jamie smiled dourly and looked down at his aching feet
and realized that he had better leave his shoes where they were,
since if he ever removed them there was a large possibility that he
could not induce his feet to return to their capacity.</p>

<p>At any rate, his direction was right. Each step he forced
himself to take was carrying him west and south. At first, tired
though he was, he had not been able to ignore the beauty of the
canyon through which he travelled. Within reach of his hand
Hunter's rock leek was blooming. There were ferns and mosses; there
were red larkspur and lavender, blue, and yellow lupin and the red
of pentstemon and many yellows, and one little pool filled with the
pearl-white of blooming lizard's-tail with its rank foliage, its
attractive flowers. None of these Jamie knew, for none had been
included in his study of botany in the East.</p>

<p>On and on Jamie went down the canyon. How slowly he went he did
not realize himself, but by and by he began to see people. Then he
knew that he had been right when he thought he heard voices. There
were places where smoke ascended and suddenly and joyfully Jamie
felt his problem for the remainder of that day solved. All he had
to do was to wait until the picnickers left the can yon and then he
would search where they had been and gather up the dry wood of dead
branches and twigs that they had collected or that had fallen, and
in one of the places where they had been cooking he would make a
fire so big and warm that he could spend the night in comfort. So
he sat down and waited until the sounds of the canyon had been
reduced to bird notes and falling water, running water, laughing
water, singing water. Then he began picking up everything big
enough to burn and in the crook of his left arm he stacked it as he
went along, until he had as big a load as he could carry. Presently
he found a cavern of stone in a side wall of the stream where
people had been cooking, and far back in the ashes, over which
water had been poured, he found a few living coals. So he scraped
the wet ashes away and drew the coals to the front and petted them
with tiny twigs and dried grasses, and by and by, he coaxed a
feeble flame, and this he fed until, as the sun went down and the
air grew chill, he had heat with which to comfort his aching
body.</p>

<p>Then, on one of his excursions after wood, he crossed the stream
and made his way down the right-hand bank close at the foot of the
mighty wall leaning over and frowning above him. There he came to a
small open plateau of stone and what he saw made him laugh aloud.
The picnickers who had spent a happy day there had left the remains
of their lunch. They had set it out on the rocks for the birds and
the squirrels; and the squirrels had not yet found it, and the
birds had long since gone to rest. There were several slices of
bread and butter. There was a cold tongue sandwich; there was a
hard-boiled egg and the half of a dill pickle, not to mention
crumbled pieces of cheese.</p>

<p>So the soldier of the Government, now a soldier of adventure
indeed, sat down on the big rock, still warm from the heat of the
day, and ate all the supper he wanted of very excellent food. When
he arose to go the father in him said: "Leave what remains for the
wee folks as you found it." And the mother in him said: "Take with
you every crumb that remains against the morrow. The wild things
know how to fend for themselves. You are sick and you are almost at
the limit of endurance, will need, oh, so badly! the slice of bread
for your breakfast in the morning."</p>

<p>Jamie thought that over. He had not cared particularly if he
took the bandit's breeches. He had not cared enough to keep him
from using the contents of the bill book. He had filled his stomach
to repletion with what had been left for the wild folks, and none
of the wild folks had preyed upon him or refused him anything. It
might be that in all the greenery climbing and trailing from, and
festooning the walls that shut him in there was food better to the
liking of the wild than what had been left for them. But there was
a streak of something in Jamie, the same streak that had carried
him to the woods and the forests, that had sent him uncounted miles
along the banks of the trout brooks of his boyhood, a streak of
decency and cleanliness in his soul, and that streak now said to
him: "Take your chances as the wee folk take theirs."</p>

<p>So Jamie got back on his knees and crumbled the bread and broke
the crusts. Whimsically he laid one last piece of crust on his
tongue and then he went on hunting wood. When he felt that he had
enough accumulated, he built his fire and, warm and as comfortable
as need be, he curled up before it and with his arm for a pillow
and a stone for its support, he fell sound asleep in a very few
minutes. He never felt the tiny lizards that ran over his feet; he
never saw the trade rat that sat on its haunches and surveyed him
with questioning eyes to see whether there was anything about him
that it would like to exchange for the half of a pearl button that
it carried in its left cheek. The hardness of his bed awoke him in
the night before the fire was gone, and so he piled on the
remainder of the wood and turned his cold side toward the flame and
the warm one down and went back to sleep again.</p>

<p>When morning came he washed his face and hands by wetting his
handkerchief in the stream, and after that he wet his handkerchief
several times and wrung the water over the coals he had left,
scattering them widely and obliterating every trace of fire that
could possibly spread. Then, with feet still aching in the shoes he
had not dared to remove, he started on down the canyon.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that morning he met the Ranger. The Ranger of
this particular canyon was not so lonely as were the range riders
of the mountains, but for all that he was friendly. He stopped to
talk a minute and as he casually glanced at Jamie he saw the
attenuation of his figure, he saw the whiteness of his hands, he
saw how the skin of his face settled on the lean bones, and being
young and full of life and having in his veins quite a bit of the
milk of human kindness, he said to Jamie: "My mother tells me that
if I keep in the saddle too much I will develop gout in my feet.
What do you say to taking the horse for the next few miles and
letting me exercise?"</p>

<p>Jamie said if that would be any accommodation to the Ranger he
would be glad to ride for him, but he had not figured on what the
gait of a horse would do to his left breast. Fit himself to the
saddle as easily as he could, riding was torture he could not
endure for long, and so, after a mile or two, he was forced to walk
again. But he was thankful for the offer and dimly he was beginning
to formulate in his mind the feeling that the world is made up of
good people and bad people, of selfish people and thoughtful
people, of cruel people and kind people, and it was merely a case
of luck as to which kind you met when you went on a great
adventure.</p>

<p>From the Ranger on, Jamie's adventure stretched lagging miles of
torture, still west by south, until nearly three o'clock that
afternoon. Nobody had left a lunch box and there had been no place
where the few pennies he carried would buy food. He had left the
canyon and followed a road that had widened until it would
accommodate horses and vehicles, here and there a car&mdash;not a
greatly travelled road; not a busy, well-kept road; a road that
became increasingly more difficult for Jamie to follow because his
feet had endured almost all that human feet can endure when they
are attached to a sick man who is gamely driving himself to the
ultimate limit.</p>

<p>Near four o'clock the hunger that had been in abeyance since the
night before began again to torment him. He was exhausted to the
point at which he found himself taking two or three sidewise steps
to keep from lifting his feet even a slight degree higher to step
over a small irregularity in the road. He was beginning to realize
that there was slight chance of shelter for the night. There was
equally small chance of food. So far his adventure had yielded its
bright spots, its thrills, its pains. At that minute, between the
scorching in his breast and the burning in his shoes and the
general ache all over his tortured body, he could not see much in
it. He began to wonder if he could make his way back to the
hospital and whether they would take him in, and then he thought of
the White Plague which they said had not as yet attacked him, and
so he shut his lips very tight and stood swaying on his feet as he
peered like a half-drunken man down the road before him, trying to
decide whether the wheel track on the right seemed the least bit
smoother than the wheel track on the left. When he had decided that
the one on the right was the one for him to travel, he reeled
widely and started forward, and furtively his eyes began to search
the road on either side for the spot where ultimately collapse
would come. He wondered if he stumbled and fell and could not
arise, if he lay unconscious in the middle of the road, whether any
one would find him and what they would do with him if they did.</p>

<p>It was from searching the sides of the road that Jamie missed
the point where there was a turn until he found his feet following
it, and then he looked ahead and his eyes widened and his breath
came in a light gasp. Down the road, only a few rods on the right,
he could see a small house, and of all the houses that he had ever
dreamed about and thought that he would like particularly to own
and to live in, that house appealed to him as the most
inviting.</p>

<p>It stood close to the road. A white picket fence ran along the
front of it. A neat white gate shut it from the highway. Its
painted face was soft and attractive. New England was obvious ail
over it. Flowering vines were climbing up its corners and over the
tiny front veranda. Outside the gate he could see a circle of
crushed shells and he thought the walk that led to the front door
might be made of shells. It seemed to lie very close to the road
and there was not much ground on either side of it. All that there
was seemed to be filled with the very flowers that Jamie had helped
take care of in his mother's New England garden. He could see
hollyhocks as high as the eaves of the house, and in many colours
to the left and to the right he could sense the gay hues of
nasturtiums and zinnias and marigolds, and his sensitive nostrils
could pick up the tang of heliotrope and mignonette and
forget-me-not and violets; but above everything else he had the
impression of a cloud of blue, sweet, restful blue.</p>

<p>Jamie rocked on his feet and stared at the house yearningly. His
vision carried beyond it, and he saw that on the other side of the
line fence there was another dooryard and another house, and then
houses began gathering in a friendly way on either side of the road
and leading away as far as he could see here and there were other
houses, other signs of life. At that instant there came softly to
his ears the slow, steady wash of what might possibly have been a
low tide of the sea.</p>

<p>In his exhaustion, his senses numbed with pain, he had travelled
most of the afternoon, a plodding, half-conscious thing, but now,
touched by the nearness of humanity, touched by the beauty of
somebody's home, excited with the prospect that by some possibility
he might find shelter and food, his sluggish blood surged up, his
head lifted, his dull eyes brightened slightly, and his keen
nostrils turned to the west and sniffed inquiringly. Then said
Jamie, right out loud, right from the depths of nowhere:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"'If my old nose don't tell no lies,<br>
'Pears like I smell'&mdash;</p>

<p>"what ought to be the Per-cific Ocean!"</p>

<p>He had not the faintest notion either why he called it the
<i>Per</i>-cific Ocean. He probably did it because he was so
desperately tired that if he did not manage a chuckle about
something, there was every probability that he was going to tumble
down in the road and lie still without giving his new clothes the
slightest consideration, or any other thing in all the world.</p>

<p>At that minute the screen door that led from the veranda into
the secret of the beautiful house whose whole exterior was one
delicate luring invitation, opened and there came through a man, a
tall man, a slender man, an aristocrat from head to toe, lean, and
with long silken white hair flowing back from his forehead and a
soft, short beard of silver-white wavy silk coming down on his
breast, a man with long, slender nose, big, deep-set eyes, and
white lips. He reeled as he came across the veranda, and both his
hands clutched his left side and he kept on wavering to the right
and the left until he reached the gate. Then he took his hands from
his side and clung to the gate. He leaned over it and hung on to it
and he looked up and down the road, and there he spied Jamie. He
lifted one of his hands and beckoned.</p>

<p>Jamie stood there staring at him, and then slowly and
deliberately, slapping one swollen foot and then the other on the
hard road, he took a few steps in the man's direction. He stopped
again to stare at him, to note the fine lines of the anguished old
face, the immaculate apparel, the stricken attitude of the frame
hanging across the gate. So, with all the strength that he could
muster Jamie took a few more steps and came within speaking
distance, and on his dazed and incredulous ears there fell the
strangled cry, "Help! For God's sake, lad, help me!"</p>

<p>One minute before Jamie would not have believed that he could
help anybody or anything. He had been figuring that he had reached
the end of his endurance, that if he did not have help himself in a
very few minutes he would be past the place where he would ever
need it. There was something about the whiteness of the fine old
head, something about the breadth of the shoulders and the leanness
of the frame that reminded Jamie of his father, and possibly
because he was reminded of his father, Jamie lifted his eyes above
the wonderful white house, above the lace of the trees surrounding
it, above its sheltering vines, away up to the blue, and far down
in his heart he gave an imperative order. "Now you've got to help
me, Lord! You must help me now!"</p>

<p>Then he clenched his fists very tightly at his sides and covered
the three steps more to the gate. He found the combination by which
it opened and he put his arm around the old figure leaning on it
and in a dry, breathless voice he heard himself saying: "Why, of
course I'll help you!" and he had not the faintest notion whether
he could manage three steps farther himself or not.</p>

<p>But he did accomplish the three steps farther, he pulled the
screen door open, he headed the stricken man he was trying to
support toward a big davenport and let him down on it, easing him
back against the pillows that he punched up hastily. Then on his
knees, grasping the side of the couch, he spoke again in his voice
of dry breathlessness: "What must I do?"</p>

<p>Instinctively both hands of the stricken man had sought the
region of his heart. Jamie's thought, as his mind cleared at
another man's extremity, was: "He's got it mighty near where I
have." And so he repeated again: "What must I do?"</p>

<p>The answer came: "The telephone. You must call my doctor. He
must get me to a hospital."</p>

<p>Pushing against the couch, Jamie rose to his feet and looked
around him. Then he saw a telephone on the wall and a small table
before it and an open telephone book, so he sat down on the chair
and drew a deep breath or two. Then he asked over his shoulder:
"Can you give me the number?"</p>

<p>After a paroxysm of pain that brought sweat to the white dome
above the white brows sheltering the big eyes that were pools of
darkness, there came the answer: "You will find the number and the
name on the list beside the 'phone. Doctor Grayson."</p>

<p>Jamie hunted down the line and found the name and number, and
then he put in the call, and while he waited for it he again asked
over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Whom shall I say?"</p>

<p>The gasping reply was: "The Bee Master."</p>

<p>So presently Jamie found himself insisting that Doctor Grayson
come to the telephone personally, and when he had the assurance
that Doctor Grayson was speaking, he found himself mustering
strength to say: "The Bee Master has been stricken with a very hard
attack. He wants you to come and to bring an ambulance. He wants to
be taken to the hospital immediately."</p>

<p>The answer had been: "All right. I can reach him in side of an
hour."</p>

<p>Then Jamie had cried into the telephone: "Instructions! Give me
instructions! What shall I do for him?"</p>

<p>The answer was: "Aromatic spirits of ammonia. Bathe his face and
hands. Give him a few drops. Keep him nearly upright. I will cut
the time as much as I can."</p>

<p>So Jamie went back to the davenport, and as he laid hands on the
stricken man he whispered: "Now, help, Lord!" and from somewhere he
drew strength to pull the Bee Master more nearly to a sitting
posture and to pile the pillows higher behind him. Then he began
looking around to see from what direction he might conjure aromatic
spirits of ammonia. The doctor had spoken as if the remedy might be
somewhere near and its use customary. When he could not see
anything that suggested a bottle, he ventured a question and a wave
of the hand directed him to an adjoining room where, on a table
beside a bed, there stood a bottle labelled "Aromatic spirits." So
Jamie brought it and then he stumbled to the back of the house and
in a hasty survey of the kitchen in which he found himself, he
caught up a towel. For one brief instant he glanced from the back
door, and that back door led to a porch and on over a few level
feet and then a walk started in a slope none too gentle that seemed
to lead down, and down, and down, and with a quick look Jamie
exulted softly: "My God! I've reached the sea!"</p>

<p>He caught up the towel and hurried back to soak an end of it
from the bottle and surreptitiously as he thrust it toward the sick
man, he carried it past his own face and inhaled to the depths of
his lungs. He kept very near as he managed bathing the hands and
face, and from the ammonia he drew enough strength to stand and
return to the kitchen. There he took the liberty of prying the
paper lid from a bottle of milk he had seen at the back door, and
slowly with deliberation he gulped half its con tents. That so put
heart into him that he was able to find a suitcase in the top of a
closet in a bedroom; he was able to open a chest and transfer to
the case certain papers, and to re-lock the chest and give the key
into the possession of the stricken man. Then he found an overcoat
and slippers and other small articles he was instructed to collect,
and when everything was ready, he sat with the ammonia-saturated
towel to await the ambulance. Then he heard himself being asked to
remain in the house, to take care of the bees until it was
ascertained how ill their keeper was, and when he would be able to
return to his work.</p>

<p>"I don't know the first thing about bees," protested Jamie. "I
can't take care of them. Can't you direct me to someone who can see
to your property in an intelligent way?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do," said the Bee Master. "Keep the water
pans filled. My next-door neighbour brings my food. You can sleep
in my bed. You look tired and sick yourself. I am not afraid to
trust a man having your touch, your face, your voice. Promise me
that you will take my place until my return."</p>

<p>So Jamie reached in his pocket and held out the decorations for
valour before the eyes of the stricken man. He said that he had
recently been discharged, that he had no home at present, that he
would be glad to remain in such a friendly house and do what he
could, but that he must have instructions, full instructions, as to
what he must do for the bees.</p>

<p>The Bee Master smiled a rare and illuminating smile and sank
back on the pillows as if he were content, and then he said: "Any
day the little Scout may walk in, my side partner, and you can ask
anything you want to know and you'll get an intelligent answer.
Margaret Cameron next door can tell you a good deal, and she is a
rare cook. Tell her what you like, and help yourself to my clothes
and bed."</p>

<p>Then he shut his eyes and dropped over the edge into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the ambulance came and the frame of an old
man having a face suitable for a model for the most exquisite
likeness of any patriarch of old was started on its way to a
hospital. In only a minute with the doctor who had come for him,
Jamie had secured the hospital address, and the promise of a
telephone call after an examination had been made. He had liked
Doctor Gray son, had liked the touch with which he laid his hands
on the fine old wreck on the davenport, liked the sympathetic way
in which he bent over the stricken figure, liked every tone of the
voice in which the explanation of the case had been given.</p>

<p>"The Bee Master has been putting off his evil day to the limit.
He must go to the hospital. He must remain for an operation he has
been fighting for a year or two. I hope you can arrange to settle
here, if you are the man he has selected, for several months at
least."</p>

<p>Jamie lifted a shaking hand to dry lips and iterated and
reiterated: "But I don't know a thing about bees! I don't know a
<i>damn</i> thing about bees!"</p>

<p>After the ambulance had driven away, he staggered back into the
house and straight through to the kitchen, where he finished what
remained of the milk, and that so heartened him that he stepped
through the back door and looked down the side of a small mountain
where all the world seemed alive and aglow with flowers upon
flowers of the same old-fashioned kinds that bloomed around the
front, and on either hand, down the outer line of a wide stretch
that must have covered at least two acres, there were literally
hundreds of domed white hives toward which heavily laden bees were
winging in a low humming. Then he could see a stretch of sands that
looked like silver, and then he could both see and hear the
rhythmical sweep of the Pacific at low tide.</p>

<p>He stood there until he could stand no longer, then he closed
and latched the door and went back to the davenport. He dropped on
it, worked off his shoes, pulled his coat from his shoulders, and
drew an Indian blanket over his chest, slid the pillows lower, and
then unconsciousness overtook him as it had overtaken the Bee
Master a short time before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. In the Garden of the
Bees</h2>

<p>It was afternoon of the following day before James MacFarlane
awoke, and he did not regain consciousness feeling either refreshed
or invigorated. On trying to assume a sitting posture he discovered
that he was sore through and through, that every bone in his body
ached with an ache that was nearly intolerable, and when he set his
feet on the floor and examined them carefully and then looked at
his shoes, he realized that the shoes were not going to contain the
feet for some time to come.</p>

<p>Remembering the Bee Master's offer of clothing and his bed, he
hobbled through the house until he found the bedroom, and he
uttered a thankful exclamation when he stumbled into the bathroom
adjoining. A thorough soaking in hot water with a cold shower
afterward helped considerably with the ache and the soreness. He
borrowed of underclothing he found in a chiffonier in the bedroom
to make himself comfortable, and a pair of moccasins on a shelf
were the thing for his feet.</p>

<p>Then the scent of cooked food assailed his nostrils, and as he
came into the living room, he had at the door his first vision of
Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron did not in the least resemble Jamie's mother,
but she resembled a woman who might well have been typical of a
universal mother, and exactly the right kind of a mother at that.
Her face was beautiful with a severely cut beauty that always
indicates an indomitable spirit. With one glance at Margaret
Cameron one would have been safe in arriving at the conclusion that
she would be drawn and quartered before she would renounce her
religion, her country, her political opinions, or her family. She
was tall; she carried no ounce of superfluous flesh. Her hair was
white and her eyes were blue. There was colour in her lips and
cheeks. She looked wonderful to Jamie when she smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I had a ring from Doctor Grayson this morning," she said. "He
thought you would be sleeping and he didn't want to waken you. He
told me you were to take care of things here until the Bee Master
comes back to us. I never was sorrier about anything than I was
over being away when he was stricken. A young relative of mine
needed me sorely; there was death in her family and I was forced to
go to her."</p>

<p>"I think," said Jamie, "that I found everything the Bee Master
required and I believe there was no time lost."</p>

<p>There was a hint of finality in the slight gesture in which
Margaret Cameron threw out her hands.</p>

<p>"I haven't a doubt," she said, bluntly, "but the Bee Master had
everything he needed. There is no one on earth who wouldn't do
anything Michael Worthington wanted. The point is that he was
forced to call on a stranger for help that I, as his friend of long
standing, would have loved to give."</p>

<p>"I see," said Jamie, quietly. "I am sorry you weren't here. I
think you are right about any one doing anything he asked, because
here I am, and any one less suited for what he asked of me couldn't
have been found in the State. But because he asked it, I am here to
try."</p>

<p>A dry smile crossed Margaret Cameron's face. Her eyes narrowed
as they followed a line of vision that carried through the living
room, through the combination kitchen and dining room, across the
back porch and out to unmeasured leagues of the sea
beyond&mdash;the Pacific Sea, the peaceful ocean that smiles and
lures and invites and so very seldom shows the fangs and the jaws
of the monster that lies lurking in its depths.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said, quietly. "I know why you are here and
I can see that you are not fit for work. Doctor Grayson mentioned
that you looked mighty seedy. He thought you might have been one of
ours, across."</p>

<p>Jamie ran his fingers in his pocket and produced a Service Bar
and two decorations for valour and held them toward her, and
Margaret Cameron came forward and took his unsteady white hand in
both of hers and said: "God love you, boy! I've got the Bee
Master's routine by heart myself, and while I don't know as much
about the bees as he has really been making a business of teaching
the little Scout, I know enough to show you where the water pans
are and how to keep them filled with the right combination of
water&mdash;strange, but they like a sprinkle of salt in
it&mdash;and I can go over the flowers with you and show you which
need the most water and when I think if you rest a few days, you
can make it all right, and I will cook your meals as I always have
cooked the Bee Master's. Only you might as well tell me what you
particularly like and how you want it. No two people have tastes
alike."</p>

<p>"That's mighty good of you," said Jamie. "I am ready to confess
that I am ravenous this minute and whatever you have brought will
be fine, I am sure."</p>

<p>So he went into the kitchen and ate the food that Margaret
Cameron had provided for him. He learned how to operate the gas
stove in case he wanted a hot drink at any time. He was shown where
a small ice chest stood on the back porch in which there was daily
deposited a bottle of cream and a bottle of milk, and he noticed a
basket of eggs and some fruit, and then together they went over the
garden and he located the different hose attachments and was given
exhaustive instructions about watering the flowers.</p>

<p>Noticing how very unsteady he was on his feet and how terribly
those members were swollen, seeing his thin white hands with the
blue veins standing in ridges, Margaret Cameron drew her own
conclusions. As they came up the back walk she advanced very slowly
to give Jamie time to keep up with her, and when they reached the
back door, she asked of him: "Are you bee immune?"</p>

<p>Jamie looked at her in a speculative silence for a moment,
pondering that question, and then he said: "I'm not at all sure
that I know what you mean by 'bee immune.'"</p>

<p>"Why, I mean," said Margaret Cameron, "that there are people in
this world whom bees won't tolerate. There are people to whom it
would mean certain and mighty unpleasant death to go down either
side line of this garden. There are people whom a bee naturally
hates, and there are others with whom they instantly make friends.
One man may lift the roof of a hive and scoop up a handful of
working bees. There's a man who comes to help the Bee Master
sometimes who carries bees around in the crown of his hat. But that
doesn't prove that they are a safe proposition for everyone."</p>

<p>Jamie thought that over.</p>

<p>"How do I go about finding out whether I am 'bee immune'?" he
asked, as he leaned against the casing facing the woman before him
and noting that she was almost his own height.</p>

<p>"Right there," said Margaret Cameron, "is where the little Scout
comes in. There isn't anything the Bee Master knows about bees that
he hasn't carefully passed on to his side partner&mdash;his first
assistant. I imagine you will have a visitor to-day or to-morrow.
If you don't, I will telephone. Take my advice and keep away from
the hives until you get your instructions."</p>

<p>Then Margaret Cameron gathered into a basket the dishes that
Jamie had been using, crossed the side yard, and through a small
gate entered her own premises.</p>

<p>Jamie stood and watched her going to a low white house that
seemed cheerful and homelike, that appeared as if it might have
required the same amount of labour and the same length of time to
construct, and yet, in some way, lacked the luring charm of the
home of the Bee Master.</p>

<p>Refreshed by the food, Jamie went out to the middle of the road
and stood looking at the house and grounds. There was such a slight
variation in the width of the eaves and the angle of the roof, one
could scarcely have told where lay the difference between it and
the other houses that stretched away down the street.</p>

<p>As he stood studying it, Jamie had difficulty in defining the
difference to himself. Maybe it was the setting, the whitewashed
paling fence, and the quaint sloping veranda. Maybe it was the
particular colour of paint that preserved the wood. Maybe it was
the rare vines, the odorous shrubs, the gay flowers clambering
everywhere with absolutely no hint of order or precision. Anyway,
there was something about the house shaded by tall eucalyptus trees
and lacy jacqueranda, with its gaudy surrounding carpet of blue
flower magic that gave to it, Jamie could think of no other term, a
welcoming face. It seemed to be a human thing and it seemed to
smile the warmest kind of welcome.</p>

<p>Then Jamie looked beyond it to the scintillating blue of the sea
and the equal blue of the sky, and then he looked higher. He stood
there thinking intently, and before he realized what he was doing,
he had repeated a phrase in his father's tongue that he had used a
few days before: "You are unco gude to me, Lord!"</p>

<p>Then Jamie smiled through misty eyes at the house, and he went
into it, carefully noting the side seats and the delicate vines
trained over the veranda. He looked at the rugs on the floors and
decided that they were Persians of antiquity and price. He was
unschooled in rug lore. He knew that the furniture was antique and
priceless. He ran his fingers appreciatively over pieces of
rosewood and mahogany that were old and shining from use and that
had been designed by master craftsmen long ago, across far
seas.</p>

<p>The bookcases, ranging from floor to ceiling almost around the
room, held his attention for a few moments, and then he stopped
before a writing desk, open, the quill of the Master in the small
horn holder of shot, the sheets of an unfinished letter lying on
the pad. With that fineness inherent in the heart of a gentleman of
Scotland, Jamie picked up the sheets, lifted the pad, laid them
face down on the mahogany of the writing desk and re turned the pad
to its place. The letter would lie there untouched until the return
of the Bee Master.</p>

<p>Then Jamie's eyes wandered to the case above the writing desk.
He had been reading names prominent in literature from the
beginning, but each volume in that small case seemed to be either
completely concerning or in some way related to bees. At one
instant Jamie's hand lifted to open one of the doors. Probably its
weight roused him to the fact that he had better rest a few more
days before he began on a task that might he over quickly or might
be long. In detail he went through the adjoining sleeping room,
noting its neatness, the precision of its arrangement, the delicate
beauty of the etchings and engravings, the rareness of the books
that lay here and there, the quiet grace of the furnishings.</p>

<p>He went back through the kitchen and the back porch and came out
into the open shine of the afternoon sun. He was thin enough and
cold enough to love its warmth.</p>

<p>As he stood there looking down the stretch of the garden to the
sea, he thought it comprised the most beautiful picture that he had
ever seen. It covered two acres of the Sierra Madres where they
meet the Pacific. A crude walk, fashioned from stones collected
from the mountain-side, ran in steps down to the beach below. There
was a pergola loaded with grapes as they are allowed to run in the
gardens of the East but lavishly among them grew wisteria and
clematis, roses and vines and vines whose names, habits, or
flowering, he did not know. On either hand, sometimes with abrupt
juttings of big rocks, sometimes in tiny fertile plateaus,
sometimes on gentle slopes, there grew every fruit tree that loves
to flourish in the soil and sun of California loquats and figs,
oranges and lemons, plums and peaches, pears and nectarines, dates
and grapefruit&mdash;only a tree or two of each, and between and
beneath them tiny cultivated beds of vegetables.</p>

<p>Prominently bordering the walk halfway down the mountain-side,
staked and rankly growing, Jamie's eye was caught by a blare of
purple-red where stalks of tomatoes lifted huge fruits, some of
them bursting with ripeness, and on either hand everywhere, bushes,
shrubs,4 vines and flowers, and flowers, and yet more flowers, and
be cause Jamie recognized nearly each one of these, he knew they
were the quaint, old-fashioned flowers that his mother and his
grandmother had grown. There were Madonna lilies that, in the warm
soil and the luring sun shine, had opened to bloom at two and three
feet less height than in the cold gardens of the East. Carpeting
around them were beds of cinnamon pinks, touching the fresh salt
air with their spicy sweetness, mignonette and heliotrope,
forget-me-nots and great blue blooms of myrtle the like of which
Jamie never had seen&mdash;a whole world of flowers and fruit.</p>

<p>On either hand, steadily, slowly, came the low hum of millions
of working bees&mdash;bees hived, not in the ugly flat houses used
in numberless apiaries he had passed on his journey, but each stand
in a separate spot raised above the earth on a low platform and
having a round pointed roof that gave to the hives a beauty, a
quaintness, an appropriateness to the location. On close
examination Jamie found that each hive stood in a bed of myrtle
blue as the sky. And then he saw that back of the hives the fences
were a wall of the blue of plumbago, delicate sheets of it. And
above, one after another, great lacy jacquerandas lifting clouds of
blue to the heavens. And then he realized that, facing the hives,
around and near them, there was a world of blue: blue violets,
heliotrope, forget-me-nots, blue verbenas, blue lilies, larkspur,
bluebells, phlox, blue vervain, blue and yet more blue. Past his
head and face, lured by the reds and brilliant colours around the
house, darted the jewel-throated and crowned humming birds, but the
bees lived in a whole world of blue. It seemed as if the blue
flowers dearly loved to creep up to these white hives, to vine
around them, to cling to them, to bloom above them. Alone, close to
the back walk, Jamie noticed several big hives that stood by
themselves where he would have to pass within the distance of a few
feet when he made his first journey the length of the garden, out
of the gate and across the strip of sand to where the ocean, in a
great bay, came lapping up the shore and then slid back again,
gently, softly, with only a low murmur song that would be the
finest thing in the world to lull a tired man to sleep.</p>

<p>Slowly, with wavering feet, Jamie made his way across the back
end of the house. Under a jacqueranda tree on the east side, he saw
the most attractive bench. So he went and sat upon it at just the
precise spot where the branches of the tree threw a mottled shade
over his head and left his lean body stretched in the sunshine. He
sat and tried to think. Because the sky was so beautiful, and the
sea was so beautiful, and the garden was so pain fully beautiful,
there came to him the old thought he had dragged around for the
past two years: How much longer? How much time had he, anyway? How
soon was the sky going to lose her eternal verity and the sea to
cease smiling, and flower faces and bird song and the hum of the
bee and the chirp of the cricket&mdash;how soon were they to be
over for him?</p>

<p>Because he had tried himself so sorely, because he was so
desperately strained and over-tired from his journey, he was not
very hopeful. Everything concerning himself looked the blackest it
ever had. The bandages that he had removed for his bath bore
brilliant stains, telling anew the story of angry wounds that
refused to heal. So that afternoon Jamie's individual case seemed
more hopeless to him than it had seemed when he had arisen in hot
rebellion and walked out from the protection of his government. But
the irony of the whole thing was that, when for him self matters
could scarcely have been blacker, all inadvertently he had fallen
into one of the most exquisite beauty spots that the face of the
world had to boast.</p>

<p>There are only a few places where love and artisanship build a
small house with a welcoming face. There are only a few places
where love and good horse sense build a garden, half of wildings
and half of quaint old-fashioned things that evolved without the
help of crossing and fertilization and other makeshifts that
produce growth so rampant and sizable that it is difficult to
believe that the blooms are living things. There are only a few
places where the side of a mountain walks down, and slides down,
and jumps down, and meanders winding, flowering ways until it
reaches the white sands of a brilliantly blue sea, and it is easy
to believe that such a location would naturally be the home of tiny
round white houses with round roofs where millions of bees make
honey to sweeten the food of a world.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the hum of the bees and the scent of the
flowers would draw the birds to a place like this, and across any
stretch of ocean shore line there is bound to be the wide sweep of
great gray pelicans and the black-winged anhingas, and the wild
ducks, the snow-white of the gulls and the scimitar-winged sea
swallows, like birds of carved ivory, arching and sailing for pure
love of blue sky and blue water and to indulge the powers of
flight. There are bound to be Mother Carey's chickens and little
stilt-legged sandpipers and killdeers tilting along the shore, and
there are sure to be little children digging in the sand, and grown
folk having an hour of pleasure stretched in the sunshine, asking
earth to heal their bodies and the Sun God to heal their
hearts.</p>

<p>As Jamie sat on the bench under the jacqueranda feeling so ill
that the tears of self-pity were stinging the lids of his wide gray
eyes, he vaguely wondered what it would do to him if he were to go
down to the sea and soak his body in the cold salt water and let
the sun drive home every medicinal property that sea water
contains. He had tried a year of hot water from the boiling bowels
of the earth. How would it do to try a year of cold water from the
seas of the surface and the sun of the heavens?</p>

<p>Jamie's lips twisted bitterly. He was probably as near Heaven as
he ever would be until Heaven passed him by, and it might be that
only a few days would end his tenure of the little white house and
the mountain garden, and it would be his lot to move on until his
case grew even more desperate than it was at that minute.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. The Little Scout</h2>

<p>The following day, as Jamie sat on the same bench, his mind
occupied with the same subject, in a wide flare between earth and
sky, a slender bit of a child sailed over the fence and landed
expertly on the sanded walk of the garden. As the small figure
righted itself one hand caught the band of a pair of particularly
dirty breeches and the other stuffed more securely therein the tail
of a not overly clean shirt. Standing on one foot, the youngster
removed a canvas shoe from the other, shook the sand from it, and
replaced the shoe on a bare foot. The child drew a deep breath and
stood still an instant with a wandering gaze roving over the
garden.</p>

<p>In that pause Jamie took mental account of the lean, flat
figure. One trouser leg was fastened at the knee. The other had
lost its fastening and hung halfway down the ankle with a loose
strap and a flopping buckle. The sleeves of the green khaki shirt
were cut off at the elbows and one of them was ripped lengthwise to
the shoulder. Hands and arms and legs as well bore the traces of
climbing and rough exercise. The little face was rather flat; the
nose a faint pug; the mouth wide. The eyes seemed not overly large.
At that distance Jamie could not decide what colour they were. The
hair might have been brown if it had not been bleached by
California suns until the outer layer was a flaxen tan; where it
fell apart darker streaks appeared. It was cut evenly in a circle
from ear lobe to ear lobe and across the forehead in a bang.
"Dutch" Jamie supposed, and as he sat watching, the child with a
movement exquisitely deft and graceful, began to pirouette, to
dance in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Sometimes with arms curved above the head until the tips of the
fingers touched, sometimes with the right arm extended and lifted
and the left trailing behind like a flying Mercury, up and down the
walk went the small figure, whirling, reaching as if snatching
butterflies from the air, dancing all alone there in the
mid-afternoon under the California sun. Then, tiring, a sudden
change from the dance to a walk started the youngster straight
toward Jamie. Halfway between lay the Madonna lily bed. Opposite it
the child paused, bent forward, and peered at the lily faces, and
then Jamie's eyes widened and a queer, incredulous grin crossed his
face. What he was seeing was a very small person on bended knees,
elbows akimbo, hands at the sides, in a half-crouching attitude,
with eyes rolled heavenward, ecstatically sucking, one after
another, the pistils of the Madonna lilies!</p>

<p>Jamie's grin widened to a chuckle when once he noticed that a
pistil overflowing honey had dripped a drop on a petal and the
child supported the under side of the petal and licked away the
drop with an appreciative tongue and then arose and came slouching
down the walk until Jamie drew back his toes because they happened
to be particularly sore and tender and he did not want them stepped
on.</p>

<p>The youngster stopped and looked at Jamie, from the crown of his
tired, sick head to the soles of his very badly swollen feet, and
an expression of wonderment crossed the small face, but there was
not the slightest sign of fear and there was no backward movement.
Ground attained was firmly held.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello!" said the child.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Jamie, as cordially as he could say it in a voice
that had so recently been roughened with the emotion of
self-pity.</p>

<p>"<i>Where's</i> the Bee Master?" asked the small person.</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated. He was near enough now to look to the depths of
the eyes trained on him, and it struck him that they had more
depth, more expression, more comprehension, than any pair of eyes
that he had ever seen on a person of anywhere near that age. There
were things lying away back in the depths of the brownish grey eyes
meeting his that awoke Jamie to caution.</p>

<p>"He went away for a few days and left me in charge," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Oh! But we don't know you," objected the small person.</p>

<p>"But I'm here," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"So you are," said the small person, "and you prodibly wouldn't
be here if the Bee Master hadn't said you might, and whatever he
<i>says, goes</i>!"</p>

<p>With that "goes" both hands were spread out on a level with the
belt line and given an emphatic downward and outward sweep that
seemed to cover long distances with perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think I'll do," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to think anything," said the small person.
"I am no acrobat in my head. I can't think quick. If the Bee Master
told you to come here and stay here, you've got to come and you've
got to stay and you've got to do. That's all there is to that. I'm
the Bee Master's side partner. Look me over, Kid! It ain't
expensive!"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled, and when Jamie smiled, which was not any too
frequent an occurrence, there were tiny dancing flecks of light in
his eyes and a stretching of the skin over his lean face and a
twitching of his lips that made an appeal that had not as yet
failed in its effect. The child advanced a step and laid a hand on
Jamie's arm while an impish grin overspread the small features. The
inquiry was shot at him suddenly.</p>

<p>"Did you see me pirouette?"</p>

<p>Jamie nodded.</p>

<p>"Did I pull it off pretty well?"</p>

<p>"I thought you did famously," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"We got to do that darn stuff in school," said the small person.
"It's the bunk! But when I get off where I think I'm alone, I
practise it. I think I can do it better to the bee music and to the
waves than any other kind. It's sure goofy! I wish you could see
Fat Ole Bill pirouette! But if your school makes you do it, you
might just as well keep everlastingly at it until you do it a
little bit better than the other fellow."</p>

<p>"That's sound logic," said Jamie. "If you start out with that
kind of an idea in your head and keep 'everlastingly at it,' there
isn't any place you can land except at the top of the heap."</p>

<p>"That's the way I've got it figured," said the small person,
casually. "And I've learned while only just as wide and just as
high as I am this minute, that I can't be Scout Master and Chief of
the Robbers' Den and First Assistant to the Bee Master unless I hoe
it down."</p>

<p>Jamie decided that the little figure before him was surely a
boy.</p>

<p>There was a slight drawing closer, a lowering of the voice, and
the small person asked confidentially: "When did they take him to
the hospital?"</p>

<p>Jamie drew back and looked inquiringly at the child.</p>

<p>"I didn't say any one was taken to the hospital," he
protested.</p>

<p>"No. You didn't," conceded the small person. "But if you had
known the Bee Master as well as I've known him, in all the time
we've been partners, which is ever since I've been big enough to
climb the fence, you'd know that there wasn't any <i>place</i> they
could take him away from this garden <i>except</i> to the hospital,
and you'd know there wasn't any <i>way</i> they could take him
except flat on his back."</p>

<p>"I suspect that's about the truth," said Jamie.</p>

<p>The youngster, in an instant gesture, threw out wide arms with
spread fingers and nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>"That's just edsactly the truth, because he has needed to go for
months and months and Doctor Grayson's told him to go, and coaxed
him to go, and tried to make him go, and none of them could make
him. He thought he'd do anything in the world for me. He
<i>said</i> he would. So when I saw that he wasn't going to go, and
couldn't be made to go&mdash;" there was a sudden straightening of
the small figure and a squaring of the shoulders&mdash;"I didn't
tell him to go to the hospital. I told him to stay at home and do
what he felt like," and here the youngster chuckled, "'cause I knew
darn well that was what he was goin' to do anyway, and I didn't
want to spoil my record! When you got a position to hold you might
as well look a little to keeping up your fences."</p>

<p>There was no reason that Jamie could see as to why he should not
laugh, and anyway, he had done it before he knew it was coming. But
it did not disconcert the small person; not a particle.</p>

<p>"<i>When</i> will they operate?"</p>

<p>The question upset Jamie. He slowly shook his head. "I don't
even know what his trouble is," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said the child. "I guess it's the only thing on
earth that really hurt his heart that he didn't tell me about. He
told me about all the things that hurt him and drove him from his
home in the East, and about the little girl with gold hair that he
had to give up in such a horrid way, and I've been all through the
big carved mahogany chest and straightened all the papers and seen
all the pictures in it. I know about how he loved Mary, and I know
about the home he lost. I even know the secret that broke his
heart, and I know all he can teach me about the bees."</p>

<p>The small person paused and dropped into a voice of absolute
business impartiality.</p>

<p>"About bees, now. There's so much to learn that the men who
write the books haven't found it all out yet, so, of course, the
Bee Master couldn't teach it all to me. But I know all he could
show me about the hives and about the bee bread and foul brood and
about queens and nymphs and workers and drones and nurses. That
about nurses is the sky-blue limit! You wouldn't hardly believe
that a hive of bees would have nurses, now would you?"</p>

<p>Thinking of recent experiences, Jamie said slowly: "Nurses are
among the most wonderful things in the world, and I have heard that
bees are very wonderful, so I think it's probable that they do have
nurses."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Pat!" said the small person. "I can take you to
any of these hives and open them up and show you maybe as many as
forty thousand nurses taking care of the white nymphs."</p>

<p>And then, for the second time, Jamie faced the question: "Are
you bee immune?"</p>

<p>And again Jamie answered: "I don't know. I've had no
experience."</p>

<p>The small person chuckled appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Neither had I&mdash;until I got it. After I had stuck around
from the first time I ever saw his white head and away back into
his eyes until he said I might be his partner and help him with the
bees, <i>I</i> hadn't had any experience, so I went back one
morning, down along the east side over there, to see whether I was
bee immune, and we always thought afterward that I made a mistake.
My <i>scent</i> wasn't right."</p>

<p>Jamie bit his lip and swallowed hard because, as a matter of
fact, the young person before him smelled more strongly of horse
than of anything else, while dog ran a close second, and mingled
with the odours of horse and dog there was a strong hint of Madonna
lilies and onions. The combination played on Jamie's delicate sense
of smell in a peculiar way. It was not so long since his eyes had
been smarting with self-pity, yet at that particular minute he
wanted to whoop. And there was no good reason at all why he should
not. Without in the least understanding his mental processes, the
small person proceeded gravely.</p>

<p>"My scent wasn't <i>right</i>. You know, a bee has got smell
hollows instead of a nose. They are in two little tubes that stick
out where a nose would be if it wasn't on a bee, and each one of
the worker bees (which are the ones that do the business around a
hive) each one of the worker bees has got five thousand smell
hollows. And a worker isn't a patchen to a male. A male's got
thirty-seven thousand eight hundred smell hollows, so he'll be sure
not to miss the scent of the Queen when he goes out to love her up.
So, if a male came near me, a fat chance I had, all gummed up with
horse and dog. That was the whole trouble&mdash;my scent wasn't
right. The Bee Master said it was too aggressive. I had been riding
Queen and playing with Mom's dog and when I get into a scuffle with
Chum, half the time he's on top and half the time I am, and I was
all smeared up with dog and horse and things like that, things a
bee doesn't <i>like</i>. The Bee Master always said if he had used
any judgment himself, it wouldn't have happened. He always felt bad
about it, but I didn't mind so much. It's a pretty good thing to
know just edsactly what you are getting into and then, if you think
you can stand it, why, most likely you can. Anyway, I said I would
go down before the hives in the east row the way the Bee Master
went to fill the watering pans and to watch that there wasn't any
robbing going on and to see if the queens were all happy and laying
a few million eggs or so, and I went meandering along, and first
thing I knew, out came a big working bee zoomin' right above my
head, and behind it came two or three more, and they were between
me and the Master, and I didn't want to cut through his flowers
he's just about as particular as anybody God ever made about
flowers&mdash;and I didn't know edsactly how to get my chance to
dust the home plate, 'cause I had only two eyes and each one of
them had maybe six thousand on each side of its head.</p>

<p>"Then the Bee Master yells at me and he says: 'Zigzag!' And that
was all right if he had a-said it in Spanish or French or
something, but there wasn't any use in talking English before his
bees, because they understood him just as well as I did! I tried
hard enough to do what he told me, but whenever I'd zig, the darn
bee would zig, too; and whenever I'd leap to one side and try to
zag, the bee had zagged just a little bit before I had, and just
naturally, workin' it that way, we interfered. Say, did a Black
German ever zip you?"</p>

<p>Jamie's face went black for an instant, and then he looked at
the eager little face in front of him and let the instant pass as
he said, quietly, "Not with the stinger of a bee. No. But I've had
a few experiences with wasps and hornets out in the fields and
woods when I was a boy. I get the general idea."</p>

<p>"I hardly think you do," said the small person. "I hardly think
there's anything, in the stinging profession, wearing six legs,
that's got quite such a sharp, long, ready-to-use stinger as a
Black German bee. By gravy! they can ping you to the liver, and
when about three of 'em takes you on the back of your neck and
around the ears and into your arm muscles, oh, boy!"</p>

<p>Both hands clenched and then unclenched and were thrown outward
in a wide-spreading sweep.</p>

<p>"When I got back to the Bee Master, I was shaking like I had a
chill and I bet enough salt water was running down my face to make
a good soup spoon full of salt. Because the Bee Master says every
bucket of water you take from the ocean is three and a half per
cent, salt, but I bet two bits I'm saltier 'an that. If I'd a-died
I couldn't a-kept my salt water back. The Master said it was
rotten, and he held me tight and rubbed off the stingers, 'cause
that's the way you must; if you pull 'em it makes them worse. And
then he turned the hose on a clayey place and mixed a cool poultice
of mud and spread on the stings, and he said he ought to be booted
for lettin' me go 'mong the bees when I was all smelly of dogs and
horses.</p>

<p>"So I wiped up my eyes and I said I reckoned that was the
trouble. What I ought to a-done was to put on his old bee coat and
rubbed some lilies on my head and some cinnamon pinks on my
britches. So I went to the back porch and got his coat and when I
commenced putting it on, he asked me what I was going to do. And I
told him I was going to get my scent right and 'try, try again.' He
just sat there looking at me, and I never saw his eyes get so big
and black and I never saw his face get whiter when the pain was
hurting him the worst, and away back under his breath, so I could
barely hear, he whispered, 'Before God, you wouldn't do it, little
Scout?'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'God ain't got nothin' to do with this. It's
between you and me, and I'm <i>going!</i>'</p>

<p>"And so I buttoned up the coat and I went down to the cinnamon
pink bed and I just about rolled in it. I don't know but I treated
the pinks rougher than the Master liked, but you'll understand if
you ever get stung by a Black German why I was anxious to get
plenty of cinnamon on. And then I smashed the sweetest lily I could
find and I rubbed it in all over my hair. And then I started down
the east walk. I thought I'd try the Italian bees first. They're a
lot decenter than the Germans. I ain't much of a whistler, but I
whistled 'Highland Mary' the best I could, and I went along, soft
and easy, and I ain't right sure but I carried the last lily in my
hands, and keeping serene&mdash;around bees you just naturally got
to keep serene; no rough stuff goes, but I wasn't oozin' certainty
so's you could notice it&mdash;I stopped by the door of every last
Italian and they never done a thing to me. So the Master <i>was</i>
right. I took my medicine because my scent was wrong. So I rubbed
up the lily a little when I headed for the Black Germans and I went
and stood in front of them and counted ten. Then I double dared 'em
to come on and sting me. They sort of fussed around a little and
two of 'em came pretty close, but when they got the flowers strong,
they went away again. Any way, I faced 'em down. And when I went
back to the Bee Master, he took me up in his arms and he said he
wished to God he'd lived to see the day when his little Mary
would've showed spirit like that, and he hugged me so tight he
nearly cracked every bone in my body, and he gave me the first kiss
I ever got off him. And I ain't had half a dozen since. Believe you
me, he's no necker! And he said that I could be his partner and
help him about keeping the bees. Let me tell you, you'll get on
your uppers and you'll do something worth while, you'll stir your
think-tank posolutely to the bottom, before the Bee Master comes
across! His coat's hanging on the back porch and there's flowers
a-plenty here in the garden. Any time you want to find out how the
bees feel about your soul, you can soon get it over with, includin'
war tax. But, oh, boy! lemme tell you <i>this!</i> Before you go
near the hives of the Black Germans, get your <i>scent</i>
right!"</p>

<p>"But how do I get my scent right?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, I'll show you the right coat. Put that on
and then go and stick your head in the cinnamon pinks and rub it
all around like I did, and then take a Madonna lily and smash it
and rub it all over your hands, and maybe you better go down by the
water tap where there is a little spongy place and pull a handful
of mint and rub that all over your britches. Whatever you do, don't
<i>weaken!</i> You better whistle the right tune. Can you whistle,
slow and easy, 'Highland Mary'? That's the one the bees like best.
<i>Her</i> name was Mary. And if you can whistle it real soft and
easy, and lots of love, and lots of coaxin', and lots of
lonesomeness, if you can work it up just right&mdash;you are about
his height&mdash;the bees might not know the difference. Yes, I
guess they would, too. You prodibly never heard of such eyes as
bees have got. A worker after you has got six thousand eyes on each
side of its head, and a male&mdash;'cause on account of the Queen
again, when she flies clear nearly to Heaven, way above the birds
and everything&mdash;a male has got thirteen thou sand eyes on each
side of its head. So you better believe, if one got roused up about
you, he'd see that your head wasn't white. All the bees would miss
the Bee Master's white head. It was always bare. And they'd miss
his beard and his big, dark eyes. Ain't he wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have an idea, from the few minutes I saw him and from
his home and his library and his profession, yes, I've an idea that
he is rather wonderful."</p>

<p>"He's just the only wonder of his kind," said the small person
with the wide-spread downward gesture that was becoming familiar to
Jamie.</p>

<p>Then the question came abruptly: "Was he <i>awful</i> sick?"</p>

<p>Jamie looked into the wide eyes of comprehension before him and
thought of neither lie nor evasion.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "He was the sickest man I ever saw, and I've
certainly seen some sick ones!"</p>

<p>"You can't tell me much about him," said the small person. "I've
helped him up the back walk and to the davenport and gotten the
ammonia a few times when I didn't ever think I'd pull him through.
I've seen him suffer until the sweat would run right down and drop
off the tip of his nose, just a drop at a time, slow, and fall on
his shirt front, splat! splat!&mdash;and I'll tell the world, it's
pretty awful! If he's sick like that again, maybe he'd better go on
and die."</p>

<p>At the casual tone in which the suggestion was uttered, Jamie
reeled back on the seat and stared hard at the impersonal face of
the youngster before him. He had been under the impression that
this child adored the Bee Master. At that minute he felt that he
was facing a little pagan who did not adore anything, or even have
a fair conception of what the word might mean. Yet there had been
considerable conception of what the word might mean in the
instructions as to how he was to whistle "Highland Mary," so Jamie,
through narrowed eyes, looked steadily at the little Scout and then
he said tentatively: "I thought you <i>liked</i> him."</p>

<p>"Liked him?" said the little Scout. "Say, look here!"</p>

<p>Before Jamie's eyes was thrust a grimy right hand. Smash down
like the blade of a knife came the left across the wrist. Slowly
the fingers of the right hand opened and closed.</p>

<p>"I need <i>that</i> in my business," said the little Scout. "I
couldn't ride Queen; I couldn't be leader of the Scouts; I couldn't
paddle my canoe; I couldn't be the Bee Master's partner without it,
but if it would take that pain out of the Bee Master's side, I'd
give it to him, just like <i>that!</i>"</p>

<p>The right hand was severed and discarded in mighty effective
pantomime.</p>

<p>A great big lump rose up in Jamie's throat, threatening very
nearly to choke him.</p>

<p>The small person stood on one foot and set the other on the
bench and clasped a pair of grimy hands around the bended knee and
leaned toward Jamie.</p>

<p>"I guess you got me wrong," was the surmise that fell on his
astounded ears. Then suddenly that position was relinquished and
Jamie felt a small body beside him and a small head leaning
precariously near the wound that made red stains on his breast, and
one little abused hand lay down on one of his hands, and a small
face was lifted to his, and a voice, low and mellow and exceedingly
sweet of tone, said to Jamie, softly: "Do you know how beautiful
dying can be?"</p>

<p>Perhaps that hit Jamie the hardest of all, because he had not
been contemplating Death as a beautiful thing, and he had been
contemplating it day and night for other men for more years than he
liked to enumerate. In his own case, two was plenty. He could not
speak, so he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Just like me," said the small person. "I didn't know anything
at all about it, but Nannette did. Nannette's my big sister. She
had the rottenest luck. At the lake where we went last summer, a
man got drowned and next day Nannette was playing along the shore
with some other kids and ran right into him just as they got him
out of the water, and he had been in long a-plenty and the turtles
hadn't done a thing to him. And she came home and Mother said she
had the hysterics, and she kept on havin' 'em in the night in her
sleep 'til I got so I saw about what she'd seen. So not long ago,
my mother's little old Aunt Beth went to Heaven and first Mother
said we couldn't go and say good-bye to her. She went in the night,
you know, in her sleep, with her hands folded on her breast and the
strangest little mysterious smile on her face. It was like she knew
a beautiful secret that she'd love to tell, and she was smilin'
over it while she decided whether she would tell or not. Dad said
maybe it'd be a good thing to let us go. Maybe Nannette would see
something that would make her feel better. Nannette didn't want to
go, but after Dad said that, Mother made her. So we went after
dinner when we had come home from school. Mother washed us up and
put on our Sunday clothes and Dad took us in the car, and right at
the front door the beautiful part started.</p>

<p>"There was a big wreath that nearly covered the door and it
began in little blue forget-me-nots and violets and heliotrope, and
it ran into white hyacinths and gold hyacinths and blue ones, and
there were sprays of lavender heather and white roses and pale pink
roses, and at the bottom where it was tied with lavender chiffon
that hung clear to the porch floor, the loveliest white lilies. I
never saw anything that was so beautiful."</p>

<p>The small face lifted to Jamie's.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything as lovely as that?" he was asked.</p>

<p>Jamie shook his head.</p>

<p>"In the living room, where, ever since I'd known her, Aunt Beth
had sat in a wheel chair, it was just flowers everywhere. All our
family sent them, and all the neighbours sent them, and her church
sent them, and people we'd <i>never heard</i> of sent them, because
everybody loved Aunt Beth. Mother said she was the biggest little
liar in the whole world. Days when you could see she was twisty
with pain, she'd look you straight in the eye and say she was
better. She was always better. And she had the funniest house. You
never went to it that from some where she couldn't pull out a cooky
with candy on it, or red peppermint sticks, and she always had the
best raisins. My! you never tasted such raisins as she always had!
Or sometimes popcorn, or doughnuts, and the last time I had been
there, the spiciest gingerbread&mdash;it smelled like the geography
of India sounds!</p>

<p>"We went back into Aunt Beth's bedroom, and over her bed there
was a lavender satin spread, and she was lying upon her pillow and
her hair was soft and wavy&mdash;she had a big roll of hair and it
was bright brown. She was eighty-seven and you couldn't hardly find
a gray hair on her head. It was in soft, silky coils and it waved
so pretty.</p>

<p>"And Death had gone and magicked her. There wasn't a line in her
face, and her throat was round, and her lips were smiley. My! she
was the prettiest thing! And her dress was like it was cut from
soft gray clouds and the sleeves and down the front was all
cobwebby lace, and at her wrists it tied in perky little bows.</p>

<p>"Nannette stood and looked at her and she kept creepin' closer
to her and she looked and she looked and then she grabbed me and
she said, 'Why, I thought she'd be like the man I saw!'</p>

<p>"And then Dad and all of us found out for the first time that
Nannette thought <i>all</i> the dead people everywhere looked like
the man that had been in the water among the turtles and
everything; and I'll tell you, we were glad then that we'd brought
Nannette to see Aunt Beth! She was so pretty&mdash;Nannette wanted
to untie the ribbons in her sleeves and fix 'em the way she wanted
'em, and that made me want to do something for her, and so I asked
what I might do, and they said that I might put her slippers on
her. They turned back the lacy spread with the lavender lining that
covered her and I got to put on her feet her little gray slippers
with white fur on 'em. They were the prettiest little things! And
then I fixed her skirts, her gray satin petty and her lacy dress;
and Nannette fixed her sleeves and we covered her up and kissed her
good-bye, and we came away, and you can't scare <i>us</i> with
being dead any more!</p>

<p>"Nannette hasn't jumped in the night since, not once. We know
now that there are several kinds of being dead. There's the kind
where you've had a bad heart and you haven't told true and you've
taken things that didn't belong to you, and you haven't played the
game square with God, and you haven't had any respect for your
government, and, of course, you ain't goin' to look very well
whether you're dead or alive if you've got things like that inside
you. And then, added to that, there's accidents that might happen
to anybody&mdash;lyin' in the water a long time and turtles is one
thing, or bein' burned in a fire or blown up in a factory. That's
your hard luck. But if you get to die at home, just to go to sleep
softly in your own bed in the night, so softly that you never lift
your hands off your breast, and when you see God a little sweet
smile creeps over your face&mdash;Gee! I bet God and all the angels
were tickled to pieces to see Aunt Beth when she came walkin' in,
all slender and straight and young in her softy cloud dress!
Nannette put forget-me-nots and Parma violets and heliotrope in her
hands when she got her sleeves tied right. If she still carried
them when she got to Heaven, all around her would be smelly with
flowers. None of us <i>wanted</i> her to go. We all liked to take
care of her. We all liked to take her fruits and flowers and books
and papers. Every one of us saved every funny story we found to
tell her, but at that we were all kind of <i>glad</i> when she
went, 'cause her bones must have hurt her, and she couldn't have
told true when she always said she was better, because she
<i>had</i> to give up and have the doctor sometimes, bad as she
hated it."</p>

<p>The little Scout stood up with outflung hands in a gesture of
finality.</p>

<p>"After I've told you <i>that</i>, you can see how the Bee Master
might look if God decided that he should go to sleep in the night,
and there wouldn't be any more pain in his side or any more sweat
drippin' off his nose. I bet all the harps and all the trumpets in
Heaven would go 'Zoom! Zoom!' and all the angels would come
flocking if the Bee Master went through the gates! I bet God Him
self would stand up when the Bee Master came up so straight and
tall to salute Him, because sometimes, some where he'd been in a
war. He's got a bully uniform and he can pull off the snappiest
salutes! He's been a soldier and I bet you've been a soldier, too,
'cause you look like a soldier and you move like a soldier, and I
think it's punk that you ain't got your uniform on. I just love
uniforms!"</p>

<p>And then Jamie's mouth fell open and his eyes widened. A
cautioning hand was thrust backward toward him. A sibilant hiss
that was intended for a warning to silence struck his ears. Inning
forward, softly, a step at a time, one hand thrust outward for
balance, one thrust back for caution, the little Scout crept in a
crouching attitude down the walk, eyes fixed straight ahead.
Leaning over to get the alignment, Jamie saw a big bumble bee
clambering over the entrance petal to the horn of a trumpet flower.
He saw the little Scout measure off a certain distance, crouch, and
then quick, quicker almost than he could sense what was happening,
a stream of saliva shot straight and hit the bee, knocking it off
its moorings. The little Scout sprang into the air and uttered a
whoop that would have startled an Apache on the war path. Wildly
whirling and shouting, with beating hands, the child, in a shrill,
boyish voice, cried, "Hit him! By Golly! I hit him! Knocked him
ping!"</p>

<p>Then, turning, the small figure made a rush toward Jamie and a
hand gripped each of his knees.</p>

<p>"Say, if I bring Fat Ole Bill and the Nice Child and Angel Face,
will you tell 'em? Will you say I did it? We got a bet. I'm two
bits to the good. I'll lick the hide off 'em if they don't take my
word, but I could put up a heap bigger swank if you'd tell 'em you
saw me."</p>

<p>Jamie finally got his mouth arranged in a position in which it
would speak recognizable English.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Surely! Any day you want me to, I'll meet your
pals and I'll testify that fairly and squarely you hit the
bee."</p>

<p>"I've been practising on that for a week," boasted the small
person, proudly. "I've been trying and I bet a quarter that I'd do
it, and two bits is some bet, lemme tell you! There's lots of
things you can do with two bits!"</p>

<p>Jamie thought of times when he had contemplated less than two
bits in an open palm during the past few days, and admitted the
truth of the assertion. Talking of money evidently started a new
train of thought. With inquiring eyes the youngster studied
him.</p>

<p>"Will you go to the hospital to see the Bee Master any time
soon?"</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for a telephone call," said Jamie. "Doctor Grayson
told me that he would call and report progress and as soon as the
Master is able to see me, of course I'll go."</p>

<p>The little Scout dipped in a breeches pocket and brought to
light a handful of numerous things, and from strings and buttons
and buckles and pebbles, with the left hand, selected a dime and
two nickels and held them over to Jamie.</p>

<p>"When you go, will you stop at the nearest lunch counter and get
a hot dog and a bottle of strawberry pop for him and give 'em to
him from me with a tight hug and a kiss?"</p>

<p>Jamie accepted the money with a sober face.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the kiss for him right now," said the small
person, and without any preliminaries Jamie had pasted fairly on
his lips the hardest, hottest, sweetest little kiss of all his
experience. He found his hands on the shoulders of the small person
and his eyes intent on the face.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said. "Are you a girl or a boy?"</p>

<p>The small person, with a deft twist, slipped through his fingers
like shifting sand and took a step or two backward.</p>

<p>"If you can't <i>tell</i>, it doesn't make a darn bit of
difference, does it?" And Jamie was constrained to admit that it
did not.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better be goin'," said the little Scout. "I wish
you'd get on the job with that hot dog im<i>pressive</i>. The
Master likes 'em with the bun toasted and the boiled wienie split
and fried and striped with a line of mustard and a thick slather of
fried onions on and a slice of dill pickle. Can you remember that?
Is that the way <i>you</i> like 'em?"</p>

<p>"Love o' Mike!" said Jamie, licking his lips, "I haven't had one
in ages! Sure I can remember!"</p>

<p>"Then that's that!" said the small person. "Do you feel like
you're <i>sure</i> goin' to get on the job and you're <i>sure</i>
goin' to take care of things here?"</p>

<p>"The level best I can," said Jamie. "But I'll have to tell you
as I told your partner, I don't know the first thing about
bees."</p>

<p>"And you don't look chipper enough," said the small person, "to
coast down the east side and climb up the west side of two acres of
bees. You sit still and I'll go see if they are all right
myself."</p>

<p>So Jamie sat under the jacqueranda and waited while the little
Scout went down the east side, carefully inspecting every hive of
bees, and returned with the report that the water pans were all
right, the queens were all laying eggs, the workers were all busy,
the drones were droning, like the disagreeable, mussy things they
were. There was not any foul brood, and there were no robbers at
work.</p>

<p>"Just common, honest bees," said the small person, "working hard
to gather up all the honey they can find in the flower gardens
where the Sierra Madres smash through the Santa Monicas right into
the sea."</p>

<p>The small party insisted on leading Jamie into the house and
showing him the library of bee books. All the volumes that could be
read with profit to find out how to take care of the bees were
pointed out, and then a light finger ran over volumes on a shelf by
themselves with the comment: "Now <i>these</i> are the funny
ones."</p>

<p>A small blue volume which opened of itself was selected and from
it an amused voice read, "'There are several kinds of bees, the
best are small, round and va-ri-e-gated.' Can you beat it?" asked
the youngster.</p>

<p>Jamie, glancing over the little Scout's shoulder, caught
"Aristotle" on the title page and had perhaps his hundredth shock
for the afternoon. After the volume was closed and set back on the
shelf, the child turned toward him: "And Pliny says that when bees
cross the Mediterranean in migration they each one get a little
pebble and carry it with their feet to make them heavy enough that
the wind won't blow them away!" And a laugh that was clear and
silvery broke on Jamie's ears. "Ain't that the bunk? You ought to
hear the Bee Master laugh when he reads Pliny on bees! And there
are a lot more of them that are just as funny, but these are not
funny at all. These are mostly what you need to know to get really
interested."</p>

<p>The small finger ran across Lubbock and Swammerdam with the
remark in passing: "He has got wonderful pictures of how bees are
inside," and paused on Huber. "You'll want to read Huber," the
little Scout said. "He was blind, but he thought out all the
experiments and made all the investigations, and a man with eyes
kept the records. He's wonderful, too. His book is named 'New
Observations on Bees.' Pretty good for a blind man, <i>I'll</i>
say. You know, being a bee master is a lot of other things besides
just bees."</p>

<p>The explanation was offered off-hand, gratuitously.</p>

<p>"It's being outdoors most of the time. It's flowers and what
flowers bees like best. It's a case of quick eyes and a steady
hand, and <i>I'd</i> say you'd got to be decent. You'd better be
certain you're hitting on all your cylinders before you go around
bees. The Bee Master says that bees <i>know</i>, and if anybody's a
liar and a cheat and got the odours of sin and selfishness hangin'
around 'em&mdash;tell it to Papa! The bees know it like a shot, if
you're mean; and they haven't got a bit of mercy. The minute they
get a whiff of what you are, they punksher your tire. If you know,
away down deep inside you, that you ain't right, and that God
wouldn't let you into Heaven if you went to sleep in the night, you
better throw up this job and let me hunt somebody else to look
after the bees."</p>

<p>Jamie stood very straight. He emptied his pocket of his
distinguished service decorations and lowered them to the eyes of
the small person.</p>

<p>"In so far as I know," he said, quite seriously, "there is no
reason why the bees should dislike any odours that might emanate
from my exterior or even from the most secret places of my
soul."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that's all to the good," said the small person.
"You just look to me sometimes as if you wasn't sure whether you
was going to stay or whether you was going on."</p>

<p>"I'll admit," said Jamie, "that it has been difficult for me to
decide whether I'd stay or whether I'd go on, but if you will help
me, I think it would be better for me at least to try what I can
do."</p>

<p>Jamie stood still and watched the small person go down the walk
toward the fence which had afforded the means of entrance. Poised
on the top of it and in the act of swinging over, there came clear
to his ears the admonition, "Better stick around, bo! You'll
<i>like</i> it!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. "Good Master, What Shall
I Do?"</h2>

<p>For an hour after the departure of the Bee Master's partner, to
whom the Master had so tenderly referred as the "little Scout,"
James MacFarlane sat and stared at the whitewashed panel of fence
over which the child had disappeared. First a whimsical smile
played over his features as he recalled the straight forward
humour, the businesslike attitude, the flashes of tenderness, and
the ruthless acceptance of facts following each other so rapidly in
the mentality of the youngster. Then he seriously pondered, for a
few minutes, on whether this peculiar small person really was a boy
or really was a girl. The only definite conclusion he arrived at
was that sometimes <i>he</i> was a boy and sometimes <i>she</i> was
a girl.</p>

<p>His mind travelled on to the thing that was always fore most.
What was it the youngster had said about Death? That there were
several ways? What he had been facing for the past two years was
Death, and the pitiful thing about it for him was that he had never
faced it so imminently nor so surely as at that minute. His aching
bones reminded him of his weakness every time he moved. His swollen
feet cried out whenever he bore his weight on them, and as for the
burning in his left side, he had carried it around with him for so
long that it was almost like an incurable heart-ache or a mental
strain from which one never found surcease. Jamie felt reasonably
sure that he could eliminate the death by water, fire, and
explosion. He did not feel that any of these things were likely to
happen to him. So there were the two remaining kinds of death; he
must face one or the other.</p>

<p>That carried his mind back to the time when as a little boy he
had said his prayers indiscriminately at the knees of either his
mother or his father, for his father had been woman tender with his
only child. There had been a period of years when he had knelt
beside his bed and repeated what he had been taught with some
additions of his own. There had been still later years when he had
gotten into bed and muttered a makeshift prayer. And then there had
been another stretch of years when, in the pride of his strength
and the diverse interests of the full day, he had been so
sufficient in his own body and his own mentality to any need that
assailed him that he not only had not prayed a prayer of
asking&mdash;because he was getting along very well without asking
for anything&mdash;but he had not offered a prayer of thanksgiving.
And as he sat there that afternoon, looking over the blue garden
that was merely a small mountain running down to the sea, studying
the beauty of the flowers, the foliage and the fruit, and then
looking on to the white reaches of sand and the blue of the ocean
and the sky stretching away halfway round the world, he was
assailed by a distinct sorrow, a feeling of regret that he had ever
ceased his nightly prayer. If his arms had been strong and his
brain had been sufficient, if he had not needed to ask physical
help, he might have asked that his mind would be kept from the very
thing that had happened, and there was always the prayer of
thanksgiving. Since the mists had cleared in the beginning and the
sun had shone through and coaxed the earth to foliage and fruit and
animals and man had evolved after the ordained scheme of things,
there always had existed in some degree the same exquisite beauty
that lay before him now. There always had been in the breast of
every man born to enjoy it a heart which should have rejoiced and
should have given thanks for such a heritage. There always had been
lips that should have spoken up and told the Creator how wonderful
was the mystery of the earth and the majesty of the sea and the
beneficence of the sunshine and the healing hours of moonlit
darkness. There always had been the duty his father bravely had
assumed, to acknowledge his obligations, to point the way to other
men less sensitive to the call of God and Nature.</p>

<p>Jamie fell to wondering about how he was going to make the kind
of death that the little Scout had played with and kissed and
rejoiced in, had thought lovely, become a reality for himself. As
he remembered what the child had said, Jamie was devoutly thankful
that whatever his mistakes might have been, whatever his errors,
whatever sins he had committed, he had not wronged his fellow man,
he had not soiled and disgraced any innocent woman, he had not lied
and cheated and smirched his soul in trickery and unfair business
dealings. He had intended when he left college to study forestry.
He had meant to be a tree man. Always he had loved the woods, the
fields, the flowers; but to him a tree had been a living thing, a
thing with feelings, a thing with feet in the earth and a head in
the sky and widely reaching arms of beneficence that gave either
shade or fruit or the pleasure of flowers for the benefit of the
world. He had meant to go to the greatest doctor of trees, and
under his guidance and instruction, take a thorough course in tree
surgery; then he had meant to begin the great work of saving every
possible tree now in existence.</p>

<p>He reflected that working as a bee master was not so bad. Always
he could do what he might for the trees and at the same time a
world of flowers were necessary to furnish a sweet that from the
dawn of history had delighted man, had been medicinal, healing. A
noticeable factor in the wealth of the world was the work that the
humming gauze wings swarming up and down the garden before him were
carrying on. If a man were going to live; if he had the chance to
remain for any length of time in a place like that; if he could
learn the profession without expensive tuition, without lengthy
apprenticeship, it might be a quicker way to a livelihood, and it
might be as pleasant and more interesting. There was a possibility
that the volumes on the shelves above the Bee Master's writing desk
might contain information that would make a living bee, capable of
what seemed remarkably near to thought and preconcerted action,
quite as interesting as an immovable tree, which certainly could
not be imbued with mental processes even by a far stretch of the
imagination.</p>

<p>Just when Jamie had decided that, in the event the Bee Master
came home from the hospital weakened and incapacitated and approved
of the manner in which he had cared for his home and watered the
garden and the trees and taken care of the bees, merely in case he
should make himself useful and interesting and should be asked to
stay&mdash;just when he had resolved that he would find out for
himself whether the prophecy that by "sticking around" he would
like it in the garden of the Bee Master&mdash;up popped the old
black thought: How much time are you going to have in which to like
it? How long will you, trying to do something for the Bee Master,
resemble the case of the blind leading the blind? If he were not
going to be sufficiently well, if he were not going to be
sufficiently strong, if in a few months humming bees and chirping
crickets, singing birds and running water, the blue of the garden
and the sea and sky were to be over for him, what was the use?</p>

<p>Down below he could see where towers and mountains of rocks had
been gnawed and eaten by high tides and smashing waves. Why should
not he, when the Master came home and the trust he had assumed was
over, why should not he just accidentally step off of one of those
frowning crags and go down in an undertow that might carry him to
China for all he knew?</p>

<p>And then, in a flash vivid before him came the mental picture
that the little Scout had conjured up when he had told so casually
about the drowned man and the turtles&mdash;sharks it would
probably be that would worry his lean carcass. The smile was rather
gruesome that twisted Jamie's face when he reflected that his
sharks would not find much nourishment in bone and muscle. Then he
carried the thought a trifle further and reflected that the muscle
would likely be fairly tender. He might make a mouthful for
something.</p>

<p>Then up, big and bright, before his eyes popped that childish
enumeration of the kinds of death, and the description of the
little old lady who had lain on the spread of lavender satin
covered with delicate lace, the beloved lady who softly and gently
had gone to sleep in the night with out even lifting her folded
hands and who carried to her grave a look on her face that the
little Scout had described as "a smiling secret." There was in this
child the pagan ism, the frankness, the cruelty of childhood. (What
was it La Fontaine had said about children? That all of them were
brutally frank, brutally cruel?) Large streaks of cruelty had been
discernible in the little Scout, but not so large as the streaks of
generosity, of tenderness, of the love of fair dealing. Jamie could
see the grimy palm in which buttons and strings and sinkers and
corks and buckles were pushed around to find the coins that went to
pay for a treat for the Master.</p>

<p>Then, too, there had been in the back of the head of the little
Scout the penetration to fathom the look on the face of the
sleeping woman. Jamie reflected that if he purposely went down to
the crags of the Pacific and threw himself to the sharks, when he
came before God and his father and mother, he could carry no
smiling secret on his face. He would not have kept the faith. He
would have broken the laws of God and man. He would have allowed
frail women to surpass him in courage, in endurance. He shut his
eyes to close out even the imagined look on his mother's face. So
right there Jamie crossed off the Pacific from his scheme of
release, and he registered a solemn oath in his breast that no
matter what happened, no matter if he again came to the fortunes of
the road, to the callous indifference that so many wayfarers
encountered, no matter what, anything at all that the most
imaginative could think of, he would not take the chance of facing
the Creator with a craven soul. He swore by all that he ever had
loved and reverenced that he would try, try with all his might in
the short time that might remain to him to master the secret that
had given birth to the smile, and that whatever of good he might be
able to do for the Bee Master or for any one he encountered in the
time he had left, as far as he possibly could, he would forget
himself, he would put his own pain and chagrin and disappointment,
his own feeling of defeat and uselessness, his own craving for love
and intellectual companionship in the background, and he would see
if the more than six feet of bone and muscle that contained his
being could do any small service that might come his way for God
and his fellow man be fore he went. Maybe if he could accomplish
some little thing, something that would ease the ache of even one
heart that ached as his was aching at that minute, just maybe that
knowledge would be the secret that he might carry in his breast
that would set the stamp of an indelible smile on his face, so that
even a child could discern the majesty of the impulse and he would
not be ashamed when the end came.</p>

<p>Then he arose and resolutely, though painfully, hobbled down the
long stretch of the curving and irregular mountain stairway until
he reached the gate. There he sat down and looked the length of the
remaining steps and up and down the coast. On his left hand, not so
far down, he discovered the most attractive young mountain of
stone. It stood boldly, proudly, with defying arrogance, in the
edge of the Pacific Ocean, and there seemed to be a way by which
one might climb it at the back. Jamie imagined that somewhere on
the top of it there might be a grooved space where one could sit
and look to the north and the west and the south, across the
measureless miles of sea face, into illimitable space of sky
country, into the starry orchards of Heaven. He wondered if any
king had ever ruled from a throne like that, and he decided that
none ever had. He decided that he would set that spot as his goal.
To-day he would go no farther, because he had learned that going
down a mountain is far easier than climbing it. But to-morrow he
would open the gate and he would go to the exact spot where the
trumpets of the toluache and the exquisite lavender beds of a
dainty creeping flower that was sand verbena&mdash;Jamie had never
heard of sand verbena, but he had very sensitive nostrils, and at
that hour of the evening he could pick up an exquisite perfume and
he watched a few late bees journeying back and forth to the
delicate beds of colour&mdash;just at the line where the pinkish
lavender of the verbena and the gold of the beach primroses opened
to the sun; he would go that far the coming day. And the following
he would march right straight ahead until he attained the crest of
the dauntless rock.</p>

<p>To reach it he must pass a long stretch of breaking waves, each
of which seemed to say to him: "I dare you! I dare you to come on!"
Jamie sat there and contemplated his feet and thought of their
swollen and aching condition, and a great longing assailed him to
thrust them into the cold salt water of the ocean. Once he half
started to rise, and then the thought came to him that if he be
came chilled, if he took a heavy cold, if he developed a
cough&mdash;Jamie laid his hand on his left breast and sat still.
That would mean the end very speedily, and if it were a possible
thing he intended to fight until the Bee Master came home and
relieved him of the trust that he had assumed when he had agreed to
remain with the bees. But the longing, the desire to step into the
cold salt water had been awakened.</p>

<p>When he heard his call to supper, he started slowly, painfully,
up the winding stairway. Every few steps he paused and turned to
look at the lazy waves creeping up the sand and rolling back again,
and he said to himself that as sure as there was light in the sky,
one of these days he would go down there and he would put at least
his feet in the ocean; he would climb that mountain of rock and he
would sit on a high peak as far into the night as he chose. He
would watch the Pacific Ocean when the moon was threading it with a
million silver pathways. Some time there might possibly be a storm.
There might be waves that would lash almost to the top of that
towering mountain of stone; thunders might crash and lightning
might dart in forked tongues and the waves might go mad and do
their worst in unchecked frenzy. Then he would make a point of
being on the top of that rock, and he would watch that storm of the
elements and see how nearly it resembled a storm that for a long
time had been raging in his heart and in his mind. It would be
something to think about, something to work for, a definite
objective in view merely to reach that lofty rock crest.</p>

<p>He climbed a few steps farther and paused again to study the
face of the sea and the towering crest that in his own mind he
named the throne. It was a throne, a place for a man to captain his
own soul. A man would be a monarch of all he could survey even for
a short time on that crest, and it was better to be a monarch even
for an hour than never to have had a kingly aspiration.</p>

<p>So Jamie went to the supper that Margaret Cameron had prepared
for him and because that climb had wearied him so, because his feet
were throbbing almost unendurably from the long, unaccustomed march
to which he had forced them, he decided that he was not so well as
he had been when he left the hospital. And right there he made a
large mistake. His body might have been tried to such an extent
that it was not so well, but his heart and brain had been given
some exercise that was decidedly beneficial.</p>

<p>While he ate his supper, Margaret Cameron went through the
rooms, touching a curtain here and there, wiping a speck of dust
from the wonderful pieces of old furniture, searching with jealous
eyes to see if the stranger were doing any damage to the property
of a neighbour whom she had learned, through the years, not only to
respect but to cherish with a devotion that was deep and
lasting.</p>

<p>Presently she came from the living room and dropped abruptly to
a chair beside the table at which Jamie was eating his supper.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "I've had about all I can stand to-day.
I'm worried over matters of my own. I've only one child and she has
always been a good girl. She did her school work well and her
training course, and she hadn't any difficulty in getting a school
when she wanted it, but I can't see why she was bent on going so
far from home when she might have had a position here where she
could have stayed with me. Maybe she was tired of the little house
and the exacting old woman always scouring and cleaning, always
fussing about how the young people are going to ruin. I'm not sure
that I didn't drive her away, and I am sure that her Cousin Molly
coaxed her away. I'm not sure that there is any sense in the idea
that the present generation is going to ruin. My mother thought
exactly the same thing about the girls of my day. When I wanted to
go with the boy I married to a barn dance or a corn husking or on
horseback to a picnic or a rally, she thought surely we were doing
something that youngsters had never done before, and that perdition
was yawning wide for us. Maybe it was, for all I know. Anyway, I'm
unhappy about Lolly. She seemed to me to have something on her mind
that she wouldn't tell me, and that isn't all.</p>

<p>"I am free to admit that if the Bee Master doesn't survive this
operation and come back to his home and his neighbours, the rest of
this world is going to be decidedly tasteless to me. We've lived
here, side by side, for a good many years. I've come over and
helped him fix up his place, and he's been over and helped me fix
up mine, and when the young folks would go away in the evening and
the time dragged, he'd come over and we'd play cribbage or
checkers. I never had brains enough to play chess so it would
interest him. Sometimes I'd come over here and he'd sit there by
the fire and read aloud from some of those fine old books." She
paused and looked at Jamie. "Are you familiar," she asked, "with
Donne's 'Devotions'?"</p>

<p>Jamie nodded.</p>

<p>"They were in my father's library," he said, "but no body even
thought to save his books for me. He died while I was in the war,
and Mother had gone not long before, and they sold everything, not
even a scrap of clothing or furniture did any of the neighbours
save for me. Donne's 'Devotions' went with the rest. I don't know
where, and I was too sick to search, and I hadn't the money. I had
to stay where the Government would care for me. But I can see what
it would mean to see the Bee Master with a tinge of firelight on
his fine old face and John Donne in his lean fingers."</p>

<p>Slowly Margaret Cameron nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, half breathlessly, "yes, it was a wonderful
picture he made. Never in all my life have I seen even a painting
of a man so physically and spiritually beautiful as the Bee Master.
I hope when he comes back that you will stay until you thoroughly
learn the fineness of his spirit. It would be a help to you all the
rest of your days only to learn how gentle and tender and fine a
man like Michael Worthington can be. The papers today are so full
of what men are that they should not be. I wish every young man in
the whole world could live a year with a man like the Bee Master in
order to learn his patience and his forbearance, his breadth of
view, his loving outlook on life, and his fearlessness concerning
the hereafter."</p>

<p>"Then, why," asked Jamie, "did he fight the operation so?"</p>

<p>A dingy flush of red crept up in Margaret Cameron's cheek.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing," she said, "he came here with a broken
heart. He never has talked to me in detail but I have started over
here on two occasions when he was talking to the little Scout, and
I think that child knows who it was or what it was that broke his
heart. I think that kiddy knows what he fled from when he came here
alone with only furnishings for his library and his bed room. There
is a picture in his bedroom, probably his wife. I asked him once
about her and he only said that she had been dead for many years
and that he had lost, too, her child, whom he adored. But there was
something more than that. Death isn't insurmountable if it's
accompanied by hope, and the face of the woman who hangs in the Bee
Master's bedroom might very well stand for a typical portrayal of
hope, of purity, of steadfast courage&mdash;almost any fine quality
that any woman could have. He had lost her, he had lost her child;
I feel sure he had lost his home and friends. I think he
deliberately went to the end of his tether, and when he could go no
farther he fell and left his case in the hands of the good
Lord."</p>

<p>So they talked on until dusk. When the remnants of his supper
were packed in the small basket and Margaret Cameron went home, she
invited Jamie to come over any time he was lonely, and she promised
to help him with the morning work until she was sure that he had
learned to do the watering right, because the lilies must not have
enough water to rot the bulbs, and the roses must not start mildew,
and the palms must be just dry enough, and the acacias just wet
enough. Jamie felt, by the time she had finished enumerating the
reasons as to why she should come, that there certainly was
necessity for her presence when he began operations.</p>

<p>Then he went into the living room and, because his blood was
full of poison and circulating slowly, he scratched a match and
lighted the fire that was laid on the hearth. He looked at the
chair that stood beside it for a long time, a high-backed chair
with wide arm rests, a chair of invitation. Without even closing
his eyes he could see the silken hair and beard and the white
forehead and the beautiful eyes of the grand old man whose spirit
was the master of the bees and the master of the house and the
master of his soul, and something in Jamie that was part of the
thing that made him what he was refused to take the Master's chair.
He pushed it back to one side and selected another that he thought
would fit his long frame very nearly as well. Then he opened the
case above the writing desk and picked down one of the volumes that
the little Scout had pointed out to him. It fell open of its own
volition at one page, and the first paragraph that Jamie's eyes
rested on read: "There are two kinds of rulers among bees&mdash;if
there are too many rulers they perish, for thus they become
distracted. The olives and the swarms of bees multiply at the same
time. They begin by making comb, in which they place the progeny.
The comb is deposited with their mouths, as those say who affirm
that they collect it from external sources. Wax is made from
flowers. They bring the material of wax from the dropping of trees,
but the honey falls from the air, principally about the rising of
the stars and when the rainbow rests upon the earth."</p>

<p>When Jamie read that paragraph his shoulders shook with a dry
chuckle. He paused and began communing with the fire.</p>

<p>"Left on this job to keep the bees," he said, "what I should do
is to go over there into the working library and select a volume of
instructions for beginners and find out for myself about a few of
those things the little Scout mentioned&mdash;how to tell a queen
from a worker, a drone from a nurse. I think I'd feel mentally
brilliant if I could look at a bee climbing over a rose and tell
whether it was a working bee or a nurse. I wonder if the little
Scout knows those things?"</p>

<p>Jamie looked at the fire.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised a particle," he said. "I can see that
what I should do is to get the practical part of the bee business
first and read the romance afterward, but by my crossbow and
halberd, I swear this romance of the bees is entrancing
reading!"</p>

<p>Jamie drew the lamp closer and threw another oak knot on the
fire and slouched to comfort in the chair and read on until he
found his eyes were tiring and the fire was low, and then he went
to bed.</p>

<p>When he awoke the following morning from a long, sound sleep and
managed his bath and the straps that bound the bandages on his
chest over his shoulders and around his back to hold his dressings
in place, he had made a distinct step forward because he was not
thinking about the wound or how soon it would finish him. He was
thinking about whether the little Scout would come again that day;
about whether, after he finished the work he must do, he would have
strength left to carry him to the lavender and yellow boundary of
the beach; about honey that rained from Heaven so very obligingly
for the bees of ancient times to gather it up and fill it into
cells. He was thinking about almost anything, except himself, and
that was one of the best things that had happened to him in two
long years.</p>

<p>That day, when the watering was over and he had taken a nap
after lunch, he made the journey that he had contemplated and sat
on the hot sands, and he was so intrigued with the evening perfume
of the little lavender flowers that grew there, so charmed with the
beauty of the gold, that he decided that he would hunt through the
Bee Master's books and see if he could find a book on flowers that
would tell him what these strange and beautiful things were. And as
from the higher point of vantage he looked with longing eyes toward
the clean, cold water of the sea and toward the stretch that lay
between him and the throne, he decided that possibly in a week he
could make it that far, because his feet were feeling much better
after the night of rest, after long application of water, and his
muscles were not so stiff and his bones were not aching so
intolerably.</p>

<p>That evening at six the telephone rang and Doctor Grayson
reported that the operation was over, the Bee Master was back in
his own room, and was conscious. Almost his first question had been
whether there was any message for him concerning the bees, and the
Doctor had told him that everything was fine, but if there was any
special report that he could make for the morning dressing, it
might help. So Jamie reiterated the statement that everything was
fine and added particulars as to the watering and inquired when he
might see the Bee Master.</p>

<p>Doctor Grayson had replied: "He doesn't realize how precarious
his condition is or how weak he is; but I should think that in a
week or ten days you might come for your first visit. In the
meantime, I will call you and give you a report each evening, to
let you know how he is, and I would be interested in knowing how
you are feeling yourself."</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated over that. He did not know exactly what to say.
But before he had time to say anything, the Doctor continued:
"There was no time, when the life of the Bee Master was in
jeopardy, to give you any attention; but you look to me like one of
our boys who was carrying a pretty serious problem somewhere in his
anatomy, and I had my doubts as to whether you were equal to the
job you were undertaking. Any time you would like to come in and
let me look you over&mdash;get a pencil and I'll give you
instructions how to reach the hospital, if you are a stranger in
these parts."</p>

<p>So Jamie said he was a stranger and he would very much like to
have the location of the hospital, and when he came to see the
Master, if the Doctor would be kind enough to keep that offer open,
that would be famous.</p>

<p>So another day and then another went by, and each day Jamie
finished watering the flowers and the fruits and mixing the drink
for the bees and his inspection of the hives slightly earlier. He
had followed the little Scout's advice. When he went among the bees
he had donned the coat worn by the Bee Master and he had rubbed
Madonna lily over his hands and hair and made himself intimately
familiar with the cinnamon pink bed. There was a question in his
mind, from what the child had said, as to whether the sensitive
organs of the bee might not detect a faint odour of the dressings
he wore and resent it as unfamiliar, but nothing of the kind had
happened. He had been so near the Bee Master's height and form; he
had worn the familiar coat; he had practised frequently on
"Highland Mary," and the bees paid no attention whatever to him in
so far as he had given them a chance. The isolated hives of the
Black Germans he kept away from. Down in the depths of his soul he
had a feeling that if he got near a hive of anything that was named
Black German, he would very likely muster what remaining strength
he had and kick it into the middle of the Pacific regardless of
what might happen by way of retaliation.</p>

<p>When he hung the coat on the hook on which he had found it, his
fingers struck something rough and warm which on examination proved
to be a bathing suit of wool, a warm, heavy suit. Jamie took it
down and fingered it eagerly and then he walked to the back porch
and looked out over the blue waters of the sea. He held the bathing
suit up to his shoulders and drew it around him, and wondered
whether it would cover the bandages and what would happen if the
dressings were soaked with salt water.</p>

<p>He was afraid that would not do, so he turned back regretfully
and slowly hung the woollen bathing suit, not where it had been,
but on the first hook nearest the casing of the back door, hung it
right up prominently where he must see it each time he went in and
out that door, and every time he saw it, he stood and looked at it,
and in a few days more he decided that it would not be a bad idea
to put it on and go with bared feet down on the hot sands. There
would be no chill about that during the heat of the day, and then
he might walk where the little waves were breaking enough to wet
his feet, merely to feel the joy that he imagined he would
experience in having those cold, salty waves creep up and run over
them. He could go back to the warm sand and dry them rapidly and
why might not a process like that stimulate circulation? Why would
not the hot sand draw the sluggish poisoned blood in his veins to
his feet? Why would not the cold salt water drive it back? Why
would not the stimulation thus gained help to throw off the poison
bred by the wound in his breast?</p>

<p>So, through the warm golden days, Jamie kept his trust with the
Bee Master the level best he could, with the help of Margaret
Cameron, and his mind had as much exercise as his body. Much sooner
than he had expected he reached the foot of the throne. The climb
was not bad at all and he did find, around on the side of the huge
rock facing the sea, a long gash that made a wonderful seat, a seat
that fitted the curves of his body, a seat that, when upholstered
with the Bee Master's old working overcoat, would be wonderful to
slouch in, to rest, to soak in the sun, to breathe in the salt from
west of the crest.</p>

<p>He had not reached the point where he had definitely decided
that he would fight. His mind was merely stirred with suggestions,
conjectures, possibilities. If any one had asked him, who had the
right to ask, and had been given a frank answer, Jamie would have
said that six months, without any doubt whatever, would be the
length of his tenure. A year of the best treatment the Government
could give him had left him worse. He thought about six months
would see the finish. Sometimes he was considerably disquieted
because the call for him to visit the hospital had not come. Each
night at six o'clock he answered the telephone and heard that the
Bee Master was barely holding his own. He was not yet able to con
verse or be bothered about business.</p>

<p>Each time he received one of these reports, he called the little
Scout at the number that had been given him and passed the report
on. Twice the little Scout had been in the garden for a short visit
after school hours. Each time Jamie parted with his new friend with
deeper regret. Each time he had seen some new emanation of the
mentality of the youngster that had surprised, sometimes shocked,
sometimes delighted him, and as for the question of sex, he was not
a bit nearer the solution than he had been the first day.</p>

<p>After supper on the ninth day, for the second time Jamie made
his way the length of the back walk, across the beach, and climbed
to the throne. He was armed with a broad-brimmed old slouch hat and
the old overcoat. He climbed the throne and settled in an especial
seat of his own that he had managed with considerable work and more
strength than he had known he could muster. He had collected some
broken pieces of rock and fitted them in differently and farther to
the left than there had been an accessible seat. Wrapped in the
overcoat, he dropped on the seat and faced the eternal verities of
sky and sea. No land was intruding. It was the bowl of the sky
closing down; the smooth wash of the sea rolling in; and away in
the distance a faint red glow marked the spot where the sun threw
its light on a world that was steadily turning from it.</p>

<p>There Jamie did some more thinking. He was having plenty of
mental exercise in those days. He still thought Death, but at least
he had a manlier thought in facing it. And when he thought Life, he
did not think of himself, or upbraid his government, or pity other
wounded men. He thought merely of that one thing he might possibly
do and what it might possibly be that would give him some
justification, when he faced his Maker, for the spending of his
latter days.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. The Storm Woman</h2>

<p>The new day was one of fog and of stillness and then a cold wind
that Jamie did not care to face. Just at evening when he looked
from the back veranda and down across the stretch before him, he
realized that the thing he had wanted to see was going to hap pen.
There were heat flashes across the horizon. Forked tongues of light
were beginning to flicker up and there was an ominous stillness,
and away up to the north and west he could see big black clouds
beginning to mass and to gather. Jamie straightened up. "A storm!"
he said to himself. "The storm! By all that's good and peaceful,
I'll see it from the throne if it's the last thing that I ever
do!"</p>

<p>He looked over the garden, putting away several things that high
wind might damage; he carefully closed the windows and locked the
doors, and then he went into the closet on the back porch and
ransacked the Bee Master's belongings for suitable clothing. He
laid out the bee coat and the old overcoat, and then he found a
heavy raincoat that was precisely what he wanted.</p>

<p>He put the bee coat on, and carrying the overcoat and the
raincoat and wearing the old broad-brimmed hat, he locked the back
door behind him and slowly made his way down the back walk, across
the sands, and climbed the throne. Putting on the overcoat and
spreading the rain coat so that he could draw it around him, he
dropped into the niche he had prepared for himself and drew his
covers snugly so that he would not chill. Then he sat watching the
coming storm in intent eagerness.</p>

<p>He did not know that he was matching forces. He did not realize
that for two years the storm that wracks the soul and body of a man
even to destruction had been raging in his battered breast, in his
heart, in his brain. He did not know that he had dimly realized the
strength, the terror, the futility of it. He did not know why he
wanted to see the sky reach down and the sea rise up and do their
utmost. He did not know that he wanted to compare the storm that
may sweep the heart of a man with the kind of storm that may sweep
the world. He honestly tried to protect himself so that he would
not hasten what might be in store for him. He did not want to fail,
when the Bee Master had trusted him with the home and the
possessions and the occupation that were all he had of his very
own, and he did not know that as the storm drew nearer, as the
clouds grew blacker, as the heat waves resolved themselves into
definite flashes of lightning, as the night closed down black as
velvet around him, he did not realize that his moral and mental
forces were rising with the tide of the storm, that all the
remnants of man hood left in his shaken body were gathering
together for, some sort of culmination, just as presently the storm
would reach its height and then subside.</p>

<p>Without moving a muscle, almost breathlessly, he lay back in his
rocky nook and wondered exactly how high the tide would rise. He
had not informed himself as to whether the point of rock might be
surrounded. He thought it would be an unprecedented storm that
would sweep over it. At any rate, he was taking the chance. He
might have asked Margaret Cameron whether that point ever was
completely submerged. He was certain that it was high above any
level to which man had seen the ocean lift, that it must be
safe.</p>

<p>At the point where Jamie realized that he was having the best
time he had had since the guns were booming and the rage of battle
was smashing and he had been able to deliver what he considered a
few effective blows, each of which he had invariably accompanied by
a grinding shout, "In the name of the Forty-second Highlanders!";
just when his blood really was tingling and his spirits were
answering to the smash of the waves that were flinging spray to his
feet, to the roar of the thunder and the crash of the lightning;
just when the fight was going good and Jamie was a Forty-second
Highlander and with a sword of magic was cutting off the heads of
innumerable Germans with each sword thrust of lightning, the most
astounding thing happened to him that ever had happened in all the
years of his existence. All around him and enveloping him there
came slowly and faintly creeping a strange odour.</p>

<p>Jamie dropped from the sky battle to every-day realities and
turned his head to the right. Delicately as when he was creeping
belly down toward the Germans in No Man's Land, hunting a lost
comrade or scouting enemy locations, he sniffed the night air. The
first absolute information that he felt he could rely on that his
nostrils telegraphed to his brain was "sage." He took another sniff
and recognized the lavender flower of the beaches: "Sand verbena,"
one of the most subtle and exquisite faint odours in all nature,
and then a whiff of primrose crept up. And then, just when the
crack that seemed to split the heavens wide was followed by the
boom of the reverberating thunder, there came to Jamie's ears a
wrenching sobbing that was the most pitiful thing he ever had
heard. Still as death he sat in his wrappings, his head turned, his
nose and his ears alert; and by and by, sniffing and listening, he
reached his conclusion: The throne that he had thought so
wonderful, that he had preempted, that he had meant to occupy on
many a night of communion in his effort to make his peace with God,
was not his personal throne. He was an interloper. Someone else was
familiar with the winding way that reached the eminence from the
back. Someone else had a fight that needed the healing of God
through Nature to help him to wage. Be side him was someone who
smelled of the sage of the mountains, of the lavender and the gold
flowers of the beaches, and this someone else had the voice of a
woman, not the cracked voice, not the breathless voice of an old
woman. God knew Jamie had heard women cry, the women of France, the
women of Belgium, the women of England! He was an expert on all
kinds and varieties of sobs of anguish that could be wrenched from
the frame of a mother, a wife, a sister, a sweetheart.</p>

<p>Slowly, softly, as nearly without sound as possible, he turned
to face this woman. She had found her seat where he had first sat.
She probably did not know that another seat had been made, beyond
the place to which she must have been accustomed, or she never
could have found it in the darkness of the storm. She must have
been familiar with that point through other storms, or she never
would have sought it when that one was raging at its fiercest.</p>

<p>As Nature wore herself out and began gradually to ease in the
storm she was waging, another amazing thing happened to Jamie. The
raving wind that had been sweeping from the west was gradually
shifting to the north and it began blowing something across his
face, something that was soft, something that was silken, something
that was tugging and pulling and plastering to him with the driving
spray and the beating rain. In dumbfounded bewilderment he worked a
hand to the surface and softly touched his cheeks, and across them
there was streaming the silken banner of a woman's hair. Jamie
realized that when that woman learned that there was a man there,
she probably would be so frightened that she might throw herself
into the boiling sea a few feet below them. He was afraid to speak,
afraid to move, and the one thing that he did not figure on was
that there might be beside him a pair of nostrils sensitive as his
own, and that there might very presently emanate from him an odour
that would become discernible to someone else.</p>

<p>Just how that would have worked out, Jamie never knew because at
the instant that his hand crept higher to work the blinding hair
from his eyes, a long, low flash of lightning struck the breast of
the ocean and for one instant lighted the rock like day. In that
instant Jamie saw the white face and the big, wide eyes of a woman,
eyes that he would remember while remembrance remained with him, a
face that by no possibility could he ever forget. The sharp gasp of
astonishment at his presence there, where any one accustomed to the
rock might well have supposed there would be no one, his quick ear
told him came from a woman accustomed to self-control. She had not
screamed. She had not jumped. It was merely the catching of a
breath.</p>

<p>Jamie was in a measure prepared. He had been trying to plan
something. He was not taken unaware as she was. What he had meant
to say, what he had thought would be a wise thing to say, never was
uttered.</p>

<p>What he heard himself saying was: "Don't be startled! What hurts
you so? Let me help you."</p>

<p>Then a voice that was going to take a place in Jamie's mentality
along with the eyes and the face&mdash;a deep, rich contralto voice
with a touching quaver of pathos through it, a voice shaken with
emotion and accented with tones native to his ears&mdash;answered
him: "Why did you come here?"</p>

<p>Jamie replied: "Very possibly for the same reason you did." The
voice answered: "Oh!"</p>

<p>Jamie combed the streaming locks from his cheeks and his lips
with his fingers and sat tightly holding them in his hand. And he
who had gone out to compare the battle of Nature with the battle of
his soul, forgot all about himself as he said to the girl beside
him:</p>

<p>"Did anybody ever tell you that a trouble shared is a trouble
half endured?"</p>

<p>Then he laughed a deep burry Scotch laugh. He threw out his
right arm and felt to the north until he circled the shoulders of
the woman beside him.</p>

<p>"You aren't half covered," he said, "and you are drenched! Creep
over here in the protection of my coat. And then, because it is
night, and because I know that your soul is wracked and maybe your
body tortured, tell me the truth. I'm sure I can help you. There is
always a way. I can think of something."</p>

<p>Jamie never forgot that when his arm reached across the shoulder
beside him there was no shrinking, no repulsion, no hesitation. It
took one more flash of lightning to show him that the woman he was
trying to comfort was young. She was not beautiful, but she was
luringly human. Plastered with rain, wrenched with grief, he had no
right to judge her.</p>

<p>"I mean it," he said, taking up the thread of his thought again.
"I mean it. If you will tell me, I promise to help you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but how can you help me?" said a voice, every tone of
which Jamie registered as it fell on his ear.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jamie. "I don't know how I can help you,
because I don't know what you need. I only know that I <i>can</i>
help you, that I <i>will</i> help you if you will tell me what it
is that troubles you."</p>

<p>In the long silence that followed, Jamie manipulated the Bee
Master's raincoat to the best advantage possible and tightened the
grip of his right arm. At last, above the rumbling of the subsiding
storm, above the crashing of the waves below them, Jamie heard
again the voice for which he was waiting.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," said the woman, whose breast was still
heaving, whose shoulders were still quivering. "I can't tell a
stranger in the darkness, in the storm, what it is that is hurting
me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can," said Jamie, casually. "Better now than at
any other time. If it is anything you aren't proud of, the darkness
will cover you. If it's anything you are afraid of, you may depend
on the strength there is in my right arm. If it is anything that as
much of a man as I am can do for you, I want you to understand that
you are my mother or my sister, or any relationship that you can
think of that a man who is trying to be fairly decent wouldn't
violate. I'll give you my word of honour that I will hot follow
you; I will not make any effort to learn who you are or where you
come from. If you came here to-night intending to throw yourself
into the undertow that sucks down from these rocks, you needn't be
any too sure that I didn't come with the same intention. I'll admit
that I've thought about it. I've got a storm of my own in my
breast. I've got my wounds that are still open and bleeding.
There's nothing about me that you need hesitate over. I'm just
telling you that your voice is young, and your face is young, and
your body is strong, and in some way there can be healing managed
for young hearts that are breaking, and I <i>do</i> believe that
trouble shared is trouble at least half endured. Tell me."</p>

<p>Jamie could almost feel the thinking process that was going on
in the mind of the woman whom he was trying to shelter and to
support.</p>

<p>"It's a long story," said the rich voice at last, "and it's a
story that's got what the world calls 'shame' in it. And the world
is right in calling what there is in it 'shame', because I am
ashamed. I couldn't sit here in broad sun light and let you shelter
me, and look at me, and tell you. I could only tell you in such
darkness and turmoil as this, and you can't possibly do any good,
but there is this about it: If you came and weathered the storm and
resolved that you could go on with what you call an open wound in
your breast, I'll promise you that I'll not go over the rock. I'll
promise you that I'll find my way back to the friends I left; that
I'll go home; that I'll take up my work; that I'll do the best I
can."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Jamie, "as far as it goes. But it doesn't go
far enough to do you any more good than the good of saving your
soul alive, because we don't get life at our own volition in this
world, and we have no right to give it up until the God who gave it
says we have lived it. What I am offering to do is to take the
burden that's crushing you, off your heart. Isn't there a little
bit of shelter in the arm across your shoulders? Doesn't my voice
sound sincere? I haven't the least objection in the world to
telling you who I am, where I come from, or where I am going when I
leave this rock. I have told you that I will not follow you. If
there is anything in to-night that you would blush for to-morrow, I
will not intrude myself, but I do beg you to believe me when I say
that I know I can help you, if you will tell me."</p>

<p>And that was a very bold and daring statement for Jamie, with
six months to live and nothing in his pockets, to make to any woman
in distress. Yet he made it in the utmost confidence and there was
something in his voice that carried conviction. Before he knew
precisely what had happened to him, the thing for which he had
striven occurred. The length of his frame he felt the relaxation of
the taut muscles beside him. He bent to extend the shelter of the
raincoat.</p>

<p>"That's a good girl," he said, in exactly the same tone he would
have used to a six-year-old. "Now, go on and tell me what happened
to you. You needn't make it a long story. You could probably tell
it in ten words if you chose. What hurt you? How can it be
fixed?"</p>

<p>Again he could sense the intense thinking.</p>

<p>"All right," said the voice beside him. "What I need above
everything else on earth at this minute is a marriage certificate,
and a wedding ring, and a name for an unborn child. My need is
desperate. That's all. Now go ahead and make good your boast!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie smoothly, instantly. "The proposition
you have put me is almost the easiest thing I could manage. I've
got a name and it is of no particular use to me, and I haven't much
time left in which to use it. I've strength enough to manage a
license and a marriage ceremony, if it's necessary. If you pledge
me your word of honour that the trouble in your heart can be healed
by giving you a name I am going to quit using shortly, you will
grant I was right when I told you I could settle your difficulty.
I've been wondering for days past what I might do that would be
something fine and shining that I could lay at the feet of the
Master when I go farthest West, as I am going very soon, to render
my last account, and you have opened the way. I think it would be
very decent, I think it would be something the Master would approve
if I left my name to a little child that is making its way toward
earth and facing a heritage you wouldn't want for it."</p>

<p>Then suddenly Jamie felt the woman in his arms merging her form
with his. He felt her hands on his breast. He felt them reaching to
find his face. He felt the hot breath of her voice.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't!" she was panting. "Oh! you wouldn't! You wouldn't
get me a marriage license! You wouldn't stand through a ceremony
with me! You wouldn't let me use your name?"</p>

<p>Jamie found the hand on his face and gripped it tight with his
left hand. He had presence of mind to tighten his grasp around the
shoulders yielding to him. He was enough of a Scotsman to command
the situation.</p>

<p>"You are mighty right I would!" he said. "I'm telling you true.
Here, if you don't believe me, I'll convince you," and he shifted
the hand he held until the finger of it could touch the bandages
across his breast. "You feel that?" he asked. "You're not touching
the body of a man. Those are bandages covering the body of a man,
and under those bandages there's an open wound that will never
heal. I am telling you true. There's no one on earth who is closely
related to me. There's no one to care what I do with my name or
with the few remaining months of my life. The nearest I can come to
a family is a mother and a father, and they are both in Heaven, and
if either of them were here this minute, they would say: 'Cover the
shame baby with your name, Jamie!'"</p>

<p>"Jamie!" said the voice beside him a little breathlessly. "There
isn't a sweeter name in all the world that could be given to a
little child, if it happened to be a boy. But it's too big a
sacrifice! It's a thing that shouldn't be asked of any man, no
matter how free, no matter how willing!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "I'm telling you I am free. I'll prove it by
citing to you records you can look up. I'm part of the aftermath of
war. You can find my name if you look in the proper place for it.
I'll tell you right here that it's James Lewis MacFarlane, and from
the time I can remember, my mother and father made it Jamie. I ran
away from a hospital a few days ago because my case was hope less
and I wouldn't go where they wanted to send me. You know Camp
Kearney? You know the village of tents that means the White Plague?
I hadn't it and I wouldn't go there, so I-ran away. I got as far as
the apiary just below here on the mountain-side and I couldn't drag
any farther. I was staggering toward the Bee Master to ask him to
help me, but he beat me to it and asked me to help <i>him</i>. I
thought I couldn't, but I did. I helped him to the hospital in time
for his operation. I am staying in his house, taking care of his
property. I am telling you truly what my name is, where you can
find me. I am telling you that you may have my name any time you
want to claim it."</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" said the girl, breathlessly. "May I claim it
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Any time you say, any place," said Jamie. "Tell me where you
want me to go and what you want me to do."</p>

<p>And then, quite before Jamie knew at all what was happening to
him or what was going to happen, he felt another shift of position
of the woman in his arms, and for the next second he was in her
arms. Hands had found the sides of his head and his face was turned
up and a wet, cold salty face was laid against his, cold lips were
touching his cheeks and a breathless voice was saying: "Oh! you're
good! You're good! I didn't know there was a man like you in the
whole world! Will you meet me to morrow at three o'clock at the
Marriage Bureau in Los Angeles? Will you truly have a marriage
license made out? Will you stand beside me through a ceremony that
will mean life and the lifting of a black burden?"</p>

<p>"I will!" said Jamie. "Don't give yourself another minute's
worry. Dry your eyes and cheer up! I'll be right there as sure as
God is in His Heaven and there's any justice for women in all this
world. And if I am not there, you can know that the red tiger has
eaten through to my vitals until I cannot get there&mdash;but you
needn't worry, because I shall be there. God wouldn't give me this
shining chance and then snatch it away from me."</p>

<p>"Will you sit here, right in this spot, for a few minutes more?"
asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I'll sit here all night if you tell me to," said Jamie, calmly,
and it was not so calmly either because his heart was tearing until
he was afraid it would fall out of the opening above it, and his
blood was racing as blood had never raced in his veins. The girl in
his arms might be cold and clammy and salt pasted, but he was
neither cold nor clammy. He got one more tight hug and one more
kiss&mdash;which happened to land squarely on the tip of his
nose&mdash;not the location in which he wanted it in the
least&mdash;and then she was gone and he heard swift feet going
down the back of the rock and his trained ears could hear the first
few footfalls across the dark beach.</p>

<p>He sat there and waited and looked down into the boiling surf
and out over the battling sea, and by and by, he calmed himself so
that he could think straightly and evenly, and then he said: "Such
quick action as this seems to indicate that my time is short, and
if there is a big thing that I have a chance of doing in this
world, I've got to do it and do it quickly. So to-morrow afternoon
at three o'clock, I'll start on what appeals to me as the shining
part of my Great Adventure."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. A New Kind of
Wedding</h2>

<p>When the faintest sound of a footfall had died away, Jamie
settled back in his niche in the rock, drew his wrappings around
him, and turned his face in the direction of the sea, the face that
had been held between a pair of strong, impetuous woman's hands,
the face that had been showered with wholly impersonal caresses
merely as an expression of release from a thraldom of shame. He had
been paid in the coin of the realm of womanhood most desired by
men, therefore most frequently offered by women in extremity.</p>

<p>Jamie sought among his clothing and found a handkerchief. He
pulled it out and carefully wiped his face. There was nothing about
the clammy, salty kisses he had received that he wished to
perpetuate, not even the memory of them, because the girl who gave
them had not meant them for him personally. She had bestowed real
kisses elsewhere. These were the first available expression of
thankfulness for freedom, freedom to lift up her head, freedom to
face the world, freedom to go on with her life in such a manner
that the ever-ready "finger of scorn" need not be pointed at
her.</p>

<p>Jamie grinned dourly as he scoured his face.</p>

<p>"I hope she doesn't think," he said to the boiling surf below,
"that she fooled me any with those kisses. It's all right. She's
welcome to my name. She's welcome to her ring&mdash;if she buys it
herself&mdash;and her certificate. I didn't see her very well, but
what I did see didn't look like a fast woman.</p>

<p>"I'll say <i>that</i> for her. And she didn't act as if she were
used to calling on other people to shoulder many of her burdens.
God knows she wasn't afraid for her body, or she wouldn't have been
on this rock close to midnight in this storm; not afraid with
physical fear; but I suppose it's the mental strain that gets
people the worst. I suppose it's mental fear or nerve strain, or
whatever you might call it, that's been eating me for the past two
years. It's not that I'm afraid of death physically. God knows I've
seen enough of it so that I can take my medicine as I saw thousands
of boys take theirs! It's just that since I am alive, since I
<i>am</i> breathing, since there <i>is</i> the ghost of a
possibility that I might have a slim fighting chance, I hate
standing still and watching myself going out by the inch. And the
reason I hate the going is because I've never lived; I've never had
the things that, to a man, constitute real life, and I want a taste
of <i>life!</i> I know just enough about the sky and the sea and
the earth to want to get on the tree job and run it down as I've
always intended."</p>

<p>Then, for a time, long past the stipulated time, Jamie sat and
watched the gradual clearing of the sky, the calming of the sea. It
was not long before he could see the stars again, and some way a
star always was connected in Jamie's mind with a suggestion of
hope. Ever since he had read an oration by the greatest agnostic of
his day in which he had said at the grave of a beloved brother,
when put to the ultimate test himself: "In the night time of
despair, hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of
a wing," Jamie had thought that perhaps the lips of man never had
uttered more beautiful words. This night had been a "night time of
despair" for a young thing that he had held in his arms for a few
brief minutes. Every night for a long time had been a night of
despair for him. He was sorry, sorry to the depths of his heart for
the grief that wracked and tore and drove frantic such a fine,
strong young thing, with an odour of the woods, with the sage of
the mountains and the lavender and gold flowers of the beach
distilling like incense around her. That was the pity of it. How
had shame happened to a woods girl? Jamie knew that while he lived
there would remain in his nostrils the scent that had first
assailed them, carried by the winds of the storm, and as if it had
not been removed he could feel the clinging of the silky strands of
hair. She must have a perfect mane. Then he wondered how it came to
be unbound. Then he remembered something else&mdash;the one
revealing flash that had shown him the girl most clearly. He had
not thought of it at the time, but he remembered it now. That flash
had disclosed bare feet and a streak of white above them.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Jamie, softly, to the Spirit of the Sea that was
drawing up very close to him in that hour. "By Jove! She wore a
nightdress and one of those eiderdown kimonos over it! I remember
by the feel of her and by her bare feet. She asked a few minutes'
grace before I should start. That means that she had gone to bed
and was so driven she had decided that she'd bed in the sea, and
she'd put on the kimono and come as she was to this point she knew
how to find. She couldn't have come up these rocks as still as
thought, and she couldn't have gone down them with the swiftness
and ease she used if she had not known them perfectly, and a few
minutes wouldn't carry her far across the sands of this soaked
beach. That means that she came from somewhere very near here."</p>

<p>And then, as an outsider might speak to him, Jamie added: "And
if you will recall what you said to her, old man, you gave her your
word of honour that you wouldn't try to find her."</p>

<p>Then Jamie answered back and said: "But how am I going to keep
that promise? How am I going to marry a girl with such a noble
face, with hair of silk, and hands of such assurance: how am I
going to stand up and swear that I'd love her and take care of her
so long as we both shall live, and then not work for her, not
wonder where she is, and what is happening to her, and whether I
could not do more for her than to give her my name at a pinch?"</p>

<p>Then Jamie, for the second time that night, thought of his Great
Adventure, and he said to the sea and to the near-by personality
who had commenced the conversation with him: "I'm not so sure that
what I called a Great Adventure in jesting merely to hearten myself
may not possibly prove to be more of an adventure than I've
reckoned on."</p>

<p>Then the outside voice talked back to Jamie again, and it was a
jeering voice that laughed at him and sneered at him. It said:
"Well, Mr. Married Man, you'd better be getting home and fortify
yourself with rest and sleep. You'd better press your trousers and
see if the Master has got a decent scarf you can borrow. If you're
going to be a bridegroom, you'd better think about starting your
preparations."</p>

<p>Jamie, detecting the sneer in the voice, defended him self. He
said: "Well what would you have done? If you hadn't a relative on
earth, if you knew you wouldn't live to see the consequences, if a
woman creature, young and attractive, was ready to throw herself
into the sea before you, wouldn't you save her by any means you
could? Wouldn't you give her a name that couldn't hurt her and that
might possibly help her all the rest of her life?"</p>

<p>He did not hear any answer to that, and so he turned his
attention to the sea again. "I'd like to know," he said, dourly,
"what a lot of the mothers in this world mean. If they've known
enough about the awful power of sex attraction themselves to marry
a man and bear a child, why, in God's world, don't they know what
they are letting the young folks up against when they turn them
loose in utter and untrammelled freedom on the mountains and
through the canyons and on the beaches and in the parks and the
dance halls and the streets? Can't they see that however times and
customs change, the desires of the heart and the urge of the body
do not change? They only grow stronger with the freedom and license
and physical contact allowed in these astounding days."</p>

<p>Then Jamie arose unsteadily and drew on the raincoat, and
shuffling his feet before him, made his way down the steep pathway
with which he had become sufficiently familiar during the few times
he had climbed it to negotiate it safely. He followed his way down
the beach by gyrating between the slopping of the waves and the
entangling primroses. When he found he was among mats of prim rose
that threatened to trip him, he veered toward the water. When he
splashed in the water, he veered toward the primroses, and by so
going he came at last to where the lights of the Bee Master's home
threw a welcoming beam down the mountain-side. Then he felt along
the back fence until he found the gate, and after that it was easy
to reach the back door, and he was entirely ready for the back door
by the time he opened it. He dropped on the first chair he
encountered to rest awhile.</p>

<p>"I'm none too sure," said Jamie, "that my contract for
to-morrow, or is it to-day?"&mdash;he glanced up at the clock and
saw to his surprise that it was to-day&mdash;"won't be about all I
can accomplish in one day." But that one word that had been
jeeringly thrust at him out there on the rock, "bridegroom,"
persisted in his ears. It meant something to a man to be a
bridegroom under any circumstances. It should mean the most
wonderful thing in all the world. There should not be anything,
unless it might be the love of God, that would be bigger and higher
and holier in the heart of a man than to be the groom of his chosen
bride, in ordinary circumstances. But there was nothing ordinary
about the circumstances under which he had contracted to be a
bridegroom. No, there was not. The storm of the elements, the storm
in his own heart, the storm in the heart of the girl&mdash;</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" said Jamie. "What a storm! Regular typhoon! Anyway
for the clearing up to-morrow I'll go to bed and I'll see whether I
can sleep or not. And if I can, then I wonder how much time I am
going to need, and how I am going to find the place where I've
promised to be?"</p>

<p>Then he thought of Margaret Cameron. She could tell him what car
lines he must take, and once he reached the heart of the city it
would not be difficult to find the proper office where the business
of the county was trans acted.</p>

<p>So Jamie lay down and shut his eyes; the velvet blackness of the
night closed round him and the steady sweep of the sea breaking on
the shore so very near came with rhythmic cadence. There was enough
wind to sing a little. He was very tired but he had made good his
boast so far. He had told the girl that if she would tell her
trouble, he could help her, without a notion in his head as to how
he was going to help her. By the depth of her grief he could
measure the depth of her relief, relief that set her lips on his
face, her hands frantically clutching him. He had saved her
position before the world probably. He had offered what was of not
much use to him, in the stead of the man who had been too much of a
hound to make good his obligations. After all, he would have
something beautiful to think about when the last hour came. Maybe
the little Scout had been right about the different kinds of death.
Maybe when Jamie's time came he could think of the passion of
relief, of deliverance, of utter panicky joy, that had obliterated
the passion of fear and humiliation in the girl he was going to try
to help. Maybe he could fold his hands and go softly in his sleep,
and maybe at least his face could carry the smiling secret that the
little Scout had talked about, if he got a chance to enter the
gates and face his mother.</p>

<p>The next thing Jamie knew, the clock that he had set for seven
was burring and he awoke from deep sleep and went to his breakfast
and the watering. He merely told Margaret Cameron that he had some
business in town. No, he was not going to the hospital, because he
saw the desire to go with him in her eyes. He was not going to the
hospital until Doctor Grayson sent for him. He would be back in the
evening in time for dinner, maybe sooner. She need not mind about
his lunch.</p>

<p>Jamie did the most important of the things he had been doing
daily outdoors, postponing as many of them as he possibly could to
the coming day. Then he went in and rested awhile. Later he brushed
his clothing and searched through the drawers and the
closets&mdash;the Bee Master had told him to help himself to his
clothing if he needed changes, in view of the manifest fact that he
had taken Slim from the road with only the clothing on his back.
Jamie thought it over and then he selected an extremely
good-looking gray silk shirt and a dull-blue tie. He looked at his
own trousers critically. He had slept in them and given them rough
usage, and he had worked in them some. They were not suitable
trousers for a bride groom. He was so near the Bee Master's height
and build that a pair of gray ones he found stretched in the long
drawer of a highboy were exactly right. He went on searching, and
by and by he had the bed almost covered with clothing that appealed
to Jamie as eminently suitable for an honest-to-goodness
bridegroom.</p>

<p>Then he went to his bath, and when he managed the fresh
dressings on his left breast, he hesitated over the
antiseptics&mdash;and omitted them. He would not go to his bride
even with a taint of medicinal odour about him. Since she smelled
of flowers herself, he would emulate the example of the greatest
beau the world has ever known by having the odour that emanated
from him merely that of fresh linen, of utter cleanliness.</p>

<p>At heart Jamie was a gentleman. When he locked the front door
and started down the walk for the short trip to the trolley line
which ended a few rods away, he was as white of face and hands as
his condition warranted. Otherwise, he was an attractive gentleman.
He carried his head at a high angle. He squared his shoulders, as
much military training had required. He stepped out in the Master's
best shoes and gray trousers and black coat, in his gray silken
shirt and his dull-blue tie and a soft broad-brimmed black hat; he
stepped out habited, as it was proper that any gentleman might
habit himself when he was going to be a bridegroom. He stepped very
carefully that he might not accumulate dust on his shoes before he
reached the trolley, and in taking this care it occurred to him to
wonder where the girl he was going to marry was at that minute and
what she was doing; whether she really would be at the appointed
place to meet him and what she would look like, and what she would
say to him, and with what words she would leave him when she had
secured from him the things that she had admitted she needed so
badly&mdash;a name, a wedding certificate, and a ring.</p>

<p>When he reached the ring in thought, a dull red flamed up in
Jamie's cheek. He was not sure that he had not gone too far. Before
the Bee Master had been carried from his home he had pointed to a
little drawer in his secretary in which Jamie would find money for
an emergency, for milk, or ice, or whatever he needed until the
Master's return. From that drawer, as a fortification for his
self-respect that morning, Jamie had taken ten dollars. He was not
sure that ten dollars would pay for a marriage license. A marriage
license was a commodity he had not previously considered. He had no
idea what the article cost, but he felt certain it would not be
more than ten dollars. Small change for car fare and for a sandwich
for his lunch and the money for the license. Perhaps the girl would
expect to pay for it, but Jamie could not quite endure the thought
of a woman paying for his marriage license. After all, if he stood
up and married the girl, it was his wedding, the only wedding he
would ever have probably, and he meant to have it in appropriate
and decent clothing, even if he borrowed the clothing, and he meant
to pay for his wedding even if he borrowed the money. If he had not
stayed there and taken care of the bees, someone would have been
asked to do it who would have been paid, and when his first
earnings were handed to him he could return the ten dollars. He had
borrowed that amount.</p>

<p>But about a little thin engraved circlet of gold that looked as
if it might fit a woman's finger, about that little ring that he
had run across among the Bee Master's collar buttons and small
belongings&mdash;He had it. He had it in his vest pocket. It might
be a souvenir; it might be something precious; it might be that
there was nothing among the effects of the Bee Master more dear to
him. He had not at all made up his mind as to whether he might use
it or not, but, at any rate, he had it in his pocket. He was
fortified with the clothing and the price and the ring, if he
should bring himself to use it.</p>

<p>Then a thought appealed to him. There was a bare possibility
that he could materialize his thought, and so he consulted the
motorman, and after making several changes, landed before the old
Court House with some minutes to spare. Hurriedly he made his way
to the Marriage License Bureau on the main floor. He told the Clerk
he was expecting to be there shortly with a young lady to secure a
marriage license and he asked about the expense, and found to his
relief that he had more than enough money. Then with all the haste
compatible with the state of his knees, he left the Court House and
regained the street. He looked around him, up and down and across,
and in that survey he located a jewellery store.</p>

<p>It appealed to him as modest in appearance, so he walked in and
faced a clerk across a case filled with rings. He laid the money he
could spare on the counter and said: "Could you furnish me with a
very plain, simple ring for that amount?"</p>

<p>The clerk had not been accustomed to furnishing rings for that
amount of money, but he was of Hebraic origin; he was shrewd; he
realized that the money on the counter was all the money the man
before him intended to spend. If he did not take it he would not
have it. So, after some hunting, he found a ring that Jamie thought
would be the right size. It looked fairly satisfactory, so the
Hebraic gentleman had the money and Jamie had the ring. He took the
shining band of gold that he had borrowed from the Master and
transferred it to a left-hand pocket of the vest he was wearing,
and in the right-hand pocket, convenient to his fingers, he slipped
the circlet, that at least had the merit of shining.</p>

<p>Then he headed back for the Court House, and as he stepped into
the office, he faced a woman whom he knew instantly. He knew her
height; he knew her eyes; he knew without knowing exactly how or
why he knew. He was a bridegroom, but the woman he was facing was
not a bride. She was a widow, if any story were to be told by her
clothing. From head to foot the Storm Girl was in deep mourning. A
tight, small hat fitted her head and was pulled so low that he
could only see a gleam of the eyes that he had been positive in the
lightning's flare were either black or brown. The office lights
revealed them brown&mdash;gray-brown. The baffling thing about the
costume the girl wore was a veil. He would have called it a widow's
veil. It was thick; it was black; a broad satin band finished the
edges. The band covered the mouth and chin; the hat shaded the eyes
and a mask-like gleam of eye and a line across the cheek and nose
were all Jamie was permitted to see of his prospective bride.</p>

<p>For a minute he experienced a sense of shock, and then he
realized that in some manner death figured in the ad venture he was
embarking on that day. The girl was in mourning. Possibly, after
all, the man whose place he was taking was a dead man who might
have fulfilled his obligations if he had been granted the
opportunity; but, at any rate, the girl had distinctly said that
she must be rescued from shame. So if a dead man figured in the
case, he hadn't been very much of a man, and it was shameful that
he had left the marriage ceremony to any chance of disaster.</p>

<p>These things were tearing through Jamie's brain swift as light
flashes, while Jamie himself lifted the Bee Master's hat and
brought his own heels together and presented a figure that would at
least have been worthy of consideration by any woman. His hasty
rush after the ring that was to save his self-respect, that was to
put a crowning touch of pride on his only wedding, had set his
heart pumping unduly, and so his cheeks were not so white as they
had been, his lips were not so blue. A flush of red had surged to
his face and he looked very much as any lean, self-respecting,
well-dressed man of Scottish origin and American birth and training
might be expected to appear. From force of habit, as he
straightened from his bow, Jamie extended his hand and recognized
the touch of the hand that met his, and then he lined up shoulder
to shoulder and said casually: "We figured time from the same
watch, didn't we?"</p>

<p>The girl beside him merely assented. Jamie took charge of
proceedings with all the self-assurance of a man who was accustomed
to captaining his own affairs. What ever the woman beside him was
getting out of this, Jamie had made up his mind that he was going
to get a wedding, and it was going to be his own. He took the arm
of the girl beside him and piloted her to the Clerk's desk. Whether
she had the correct impression now or not, Jamie did not know, but
he proposed that when she got through with that wedding and went
her way with the ring and the certificate that were to save her
self-respect, she should, at least, go in the belief that she had
married a man. He had forgotten all about telling her that very
shortly he would not be a man; he intended for the few minutes that
were to come to be all man.</p>

<p>So he impelled her to the Clerk and announced that they wanted
to fill the forms necessary to procure a marriage license. While
Jamie wrote down the names of his father and mother and the date of
his birth and his residence and his occupation and all the things
required, beside him stood a tall, self-reliant girl, who was
filling in the blank that had been given her. When these documents
were filled out as the law required, to keep the Storm Girl firm in
the impression that he was a man of his word, Jamie picked them up
and signed first, then handed them to her for her signature. When
the Clerk finished his share of the proceeding and offered the long
envelope to Jamie, he waved toward the girl he was marrying and the
Clerk gave her the document. They were directed to the office of
the Probate Judge and it was not any time at all until the
necessary papers were signed, sealed, and delivered to Jamie, who,
without one glance of examination, handed them to the Storm Girl.
Jamie paid the fee and walked beside her to the street without
knowing even the surname of the woman he had married. She might be
either Smith, Jones, or Brown. It was ridiculous, but it was true
that the touch of a hand, a strip of white face decorated with dark
eyes, and "I, Alice Louise, take thee, James Lewis, to be my lawful
and wedded husband," were all the in formation he had.</p>

<p>So he had married "Alice Louise." He was not particularly well
satisfied with the name. She did not look like Alice, and she did
not the least in the world resemble Louise. He had known Louises by
the dozen all his life, and they always had light hair; always they
had blue eyes, and they were always clinging, dependent little
things. Never since he could remember had he known of a woman who
could touch shoulders with a six-foot man and carry her head like
an empress, who extended a hand mighty near as big as, evidently
firmer than, his own, and in a voice of mellow contralto from away
down in a deep chest answer to the name of Louise!</p>

<p>Jamie cupped his hand around the elbow of Alice Louise merely to
show her that he considered himself enough of a man to take care of
her in case she needed him, and he piloted her to the street, and
there, standing on the sidewalk, for the first time they looked at
each other. Jamie deliberately waited to see what the lady had to
say; and as he waited, with concentrated vision, he strove to
pierce that crow-black costume and fix in his memory the form and
all he could see of the face of the woman before him.</p>

<p>He had given his word that he would not seek her, and he was not
any too sure that he was going to keep that word. He was not any
too sure that he was not going to know who she was, and where she
lived, and why she had used him to ease her heart and her
conscience, to save her body from the ocean. As he awaited, looking
straight into the face of the girl opposite him, he saw that the
muscles of the cheeks and the lips were all in a quiver and that
the steady stare of the eyes looking into his was going to dissolve
any minute in an uncontrollable gush of tears. Tears did the same
thing to Jamie that they do to any man when an attractive woman
admits she is facing some thing that is too much for her, that she
needs his help. He had intended to force her to speak, and the
first thing he knew he was no longer facing her. He had stepped
beside her and he was saying to her in low tones: "Steady yourself!
You'll be all right in a few minutes. Are you taking the car at
this corner?"</p>

<p>She had merely nodded in assent, and still with her elbow in his
palm, Jamie piloted her through the crowds and helped her on a
street car, and the people surged be tween them. As he saw her
enter the car and make her way to a seat, he realized that "Alice
Louise" and "I do" were all that he had heard her say. He had not
kept his determination to force her to speak. He had felt so sorry
for her when he realized she was near a breakdown he had spared
her. Anyway, he had shown her that he was a man who could run his
own affairs. He had helped her to a street car and away from him.
He could not honourably board the same car. So he stepped back,
raised his hat, lifted his chin and looked at the car, on a bare
chance that she might glance his way before the car started and
carried her from sight.</p>

<p>Then Jamie put on his hat and regained the sidewalk and said to
himself in not very pleasant tones: "Well, can you beat that?"</p>

<p>He had not expected much, but he had expected a word or two, and
not only had the words not been spoken, but the lady herself had
not even turned her head to see whether he was going to take the
same car or not. She had walked down the aisle, taken her seat with
her back toward him, and sat immovable until she was carried from
sight. It did not avail much that he might see what car she had
taken or in which direction she went. She might take any car and
she might leave it in a block or two in order to use the speediest
opportunity to escape him. She had gone away Mrs. James Lewis
MacFarlane with the necessary credentials and the ring he had
produced at the proper moment for a finger that had hesitated to
receive it; now he was left standing on the sidewalk and the best
thing for him to do was to see how soon he could reach home and
restore the Bee Master's wardrobe to its accustomed place. He had
been a bridegroom and there was nothing to it, not even "Thank
you." If he wanted to extract any romance whatever, he would have
to get it from the salty kisses that had swept his face the
previous night. And, being honest, he had to admit that if the rock
upon which they had sat had been the means of the girl's salvation,
she probably would have kissed it with as much, or possibly more,
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Jamie stood on the sidewalk and waited for his knees to stiffen
slightly before he began searching for the car he required to carry
him back to the garden of the bees. When he found it and boarded it
and sank into a seat, he said to all and sundry: "Well, of all the
darned weddings!" He knew that he said it because he heard the
words, but nobody else seemed to have heard them because everybody
was interested in their papers and their friends and where they
were going.</p>

<p>So Jamie went back to the house and returned the borrowed
raiment and assumed his own. Then he went out in the sunshine and
sat down to think things over. He had half a mind to tell Margaret
Cameron that this was his wedding day and she might prepare him any
kind of a feast she saw fit to offer for such an occasion. A wry
grin crossed his cheeks when he thought of the look that would come
on her face if he told her that, and then she would speak and she
would ask where his bride was; and where his bride was happened to
be a secret and the business of the bride herself. He reflected
that if she was where she had been at midnight the previous night,
she would not be so very far from him at the present minute. He was
assailed by an impulse to go down and walk up and down the beach,
to scan each house accessible from the shore line to see whether in
any of them there was visible a glimpse of a girl clad in the
deepest kind of mourning.</p>

<p>How much that mourning meant, Jamie could not decide. He
remembered that the girl had offered to begin at the beginning and
tell him the story. It had been he who had told her to use a few
words, merely to state what she wanted. If she had been as full of
Scottish blood as he, she could not have taken him at his word more
quickly or more completely. She had stated the bald facts and he,
Jamie reflected, with another twisted grin, had materialized the
facts. The lady had said that she needed a ring, a marriage
certificate and a name, and she had stood beside him, she had
allowed the ring to be put on her finger, she had taken possession
of the certificate. One thing he did recall. She had laid the
document on her breast and folded both hands over it and held it
there as if nothing in all the world could be more precious to her.
And his name. At least she had accepted it in marriage whether she
meant to use it or not.</p>

<p>Jamie felt something of a fool that he had not at least
stretched out his hand and picked up the record the girl had
written and read it. He had not been much of a man and he had not
managed his own wedding in his own way quite as he had thought that
he would. It all harked back to the fact that he had given a
promise, that he had said that he would not intrude himself, he
would make no effort to find her. He had said that he would be
content merely to offer what assistance he could and the amount and
kind of assistance that the girl required had been very clearly
specified to him. He had accepted the bargain. He had gone through
with it. The thing to do now was to go out on the back porch, put
on the Bee Master's old bee coat, raid the lily and the cinnamon
pink beds, and while his body was free from the taint of surgical
dressing, go down and face the Black Germans and find out for
himself whether he was bee immune for sure. It was a piece of
knowledge that he wanted to have before the little Scout put in
another appearance.</p>

<p>So Jamie donned the coat and applied the lily and wiped his head
through the pinks and slowly, deliberately, with as much assurance
of step as he could assume, he made the long march down the east
line, pausing before hive after hive of bees, looking at the tiny
things that were coming and going so busily on humming wings,
realizing that he did not know a drone from a worker, a nurse from
a queen.</p>

<p>He resolved, as he stood before one of the hives, that when
Doctor Grayson called him that evening for his daily report, he
would ask how soon now it would be possible for him to see the Bee
Master for a very few minutes, and he would ask how long it was
probable that he was going to remain in the hospital. Then he
reflected that if he had not been called yet to see the Bee Master
there was every chance that he was so weak and so ill that he might
be away a matter of weeks, possibly of months. Besides, bees were
very closely related to trees and what the little Scout had pointed
out to him of bee lore was so alluring that he might as well go
deeper; he might as well read some of the technical books and see
what they contained. It was going to be some time yet before his
fate was decided, and in that time possibly there was nothing more
interesting, nothing more useful that would come within his
possibilities to which he could turn his attention than just
bees.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2200541h-images/Jamie-doing-his-best.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Jamie, doing his best on "Highland Mary," went
slowly the round of the hives</p>

<p>So Jamie, doing his best on "Highland Mary," went slowly the
round of the hives and as he turned up the back walk and sighted
the big hive of the Black Germans, he remembered something else. He
hunted for the water tap around which grew the mint. He pulled a
handful of it and rubbed it over his trousers and over his sleeves
and crushed it in his hands, and then, doing his best on the tune
prescribed, he slowly approached the Black Germans. He planted
himself in front of their first hive. He stood there as long as he
pleased. He knelt down and peered into the opening. He studied them
so intently that he realized that they lacked the gold of the
Italians. They were of different shape. When he slowly walked away,
he felt that the next person who asked him if he were bee immune
might safely be given an affirmative answer. He believed that the
next time a bee alighted on a flower be fore him he would at least
be able to say whether it was an Italian or a Black German.</p>

<p>He so disliked the name that he told himself as he climbed the
back walk that if those bees belonged to him, he truly would pick
up the hives of the Black Germans and carry them down and pitch
them into the Pacific Ocean. He would not have anything called a
Black Ger man, not even a bee, where it was a daily reminder of
what true Black Germans had done to men of his father's race and
country, to men who carried his same blood in their veins. Of
course, it was silly to carry the loathing con tempt he felt for a
race of men into his feeling for a hive of bees. It was not very
sensible, but Jamie reflected as he slowly climbed the walk, eating
a big red tomato that he had picked from a vine he passed, that
there was not much reason to most of our likes and dislikes in this
world. What we liked was so a matter of individual preference, and
preference was so controlled by the manner in which one had been
reared, by environment, by individual taste, that necessarily there
had to be a wide range given to personal preference.</p>

<p>Jamie wiped his fingers and threw the core of the tomato as far
as he could fling it down the mountain-side and went into the
house. On the back porch he changed to his own coat, and entered
the living room to select the particular book he intended to read,
with two thoughts foremost in his mind. His tenure of the Bee
Master's garden had resulted in three things: He was a bridegroom;
he knew a Black German bee from an Italian; and he had found out
that there was something particularly and peculiarly satisfying
about a big, dead-ripe tomato. He would try that tomato stunt
between meals every day. The fruit slid down his throat and landed
in his stomach with a sort of cooling, refreshing effect that was
better than any glass of wine he had ever taken. There was no heat
about it, no forced stimulation. It did the work and felt wonderful
where it was and left an urgent invitation for more.</p>

<p>So the bridegroom stood before the small writing desk and,
opening the case above it, ran an investigating finger over the
titles of many books. Then he selected one and dropped into the
chair that he had decided to use as his own and tried to
concentrate all the mentality he had upon the subject of what is
necessary for the beginner who would keep bees. He found himself
reading paragraph after paragraph about proper hives and comb cases
and smokers and all sorts of paraphernalia that he could find in a
big case on the back porch if he opened it and knew what to look
for. His eyes were reading the words and his brain was fixing with
unbelievable stubbornness&mdash;which, after all, was not so
unbelievable in a man of Scottish ancestry&mdash;his brain would
persist in dwelling on a surprised hand that had drawn back and
then advanced to be decorated with a wedding ring, on a marriage
certificate that had been held tight against a breast that looked
capable and immensely attractive. Then his brain would focus on a
pair of keen brown eyes bespeaking nerve strain to the limit. His
brain would keep making his eyes see quivering lips and twitching
cheek muscles.</p>

<p>The thing he had done was going to stay with him for a while. He
was not going to be able to put it aside and concentrate his
thought on anything, not even a thing as interesting as the little
Scout had said bees were. He truly did want to get on with a real
bee book. That about bee nurses. Who would train a bee to become a
nurse? Were bees sick? Did they need nurses? Did they sting each
other and have wounds that would not heal on their small anatomies?
He must find out about that speedily, but he could not find out
about it at that minute because he had a number of things that were
forcing him to think about them. And these things were, after all,
important. You could not alter the fact that events had put him
legally in a position where he was a married man, and you could not
alter the fact that an immensely attractive woman had stood beside
him and put herself in a position where she was legally a married
woman; and there was not any reason why he should try to get away
from the fact that she would be of much more use to the world, to
her family, to a nebulous little person, as she stood, even in her
black dress, in enforced composure, than she would have been as a
formless thing wasted by an under tow leagues away and worried to
the bone by the lean hounds of the sea. To have saved the life of a
woman like that was worth thinking of. He had thought last night
that it might be the one worth-while thing that he could do before
the end. Since he had nothing else to do, and since it would
intrude, he could not very well be blamed for thinking about it.
Evidently no one else was going to think about it. He <i>had</i>
coveted a word. He had not received even a "Thank you." But that
was all right. He did not ask or expect anything.</p>

<p>Right there Jamie closed the book with his finger in the place
and went to open his front door. A messenger boy handed him a
parcel and a letter and disappeared with such miraculous swiftness
that there was no conclusion left for Jamie except that he had been
told to make his delivery and also to see how speedily he could
vanish.</p>

<p>Jamie laid down the book without looking to see what page he had
been reading on, and slipped the letter from the band that held the
small oblong box in his fingers. With the letter in one hand and
the box in the other he contemplated them. He studied them. He
turned them over and around, and he caught an odour emanating from
the box that he knew.</p>

<p>Before he opened it, he recognized what he would see. He was
sufficiently sensitive to odours that his brain told him, even as
his fingers worked to confirm the message, that when he slipped the
paper and lifted the lid of the size of box that florists used for
violets, he would find a big bunch of the pinkish lavender flower
that grew on the sand bordering the Pacific Ocean. Now he
<i>would</i> get the flower book. And when he got it, as he did
later, he learned to know sand verbena by its real name, and he
learned that the six-o'clock odour of this flower is perhaps as
sweet a scent as can delight the nostrils of any lover of
evanescent perfume. He lifted the delicate blooms and hunted
through the Master's belongings until he found a little bowl of
antique copper, and this he filled with water, and into the water
he carefully put the flowers.</p>

<p>Then he took the letter and sat down in the chair and slowly and
deliberately broke the seal. Again Jamie felt that he knew exactly
what he was going to see. The thing that the eyes and lips had been
unable to say because the effort of speech would unlock a floodgate
of tears, that thing had been written. So he was not in the least
surprised, but to the depths of his heart he was pleased, when he
raised the flap of the heavy oblong envelope and extracted an
equally heavy sheet of paper that he unfolded to read:</p>

<p class="letter">My dear Mr. MacFarlane:<br>
<br>
The reason I left you without saying one word, without one backward
look, was from the physical necessity of keeping my lips tight shut
and my eyes wide open in order that I might not attract the
attention of passers-by and humiliate you by making a scene before
people.<br>
<br>
I want you to know that what you did for me has given me life, the
chance to go on with my work with the same prideful assurance I
always have taken in it. You have eased the heart of a woman who
was slowly dying from fear and anxiety.<br>
<br>
All my life I shall thank you for your kindness of last night, for
your unparalleled act of to-day. If you are correct in your
statement that you have not much time, believe this, that every
night before I go to bed I shall ask God to extend to you His
utmost clemency, the deepest depth and the highest height of His
mercy.<br>
<br>
It is quite impossible that I should voice adequate thanks for what
you did for me, and now I find that it is equally impossible to
write anything on this paper that will come any nearer ex pressing
my sincere thanks for the obligation to you under which I find
myself. With all my heart I do thank you, and I hope that God will
bless you and keep you. I hope that you may be mistaken and that
there may be a long and happy life in store for you.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen lines ahead of it, Jamie got it, and it hit him in
the face like a blow. It was written there in a firm, beautifully
legible hand, just such writing as Jamie had imagined the hand that
he had held last night and had seen in operation that afternoon,
would write:</p>

<p class="letter">With undying obligations,<br>
Alice Louise MacFarlane.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned!" said Jamie. "Can you beat it? Is she
really going to take my name? Is she really going to use it in some
kind of business? Is she really going to bring a child into the
world and call it 'MacFarlane'?"</p>

<p>Then Jamie began the process of reading the letter again, and it
was not long until he could have repeated it a word at a time
backward. Just why he kept getting it out and holding it in his
fingers and turning it over and examining the paper and studying
the script, he did not know. It was wonderful, it was right, it was
all his heart could have asked. It sounded exactly like the girl
who was just the height, who had the strength of body, who had the
mane of silken hair, who had the keen brown eyes, who had the firm
breasts, the capable hands, the mellow, luring voice, that Jamie
always had imagined would be exactly what he would want when he met
the woman who would be the one woman of all the world to him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. Vltamines and Scouts</h2>

<p>The last thing at night Jamie again read his letter. He opened
the envelope and unfolded the sheet, very carefully scrutinizing
each written word. It was not in the least necessary that he should
do this in order to know the contents of the letter. Some way he
liked the feel of the paper in his fingers. If he had been buying
stationery for the Storm Woman, who had stood shoulder to shoulder
with him during an official marriage ceremony, he would have bought
that kind of paper. He thought very likely that he would have been
willing to stake a small wager on the fact that this particular
woman <i>would</i> use green ink. A woman who carried about her a
distinct odour of sage and of sand verbena and primroses would use
green ink. He thought that a hand such as he had held would fashion
the letters of the alphabet as they were fashioned in his letter.
He thought that she would express herself clearly, tersely, and in
excellent English such as had been used.</p>

<p>As he read it and re-read it and repeated it from memory when he
was busy with the watering or occupying his hands with something
that prevented him from taking it from his pocket lest he soil it,
a doubt began to spring in his mind. The doubt had not the
slightest reference to the girl who had written the letter. What he
was vaguely beginning to distrust was his own judgment. He could
not quite couple the feel of the woman he had held in his arms, the
tones of her voice, the silken length of her hair, the agony of her
cold, salt-encrusted face laid against his; he could not quite
couple the brow and the eyes, the wide mouth and the firm chin that
the meagre lightning flashes had revealed; he could not couple the
quivering lips and the twitching cheeks and the tear-suppressing
eyes with dishonour. He could not quite keep on, day after day,
hour after hour, thinking over and over each least detail of his
latest adventure and feel that this nameless, troubled girl was
wanton. The real truth was that he did not want her to have been
soiled. He did not want unbridled emotion ever to have swayed her.
He did not want to feel that there was anywhere in all the world a
man who could sully her honour. Sometimes he tried to figure on
what manner of man it was that could have brought such trouble into
the life of a girl who so filled his conception of exactly what a
girl should be. He kept thinking about what a wonderful companion
she would make; what a journey along the trail through the canyon
of hurrying water would mean with her for a comrade.</p>

<p>Without the slightest knowledge of what had happened to him,
Jamie's thoughts had taken a new turn. When he awoke in the night
and shifted his position to rest his wounded side, he answered the
demands of pain and immediately fell to thinking of the Storm
Girl.</p>

<p>It probably would not be a debatable question with doctors as to
whether Jamie's journey and his subsequent experiences were the
best thing for a sick man. From their books, from their teachings,
from their practice, they would simply know that such an experience
would kill a man in Jamie's condition, and Jamie, in the little
ones and twos of the night, stretched his long frame on the Bee
Master's bed, moved either leg and either arm and twisted his spine
and felt that the soreness had thoroughly gone out of him. The pain
of the long march had left his feet and legs; his hands and arms
seemed to have sufficient strength for one day more. Then his
attention was attracted by the rhythmical sweep of the waves as
they came washing up the sands below his window and rolled back to
the mother of big waters again.</p>

<p>Jamie turned his head and listened to the song of the Pacific
Ocean. He decided that there was a reason why it had been called
the Pacific Ocean, the peaceful ocean. From the window beside which
he lay, his vision carried for miles across the moon-silvered
water, water so calm that it was scarcely ruffled by the waves that
kept it in undulation almost as regular as breathing. Just when
Jamie had decided that the Pacific Ocean had been well named he
remembered the Storm Girl. That recalled to his mind the storm and
he reflected further that perhaps the ocean was like a woman, that
it was the still waters that ran deep; that after many days of
peace, when the storm finally came, it really was a storm to make
even the God of Storms look down and take notice.</p>

<p>The thing that a doctor never could or would have figured on
about the entire circumstance was the thing that happened.
Breathing in unison with the sweep of the waves, Jamie very shortly
went to sleep again. His last conscious thought was not about
himself. It was a com mingling of lazy, sunlit waves, a feeling of
being drawn somewhere by a rope of hair across his face. He went
over the top into dreamland in imagination clutching a letter in
one hand, and in the final drop into unconsciousness, the last
thought that he sensed in his brain had something to do with a
bathing suit and a gorgeous big red tomato.</p>

<p>When Margaret Cameron finished dusting and entered the kitchen
to gather up the dishes from which Jamie had eaten his breakfast,
she found that long, lean individual sitting at the table and
looking at her speculatively. There was a question in his eyes, a
humorous quirk around his mouth. His fingers were drumming the
table. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Margaret Cameron," he asked, "are you a lady?"</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron took hold of a wooden chair back, and leaning
forward, studied Jamie intently, but she answered him quietly and
readily enough:</p>

<p>"I try to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean," said Jamie, "have you got a long line of
highly bred ancestors; are you skilled in the fine arts of society;
do you wear exquisite clothing and live a life of elegant leisure.
What I want to know, to put it briefly and bluntly, is, would you
faint at the sight of a drop of blood, if it happened to be human
blood?"</p>

<p>Margaret swung a chair around and sat down on it.</p>

<p>"Can't you manage your dressings?" she asked, quietly. It was
Jamie's turn to be disconcerted.</p>

<p>"You know," said Margaret, "when you bend over to reach the hose
and going through the garden, the bandages across your back and the
straps over your shoulders show, and they look to me to be
cumbersome things. I've wanted to speak to you for a week. I
believe I could take some unbleached muslin and make a kind of
jacket and fold some supports across your shoulders that would hold
it up exactly as well and not be half so uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Jamie sat silently staring at her.</p>

<p>At last he said:</p>

<p>"I think what I had in my mind was this: I was going to ask you,
if you could stomach it, if you would take one good look at a
decoration I wear on my left breast, and then I thought I'd go to
work and put a kind of schedule that I've thought out for myself
into practice for, say one month; and then I'd ask you if you would
look again and see if I'd done any good. I've got a shrapnel wound
and it must have been particularly filthy shrapnel. It carried with
it some sort of damnable poison that defied the best doctors at the
base hospitals and passed me on to London and then to this country
and clear across the continent. I've had a year of boiling in hot
water and fussing with nurses and doctors and I'm worse than I was
when I began their treatment. Just as a little secret between you
and me, I'll tell you this. They were going to put me in a
tuberculosis place when they knew and admitted I didn't have
tuberculosis yet, and I wouldn't stand for it. I got up and walked
out, and I've come this far. From the minute I started, and for
long before, when that hot, chemically saturated boiling spring
water soaked into me, I couldn't help feeling that it was fostering
germs and breeding more. For six months I've wakened in the night
thinking about the sea, and I'd gotten to the place where, when I
decided to walk out, I headed for a cooler spot and for the ocean.
Now I've gotten here and I've made up my mind that I'm going to try
it. I want to go over a list of food with you; I want you to cook
me plain, simple, nourishing stuff, some thing that's got iron in
it, something that will have a tendency to purify and to clean up
blood saturated with poison.</p>

<p>"When I finish my morning rounds with the bees, I am going to
put on that bathing suit at the back door; I am going down the back
walk and I'm going to squeeze a tumbler level full of the juice of
a couple of those big red tomatoes and drink it, and then I'm going
on down to the sea and I am going in mighty close to the edge of
those bandages. I'm not so sure that I am not going heels over.
Then I'm coming out and I'm going to lie on the hottest sand in the
hottest stretch of sun I can find and cover the bare parts until I
get toughened enough that I won't blister. I'm going to let the sun
dry that salt water into my anatomy, I'm not going to rinse it off.
Then I'm coming up and eat whatever you prepare for me in the kind
of combinations we agree on that will go toward the making of a
man. Then I'm going to take a nap. Then I'm going to get up and
drink a glass of orange juice. Then I'm going to go out in the
garden and see what I can do for the flowers. There are some dead
leaves on the lilies that need to come off and there are some that
need propping. I could clip the seed pods from the roses that have
bloomed to help keep up the succession. I can find a world of
things to do. Then we will arrange a dinner that will have at least
a tendency to be what you might call a gesture in the direction of
making a real man out of particularly big bones and peculiarly
flabby muscle. I'm going to walk down to a place on the beach that
I call the throne and I am going to sit there, and thoroughly
wrapped in the Master's eiderdown dressing robe and his old working
overcoat on top of it so that I cannot possibly chill, I am going
to breathe fog and mist and salt water until my tongue tastes salty
in my mouth. I am going to lie down there and go to sleep, if I
take the notion."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Jamie," she said, "you're all right up to that
point, but you had better cut that right out. You had better not
try sleeping outdoors in fog and mist. Maybe it's all right to go
and breathe it for an hour, but don't go to sleep and let your
circulation run down and the fog settle over you and wet you and
chill you to the bone. That's a wrong idea. Change that part of
your programme, and as for the rest, I'll think hard all day, and
you think hard, and this evening we'll talk it over and see if we
cannot make out the menu you want to follow. You try with all your
might and I'll try with all my might and we'll see what we can do,
with the help of the good God and all outdoors, to put you on your
feet. Now, come on, let's have a look at that sick side of
yours."</p>

<p>So Jamie stretched himself on the bed and uncovered his breast.
Margaret Cameron, bending over him, could feel the blood slowly
receding from her face.</p>

<p>"My, but that's an angry wound!" she said, at last. "The flesh
looks as if it had been burned. It's almost angry enough for what
we used to call 'proud' flesh. And it is deep and it's wide."</p>

<p>She stood staring an instant. Then she shifted her eyes to
Jamie's. "Are you good for a strenuous diet and a stiff pull?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"If you mean have I got the courage, yes," said Jamie. "If you
mean have I got the strength or have I got a chance&mdash;I don't
know. All I know is that I am going in the ocean. All I know is
that I am going to soak in sun shine. All I know is that I am going
to be a calamity to the tomato patch. Why I want these things, I
don't know. But I am ravenous for all of them, and since they are
here, why shouldn't I have them?"</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that tomato idea?" asked Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>"I ate one yesterday and it seemed to fill a long-felt want. It
seemed to hit the exact spot. I had a feeling that it was cleansing
and cooling. I got the idea that if I'd squeeze the juice from a
couple of them and drink it at a time when my stomach is empty, it
might do something for me from the <i>interior out</i>, that
medicines and boiling springs have not accomplished."</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing," said Margaret Cameron, "but there may be
something in it. There's a housekeeping magazine I take that has a
health department in it that I have been reading for several years,
and in the last year or two they have been stressing nothing in all
the world but just the thing you have hit on. Just tomatoes. I
didn't think I'd ever pay much attention to what the little Scout
would call 'bunk' about vitamines and calories and the like, but
the other day something funny happened to me. I went down to the
city to do some shopping and to have a visit with a niece of mine
who teaches in the schools there and she took me to lunch in a
lovely big room in one of those enormous department stores. At a
table right adjoining us there sat a woman whose name Molly
whispered to me across the table, and I remembered that wherever
English is spoken all over the world her songs are sung. She had a
noble face, a kindly face, an intelligent face. I couldn't keep my
eyes from the efficiency of her hands, and the beauty and
individuality of her clothes. With her there was a little dumpling
of a girl. You couldn't imagine anything healthier; you couldn't
imagine anything prettier or more appealing. At one time when I was
feasting my eyes on the child, because she reminded me so of my own
girl when she was a little roly-poly thing like that, just when I
was looking straight at her, with her spoon poised halfway to her
mouth and her eyes very serious, she asked, 'Grandma, how many
calorith ith there in thith jello?'</p>

<p>"And 'Grandma' threw back her head and laughed until half the
diners in the room looked in her direction. Then she took off her
glasses and wiped her eyes and said, 'Lord love you, child, your
old Grandma wouldn't know a calory from a calumet! You'll have to
ask your up-to-date mother.'</p>

<p>"Then the youngster laid down her spoon and announced very
positively, 'I can't eat thith jello leth I know if it's got the
right number of calorith!'</p>

<p>"And the white-haired lady answered, 'Well, my dear, I am a
pretty good physical specimen myself, and I've gotten along all my
life without knowing whether I was eating calories or vitamines or
rattlesnakes. I just go ahead and eat food that is what I want and
tastes right and nothing happens to me. There won't anything hap
pen to you if you eat what you want for one day while you are
lunching with me, and to-morrow Mother can tell you whatever it is
that you want to know.'</p>

<p>"The baby thought that over and then she said cheerfully, 'All
right. I'll dust eat it and thee what it doth to me! Maybe it will
reduthe my hipths. Don't you think they sthick out a little too
much?'</p>

<p>"I looked at the little person carefully. She had the brightest
eyes and the finest skin. You could see away down into her cheeks.
Her lips were so red and her flesh looked so firm that I thought to
myself, 'Well, whatever calories and vitamines may be, they have
certainly done very perfect work on you. If I were your mother, I'd
keep you right straight on the path you're going.'</p>

<p>"I asked Molly something about it and she tells me that she
broke down a little with her school work last year and she took a
trip to Denver. There she heard about a doctor who cures everything
that ails you with what you eat. The idea seems to be that there
are certain food combinations that you can't safely mix. The point
Molly brought out was that the great American breakfast, eggs and
toast and bacon and coffee, is about a deadly combination. Molly
said that doctor proved that the yeast of bread and the albumen of
egg and the fat of bacon and what caffeine you get in coffee would
kill a guinea pig in short order. It seems that you may eat all the
eggs you want cooked any conceivable way, but you must not take
them in combination with the yeast of bread and the acids of meat.
You may eat all the starch you please at one meal; but you must not
take it in combination with the acids of meat or albumen. You must
keep the bread and potatoes and starchy things confined to one
meal. Then for dinner you may have any kind of meat you want; but
you must take it with vegetables that are not starchy. You must cut
off the bread, beans, potatoes, any starch. You must confine the
desserts to fruits and jellos and leave out the pastry. It is
simple; it is easy. Merely a slightly different arrangement in
combinations of the same things you have been eating all your life.
But Molly says it makes all the difference in the world. She's been
trying it for a year and she says her flesh is so hard and her
muscles work so fine, and her brain functions better and she
doesn't know she has a stomach. She thinks it's wonderful. What I
am going to do is to make a point of seeing her and get her to
write out the combinations and then I am going to try them on
myself and I can try them on you at the same time. And on your own
hook you can try the sand and sunshine and the salt water and the
sea fog and the tomato and oranges and we'll see how we come
out."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Jamie, "it will be more interesting to put
in time planning a fight to live than to spend months moping around
figuring on how soon I am going to die. In the meantime, if you
would be so good as to fix up that arrangement you talked about for
bandaging, I'd be very grateful. If I could get out of the weight
of all this harness, I'd almost feel as if I'd been redeemed
spiritually as well as physically."</p>

<p>So Margaret went home to bring her sewing basket and her
measuring tape, and Jamie sat on a chair while she took his
measurement for the length and width the band ages need be and
figured on the shoulder straps to support them. Then Jamie returned
to his work.</p>

<p>At exactly ten o'clock he came up the back walk and selected two
of the biggest, ripest tomatoes he could see on the Bee Master's
vines. He carried them to the kitchen and worked the juice from
them through a small round sieve he found hanging on the wall, and
when he had a tumbler overflowing, he lifted it and drank it with
the keenest relish.</p>

<p>"That certainly hits the spot!" he said.</p>

<p>Then, being Jamie, and his early rearing being ingrained, he
emptied the pulp into the sink basket and turned the faucet on the
sieve and when it was thoroughly cleaned, he wiped it on a towel
hanging above the sink and laid it in the sunshine of the window
sill to be quite sure that it dried thoroughly without rusting.
From the hook beside the door he took down the Master's bathing
suit, and going to his room, divested himself of his clothing and
stepped into the suit, and when he drew it up to button it over his
shoulders, he was not wearing anything by way of dressings for his
wound save a pad of gauze fastened in place with such binding as he
could secure from a face towel pinned with safety pins. His bare
shoulders felt wonderfully released. He was as elated as a woman
with a hair-cut.</p>

<p>In old slippers to protect his tender feet, and with an old
Indian blanket to keep his unaccustomed flesh from burning, and a
handful of towels, Jamie went down the back walk, travelling
slowly, out through the gate, and standing there he selected one
spot where the waves of the bay stretched before him looked
peculiarly clean and foamy white. Then he made his way between the
mounds of gold primrose and the verbena that waited for the cool of
the evening to show the loveliness of its face and to distil on the
air its delicate perfume.</p>

<p>Gingerly Jamie set his bare feet on the wet sand. Slowly he
advanced on the ocean. When the first cold waves broke over his
feet he could have shouted with delight. They were not nearly so
cold as he had imagined they would be. Only cold enough to give a
refreshing feeling of exhilaration. A little farther out, a little
farther out, he was in to his knees; then halfway to his waist;
then to a point where he began to feel top heavy, to realize that
he must either swim or go back. He could not feel that swimming was
exactly the thing he should undertake, so he contented himself for
the beginning with walking up and down at the greatest depth he
could manage and preserve his equilibrium. He could not always tell
exactly how the waves were going to run, and sometimes he stumbled
on an unseen rock. Once he fell headlong and felt a cold wave, half
of terror, half of delight, run through his blood while a colder
wave of salty water washed clear over him. He stumbled to his feet
and shook back his head. He reached down and scooped up handfuls of
water and rubbed it up and down his arms and over his shoulders. He
swung his long arms in it and kicked out his feet, and when he
found that he was panting, he walked out and, purposely, in the
cleanest, bluest place he could select, thoroughly immersed
himself. Then he arose and went back to his blanket. He arranged
it, and the towels he had brought, in such a way as to cover his
arms and legs and his head, and to leave his trunk clad with the
wet suit exposed, and he stretched himself on the hot sands and let
the sun of California come raying straight down until it dried the
salt water in the dressing pad and the suit into and around the
wound on his breast. The amazing thing was that it did not sting
nearly so badly as he had thought it would&mdash;nothing to compare
with the severity of many of the different dressings that had been
used until his flesh was cooked almost to the point where it would
endure no further punishment.</p>

<p>Jamie found himself saying: "Salt. Saline solution." It struck
him that he had heard of natives in uncivilized countries using
salt for the healing of wounds. He remembered institutions that
advertised salt baths. There must be something pretty fine about
salt used medicinally. Then he remembered that the little Scout had
told him that every gallon of water dipped from the Pacific Ocean
contained three and one half per cent, of salt.</p>

<p>When he had lain for an hour in the sun, Jamie got up and went
to his lunch, and afterward to twenty minutes on his feet in the
garden, and then a nap. Then he drank the juice of two ripe
oranges, drank it cool from the ice of the small refrigerator. It
struck him, as he closed the refrigerator, that it might be a good
idea to work up enough tomato juice to fill two or three glasses
and consign that to the ice so that he could have it cool. So he
went down to the garden and gathered the tomatoes and put that
thought into action.</p>

<p>It was while he was in the kitchen working with the tomatoes
that there came a rush of feet under the window and a bloodcurdling
series of yells broke on the air. Jamie dropped the tomato that he
had been using extreme care not to drop and muttered an exclamation
as he recovered it, drenched it under the faucet, and laid it on a
plate. Then he stepped to the back door to see what the commotion
might be.</p>

<p>Drawn up in front of him at a particularly erect angle and
pulling off as snappy a salute as he was accustomed to seeing
anywhere, stood the little Scout. Ranged along the walk there were
three children concerning whose sex there could not be the
slightest doubt.</p>

<p>The little Scout indicated the first youth in line.</p>

<p>"Eleven, possibly twelve," said Jamie to himself.</p>

<p>The introduction, accompanied by a wave of the hand, and a
flourish of a wooden sword, was this: "Fat Ole Bill!"</p>

<p>Jamie's quick eyes went to the face of the youngster. Fat Ole
Bill had not the slightest objection to being "Fat Ole Bill." He
grinned, did his best at a salute, and stepped aside.</p>

<p>The Scout Master waved a sword, and a boy&mdash;"Possibly ten,"
commented Jamie&mdash;a boy lean, slender, with olive skin and red
lips, with black hair and big liquid black eyes, a boy unusually
beautiful, stepped up, trimly saluted the Scout Master and then
Jamie. The introduction that accompanied him was, "Pa's and Ma's
Nice Child."</p>

<p>Again Jamie's eyes searched the face of the youngster, and it
was evident that the "Nice Child" did not give a darn what the
Scout Master called him.</p>

<p>The sword waved for the third time as the Nice Child stepped
aside and the next boy fell into line&mdash;"Possibly thirteen and
maybe fourteen," was Jamie's comment&mdash;a boy taller than either
of the others, with enough flesh amply to cover his bones, red
hair, blue eyes, and immaculate and unusually expensive and
carefully selected clothing. There was a peculiar arch to the boy's
lips, a slight projection of the teeth, a flock of dancing lights
shining in his eyes. The wooden sword waved a wide circle and
grounded. The red-haired youngster executed a salute for the Scout
Master so gracefully that it was a picture to see. His heels drew
together, his chin lifted, his shoulders squared. The salute was
wonderful. The Scout Master waved him on to Jamie with the
introduction, "Angel Face."</p>

<p>For the third time Jamie looked inquiringly and dis covered that
Angel Face was so accustomed to the title that he probably would
have been annoyed if it had not been used.</p>

<p>Then, with little gray points of malice in his eyes, Jamie
squared his shoulders and executed a for-sure, honest-to-goodness,
four years in a bleedingly bloody war salute for the youngsters,
and all of them pricked up their ears and recognized the real thing
when they saw it.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Scout Company," said Jamie, "I am exceedingly
gratified to be introduced to you. No doubt the Bee Master has been
accustomed to welcoming you in his garden. In his absence, I extend
the same welcome." He turned to Angel Face. "Would you be good
enough," he said, "to give me an introduction to the Scout
Master?"</p>

<p>The red-haired boy opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>"The Scout Master knows you!" he said, defiantly.</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Jamie. "The trouble with me is that I don't know
the Scout Master."</p>

<p>At that minute a badly battered wooden sword circled through the
air.</p>

<p>"Attention! Scouts to order!"</p>

<p>The boys lined up and saluted beautifully.</p>

<p>"Ready!" came the order of the Master. "Tell the world the name
of your Scout Master!"</p>

<p>The boys squared themselves and paused ready. The eyes of each
of them were focused on the point of the sword.</p>

<p>"Altogether now!" said the Scout Master. The sword waved through
the air and in unison, at the tops of their voices, the boys began,
each letter bitten off with a snap that fairly hurled it in the
face of Jamie: "T-H-E, The. L-I-M-I-T, Limit The Limit!"</p>

<p>They saluted and dropped back and the Scout Master stepped
before Jamie, sheathed the sword, straightened the right hand down
the seam of the pantaloons, laid the left across the breast, and
the figure swayed forward in a profound bow. Jamie knew exactly as
much as he did at the beginning&mdash;slightly more, for he saw
that the Scouts really were obedient and really were well
trained.</p>

<p>Then the Scout Master addressed Jamie: "The Bee Master lets us
fight Indians here."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie. "Whatever he allowed goes with me."</p>

<p>The Scout Master turned to the Scouts.</p>

<p>"Disband!" came the sharp order. "Prepare for attack!"</p>

<p>Jamie looked the Scout Master over. He had no notion when the
Dutch bob had been brushed. It was ornamented with quite a
collection of the wild oats of California and a few small twigs and
leaves. The face might have been clean some time that morning. It
certainly was not clean then. He saw a different shirt, but equally
as dis reputable, and the same breeches and shoes that had been
worn on the first visit. The Scout Master marched down the length
of the walk, heading straight toward an opening in the whitewashed
board fence that separated the grounds of the Bee Master from those
of Margaret Cameron. Jamie watched while the right hand of the
Scout Master went into a protruding pocket and from a mass of
things that it contained selected a piece of red chalk. By that
time Jamie had taken a seat on the bench under the jacqueranda and
concentrated on the Scout Master. He had forgotten the Scouts. He
had even forgotten to wonder why they had disappeared and where
they went. With deft strokes, quick and sure, the Scout Master was
executing on the white painted fence, with sufficient skill that
the intention was recognizable, the figures of four Indians. The
first was limned as leaning forward peering ahead. The second was
more erect. The third faced front and the fourth followed.</p>

<p>When the Scout Master reached the girders to which the boards of
the fence were nailed, he merely lifted the chalk, made a line on
the edge, and dropped back again to the boards. By the time the
four figures were blocked in sufficiently to be recognized, the
Scout Master came back to Jamie and from a breast pocket of the
shirt produced a genuine police whistle through the ring of which a
leather string was knotted that passed around the neck. Lifting the
whistle, the little Scout blew a shrill note, and bounding past
bushes and over flowers, from different directions came the Scouts.
Each of them was armed with a gaudily trimmed bow, a leather quiver
on the back filled with crudely fashioned arrows. Most of the
arrows were roughly dressed splinters of wood.</p>

<p>The Scout Master saluted.</p>

<p>"Scout One, my weapons!"</p>

<p>The imperative command was instantly answered by Angel Face. He
saluted before the Scout Master and offered an extra bow and quiver
of arrows. Gravely, the arrow pouch was slung over the shoulder and
the strap fastened on the breast. Gravely, the bow was taken
possession of and the sword sheathed.</p>

<p>"Scout Two!"</p>

<p>Fat Ole Bill grinned the salute he could not make as he appeared
around a lilac bush his arm loaded with big, dead-ripe
tomatoes.</p>

<p>"Scout Two, advance and do your duty!" came the command, and Fat
Ole Bill waddled to the fence and set a big red tomato on the
girder exactly where the heart might have been supposed to be in
the anatomy of each crudely drawn Indian.</p>

<p>Then action began suddenly, whirlwind action. The Voice of the
Scout Master was shrill with excitement.</p>

<p>"Attention, Scouts! The Redskins are upon us. Our homes, our
children, our firesides are in danger! Keep in ambush. When you see
the whites of their eyes, if you are ready, Griggsby, you may fire!
Aim at the bloody red hearts of them! Fire to kill!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master darted behind a clump of Scotch broom, fitted
an arrow to the string of the bow, and selected the tomato heart of
the first Redskin for a personal target. Bill and the Nice Child
and Angel Face chose for themselves different bushes and trees of
the garden and at the Scout Master's shrill cry: "Fire!" with
various success in aiming, the arrows whanged against the
fence.</p>

<p>Jamie sat watching the proceedings. He was in doubt as to what
his position in the circumstances might be. The fence that had been
particularly and shiningly white was most objectionably decorated
in consideration of the beauty of the garden. Jamie wanted a
liberal supply of those red tomatoes himself and he had been
thinking when he gathered the ones he was preparing in the kitchen,
that instead of allowing quantities of them to waste, it might be
possible for him to carry them to the nearest corner vegetable
stand and secure for them at least enough to buy a box of
blackberries or red raspberries or some other necessary food that
he might want. There was a possibility that such fine fruit as
those tomatoes could be sold for enough money to replenish the cash
drawer from which he was supposed to buy the milk and ice and the
daily paper.</p>

<p>While he was meditating on these things, the air awoke to a
series of shrill cries. If Jamie had been blindfolded, he would
have sworn that there were twenty-five youngsters on the job
instead of four. It was no longer possible to tell Fat Ole Bill
from Angel Face. The Scout Master was lost in a series of wildly
revolving gyrations which included deftly leaping over flower beds,
dodging behind trees, circling bushes, crawling belly to earth. A
hail of arrows pinged against the fence, and presently, the wilder
the excitement grew, the straighter the arrows seemed to be aimed,
and tomatoes began flying far and wide. In the midst of the din a
particularly well-aimed arrow hit a particularly large tomato
rather from below and jarred it from the fence. Among the wild
cries Jamie could distinguish the voice of the Scout Master
shouting, "Ha! Another Redskin bit the dust!" And return shouts,
"Call the ambulance!" "Put him on ice!" Suddenly Jamie sat back and
began to laugh quietly, began to enjoy himself. The first thing he
knew he was down on his hands and knees. He had gathered a handful
of pebbles from the walk before him and then, screened by the
jacqueranda, he began shooting the pebbles with accuracy and
precision at the tomato hearts of the Redskins. Seeing this the
Scout Master went wild. "Soak 'em!" came the shout. "Pep up! This
is where the West begins!"</p>

<p>Angel Face sent an arrow over the fence.</p>

<p>"Foul Ball!" shouted the Scout Master. "Aim below the belt.
You'll scalp the early settlers."</p>

<p>Having exhausted his arrows Angel Face disappeared for an
instant and returned to the fray beating the bee drum and shouting,
"Atta boy! Keep your powder dry!"</p>

<p>Flying down the walk came the Nice Child with a fresh instalment
of tomatoes.</p>

<p>"First aid to the injured!" yelled the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"Ki-yi-ki, yi-ye, huh-huh!" Fat Ole Bill forgot which side he
was on and essayed a war-whoop.</p>

<p>"Listen to the rain crow warble," shouted the Scout Master, and
in an excess of frenzy, lacking arrows, joined Jamie in throwing
stones.</p>

<p>When the last tomato had disappeared from the girders, the
Scouts appeared breathless and panting before the Scout Master, who
stood with sword at attention while the Scouts fell in line for
orders. "Scouts, our thanks to the noble stranger who has so ably
assisted us in vanquishing our ancient enemies."</p>

<p>Three small boys, embarrassed at the unexpectedness of the
situation, faced Jamie. Fat Ole Bill hung his head and, with his
eyes rolled obliquely, muttered, "Thank you!" The Nice Child looked
at him straight and said, "Much oblige!" Angel Face brought his
heels together, saluted with dignity, and said, "Deeply obligated,
sir!" and the Scout Master swept the sword in a wide circle and
repeated the hand on the chest bow, and then straightening, faced
Jamie. "I thank you! My Scouts thank you! Your country thanks you!
Everybody in this darned neighbourhood thanks you! Scout One, get
the hose! Scout Two, bring the broom! Scout Three, turn on the
water!"</p>

<p>When the line was laid, the Scout Master took charge. The water
spanged against the white fence. Fat Ole Bill wielded the broom.
The Nice Child and Angel Face gathered up the scraps of tomato and
carried them back to the garbage can. When they had finished and
everything was neat again and the late afternoon sun began with a
few last rays to dry and whiten the fence, Jamie noticed in passing
close to it that there were dozens of almost invisible red lines
all through the white, and he realized that the sham battle was
probably a weekly affair in the garden of the Bee Master. So he
went back to the bench under the jacqueranda with the feeling that
in permitting the encounter he had not exceeded the limit of his
privileges. While his back was turned, exactly what happened he was
not able to decide. When he turned to take his seat, his gaze
encountered a heap of flying legs and arms. Arms and legs
everywhere. A big ball of humanity was rolling over the gravel
walk, and in it the fat, bare legs of Bill, and the olive-brown
legs of the Nice Child, and the silk-stockinged, kid-shod feet of
Angel Face were intermixed. Presently, the Dutch bob of the Scout
Master appeared on top and the leader, with deft hands, began
separating the mass, disintegrating it, expertly flinging it in
different directions.</p>

<p>"Get a pacifier for the babies!" shouted the Scout Master.
"Grabbing and fighting over a hose like that! I said, 'Scout One,
put the hose away!'"</p>

<p>Angel Face was sputtering.</p>

<p>"You didn't said no such thing! You said, 'Scout Three,' and I'm
Scout Three, myself! You wouldn't a-told One to put it away when
you'd told One to bring it!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master fell into deep meditation. The sword handle was
used to scratch the tumbled head.</p>

<p>"Fellows," said the Scout Master, dropping into a confidential
tone, "I guess Angel Face is right. I guess, by Gum and by Golly! I
<i>did</i> tell him to put away the hose, and I guess I told Two to
put away the broom, and I guess I didn't tell One to do anything,
which is for the reason Ole Bill's so fat it's cruelty to animals
to make him move anyway!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master sheathed the sword, combed the Dutch hair with
soiled fingers, wiped the face on a particularly dirty sleeve, and
stuffed in the tail of a shirt very much in evidence.</p>

<p>"Scouts, use your lipsticks and disband for the day!" came the
order.</p>

<p>Then the Scout Master walked up in front of Jamie, took a
decided stand and looked at him inquiringly, while Bill and the
Nice Child and Angel Face ranged themselves near, their eyes highly
expectant.</p>

<p>Jamie, sick though he might have been, Scot though he surely
was, remembered back dimly to the time when he was a boy and fought
imaginary Indians and hunted with wooden guns and flourished wooden
swords and made wagons with rocking wheels and carried in his
anatomy a stomach that was for ever empty. The stomach that was for
ever empty was the keynote of the present situation he felt sure.
Jamie rose up and extended one hand to the Scout Master and the
other to Angel Face, who happened to be such a particularly
attractive young gentleman that Jamie succumbed to the light of his
eyes and the charm of his smile the first instant he had a square
look at him.</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows," he said, casually. "Let's go down to the
corner stand and clean out the hot dogs and strawberry pop!"</p>

<p>The shrill cheering that greeted Jamie's ears was perfect
compensation for the amount of the hole that the treat would make
in the very meagre bunch of loose change that he carried in his
breeches pocket.</p>

<p>Lined before the stand, while their diverse orders were being
attended to, the visiting Scouts looked Jamie over critically. They
liked the twinkle in his eyes. They liked the lean smile that crept
over his white face. They liked the accuracy with which he had
whizzed the pebbles and the dexterity with which he had gathered
more when his supply ran short. Above everything else, they liked
the fact that he had worked from behind a tree. If he had stood in
the open and picked up stones and thrown them, it would not have
meant much to the Scout Master and that particular band of Scouts;
but the fellow that played the game hard, that played it according
to the rules, that made it not a game but a reality by playing it
as they played it, was nothing short of a real fellow and the
youngsters crowded close and began to ask questions.</p>

<p>Jamie sat down in the shade of a live oak and put one arm around
the Scout Master and the other around Angel Face, and saw to it
that there was room for Ole Bill and the Nice Child; and while the
buns were being toasted and the onions fried, and the wienies split
and browned and the mustard beaten smooth and the dill pickles
sliced, and the pop brought from the ice, he told the boys some
thing about what scouting meant when a man started on a night as
black as a hat, on his stomach, crawling over shell holes big as a
house, through broken rock and the debris of a sodden battlefield
with a rain of shells and shrapnel bursting over him, trying to get
close enough to steal a secret from the enemy, searching for the
odour that attached to a beloved Buddy, hunting for the body of an
officer.</p>

<p>The Nice Child and Ole Bill came and pressed close to Jamie's
knees. The Scout Master leaned the Dutch head against the wound on
his breast and trained unblinking eyes on him and Angel Face laid
violent hands on his arm and paid not the slightest attention when
the stand man said: "Your hot dogs are ready!" and the popping of
corks began.</p>

<p>"Tell us some more!" they shouted in unison. "Tell us some
more!" And Fat Ole Bill kicked the olive shin of the Nice Child and
said: "Gee! we never got a chance like this before, did we? He's
been where the ground's all soggy with real blood and swords and
things cuttin' into him, and shootin' goin' on above him! Gee!
ain't he wonnerful?"</p>

<p>It was Jamie himself who wrecked the party with his sensitive
nostrils. He had talked about vitamines and calories. He had agreed
with Margaret Cameron that they would start a rgime that he would
follow religiously, but since the rgime had not started as yet,
and since it seemed to him that he never in all his life had
smelled anything quite so alluring as the odour of the hot dogs, he
reached a long arm over the heads of the youngsters and with one
hand gathered up the plumpest hot dog he could see and with the
other a particularly pink bottle of pop. What he said was: "Fall to
chow! Help your selves, Buddies!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later he came up the grassy sidewalk past Margaret
Cameron's door and grinned at her. His white face was flushed
peculiarly and Margaret Cameron peered at him over the load of
clippings she was carrying and then stared reprovingly. "I'll wager
two bits you went down to the corner stand and ate hot dogs with
those youngsters," she accused.</p>

<p>Jamie smiled at her joyously.</p>

<p>"You win!" he said, enthusiastically. "Holy smoke! but they were
jewlicious!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. Because of God</h2>

<p>The next time Jamie answered the telephone he got his call to
the hospital. At two o'clock the following day he again boarded the
trolley for the city and with no difficulty whatever made his way
to one of its largest hospitals. Almost immediately he was shown to
the room of the Bee Master, a big room where the sun shone in and
the wind played through and the air was tinged with the perfume
from a bowl of yellow roses. The instant Jamie saw those roses he
realized that if they were not from the bush that grew beside.
Margaret Cameron's door, they were from some other bush that
belonged to the identical family and species. The yellow of the
roses, the faint sweetness of their perfume, was in his nostrils as
he rounded the screen by the bedside and stood facing the Bee
Master.</p>

<p>Exactly what he had expected to see, he did not know. What he
did see almost broke his heart. The man whom he had supported to
the davenport, whom he had helped to the ambulance, had been ill;
he had been in a sweat of agony; but he had been a man alive, with
a chance for life manifest by the strength of his frame, the
firmness of his muscles, the light in his eyes. It seemed to Jamie
that the frame stretched on the bed before him was not tenanted by
life, but by a spirit, a spirit that might flicker out and make its
passing at any minute. There was not much strength left in the
white hand that reached out to him. The voice that greeted him was
scarcely above a whisper. The eyes that searched his face and
rested on him were tired almost beyond endurance.</p>

<p>To cover his shock, his sense of pity, Jamie drew up a chair and
began to talk about the thing he knew would be of most concern to
the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"First of all," he said, "I must tell you that I believe I'm bee
immune. I've worn your coat and used the mint and the cinnamon
pinks and the Madonna lilies prescribed by your partner, and they
have been effective even above the dressings I'm carrying on my
side. I can fill the water pans and gauge the right amount of salt
and go past any of the hives with safety. I haven't had much length
of time to study, but in so far as I know, your bees are
flourishing. Your partner sends you word that they are all right,
and the youngster really seems to know."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Bee Master, "my partner does know. My
partner knows bees rarely and finely well, even to performing the
delicate operation of clipping the wings of a Queen."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Jamie, "you can take it that the bees
are fine. Margaret Cameron sends her love and her assurance that
your flowers are flourishing, and I can tell you that your house is
being cared for lovingly. I lock it carefully if I leave it, and I
live in it sympathetically as behoves a man when he treads on
antique rugs and touches antique furniture. You will find
everything exactly as you left it when you come home again."</p>

<p>The Bee Master smiled. "I divined that would be the case when I
hailed you from the road," he said. "You appealed to me, even in
that hour of agony, as a man of fine perceptions and right
instincts. I knew that I would be safe in leaving even my most
cherished possessions with you. I had not any sense that you were a
stranger. You seemed to me rather an instrument that had been sent
to serve my dire necessity. And the little Scout? My little
partner?"</p>

<p>"Your little partner comes to the garden, but I doubt if the
garden is much of a garden without you. There are two things that I
have to tell you."</p>

<p>Jamie dipped in his pocket and produced the price of the hot dog
and the strawberry pop and laid the coins in the outstretched hands
of the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"My instructions," he said, "were to have the bun fried, the hot
dogs split and cooked crisp. The onions were to be browned. The
exact amount of mustard was specified. I was to superintend the
construction of that hot dog personally and with care. I'll go now
and see that it is made according to specifications, if you think
Doctor Grayson would not cane me."</p>

<p>The Bee Master smiled. He closed his fingers over the money, the
identical pieces that his little partner had counted out for
him.</p>

<p>"That money was carefully selected," said Jamie, "from a
collection of buttons and buckles and dice and moon stones, and it
happened to just about clean out the treasury. There wasn't much
left. But your partner won a bet that was going to bring in two
bits, so bankruptcy is not looming. I happened to be a witness to
the winning of the bet. An accurately directed stream of saliva hit
a bumblebee at about ten paces and knocked it off a red
creeper."</p>

<p>A dry chuckle shook the frame of the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"Good work!" he said, heartily. "My partner can be depended upon
to hit 'most anything that happens to be the mark that's aimed
at."</p>

<p>"And your partner," said Jamie, "has got a heart that's filled
with love for you, love so deep and of such a nature that I truly
believe that the offer to give a right hand that would be needed in
riding a horse, in paddling a boat, in managing the Scouts,
nevertheless, the offer freely and honestly made, of that same
right hand in your behalf if it would ease the pain and bring you
home safe and well."</p>

<p>The Bee Master shut his eyes tight and lay there fingering the
dime and the two nickels. By and by he smiled stiffly at Jamie.</p>

<p>"You need not doubt the loyalty or the sincerity of that offer,"
he said. "And you need not doubt that it would have been heroically
fulfilled had necessity arisen. And you need not doubt, on my part,
that in all the world there is no one left half so dear to me as
the little fellow. One of the reasons I'd like to live is that I
might go on further in what I am trying to teach that particular
youngster about the keeping of bees and, incidentally, about the
keeping of a soul that I happen to believe is immortal. Anything my
partner has gotten from me will do no dam age. In fact, I have a
feeling that the damaging things of this world are going to go past
a mind that is fully occupied with something legitimate and
constructive. Don't tell my partner that I dare not have the hot
dog or the strawberry pop. Say that I am mighty thankful to be
remembered. Give my love, and if you feel that I would not be too
much of a shock, next time bring the little fellow along."</p>

<p>"I'd be only too glad," said Jamie. "And now, can you give me
any instructions before I go? Doctor Gray son specified that I must
stay only a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I think there is nothing but to go on as you are. I'd be glad
if you would put in your spare time among the bee books. It would
help you with your job. It might interest you to an extent that
would carry you on during the time of my weakness, provided your
own strength is sufficient. Grayson wants to see you in his office
here in the hospital before you go, and if you will pull out that
drawer there on the left and put the envelope in it in your pocket,
that will afford you at least some compensation for what you have
done for me in easing my mind about my home and my belongings and
my business. Tell Margaret that they will not allow me to write,
but that I love the roses she sends and her notes are much company
to me. Tell her I hope she will continue to indulge an old man
until, let's say until I reach home again, since I possibly have
some chance. I will say good-bye now. I want you to know that I am
thinking about you almost constantly in my waking hours. Be sure to
see Grayson. He is mighty fine. He might be able to suggest
something that would make you less white and help you to gather
strength. Now it's good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Jamie, "and rest easy. Among us, Margaret
Cameron, the little Scout, and myself, we can manage the bees.
There is no difficulty whatever about the flowers and the trees.
I've already got that routine."</p>

<p>Then Jamie went down and found the office of Doctor Grayson, and
half an hour later he went home with a big bundle of antiseptic
dressings and without a drop of medicine. He had been advised to
follow his impulses. If his body cried out for cold salt water, to
indulge it. If the demand was to lie in the sand in the sun, to go
ahead.</p>

<p>"Since a year of the best care they could give you at one of our
finest government hospitals didn't budge your trouble, try doing
exactly what Nature tells you she wants you to do," said the
doctor, "and see what result you get from that. I am not sure but
salt water and sunshine and clean air are not the best doctors in
all the world, anyway."</p>

<p>In the office Jamie sat on a bench to rest a few minutes and
decide what he would do next. He was thankful for the dressings
because he had not known exactly what would be the best thing to
use. The doctors and nurses had done what they pleased to him, but
he had not known very much about what they were doing. Now he would
have the assurance that what he was using could at least do no
damage.</p>

<p>He thought about some necessaries he wanted and he wondered if
the envelope contained enough to replace the sum he had borrowed
for a ring and the marriage license, and so he opened it. Then he
sat in dumbfounded amazement. It would not be a wise thing to go
back and enter protest in the room of the sick man. He counted up
the days that he had been on the job in the garden. He figured that
he had had his room and his board and the use of the clothing he
required, but it was not right and it was not reasonable that he
should be paid any such sum as that envelope contained for what he
had done. He sat there wondering if men all over the country for
common day labour were being paid any such sum as that. He felt the
money between his fingers. He spread it out before his eyes. He
studied it searchingly. He could replace what he had borrowed and
he could spend the same sum two or three times over, for only a few
days of the protection of his presence about the bee garden.</p>

<p>That was practically what his services had amounted to. He had
kept the house open. He had given it the effect of someone on the
job. He put the money in his pocket&mdash;in a pocket where he
could slip his hand to it and feel it. He left the hospital and
went on the street, and still he kept fingering that money. If a
sick man could earn that much merely by "sticking around," as the
little Scout had expressed it, what could he not do if he were
well? Doctor Grayson had said that salt water and sunshine and
clean air might possibly be the best doctors. Very well, then, he
had the Pacific Ocean full of salt water. He had the whole sky full
of sunshine. He had air absolutely dustless and clean wafting
softly from the ocean every hour of every day, coming all the way
from China. If there were dust in the air he breathed, Jamie
reflected that it would have to be star dust.</p>

<p>So he squared his shoulders and with one hand he felt the money,
with the other he felt his breast. He touched it deliberately, as
probingly as he could through his clothing, and he discovered that
since he had recovered from the strain of his tramp, it was not
quite so tender as it had been. If he could earn money like that,
if he had a garden of wonder to work in, if he could earn the Bee
Master's confidence, if he could daily make worth-while friends, if
he had a wife, if there were going to be a child to bear his name,
what was the use in dying? There might be something very well worth
while that he could do in the world. At any rate, he could get an
unlimited supply of interesting work and interesting amusement out
of the bee garden and the little Scout.</p>

<p>So Jamie went to several stores and bought some things he needed
with the assurance of a man who has the price in his pocket. Then
he went home and for the first time in two years he changed his
occupation; he was thinking about life instead of death.</p>

<p>He put away the things that he had bought and then headed
straight toward the bench under the jacqueranda at the top of the
blue garden. He found on the bench, curled up like a kitten, the
little Scout sound asleep. In an effort to step lightly that he
might not disturb the child, his foot turned on a stone of the
border that had rolled from place and the slight grinding awakened
the little Scout. Instantly the youngster was up, smiling
ingratiatingly, and stretching two sleep-misted eyes to the widest
extent in an effort to prove that sleep had not touched them since
the previous night, at any rate.</p>

<p>In further effort to prove that a Scout Master was always awake
and fit, the youngster stepped forward and inquired brusquely: "Now
what shall we <i>do?</i>"</p>

<p>Jamie sat down on the bench and drew the little Scout down
beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm tired," he said. "I've been in to visit the Bee Master and
he is feeling fine. He sent you his love and he was very much
pleased with your gift, and some day soon he wants you to come to
see him."</p>

<p>The little Scout nodded in acquiescence. "But if you're tired,
what can we <i>do?</i>"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled.</p>

<p>"Must you have something active and vigorous to do every waking
minute of your life?" he inquired. "Can't you occasionally sit down
and rest and commune with your soul? If you are so very anxious to
do something, let me make a suggestion. I have everything to learn
about bees that you already know. How would it work, if you have an
hour to spare, to spend it on my education?"</p>

<p>The little Scout studied Jamie intently.</p>

<p>"You mean that you want me to wise you up on all I know about
bees, when there's all the Bee Master's books in there on the shelf
to learn from?"</p>

<p>"But didn't the Bee Master study out a world of things for
himself? Didn't he know enough to fill a book of things that he had
figured out in a lifetime of experience with the bees? Maybe some
of it was original with him. Maybe you know things that are not in
the books."</p>

<p>The little Scout chuckled.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a good many things that are not in the books that
we would <i>like</i> to know. Somebody's got to do a lot more
studying about bees before everybody knows everything there is to
know."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "suppose you begin wherever your fancy
strikes you and tell me what you think I should know about
bees."</p>

<p>The little Scout leaned forward, laid a pair of hands, not so
clean as usual, palm to palm and dropped them be tween a pair of
knees that gave evidence of active service in recent contact with
the earth. Then suddenly an intent little face with eyes of deep
introspection was turned to Jamie.</p>

<p>"Guess," said the little Scout, "guess the first question I ever
asked the Bee Master about bees?"</p>

<p>"'Why do you keep bees?'" suggested Jamie.</p>

<p>Slowly the little tan and brown head moved in negation.</p>

<p>"Nope! You're all wet!" said the little Scout. "You're not even
warm! First question I ever asked was, 'Why is the bee garden
blue?' And I'll have to tell you the answer because you would never
guess it in a thousand years. The answer is, 'Because of God.'"</p>

<p>Jamie's face betrayed the astonishment he felt. His brow
wrinkled in thought; his eyes narrowed. He stared at the little
Scout and repeated softly: "'Because of <i>God</i>'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the little Scout. "That's what makes bees so
interesting. About half the things you'll have to learn are because
of God, and why the bee garden is blue is the very first thing.
Now, you listen and I'll tell you the reason."</p>

<p>With uplifted hand to caution silence, slowly and deliberately,
the little Scout repeated the explanation that had been given to
the first question concerning bees.</p>

<p>"The bee garden is blue because blue is the 'perfect colour' and
bees are the most perfect of any insect in the way they live, and
the most valuable on account of the work they do, and so blue would
be the colour they love best, and it <i>is!</i> If you don't
believe it, <i>watch</i> them. And because why&mdash;the nearest we
come to a perfect insect loves a perfect colour <i>best</i>, why,
that's because God made them as they are!"</p>

<p>The little Scout looked hard at Jamie and Jamie's face was
noncommittal.</p>

<p>"I guess you don't get it," ventured the youngster. "Well, wait
a minute and you <i>will</i>. The first thing you've got to learn
is some figures. Because you are big and maybe been to college, you
ought to learn 'em if I can. For one thing, there's four thousand
five hundred different kinds of wild bees. That's one thing for you
to remember. Another thing is that one hundred thousand kinds of
plants would not live any more if all these bees were blown away or
burned up or something, because, you see, a plant has to grow where
the wind carries its seed or a bird or a squirrel sows it, and if
one plant happens to be a male and an other happens to be a female,
they can't get up and walk to each other and do their courting and
make their seeds come good, now <i>can</i> they? So they have to
have some thing to carry the pollen back and forth to make the good
seed.</p>

<p>"Now, <i>here's</i> something to remember about a bee
itself&mdash;say a worker bee, because it would be the one that
would carry the pollen. First you can remember that in every one of
the little tubes on its nose a worker has got five thousand smell
hollows, so it is no wonder it can pick you out if you got a scent
about you that isn't <i>right</i>. Then, a worker bee has got six
thousand eyes on each side of its head so it can see the flowers
that it wants to get the pollen and the nectar from. And a worker
bee has got two stomachs, a little one more inside for itself, and
a way bigger one more on the outside for the hive. Back on its
abdomen every worker bee has got four pockets to secrete wax, and
every worker has got baskets on its legs to gather pollen in,
besides the nectar that they carry in their stomach for the hive.
Every one of them has got a good sharp sting that it can use if it
doesn't like your scent or if it thinks you are going to hurt it or
do something you shouldn't around the hive. Every one of them is
covered with hair that is long for a bee and it is soft and fine
and when the workers go down into Mr. Male Iris to get nectar for
their two stomachs and to fill their pollen baskets, the hair all
over them fills with the pollen, too, and it is the law, because of
God, that when any bee starts out to gather nectar and pollen <i>it
never mixes one flower with another</i>. If it <i>starts</i> on
iris, it keeps right on going to <i>iris</i>. You can see it now,
can't you? When the worker bee gets the pollen from Mr. Iris all
over his hair and then goes on to get pollen from Miss Iris, the
hair is going to scatter the pollen for her, that's going to make
the good seed come, 'cause the bees do the flowers' courting for
them. That's a reason besides honey as to why bees are so
useful.</p>

<p>"One time I asked the Bee Master if I couldn't <i>see</i> God
and if I couldn't <i>touch</i> Him, how I was going to know that He
was <i>here</i>. And he said, 'Because of the hair on a bee.' So
that's <i>one</i> of the ways <i>you</i> can know.</p>

<p>"Then there are a lot of ways you find out about God on account
of how He made Queen bees. A beehive is just full of miracles and
signs and symbols and wonders. The Bee Master <i>said</i> so. But
perhaps the biggest wonder in the whole hive is just about the
Queen. There is a lot about God mixed up with a Queen bee. Workers
may only live five or six weeks, but a Queen may live five or six
years. She is away bigger than a worker and she looks different.
She is long and slender and has bigger wings, and she has a big
abdomen 'cause she may lay a million or two eggs. She has only
about half as many eyes as a worker, 'cause she only needs them
when she goes out to find her lover, or maybe a few times more when
she has a great hive full of one hundred and twenty pounds of honey
and so many bees they are in each other's way. So, when she gets
everything ready, she tells part of them to come with her to found
a new hive, and leaves the others to refill the old hive after the
Bee Master takes his share of the honey.</p>

<p>"The way a Queen comes to be a Queen, is this way: In a little
cell all fixed up for it, the Queen bee of a hive puts an egg and
she tells the workers 'I want this egg to be a Queen.' Then the
workers get busy and make the royal jelly. That's another thing the
people who write the bee books haven't found out. They don't know
just what royal jelly is or how it is made. But the <i>workers</i>
know. God showed 'em how when He made 'em. So they make the royal
jelly and they feed it to what comes from the egg that the Queen
said should be another Queen. It grows to be a white nymph, and
when a white nymph is ready to fly, it is a young Queen. With
different food they feed what comes from each egg in each different
cell and out of each cell there comes the thing that the Queen says
she wants to come. For fear something might hap pen to a Queen,
'cause there can't any hive get along with out a Queen, she lays a
whole lot of eggs that she says she wants made into Queens and then
she lays quite a number for males and some for nurses and thousands
and thousands for workers. Remember this: Bees make four different
kinds of cells.</p>

<p>"Now, when the Queen has her hive full of honey and enough white
nymphs to be sure that the hive will always have a Queen, and lots
of bee bread to feed the nymphs and all the other bees that are
shut up in the cradles, and when everything in the hive is just
right, a thing happens that nobody understands about. Right here is
where the Queen takes her Ladies of Honour and her architects and
her masons who make the combs, and her workers who bring in the
pollen and the nectar, and she takes some males and she takes some
nurses, and she goes right away and leaves all the work that all of
them have done so carefully. The thing that nobody knows is who
decides, or how it is decided, who shall stay in the hive and who
shall go. But it looks like two thirds of them go with the old
Queen.</p>

<p>"Before the old Queen starts to leave the hive with the swarm
that goes with her, all of them except the Queen go to the honey
vats and take honey to last them five or six days so they will not
starve while they're finding a new home, and so the wax that they
can distil from the honey will be right along with them to lay the
foundations for the cells to begin work in their new home.</p>

<p>"Then the Queen walks out of the hive, and the ones that are to
go with her all come, too. She flies a little way and settles on an
orange branch, or maybe on a fig, or a jacqueranda, and close
around her come her Ladies of Honour and all her swarm that are
taking care of her. They hide her away down among themselves so no
bird can get her or hawk moth, or anything, and the scouts go out
to hunt a new home. When the scouts go to hunt a home, they hunt a
place in the rocks up in the canyon, or a big dead limb in a live
oak, or a sycamore. But if the bee master is truly a bee master, he
has known for several days, by how busy the hive is and by the
things he hears the bees say to each other, that they are going to
leave their home and find a new one. So, if he wants to keep his
bees and make his garden get bigger and bigger, he has some hives
standing back, all ready, and he watches, and when the Queen comes
out of her door and starts to fly, he takes his bee drum and slow
and easy and deep, drum, drum, drum, he beats it. The bees wonder
what that strange sound is. They forget just what they were going
to do and settle on the nearest limb and hide the Queen like I told
you, and quick the bee master goes and: gets his smoker and smokes
them just a little bit to keep' them quiet and easy. If he loves
his bees, he doesn't smoke them very much, because a bee hates
smoke the worst of anything in the whole world.</p>

<p>"Then right quick he cuts off the branch or he sets the hive
under it and with his hand strips off the bees and tumbles them in.
He always has to be sure that he has the Queen and that she is all
right. Then he takes the hive and sets it on a new stand and puts
it in his bee garden. If he wants to he can put it right beside the
hive the bees came from and they will not ever again go back in the
hive that they lived in before. They will always stay with the
Queen and live and work in the new hive. The Queen never in all her
life goes out again unless she wants to found another new hive.
Then she goes just the same as she did this time. So that is the
way the bee master gets new hives of bees.</p>

<p>"Back in the old hive that's left they are feeling pretty blue,
because along comes the bee master and takes his share of the
honey, and their beautiful Queen is gone, and the lovely golden
boxes of comb that fill the hive almost full are empty except for
what the bee master leaves, and everybody stands around and feels
blue and waits. The workers don't go out after nectar like I get
from the Madonna lilies, nor for pollen. They won't hardly even
clean up after the lazy old drones. It is the bluest time the hive
'most ever knows. So they all go and they gather around the cells
that the old Queen laid the eggs in to make more Queens. The old
Queen knows when she leaves that out of one of these cells pretty
quick there is going to come a new Queen. So just when everybody in
the hive is getting pretty well discouraged, one of the white
nymphs sticks up her head and eats open the lid of her cell and
comes walking out. The nurses go rushing to her and help her clean
up and comb her hair and polish her wings. They kiss her 'cause
they are so glad to see her.</p>

<p>"Another thing that God has done in a beehive is not to let one
young Queen come out alone, because when she gets all ready and
fixed she is going to go out into the great big world to find her
King, and if a bee bird or a kingbird eats her up, why then the
hive is in worse trouble than it was before. So maybe the same day,
or a day or two later, another white nymph sticks up her head and
eats her way out of her cell and comes walking out. But nobody goes
to her or helps her very much, 'cause all of 'em are betting their
money on the first one out.</p>

<p>"When the Queen that came out first sees another Queen has left
her cell, it makes her awful mad. Right there the fight begins.
They just go at it like I go at the Nice Child and Angel Face when
I can see back in their eyes that they think maybe they're going to
mutiny on me. Only I stop when I got 'em licked. The young Queen
doesn't stop until she's got the other Queen killed deader than
anything and the workers carry her out to the bee cemetery.</p>

<p>"Then the young Queen wants to go on and kill every white nymph
that's sleeping in the rest of the cradles. Right then and there
she wants to do it. But the workers and the scouts and the guards
step up and they say, 'No, you can't do that. You have to go and
find your King and come back ready to be the mother of the hive
before you can do that.'</p>

<p>"So the young Queen rests up a few days and gets all ready, and
one day when the weather is all bright and sunny, in the morning
when the dew is on the flowers and the lark is on the wing and
everything, like that morning Browning wrote about&mdash;the Bee
Master made me learn it: that one about 'God's in His Heaven and
all's right in the world'; I expect your mother made you learn it,
too&mdash;why, the new Queen goes to the door and she walks out of
it backward. She goes away a little piece and she comes back to it
three or four times. God told her to do that so she would be mighty
sure when she came home from the first long flight she has ever
made she would know her own door. When she is sure she knows where
she belongs, why then she starts this flight, and God's in the way
she can fly, too, because she hasn't had a chance to use her wings
ever before. But when she does use them, she goes up and up, away
up into the sky. She goes up higher than the trees. She goes up
higher than the birds. She goes up so high that the men who write
the books can't ever see how high she does go.</p>

<p>"When she starts out, all through the line of the hives the
something that the bee books call 'the Spirit of the Hive,' or
Instink, or Nature, but that the Bee Master says is just another
name for God, tells all the male bees that a young Queen has gone
out to search for a King. They can't ride a milk-white charger to
find her; they have got to use their wings. But they are some
punkins on looks. They are big swaggery fellows. On their heads
they wear helmets trimmed in black pearls, and tall plumes. They
have yellow velvet belts and long mantles, and they walk over
everybody in the hive. They don't even pay much attention to the
Queen&mdash;till they start out to court her. They have been a big
nuisance all their lives. They won't work a lick. They don't go out
and hunt any honey. They just walk up to the cells that the workers
are filling and eat all they please. They go out and curl up in the
tulips and in the lilies and wherever they can find a beautiful
flower cradle and lie there and sleep in the sun for hours. Then
they come back and eat some more, and they are too lazy to live
like the other bees do, but the worker bees know the hive can't go
on without them, so they clean up after them. Nobody likes them
very well, but nobody says a word <i>because they are part of God's
plan</i>. It's all right for 'em to have a good time while they've
got the chance; they don't know a little bit about what's coming to
them.</p>

<p>"So when the young Queen goes out, all the males think they
would like to court her, and from all the different hives they go
swarming up after her. They spread their wings so wide and they fly
so hard and fast that they get all swelled up and get more air
inside them than they ever had before, and they get different from
the way they were before they started. It takes a good, fine strong
one to go as high as the Queen goes. Finally, when some of them get
'way up mighty close to Heaven, all alone up there, where the sky
is blue and the day is sweet and every thing is so nice and fine,
the Queen says which one may be her King. Then they get married.
They don't have but a little bit of a honeymoon, for the Queen says
she must go straight home and go to work. So she doesn't even wait
to say good-bye to the King; she just gives him a big push, so big
and hard it kills him and he falls down to the ground, deader than
anything. And she goes home and goes into the door, and she's lucky
if she gets home and gets in the door 'cause on account of birds
and things. That's why there are more white nymphs waiting, so that
if the young Queen doesn't come back, another one can be got ready
and sent out. You see how it's all fixed up from the beginning to
keep things going? That's why <i>God's</i> in it, because it is
such a wonderful plan, and it is things that <i>men</i> couldn't do
in any way at all. It takes just God to plan life for the bees.</p>

<p>"If the Queen gets home everybody is so tickled when she comes
through the door that they kiss her and they comb her hair and they
polish her wings and they fix her all up fine. You wouldn't think
there was a thing but love and goodness in their hearts.</p>

<p>"Then what do you think the workers do? You couldn't ever guess,
not in days and days, so I'll have to tell you. All the white
nymphs that they have been feeding royal jelly and that the nurses
have been taking care of so fine, get <i>stung</i>. Can you beat
it? You know how when any man cheats in business and loves another
man up and makes him think he is his friend, and then turns, around
and takes all his money and maybe kills him, why people say the
good man 'got stung.' Well, right there in the beehive what happens
is 'cause the reason why they say that. All the white nymphs that
have been loved up so good and fed the royal jelly, the minute the
young Queen gets home all safe and sound, why the white nymphs that
would be Queens if they got a chance, they all get stung to death,
and maybe there's forty or fifty thousand of them&mdash;that's how
sure the bees want to feel about having a Queen. They are so dead
that the workers carry them out and put them all together with the
dead ones.</p>

<p>"The next thing they do is for all the workers to get together
and every big, bluffy drone that has been lazing round the hive and
getting waited on by five or six worker bees and everybody has
stood everything from him, why, every one of them gets stung, too.
When it happens in the observation hive, you can sit with the
glasses on 'em and see their faces, and they look so surprised and
scared you can't help feeling sorry for them. They don't know what
they've done, and they don't know why what's happening to them
happens, and they can't understand why workers that waited on them,
just a whole army of workers, mad as Alice's March Hare and the
Hatter out of Wonderland, come roaring at 'em singing a war song
and whooping battle cries. The old Mr. Drones get their wings
pulled off and they get their eyes stung out and they get
punkshered everywhere, and every last one of them gets killed good
and dead, and pushed out of the hive.</p>

<p>"There's not anybody left but the young Queen and the Maids of
Honour and the workers and the nurses that are going to stay with
her. If there's any danger, all of them make a shield and cover up
the young Queen. If it is a hard winter, they get close around her
to keep her warm; and if there isn't enough food, they all go
hungry and feed her. No matter what happens to them, every one of
them, as long as they are alive, takes care of the Queen, because
it is the eggs she lays that make the new brood and keep the bees
alive in the world. So something tells every bee, 'No matter if you
die yourself, take care of your Queen so that bees will not vanish
off the face of the world like everything did that time of the
flood.' The thing that tells them, that's God <i>again</i>."</p>

<p>The little Scout looked Jamie straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"You begin to see now, don't you, why the Bee Master said the
hair on a bee was God?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "I begin to see. It is the most wonderful
thing I've ever heard about in all the world! Go on and tell me
more. Tell me every least little thing you know."</p>

<p>"There isn't much more to tell," said the little Scout. "There's
more figures I could tell about&mdash;how the old drone males have
got just oodles more eyes and more smell hollows than the workers.
The old drone males have got thirty-seven thousand eight hundred
smell hollows and that is so they will be dead sure to find the
Queen, and <i>that's</i> God again. And the old drone males have
got thirteen thousand eyes on each side of their heads. That's so
they can see better than anybody else and be certain to find the
Queen, 'cause they've <i>got</i> to find the Queen, and they've
<i>got</i> to get married, and the Queen has to lay her eggs to
keep the world having bees, and to make the nice, sweet honey for
everybody, and to keep the hundred thousand flowers alive.</p>

<p>"When the Bee Master gets the old Queen and her family in a new
hive, he sets it up in a nice place. The scouts come back to where
they left the Queen and they hunt until they find the new hive.
They know their family and they go in, and then everybody goes to
work. The workers build the cells, and the old Queen lays all the
eggs and tells the workers what she wants to come out of each egg.
They go straight ahead just like they did in the hive they came
from. The workers clean up everything and the old Queen fills the
cells again with eggs that she wants to be Queens and drones and
workers and nurses, and maybe scouts, and they go on making more
honey and hatching out more bees, until the hive gets so full that
the old Queen says they will have to bring out a young Queen and
turn the hive over to her, while they go out and start another
family.</p>

<p>"The Queen keeps giving orders all the time about what she wants
done. She may rule for five or six years. She lays eggs all the
time. You couldn't believe how many eggs&mdash;maybe as many as two
million. She has only got seven or eight thousand eyes, 'cause
she's a stay-at-home-lady. Right-on-the Job is her first and last
name, both all two of them. But she hasn't any wax pockets, and no
brushes, and no pollen baskets. She doesn't like light, and she
doesn't know how Madonna lily nectar tastes, 'cause all her food is
digested for her before she eats it.&mdash;If I could work that
scheme on hot dogs, you wouldn't think they were so bad, would
you?"</p>

<p>Jamie laughed.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, the Queen just keeps right on laying eggs all day, maybe
all night, for all I know. Anyway, she <i>lays</i> 'em. I tell you,
boy, she lays 'em! And every time she lays an egg she says what she
wants it to be, and her nurses go right to work to feed the royal
jelly to the white nymphs, and bee bread to make more drones, and
to make the workers and the nurses, and the scouts, maybe, like I
said before. And some of the workers are builders and some are
masons and some are dancers. It's the dancers' job, when the hive
gets very hot inside, to dance and wave their wings until they
start a breeze to cool the cells. And sometimes they dance the
queerest dance for the white nymphs.</p>

<p>"That's <i>part</i> of what I know about bees. I couldn't tell
all I know about them 'cause I can't think of it all at once.
There's too much of it to tell right hot off the bat. But you can
watch 'em in the observation hive and pretty quick you can see
which cells have got the big, soft, white nymphs in them, and which
ones have got the big fat drones, and which ones have the little
workers, and the nurses, and the scouts, maybe. After what I've
told you, you can see the old drones crawling around over the cells
eating honey where they please, and being as dirty and mussy as
ever they want to. Then you can see the workers go and clean up
after them. You can see the cells where the eggs are being taken
care of. You can see the cells that are being filled with honey.
You can see the cells that have gold and red and purple pollen in
for wax. Next time I come, I'm going to ask you about the figures
that I told you, like the Bee Master asked me. You have to be ready
and not make any mistakes, because if <i>I</i> can remember, a big
man like you ought to remember!"</p>

<p>The little Scout stood up, pushed down the tail of the green
shirt that seemed habitually to work up, tightened the belt buckle
at the waist, and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I've told you so very well. In there in the
library you can find the books like I showed you that tell what
people <i>used</i> to think. The books that are the bunk. Then
you'll find the books like Lubbock and Swammerdam, which have the
wonderful pictures, that will tell you what really happens. Then
there are the books like Fabre and Maeterlinck that the Bee Master,
says are three things at one time. First they are the truth, and
next they are poetry, and third they are the evidence of a Master
Mind that plans every least little tiny thing. He says the only
name for that Master Mind is God. He doesn't see any use in trying
to dodge God and side-step Him and call Him 'the Spirit of the
Hive' and Instink and Nature and things like that. He says a great
scientist, one of the best, almost went crazy trying to do that
very thing. His name was Charles Darwin, and the Bee Master says C.
D. would have been a heap bigger Injun if he'd been willing to put
God in where He belongs. He says when God does anything 'with such
care, and puts so much thought in it, and deals out such splendid
justice' as there is in a beehive, that a <i>wise</i> man will just
take off his hat and lift his eyes to the sky and very politely he
will say, 'Just God.'"</p>

<p>Then in a lightning-like change, the little Scout kicked a
high-standing pebble with fine precision against a mark several
yards away, plumped down on the seat beside Jamie, and inquired
casually, unconcernedly: "What do <i>you</i> say?"</p>

<p>Under the spell of the magic of the story he had heard, Jamie
ran his fingers through his hair. Then he cupped his right hand
over his knee, and put his left arm around the little Scout and
drew the child up to him closely. He dropped his lips against the
tow hair, worked down through its bleached exterior, down through
the dark strands underneath, and close to the small ear he brought
his lips and whispered very reverently: "I say, 'Just God!'"</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. The Aroma of a Spirit
and a Flower</h2>

<p>A few days later Margaret Cameron came to Jamie with a pair of
jackets that she had fashioned from unbleached muslin. A broad band
fitted neatly around his chest and fastened with flat buttons. A
pair of straps, easy when sitting, sufficiently close fitting to
keep the bandages in place when moving around, crossed the
shoulders. When his wound was dressed and he slipped on one of
these contrivances and buttoned it, he felt like a man who had just
been redeemed. The bandage was so much lighter in weight, so much
easier to wear than what he had carried for two years. Above all,
it served his purpose and did not constantly remind him by its
weight and the ceaseless chafing across his shoulders and under his
arms of the fact that it was there.</p>

<p>For a week he and Margaret worked together, "fixing their
fences," they called it. They planned the best time of day to do
the sprinkling. To the extent of the knowledge of either of them,
they watched over the bees. As slowly and easily as possible Jamie
went about everything that week. He kept religiously to the diet
that they were working out, and every morning at ten o'clock he put
on the Master's bathing suit, and armed with an old blanket to
cover his feet and towels for his head and arms, went down and
boldly marched into the Pacific Ocean. After the first few
ventures, he discarded fear and walked in until the waves broke
over him, and before a week had passed he discovered that by lying
on his right side, stroking with his right hand and using his feet,
he could trail his left arm and swim a few strokes. This fact so
delighted him that merely the feeling of exhilaration helped the
circulation of his blood. When he was thoroughly chilled from the
tingle of the cold salt water, then, in a spot he had selected
beginning in a mound of gold primroses and sloping down to the
sands of the beach facing directly to the southwest, he stretched
his long frame on the hot sand, disposed of the blanket and towels
to his comfort, and fell sound asleep. When he awoke he would be
thoroughly warm from the heat of the sands beneath him and his body
would have dried while coated with the salt water.</p>

<p>Then he went through the quaint gate and slowly climbed the
winding stairway that led to the back door. During these climbs he
discovered that he was developing a familiarity with every flower
that grew on either side of the path. Those that he did not know,
Margaret Cameron did, from her years of work that she and the Bee
Master had put upon their gardens together. He found himself
studying the flowers, watching which bees went most frequently to
which flowers, and when he discovered that the Black Germans were
paying more frequent visits to the nasturtiums than to any other
flower, Jamie sneered. He remembered from botanical days
<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>. That was cress, but nasturtiums were
of the same family. The boys in the classes had always called
nasturtiums the "official nose twister" and wasn't it like anything
doing business under the title of Black German to select for an
especial favourite an "official nose twister"? This and other
whimsies began to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>When he reached the house, he went straight to the bathroom for
a shower, applied fresh dressings, and clothed himself, and by that
time Margaret had brought his lunch. After he had eaten he wandered
about the grounds for the twenty minutes prescribed and then
deliberately lay down on the Master's bed and to the music of the
rhythmic breaking of the waves he slept another hour. From that
hour he came to a brimming glass of cold orange juice. As regularly
he took the tomato juice in the morning, and instead of either tea
or coffee, he drank milk with his meals. When he had finished his
nap, he did as much work in the garden as he could do without
tiring himself. Then he went to the bookshelves, but in his new
resolve to fight to be of some good in the world, he passed by the
tempting volumes of romance and Ancient Natural History. He laughed
at them and talked to them and repeated in their faces rich phrases
from their unique pages.</p>

<p>"The bees pluck their young from the air and place them in
cells, do they? The honey falls from the heavens, does it? The best
bees are small, round and variegated, are they?"</p>

<p>So Jamie had his joke with the ancient naturalists and then he
advanced on the moderns and sat down with a book of rules for men
who would be the keepers of bees.</p>

<p>Back in the depths of his mind, Jamie decided that when the Bee
Master returned he would be so weakened that it might be a year at
least before he would be able to go on with his work, and during
that time he would stay on the job, if the Master wanted him, and
he would learn every thing there was to know about bees. The more
he thought of it, the more it appealed to him that, since there was
not the chance for forestry in California that there was in the
East, he would do better and extract fully as much enjoyment out of
life working with bees as he would with trees.</p>

<p>It was after ten days of religious following of this schedule
that Jamie awoke one morning, and instead of arising immediately,
lay still to take stock of himself. He stretched his right leg as
far down in the bed as it would go and wiggled his toes. Fine!
There was not a hint of soreness He tried the left leg with the
same results. Then he tried the right arm and then the left and
then he stretched his whole body and threw his weight on the back
of his head and his heels and drew up his shoulders and eased them
down, and the result of the exercise so delighted him that he tried
it over again. He decided that it might not be a bad thing to work
out a form of exercise and put himself through it every morning on
awakening.</p>

<p>So for himself, and merely of his own volition, he began a
practice which a very great doctor of health recommends for all men
and women who would be physically strong. It was considerably a
matter of stretching and squirming the first morning, but during
the days that followed there developed a sort of rhythmic exercise
that stretched and twisted every muscle in his body. After it he
lay resting half an hour or so and went to the work of the day with
a feeling in his body and an uplift in his heart and brain that a
few short weeks before he had never expected again to experience.
He was beginning to realize that the heat and the nerve strain were
in some way being eliminated from his system. He was beginning to
experience a calm satisfaction in the pit of his stomach as if
there were cooling streams running through his veins instead of
torturing poisoned blood. The result of this feeling was that he
could accomplish very much more in a day among the bees and with
the flowers than he had been doing.</p>

<p>At that he realized that the time was coming speedily when he
must have help. When it came to examining the hives and
ascertaining for sure that each hive had a healthful and happy
queen, that no disease had crept in, he would need help. There was
the question becoming imminent of removing the honey, and it seemed
that there might be too many queens. So the next time he went to
the hospital for a visit with the Bee Master, he asked where he
could secure help when the day came that he would need it, and the
Bee Master gave him the address of John Carey, another keeper of
bees with whom he had occasionally exchanged work in times of honey
collecting and swarming.</p>

<p>As Jamie sat beside the Bee Master's bed and watched him, it
seemed to him that each day that passed marked a distinct point in
the ravages of the disease that was devastating the lean frame
before him. Each time he went, he could see that the Bee Master had
not quite his old strength of voice, that he was slightly weaker in
the clasp of his hands.</p>

<p>When he had finished copying the address and listened to the
instructions that the Master gave him, Jamie sat looking at the
fine old face on the pillow, the skin like parchment, the silken
hair, and it seemed to him that daily a great peace and a quietness
were growing on the brow and in the eyes, and he thought of what
the little Scout had said about the beautiful kind of death that
came softly in the night, and he wondered if any night now that
experience might not befall the Bee Master.</p>

<p>It was while these thoughts were dominant in Jamie's mind that
the same thought must have been passing in the brain of the Bee
Master. His voice was very low and quiet and his eyes seemed
unusually tired as he said: "Jamie MacFarlane, suppose you begin
away back at the beginning and tell me all about the mother who
bore you and your father and what kind of home you were reared
in."</p>

<p>Now, these were subjects upon which Jamie MacFarlane could speak
eloquently on slight provocation, because he had loved his father
and mother with good reason. They had been full Scot stern, but
they had also been over-flowingly Scot, gentle and loving and
tender, and his memories of his home and his childhood were
something beautiful. Jamie, seated beside the bed with the light
from the window falling on his face, spoke slowly with the
deliberation that searches for the salient points, with the loving
impulse that puts in the small details that round out the full
picture. When he had finished with the final description of how he
was brought home from the war to the shock of the knowledge that
both of them were gone, and there was nothing whatever, he sat very
still, looking through the window, and it was the voice of the Bee
Master that called him back.</p>

<p>"And from there on?" he suggested.</p>

<p>So Jamie began again and finished the story. He told it
truthfully, with no deviation whatever except that he omitted the
night of the storm and its subsequent results.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the Bee Master smiled at him, and then he
said: "And what about the bees and the weeks that you have been
among them in the blue garden?"</p>

<p>Jamie answered: "As far as my mind is concerned, the time I have
spent in your home trying to take care of your bees and your
flowers and your trees has been the most beautiful time of my whole
life. I began with a gnawing fire in my breast and a bitter
blackness in my heart and brain; but some way, owing to some things
the little Scout said to me and the clean air and the crisp
sunshine and the beauty all around me, there is a sort of
corresponding beauty that's crept into my heart and my brain, and I
think it's smothered a large part of the bitterness. I was so
desperately tired when I staggered across the road to you to try to
help you reach the hospital that I am in no position to say what my
physical or mental condition was when I came. But I know that
to-day I have done about twice the work in the garden that I could
manage the first day I really tried to look after your
interests."</p>

<p>The Bee Master moved his lean hands over the coverlet. A rare
smile illumined his face.</p>

<p>"That's fine!" he said. "Fine! And would you feel, then, that if
they carry me out of here some of these days and bring me home, a
wreck of a man unable to stand on my feet and carry on my work,
would you feel that you would care to remain with me, that you
would try learning bees from the egg onward?"</p>

<p>"I'd love it," said Jamie. "I'd love to wait on you and help you
back to health over the same path that I've laid out for
myself."</p>

<p>Then he explained to the Master what path he had laid out for
himself, and again the gentle old voice cried: "Fine! Couldn't be
better, and what's more, I can see that you are making it. Each
trip you make to cheer the old man up a little, I can see that your
skin is taking on a healthier hue, that the blue lights of pain and
discouragement are fading out of your eyes. You even speak with a
stronger voice, with the assurance of a man who is captaining his
own soul. I am staking my money that you're going to win through to
health and happiness in the garden that has come the nearest to
bringing me consolation of anything I ever have tried."</p>

<p>The Bee Master lay still and waited a long time. Then he said to
Jamie: "It may seem to you that such confidence as I asked from you
should be met with equal confidence, but I find that my weakness
has made a coward of me. Some day, if you ever want to know what
there is to know concerning me, ask my little side partner. There
was an hour of exceeding blackness in which the little Scout Master
swung over my side fence and walked into my heart and into my life
so securely that when this bitter hour came, almost before I knew
what I had done, I had laid the whole of my burden on the shoulders
of a child, only to learn that however keenly a child may think,
how ever deeply a child may feel, there does not seem to be a large
capacity for shouldering burdens. Children are so occupied with
growing, with amusing themselves, with exploring the wonderful
world around them, with following their impulses to explore and to
fight, that there isn't much possibility of weighting their young
shoulders with responsibility for any one else unless, by chance,
you take them from their companions, from their play, and load them
with sickening burdens of heavy responsibilities that are unnatural
and that often breed rebellion in their young hearts. The little
Scout knows why I left my home and a goodly circle of friends and
came out here alone, and from two acres of rocky land and a few
hives developed two acres of beauty and made homes for millions of
little denizens that swarm in the garden. The little Scout knows my
troubles, but, God knows, I don't believe I am equal to telling
that story again! If the day ever comes when you feel that you need
to know, tell the little Scout that I said you were to be told and
you will get an accurate account of what brought me here, of the
bitter pain I have endured, and of the surcease I have found in the
glory of the sunshine and the song of the sea, in the healing of
the lilies and the consolation of the roses, in absorbing work with
as interesting a branch of the evolution of life as the whole world
affords. I have investigated rather deeply. I will guarantee you
that in the evolution of any living species, in the whole world,
there can be found no life processes more complicated, more
absorbingly interesting, more nearly human than in just the
development of bees. I hope that you are making good use of the bee
books."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "to the exclusion of everything else. The
little Scout started me on the books that, to quote literally,
contained the 'jokes about the bees.' The jokes were so absorbingly
interesting that they held me. Bur if I would render honest service
for the wage I accepted, I realized that I must work intelligently.
So I soon dropped the jokes and went on to the reality. I have
advanced to the place where I can recognize a queen, and I know an
Italian queen from a German queen. I am also able to distinguish a
nurse from a drone and a drone from a worker. Through long hours of
studying the observation hive, I've pretty thoroughly familiarized
myself with what must be going on inside of each of the hives in
those other long rows. As I told you, I had intended to study tree
surgery, but I figure that if there is such a possibility as that I
may become a well man, and since I have no ties, I had better
remain in the same kind of air and sunshine that seems to be
working the miracle that I need to make a whole man of me."</p>

<p>Slowly the Bee Master assented.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I think you're right. I think you're right. I
think you can find even a greater amount of interest in the
intricate and delicate life processes of a bee than in work with
the insensate trees that grow because they must, for however
interesting they may be, and how ever beautiful they may be, the
fact remains that they are not carrying out life processes that
border so nearly on thinking and on reasoning as do the bees."</p>

<p>"I have quite decided," said Jamie, "that I am going to study
hard. I am going on carefully and if you give me the opportunity, I
will make my work among the bees."</p>

<p>"About the location, now," said the Bee Master. "How do you feel
about my location?"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled.</p>

<p>"I know the Atlantic seaboard and quite a bit abroad. I've seen
the coasts of England and France, and I've gone all the way across
this continent. The bay below your place constitutes my whole
experience with the Pacific, but I am fairly sure that in all this
world there is nothing to be found much lovelier than your garden
of perfect blue. You remember that the ancient Chinese called blue
the 'perfect colour'?"</p>

<p>The Bee Master nodded corroboratively.</p>

<p>"There have been days in that azure garden, laddie," he said,
"when God has really given me surcease, when for a minute a
gold-haired vision of childhood has dropped from my mind, when for
a minute the pain of the sin I committed against the woman I loved
has been obliterated. If it can do that for a man carrying the
burden that has been my portion, there is a prospect that a young
man with health in his body and a heart without secrets might find
the same great blessing in daily beneficence."</p>

<p>Jamie looked at the Bee Master and winced. For one second he sat
with his lips open and his tongue ready to fashion words, and then
he reflected that he had no right to tell a secret unless it were
his secret alone. He had no right to describe the Storm Woman. He
had no right to tell any man of the shame baby he had covered with
his name. If there had been anything magnanimous in his deed, it
would lose the fine flavour, the beauty that such a deed might
have, if he talked about it. If he lived, there might possibly be
something more to that phase of his adventure. If he died, he would
face his Maker more of a man if he kept his mouth shut concerning a
subject that drove so noble a specimen of womanhood as the woman he
had married to the course she had taken.</p>

<p>"The next time you come," said the Bee Master, "make it on
Saturday and bring the Scout Master with you. That little Scout
gets under my cuticle so deeply that I am hungry for the odour of
horse and the tang of dog, and all the outdoors that carries
wherever the Scout Master goes."</p>

<p>Jamie leaned forward with a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Just between us," he said, "could you give me any accurate
information as to the sex of the Scout Master?"</p>

<p>The Bee Master leaned back.</p>

<p>"I could go no farther than my own conclusions," he said. "And
it wouldn't be fair to the Scout Master to deal in surmises. Did
you ever have any conversation on the subject?"</p>

<p>"I asked point blank," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"And what were you told?" inquired the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"That if I could not tell, it didn't make any difference."</p>

<p>The Bee Master's head rolled back on the pillows. He laughed
until a nurse came racing. As he wiped his eyes with the
handkerchief she gave him, he said: "Well, really now, isn't that
about the truth? Does it make a particle of difference?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that it does," said Jamie. "I'm sure it doesn't
seem to have made any with you. I see no reason why it should with
me."</p>

<p>He rose to go.</p>

<p>"We'll make it Saturday," he said, "and I think you'll be asked
if I got your hot dog right."</p>

<p>The Bee Master reached under the pillow and pulled out a small
envelope, a tiny prescription envelope.</p>

<p>"In case I am," he said, "the one thing I've never done is to
lie to my little partner. I'll tell the truth. I'll show the money
waiting under the pillow until the doctor says I may have the
treat."</p>

<p>"I see," said Jamie, "and I think you're right. I don't believe
we get very far with the lies we tell children."</p>

<p>"We get nowhere," said the Bee Master, sternly. "We get nowhere.
They see through us or discover our deception later every
time."</p>

<p>Jamie arose and went over to the side of the bed and took the
Bee Master's hand, and suddenly he bent down and laid his lips on
his forehead and before he realized what he was doing, he found
that he was on his knees be side the bed. He heard his voice
saying: "When I was a youngster, my father and mother taught me to
pray. In the intervening years I got so sure of my own sufficiency
and efficiency that I grabbed the bait and ran, but lately, when I
got to the place where I could truthfully say, in the language of
the old hymn, 'Other refuge have I none,' I've been on my knees
creeping back toward the foot of the throne. I am asking, if it's
consistent with the divine plan, that I may be given back my
strength and my youth, that I may be of some help in making my
country a good place wherein to live, to work, and to love. I am
going home, and I am going to kneel beside your bed, and I am going
to ask God, if it is the best thing for you, to let you come home,
to let you have more of life, more time to enjoy the beauty that
you have created; and if that is not His plan, then I am going to
ask Him to give you the surcease that the little Scout Master says
was vouchsafed to little old Aunt Beth."</p>

<p>The Bee Master smiled.</p>

<p>"I heard that story," he said. "I was told about it when it
happened. It was a very wonderful thing that those two children
could have gotten such a lovely conception of the journey to the
Far Country, and I am very sure it is the right conception."</p>

<p>Jamie kissed the Bee Master on the forehead, and then he lifted
to his lips the slender hands of the sick man and, turning, went
quietly from the room. As he went, he passed a beautiful blue bowl
filled to overflowing with more of the yellow roses that he had
seen growing only in the garden of Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>All the way home Jamie rode in deep thought. Would the Bee
Master ever be able to come back to the house with the gracious
face turned to the roadway, with the luring garden looking to the
sea? Would he ever again sit in his great chair by his fireside and
read from his loved books? Jamie realized that he was not waiting
to reach home and the side of the Bee Master's bed to offer up his
petition. He was asking God as he rode through the turmoil of the
streets of the city, crowded on either hand by people absorbed in
the affairs of life, to grant even a short respite to the man he
was rapidly learning to idolize.</p>

<p>When he left the car, he walked slowly up the roadway to the
house of the Bee Master. He entered it and stood irresolute for a
minute and then he walked to the telephone and from a list he had
made, selected the number that the little Scout had given him. When
he called it, the rich, sweet voice of a woman answered.</p>

<p>Then said Jamie, "This is James MacFarlane of the Sierra Madre
Apiary. Is the Scout Master at home?"</p>

<p>"Not at this minute," came the reply.</p>

<p>"Would you contract," asked Jamie, "to deliver this message?
I've been to the hospital for a visit with the Bee Master. He is
homesick to see his little partner. He has asked particularly for a
visit the coming Saturday. I thought I had better tell you about it
before arrangements were made with the boys for a scouting party or
some kind of a hike."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a good idea," said the voice at the other end of
the line. "I'll make a note of the message and I'll see that it is
delivered. I should be interested in knowing how you found the Bee
Master."</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say," said Jamie. "He seems so frail that a
strong draft of air coming in the window beside him might carry his
breath away."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said the gentle voice. "That is too bad. The children
dearly love him. Any one can see that he is a noble specimen of
manhood."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that, too," said Jamie. "His home here, his
library, his room, the pictures on his walls, the furniture he
uses, everything seems to indicate that he could not be finer."</p>

<p>"I've heard about you," said the voice over the wire. "If you're
fine enough to appreciate the Bee Master to the fullest extent, it
means that you are pretty fine yourself. We'd be glad to have you
come in with our little person some day and take dinner with
us."</p>

<p>"Why, thank you," said Jamie. "That's awfully kind. I've been
pretty seedy and I've been shunning people for quite some time, but
I think, if there's an evening when you would not be having guests,
I'd enjoy coming with the Scout Master and sharing your fireside
for an hour."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Come any time you choose," said the voice
whose every cadence Jamie liked. "There never was a time when there
wasn't enough food on our table for one more and room to squeeze in
one more chair. Come right along any time you'd like!"</p>

<p>Jamie hung up the telephone and looked around him. He was not in
the mood for reading. He stepped into the kitchen and drank his
daily quota of orange juice and when he reached the back door there
was a call in the air, a call that he answered with his blood. He
went down the back walk and out of the gate and to his particular
mound of beach primroses. He stretched himself on the sand, pulled
his hat over his eyes to shade them from the sun, fitted his figure
into the curves of the mound, and presently he was unconscious in
the unconsciousness of deep, sound, refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>By and by he awoke, and even before he was fully conscious,
sniffed the air with questing nostrils. "That's strange!" said
Jamie to himself. "I chose this mound for its particularly inviting
curve, but I didn't see any sand Verbena on it."</p>

<p>Jamie drew a deep breath to be sure that he had not been
mistaken as to the odour that was mingling with the primroses
around him. He realized that so near to evening the verbenas would
be opening to distil their sweetest fragrance. Then he opened his
eyes and straightened up to look around him, and he discovered that
his right hand was full of verbena blooms. He stared down at it;
then he whirled to his knees and took a long survey up the beach
and down the beach, and then he shifted over and scanned the sand
with eager eyes.</p>

<p>There it was. The footprint of a woman&mdash;not the peaked
toed, pointed heel that he sometimes saw tilting over the sand. The
imprint of a foot intended for business, shod in a shoe reasonable
in width, unusual in length, with decidedly a commonsense heel.
Jamie sprang up and clasping his flowers followed that row of
footprints straight down the beach to the throne. With wildly
beating heart and head awhirl, he climbed the throne and peered
over and he found that he was sickeningly disappointed that it was
vacant. He took his own seat to the far south to think. He remained
there, carefully sniffing the rock beside him. The tang of sage,
the odour of verbena, a whiff of primrose, were distinctly
discernible. Not to lose time, he made his way down the rock. But
the track that led to it did not lead from it. Gravel and fine
stone and rock over which footsteps could not be distinguished
formed the way from the throne to the road way above. She must have
gone that way. So Jamie followed. But when he reached the road he
could not see a trace of any one that looked in the very least like
the figure of the girl whom he was seeking. He went back to the
throne and over the path he had come, and at the primrose mount he
took up the trail and followed it south along the beach until he
lost it among the entangling primroses and verbena, among the sea
figs. Just at the point where he lost it, Jamie discovered the
reason why he had lost it. It had become obliterated by the
tramping of dozens of little feet, funny little tracks, all of them
the footprints of children. Blindly Jamie followed down the beach,
and once he found a spot where the footprint he was searching for
stood plain in the sand beside a spot where the sand verbena grew,
and all around it there came again the obliterating fleet of
childish footprints.</p>

<p>Then Jamie went home. He opened the gate and care fully closed
it after him. Half the length of the steps he sat down. For the
first time he brought the little bunch of flowers he held around to
the range of his vision.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it!" said Jamie to himself. "Can you beat it? That
close, and I <i>slept</i>! I must be more of a log than I am of a
man!"</p>

<p>He sat staring at the delicate pinkish purple flowers that, as
was their wont in the evening, were opening wide with the heat of
his hand and distilling all around him the exquisitely subtle and
delicate odours of their particular perfume. Once Jamie looked out
toward the sea.</p>

<p>"Then I'm right," he said. "She does live somewhere near here.
At least, she haunts this beach. And she knew me, even with my face
covered. For that matter, at a pinch I might know her form better
than I do her face! But what's the object in filling my hand with
the most appealing little flowers in all the world if she hasn't
any use for me in any other way?"</p>

<p>Jamie thought that over carefully, and then he told the Pacific
Ocean about it.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," he said, "I've filled my purpose with
her. She has the name she asked for. She has the ring and she has
the certificate. She hasn't any further use for me, but this does
prove that she has me on her mind, that at least she didn't use me
and forget me."</p>

<p>Then Jamie dropped the Pacific as being rather impersonal and
confined himself to the flowers. He held them daintily in his
slender fingers and looked at them with absorbed, questioning
eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "that you could talk. I wish your little
faces could tell me what you saw in her face when she gathered you.
I wish that I knew exactly what was in her heart. I wish I knew
whether she is very sure that she has finished with me, or whether
there's something more that I could do for her."</p>

<p>Then Jamie shook himself and sat straight.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" he said, and this time he addressed a
particularly tall, particularly straight, unusually hand some
yellow hollyhock growing beside the pergola. "By gracious! I'm not
so sure that she'd get me any farther if she did want me! It's one
thing to offer a name you haven't any use for and a body that's not
going to last so very long as a sop to dry a woman's tears, not of
repentance, but of fear, a fear that the world is going to shun the
leper of disgrace, fear that the accusing eyes of a child are going
to look into her face and find her wanting it's one thing to do
what you can when your time for doing anything is strictly limited.
It's only a few days now until this month is going to be passed,
and if Margaret Cameron looks at my breast and can truthfully say
that the fire is dying out of the wound there, if I am not
deceiving myself in thinking that I am infinitely more of a man
than I was thirty days ago, that's another proposition. That's a
proposition that I hadn't figured on when I essayed the bridegroom
stunt. And that's a proposition that's going to take a lot of
thought. It doesn't behove any man to assume a 'I am holier than
thou' attitude, but at the same time, a man certainly has to do
consider able thinking before he makes up his mind as to whether he
wants to assume the rearing of a child fathered by a man who had
the streak of yellow in his make-up that made him neglect to give
his child honourable parentage." Jamie thought that over. He
thought for a long time. He thought deep and hard. He thought from
the back ground of Scottish prejudice. He remembered personal
pride. He thought from the background of public opinion. Then he
cast them all aside and thought straight from the shoulder. From
somewhere a legal phrase crept into his brain. "Mitigating
circumstances." He could not think of the form of the Storm Girl as
he had held it tight in his arms, he could not think upon the
silkiness of her hair and the perfume of her breath and the wild
odours that clung about her, he could not force himself to think
that she was anything but fresh and young and healthful both of
body and of mind. It was not compatible with ordinary reason that
she should have polluted her body and smirched her soul, that she
had broken the laws of God and broken the laws of man, and risked,
not only for herself, but for the life that was to come, that
blinding, blighting thing which has been so comprehensively
designated as the finger of scorn.</p>

<p>"Whoever," said Jamie to a particularly intelligent mocking bird
that happened at that minute to be perched on a brace of the
pergola near him, "whoever invented that little phrase about the
'finger of scorn' didn't make it half strong enough. What they
should have called it was the red-hot poker of scorn, the iron that
can be thrust against the breast of a woman and that all her days
can sear her soul and be set scorching anew at any unforeseen
moment, and all because for a minute she probably loved a man so
infinitely better than she loved herself that she risked her soul
and lost it, so far as the world is concerned. It is a blessed
thing that she did not lose it with God, for there was the
Magdalene whom He forgave, and the Magdalene was an old-timer who
perhaps deserved what the mob gave her. But after all, God did
forgive her, and it wouldn't do to allow God to be kinder to a
woman than a Scotsman would be."</p>

<p>The mocking bird flirted his tail and cocked his eye and said,
quoting an oriole on a plum tree in the garden, "Once more now!
Once more now!"</p>

<p>Jamie grinned.</p>

<p>"Have I got to do better than that?" he said. "Well, how would
it do if I said that I'd break my word not to try to find the Storm
Girl, and start out with the deliberate intention of finding her?
And how would it do if I said that I honestly and truly felt the
'mitigating circumstances' to be mitigating, and if I really turned
out, say in about a year from now, to be a sound man, maybe she
could overlook my scars and maybe she could explain, and maybe we
could find something really beautiful in life together?"</p>

<p>Then the mocking bird remembered a particularly brilliant
performance he had heard on a date palm down in Mexico from a
bloody red bird and threw a repetition straight at Jamie's head,
"Good cheer! Good cheer! Good cheer!"</p>

<p>So Jamie looked at his flowers again and saw that they were
beginning to droop their lovely heads. He got up and hurried to
find the little copper bowl in order to put them in water. When he
had very carefully arranged them in the bowl, he carried it to the
bedroom and set it on the stand beside the bed that could be drawn
close to his pillow.</p>

<p>All the rest of that day, Jamie stumbled as he walked, not
because of weakness, but because he was dreaming a peculiarly
absorbing dream.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12. Seeing Through Veiled
Places</h2>

<p>THE remainder of that week, outside of the time consumed in
carrying out the rgime Jamie had laid down for himself, he spent
in the garden and with the books. With the trees and flowers he had
a sure hand. He had learned how to make flowers thrifty and
healthful in the meagre climate of New England. With water to
lavish, with almost uninterrupted sunshine, with warm days and cool
nights very frequently foggy, Jamie found himself facing a
reversion of all he knew about gardening. He very speedily learned
that in a land so lavish with sunshine and water, his task was
going to be, not to stimulate flowers to growth, but to cut back
the growth in order to draw the strength of the plant more directly
toward the production of flowers. Much garden lore he accumulated
from Margaret Cameron&mdash;practical things that she had learned
through experience: how to loosen soil; how to fertilize; how to
water discreetly and to the purpose. Jamie already knew how to cut
back effectively. What to do to secure flowers instead of leaves he
soon learned.</p>

<p>All that week he was looking forward to Saturday, planning for
the day on which he and the little Scout should go to visit the Bee
Master. He had set the hour for their starting at two o'clock. It
was fifteen minutes past two when the little fellow swung over the
high board fence and came racing down the walk. Jamie was rather
surprised. He had expected, from the casual and business like
manner with which the little Scout had conducted the fight with the
Indians, that equal promptness and executive ability would be
displayed in keeping a date.</p>

<p>He was waiting on the bench under the jacqueranda when the small
figure sailed over the fence. Scanning the little Scout closely,
Jamie thought he detected traces of recent tears. The eyes were
suspiciously red of rim; the cheeks smeared with the indisputable
evidence of childish grief. Instantly Jamie's heart went out in
protest. Who had any business to hurt the little Scout? What was
it, beside the sting of a bee, that could bring tears to so valiant
a small soul? Without taking time for thought, Jamie stretched out
both hands. Without an instant's hesitation, the little Scout
walked straight into his arms and laid a confiding head on his
breast, and Jamie's arms closed up tight.</p>

<p>"You didn't have a fall and hurt yourself, did you?"</p>

<p>Jamie could feel the shake of negation on his shoulder and the
gulp in the throat.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Jamie, "but if we're not to keep the Bee
Master waiting, we must clean up your face and be on our way."</p>

<p>The little Scout instantly stood erect.</p>

<p>"Clean up! Clean up! Can't you tell by one look at me that I've
been parboiled and scoured and curry combed?"</p>

<p>"You do give evidence of having had a bath," said Jamie. "It's
only the region of your eyes that needs slight attention."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then," said the little Scout, "if you say I need it,
I reckon I do. I had so everlastingly much trouble with Mother and
the Princess that I thought I never should get started. Women make
me dead tired!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the ladies?" inquired Jamie as he led
the way to the bathroom, moistened a wash cloth and began
operations in order to make sure that they were properly conducted.
To his surprise the youngster stood still and lifted a submissive
face, and as Jamie operated, the child continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother is always nagging about cleaning your nails and
spooning out your ears and wild hairs in your eyelashes and
ingrowing toenails! You'd get to be a burden to yourself if you'd
try to pay any attention to all the things that woman wants done.
When it comes to the Princess, I'd give my best jack-knife if Dad
would fire her."</p>

<p>"Fire a princess?" said Jamie. "You're suggesting an unseemly
proceeding. A princess is supposed to be treated with a very high
degree of consideration."</p>

<p>The youngster shrugged lean shoulders and sniffed.</p>

<p>"Well, this princess we've got in our kitchen hails from some
little crossroad in Europe, and she's used to being waited on
herself, and so she knows too darned well how to wait on other
people. All of us got to go through too much pollyfoxing. It's too
familiar to call us by our first names and say anything in plain
English. You've got to beat around the bush like a scoutin' Indian
to put it across that you'd like a little more butter on your
toast, or the strawberry jam just ain't. What's the use of all the
fuss? When it comes to clothes, both all two of 'em make me sick!
That's what this row was about. I wanted to wear my clothes, 60
when I got back I could meet the fellows and go down on the beach
for a sham battle. Mother would have it that I couldn't go with you
and I couldn't go to the hospital without being all rigged up until
I looked like&mdash;" the little Scout stopped and dug an enraged
toe in the rug before the wash bowl and then concluded&mdash;"until
I looked like such a sissy that the Bee Master wouldn't 'a' owned
me! And to tell it like a want ad, I was just forced to dress the
way they wanted me to and at the same time I had to steal out the
things I meant to wear and hide 'em in a hedge down the street a
house or two, and then I had to duck the hedge and get the bundle
and find a place where I could change, and I'm none too sure my
things will be where I left 'em when I go back. Always making a lot
of time killing and a lot of worry!"</p>

<p>"I see," said Jamie, slowly, "but didn't you want to be dressed
in the best you had when you went to visit a very fine gentleman,
whom you love as you told me you love the Bee Master?"</p>

<p>The little Scout drew up and heaved a deep breath. Into play
came the gesture that had now come to be in separable from the
Scout Master's personality.</p>

<p>"About loving the Bee Master&mdash;that's a thing that if ain't
very good to talk about. That gets down among your feelin's where
you want 'em covered up, where things ain't much of
<i>anybody's</i> business. If it was any thing that would do the
Bee Master any good, I'd stand fire and water to do it; but when
it's just nonsense, what's the use? The Bee Master likes me or he
wouldn't have sent for me, and he never in his life saw me as
dolled up as I am right now!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master squirmed, thrust forth a stocking clad leg and
a patent leather shoe.</p>

<p>"Look at that now! Wouldn't it make you sick? What's legs for if
you can't use just leg? Who invented stockings anyway? Scratchy,
itchy things and in a country where you don't <i>need</i> 'em! I'll
tell the world, I'd 'a' shed the socks, too, but I knew I was late.
Come on, let's go!"</p>

<p>Jamie hung up the wash cloth, used the towel, and started to
apply the comb. The Scout Master backed away with out-thrown
hands.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" cried the little Scout. "I'm not allowed to use
other people's combs. They might have tarantulas or Gila monsters
or octopuses on 'em!"</p>

<p>Jamie laid back the comb and reached his hand. The Scout Master
laid a hard, scarred, wiry hand in his and walked sedately beside
him until they passed through the front gate.</p>

<p>Then the child looked up and remarked: "Now I guess we better
release the clutch. If any of the fellows would see us, there's
just a possibility that I'd get toppled off my throne. My Scouts
are about all I can handle some of these days, anyway."</p>

<p>When they reached the street car and took their places, Jamie
looked down at the figure beside him and decided that it was too
lean, that the physical condition was not what it should be.</p>

<p>"Do you mind," he asked, "telling me how old you are?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Scout Master, "I don't. I'm ten years old, and
lemme tell you, I've lived 'em! I've lived 'em all the way from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and I've lived in cities where
you had to be for ever dodging the police, and the bandits, and the
kidnappers, in Mother's imagination. You couldn't get a kidnapper
to touch me with a lightnin' rod. They'd take me for a regular
roughneck!"</p>

<p>Jamie decided that the best way to get information was to keep
quiet, so he said nothing.</p>

<p>"I've ridden on ships and boats and launches and paddled canoes
and travelled on trains from the New York Limited to the
Missionary, and believe me, I've had my eyes open and my ears open
all the way! Last time we came out we missed the Limited we had
reservations on and we had to take the Missionary or stay five days
in Chicago and none of us could stick that, so we took the
Missionary. The rest of 'em like to died, but I had heaps of fun,
and lemme tell you, I swelled my roll something pretty. I'd just go
through the cars and nice and polite I'd say to the hot, dirty
folks, 'For five cents I'll get you a nice, cool drink of water.'
If they looked like a Rolls-Rich, I'd make it ten, 'cause more of
'em got caught than us. You ought to 'a' seen 'em fall for it! I
got so much I had to bank in my suitcase in our drawing-room and
Nannette saw me and baa-hed like a sheep, and I thought 'all was
lost'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, was it?" inquired Jamie.</p>

<p>"Not total. You see, Dad and Mother wasn't in that load. First
our Personal Conductor looked a mixshure, but finally she got to
laughing 'cause I told her the funds was the result of the idle
rich grindin' the masses, and she's a dead sport. She said if I'd
go fifty-fifty with the Orthopedic Home, I could keep it. I was
lief as not on that." The little Scout paused. "Ever thank God for
good legs?"</p>

<p>Jamie said, "I have!" fervently and the little Scout grinned and
continued, "I've gone a good deal scoutin' round with the Scouts,
and, of course, some of it at school would stick to me by accident.
My mother's not so slow, and let me tell you there's things you can
learn from my dad! Maybe you think he hasn't been a giddy ranger!
Boy! He's been city editor of a big newspaper, and he's been two
years in a scoutin' plane over Germany, and he knows about making
pictures. My dad's a reg'lar leapin' tuna!"</p>

<p>"I am going to meet him some of these days," said Jamie.</p>

<p>The little Scout looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>The inquiry was terse and forceful.</p>

<p>"When I called your telephone number to tell you about to-day,
your mother invited me to dinner."</p>

<p>The little Scout's face fell.</p>

<p>"Aw!" The ejaculation was too laden with disapproval to escape
notice.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you don't want me to come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, that's another one of them unpleasant issues," said the
small person. "Sure I want you to have grub! You can live on
casabas and lobster and home brew for all of me. But what's the use
of draggin' Mother and Dad and Nannette and Jimmy and the Royal
Family of Denmark into our affairs? Why ain't it good enough for us
to go on being friends just the way we are?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie. "I wouldn't think of coming if you
don't want me."</p>

<p>"There you go again!" said the small person. "Did I ever say I
didn't want you? Did I ever say I didn't fall for you hard? Did I
ever say I wasn't hittin' on six cylinders every time I see you?
No, I never did! But just because I say there's places I want to
see you and places I don't, you go and make it look like I didn't
want you any old time and any old place! I thought from your mug
you'd be a guy that'd play the game square!"</p>

<p>"Well, I try to play the game square," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, you're out of luck, you're all wet!" said the small
person, "if you think you're playin' the game square when you tell
me I don't want you just because there's certain places I don't
want you! Couldn't a fellow have reasons? Couldn't there be some
things a body wouldn't want to bleat all over the pasture?"</p>

<p>Jamie reached down and put his arm around the small person and
drew the little figure up against him and found that the frame he
was holding was quivering from head to foot.</p>

<p>"The days are fairly long for you, aren't they?" asked
Jamie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon the days are all right," answered the little
Scout. "They're the same days other kids have, and a lot of 'em get
fat on 'em. Cast your optics on Fat Ole Bill, if you don't believe
it. It's just that there's times when I pretty near know that my
job's about all I can handle."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you know how you get to be a Scout Master, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Because he wanted information, Jamie said he was not sure. The
little Scout shrugged exasperated shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure! I'm darned sure! You get to be a Scout Master
by <i>mastering</i> the Scouts, that's how! If they are jumping,
you jump the farthest. If they are swinging, you swing the highest.
If they are running, you spread your white wings and beat 'em to
it. If it's bicycles, you just lie down over the handle bars and
paw the air for dear life and let the rest eat your dust. If it's
canoeing, your canoe makes the waves the rest of them upset in. If
it comes to a slugging match, you got to have your jewjits so
thoroughly in practice that you can sling any of the bunch in any
direction you want 'em to circulate. Being a Scout Master means
mastering the bunch; and Fat Ole Bill is getting to the place where
I'm goin' some if I handle him! The Nice Child is easier, but let
me tell you, Angel Face is putting on muscle these days! He didn't
used to be so well. He was fussing around with appendicitis.
Anywhere in the region of his right side even a little crack would
knock him out and make him sweat blood. But now he's kicking out of
it in fine shape. He's going to make a great big, strong man. In
just about a year more he's going to find out what I know already:
that if he knew as much as I do, he'd know it's only luck if I
handle him now. And whenever they find <i>that</i> out they's
mutiny, and the fellow that <i>can</i> handle the bunch is due to
usurp the throne. I got that out of a history book, and it's good
stuff. It sounds unpleasant, but it's a plain statement of facts.
Scout Master and The Limit is the same thing."</p>

<p>"In other words, you are working too hard," said Jamie. "You are
trained down so fine that you are on the edge, and while the rest
of them are gaining, you are losing. Is that the point?"</p>

<p>The Scout Master meditated.</p>

<p>"I guess the real needle-fine point of it is that there's one of
me and there's three of them, and sometimes they beg so hard that
we let in two or three more that I can't eat 'em raw; I got to
roast 'em or quit. And on those days I finish up just about out of
ammunition. Nannette says that I keep on fightin' and rollin' and
kickin' until I horn in on her territory sometimes, but she ain't
got any thing comin' on me. I never had the hysterics and bellowed
out in the night until I waked the family just 'cause the turtles
didn't eat <i>all</i> of anything!"</p>

<p>Jamie tightened his arm around the Scout Master and slumped his
body into an inviting curve, and in three min utes he held against
him a youngster tired to exhaustion at the middle of the day and
fast asleep.</p>

<p>When they reached the hospital, Jamie gently shook the Scout
Master, and instantly the youngster was up with blinking eyes and
an ingratiating smile, ready to prove that unconsciousness of what
was going on was for some one else; that particular fellow always
was and always had been wide awake. The instant they were inside
the hospital, the Scout Master reached for Jamie's hand, crowded up
beside him, and walked to the elevator and down the long halls cat
stepping.</p>

<p>Evidently they were expected. The Bee Master's door was open; a
screen shielded the bed from the view of the passersby. The Scout
Master sent one look across the room and to the open window and
nudged Jamie with a sharp elbow.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed how Margaret Cameron's roses have fallen off
in bloomin' lately?"</p>

<p>The whisper was sibilant; but Jamie caught it and smiled as he
noted the flowers, and then he heard a further whisper.</p>

<p>"She's always cottoning up to him. She's got the idea that he's
her personal property. There's been more than one day when she'd
about given her eyes if I'd 'a' gone home, but as long as the Bee
Master says, 'Stay,' I'm staying!"</p>

<p>Jamie rounded the screen and the Scout Master followed and stood
back until Jamie shook hands with the Bee Master and stepped aside.
Then the small Scout walked up before the Master's bed, wide-eyed,
and took one good look and changed colour, changed slowly from red
lips and tinted cheeks to a spreading white. But the heels came
together with a click. The figure stood very straight. The salute
was according to rule and snappy to the superlative degree. The
grin that overspread the small features was ingratiating. The Bee
Master held out shaking hands and suddenly&mdash;Jamie thought he
never had seen a movement quite so sudden; he wasn't sure how the
intervening space was cleared&mdash;the little figure simply arose
in a leap and dived into the bed. The Bee Master made a good catch,
although he caught his breath at the same time, because he was
shaken by the suddenness of the plunge. But he had the little Scout
tight in his arms, and the child was thoroughly draped over the
chest of the Bee Master. A small hand was gripping the old white
head on either side, and from forehead to chin a shower of short
hot kisses was raining over the Bee Master's face. The little Scout
sat straight up on the bed and suddenly big tears shot one after
another across the childish face and a little sharp wail that cut
deeper than a knife piped out, "Oh, God! I wish you didn't have to
suffer so!"</p>

<p>The Bee Master's chin pointed toward the ceiling. He lifted his
right hand and gathered his lower lip into folds and gave it
outside pressure to reinforce it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Buddy, I've thought about that myself," he said, "and I've
sort of wished it, but it seems to be in the divine plan, or
through some negligence of mine in taking proper care of the
machinery as I've come along, and so I have to take the
consequences. But don't you mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>do</i> mind!" said the little Scout. A hand was
jerked backward in the direction of Jamie. "He's all right. He's a
good scout. He had sense enough to get behind the tree and use what
he could find when the Red skins attacked us. He's good stuff, a
sure fire thing, but he don't think himself, that he's
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>The Bee Master glanced at Jamie and their eyes met and held.</p>

<p>"Take a chair," he said to Jamie. "Draw up close here.' I want
to tell you something, but first I want to ask you something." He
looked straight at the Scout Master. "You're fairly sure," he said,
"that the man I left to keep the bees is the right kind of a
man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure," said the Scout Master, promptly. "You couldn't
get him to do a low-down, mean trick to save you!"</p>

<p>"That's all right then," said the Bee Master. Then he turned to
Jamie. "And you," he said, "have you become rather well acquainted
with my little partner here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've made a start," said Jamie. "We haven't had so much of
a chance. The little Scout is in school, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, what I'm interested in knowing," said the Bee Master, "is
whether you've got a feeling that my little partner plays the game
square, doesn't do any mean tricks, is willing to help the other
fellow, knows how to salute and to revere the flag of our country,
and has a proper reverence for the Great Giver of all good and
perfect gifts."</p>

<p>Jamie thought an instant and then he nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "yes, I think we've come pretty close to at
least touching on all that ground. I think if you had searched the
whole world over, you couldn't have found a more genuine little
human being to make your partner in the keeping of the bees."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the Bee Master, "that's all I wanted to
know. Merely if you liked each other. If you are getting along well
together. In case I should have to stay here for quite a time, or
in case I should get better and have to make quite a long journey,
I just wanted to know if you would keep the garden growing and keep
the bees happy. You know it's something of a trick, if you have
been studying the books carefully; you know it isn't a thing that
every one can do, just keeping two acres of bees happy, two acres
of life thriving."</p>

<p>Then he addressed Jamie directly.</p>

<p>"There will be times when you must have help," he said. "I told
you about the right man the last time you were here. If you will
call Mr. Carey and tell him the circumstances when you find in your
examination that the last cell of any hive has been filled, and the
bees are growing restless, he will come and help you harvest the
honey. He will show you how. Then you can render him the same
service and that way you will neither one be put to the expense of
hiring a party who may not be compatible to the bees. He will teach
you what the first signs of foul brood are and how to go to work on
it, and as far as the rest is concerned, my little side partner
here can tell you anything you need to know in taking care of the
bees. Can't you, Buddy?" asked the Bee Master, tightening his
arm.</p>

<p>"I sure can!" answered the youngster. "I have put him wise to
every single thing you ever told me about a bee. I haven't forgot
the first word of anything you told me and I can pretty near hit
the bull's-eye on anything you ever read me from a book. I might
not have just all of the big, high-soundin' words, but I passed on
the proper meaning."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you could," said the Bee Master. "I will bear you
out in that. I never read anything to you that you failed in
getting the proper meaning."</p>

<p>"And, too, you know," said the little Scout, "that you read
somepin' wonderful! You go very slow, and you pronounce your words
so that almost anything you read is like poetry, and you put in
little explanations where the language gets extensive. Most anybody
could understand what you read."</p>

<p>Then with a sudden rush the Scout slid from the bed and, turning
around, smoothed the coverlet and dipped deep in a trouser pocket
and brought forth a grimy, round-cornered pair of dice. With a
flourish of triumph these were laid before the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"I won't get you all het up throwin' against you to day," said
the Scout Master. "This is the luckiest set I got. I'm goin' to
leave 'em with you so as if times come when you can have a pillow
propped up, you'll have 'em to play with. Would a nurse be too
puddin'-headed to throw with you? Could you teach her just how to
roll the bones right? Could you teach her?" The Scout Master
stopped suddenly. "If a woman's got sense enough to take care of
sick people and give 'em their medicine right and bathe 'em and rub
'em and take away the pain, I reckon she can throw dice. So, of
course, you'll have somebody to play with you. I just kind of got
the feeling that there can't anybody do anything just exactly the
way <i>we</i> do it."</p>

<p>The Scout Master looked at the Bee Master and the Bee Master
looked at the Scout Master and each smiled a smile so rarely
beautiful that his whole face was trans figured.</p>

<p>"Well, as a secret, between us, and not letting that tall, lean
Scotsman there hear what we are saying, of course, such old friends
as we are, people that have been so many years with each other, we
<i>do</i> have ways that nobody else can quite understand. We
<i>do</i> satisfy each other a little bit better than any one else
could. I have a very nice nurse. She will play with me, and I can't
tell you how fine I think it is of you to leave your <i>best</i>
set with me. I'll take great care of them, and if it just happens
that the nurse is so puddin'-headed that she can't roll the bones
right, I'll ask Jamie to bring them back to you some of these
days."</p>

<p>The Scout Master nodded. Then from a hip pocket was brought out
a small roll done in tissue paper. This was spread on the bed and
opened up, and before the amazed eyes of Jamie and the Bee Master
there billowed over the bed yards and yards of gaudy silk and satin
flowered, plaided, and striped ribbons. The Scout Master ran
appreciative fingers through the gaudy mass and shook it out.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't guess in a frog's croak how I got these. A few
years ago, before all the girls took to painting their mouths and
their faces like the Indians, and all of them got the shingles,
they was addicted to ribbons. Ribbons just raged. You couldn't get
'em bright enough and you couldn't get 'em broad enough, and you
couldn't get 'em stiff enough. Nannette used to look like the
ribbon counter at Wanamaker's or Marshall Field's or Robinson's
when she'd come down to breakfast. And then, just like that," the
Scout Master snapped a thumb and second finger with a spang to show
how instantaneous 'that' was, "just like <i>that</i>, ribbons were
out, and Nannette had spent all her pin money on ribbons until she
had a lean and hungry look every time she passed a hot-dog stand or
an Eskimo-pie wagon. Ain't they the prettiest things! I liked to
see Nannette wear 'em. She couldn't get 'em too bright to suit me,
nor too broad, nor too flowery. She had a whole drawer full of 'em.
But when she shingled, I asked her if I could have 'em. She's got a
business head on her all right! She soaked me two bits, but I paid
it because I knew what they were worth. Then I took 'em down to the
Princess in the kitchen and I told her she could have two that she
liked the best to make her cases for her embroidery silks if she'd
wash the rest of 'em and iron out the creases and make 'em pretty
for me. I wasn't too <i>lazy</i> to do it myself, but I wasn't
right sure how much soap to put on 'em, or what kind, and swingin'
an electric iron is a profession you got to learn. You can't flip
the dust off your shoulder into anybody's eye unless you've had a
good deal of dust there to flip, and that's the way it is with
swinging an electric iron. You've got to know how to do it before
you get results."</p>

<p>The Scout Master shook out the ribbons.</p>

<p>"Now, one thing you can do is to take 'em one at a time and just
slip 'em through your fingers and look how silky they are and how
lovely the flowers are and what beautiful colours there are in the
stripes and how they run into each other."</p>

<p>Before the eyes of the Bee Master there was held up one ribbon
of delicate hues.</p>

<p>"You know," said the small person, "the man who in vented
that&mdash;if it wasn't a woman&mdash;whoever did it&mdash;had
rainbows on the brain. See the violet and the orange and the
purple? See how the colours mix and blend? That's about as good a
rainbow as God ever set in the sky to make a sign to His people
that He would keep His covenants with man. S. S. That means Sunday
School."</p>

<p>With fingers busy with the ribbons, the Scout Master glanced
over toward Jamie.</p>

<p>"Do you know the Bible pretty good?"</p>

<p>"My father was a minister," said Jamie. "I know the Bible from
cover to cover."</p>

<p>"Then you know that about rainbows?" asked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie. "I know."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything prettier?" asked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie. "In any literature of any language I ever
learned to read, I know nothing more beautiful than the promise
that is symbolized by the rainbow."</p>

<p>The Scout Master stood still. Lean brown hands dropped among the
ribbons. A pair of deep, expressive, tender eyes lifted to the eyes
of the Bee Master.</p>

<p>"Do you reckon," said the Scout Master, "that that covenant
between God and man is a little like our covenant about the bees
and about our sekerts?"</p>

<p>The fine old eyes of the Bee Master were tender and solemn and
his voice was loving as he said to the little person: "Well, you
know a covenant is an understanding; it's an agreement, usually
only between two people, an agreement about something important and
something worth while."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the little Scout, "that's what ours was, and
I'm keeping it, and I am going to go on keeping it. And this one,
now this one is a regular flower bed with the bouquets all made up,
and this one is Roman stripes like Ben Hur had for his sash when he
drove Atair and Aldebaran and Antares and Riegel. Oh, joy! Oh, boy!
Wouldn't it be great stuff if we really had an hon est and true
amphitheater and horses like that and races like that now? These
dinky little races around here where the riders come and sell out
the race before they run it, and they draw cuts in the morning to
decide who gets to win that day, oh, bah! don't it make you sick?
The world's getting so rotten they don't even run the ponies fair
any more!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say," said the Bee Master, "that you are about
right in your statements. If we don't call a stern halt, if we
don't make a right about, if we don't come to our senses pretty
soon, we won't have very much of the ancient honour that obtained
among men left any where in this world concerning sport or
business, either one."</p>

<p>Then noticing the arresting hand and the grave face of the
little Scout, he added: "Are you holding the Scouts level these
days?"</p>

<p>There was an instant of hesitation on the part of the Scout
Master.</p>

<p>"The Nice Child is all right, but Fat Ole Bill and Angel Face
are eatin' too much raw meat. If they mutiny one at a time, I can
handle 'em. If the day comes very often when two or three of them
go bad in a heap&mdash;" the Scout Master straightened up and
lifted a face contorted by a wry grimace&mdash;"woe is me!"</p>

<p>Jamie and the Bee Master could not keep from laughing, much as
they respected the mentality of their small partner.</p>

<p>"Now, as I was telling you," continued the little person, "you
can look how beautiful they are and, too, you can <i>braid</i> 'em.
Just by getting a nurse to give you a pin and starting with two and
then workin' up and down and across like this, you can make a
coverlet big enough for your shoulders to keep the cold air out,
and you can make them run in waves, an you can make 'em go in
loops. I don't know anything you can play at easier or get more
combinations out of when you are sick and have to lie in bed than
just a bunch of beautiful ribbons. It keeps your mind on what you
are doing, but it isn't like solitaire or some of the things you
can play alone that still make you think hard enough to send you to
the mat if you wasn't already there. Now, I guess we'd better go.
The Bee Master will be tired. Mother said I wasn't to stay long
enough to make a sick man tired, and I wasn't to talk enough to
make him worse, and what else did she say? Oh, I know. I wasn't to
look like I wanted anything to eat, 'cause there wasn't anything to
eat at a hospital."</p>

<p>The Scout Master, with a lingering stroke, pushed back the gaudy
ribbons, eyed them an instant covetously, and then bent above the
Bee Master and dropped a feathery kiss on his forehead, ran a hand
over his hair, and said:</p>

<p>"You be a good boy and take your medicine and sleep when you're
told and come home quick, just as quick as you possibly can!"</p>

<p>With that the Scout Master whirled and marched brusquely from
the room.</p>

<p>Jamie waited for a few words and then followed. Once outside of
the hospital and on the street again, the Scout Master lifted an
enigmatical face.</p>

<p>"You've seen a good deal of hospitals yourself, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>Jamie assented.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Scout Master, "you seem to kind of fit a
hospital right now, but not so much as you did the first time I saw
you. The first time I saw you, you looked like you <i>were</i> a
hospital all by yourself. But now you don't look much more than
half a hospital. You seem as if you might belong to the garden just
about as well as to the hospital. I suppose they are necessary, but
oh, boy! ain't they fierce? Everything so slippery and so quiet and
so clean, and everybody on tiptoe and whisperin'. If I had a mint
of money, if I had gobs and stacks of money, I'd build a hospital
where all the windows opened on to a race track and you could see a
horse race and an automobile race twice a day, and I'd have bands
and radios and moving pictures. Gee! the hospitals they have these
days make me sick when there's nothing the matter with me!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly the Scout Master took Jamie's hand and looked up
at him.</p>

<p>"Say, what's the matter with Mrs. Cameron? What makes her cry so
much, and what's the use of her lookin' like a funeral without
anybody dead, and <i>why</i> don't Lolly come home?"</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Jamie, "you're asking me questions I
can't answer. In the first place, I didn't know that Margaret
Cameron was crying. I didn't suppose anything could happen that
would wring tears from a woman so self-contained as she is. And in
the next place, what could I know about Lolly?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Scout Master, "she <i>is</i> crying a lot these
days 'cause she's right at the end of the car line where I get off
with the Scouts to play brigand in the canyon, and robbers' cave in
the mountains, and sand fights on the beach, and to go bathing.
She's right where I see her every time I come past, and nearly
every time I see her lately she's wiping her eyes. It might be
about the Bee Master, but there ain't any use for her to spill the
brine when he might get well and he might come home. If she knew he
wouldn't ever, I could understand it. I reckon it's about Lolly
because she don't seem to come home and, of course, when she isn't
at home, Mrs. Cameron doesn't know whether she's sick or well, and
she ain't goin' to feel comfortable as long as she doesn't
know."</p>

<p>The Scout Master paused in intent thought a minute and then
continued: "I reckon that's kind of a silly thing to say. Lolly's
teaching school and, of course, when she's teaching school she
can't come home, at least not until it's time for vacation. If it
was vacation and she could come and didn't come, why, that'd be a
horse of a different colour, and there'd be some reason for getting
droopy."</p>

<p>Merely to carry on the conversation, Jamie inquired: "Is Lolly a
pretty girl?"</p>

<p>The Scout Master scuffled along the sidewalk, glancing from
right to left, dodging pedestrians, watching passing cars for their
numbers and direction, and replied en route: "Oh, joy! Maybe you'd
call her pretty. If you like taffy molasses hair and big blue eyes
and pink cheeks and a baby smile and about as much notion of
whether you're going to do it or whether you ain't as a wave coming
in, why, Lolly's a pretty girl. But if you ask me, I'd tell you
that if you want to see a pretty girl, if you want to see a right
royal, high steppin', cat's whiskers kind of a girl, just turn your
optics loose on Molly!"</p>

<p>"This sounds interesting," said Jamie. "Can you give me any
instructions as to where I'd have to be in order to 'turn my optics
loose on Molly'?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Scout Master, "not during the school season, I
couldn't. Vacations it's easy, unless the coming vacation is going
to be different from all the vacations that have gone before. All
that have gone before Molly comes home, at least part of the time,
and then we have picnics and she tramps with us and scouts with us,
and we sure do have a real time when Molly's on the job."</p>

<p>"Her home is near here?" inquired Jamie, beginning to take
interest.</p>

<p>"Well, how goofy!" exclaimed the Scout Master. "Have you lived
over a month beside Mrs. Cameron and she hasn't told you a word
about Molly and Lolly and about Don?"</p>

<p>"It just happens," said Jamie, "that when we've talked together
we've talked about bees and flowers and food. She hasn't told me so
very much about her children."</p>

<p>"Well, they aren't her children," said the Scout Master. "At
least, Molly and Donald aren't. Molly and Donald are twins and
their father and Mr. Cameron were brothers, and when both of them
went down in the boat the night of the big storm, why, Mrs. Cameron
brought the kids home to her house and she helped both of 'em to
get their schooling, so Molly could teach and so Don could work.
He's electricity. He knows a world about radio and he puts in wires
in different places. I think you call it 'installations,'
'Installations' would be the right word, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"It sounds right," said Jamie. "And who's Lolly?"</p>

<p>"Well, Lolly belonged to Margaret Cameron before she was
married. Sometime, somewhere, she must have been married to some
other man, and I dunno whether he went by the graveyard route or
got eliminated by a divorce judge. Sometimes I think I'd like to be
a divorce judge. It'd be fun to hear all the folks telling what's
their troubles and why they can't pull even and who's to blame, and
sometimes I see women that I'd just naturally separate from any
man. I see a lot of 'em that don't look like they were keeping
house or tending to their babies or could come within a mile
telling whether their kids' toenails were cut or their ears
spooned, and things like that, that my mother's always fussin'
about. And, of course, journeying along I do at times see men that
need suppression."</p>

<p>The hands went down and out. The men who needed it were
suppressed at that instant.</p>

<p>"There's some men, you know, just so trifling and just so full
of home brew, or some other kind of brew, that no woman could live
with 'em and think anything of herself. Maybe I wouldn't like it.
Maybe it would be kind of a painful job. I don't know that I'd want
it. But I'll tell you this about things I do want: I'll go to my
grave disappointed if I don't ever get to drive across this country
from ocean to ocean in an automobile! One of the kind that's got
front seats that let back and make a bed, and a little cup board
and an ice box and a pantry on the running board, and sleeping
rolls and everything. Maybe I'd have a trailer. Maybe I'd pick up
some things along the way to bring home for Mother's garden. I
don't know just what I'd do, but you mark my word, I'm goin' to
twist it around some way so I get to go before long! Of course, the
best thing about it is camping by the wayside and sleeping on the
ground and meeting different people and seeing the country when you
got time to look at it. You can't get much being whizzed through on
a railroad train, and all the places you think might be a little
bit interesting or have a bear or a deer, or there'd be an Indian
or bandit or something, those are the places you are whizzed by the
fastest."</p>

<p>"That's the truth," said Jamie. "That's quite the truth."</p>

<p>Their car came down the line and the Scout Master was on the
platform before Jamie had really convinced himself that the number
and destination were right and could follow suit. Again on the way
home, the Scout Master frankly leaned over against Jamie and waited
for his circling arm and went sound asleep until the point came
that brought the inevitable awakening.</p>

<p>On the way near the hot-dog stand at a corner toward which Jamie
felt a slight propulsion on landing from the car, he said to the
Scout Master:</p>

<p>"Do you know, youngster, you are doing what the big folks call
'burning the candle at both ends'?"</p>

<p>To his amazement, the Scout Master tuned in:</p>

<p class="poem">"'But ah, my foes! and oh, my friends!<br>
It makes a lovely light!"'</p>

<p>"That may be all right," said Jamie, "and it may be a brand of
philosophy that will do for grown folks, but that's rotten for the
kiddies. There isn't anything you are doing that's worth stunting
your growth for."</p>

<p>"Stunting my what?" said the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Jamie, "that you are exercising too hard and
sleeping too little, you are going such a pace that you are not as
big and strong as you should be. You are on such a strain mastering
those three big boys you play with that you are not getting the
strength in your own arms and legs that they have in theirs. If you
don't go a little slower and eat more properly cooked food at home
and eat less hot dogs while you are scouting, just what you
prophesied will happen to you. If you take such pride in being the
Scout Master, you'd better remember that you can't hold that office
unless you are physically fit. You'd better cut out some of the
hiking and some of the fights and a whole lot of irregular
eating."</p>

<p>"Sky Pilot!" scoffed the Scout Master. "You sound like I had the
hoof and mouth disease."</p>

<p>And thereupon Jamie was treated to a countenance of such
solemnity, to folded hands and uprolled eyes&mdash;for one instant
he caught an expression with which he had been familiar in his
boyhood&mdash;that he could not help laughing.</p>

<p>"You know," said Jamie, very soberly, "that I've been thinking
lately that being a preacher wouldn't be such a bad profession. You
might do a whole lot worse things than try to teach other men to
come clean, to shoot straight, to ride hard, to be real men
spiritually as well as physically."</p>

<p>The Scout Master shuffled ahead and beat Jamie to the hot-dog
stand. Also, the price for two was forth coming.</p>

<p>"My treat to-day! And that looks kind of rotten to let you treat
the last time when there was five of us and take it myself when
there are only two. It'll be my treat the next time and a
half."</p>

<p>Jamie stood staring.</p>

<p>"You figure your finances to the penny?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the Scout Master. "About the worst mess you can get
into in this world is the one you get into when you don't keep your
millions straight. Dad says he guesses all the trouble in the world
that is not about women is about money, and mostly if it's about
one of them, it's about the other one, too."</p>

<p>Having settled the financial end of the transaction, the Scout
Master gave undivided attention to the hot dog. The combination
struck Jamie as about what he wanted, also. It appealed to him
further that he had no business, at that critical period, to
partake of the combination that was entailed by the Scout Master's
idea of a perfect treat. He hesitated over it a second, then came
off triumphant, although slightly humiliated to fail in being a
good fellow.</p>

<p>"You know," he said to the Scout Master, "I've been very sick
and I'm not long out of the hospital and the doctor's care. I think
I won't put my stomach up against that combination of yours. I'll
just go home and take a glass of orange juice instead."</p>

<p>It touched his heart with particular appeal that the Scout
Master said instantly: "Well, I'd go and take the orange juice with
you, but I've got this started and I can't waste it, so I have to
pay for it and eat it, but the next time we'll take the orange
juice together, if orange juice is your limit until you get
well."</p>

<p>And then, trotting along the street beside Jamie, past a
mouthful of the tantalizing combination, the Scout Master said:
"Oh, gee! ain't it goofy to be sick? I don't know what I'd do if I
couldn't have a hot dog when I wanted it. Of all the things there
is to eat in the whole world, I don't know of anything I like
better. Mother likes them, too. Dad doesn't come in so strong on
them 'cause he's got a stomach himself every once and a while. City
Editor and war did it. But as yet, glory be! they haven't either of
them put the grand kibosh on me. The day they do, I'll leap from
the pinnacle (I got 'pinnacle' in geography) of the highest rock in
the bay and go out with the undertow."</p>

<p>"That would be pathetic," said Jamie. "Why do you want to cause
your friends such grief and deprive the Bee Master of his partner
and me of about the only friend I have on earth, unless the Bee
Master has decided to be my friend."</p>

<p>"Of course the Bee Master is your friend," said the little
Scout. "I knew the Bee Master was your friend the minute I faced up
to the jacqueranda and saw you sittin' on his particular bench.
Didn't you notice me keep straight on coming?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did," said Jamie. "I registered that fact in my
mentality with great pride and pleasure. I shall always remember
that when you caught your first view of me, you kept straight on
coming."</p>

<p>"It was the same way with Molly," said the Scout Master. "First
peep I ever got at her I kept right on coming. I walked right up to
her and into her just as far as I could get at the first sance. Do
you know what a 'sance' is?"</p>

<p>Jamie said he did.</p>

<p>"All right, then. A seance is so goofy that I didn't know but
I'd have to tell you about it like bees and other things you need
educating up on. But getting back to Molly&mdash;there's something
about her that's got a pull. Every one of the boys just took to her
like you take to buckwheat cakes and maple syrup or waffles that
you get from the waffle man on the beach, or anything like that
that you want all you can hold of when you think about it and want
to go back in a few days for more. Molly's like that. Something
that you want awful bad when you see her and every few days you
want her just as bad."</p>

<p>"Tell me about Molly. She sounds interesting," said Jamie.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the gate. Jamie opened it and the
Scout Master led the way to the seat under the jacqueranda.</p>

<p>"Well, telling about Molly is a pretty long story. Molly had
hard luck. She didn't have any mother to be gin with and then she
lost her father. Then there was a good while that she had the
Devil's own time with Don. He just seemed bound and determined to
do everything in the world except the thing she wanted him to. She
thought she was never goin' to make anything out of him. She
thought just dead sure he'd go some way that wouldn't get him
anywhere and I don't know whether she ever would have got him
pulled through or not, if it hadn't always been Lolly in the
background. There never was a time since I've known 'em that he
didn't think she was just old peaches and persimmons, alligator
pears, and every thing squashy like that. When he wouldn't do
anything 'cause it was honest and square and straight and 'cause it
was what he <i>should</i> do 'cause Molly wanted him to, why that
very same thing he'd do for Lolly if she'd give him a kiss or pat
him a little or laugh at him or coax him along with a petting
party. I like Molly 'cause she ain't any all-day sucker. She just
comes to the point and she knows what the point she's coming to is
before she starts for it. There ain't any meandering about
Molly!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master showed in deft hand work the straight way that
Molly went.</p>

<p>"And I reckon, if I was grown up and wanting a job to earn money
at, that I'd rather have the job Molly's got than any job in the
world."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," said Jamie. "You astonish me! I'd have
thought teaching school was the last profession in the world that
you'd choose."</p>

<p>"Yes, but in these days there's different kinds of teaching
school," said the Scout Master. "The kind that Molly does isn't the
kind you're thinking about. It isn't shut up in a room and staying
in one place and doing the same thing over and over. The kind Molly
does is called 'teaching Americanism.' Did you ever know how
good-looking and how interesting a lot of little round-the-world
children can be&mdash;a lot of little Italians and Greeks and
Spaniards and Indians and Hawaiians and Japanese and Chinese,
cutest little brown things with big round eyes? You ought to hear
'em sing 'My Country 'tis of Thee!' You ought to see 'em salute the
flag! You ought to hear 'em learn the words that mean that there
isn't any country in all the world so big and fine and nice to live
in as the United States. You ought to see 'em learn that their
heads are made to think with, and their hands are made to work
with; their feet are made to march with; their eyes are made to see
with, to see straight, to see all there is. Oh, Gee! I <i>like</i>
Molly's job! I like to help her when she is having a picnic on the
beach with em.</p>

<p>"I think that school sounds mighty fine myself," said Jamie.
"Would you take me some day when Molly's teaching Americanism on
the beach?"</p>

<p>"Sure I would!" said the Scout Master. "Molly would be
<i>glad</i> to see you. Molly's always glad to see everybody that
believes in America and believes in God. She's strong on both of
them. Anybody that shoots straight and rides hard and plays square,
like I told you. You ought to see her shoot and ride. If I was a
millionaire and had money to burn, the first thing I'd get, after I
got the kind of a horse that I'd like to have for myself, would be
the kind of a horse Molly would really <i>like</i> to have."</p>

<p>The Scout Master arose:</p>

<p>"Just about now I speed for home with barely time left to shift
to my other wardrobe, provided it ain't been bandited, and left a
dark cloud hanging over me."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do to avert trouble?" inquired Jamie.</p>

<p>"Not a thing, old dear," said the Scout Master. "Not a thing.
But I thank you, I thank you heaps for your good intentions."</p>

<p>The Scout Master cracked heels, laid a palm over the region of
the pit of the stomach, and bowed low. Then, with a whirl, the
youngster started down the walk. Only a few steps had been covered
when the small figure turned and the Scout Master called back: "I
didn't have time to-day, but remind me the next time I come and
I'll do the Lame Duck and the Wet Hen for you. I made 'em up
myself. I have to have a bathing suit and a dock to do 'em right,
but I could pretend I had on a bathing suit and the walk was a dock
and off of it was water, and show you how it goes. I'm nifty about
the Wet Hen. I think I do her spiffy."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," said Jamie. "I'll surely remember."</p>

<p>He waited before turning to the house because he liked to see
the agility, the free sweep, the unfailing grace with which the
little Scout skinned the line fence between the grounds of the Bee
Master and Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>The next morning before Jamie took up the line of march for the
beach, he called his neighbour. Since she said nothing herself he
ignored the fact that her eyes were red and her hands tremulous,
but he did wonder. He wondered exceedingly whether it was the Lolly
he had not liked so particularly well from the Scout Master's
description, or whether it was the illness of the Bee Master that
worried so fine a woman as Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>Jamie stretched himself on his bed and laid his hands on the
dressings that covered his side. Then he looked up at his
neighbour.</p>

<p>"Margaret Cameron, you are on oath," he said. "Your right hand's
in the air and you are solemnly swearing that you are going to tell
me whether or not one month of the best rgime we could devise has
taken the colour and the fever out of this wound any. I haven't had
the nerve to look myself, for I cannot face it very well except in
a mirror, which is not altogether satisfactory. Let's go!"</p>

<p>Jamie did not know as he shut his eyes, he did not know that the
skin of his face was tightly drawn across its bonework. He did not
realize that his hands were trembling as he raised them to uncover
his left breast. Margaret Cameron came to the side of the bed and
leaned over him and looked intently.</p>

<p>"Turn slightly toward me," she ordered, sharply.</p>

<p>Jamie's eyes popped open and at what he saw on her face his
heart began to leap and to bound and before he knew what he was
doing he was upright and he had both her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret!" he cried, "are you sure? Are you sure it's
<i>that</i> much better?"</p>

<p>Margaret was gripping his hands as tight as ever she could.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jamie boy," she said, "it's well nigh a miracle the way the
colour's fading out, and as sure as you are six feet high, it is
drawing together at the bottom! It is coming clean, and there is
more flesh over your ribs and across your chest! You're not so
lean! I've been thinking I could see it on your hands and in your
face, and at that we haven't been trying so much for flesh-building
as we have for blood purification. If we can get the blood stream
clean, 'most any time we can begin flesh-building. Jamie boy, I'd
say you are going to make it. I'd say, if you hold steady and keep
it up six months, you can close that ugly spot. It's going to leave
a nasty scar, but scars are the aftermath of any war. If your blood
will purify, if you can get in working order, there is nothing to
stop you from being the man God meant you to be when you were
born."</p>

<p>Then Jamie took Margaret Cameron tight in his arms and kissed
her over and over again on the top of her head. Then he released
her and looked after her wonderingly, because she was going from
the back door, her shoulders shaken with sobs deeper and longer
than the most motherly of women need shed over the joy of a step in
the right direction for even a highly considered neighbour.</p>

<p>Slowly Jamie turned from the back door. Slowly he went back to
the bed upon which he had lain. Slowly he got down on his knees and
clasped his shaking hands and laid his forehead on them, and then,
reverently, deeply, from the bottom of his heart, he thanked the
Lord.</p>

<p>Then he headed straight for the ice box and drank a pint of
tomato juice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. The Keeper of the
Bees</h2>

<p>There came a stretch of days during which the awakening of each
morning was a small miracle all by itself to Jamie. To awake
rested, refreshed, to awake with hope in his heart, to look down
the irregular stretch of the garden and on the ceaseless lapping of
the sea and to say to himself, "To-day I will transplant the
lilies. I will trim the poinsettias. I will plant some tomatoes."
To be able to tell himself that he would do something constructive
with the knowledge in his heart that he would have the strength to
do it and the uplift in his spirit that would give him joy in the
doing; because from that period on, each morning awakening was in a
way a new miracle. It seemed to him that he could feel the purity,
the cleanliness of the blood that was flowing through his veins. He
knew that the heart in his breast was calming down, was throbbing
with a regularity and a surety that he had not known in a long
time; it had ceased to flutter, even at a stiff climb. He knew that
strength was gradually forging into his limbs and his hands, that
his brain was clearing. He was no longer a pusillanimous creature
creeping around wondering about how long he could live. He was an
upright man with a hopeful outlook, with a definite purpose of
beating the game if it lay in the power of himself and Margaret
Cameron and California to win. It was a big game that he was
playing.</p>

<p>It is in the blood of humanity to fight for life. Anything but
death. Jamie sat on the side of the bed and meditated upon how
strange it was that human beings should com plain of pain, of
poverty, of disappointment, of defeat of every kind, and yet the
instant death, death that the little Scout said was beautiful,
became imminent, humanity armed against it and fought to the last
ditch, as he was fighting. He admitted that he might be mistaken,
that he might be over hopeful, that Margaret Cameron's vision might
even be coloured by her hopes for him. But one thing he could not
be mistaken about. His body was not so lean; his hands were surer;
he could walk without his legs bowing under him; and he had quit
morbid introspection. He had reached the place where several times
alone in the evening he had laid aside the bee books and picked up
the greatest of all books and read chapter after chapter, and he
realized that never once had he done this without closing the
<i>sacred</i> volume with the feeling that in some way he had
gained something; there had been possibly only one word, some
thought, something that remained with him and helped him to fashion
the coming day.</p>

<p>Then Jamie arose, picked up a pencil and drew a circle on the
calendar around the previous day, and from the circle he ran a line
to the margin and lettered it "M. C." That meant Margaret Cameron
and the date was the day on which she had found him better. Another
month he would continue the same rgime with even more exactitude
and then she would look again, and he registered a vow as he put on
his clothing that she should find him better.</p>

<p>As he arranged the dressings on his wounded side, he looked
closely at the pad he had removed, and then suddenly Jamie found
himself doing what the little person would have called pirouetting.
There was barely a faint pinkish seeping. He had felt for days past
that the stains were not so large and not so angry. That morning
there was ocular evidence that could not be done away with. Too
plain for words to dispute it, lay the proof before him that
Margaret had been right. Before Jamie realized fully what he was
doing, he found that he was dancing around the bedroom with much
less reserve and more enthusiasm than the little Scout had danced
down the garden walk. He was actually laughing to himself as he
drew on his clothing, and when he heard Margaret Cameron in the
kitchen with his breakfast, he opened the door and called to her,
"Lady of Scotland!"</p>

<p>His voice rang out with a tone Margaret Cameron had not
previously noticed.</p>

<p>"Step this way," said Jamie. "Yesterday you had Exhibit Number
One. This morning cast your optics on Exhibit Number Two!" And
Jamie picked up the pad from a basket that was being filled for the
incinerator and pulled it apart that Margaret Cameron might
see.</p>

<p>"A month ago," said Jamie, "those pads were pretty thoroughly
soaked with brilliant colour. This one I just removed is barely
damp and the faintest pink. Oh, Margaret, woman! I am going to make
it! I <i>am</i> going to be a whole man again!"</p>

<p>"Sure you are!" said Margaret Cameron, and for the sake of a
good cause she was willing to throw even more assurance into her
tones than there was in her heart. But the boy was better. Any one
could see that. There was noticeably more flesh on his bones. The
skin over his face did not look so much like parchment. There was a
faint colour creeping into his cheeks and his lips, and it might
well be that half the battle lay in having him merely believe that
he was better. At any rate, it was infinitely preferable to the
doleful attitude of considering his days as numbered and spending
most of his time deciding on the highest number.</p>

<p>That month both of them worked and held frequent consultations.
They repeatedly revised the diet lists, making the food that they
felt was right and beneficial recur most frequently, omitting
things that were not helpful and sticking religiously to the tomato
juice in the morning, the orange juice in the afternoon, and the
best milk that could be found in as large quantities as Jamie could
take it. That month was one in which they neatly walked. Sometimes
they spoke softly. For Jamie it was a month filled to the brim with
joyful thanksgiving. Every day he could positively see and feel the
progress that he made. Each day he could accomplish slightly more
in the garden. Each day he knew more about the bees.</p>

<p>That month he developed the habit every night of picking up the
Bible the last thing before he went to bed and reading a few
verses, and from thinking a prayer and from thinking thanksgiving,
he advanced to the place where he boldly, in the silence and
serenity of the little room, got down on his knees and prayed the
prayer of thanksgiving. Then he followed it by the prayer of
asking. He found himself asking God to take care of all the world,
to help everyone who needed help; to put the spirit and courage
into every heart to fare forth and to attempt the Great Adventure
on its own behalf. When it came to cases, he asked for strength to
keep the bees and the garden safely; he asked for help, physically
and morally, to be a man of whom his father and mother could justly
have been proud. Then he asked God to take care of Margaret
Cameron; to ease whatever trouble it might be that seemed to be
resting in her heart. Then, from the first time he actually had
gone on his knees, and lifted his face to the throne, Jamie had
included the little Scout. He told God about what a fine spirit he
thought the little fellow had and what a bright mentality, how
unselfish the child was and how overly developed the sense of
fairness; and he asked that the little fellow be taken care of and
guided right and given the opportunity to grow into such a citizen
as would be a benefit to the nation.</p>

<p>When he reached the Bee Master, Jamie laid hold on the foot of
the throne, and he begged the Almighty that if it were at all
consistent with the divine plan of things, to spare the Bee Master,
to let him come back to his home and the homely, simple things that
comprise the spirit of home, to let him have a few more years in
his garden with a brilliancy of colour to comfort his waking days
and the song of the sea to soothe his pillow. Last of all he
reached the Storm Girl and for her Jamie begged safety, mercy, and
the power to give her help. Then he arose, in some way fortified, a
trifle bigger, slightly prouder, more capable, more of a man than
he had been the day before. He had asked for help and he knew that
he was <i>receiving</i> help, and he knew that never again would he
be ashamed to face any man, or any body of men, and tell them that
he had asked for help and that help had been forthcoming, and that
the same experience lay in the reach of every man if he would only
take the Lord at His word; if he would only do what all men are so
earnestly urged to do&mdash;believe.</p>

<p>That was a good month for Jamie. Before the close of it the pads
covering his side were coming off dry and clean. He was using them
now more as a protection to tender, freshly formed flesh covered
with skin so thin it seemed as if a breath would rend it, than
because of any seepage. When Jamie went into the sea, he stroked
with his right arm only. When he lifted a heavy load, he protected
his left side. If a high reach was to be made, he made it with his
right hand. But never for an instant during the day or in a waking
hour in the night did there cease in his soul a little low,
murmuring song of thanksgiving. Over and over, all day, he sang it,
but there were very few words. It ran, "Life! Life! A useful life!
I thank thee, Lord, for a chance at Life, for a chance at beautiful
work, for a chance at beautiful friends. I thank thee, Lord, for
Life!"</p>

<p>Each time he went to the hospital he carried flowers from the
garden and sometimes fruits and loving messages from the little
Scout and quaint gifts ranging all the way from a battered
jackknife and a stick to whittle to a well-worn deck of cards with
which to play solitaire.</p>

<p>One day, as he went into the hospital, he met Margaret Cameron
coming out; so he knew that she had been to visit the Bee Master
and had not told him that she was going, and he knew by the
whiteness of her face and the pain in her eyes that the Bee Master
was not improving, that he was not gathering strength, that the
chances might be slowly lessening, day by day, of his ever
returning to the friendly house so beautifully encircled by a
garden of love.</p>

<p>Jamie went up to the Bee Master's room and read the truth for
himself. . The Master was scarcely able to speak. There was a white
look across the noble brow that seemed to Jamie to indicate that
the fine old soul before him was very near to being ready for
transfiguration. When he arose to go he had extreme difficulty in
keeping his voice even and his eyes clear.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," he said, "how much I thank you for the
chance you've given me to get back my manhood and to learn work
that each day I am growing to love more and more. I want to thank
you for giving me in your home the opportunity to get back to a
confidential understanding with God, to find out the peace and
sustaining power that He is willing to give to every man who can
muster the manhood to receive the gift."</p>

<p>Jamie leaned over and kissed the Bee Master on the forehead
once.</p>

<p>"That's for the little Scout who sent you a truck load of
love."</p>

<p>Then he kissed him again and added whimsically: "And that's for
Jamie. He's brought you the same amount."</p>

<p>The Bee Master held Jamie's hands very tight for a minute and
then, in barely a whisper, he said: "Thank God that you've learned
to lay hold on the promise of the Master. I am thankful that you
have learned to accept His gifts, and I believe, too, that you have
learned enough of life and enough of love in my house and in my
garden that you will be ready to accept any gift which love and
confidence may bring to you."</p>

<p>Jamie went out wondering what that meant. The next day he
learned. The call came early from the hospital. The Bee Master had
found that beautiful crossing that the little Scout had so
understandingly described. With his hands folded on his breast, in
his sleep, he had answered the call so lightly given that the nurse
found him as she had left him. His instructions had been that his
remains were to be shipped immediately to an address he gave in the
East. He wanted to be laid for his final sleep beside the two
Marys, the one he had loved and married, and the one to whom their
love had given life. All three of them were gone now, and Jamie put
it into the next prayer he uttered that that hour might find them
hand in hand wandering amid greater beauties than the little garden
had ever contained, even among the splendours of the fields of
Paradise.</p>

<p>In telling him, Doctor Grayson had asked that he come to the
hospital for a conference, and when Jamie reached the hospital an
hour later he was dumbfounded to have placed in his hands, ready
for execution, the last will and testament of the Bee Master. It
set forth that, on account of love and affection, the property
therein described was given, devised and bequeathed to the present
occupant and caretaker, James Lewis MacFarlane, and to his first
assistant, Jean Meredith. Said property was to be equally divided
between the two beneficiaries, the acre on the right hand facing
the street with the beehives contained thereon to be the property
of Jean Meredith. The acre on the left hand facing the street to be
the property of James Lewis MacFarlane with all the improvements
thereon. There followed the further provision that the two
beneficiaries were to draw cuts for the possession of the
residence, the one drawing the short cut to become the owner of the
house, which was to be removed to the property of the winner, the
expense of moving to be paid from funds in the bank belonging to
the estate which were also devised, share and share alike, to the
beneficiaries of the will. From these same funds there was to be
drawn sufficient money to duplicate the house or to build one
having the same number of rooms, general appearance, and
conveniences on the property of the loser. The remainder of the
money in the bank, after these transactions were made, was to be
equally divided between the parties benefiting by the will.</p>

<p>When this amazing document was thoroughly explained to Jamie he
sat looking rather bleakly at Doctor Grayson. He was not in the
least ashamed of the big tears that were running down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"But I can't do that," he protested. "I haven't earned that
place. There must be someone who is nearer to the Bee Master than
I."</p>

<p>"Well," said Doctor Grayson, "in case there is, don't worry.
You'll hear from them. If there are people living who feel that
they have a better right to that property than you, they will put
in an appearance. In the mean time, we will go on the supposition
that the Bee Master knew his own mind and his own business and
that, in giving you the place, he wanted it to go into the hands of
a man who would appreciate it, who would love it, who, in all
probability, would keep it as the Master left it."</p>

<p>Jamie sat staring, thinking deeply, and then he knew what the
Bee Master had meant when he had said the night before that he
should learn to accept any gift of love as well as the gifts of the
Heavenly Father. The Bee Master had known that his time was
imminent, that his crossing was near, and he had meant in a way to
prepare Jamie for the fact that the little house and the bees and
the bright garden were going to be, in part at least, a gift of
love to him. Suddenly Jamie sat up and repeated a name slowly.</p>

<p>"Jean Meredith."</p>

<p>Then he realized that he was still in the dark. He didn't know
any more than he had before. Jean might be a boy or might be a
girl. He looked at Doctor Grayson.</p>

<p>"Does Jean Meredith know about this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Bee Master gave me the telephone number and I called the
parents. Yes, the Bee Master's little friend knows."</p>

<p>"And will the parents accept that gift on behalf of the child?"
asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," said the Doctor. "Why not? There probably was
no one on earth to whom the Bee Master was attached as to the
little person he always referred to as his side partner. There is
no reason, since he had no child of his own, as to why he should
not leave his property to any one he chose. There was every reason
as to why he should leave it to a man who had cared for it in his
absence, in whom he had faith, and to a child who has perhaps
relieved the tedium of more dark hours in the Master's life than
all the rest of the world put together. It seems to me eminently
right and fitting that the Bee Master should do precisely what he
has done. I forgot to call your attention to a last provision and
an afterthought in the form of a codicil as to the furnishings of
the house. Everything in the living room and the books go to the
little Scout; the remainder of the furnishings are yours."</p>

<p>Jamie arose. He offered his hand to Doctor Grayson.</p>

<p>"I am going out in the air where I can walk and think," he said.
"But I'll tell you right now, there's no use to probate that
document. It was made by a sick man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was made by a man fighting for life after an operation,"
said the Doctor. "His mentality was as clear as yours or mine when
I said good-night to him at ten o'clock last night. There isn't a
court in the land that can touch that will."</p>

<p>"It's simply impossible," said Jamie. "I will not even consider
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will," said Doctor Grayson, "because if you don't
probate that will, I'll do it for you and you can rest very largely
assured that Mr. Meredith will see that his child's interests in it
are taken care of. You will take it whether you want it or not. If
you don't want to keep it, once it comes to your hands, if you'd
rather see someone the Bee Master would have hated go into the
little house and commercialize the garden, that's up to you, so far
as your half of it is concerned. You can make up your mind when the
time comes. Since you are so in doubt about it, I think I had
better turn the document over to Mr. Meredith, but the chances are
he will want you to co-operate with him."</p>

<p>"Well, I will not!" said Jamie, stubbornly. "I will not accept a
thing I haven't earned!"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn the Scots!" said Doctor Grayson, impatiently. "I'm
glad I'm English and willing to take all I can get, and you're the
first Scotsman I ever saw who wasn't willing to take all he could
get, no matter if it did come as a gift. And as for not taking
things you haven't earned, you'd better stop breathing, you'd
better stop soaking in sunshine, you'd better stop eating the
fruits of the earth. They are all gifts that you have accepted, and
were mighty glad to accept!"</p>

<p>"A gift from God is one thing," said Jamie. "A gift from a man I
have known such a short time is something different."</p>

<p>"There is no difference in the gifts," said the Doctor. "They
are both gifts, and I reiterate, you are a fool if you don't accept
them with a thankful heart!"</p>

<p>Jamie shook his head and, turning from the office, went down to
the street and then back to the house and to the blue garden that
the love of flowers and the love of beauty in the heart of a
sentimentalist had built around a home. He stepped softly as he
entered the door. He carried his hat in his hand and looked around
for some place not too intimately connected with the Bee Master
where he might lay it.</p>

<p>What was it that amazing document had said? One acre of valuable
soil crowded to the limit with wonderful planting, a row of white
hives running the length of it, something in the bank, plenty of
comfortable clothing that fitted him, a bed whereon to sleep, and
they were his if he cared to stretch forth his hand and take them?
Jamie suddenly discovered that he was not so strong as he had
thought he was because he was shaking until his teeth chattered and
the tears were rolling down his cheeks until he was exhausted. So
he got up and went down the back walk the extreme length of it, and
opened the gate and stepped into the footpath that led down to the
white sands of the sea. There before him his eyes encountered an
amazing sight.</p>

<p>Backed against a rock, making feeble efforts at self-defence,
were a couple of children, and before them there was a small figure
working a sand shovel with the precision of a rotary plough and the
velocity of a whirlwind. The victims against the rock were clawing
their eyes and gasping for breath and making an ineffectual effort
to return the compliment. To Jamie it was evident that the flying
sand was very nearly smothering both of them. A few long strides
brought him to the rescue. He grabbed the little Scout by the belt
and pulled hard.</p>

<p>"Gently, partner! Go gently!" he said. "You're smothering those
children!"</p>

<p>The little Scout lifted the shovel and raised a face of outrage
with the offered explanation: "They began it! They picked on me! I
wasn't doing a thing until they threw sand on me half-a-dozen
times!"</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Jamie. "No doubt, but that is not any
sufficient reason as to why you should smother them. You're going
at them like a whirlwind!"</p>

<p>The little Scout drew to full height. A deep breath filled a
heaving chest. There was no disputing the argument offered: "Again
I threw as much on each one of them as both of them could throw on
me, I had to be goin' some!"</p>

<p>Jamie took that in slowly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did," he said. "Is that shovel yours or
theirs?"</p>

<p>"It's theirs," answered the little Scout. "I took it from the
biggest one, and you will notice he is taller and huskier than I
am. So that's that."</p>

<p>"You come with me," said Jamie. "Let's go up here to the rock
and sit down and look out on the ocean. When were you home
last?"</p>

<p>"Left right after breakfast," said the little Scout. "It's
Saturday, you know. I was comin' to help you with the bees this
morning, but you wasn't there, and so I came on down to the sand
and thought I'd look around and see if I could start anything, and
right away those kids began picking on me, so I thought I'd better
show 'em a few."</p>

<p>Jamie headed toward the throne and the little Scout scuffled
along beside him.</p>

<p>"If you've not been home since breakfast," said Jamie, when they
were finally seated facing the ocean, "if you haven't been home
since breakfast, Jean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> told you my name was Jean?" cut in the little
Scout.</p>

<p>"Doctor Grayson," said Jamie. "He told me at the hospital this
morning that your name was Jean Meredith."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2200541h-images/What-else-did-he-blab.jpg"
 width="400" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"What else did he blab about me?" said the
little Scout.</p>

<p>"What else did he blab about me?" inquired the little Scout. It
was evident to Jamie that the whole of the small figure beside him
was suddenly imbued with defiance, drawn up for battle.</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything," said Jamie, "except that you would
have the sense to accept a very wonderful gift that's going to be
offered to you."</p>

<p>"Is it a horse?" asked the little Scout instantly, the defiance
beginning to fade.</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie, "it's something worth more than a great many
horses. Never mind that right now. There is something else I want
to tell you. I just came from the hospital."</p>

<p>Slowly the little person drew away from Jamie. Slowly the gray
eyes widened. Slowly the hands clenched. Slowly the narrow chest
heaved up and sank back again.</p>

<p>"Aw!" said the youngster, harshly, "aw! he ain't gone and slept
the beautiful sleep, has he?"</p>

<p>Jamie sat still and looked out across the ocean. It was a blow
he found himself powerless to deliver. Slowly his eyes turned to
the horrified face of the child beside him, and suddenly the little
Scout launched a quivering figure into his arms and buried a
twisted face on his breast and for a short time Jamie had
difficulty in holding the writhing body in his arms together. A
curious thought struck him. That rock that he had called the throne
was not very well named. It seemed to be a place where people
brought their troubles. In an earlier experience with it he had
held the body of a woman tortured to the extreme limit of
endurance. Now he was holding the body of a child so lean and
slight that he could scarcely manage his long arms to give the
support that was needed.</p>

<p>"Don't!" begged Jamie. "Don't take it like that! Let me tell
you. It was like your Aunt Beth. It was in the night without even
awakening the Bee Master. His hands were folded on his breast, too.
There was a wonderful smile on his face, exactly the smile that you
described, the smile that seemed as if there were a great secret
that those closed lips could tell if they could open."</p>

<p>Jamie fumbled for his handkerchief and turned the little Scout's
head and wiped the streaming eyes and cupped a big hand under the
quivering cheeks and held on tight.</p>

<p>"Don't cry like that," he begged. "You are tearing yourself to
pieces! The Master wouldn't like it. Don't you know that you said
all the angels would be glad when they saw your Aunt Beth coming
marching, straight and tall, with a sure step, down the flower ways
of Heaven? It's going to be like that with the Bee Master. You are
selfish when you cry like that. You are not thinking about him;
about his going home to Mary and his wee girl; you are thinking
about yourself."</p>

<p>Instantly the little figure straightened.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'm thinking about myself! Why shouldn't I think about
myself? I got myself to live with, haven't I? Who's going to be
hurt when I've got a pain or ain't strong enough to handle Ole Fat
Bill, or when I can't make any body understand <i>any</i> of the
things that he always did understand? He ain't the only one that
spilt the beans. When he told me all there was to tell about things
that went wrong with him and the people who ruined him, he didn't
do all the talking. He knew just as much about me as I did about
him, and now I ain't got a living soul to go to that'll understand!
What am I goin' to do? Just answer me that! <i>What am I goin' to
do!</i>"</p>

<p>Suddenly Jamie found himself taking the woebegone face before
him between his hands; he found himself laying it against his face,
first on one side and then on the other; he found himself hugging
the frail body until he knew he was almost cracking the bones in
it, and deep and husky he heard his own voice saying: "You come
straight to me! When you've got a secret you want kept, when any
one doesn't seem to understand and some of the bunch will not play
fair and things go wrong, you come to me!"</p>

<p>Instantly the little Scout struggled away from him. Jamie met a
level gaze of such depth and appeal as he never before had
encountered in human eyes.</p>

<p>"Honest to God?" said the little Scout. "Tear out your heart,
cut it in pieces, and cast it to the four winds of the
heavens?"</p>

<p>"Whose lodge ritual have you been reading?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Dad's," said the little Scout, calmly, "only we made ours as
much worse as we could." Then his fingers tightened again.</p>

<p>"Honest? On the level, do you really mean it?"</p>

<p>"Honest. On the level. Swear over my heart," said Jamie. "Hold
up my right hand and take the oath before the Almighty! I'll always
be your friend. I'll keep any secret you tell me. I'll do anything
in all the world that I can at any time, at any place, to help
you."</p>

<p>A steady hand was thrust at him.</p>

<p>"Shake!" said the little Scout. "All that goes for me. All what
you said about me, I'll say about you. I'll come to you like I been
goin' to the Bee Master. We'll be partners like him and me was.
I'll help you all I can. But, say, what's going to become of the
bees? What's going to become of the garden? What's going to become
of that nice house?"</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated. Someone had to tell the child. They were there.
It was his opportunity. He wanted a childsh viewpoint. Why not?</p>

<p>So he said quietly: "Would you believe there was any one in all
this world that the Bee Master loved any better than he did
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't have to waste any breath on explaining beliefs on that
point," said the little Scout. "I got acshal in formation, and I
got it from the Great Mogul; I got it from the Man Higher Up; I got
it right up against the Bee Master's heart; I got it with a tight
kiss and it's a sekert I ain't tellin' anybody except the man that
takes his place. Reckermember you're under oath and this is the
first one I'm goin' to tell you because it was our sekert between
us. There might have been folks that wouldn't have liked it if
they'd known it. There <i>was</i> folks that wouldn't have liked
it. Margaret Cameron wouldn't have liked it, for one, 'cause I've
got my doubts if she cared any more about Lolly than she did about
the Bee Master. What I know about her, the way she cleaned after
him and waited on him! I guess I seen Mother cottoning up to Dad. I
guess I know a <i>little</i> about married folks, and what I know
about her is that she'd have been tickled to pieces if the Bee
Master had said to her, 'Wilt thou?' You just bet she'd have
'wilted'! She'd have 'wilted' all over him! But he didn't ever ask
her, and he didn't ever <i>intend</i> to ask her. He never loved
any woman in all the world but Highland Mary, and he let one other
woman make a fool of him when he was so lonesome after she was
gone, like a chicken tryin' to peruse around with its head cut
off.&mdash;Say! That's a sekert, too! I seem to be spillin' all I
know on you all at once. You might get 'em in line better and hold
on to 'em tighter if I told 'em one at a time, and it'd be more
sense if I'd tell my <i>own</i>, anyway. He might not like it if I
told his. I didn't mean to, either. Just sayin' that about Margaret
Cameron made me think how I could've told her any time she was
whirling like a button on a barn door that there wasn't nothin' to
it except that he thought she was clean, and he thought she was
fine, and he'd rather play cribbage or checkers with her than to
sit and think about the awful thing that happened to the woman he
liked best and to his little Mary. No, she needn't ever thought it
was her he liked best, 'cause it wasn't. It was just 'as is' little
old me! And why I know it is like I told you before. 'Cause he said
so! And he wouldn't have to say so if he didn't want to. Nobody
asked him. Nobody pushed him off the springboard. He took the high
dive all by himself."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Jamie, "if he loved you like that and you
know he loved you like that, and if he was going on his long
journey and had something very dear to him to leave, who do you
think would be the person to whom he would leave it?"</p>

<p>So long as he lives Jamie will remember the reaction of the
little Scout to that question. The flat shoulders squared. The head
lifted to an extreme height. The chin drew in. The eyes batted. A
hand was laid on the chest at the base of the throat; the mouth
opened and the eyes closed, and the little Scout went through the
pantomime of swallowing the biggest morsel that could, by any
possibility, be forced down a small aesophagus. Then it came
straight from the shoulder, as Jamie was beginning to learn that
everything came with the little Scout.</p>

<p>"Why, he'd just naturally leave it to <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>Calmly, casually, convincingly, the words came from lips of
assurance. "He'd leave it to me, and maybe he'd leave <i>some</i>
to you, because you stuck on the job when you wasn't hardly able,
and you faced down the bees like a real man would, and you been
square about taking care of things. You can write down my answer to
that question: He'd leave some to me, and if he played the game
square, like he always did, he'd leave some to you!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "you're a good guesser, Jean! That's exactly
what the Bee Master has done. He's left a writing that Doctor
Grayson thinks will hold in the courts, and this writing says that
the west acre of the garden of wonder up there, and the hives that
are on it, are yours; and the east acre and the hives that are on
it, are mine. For yourself, you are free to do whatever you and
your parents think best. For me, it seems to be a gift that I
cannot accept."</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>The little Scout shot the phrase at Jamie forcefully.</p>

<p>"Why, I haven't done anything to earn it," said Jamie. "All I've
done here is not a drop in the bucket compared with the value of an
acre of land down that slope, planted as it is, peopled with the
bees. It's simply stepping into a home and a comfortable living and
a profession that I feel sure I have brains enough to master with a
few years of loving and painstaking work, and there are all the
books I need and all the material I need, and the name of a man who
will help me. It's too easy! It's a fairy tale! It's a dream!
Things don't happen that way in real life."</p>

<p>The little person thought that over.</p>

<p>"Look here," said a confident voice, and a small hand was laid
on Jamie's cheek and his face was turned straightly to meet the
gaze of the speaker. "Look here! Maybe you think the bandages
you're wearing don't show through the shirt on your back; but when
you stoop over, <i>they do</i>. You're pretty game about it and you
don't bellyache, but, of course, you wouldn't be all harnessed up
like that if you didn't have to be. And that means that wrong
things and things that hurt you and hit you awful hard came your
way, and it was for all of us, for 'Our country 'tis of thee.' But
you bucked up and you stood your hurts, and you didn't complain,
and you pulled through 'em. And you just know, all by yourself,
that ugly things, and mean things, and maybe things you didn't
deserve at all happened to you. Now, why ain't that just the same
as if something that was wonderful and lovely happened to you? Why
couldn't a beautiful thing happen to you just as well as a bad
thing? Why couldn't gettin' an acre of land with beehives and
flowers, happen to you just as well as gettin' a rip-snorter that
nearly tore your heart out? Laugh that off, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "come to think of it, I have heard of the
law of compensation. The law of compensation means that when things
have gone about as far as they can go in one direction, sometimes
they turn around and go equally far in the other direction."</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the small person. "That's the dope I That's the way
to look at it! Don't sit there and talk about not understanding
things and not being worth things. Course you're worth 'em, or you
wouldn't have got 'em! All your life there's been something in you,
and I expect it was born in you just like it was born in our baby.
Ever since they brought him home from the hospital you can see
there's things about him that's like Dad, and you can see things
about him that's like Mother, and I hope to goodness there'll be
one thing about him that'll be like <i>me!</i> When I went on a
boat past the cave in the rock where, if you look through, you can
see the light, Molly said, when I saw the light, if I'd wish for
the thing I wanted most in the world, it would come true. So I made
a wish and Molly wanted to know what I wished, and I wasn't goin'
to tell her. I like Molly, but everything ain't all of her
business. I like her, but she ain't the keeper of my sekerts like
the Bee Master was and like you're going to be now in his place. So
I'll tell you what I wished for my little brother when I saw the
light that makes wishing come true. I thought of it just the minute
I saw the light, 'cause even worse than I want a horse, I want the
thing I wished for my little brother. So just as quick and just as
hard as ever I could say it, right in my heart and looking straight
at the light, I said: 'I wish that our Jimmy will not ever grow up
to be a cad!'"</p>

<p>Jamie arose and took the little Scout by the hand. "Come on,
Jean," he said, "let's go home."</p>

<p>The little Scout bounded expertly from crag to crag down the
rock in front of him and waited for him at the base.</p>

<p>"You seem to like my name."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "there couldn't be a lovelier name. It's
something to know about you definitely, and at that it doesn't tell
me whether you're a boy or a girl."</p>

<p>Jamie saw the mutiny that instantly dawned in the eyes raised to
his.</p>

<p>"Still harpin' on that old no-sense thing, are you?" demanded
the little person. "Still fussin' over trifles when you are
satisfied with the big thing. If I'm your partner and you're the
keeper of my sekerts, and we're goin' home together, ain't that
enough for you?"</p>

<p>"That ought to be almost enough for any man," answered
Jamie.</p>

<p>So they started up the path toward the back gate. Halfway there
the little Scout paused and looked at Jamie speculatively.</p>

<p>"Am I to call you the Bee Master now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie. "You aren't going to call me the Bee Master,
maybe not for long years yet. The Bee Master is a title that has to
be won by painstaking work and fine thought and delicate
operations. It's a title that properly belonged to the man who's
sleeping now. He could wear it with grace and dignity. It's too big
to fit my case. We'll have to find a title for me that means
stumbling along plainly and simply, every day studying my job and
making the most of it, going at things with all my heart and
putting the best I have to give to them, just sticking on the job
because I like it, as you told me I would."</p>

<p>Registering among the mental pictures that endured, there
registered on Jamie's consciousness the upward lift of the
shoulders, the backward slant of the head, the elevation of the
chin, the outward gesture of both hands, and on his ears fell the
dictum: "Oh, well, then, if you want to be plain and simple, if you
want to get right down to brass tacks, you better just answer to
what you are&mdash;the Keeper of the Bees. That's a good enough
name for any man."</p>

<p>"I heartily agree with you," said Jamie. "That's a fine title.
That satisfies me fully and completely, better, in fact, than any
title possibly could that was of German origin."</p>

<p>"Is the 'Bee Master' of German origin?" queried the little
Scout.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "that title is of German origin."</p>

<p>"Was the Bee Master a German?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie. "Never! The Bee Master was British by breeding
and training. He happened to be located in our country, but he was
of British ancestry if he didn't go farther and be of British
birth."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't go that far," said the small person. "That's
another thing he told me himself. He was born in Pennsylvania and
he found Mary there and he was married there, and he lived there,
and the awful tilting rock was in the mountains there."</p>

<p>"The tilting rock?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>The little Scout looked down.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm kind of broke up to-day," was the conclusion
reached. "I guess I've said two or three things I'd better kept
still about. We won't talk about that rock to-day. Maybe some day
I'll tell you. It's pretty awful and I don't sleep well if I get to
thinking about it. If I get to thinking hard about it, I can't very
well quit. I want to see him before they send him away. I want to
straighten his hair and fix his tie and fold his hands myself. I
want to fix his feet comfortable and easy and I would like to put
his slippers on him, too."</p>

<p>Right there Jamie broke down. By that time they had reached the
bench under the jacqueranda. He sat down on it and buried his face
in his hands and sobbed aloud. The little person stood beside him
and put stout arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Aw," said the voice, roughened with emotion, "they didn't go
and send him right away? They didn't put him on a morning train?
They didn't not give me a chance? They didn't let somebody
<i>else</i> fix him?"</p>

<p>Jamie straightened up.</p>

<p>"Honey," he said, "I'm afraid they did."</p>

<p>"Well, I call that a dirty gyp!" sobbed the little Scout. "It
ain't giving the Bee Master any show, and it ain't giving me any
show! When he liked me the best, he would have wanted <i>me</i> to
fix him. Mother would have come with me and so would Dad. Doctor
Grayson knew all about me, and I'm goin' to tell him what I think
of that kind of business! I've called him on the 'phone maybe
half-a-dozen times and got him here and run as tight as I could
lick to get what he wanted and to heat water and to help him. He
knew darn well who the Bee Master would want to fix him up to go to
see God! It ain't fair!"</p>

<p>Then the little person collapsed and Jamie had his chance at
comforting. By and by, when both of them were calmer, they sat on
the bench side by side and dried their eyes on the same
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Did he divide things the way you'd like to have 'em?" asked the
small person, in abrupt change, as was habitual. "Did he give you
the side of the garden you'd most rather have?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm perfectly satisfied," said Jamie. "I don't see any
difference."</p>

<p>"I do," said the little Scout. "If I'd got to take my choice,
I'd 'a' said the east side."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" asked Jamie. "There are as many
hives on the west side as there are on the east. If there aren't,
we'll count them and make them exactly even. I'm perfectly willing
to move the Black Germans over and give you them as a bonus. Was it
the Black Germans you wanted?"</p>

<p>"No," said the little person, "it wasn't the Black Germans I
wanted. It was the Madonna lilies. I can beat the bees to 'em every
crack. I just love to suck the honey out of 'em! It's the real
thing, straight from the fountain, and I like the real thing! And
that panel of fence where we make the Redskins bite the dust, I'd
like to have had that mighty well."</p>

<p>"But won't a west panel do as well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon it'll <i>do</i> as well. The only difference is
that I ain't <i>used</i> to the west panel and I am used to the
east and so is Ole Fat Bill and the Nice Child and Angel Face. All
of us are used to the <i>east</i>, but I reckon we <i>could</i> use
the west just as well."</p>

<p>Then the little person looked at Jamie speculatively. "I'm kind
of disappointed in you."</p>

<p>Jamie sat straight.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I've done," he said.</p>

<p>"That's just edsactly it," said the little fellow. "Tain't
anything you done. It's something you didn't do. When you said it
didn't make any difference to you, and I showed you good and plain
that it made the difference of the Madonna lilies and our Indian
ambush to me, you might have offered to trade sides with me!
Prodibly I wouldn't a-done it. Prodibly I wouldn't a-had anything
but what the Bee Master wanted me to have. Prodibly I would a-saved
up my money and got some Madonna lilies and planted 'em on my side
for myself, but I <i>thought</i> you'd <i>offer</i> to trade."</p>

<p>Slowly Jamie digested this.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "That must have been a thoughtless
streak in me. My head is a lot older than yours and I knew that we
couldn't trade without going to court and having measurements and
making out deeds and paying officers for making the change, and I
suspect that knowledge kept me from saying that I'd trade when it
really wouldn't make any difference to me which side you had or any
particular difference if you had both of them."</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't have both of them," said the small person,
promptly. "If the Bee Master had said both of them were for me, I
wouldn't have taken but half, because it wouldn't be square, when I
asked you to stay and did all I could to get you to stay. It
wouldn't be fair to take all of it."</p>

<p>The little person looked at Jamie again inquiringly.</p>

<p>"What's goin' to become of all the money he had in the
bank?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "according to the word of the will, after
his funeral expenses and his just debts are paid, whatever remains
in the bank is subject to provisions in the will that your dad will
explain to you when he has thoroughly studied the document. I can
tell you this: that there is money provided to pay the cost of
moving the house on to the grounds of whichever one of us draws it,
and there's money to build another little house that will cost the
same as the value of this one, and whatever is left is to be
divided evenly between us."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m-m," said the small party, slowly. "You think it's likely
the Bee Master gave me some money as well as the bees and the
flowers?"</p>

<p>"I know he did," said Jamie, "if that will holds good. If there
doesn't turn out to be some blood relatives, some where, who can
prove that they are relatives and are en titled by law to have
possession. You mustn't set your heart too hard. You must go at
this with the feeling that the Bee Master intended you to have it,
but there is a large possibility that somewhere in the world there
may be a man or a woman who can take it from you, and who very
probably will when they learn about it, because, after all, blood
is thicker than water, and in this case any one related to the Bee
Master would be blood and you and I would be water."</p>

<p>"Yes, I get that," said the little person. "I follow through.
But in case the Bee Master knew his business and the judge would
say things were ours, then would there be money coming to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "I think there would be, but I doubt if it
could come to you before you are of legal age. I think probably
your father would have to handle it for you and conserve it for you
until the law says you are old enough to have it yourself."</p>

<p>"Aw!" said the little person, "aw! There it goes again!" and the
small feet kicked the pebbles of the walk until they flew yards
away. "<i>There</i> it goes again! Always havin' to wait and wait,
always havin' to be dis appointed!"</p>

<p>"What was it you especially wanted?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"What's the use to tell if I don't get it?" said the disgruntled
little person. "What would you think I'd want?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "if I was taking a random shot at it, I'd
say that you would want a horse."</p>

<p>"You said it, son!"</p>

<p>The little Scout Master leaped in the air.</p>

<p>"You said it! If I ever wanted anything, if I ever really wanted
anything in all this world, I want a horse! I want my own horse I
Queen's wonderful and Hans is wonderful, but I want my own horse! I
want to put my arms around his neck and love him personal. I want
him to know me and follow me like Dad's dog. I want him to come
when I call. I want him to learn my way. And I don't want anybody
else, not Nannette, not little brother, not anybody, to ride him
ever but just me! I want him for one thing that's mine and nobody
else's. I want to be just as selfish as ever I can be with
him!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "never having met your father and your
mother, I don't know, but it seems to me, from the tones of your
mother's voice when she talked with me over the 'phone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her telephone voice," said the small person. "I
like it myself. I stand and listen sometimes when she's talkin'
just to see how much sweetness can be put into the way she says
things."</p>

<p>"And about your father, because he is your father, I'd think, it
would be my judgment, that if this money and this land is a gift to
you from the Bee Master, I should think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you should!" interrupted the little Scout Master.
"Anybody would think that they'd let me have a horse out of it.
Couldn't we keep him here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how far the city limits extend," said Jamie, "but
we'll investigate. We'll keep that a secret between us and we'll
investigate it. We'll see what we can do. If you think it isn't
likely that they would agree to your having a horse in town, don't
say anything about it. Let's just keep it under our hats and see
what we can figure out ourselves."</p>

<p>"All right," said the little person. "I won't say a word to
them. We'll see what we can figure out. And I believe now that I'd
better go home. Maybe Doctor Grayson telephoned Dad. Maybe he's
waiting for me. Maybe Mother would like to see me. And just maybe
they haven't taken him away yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Jamie. "I'm awfully sorry, but I happen to
know that they have. You mustn't build any hopes on that. I happen
to know that he's gone."</p>

<p>The little person stood still staring hard at the zinnia bed,
struggling hard to hold steady lips and to keep dry-eyed. Then came
the habitual lightning-like change of subject.</p>

<p>"I hope," said the little Scout, "I just hope that the Bee
Master didn't have very <i>much</i> money in the bank. I hope
there's only going to be a little of it."</p>

<p>"But why?" said Jamie.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the little Scout, "I can't see the use of people
havin' so much money. It don't seem to do anything but make a lot
of trouble. I been lookin' on for a good many years, and seems to
me most of the fightin' and the fussin' and the lawsuits and things
going wrong is among the people that've got a whole lot of money.
Why can't folks be satisfied with a reasonable amount?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, glad to change the subject, "what would you
say was enough? What would you think would be about the right
amount for <i>us</i> to have?"</p>

<p>The little Scout thought that over and then announced
conclusively: "I'd say that anybody that's got the east acre or the
west acre of this place, and a long row of bee hives and lots of
fruit trees, and flowers and flowers and worlds of flowers, and the
sand and the sea, and a little house that yells 'Come on in!' clear
across the road to you, I'd say if they had enough to own that, and
get the bread and butter and the strawberry pop and the hot dogs,
I'd say they didn't need another thing on earth&mdash;clothes, of
course, I forgot about enough clothes to cover 'em up
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And didn't you forget about a horse?" said Jamie.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, now, of course, I meant a horse. I meant a horse most
before anything else except a place to keep him. You can't have a
horse without a place to keep him. That's been my trouble for
years. I could a-had a horse almost any time. There wasn't any
stable for him and not any alfalfa or oats or anybody to keep the
stable clean. That's been my trouble all along. A horse, of
course!"</p>

<p>"And a boat, of course," suggested Jamie. "The ocean isn't very
much good without a boat now, is it?"</p>

<p>The little Scout hesitated. "Oh, well, of course, with the ocean
at our back door, of course, now, we <i>could</i> use a boat. The
Bee Master told me once why he put the fence where he did, but he
said he owned clear down to the water. A man wanted to buy his
shore line and put a hot-dog stand there and he decided he couldn't
have it because we could get hot dogs down at the corner. The Bee
Master said that one of the finest men who ever lived in England,
one of the biggest credits to that fine old land was a man, and his
name was William Blackstone. He made me say over and over about the
hot-dog stand what William Blackstone said. I'll tell you now."</p>

<p>The little Scout stepped in front of Jamie, brought small heels
together, squared lean shoulders, lifted a chin, and accomplished a
nobility of countenance that was startling. Jamie did not
understand how it happened that a tear-smeared face, that
sand-filled tow hair, sanded brows and ears could take on the look
of dignity and serenity that was on the face of the youngster in
the delivery of this sentence: "'Thou shalt not obstruct thy
neighbour's ancient light!'"</p>

<p>Suddenly, with the flashing change habitual to the little Scout,
the entire figure slumped; came back to the bench, sat down beside
Jamie and leaned against him.</p>

<p>"That means," said the little Scout, "that 'ancient light' means
the sunshine and the moonshine and the clean air clear from China.
The Bee Master used to go down and lie on the sand by the hour and
let the ocean tell him things that comforted him. He said if he
sold that, the man adjoining him would be the owner, and <i>he</i>
would be the <i>neighbour</i>, and he didn't want his 'ancient
light' all mussed up with a hot-dog stand, and he didn't want his
inheritance of well-salted, dustless air right fresh off the sea
all fogged up with hot dogs. Didn't make any difference if they did
make your mouth water, we could get ours down at the corner."</p>

<p>Then the little Scout put a pair of arms tight around Jamie's
neck and closed in almost to the point of suffocation, and the
Keeper of the Bees got his second little hot kiss firm on his
lips.</p>

<p>The little Scout said: "Thank you for taking his place with me,
and I'm glad that you've got the Madonna Idles and the fighting
ground, and I'm glad you've got the east acre and half the bees.
I'll take the Black Germans, if you don't want 'em. And I'm glad,
if the Bee Master <i>had</i> to go, I'm gladder than I can tell you
that you are goin' to stay and keep the bees!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14. The Home-Made
Miracle</h2>

<p>Only a short time was required for the settlement of the estate
of the Bee Master. All he owned was the two acres of mountain-side
and beach and the money that he had deposited in the Citizen's
Bank. Because he was so thoroughly familiar with the Bee Master's
wishes, Doctor Grayson consented to act as executor. The
determination as to whom the house should belong had been decided
after the manner prescribed, and it had fallen to Jamie. It was
agreed that the house should be appraised, its value should be set
aside to accrue interest for the little Scout until such time as it
was desirable to erect another house on the west acre. It was
agreed that the home should remain where it was until Jamie desired
to move it. A fund sufficient to cover a contractor's estimate of
this expense was set aside to Jamie's credit. The little Scout was
to have the complete furnishings of the combined library and living
room on demand. The remaining money in the bank was divided
equally, Jamie's half being set aside to his credit, the little
Scout's to begin compounding interest until legal age was attained.
The proceeds from the honey and the garden were to be divided
equally after the wages of any help employed had been deducted, the
child's share to be placed in the bank. The Bee Master was reaping
the reward that the Almighty has in store for a man who has kept
the faith and from his earthly opportunities has made of him self a
scholar and a gentleman.</p>

<p>After the inheritance, it was noticeable to Jamie and the family
of the little Scout that ownership had brought problems and
responsibilities to the youngster. There was an inclination to eat
fewer hot dogs and save more dimes, and very speedily it developed
that the first improvement the little Scout planned for the west
acre was a fine large bed of Madonna lilies, and the bulbs of these
are expensive in comparison with hot dogs. It would take much
self-denial to plant a bed from which a satisfying amount of honey
could be obtained in the raw. Jamie frequently noticed the child
going carefully over the ground, apparently in search of a level
spot that would have access to the road and not disfigure the
premises, and he knew what that meant. Plans were being made for
housing the horse that was the secret desire of the youngster's
heart.</p>

<p>As for Jamie, he was frankly bewildered. It was very true that
he had been born in this country, that his education had started in
our public schools and ended in one of our best colleges. It was
true that he belonged to our country by birth and environment. But
it was also true that the blood of a man and a woman both of whom
were born and reared in Scotland was in his veins, and the habits
and characteristics of the Scot were strong upon him. All the
Scotsmen with whom he had ever come in contact had inherited what
they owned from their parents, or earned it by hard labour. Jamie
was not accustomed to gifts. He could not recall that any one ever
had given him anything in particular. Then why, all at once and out
of a clear sky, should an acre covered with fruit, carpeted with
flower brilliancy, humming with bees that were doing the work that
provided the income upon which to live, be presented to him? There
might have been a feeling in Jamie's heart that his government owed
him some thing; there was no such thought concerning the Bee
Master.</p>

<p>Jamie said frankly to Doctor Grayson, to the father of the
little Scout, to the probate judge, that he could not feel that he
had any right to a half interest in the garden of the bees. Under
pressure, he agreed to assume the responsibility of taking care of
the same tentatively, but he said firmly that if any relative of
the Master's nearer kin turned up and claimed the land, he should
abdicate immediately. For this he was rated roundly by three very
intelligent business men. Doctor Grayson pointed out that the Bee
Master knew what relatives he had and where they were, and if he
had desired that they should possess his property, he would have
left it to them. It was the Doctor's opinion that what the Bee
Master desired was that a man of fine perceptions, of trained mind,
of high capabilities and appreciation, a man who cared for colour,
for music, for the small graces and beauties that go to make up the
refined excellencies of life, should reside in the blue garden.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith said that he was only slightly acquainted with the
Bee Master, but it was his opinion that he was a highly cultured
gentleman, that he knew his own mind, that his brain was extremely
clear, and what he had seen fit to do with his own property was
good enough for him. The probate judge said business was business.
The records to the property were clear; the beneficiaries were
before him; there was nothing on his part to be done but to follow
the customary processes of the law. Whether Jamie wanted it or not,
the east acre of the garden was his. That and the house belonged to
James Lewis MacFarlane. It was up to him to assume the
responsibility of ownership, to pay his share of inheritance tax,
and to be ready for the property taxes that would be assessed ac
cording to the regular processes of the law.</p>

<p>So Jamie went back to the garden, his mind in the turmoil of
bewilderment. There was much sprinkling to do and he could think
while he sprinkled. He could wonder why things happened as they did
as he trimmed shrubs and used a hoe. When it came to caring for the
bees, they received his undivided interest. But when he had
accomplished all the work that he had been doing daily in the
garden, giving perhaps a little extra attention to the west side
merely because he was Jamie, then he applied himself to the rgime
of diet and exercise that he and Margaret Cameron had evolved. In
the long evenings, by the hour he pored over the bee books, and
then went out in the daytime and tried to apply what he had learned
to his personal experience.</p>

<p>He was not responsible for his mind in those days. It flew off
at queer tangents, and he found himself developing a habit, when he
had any time of leisure, of taking a book and from beneath the
shade of a certain orange tree at the foot of the garden,
alternately reading and keeping an eye on the shore line. He had a
feeling that some day, sooner or later, a tall girl with the free
stride of a boy was going to pass along the beach and climb the
back entrance to the throne, and when that happened, Jamie wanted
to be there to see. The letter in his pocket was exactly the same
letter it had been from the first time he had read it, and he had
read it times uncounted since and pored over every stroke of each
letter. He could reconcile the letter with the girl that he had
held in his arms, with the woman who had stood shoulder to shoulder
with him and taken the marriage vows. But he could not reconcile
either of these people with a girl who had complicated her personal
affairs to the extent of being in dire need of the outward signs
and symbols of chastity.</p>

<p>The longer he mulled over the situation, the more his mind
became at least open to the conviction that the girl of the
canyons, and the mountains, and the desert, the girl to whom there
persistently clung the odours of sage, whose step was alert, who
had the far distance look in the eye of the outdoor person, would
not have been subjected to the allurements and temptations of the
girl who lives her life at the high pressure of cities. Jamie could
see how any girl who was daily dreaming of herself, of fine
clothing, daily frequenting over-sexed and vulgarly sexed picture
shows, nightly attending dance halls indiscriminately peopled with
whoever chose to appear, from what ever condition of life they
happened to come, could get into serious trouble. He could see how
the mad dash in automobiles from one place of amusement to another,
how irregular eating of highly seasoned foods, how the loss of
sleep, the constant contact with men who had not been rigorously
trained in the habits and customs and ideals of a generation or two
back, might have resulted in disaster to girls too young to realize
how they were abusing their bodies or imperilling their souls. The
more he thought of it, the greater grew his wonder that any girl in
such circumstances escaped with her virtue or with sufficient
health to finish even a reasonable lifetime. And what benefit a
girl bereft of virtue and health was going to be to a home or to a
nation, he had not much idea. The only thing he knew definitely was
that such girls were the kind that he wanted to keep a mile away
from.</p>

<p>Standing before the glass one morning intently studying his left
breast, holding in his hand a pad he meant to apply and strap in
place after his inspection, Jamie for the first time was paralyzed
with a thought that had not before obtruded itself. Exactly why he
had not thought of that very thing, he did not know. After he did
think of it, it seemed to him that it was the one thing he should
have thought of first. And he had not.</p>

<p>Any Scot gentleman, truly, in the depths of his heart, places
his God and his country and his honour and those he loves above
everything else, but always deeply in grained in the heart of every
Scotsman is the love of money; the place that can be bought with
money; the power that can be purchased with money; the comfort that
it will give; the luxury that it will provide for loved ones; the
assurance that the cold and hunger and misery of the world will be
averted. The very first instalment of money that the Bee Master had
put in Jamie's fingers had stirred him to the depths of his soul.
He had held it between his fingers. He had stared at it
incredulously. The fact was that never in his life had he had money
that belonged to him to spend as he pleased. All the money he ever
had had in his possession, was what his father and mother had given
him to buy his clothing and to pay for his education, and it had
tried them sorely to get together sufficient means to do the things
most desired for him without providing any luxuries. He never had
known what it was to have money in his pockets to spend as he
chose, and the result was that his first earnings as the Keeper of
the Bees spurred him to the fight that it now seemed possible might
end in victory.</p>

<p>It was several days yet until the time for Margaret Cameron to
make her second inspection. The pad Jamie had removed that morning
looked as fresh and clean as when it had been applied. The morning
tomato juice, the afternoon orange juice, the soaking in the sea,
the baking on the sands, the clean, dustless, salt-laden air,
absorbing occupation, all day out-of-doors, a mind with something
to dwell on that was holy, that was beautiful&mdash;what doctor
need hope to compete with such a combination, such an exhibition of
Nature's powers for healing? Perhaps it was the clean pad he had
removed, the evidence that there was a skin coating over his
breast, firm enough to hold through the work of the day, the
feeling of coolness and satisfaction in the pit of his stomach, the
absence of heat and burning in his blood, probably it was a
combination of all these things that had made Jamie, standing
facing the glass that morning, voice the joyful conviction: "I'm
going to make it! As sure as there is a good God in the Heavens,
I'm going to be a well man again!"</p>

<p>Right there was where Jamie received his blow, an awful blow, a
blow from which he shrank and which whitened his face and set his
hands to shaking. His voice sounded strained in his own ears
because he said it aloud:</p>

<p><i>"And by all that's holy, I contracted to die! It was part of
my agreement to be through with life in six months at the most! I
said there wasn't a chance that I'd live, and probably the girl who
married me would not have done it if she had not thought that I was
practically a dead man."</i>
</p>

<p>Jamie stood still holding the pad and staring at it. He could
feel the girl's exploring fingers across his chest. He could feel
the shudder, perhaps of pity, that had gone through her as he
guided her fingers across the outline of the bandages and braces
that he was then wearing. He had given her evidence to prove his
words. She had accepted the evidence, she had trusted his word, and
now he had turned around and he was doing everything in his power,
making his utmost effort, to live.</p>

<p>Soberly Jamie laid on the pad and fastened the bandage that held
it in place. Soberly he donned his clothing and went out to his
work. Every few minutes he stopped and stood staring before him.
Fifty times that morning he said to himself: "There isn't a ghost
of a chance of my dying in six months or six years, or ten times
six years, if I keep on improving as I am now. The only way I could
die would be to wreck myself, and if the day ever comes when I meet
Alice Louise face to face and her circumstances seem to be
accompanied by mitigation, what will she think of me for being
alive?"</p>

<p>Then Jamie's sense of humour came to the surface.</p>

<p>"If matters turned out in such away that I had a chance to live,
I suppose she wouldn't ask me to kill myself if the wound didn't
kill me; and if she did, I scarcely believe I'd follow even the
dictates of a lady quite that far. I'll tell her I was honest, that
that storm night was as black for me as it was for her, that the
struggle that raged in my heart was the same thing as the storm in
hers or the storm on the sea. I'll tell her that it is my good
fortune that the sun has broken through and that there's life in
store for me. I'll tell her that I called on God and He came to the
rescue and made it life and work and a chance for happiness. I'll
tell her that if she will call on God, it will be in His power to
straighten out her problems as mine are straightening. I'll tell
her that it is not my fault that I'm alive. No, I can't very well
tell her that, either. It is at least halfway my fault that I'm
alive. God gave me the opening. It is to my credit that I took it.
I sup pose I could have gone on eating the wrong food combination
and carrying a black load on my shoulders; I could have gone on
eaten up with self-pity and reeking with poison. I'll take enough
of it to myself to stand responsible for the resolution and the
ability to do the things necessary when the way was opened. Dad
used to say in the pulpit that the days of miracles were over; that
to-day God gave us our chance, and if we wanted miracles we had to
perform them ourselves." It took the greater part of a day to get
this problem straightened out, but it ended in Jamie reaching the
conclusion that he was honest in what he had said, honest in what
he had done, but different circumstances had altered the case.</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron would be overjoyed the next time she examined
his chest. He found himself so elated, so full of hope that day
that he was very careful to protect his left arm and his left side.
It seemed to Jamie that if anything happened to break that frail
coating of skin across his chest and set the bright stains to
reappearing on the pad he wore, he could not endure it. He knew if
it happened that it would break his mental reserves until he would
sit down and cry like the veriest baby. At any cost he had to keep
that delicate, tender coating intact.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his work Jamie had very seldom left the
premises. He had scarcely ever gone to town, never unless it were
imperatively necessary. Now the necessity seemed to be imperative
that he go frequently. There was always something occurring about
the settlement of the Bee Master's affairs, or a reason why he
should go to see Doctor Grayson or the probate judge or the banker
who was holding the funds of the Bee Master's estate. Added to this
he was falling into the habit of paying an occasional visit to the
man with whom the Bee Master had exchanged work. He found John
Carey an interesting man, an entertaining man, a man of whom it
would be worth while to make a friend. Sometimes he would not
exactly understand the instructions of the bee books. Carey could
make everything plain and do it so quickly and so effectively that
he was worth knowing from a business standpoint alone. So more and
more frequently the Keeper of the Bees hurried through with his
work and went to spend a few hours in the apiary of another
man.</p>

<p>Soon he began to realize that, from her work about the house and
in her own garden, Margaret Cameron was watching him. He was
brought to the realization by the fact that every time he came home
from one of these absences, he found a house in order, dustless
furniture, fresh bed linen, a spotless kitchen, a bowl of flowers
on the living-room table.</p>

<p>One day he came home to find a shining house. That morning
Margaret Cameron had examined his breast for the second time and
had told Jamie what he already knew, that however faint it was,
however frail it was and delicate, however liable to crack on
slight strain, nothing altered the fact that there was a tissue
coating of skin entirely covering the wound on his breast. Margaret
Cameron was old enough to be his mother. She had thrown her arms
around his neck and kissed him and they had per formed a crude
dance of exuberant joy in the small bed room. Margaret had arranged
her yellow roses in the bowl. She had drawn forward the Bee
Master's chair and set before it the slippers that Jamie had been
wearing. It was her way of inviting him to take his place as the
master of the house. She had set a table with the daily paper on it
beside the chair, and every other vase and pitcher in the house
that ever had held flowers was flower-decked.</p>

<p>Jamie smiled with pleasure as he glanced around the living room.
He thought how few men there were in the world who could take
insensate objects and make a room so livable as the Bee Master had
made the room upon which he had indelibly stamped his tastes, his
mentality, his artistic tendencies. Then Jamie swung open the door
and stood as still, as still as the last pause before the breaking
of a great storm. The sleeping room was dusted; there was fresh
linen; it was shining; it was reeking with the odour of sage, an
odour that never in any faintest degree had attached to Margaret
Cameron, and on the night stand beside the bed where the light
stood and the thermos bottle for water, was the copper bowl, and
the copper bowl was overflowing with sand verbena. The exquisite
flowers, with the refreshment of water, with the evening hour, as
was their habit, were rolling up and spilling abroad their faint,
delicate incense, the most beautiful flower perfume, Jamie thought,
in all a world of flowers. He walked over and picked up the bowl.
He looked under it. He looked on the table carefully. He looked
over the floor. He lifted the pillow. He searched the four corners
of the room. There might have been a note, and a breath of wind
might have blown it away. Then he headed straight for Margaret
Cameron.</p>

<p>He found her in the garden. He took the pruning shears from her
fingers and led her to a rustic seat under the sheltering boughs of
an acacia that a few months before had been a stream of flowing
gold, liquid gold that spilled and poured and dripped. Then he sat
down beside her and captured both her hands and turned her face
toward him.</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "you know how much I thank you for all the
thoughtful things and the motherly things and the kind, heartening
things that you do for me. You probably understand the cleanliness,
the immaculate, scrupulous state of scouredness, of my boyhood
home. You know how I appreciate and luxuriate and grow stronger and
feel better with the kind of housekeeping that my mother would do
for me had she not been forced to make her crossing before my
return. I think my house is the most wonderful house in all the
world to-day. I wouldn't trade it for any house of any millionaire
anywhere in the state of California. The little Scout is right in
thinking that it's possible to be satisfied with what you have;
that if you have a house and a flower garden and the assurance of
daily bread, it is enough. Life is wonderful to-day, Margaret, very
wonderful. I've had an interesting time with Carey and his bees.
I've made up my mind that if the Bee Master wanted me to have the
house and garden, I want them as badly as he could possibly want me
to have them. There never was any question of my <i>wanting</i>
them. I merely had the feeling that I might be usurping the rights
of some other man. If it happened to be a woman whose rights I was
usurping, then, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you'd be puddin'-headed enough to get up and get out
and leave what rightfully belongs to you!" said Margaret
Cameron.</p>

<p>"If she could convince me that she really had a right to the
place, naturally, however much I loved it, I'd clear out," said
Jamie. "But clearing out isn't what I came over here to talk about.
Margaret, you've made my living room wonderful with a world of
flowers. Now, tell me truly, did you put the flowers in my
bedroom?"</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron turned toward him a face of frank
astonishment.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I didn't. I never want a bedroom cluttered up
with flowers. I don't like to sleep with stronger flower perfume
than comes through the windows. I don't think it's healthy to lie
all night in a surcharged atmosphere. I didn't put any flowers in
your bedroom."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Jamie, "if you didn't put them there,
you are the only one who has keys and access to the room. You can
tell me who did."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I cannot," said Margaret Cameron, "because
I haven't the least notion."</p>

<p>"Has the little Scout been here?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Margaret Cameron. "Of course, I don't
pretend to keep tally on the comings and goings of that youngster,
and I wouldn't take oath that a window wouldn't form a more
suitable mode of entrance than a door. You know, there's a gate
between us, and you know that you never saw the little Scout do
anything but jump the fence."</p>

<p>Jamie grinned.</p>

<p>"I know. That's part of a code of exercise. By this time I know
the little Scout fairly well. In the first place, the youngster is
not addicted to gathering flowers. In the second place, these
flowers have been very carefully clipped with scissors or a knife,
and in the third place, they are arranged with a grace and a beauty
to which the little fellow has not as yet attained. Some of the
stems are long and some of the stems are short, and some of the
heads are upstanding and some, having a few leaves, spill over the
edge of the bowl and creep out on the stand cover, and altogether
they are sufficiently artistic to please the senses of the most
discriminating artist of Japan. If the little Scout had gathered
them, they would have been wadded into a tight bunch and chucked
into the bowl in the most effective way to get them there. Don't
you believe it?"</p>

<p>"I think very likely," answered Margaret Cameron.</p>

<p>Jamie smiled his most ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "you <i>would</i> tell me if you knew,
wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think I would," answered Margaret, catching his mood and
smiling back at him. "I can imagine no reason as to why I
shouldn't. I think I'd tell you if I knew; but honestly and truly,
Jamie, I haven't the faintest notion who would compose the very
artistic combination you've been describing so enthusiastically.
Have you made friends with any of the neighbours?"</p>

<p>"You know I haven't!" said Jamie. "There aren't any neighbours
on the west. Neighbours are something to acquire in the future, and
you are my neighbour on the east, and beyond you I haven't
penetrated. Straight down, of course, there are hundreds of people
daily on the beach, but aside from more blue, this garden probably
looks like every other garden running down to the sea. It's had no
visitors so far as I know. The truth is, Margaret, that there's
something about the house to-day that puzzles me. The bouquet in my
bedroom was one thing. The Bee Master's chair pulled to the
hearth-side with the slippers I've been wearing before
it&mdash;While we are on the subject, did you do that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Margaret Cameron, "I didn't. I've felt that the Bee
Master's chair was something sacred and devoted to him and I've
respected the fineness of your nature that kept you from
appropriating it. I've got to bring myself to the place where I
don't mind seeing some other man using it. Frankly, I'd rather see
you use it than any other man I know, but I couldn't see you
sitting in it just at this minute without resenting it."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd have that feeling," said Jamie. "I had, and a
desire to be more worthy, to attain more years and more knowledge,
to make of myself the level best it was in me to become; not until
I have climbed to near my limit dare I aspire to occupy that chair.
You told me that you had a daughter away teaching school and that
you had a niece who came to see you frequently, and I wondered if
either of them might have been with you and might have arranged
things differently from the way you would."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron shook her head.</p>

<p>"Lolly went far up state with the school she accepted, clear to
Sacramento. She can't afford to come back and forth until the
term's out. I don't mind admitting that the house is like a grave
without her and I've had some tears to shed because in one or two
of her recent letters she has insinuated that she might not come
home for her summer vacation, that she might go with a camp of
girls up into the Yosemite. To tell the truth, I felt sort of
peeved at Molly. Right down in my heart, I know that she was
instrumental in getting my girl the school away from home, and I
can't see why she did it. The plea that she would get more salary
doesn't take into consideration the fact that she'd have to spend
such a big share of her salary for food and a room, when, if she
taught in the city, she could use the car line and be at home over
nights and over Saturdays and Sundays. I haven't dared say anything
to Molly because, a few months ago&mdash;it was at the time I was
away when you first came&mdash;I went to the city to her. She had
had an awful shock. She hadn't but one near relative on earth, her
twin brother Donald, and from the time their father and my husband
were drowned at sea at the same time, I've had them in my home
until they were far enough along with their education to get work
and go out for themselves. They'd all been friends. Don and Lolly
had been better friends than I'd wanted them to be. Don didn't have
Molly's back bone; he didn't have her view of life. I thought he
was kind of shiftless and weak, and for a few years we all had a
fight to keep him from getting into a lot of things that he
shouldn't have gotten into. It was always Lolly that could hold him
and manage him, if anybody could. I was kind of glad of it, when he
got work and went away, but having Molly at her school work in the
city left this house so emptied out and lonesome that my girl just
picked up and went, too, and in my heart I knew that Molly planned
it, and I didn't like it.</p>

<p>"Then, like a clap out of a clear sky, Molly called for me to
come quick, that she was in trouble, and when I got to her I found
her worse broken up than I'd ever thought she could be. Word had
come that Don was dead. They had got him work, a fine place, in the
big power plant at San Joaquin, and he seemed to like it and was
doing fine. I don't know enough about electricity to know how the
thing that happened could happen, but he did something wrong, and
as quick as electricity can do it, he was gone. We sent for Lolly
but she didn't come. She sent word she felt so bad she was sick in
bed and she couldn't, and I could see how she would feel bad enough
to make her sick in bed. You know, Lolly's my girl. I had her by my
first marriage. She wasn't really related to the children. Mr.
Cameron was her stepfather and she might have thought a lot more of
Donald than I knew she did. Any way, Molly and I had to lay him
away alone. Molly felt so bad I almost forgave her. Besides, I
didn't actually know that she had planned to get Lolly away from
home. I just felt she had. The whole thing has upset me a good deal
of late and Molly hasn't been here as often as she used to come. I
don't know why, because the truth is, I thought a lot of the boy
myself and I could have been honest and sincere in mourning him
with her.</p>

<p>"Now come these letters from Lolly hinting about going farther
north in the state for a summer vacation and only being home a few
days at the very last, and going away again to teach the coming
year. The whole thing is just the way it shouldn't be. I wonder
sometimes if I've been too clean and too particular about where the
girls went and what they did. The way things seem to be going among
the youngsters these days, it doesn't look as if a mother
<i>could</i> be too particular, but if she is so particular that
she drives her young folks away from home, I don't know that that
gets her anything except a good big heartache. No, there wasn't
either of my girls with me. If there's a feminine touch in your
house to-day that you don't understand, I'm telling you truly I
don't know who the female is or where she came from."</p>

<p>Jamie thought deeply.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, at last, "if you don't know, why you
don't, and that's all there is to it. I'll have to do my own
Sherlocking."</p>

<p>He said it jestingly, but the idea persisted. He went home and
down the back walk. He lifted the latch of the beach gate with
exploring fingers. He followed the hard clay and gravel path down
to where it met the sands of the sea, and he stood and looked very
intently, very carefully over the sand. By and by, he thought he
began to distinguish the impress of a foot and a few yards farther
he found what he was looking for&mdash;an imprint that he had seen
before, the same shape shoe, the same width, the same broad
common-sense heel. Then he knew without any doubt whatever that the
Storm Girl had been in his home.</p>

<p>He went farther along the beach toward the south fol lowing the
footprints, and finally he found the sand mound on which the
verbenas had grown. He found the severed stems from which his
flowers had been cut. Then a thought struck Jamie and he whirled
and almost ran in the direction of the throne. With palpitant heart
he climbed the ascent leading to the crest, clambered over the
rocks, and came about facing the place where he and the Storm Girl
had endured the storm together.</p>

<p>That evening the sun was dropping into the Pacific in a circle
of red glory. The clouds above were almost blood red in its light;
the water, a deep indigo blue out on the way to China, an exquisite
light emerald near the shore, and wavering over the surface and
coming in slowly with the light waves were exquisitely shifting
colours of lavender and old rose. The foam of the beach and the
very sands were delicately coloured with it. Somewhere very close a
mocking bird was singing and white gulls were passing in homeward
flight, and a few little sandpipers were quarrelling down on the
shore line. There was a whole world of things for Jamie to see and
to love and to thank God for, but what he did see was the fact that
the Storm Woman had sat in her place and arranged the flowers that
she had brought him. Tiny withered leaves of sand verbena lay on
the rocks at his feet, discarded blooms that were too old had been
dropped there. Jamie took one step farther and looked, and in his
place there lay on the rocks three exquisite heads of bloom, a long
trailing stem and a medium and a shorter stem twined together
deftly, braided past the leaves and laid in the place upon which he
had sat as one would lay an exquisite tribute on the grave of the
dead. That very thought came to Jamie.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he said, "I wonder what she'd think if she knew I
am about ten times the man that I was the day I married her! I
wonder if she'd think I haven't played fair if she knew that I was
working with all my might to be a whole man. And I wonder what
she'd think if she knew that I'm not keeping my promise not to try
to find her. I wonder what she'd think if she knew I broke it when
I went to Margaret Cameron to see if she could tell me anything,
and I broke it again when I went along the beach trailing a
footstep that I know. I wonder what she'd think if she knew that
right down in the depths of my heart I just about adore her. I
wonder what she'd think if she knew that there haven't been very
many minutes since the night that I held her in my arms that I
haven't held her in memory and haven't wanted her and haven't ached
for her and haven't worked for her and haven't thought about her
until I've got to the place where I don't much care as to why she
needed my name. And I wonder what she'd think if she knew how often
I've read her letter and how I've appreciated it, and I wonder what
she thinks when she gathers sand verbena and puts it into my
fingers and carries it within a few feet of my pillow. By Jove! I
wonder if I married her with sufficient assurance to stamp a little
bit of my individuality on her! I wonder if she feels that I really
am at least half a man. I wonder if days of trouble are coming near
and if she needs a man who could take care of her and comfort her
and do what he could to fortify her. I wonder if those flowers
beside my pillow are her way of asking me to break my word, to
search for her, to find her, to help her? I wonder if they are her
way of saying that she needs more from me than my name?"</p>

<p>Jamie sat until dusk, then slowly arose and made his way home to
his supper. As he crossed the back porch a thought occurred to him.
He went down the walk and around to his bedroom window, and as he
examined closely a head of sand verbena lying on the ground came to
his notice. Margaret Cameron had told true. She did not know who
the Storm Girl was. She had not furnished a key to give entrance to
his house. The Storm Woman had done what she was so perfectly
capable of doing. In the seclusion of the shrubs, screened from the
streets and the neighbouring houses, she had slipped up the back
walk and stepped into his window. So that was that, and it did not
help Jamie any on his way toward dying. As a matter of fact, it
gave him more food for thought and more reasons for living than
ever before had possessed him.</p>

<p>After that Jamie lived in hourly expectation. Some day surely
she would come again. Some day he would be in the garden when she
came through, or he would find her on the throne. He was almost
tempted to write a note and leave it there, but the knowledge that
many people climbed the uncertain path leading to the top of the
jagged rock deterred him. He could not take the risk of any one
else finding the message that he intended for the Storm Girl. He
could not help in his heart thinking of her as he had seen her,
strained and unhappy in the glare of the lightning, or with
quivering lips and staring eyes as she had left him. He could not
help trying to picture how her face would appear if it were afire
and alight with happiness; how her eyes might shine if she were
pleased and interested; what a wonderful companion she would be
breasting the waves or climbing a mountain, or working in a garden,
or sitting opposite a hearthstone. Whatever he might have thought
of her in the nebulous character of a woman he had seen, a woman
whose race and blood were manifest in her face and bearing and the
tones of her voice, a woman to whom his blood had a right to cry
out because they were of common nationality, each only one
generation removed, the fact remained that she never could be
nebulous to him. She was stamped on his memory, in his
consciousness in a different way from any other woman.</p>

<p>"Because before the Lord and by the law, she is my wife," said
Jamie, "and I cannot get away from that fact, and she cannot get
away from it. She cannot marry any other man without making herself
known and divorcing me."</p>

<p>Then Jamie got another blow that knocked him speech less and
almost senseless for a moment.</p>

<p>"What's more," he said to himself and to all and sundry when he
gained sufficient breath with which to speak, "what's more, James
Lewis MacFarlane, you can't marry any woman, you can't have a real
home, you can't have a hearthstone so long as you are legally
married to a girl who wants only your name, or to one who doesn't
want you in person at all!"</p>

<p>Jamie sat down suddenly and admitted that he was possessed of a
single-track mind. He had been on the track that led to death and
elimination when he had done this fool marrying stunt. Now he was
on the track that led to a home, to work in the world, to the
things that all men desire when they are sane and healthful, and he
was bound as tight as the law could bind him by records in the
office of the Marriage License Bureau of the county in which he
lived. That was something more to think about. So Jamie went about
being the Keeper of the Bees, the master of the house, the partner
of the little Scout with several problems very persistently in the
forefront of his mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. Reaping the
Whirlwind</h2>

<p>The days began to slip by rapidly. As Jamie be came more
familiar with the work he was sup posed to do he found that
constantly he could see things of his own volition that no one had
told him about, yet they were things that increased the activity of
the bees, things that added to the beauty of the garden, things
that resulted in producing a larger amount of different kinds of
vegetables. He found, too, that a number of fruit and vegetable
stands not far from his location were willing to pay him
worth-while prices for anything he had in those lines that he and
Margaret Cameron could not use. Then he began filling baskets for
the little Scout to carry home that there might be no question of
unequal division.</p>

<p>There had been ten days when he had scarcely seen the little
Scout, and then there came a joyous day when the child came
whooping into the garden followed by Ole Fat Bill and the Nice
Child and Angel Face. They had made merry, and Jamie's ears rang
and his sides ached with laughter. They were celebrating the close
of school. They were planning for a long summer that was to com
prise more mischief than probably ever before had been crowded into
the same length of time.</p>

<p>Jamie found himself mighty thankful to have the little Scout
around the garden. It was not only that he received much efficient
help with the bees, with the pruning and watering; it was that he
had fallen deeply in love with the youngster. As he became more
firmly fixed in his regard for the child, he worried, grew obsessed
with the feeling that things were not as they should be; that of
the Scouts it was the Master who was not attaining the height and
developing the physical strength that the exercise all of them took
should have resulted in producing. Several times Jamie had
seriously considered calling the Scout Master's mother and asking
her if she did not think Jean was exercising too strenuously,
taxing brain power to the breaking point, making of each day a
round of never-ending activity. From a word dropped here and there,
Jamie realized that the child was not sleeping any too well of
nights. Sometimes the little Scout slipped into the living room and
stretched on a davenport, or into Jamie's room and, across the foot
of the bed, slept for hours as the dead are supposed to sleep.</p>

<p>As Jamie's own strength grew, as the tissue coating of skin
across his breast strengthened in thickness and faded in colour, as
the continued careful diet, the salt baths, the sun treatment, and
the tomato and orange juice worked their will, so Jamie's mind
cleared in proportion as his body strengthened. A feeling of power,
of executive ability, began to develop in him. He ceased almost
entirely to think of himself. All the thought he had he needed to
concentrate on his work, on the little Scout, on Margaret Cameron,
and he found that there was no hour of the day in which his mind
was not battling back and forth, pro and con, concerning the girl
he had married.</p>

<p>He wondered if he should start a systematic search for her; if
he found her, whether she would be pleased or turn from him in
anger. He wondered if there might not be assistance he could render
her. He wondered if there might not be mitigating circumstances.
Jamie could not force himself to think of the Storm Girl as a girl
who had broken the laws, the laws of God and the laws of man.</p>

<p>In those days he had an ever-present worry concerning Margaret
Cameron. He had learned to respect his neighbour highly. He had
learned to appreciate deeply the many kind and thoughtful things
she did for his comfort. He felt that if the whole world were
filled with mothers who were willing to remain at home, to shoulder
the duties of caring for a home, to stick to sound common sense and
reasonable judgments as Margaret Cameron had done, there would be
more boys and girls willing to remain at home, willing to find
entertainment there instead of on the beaches and in the canyons
and in cheap public dance halls. Then he reflected that Margaret
Cameron's trouble at that present minute, as nearly as he could
figure it, was because her only child had left home and was
deliberately remaining away from home. Margaret had told him only
that morning that Lolly had definitely decided to go with a party
of young people who planned to hike through Yosemite and Muir
Woods. She had written that she would try if possible to get back
for a few days before school began in the fall, so a long, lonely
summer was stretching before Margaret, and she frankly admitted to
Jamie that there was an unrest, an apprehension hanging over her
that it was quite impossible for her to dispel.</p>

<p>So when Jamie thought of Margaret, he thought sympathetically,
wonderingly, and much of the time with a fair amount of
indignation. He could but feel that some thing was due to parents
who kept the home fires burning, who weathered the years, who had
doctored their children and worked over them and prayed over them,
who had used the utmost of their strength and bestowed the deepest
of their love, who had unselfishly given and given all they had to
give, and still had earned, seemingly, nothing whatever, not even
gratitude. Jamie could not believe that the attention Margaret was
paying to him was touched with the depth of devotion and tinged
with the quality of consideration and love that she had given to
any of the three youngsters she had loved and devoted her self to
until they reached the point where they were able to fend for
themselves. Now it was vacation. It was the time that other
children were coming home, and neither of Margaret Cameron's were
coming, not the girl to whom she had given birth, nor the girl to
whom she had given shelter. Why did not both of them come for a few
weeks? Why did they not plan and come one at a time so that
Margaret might have her vacation when other people were having
theirs? Why did they not make some plans for her? Why did they not
do something to break the monotony, the sacrifice, and the hard
work of her life?</p>

<p>He resolved that he would work very hard. Then he would take a
few days off and he would ask Margaret Cameron to go pleasuring
with him. They would go where people were resting on the beaches.
They might go some where on a boat. They could go into the city and
hear some wonderful concerts or see some worth-while pictures, or
to an interesting play. For his share of what she was making life
mean to him, he would try to make some material return. That he
settled on definitely.</p>

<p>One day Jamie mentioned Margaret's children to the little Scout
and found that the child was as indignant as he was.</p>

<p>"There isn't any tellin'," said the little Scout, "as to when
Lolly will get here. She doesn't think about much except herself
and she does mostly what she pleases, but Molly will come. Her
job's a hard one and she may have to rest up a few days. She may
have to close her rooms and get somebody else in them, but if Molly
doesn't come she's got a mighty good reason, and when she comes,
the camp fires and the picnics will begin, and there'll be
something worth while doin' around these parts. When Molly comes
she has greased her bearings and she's hittin' on six cylinders,
and we <i>go!</i>"</p>

<p>The little Scout used both hands to illustrate how they went
when Molly came home.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of fun in Molly to the square inch! She wears a
big kid grin on her face and she ain't afraid of dirt, and she
ain't afraid of water, and she ain't afraid of work, and she ain't
afraid of spending a penny. Talk about persimmons! Molly's
them!"</p>

<p>"I'm waiting anxiously," said Jamie, "to know Molly."</p>

<p>"Well, go on waitin'," said the small person. "Stick on the job,
and when she does come, if you care about girls, why, there's a
girl that's got some juice in her!"</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Jamie. "I think you should know and I've
every confidence in your judgment."</p>

<p>The little Scout was crumbling bread along the edge of the back
walk for a hen mocking bird that had nested in a date palm beside
the pergola. A large chunk of apple from one that was being
consumed in scarcely masticated chunks was laid beside the bread.
In three more bites the apple disappeared, core and all. Juicy
fingers were wiped on the seat of unusually soiled breeches, and
the little Scout took a hold above the hands Jamie had gripped
around the stems of some iris he was transplanting. The added
strength that was brought to bear loosened the roots from the
ground and the Scout Master and the Bee Keeper rolled promiscuously
over each other and down the side of the mountain until they came
to forceful impact with a grapefruit tree. They got up laughing,
and Jamie gathered up the iris. The Scout Master stood daintily
poised. A deep inhalation of breath, an indrawn upper lip, an
outshot lower one, blew the dust from the deep gray eyes. A shake
like a dog coming from the water was sup posed to be sufficient to
dislodge accumulated dirt. An ecstatic expression toned to idiotic
sweetness settled on the small face. With the thumb and second
finger of the right hand a very real piece of dirt was flipped with
exquisite execution from the left shoulder. Then in pantomime
Jamie's condition was inspected through skilfully manipulated
eyeglasses, that Jamie saw perfectly, even when they were not
there.</p>

<p>"Aw, weally," said the little Scout, "I hope you didn't dawmadge
yourself permanently."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Jamie, "and I entertain the same lively
hope concerning you."</p>

<p>"Aw, thanks awfully!" said the little Scout, and with a
continuation of the same breath, "I betcha&mdash;" A hand dived
into a pocket, brought up some small coin and inspected it
carefully. The price of a hot dog and a straw berry pop were laid
aside and the remainder estimated. "I betcha seven cents I can hang
by one foot from the beam of the pergola right there!"</p>

<p>Jamie looked the situation over.</p>

<p>"I'm not taking your bet," he said. "If your foot slipped and
you came down there you'd knock your brains out."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I hit on the <i>ground</i>," said the Scout
Master.</p>

<p>"You would if you struck the stones within six inches of the
ground."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that's the kick to it," said the small person, "just
to find out what I would hit on!" and immediately started scaling
the pergola.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Jamie, "cut that out! You aren't going to hang
from one foot from that cross section. I don't know how long that
pergola's been built, and there's been a lot of water thrown on it
to wash the vines. It may be as rotten as sin."</p>

<p>Steadily the Scout Master climbed upward and presently sat on
the second bar bouncing up and down on it to ascertain its
stability.</p>

<p>Jamie looked belligerent.</p>

<p>"I told you not to do that!" he said, provokedly.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to do it," answered the Scout Master, serenely.
"I heard you. There's nothing the matter with my ears. I can pull
another one just as good, and if I come a smasher 'twon't break any
more than my leg. I'm going to hang by my little finger!"</p>

<p>Before Jamie had time either to say or to do anything, the Body
of the Scout Master was dangling and it was sup ported by one
little finger of the right hand and nothing more.</p>

<p>"All in!" shouted the swaying youngster. "Look out! I'm comin'
down! I'm aimin' for the dirt. Call Grayson if I hit the
stone!"</p>

<p>Down came the Scout Master, landing deftly and with perfect
precision on the freshly watered soil of the garden, perhaps four
inches from the stones that might very easily have broken a
leg.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Jamie, "I told you I wasn't feeling as
good as I might one time, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you didn't need to tell me!" said the Scout Master. "I
could see it for myself, but I can see now that you're about as
husky as they make 'em. You could drive a steam plough or run a
stone crusher or swat a bandit, if you wanted to. I won't do it
again."</p>

<p>Then the Scout Master planted a small pair of feet squarely in
front of Jamie and looked at him with the very Devil dancing in the
depths of the deep eyes.</p>

<p>"Got your goat, didn't I?" taunted the little Scout. "Thought
you'd have to go to the telephone and ring up Mother to come with
the ambulance. By gracious! there goes your telephone!"</p>

<p>Jamie had gotten past the place where the ringing of the
telephone was an event, it rang so frequently in those days. It
might be Carey calling for help. It might be Grayson to explain
some new legal technicality that he had encountered. It might be
the bank calling. It might be the Scout Master's mother wanting her
offspring at home. Jamie wiped his hands on his trousers and walked
to the telephone and picked down the receiver. The Scout Master sat
on the stone that had failed to serve the purpose of breaking any
bones, and with loving pride inspected the west half of the garden
in which they were working and which constituted a beloved personal
possession.</p>

<p>Looking over the length and the width of the acre that stretched
down to the sea, said the little Scout: "When I get through High
School, I'm comin' here to live. They may take their darn colleges
and gamble 'em and smoke 'em and drink 'em and Bolshevik 'em
straight to the Devil! I'm goin' to get my education out of the
books that the Bee Master put in his library. What was good enough
for him, is good enough for me, and while I read his books I'll be
thinking about him. One of the reasons I'm going to keep clean and
walk straight and be decent like he was is because I'm going where
he went, and we're going to see what we can get out of Heaven
together like we got a good deal of fun out of earth. And, oh, boy!
I wish he knew how I miss him!"</p>

<p>In the house, before the telephone with a face sheet white,
hanging to the instrument for support, shaking in every part of his
being, shorn of his new-found strength, torn to the depths of his
soul, stood Jamie. He had picked down the receiver and said,
"Hello!" as casually as any man ever had said it, and then answered
in the affirmative to the inquiry: "Is this James Lewis MacFarlane
of the Sierra Madre Apiary?" Then the voice had continued: "You are
wanted immediately and most imperatively at the Maternity Hospital,
corner of Irolo and Seventeenth Streets."</p>

<p>"Yes," panted Jamie.</p>

<p>The voice went on: "Your wife last night gave birth to a fine
son, but she is not reacting from the anaesthetic as she should,
and we are growing alarmed. We found your address among her
effects. Kindly see how quickly you can reach her. The
probabilities are that she will be asking for you very
shortly."</p>

<p>Jamie hung up the receiver, picked up a pencil and wrote, "Irolo
and Seventeenth Streets," so that he would not forget. Then he
reeled to the bedroom and began seeing how quickly he could put on
suitable clothing to make his appearance on the street. As he
worked he called for the little Scout and when the youngster
appeared, he said: "Lock up quickly. Have the front door key ready
for me. I have an urgent business call to the city and I don't know
when I'll be back."</p>

<p>"Aw!" said the little Scout, in disgusted tones, "I came to stay
<i>all</i> day! There was a lot I wanted to get done on my
property."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Jamie. "Maybe to-morrow. You better call the
gang and play the rest of the day on the beach or run along
home."</p>

<p>He was out of the door, locking it behind him. Then he made a
headlong plunge down the walk and down the street toward the car
line.</p>

<p>The little Scout stood looking after him.</p>

<p>"'Important business!' Well, I'll tell the world it's important!
The house is on fire, the dog's bit the baby, Ma's lost her vanity
case, the Government ain't survivin', God's dropped out of Heaven,
and there ain't a darned thing right in the whole world! Leap to
it, Jamie! Fix it all up fine! Oh, boy!"</p>

<p>The little Scout walked around the house, climbed in the back
window, punched up Jamie's pillow, and lay down on the foot of his
bed.</p>

<p>Jamie sprinted to the nearest street car and rode to the city,
getting instructions on the way as to where Irolo and Seventeenth
Streets might be, and when he landed some distance away, he took a
taxi. Once seated within it, he felt for the check book he had
stuffed in his pocket and all the emergency change that lay in the
little box on the top left-hand shelf of the working library of the
bees. His thoughts were whirling in chaos. The Storm Girl. She had
come to her hour of agony, bravely, with out doubt, as she would.
She had asked no help from him. She had brought a child into the
world, a son. "A fine baby," the voice had said, but it did not
sound as if she were all right. The report had sounded ominous to
Jamie. He had not known that anaesthetics were a part of the birth
of a child. A great many things had happened in the past six years
that Jamie did not know about. He had not known anything worth
while in the beginning as to how human beings entered the world,
but he had been told, he had deciphered for himself, the fact that
it was not an easy journey either for the mother or the child, and
at this hospital that he was going to there was a little living
boy, and the ceremony Jamie had gone through had been for the
purpose of covering the child with an honour able name. That "fine
little fellow" he had been told about was James Lewis MacFarlane,
Junior, and the fine girl, the Storm Girl, the girl of the deep
eyes and the broad chest, the girl of the cold wet face and the
clutching hands, the girl of the quivering lips and the staring
eyes&mdash;what was it? She had not rallied from the anaesthetic?
She was not regaining consciousness as she should, and among her
effects they had found his address, and he was on his way to her. A
minute more and he would be in the room where she was. He would see
her forehead, and the wealth of hair streaming over the pillow, and
her white throat.</p>

<p>Jamie knew what he was going to do. That was definitely settled
in his mind. He was going to take her hands and hold them tight. He
was going to draw her face to his as she had voluntarily yielded it
to him once. He was going to cover it with a passion of suffering
kisses. He was going to tell her that he did not give a darn what
had happened or how it had happened. He never could and he never
would believe that dishonour had touched her or ever could touch
her. He was going to make her well, and he was going to take her
home, and he was going to take care of her. They were going to live
together and love together, and they were going to make something
very wonderful of life. The new blood, the fresh blood, the clean
blood, surged up in Jamie until the hair was almost standing on his
head. He was wringing his hands without knowing what he was
doing.</p>

<p>"They aren't efficient! They aren't doing what they should! I'll
kill the doctor and wring the neck of every nurse in that hospital
if they don't get a move on them!" threatened Jamie. "Birth's a
natural function. You can't tell me that a big, strong girl like
that wouldn't live through it if she had the proper care."</p>

<p>Jamie raced into the hospital and to a desk and down a hall and
into an elevator and then into a small room. He stood beside a bed
and took one long look. Then he turned his ashen face from the
doctor, waiting beside the bed, holding the wrist of the gasping
woman, to the nurse.</p>

<p>"I have made a mistake," he said. "They've given me the wrong
number. This isn't my wife."</p>

<p>The nurse stepped over and from the contents of a drawer picked
up a marriage certificate that he had seen before.</p>

<p>"James Lewis MacFarlane," she read from it and re placed it in
the drawer.</p>

<p>Jamie took a grip on the foot of the bed and leaned over. The
girl lying on it was not a girl he ever had seen, not a girl who,
by the wildest stretch of possibility, could have been the Storm
Girl. Jamie gripped the insensate wood harder and bent lower and
stared wide-eyed. What did it mean? How could this have happened?
Why should this girl have in her possession the certificate which
symbolized the marriage that he had entered into with the Storm
Girl?</p>

<p>He made his way to the side of the bed and looked intently at
the left hand lying nerveless on the coverlet. There was the ring
that he had bought, on the third finger, the cheap little wedding
ring. He picked up the hand and examined the ring until he made
sure. He knew that both the doctor and the nurse were watching
him.</p>

<p>The doctor spoke. "How long has it been since you've seen your
wife?"</p>

<p>Jamie opened his lips to say that never in all his life had he
seen the woman before him and stopped with the words unsaid.</p>

<p>If he said what he was thinking, if he repudiated her, if he
left her to life or the greater mercy of death with the avowal that
he did not know her, that he never had seen her, then where was the
beauty of the deed that he had tried to do in covering a woman who
needed a name with his? After all, it had not made any difference
to him, the night of the storm, what woman bore his name if with it
she recovered self-respect and a decent heritage for an unborn
child&mdash;"a fine little fellow," the doctor had said. If he
opened his lips, the fine little fellow would no longer be fine. He
would be a shame baby, a thing to be pitied, to be scoffed at, to
be shifted around from one charity organization to another. He
would be thrown on the world defeated in the right to a home, to
love, to the proper kind of rearing. It would be no marvel if any
wave of crime or of shame that any one could imagine should engulf
him. And the girl. Jamie stared hard. He realized that if there
were blood in the china-white face, if there were colour in the
lips, if there were lustre in the hair, if those transparent
eyelids would reveal pain-filled, beseeching eyes, she would be
lovely. Possibly there was a man in the world who could have
repudiated her. Jamie could not. Not Jamie MacFarlane. The words
died without utterance.</p>

<p>"You mean," he said, thickly, "that it's strange I don't
recognize her? Maybe it's the pain, and it's been long months since
we were married."</p>

<p>"I've learned," said the doctor, "that there are a good many
curious and some inexplicable things in this world, but I can't
help expressing the opinion that you've been a poor sort of a
husband if you've allowed your wife to go through anything so
crucial as the nerve strain and the physical strain of approaching
maternity and delivery and given no sympathy, extended no care. It
scarcely seems human."</p>

<p>Jamie licked his lips and took his medicine. He could not say
anything in self-extenuation that would not cast a reflection on
the girl before him, and in the few minutes that he had stood
staring down at her he had realized that her every breath was
coming shorter. The hand he was holding was a weight in his
fingers. He gripped it and began to chafe it.</p>

<p>"For God's sake!" he cried, "try to do something! Forget about
lecturing me now! Do something! Don't, don't let her slip away like
this!"</p>

<p>The doctor looked up at Jamie and said quietly: "There is
nothing known to medical science that three of the best doctors in
the city have not been trying all night, and some very excellent
nurses have performed their duties carefully. You might as well
understand that it is very near the end. I thought possibly she
might rally. I thought possibly she might have something she would
want to say to you. I thought you ought to be here in the event she
needed you, and I told you the truth when I said your son is a fine
little fellow. He is a beautiful specimen of physical babyhood.
There's the makings of a fine man in him, and we are needing men in
this country. We seem at the present minute to have an overplus of
hounds."</p>

<p>Again Jamie took his medicine. The taste of it was bitter on his
tongue, because he was not a "hound." He never had been. He had not
the smallest obligation to the woman before him, other than the
obligation that any man owes all women to love them honestly, to
care for them gently, to respect their bodies as the vessels
through which the world must be populated. That was a thing that
had been hammered into him from the hour that he was old enough
even remotely to understand its meaning. He must always take care
of the women. He must always he polite to the women. He must always
be kind to them. They must be taken care of because they were to
make homes; they were to mother little children. They must be
respected. They were the vessels that contained the seeds of life.
From their loins must come the presidents and the senators, the
governors and the business men, the captains and sailors and
soldiers and the tillers of the soil and the ministers who filled
the pulpits and the teachers who moulded the minds of youth in our
schools.</p>

<p>Here lay a woman dying; dying in youth; dying in beauty; dying,
in her own thought of herself, in shame, in scorching anguish,
because some man, somewhere, had held her body lightly and violated
it and consigned it to months of mental suffering, to hours of
pain-racked anguish, to the loneliness of unloved death. Jamie
reeled on his feet and the nurse thrust a chair under him.</p>

<p>She looked at him penetratingly and then she said
deliberately:</p>

<p>"Doctor, there's something about this I don't understand, but I
will not join you in the belief that there is anything unmanly
attaching to Mr. MacFarlane. In the few days she was here before
the child was born, Mrs. MacFarlane seemed to adore him. She had no
unkind word to say against him."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the doctor, sharply.</p>

<p>"I am telling you the truth," said the nurse. "She said that he
was the noblest man, the finest man, in all the world. She said
that he had done one thing so big and shining that no other man
would have done it. She said that she had a feeling that she would
not survive the birth of the baby. When she showed me her marriage
certificate, I supposed she intended me to send for him. I looked
up his residence. She said that if her baby should live, provisions
had been made for it, but she expressed a wish to me that so fine a
man as he might have it. I don't know how to explain the fact that
they haven't been together these months, but I do know that the
fault did not lie with Mr. MacFarlane."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the doctor to Jamie, "very likely I owe you
an apology. I am seeing so much these days that is exactly as
things should not be in this world, that I am getting fairly raw. I
do apologize if I have said something I shouldn't. About your son
and provisions having been made for him, that's up to you. If you
want the child, of course, in the face of this marriage
certificate, the law will give him to you."</p>

<p>Jamie turned to the nurse.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She said once," answered the nurse, "that it was impossible,
but if it were possible, she would give her life gladly if she knew
that you would take the baby and make of him the kind of a man that
you are."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, tersely. "I will take the baby. You may
get him ready. I have a comfortable home. I can see a way in which
he can be well cared for. I will do my best to make the kind of a
man of the boy who bears my name that his mother wanted him to
be."</p>

<p>Then Jamie and the doctor and the nurse were astonished and
bewildered. A low laugh broke from the lips of the girl on the
pillow, a low, exultant, caressing laugh, a laugh full of wonder
and delight and unbelief, and with it ended the last remnant of
breath from the tortured body and the bright head on the pillow
rolled back and lay still.</p>

<p>Jamie covered his face and sat silent, and when he looked again
he saw a sheeted straight line. He looked at the nurse with pitiful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you instructions," he asked, "for necessary
arrangements?"</p>

<p>The nurse nodded.</p>

<p>"Everything has been provided for, and most unusual, all
expenses were paid when Mrs. MacFarlane entered the institution. In
such an event as this we were ordered to prepare her body and send
it to her family."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, arising and mustering his strength.
"Where is the boy?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked dubious.</p>

<p>"You have someone competent to take charge of a new-born baby?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I have," answered Jamie. "A fine, cleanly woman who has reared
three children to maturity."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the doctor. "Give him the baby."</p>

<p>The nurse disappeared and presently returned. She put into
Jamie's arms a bundle odorous of castile and boracic, a thing that
was warm and alive and moving. Convenient to his reach she set a
suitcase, and Jamie put on his hat, crooked his arm around the live
bundle, picked up the suitcase, and walked from the room.</p>

<p>The nurse looked at the doctor and the doctor looked at the
nurse, and they said to each other: "Well, can you beat that?"</p>

<p>"What do you suppose came between them?" asked the doctor. "If
she said things like that about him, why should he leave her, never
to see her again, without a tear of remorse, without a touch of
affection? I've had a good many peculiar experiences in thirty
years' practice of medicine, but this beats everything. I don't
understand it!"</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said the nurse, "and what's more, I don't
believe he does. I must go and put in the calls for the parties I
was told to send for in the event she died. I think she must have
been very much under the weather all the time. I think she came
with the feeling that she would not survive, and I think she had
that feeling because she did not in the least care whether she did
or not."</p>

<p>The nurse picked up a towel and wiped her hands vigorously.</p>

<p>"I get so mad at this sort of thing sometimes," she said, "that
I want to go out and stand on the platforms and in the pulpits and
I want to tell people some of the things I've seen and heard. I'd
like to talk for one solid day to the <i>girls</i> of this country.
I'd like to tell them of the heart ache and the disappointment and
the pain and the shame that they are fixing up for themselves in
their future lives when they undertake to leave the straight and
narrow path and allow themselves voluntarily to become the
playthings of men; to let their honour be taken from them; to let
their efficiency be wiped out; to let their years of training and
the loving care that has been expended on them all go for nothing;
to bring shame and disgrace on their parents, and to do to their
own souls and to their own bodies what this poor dead girl has done
to hers."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said the doctor, "you are one of the people who
still believe in hell fire and damnation."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the nurse, "I do. And I believe in hell at its
hottest and damnation at its damnedest for the men who are
responsible for such anguish as we have seen this girl suffer and
for such a death as we have watched her die. I'd like to take the
men who cannot wait for honest marriage and a time when they are
able to support a woman and give her a home and fortify her body to
serve the functions of wifehood, of motherhood and homemaking, men
who upset everything and ruin everything for their own personal
immediate self-gratification&mdash;I'd like to take them all out
and hang them as high as Haman. Some times I think I just hate
men!"</p>

<p>And to his amazement the nurse broke into tears and used the
towel on her eyes.</p>

<p>"But, look here!" said the doctor. "You spoke up for Mr.
MacFarlane. You said he was not responsible for this."</p>

<p>"And I'll say it again," said the nurse. "Can't you see by what
she told me, by the way he came in, by the way he left, that he'd
never <i>seen</i> the girl before, that he didn't know who she was?
Because some arrangement had been made by which that child was to
bear his name, he assumed responsibility for it, but, good Lord!
you can't convince me in ten years that he had ever seen that girl
there on the bed before, or that the marriage certificate I packed
among her belonging so the child could have it was a <i>legal</i>
document. Don't you think it!"</p>

<p>Then the nurse went her way and the doctor went his way, and the
Keeper of the Bees climbed in the taxi and gave instructions to be
driven back to the blue garden.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. The Partnership
Baby</h2>

<p>When he dismissed the taxi and started up the front walk with
the bundle and the suitcase, Jamie was surprised to find the little
Scout sit ting on the front steps beside a bottle of milk half
consumed, with crumb decorations prominently on the face lifted
inquiringly in his direction.</p>

<p>"Well, look who's here!" said the little Scout. "My gracious!
you look exactly like Dad when he brought Jimmy home from the
hospital!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jamie, "that's a very good way for me to look. Have
you been sitting here ever since I left?"</p>

<p>"No," said the little Scout. "I went through the back window and
lay on the foot of your bed and slept about three hours, and then I
was hungry and I went over to Margaret Cameron's to ask her for
something to eat, and I run into her just as she was leaving. She
said Molly had telephoned her to come in for a few days. I am
waiting at the church to tell you you'll have to get your food the
best you can until she comes back. Didn't strike me until after she
was gone that I'd forgotten to ask her for something to eat myself,
but I knew she wouldn't care, so I climbed in the back porch window
and got a chunk of bread out of the bread box. The milk's
yours&mdash;all that ain't used. Say, Bo, honest, <i>what</i> you
got there?"</p>

<p>Jamie sat down suddenly. His solution of what he was to do with
James Lewis MacFarlane, Junior, had been to transfer him to the
care of Margaret Cameron. He had planned to ask his neighbour to
take the child and care for it until he could find the right kind
of a woman to undertake the job. In the back of his head there had
been a hope as he had driven out that Margaret would use on the
baby the same cleanliness, deftness, and expert care with which
Jamie had not a doubt, from her brand of housekeeping and cooking,
she had reared her own family. Of all the bad luck that he had
experienced in his unlucky days, nothing had been much worse than
that Margaret Cameron should have chosen to go pleasuring, should
have selected the day to start a vacation when he needed her the
very worst. Jamie set down the suitcase and produced the front door
key.</p>

<p>"Unlock the door," he said to the little Scout, and together
they went in.</p>

<p>Jamie laid the small bundle on the davenport and then he stepped
back and drew his hands over his perplexed face and said to the
Scout Master, "I wish you'd tell me what am I going to do."</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you?" inquired the small person, casually. Jamie
pointed to the bundle.</p>

<p>"That's a baby," he said, "a live baby that needs nursing and
feeding and loving, and I thought Margaret Cameron would be the
woman who'd do it. Are you sure she said she had gone visiting and
she would be gone no telling how long?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say 'no telling how long,'" said the Scout Master.
"She said 'a few days.' I should think a few days would be a week,
maybe."</p>

<p>"And what," demanded Jamie, "what am I going to do in 'a week
maybe' with a live baby?"</p>

<p>"Aw, feed it to the birds and let's get on with our work! We're
wastin' a lot of time on the garden," said the little Scout.</p>

<p>"You look here," said Jamie, "you aren't talking about a crust
of bread. That's a baby in that bundle, a tiny boy who wants his
chance to live and to grow and to paddle a canoe and to ride a
horse and to be a Scout Master just as bad as you do!"</p>

<p>"Aw," said the disgruntled small person.</p>

<p>Then the Scout Master walked over and lifted a square of fine
white flannel with a border of forget-me-nots, and peered down at
what was beneath it. Suddenly the Scout Master dropped to a
kneeling position, leaned forward and looked intently. Then a
softened face turned to Jamie over a lean shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get a baby bottle," was the verdict.
"<i>'Tis</i> a nice baby. It's an <i>awful</i> nice baby! It's the
cutest little thing. It's as pretty as our Jimmy was the first time
I ever saw him, and I thought there wouldn't ever be another baby
as nice as he was. But they is. Far as I can see, this baby has got
just as nice clothes and just as pretty a face and just as cute
little hands as our baby had. Say, <i>where'd</i> you get him?"</p>

<p>"He's mine," said Jamie. "His name is James Lewis MacFarlane,
Junior."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned!" said the little Scout. "Ain't the world
gettin' full of James and Jamies and Jimmies! I know about two
dozen. Dad's name begins with James and our baby's Jimmy, and this
baby will be Jamie and you're Jamie. You wouldn't think, with all
the names in the back of the dictionary and names by the yard in
the Bible and fool names that people invent, that so many folks
would have to run to James. Say, <i>what</i> you going to do with
him?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly the question," said Jamie. "What <i>am</i> I
going to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m-m!" said the little Scout. "Lemme think."</p>

<p>Jamie had the impression that he came closer to seeing thought
than he ever had before. The face of the youngster was drawn with
thought. First the body sank back on the heels and then the heels
curled under and the floor made the seat. One arm leaned against
the davenport. One hand, from fingering the blanket, crept up and
closed over the little red fingers of the newborn baby. The little
Scout looked up.</p>

<p>"Pull down that window blind," came the order. "You got to have
a dim light. Their eyes are riley for the first few days. They
can't see. If they get too much light, they go cross-eyed."</p>

<p>There was a return of a few minutes to thought. Then the little
Scout began to think aloud. "My! ain't we accumulatin'! Talk about
compound interest! I'll say things are compoundin' for this
partnership! Here all unbeknownst to ourselves we get a house and
flowers and trees and bees and now, by gracious! we get a baby!
And, of course, if we got it and it's yours, we got to take care of
it. Say, <i>where's</i> his mother?"</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated a second and decided that the truth was the
quickest and the easiest.</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you, Buddy," he said. "I hate to tell you, but
the truth is this baby hasn't any mother. The task of getting him
into the world was too big for her. She paid for his life with
hers. You will be glad to know that she was like your Aunt Beth.
She went over to see what Heaven had in store for her laughing,
laughing out loud, laughing the gayest laugh of contentment and
exultation."</p>

<p>From the floor the little Scout stared up at Jamie with wide
eyes and slowly nodded a corroborative head.</p>

<p>"I know, that was Aunt Beth's smile come true. It's the kind of
a laugh that the smile she had would have been if it had broken
through and come out loud. I told you being dead was beautiful, but
I don't see what's going to become of this little new Jamie. You
never saw the amount of oiling and bathing and bandaging and
changing and dressing and weighing, you never saw anything to equal
the things Mother does to our Jimmy."</p>

<p>Then suddenly the little Scout came up to one knee and then the
other, and then slowly assumed an erect position, then from the
depths of preoccupation, stumbled to the telephone and took down
the receiver and gave a number. Jamie stood breathlessly,
fearfully, and listened to a one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>"I want Mom.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mom, is that you?</p>

<p>"Say, Mom, we got the dirtiest gyp out here this morning! We got
a little splinter new boy baby just like Jimmy when he first came
from the hospital, just as nice and sweet and everything. And, Mom,
this is the dirty part of it. Getting him here was too much for his
mother. She went dead on us and we ain't got her, and we are got
the baby, and his name's Jamie after his dad&mdash;just like our
baby! And, Mom, we thought Margaret Cameron would take him and take
care of him for us, and that's another dirty thing! She's gone off
on a visit and she won't be home for three or four days, and we
ain't got a thing to feed him!"</p>

<p>The little Scout clapped a hand over the mouthpiece, turned to
Jamie, and in a strained whisper inquired: "Have we got any
clothes?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Jamie.</p>

<p>The small person turned back.</p>

<p>"We got oodles of clothes. Everything we need. What we need is
somebody to do the oiling and the feeding and the
changing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the little Scout sprang straight in the air and gave a
shout. "Bully for you, Mom! I <i>knew</i> you'd come across! Do you
see why I didn't <i>ask?</i> I was givin' you your <i>chance!</i> I
knew all the time you would! Least, I was dead sure you would. And
say, Mom, take your roadster and step on the gas! Any minute he may
begin to yell, and we don't know what to do. He just came in the
night. Jamie's too big, and I'm afraid. Take the shortest cut, and
if a speed cop mixes with you, bunt him and come on!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master hung up the receiver and turned to Jamie. The
shoulders drew up, the chin tilted, a gloating look passed over the
features, an indrawn breath was shot out suddenly.</p>

<p>"Um-hum-m!" said the Scout Master, "ain't she the Lallapasooza!
Did you get that? I didn't even have to <i>ask</i> her! Right off
the bat, just crack! Babe Ruth couldn't of hit it cleaner! She
says, says she, 'I'll take care of him for you '&mdash;just like
that!" Both hands waved outward and onward in a curve of exquisite
grace. "Just like <i>that!</i> Whenever you go to bet on the right
royal high-steppers, I've got two bits I'll chalk up on my
mother!"</p>

<p>In the interim Jamie replaced the blanket over the face of the
sleeping baby and looked dubiously at the suitcase. What was it the
nurse had said about having put in personal belongings for the
baby? He had better get those things out and take them into his own
keeping. So he picked up the suitcase and carried it to the
bedroom, opened it on his bed, and pulled out a drawer in the
dresser, pushed aside the clothing it contained, and began emptying
the case. He removed little nighties and dresses and all sorts of
queer soft garments and square-folded stacks, and when in the
bottom of the suitcase he came across a package wrapped in a cloth,
he pulled it open enough to see that it contained strings of beads
and bracelets and trifling feminine adornments.</p>

<p>He had not had time as yet to think of the Storm Girl. When he
did think of her, he realized that the time had come to find her,
and the time had come to settle a fairly long score with her. This
was not playing the game. She had not been fair.</p>

<p>"And of all the women in the world, I wouldn't have selected her
for a liar!" said Jamie, and that minute his sense of outrage was
so strong that he forgot the relief he should have felt over the
knowledge that the woman he had rushed to the hospital to help was
<i>not</i> the Storm Girl. Scot materialism, Scot integrity, Scot
bulldog stubbornness, not alleviated by enough American environment
to tone them down perceptibly, surged up in Jamie.</p>

<p>"She'd much better have a clean heart and be where the baby's
mother is than to be going around in the world high handed and
strong, with a lie on her tongue," said Jamie, and he slammed the
package down and pushed it back and dropped some of his clothing on
top of it and shut the drawer with a bang.</p>

<p>Then he went back to the bed and carefully repacked the baby
clothes. There was lace on some of them and the fabrics were so
fine that they stuck to his work-roughened fingers and clung to
them so that he had to shake some of them off. At any rate, they
seemed to be warm things, there seemed to be enough for two or
three babies, and even to Jamie's unpractised eyes they seemed to
be fine things, carefully made things, lovingly fashioned things,
with tiny buds of pink and forget-me-nots of blue and wee yellow
daisies showing here and there. As Jamie slammed shut the suitcase,
he stood erect and addressed the back window. Possibly he was
speaking to the ocean that glinted blue and gold beyond.</p>

<p>"Right this minute," said the preacher in Jamie, said the judge
in Jamie, said the stern critic in Jamie, "right this minute,
between the two of you, <i>I'm</i> thinking most of the dead
woman!"</p>

<p>He carried the suitcase out and dropped it on the floor beside
the sleeping baby. Then he sat down and turned back the face
blanket and worked back the clothing and pushed away the hood
strings tied under the chin, and looked long and intently at the
baby. He did not remind him of any one. He was very small. He had
eyes and a nose and a mouth. He was extremely red. The girl on the
pillow was not reproduced in him in so far as Jamie could see.
Then, as the Scout Master had done, he examined the hands. He got
more from them than he did from the face. They were perfect hands,
fashioned exquisitely, long, slender fingers, beautifully tapering
fingers, with little nails finished and extended beyond the finger
ends, perfect workmanship, and they were such fingers as paint
pictures and play violins and lovingly handle the kind of books
that the Bee Master had bequeathed to the little Scout.</p>

<p>Jamie turned, saying as he did so: "Did you notice how beautiful
his hands are?"</p>

<p>He got no answer and turned farther. The little Scout had
crossed the porch and gone the length of the walk and opened the
gate and was hopping from one foot to the other in the nearest
wheel track, looking with undivided attention toward the city.</p>

<p>In an unbelievably short time a nifty sport model, a beautiful
car suitable for the show piece of an automobile exhibit, swung to
a deft stop, and almost before it stopped the little Scout was on
the running board. Jamie could see that the dirty arms were thrust
inside and the face lifted to the face of a woman moving toward the
door. He could not hear the conversation that ensued. Some thing
was asked on the part of the Scout Master, and that something met a
laugh that sounded mellow and sweet on Jamie's ears. But the door
was barred, the Scout was insistent, the hand that reached out to
open the door was covered by a grimy hand, and then Jamie
distinctly caught the phrase: "Aw, please, Mom, <i>don't</i>!"</p>

<p>And he heard the answer:</p>

<p>"All right, then."</p>

<p>The little Scout hopped off the running board and opened the
door, and there stepped down a woman who seemed to Jamie to appear
the way any woman ought to look to be just about exactly right, a
radiant picture of wholesome health. A head of gold-brown silken
curls, bobbed short for comfort, sensible clothing, dainty and
pretty, of extreme style in cut. Briskly across the stretch of
sward, through the gate and up the walk toward Jamie, she came, the
little Scout scuffling ahead. The screen door was pulled open as
Jamie stepped back and the little Scout darted through.</p>

<p>"Mom, this is Jamie!"</p>

<p>Jamie made his best bow and stood for inspection. He got it.
Careful, incisive, but not offensively long. A firm hand was held
out to him.</p>

<p>"I've been intending to come for some time," said the mellow
voice that Jamie recognized as one he had frequently heard over the
telephone. "I've had my hands reasonably full with our little Jimmy
and a Danish Princess presiding in our kitchen, and keeping the
children in school. I think I took it for granted that any one the
Bee Master would leave in charge here would be all right, and so I
haven't gotten around to make friends as I should have done. But,
of course, our little Scout has been all right with you."</p>

<p>It happened that Jamie's eyes were on the face of the little
Scout when the expression was used and he saw the deep breath of
satisfaction that swept from the lips of the child. Then past him
hurried the woman that the little Scout had called "Mom." She
dropped on her knees before the davenport. She turned back the
blanket and laughed softly. The face she lifted to Jamie was
beautiful, a Madonna-like face, the face of a woman fashioned for
motherhood.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, "if your baby has cost his mother her
life. I am sorry. But I must congratulate you on the baby himself.
You'll have your compensations. He is a beautiful child, really a
beautiful child!"</p>

<p>The pair of deft hands, glittering with sparkling rings, slipped
under the baby and lifted it, and the mother who had it in her
heart to be a mother to any baby, to all babies that needed her,
sat down in the Bee Master's chair, its first occupant since his
going, and lifted the baby and held it against her breast and to
her face and laughed to it and said sweet little words of utter
nonsense and praised it and curved around it and cuddled it up and
then paused and looked at Jamie.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said the soft voice, "that you were
married."</p>

<p>"I hardly knew it myself," said Jamie. "It was such a very
hurried marriage on account of circumstances I may explain to you
some day. I'd been overseas and I brought back a wound and there
were reasons as to why we had not been much together. I am shocked
beyond expression that the baby's mother lost her life. I had not
even once thought that such a thing might occur, and I had depended
on Margaret Cameron. I didn't know that the child had been born
until they telephoned me from the hospital. I decided I'd stay with
the baby and let his mother's family care for her. I could not
leave the garden and I was sure of Margaret and got back to find
that she had been telephoned for to go on some kind of a jaunt and
she'd started suddenly. Before I knew what the little Scout was
doing, you had your call. I'm afraid it's too big an imposition for
words."</p>

<p>The face that met Jamie's was a laughing face.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about that," Mrs. Meredith said. "I'm willing to
give a few days' time for a lovely baby named Jamie. It will be
like having my baby over again. You needn't worry in the least.
Have you clothes for him?"</p>

<p>Jamie pointed to the suitcase.</p>

<p>"Enough for two or three babies, I'd judge."</p>

<p>To prove his statement, Jamie opened the case. Across the baby a
pair of interested eyes explored its contents.</p>

<p>"Why, those are lovely things, exquisitely made! I almost hate
to use them. I could use some of Jimmy's things just at first when
there is so much oiling, and a tiny baby is rather a mussy
proposition."</p>

<p>"I imagine those things will be more carefully handled in your
hands than at the hospital or even by Margaret Cameron," said
Jamie. "Go ahead and use them. When they are gone little Jamie
shall have some more."</p>

<p>"That's fine!" said Mrs. Meredith. "That's fine! You will have
something of your very own to work for now."</p>

<p>Jamie felt something of a hypocrite as he assented to this
proposition, but in the presence of the little Scout that was not
the time for dissent, so he let the statement go and closed the
suitcase, and when the lady arose he escorted her to the car. There
they met a difficulty.</p>

<p>"I can't drive and hold the baby, too," said Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>The little Scout made a clean leap to the front seat and held
eager arms.</p>

<p>"I can hold him! I can hold him edzactly like you do and keep
the face cloth down. I <i>want</i> to hold him!"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled quizzically.</p>

<p>"And if Fat Ole Bill and the Nice Child and Angel Face come
trooping down the street and see you holding a baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, you look here," broke in the little Scout. "Fat Ole Bill
and the Angel and the whole bunch can just <i>fry</i> in their own
fat! All of 'em's gettin' too fat, anyway. Great big softies!
Anybody that's got any objections to anybody else holdin' a little
bit of a new baby that ain't got any mother and that wants his
dinner can have the best lickin' I've got in my system, and they
can have it quick! Step on the gas, Mom, and let's get him home
before he cries!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master tightened careful arms around the little bundle
and called back: "I'll telephone twice a day. I'm goin' to stay at
home and do all the care-taking my self except the feeding and
changing and bathing. You call me when Margaret comes and you get
your arrangements made."</p>

<p>Jamie went back inside the house and sat down suddenly on the
first chair he saw. He tried to think constructively, reasonably,
humanely. Such an unexpected experience, such a startling
experience, such a pitiful experience, he had not bargained for in
his Adventure. It had come, and Jamie could not figure exactly
why.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said at last, "that when God made trees and
fruit and grain, He knew how He was going to use them. He didn't
intend that they should stand around and fill no purpose, and when
God made men, very likely it was His intention to use them. That is
a wonderful hand little Jamie brought into the world with him. It
may be a useful hand as well as a beautiful hand. It may be that,
if it's carefully trained, there is work in the world that such a
hand can do better than any other hand that ever has been
fashioned. Once in a while there does come into the world one hand
that can do work slightly better, a trifle finer, than any other
hand ever has done it. There is one thing about this experience
that is dead sure. So long as there is blood in my veins and marrow
in my bones, there is not going to be any taint of shame attached
to this baby. He is going to have his chance, no matter who was his
mother. And as for that little mother herself, with that unexpected
and wonderful laughter on her lips stepping across the boundary to
meet her Maker&mdash;" Before he knew what he was doing, Jamie had
slid to the floor and he was on his knees. His hands were clasped,
his face was lifted and he was praying: "Oh God! Great God, Creator
of the Universe and of men and of women and of all that this world
contains, Oh God! have mercy, have mercy on the girl who is coming
before you this morning! Whatever her frailty was, whatever her
fault was, remember the suffering and the price she paid and have
mercy! Take her to your heart, take her to your everlasting home
where there is safety, and cleanliness of body, and purity of mind,
take her with my father and my mother and all the holy angels and
teach her that there is a better way than the way she chose. Have
mercy, Oh Lord!"</p>

<p>Stumblingly, Jamie arose and went to the bedroom. He sat down on
the side of the bed and put his hands over his face and cried until
his lean frame shook, cried his heart out. After a long time, when
the storm had passed, he wiped his eyes and discovered, as he
reached the back porch, that he was hungry. So he went across to
Margaret Cameron's kitchen and burgled his way through a back
window. Into the basket she used he packed every thing he could
find that would spoil in her absence and carried it home with him.
Then, for the first time, he really went about the business of
trying to cook food for himself. He knew where he could take the
street car and find a small cafe not so far away, but somehow he
was in no mood to meet men. He was in no mood to face women. He
wanted to be alone. He wanted to think. He wondered where what
remained of Alice Louise was going to be laid. He wondered if a
small stone was going to be erected above her and if his name would
be carved on that stone. He wondered if it would read "The be loved
wife of James Lewis MacFarlane."</p>

<p>Then he wondered what the name of the baby's mother might have
been and it occurred to him that he had a way of finding out. The
first time he was in the city he could go to the Marriage License
Bureau and ask to see the records on some excuse that he could
think up by that time. He could find out what name the Storm Girl
had written in to fit with Alice Louise. Jamie never in his life
had examined a marriage certificate. The one in which he had been
interested had been compiled by the clerk, a line shown Jamie to
sign on, and then the Storm Girl had signed her name and taken
prompt possession of the document.</p>

<p>When his thoughts reached the Storm Girl they immediately grew
chaotic. Exactly why, he had not as yet time sanely to figure out.
He had the feeling that he had been made a dupe of, that he had
been a good deal of a fool, and yet he knew that feeling was not
fair. The girl had not asked him for anything. He had put up as
strong a case of special pleading as he knew how to build before
she had told him in a few brief words exactly what it was that she
needed. Wherein Jamie felt aggrieved was that she had not been
square. She had not told the truth. She had said what she needed;
she had left him to feel that the offer he had made and which she
had accepted was on her own behalf.</p>

<p>This morning had proven that she had used him not to serve her
own needs, but those of another woman. Jamie realized that he would
have done what she wanted. In that storm, facing his own reckoning
so shortly, as he had felt at that time that he was facing it, he
would have given any girl who had happened to appeal to him in
distress the benefit of his name and what protection he could offer
her. It would not have made any difference who the girl was when
her needs were so very great. It was just that he had gone to the
hospital and had raced to the room expecting to kneel beside the
bed and take the hand of the Storm Girl in his and fight for her
life in a fight that some way he felt certain he could win. When he
had seen a strange face the shock had been so great that he had sat
down tamely and submitted to what the doctors and the nurse had
said was inevitable without even making the beginning of the fight
he had meant to wage for the woman he had thought he was going to
see.</p>

<p>He had been defeated. She had slipped away from him again, and
this time he was angry, genuinely provoked. He had only had a short
time in which to think, and in that time he had told himself
repeatedly: "She didn't play the game square!" In Jamie's eyes that
was almost the worst sin that any one could possibly commit. His
feelings on the subject had only grown stronger during his months
of contact with the little Scout. The little Scout thought as
keenly about playing the game square as he did, and was absolutely
scrupulous in every practice indulged in. Jamie remembered with
some amusement and a throb of pride that when he had asked the
question of sex directly, the answer had been neither a lie nor an
evasion, but straight from the shoulder: "If you can't tell, does
it make a darn bit of difference?" That was fair dealing. That was
leaving the field open. That was the kind of thing that Jamie
liked.</p>

<p>Before he went to bed he called Mrs. Meredith. The baby was
fine. It was no trouble. It had been oiled and fed and rolled up
warmly, and the little Scout was on the job, said the voice that
Jamie thought was the sweetest voice he had ever heard over the
telephone. "None of us are getting much of a chance at the little
new Jamie. Our little Scout has taken possession of him and is on
the job. I think you will need help with the bees seriously before
you get it for the coming few days. There seems to be a feeling of
responsibility that none of us understand. I think perhaps it's all
of a piece with the pride of possession, with the ownership of an
acre of ground and a line of beehives and a fine showing of orchard
and garden. I notice that the little Scout says proudly:
'<i>Our</i> baby!'"</p>

<p>When he had gone back to his bedroom, Jamie was still
thinking.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," he said, "'<i>our</i> baby' isn't a shame baby.
He has a perfectly good name standing for him on the records, and
he's going to have a perfectly good chance, and as for the Storm
Girl, she can go hang! I'm <i>through</i> with her!"</p>

<p>Then Jamie turned out the lights and lay down on his pillow and
decided that he would go to sleep very speedily. Out of the
darkness a voice said to him in the vernacular of the little Scout:
"What's eatin' you? Did you want <i>her</i> to be dead? Did you
want <i>her</i> to go to the horrors that are facing the beautiful
body of Alice Louise?"</p>

<p>Jamie turned over and buried his face in the pillow and cried:
"Oh, my God, no! I didn't think of that! I don't want her heart
broken! I don't want her dead! What I want is to know who she is,
where she is, to have her depend on me, to be able to do something
for her, to be released from my promise not to seek her. No! No!
For her I want life, I want happiness!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17. The Interloper</h2>

<p>If THE little Scout had not been taking a double share of
responsibility for the new baby Jamie, very likely the thing that
happened during this period never would have happened to Jamie the
elder, who did not come far from being considerable of a baby
himself under the right circumstances. To begin with, Jamie had not
as yet been able to reconcile himself to the fact that he owned an
acre of California and a house beautifully furnished with the
exception of one room. He had not been able to take it in that a
world of flowers, an orchard of fruit trees, a garden of
vegetables, and a long row of hives of bees yielding the most
delicious of honey, a very large percentage of it having been
gathered in the delicate blue garden of the bees and in adjoining
gardens&mdash;he had not been able to realize that the most
attractive small house he had ever seen and half of the Sierra
Madre Apiary were his. He had not been able to bring himself to
feel that it was either just or right that all these things should
be his.</p>

<p>He was still looking upon his possessions in a state of
bewilderment. It was true that he had been before the probate
judge; he had fulfilled the requirements of the law. The property
had been transferred to him and Jean Meredith according to the
exactions of the law. Money had been drawn from the bank and the
inheritance tax paid as the Bee Master had provided. And still
Jamie did not feel that he really owned the acre that was standing
in his name. He had the feeling that if he had stayed there for a
long period, say ten years, and had studied the bees and had worked
faithfully; if he had taken the place of a son to the Bee Master
for that length of time and then the Bee Master had made his
crossing and left his property to him, knowing him thoroughly and
feeling that he could depend on him, that, to Jamie, would have
been a right and reasonable transaction. He did not realize that
any one who met him and who was a judge of human nature, in one
good look from Jamie's head to his heels, would have been able to
say definitely what he thought concerning him with very nearly the
same degree of truthful delineation as could have been rendered at
the end of ten years' acquaintance.</p>

<p>Jamie was the kind of a man that women and children and other
men and dogs trusted without asking any questions. Jamie was the
kind of a man who could forget the biggest problem preying on his
mind to bind up the broken leg of a dog, to heal a hurt for a
child. His present predicament was proof of what he would do for
another man, glowing proof of what he would do for a woman. He had
not been accustomed ever to think seriously of himself until the
shrapnel wound tore his breast, and then for two years he had been
forced to think. In the rgime of hospitals and medical treatment
he had faced for such a long period the thought that the end of him
was not so far away that it had become an obsession. Gradually the
garden had worked its magic until now Jamie was once more a man, a
man who was thinking for the little Scout, for Margaret Cameron,
for a girl who had risked her life and lost it and, dying, had left
him a second inheritance, one that Jamie was more willing to accept
than the first.</p>

<p>In the absence of Margaret Cameron he was cleaning house. His
thrifty mother had trained him to be her assistant in childhood. He
knew how to sweep and dust, how to arrange furniture, how to keep a
house immaculate. He was using the broom on the entrance porch when
a taxi stopped before the door. A very smartly dressed young woman
stepped from it and verified the house number. She looked over the
premises with approving eyes and a smile of reassurance on her lips
that caused panic in Jamie's heart. He had not felt that he had
earned the property; he had not felt that he had first right to it;
but he was quite certain that God Himself did not know how much he
loved it, how much he wanted it, and when this attractive young
lady with the smile of assurance that was almost too assured for
the best degree of breeding, looked the premises over and inquired:
"I am not mistaken in thinking that this is the residence of Mr.
Michael Worthington, am I?" Jamie shook his head.</p>

<p>"I think," said the young lady, confidentially, "that I could
have selected Papa's house from any on this street. It looks so
exactly like him."</p>

<p>Jamie had thought that he was fortified for this very thing, but
when it happened he learned that he had not been prepared in the
least. He felt precisely as if some one had slugged him over the
head with a very substantial piece of extremely hard wood. He had
only brains enough left for an observation that he was too polite
to make at hazard, so he said to himself: "Well, it may be that
this house looks exactly like 'Papa,' but God knows that you
don't!" He went further: "And I'd always been taught that there was
a strong probability that girls would resemble their fathers."</p>

<p>What Jamie did outwardly was to get his heels together, square
his shoulders, and manage a bow.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand," he asked, "that you are a daughter of the
Bee Master?"</p>

<p>The young lady looked at Jamie and smiled, probably the most
attractive smile she could muster.</p>

<p>"I am not only a daughter," she said, "but I am his whole
family. Of course, when the news came of Papa's having died so
suddenly and unexpectedly, it was necessary for me to spend some
time seeing that he was laid away as he would have desired to be
and doing everything that I could to comfort Mamma."</p>

<p>Jamie suddenly found himself putting up what he considered a
fight.</p>

<p>"I had understood from the Bee Master," he said, "that both his
wife and daughter were dead."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about his first marriage. Of course, his
first wife was dead before he married Mamma, and I think they did
have a child. I seem to have heard it mentioned, but, of course,
that was long before I was born."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"And I might as well tell you, if you are in charge here, that
Mamma and Papa never could agree. They were always having
difficulties, and at last she was forced to secure a divorce. She
could not live with a man so irritable and exacting, a man who
never wanted to do anything but drone over a book or occupy himself
with some kind of highbrow stuff that nobody human ever could have
been interested in. I didn't blame her a bit. I was entirely on her
side. After she got the divorce, Papa went some where. She never
knew where he had gone. He did not communicate with us directly.
His lawyer sent the money for my support, and I suppose it is to
him that I shall have to appeal to secure the property which right
fully belongs to me as his only child, his only living heir."</p>

<p>"Has nobody told you," asked Jamie, "that the Bee Master left a
will in which he bequeathed this property to a partner he has had
for a period of several years, and to me?"</p>

<p>The young lady laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"There was a rumour. Somebody said something about there being
no effects&mdash;possibly a letter from a nurse at the hospital
where Papa died&mdash;but, of course, when people here know that I
am Miss Worthington and Papa's only child, there isn't going to be
any question as to whom the place rightfully belongs."</p>

<p>Jamie looked very hard at the young person before him. He could
see no reason as to why he should not believe what she said, but
she did not in any way, in any faint degree, resemble the Bee
Master, not a mannerism, not a word of speech, not in the shaping
of hands or feet, not in facial formation or expression. At the
same time, if she carried with her credentials to prove who she was
and that her claim was just, it was nothing more than he had
expected, nothing more than he had been insisting would happen, so
he said: "If you furnish proof that the Bee Master was your father
by blood, if you furnish proof that you have a legal claim to this
property, there is no con testing the fact that it is yours; but
the Bee Master was very clear in his mind, according to the
testimony of his doctors and nurses, until he made his crossing,
which happened in his sleep, and he was very emphatic in his
statements that he had no heir of his immediate blood. What you
will have to do is to show your proof, establish your identity, and
make your claims convincing to the Probate Court of this county. In
case you can do this, there is no question but that the property is
yours. In the meantime, it is standing on the records in my name
and in the name of the Master's partner, and I am in charge here
and I am going to remain in charge until your identity is
established and your claims substantiated."</p>

<p>"And where," cried the young lady, "am I going to remain? If I
have to go into court and make a legal fight of this it may require
weeks or months even, and I had barely enough funds to bring me
here. The allowance Papa made me never was half what it should have
been."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that," said Jamie. "I have nothing to do
with it. But I do know that there is a small fortune in the bees
and the trees and the flowers of this property, and that its value
depends upon the bees being watched, as many of them are swarming
at the present time. There is honey that must be removed to save
the bees from starting robbing, and always in California the
watering must be strictly attended to. In the event that what the
Bee Master wished and intended can be substantiated before a court,
I do not propose, for the sake of his partner, who is now mine, and
for my own sake, to have value depreciate as it will if I step out
and leave the place to the care of a stranger."</p>

<p>Then the first really ugly streak showed in the disposition of
the young woman. She laughed disagreeably.</p>

<p>"Well, there will be no question about your stepping out," she
said, "and about your stepping very speedily. There is not a court
in the world that would cut off an only daughter and an only child
and leave a man's property to almost a perfect stranger. That would
be a little bit too low. And since this house is Papa's, I think I
have every right to remain here."</p>

<p>She turned toward the street and beckoned to the taxi man.
"Bring my trunk and bags," she ordered.</p>

<p>The taxi driver shouldered a small steamer trunk, carried it
into the house, and set it in the middle of the living room,
placing upon it a suitcase and a dressing bag. He was paid for his
services and he climbed in his taxi and drove away, and a strange
young woman with a very determined countenance took off her hat and
looked around.</p>

<p>Jamie was worsted in the first round. He should not have allowed
her to come in the house. He should not have permitted the taxi
driver to leave the trunk. But she had said that she had very
insufficient funds; there was a possibility that a judge might
substantiate her claims; whatever Jamie did or did not do, he had
to be a gentleman. He thought swiftly and he thought correctly. He
thought: "Margaret Cameron is away. If she were here in this
emergency, she would give me a room. She would let me sleep in the
bed that belonged to her nephew, and since I know positively that
this is what she would do, why shouldn't I climb in her back window
and take possession? I will water her garden and see that her
flowers are carefully kept until her return, and in her kitchen I
can cook me something to eat."</p>

<p>So Jamie went into the bedroom and gathered up the clothing in
which he had come, the things that he had bought since his
occupancy, and the package containing the personal belongings of
Alice Louise. He made them all into a bundle and went down the
walk, through the side gate, burgled a back window, and established
himself in the room that he felt certain, from the wall decorations
and its location, had belonged to Margaret Cameron's nephew. Then
he went down to the corner grocery and purchased some food with
which he filled the ice chest. He hung up the "Ice Wanted" sign and
removed the milk and tomato and orange juice he had in the Bee
Master's ice chest, and inside an hour he was dispossessed; but he
was still holding the job, still weeding, still watering, trimming,
and keeping careful watch on more than the bees.</p>

<p>As he worked it appealed to him that the first thing he should
do was to call Mr. Meredith and let him take what action he chose
in his child's interest. So he went to the telephone and, after
hearing all the latest particulars which were enthusiastically
delivered concerning little Jamie, he asked for Mr. Meredith. He
was told that he was out of town and would be away for a week or
ten days. Right there Jamie hesitated. He could take care of his
little partner's interests in the same manner as he would his own.
He could see what legal action was taken and report it when the
time came. There was no necessity for setting Mrs. Meredith and the
little Scout to worrying when there was probably nothing they could
do. So Jamie hung up the receiver without saying that at that
minute the apiary was in the hands of an interloper.</p>

<p>As Jamie worked, this same interloper came down through the
garden on a tour of observation. She had changed her dress for
another, light and attractive. With the stains of travel removed,
she seemed more like a world of girls such as Jamie saw everywhere
every day. The difficulty was that she seemed so much like them
that Jamie was not interested. It had to be an unusual girl,
someone different, someone giving at least slight evidence of
having a human heart, mental culture, and consideration of others,
to make Jamie look twice. This young party evidently was thinking
mostly of herself. Jamie watched her advancing toward him down the
back walk and the first thought that came to him as she was sharply
delineated in a patch of sunlight was: "She looks hard."</p>

<p>Persistently he went on with his work. The girl was now within a
few yards of him. She stopped and studied him intently.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," she said, "there's nothing here that can
suffer greatly in the few days that will be required to arrange the
papers so that I can come into possession of my property. I prefer
that you leave me in undisputed possession."</p>

<p>Jamie looked at the girl and smiled, and it was a winsome smile,
a bonny smile.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," he said, "that you are asking a good deal of
human nature? I've been caring for this place for quite a while
now; I've been thinking it was my own for some time past. You are
confident to an unusual degree if you think I am going to walk out
and turn over property that stands on the records in my name
without having seen any proof you have to offer, without knowing
whether you can establish the claims you make before a court. Do
you mean that if you came into possession of this property you
would live here, you would make your home here?"</p>

<p>The young lady glanced around her. Jamie's incredulity irritated
her.</p>

<p>"What kind of a back number are you?" she asked. "As we came
here I thought we were going about twenty miles from the station I
came in at."</p>

<p>"And so you were," replied Jamie. "You are a good guesser."</p>

<p>"And what would a girl, just when she has a right to have a good
time, want to be marooned in a place like this for? If there is
anything I am afraid of it's a bee. If there's anything I hate it's
a mountain. If there's anything I hate worse than a mountain it's
the sea. If there is anything I can't abide for a few hours at a
stretch it is such stillness as this, such deadening, sickening
silence. Does anything ever happen here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "you came, and the bees are beginning to
swarm every few days. There's fruit to be picked. There's
sprinkling to be done. There's hoeing and cleaning and work
a-plenty, more work than any one man can do as well as it should be
done."</p>

<p>"In other words," said the young woman, "you are proposing to
stay here and keep an eye on me."</p>

<p>"You said that," said Jamie. "What I said was that I was
proposing to stay here and take care of the property, to do the
sprinkling, to hive the bees."</p>

<p>"I'm not such a fool that I don't know why you will not go,"
said the young person.</p>

<p>"Draw your own conclusions," answered Jamie. "This side of the
garden needs watering to-day. I am going to water it." And he
quietly went on with his work.</p>

<p>The young woman stood still a minute and then she said:</p>

<p>"I want the keys to the chest Papa always kept his papers in.
Undoubtedly there are things there that will help me to establish
my interests."</p>

<p>"Tell that to the probate judge," said Jamie. "If he wants that
chest unlocked and the papers that it contains turned over to you,
he will send a clerk to go through them with you and to make a
record of them and place them in evidence before they are tampered
with."</p>

<p>It happened that Jamie was keeping watch&mdash;oblique watch,
but nevertheless a sharp watch&mdash;on the face of the girl when
he made that statement. He saw the arrested breath; he saw the
whitened face; he saw the tense pause and the deep thought, and the
voice that sometimes talked to him inside himself said to him: "Now
she doesn't like that. She doesn't want any one present when that
chest is opened. She doesn't want a record made of those papers.
She doesn't like the idea of asking the probate judge to send a man
to go through them with her."</p>

<p>Jamie immediately attached another length of hose and drew his
work up the slope until he was opposite the window that gave the
best view from the living room.</p>

<p>In this manner time went on. He had occupied Margaret's house
and kept his eye on the young person for two days and one night,
and he was fairly well tired out when the young lady passed
Margaret Cameron's and Jamie watched her take the trolley for the
city. He went over to the house. He did not see how it could wear
the same expression on its face that it had always worn. It would
have comforted him if it had looked very much disgusted and
displeased, but it did not. It smiled on the roadway and the
mountain-side on which it looked with exactly the same serene,
placid smile of invitation that it always wore for him. He tried
its doors, but they were all locked. He looked in the window, but
he could see nothing except that the trunk was standing in the
middle of the living room and the wardrobe of the young lady seemed
to be mostly draped over the Bee Master's chair. He decided that
this would be a good time to work Margaret Cameron's garden, so he
went over and turned on the hose. He was busy there when he heard
the light padding of beach shoes behind him and turned to face the
little Scout.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello! How's everything?"</p>

<p>"How's everything at your end of the line?" parried Jamie.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the little Scout. "I'm doin' all those things that
I told you I'd do for our partnership baby. He's going to be an
awful nice baby. Mother's crazy over him. She cuddles him up and
takes care of him edzactly like she did Jimmy, but she ain't much
stuck on this bottle business. She says it's an awful nuisance to
fix the bottle, and she says it's an awful pity that any baby
should have to lose its mother because she says that a baby, when
it's a little thing like that, gets more from its mother than just
milk. She says it gets a steady stream of love. She says that a
baby that lies on its mother's breast and looks in her eyes and
lays one little hand on her neck, gets with its food something that
it knows about all its life. She says it tain't natural and it
tain't right for a baby to be laid all alone on a pillow and any
old bottle propped into its mouth. It ain't propped with Jamie,
'cause I hold it, and it's a good thing this happened while there's
no school, 'cause I'm tellin' you that you wouldn't believe all the
things I do when there ain't any body looking. I can hold the
bottle, and I put my arm around Jamie so's maybe I can kind of fool
him into thinking he's got the same stream of love along with his
milk that our Jimmy got. I tell you, our Jamie is just keen. My
goodness! there I've gone and used Nannette's word! That's the only
adjective Nannette knows. Her shoes are keen, and her dress is
keen, and her hair-cut is keen, and the party is keen, and the
picture is keen, and I've heard it so much I hope to goodness I
ain't goin' to go and get keen, too!"</p>

<p>Jamie laughed.</p>

<p>"You don't have to 'get keen,' Mr. Scout Master," he said.
"You've been perfectly keen ever since you've been born!"</p>

<p>The little Scout was evidently pleased. There was a slight
increase in height; there was a funny toss of the head.</p>

<p>"Well, who's going to shake dice with the right kind of a swing,
and manage a bunch of Scouts, and do a whole lot of other things
that I been up against all my life, and not be pretty keen? I'm
keen on this place, I can tell you that! I'm about dead for it. I
was telling Mother this morning that the very minute I get through
'readin' and writin' and 'rithmetic,' I'm going to come here and
get on my job. She says I'm going to college, but there are a whole
lot of things about me that she doesn't know as well as she might,
and college is one of them."</p>

<p>Then the Scout Master amply proved to Jamie the claim that had
been made. He felt himself being subjected to a long look. He felt
the length of a small figure pressing against him. He felt a hand
unusually clean slipping up over his left side. He heard a voice so
soft and sweet that it reminded him of a certain telephone voice
that he knew.</p>

<p>The voice wailed: "Oh, Jamie! Your side didn't <i>tear</i>, did
it? You ain't got it all to do <i>over</i> again, have you?"</p>

<p>Jamie put his arm around the little Scout.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said, "my side's fine! It's getting better every
day. I have it in the back of my head that in two or three months
more I will not even have to wear the lightest kind of a pad or a
bandage."</p>

<p>The Scout Master looked up.</p>

<p>"Then <i>what's</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated.</p>

<p>"Your face looks pasty and your eyes are dead tired. You look
all beat out. You look just like I do when the Scouts go to
rough-housing and I've had to lick the bunch. Sometimes I look at
my face when I brush my teeth and I can see just how big my job is.
Right around my eyes I can see it. And I can see things around your
eyes now. What's the <i>matter</i>?"</p>

<p>Jamie thought swiftly. He did not want to tell the little Scout
what was the matter, in Mr. Meredith's absence. He did not want
Mrs. Meredith worried with a legal complication when she had undue
care of the baby for whose care he had assumed responsibility. He
thought fast and hard and let the moment slip.</p>

<p>"You are all right, little Scout," he said. "You <i>are</i>
rather keen. I was worried last night and I didn't sleep well. I
was kind of keeping watch over our place and Margaret's."</p>

<p>"Isn't Margaret back yet? Things look all shut up," observed the
Scout Master.</p>

<p>"I imagine she's gone into the city to have a vacation visit
with the Molly you're always talking about," said Jamie. "I'm
taking care of things for her while she is gone."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go over and take a look at my property," said the
Scout Master, grinning broadly at Jamie.</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie.</p>

<p>Neither of them had noticed that the interloper had passed
Margaret Cameron's while they were watering her garden and had
unlocked the front door and entered the house of invitation. The
Scout Master flew over the fence, trotted down the gravel walk,
waved a salutation to the jacqueranda, and took the curve passing
the front of the house for the very natural reason that the one
acre which stood on the county records in the name of Jean Meredith
lay on the right-hand side of the house as one approached it from
the entrance. As the child crossed the walk, there was a noticeable
movement in the living room and the whiff of an odour that acted on
the little Scout as a stiff breeze of formic acid acts on the
wild.</p>

<p>With a large fund of assurance, the Scout Master crossed the
porch in a bound, swung open the front door, and faced the open
trunk, the dresses draped over the Bee Master's chair; faced, also,
a young woman with an unduly bleached head and over-painted face, a
young woman who, to the eyes of the Scout Master, was a fine
combination of everything in the world that a nice young woman
should not be. The youngster stared in amazement.</p>

<p>"How come?" was the greeting shot at the interloper. The
suggestive hands were thrown out, one in the direction of the
trunk, one of the chair.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kiddo," said the young person. "You're sure my luck!
Take this dime and run to the nearest grocery and get me a bottle
of milk, and when you bring it back, I'll give you a nickel for
going."</p>

<p>The Scout Master stood still and looked hard at the young woman,
looked long and intently and remembered something and could not
tell exactly what.</p>

<p>"You're not, you're not Jamie's mother, are you? But, of course,
you couldn't be Jamie's mother 'cause Jamie's coming made her too
sick and she had to go across whether she wanted to or not. Who are
you, and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"That's nothing to you," said the young lady. "Run along and get
my milk, and then I've got about fifty other errands I want you to
do. You can pick up quite a bit of my small change in the next hour
or two if you move so that you stir the dust at all."</p>

<p>The Scout Master stood still. With hard, almost feverish eyes
the face of the woman was scanned. The eyes especially were studied
deeply. The trunk and the clothing, the abominable odours of cheap
soaps and vile per fumes, all registered adversely on the child's
mind. This woman in the house and Jamie at Margaret Cameron's, and
doing nothing about it! That was exactly like Jamie. It had been
the private opinion of the little Scout for some time that as a
fighter Jamie might hold his own among the Germans, but he did not
show much inclination to hold his own when somebody tried to give
him a wonderful piece of property. Vaguely the thought that had
begun stirring in the back of the Scout Master's head stirred
deeper and cleared up and took form. The small hand was thrust
out.</p>

<p>"Give me your dime! Sure I'll do your errands for you!" said the
little Scout.</p>

<p>With the dime tightly gripped in one hand, the Scout Master
sailed over the fence and landed almost at the feet of Jamie, and
there the child stared at him belligerently.</p>

<p>"<i>Who's</i> the Jane in the crooked make-up and the dirty
Skirt?" The demand was brief and to the point.</p>

<p>"Is there any one in the house?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>He was so taken aback he reverted to his father's child hood and
said "hoose."</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' you there's someone in the 'hoose!'" cried the
little Scout. "There's a comedy queen in the 'hoose'; A Jane like
that draped all over the Bee Master's chair and her trunk open in
the middle of the floor! What did you let her in for?"</p>

<p>"She walked in," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"And wasn't you big enough to keep her out?" demanded the little
Scout, tilting up a head to look to the full extent of Jamie's six
feet plus.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was," said Jamie, "if I had used force, but I'm not
given to using force on the ladies."</p>

<p>"So you cleared out and came over here and you turned over
<i>our property</i> to that piece of Limburger cheese!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I did," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, you put the biggest crimp in my style that any body ever
did," said the Scout Master. "I bet you just walked out like a
milk-fed turkey an' never put up one war-like gobble!"</p>

<p>"I told her," said Jamie, "to tell it to the probate judge."</p>

<p>"Aw!" said the Scout Master in the hoarsest, roughest tone Jamie
ever had heard issue from the small throat. "Aw, what's the use of
the probate judge? You <i>knew</i> the Bee Master, and you know
<i>he</i> wouldn't do anything that wasn't fair and right. If you
want to lop over like a California Christmas candle, you can just
do it! You can give her <i>your share</i> if you want to, but
believe you me," the hands were in action, "believe you me, Mr.
James Lewis MacFarlane, you will not give away <i>my</i> half of
that bee garden, 'cause that was the only chance I've ever stood of
getting a horse. The reason I didn't get a horse wasn't 'cause
there wasn't enough money in the family to buy a horse; it was
'cause I couldn't keep a horse in a city. Out here I don't see why
I couldn't. There's no neighbours on my side to object. I'll see
that flax-wig in there doing me out of my horse!"</p>

<p>The little Scout thrust forth a hand and disclosed a dime.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the grocery to get milk for her, and then there's
'fifty other errands,'" suddenly the little Scout changed to the
woman in the house and in an exact imitation of the tone and manner
that Jamie recognized he heard, "'Kiddo, there's about fifty other
errands you can do for me.'" There was another change. "You can
stake your roll 'Kiddo' is going to stay right here on the job!
'Kiddo' is goin' to do the errands. 'Kiddo' is goin' to find out
some way to get that Jane out of there and get her out pretty
quick. 'Kiddo' happens to know a whole lot of things that you
don't, and 'Kiddo' is just beginnin' to get wise to who that party
is!"</p>

<p>Both hands flew out, one of them widespread, the other gripping
the dime. "Let me tell you, 'Kiddo' is savin' a last arrow for that
party right in there! 'Kiddo' owes it to the Bee Master to puncsher
her until you can see daylight clear through her! Maybe you think I
ain't got her number now. Maybe you think I don't know who pushed
little Mary and broke her spine and made her die! You watch me! If
you ain't going to fight, I <i>am</i>. How did you get in this
house?"</p>

<p>"Walked in," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"All right," said the little Scout, "I'm going to telephone
Mother and I'm goin' to get my Scouts on the job, and you put your
ear to the ground and listen for a rumble. 'Kiddo' is letting loose
the dogs of war, believe you me!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master brought both feet down with an emphatic slap
and presently Jamie heard the ringing of the telephone and he
heard, too, the voice of the little Scout.</p>

<p>"Say, Mom! Margaret Cameron's away and my partner out here needs
me. I'll prodibly have to cook his dinner for him. I may not get in
till late. If it's too late, he'll bring me. Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, but this big baby out here needs taking care of
worse than baby Jamie. I'll tell that to the assembled
multitude!"</p>

<p>The receiver hit the hook hard enough to break both and the
Scout Master went through the front door and started on a skimming
run in the direction of the corner grocery below. Jamie sat down
and began to think. Then he went to the telephone and called John
Carey. He asked if in the event any of the bees threatened to swarm
the next day, he could depend on him for help. The reply was that
he could. Carey would come over in the morning and they would look
the hives over and get some fresh ones ready for swarms to
occupy.</p>

<p>Presently Jamie saw the Scout Master enter their front gate and
go up the walk with the bottle of milk. After that he saw a bunch
of papers and odds and ends carried to the incinerator. Then he
watched the gathering of tomatoes and vegetables, the picking of
fruit that was carried to the kitchen, and when he went over to get
a better idea of what was going on, he saw in passing a window that
the Scout Master was standing in the middle of the living room
fitting dresses over the Bee Master's coat hangers and hanging them
up in his closet. Presently the little Scout came out to him.</p>

<p>Jamie was surprised at the expression on the small face. It had
become absolutely inscrutable. It did not remind Jamie of anything
he ever had seen. It was a trifle white, a trifle set, immobile to
the last degree. It was only by looking closely that Jamie saw that
the entire figure was tuned up like a fiddle string, stretched and
taut and ready to respond to the note it would be called on to
deliver. Suddenly, in Jamie's heart there leapt up a feeling of
confidence. The Bee Master had said that the little Scout knew.
Thereupon it appealed to Jamie that it would be a wise thing on his
part to stand guard while the little Scout went into action on the
basis of whatever knowledge would furnish the grounds for
action.</p>

<p>Said the Scout Master, "She is trying every key in the house on
my chest and pretty soon she will find one that fits, and that
chest is just wadded full of things that ain't any of her business.
That's got Highland Mary's things in it and little Mary's things.
It's got marriage certificates and deeds. It's got business papers.
It's got the signed up settlement that settles that little flapper
in there for life. I know who she is. I know what she thinks she
will do. And believe you me, she can do it if she gets that chest
open, and that chest belongs to me. What are you going to do about
it?"</p>

<p>"Where's the key?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"My dad's got it," said the little Scout. "It's among the things
the Bee Master had at the hospital with him and the day things were
settled the probate judge gave 'em to Dad to keep till I'm of age.
It's in his desk at home. I could get it by making a run in, but I
ain't going to do it. That reminds me that she ain't going to
unlock that chest with any key she'll find around the house, nor
any key she will get made, 'cause that chest's got a private kind
of a lock on it and there's a leaf in the carving where you've got
to press a spring before the lock will work. Days when I had done
everything else and I was getting ready to go home and the Bee
Master was so lonesome for something alive and something to talk to
him he would let me work that combination and show me the things
and let me look at the pictures and let me see the things that were
in there that belonged to big Mary and little Mary. And that's
what's been working in my head. There's a picture in that chest of
that Jane when she was little, and she looked just about as measly
as she does now. It's got a name and a date on it, too, that will
kind of fix her if she don't look out what she tells the probate
judge. She can't get in that chest unless she splits it with an ax,
and if she ever does that&mdash;zowie!"</p>

<p>The face lifted to Jamie was the face of a small pagan dealing
justice. There was not a hint of mercy; there was not a hint of
tolerance. It was as inexorable, as immobile as the face of the
figure of Justice holding the scales above the judge's chair in the
office of the Probate Court. A cold shiver crept down Jamie's back.
For the first time he addressed his small partner by name.</p>

<p>"Jean," he said, "Jean, be mighty careful what you do. I am not
claiming that I haven't got an awful wrench in the prospect of
being driven from the garden, of giving up what the Bee Master
meant me to have, but however much your share of it means to you it
cannot mean what it would if you did some terrible thing and got
yourself put in prison or blackened your whole life. There is only
one way to manage these things, and that is to let justice take its
course."</p>

<p>"Edzackly what I think!" agreed the little Scout. "I'm not
believing that there isn't justice in this village, and I'm not
believing it ain't goin' to take its course if I spring from ambush
like Chief Running Horse at the right time. I told you before, I
tell you now, you keep out of this and you watch my dust!"</p>

<p>The little Scout wheeled and went back to the house. Facing the
interloper, in tones of suave politeness, this message was
delivered: "Mistaw MacFarlane says to tell you that the keys of
Mistaw Worthington's chest are in the care of Mistaw Meredith and
that Mistaw Meredith will be out of town for several days and they
cawn't be delivered until his return."</p>

<p>"Well, I have no time to wait," said Miss Worthington. "I've got
to go through the papers that belong in that chest. I've got to
open it if I smash it."</p>

<p>The little Scout smiled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Worthington said that chest came from across the ocean with
his grandfather's housekeeping things and it was hand carved and it
once belonged to a Queen. If you tried to break it open and damaged
it, and if what you found didn't satisfy the probate judge as to
who you are and what you are doin' here, you'd get yourself into
pretty serious trouble, 'cause here in California we begin to train
the babies along with their bottles&mdash;which are ag'in Nature
and I don't recommend 'em, but I thought they'd sound more polite
than mentionin' the other way&mdash;anyhow, we begin to train 'em
that early to pull off their hoods and wave 'em when anybody says
'Antique.' We swat 'em on the dome impressive if they don't. We
adore antique chests and tables and chairs and rugs and things, and
you better look sharp, 'cause California wouldn't <i>like</i> it if
you abuse anything antique."</p>

<p>"Say, look here!" said Miss Worthington. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a kid round this neighbourhood. What's your next?"</p>

<p>"Drag that trunk into the bedroom."</p>

<p>The Scout Master advanced and stooped to one end of the trunk,
looked around and about and said politely: "Kindly take the other
end. These rugs are also antique and furniture can't be dragged
over them, and besides that, your trunk is about twice my size,
even if it is a steamer."</p>

<p>Miss Worthington hesitated a minute and then took one end of the
trunk and helped to carry it into the Bee Master's sleeping room.
The little Scout looked at the open closet from which Jamie's
clothing had been removed, at the open drawers from which he had
taken his belongings, and a wave of anger surged up that very
nearly up set the brand of self-possession that the Scout Master
was trying to maintain. The thought that was at that minute in the
small head was whether fists that were sufficiently hard, muscle
that was sufficiently tough, were not equal to the task of pitching
this interloper through the window down a particularly steep piece
of mountain-side leading toward die sea. But the mentality of the
little person spoke up.</p>

<p>"Go on and pitch her! Chances are big soft Jamie would be
standing outside and catch her in a blanket and bring her in and
put her to bed and stand up all night himself watching to see
whether she was going to open that chest or not, and he prodibly
wouldn't stop her if she did. What's the use if I did pitch her? It
wouldn't get me anywhere. I better just stick around and stay on
the job and see what she's going to do."</p>

<p>So the Scout Master ran innumerable errands and watched with
blood literally at the point of boiling while the house was
searched from top to bottom. Drawers were emptied, books shifted on
shelves. At last the little Scout lost patience.</p>

<p>"Say, what's eatin' you?"</p>

<p>Miss Worthington fairly jumped.</p>

<p>"Think you're going to find the Kohinoor or the Drums of
Jeopardy?"</p>

<p>"Whadda you mean?" demanded Miss Worthington.</p>

<p>"Sounds too funny," said the Scout Master, "to hear you say you
are Miss Worthington and then say 'whadda.' I should think the Bee
Master would have taught you when you was about two years old to
say 'What do you,' and I didn't suppose you <i>would</i> know what
I was referring to, but it's strange he didn't teach his own child.
He's the one who taught me that the Kohinoor is the biggest
sparkler in the world, and the Drums of Jeopardy are the biggest
emeralds. I got that out of a picture show. It was a hair-raiser,
too. And it had the prettiest girl in it, a girl with dark hair and
eyes and a <i>reasonable</i> amount of lip stick and her make-up on
straight, and she could act, too! She was just a humdinger, I'll
tell the world!"</p>

<p>"If you are so carefully educated," said Miss Worthington, "why
do you use the slang that you do?"</p>

<p>The little Scout laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got to sling that brand of guff to keep in favour with
the Scouts. If I talked among them the way Dad makes me talk at
home, I wouldn't be Scout Master with my bunch very long. When we
play we're Indians and bandits and pirates and things like that, we
talk that way 'cause it makes it realler, and anyway, nobody
expects a ten-year-old kid to talk the way a woman of thirty
would."</p>

<p>"I am not thirty!" snapped Miss Worthington.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the Scout Master, "I knew you were close to
forty. I only said thirty for politeness."</p>

<p>"I'm done with you now," said Miss Worthington, "You may go
home, but you'd better come around again in the morning and see if
there's anything you can do for me."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Scout Master. "I'll be right here, and
I'll start home whenever you pay me for what I've done to-day. I've
been flying pretty lively all afternoon and I'm getting hungry
enough to eat up every hot dog on the corner stand!"</p>

<p>"I'll pay you in the morning," said Miss Worthington.</p>

<p>"I'll take my pay now," said the little Scout. "I happen to be
out of change and I'm tellin' you I'm hungry."</p>

<p>Miss Worthington produced her pocketbook and, taking some small
change from it, dropped it into the outstretched hand. The little
Scout counted it twice.</p>

<p>"Say, you ain't throwing your change to the birds, are you?"</p>

<p>But the inquiry was good-humoured. The Scout Master had decided
to be on the job in the morning.</p>

<p>"What time do you want me?"</p>

<p>"Better make it about nine."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Scout Master, "maybe I can get here an
hour sooner and wipe up the dust on the furniture or straighten
things out for you, or clean your shoes. I often clean my mother's
shoes. I know how."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Miss Worthington, "come as soon as you want
to."</p>

<p>"I'll be right here," said the little Scout, "and for your own
sake, 'cause I'm so fond of you, I'm just telling you before I
start that you better remember how California feels about antique
furniture."</p>

<p>The little Scout closed the door and went down the path and
scaled the fence and said to Jamie: "I can't chase up a reason for
staying there any longer, and I'm about sick hungry. If you can
hang out the night and do something to scare her off about getting
into that chest until morning, I'll go on the job again pretty soon
after seven, and I'll stick at it until I see if I can't make
<i>something</i> happen."</p>

<p>Then the line of march was taken up to the nearest hot-dog
stand. A few rods away the little Scout turned.</p>

<p>"Let me wise you up to this: if she gets desperate in the night
like the hardened criminals do, she may try breaking my chest. Be a
good idea for you to take the ax or anything she could pry with out
of the tool house and fasten the windows on the inside where they
latch and lock it on the outside. If she can't find anything that
just suits her to attack with, maybe she will let it be until
morning."</p>

<p>And that was what Miss Worthington did. She was tired herself.
Being too lazy to cook, she ate bread and milk, took a bath, and
went to bed early, and she was still asleep when the Scout Master
arrived in the morning. Depending on the assurance that he would be
called if needed, Jamie, reeling for lack of sleep, stretched
himself on his bed and went over the edge. The situation for that
day was up to the little Scout.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18. The Little Scout on
the War Path</h2>

<p>Up until ten o'clock the little Scout served as kitchen maid,
lady's maid, house maid, errand boy, anything the interloper
required. Then a load of worthless paper was sent to the
incinerator which stood in the middle of the lower portion of
Jamie's side of the garden, halfway between the hives of the Black
Ger mans and the long row of the Italians. As the Scout Master
scratched the match and lighted the papers and stood a few minutes
to watch the burning, an ominous rumbling that came from somewhere
in the direction of the Italians became noticeable.</p>

<p>"Um-hum-m-m," said the little Scout. "Dunno but I better call
Jamie. Some of his bees are going to swarm." Coming back up the
walk there was a pause of a second beside the hydrant. The Scout
Master had intended to set a few drops trickling to keep the mint
bed happy, but the heaviest hose was attached and stretched up the
walk. The nozzle could be seen lying above one of the jacqueranda
trees, open enough to let a tiny stream drip no faster than the
earth would absorb it for the watering of the tree. That
jacqueranda tree seemed to be particularly precious because, under
its lacy shade of serene blue, some of the very happiest hours that
the Bee Master had ever conjured up for the amusement of the little
Scout had been spent. So the Scout Master left the back walk and
circled around the house, and turned the nozzle one faint degree
wider open, and laid it down in a new place as a slight expression
of devotion to that special jacqueranda.</p>

<p>As the nozzle touched the earth there came from inside the house
a splintering crash. The little Scout straightened suddenly, eyes
wide open, muscles tense, and with a lighter step than ever was
used in the fairiest pirouetting, the ground was covered to the
side window. Carefully drawing the weight of the body upward, the
little Scout peered through the open window in time to see the lid
of the antique chest wide open. The ax, that must have been secured
and hidden somewhere in the house before Jamie had locked up the
previous night, lay on the floor.</p>

<p>Breathlessly the Scout Master clung to the window and peered in.
The time was past for diplomacy. War had been declared. The enemy
had invaded the most sacred stronghold of the Bee Master, of the
little Scout, of the Keeper of the Bees. It was time for action.
Clinging to the window sill with eyes wide open and mouth
considerably wider, the little Scout watched while the waste paper
basket that belonged beside the Bee Master's writing desk, the big
Indian cooking basket, was filled indiscriminately with everything
that could be gathered up from the contents of the chest that was a
picture, a paper that looked as if it might contain the slightest
record of any transaction. Nothing but playthings, jewellery,
ornaments, laces, and scarves were left. The basket was heaped to
the top. Then Miss Worthington arose, possessed herself of a
handful of matches from a dish over the mantel, and picking up the
basket, started toward the back door.</p>

<p>Deftly the Scout Master dropped from the window sill, raced to
the jacqueranda, caught up the hose, and darted down the side of
the vine-laden pergola until the hydrant was reached. There was a
pause to shut off the hose and turn the hydrant until the hose
swelled and writhed like a snake. Behind the thickest wall of vines
the little Scout crouched and hung on to the hose, both eyes
trained on the incinerator, still smoking and with fire in the
bottom from the papers that were smouldering. Peering through the
vines of the pergola, the Scout Master could see that the girl was
not yet coming and again the soft buzzing called attention to the
neighbourhood of the incinerator. The little Scout leaned low and
peered from side to side and stepping lightly, remaining screened
to get a clear view, watched for the girl's approach. Then in an
ominous roar almost at one and the same time from two hives of
Italians there came streaming swarms of bees that were leaving
their hives, honeycombs filled and bee crowded, to seek new homes,
at the behest of the old queen.</p>

<p>The little Scout's eyes opened wider. The hose dropped from the
small fingers. One leap carried to an opening in the pergola. A
twist carried through, and small feet raced wildly up the back walk
and to the back porch and shaking hands grabbed the bee drum. One
glance in the kitchen showed Miss Worthington on her knees beside
the basket with nervous fingers sorting out the papers and the
things that she had thrust into it with small discrimination.</p>

<p>"For a little time," said the Scout Master, grabbing up the
drum, "I sure am thankful." And a wild race began for the region of
the incinerator, and softly on the morning air broke the slow
rhythmic "Drum, drum, drum-drum-drum," and the bees that were
swarming in the air began to gather. The drum led them first to an
orange branch within three yards of the incinerator, then headed
off an other bunch and guided them toward a fig branch on the
opposite side. "Drum, drum," the little Scout stood with bulging
eyes and parted lips in a cloud of bees, watching first one swarm
and then the other. The air was still thick with them, but it was
apparent to experienced eyes that the queen of each swarm had
settled and that was all that was necessary.</p>

<p>"Drum, drum, drum-drum-drum," the eyes alternated between the
bees and the back porch There she came; the basket full to
overflowing, one hand circling it full of matches, the other hand
full of the papers that it was most essential to destroy. Keeping
under cover of the trees and the flowers and the pergola, stooping,
on silent feet, the little Scout slipped back to the hydrant, made
sure that it was wide open, dropped the drum, and picked up the
nozzle of the hose that operated with the pressure of water carried
at such force as a running current flowing through pipes large
enough to motor on with a small automobile and carried in many
places straight down mountain-sides, would attain.</p>

<p>The hose twisted as if it were a living thing, and the little
Scout eased off the hydrant a trifle in the fear that the hose
might burst.</p>

<p>The interloper hurried down the back walk as fast as her feet
would carry her over its winding and precipitous way and dumped the
contents of the basket into the incinerator. On top of it the
precious papers were thrown and then the match was scratched and
held a second to make sure that it was blazing before the papers
were touched off at the top. As the hand holding the match reached
toward the papers, a stream of water that shook the incinerator on
its base struck it and began speedily soaking its entire contents
and a shrill voice, keyed to the top note of wild excitement,
shouted: "Look you careful there! You've got swarming bees on each
side of you! You'll be stung to death in just about one minute,
'cause God knows <i>your</i> scent ain't <i>right!</i>"</p>

<p>How much Miss Worthington knew about bees was debatable. One
thing the little Scout recognized: She knew enough about them to be
afraid. She looked to the right and then to the left and decided
she would risk it, though the bees were coming closer.</p>

<p>"Turn off that hose!" she shouted. "Turn off that hose!"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" retorted the little Scout. "You ain't
a-goin' to burn up those papers! They don't belong to you. Don't
you touch 'em! Don't you touch one of 'em! If you do, I'll hit you
with this hose until I knock you spang into the nearest of the bees
behind you! You don't know mountain water pressure, but I can do
it!"</p>

<p>"Turn off that hose!" cried the young woman, clinging to the
side of the incinerator and looking with bulging eyes at the two
swarms of bees milling so alarmingly near, looking up at the air
above her gradually filling with the roaring wings of bees scenting
something they did not like, bees already nervous with the strain
of leaving the hive in which they had been reared and following
their queen to a new location.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?" cried Miss Worthington.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying," shouted the Scout Master. "I'm doing! I'm
going to have the truth out of you or I'm going to set two swarms
of bees on you, and they will sting you until you are the deadest
of anybody that ever went dead, just the horrid way you ought to go
to pay for little Mary. I know you! I've seen your picture! You've
got it there in that incinerator. You ain't the Bee Master's
daughter any more than you are mine! Your mother had you when she
vamped him into marrying her. You are trying to play you are Mary.
You are trying to cheat to get this yet. See 'em closing in on you.
See 'em coming closer! Hear 'em roar!"</p>

<p>The terrified girl looked on every side of her. Escape was cut
off to the rear, the roaring hose was menacing her in front. If she
left the incinerator with the papers she had consigned to it
unburned, there was to be effective. She must get the papers or be
defeated. But the little fiend at the end of that roaring</p>

<p>hose&mdash;Resolutely she bent over the incinerator and began
with shaking hands to gather up the papers. In that instant the
little Scout trained the hose, running full force, squarely in the
back of the hives of Black Germans, trained it and so held it that
they rocked on their foundations and there came pouring from them
in distracted hosts the vilest tempered bees that the history of
beekeeping ever has known. The object most prominently in front of
them was the smoking incinerator and the taint that was carried on
the air, the most maddening taint that their experience knew, was
the taint of the human being exhaling from every pore the odour of
formic acid&mdash;the odour of fear. The Black Germans began to
rise with a roar. The little Scout set the water tap wide open and
manipulated the hose nozzle to its full strength and watched it
beat a hole into a bed of marigolds, tearing them out of the earth.
And above the roar of the bees, and above the rush of the water,
the voice that matched the face that Jamie had seen the night
before, the voice of a small pagan intent on wreaking justice,
carried high and shrill: "Now you are surrounded! Now you got 'em
on three sides! Now you got 'em all around you! Now you'll
<i>get</i> it! I'll give you just one chance! Drop those
papers!"</p>

<p>The girl looked up. Within a few yards of her roared the
Italians on one hand. At her back another swarm was even closer,
and down on her from the front came the Black Germans.</p>

<p>"Turn that hose on me!" she shrieked. "Cover me with water! Beat
'em off with it!"</p>

<p>Then the little Scout stepped out in full view on tiptoes and
kept the hose precisely where it was.</p>

<p>"Turn that hose on our bees, nice innocent bees, tending to
their own business, making sweets to feed the world? Them bees is
<i>friends</i> of mine! I'm the Bee Master's partner. Half of this
place he gave to me. You think you are going to steal it! You think
you are going to burn his papers! Come clean now, or the bees will
get you, and it will not be five minutes until you'll be deader,
you'll be deader than any liar or anything ever was before! Look
out! They are in front of you! Come clean! Say you ain't the Bee
Master's daughter!"</p>

<p>Clinging to the incinerator, the girl cast a terrified glance
around her. She was in a circle of bees and she had heard of Black
Germans. She knew them when she saw them. There had been bee
gardens in her childhood when she had been an inmate of the home of
the Bee Master. She screamed at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"Stop your noise," said the Scout Master. "Come clean, I say,
come clean! Say 'Michael Worthington was not my father.'"</p>

<p>At that instant the first Black German hit its victim on the
head not far from the right ear and went into execution.</p>

<p>"No! No!" shrieked the girl. "He wasn't my father!"</p>

<p>"Say you are trying to steal this place and you've got no right
to it," said the little Scout.</p>

<p>The girl righted herself and tried to take a step forward.
Another Black German hit her squarely on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" she cried. "I am trying to steal it! I have got no
right to it!"</p>

<p>"Um-huh!" said the little Scout. "Now say you are trying to burn
those papers to get rid of all the evidence that would keep you
from being the thief you are trying to be! Say it, and say it damn
quick!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" panted the tortured girl. "I'll say any thing! For
God's sake, turn that hose on me. Clear a way through! Quick!
Quick, or you will be too late!"</p>

<p>"You will tell the truth about one thing more first," said the
little Scout.</p>

<p>At that minute the boiling hose was beating a hole big enough to
have drowned a calf right in the marigold bed. The little Scout
danced from one foot to the other, hanging to it with all the
strength of a pair of unbelievably tough young arms.</p>

<p>"Tell the truth about little Mary yet! Say you <i>pushed</i>
her! I know you did. The Bee Master knew you did, but he couldn't
prove it. I'll let 'em sting the everlastin' liver out of you if
you don't tell the truth about that yet!"</p>

<p>The third German got in its work in the tender muscles close to
an eye.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" panted the shrinking creature. "Yes! The hose for
God's sake! Turn the hose on me!"</p>

<p>"Drop flat on the ground!" shouted the Scout Master. "Get on
your belly and crawl! Crawl like the <i>worm</i> you are! I won't
turn the hose on our bees. Get down, Nebuchadnezzar, get on your
belly and eat grass! Eat dirt, for all I care! Then you can start
inchin'! You can start inchin' along like a poor inch worm! Head
for me and I'll juice you up enough that they'll not get you! Turn
the hose on my <i>friends</i>, I guess not! Hold your nose! It's
going to snow!"</p>

<p>Full force the hose struck the miserable object grovelling on
the ground, struck her, played over her and knocked a few bees that
were flying low out of the way. A pitiful creature came crawling up
the mountain, gasping for breath, one eye slowly closing, the pain
of three stings on the head almost unbearable torture, bees by the
thousand roaring above her. Slowly the little Scout backed up the
mountain, dragging the twisting hose, pausing every few seconds to
play it again on the victim. By and by, sufficient distance was
reached to permit an armistice.</p>

<p>"Now you stop right where you are!" commanded the Scout Master,
with a deft twirl cutting down the water. "Stop right where you
are!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the girl, struggling to her knees. "I'll not stop
where I am! I'll get you and I'll wring the head right off of your
neck. You little Devil! You vile little Devil!"</p>

<p>Flip went the nozzle, spang came the water squarely on the
girl's head and shoulders. Down she went.</p>

<p>"So that's how you feel about it? That's the way you thank me
for savin' you, all lyin' and stealin' like you are! You didn't
know I could magic bees, did you? You didn't know I could run
around on the other side of them and spray 'em gentle until I'd
drive 'em on you, did you? You didn't know I got a better trick
than that up my sleeve yet, did you?"</p>

<p>Once more the girl raised halfway to her knees, and once more
the hose came roaring threateningly near.</p>

<p>"Now you pause," said the little Scout, "pause in your mad
career edzackly where you <i>are</i> until you get me
<i>right</i>."</p>

<p>From the soiled string around the neck of the little Scout the
police whistle came into play. In reply to its shrill note there
burst from behind the lilac bush, from behind the poinsettias, from
behind the plumbago three wild-eyed, wildly dancing young fiends
tuned by what they had seen to the spirit of battle.</p>

<p>The Scout Master stuck the police whistle in the front of a
soiled blouse.</p>

<p>"Scout One!" came the terse order, and Fat Ole Bill drew up and
saluted.</p>

<p>"Scout Two!"</p>

<p>The Nice Child bounded into place.</p>

<p>"Scout Three!"</p>

<p>Angel Face ranged in line.</p>

<p>"Scout Three," said the Scout Master, "get a-hold of this hose!
It's about wiggled the wind out of me. Help me train it close to
the head of the young lady doing her devotions in our presence. My
neck's going to be wrung. 'I shall holler for assistance. I shall
meet her with resistance!'"</p>

<p>"Yes, your neck's goin' to be wrung!" puffed Fat Ole Bill. "Yes,
your neck's goin' to be wrung! Let her try it! Let her try it! What
will she get, fellers?"</p>

<p>In unison the Scouts shouted: "The Limit!"</p>

<p>It was at that instant that the police whistle and the commotion
awakened Jamie, and it was an instant later, as he came around
Margaret Cameron's house from the back, that he met John Carey
coming around it from the front.</p>

<p>He said to him: "There's something going on over in the bee
garden. I think maybe the Scouts are having a sham battle. Keep
behind the bushes and follow me. You might be interested in what
you see and hear. Sometimes it gets good!"</p>

<p>So the two men slipped through the gate, and under cover of the
shrubs and bushes, came down very close to the flower wall behind
the jacqueranda, where they paused.</p>

<p>"Scout One!" commanded the Scout Master, "tell it to the probate
judge. Did you hear the witness before you say that she was a
liar?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell the world I did! And she said she stole the papers,
and she was tryin' to burn 'em so she could steal this garden. You
bet I'll tell the judge!"</p>

<p>"Scout Two!" said the Scout Master, and Jamie and John Carey,
with eyes as wide as the eyes of the youngsters, leaned forward and
peered through the bushes.</p>

<p>"Sure! Sure I heard her!" said Angel Face. "Sure I heard her say
she lied, and she was trying to steal this place and she pushed
little Mary. Sure I heard her! Sure we saw you sic the bees on her!
Sure we saw 'em ping her on the dome! Sure we know she got what was
comin' to her! Sure we'll tell the judge!"</p>

<p>"Scout Three," said the Scout Master. "What are <i>you</i> good
for? Pit it in Mamma's hand!"</p>

<p>In the excitement the hose was yielded to the manipulations of
Scout Three and he had all he could do to manage it. The little
Scout reached over and lowered the pressure.</p>

<p>"Same as the rest. Everything. From start to finish I heard it
all. Sure I can. All about the lies. All about the stealing. All
about the little girl she pushed. Sure I can tell any old
judge!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master rocked from heel to toe and bent up and down
and cupped a hand over each bony knee and emitted a war cry that
would have reached fairly well around the circle of the globe had
it been properly delivered into a rightly tuned radio
transmitter.</p>

<p>"And I'll tell the world what the Bee Master told me, and the
stuff in the incinerator is <i>safe</i>, with three swarms of bees
standing guard, and if four of us can't handle you, I know where to
get somebody that can! Get up, worm. Get up, liar! Get up, thief!
Get up, you nasty thing! Get on to your feet! Scout One, go to the
telephone and call 0075. Call the taxi the Bee Master and I always
take to come here quick. Scout Two, stay with Scout Three. Scout
Three, you keep the hose right where you got it. If she moves let
her have all of it. Don't be skimpy. The lady doesn't like
California; it's too rough. So she wants me to pack her trunk.
Excuse me!" and the Scout Master disappeared into the home of the
Bee Master.</p>

<p>When the telephoning was finished, between Scout One and the
Scout Master, the steamer trunk was dragged to the middle of the
living room and the clothing of the interloper was thrown into it.
Off Jamie's dresser the toilet articles were swept into the toilet
case. A hat and coat were snatched from the closet and the
travelling paraphernalia was dragged on to the front porch, and
with wide eyes behind a wall of honeysuckle, Jamie MacFarlane and
John Carey stood half paralyzed and watched the proceedings.</p>

<p>Sooner than they would have believed, the taxi drew up at the
gate and the Scout Master stepping like a half-drunken dandy doing
an Irish reel, with a swagger and a sweep from side to side, and
arms set akimbo when the hands were not busy distributing elaborate
gestures on the atmosphere gave the command: "Put that trunk up on
the seat beside you. Put that suitcase and that dressing bag in
back. I'll direct this picture just like my dad directs in the big
studio. Mr. Taxi-man, take this coat and put it on the lady and
take this hat and put it on her, and put your arm around her and if
she can't walk, carry her out and put her in the taxi. Take your
taxi right down to the Santa Fe Station and if she needs help, help
her get a ticket to any place in Pennsylvania she says she is going
and be darned quick about it into the bargain!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master stood still until the taxi disappeared, then
turned and said: "Scouts, I thank you! I'm off for to-day. I got
business, but I'll not forget that it's my treat and I'll make it a
double header! I'll tell the world I'll make it a humdinger. A
dollar won't touch it. And don't a one of you <i>forget</i> a word
of what you've <i>heard</i> or what you've <i>seen</i>. There's a
slim chance that this may be the real thing. There's just a chance
that you go to court and tell it to the probate judge like I said,
but just for this minute, I'm through with you and I want you to
disband and speed. I'll settle your score to-morrow and you can all
step mighty high, 'cause this day there ain't been no make-believe.
You been Scouts, and you been <i>real</i> Scouts what's done a
<i>real</i> job, and done it up brown! They's just one thing.
Remember your sakerd oaths. Remember your vitals and all that.
Remember if you <i>tell</i>, you'll be cut an' cast. Take my
blessing and disband. And, Scout Three, if you would run down and
turn off the hydrant before you go, I'd be glad, 'cause I don't
care if I tell you fellows, that this has been <i>some</i>
skirmish, and I'm all in! Now furnish your own music an' march to
it."</p>

<p>The Scout Master stood straight, watching the gate and down the
road until Scout Three and Scout Two, and Fat Ole Bill bringing up
the rear, all gesticulating, all talking at once, disappeared.
Then, headlong, the little Scout fell face down in the dirt and
began to cry right out loud, sobbing, shuddering, shrill little
screaming terrified cries that broke Jamie's heart, and he tore
through the honeysuckles and gathered the little Scout up in his
arms and sat down on the bench under the jacqueranda and held his
small burden tight and rained uncounted kisses all over the little
face and head.</p>

<p>The tongue of a Scotsman is usually rather stiff, but in that
tense instant Jamie's ran away with him.</p>

<p>"You little thing!" he said. "You brave little thing! You've
done it. You've saved the Bee Master's gift for us. John Carey was
with me back there and both of us saw and heard enough to send that
woman to the penitentiary. So don't you cry any more! Let me hold
you tight and rest a minute. It was a big strain. It was too much
for you, you poor little darling!"</p>

<p>Just for an instant Jamie thought the burden in his arms was
going to spring entirely from him, the stiffening and the
straightening were so abrupt.</p>

<p>"'Little darlin'!'" scoffed the Scout Master. "'Little darlin'!
Next thing I reckon you'll be callin' me 'Kiddo'! That's what she
called me. If anybody ever calls me 'Kiddo' in all this world
again, I'll kick their teeth in! That's that!"</p>

<p>The Scout Master hunted for something that would be good to dry
eyes on, and failing to find it, sat very still while Jamie used
his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are goin' to do with me," gulped the
little Scout. "I reckon I've just about wrecked the marigold bed,
and it was on <i>your</i> side of the line."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind the marigolds," said Jamie. "We can make up
the bed and sow some more seed. Never mind the marigolds! Tell me
what happened."</p>

<p>"It was just all I could do," said the Scout Master, "to handle
that hose when I had it turned on full and I was scared of my life
it would bust. It just wriggled and twisted like a snake, and I had
to keep it close to her be cause, if they really began to close in,
I <i>had</i> to beat 'em off, but I wasn't goin' to do it for
pinging on the bean only <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> times, 'cause
she <i>had</i> to be hurt <i>some</i> or she wouldn't 've come
clean. I wouldn't have minded if it had 'a' been on my own side,
but I hated awfully to tear up yours. You can take the hose right
now and go over to my side and beat up a hole just as big as I tore
up on yours."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," said Jamie. "A head as level as yours usually
is! How would it help me in getting back my marigold bed to tear up
a hole as big as that on your land? It wouldn't be sensible."</p>

<p>The little Scout thought it over, then looked up at Jamie with
wide, tired eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I can see how it would be <i>just</i>," came the
reply.</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Jamie, "but justice and good hard common sense
don't always agree."</p>

<p>Suddenly the little Scout brightened.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, you aren't the only one that got some ruination
worked on you. Look what she went an' did to the Queen's chest!
Just go in and look what she went and did to <i>my</i>
property!"</p>

<p>"To the 'Queen's chest'?" said Jamie. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" cried the little Scout. "I mean she had been
to the shed before you locked it up, an' got the ax, and she had it
hid in the house. She broke open the Queen's chest prying it with
the ax."</p>

<p>"Oh, boy!" said Jamie, "that's rough! But don't you feel bad.
I'll have it repaired so you will never know the difference if I
have to have the whole front reproduced."</p>

<p>"She busted the top around the lock and where the secret spring
went," said the little Scout. "The thing about it is that I don't
<i>like</i> things smashed and patched up. I like 'em when they're
whole and the way you got 'em give to you by one you love."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you mind," said Jamie. "There couldn't have been
anything new about that chest. I think it must have been about five
hundred years old to begin with, and anyway, people can do things
so wonderfully these days in such repair work. If it's only around
the lock, I'm sure we can get it fixed so nobody will ever know
it."</p>

<p>The little Scout used Jamie's handkerchief on a pair of red
eyes.</p>

<p>"All right, then," the assent came with one of the youngster's
lightning changes. "All right, then. We'll get it fixed, but we
didn't need a patched chest to remember her by. We got the whole
garden for a souvenir of that lady!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the little Scout began to laugh.</p>

<p>"My! didn't she look wonderful when the taxi man put her hat and
coat on her? Wasn't she a spiffy lady? I wonder, if Nannette had
seen her, if she would have said she looked keen?"</p>

<p>Jamie roared.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't think Nannette's favourite adjective
would have worked. I don't think even she would have thought the
lady on her departure looked keen."</p>

<p>"She'll have to make a straight shot for the dressing room,"
said the little Scout, "and put on her war paint and feathers the
best she can."</p>

<p>"Do you really think she will go?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>The little Scout heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't give two Apache war whoops whether she goes or whether
she stays. The pony I'm bettin' my money on in this race is one
that tells me that that lady ain't ever comin' back to the Sierra
Madre Apiary. She's had her dose of treat 'em rough, and I bet she
ain't weepin' for more, not a mountain pressure hose, nor Black
Germans in the eye, nor nothin'! She got her share, if I did have
to tear up your marigolds to give it to her!"</p>

<p>"For goodness sake! don't worry about a hole as big as a wash
tub when you have just got through saving me an acre!"</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the Scout Master. "If <i>that's</i> the
way you feel about it, it suits me. Do you mind if I just fool
around a little while?"</p>

<p>Jamie knew what that meant. It meant that his little partner
would go and creep up on the foot of his bed and fall sound asleep,
and he thought that would be the best thing that could possibly
happen. So he said he did not mind in the least because he and John
Carey were going back to hive the bees. The Scout Master slid to
the ground. Suddenly Jamie felt a pair of small, wiry arms around
his neck that hugged him up so tight that he did not know but that
his head was going to be amputated. Then for the third time,
squarely on his mouth, he got another little hard, hot kiss of a
brand and delivery that he knew he was never going to forget.</p>

<p>The little Scout started toward the house, but only a few yards
had been covered before there was a halt, and the small person
whirled. "Quick! How goofy! We forgot the incinerator! There's
Highland Mary and little Mary and all the valuable papers soaking
in the ashes and maybe some fire under them! You got to get 'em
quick, if I have to turn the hose on you while you're doin' it!
Whatever it was she wanted to burn up so bad, why that's edzackly
what we must have to prove that what's give us is ours. You can't
tell it to the probate judge very good without the papers in the
incinerator, and it doesn't seem as if you'd be placid enough to
tackle the incinerator right now without riskin' a mixshure of
Black Germans and Italians&mdash;an' Germans can shoot
straight!"</p>

<p>"You go on to your fooling around," said Jamie. "I'll jump into
the bee clothes. Maybe I'll put the old rain coat over them, and I
may take the bee mask, since things are so stirred up, but don't
you worry, I'll reach the incinerator and I'll get everything in
it. I'll not stop to hive the bees until everything is on the
kitchen table and spread out to dry."</p>

<p>Jamie raced to the back porch to prepare himself, and, as he
rounded the corner of the house, John Carey came walking up the
back steps trailing ashes in his wake, and set the incinerator on
the back porch.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd better get this and start the stuff to drying
out. I didn't want the job of taking anything out for fear
something might be lost or missing. I want you to do that
yourself."</p>

<p>So Jamie stepped to the living-room door and called in: "John
Carey has gotten the incinerator for us. He's a right real bee
immune!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell the world he is," came the voice of the little Scout,
but it sounded muffled as if it were coming from fairly deep in a
pillow.</p>

<p>The two men gathered up some soft towels and, working swiftly,
dried the documents, the bank books, the valuable papers, the
letters and the pictures that they found, and spread them on the
kitchen table. Then they hurried to the shed to arrange new hives
for the swarming bees. By the time they reached them, the two
swarms that had gone out were weighting down the branches around
their queens and only needed a slight smoking to numb them so that
their transference to the hives could be easily managed. As for the
Black Germans, they were still nervous, but they were a distance
away, the hot sun was rapidly drying the water around their hives,
the roar of the hose had ceased, the scent they disliked had been
removed, and so they were calming down as speedily as might have
been expected of bees of their irritable temperament.</p>

<p>As they worked, the two men talked to each other, breathless
exchanges, exclamations mostly. What a listener would have heard,
ran like this:</p>

<p>"Can you beat it! That little Scout tackled her single-handed
and made her come clean! I'd give a fifty-dollar bill to have seen
the whole show!"</p>

<p>This from John Carey.</p>

<p>"Wager it would have been worth more," from Jamie.</p>

<p>"Chances are you've been saved a lawsuit that might have dragged
for months and cost a lot of money and made a lot of rotten
publicity."</p>

<p>"When we get these bees up, I'll go over to Margaret Cameron's
and straighten everything up and bring home my stuff. I was going
to camp there until Margaret got back."</p>

<p>"You were a fool ever to have allowed that creature inside the
house, to have walked out and turned things over to her!"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled, a slow Scot smile.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "we are no so verra well acquainted with
ourselves in this world. I thought I had not earned this property;
I thought I had no right to it; I thought it belonged to someone of
blood kin; I thought I had not set my heart on it, and when I had
walked out and started trying to give it up, I found it was almost
going to kill me to do it. You can trust me, there'll not be any
more walking out for anybody, and that's that!"</p>

<p>So they hived the bees that had swarmed, and went over the other
hives to clip old queens and destroy queen cells and to search for
moth webs on the comb, and when everything was in proper shape John
Carey went home, and Jamie took a shovel and commenced repairing
the damage to the marigold bed. After that, he went over and
cleaned up Margaret Cameron's house and brought home his belongings
with a heart so full of thankfulness that he remembered to go on
his knees and thank God.</p>

<p>When the little Scout awoke in mid-afternoon, Jamie was waiting
to return his possessions to the chiffonier and closet. They went
into the kitchen and gathered up the Bee Master's effects which the
crisp, dry air had done its work upon, carefully returned them to
the chest, pushed the splintered wood into place, and took stock of
the dam ages. Jamie thought he could find a man who could make the
repairs skilfully so that no one ever would know that the beautiful
thing had been broken. Then he went to his room to hang up his
clothing and replace his things in the chiffonier.</p>

<p>No one had ever known the little Scout Master to waste very much
time. There were no lazy bones in the small body. Jamie had
assistance in folding the papers and putting them in the chest. He
was now being assisted in returning his shirts, underclothing, and
socks to their proper places. When they came to a small package,
carefully pinned, the Scout Master ran a pair of small hands under
it and lifted it, then looked at Jamie with speculative eyes.</p>

<p>"Feels like woman's stuff."</p>

<p>Jamie smiled at that comment.</p>

<p>"It is 'woman's stuff.' It's things that belonged to wee Jamie's
mother."</p>

<p>The little Scout stood very still holding the package toward
Jamie, and Jamie saw the lips open and he knew that the question
was going to be: "May I see?" And someway, he did not feel that he
could stand to touch those things. So he reached his hand and said
quickly: "Some day I'll let you see what's in that package." It did
not occur to the little Scout that Jamie did not know what was in
it himself. So they put the package back in the drawer and covered
it with clothing, and then they went down to the corner grocery and
bought what the little Scout called a "party."</p>

<p>After they had finished the "party," and Jamie had been told
every detail of what had occurred in the morning, the little Scout
arose from the table and helped to put away the food and wiped the
dishes.</p>

<p>"Now, what shall we do?" inquired Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what you're going to do," said the small
person, "but I know what I'm going to do. I'm going home to Mom and
Jamie. I been taking care of him so much the last few days that he
knows me better than he does anybody else, and he likes me better.
I know how to fix his bottle now and get his milk just right with
the thermometer and everything. The rest of the way I could take
care of him myself if I had to. I'm pretty near doing it
anyway."</p>

<p>"But that's girl's work," suggested Jamie.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said the little Scout, "and if it's what a girl
really ought to do, it's kind of funny that I'd want to do it, but
I <i>do</i> want to take care of Jamie. I want to take care of him
so bad I can't hardly bear to see Mother touch him. It's the
funniest thing. I thought I liked a horse better than anything else
in the world, but I don't. I like our Jimmy better than any horse,
and I like your Jamie about as well as I do ours. I don't know but
<i>just</i> as well, and I don't care a bit who sees me takin' care
of him. And that's strange, too. Girls don't interest me. I have
nothing in common with them. I never can think of anything to say
to them. I don't know how to play with them, and I don't like the
things they do, anyway. They're so sissy. They got no pep to 'em.
They got no kick and bang. They won't play Indians or robbers or
policeman or Scouts."</p>

<p>"Now, back up there," said Jamie. "You're mistaken. Girls
<i>do</i> play Scouts. They not only play Scouts, but they
<i>are</i> Scouts, and <i>being</i> is better than
<i>pretending</i> any day. There are Girl Scout camps and there are
girls that can ride hard and shoot straight and fish and do every
thing that a boy does, and do some things even better than a boy
does and are all the prouder because they are girls."</p>

<p>The little Scout did not seem deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"Aw, girls! I ain't got any use for girls! But I'm going home
and take a girl's job 'cause I'm going to see for myself that
Jamie's all right. He's so little and sweet. My! you're goin' to
love him! My! you're goin' to be <i>glad</i> you got him!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"Sure you are! You ought to see my dad with our Jimmy. He's just
crazy about him. He says that our Jimmy has got all the rest of the
babies on the map lashed to the mast."</p>

<p>"And you think my Jamie stands a chance of being as fine a baby
as that?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it," said the little Scout. "I'm
well acquainted with both of 'em and there ain't a thing the matter
with your Jamie. He don't cry and he's no fusser. He just takes his
food and goes to sleep and lies there so little and so still it
most breaks your heart 'cause he can't help himself any, and no
mother to cuddle him. He's got some service due him and I'm going
to see that he <i>gets</i> it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought about that, too," said Jamie. "He's certainly a
helpless little duffer."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," agreed the Scout Master, heartily. "He's a
helpless little duffer. And that's where we come in, and so we got
to get on the job and take care of him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, "we'll get on the job and take care of
him. Do the best you can for a few days more until Margaret Cameron
comes."</p>

<p>At the mention of Margaret Cameron they both looked her way, and
at the same time they both saw her going in her back door and
moving through the back part of the house.</p>

<p>"Why, there she is now!" cried the little Scout. "Shall I go
over and tell her about Jamie and ask her if she will take
him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie, "let's give her time to take her hat off and
set her house in order, and maybe what I consider straight, she
wouldn't think was straight. Some time this evening I'll talk with
her, and then I'll telephone you what she says."</p>

<p>"All right," said the little Scout.</p>

<p>Possibly in those two words lay the secret of the thing that
made the little Scout so many friends; such an adorable little
Scout. In the small person's cosmos there was no time to argue. In
training the Scouts the same teaching had been applied to personal
experience. The Scout Master had learned how to obey. So Jamie
watched the receding figure on the way to the car line, willing in
one instance to take a girl's job, because the "little duffer was
so helpless." Jamie smiled whimsically and started to interview
Margaret Cameron.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19. The Province of a
Friend</h2>

<p>Jamie stood in Margaret Cameron's back door and called
cheerfully: "Oh, neighbour, where have you been for the past fifty
years?"</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron stepped to the living-room door and braced
herself with a hand on each side of the casing, and Jamie was
shocked to the depths. He found himself crossing the room in a
sweep and catching her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret!" he cried. "Margaret!"</p>

<p>He held her from him and looked at her, and her face was the
face of a stricken woman. She was there. She seemed all right
herself. There was only one thing to think.</p>

<p>"Lolly?" he questioned. "What happened to your girl?"</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron opened her mouth but no words came. Jamie
helped her to a chair and rushed to the kitchen for a glass of
water. Then he knelt on one knee beside her and took both her hands
and stared at her with questioning eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me, friend of mine," he urged. "Tell me what I can do for
you. Where can I go? Whom can I get?"</p>

<p>Slowly the woman shook her head, and at last her voice came, a
hoarse, rasping voice with which he was not familiar.</p>

<p>"She went on that hiking trip up in the northern part of the
state. She fell over a bluff and hurt herself terribly. Nobody knew
how bad it was. They were where they couldn't get anything. It must
have been appendicitis or peritonitis. Her body was all bandaged.
Anyway, Lolly is beside her father out in Pinehurst Cemetery."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Jamie. "Oh!"</p>

<p>He dropped back on his heels and possessed himself of both
Margaret Cameron's hands and sat staring at her.</p>

<p>"I had a 'phone call," she said presently, "from my niece,
Molly, to come to her place in town quick, that she was worried
about Lolly. She just said that to make it easier for me to get
there. They must have sent her word from the start that Lolly was
gone. Molly had written her a letter and they got the address off
it and sent Lolly to her. They were always, not like sisters, more
than sisters. If they had been sisters, they'd not have gotten
along half so well as they did. I've been kind of sore at Molly for
a good while. I thought she had a good deal to do with Lolly going
away, but maybe she didn't. Maybe I was so hurt at her going that I
just imagined it. You know, a mother has got a lot of time to think
and her children are so bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh
that to save her she can't help worrying over them. But I needn't
worry over Lolly any more. There's nothing more I am ever going to
do for her."</p>

<p>She sat still in dry-eyed resignation.</p>

<p>Jamie gripped her hands.</p>

<p>"Go on and cry! Cry your heart out about it!" he said. "Put your
head over here on my shoulder and let me hold you tight. If it
tears you to pieces, you had better cry than to sit dry eyed like
that."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think I am cut too deep for tears," she said. "I am just
about killed. I wish to God I had something to do besides the
routine of the house, something different, somebody who needed me!
I wanted Molly to come home with me, but she seemed to have things
keeping her in town, and she wanted me to come with her, and awful
as it seems here now that Lolly is never going to come again, I
don't seem to be able even to think about leaving. I am hit pretty
hard, losing my neighbour and all the light of love and laughter
that there was in my life and in my home. I don't mind telling you,
Jamie, that the Bee Master did not care anything about me. His
heart had been broken on the question of women.</p>

<p>"I don't know all the details, but I know this much. He had had
a first wife that he idolized, and after her death he had let
another woman fool him into the idea that she would take care of
his child and make a home for him and comfort him. But she wasn't
the right kind of a woman and she had a child of her own, and there
was a tragedy about the Bee Master's little girl. I don't think he
could prove it, but I think he knew in his heart that the other
child had pushed her, and when they got to her, her spine was
injured and she never could walk again. Her agony was fearful and
she couldn't stand it long. When she died, he turned everything
over to the woman but enough to buy this place, and asked the
courts for his freedom and came here. He was free and he could have
married me, but he did not want me. He did not want any woman in
that way. He had had his punishment. He was worn out with sorrow
and disappointment. He didn't love me, but, oh! Jamie! I did love
him! I couldn't help loving him. Whenever I look at his chair
beside the fireplace, I see his white, silken hair, his noble
forehead, his lean slender face fine as parchment, always gentle,
always patient&mdash;I would have given my life to have comforted
him! And just when I knew this couldn't ever be, Lolly went, so
suddenly and so needlessly.</p>

<p>"Jamie, I <i>can't</i> understand it! There was no reason why
she should have left home. Her grades were always good. Her school
work was fine. She was offered positions here at the close of the
war, when teachers were so scarce, when so many girls preferred the
freedom of the shops and offices to the confinement of teaching. I
can't get away from the fact that she went because she didn't
<i>want</i> to stay at home. She didn't want to be around me, and I
can't see why. I spent my days and I lay awake at night trying to
think of things that would please her, but I couldn't keep up with
the procession. I can't think that a lot of things the youngsters
are doing are right. I can't think that they won't end in
humiliation and pain and maybe death, and now death's come to her
just from a little foolish accident. She must have slipped on the
mountains, and I can't understand that. She was sure-footed as a
goat. She'd been in the mountains all her life. Oh, Jamie, it's all
so useless. What am I going to do?"</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated.</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "I came over here to tell you a tale of
woe, but what I have to say seems feeble compared to what you are
enduring."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron straightened in her chair. She drew her hands
from Jamie's and laid one of them on his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, my boy, my poor boy!" she cried. "Has that awful thing gone
and broken open again? Have we got it all to do over?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" Jamie hastened to assure her. "No, it isn't that. My
side's fine. I'm fairly sure I won't have to wear either the pads
or bandages more than two or three months more. I haven't been able
to stick to diet so well since you've been gone because I'm not
much of a cook and I haven't been places where I could get what I
needed."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron went on smoothing his hair.</p>

<p>"I guess you're about all that's left to me, Jamie," she said.
"I guess you are my job. It's fair hell to stay at home, and it's
blacker hell to try to leave it. I doubt if I can go to Molly. If
she wants to be with me, I guess she will have to come here. And as
for you, lad, if it isn't your side, what is it that's hurting
you?"</p>

<p>With Scot brevity Jamie told her.</p>

<p>"About the time I came here I married a girl. A few days ago her
baby was born at the Star of Mercy Hospital and she was not strong
enough to make it. All I have to show for her is the baby."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron pushed him back and looked at him quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, Jamie," she said, "Jamie, I can't understand that. Why
didn't you bring her here to the garden? Why didn't you let me take
care of her, too? Maybe if her diet had been right and she had been
cared for as a woman can care for a girl, maybe it wouldn't have
happened."</p>

<p>"'Maybes' don't do any good now," said Jamie. "The circumstances
were such that I couldn't bring her here. The point is that she is
gone and there is a splendid boy baby and his name is James Lewis
MacFarlane, Junior."</p>

<p>"At the hospital? He's at the hospital?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jamie. "She'd told them before I got there that she
wanted me to have him, that she wanted him named for me. They had
him all ready and they put him in my arms and without knowing what
I was going to do, I walked out with him. I am the same kind of a
dog that you are, Margaret. I came home, to the only place I've
got, to the only place on earth that knows me or wants me. It
hasn't been long, but as long as I live, this spot right here is
home to me. So I came home with a little raw, new-born baby."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron arose.</p>

<p>"You have him over at the house?" she asked. "<i>You're</i>
trying to take care of him yourself?"</p>

<p>Jamie shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't do that," he said. "I'm too big and clumsy. I
don't know enough. The little Scout was there and went to the
telephone and had a conversation and half an hour later Mrs.
Meredith came. She has a small person of her own and it seems that
one more didn't bother her."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron made a curious sound, a dry intake of breath
which might have been a short laugh if she had not been too unhappy
to laugh.</p>

<p>"No," she said, tersely, "one more doesn't bother that woman!
I've heard about her. At the birth of her first child, there was a
charity baby and a little millionaire baby at the same hospital and
both of them were starving, and for the length of time she was
there, along with her own baby she nursed the others and she saved
both of them. She got them past a critical period where they could
take proper nourishment and retain it, and then they could go on
feeding them. And when her next baby came, there were a couple more
starving babies and she took them under her wing and shared the
nourishment for her own baby with them. And when her third one came
there had been a Caesarean operation a few days before and the baby
lived and there was no milk for it, and she nursed it as well as
her own. Mrs. Meredith doesn't stick at doing anything for any
baby, that you can depend on. It isn't hard to see where the little
Scout gets a large bunch of lovable qualities, but if she's got a
little person of her own she doesn't need yours. Maybe that's the
job that I was looking for. Maybe something alive that will put in
a demand will be the thing that will tide me over. Go and get your
baby, Jamie, and bring him to me."</p>

<p>Jamie arose and went to the telephone. He called Mrs. Meredith
and asked to have the baby brought home. Margaret Cameron had
returned and was willing to under take his care. In only a short
time a small brown car appeared down the street. Jamie stood at the
gate and watched it coming. The car was the colour of the hair of
the woman who drove it. Her eyes, wide and bright, shone out
smilingly. On the front seat beside her sat the little Scout,
carefully holding the bundle. Jamie looked at it curiously and
wondered what he would think and what he would feel if that child
were truly his.</p>

<p>In an effort to spare Margaret Cameron he stretched his arms for
the baby, but Mrs. Meredith was a genial person. She had to deliver
the baby herself. She had to spread out his wardrobe and explain
how she had used things. She was dubious as to whether Margaret
Cameron, who had not had a baby in more than twenty years, was
going to know enough to oil a baby and put the right kind of
clothing on it and handle it properly in the present year of our
Lord. Twenty years is a long stretch, and science figures out
numerous things in that length of time. She was so full of good
nature, so full of high spirits, so pleased with herself for having
taken care of the baby until Margaret Cameron came, that she did
not notice the white, drawn face of the woman, a woman whom she
scarcely knew to begin with. She shocked Margaret's old-fashioned
soul by putting into her arms a baby that was wearing no flannel,
whose feet were bare and kicking, whose dress was no longer than
the feet. It seemed to Margaret Cameron the only thing Mrs.
Meredith did that had been done to old-fashioned babies was to
watch that the little eyes were screened, that strong lights did
not penetrate.</p>

<p>Margaret lifted her voice in protest.</p>

<p>"Where are his flannels?" she said, and Mrs. Meredith spread a
pair of expressive hands in a gesture that both Margaret and Jamie
recognized immediately.</p>

<p>"There ain't going to be no flannels!" she laughingly quoted.
"California babies have graduated from flannel. It's too hot for
them and chafes their delicate skins and makes them fret and
cry."</p>

<p>Then she sat down on the davenport and opened up the baby basket
she had brought and displayed the implements she used in the
morning toilet of James Lewis MacFarlane, Junior.</p>

<p>Margaret sat and stared. She listened to what was said. She
watched what was done. She looked the baby over and then slowly
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Jamie," she said, "if I take this child and try to take care of
him in this way and he dies, are you going to hold it against
me?"</p>

<p>Jamie and Mrs. Meredith laughed unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"No," promised Jamie, "I won't lay it up against you, and since
Mrs. Meredith seems to have had fine success with a baby of her own
that isn't so many months older than our Jamie, let's try what she
says. The things she has here are the things the baby's mother made
for him. You see they are short. She intended to use the little
dresses and clothing she had made."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Mrs. Meredith, "all these things are what Mr.
MacFarlane brought from the hospital." She turned to him. "Are
there any more?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, "there were. But the nurse said the small
package was personal belongings of the baby's mother. It is in the
middle drawer of my highboy, Margaret. Any time you need anything
you haven't got, maybe it's there. I haven't reached the point of
trying to go through it myself, but I don't mind your looking
enough to see if there are any other things that the baby might
need."</p>

<p>"Well," said Margaret, "I must say frankly that this beats me!
I'm sure he'll be killed. I'm sure he'll take cold and die of the
croup. I thought babies and flannel were inseparable."</p>

<p>"Just cut off the 'in,'" laughed Mrs. Meredith. "Cut off the
'in' and make it 'separable'! My baby is the best baby you ever
saw. He isn't roaring with the colic and keeping us awake at night.
He is getting so fat his face is round like a full moon. We never
know he's in the house unless he is hungry or needs attention, and
he is the kind of a little gentleman that lets me know instanter
when he does need attention. Aside from that, I haven't got a baby
for all I know. You try the new way on this other little Jamie; try
it on him, and if he isn't a better baby and an easier baby to take
care of, less trouble in every way, and happier, why, then you can
call in a doctor and figure out what you think would serve
better."</p>

<p>She turned to Jamie.</p>

<p>"You must fix up some kind of a bed for him. It wouldn't be a
bad idea to get a clothes basket. Put a couple of pillows in it and
fold something over for a pad ding. Our little Scout will bring you
out a real softy pillow for his head. Our Jimmy has two or three.
He can always divide with another baby, and I think he has enough
little covers that we can spare a couple, and there is a world of
clothes in that suitcase. He won't be needing anything for months,
unless he grows so fast that he walks out of them."</p>

<p>She arose and went to the telephone, picked up a pencil attached
to a string, and on the margin of a list hanging there wrote a
number.</p>

<p>"That's my number, and a ring will find me at eight o'clock in
the morning, or twelve at noon, or six in the evening. If anything
goes wrong, call me and I'll come right out and see what I can do
to help you."</p>

<p>Then she picked up the baby and held it tight to her and kissed
its little face and its hands and finished with its feet and handed
it to Margaret Cameron. Jamie escorted Mrs. Meredith and the little
Scout back to the car. As he closed the door, the Scout Master
leaned forward and laid a hand on Jamie's and lifted a pair of lips
that had something to say. Jamie brought his ear in range.</p>

<p>"May I tell Mother about that girl off the Santa Fe buttin' in
on our garden?" came the whisper.</p>

<p>Jamie drew back and looked at the small person in surprise.
"Haven't you told her?" he inquired. The little Scout shook a
vigorous head.</p>

<p>"No. You said it might worry her, not to tell until Dad came,
but he's coming to-night."</p>

<p>"Since it's all over," said Jamie, "there's nothing to worry
about. You didn't leave the lady a leg to stand on. You got her
confession before three good witnesses, and it just happened that
there were two more in the back ground that you did not know about.
We have the papers in our possession, and that reminds me that,
while the lock of the chest is broken, I'd better go over that
stuff and select what really is important and put it in a safe
somewhere. I think likely I'd better turn it over to Mr.
Meredith."</p>

<p>"What are you two talking about?" inquired Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>"Since I wasn't in on the whole performance," said Jamie, "the
little Scout had better tell you from start to finish exactly how
things were, and then, if there are any details I can add as to
what I saw and heard personally, I'll be glad to furnish all the
corroborative evidence that I can."</p>

<p>As the car started Jamie heard the voice of the little Scout
saying: "A long time ago, one day when he was blue, the Bee Master
told me&mdash;" and that was all he heard of the story. What he had
seen of it was sufficient for him. He went back to the house
laughing and without realizing that Margaret Cameron would expect
him to be in mourning. He saw the surprise in her eyes and
straightened his face immediately. His Scotch honesty instantly
asserted itself.</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "I am not sailing under any false colours
with you. There are some things that I don't want to talk about,
because I don't understand them well enough to make them plain to
anybody else. But there is this I am going to tell you. I saw the
girl I married only once and very little of her before we were
married, and I did not see her afterward until she was at the point
of making her crossing. This baby bears my name and has been left
to me, and I am going to do the best job I can in rearing him
properly, but I am not in mourning for his mother, and you needn't
expect me to exhibit any deep symptoms of grief, because I can't
when I don't feel them."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron stood still, looking at the baby.</p>

<p>"That kind of a tale doesn't sound like you, Jamie," she said,
"but if I understand the province of a friend at all it consists
largely in keeping one's mouth shut and doing the things that will
be of most benefit. Naturally, I would like to know what this
baby's mother looked like and what kind of a girl she was, but I
suppose, after all, she looked like the baby since a boy generally
resembles his mother, and I can't tell what any baby three or four
days old looks like. If she were to be judged by this suit case of
baby clothing, she was pretty fine. These are dainty little things,
carefully and exquisitely made. That tells a big story about any
mother."</p>

<p>As the days went by, it seemed to Jamie that there never had
been a greater blessing afforded a woman than the Storm Baby was to
Margaret Cameron. He had the feeling very largely that that tiny
bit of humanity had the same pull for Margaret Cameron that it had
for Mrs. Meredith and the little Scout. Its appeal to him was
strong. Half-a-dozen times a day he made some excuse to slip into
the living room and look in the basket in which tiny Jamie lay. If
the little fellow were sleeping, he covered him up and went quietly
away. If he were awake, he leaned over and talked to him and
examined his hands and his feet. They were hands that had been
fashioned to play music, to paint pictures, to hold rare books,
possibly to write them.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he went he found Margaret Cameron busy bathing
the small person, or dressing him, or washing little garments, or
carefully ironing them. One day he realized suddenly that exactly
the thing that Margaret had asked for had been given to her.
Something alive, something that she could work for, something
different, something that would appreciate what she did. So he
ceased to feel guilty over the physical strength he was asking her
to spend on the tiny baby and felt instead that the child might be
the greatest boon that could come into her life. He had a difficult
time the day he tried to talk finances with Margaret concerning the
baby. After a few words she flatly refused to listen to him.</p>

<p>At last she said to him: "Jamie, this baby's been such a
blessing to me, loving him and caring for him has so eased the
tension in my brain, that I have no way in which to tell you what
he has done for me. I could not take money for him. Really I
couldn't! As time goes by, when he needs more clothing or things
come up, like a little bath tub shaped right for a baby, things
that he has to have, I'll tell you, and it's your right and your
privilege to get them, but as for taking money for what I am doing
for him, I can't do it. We won't talk about it again."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, and he walked out of the house and
began the process of going over Margaret's grounds minutely to
discover what there was that he could do in the garden she was
neglecting, among flowers she was hurriedly watering, that he
thought would be equivalent to the care of the baby.</p>

<p>Presently Margaret realized that this was what was happening,
and the arrangement suited her admirably. For a few days she had
not cared whether her flowers lived or died. She had not cared
whether her house were neat and orderly, or the food in place for
the mocking birds and rosy finches. To-day she cared immeasurably
about all these things because very soon little Jamie would be big
enough to notice a pretty flower, to throw crumbs to a bird, and
always his health must be safeguarded by perfect cleanliness and
sanitary conditions around him. So Margaret Cameron became more of
a housekeeper and less of an outdoors person, and Jamie found on
arising every morning that he had gained enough more strength to
add to the labours of his day what was necessary to be done at the
house across the white fence.</p>

<p>Religiously he stuck to the tomato juice in the morning, the
orange juice in the afternoon, milk as a beverage at meal time, the
diet that Margaret Cameron always insisted she had worlds of time
to prepare for him. He was beginning to feel so much of a man, so
secure in his strength, so proud of the skin coating that was
deepening in colour, deepening in thickness, stretching securely
across his left side, so proud of the free, pure blood coursing his
veins, so thankful to God for release, for his chance, he found his
lips puckering in a little whistled rendition of every tune he knew
as he went about his work. Some of them were army songs, things
that the boys had sung in camps, but most of them were songs that
he had sung in Sabbath School or things that he had heard his
mother sing when he was a child. Sometimes he picked up airs that
he heard on the streets or as he lay sunning on the beach. Jamie's
repertoire ran all the way from "Jesus, Gentle Saviour, Hear Me!"
to "It Ain't Gonna Rain No More," and as he used the hose to help
produce the most prolific growth of fruit and flowers that he had
ever known, as he thought of his healing side and the rare miracle
that had been wrought in his cure, it seemed to him that it did not
make much difference whether it rained or not. California seemed to
be getting along without rain.</p>

<p>But all this was superficial; all these were things that were
going on as a result of the exigencies of life. The deep thought,
the thing at the bottom of Jamie's hearty the thing that had sent
him reeling on his feet and had made him reel mentally ever since,
the thing he did not understand and that he could not excuse was
the thing that he had been led into by the Storm Girl.</p>

<p>He had thought from what she had said that she needed his help
for herself, and he had given it immediately, freely. But he did
not like being lied to. He did not like being deceived. He had
married one girl; he had been invited to assume the responsibility
of bringing up a child that belonged to an entirely different girl.
It was not fair. It was not honest. If his ring and if the
certificate of marriage that had been issued to him for the Storm
Girl had been turned over to another girl in distress that she
might have them to make her peace with doctors and nurses, he could
see how they could have been so used. But if the name under which
the marriage had been per formed were not the true name of the girl
he had married, then the marriage was not legal, and investigation
would leave the tiny baby to be a shame baby after all. The thing
had been clumsily done. In the condition in which he had been at
the time, feeling as he had felt, Jamie would have given his name
to any woman anywhere who needed it. He had taken the letter that
he had treasured from his pocket and laid it away. It was no longer
a personal possession. The whole thing had not been fair. Then,
when his indignation waxed hottest, when anger surged up the
strongest, in his heart came a great, throbbing, gushing,
overwhelming sense of relief. However she had lied, with whatever
motive she had deceived him, one big fact remained on Jamie's
horizon. The Storm Girl had fulfilled his thought of her. He had
not felt that a woman with sage in her hair and sand verbena and
primroses rising like an incense around her knees, her midnight
garments trailing in them, he had not thought that the hair of silk
binding across his face, that the physical strength, the quick
assurance of speech, he had not thought that these things possibly
could be coupled with a shame woman. He had been ready to accept
any excuse, to believe anything. Now there was nothing to believe
except that there had been a lie&mdash;but, after all, there had
been lies in the world that were rather magnificent. There was just
a bare possibility that this lie, that this thing that had been
done, had a reason backing it that he might be willing to
countenance. So Jamie spent largely of his days and somewhat of his
nights torn by conflicting emotions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20. The Scout Mutiny</h2>

<p>It was midsummer in the garden; long, golden vacation days. The
bees were happy. Innumerable swarms had stretched the rows of hives
not only down the sides of the garden, but well across the foot,
and Jamie was beginning to feel that by the coming season some of
them must be disposed of or he would have more than he could
manage. The flowers were blooming in a mad riot of colour. The
trees were laden with fruit. He was so nearly a well man that he
was beginning to use his left arm almost without realizing that he
was using it. Care fully he was oiling the soft skin. It was still
protected with a light pad. The bandages were so nearly negligible
he did not even notice them or the soft strap across his shoulders
that held them in place. Every day was a day of work that he loved
in a location that he loved. Every evening he found refuge in the
books that taught him the things that he needed to know to master
his new profession, and now he was beginning to branch out to those
other books, the emanations of the brightest minds of ages reaching
back to the earliest collected beginnings of literature.</p>

<p>With the advent of an income, with the assurance that he would
not be again at the mercy of the Government or the public, Jamie
had ventured to subscribe to half a dozen of the leading magazines
in which he was most interested, and they carried to him wonderful
tales of a world with which he had lost touch for a long period,
Some of the things he learned from them were interesting, highly
educative, and some of them were alarming, and he was set to
wondering where our country was heading, exactly what was to be
expected as an ending for peculiar beginnings that were being made.
Some of the things that he found, which seemed to be casually
accepted and written of and to be bandied about in the world in
print and conversation, set his cheeks flaming and the reserves of
his Scot soul felt outraged.</p>

<p>There began to be born in his breast the feeling that it was
time for him to go out in the world, to break his bands of security
and of peace in the garden, and hunt up the men who were forming
the Legion to which he should belong. He began to listen, on slow,
sleepy Sabbath mornings, for the tolling of the church bells, and
to wonder if there might be such a thing anywhere within a reason
able distance as a Presbyterian church with a minister just near
enough to Scotland to have a little bit of a loved burr in his
voice. He began to feel that the time was coming very shortly when
he was going to fare forth in search of these things.</p>

<p>He was thinking of it very strongly one morning when the hose he
was handling had brought him to a petunia bed just across from the
jacqueranda tree and he stooped to flood the roots of the brilliant
flowers. His scouting ears caught a rush of feet, a slam of the
gate, and there flashed into view the little Scout forging toward
him with both arms extended, a distorted face, and clothing fairly
torn to ribbons. Jamie dropped the hose and whirled with arms
outstretched. He caught on his breast the little quivering figure
and eased himself down to the seat under the jacqueranda and held
the child tight&mdash;a twisting, shaking figure, physically
nauseated, tears so big that they gushed and rolled in a torrent.
All he could do was to gather up the little bundle and hold it
together and wait. He began rubbing his cheeks over the small head,
whispering, as best he could, words of consolation.</p>

<p>"Little Scout, dear little Scout," he panted, "tell Jamie what
has hurt you so? Oh, what has hurt you so? Little Scout, little
partner!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly Jamie gathered the little figure tighter in his
arms and thrust his lips down through the hair to a grimy cheek,
and with all the intensity in his body he repeatedly kissed the
little Scout.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he whispered, "darling little sweetheart, tell
Jamie, tell Jamie what's the matter."</p>

<p>And by and by, from the huddled bunch on his breast there came a
panted whisper:</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody told me anything," said Jamie. "You tell me. What is it?
What has happened to you? Where have you been? If anybody's hurt
you&mdash;" War rose in Jamie's breast; red war flamed in his eyes.
"Did any boy lay a finger on you?" he panted.</p>

<p>The little Scout moved in negation.</p>

<p>"Who then? What?" urged Jamie. "I'm ripe for murder! Tell me
where I'm to go, what I'm to do!"</p>

<p>The bleached little head buried deeper in his breast, the grimy
hands gripped him tighter. Something was being whispered. Jamie
almost broke his neck to drop his ear to hearing distance.</p>

<p>There came in wheezing gusts: "My Scouts"&mdash;another world of
tears and another panted gasp&mdash;"mutinied on me! They
wanted&mdash;to go off down the beach, away alone, and strip bare
naked and swim, and&mdash;and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jamie held tight and spread his big hands over as much of the
little body as he could cover. He leaned low to catch the
whisper.</p>

<p>"&mdash;I couldn't. And they mutinied on me and they nearly tore
me to pieces!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean," asked Jamie, "that those little brutes pitched on
to you and beat you?"</p>

<p>The little Scout wormed in his arms.</p>

<p>"I reckon I had it coming," panted the child. "I reckon I've
beat them up often enough. But I was tired this morning. I couldn't
get the old grip on 'em. I couldn't handle 'em, and they got
me."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Jamie, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"A man came along, a man on horseback, and he reached down and
picked me up on his horse and brought me along out of their reach
until I said let me off here. Oh, Jamie! I'm killed! I'm going up
the rock and I'm going in the undertow where I can't get myself out
if I want to."</p>

<p>Jamie held on tight.</p>

<p>"Why, you little idiot, you can't do that," he said. "Think of
your father, think of your mother, think of Nannette and little
Jimmy! Think of me! You can't do that!"</p>

<p>"I ain't got anything left," sobbed the little Scout. "There
ain't anything I want to do. If I can't lead my Scouts, I don't
want to play anywhere!"</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Jamie, harshly, his voice roughened with
emotion. "Look here, darling! You got a wrong start because you
didn't like what girls do, and you've been running with the boys
until you have about unsexed yourself. And what have you got out of
it? Embarrassment and disappointment and a beaten body. You needn't
think you are the only girl in the world of your kind. You needn't
think that there aren't a lot of others who don't like to stay in
the house and do the things that girls are supposed to do. You
needn't think that to be a Scout Master you have got to be the
master of a pack of boys. Damn them!"</p>

<p>Jamie arose.</p>

<p>"You come on in the house with me," he said. "I'm going to clean
you up and take you to your mother and she is going to put some
decent clothes on you and we are going off by ourselves for to-day.
We are going off some place you will like. We are going to do
something you will want worse than anything in the world. I'll tell
you right here and now what we are going to do. We are going to get
you the finest little horse that ever stepped! I've been looking
for him and advertising in the papers for him, and I've found him.
I've got him all ready for you. I was just waiting a few days
because I had lumber ordered. I was going to build a stable over on
your side next to nobody. John Carey was coming tomorrow to help
me, and when I got it done I was going to have the little horse
there to surprise you, but he can wait for a stable. We will go and
buy him to-day."</p>

<p>The little Scout slid from Jamie's arm and stepped in front of
him. An outstretched hand was a mute invitation for the partnership
handkerchief. Jamie supplied it and the little Scout used it.</p>

<p>"A real horse, a nice horse, my very own horse that nobody rides
but me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, ready to promise anything in the world.
"Yes."</p>

<p>"We can buy him, we can buy him to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jamie, still ready to go the limit.</p>

<p>"That's the berries!" said the little Scout. "Then I won't go in
the undertow. Then I won't care any more <i>what</i> Fat Ole Bill
and the Nice Child and Angel Face say. If any of them wants to have
the sword and all the emblems of office, they can. They can have
the robbers' cave and the bandits' den, they can have the Indian
fighting. I'll go with you, and I'll have my horse."</p>

<p>"Sure you'll have your horse!" said Jamie. "I'll hike with you,
and we'll see what's in the canyons and what we can find that you
will be interested in outdoors; and you know, if you would go and
investigate, you would find that there are girls' camps where they
do all the things in scouting stunts that the boys are doing, and I
haven't a doubt, either, that they do some of them better!"</p>

<p>The Ex-Scout Master straightened up and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Jamie, do you think honestly that they do 'em
<i>better?</i>"</p>

<p>"Bet you two bits they can!" said Jamie. "Ill find out where
headquarters are, and I'll go with you and we'll see. But I bet you
two bits that those girls can lay a fire right and make the sparks
fly quicker, I bet they can set a tent, do anything they want to
do, and do it quicker than those Scouts you have been training
with, anyway. I wouldn't have anything to do with freelance Scouts.
They're outlaws. I'd let those boys go hang!" Then the Keeper of
the Bees ventured further: "I'd let them go hang, Jean. If I were
in your place, I'd find out where there were some girls of my kind
and I'd stick to my own kind, and with the training you've had and
with the stunts you've been doing, there isn't a doubt in my mind
but that you can work up so that in maybe six months you can be the
leader. You can do something that isn't play but is real,
constructive scouting work, something that gets you somewhere. You
can train yourself so you might be able to help stop a mountain
fire, or find a lost child, or do something wonderful and worth
while, some thing that isn't just play. And there is your own horse
you can have and you can ride. I can ride a bit myself. There are
none of the tricks of riding that I can't teach you."</p>

<p>The handkerchief was restored to its owner. Jean Meredith began
to feel over her body to see if she had sufficient clothes
remaining to cover her.</p>

<p>"Is it a bargain?" asked Jamie. "Are you going to take the car
and go down the beach to the stables where this particular horse I
am talking about is waiting for you? There are three bully ones.
You can take your choice. Shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, boy!" the cry came in almost breathless wonder. "Shall we
go? Shall we paint the petunias, shall we put the scent in the
roses? Shall we march past the Black Germans? Shall we flip the
dirt off our shoulders into the eyes of the first Boy Scout we
meet? I'll tell the world we shall! And Fat Ole Bill and the Nice
Child and Angel Face can just plumb go right straight to perdition!
I wouldn't ever play with 'em again, not if they came and got on
their knees, not if they begged me with tears in their eyes! I
wouldn't ever play with them again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Jamie, "and I'll wager you another two bits.
I'll wager you two bits that inside of a week they'll come and ask
you to play with them again!"</p>

<p>Jean Meredith stuffed the tail of her shirt inside the band of
her breeches. The simper that she marshalled on her smeary, teary
face was something exquisite. Her body bent in a curve. The index
finger of her left hand lightly touched her lower lip. With the
right hand she flicked a chunk of adobe that was not in the least
imaginary from the left shoulder.</p>

<p>"Aw, thanks!" she said with the most flapperish of flapper
accents. "Aw, thanks, my deah boys! You are chawming, simply
chawming, but I have outgrown you. I've graduated from small folks
to a higher class. Kindly amuse yourselves by eating my dust when I
ride by on my own horse!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the exquisite flapper became the little Scout
again.</p>

<p>"Jamie, is my horse a <i>he</i> horse or a <i>she</i>
horse?"</p>

<p>"There are two or three," said Jamie. "I haven't settled
definitely. There are two or three I am going to lead you to. I'd
like to see if you like the one best that I like best. In any
event, you may have the one you want."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jean. "All right. What I was thinking about
was that if my horse is <i>he</i>, I am going to name him Chief,
and if she's <i>she</i>, I'm going to name her Swallow, and
whichever one it is I am going to get there on it, no matter if
it's straight up a mountain-side or right into the ocean. My horse
and me are going to swim same as we are going to ride!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, reaching a hand that was instantly
accepted, "let's go!"</p>

<p>When Jean was properly dressed and they were settled on their
car headed toward the corral where Jamie had learned there were
riding horses being sold several miles farther down the beach,
Jamie again broached the subject of horse.</p>

<p>"Jean," he said, "have you any very definite idea in your head
as to exactly what kind of a horse you want?"</p>

<p>Obliquely Jamie was watching. He saw a slightly sullen look, a
slight stiffening of the figure, and he knew what it meant. There
was a minute or two of silence and then, instead of an answer to
his question, there came a question on a different subject.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ever going to call me 'Little Scout' any more?"</p>

<p>Jamie thought hard and fast.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'm not. Not ever again. I'm going to call you
by your <i>name</i> after this. It's a perfectly good name and one
that I like very much. It's Scot, and so am I, at heart. So far as
I am concerned, you are done masquerading. The rest of the way,
when you are with me, you are going to be what you are. You lay
pretty stiff stress on people playing the game square in this
world. You've gotten away with it in a good many instances all
right so far, but from now on you're getting big enough that you'll
strike some pretty unpleasant things if you undertake to keep on
masquerading."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you don't want me to wear breeches any more
around you?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, foolish!" said Jamie. "I think breeches are the thing
for you to wear when you work in the garden and ride, and during
play hours, and when you are exercising. What I want you to do is
to stop playing with the boys and learn how fine your own sex can
be. You needn't think you are the only girl in the world that likes
to ride a horse or to climb or to be outdoors or to command a Scout
company. I want you to get on your own side of the line, where you
belong."</p>

<p>Jean thought that over carefully as was her custom.</p>

<p>Then she said slowly but in more cheerful tones:</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you're right about it, but you'll have to show
me!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, "I'll show you! The first thing we're
going to do is to head right straight for a number I have here in
this pocket. We are going to join you up to a Girl Scout camp and I
am going to be your escort to a meeting once a week. If they won't
let me inside, I'll hang around outside until you get through, but
you needn't tell me that any girl joins a Girl Scout camp without
being the kind of a girl who likes to swim and paddle a canoe and
ride a horse and be out-of-doors. And you needn't tell me that
among the number of girls it would take to form a camp there aren't
going to be at least two or three that are going to be nice-looking
girls, and nicely behaved girls, girls of good families, girls with
whom your mother would be glad to have you associate."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jean. "We'll play 'Follow My Leader.' You set
the pace and I'll be right after you."</p>

<p>They had no difficulty whatever in finding the number of a
secretary who gladly registered Jean Meredith, furnished the
necessary cards and equipment, and Jamie paid the bills. When they
were once more on the car and headed for the corral, Jean looked at
him.</p>

<p>"Jamie," she said, "that was a good deal of money you paid
there. I didn't see how much, but it was more than you must pay for
me. You must take it out of my share of the next sale of honey.
I'll tell Dad that you did."</p>

<p>"Never you mind about that," said Jamie. "Your father and I will
attend to the finances. You needn't fret about my spending a little
money on you, because I haven't started to spend money yet. There
are two more things I'm going to do before this day is over. Both
of them are going to cost me some money, and it will be the easiest
money that I ever spent, because, if you hadn't gotten my
inheritance back for me, I wouldn't have had any money to spend on
anything, with the exception of what I've saved out of my earnings
this summer. If it hadn't been for you, it wouldn't have taken me
very long to be down to bed rock financially, and with little Jamie
on my hands in the bargain. So, if I can accept my east acre with
all there is on it from you, you can take what I want to give you
to-day without making any objections concerning it, can't you?"</p>

<p>"I sure can," said Jean, and the twinkle that Jamie knew crept
into her eyes. "You said <i>two</i> things. What other thing
besides a horse?"</p>

<p>"We'll stop right here and you will see," said Jamie.</p>

<p>Again they left the street car and this time Jean was led into a
tailor shop where she was measured for a proper pair of girl's
riding breeches and two coats, one having sleeves and one having
none, both of them having fitted bodies and skirts with a bit of a
flare and nifty pockets. The garments were to be made from a lovely
soft blue-gray cloth very nearly the colour of the eyes of the
youngster who was to wear them. Then from displayed accessories
Jamie selected two silk shirts and a blue and gray tie, and
handkerchiefs with borders to match the shirts. Little squeals of
delight greeted the fitting of a pair of gray boots with soft folds
around the ankles and stiff tops and gloves with cuffs to match
them. Jean looked dubiously at the gloves. She wiggled her fingers
and told the truth.</p>

<p>"It seems a pity for you to spend money on them. I bet a dollar
I lose them the first time I start out with them."</p>

<p>"I don't think that would be showing me much consideration,"
said Jamie, "to value the first gift I ever made you so lightly
that you would lose it. I could do better than that with them, if
you made me a present of a pair of gloves."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got a lot of pockets," said Jean.</p>

<p>"You're going to have pockets, too," answered Jamie, and turning
to the smiling tailor, he ordered: "You're to put inside pockets in
those coats, and left breast pockets on the outside, and plenty of
pockets in the breeches. We don't want to give this young lady any
chance to lose her handkerchiefs and gloves."</p>

<p>As they left the store, Jamie said: "Now, we've done a fair job
of getting the cart before the horse. We've bought the accessories.
Now we'll buy the horse, and after we select the horse, we'll go to
a leather shop and buy a saddle and a sporty riding crop."</p>

<p>Jean shook her head.</p>

<p>"Don't spend money on a whip," she said. "I don't use 'em! I
guide my horse with my hands."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, young lady," said Jamie, "there are times when
the life of any rider is in danger who is not armed with a good,
sharp whip. If a horse becomes terrified on the mountains and
starts to back over a cliff that would land you in Kingdom Come,
and you had in your hand a good, stout whip and could lay on a few
cuts that would sting sharply, you might succeed in making that
horse forget its fright and carry you forward."</p>

<p>"That's so, too," agreed Jean, instantly. "I didn't think about
that because I haven't ever ridden much where there was real
danger. Queen and I have climbed the mountains some, but Queen has
too much sense to back on a body."</p>

<p>"I never bank on how much sense a horse has," said Jamie,
"because if something comes rolling out unexpectedly and terrifies
it so that it jumps for self-protection, the damage is done before
a horse really knows what has happened. You are never safe on the
back of a real horse without a good, stout whip. It is a part of
the necessary equipment, and whatever your theory of loving
kindness may be, there are some creatures in this world that you
cannot manage except by force when they are frightened."</p>

<p>"Just like Miss Worthington," commented Jean. "And I tell you it
got my goat to call her 'Worthington' 'cause I happened to know
that her name was Young, just plain, red-haired, snub-nosed,
freckle-faced Young. I never did see anybody that I couldn't bear
quite so hard as that 'Kiddo' person. It wasn't so easy to do it,
but I'll tell the world, she got what was coming to her, and I
might strike another case just like her. You get the whip!"</p>

<p>When they arrived at the corral, Jamie went around to the gate.
He knew so well where the gate was that Jean realized that he had
been there before and she realized, too, that the men who came to
meet him were acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Jamie spoke to them and said:</p>

<p>"I want you to become acquainted with Miss Jean Meredith, and
I'd like to have you show her the three horses that I looked at the
other day."</p>

<p>Jean stood entranced as three horses were led before her. They
were really ponies, animals the right proportion for her to ride
and look well on, and that she would have strength to make obey her
will.</p>

<p>"Now, one at a time we will saddle these," said Jamie, "and you
may put in two or three hours riding them. You can try them over
and over until you discover which one has the gait that suits you.
I've looked them over very carefully. They are all of reasonable
age; they are all in good condition. There is very little
difference in the price."</p>

<p>Then Jamie realized that he was talking to the air. Jean was not
hearing a word he was saying. She was standing before the three
horses, staring at them. Slowly she went up to the first one and
pulled down its head. She ran her hand over its forehead. She
looked deep into its eyes. She drew its ear through her hands. Then
she slipped her left hand under the chin and with the right parted
the lips and looked at the teeth. Then she went around the side and
down the neck and over the chest and down the fore legs. She got
the spine line in perspective and looked at the sides and the
flanks and the tail, around and over. As a surgeon searches for a
hidden disease, the youngster examined those horses, and Jamie
realized suddenly that she knew more about horses than he did. She
was looking for points that he had not thought about. He stood back
in amusement and watched her examine the three horses minutely.
When she had finished, she stepped out in front of them.</p>

<p>She pointed to one and said: "That one has the best temper, but
it is easy and slow. That one has a good disposition. It will go
steady and it will go all day. I believe it has good wind."</p>

<p>Then she looked at the last one.</p>

<p>"And this one has got a fine large dose of the devil in him. You
won't know when he's going to kick and when he's going to rear, but
he won't know when you're going to want to turn a quick curve or
slide down a mountain-side instead of walking. So maybe that will
be even. He'll go the farthest and he'll keep it up the longest,
but it would be a good long while before anybody that owned him
could really <i>trust</i> him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, "so far as I know that's probably the
way it is. Now, put the saddle on and I'll give you two hours to
test them. I'm going to go down to the sand and stretch out in the
sun for an hour. I've gotten so accustomed to it at this time of
day that I miss it if I don't get my sun bath. The salt water I'll
pass up for the day."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Jean. "Stay here for a minute."</p>

<p>Her nimble feet went flying over in the direction of a corner
stand. On her return she came up to Jamie and handed him a paper
bag.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Jamie, gravely, as he accepted the
bag. Then he turned to the attendant.</p>

<p>"Let this young lady," he said, "ride each one of these three
horses around the track as often as she wants to. By the time she
has her selection made, I'll be back to escort her home. Anything
she wants, will you kindly see to it for her?"</p>

<p>The attendant said that he would and went to bring a saddle.
Jean dug the toe of her shoe in the dust of the corral and then
looked obliquely at Jamie.</p>

<p>"What's the use to rub it in?" she asked.</p>

<p>And Jamie did not resort to the subterfuge of asking, "Rub what
in?" He happened to know, and he was too much of a Scot to pretend
that he didn't know when he did.</p>

<p>"You die hard, don't you?" said Jamie. "But if you have been at
this subterfuge all your life, I suppose you can't get over it all
in a minute. At any rate, I'll explain to you exactly why I rub in
the fact that you are a girl good and hard. I am conceding that you
look enough like a boy so that any one might mistake you for a boy
when you are doing your utmost to prove that you are one. The
reason I seem to hammer in the fact that you are a girl is because
men among themselves sometimes grow pretty coarse and they say
things and they do things that they would neither say nor do if
they understood that a child of your size among them was a girl.
What I am trying to do, Jean, is to give you the same kind of
loving care and protection that I'd give you if you were my little
sister."</p>

<p>Jean looked at Jamie and studied him intently. Then she almost
bowled him over.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ever be old enough or big enough to be your
sweetheart, would I?" she asked, as casually as she would have
asked for a drink of water.</p>

<p>Only for a minute there rushed in a tumult through Jamie's brain
a picture of the kind of a sweetheart that the child before him
might make ten or twelve years hence, and his head went a little
wild; but Scotsmen are noted for saneness and sobriety and
integrity, and he held himself and answered steadily: "I cannot
imagine any sweetheart in the whole world I'd rather have than you,
Jean, but it wouldn't be fair to you. I am too much older than you
are. Youth demands youth. Nothing else is fair. I have noticed in
my experience that things always go wrong when a man is much older
than a woman. It isn't fair to a girl to tie her up to a man very
nearly old enough to be her father. If I ever marry again, I'm
going to marry a woman very near my own age."</p>

<p>"Was Jamie's mother very near your own age?" inquired Jean,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, considerably nearer than you are," said Jamie. "Now you
go and ride your horses and I'll go and take my sun bath and when
you have your horse selected I'll match it up with the saddle and
I'm not right sure that we didn't make a mistake in ordering the
clothes first. Perhaps they should match the horse, too."</p>

<p>Jean thought that over.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't guess that suit is going to be cut out and made
right this minute. Maybe we could change the colours of the things
this afternoon by telephone. There was the same cloth in tans and
browns as well as blues and grays."</p>

<p>"So there was," said Jamie. "Maybe we'll want to change it. Now,
think about your horse, and be sure you get the right one. We don't
want to find out later that you have a biting brute of a thing that
is going to tax your strength every time you go out. You want a
horse that will be your friend; that will be some comfort to you;
that will love you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jean, "that's exactly the kind of a horse I do want.
I want a horse that will love me like Dad's dog loves him."</p>

<p>"Well, I doubt," said Jamie, "if you will find a horse with the
capacity for love that a dog has. A dog has been around man so many
centuries and has had so much attention that he has come to be
almost human. There are times when I've seen a dog think; there are
times when I've almost heard a dog talk; there are times when they
have managed sounds that told what they wanted."</p>

<p>"I'll tell the world!" said Jean. "Dad's dog can every time, and
so could Mother's dog, Chum."</p>

<p>Then she turned to the horses and Jamie turned toward the
beach.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21. Then Comes a
Vision</h2>

<p>When Jamie reached the road, he crossed it and started down a
steep embankment leading to the hot sands of the sea and the
breaking waves. As he was going down, to his right he noticed a
stone projecting in such a manner as to make a particularly
attractive seat. From the feel of the package he thought he knew
what he had. So Jamie went over and sat on the stone screened on
one side by an unusually large toluache, its lilied white trumpets
blaring widely from blue edgings. Next to it a rose mallow towered,
ten feet tall, a flaunting cloud of rosy pink accentuated by
maple-like leaves of silvery green. He reached in his pocket, drew
out his knife, and opening it, opened the bag, also, and found what
he had expected: two very large, very red tomatoes. It was the time
for his morning tomato juice. Jean had been thoughtful of him; she
had decided that if he could not have the juice, he could eat the
tomatoes and get his vitamines in slightly different form. So Jamie
laid one tomato on the paper beside him and with his knife cut the
stem end and the core from the other and began peeling back the
thin skin in small pieces and cutting out the tomato in chunks. He
found that he was enjoying it thoroughly. He had formed the tomato
habit. He had gotten to the place where, if he did not have tomato
juice at ten-thirty, his stomach arose and shouted for it.</p>

<p>While he was sitting there enjoying his fruit and watching the
hundreds flocking back and forth on the beach, family parties here
and there sheltered by beach umbrellas, people in bathing suits
lying on the sands, children playing in the breakers, swimmers
floating far out&mdash;the everyday life of a beach in
summertime&mdash;there broke on his ears from behind him a clamour
that to say the least was startling, and then there came pouring
down the embankment at his left the most surprising aggregation of
humanity he ever had seen collected in one crowd. Little Mexico
with straight black hair and black eyes, with rosy cheeks and red
lips and shining teeth. Sober little Yaqui with blue-black hair,
with square, narrow face, with wide mouth and shining eyes and red
lips. Little Italy, the prettiest sight, with tumbling curls and
olive cheeks and always the lips of red and the white teeth. Little
Spain was there wide-eyed and lovely; and China and Japan and
Greece, and shiny little copper-coloured Indian faces with the
straight hair, deep-set, watchful eyes, the high cheek bones and
sober faces, with lean, flat bodies and the prideful lift of head
of the proudest race that ever walked the earth.</p>

<p>As this amazing combination poured over the embankment around
him, Jamie noticed that each youngster either carried a small
basket or clasped a small package. Some were boys, some were girls.
All of them were shining eyed, all of them were young, all of them
were beautiful, each in its own way, beautiful with the beauty of a
perfect thing in the flower of youth.</p>

<p>Those who reached the sand first paused and looked back and
beside Jamie, so near that he could have reached out and laid a
hand upon it, there came down the embankment a narrow, arched foot
and a slender leg clad in hiking boots. Then came khaki breeches,
and in an instant more there stood out, back toward him, a tall,
slender girl. The figure never could have been a boy. There were
decided calves to the booted legs. There were rounded hips and arms
and the profile of a shapely breast-There was a gracefully lifted
neck, and it was topped with a shorn head of hair so thick that it
stood out at the sides and on the top and turned over in big, soft
curls and sloped down to the neck at the back like the hair of a
boy.</p>

<p>When the foot lifted and took one step forward, Jamie looked
down into the track that remained in the sand and drew in a deep
breath in which he recognized sage and beach primrose and sand
verbena, albeit heavily laden with garlic and mangoes and tamales.
Jamie's heart stopped right where it was and stood still so long
that he did not know whether it ever was going to begin beating
again or not. He shut his eyes tight and a strand of wet hair
whipped across his face and drew him. Then he opened his eyes to
make sure and saw the shorn head, and in his heart he cried: "Oh,
what a pity! What a terrible pity! How could she sacrifice her
crowning glory, a mane of silk like that?"</p>

<p>He watched the graceful movements of the slender girl as she
went down the beach and seated herself a few rods in front of him.
The little flock gathered around her. He heard a voice that he had
heard before, that he knew perfectly, saying: "Now, children,
before we have our lunch and before we begin to play, we must have
our lesson just to see if you are going to remember when school is
not in session. What is this before you?"</p>

<p>In concert the children shouted: "Pa-ceef-ik O-shun!"</p>

<p>"And what is back of you?"</p>

<p>"Sierra Madre Mountains!"</p>

<p>"And what is above you?"</p>

<p>"Sky!"</p>

<p>"And what is it you are sitting on?"</p>

<p>"Sand!"</p>

<p>"And whose country is this?"</p>

<p>Each little individual shouted for him or herself: "My
country!"</p>

<p>"And who of you can recite 'My Country'?"</p>

<p>The air was waving with little hands. The teacher pointed in the
direction of a little Yaqui Indian boy.</p>

<p>"Isadore, you try!"</p>

<p>The little fellow stood up, brought his heels together, removed
the little straw hat he was wearing, and because he knew what the
child was going to say before he began, Jamie could
distinguish:</p>

<p class="poem">"'My count-ree tissof 'ee, Swee' lan' of
li-ber-tee&mdash;'"</p>

<p>The teacher of Americanism smiled on the little fellow and said:
"Right, Isadore! That's fine. Now, who cart tell us what 'liberty'
is?"</p>

<p>Again the air was full of hands.</p>

<p>The teacher indicated a little girl of Mexico.</p>

<p>"Maria, you try."</p>

<p>Maria answered promptly, waving her arms like a wind mill over
the sands and toward the mountains and the sky and the sea:</p>

<p>"All this&mdash;with no fights."</p>

<p>The teacher applauded. Then she asked: "And who was the Father
of your Country?"</p>

<p>Little Japan knew: "George Washeton."</p>

<p>"And who is our President?"</p>

<p>Little Greece and Spain and China shouted in unison, "Alvin
Oolidge!" and the teacher laughed and applauded again.</p>

<p>By this time quite a crowd had collected. Children with fairer
faces had gathered and were listening and looking on. Grown people
were passing before and behind the group of twenty-one, according
to Jamie's count. They went on with their affairs without paying
the slightest attention. The teacher opened a book the size of a
school atlas, and taking a pencil, began to draw.</p>

<p>Mechanically, Jamie finished the tomatoes, wiped his knife
through the sand and then on his trouser leg, snapped it shut and
restored it to his pocket. Then he arose and walked down the beach
until he stood within three feet of the back of the girl he knew
and looked over her shoulder in company with several other
people.</p>

<p>The girl had drawn up one knee and the big book rested on it.
The other leg stretched out along the sand in lithe comfort. The
head was bent and with the right hand, in quick, precise movements,
Jamie saw there was being crudely sketched the figure of a man.
When the work was sufficiently completed that the component parts
stood out plainly, the pencil rested on the round head, and
instantly most of the youngsters touched their own craniums and
shouted, "Head!" Then they proceeded down the anatomy, naming neck,
shoulders, arms, hands, body, knees, feet. Then the pencil went
back to the cranium and began making upstanding strokes on it and
each youngster lifted his or her hands to his or her head and
shouted, "Hair!" Then came forehead, and brow, and eyes, and
eyelids, and eyelashes, and by this time, as each part of the face
was named, the teacher ran a line out to the margin of the paper
and whirled it into a circle and inside that circle printed very
plainly, "Nose." "Eye." "Ear." Every feature of the face was being
reproduced and named.</p>

<p>Jamie noticed as this proceeding advanced from the ears downward
that the space that had been left for the mouth was large. He stood
almost breathlessly watching while gums were placed in the mouth,
and then teeth and a tooth. The mellow voice of the teacher was
talking almost constantly. She opened her mouth and exposed firm,
milk-white teeth. She ran the eraser of the pencil across them to
indicate that all of them were teeth. And all the children showed
their teeth and ran a finger across them and shouted, "Teeth!"</p>

<p>Then she touched one of her front teeth and said: "Tooth," and
held up one finger and indicated one tooth. Then all the little
brown children found "a" tooth. She stuck her tongue out, laughing
all the while, a very pink tongue glowing with health, not a sign
of a bilious coat on the extent of it, and all the little brown
people stuck out their tongues and shouted with laughter and
immediately fell to making faces at each other. Isadore made such
an ugly face at little Mexico that Mexico threw a handful of sand
and a scuffle began on the outskirts. The teacher sat laughingly
watching. Then her voice was raised to call them to order. Very
distinctly she pronounced the word "tongue," and all the little
folks kept showing their tongues and telling each other that they
were tongues. Then she drew the tongue in the mouth of the figure
she was working with, and from the tip of it she swept the pencil
over to the margin and rounded the circle in which she meant to
write the word.</p>

<p>At that instant, there was the slightest movement be hind her.
Someone knelt at her back. A big brown hand flashed over her
shoulder and firmly imprisoned her hand and the pencil it was
holding, held it in a grip from which there was no release, and
with extreme plainness in the circle she had made, one little ugly
word comprised of four letters was printed. She was forced to print
it three different times, and under the first writing there was one
underscoring; under the second, two; under the third, there were
three, very broad and black. The words that were written were:</p>

<p>"Lies! Lies! Lies!"</p>

<p>Then her hand was released. She was free to go on with her
lesson in Americanism.</p>

<p>As Jamie arose from his knees, he kept his eyes on the back of
the girl, and what he saw was, that aside from the slight tensing
of her figure that he had felt as he leaned against her back, there
was not the least indication that she recognized the presence of
any one behind her. There had been no resistance in the hand he had
held. It had yielded to his use, and he had used it to write the
ugly word as forcefully as he could write it. After he had re
leased the hand, he saw the surge of red that flamed up in the
cheek next him; he saw the pencil whipped over and the erasure of
the words he had written begun.</p>

<p>He was on his feet heading down the beach. He was dying to look
back, and he would not. The question that was hammering in his
heart and brain was whether she would follow him, whether she would
speak to him. If there only were a rock. If he could only stub his
toe; if he could only pretend that he had fallen, that he might
look back and see whether she were coming. But there was no rock.
There was no slightest excuse for looking back unless he did it
deliberately, and he was too Scot stubborn to let the girl see, if
she happened to be looking his way, that he would turn his head for
her.</p>

<p>The whole thing had been so unexpected and so bewildering that
his brain was only functioning as far as proceedings had gone. He
had not reached the place where he could think progressively,
consecutively, conjecturally. He was simply putting distance
between himself and a girl who had lied to him, lied outrageously.
He had experienced the satisfaction of letting her know that he
knew her and that he had called her a liar about as definitely and
emphatically as a man well could, but he had not gone farther in
thought than he had in action.</p>

<p>Right there he reached a rocky projection that ran down until
the waves were breaking at its base, each wave creeping higher.
Jamie was in no mood to stop for water. He went through, and as he
rounded the rocks it seemed to him that here was an opportunity for
a backward glance without being discovered. So he took the backward
glance and what he saw stopped his heart again.</p>

<p>Away back on the beach in a sedate circle, mute and wide-eyed,
with their lunches gripped tight, waiting the command from their
beloved teacher, were the little brown and red and chocolate and
copper-coloured children, born in the United States, products of
our soil, entitled by our laws and our Government to be educated
with our children, to live with them, to love with them, to fight
with them, to die with them, all free, all equal before the law.
They were huddled there waiting, while their teacher was coming
down the beach in flying strides.</p>

<p>Jamie thought in all his life he never had seen anything quite
so beautiful. The Storm Girl was running as an Indian runs, perhaps
her body a bit straighter, her chin thrown a trifle higher. The
ocean breeze was catching her thick red-brown hair and blowing it
back. He could see the broad white forehead. He could see the flash
of the brown-gray eyes. He could see the surge of red staining the
cheeks and the lips and even the throat. He could see the heavy
sprinkling of freckles that the sun had drawn out not only crossing
the bridge of the nose, but scattered over the entire face. In a
minute, with the sweep at which she was coming, she would reach
him. All Jamie could think of was that he must not be caught
peering around a rock. To preserve his dignity he should be
striding down the beach with his head up, with his shoulders
square, his back toward her. Let the little liar run after him! Let
her catch him if she thought she had anything to say to him!</p>

<p>At that moment, with anger flaming hot in his heart against her,
Jamie whirled on his heel and looked behind him. He saw that he was
standing before a crevice in the overhanging rock that led back to
what looked as if it might be some kind of a subterranean passage.
Before he realized what he was doing, he had gone plunging into the
black depths until he brought up precipitately against walls which
would afford him no further retreat. He turned in time to see the
shadow of the Storm Girl's figure as she splashed through the waves
in passing the opening. Immediately he was back at the entrance.
She was still racing down the beach in absorbed pursuit. Jamie
darted into the water around the point and did some sprinting on
his own behalf. By the time the Storm Girl could have retraced her
steps, he was across the road and hidden by the live oak, the
madrono, the manzanita, and the sage of the mountainside. Hurriedly
he made his way back to the corral.</p>

<p>He found Jean exactly where he had expected to find her, on the
back of a horse, circling the riding course that surrounded the
corral where the horses were being sold.</p>

<p>When she saw him, she rode up to the railing and asked:</p>

<p>"How do you like this one?"</p>

<p>"This one" was, to Jamie's way of thinking, the poorest horse of
the three.</p>

<p>"What are his points?" asked Jamie, and laughed out right at the
femininity of the first response.</p>

<p>"Well, he matches my suit, for one thing. You wouldn't have to
telephone. And for another, he's got the wind and he rides easy,
and he <i>likes</i> me. He seems as if he kind of needed to be
loved and petted up a good deal. He seems like he could be better
looking than he is if he was rubbed up a lot, and fed right, and
ridden with some sense. Most of the kids that get on these horses
think they're on a piece of machinery, and they don't care whether
they break it or whether they don't, so long as it doesn't belong
to them. <i>This</i> horse could stand quite a bit of being treated
decent."</p>

<p>THEN COMES A VISION 477</p>

<p>Jean stood in one stirrup, drew the other leg across the horse
and deftly dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>"I haven't put any of 'em to the final test," she said. "Let's
try it."</p>

<p>She called to the attendant and said to him:</p>

<p>"Bring my horses and stand them along in a row headed toward me.
Right along there."</p>

<p>"Right along there" was an imaginary line perhaps four feet in
front of her. When the horses were so dis posed, Jean stood in
front of them. She looked them over carefully. She walked up to
each horse and, one at a time, she laid the length of its head
against her body. She cupped her hands around their ears, pressed
in at the bases, and drew them through her hands two or three
times, and then slid her hands down under each cheek and under the
throat and hugged the head tight. Precisely what she did to the
throat and muzzle, Jamie could not tell. This performance she
repeated with each of them, with the horse she had been riding,
last, and it seemed to Jamie that her touch was lingering, that she
hugged it slightly closer. She certainly finished by laying her
cheek against its nose. Then she backed away eight or ten feet and
uttered a funny little whinnying call, and of the three horses, the
one she had ridden last stepped forward and immediately went to her
and again dropped its head to her touch.</p>

<p>Jean laid her hand on it and said to Jamie: "If this is the
horse I think he is, if he is <i>my</i> horse, he will follow
me."</p>

<p>She gave one more light stroke around the ears and across the
nose and said to the horse: "Come on, Chief!" and started down the
corral. The horse followed her as she might have been followed by a
dog that she had trained for a considerable period.</p>

<p>That settled the horse question. All that remained for Jamie to
do was to make the reservation, to set a date when Chief should be
delivered and where, to stop on the way home and purchase the
saddle and the crop upon which he insisted, and then to make as
straight a journey as possible to the garden of the bees, because
there was lumber to arrive for the stable and John Carey was coming
the next day to help him and the carpenter he had engaged to build
a shelter for Chief.</p>

<p>When they left the car line and started up the road toward the
bee garden, Jamie, from an impulse whose origin he could not have
guessed, faced Jean.</p>

<p>"Everything all satisfactory?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jean stood very still, and finally she raised her eyes and in
them Jamie saw precisely what he had seen in the face of the Storm
Girl when she had left him without a word and written a letter to
say it afterward; so he understood.</p>

<p>He kissed her again and said:</p>

<p>"You run along home now, and I'll telephone you when I have the
stable finished and the horse is here. Then you can come out in the
car and bring your dad and mother and Nannette and let them see
Chief and show them how you can ride him. I'll tell them that the
horse and fixtures are my gifts to you for saving me a lawsuit or
any disagreeable complications in, keeping my property. Will that
be all right?"</p>

<p>And Jean the versatile, Jean the ever ready to talk, Jean of the
school playground, of the diving raft, of the beaches and
mountains, of the picture studio, of city and country alike, turned
a small, quivering back, and silent, wordless, walked away.</p>

<p>Jamie went up to his door alone to find out what the premonition
had been that had kept him from bringing the child with him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22. The Magnificent
Lie</h2>

<p>As he unlatched the gate and went inside, Jamie noticed that the
front door was standing open. That meant that Margaret Cameron, who
had a key, was in the house putting things to rights. As he opened
the screen and passed through the door he was fairly sure that he
heard a low moaning. Swiftly he crossed the living room and stood
in his bedroom door. The first thing he saw was the bed, and spread
over it was a queer assortment of beads and pins and rings and
bracelets and combs, the little vanities of a girl of the day, and
lying open beside them was the marriage certificate he had not yet
examined closely himself. A little bundle showing life lay very
near to it, and on her knees beside the bed, her arms extended, her
hands gripped full of the beads and bracelets crouched Margaret
Cameron, so still that she seemed to be breathing only in faint
moans.</p>

<p>The drawers of the highboy were open and in a heap on top of it
lay Jamie's rolled socks and his shirts and underclothing, so he
knew that Margaret Cameron had been examining his wearing apparel,
hunting out the pieces that needed to be mended. Under his shirts
she had found the package that had been given to him at the
hospital. The story of what had happened to her and to him lay
spread before him, and it read like the plainest print. He could
see it all, with that certificate before him reading "Alice Louise
Cameron"&mdash;Lolly.</p>

<p>Before he moved, before Margaret became aware of his presence,
there was one thing Jamie had to do. He must make up his mind
whether he would tell her that he was legally married to the girl
she had idolized with the double devotion of a widowed mother. He
must tell her the truth, or he must five a he. He must stick to it
that the child was his and its name James Lewis MacFarlane. He
resolved that this was what he would be forced to do. But if he
made Margaret Cameron think that he had been married to Lolly, that
he had cared for her in any slight degree, that the child was his,
she would expect him to observe at least a period of mourning. And
he had already told her that he could not pretend to be in mourning
for the mother of the child, that he had scarcely known her. That
constituted the first difficulty he thought of. Jamie had to be
decent no matter at what price of mental suffering or physical
endurance, or to his purse. So he made his decision. He took one
step forward and reached out his arms.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "Mother Cameron," but he got no further.</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron, still gripping the beads and the bracelets,
pressed her hands against the bed to brace her and arose. She
turned toward him, but her face was no longer the set, hard face of
a woman in danger of losing her reason. It was a face broken,
lined, and creased with sorrow, but a face down which the blessed
tears of relief had rolled until the sources of grief were nearly
dried. Jamie was so surprised that he did not know what to say. It
was Margaret Cameron who spoke.</p>

<p>"Jamie," she said, "you needn't fix up any magnificent lie. You
needn't try to make me believe that you are the father of this
baby. You needn't try to make me believe that you ever went through
a marriage ceremony in person with my Alice Louise. You couldn't
have. You didn't know her. I am sure you never saw her. I don't
know where you ran into Molly. Down on the sands taking your sun
baths, most likely. And I don't know what you two fixed up between
you to try to save the situation, but I do know this: I know as
well as I am standing before you that Don was the boy Lolly loved.
If she ever was in trouble, it was Don. There wasn't any one else
she was accustomed to being with. There wasn't any one else she
loved with a self-effacing love. I can see now that all their lives
together they had cared for each other, and as I think about it, I
think there must have been some mistake in some way. I don't just
understand this clearly."</p>

<p>Jamie's arms closed around her.</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "it is true that I never saw your girl
until they sent for me to come to the hospital where that
certificate made them expect me to take the baby. I gave Molly the
right to use my name. She used it for Alice Louise. I think that
will help you to understand."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron stood still, clutching the pitiful little
strands of cheap beads and bracelets, the tears rolling down her
cheeks, her eyes fast on Jamie.</p>

<p>"Since Don is the father of the boy, I'd be glad to think the
best I can of him," she said, "and I'm glad to have the sore
feeling wiped out that I've carried in my heart against Molly for
months. I knew that she was at the bottom of helping Alice Louise
to go away, but, of course, I didn't know that she was doing it to
spare me, that she was trying frantically to fix some way that I
might be kept from knowledge that would hurt me so. I didn't know
that, but I know it now. There is only one thing that you can do
for me. There will be some legal complication maybe. Maybe Louise's
doctor can engineer it for you. Anyway, this baby isn't going to
bear your name. He shall not be James Lewis MacFarlane. He's going
to be Donald Cameron. I have surely got that much to say about it.
He's going on the records with his father's name, and, of course,
he is mine. Will you have his record changed for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will, if it is legally possible," said Jamie. "I'll
talk to the doctor and find out. I think very likely that he can
arrange matters as you wish without any great difficulty."</p>

<p>He went to Margaret Cameron and took the pitiful little relics
of her girl from her fingers and made them into a heap. The
marriage certificate he laid back in the drawer.</p>

<p>"I might need this," he explained, "in accomplishing what you
want done. The certificate and these things, I give you my word of
honour, I have not seen. I did not know, when I left the house this
morning, that it would make any difference if you did run on to
that package. I didn't know that I gave my name to help <i>your
girl</i> until I saw that certificate there on the bed when I came
in."</p>

<p>Jamie picked up the baby and the bundle and put his arm around
Margaret Cameron and helped her back to her home. As they went, he
tried to say to her everything he could think of that might be of
comfort, that might be of consolation. When they reached her living
room, she freed herself, took the little package he carried, laid
it on the table, and gently tucked the baby in his basket.</p>

<p>"Jamie," she said, "I'm thankful to you for your kindness of
heart and for your good intentions. I know you are trying to
comfort me, but at the present minute I happen to be a woman for
whom there is no comfort. It may be that in years to come I can
arrive at some sort of peace of mind concerning Lolly. It may be
that in years to come I can love her baby, can take him to my heart
and try to get some sort of comfort from him against old age, but
I'll tell you right now that it looks to me rather like a hopeless
proposition. It seems to me as if in taking the bit between their
teeth and running, the youngsters of the present day had, at least
in my case, met sickening disaster. Don was a fine chap and under
the pressure of necessity to get out and earn money and earn it
quickly that he might marry Lolly, he went to a job that dealt him
his death, and she spent her maternity period in torture.</p>

<p>"How she was tortured is attested by the fact that her health
was undermined until a function that should not have hurt her
permanently, killed her. That's two dead. Here's a baby without a
clear and legal right to a name, a brand of shame to hang over it
for the rest of its life in the knowledge of several people. Here's
Molly been tortured almost beyond endurance for months. And here am
I, who have lived my life and done the best I could, left to bow my
head to a blow that by no interpretation can be made into anything
except a shameful blow. All the rest of my days there is nothing
left for me but to go softly, to know that there is something that
I must hide, that I must keep secret, that never again can I lift
my head with the pride of the Camerons or the pride of my own
people. There's no use, Jamie. Go home, and if it turns out that
you and Molly learn to care for each other, don't get the cart
before the horse. Keep yourselves right before God and before the
law. Stand by the ancient pride of your race and your clan. Stand
by the laws of your country and the laws of your church and the
laws of God. It may sound like preaching, but who has better right
to preach than I, who have had two funerals on my hands, both
children I have reared in my own home and by whom I can swear
before the living God I did the very best I knew.</p>

<p>"And it was not enough. The youngsters thought they knew a
better way, and they disregarded me and left me, and I wish that
the good God would in some way make thousands of youngsters all
over the land who are thinking about trying the same way, oh, I
wish that the good God could show them the two dead faces that I
have seen so lately, dead in their youth, dead in their beauty,
gone out of life, gone out of love! Those children cannot face the
Master and answer anything but '<i>Guilty</i>,' and all the rest of
life for me I must bear the burden of their sin. I am right when I
say that with bowed head for the rest of my days I must walk
softly. Go home and leave me, Jamie. This is a thing I have to
fight out alone."</p>

<p>Jamie took the stricken woman in his arms and kissed her and
left her. There was nothing else he could do. What she had said was
true. There was no controverting it. There was no way to get around
it. There were no consoling words that he could speak. But he made
up his mind that with the young folks with whom he came in contact
he would try to use all the influence he might have on the side of
God's laws, of man's laws, of the natural laws of physical
cleanliness and decency.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23. Still Adventuring</h2>

<p>Through the rapidly falling darkness Jamie stumbled home. He
stumbled because there was a vision that filled his eyes to the
exclusion of everything else, even the walk upon which he trod. All
he could see was the lean, slender form of a girl with rounded
curves, with flushed cheeks, with wind-swept hair, with the fires
of indignation streaming from the brown-gray eyes as she rushed
down the beach in search of him. He reflected that possibly it was
well for him that she had not found him, that he might stand a
better chance with her if she had more time to reflect before he
tried to talk to her.</p>

<p>When he reached the bench under the jacqueranda, he dropped on
it and sat there, a bewildered and a broken man. He reflected that
he had run true to the well-known characteristic of the Scots. He
had bridled his anger and bided his time and waited long to strike.
Then, when he struck, he had struck too cruelly, too hard. There
was no use to try to imagine anything else, to think any other way.
The whole situation was open before him now. There was no one his
Storm Girl could be save Molly Cameron, the niece of his neighbour
and friend. There was no one she could be save the little Scout's
idolized teacher of Americanism, and he had witnessed what probably
was a picnic following the close of school with a group of the
young disciples. Vivid before him came the flock of little black
faces, the brown faces, the chocolate faces, the copper faces, the
red faces, of these children born in America to all the rights of
the American citizen. Then there came the absorbed face of the girl
who was accepting the situation as it was and making her
contribution toward the betterment and the safety of our land by
trying to mould and to utilize this strange material into forces
that in time would be called on to do their part to help sustain
and protect our government.</p>

<p>It seemed to Jamie in that hour that the men who had gone abroad
had done nothing nobler, nothing braver, nothing more worth while
than this girl was doing, this girl who was getting her fingers on
the very pulse of the situation, who was preparing these children
to carry to their homes the seeds that might flourish and grow into
mighty trees.</p>

<p>There would be no difficulty in finding his Storm Girl now. He
knew her name. All he had to do to locate her stopping place was to
ask Margaret Cameron. He realized, too, as he sat there in the
perfumed darkness with the glinting stars peeping through the lace
of the jacqueranda, sheeted for months at a stretch with bloom as
blue as the night sky, he realized for the first time precisely the
depth of agony that had filled the heart of the Storm Girl the
night she had come to him as he sat alone fighting his own battle
on the throne beside the sea. He had thought that he was dealing
with a wounded heart, broken over her own troubles. Now he realized
that what a girl, such as he knew Molly Cameron must be, would feel
for herself, was as nothing compared with what she must have felt
when she awakened to the galling realization that her twin brother,
the only near relative she had in the world, was responsible for
the anguish that was beating Alice Louise Cameron to the dust. The
certainty that Lolly in trouble would cost the reason, if not the
life, of the dear Aunt Margaret who had opened her home to them
when they were homeless, friendless, penniless, must have weighed
heavily on Molly's soul. Jamie could see how, in a vision of the
years, the Storm Girl would sense her obligation to a woman as fine
as Margaret Cameron, and he could see why she was frantic to the
point where she had resolved to throw herself into the undertow
because she could plan no escape, she could figure no way in which
to right the wrong that had been done, since a power that no law
can sway or divert had reached out and struck Donald down before he
had any chance to make the reparation that if he were ever so
little of a man he certainly would have made. Margaret had said
that he was not a bad boy, and it was her desire that his child
should bear his name.</p>

<p>Far into the night Jamie sat under the jacqueranda, and when at
last he began to be tortured by the aching of his bones from the
cold, he got up and went into the house. He lighted the fire and
sat down before it in a chair opposite the Bee Master's and
stretched his long legs to the comfort of the flames. With his
heart in turmoil and his brain whirling so that he could scarcely
think consecutively, with all his might he wished for the Bee
Master. He wished that Michael Worthington, who for so many years
had been the spirit and the life of that small house, could come
back to it, that he could sit for an hour in his accustomed chair
beside his hearthstone and counsel with him, help him to see the
light, tell him what he must do to make his peace with a girl so
unspeakably fine that Jamie had no way in which to say what he
thought of her.</p>

<p>That day, with brutal force, he had compelled her own hand to
write before the astonished eyes of her group of little people one
of the hatefullest words that can be found in any
language&mdash;not only to write it, but to re-write it and to
underscore it. He had struck it home as hard as he knew how to
strike, and then he had disappeared and left her to be seared with
a brand that probably was as repugnant to her soul as any form of
torture that could have been invented for her.</p>

<p>Jamie stared across at the vacant chair questioningly. He found
himself praying that the Bee Master would come. But he did not
come. The chair stood vacant. It was only in imagination that Jamie
could see the white head, the slender face, the big dark eyes, the
silken beard, and the slender, probing, delicate hands that
accompany sensitive and artistic natures. He did not come. Jamie
felt in his heart that he knew why he did not come. The Bee Master
would have been so much of a gentleman, he would have been so
refined by the crucial fires of his own suffering, he would have
been so tender, he never would have hurled that awful word at a
woman, he never would have forced her to brand her own heart with
it. What the Bee Master would have done would have been to say:
"Molly girl, things seem to make it appear that you haven't told
the truth, that you haven't played the game square; but since I
know you as I do, I know this cannot be true, so won't you explain
to me how things really were? What truly occurred?"</p>

<p>Now, it was not necessary for Jamie to be told anything. He had
learned all there was to know when he looked across the bowed head
of Margaret Cameron and the pitiful baubles her hands clutched, to
the open marriage certificate lying on the bed before her with his
name and that of her only child written upon it.</p>

<p>The gray of morning was beginning to creep in the windows when
the Keeper of the Bees threw himself on his bed without undressing
and fell into troubled sleep. He did not awaken until he heard
Margaret Cameron in the kitchen with his breakfast. Then he arose
and went out to her. She took one look at him and then she said:
"Jamie, you haven't been undressed, and I doubt if you've been
asleep all night!"</p>

<p>Jamie replied:</p>

<p>"Neither have you, Margaret, so you haven't any grounds upon
which to base your right to scold me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Margaret. "I've almost never been sick a day
in my life with real illness. I've no scar over my heart that must
be nursed with extreme care for months yet. I carry my scars where
the world can't probe into them."</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried Jamie. "Don't be bitter, Margaret. We don't know
why, we never can know why things hap pen in this world exactly as
they do; but this we know: We know that God is in His Heaven, that
He is merciful to the extent of ordaining mercy; we know that if we
disobey and take our own way and run contrary to His commandments,
we are bitterly punished. And it is the most pitiful of laws that
no man or woman can take their punishment <i>alone</i> in this
world. It is the law that none of us can suffer without making
someone else suffer, but in some way it must be that everything
works out for the best, even if we can't possibly see how that
could be when things are happening that hurt us so. I thought when
I arose and walked out of the hospital that I was embarking on a
Great Adventure all of my own. I got a great thrill out of standing
on my feet and doing what I pleased for a few days, out of taking
my own orders. Be fore we get through with what has happened to me,
it may prove that God told me to get up and walk out and test the
mercy of the road in order that I might be truly thankful when
shelter came to me; and it may be that He needed me here to offer
what comfort I could to a stricken girl heart in the days when
things were going so pitifully wrong for her."</p>

<p>Margaret Cameron was setting the breakfast things on the table
and the big tears were running down her cheeks, tears for which
Jamie was unspeakably thankful. Reason may be depended upon to keep
its balance when God gives the surcease of tears in time of
trouble.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jamie, "I'm going to eat my breakfast and take a
bath here at the house. Then I am going to dress myself the best I
can and go in search of Molly Cameron. You could do a very great
deal to make that search easier for me if you would give me her
address, if you would tell me where I might find her."</p>

<p>"How long is it," asked Margaret Cameron, "since you have known
Molly?"</p>

<p>"Almost ever since I've been here," said Jamie, "only please
understand that I didn't know that she was my 'next-door neighbour,
that she was your niece, until yesterday."</p>

<p>"There is this I can do," said Margaret Cameron. "I can call her
on the 'phone and ask her if she will be at home to-day and if you
may come to see her and at what hour she will see you."</p>

<p>"Would you be so kind as to do that?" asked Jamie.</p>

<p>Margaret sat down until Jamie finished his breakfast. Then he
walked over with her to carry back the things, ostensibly to see
little Donald, in reality to suggest the telephoning again and to
learn what the answer would be. When he did suggest it, Margaret
Cameron called two or three times and had no reply. The telephone
could be heard ringing distinctly at the other end of the line, so
they knew that Molly was not at home. Margaret said there was
nothing to do but to wait until she returned. So, in
disappointment, Jamie went home. Instead of bathing in the tub as
he had intended, he went down to the sea, and in its cold, saline
waters he drew some of the soreness and the tiredness from his
body. Then he lay on the hot sands and almost instantly fell
asleep.</p>

<p>He slept until nearly noon. Then he went back by way of Margaret
Cameron's, and this time he copied the telephone number and carried
it with him. He meant to keep the wires busy until he had a
response. After his first failure, he laid out the most attractive
clothing he could find among his own things and those he had been
given by the Bee Master. With more care than he ever before had
used, he selected the finest silk shirt of a delicate lavender with
a deeper-coloured tie to match. He put on the gray trousers and
black shoes and laid out the black coat. He had the feeling that he
wished to appear at his level best. There was enough on the record
against him that it behoved him to enhance his personal appearance
to the extent of his ability. He was standing in his shirt sleeves
before the highboy, carefully labouring with the tie he meant to
wear, when he heard the screen of the front door open and close and
then a clear voice, faintly burred with accents that he loved, call
"Keeper of the Bees, are you here?"</p>

<p>Jamie stepped to the bedroom door and across the living room
faced Molly Cameron. He was so taken aback he could not even say,
"Oh!" to indicate that he was surprised. He felt that he was crazy
for thinking that he detected a twinkle in the gray-brown eyes,
half a laugh twisting the red lips of the wide mouth. Molly
Cameron, in boots and breeches as she went afield, the bobbed hair
tumbling in the wind, her cheeks flushed with exercise, or was it
anger? stood before him.</p>

<p>But it could not have been anger, because so surely as he had
ever seen anything, Jamie MacFarlane saw laughter on Molly's face,
as she demanded: "Jamie MacFarlane, are you still firm in the
conviction that I'm a liar?"</p>

<p>Jamie reached out a pair of supplicating arms.</p>

<p>"Storm Girl," he said, "I am firm in the conviction that you're
most adorable. I have thought so all the time. I haven't been able
to believe, ever, not for a minute, that you could possibly have
needed me for your self, and now that I know you didn't, now that I
know your courage and your bravery, I haven't words for the
cowardly thing I did yesterday. Can you ever forgive me? Molly
Girl, can you ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>It did not seem quite possible that Molly Cameron was standing
in the doorway looking at him with an amused face, almost
laughing.</p>

<p>"In consideration of what has happened," she said, "in
consideration of how I used you to serve my own purposes&mdash;and
I will have to admit that I intended to deceive you; I meant you to
believe that I wanted help for myself when, all the time, I wanted
it for Lolly, and I wanted it so desperately, because of the debt
Don and I owed her mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, and the laughter had vanished.</p>

<p>"I've been over talking to Aunt Margaret," she continued, "and I
know now that you know all there is to be told about the situation
save one thing. There is one other thing that you <i>must</i> know.
Through some loss or delay in the mail, more than a month after Don
lost his life, I had a letter from him that was the only comfort
Lolly and I had during the bitter days when I had her hidden in my
rooms in the city and was managing letters for her to her mother,
supposed to be written in Sacramento. Of course, you will guess
that I made the arrangements at the hospital, and with our combined
earnings we paid the bills. I never thought that she could not
endure giving birth to her baby. I did not dream that she would
have to go, but I think <i>she</i> did because she insisted on
having arrangements made that provided for that contingency. We
shaped her letters so that Aunt Margaret would not be too much
surprised, and I thought we had everything fixed. And then Lolly
would take that certificate to the hospital with her. She was so
eaten up with shame, she just would have that where the doctors and
the nurses could see it. She was forced to offer proof because her
self-respect had been so endangered; she was so bitterly hurt; and
that's how it came that Aunt Margaret found it yesterday when she
went to look over your things to see what needed mending."</p>

<p>"You will believe," said Jamie, "that I had not opened that
packet. I did not know to whom you had turned over the certificate
and the ring. I did not know in whose name you had taken out the
license. I only knew when I reached the hospital that if I opened
my mouth to say that I never had seen the girl they led me to, I
might put her openly to the shame she had lost her life in enduring
alone, so I kept still even when the doctor rated me
scorchingly."</p>

<p>Molly Cameron extended her hands and advanced to the middle of
the room.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried. "Oh! that's a shame! But Lolly told her
nurse&mdash;I <i>heard</i> her tell her&mdash;that you were
wonderful, that you had been fine, that no other man would have
done one thing so fine as you did! I heard that!"</p>

<p>"The nurse stood up for me," said Jamie. "She told the doctor
things that made him apologize. Never mind that! It hasn't anything
to do, or rather, it has every thing to do, with what I did
yesterday."</p>

<p>Then Jamie advanced and opened his arms.</p>

<p>"Is there any hope at all, Storm Girl? Is there any hope at all,
Molly Cameron, that you can forgive me? And will you believe that
the wound that I carried that night on the rock, the wound that I
thought as surely as I think that God lives, would end me in a few
months at the extreme limit, will you believe that we have healed
it, your Aunt Margaret and I, with salt water and sunshine and a
careful diet? Will you believe that I am a whole man again, even if
my body is scarred? Will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jamie!" said Molly, "I never knew any Scotsman that could
talk so much! America has done something awful to you! You aren't a
<i>real</i> Scotsman at all! A real Scotsman would close up the few
steps between us and ask, 'Will ye?' and then take it for granted
that I would and get down to business!"</p>

<p>Jamie drew up his shoulders. He took one breath that went to the
depth of his lungs and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>By and by, when she could find breath for anything, Molly
Cameron twisted her head free and turned her face to the ceiling
and said:</p>

<p>"I weel. Whenever ye want me, I weel!"</p>

<p>And Jamie said:</p>

<p>"I want you right now, to-day if you say so, the very first
minute we can get to the License Bureau and get the legal
documents. I'm tired of adventuring. I want to settle down and
spend the rest of my life loving you and keeping bees."</p>

<p>"What's that License Bureau going to think," inquired Molly
Cameron, "if the same girl goes to it for another license under
another name in such a short time?"</p>

<p>With his arms tight around her, Jamie laughed down into her
eyes. "You leave that Bureau to me! It's got to be in charge of
someone that's human. I'll go and interview them, and I'll
guarantee that there won't any thing unpleasant occur when you
arrive. There have been times in my life when I have been able to
do quite a canny job of persuading people."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Molly Cameron, "I'll have to vouch for that
statement! I'll back you up as the greatest persuader I've ever
known! If you hadn't been such a persuader it never would have
occurred to me to let you in for all the annoyance that you have
suffered at my hands ever since the great storm."</p>

<p>"Don't you mind about annoyance or about my suffering at your
hands," said Jamie. "There's only one thing I want to know. Do you
understand right down in the depths of your heart that I never
could believe that you wanted that certificate and that ring and my
name for yourself?"</p>

<p>Molly Cameron looked him straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"Sure you couldn't!" she said. "Of course you couldn't! You're
enough of an outdoor man yourself to know the outdoor kind of a
girl when you meet her. Sure you wouldn't think a thing like that
about me!"</p>

<p>Then she put both arms around Jamie's neck and she had only a
short distance to draw his head before it was level with hers.</p>

<p>"What I think about you, Jamie MacFarlane," she said, "couldn't
be written in many books, but there is this I want to know before
you see that License Bureau. Are you going to let me go on, two or
three days a week, teaching Americanism? I'm just crazy about my
work! I think it's one of the most interesting jobs that any woman
in this country has today!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jamie; "of course I'm going to let you. I'm
going to let you do exactly what you please and I am going to go
with you and see how much assistance I can give in teaching
Americanism. I've had some fairly stiff training to fit me to teach
Americanism. There are a few things I know about the war end of the
game about as well as any man could know them. And there is one
question I want to ask you before we go to the License Bureau. I
want to know if we may have a Scotch Presbyterian minister to marry
us right here in this house that belongs to us? I want to know if
afterward you will go to church and to Sabbath School with me? I
want to know if we may have God and the atmosphere of religion in
our home? I want to know if our children may be born to an
inheritance that is like that bequeathed to me and, no doubt, to
you, by our own parents?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Molly Cameron. "Of course. I wouldn't want
things any other way, and I would dearly love to be married here in
the little house that is a shining monument to a man who was a
friend to both of us. I knew and loved the Bee Master, too. I have
read almost every book in his library. I've dusted his pictures and
his precious furniture. If he hadn't been stricken, you would have
met me here long ago."</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said Jamie, "that there are times when you have
been here anyway."</p>

<p>"Very few," said Molly. "I just couldn't keep away all the time,
Jamie lad. Ever since that night on the rock I've been unable to
make my heart behave at all whenever I thought of you. To tell the
plain truth, I love you! I love you, Jamie MacFarlane! I loved you
in the storm, and I love you here in the garden, and I even loved
you down on the beach yesterday when you had the nerve to let me
know what you really thought of me. I was pretty mad when I ran
after you, but just the same, when I got through speaking my piece,
if I had found you, I probably would have told you that I loved
you, dear Keeper of the Bees."</p>

<p>"Well, how come?" said a voice behind them, and Jamie and Molly
turned to see the little Scout standing in the doorway with wide
eyes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jean Meredith," said Jamie, suavely. "Come and see
what's happened in this family next!"</p>

<p>Jean Meredith walked in and set her hands at her waist line, and
with elbows akimbo and her head on one side, peered up at the
pair.</p>

<p>"Well, if anybody asked me," she said, "I'd say you are a fast
worker! I don't think it's a week yet since your wife died and here
you got Molly all cottoning up to you, just like Dad and Mother!
Can you beat it!"</p>

<p>"Not very well," said Jamie. "You will have to take it for
granted that there are some things in the world that such little
people as you don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well, don't take too much for granted," said Jean. "Maybe I
understand more than you think I do. Any way, you needn't think I
ever thought that little Jamie had a mother and she died and you
took him and walked away and left her. That ain't the way men act
when their wives die. That made a good story, but <i>you</i> can
tell it to the world. <i>I</i> ain't a-going to! It's a good deal
more sensible that you got Molly in your arms. I'll believe that
all right! If I was you, that's what I'd do. Say, is this stack of
lumber out here for Chief's stable?"</p>

<p>"It is," said Jamie.</p>

<p>"Well, then, hadn't we better get busy?"</p>

<p>Jamie smiled.</p>

<p>"Can't you give a man a day off?" he asked. "Don't you see that
when I get my coat on I'm all dressed up in my Sunday clothes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," said Jean, "but Molly ain't all dressed up in
<i>her</i> Sunday clothes, and <i>I</i> ain't all dressed up in my
Sunday clothes. The sensiblest thing you can do is to go and take
them things off and get into your working clothes and come on and
get to work on my stable. And besides that, if your ears wasn't all
gummed up you'd hear that there's about three swarms of bees on the
rampage, and one of them's mine, and two of 'em's yours. <i>I</i>
heard 'em way down the street."</p>

<p>Jamie hesitated, his mouth open, and looked at Molly Cameron.
Molly was Scotch only one remove herself.</p>

<p>"You must save the bees, of course!" she said. "Change to your
bee clothes and capture the swarms. If you want to celebrate, I
will go where I can dress and we'll celebrate this evening."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jamie, and went to his room.</p>

<p>It was while he was making a lightning change that he heard a
shrill whistle and looked out of his window in the direction from
which it came. He was in time to see the faces of Fat Ole Bill and
the Nice Child and Angel Face peering over the fence from the
vantage ground of the lumber pile, a row of faces forlorn past
description. It seemed that Jean Meredith's ears had been awake to
other sounds as well as the bees. Jamie watched her as she came
down the side of the house and started in the direction of the
call, looking precisely the same little Scout that he had known
from the beginning.</p>

<p>He opened the door and called softly to Molly: "Come see this.
The Scouts mutinied the other day and beat up the Scout Master and
almost broke her heart. Now they are calling her."</p>

<p>Together they stood at the window watching to see what would
happen.</p>

<p>Within a few yards of the fence Jean paused, hooked her thumbs
in her trousers' belt, and with an immobile face surveyed her
Scouts.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, tersely. "What do you want?" Fat Ole Bill
evidently had been elected spokesman.</p>

<p>He stood up and said, "Aw, come on! Let's go down on the beach
and play! We'll play Injuns or pirates or bandits, or whatever you
say!"</p>

<p>"<i>Yes</i>, you will!" said the former Scout Master with fine
sarcasm. "<i>Yes</i>, you will! After the way you served me the
other day! After the way you broke your sakerd oath! You're nice
Scouts, you are, taking a sakerd oath and then going back on it.
<i>Yes</i>, I'll <i>never</i> come with you again!"</p>

<p>Then the Nice Child brought the battery of black eyes into full
play.</p>

<p>"Aw, come on!" he pleaded. "Ain't nothin' no fun without
<i>you!</i> We didn't know you thought up everythin'. Honest we
didn't! We didn't know we did what you told us to. We just stand
around and look at each other like three fat-headed fools. We ain't
had no fun since we acted so mean. Aw, come on! We won't do it any
more! We're awful sorry. Ain't we, Ole Bill? Ain't we, Angel Face?
Ain't we awful sorry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angel Face, "we are awful sorry. We apologize. It's
like both of 'em says. We ain't havin' any fun. Won't you please
come on? You can be the Limit again. Won't none of us say a
word."</p>

<p>Jamie's shoulders lifted; his chest drew in. He leaned forward
and rested his hands on the window sill and brought his face level
with the child's head. He opened his lips and then waited a second
to be sure. But there was no hesitation whatever on the part of
Jean Meredith; she slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>"You might as well go on and think up something you can do. Do
all the things that we used to do over, and do them better," she
said. "I'm <i>through</i>. I ain't risking no more of what you give
me the other day! This morning when I was brushing my teeth, I saw
the calendar and it's the thirty-first. I ain't going back to risk
a lickin' from three boys after this only on the thirty-second of
the month! You get me? You can just go on! I'm not afraid of you. I
can lick any of you yet, or I can lick all of you. I'm not afraid
of you. I'm just <i>done</i> with you. Anyway, them boards you are
standing on are to make Chief a stable and I'm going to do the
stunts that Scout Camp Number Twenty-two is doing. I'm
<i>through</i> with <i>make-believe</i>. I'm going to be a
<i>real</i> Scout after this, and I'm going to ride a horse and I'm
going to carry a crop and hit him a crack if he goes to back over
too steep a place. But I ain't a-goin' to hit him any other time.
But I ain't a-goin' to hit anything else <i>that ain't big and
strong as I am</i>. Laugh <i>that</i> off! I'm through!'</p>

<p>Jean Meredith turned on her heel, hitched up her trousers, and
marched in the direction of the back porch. The Keeper of the Bees,
leaning on the window sill, tightened his arm around the Storm Girl
and studied the face of Jean as she came toward him. The lines of
it were unalterably set.</p>

<p>"She means it! She'll stick!" said Molly Cameron.</p>

<p>And Jamie hugged her tight and said, "Amen!"</p>
