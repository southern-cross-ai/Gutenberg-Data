<p style="text-indent:0">THEY were the brawlers and braggarts, the
loud boasters and hard drinkers, of Faring town, John Kulrek and
his crony Lie-lip Canool. Many a time have I, a tousle-haired lad,
stolen to the tavern door to listen to their curses, their profane
arguments and wild sea songs; half fearful and half in admiration
of these wild rovers. Aye, all the people of Faring town gazed on
them with fear and admiration, for they were not like the rest of
the Faring men; they were not content to ply their trade along the
coasts and among the shark-teeth shoals. No yawls, no skiffs for
them! They fared far, farther than any other man in the village,
for they shipped on the great sailing-ships that went out on the
white tides to brave the restless grey ocean and make ports in
strange lands.</p>

<p>Ah, I mind it was swift times in the little sea-coast village of
Faring when John Kulrek came home, with the furtive Lie-lip at his
side, swaggering down the gang-plank, in his tarry sea-clothes, and
the broad leather belt that held his ever-ready dagger; shouting
condescending greeting to some favored acquaintance, kissing some
maiden who ventured too near; then up the street, roaring some
scarcely decent song of the sea. How the cringers and the idlers,
the hangers-on, would swarm about the two desperate heroes,
flattering and smirking, guffawing hilariously at each nasty jest.
For to the tavern loafers and to some of the weaker among the
straightforward villagers, these men with their wild talk and their
brutal deeds, their tales of the Seven Seas and the far countries,
these men, I say, were valiant knights, nature's noblemen who dared
to be men of blood and brawn.</p>

<p>And all feared them, so that when a man was beaten or a woman
insulted, the villagers muttered&mdash;and did nothing. And so when
Moll Farrell's niece was put to shame by John Kulrek, none dared
even to put into words what all thought. Moll had never married,
and she and the girl lived alone in a little hut down close to the
beach, so close that in high tide the waves came almost to the
door.</p>

<p>The people of the village accounted old Moll something of a
witch, and she was a grim, gaunt old dame who had little to say to
anyone. But she minded her own business, and eked out a slim living
by gathering clams, and picking up bits of driftwood.</p>

<p>The girl was a pretty, foolish little thing, vain and easily
befooled, else she had never yielded to the shark-like
blandishments of John Kulrek.</p>

<p>I mind the day was a cold winter day with a sharp breeze out of
the east when the old dame came into the village street shrieking
that the girl had vanished. All scattered over the beach and back
among the bleak inland hills to search for her&mdash;all save John
Kulrek and his cronies who sat in the tavern dicing and toping. All
the while beyond the shoals, we heard the never-ceasing droning of
the heaving, restless grey monster, and in the dim light of the
ghostly dawn Moll Farrell's girl came home.</p>

<p>The tides bore her gently across the wet sands and laid her
almost at her own door. Virgin-white she was, and her arms were
folded across her still bosom; calm was her face, and the grey
tides sighed about her slender limbs. Moll Farrell's eyes were
stones, yet she stood above her dead girl and spoke no word till
John Kulrek and his crony came reeling down from the tavern, their
drinking-jacks still in their hands. Drunk was John Kulrek, and the
people gave back for him, murder in their souls; so he came and
laughed at Moll Farrell across the body of her girl.</p>

<p>"Zounds!" swore John Kulrek; "the wench has drowned herself,
Lie-lip!"</p>

<p>Lie-lip laughed, with the twist of his thin mouth. He always
hated Moll Farrell, for it was she that had given him the name of
Lie-lip.</p>

<p>Then John Kulrek lifted his drinking-jack, swaying on his
uncertain legs. "A health to the wench's ghost!" he bellowed, while
all stood aghast.</p>

<p>Then Moll Farrell spoke, and the words broke from her in a
scream which sent ripples of cold up and down the spines of the
throng.</p>

<p>"The curse of the Foul Fiend upon you, John Kulrek!" she
screamed. "The curse of God rest upon your vile soul throughout
eternity! May you gaze on sights that shall sear the eyes of you
and scorch the soul of you! May you die a bloody death and writhe
in hell's flames for a million and a million and yet a million
years! I curse you by sea and by land, by earth and by air, by the
demons of the swamplands, the fiends of the forest and the goblins
of the hills! And you"&mdash;her lean finger stabbed at Lie-lip
Canool and he started backward, his face paling&mdash;"you shall be
the death of John Kulrek and he shall be the death of you! You
shall bring John Kulrek to the doors of hell and John Kulrek shall
bring you to the gallows-tree! I set the seal of death upon your
brow, John Kulrek! You shall live in terror and die in horror far
out upon the cold grey sea! But the sea that took the soul of
innocence to her bosom shall not take you, but shall fling forth
your vile carcass to the sands! Aye, John Kulrek"&mdash;and she
spoke with such a terrible intensity that the drunken mockery on
the man's face changed to one of swinish stupidity&mdash;"the sea
roars for the victim it will not keep! There is snow upon the
hills, John Kulrek, and ere it melts your corpse will lie at my
feet. And I shall spit upon it and be content."</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Kulrek and his crony sailed at dawn for a long voyage, and Moll
went back to her hut and her clam-gathering. She seemed to grow
leaner and more grim than ever and her eyes smoldered with a light
not sane. The days glided by and people whispered among themselves
that Moll's days were numbered, for she faded to a ghost of a
woman; but she went her way, refusing all aid.</p>

<p>That was a short, cold summer and the snow on the barren inland
hills never melted; a thing very unusual, which caused much comment
among the villagers. At dusk and at dawn Moll would come up on the
beach, gaze up at the snow which glittered on the hills, then out
to sea with a fierce intensity in her gaze.</p>

<p>Then the days grew shorter, the nights longer and darker, and
the cold grey tides came sweeping along the bleak strands, bearing
the rain and sleet of the sharp east breezes.</p>

<p>And upon a bleak day a trading-vessel sailed into the bay and
anchored. And all the idlers and the wastrels flocked to the
wharfs, for that was the ship upon which John Kulrek and Lie-lip
Canool had sailed. Down the gang-plank came Lie-lip, more furtive
than ever, but John Kulrek was not there.</p>

<p>To shouted queries, Canool shook his head. "Kulrek deserted ship
at a port of Sumatra," said he. "He had a row with the skipper,
lads; wanted me to desert, too, but no! I had to see you fine lads
again, eh boys?"</p>

<p>Almost cringing was Lie-lip Canool, and suddenly he recoiled as
Moll Farrell came through the throng. A moment they stood eyeing
each other; then Moll's grim lips bent in a terrible smile.</p>

<p>"There's blood on your hand, Canool!" she lashed out
suddenly&mdash;so suddenly that Lie-lip started and rubbed his
right hand across his left sleeve.</p>

<p>"Stand aside, witch!" he snarled in sudden anger, striding
through the crowd which gave back for him. His admirers followed
him to the tavern.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Now, I mind that the next day was even colder; grey fogs came
drifting out of the east and veiled the sea and the beaches. There
would be no sailing that day, and so all the villagers were in
their snug houses or matching tales at the tavern. So it came that
Joe, my friend, a lad of my own age, and I, were the ones who saw
the first of the strange things that happened.</p>

<p>Being harum-scarum lads of no wisdom, we were sitting in a small
rowboat, floating at the end of the wharfs, each shivering and
wishing the other would suggest leaving, there being no reason
whatever for our being there, save that it was a good place to
build air-castles undisturbed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joe raised his hand. "Say," he said, "d'ye hear? Who
can be out on the bay upon a day like this?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. What d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Oars. Or I'm a lubber. Listen."</p>

<p>There was no seeing anything in that fog, and I heard nothing.
Yet Joe swore he did, and suddenly his face assumed a strange
look.</p>

<p>"Somebody rowing out there, I tell you! The bay is alive with
oars from the sound! A score of boats at the least! Ye dolt, can ye
not hear?"</p>

<p>Then, as I shook my head, he leaped and began to undo the
painter.</p>

<p>"I'm off to see. Name me liar if the bay is not full of boats,
all together like a close fleet. Are you with me?"</p>

<p>Yes, I was with him, though I heard nothing. Then out in the
greyness we went, and the fog closed behind and before so that we
drifted in a vague world of smoke, seeing naught and hearing
naught. We were lost in no time, and I cursed Joe for leading us
upon a wild goose chase that was like to end with our being swept
out to sea. I thought of Moll Farrell's girl and shuddered.</p>

<p>How long we drifted I know not. Minutes faded into hours, hours
into centuries. Still Joe swore he heard the oars, now close at
hand, now far away, and for hours we followed them, steering our
course toward the sound, as the noise grew or receded. This I later
thought of, and could not understand.</p>

<p>Then, when my hands were so numb that I could no longer hold the
oar, and the forerunning drowsiness of cold and exhaustion was
stealing over me, bleak white stars broke through the fog which
glided suddenly away, fading like a ghost of smoke, and we found
ourselves afloat just outside the mouth of the bay. The waters lay
smooth as a pond, all dark green and silver in the starlight, and
the cold came crisper than ever. I was swinging the boat about, to
put back into the bay, when Joe gave a shout, and for the first
time I heard the clack of oar-locks. I glanced over my shoulder and
my blood went cold.</p>

<p>A great beaked prow loomed above us, a weird, unfamiliar shape
against the stars, and as I caught my breath, sheered sharply and
swept by us, with a curious swishing I never heard any other craft
make. Joe screamed and backed oars frantically, and the boat walled
out of the way just in time; for though the prow missed us, still
otherwise we had died. For from the sides of the ship stood long
oars, bank upon bank which swept her along. Though I had never seen
such a craft, I knew her for a galley. But what was she doing upon
our coasts? They said, the far-farers, that such ships were still
in use among the heathens of Barbary; but it was many a long,
heaving mile to Barbary, and even so she did not resemble the ships
described by those who had sailed far.</p>

<p>We started in pursuit, and this was strange, for though the
waters broke about her prow, and she seemed fairly to fly through
the waves, yet she was making little speed, and it was no time
before we caught up with her. Making our painter fast to a chain
far back beyond the reach of the swishing oars, we hailed those on
deck. But there came no answer, and at last, conquering our fears,
we clambered up the chain and found ourselves upon the strangest
deck man has trod for many a long, roaring century.</p>

<p>"This is no Barbary rover!" Joe muttered fearsomely. "Look, how
old it seems! Almost ready to fall to pieces. Why, 'tis fairly
rotten!"</p>

<p>There was no one on deck, no one at the long sweep with which
the craft was steered. We stole to the hold and looked down the
stair. Then and there, if ever men were on the verge of insanity,
it was we. For there were rowers there, it is true; they sat upon
the rowers' benches and drove the creaking oars through the grey
waters. <i>And they that rowed were skeletons!</i></p>

<p>Shrieking, we plunged across the deck, to fling ourselves into
the sea. But at the rail I tripped upon something and fell
headlong, and as I lay, I saw a thing which vanquished my fear of
the horrors below for an instant. The thing upon which I had
tripped was a human body, and in the dim grey light that was
beginning to steal across the eastern waves I saw a dagger hilt
standing up between his shoulders. Joe was at the rail, urging me
to haste, and together we slid down the chain and cut the
painter.</p>

<p>Then we stood off into the bay. Straight on kept the grim
galley, and we followed, slowly, wondering. She seemed to be
heading straight for the beach beside the wharfs, and as we
approached, we saw the wharfs thronged with people. They had missed
us, no doubt, and now they stood, there in the early dawn light,
struck dumb by the apparition which had come up out of the night
and the grim ocean.</p>

<p>Straight on swept the galley, her oars a-swish; then ere she
reached the shallow water&mdash;crash!&mdash;a terrific
reverberation shook the bay. Before our eyes the grim craft seemed
to melt away; then she vanished, and the green waters seethed where
she had ridden, but there floated no driftwood there, nor did there
ever float any ashore. Aye, something floated ashore, but it was
grim driftwood!</p>

<p>We made the landing amid a hum of excited conversation that
stopped suddenly. Moll Farrell stood before her hut, limned gauntly
against the ghostly dawn, her lean hand pointing sea-ward. And
across the sighing wet sands, borne by the grey tide, something
came floating; something that the waves dropped at Moll Farrell's
feet. And there looked up at us, as we crowded about, a pair of
unseeing eyes set in a still, white face. John Kulrek had come
home.</p>

<p>Still and grim he lay, rocked by the tide, and as he lurched
sideways, all saw the dagger hilt that stood from his
back&mdash;the dagger all of us had seen a thousand times at the
belt of Lie-lip Canool.</p>

<p>"Aye, I killed him!" came Canool's shriek, as he writhed and
groveled before our gaze. "At sea on a still night in a drunken
brawl I slew him and hurled him overboard! And from the far seas he
has followed me"&mdash;his voice sank to a hideous
whisper&mdash;"because&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;curse&mdash;the&mdash;sea&mdash;would&mdash;not&mdash;keep&mdash;his&mdash;body!"</p>

<p>And the wretch sank down, trembling, the shadow of the gallows
already in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Aye!" Strong, deep and exultant was Moll Farrell's voice. "From
the hell of lost craft Satan sent a ship of bygone ages! A ship red
with gore and stained with the memory of horrid crimes! None other
would bear such a vile carcass! The sea has taken vengeance and has
given me mine. See now, how I spit upon the face of John
Kulrek."</p>

<p>And with a ghastly laugh, she pitched forward, the blood
starting to her lips. And the sun came up across the restless
sea.</p>
