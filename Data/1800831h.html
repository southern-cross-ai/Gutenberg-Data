<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. THE KNEELING CUPID</h2>

<p>THE lisping young exquisite in sulphur-coloured silk smiled
tolerant disdain, whilst from the group behind him came sounds of a
titter ill-suppressed.</p>

<p>"And so you pronounce yourself an artist, eh?" he said. "An
artist! It is a rare and admirable thing to be. It needs courage
that a man should pronounce himself one; great industry and
achievement before others will so pronounce him."</p>

<p>His irony was not to be mistaken. It brought a faint colour into
the gaunt, sallow cheeks of the victim, a young man of not more
than three-and-twenty, tall and vigorous, whose face, though bony
and rugged, was yet handsome in a rough, masterful way. A thick
mane of lustrous black hair curled about his brow and fell in short
waves to the nape of his powerful neck; his great eyes, deep-set
under a massive brow, glowed with the ever-smouldering fires of a
nature passionate in all things. He was dressed in black, but with
an elegance which proclaimed that his presence here in the great
Cardinal's antechamber was by no means his first experience of
courts. Rich fur trimmed his close-fitting doublet and lined the
ample surcoat so loosely worn; a chain of silver, massively wrought
and of exquisite workmanship served him for a girdle and hung the
heavy Pistoja dagger on his hip.</p>

<p>He would willingly have drawn it now, to sheathe the blade in
the windpipe of that smirking young gentleman in yellow. But,
though passionate, he could, within certain limits, be patient, and
prudently he dissembled the ferocious lust. He answered quietly:
"Others have so pronounced me already&mdash;generously. But not
perhaps more generously than my work deserved, Messer
Gianluca."</p>

<p>Gianluca Sforza-Riario, the fair youth in yellow, led a burst of
laughter, which drew the attention of other clients thronging the
long pillared gallery.</p>

<p>"You were well-advised, Messer Buonarroti, to come to Rome. Here
you will certainly succeed. No artistic reticence will restrain you
from bawling your wares in the marketplace, and here success comes
to him who bawls loudest, thus imposing upon the vulgar,
undiscriminating herd. Oh, you will find men enough in Rome who, to
their shame, are growing fat on art. The patronage of the ignorant
enriches them. So may it fare with you, good sir."</p>

<p>Still the young artist kept his temper, though his hands might
itch.</p>

<p>"Sir, it is possible that you mistake my quality. It happens
that until now I have had no patron but one, and he was not a man
whom any could call ignorant&mdash;Lorenzo, the great Lorenzo de'
Medici. Had he lived, I should never have left Florence."</p>

<p>"Lorenzo de' Medici." Gianluca's eyebrows rose until they almost
joined the yellow thatch above his shallow brow. "You will not tell
me that Lorenzo de' Medici knew anything of art?"</p>

<p>Young Buonarroti gasped for breath. "How, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ser Michelangelo, it is my desire to think well of you; but if
you praise me the artistic perceptions of Duke Lorenzo you will
render that impossible. A man of crude taste, leaning to the
meretricious, to...to trivial things designed to trap the senses
of...of just such men."</p>

<p>That was but the beginning. Continuing, the aesthetic Messer
Gianluca delivered himself at great length and in the choicest
terms of an address upon art, under which young Michelangelo felt
himself grow faint with wonder. Such great contemporaries as
Pinturicchio and Verocchio were tolerantly commended, which is to
say that this critic damned them with faint praise; others as great
were contemptuously dismissed&mdash;especially the prosperous ones,
prosperity being in the eyes of Messer Gianluca the seal of
worthlessness. Of the younger men the only one in whom he admitted
possibilities was Leonardo da Vinci; but he confessed to grave
misgivings concerning even him; he doubted if that young man's
talents would mature along praiseworthy lines; he feared that he
might succumb to work for profit, and thereby damn himself
eternally as an artist.</p>

<p>Nauseated, Michelangelo fled the gallery and the palace, and
began to ask himself should he not flee Rome as well, cursing the
evil hour which had brought him to this city of self-sufficient
fools.</p>

<p>You know the story of his boyhood; how at the age of fourteen he
was apprenticed for a term of three years to the great Florentine
painter, Domenico Ghirlandajo; how before the end of that term he
had been drawn from painting to sculpture, and how he had modelled
a Laughing Faun which had caught the discerning eye of the
Magnificent Lorenzo. The Duke had haled the lad out of the
workshops of Messer Ghirlandajo and had installed him in the ducal
palace. And young Buonarroti, uplifted and stimulated by this
splendid patronage, had justified his noble patron's judgment. It
was in this period of his adolescence that he produced his
Centaurs, a work the consideration of which in after life caused
him so profoundly to deplore that he should ever again have turned
aside from sculpture to waste his time on painting. Yet it was
during some of the time thus wasted that he painted the Sistine
Chapel, and therein accomplished one of the artistic marvels of the
ages. That, however, is a digression.</p>

<p>He was barely twenty when Lorenzo died. Piero de' Medici, who
succeeded him, discovered in crudest materialism all that he
required of life. There was an end to the patronage of artists in
Florence. Michelangelo found himself out of employment. Casting
about him, he lent an ear to the tales of the great opportunities
afforded by the Papal Court under the prodigal and lavish Borgia
Pontiff, and of the great interest in art that was being quickened
in Rome by the excavations which were daily bringing such treasures
of antiquity to light.</p>

<p>Lured by these stories, Buonarroti set out for the eternal city,
armed with a letter of introduction from Piero de' Medici to
Cardinal Sforza-Riario, who was widely famed as a dilettante, a
collector, and a patron of the arts. Through the good offices of
this exalted prince of the Church, Michelangelo hoped that he might
reach even the foot of the papal throne.</p>

<p>So far, however, he had spent a month in vain solicitings, daily
cooling his heels in the great man's antechamber whilst hoping ever
more desperately for the audience in which he might present his
letter, nauseated meanwhile by the atmosphere of the place and
discussions upon art akin to that into which he had just been
drawn. He began to realize that he was moving in a world of
posturing dilettanti, of pretentious witlings, to whom mere
performance in art was naught. True artistic greatness, perception
and achievement, it seemed, were to be established only by a
capacity for judging the work of others, and judgment usually was
based upon standards that were wholly&mdash;almost it seemed
deliberately&mdash;false.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, idleness and the wasted days began to fret him. Also
he perceived that at this rate his meagre store of money would soon
be exhausted. Therefore of late he had been turning his attention
to immediate needs. He had modelled a dancing nymph, a thing of
infinite grace and liveliness, although the subject was not perhaps
one to which at that age he would naturally have turned. It
afforded no scope for the vigorous anatomy which he loved to
reproduce. The choice was entirely meretricious. He conceived that
he fashioned something calculated to please these lascivious
Romans, whose aesthetic sense had been emasculated by an excessive
worship of smooth antiquities, particularly the Greek. He bore
it&mdash;still in the clay, since in those days he had no workshop
in which to effect the transmutation&mdash;to one Baldassare della
Balza, who kept a shop on the Ripa Vecchia, overlooking Tiber.</p>

<p>Many times he had passed the shop, on his way to the
Sforza-Riario place, in the Rione di Ponte, and invariably he had
paused to study the sculptures exhibited, ancient and modern, in
marble, in bronze, in lead, and some in baked clay. But this was
the first time that he ventured to cross the threshold in his
quality as a sculptor.</p>

<p>He was well received, his nymph commending him to one as shrewd
and critical as Baldassare della Balza. This dealer, an untidy,
gabardined, elderly man with long, greasy locks of grizzled hair,
straggling beard and a pendulous nose that betrayed his Semitic
origin, avoided confinement to a ghetto simply by proclaiming
himself a Christian, and was left in peace to pursue his trade by
the tolerant Roman government of Borgia days.</p>

<p>"The work is good&mdash;very, very good," he deliberately and
generously pronounced it. "So good that I do not know a sculptor
working now who could do better. And that is much to say,
particularly to so young a man. But if I buy..."&mdash;he spread
his hands, and looked up with sorrowful eyes&mdash;"where shall I
find me a buyer in my turn?"</p>

<p>To Michelangelo this seemed a foolish question.</p>

<p>"Surely among your patrons there will be some who know good work
and desire to possess it. How else could you live and drive your
trade?"</p>

<p>The little dealer answered him by a cackle of sardonic mirth. He
swung round. From a shelf behind him he snatched a marble Hermes,
standing some two feet high, and placed it on the table before the
young artist.</p>

<p>"Is not that a thing of beauty?" he demanded. "Is it not good
work?"</p>

<p>It was good work indeed, a figure not only of entrancingly
graceful proportions but so full of arrested movement as to seem
almost alive. Michelangelo's admiring eyes devoured it, his long
delicate fingers caressed it lovingly.</p>

<p>"Superb," he murmured. "The work of a master, my friend."</p>

<p>"Of one who will become a master," the dealer corrected. "At
present he is young, like yourself, able and eager, gifted with wit
to invent, eyes to see, and fingers to reproduce&mdash;a great
artist, a great craftsman. His name is Torrigiano. If he lives that
name will one day be famous."</p>

<p>"If he lives?" quoth Michelangelo.</p>

<p>"Just so. If he does not meanwhile die of starvation, as well he
may. Eleven months has this lovely thing stood in my shop. To each
of my patrons in turn have I shown it&mdash;to the great Cardinal
Ascanio, to the Princess of Squillace, to the Lord of Mirandola,
who has great taste and knowledge, to the young Duke of Gandia, to
Cardinal Sforza-Riario, who prides himself upon his judgment and
whose collection of sculpture is the greatest in Rome. I have
implored them to offer me any price in reason. But...this thing of
beauty remains to grace my shop, whilst a hundred inferior things
are sold, simply because they are old&mdash;antiquities dug out of
the earth. I tell you, sir, there is no vision among these
collectors. Men have gone mad in this matter of antiquities; they
have lost all sense of real values. Over these remains of other
days they wax lavishly and indiscriminately enthusiastic, and the
work of young artists like yourself, even when it is as good as
this your nymph or this noble Hermes, remains neglected and
despised." Contempt increased in Baldassare's voice. "The truth is,
they know nothing, these people, and their ignorance leers
foolishly through their pretence of knowledge. I am sorry, my young
sir. Your nymph is worthy to stand beside this Hermes; but it would
stand beside it just as idly. If I cannot sell the one, be sure
that I could not sell the other."</p>

<p>Michelangelo departed sick at heart and in some indignation; he
was angry with these empty, pretentious Romans; angry with himself
that he should have left Florence merely to be lectured upon art by
the fools who thronged the antechamber of the illustrious
Sforza-Riario, that renowned patron of art who could pass
indifferently by such a piece of work as the Hermes of Torrigiano.
Clearly this man upon whose patronage Michelangelo had been
depending could be no better than the rest, no better than those
posturing clowns who chattered so glibly in his antechamber. To
what end, then, he asked himself, did he remain in Rome? Above her
gates for such as he should be inscribed the line of Dante's above
the gates of Hell: "Abandon every hope, O you that enter."</p>

<p>Upon that bitter thought he suddenly checked, there in the
narrow unpaved street. And then upon another thought that was born
of it, he swung round, and went in great strides back to the shop
of Baldassare.</p>

<p>"Sir," he asked, "has it never occurred to you in the pursuit of
this trade of yours, that fools were born into the world to be
turned to account by men of worth?"</p>

<p>Baldassare smiled gently as he rubbed his plump hands. "I have
suspected it," he confessed. "Sometimes even I may have found my
profit in it. What then?"</p>

<p>Instinctively Michelangelo drew nearer and lowered his voice.
Anger and scorn vibrated in his every word. But of those emotions
Baldassare took little heed. Emotion he knew to be unprofitable. To
the actual matter of the young artist's utterance, however, his
mind was entirely given, and as he listened he continued to smile
and to rub his hands, occasionally nodding his approval.</p>

<p>"What a dealer you would have made had not the good God made you
a sculptor," Baldassare commended him when at last they parted, and
than this the little Jew could hardly have bestowed higher praise
upon him.</p>

<p>But since Michelangelo did not see eye to eye with him in this,
he had no thought of quitting the precarious path of art for the
more secure ways of trade; and as week succeeded week, he was still
daily to be seen in the antechamber of Cardinal Sforza-Riario,
awaiting that interview which it seemed would never be vouchsafed
him. And almost daily was he baited by the Cardinal's nephew and
those other elegant loungers. But he had grown inured to their
veiled taunts and open sneers. He smiled, and rarely troubled to
strike back, nor was anger ever more than momentarily kindled in
those great dark eyes of his.</p>

<p>One day a life-sized Antinous made its appearance&mdash;a new
acquisition of the Cardinal's of which he was so inordinately proud
that he proposed for a season to leave it in his ante-room, where
it could be more generally seen and admired than in the gallery set
apart for his collection.</p>

<p>Michelangelo came to admire it with the rest, but soberly,
without transports such as all were indulging. Messer Gianluca
delivered to the young artist, and to all the others who stood
respectfully listening, a lengthy and learned dissertation upon the
aesthetics of the work.</p>

<p>In the end he turned to Buonarroti.</p>

<p>"And what," he asked, with that faint sneering superior smile of
his, "is your own judgment, Messer the sculptor?"</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful," was the quiet answer. "Indeed its fault
is that it is too beautiful."</p>

<p>"Its fault?" Gianluca's voice grew shrill. "Can excess of
perfection be a fault?"</p>

<p>"Excess of perfection is always a fault," Michelangelo
dogmatized. "There is no vice so horrible as excess of virtue."</p>

<p>"You deliver the treasures of your judgment in the form of
paradoxes. Their meaning may well elude such humble wits as ours."
An approving purr commended the suavity of Messer Gianluca's
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"I'll endeavour to be plain. This thing is beautiful, but as a
woman is beautiful rather than a man. It is of an exceeding
smoothness. The delineation of the anatomy is without force. The
face is perfect; too perfect for significance; a man with so lovely
a countenance may be a beast, or a fool, or both; he can hardly be
aught else. Is that what the sculptor intended? I doubt it. The
limbs lack vigour; the musculature is too vague; they are a woman's
limbs."</p>

<p>"Ah, but listen, listen all, I beg!" shrilled Gianluca. "An
artistic Daniel is delivering judgment. And his canon, it seems, is
that art is to express only brawn and thews."</p>

<p>Sycophantic laughter drowned Michelangelo's answer, and drove
him in anger from the place. For a whole day he fumed, fingering
the hilt of his dagger, and in imagination enjoying the delight of
thrusting the blade into Gianluca's windpipe. Violence he swore was
the only argument to use with these imbeciles, never suspecting how
well Gianluca's mockery was serving him at that very moment. For
the young man, flushed with the victory he accounted his own in
that wordy encounter, went with the tale of it to his illustrious
uncle. Into the ear of His Excellency&mdash;the title of Eminence
had not yet come into use&mdash;he poured the absurd story of this
presumptuous young Florentine who haunted the cardinalitial
threshold in the hope of audience. He spoke almost with heat of the
man's egregious vanity, of his effrontery, so great that he dared
to pronounce an adverse judgment upon the matchless Antinous.
Together uncle and nephew laughed over the man's ridiculous
pretensions&mdash;as interpreted by Gianluca.</p>

<p>"Decidedly," said the Cardinal, "I must receive this fellow. It
may be amusing, and it is possible that I may afford him artistic
salvation."</p>

<p>And so when next, in accordance with his habit, the young
Florentine lounged into that now too familiar antechamber, a
chamberlain in black velvet advanced to inquire was he Messer
Michelangelo Buonarroti of Florence, bearer of a letter to the
illustrious Cardinal Sforza-Riario from Duke Piero? And when young
Buonarroti, a little sceptical of this sudden conclusion of his
purgatorial term, eagerly acknowledged the identity, he was
respectfully ushered into a small room, with gilded walls and an
ultramarine ceiling, lighted by a single window beside which there
was a richly carved writing pulpit. At this was seated the
illustrious Cardinal&mdash;a tall, thin man whose countenance
derived asceticism from its startling pallor. The story ran that,
present at the murder of Giuliano de' Medici in the Cathedral of
Florence, he had been permanently stricken white with horror.</p>

<p>His narrow eyes looked with assumed benignity upon this young
sculptor, who bent the knee to him. He held out a white emaciated
hand, on which glowed the sapphire of his rank, and Michelangelo
humbly kissed it as his duty was.</p>

<p>"I have just learnt from my nephew Gianluca of the long trial of
your patience here," said a cold, level voice. "I should earlier
have been informed of your presence."</p>

<p>Michelangelo, mumbling amiabilities, proffered his letter.
Motioning his visitor to rise, the Cardinal broke the seal, and
spread the sheet. He reclined in his capacious, high-backed chair
to read the commendations of Duke Piero, and as he read his thin
lips curled a little. When he looked over the top of the sheet at
the young artist, there seemed a certain wistfulness in his
glance.</p>

<p>"His Magnificence here speaks of you as a young man of whose
great talents his exalted father Lorenzo had a very high
opinion."</p>

<p>"I had the honour to work in the ducal palace for three years,
Excellency."</p>

<p>The Cardinal smiled a little and sighed. "You realize that from
Florence&mdash;the Florence of Lorenzo de' Medici&mdash;to curial
Rome it is a far cry in matters of art; that what there may be
accounted masterly is here often considered elementary, especially
in these days when the antiquities that are being brought to light
are serving us as a school for the education of our sense of
beauty."</p>

<p>With difficulty Michelangelo repressed a sneer. Here was the
same cant that came to nauseate him on every hand. Here, indeed, as
he should have known, was one of the very fountains of that cant.
He attempted no answer, but waited for the Cardinal to proceed.</p>

<p>"The Duke writes that you are both painter and sculptor."</p>

<p>"As a painter," the youth replied abruptly, "I may not be of
much account. I do not think I am. There are many better."</p>

<p>"Ah!" A smile distended the thin lips in that white face which
Michelangelo was finding odious. "And as a sculptor?"</p>

<p>"As a sculptor I am not ashamed of what I do, and I am artist
enough to know of what I should be ashamed. It is as a sculptor
that I offer myself to your lordship, whose discrimination in art
is so well and widely known. If here at the court of the Holy
Father..."</p>

<p>A white hand waved him into silence.</p>

<p>"I have warned you, sir, that the standards here are high. You
are still very young and will lack experience."</p>

<p>"Artists, my lord, are created by God, not by experience. By
this I mean that the artist is born."</p>

<p>A momentary annoyance under that retort flashed from the
Cardinal's eyes. But at once he subdued it, and his answer was
coldly smooth.</p>

<p>"I think the assertion has been made before. Or something like
it: <i>Poeta nascitur, non fit</i>. Perhaps you remember. But
come." The tall figure, clad from head to heel in flowing scarlet,
rose abruptly. "Whether or not it may lie in my power to find you
employment, you shall not be utterly at the loss of the time you
have spent here. Let me show you my collection of sculpture. It is
the most perfect and ample collection in Rome, which is to say in
the world. To behold it is an education in itself, my friend.
Come."</p>

<p>Familiarly now he took the young man by the arm, and conducted
him to a door at the opposite end of the room, where an usher
waited. The man opened for them, and they passed into a long
gallery lighted along its length by tall windows that looked upon
the inner courtyard of the palace. Facing these windows stood
ranged along the gallery from end to end the treasures of sculpture
which Sforza-Riario had assembled at the price of several princely
fortunes. In all that collection there was little that was modern.
It was composed almost entirely of pieces brought from Greece and
of others excavated in Rome, in which the Greek influence was
strong.</p>

<p>Slowly they moved along the gallery, the Cardinal discharging
the office of showman, and discoursing at length upon the beauty of
each work in turn, pointing out those subtle virtues of execution
perceptible only to the initiate's eye. Here it was the fall of a
drapery, there the vigour of a limb, there the modelling of a face,
and there the liveliness of the attitude that he desired his guest
to observe. And Michelangelo observed faithfully as he was bidden,
swallowed his resentment of this patronage of himself, an artist,
by one who in the world of art held no place save as a buyer. Since
he offered no comment, the Cardinal began to assume that the young
man's arrogance was being properly humbled.</p>

<p>"You are silent, my friend."</p>

<p>"I am listening to Your Magnificence," was the bland reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, and something more. Confess that you stand abashed in the
presence of such beauty. And well you may, for I venture to assert
that there is no man living today capable of producing any single
piece that adorns this gallery."</p>

<p>"There are certainly not many," the sculptor agreed.</p>

<p>"There is none, my friend. None. Believe me. I know. Not for
nothing have I devoted my life to the contemplation and study of
art. What I tell you of art, you may believe."</p>

<p>They had come midway down the gallery, and they were standing
before a slim boyish figure in old marble that was stained and
darkened by the salts of the earth in which it must have lain for
centuries. It was less than life size, presenting a stripling whose
limbs were just beginning to assume virility and strength. The
figure was curiously poised, one knee touching the ground, the head
tilted aside, the left hand clenched and held at arm's length, the
right in line with it but at the level of the cheek. About the
lovely face&mdash;almost too virile for so young a body&mdash;the
hair clustered in thick short curls.</p>

<p>Michelangelo's eyes had quickened with sudden interest the
moment they beheld it, and this the Cardinal had perceived.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he laughed. "You begin to profit, I see. You begin to
discern perfection for yourself."</p>

<p>The artist wheeled to face him, his eyes glowing, his face
flushed. He found the dilettante's insolence ludicrous.</p>

<p>"What...what does it represent?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Cupid. A Kneeling Cupid. Not Cupid as any of your moderns would
represent him, round, shapeless and chubby; but a clean-limbed,
active Cupid, a miracle, as you see, of grace and vigour. He is
kneeling, you observe, in the act of taking aim. The bow has
gone&mdash;lost. But it is not missed; almost, indeed, can you see
it, so perfect is the poise of the arms, the expression of the
hands."</p>

<p>"And your Excellency says that it is old, this&mdash;an
antiquity?" quoth Michelangelo in a voice that was small as if
awed.</p>

<p>The Cardinal stared at him, annoyed by his stupidity. A faint
smile of disdain overspread his white face.</p>

<p>"Look at it," he commanded. "And take your answer from the
figure itself. As your experience widens you will come to
understand that no sculptor since Phidias could have wrought so
lovely a thing. Consider it, examine it closely. I promise you that
it will bear inspection." Sighing, he placed a hand upon the young
man's shoulder. "When you, my young friend, can make something that
is even remotely comparable with this, you may depend upon me to
set your feet upon the road to fortune."</p>

<p>Again the young sculptor swung to confront the great patron, and
his rugged face was pale under its tan.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency makes me that promise?"</p>

<p>His Excellency smiled his tolerance of this youthful
impetuosity. "I have made it."</p>

<p>"Then by your gracious leave I shall claim its fulfilment at
once."</p>

<p>The Cardinal looked down his nose.</p>

<p>Michelangelo answered the look. "I have at home a piece of clay
that your lordship will confess to be no whit inferior to this
marble."</p>

<p>Sforza-Riario permitted himself a gentle laugh. "You have in
abundance the modern quality of assurance, young sir. Almost I
might say, of effrontery. But I'll indulge you. Bring me your clay,
and let us see this modelling of which you boast so
confidently."</p>

<p>Michelangelo departed on that errand, and the Cardinal went to
laugh first to himself and later with his nephew over the
presumption of this young Florentine.</p>

<p>"I had thought," he said, "to chasten and educate him by a
display of my treasures. Instead..."</p>

<p>"They are all the same, these moderns," answered Gianluca.
"Ignorant, crude in their work and self-sufficient in their
estimate of it. They need humbling."</p>

<p>The Cardinal nodded. "It is a duty, and a duty that I shall not
shrink from performing."</p>

<p>"Let me be present," pleaded Gianluca. But the Cardinal, having
considered, shook his head. "That were too uncharitable."</p>

<p>And so when the sculptor and a couple of lads he had procured to
assist him came staggering under the burden of a figure swathed in
sackcloth, the Cardinal was alone to receive him. Michelangelo
begged, and the Cardinal indulgently consented, that he should
uncover his figure in the gallery itself, alongside that of the
Cupid with which it challenged comparison.</p>

<p>Smiling, the Cardinal accompanied him. Smiling, he stood by
whilst Michelangelo, having dismissed his assistants, breathing
heavily and perspiring freely, removed the sackcloth. But when the
clay figure was suddenly revealed, the smile perished on the
Cardinal's white face. He craned his neck; his brows were drawn
together, and some three or four times his narrow eyes glanced from
clay to marble and from marble to clay in a bewilderment that was
tinged with anger. For saving that the material of which each was
fashioned was different, no slightest difference was discernible
between the two. In every line and lineament the marble was the
very counterpart of the clay.</p>

<p>A dull flush suffused His Excellency's pallid sunken cheeks. His
voice was harsh.</p>

<p>"What imposture is here?"</p>

<p>Michelangelo was no whit abashed.</p>

<p>"The imposture that was necessary to convince dilettanti that at
least one artist lives who may measure himself against antiquity,
who need not fear comparison with Phidias. It was Phidias Your
Magnificence named, I think. No sculptor since Phidias, you said,
could have wrought so lovely a thing. And yet, with these two hands
I wrought it. I." And he laughed as he thrust forward those
vigorous hands of his for the great man's inspection.</p>

<p>"You wrought it?" The Cardinal's voice shrilled upwards, whilst
his shaking hand was pointing to the marble. "You&mdash;you
fashioned that Cupid? Buffoon! Impostor! What are you saying? That
statue has lain in the earth perhaps a thousand years. It was
excavated..."</p>

<p>"From Baldassare della Balza's garden, where I had buried it not
even a thousand hours before. All the demand in Rome is for
antiquities. There is no beauty save in antiquities. To live,
therefore, I must supply antiquities. And I can supply them. There
are dyes and salts that in a few days will act upon marble as would
mother earth in the course of centuries. The Cupid's missing bow I
broke off when the modelling was completed. Does your Excellency
still doubt? Then look at this." He tilted the clay figure and
pointed to an inscription on the base&mdash;a single word in Greek
characters. "Aggelos&mdash;for Angelo: Michael-Angelo. My signature
for this occasion. You'll find the same upon the base of the marble
if Your Excellency will look."</p>

<p>But His Excellency did not need to look. Evidence enough did he
possess already, and in his deep mortification he appeared to
shrink under the artist's smiling eyes. It was some time before he
found his voice. At last, "I have been swindled," he choked,
"swindled by that rascal Baldassare."</p>

<p>"Deceived, perhaps, my lord. Not swindled."</p>

<p>"What do you say? And the difference, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, to be swindled is to be brought by false pretences to pay
for an object more than it is worth; and this Your Excellency has
not done, whatever you may have paid. To be deceived is to be led
to believe what is untrue. And here even the deception is no more
than partial: it concerns only the age of the work, and not its
merit, which is at least equal to the best among these pieces of
antiquity."</p>

<p>The Cardinal gasped. "My God! Your modesty!"</p>

<p>"Truth," said Michelangelo, "is greater than modesty. And
yourself has said that no sculptor since Phidias could have wrought
so lovely a thing."</p>

<p>Sforza-Riario glared at him with unmistakable dislike. "You do
not, by any chance, presume to amuse yourself? If you think that
you have me at a disadvantage, let me warn you..."</p>

<p>"Excellency!" the sculptor interrupted him. It was a cry of
pained protest. "Could I conceive so base a thought? What grounds,
even, could exist for it?"</p>

<p>"Grounds?" The Cardinal shook with passion. His very
articulation was blurred. "Do you play the innocent? Are there not
grounds enough in the mere fact that a sham has been imposed upon
me? Upon a man of my acknowledged judgment?"</p>

<p>"In what, then, is your lordship's judgment at fault? You
perceived in this Cupid a work of such uncommon excellence as to be
worthy of a place in your unrivalled collection; and so, naturally,
you acquired it. If hitherto your collection has been confined to
pieces from antiquity, that surely is only because in modern work
you had found nothing worthy to stand beside them. But now, having
discovered a sculpture which your lordship recognizes that no man
since Phidias could have wrought, could you possibly have forgone
its acquisition?" Almost slyly he added: "Is not that how your
lordship will account to the world for an innovation which cannot
but increase your lordship's credit?"</p>

<p>Sforza-Riario was almost startled by this indication of a door
for his escape from a situation which if published in its bald
veracity must cover him with ridicule. He perceived how easily he
might snatch triumph from this defeat. But because he perceived
that at the same time he must procure an even greater triumph for
this audacious young Florentine who had cozened him, the glance
that pondered Michelangelo lost nothing of its malevolence.</p>

<p>When at last his sombre eyes shifted again to the Cupid, His
Excellency assumed a musing tone. "What you say is certainly true.
My judgment has nowise been at fault. Nor was it necessary to
practise upon me this deception." A little colour stirred in his
pallid cheeks, and he spoke with a sudden vehemence which
Michelangelo judged to be histrionic. "What I find it hard to
forgive is that instead of bringing me your Cupid openly, like an
honest man, you should have had recourse to this duplicity in order
to draw my attention to your wares. That, sir, was an insulting
lack of confidence in my judgment."</p>

<p>"Your lordship does me less than justice. It was not I, but
Baldassare, who sold you the piece. It was not to you that I bade
him sell it, but to any who would buy. Alas, my lord! For three
months now I have been in Rome, hoping for audience, and I had to
choose between working and starving. So I did the work that
Baldassare found saleable. When your lordship considers that
starvation was my only alternative, you will not, of your great
charity, publish me a swindler or allow the world to know what I
was driven by necessity to do."</p>

<p>The Cardinal's keen eyes were veiled. His white face became void
of expression. "It would be no less than you deserve," he said.</p>

<p>"Surely, my lord, too harsh a punishment in its results. For it
would render impossible the fulfilment of your lordship's
promise."</p>

<p>"Promise? What promise, fellow?"</p>

<p>"Can your lordship have forgotten? Your words were that when I
could make something comparable with this Kneeling Cupid you would
set my feet upon the road to fortune."</p>

<p>"And you have the audacity still to hope for that?" growled the
prelate.</p>

<p>"Not if it should become known that I had any part in this fraud
of Baldassare's. That is why I pray that it may not be known. It
would make it impossible, for instance, for your lordship to
present me to the Holy Father."</p>

<p>Sforza-Riario breathed noisily. Nor was he acting now. "To the
Holy Father!" His lips writhed. "That is your price, is it?"</p>

<p>Michelangelo's dark eyes were opened wide in guilelessness. "My
price, my lord? My price for what?"</p>

<p>"For your silence upon what has happened."</p>

<p>"My silence! O, my lord, should I, then, be so rash as to
achieve my own ruin by speaking of it?"</p>

<p>Gloomily and at length the Cardinal pondered him. He conceived
that he had to deal with craftily enshrouded blackmail; for it was
not so much the ruin of the sculptor that would result from a full
disclosure as the submerging in ridicule of his own cherished
reputation as an authority upon art.</p>

<p>His compressed lips parted at last and forced a smile. "Enough!"
He waved a delicate hand towards the Kneeling Cupid. "You have
certainly fulfilled your part," he admitted on a sigh. "Tomorrow,"
he added abruptly, "I shall present you to His Holiness."</p>

<p>Michelangelo bowed low. "Upon the recommendation of so exalted a
judge I cannot doubt that the Holy Father will find employment for
my talents."</p>

<p>"That is assured, sir."</p>

<p>The Florentine bowed again. "Have I leave to go, my lord?"</p>

<p>Sforza-Riario waved him away. "Go. Go with God," he said, much
as he might have said, "Go to the devil."</p>

<p>In the act of swathing his clay model Michelangelo paused. "One
last favour, my lord. Would you tell me how much you paid
Baldassare for that marble?"</p>

<p>The figure which the Cardinal mentioned betrayed the sculptor
into a muttered oath. It had the effect of restoring to
Sforza-Riario some of his lost humour. "I gather," said he tartly,
"that I am not the only one whom Baldassare has swindled over
this."</p>

<p>"That is so," said Michelangelo. "But to take permanent
advantage of me one must be exceedingly alert."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it," the great man sighed, and on that they
parted, if not exactly friends, most certainly accomplices.</p>

<p>That evening Michelangelo took his way to the little dealer's
shop on the Ripa Vecchia.</p>

<p>"Olà, Baldassare you rogue, I have found you out. You sold the
Kneeling Cupid to Cardinal Sforza-Riario for five thousand ducats.
Don't forswear yourself, you scoundrel. I have it from the
Cardinal's own lips. Don't interrupt me. Our compact was to share
equally in the spoil, and you swore to me that all you had was a
thousand ducats. You deserve that I should strangle you, you thief.
Instead I'll trouble you for the two thousand ducats you owe me,
and another thousand by way of compensation for the swindle."</p>

<p>Baldassare, who would sooner part with blood than money,
screamed in fury. "The devil take your Florentine impudence! Am I
to work for nothing, then?"</p>

<p>"You are to work for what was agreed; and so I'll have my two
thousand ducats and another thousand so as to teach you to be
honest in the future."</p>

<p>"Oho! Oho! That's how you crow, is it? And what if I refuse?
What then, eh?"</p>

<p>"In that case I shall go straight to Cardinal Sforza-Riario and
confess the imposture we have jointly practised. You'll be made to
disgorge; you'll certainly be gaoled; you may even be given the
hoist; and you'll probably be hanged."</p>

<p>Baldassare was astute; but not astute enough to gauge human
vanity as accurately as Michelangelo, or to perceive that this
vanity afforded him a safe shield from any such reprisals. So for
all that he gibbered and danced in rage, yet he yielded to this
young sculptor whose feet had been firmly planted by his wits upon
the road to that fortune which his talents merited.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. BY ANCIENT CUSTOM</h2>

<p>THE Sire Tristan de Beloeil standing upon the threshold of
Eternity considered perhaps for the first time since his birth,
twenty-five years earlier, how much there was in life which could
not be heft without regret.</p>

<p>Well-born and well-dowered in fortune as in body, the world's
best gifts had lain within his easy reach and there had been on his
part no reluctance in making them his own, or niggardliness in
using them.</p>

<p>The priest who had been sent to shrive him, and who had just
departed, might be correctly informed in the matter of the
Hereafter, which he had described in such alluring terms. But it
seemed to the Sire Tristan that the priest took a good deal for
granted; and for his own part he was content enough with the world
of men, and would prefer to continue in it, postponing until much
later the enjoyment of the delights of Paradise to which the
hangman was to despatch him in the morning.</p>

<p>He leaned on the stone sill of the solidly barred window of his
prison in the Gravensteen of Ghent, and contemplated the sunset. He
was not likely to contemplate another, since only the powers of
Joshua could postpone the doom which its circling would bring him
in the next twelve hours. He took his head in his hands, thrusting
his fingers deep into his golden mane, and so far forgot the
admirable stoicism which had hitherto supported him as to permit
himself a sob. Never had life seemed so sweet and desirable as now
that by the justice of the great Duke of Burgundy he was to be
deprived of it. This justice, he held, had been too harshly
administered by the Ducal Lieutenant. He was prepared to admit that
a certain severity may be expedient in legislating for a subject
people, especially when they are as stubborn and turbulent as those
of Ghent who had given the Duke trouble almost from the very hour
of his accession. But even a Ducal Lieutenant should not disregard
the claims which the laws of honour make upon a gentleman of birth;
and tolerance should be shown whenever these laws are in conflict
with no less arbitrary ducal enactments. It was true that the Sire
Tristan had grievously wounded a man, and equally true that deeds
of blood were of all offences those which Ducal Lieutenants,
operating so briskly with sack and cord throughout the Duke's wide
dominions, were instructed to punish most rigorously. But, after
all, this had been no act of brigandage or scoundrel violence. He
had fought honourably with Conrad van der Schuylen, and it was
monstrous that he should be required to pay for it by dying a
felon's death.</p>

<p>Yet if the Ducal Lieutenant of Ghent&mdash;the wooden-faced Sire
de Vauvenargues&mdash;had confined himself in his judgment to the
naked fact and taken no account of its clothing circumstances, the
fault was largely the Sire Tristan's own. He had stubbornly refused
to inform the court of the grounds of the quarrel, arrogantly
claiming that he was within his rights to engage in single combat
whenever honour should demand it.</p>

<p>"How," the Ducal Lieutenant had asked him, not unreasonably,
"are we to judge that honour demanded it in this instance unless
you disclose the grounds upon which you quarrelled?"</p>

<p>The Sire Tristan, however, would not yield the point. "It is a
gentleman's right to quarrel upon any grounds he pleases. The
present grounds are such as I cannot publish without committing a
disloyalty. It is in your knowledge that I did not fall upon
Messire van der Schuylen unawares, like an assassin; therefore you
cannot deal with me as with a common murderer."</p>

<p>But the court showed him that it could. If he would not defend
himself in what the court accounted proper terms, the court must
assume that he had no proper defence. Van der Schuylen's turn would
come later when and if he recovered sufficiently to stand his
trial. Perhaps he would be less obstinate. Perhaps he would have
less cause so to be. Thus the Ducal Lieutenant, who thereupon
proceeded calmly to pass sentence of death upon the Sire Tristan de
Beloeil as an example to all men who might be disposed to practise
turbulence within the ducal dominions.</p>

<p>The Sire Tristan was sprung from a family of much consequence,
and this family exerted itself vigorously, urging its ancient blood
as a last plea why execution should be stayed until appeal could be
made to the Duke's Highness in person. But the Ducal Lieutenant met
this plea with that monstrous falsehood of all time that in the
eyes of the law all men are equal, and that, therefore, no appeal
to the Duke could avail. Thereafter, an advocate had arisen in the
grey justice chamber of the Gravensteen to offer on behalf of some
person or persons unnamed to ransom the prisoner by the payment of
any reasonable fine which the Ducal Lieutenant might see fit to
impose as an alternative.</p>

<p>He was curtly informed that the justice of Burgundy was not for
sale, and the Sire Tristan was conducted back to his prison, there
to prepare himself for his end. He was not even to have the
satisfaction of knowing what generous friend had sent that advocate
before the court with his mysterious offer. For although the Sire
Tristan possessed many friends, yet he could think of none whose
love for him would have gone to quite such lengths. The failure of
that attempt had closed the last door on hope, and nothing now
remained but to prepare himself for tomorrow's grim journey with
the best courage he could command.</p>

<p>They kept him waiting next day until noon, thereby subjecting
him to a torment of hope. He perceived the reason when at last they
brought him forth from the palace-fortress which once had been the
castle of the Counts of Flanders, and conducted him through the
mean alleys of the Oudeburg to the great square where the scaffold
was erected in the shadow of that Belfry regarded by the burghers
as the monument of their power and wealth. The Ducal Lieutenant had
chosen the hour when the noon bell summoned the forty thousand
weavers of Ghent from their looms to the midday meal. They were a
turbulent, stubbornly independent class, these weavers, ever ready
in defence of liberty to exchange the shuttle for the club or the
pike. Their numbers and cohesion made them formidable, wherefore
the Sire de Vauvenargues deemed it well to miss no opportunity of
intimidating them by a display of the iron hand of Burgundy. The
hour of deserted looms was deliberately chosen so that all Ghent
might be free to witness this operation of Burgundian justice upon
a well-born disturber of the peace.</p>

<p>Under a strong guard of archers, upon the breasts of whose white
surcoats was displayed the Burgundian badge of the St Andrew's
Cross, came the Sire Tristan de Beloeil marching briskly to his
doom. He carried himself erect, his face composed, if pale, and he
had dressed himself in his best as if for a bridal, accounting that
his birth and blood demanded that he should make as brave a show as
possible on this his last appearance.</p>

<p>His pourpoint was of red velvet, tapering gracefully to the
waist, laced in gold across the wedge of snowy undergarment showing
at the breast; his hose was parti-coloured, red and white, his long
boots of fine red Spanish leather turned over at the tops.</p>

<p>Beholding him so young and so comely, so elegant and so
intrepid, the crowd was moved to general compassion, whilst here
and there the feeling became allied with indignation that he should
suffer a felon's death for a deed which no equitable justice would
have regarded as felonious.</p>

<p>The Sire Tristan was bareheaded, and the abundant hair which
hung to the nape of his neck was so lustrously golden that an
aureole of light seemed to glow about it as it reflected the
sunlight of that fair April noon. This was observed by some and
pointed out as a portent, a sign of heavenly grace, a prognostic of
beatitude to be earned him by his approaching martyrdom. A woman
was the first to voice it.</p>

<p>"There is a nimbus about his head!" she cried. "It is a
sign!"</p>

<p>Another took up the cry and amplified it: "There is a throne
awaiting him in Heaven, the dear young saint."</p>

<p>Why, this assurance growing amongst them, they should have
desired to prevent the Sire Tristan, for whom there was certainly
no throne on earth, from at once fulfilling so splendid a celestial
destiny, is not immediately apparent. But crowds are moved by
emotion; and emotion is rarely the friend of logic. The people
began to mutter, to protest against this hanging, and, at last, to
jostle and hinder the archers of the guard, so that these were
forced to employ their staves in order to thrust back the press and
open a way to the gallows.</p>

<p>The Sire de Vauvenargues, looking on from a balcony of the
Stadhuis, began to ask himself if, after all, he had been wise in
deliberately choosing an hour when the streets were thronged. If a
riot were to ensue his harsh master, the Duke, would ask a stern
account of him for the event and the dispositions which had made it
possible. There was, however, no riot. Before the uncompromising
attitude of the Burgundian archers and the resolute wielding of
their staves, the crowd permitted prudence to override compassion.
Had the Sire Tristan been a Ghenter it might have fallen out
differently. But he was comparatively a stranger there, a gentleman
of Hainault, and, after all, there was no reason why men of Ghent
should get their heads broken on behalf of a Hainaulter, however
young, comely and deserving of sympathy. They left him, therefore,
to the protection of a Heaven which had already placed about his
golden head that startling mark of favour. Heaven, however, showed
no sign of intervening to prolong the young man's earthly life, for
with his monkish companion he reached the foot of the scaffold and
mounted its wooden steps. The Ducal Lieutenant, looking on from his
balcony, was relieved.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of the cross-beam, from which the noosed rope
of yellow hemp was dangling ominously, the Sire Tristan stood to
address the people, as was the right of every man in his extremity.
His face was grey; the brave smile on his lips was stiff, frozen
and lifeless. Neither could his mind conceive nor his lips
articulate any valedictory words for the people upon whom a hush of
piteous attention had now fallen. But before the perception of his
plight had time to arise, the general silence was broken by a cry,
followed by a rapidly swelling and spreading hubbub.</p>

<p>It began at a corner of the square to the left of the Stadhuis,
which the doomed man was facing, and appeared to have its source
about a lady on a richly caparisoned white horse, for whom a number
of grooms were labouring to open a way through the crowd, a way
which opened of itself rapidly enough and almost joyously once her
identity became known and her object&mdash;or at least some part of
it&mdash;suspected.</p>

<p>She was the Lady Margaret of Saint-Gilles, the daughter of an
opulent nobleman of Waes, and she shared the esteem and affection
in which her father was held throughout Flanders, adding to it even
by her own natural endowments. She was unknown to the Sire de
Vauvenargues, who was a Burgundian lately brought from Dijon by the
Duke and as yet unacquainted either with the persons or the customs
of those to whom he dispensed justice in the Duke's name. But there
was in her commanding beauty a passport to the favour of any man
who was not withered to the marrow. And the Sire de Vauvenargues
for all his cold austerity of manner and lean gravity of
countenance, was still on the young side of fifty and far from
destitute of gallantry. Disturbed though he might be again by these
growing murmurs, yet the greater part of his attention at the
moment was for this splendid figure in a trailing riding-dress of
mulberry velvet, mounted on that richly caparisoned horse, for
which the grooms were opening a way in his direction. She carried
her head proudly, he observed, and as she neared the low balcony he
occupied, he was almost dazzled by the effulgence of the dark blue
eyes glowing in a face as pale as ivory. Her head was crowned by
the tall steeple-shaped herrin, from which floated a misty veil of
blue, and a jewel of price gleamed in the black frontlet across her
brow, as if to proclaim her rank.</p>

<p>When first the eyes of the Sire Tristan had beheld her, a tremor
had run through his limbs, a tinge of colour had crept into his
pallid cheeks and life had returned to his lack-lustre gaze. It was
as if the very sight of her had power to conquer his fear of death;
as if all his consciousness were suddenly focused in his eyes, and
seeing her, he saw nothing else, knew of nothing else.</p>

<p>The Captain of the Archers, standing behind him on the scaffold,
had touched his shoulder and bidden him say his say, so that they
might conclude the business and go home to dinner. The hangman and
his valet had been growing impatient too. But now the attention of
captain, of hangman and even of priest, like that of the multitude,
was transferred from the doomed man to the lady on the white
palfrey. The Sire Tristan had suddenly ceased to be the chief actor
in this grim scene.</p>

<p>She had drawn rein immediately under that low balcony occupied
by the Ducal Lieutenant, who, in his furred gown and chain of
office, was attended by the Burgomaster van Genck and a group of
officers. She lifted up her voice, a voice rich, sonorous and
musical to match her splendid person.</p>

<p>"A boon, my Lord Lieutenant! I ask as a boon what by our ancient
Flemish customs I have the right to claim; that I may be married to
this man whom the Duke's justice is about to hang."</p>

<p>It occurred then to Tristan de Beloeil, who had missed no word
of it, that all this was not real; that it was not happening at
all; that he was still in his prison asleep and dreaming the
incredible. The Sire de Vauvenargues, ignorant of those Flemish
customs to which she appealed, may have had some similar thought.
He flushed and scowled. It seemed to him that this request made a
mock of his authority and of the justice of the Duke his master
which should be executed with due solemnity of forms. He looked to
right and to left, at the fat Burgomaster, grinning like an idol,
at the frowning Burgundian captains and at the laughing, applauding
people below. He turned to the lady with a curt contemptuous
dismissal. But her beauty withered it on his lips. He contented
himself with a cold announcement that what she asked was
impossible.</p>

<p>Her answer by taking him too literally seemed further to exploit
the mockery.</p>

<p>"Not so, my lord. There is a priest on the scaffold there to
make it possible at once." Pale she might be; but she was
singularly firm.</p>

<p>There was no tremor in her rich young voice, no faltering in the
steady gaze of her deep blue eyes.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant's voice came harsher now and more impatient. "The
request is unexampled, an effrontery! You delay the Duke's justice
frivolously, Madame. It is outrageous!" Impulsively he raised his
hand to signal to the Captain of the Archers, but found his arm
caught in the grasp of the Burgomaster. Mynheer van Genck no longer
grinned. His face was very grave, his eyes almost scared.</p>

<p>The laughter and applause below had suddenly changed to angry
murmurs, which grew as they rippled through the ranks of the
multitude. Clear above the inarticulate mutter of indignation came
the shouted words:</p>

<p>"It is an honoured Flemish custom, Lord Lieutenant!"</p>

<p>"The Duke of Burgundy would not trample on our rights and
privileges!"</p>

<p>"You are false to your trust, Lord Lieutenant, if you deny this
lady!"</p>

<p>Despotic, cold and arrogant, the Sire de Vauvenargues might be;
but he was not a fool; indeed, he was a man of some acuteness, else
he would not have been raised by Charles of Burgundy to the
eminence he occupied. He perceived himself confronted by something
which he did not understand. He raised his hand for silence and
patience, and was almost surprised by the readiness with which the
signal was obeyed.</p>

<p>He turned for guidance to the Burgomaster.</p>

<p>"What is this, sir, of a custom, a right, a privilege?"</p>

<p>"It is as they tell you, my lord. It is an old Flemish custom
which gives any woman the right to marry a doomed man on the
scaffold, provided that he is marriageable."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant's lip curled. "A gruesome custom, faith! And a
stupid one. What satisfaction lies in it?"</p>

<p>The Burgomaster shrugged and spread his podgy hands. "Can Your
Excellency conceive of no case in which it would yield
satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"With difficulty, my friend. But..." He shrugged in his turn,
contemptuously. "I'll not provoke a riot by refusing so barren a
favour." He leaned from the balcony. His harsh penetrating voice
rang clear. "I bow to your Flemish privileges, Madame. Your request
is granted in the Duke's name. I beg that you will make haste, so
that we may conclude the unhappy business upon which we are here."
He seemed to sneer as he spoke. But she took no heed of that. She
thanked him shortly, and wheeled her horse about.</p>

<p>A lane opened readily enough through the crowd, and amid
acclamations and laughter she came to alight at the foot of the
scaffold and to mount its steps to where the Sire Tristan waited.
He looked and felt as if he would swoon. He had been no paler when
he stood beneath the rope to utter his last words. And now not even
that stiff frozen smile which pride had dictated was to be seen
upon his lips.</p>

<p>Gently, tenderly smiling, the Lady of Saint-Gilles confronted
him. "Do you take me to wife, Sire Tristan?" she softly asked him,
and thus seemed to increase his disorder.</p>

<p>His scared eyes sought her glance and fled from it; he made an
almost convulsive movement of his arms. "Madame! Madame! Bethink
you of yourself. I am not worthy that you should do this..."</p>

<p>"It is for me to be the judge of that. It is my wish. Will you
deny me? Will you shame me by refusing me here before all these?
That were to make me a by-word for all the days of my life."</p>

<p>He lowered his head, his face flaming scarlet. Subduing his
voice, so that only she might hear him, he made his almost agonized
protest. "You should not..." he was beginning, when she interrupted
him, sensing what he was about to say.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should not." Her voice was almost wistful now. "But
it is done. I am committed to it." A great sadness seemed to invest
her. "Dismiss me if you will..."</p>

<p>He fell on his knees before her there in the sight of all, and
it was a spectacle that thrilled the audience. "Lady, it is my
worthlessness is the only barrier."</p>

<p>With one hand she raised him, with the other she beckoned
forward the priest.</p>

<p>Messire Tristan protested no more. He could not make a mock of
her by refusing this precious gift of herself which he knew she
must offer out of pity for him.</p>

<p>Swiftly the vows were exchanged, the words of the nuptial
blessing uttered, binding them irrevocably; and already, to the
wild acclamations of the crowd, she was leading him by the hand
towards the steps of the scaffold, when the Burgundian captain
intervened.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, lady!" His gauntleted hand closed upon the Sire
Tristan's arm. "You'll leave your husband with us, if you
please."</p>

<p>The crowd perceived his action, those nearest even overheard his
words, and he was answered instantly by a roar of fury from a
thousand throats. Fists were shaken at him, weapons brandished, and
at once the multitude surged forward like a tide to whelm the
scaffold. Below, his well-trained archers, shoulder to shoulder,
made a bulwark against which that first charge spent itself in
vain. But other charges would follow which must overwhelm them. He
did not understand, being like the Sire de Vauvenargues, a newcomer
in these outlying Burgundian dominions. He raised his hand, and at
the same time turned towards the Stadhuis balcony for
instructions.</p>

<p>The crowd, perceiving this, trusting that orders would follow to
correct this rash officer, paused and fell silent. At the head of
the steps the Lady Margaret and her bridegroom stood arrested,
waiting.</p>

<p>On the balcony the Sire de Vauvenargues was expressing his
indignation to the Burgomaster.</p>

<p>"What is this? I accord the boon, I bow to your ridiculous
Flemish custom and this is how your people requite me. If
insubordination to the Duke's..."</p>

<p>The Burgomaster interrupted him. There was almost a sly humour
about the sleek little man.</p>

<p>"By your leave, my lord! I fear you have not quite understood.
This old Flemish custom, to the exercise of which you so wisely
consented, runs that a marriage-knot tied at the gallows rescues a
doomed neck from the halter."</p>

<p>"Ventredieu!" swore the Ducal Lieutenant in his amazement. Then
his anger mounted again! "Why did you not tell me this?"</p>

<p>"I did not think there was the need. The inference seemed plain.
What point else would there be in such a marriage?"</p>

<p>"Did you not hear me complain that I found it pointless? You
have fooled me, sir. At least, you have tried to fool me. But I am
not a man easily fooled, and Burgundian justice is not so easily
cozened. That rascal hangs as surely as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In God's name!" The Burgomaster spoke in dread and horror. "You
might have escaped a riot by firmness before. You cannot now. You
might have refused to admit the custom. Having admitted it, you
cannot trample upon it. You must perceive that, my lord."</p>

<p>"I perceive that you mock me! I perceive that, by God!" He did,
and for all the rage that set him white and quivering, he perceived
something more. He perceived that he was on the horns of a dilemma.
If he provoked a riot, as he must if he insisted now upon justice
being done, he would anon have to face the anger of the Duke. If,
submitting to this clamour, he suffered Burgundian justice to be
set aside, he would similarly incur his master's anger. Whatever
happened now, the Duke would demand an account of him.</p>

<p>That was the situation into which this sly Burgomaster&mdash;the
friend, of course, of all Flemish rogues&mdash;had manoeuvred him.
And then he saw light. It was not a bright or encouraging light.
But it was the best that the circumstances left him. He would
postpone execution whilst referring the whole matter to the Duke.
Thus he would avoid, or appear in ducal eyes to avoid, some measure
of this hideous responsibility now thrust upon him.</p>

<p>He swallowed his pride and arrogance so as to make the
announcement in conciliatory terms.</p>

<p>He complained that he had not been aware of the full import of
the custom when he gave his consent to the marriage. But, having
given it, he could not do violence to Flemish privileges by
insisting now upon the execution of the just sentence passed
yesterday in his court upon the Sire Tristan de Beloeil. Applause
greeted the admission, and he was forced to pause until this had
subsided before adding that, on the other hand, being no more than
a servant and mouthpiece of His Highness the Duke of Burgundy,
whose loyal faithful subjects they all were, it was not in his
power to do violence to Burgundian justice by allowing the prisoner
to go free.</p>

<p>He was interrupted again, this time by a storm of protests and
even threats. When at last he was able to resume it was to make an
even further immolation of his pride, by casting himself, as it
were, upon the mercy of the people. He represented himself as a man
in an extremely difficult situation, a situation indeed of such
difficulty that it was beyond the power of his office to resolve
it; wherefore he had no choice but to refer the whole matter to the
Duke himself. He added, however, and quickly before they could
again interrupt him, an assurance that in laying the matter before
his Highness, he would himself plead the cause of the prisoner if
it became necessary and urge observance of the Flemish custom to
which appeal had been made. He could not think that the Duke would
desire to violate it, but he dared not take the responsibility of
acting upon that assumption. He closed his little oration in
conciliatory words, which almost choked him, whereby again he cast
himself upon their mercy.</p>

<p>Despite this unusual humility in a Ducal Lieutenant, he would
not have won out of his difficulty so easily if the little
Burgomaster who had so deliberately tricked him into it had not
come now to his assistance by endorsing all that he had said,
supporting his appeal and even adding a word of warning as to the
consequences of any rioting. This warning, which, from the Ducal
Lieutenant in such an hour would have had the effect of infuriating
the people, was heeded by them because coming from their own
Burgomaster. There were offensive and rebellious mutterings, it is
true. But no resistance was offered to the removal of the prisoner
under guard, and presently the people dispersed, the more speedily
perhaps because the hour of dinner was already over-past.</p>

<p>That same afternoon the Ducal Lieutenant set out for Brussels
with the Sire Tristan and an escort of fifty Burgundian lances. He
submitted to the Lady Margaret's insistence to attach herself and
her attendants to his train, since it was not really in his power
to prevent it. But he bore the Lady Margaret no love for the
difficulty in which she had placed him, and he refused her
permission to communicate in any way with his prisoner, however
much that same prisoner might now be her husband.</p>

<p>This was distressing not only to her, but also to the Sire
Tristan, who was still all bemused and bewildered by the event, and
who desired at least an opportunity of expressing his gratitude and
some other things to her before they strung him up, as he was quite
convinced that they would presently be doing.</p>

<p>Travelling swiftly they reached Brussels late that night, too
late for audience. The Sire de Vauvenargues bestowed his prisoner
in one of the dungeons of the Cour des Princes, where the Duke had
his residence, quartered his men, and went to seek a lodging for
himself in the palace. The Lady Margaret made shift for herself and
her attendants at the Lion of Brabant, whither the Sire de
Vauvernargues grudgingly undertook to send her word in the morning
of the ducal decision.</p>

<p>Betimes next day he presented himself for the bad quarter of an
hour which he had every reason to expect. He was introduced to the
Duke's closet and received with a scowl such as that with which he,
himself, was in the habit of intimidating suppliants.</p>

<p>"By what authority, sir, do you leave your government?" the Duke
demanded before the Sire de Vauvenargues had time to speak.</p>

<p>He bent himself almost double. "I trust the case, when your
Highness shall have heard it, will justify me."</p>

<p>"Is there a revolt among these mutinous Ghenters?" The Duke
detested all Flemings, and of all Flemings he detested the Ghenters
most, having had a taste of their insubordinate quality.</p>

<p>"There might have been had I not decided to seek the guidance of
Your Highness."</p>

<p>"So, so!" The young prince heaved himself up. A man of middle
height was this Charles of Burgundy, whom history knows as the
Temerarious, powerfully built and swarthy of complexion which with
the dark eyes and black hair advertised the Portuguese extraction
of which he was so proud. His countenance might have been handsome
but for the forward thrust of his aggressive jaw. He was dressed
with sober richness, his pleated pourpoint of purple velvet
latticed with gold across his breast, and he wore for only ornament
the collar of the Golden Fleece about his sturdy neck. Harsh,
impetuous, choleric of nature, the very suggestion of
insubordination to his authority now put him in a passion, and he
loosed it in threats of what he would do to make the Ghenters
realize once for all that he was master. Thereafter he invited his
Lieutenant to state the case.</p>

<p>Sire de Vauvenargues told his tale none too well. The Duke's
manner did not help him. Therefore it was some little time before
His Highness caught the drift of it. When at last he did, he
laughed ferociously.</p>

<p>"So that the threatened revolt, then, was of your making, Sir
Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Of my making, Highness! I did not know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so. You did not know and had not the wit to inform
yourself, nor indeed, it seems, the wit to discharge any part of
your duties. First you choose to make a public show of this
hanging, appointing for it the hour when the looms are deserted and
all these turbulent weavers in the streets; then you pledge me to a
crazy custom which makes a mock of my justice. But my justice, sir,
is not to be mocked. So you will get you back to Ghent with your
prisoner and there execute the sentence you passed upon him in my
name."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant was aghast. "If I hang him, the Ghenters will
certainly hang me afterwards."</p>

<p>"God give them joy of it," said the Duke. "What else are you fit
for?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else if Your Highness thinks so. But to hang me is,
after all, in a sense to hang Your Highness, since I am Your
Highness' representative."</p>

<p>The Duke merely sneered. "I could bear to be hanged by proxy.
Indeed, it will be a satisfaction if you are the proxy. And it will
give me the right to read these Ghenters the sharp lesson in
submission which they appear to need. I will avenge you roundly. Be
comforted by that."</p>

<p>But the Sire de Vauvenargues saw no comfort in it. He was
actually driven by the prospect to become in earnest the advocate
of the Sire Tristan. "Highness, if I dare presume so far, since the
error is committed, is it prudent, or...or...even expedient to
allow the life of one man to...to..."</p>

<p>The glare of the ducal eye brought him faltering into
silence.</p>

<p>"It is not the life of a man that is in question. It is my
authority. Don't you see that you have placed me on the horns of a
dilemma? Your blundering gives me to choose between a riot, perhaps
a revolt, in Ghent, and the flouting of my laws. There can be no
hesitation for me. This man of yours must hang whatever the
consequences and in spite of all Flemish customs." Then
contemptuously he added: "Show me how to avoid it without weakness
and I will overlook your wooden-headed blundering which is
responsible."</p>

<p>If the Sire de Vauvenargues felt, as many another has felt, that
the service of princes is the service of the thankless, he choked
the feeling down, and applied his wits to discovering a way of
escape for himself.</p>

<p>"If, Highness," he suggested, "in your revision of the case, you
were to discover that my sentence had been unduly severe, there
would no longer be any question of pardoning the offender or bowing
to any custom. Both would be avoided. Your Highness would simply
cancel my sentence and reprimand me."</p>

<p>The Duke raised his black brows; his eyes gleamed momentarily
from some inward quickening. Then he was frowning again.</p>

<p>"Tell me this man's offence again," he commanded. "Let me
understand it clearly."</p>

<p>Nothing could have been clearer than the account the Lieutenant
had already rendered. And all that he could now do was to repeat
it. When he had done so there followed a long pause whilst the
Duke's dark eyes pondered him inscrutably. Suddenly they blazed,
and his harsh voice was raised.</p>

<p>"By St George!" he swore. "And do you sentence men of birth to
death in Ghent upon no better grounds?" He raged on from that,
heaping invective upon the head of the unfortunate Lieutenant, who
could not be sure whether His Highness was snatching at a pretext
to avoid the real issue, and merely acting, or whether he was
sincere. In this doubt he found it necessary to defend himself.</p>

<p>"The orders of Your Highness left me no doubt or
choice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you argue with me, wooden-head?" The Duke's fury lashed
him. "Get you back to Ghent, and remember what I have said. I will
deal myself with this prisoner of yours."</p>

<p>The Sire de Vauvenargues went out backwards, thankful to make
his escape, convinced that the Duke's anger was so much
make-believe, and more persuaded than ever that the service of
princes was as thankless as it was perilous.</p>

<p>The Sire Tristan de Beloeil, brought before the Duke, was
clearly informed that His Highness, having sifted the matter of his
offence, had reached the conclusion that in the sentence passed
upon him the Ducal Lieutenant in Ghent had used him with excessive
rigour. It was because of this, and because of this only, and not
out of deference to any plaguy Flemish customs&mdash;and the Sire
Tristan was desired to publish the matter widely upon his return to
Ghent, lest a misunderstanding of the facts might lead others into
error&mdash;that he was permitted to go free and rejoin the lady
who had perhaps rashly taken him to husband.</p>

<p>That lady the Sire Tristan found at the Lion of Brabant when
presently he came there, conducted by one of her attendants who had
lain in wait for him in the courtyard of the Cour des Princes. Of
all the trials and anxieties that had been his since he was
sentenced, this was by no means the least he was called upon to
face. He entered her presence in trepidation. She rose in a
trepidation still deeper to receive him.</p>

<p>For a long moment they just stared at each other across the
width of the room in which they found themselves alone
together.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, between plaintiveness and reproach, "why have
you done this?"</p>

<p>"Surely, surely, sir, the reason is plain." She was still a
little short of breath; but her words came glibly, almost as a
lesson learnt by heart. "It is in the consequences. To save your
life. I know I forced it upon you. You could not humiliate me by
preferring the hangman's knot to mine. You were too gallant for
that. But I hoped that the sweetness of life itself would make
amends. That you would choose to avoid the bitterness of death at
any price."</p>

<p>"At any price!" he echoed, with a little twisted smile on his
pale lips. "Yes. At any price to myself. But not at any price to
you, Madame."</p>

<p>He saw her eyes quicken at that, saw the flush that crept into
her pallid cheeks. "But if I was glad to pay the price?"</p>

<p>At that he fell to trembling. "It is not possible, Madame."</p>

<p>"Is it not?" She laughed a little, but sadly. "Does it need that
I tell you what it was that urged me to save your life; or are you
under the impression that I make a habit of rescuing men from the
gallows by marrying them?" She paused. "Although I am your
reluctantly espoused wife, I beg that you will spare me a deeper
avowal."</p>

<p>He gazed, bewildered, at this lovely lady whom he had silently
worshipped in the past, between whom and himself hitherto no single
word of love had ever been uttered. She hung her head, her trouble
deepened by his silence.</p>

<p>"I cannot have done you a great wrong," she murmured. "At least
you have your life. Surely it is better to live even in a wedlock
that is not of your own choosing than not to live at all. I
beg&mdash;I implore that you will do me the charity to say at least
so much."</p>

<p>What he said was something very different. "You knew," he asked
her, "why I was to have been hanged?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, a puzzled frown between her fine brows.
"Because you wounded Messire van der Schuylen in an irregular duel
which had no proper witnesses."</p>

<p>"Ah yes. But why I fought him?"</p>

<p>"How could I know that, since you refused to disclose it even at
your trial? It was your silence that provoked your sentence."</p>

<p>He smiled now, and advanced a little. "You do not ask. Have you
no curiosity? It was because he spoke lightly of you, Madame."</p>

<p>It was her turn to tremble. He saw the colour fade again from
her cheeks, the widening stare of her eyes and the tumult at her
breast.</p>

<p>"Of me?" She pressed a hand to her heart. "It was for that...for
me, that you fought? Why?"</p>

<p>"Madame, must you be asking? Do you not know the answer? For the
same reason that moved you to rescue me."</p>

<p>After that they continued gazing raptly at each other, until at
last they fell to laughing, joyously as children laugh.</p>

<p>If there had been between them no wooing such as usually
precedes wedlock, they perceived that they might make blissful
amends for it now that they were man and wife.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. THE SCAPULARY</h2>

<p>THE uneasiness that had been disturbing Gaspard de Putanges ever
since the King had visited the wounded Admiral de Coligny reached a
climax that night when he found his way barred by armed men at the
Porte St Denis, and a password was demanded of him.</p>

<p>"Password!" cried that Huguenot gentleman in amazement. "Is a
password necessary before a man can leave Paris? And why, if you
please? Are we suddenly at war?"</p>

<p>"Those are the orders," the officer stiffly answered.</p>

<p>"Whose orders?" M. de Putanges was impatient.</p>

<p>"I owe you no account, sir. You will give me the word of the
night, or you may return home and wait until morning."</p>

<p>Perforce he must turn his horse about, and, with his groom at
his heels, ride back by the way that he had come. The vexation
which at any time he must have felt at this unwarranted
interference with his movements was now swollen by misgivings.</p>

<p>He was one of the host of Huguenot gentlemen brought to Paris
for the nuptials of the King of Navarre with the sister of the King
of France, a marriage which the pacifists of both parties had hoped
would heal the feud between the Catholic and Protestant factions.
But the Guisard attempt upon the life of Coligny, the great
Huguenot leader, had now rudely dashed this hope. M. de Putanges
had been one of that flock of Huguenot gentlemen who that day had
thronged the wounded Admiral's antechamber, when the epileptic King
and the sleepy-eyed Queen Mother came to pay their visit of
sympathy. He had listened with misgivings to the braggart threats
of his co-religionists; with increased misgivings he had observed
the open hostility of their bearing towards Catherine de' Medici
what time she stood amongst them with Anjou, whilst the King her
son was closeted with his dear gossip, M. de Coligny. These
hot-headed fools, he felt, were fanning a fire that might presently
blaze out to consume them all. Already the Hotel de Guise was in a
state of fortification, filled with armed men ripe for any
mischief, whilst others of the Guisard faction were abroad exciting
public feeling with fantastic stories of the Huguenot peril,
stories which gathered colour from the turbulent, thrasonical
bearing of these Huguenots, enraged by the attempt upon their
leader's life.</p>

<p>And now, finding the gates of Paris barred for no apparent
reason, it seemed to M. de Putanges that the danger he had been
apprehending was close upon them, though in what form he could not
yet discern.</p>

<p>It was therefore as well that he should be forced to postpone
his journey into the country, however necessary, and that he should
remain to watch over his wife.</p>

<p>Now this was a consideration in which M. de Putanges discovered
a certain humour. He was a thoughtful gentleman with a lively sense
of irony, and it amused him after a certain bitter fashion to
observe his own mechanical obedience to his sense of duty towards
the cold, arrogant, discontented lady who bore his name. You know,
of course, of the beautiful Madame de Putanges and of the profound
impression which her beauty and wit had made upon the Court of
France upon this her first appearance there. It is even
rumoured&mdash;and not at all difficult to believe&mdash;that
amongst those who prostrated themselves in worship before her was
the very bridegroom Henri of Navarre himself. But at least the lady
was virtuous&mdash;her one saving grace in her husband's
eyes&mdash;and of a mind that was not to be discomposed by the
flattery of even a royal wooing. It is not without humour that the
only quality M. de Putanges could find to commend in her was that
same cold aloofness which so embittered him. It was a paradox upon
which he had found occasion to comment to his friend and cousin
Stanislas de la Vauvraye.</p>

<p>"The gods who cast her in a mould so fair have given her for
heart a stone."</p>

<p>That was the formula in which habitually he expressed it to
Stanislas, conscious that it sounded like a line from a play.</p>

<p>"I curse her for the very quality that makes my honour safe;
because this quality that in another woman would be a virtue, is
almost a vice in her."</p>

<p>And Stanislas, the gay trifler who turned all things to cynical
jest, had merely laughed. "Be content, Gaspard, with a blessing
denied most husbands."</p>

<p>Yet however little M. de Putanges might count himself blessed as
a husband, he was fully conscious of a husband's duty, and his
first thought now that he suspected trouble was for his wife.</p>

<p>He made his way to the <i>Veau qui Tète</i>, where his horses
were stabled and his grooms were housed, and, having dismounted
there, set out for the small house he temporarily occupied close
by, in the Rue Bellerose. The summer night had closed down by then,
but there was a fair moon that rendered the use of flambeaux
unnecessary. As he stepped out into the street he came upon a man
bent double under a load of pikes. It was an odd sight and M. de
Putanges stood arrested by it, watching the fellow as he staggered
down the narrow street until he was absorbed by the shadows of the
night. Yet even as he vanished a second man similarly laden came
stumbling past. M. de Putanges fell into step beside the
fellow.</p>

<p>"Whither are you carrying that arsenal?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The perspiring hind looked up from under his sinister load, to
answer this brisk authoritative questioner.</p>

<p>"It is for the entertainment at the Louvre, Monsieur."</p>

<p>As a gentleman in the train of the King of Navarre, M. de
Putanges was bidden to all court functions. Yet here was one of
which he had not so much as heard, and well might he ask himself
what entertainment was this that was being kept so secret and in
which pikes were to be employed. It was difficult to suppose that
their purpose could be festive.</p>

<p>With ever-mounting uneasiness M. de Putanges lengthened his
stride for home. But at the corner, where the Rue Bellerose cuts
across the more important Rue St Antoine, he ran into a group of
men on the threshold of an imposing house that was all in darkness.
At a glance he perceived that all were armed beyond the habit of
peaceful citizens. Headpiece and corselet glinted lividly in the
moonlight, and as he approached he caught from one on a note of
sinister laughter the word <i>"Parpaillots"</i>&mdash;the nickname
bestowed on members of the Huguenot party.</p>

<p>That was enough for M. de Putanges. Boldly&mdash;he was a man
who never lacked for boldness&mdash;he mingled with the little
throng. Others were joining it at every moment and already some
were passing into the house, so that his coming was hardly
observed; it would be assumed that he was one of themselves, bidden
like them to this assembly. Perceiving this, and overhearing from
one of those beside him the boast that by morning there would not
be a whole heretic skin in Paris, M. de Putanges determined to push
on and obtain more complete knowledge of what might be preparing.
Heedless, then, of risks, he thrust forward to the threshold and
attaching himself to a little knot of gentlemen in the act of
entering, he went in with them, and up a broad, scantily lighted
staircase. At the stair-head the foremost of the company knocked
upon a double door. One of its leaves was half opened and there
ensued between someone within and each of those who sought
admittance a preliminary exchange of confused murmurs. M. de
Putanges pushed nearer, straining his ears, and at last from one
whose mutter was louder than the others he caught the words:
"France and the Faith." A moment later he was giving the same
countersign.</p>

<p>He won through into a spacious gallery that was tolerably
lighted by four great girandoles, and already thronged by men from
every walk of life. All were armed and all were excited. From what
he observed, from what was said to him even&mdash;for there was
none here to recognize this gentleman of Béarn, or to suppose him
other than one of themselves&mdash;he quickly came to understand
that the thing preparing was no less than a massacre of the
Huguenots in Paris.</p>

<p>Anon, when the room was filled almost to the extent of its
capacity and the doors were closed, a lean, fiery-eyed preaching
friar, in the black and white habit of St Dominic, mounted a table
and delivered thence at length what might be called a "sermon of
the faith", a fierce denunciation of heresy.</p>

<p>"Hack it down, branch by branch, tear it up by the roots;
extirpate from the land this pestilential growth, this upas tree
that poisons the very air we breathe. About it, my children! Be
stern and diligent and unsparing in this holy work!"</p>

<p>Those terrible final words of incitement were ringing in his
ears when M. de Putanges quitted at last that chamber, with its
physically and morally mephitic atmosphere, and was borne out upon
a brawling, seething human torrent, into the clean air of early
dawn. The human mass broke into packs which turned away in one
direction and another to the cry&mdash;fierce and menacing as the
baying of hounds upon a scent&mdash;of "Parpaillots! Parpaillots!
Kill! Kill!"</p>

<p>He won free of them at length, forearmed at least by knowledge
of what to expect&mdash;by knowledge and something more. In that
chamber, whilst the sermon had been preaching, someone had tied a
strip of white calico to his left arm and set in his hat a cross
made of two short pieces of white ribbon. These were the insignia
of the slayers and in themselves would have afforded him immunity
in the open streets, but that upon an impulse of unreasoning
disgust he tore one and the other from him and flung them in the
kennel. This as he plunged at last down the Rue Bellerose towards
home.</p>

<p>In a measure as the sounds of his late companions receded from
him, ahead of him grew an ominous rumble, coming from the quays and
the neighbourhood of the river; and then, a crackling volley of
musketry rang out abruptly from the direction of the Louvre.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges stood still and wondered a moment whether the
faint flush in the sky was a herald of the early summer dawn or the
reflection of fire. He became suddenly aware that the Rue Bellerose
was astir with flitting shadows. He came upon a man setting a mark
in chalk upon a door, and, peering, beheld another similarly
engaged on the opposite side of the street. He understood the
meaning of it, and doubting if he would be alive by morning, he
considered almost dispassionately&mdash;for he was a dispassionate
man despite his southern blood&mdash;that it but remained him to
seek his wife and await his fate beside her. If they had never
known how to conduct their joint life becomingly, at least he hoped
they would know how to die becomingly together.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he reached his own threshold to find one
of the doorposts bearing the chalk sign that marked the inmates
down for slaughter. How well informed were these cursed
<i>papegots</i>, he thought; how well considered and well organized
was their bloody work! With his sleeve he rubbed out the sign of
doom. So much, at least, he could do in self-defence. And then he
stood arrested, with pulses faintly quickening. Within the shadows
of the deep porch something stirred, and at the same moment upon
the deep-set inner door fell a triple knock three times
repeated.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges stepped forward. Instantly the thing within the
porch swung about and sprang to meet him, taking definite shape. It
was a tall cowled figure in the white habit and black scapulary of
a brother of St Dominic. M. de Putanges realized that he came no
more than in time, if, indeed, he did not already come too late. He
felt his heart tightening at the thought, tightening with icy dread
for the cold termagant he loved. And then, to increase his fears,
the friar pronounced his name and so proclaimed that he was not
there by chance nor attracted by the mark of doom upon the
doorpost, but with sure knowledge of the house's inmates.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Putanges..." the man exclaimed, and got no further,
for utterance and breath were abruptly choked by the iron angers
that locked themselves about his throat.</p>

<p>The fellow writhed and struggled, thrusting out a leg to trip
his aggressor, clawing fiercely at the hands that were crushing out
his life, and tearing them with his nails. But tear as he might,
those hands would not relax their deadly grip. Soon his struggles
weakened; soon they became mere twitchings. His body sagged
together like an empty sack. He went down in a heap, dragging his
assailant with him, and lay still at last.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges stood over the fallen friar, breathing hard; the
beads of sweat upon his brow resulted partly from the exertion,
partly from horror of a thing done in such a cold, relentless
fashion. Mastering himself at last, he went forward towards the
door. To his surprise he found it open, and remembered then that
the friar had knocked upon it a moment ago. The latch was worked by
a cord from the floor above and must have been so worked in answer
to that knock.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges paused in the act of entering. It was not
well&mdash;particularly considering that his house had been
marked&mdash;to leave that thing in the porch where it might be
discovered. He went back and, taking the limp body by the arms, he
dragged it across the threshold into the hall. And then the
instinct of self-preservation that had guided him so far urged yet
another step. In that <i>papegot</i> livery it was possible that he
might find safety for himself and his wife from the perils that
were so obviously closing round them. The faintly reflected
radiance of the moon afforded sufficient light for the simple task.
In a moment he had unknotted the man's girdle and relieved him of
habit and scapulary. Over his own clothes he donned the Dominican's
loose white habit, and drew the cowl over his head. Then he closed
the door, and set foot upon the narrow stairs, even as from the
street outside a sudden shrieking of women was silenced by a
fusillade. The massacre, he perceived, was in full swing
already.</p>

<p>Overhead a light gleamed faintly; looking up from the darkness
that encompassed him, he beheld in the feeble aureole of a candle,
which she was holding, the face of Madame de Putanges. She was
peering down, seeking with her glance to pierce the darkness of the
staircase. He must speak at once, lest the sight of his monkish
figure should alarm her. But even as he conceived the thought her
silvery voice, strained now on an anxious note, forestalled
him.</p>

<p>"How late you are, Stanislas!" she said.</p>

<p>In the gloom of the staircase, Gaspard de Putanges stood
petrified, whilst through his mind that welcome meant for another
echoed and re-echoed: "How late you are, <i>Stanislas!</i>"</p>

<p>After a moment our gentleman's wits resumed their wonted
function, sharpened now perhaps beyond their usual keenness. He
scarcely needed to ask himself who could be this Stanislas for whom
she mistook him. It could be none other than his dear friend and
cousin, that gay trifler and libertine Stanislas de la Vauvraye.
And she was expecting him at a time when she must suppose M. de
Putanges already far from Paris. Was it possible, he asked himself,
that he had thus by chance stumbled upon the explanation of her
cold aloofness towards himself? Was Stanislas the Judas who
simulated friendship in order that he might the more conveniently
betray? In a flash a score of trifling incidents were suddenly
remembered and connected to flood the mind of M. de Putanges with
the light of revelation.</p>

<p>"Stanislas! Why don't you answer?" rang the impatient voice he
knew so well.</p>

<p>Whence this absolute assurance of hers that he was the man she
expected? He bethought him of that curious triple knock thrice
repeated with which the friar had sought admittance, and in
response to which the door-latch had been so promptly lifted from
above. It was a signal, of course. But, then, the friar...</p>

<p>On a sudden suspicion amounting almost to certainty, M. de
Putanges stepped back.</p>

<p>"Stanislas!" came again Madame de Putanges' call.</p>

<p>"A moment," he answered to quiet her. "I am coming."</p>

<p>He ran his fingers swiftly over the face and head of the man he
had choked. Here was no tonsure; no shaven cheeks. The hair of the
head was full and crisp; moustachios bristled on the lip, and a
little peaked beard sprouted from the chin: there was a jewel in
the left ear which, like the rest, was as it should be with
Stanislas de la Vauvraye. The garments were soft and silken&mdash;a
slashed doublet and the rest. No doubt remained. All that remained
was the mystery of how Stanislas should have come to be muffled in
that monkish robe. That, however, could wait. It mattered little in
comparison with all the rest. In his cursory examination of the
body, M. de Putanges had ascertained that the man still breathed.
He had not quite choked out his life. It was perhaps as well.</p>

<p>He locked the street-door and pocketed the key; then he went up
the stairs with a step that was as firm and steady as his
purpose.</p>

<p>When at last his cowled monkish figure came within the circle of
light of the waiting woman's candle, she started back.</p>

<p>"Why, what is this? Who are you, sir?" Then remembering the
covenanted knock to which she had opened, she partly explained the
monkish travesty. "Why do you come thus, Stanislas?"</p>

<p>"That," was the quiet answer, "we may ask presently of Stanislas
himself."</p>

<p>She staggered at the sound of her husband's voice, and a deathly
pallor overspread her face. Her dark eyes opened wide in terror:
her lips parted, but instead of speech they uttered a mere
inarticulate sound of fear and horror, almost piteous to hear. Then
she recovered, as he flung back his cowl and smiled upon her, grim,
and white-faced as herself.</p>

<p>"You!" she gasped.</p>

<p>He observed that she was dressed for travelling, cloaked and
hatted, and that a valise stood beside her at the stair-head.</p>

<p>"I thought you were gone to Poldarnes," she said stupidly, a
mere uncontrolled utterance of her mind.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, madame, to discompose you by so inopportune a
return. Circumstances compelled it, as I will presently
explain."</p>

<p>Then at last the termagant in her recovered the sway momentarily
extinguished by surprise.</p>

<p>"It needs no explanation, sir," she answered with angry scorn,
and angry unreason. "You returned to spy upon me."</p>

<p>"O fie, madame! To accuse me of that! But how unjust, how
foolishly unjust! Had you but honoured me with your confidence, had
you but informed me of your intent to elope with my dear friend and
kinsman, I should have left you a clear field. I am too fond of you
both to attempt against you so cruel a frustration of your
designs."</p>

<p>"You mean that you would have been glad to be rid of me!" was
her fierce reproach.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges laughed his bitter amusement that even in such a
situation she must make her own the grievance.</p>

<p>"Not glad, perhaps: but fortunate, madame," said he. "Once the
hurt and humiliation of it were overcome, I might have seen in my
dear kinsman Stanislas my best of friends."</p>

<p>She fastened swiftly upon this admission. "That is why I am
leaving you."</p>

<p>"But, of course. Do I not perceive it? I have, madame, a more
sympathetic understanding than you have ever done me the justice to
suppose."</p>

<p>She answered by no more than an inarticulate expression of
contempt.</p>

<p>"I shall hope to prove it to you tonight, madame," he insisted.
"You may come to account it as fortunate for yourself as it is
unfortunate for me that I returned. If you will be so good as to
step into the salon, I will fetch my dear cousin Stanislas."</p>

<p>This was to arouse her alarms afresh. "You will fetch him!" she
gasped. "Where...where is he?"</p>

<p>"He is below."</p>

<p>She was suddenly suspicious, glaring, fierce as a tigress. "What
have you done to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, be reassured!&mdash;no permanent injury. He is a
little...out of breath, shall we say? But that will pass."</p>

<p>"Let me go to him."</p>

<p>He barred her way. "It is not necessary. He shall come to you.
In no case can you depart just now. The streets are not safe.
Listen!" Vague, hideous sounds of the foul business that was afoot
penetrated the silence in which they stood, and filled her with
wonder and some dread. He enlightened her. "They are murdering the
Huguenots in Paris tonight. That is what brought me back, supposing
you would need protection, never dreaming that you would have the
dear, brave Stanislas so near at hand."</p>

<p>He took advantage of her amazement to add: "If you will forgive
the impertinence of the question, how long has M. de la Vauvraye
been your lover, madame?"</p>

<p>She flushed to her eyes. "Why must you insult me?"</p>

<p>"You are susceptible then to insult?"</p>

<p>Her anger, goaded by his cold mockery, raced on. "Should I have
stayed a single moment under your roof after taking a lover?" she
demanded passionately. "Do you think me capable of that?"</p>

<p>"I see," said M. de Putanges, and sighed. "You possess a
casuist's mind, madame. You swallow camels yet strain at
gnats."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I am honest, monsieur."</p>

<p>"After your own fashion, madame; strictly after your own
fashion."</p>

<p>"After my own fashion, if you will. You have a great gift for
mockery, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Be thankful, madame. The man who does not know how and when to
laugh, sometimes does very foolish and very painful things. And so,
you were saying that you are honest..."</p>

<p>"I think I prove it. Having taken my resolve, I am leaving your
house tonight. I am going away with M. de la Vauvraye."</p>

<p>She was defiant. He bowed to her will.</p>

<p>"Why, so you shall, for me. It remains to take measures for your
safety, considering what is happening in the street. Be so good as
to wait in the salon, whilst I fetch this dear Stanislas."</p>

<p>He took the candle from her limp hand and went down the stairs
again. He found his kinsman sitting up in bewilderment&mdash;a
bewilderment which the sight of M. de Putanges transmuted into
stark fear.</p>

<p>But M. de Putanges was of a reassuring urbanity. "Be good enough
to step up to the salon with me, my dear cousin. Henriette desires
a word with you, whereafter you may carry out or not your fond
intentions. That will depend. Meanwhile, be thankful that I have
returned in time, as I gather from what madame tells me. If the
harm were already beyond repair I should for my honour's sake be
compelled to renew, and this time to complete, the strangling of
you. That would be a painful matter for us both, for I have a
horror of violence, as you know, my dear Stanislas. Fortunately the
affair may still be amicably decided. The circumstances of the
night are particularly propitious. Be so good, then, as to come up
with me."</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye, his mind benumbed by this extraordinary turn
of what should have been so simple and delightful an adventure,
followed his kinsman up the stairs with an obedience of such utter
helplessness as to be almost entirely mechanical.</p>

<p>In the salon they found Madame awaiting them. She stood by the
heavy, carved table of dark oak well in the light of the dozen
tapers that burned in a gilded candlebranch. Her beautiful face was
pale and haggard, yet neither so pale nor so haggard as that of the
lover she now confronted in circumstances so vastly different from
all that she had expected of this night.</p>

<p>She had declared to him but yesterday that it was to be the most
fateful night of her life, and in that, indeed, she appeared to
have been a true prophet.</p>

<p>Of the three, the only one at ease&mdash;outwardly at
least&mdash;was M. de Putanges. Tall, erect, virilely handsome, a
man in the very flower of his age, bronzed, intrepid and aquiline
of countenance, he made the golden-headed trifler la Vauvraye seem
so sickly and effeminate by contrast that it was difficult to
discern how any woman could have come to prefer him.</p>

<p>"Be seated, pray." Suavity itself, M. de Putanges waved each in
turn to a chair. "I shall not keep you long."</p>

<p>La Vauvraye, under the woman's eyes, realizing that he was in
danger of cutting a poor, unheroic figure, summoned impudence to
his aid. "You relieve my fears, monsieur." With a shrug and a
half-laugh he sank to an armchair. He was not as successful as he
thought, for his crumpled ruff and dishevelled hair lent him an
appearance which dignity but made the more ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Your fears?" quoth M. de Putanges.</p>

<p>"Of being wearied by futile recriminations. Weariness is the
thing in life that I most dread."</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself. You are in no danger of it. Indeed, the
night should bring a surfeit of excitement even to such a glutton
for high adventure."</p>

<p>La Vauvraye stifled a yawn. "If you will but explain," he begged
on a half plaintive note.</p>

<p>"Of course. But first a question: How came you by this Dominican
frock in which I found you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" M. de la Vauvraye was casual. "You will know by now
what is afoot tonight. I, too, discovered it as I was coming here.
At the end of the Rue Bellerose I came upon a shaveling I had met
once or twice at Court. Unfortunately for him, he knew me too, and
calling me by name threatened me with a heretic's doom. It was
rash. I had a dagger...I silenced that too garrulous friar, and
left him in a doorway."</p>

<p>"Possessing yourself of his habit?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I realized that on such a night his scapulary would
possess the virtues that are claimed for scapularies, would be a
panoply against all perils. You would seem to have been of the same
mind yourself when, taking me unawares, you became possessed of it
and donned it in your turn."</p>

<p>"And then, dear cousin? Continue, pray."</p>

<p>"What more is there to tell?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you counted upon the frock to shield not only
yourself but this Huguenot lady with whom you had planned an
elopement for tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh, that, of course." The nonchalance was almost overdone.</p>

<p>"It was my notion, too. Since we are both agreed as to its
excellence, there is no reason not to act upon it."</p>

<p>The affected languor passed from M. de la Vauvraye's eyes. They
became alert and keen to the point almost of anxiety. M. de
Putanges proceeded to explain himself.</p>

<p>"Madame de Putanges must be saved," he said quietly. "That, you
will realize, is the paramount consideration. She must be carried
out of reach of this bloodshed before it is too late. Escorted by a
brother of St Dominic the thing is easy. We have but to determine
which of us shall assume the frock and take her hence, which shall
remain behind to die nobly for her sake. Since we both love her,
the decision should be easy, for neither of us should hesitate to
remain. Rather do I fear a generous emulation as to which shall
go." He dealt so delicately in irony that neither of his listeners
could be certain that he was ironical.</p>

<p>With blanched cheeks and bulging eyes, M. de la Vauvraye stared
at his cousin, waiting. The handsome woman seated in the
high-backed chair looked on with parted lips, her breathing
quickened, and waited, too.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges resumed: "But for what is taking place in Paris
tonight, my dear cousin, it might be necessary to choose some other
way of resolving this painful situation. As it is, our common
concern for Madame de Putanges points the way clearly. One of us
goes. The other stays behind to die. Ideal and complete solution.
It but remains to determine our respective parts." He paused and
the silence within that room was tense and heavy. Outside was
uproar&mdash;the baying of the fanatical mob, the crash of shivered
timbers and the screams of luckless victims.</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye moistened his parched lips with his
tongue.</p>

<p>"And how...how is that to be determined?" he asked in a
quavering, high-pitched voice that cracked on the last word.</p>

<p>"What way but one could gallantry conceive? It is for Madame de
Putanges to choose." He bowed deferentially, as he consigned into
her hands that monstrous decision.</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye expressed in a gasp his immense relief, never
doubting Madame's choice, never observing the stark horror that
distorted her lovely face, nor how that horror deepened at the
sound he made.</p>

<p>But M. de Putanges had something yet to add. He was being
extremely subtle, where neither of his listeners suspected
subtlety.</p>

<p>"Thus, madame, you shall have at last the choice that should
have been yours at first. It is in your power tonight to repair the
injustice that was done you three years ago when, unconsulted, you
were driven into a wedlock of arrangement." He sighed. "Perhaps had
I wooed you first and wed you afterwards all might have been well
with us. I realize tonight the profound mistake of reversing that
natural course of things, and I am almost glad of the opportunity
to correct it, by giving you now, late though it be, the choice
that is a woman's right. So pronounce, madame. Determine of your
own free will which of us shall assume the frock and bear you
hence, which shall remain to die."</p>

<p>On that he ended, looking with solemn inscrutable glance deep
into the eyes that stared at him out of his wife's white,
horror-stricken face. He knew&mdash;unless he knew nothing of human
nature&mdash;that the woman did not live who could take upon her
conscience the responsibility of such a choice: and upon that
knowledge he was boldly trading.</p>

<p>To help him to his deep end, came the bleating voice of his
foolish rival, urgent with an obvious meaning that he dared not
actually express in words. "Henriette! Henriette!"</p>

<p>M. de Putanges observed her shrink and cringe before that
appeal, as if conscious only of the meanness and cowardice that
inspired it. Upon something of that kind, too, had he counted. He
intended to compel her tonight to look, as she had never yet
troubled to look, into his soul. And he intended no less to lay
bare the little soul of the trifler for whom she would have left
him. She should have the free choice he offered her; but first
there should be full revelation to guide her in her choice.</p>

<p>"Well, madame?" He loosened the girdle of his monkish habit, as
if to stress his readiness for renunciation at her bidding. "Which
of us shall wear the frock, the scapulary of salvation&mdash;more
potently protecting tonight than any consecrated prophylactic?"</p>

<p>And again from M. de la Vauvraye&mdash;now half risen&mdash;came
the appeal&mdash;"Henriette!"</p>

<p>Madame de Putanges looked with the glance of a hunted creature
from one to the other of those men. Then a shudder ran through her;
she twisted and untwisted the fingers of her interlocked hands, and
faintly moaned.</p>

<p>"I cannot! I cannot!" she cried out at last. "No&mdash;no! I
cannot have the blood of either of you on my soul."</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye flung himself back in his chair, his lip in
his teeth, his hands clenched, whilst M. de Putanges smiled with
wistful understanding.</p>

<p>"Yet consider, madame," he urged her, "that unless you choose we
are likely all three of us to perish here together."</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't! I will not choose. It is monstrous to demand
it of me," she cried.</p>

<p>"Demand?" echoed M. de Putanges. "Oh, madame, I do not demand; I
invite. But to spare your feelings, since you prove so tender in
this matter, it shall be determined otherwise; and that I must
deplore, because in no other way could your future happiness be
assured. Still..." He broke off, and flung the Dominican frock and
scapulary, of which he had now divested himself, upon the table;
then he turned to a tall press that stood against the wall, and
took from one of its drawers a dice-box. Rattling the cubes in
their leathern container, he looked across at his kinsman.</p>

<p>"Come, cousin. You love a hazard. Here is one in which the
stakes are something rare: love and life are here for one of
us."</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye, who had risen, shrank back in fear. If he
loved hazards, he loved them not quite so hazardous.</p>

<p>"No, no," he cried, thrusting out his hands in a violent gesture
of denial. "This is a horror."</p>

<p>"What else remains?" asked M. de Putanges. "Come, man. I'll lead
the way."</p>

<p>He threw recklessly as he spoke, thereby committing the other to
the adventure. The three cubes scattered and rattled to a
standstill on the polished oaken board. Madame's glittering eyes
followed them and remained expressionless when the throw was
revealed&mdash;two aces and a deuce.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges laughed softly, bitterly. "That is my luck," said
he. "You should have known that I was not to be feared, Stanislas.
You'll scarce hesitate now to throw against me."</p>

<p>Yet he was pleased enough in the heart of him. Fortune could not
have served him better. Now that no risk remained M. de la Vauvraye
would be as eager as before he had been hesitant, and so should
make yet further self-revelation. And eager he was. It was his turn
to laugh as with trembling fingers he gathered up the dice; a
hectic flush tinged his cheekbones as he threw&mdash;two fives and
a four.</p>

<p>"Mine!" he cried, and snatched up the frock in exultation.</p>

<p>M. de Putanges bowed with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>"My congratulations, cousin; and to you, madame, since surely
Fortune must have determined as you wish, yet dared not pronounce
out of a generous thought for me. For that thought I thank you.
What now remains for me will be the easier in the knowledge that it
comes not from you, but from Fortune." He became matter-of-fact and
brisk. "You had best make haste away. There is danger in
delaying."</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed&mdash;he is right," M. de la Vauvraye now urged
her, as he shook out the folds of the frock and with trembling
fingers knotted the girdle about his middle.</p>

<p>But Madame made no answer to either of them. With eyes of wonder
she looked from one to the other, contrasting the noble calm in
adversity of this husband she had never known, with the meanly
selfish eagerness of the shallow courtier whom she had imagined
that she loved. M. de Putanges had promised himself to afford her
full revelation; and he had succeeded beyond his hopes.</p>

<p>M. de la Vauvraye took a step towards her. "Come, Henriette," he
was beginning, when suddenly she laughed so oddly that he checked.
She looked at him with shining eyes and oddly smiling lips.</p>

<p>"Do not wait for me, monsieur. All that it was yours to stake
upon the throw was the scapulary that will shield your life. You
have won that, and so you may win to safety. But I do not go with
the scapulary. Good night and good fortune to you, M. de la
Vauvraye."</p>

<p>He stared at her, dumbfounded, stricken in his scanty wits and
in his monstrous vanity.</p>

<p>"What?" he cried. "You will remain?"</p>

<p>"With my husband, if you please, monsieur."</p>

<p>Quiet and self-contained in the background beyond the table M.
de Putanges looked on and wondered. M. de la Vauvraye rapped out an
oath. Then anger bubbled to the surface of his shallow nature. His
tone became vicious.</p>

<p>"Good night, madame."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel; but as he reached the door her voice
arrested him.</p>

<p>"M. de la Vauvraye!"</p>

<p>He turned again.</p>

<p>"A man in your place would have acted perhaps more generously. A
man would have remembered all that is involved. A man would account
that my final decision overrides the decision of the dice. He would
have proffered the scapulary to the true winner. A man would have
done that. But you, it seems, are something less. Since it has been
tested, I am the more content to stay."</p>

<p>He looked at her from the depths of the cowl which he had
already pulled over his head, so that his face was no longer
visible. Without answering her he went out, closing the door with
expressive violence. They heard his steps go pattering down the
stairs, and then the sound of them was drowned in the uproar from
without.</p>

<p>They looked at each other across the table. M. de Putanges
sighed as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Did I conceive him worthy of you, madame, I should not have
suffered you to have had your way. Even now I doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gaspard," she interrupted him, "I am content. I have chosen,
even though I have chosen too late." She held out a hand to him,
and he saw that she was weeping. He took the hand and very tenderly
stooped to kiss it.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "it but remains for us to forgive each
other."</p>

<p>As he spoke the air was shaken by a sudden roar, deeper,
fiercer, nearer than any that had gone before. She sank against him
shuddering in sudden fear. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"Wait." Swiftly he quenched the lights. Then in the darkness he
groped to the shutters, opened them and flung the window wide.</p>

<p>Screened by the gloom above, they looked down into the seething,
furious mob revealed by torchlight and the breaking day.</p>

<p>In the clutches of a knot of frenzied men, a Dominican friar was
struggling wildly.</p>

<p>"Let us look at your face," they were howling. "Let us make sure
that you are what you seem&mdash;that you are not the villain who
murdered Father Gerbier and stole his frock."</p>

<p>The cowl was suddenly torn back, and the livid, distorted face
of Stanislas de la Vauvraye was revealed.</p>

<p>"We have found you at last, you murdering heretic!" cried a
voice and a pike was swung above the Huguenot's luckless head. A
roar arose: "Kill! Kill! Death to the Parpaillot!"</p>

<p>M. de Putanges pulled his wife back and closed the window, and
the shutters. She clung to him in the dark.</p>

<p>"My God!" she moaned. "Had he been generous: had I been mad..."
She said no more; she fell on her knees to pray.</p>

<p>Through the remainder of that night of St Bartholomew they
waited hand in hand for death. It was, they said thereafter, their
true nuptial night. But death did not seek them. M. de Putanges,
you will remember, had rubbed the sign of doom from the doorpost
with his sleeve, and the house was not molested. Three days later,
when the reaction had set in, they quietly slipped out of Paris
unchallenged, and made their way back to Béarn having found each
other.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. THE REMEDY</h2>

<p>GEORGE JEFFERYS, Baron Jefferys of Wem and Lord Chief Justice of
England, rolled away in his carriage through the September
twilight, from Taunton Castle, and the labours of the day. Morose
beside him sat the Deputy-Lieutenant of the County, Sir John
Kirkby, whose hospitality his lordship was temporarily enjoying at
Kernstone Park.</p>

<p>A single flaw destroyed the satisfaction my lord might have
taken in the consciousness of ruthless duty ruthlessly discharged.
The day had been a busy one. Fully one fourth of the six hundred
prisoners awaiting trial on charges of more or less direct
implication in the Monmouth Rebellion had been dispatched, and upon
some fifty-three of these sentence of death had been passed.
Expeditiousness marked the course of that assize, to be known to
posterity as the Bloody. Because His Majesty King James II had been
badly scared by the rebellion of his bastard nephew, the Protestant
Champion, vindictiveness sharpened the natural cruelty of his
egotistical soul. His orders were clear. No mercy was to be shown
the unhappy rebels who because of the nature of their offence were
by law denied legal assistance. The Lord Chief Justice,
understanding that he was concerned not with justice, but with
vengeance, addressed himself to his ugly task with a ruthlessness
that faithfully reflected the wishes of his master. With malignant
zest he laid the souls not only of prisoners, but of such as dared
to appear as witnesses for the defence, upon the rack of a
ferocious, hectoring cross-examination, and from their tortured
writhings he appeared to derive a voluptuous satisfaction.</p>

<p>Sir John Kirkby, practically compelled by his official position
to afford his lordship hospitality, was constrained to use him with
the courtesy due from host to guest. But he did not find it easy.
The heart of this honest upright gentleman was filled with
abhorrence of the cruelty he had seen that day unleashed. He had
heard sentence of death passed where the grounds of offence seemed
far from proven, the evidence in favour of the accused being
fiercely rent to shreds by his lordship before it could be
examined, and the jury browbeaten into finding verdicts against
reason and against conscience.</p>

<p>It had been the more appalling to Sir John because amongst the
prisoners still awaiting trial there was one very dear to him, a
young squire of Chitton, Godfrey Mohun by name, whose only offence
lay in that he had sheltered a wounded friend who had been in the
fight at Sedgemoor. Godfrey Mohun was betrothed to Sir John's only
daughter, whose anguished fears Sir John had soothed with
assurances that a heavy fine would be the utmost penalty exacted
from her lover. And this Sir John had believed. But what he had
seen today not merely shattered the belief, it dejected him with
the conviction that Godfrey was foredoomed.</p>

<p>He had witnessed the case of a Bridgewater surgeon, taken in the
act of patching up the wounds of one who had been out with
Monmouth. This surgeon, a bold-eyed, masterful Irishman named Peter
Blood, had rested a spirited defence upon the humane ground that
what he had done had been in the discharge of his surgeon's office;
that all his concern had been with the sufferer's wounds, and none
with his politics; and he had offered to bring a score of witnesses
to testify that he had detested the rebellion.</p>

<p>This defence Jeffreys had swept contemptuously aside. He had
taken his stand upon the legal axiom that who knowingly comforts,
harbours or succours a rebel is himself guilty of rebellion, and
upon that, with much blasphemous calling upon God to witness
against the proud, insolent carriage of the accused, he had
sentenced the surgeon to death.</p>

<p>Thereupon that bold fellow in the dock, his arrogance untamed by
the doom pronounced upon him, had dealt the judge measure for
measure.</p>

<p>"Your lordship, being the justiciar," he had said, his clear,
metallic voice ringing through the hushed court, "speaks with
knowledge of what is to come to me. I, being a physician, speak
with knowledge of what is to come to your lordship. And I tell you
that I would not exchange the halter that you fling about my neck
for the stone that you carry in your body. The death to which you
send me is a light pleasantry by contrast with the death to which
your lordship has been doomed by that Great Judge with whose name
your lordship makes so free."</p>

<p>Those acquainted with the savage moods to which my Lord Jeffreys
so freely yielded had waited in awe for an outburst that never
came. The authority of those words had numbed a brain upon which
they were seared as by an acid. The judge sank back in his great
chair, bathed from head to foot in sweat, and in the grip of such
sudden renal torture that it was as if the pronouncement of that
physician had possessed the power to arouse the virulence of the
disease from which his lordship suffered.</p>

<p>Still haunted by those words, haunted by the intrepid
countenance and bold glance of that vile fellow, Jeffreys sat
hunched now in the coach, vainly seeking comfort in the vindictive
thought that the villain who had cast this spell upon him&mdash;for
so he was by now supposing&mdash;would presently hang, and his head
and quarters, boiled and tarred, be set up as a warning to others
of his rascally kind.</p>

<p>That night, at Sir John's hospitable board, my lord drank to an
excess that was secretly reprobated by his sober host. This was my
lord's common practice. When in the grip of an attack, he sought
and found in strong drink a temporary relief, only to make payment
for it in increased suffering on the morrow. In this some have
charitably seen the source of his ferocity upon the bench. Tonight
he quaffed his host's Nantes as if it had been mere sack, in an
endeavour not merely to lull his pains, but to exorcise the
haunting ghost of Doctor Peter Blood's sentence.</p>

<p>They sat more or less in silence, these men of about the same
age, both under forty, each sunk in his own preoccupations. They
were both tall men, but whereas Sir John was of a robust vigour and
the ruddy, weathered countenance resulting from a life in the open,
Jeffreys was delicately and elegantly shaped. His pallid face
within the frame of the heavy black periwig was more than
ordinarily handsome; it was finely featured, with great liquid eyes
and a full-lipped mouth, shapely enough, yet holding something that
lessened the attractiveness of the whole.</p>

<p>Observing the deep drinking of this guest with whose nature he
was still but indifferently acquainted, Sir John conceived a hope
that his lordship might be of those whose natures are softened in
their cups. For, in his despair, it was in his mind to plead for
Godfrey Mohun's life, however much his clear commonsense might warn
him that to plead with such a man in such a cause would be idle and
might even be dangerous.</p>

<p>Whilst he still hesitated, Fate took charge of the matter. The
brandy with which he made so free was weakening my lord's stern
will, urging him to open his mind and disclose its tormenting
obsession. He came to it almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"You do not drink with me, Sir John," he had complained.</p>

<p>"I lack your lordship's occasion," was the civil answer, in
reference to an earlier allusion by Jeffreys to the anodyne power
of the Nantes.</p>

<p>"Occasion? Odslife! May I burn forever if good brandy needs
occasion." He drained his glass, and reached at once for the heavy
decanter. "It's an elixir vitae, no less. You'ld be the better of
another glass, Sir John."</p>

<p>But Sir John waved away the proffered decanter. "I have never
yet taken a servant likely to become my master."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Jeffreys sneered. To his sophisticated mind there was a
crudeness in this rustic sobersides. In his view the fellow
betrayed a spirit akin to that of the snivelling, canting
jack-presbyters responsible for the recent troubles in the West.
"You little know what medicine this is."</p>

<p>"I am glad your lordship finds recovery in it."</p>

<p>"Recovery?" Jeffreys fetched a sigh, and followed it by a
saturnine laugh, short as a gasp. "Lord God! There's no recovery
for such an ill as mine. You heard that rebel doctor rogue in court
today, giving me back sentence for sentence to ease his spite.
Yet&mdash;damn his soul!&mdash;a shrewd, discerning dog to read so
much in a face." It was my lord's delusion that his malady was a
secret unsuspected by the world at large. "But not physician enough
to supply a remedy. Because I was so foolish as to suppose it,
would you believe that I made myself a butt for his further spite?"
He paused before explaining himself. "When the court rose I sent my
man Greaves to question him. The scoundrel laughed. 'Tell my lord,'
says he, 'that the only known remedy for his ailment is the very
one which he has prescribed me for mine. A hempen necktie.' And the
dog laughed! Let him laugh in Hell, when the hangman's done with
him."</p>

<p>"What else could you look for," ventured Sir John, "in a man who
conceived himself so harshly used?"</p>

<p>"Harshly? Harshly, d'ye say? Well, maybe. Justice is harsh, sir.
And he had justice."</p>

<p>"That he had no mercy is more certain. And all his own offence
lay in being merciful, in practising Christian charity, in taking
no thought for himself where suffering had to be relieved. Bear
with me if I say that, my lord."</p>

<p>"Say it, and be damned," growled my lord rudely. "It's but the
snivelling cant he urged in his defence. D'ye suppose I am come
into these parts on an errand of mercy? His Majesty's orders are
precise. An example is to be made. Were I to fail in my duty
through mercy, I could look for no mercy, myself, from a justly
outraged master." Then his tone changed. It became reflectively
maudlin. "Yet this dog of a surgeon might have found it. He should
have known that in mocking my misfortune he mocked his own. For
just as it was sentence for sentence between us, so reprieve for
reprieve might have followed."</p>

<p>Sir John raised his head sharply. There was a startled
quickening of his glance.</p>

<p>"Despite His Majesty's orders? Despite the law and to a man
convicted of high treason?"</p>

<p>"Despite the fiend himself. I'ld have taken the risk of giving
him a reprieve in exchange for a sure remedy, as any would in my
case."</p>

<p>Sir John continued to stare at him, and that curious startled
look in his clear blue eyes had the effect of exasperating my lord
into further explanation.</p>

<p>"Have I, then, no duty to myself?" The fine white hand made an
impatient gesture. "Do you conceive the pain that grips and rends
my entrails when I am under an attack of this damned disease? And
to suffer without hope of ultimate surcease; to know that I must
continue at times to endure, until one day, be it soon, be it late,
this thing will make an end of me!" He laughed, bitterly saturnine.
"That rebel doctor today has made me feel as if my end is near, as
if I, too, am under sentence of death. Think of the haunting horror
of that. The King might not forgive me if he knew that I bought
relief at the expense of duty to him. But, as God's my life, I
might forgive myself. My conscience would be at ease."</p>

<p>He reached for his glass, and took another pull at the brandy,
whilst Sir John, moved to a deeper abhorrence by this squeal for
pity from one who was himself so pitiless, sat very still awhile,
his eyes lowered. When at long length he spoke, he used a quiet
reflective tone.</p>

<p>"Strange how little our men of medicine can help a sufferer in
his need, how seldom they can cure your graver ills even when they
detect them. Yet I believe that people who in other matters are as
barbarians compared with us in England are not so helpless. The
savage Redskins of America, I am told, possess medicines of which
we are ignorant. Why, in these parts there is a gentleman, Godfrey
Mohun by name, a country squire who spent some years in Italy, who
is reputed to have come home again with secrets of healing and lore
of medicine of which our doctors here know nothing." He paused
there, to add slowly: "I believe&mdash;I will not make oath upon
it, but I believe&mdash;that I have heard it said that the stone is
among the supposed incurable diseases for which he possesses a sure
remedy."</p>

<p>My lord's attention, at first indifferent, was now suddenly
alert.</p>

<p>"Lord God! What do you tell me? A sure remedy? You know such a
man?"</p>

<p>A little smile of deprecation hovered on the lips of the
Deputy-Lieutenant. "I have good cause to know him&mdash;officially.
He lies at present under your lordship's hand. He is among those
awaiting trial in Taunton Castle."</p>

<p>"Another rebel dog?"</p>

<p>Sir John shrugged and sighed. "Your lordship is in a county in
which the canker of rebellion was widespread."</p>

<p>"Ah! But a sure remedy for the stone? That is what you
said?"</p>

<p>"That is what I believe is said."</p>

<p>The handsome face of the judge was darkened by thought. His hand
shook as it set down the glass.</p>

<p>"Was he actively in arms?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, no. Far from it. Of this, at least, my knowledge is
positive. Loyal to his King, he abhorred the rebellion, as all the
country knows. But he sheltered a fugitive from Sedgemoor."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said my lord, and again took thought for a moment. A
febrile flush had crept to his cheekbones, and a glitter to the
eyes that were sharply levelled on his host. "I may have cause to
thank God for that," he said at last. "The fool may be eager enough
to earn acquittal. I will see him tomorrow before the court
sits."</p>

<p>Sir John's glance avoided the fevered eyes of his guest. "I
see," he said, and added after a moment's thought: "In that case
would it not be best to have him brought here? Shall I send an
order to the Governor of Taunton Castle?"</p>

<p>"That's it." Jeffreys' voice trembled. "Have him fetched. Have
him fetched early."</p>

<p>Sir John's obedience was punctual. Himself he brought the
prisoner from the Castle on the following morning, and went to
awaken Jeffreys with word that Mohun was at hand to wait upon his
lordship.</p>

<p>The reckless haste in which my lord sprang from the great
canopied bed brought a grinding pain to his loins that momentarily
crippled him. It brought, too, a flood of blasphemy to his lips.
When the spasm had eased, he passed, wrapped in a flaming bedgown,
his cropped head swathed in a silken kerchief, into the adjacent
anteroom.</p>

<p>There Jeffreys found a soberly-dressed young man, tall and
well-knit, of an olive-skinned face that was grave, intelligent and
kindly. Without embarrassment he bore the cold appraising glance of
this Chief Justice who, for all his shortcomings, was something of
a judge of men.</p>

<p>After that sharp scrutiny my lord found himself a chair, and Sir
John came to stand beside him. Jeffreys spoke gently.</p>

<p>"It grieves me, sir, to discover a gentleman of your parts in
such sad case. I ask myself what influences can have seduced you
into treason."</p>

<p>"I have committed none, may it please your lordship." Mohun's
voice was pleasant, its tone quiet and level. "Not only had I no
part in the late rising, but I used all my little influence against
it, as I shall prove by witnesses when I come to trial. It is true
that after Sedgemoor I gave shelter to a misguided friend who had
been in the battle..."</p>

<p>There Jeffreys interrupted him. "That, sir, was your treason.
Were you not aware of the law? Who comforts or succours a rebel is
thereby, himself, guilty of rebellion."</p>

<p>"Concern for my friend was my only thought, my lord."</p>

<p>"That is no answer, sir, not though it had been your own
brother, or your father. The Attorney-General's instructions from
His Majesty are definite; wisely and prudently definite. Strict
justice will be meted out in this assize; but no mercy, because the
offence against our Sovereign Lord admits of none." He paused a
moment before continuing. "If in spite of this I have sent for you,
it is because I must regret that a man on your attainments should
pay with his head for such an indiscretion, and that all the
knowledge which Sir John tells me you have amassed abroad should be
lost to mankind."</p>

<p>Mr Mohun inclined his head. "I am very sensible of your
lordship's interest."</p>

<p>His lordship's liquid eyes solemnly considered him.</p>

<p>"Sir John tells me that in Italy you came by much unusual
medical lore."</p>

<p>"In Italy and elsewhere. It was my fortune to find men
generously ready to communicate their knowledge, and in the East I
came by some precious secrets which it has been my hope to employ
for the relief of sufferers."</p>

<p>"I commend the desire, sir. Your claims are high. I wonder if I
might put them to the test. Do you suppose, for instance, that you
could detect what ails me?"</p>

<p>There was a lift of Mohun's brows, as if he were given
unsuspected news. "Your lordship is ailing?"</p>

<p>"You shall tell me in what. Thus I may judge your worth."</p>

<p>Mohun made bold to approach him. "By your lordship's leave." He
took my lord's wrist delicately in hand. After some moments he
delivered himself. "The pulse is weak. Too weak, and too
irregular." With a forefinger he drew down my lord's eyelid,
looking carefully. "Poverty of blood," he opined, and abruptly
asked: "Where do you suffer pain?"</p>

<p>"Did I speak of pain?"</p>

<p>"I should judge it to be present. If it is not, then the
mischief has not yet gone far. But without pain to point the way, I
can travel no farther, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then I will help you." Jeffreys stood up and carried a hand to
the right side of the small of his back. "It is here."</p>

<p>Mr Mohun set his fingers to the place, and pressed until his
lordship squirmed and cursed him.</p>

<p>"A renal mischief," the young man pronounced. "Is the pain
constant?"</p>

<p>"Not constant. No. Sometimes I have relief for days. Sometimes
for days I suffer like the damned."</p>

<p>"As if a knife were being turned in your entrails. You break
into cold sweats; your senses swim; you are taken with nausea. You
find relief in strong drink, only to pay for that relief by acuter
pain upon the morrow."</p>

<p>Jeffreys' eyes reflected his astonishment. "You describe me very
exactly." He sat down again, pulling the bedgown about his limbs.
"And the cause? Do you discover that?"</p>

<p>Mr Mohun's eyes were grave with sympathy. "Your lordship is
troubled with a stone; a hideous guest to harbour."</p>

<p>"And one for which they tell me no remedy is known."</p>

<p>There Mohun smiled. "Not to those who tell you so."</p>

<p>"And to you?" My lord betrayed a sudden breathlessness.</p>

<p>"I know of a remedy as sure as it is swift. It is commonly
prepared from a herb grown in the East."</p>

<p>"What herb?"</p>

<p>For a moment Mr Mohun seemed at fault. Then, "It goes by the
name of Cannabis," he said.</p>

<p>"Cannabis? Cannabis?" His lordship was searching a memory that
the word had stirred. "I've heard of it. But what? Ah, yes. A drug
that intoxicates the senses, does it not? Conjures voluptuous
dreams?"</p>

<p>"That is Cannabis of another sort, commonly known as <i>Cannabis
Indica.</i> The Cannabis that will cure your ill is <i>Cannabis
Pensilis.</i>"</p>

<p><i>"Cannabis Pensilis,"</i> his lordship repeated after him
slowly.</p>

<p>"And a sure remedy you say?" Briskly he added the question: "How
long to fetch it from the East?"</p>

<p>"The preparation from it that will serve your lordship's case
can be found in England in abundance. I could procure it for
you."</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of the answer produced a sudden frenzy of
eagerness. "How soon? I am in haste, man. These days I have been
suffering the torments of the pit. How soon can you procure
it?"</p>

<p>Mr Mohun was cool. "As soon as I am acquitted."</p>

<p>That gave Lord Jeffreys pause. He glared in sudden
resentment.</p>

<p>"God's my life! You make sure of acquittal. Do you make too
sure? What if you should not be acquitted?"</p>

<p>Mr Mohun spread his hands. "Being without liberty to seek the
remedy I should be as sorry for your lordship as for myself."</p>

<p>My lord conceived himself with his back to a wall before the
point of a sword. It was a position of ignominy that he resented.
But he realized that resentment here was a wasted emotion. "I
wonder," he said, "are you to be trusted."</p>

<p>"As your lordship pleases. I can do no more than pledge myself
to supply so much of this <i>Cannabis Pensilis</i>, properly
prepared, as will give you swift and permanent relief."</p>

<p>"Swift and permanent relief! That is your promise, is it?"</p>

<p>"No less."</p>

<p>Jeffreys rose. "Look you: if there is compassion in your nature,
you, who from your knowledge must be aware of what I suffer, will
not dare to fail me, even without the debt that you will owe me
after trial."</p>

<p>In that implied promise the Lord Chief Justice reckoned without
the Attorney-General, Mr Pollexfen, whose instructions from the
throne were as definite and merciless as his own. For when Godfrey
Mohun came up that day for trial in the hall of Taunton Castle, and
made his plea of "Not guilty", Mr Pollexfen, a large, dark man,
swung with a gesture of wrathful impatience to the bench and the
four commissioners in their scarlet robes over whom Jeffreys
tyrannically presided.</p>

<p>"May it please your lordships to take notice that we have here
yet another forsworn rascal who being taken red-handed in treason
would none the less waste the time of this overburdened court by a
plea that cannot be sustained."</p>

<p>Jeffreys' tart answer was startling in its unusualness.</p>

<p>"Look you, Mr Attorney, you are not to usurp our functions. It
is for you to submit evidence of the facts alleged, and for
us&mdash;not for you, as you seem to think&mdash;to deliver
judgment."</p>

<p>Stunned for a moment by that rebuff, Mr Pollexfen stared,
open-mouthed, from under scowling brows, his large, swarthy face
empurpling.</p>

<p>My lord sat back in his high chair, dabbing his lips with a
filmy handkerchief. He was very pale and there were deep stains
under his eyes. The pain in his loins was acute that morning, his
irascibility at fever pitch, and to delay a conclusion that was to
bring him a step nearer to relief was merely to quicken his
ferocity.</p>

<p>Still shaken, Mr Pollexfen called his first witness, the officer
who had arrested Mohun upon discovering the fugitive rebel in his
house.</p>

<p>Jeffreys reclined, with closed eyes, whilst the man gave his
evidence. At the end of it, Mr Pollexfen addressed the bench.</p>

<p>"I have six more witnesses in attendance if your lordships think
it necessary to hear them."</p>

<p>My lord opened his eyes wide at that and let them blaze on the
Attorney. "If they take us no further than this one, you will but
waste our time, Mr Attorney."</p>

<p>"So I judged, my lord. This rebel's guilt could not be more
fully established."</p>

<p>"I hope that is merely your submission," was the acid answer.
"But I tell you, sir, that it does not satisfy me. It is our duty,
who sit here, to hold the scales of justice level."</p>

<p>In all his experience Mr Pollexfen had never heard so monstrous
a lie. Amazement crumpled him, whilst the Lord Chief Justice for
the first time in the course of that ruthless assize went about
dealing with a witness for the prosecution in the manner which he
usually reserved for the scarification of witnesses for the
defence.</p>

<p>"Now prithee tell me truly, sirrah, is it within your knowledge
that the accused was aware that this man Netley had been at
Sedgemoor?"</p>

<p>The officer, entirely at his ease, was answering jauntily: "It
is evident, my lord, from the fact that he concealed him..." when,
to interrupt him, Jeffreys leaned forward over his writing pulpit,
and for scorn and wrath and menace his voice was like a sword.</p>

<p>"I did not ask, sirrah, what is evident from the fact. I asked
what is the fact. As God's my life, I think there are too many
judges in this court this morning. Mr Attorney, there, delivers
judgment before the evidence has been heard, and you, it seems,
presume to emulate him." His voice swelled up. "I would not terrify
you to make you say anything but the truth; but assure yourself I
never met with a lying, sneaking fellow but I always treasured up
vengeance for him. Therefore look to it that you do not prevaricate
with me, for be sure you'll come by the worst of it in the end. Now
I ask you again&mdash;and I counsel you to answer me
straitly&mdash;will you take the God of Heaven to witness that
Mohun knew that Netley had been in the battle?"</p>

<p>The officer, brave enough no doubt in the field, trembled now
under the lash of that viperish tongue. He shuffled his feet, pawed
the bar before him with nervous hands, and his voice shook as he
faltered: "To be sure I cannot swear that..."</p>

<p>But he had said enough for Jeffreys. To let him say more might
be to spoil it.</p>

<p>"You cannot swear!" his lordship interrupted, roaring. "God! In
what a generation do we live? You come here to swear away the life
of a fellow-creature, and when I press you, you confess to
ignorance of the fact, the only material fact, upon which you are
here to speak. I have done with you. Stand down, sir. Stand
down."</p>

<p>In the terrified hush of the crowded court, that formidable
dispenser of justice swung again to the bewildered
Attorney-General. "If your other witnesses are of this kind, Mr
Attorney, you do well to say that we need not hear them. I must, as
I've a conscience, direct the gentlemen of the jury that there is
no evidence to support the indictment of Mr Mohun."</p>

<p>"No evidence, my lord?" Furiously Mr Pollexfen gathered his
scattered forces, and drove straight at the heart of the Judge.
"With submission, my lord, the evidence of this man's hideous
treason is stronger by a deal than was the evidence upon which you
yesterday convicted a Bridgewater surgeon who had mended a rebel's
wounds."</p>

<p>"Do a man's antecedents count for naught?" Jeffreys stormed
back. "That rascally surgeon was widely known for an adventurer of
a turbulent ungodly kind, just such a man as is always to be found
ranged against authority. And it is as widely known that the
present accused has ever been a God-fearing, loyal subject of the
King."</p>

<p>"With submission, my lord, there is no evidence of that before
the court."</p>

<p>"No evidence? I wonder what you would consider evidence. Is
there not general knowledge of the fact? I have informed myself
that there are half a score of witnesses at hand who are ready so
to testify."</p>

<p>"Perhaps when we come to examine them..."</p>

<p>But Jeffreys would let him get no further. "I perceive no
occasion for it until something is proved&mdash;proved, Mr
Attorney, not merely alleged&mdash;against the accused. And since
you admit that all your witnesses are in the same case as that rash
presumptuous fellow we have heard, it is useless further to waste
our time. Get on, man. Proceed to your address." And he sat back,
closing his eyes once more.</p>

<p>In a rage and in defiance of his lordship, Mr Pollexfen strove
desperately so to prejudice and terrify the jury that no subsequent
direction should turn its members from their stern duty. He
stressed the inferences that were to be drawn from the fact that
Netley had been in hiding in Mohun's house. He insisted that here
was positive evidence of Mohun's treason, since only a traitor
would harbour a traitor. With ponderous vehemence he hammered this
into the minds of the jurymen.</p>

<p>"You are to remember that who comforts or succours in however
light a degree a man known to be in rebellion against his Sovereign
Lord the King is himself to be adjudged guilty of that same hideous
crime.</p>

<p>"No later than yesterday, in this very court, his lordship
reminded us that so, very properly and wisely, runs the law in
England. It were idle to pretend that this man Mohun did not know
that Netley had been in the fight at Sedgemoor on the side of the
traitor Monmouth. Why else must the King's men ransack the house
before Netley was discovered? If Mohun had not been fully conscious
of the traitor's guilt would he not at once have disclosed the
man's presence? To that there can be only one answer.</p>

<p>"The law is clear, and I have told you what it is. The
preservation of the government, the life of our Sovereign Lord the
King, the safety and honour of religion depend upon your verdict.
In considering it," he ended sternly, "I warn you against being
moved by pity, as Mohun may say that he was moved, into succouring
him as he has succoured another, lest in your turn you render
yourselves guilty of the odious crime for which, if you do your
duty, Godfrey Mohun must die."</p>

<p>Mr Pollexfen sat down abruptly, mopping the sweat from his
brow.</p>

<p>A shuffling sound ran through the court to be instantly stilled
again as Lord Jeffreys stirred and opened his eyes. Sombrely they
pondered the Attorney-General, and as sombrely the jury. He
coughed, dabbing his lips with his kerchief, then began to speak in
a thin voice that was charged with acid irony.</p>

<p>"You have listened to a very eloquent address from one of those
great advocates who are the glory of the English courts. You are
not come here, however, to be swayed and drugged by eloquence, but
to consider facts; and of facts Mr Attorney has been as sparing as
he has been prodigal of words."</p>

<p>Thus Jeffreys, who throughout that dread assize had been less a
judge than a bullying prosecutor, mercilessly intent upon hanging
all who came before him, began a speech for the defence as brazen
and hectoring as were usually his insistences upon conviction. The
jury must accept his denial that Mohun's awareness of Netley's
rebellion had been proved. There was, his lordship declared, no
proof upon which he would consent to hang his enemy's dog, much
less a gentleman so esteemed in the county and of such well-known
loyalty to his King. He not merely invited the jury to pronounce
the prisoner innocent, he seemed to threaten them with vague
ominous consequences if they did not. The jury shambled out, his
lordship retired, and the ruffled Mr Pollexfen was observed to be
very hotly in talk and extravagant of gesture with his colleague Mr
Mundy, from which his fury might be gauged.</p>

<p>After an absence of half-an-hour the jury returned, but not yet
to deliver a verdict. The foreman, pleading a doubt, demanded more
directions. The nature of the doubt was never known, for Jeffreys
lashed him so ferociously that he had not the temerity to utter
it.</p>

<p>"I cannot help your doubts," his lordship had interrupted, "or
know what would satisfy them. Lord God of Heaven! Have we not
wasted time enough? I tell you there never was a clearer case."</p>

<p>Mr Pollexfen's savage laugh was ignored by his lordship.</p>

<p>"You have had from me the clearest directions on the verdict you
should deliver according to the law of which it is for me to tell
you. In God's name, then, gentlemen, trouble me with no doubts or
hesitancy where none should be, but let me hear from you without
more delay."</p>

<p>Cowed, the twelve men spiritlessly filed out again, but for
little more than a moment's absence. When they returned they
delivered a verdict rare indeed in the course of that assize. "Not
Guilty."</p>

<p>Mr Godfrey Mohun departed a free man, and Mr Pollexfen, casting
prudence to the winds in his fury, widely declared that night that
Jeffreys must have been drunk so to have conducted the trial. He
also ventured the opinion that it would be likely to go hard with
the Lord Chief Justice if the matter should come to the ears of the
King.</p>

<p>Sir John, to whom the Attorney-General's words were reported,
accounted it his duty to report them in his turn to Lord Jeffreys.
But his lordship was not perturbed. The prospect of the remedy to
come made him tolerant of the Attorney-General's strictures.</p>

<p>In the matter of this remedy his patience was not tried. On the
following evening, when again he sat at table with Sir John Kirkby,
after a day which had ended the Taunton trials in the course of
which his lordship had passed upwards of a hundred and fifty
sentences of death, a messenger arrived at Kernstone. He brought a
letter and a box for Jeffreys.</p>

<p>With eager fingers my lord tore the lid from the box, then
paused before taking from it the only thing that it contained; a
slender rope some two yards long. Amazement excluded all other
emotions.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he croaked, then sought in the letter the
solution of the riddle.</p>

<p class="letter">My lord (he read),<br>
<br></p>

<p>True to my promise, I have procured and send you the remedy
which will afford you the swift and permanent relief of which I
assured you, not only from the stone, but from all other ills. It
is the Cannabis Pensilis of which I spoke, which in English may be
rendered as "hanging hemp". I send you a sufficient quantity for
application secundum artem, as the doctors say. Your lordship will
now perceive that on the subject of your regrettable disease I am
entirely in agreement with the Bridgewater surgeon whom two days
ago you sentenced to death upon such scanty grounds.</p>

<p>His handsome face distorted into a mask of evil, Jeffreys tossed
the letter across the table to his host.</p>

<p>"Read me that," he snarled. "Then let me hear from you, Sir
John. And as I've a soul to be saved, it shall go hard with you
unless you can satisfy me that you had no hand or part in it."</p>

<p>Sir John took up the letter with one hand whilst with the other
he waved the servant from the room. When he had read, he looked up,
and there was a bland smile on his ruddy, honest countenance. "A
poor latinist, I fear, our friend Mohun. It should, of course, have
been <i>Cannabis Carnificis:</i> hangman's hemp. But perhaps he
feared that that would prematurely have told your lordship too
much."</p>

<p>Standing at the table's foot, fingering the lace at his throat
as if it choked him, Jeffreys' eyes were terrible. "By God, sir, do
you join in this knave's gruesome mockery? A poor Latinist, you
say. The devil damn your smirking impudence! You and he shall both
have Latin enough before I've done with you, may I burn else. I'll
have that smug cheating villain back in gaol if I have to scour
England for him; and as I've a soul to be saved, I'll see him
hanged with this very halter."</p>

<p>"Shall you so? And upon what charge, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Charge?" His lordship's face was inflamed, a knot of veins
swelled at his temple. "Was he not taken harbouring a rebel?"</p>

<p>"But on that charge he was tried yesterday, and it is beyond
even your lordship's power to recall the verdict which you bullied
the jury into finding. By the law of England Godfrey Mohun may not
be tried again for that offence."</p>

<p>"You'll teach me law, will you? You shall find that I have law
enough to hang you with him as his accomplice in this heartless
fraud."</p>

<p>But the Deputy-Lieutenant remained unperturbed. His broad
countenance lost none of its high colour, or any of its blandness.
"To attempt it might be to find your own self charged with treason.
Best walk warily, my lord."</p>

<p>"Charged with treason?"</p>

<p>"Have you not committed it?"</p>

<p>"Committed it?" Froth gathered on his lips. "I?"</p>

<p>"Have you not succoured a man guilty of an act that at law makes
him a rebel? And does not that at law make you a rebel, too? Is not
the offence increased in your case by your abuse to that end of
your high office and of the trust reposed in you by a King whose
nature is not forgiving?"</p>

<p>Slowly the blood receded from my lord's face until it was of the
hue of lead. The vicious lines of his mouth&mdash;the flaw that
corrupted and belied the nobility of his countenance&mdash;became
more apparent. He attempted to express scorn in laughter, to summon
to his voice a minatory note. But he failed in both.</p>

<p>"Either you know too much law, sir, or too little."</p>

<p>"This is no question of law, my lord, but of fact. To a man
whose guilt was clear you sold an acquittal for personal ends."</p>

<p>"And if it were so? Who would dare to indict me?"</p>

<p>For once in his honest downright life Sir John was sly. "Does
your lordship not fear that as a loyal subject of the King, whose
commission I hold, that might be my duty? And if I were to bell the
cat, would there be a lack of those who would hunt it to the death?
Mr Pollexfen, for instance, a person of some weight and no little
vanity, would hardly forgo the chance to avenge the hectoring that
so diminished him yesterday in court. My lord, be advised by me in
friendliness. Do not seek to undo what you did yesterday for
Godfrey Mohun."</p>

<p>In a final fierce boiling up of rage Jeffreys brandished the
length of hempen rope. "And what this rascal has done for me? Is
that to be forgiven? Am I to be mocked as well as cheated?"</p>

<p>"If your lordship does not like the remedy that Godfrey Mohun
has sent you, that is the more reason why you should not risk its
being prescribed for you by an inclement master."</p>

<p>My lord must have reached the same conclusion; for no attempt
was ever made to upset the verdict in the case of Godfrey
Mohun.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. THE CONSTABLE OF CHARD</h2>

<p>THE Constable of Chard nursed a bitter sense of wrong.</p>

<p>For the official salary of ninety shillings a year no man, he
reflected, would be a constable. His real emoluments were the fees,
ranging from five shillings a head for rogues and vagabonds to ten
pounds for a highwayman, a housebreaker or a coiner. With these
were now rated the rank and file of the rebels who had gone into
hiding after Sedgemoor. Therefore the rising in the West should
have proved a rare windfall for the constables. Instead, however,
they were merely left the gleanings of a field that had been reaped
by the military. By the time that Colonel Kirke, who was discovered
to be selling pardons at from twenty to forty pounds apiece, was
recalled to London and put out of that very profitable business,
the round-up was all but complete. The gaols of the West were
crowded, and the Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys was setting out on his
famous assize.</p>

<p>Some odd rebels, however, still remained in hiding, and Tom
Hatherley, the Constable of Chard, set about doing the best he
could by excess of zeal and lack of scruples. He was shrewd enough
to perceive that to a government in a state of panic suspicion was
as good as evidence, and it is to be feared that he supplied the
too-ready gallows with more than one poor devil whose only offence
was that he held the Nonconformist views which had led so many to
follow the banner of the unfortunate Monmouth.</p>

<p>Still, it was hard work, and poorly paid, in the disgruntled
Constable's view. His thoughts turned longingly to those richer
prizes those odd missing leaders of the rebellion upon whose heads
special prices had been set; and one day at last he read a
proclamation on the walls of Taunton Gaol touching a fugitive
gentleman whom he had cause to suppose might well be hiding
somewhere within the restricted area of the Constable of Chard's
activities.</p>

<p>It bore the alluring heading, "One Hundred Pounds Reward", and
announced that this sum would be paid for the apprehension of the
notorious and wicked traitor Richard Foulkes of Wincham, known to
have been with the Duke of Monmouth in the Late Horrid
Rebellion.</p>

<p>Hatherley knew of the Honourable Richard Foulkes what all
Somerset knew. The eldest son of Lord Thorold, whose great estates
lay Wincham way, the county had scarcely seen him since he was a
lad, a circumstance which was to his advantage now that he was a
fugitive from justice. He had gone early to Court, as a page. There
he had attached himself to Monmouth; he had accompanied the Duke
abroad and had shared his exiled wanderings, and he was known to
have landed with him at Lyme Regis and to have been close in his
rebel councils.</p>

<p>Two other pieces of information were in the possession of Tom
Hatherley, to serve him now as pointers. Squire Brunton, of Moll
Park near Otterford, was a kinsman and close friend of Lord
Thorold; and Moll House, built in the time of Elizabeth,
notoriously contained a priest's hole that was said to have baffled
every search in the days of the religious persecutions.</p>

<p>It was the very place to be harbouring the wanted man since it
had been well established that he was not with his father. Not only
had Lord Thorold's house been ransacked from cellar to attic by
Kirke's men after Sedgemoor, but it had since been kept under the
closest surveillance. From asking himself whether it was not
probable that the young rebel, who had so completely disappeared,
had gone to ground in the priest's hole at Moll House, it was but a
step&mdash;guided by the hope of that dazzling reward&mdash;to a
settled conviction that this must be the case.</p>

<p>Hatherley went cautiously to work. So as to spy out the land, he
borrowed a couple of tything-men from a remote district and sent
them, in the guise of simple rustics seeking employment for the
apple-harvest, to see what they could discover from the servants at
Moll House. The result was not encouraging. The tything-men brought
him word that Moll House was almost destitute of servants. Squire
Brunton, reputed a fierce King's man and suspected of popery, had
shown himself so ruthlessly intolerant of all followers of the
Protestant Champion that he had driven away two men and a woman who
served him on no better grounds than a suspicion of their being in
sympathy with the cause of the rebel Duke. He was left only with
old Giles, his butler, a man born at Moll Park and of the Squire's
own age, Giles' wife who was his cook, and a rustic half-wit who
was serving as footman and from whom the tything-men had drawn this
discouraging information.</p>

<p>The Constable's disgust was profound. He had already known the
Squire for a hard-drinking, foul-mouthed, dissolute old scoundrel.
Now he condemned him for a curmudgeon who, having a safe
hiding-place in his house, had not the charity to shelter in it the
fugitive son of his friend and kinsman. He felt himself swindled of
a reward which he had been regarding already as good as in his
pocket. Upon further reflection, however, it occurred to him that
the Squire's fierce loyalty might well be a sham. The harsh
dismissal of his servants was not only a part of this comedy, it
could be a measure made necessary by his guilty secret: the timely
removal of witnesses who might betray him.</p>

<p>Having persuaded himself of this, and in the hope of discovering
confirmation of it, he set his men to watch the place, and three or
four days later one of them reported that a closely muffled man,
whom he had afterwards followed to Wincham and positively
recognized for Lord Thorold, had visited Moll House by night, and
had stayed there for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>That was enough for the Constable. There could no longer be any
doubt. If Lord Thorold went at such a time, and in secret guise, to
Moll Park, it could only be because his son was hiding there.</p>

<p>Hatherley took action.</p>

<p>He came to Moll House in the dusk of a September evening, thrust
aside the shock-headed footman who opened to his knock, and strode
masterfully into the hall. He sniffed at the broken-down air of the
place, now dimly seen by candlelight: the bare laths of the ceiling
where the plaster had fallen away, the rusty stand of arms in a
corner, the torn tapestry on one of the walls, and finally the
footman in his greasy, threadbare livery, with his matted, tousled
yellow hair, his smeared face vacant of all intelligence, who
seemed to have been made expressly to match this dilapidated
household.</p>

<p>His roared demand for Squire Brunton seemed to paralyse the
servant. The fellow gulped and stared. "Eh! Zquire be at zupper, he
be."</p>

<p>"Take me to him." Big, powerful and florid, of a countenance
that displeased by being commonly too pleasant, the Constable
towered over the scared zany.</p>

<p>"Begummers, I cood'n. I durs'n. Not whiles a's at zupper."</p>

<p>The Constable cuffed him aside, and strode on to a door from
beyond which he had heard the rattle of platters. He threw it open,
and across a tarnished candle-branch beheld the Squire at table, a
corpulent, untidy man of fifty, with a red face about which there
was a lot of loose skin. Deeply embedded in it twinkled a pair of
small eyes that showed little of the whites. They were normally
both kindly and shrewd, but they held little kindliness in that
moment of glaring, indignant surprise. He sat very much at his ease
before a round of beef, with a tankard at his elbow. His shabby
coat of mulberry velvet was undone, his neck-cloth was loosened,
and he had discarded his wig, so that his head looked like a vast
grey hedgehog.</p>

<p>"Give you good evening, Squire," the Constable greeted him.</p>

<p>"Do you?" The Squire choked. "What the plague do you want here?
And have I no servants to keep my door that any scurvy nodcock can
walk in on me whiles I'm at table? Burn your impudence!" He caught
sight of the footman beyond, and heaved himself up in a towering
rage. "And you, you noggerhead, for what do I house and feed
you?"</p>

<p>"A wudden lissen to I," the lackey bleated. "I tawld an..."</p>

<p>"Get out of my sight, both of you."</p>

<p>The servant obeyed in scared haste. But the Constable stood
firmly planted. "Easy now, Squire, easy!" he begged. "I do be come
on a matter that's mighty important. It touches my Lord Thorold's
son, Mr Richard Foulkes."</p>

<p>Squire Brunton stared at him blankly, his wrath apparently
diverted by astonishment. "Rot him for a rebel," he said at last,
"and rot you for an idiot! What have I to do with him?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm come to ask 'ee, Squire."</p>

<p>"Curse your impudence, then."</p>

<p>The Constable came a step nearer. He leered. His tone and manner
were of unpleasant cajolery. "I thought as your worship might save
trouble by telling me where he be."</p>

<p>"So that's what you thought? Ha! Damn you for a fool." Brunton
reached for his tankard, raised it, and for the time it took him to
drain the vessel his face was lost in it. He set it down with a
bang. "Didn't you hear me? I said damn you for a fool. And that's
all I have to say to you." He raised his voice. "Nat! Hi! Nat!
Where the plague is that flea-bitten rascal of mine? Nat!" The
footman came sidling into the room. "The Constable's leaving, Nat.
See him to the door."</p>

<p>But Hatherley wagged his head. "Na, na, Squire. Not yet. I be
acting on information, I be. There's more known than ye'ld maybe
think, and I has got to ask you when you last did see Mr
Foulkes."</p>

<p>"Don't know as I'ld know him if I saw him," the Squire growled.
Then he considered. "I saw him as a lad of thirteen or fourteen,
before he went to Court. He'll have changed a lot by now."</p>

<p>"Oh, ay, ay! And what was my Lord Thorold doing here two nights
since?"</p>

<p>He watched the Squire keenly for the effect of that bombshell,
as he conceived it. But the Squire only sneered at him.</p>

<p>"Spying on me, are you? Much may it profit you, you dirty
catchpoll. But since you ask me, I'll tell you. He made the mistake
you are making. He supposed&mdash;rot his impudence!&mdash;that I'm
a man to harbour rebels."</p>

<p>"Meaning as how he asked you to hide this son of his, and you
refused." He leered again. "Your worship could easily persuade me
that."</p>

<p>"Burn me, I'll refuse you nothing that'll rid me of you."</p>

<p>"Then just let me be taking a peep into that priest's hole o'
yourn."</p>

<p>"Priest's hole?" Hatherley's watchful eyes seemed to detect a
flicker in the Squire's little eyes. "What cock-and-bull tales have
you been listening to, numskull?"</p>

<p>"It's no cock-and-bull tale that ye've a priest's hole at Moll
House. All the county knows it."</p>

<p>"Be damned to what the county knows. And to you."</p>

<p>"Squire, Squire!" The tone was wheedling. "Ye wouldn't ha' me
fetch the Sheriff to search the house?"</p>

<p>"Fetch the devil."</p>

<p>"Ye'll know that harbouring rebels is a hanging matter. Ecod! If
the Sheriff finds Richard Foulkes here ye're a lost man, Squire.
But if you'll deliver him up to me none need ever know where I took
him. For I wouldn't tell. It's a great chance I be offering you
Squire."</p>

<p>"I'm obliged. And I'm sorry that I have no rebels for you. So
good night to you, Constable, and be damned."</p>

<p>Hatherley became more truculent. "Ye'll not get rid of me so.
I'll not leave this house till I've looked into that priest's
hole."</p>

<p>The veins rose in a knot on the Squire's forehead. Violence
seemed imminent. Yet all the explosion of it that came lay in
snatching up his napkin and flinging it viciously among the
dishes.</p>

<p>"Come along, then," he said. "Nat, take up that candlestick and
light us up the stairs."</p>

<p>The servant leading with the candle-branch, Squire Brunton
shuffling after him on slippered feet, and the Constable treading
firmly in the rear, they went processionally across the hall and up
the stairs. Midway up the first flight the Squire stopped. "Hold
the light, fool," he growled. He set a foot upon the oak skirting,
and at the same time threw his weight against the wainscot. The
pressure of his foot had evidently raised a latch, for to the
weight of his body a narrow door, so contrived in the panelling
that it ran to the summit of it, swung inwards.</p>

<p>At his master's harsh bidding, the servant advanced the light,
and a chamber was revealed, some six feet square, furnished only
with a table and a stool. The Squire stood aside to wave the
Constable in. "Satisfy yourself, rot you."</p>

<p>From the threshold Hatherley stared chapfallen into that dim
emptiness. Behind him the Squire continued to jeer. "Satisfy
yourself," he said again. "Get inside, and make quite sure, damn
you."</p>

<p>A sudden vigorous kick on his hindquarters propelled the
Constable forward, to sprawl upon the dusty floor.</p>

<p>He was followed by an unpleasant laugh, the soft thud and click
of the closing door, and utter darkness enveloped him.</p>

<p>He heaved himself up, and in a precipitate leap towards the spot
where he knew the door to be, he fell over the stool, bumped his
head against the wall, and came heavily to the ground again. He sat
up, roaring curses, threats, and finally terrified intercessions.
His voice boomed back at him, whilst no faintest sound reached him
from outside. Soon he was in a cold sweat of horror at the thought
that he might be left here to perish and rot. Already in that
impenetrable, close-smelling, musty blackness he had the sense of
being entombed.</p>

<p>Deliverance from so dread a prison, on the following morning,
should have earned his thankfulness. But when the Squire let him
out, thankfulness was the last emotion of which Hatherley was
capable. Rage submerged even his relief, and was in turn bridled
only by the fear with which a taste of the Squire's ruthlessness
had inspired him.</p>

<p>"Ye'll have had time to satisfy yourself that there's no one hid
there," was the mockery that greeted his crawling forth. "Maybe
ye'll ha' learnt at the same time that I'm not a safe man to be
plagued by officious catchpolls. Ye'd better look for your cursed
rebels in likelier places. If ye weren't a noggerhead ye'd know
that I'm the last man in Somerset to risk my neck for any damned
traitor."</p>

<p>The emptiness of the priest's hole had shattered all the
Constable's assumptions, and a natural conviction that only a
guiltless man would have dared proceed with such high-handed
ruthlessness was the cruellest of his torments. It left him without
hope of avenging his maltreatment, and robbed him of all prospect
of that hundred pounds upon which he had so confidently
counted.</p>

<p>The desire for vengeance, however, abode. That, and the baffled
covetousness in which he took his hang-dog departure from Moll
Park, stirred his wits to fresh activity. He recalled two
assertions of Brunton's which he had not believed last night, but
which now he no longer doubted: the first was that the Squire had
not seen Richard Foulkes since he was a lad of thirteen or
fourteen; the second, that he would not know him if he saw him.
Gradually they showed him how the Squire might be made to pay for
the cruel indignity he had inflicted. If the sheer rascality of the
notion gave Hatherley pause at first, he was presently strengthened
in it by the perception that it offered him an easy way to the gold
that seemed to him to have melted in his grasp.</p>

<p>On an afternoon some three days later, Squire Brunton was
awakened from his after-dinner slumber in the library by a
persistent tapping at the window. He roused himself in annoyance,
removed the bandana from his head and countenance, and glared in
the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>Against the window-pane was pressed a young face under a
slouched hat.</p>

<p>The Squire struggled out of his chair, went puffing and grunting
to open the lattice, and abusively to inquire who the fellow might
be and what the devil he sought.</p>

<p>"I am sent to you by my father," the stranger panted. A slight,
fair lad of any age between twenty-five and thirty, he was out of
breath, and his air blent timidity with mystery. His thin-nosed,
pointed face was alert and keen, his blue eyes of an engaging
candour. He wore his own hair, which was long and thick, and his
modest sad-coloured garments showed pretensions to gentility. "I
got away last night," he explained. "I've been hid since dawn in
the coppice yonder by the river." He set a hand on the low sill.
"By your leave, sir," he begged, and with nimble alacrity had
vaulted into the room before the Squire, in his amazement, could
raise a hand to stay him. "Father," he announced, "was sure you'ld
never have the heart to refuse me."</p>

<p>The Squire's eyes protruded from an inflamed countenance.
"Father was sure of it, was he?" he growled. "Ecod! Father's easily
assured. And who the plague may Father be? Who the plague are
you?"</p>

<p>The stranger pulled the window to, but in his haste didn't stay
to latch it.</p>

<p>"Come away, sir. Come away. We might be seen."</p>

<p>Amazement still leaving the Squire in a sort of numbness, he
suffered himself to be drawn by the sleeve across the chamber to
the shadows by the empty hearth. There he found his voice again.
"Will you answer me, burn you? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible ye don't remember me, sir? I'm Dick."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're Dick!" The Squire displayed sarcasm. "Everything is
now explained, Dick, saving only why I shouldn't kick you back
through the window. And it's what'll happen, Dick; unless you can
show some good reason against it."</p>

<p>"Lord! Ye don't know me yet!" The lad seemed distressed. "I'm
Dick Foulkes."</p>

<p>"What's that?" The Squire advanced upon him with a brow of
thunder. "You..." He checked abruptly. His jaw had fallen, and his
shrewd little eyes had almost disappeared. In wrath or stupor his
colour was more apoplectic than ever. By a gesture that seemed
spasmodic he reached for a hunting-crop that hung above the
overmantel. But his hand fell away empty again. Slowly he recovered
his normal poise. "And you've the damned impudence to come here in
spite of what I told his lordship! Didn't I make it plain enough
that I'ld harbour no cursed rebel in this house?"</p>

<p>The fair young face was overcast with dejection. The candid eyes
were filled with entreaty. "But my case grows desperate, sir. The
hunt is closing in upon me. And there's your old friendship with my
father. He made sure you'ld help me because of that; that ye
wouldn't turn me away if I came to you. There's the priest's hole.
He thought I could lie snug there until the hue-and-cry dies down,
and none the wiser. It would cost you naught, sir, and it would
save my life."</p>

<p>The Squire had let him run on, watching him closely the while
from under beetling brows. He grinned now, as the intercession
ceased.</p>

<p>"I wonder ye should suppose me concerned to save your plaguy
life."</p>

<p>"Ye wouldn't ha' my death on your conscience!"</p>

<p>"I shan't." The Squire chose to be brutal. "Your death's no
business o' mine; nor your life neither. Ye may be Dick Foulkes as
you say. But that's no reason why I should commit treason."</p>

<p>"My father's great love for you..."</p>

<p>"Has cost me a mort o' good money, let me tell you. I've no mind
to add my neck to what he owes me. So be off, out of here, my lad:
and be thankful I don't have you laid by the heels as my duty
is."</p>

<p>The young man's hands were held out in supplication. "Surely,
sir, you'll never be so hard! You'll never..." He broke off. Panic
invaded the eyes that were looking past the Squire, towards the
window. A groan escaped him. "Oh, my God! Too late."</p>

<p>The Squire looked over his shoulder. The unlatched lattice had
been softly pushed open, and above the sill appeared the bulky bust
of Tom Hatherley, his arms leaning upon it, and in one of his hands
a heavy horse-pistol.</p>

<p>He was grinning maliciously. "Good day to you, Squire. And good
day to you, Mr Richard Foulkes. I knew that patience would be
rewarded. And&mdash;ecod!&mdash;I've caught you red-handed, as ye
might say." On that he climbed into the room.</p>

<p>"So that's the way of it, is it?" said the Squire, and he
laughed.</p>

<p>"That's the way of it," the Constable agreed. He came forward, a
massive, towering man. "You'll not bubble me this time,
Squire."</p>

<p>"'Od rot your soul! I'm not thinking of it. There's your man.
Take him, and be damned to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, ay, to be sure I'll take him." The pistol was freely
displayed to the shrinking fugitive. "But there's yourself,
Squire." He shook his head gravely. "An ugly business for you."</p>

<p>"For me?" Momentarily the Squire appeared taken aback.</p>

<p>"Harbouring a rebel," Hatherley explained. "A hanging matter, no
less, in these days. Ye'll not suppose as I bears malice for what
happened t'other night. Far from it. I'ld let the gentleman go an'
I could, only so as not to bring trouble on yourself. The Lord
knows it's no pleasure to me to be sending poor devils to the
gallows."</p>

<p>"Then why the devil do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Why? What else is a poor man to do? He's worth a hundred pounds
to me, is Mr Foulkes."</p>

<p>"Is that all you think of?"</p>

<p>"Well, now...Ye see, I've a wife and four children and I can't
afford to be lordly. Ye'ld surely not blame me?"</p>

<p>The fugitive interposed. "D'ye mean if you had a hundred pounds
you'ld be willing to...ah...not to recognize me? Is that what you
mean?"</p>

<p>The Constable's air became embarrassed. He coughed. He laughed
sheepishly. "Faith, now, if you'ld make it worth my while like
that, I'ld be real glad, I would, not to march you off to Taunton
Gaol."</p>

<p>The young man swung passionately to the Squire. "You hear that,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I hear," said the Squire dryly. Planted squarely on his
hearth, he was, indeed, all attention, looking from one to the
other of them.</p>

<p>"Then you'll buy me off? You'll lend me the money? My father
will make it good."</p>

<p>"Will he? My lad, I've told you already, your father's that deep
in my debt I lie awake o' nights thinking of it."</p>

<p>"But it's yourself I'm thinking of," the lad protested.</p>

<p>"That's cursed kind of you."</p>

<p>"Don't you be taking it lightly, Squire," the Constable boomed
in. "If I arrests Mr Foulkes, I'm bound to declare where and when
he was took, and that'll mean a warrant for you, Squire."</p>

<p>"And for a hundred pounds, you'll go your ways in peace, will
you?" the Squire asked.</p>

<p>There was an oily smile on the Constable's face. "For two
hundred, Squire. I wouldn't price your worship at less than Mr
Foulkes."</p>

<p>"Burn you for a rogue!" the Squire roared at him, and pulled the
bell-rope.</p>

<p>The Constable was startled. "What now?"</p>

<p>"I want witnesses to see me pay the money, you dirty thief, or I
may have you back here blackmailing me for more."</p>

<p>"Your worship!" The Constable was in an agitation. "Here's no
matter to be done afore witnesses. Codso, I'ld be putting my neck
in a noose."</p>

<p>"That's where it ought to be. D'ye think I'ld trust you, you
scape-gallows? You were so mighty close on the heels of your rebel
that you must ha' been following him. You must ha' seen him come in
by that window. But it don't suit you to believe the truth, which
is that he thrust himself in here unbidden."</p>

<p>"That's for the justices; not for me. All I know is as I caught
you here together. Let the justices say whether you was harbouring
him. And ye'll know what they'll say as well as I do."</p>

<p>The door was opened by the shock-headed Nat, the greasy lad who
had been a witness of the Constable's humiliation.</p>

<p>"Did a' ring, Zquire?"</p>

<p>"Did I ring, ninnywatch? Who else should ring? Fetch Giles, and
be lively, slug."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Zquire." The ninny vanished.</p>

<p>The Constable's agitation bordered on panic. "This bean't
reasonable, Squire. Such a thing can't be done at all unless it be
done secret."</p>

<p>"So that at your pleasure you may forget that it was done, and
come back to do it again. I know your scurvy kind."</p>

<p>"Look you, Squire." Haste to conclude before the summoned
witnesses arrived made the Constable desperate. "To keep it between
ourselves, pay me the hundred pounds for Mr Foulkes, and I'll not
trouble you any more."</p>

<p>The Squire laughed at him. "If a hundred pounds is all you want
now, there it is." He pointed to the desolate-looking Mr Foulkes.
"That's the price on his head, you say. Take him and go to the
devil."</p>

<p>"Sir, sir," whined Foulkes. "You can never mean that!"</p>

<p>"I can. I do."</p>

<p>The Constable was livid. "Be that your last word? I tell you,
it'll mean a warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>"So you said before."</p>

<p>"But you don't believe me?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Here's Giles."</p>

<p>Old Giles shambled in, ushered by Nat. "God zave ee, zurs," he
greeted them, and remained with his fellow-servant by the door
awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Quizzically defiant, the Squire looked at the Constable. "Well,
Hatherley? What's your choice?"</p>

<p>The Constable shook with rage. "Thought to take me in another
trap, eh? Same as t'other night. Bribe me afore witnesses, and then
swear an information 'gainst me. Mighty cunning, Squire. But not
cunning enough for Tom Hatherley. Maybe ye'll be sorry when they
come for you." He swung, snarling, to the dejected rebel. "Come on
with you, Mr Foulkes. We'll be going."</p>

<p>The servants stared with startled eyes. Nat seemed to awaken
momentarily out of his somnambulism. "Begummery!" he ejaculated,
"that bean't never Mr Foulkes?"</p>

<p>The Constable thrust him roughly aside. "Out o' my way, zany."
He went out, driving his prisoner before him, and at a sign from
the Squire, Giles followed, to speed him from the house.</p>

<p>Nathaniel remained. But it was a transmogrified Nathaniel. The
vacancy was gone from his eyes, the leer from his face. He seemed
in an instant to have gained full and intelligent consciousness as
he looked across at the Squire.</p>

<p>"Does the fool believe that that's Dick Foulkes?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Squire grinned. "No more than he believes that you are. An
impudent swindle that's misfired. Likely he thought to get level
with me that way. But, rot him, I'll turn the tables on him. I'll
break the thieving hound." He made his way to the desk. "I'll send
a letter to the Sheriff to let him know that Richard Foulkes was
taken here today by the Constable of Chard, just as he had come to
ask me for shelter. That's something this rascally Constable won't
be expecting. He may sweat himself to death in explaining to the
Sheriff what he's done with his prisoner. And he'll find himself in
gaol as sure as my name's Harry Brunton and yours is..."</p>

<p>"Hush," said the lackey, a hand familiarly on his master's
shoulder. And added: "Aren't you playing with fire?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I am. But it's others who'll be burnt." His eyes
twinkled. "Trust me, Dick. You were all set on going to earth in
the priest's hole. Where would you be now if I'd consented, with
all the county knowing about it? I told you then, my lad, and I
tell you again, if you want to hide a thing so as it won't be
found, never thrust it into lurking-holes where folk are sure to
look for it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. THE CATCHPOLL</h2>

<p>THE case of Beau Witherington, by which is meant his notorious
adventure with Captain Evans, aroused at the time a deal of mirth
in idle, fashionable circles. But then the laughter of those who
avoid failure by attempting nothing is easily excited, and as idle
as their wits. After all, it may reasonably be contended that Mr
Witherington deserved praise rather than derision. It is at least
commendable in him that, at so early an age, and despite his
success in the world of fashion, he should have wearied of its
vapid entertainment, aspiring to more profitable activities than
could be found in rout and masque, at Almack's, Ranelagh and the
Ring. Forsaking the haunts he had adorned as a pattern of the
elegancies, he took coach for the country in a laudable spirit of
knight-errantry, seeking adventure. He had not long to wait for the
gratification of his quest, but the adventure that he found was
hardly of the romantic and heroic quality of his dreams.</p>

<p>On the dusty highway that skirts the Vale of Itchen, in the
pleasant county of Hampshire, the progress of his chaise was stayed
on an afternoon of Spring by the most engaging and acquisitive
horseman that it had ever been Mr Witherington's fortune to
encounter.</p>

<p>The beau had dined very heartily at <i>The Angler's Rest</i> at
Alresford. A surfeit of trout and white Burgundy, combining with
the warmth of the afternoon, had induced in him a soporific
condition from which he was harshly aroused by the jarring
suddenness with which the chaise, obeying an imperious order to
halt, was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>A horseman drew alongside. He was well mounted on a tall roan
with a white blaze, and, saving the square of black crêpe that
covered his face, no appearance could have been more demure than
his. The sober black of his garments, the plain white neck-cloth,
the grizzle tie-wig and the little three-cornered hat lent him an
almost clerical gravity. Gravely courteous, too, was the tone in
which he invited our gentleman to surrender his purse, his rings,
his watch, the diamond clasp that flashed on his solitaire, and
such other elegant trifles as go to the make-up of a man of
fashion.</p>

<p>Now, as you may already have gathered and as will further
appear, whatever else Mr Witherington might or might not be, he was
certainly a man of spirit. Deliberately he laid aside the book over
which he had been dozing. It happened to be a copy of the <i>Odes
of Horace</i>, although you are free to conclude that <i>The Gull's
Hornbook</i> would have been in better case to serve his needs. He
laid aside his Horace, then, and snatched up a brace of barkers
which he carried within reach against just such an emergency. Thus
armed he boldly faced the situation.</p>

<p>A resolute fellow, caring nothing for half-measures, and
determined to handle the matter with finality, he incontinently
discharged first one pistol and then the other point-blank at the
tobyman's breast. He had every reason to account himself something
of a marksman; but even had this not been the case, even had he now
handled a pistol for the first time, it must have been impossible
to miss so fair a mark at a range of no more than an arm's length.
Yet, having discharged his pistols, he was astounded to discover
that the horseman had not so much as flinched under that close
fire. Unmoved, and apparently unconcerned, he continued to sit his
nag, with a steadying hand upon the reins.</p>

<p>Whilst Mr Witherington stared, mystified and chapfallen, the
gentleman of the toby urged his mare forward and sideways by a pace
or two, so that he was brought within touch of the chaise. He
addressed the beau in a pleasant, affable voice, and with an accent
that was by no means that of the underworld.</p>

<p>"Now that you've burnt your powder, vented your heat, as it
were, perhaps we may come to business." And he put out his hat,
"For all the world," Mr Witherington afterwards related, "as if he
were putting forth the plate in church." He may have been helped to
the comparison by the rascal's quasi-clerical garb.</p>

<p>The rage blazing in Mr Witherington's stare was met by a soft
laugh.</p>

<p>"Come, come, sir. Let your good sense be at the level of your
courage, and superior to your marksmanship. Do not put me to the
coarse necessity of using threats, of drawing a barker in my turn.
It would distress me to use violence with a gentleman of such
elegant parts as Mr Witherington."</p>

<p>"You know me, do you, you rascal!" cried the furious man of
fashion.</p>

<p>But if this had brought him fresh surprise it also brought him
illumination. Not believing in miracles, his wits, which were by no
means sluggish, had been probing for an explanation of the
highwayman's seemingly miraculous imperviousness to bullets. It was
now supplied him. In the boot of the chaise there was a portmantle
on which Mr Witherington's name was stamped, and the chaise had
stood in the yard of <i>The Angler's Rest</i> whilst Mr
Witherington was dining.</p>

<p>It was enough. Mr Witherington registered a vow that when
alighting at a country inn in future he would take his pistols with
him, instead of leaving them in the chaise where any passing rogue
might tamper with the charges.</p>

<p>Meanwhile that detestably suave voice was answering him. "Not
know the famous Mr Witherington, that ornament of the beau monde!
La, sir! I protest it's an honour to be asking for your purse. If
you please, now." The hat was insistently agitated.</p>

<p>Mr Witherington's sullen glance surveyed the road ahead. From
its dusty emptiness he gathered that, his pistols having failed
him, the situation must be accepted lest worse should follow. With
rage in his heart he delivered up his valuables.</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure to do business with you," the horseman
commended. "And, faith, I couldn't suffer the meeting to cause you
inconvenience. So here's five guineas for your more pressing needs.
I'll be wishing you a very good day, in the hope that we may meet
again when your purse is as well furnished."</p>

<p>"Stab my vitals!" snarled the beau. "It'll be a cursed sorry day
for you if ever we do meet again."</p>

<p>A laugh was his answer from behind that black mask. Then the
tobyman wheeled his horse, and, with a flourishing lift of his hat
in farewell, he was off at a canter, leaving the depleted Mr
Witherington free to continue his journey.</p>

<p>The post-boy, who had dismounted, came to the window of the
chaise. There was an oafish grin on his lumpy countenance, so
little did he realize the ferment of anger in our gentleman's soul,
the lacerated pride of the adventure-seeker who has met adventure
only to be undone by it.</p>

<p>"That be Cap'n Evans, for sure, that be. A rare 'un he be."</p>

<p>"Be he?" growled the beau, in savage mimicry. "Not rare enough.
He'll be a friend of yours, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"A friend! Lawks, sir! It's the third time this half-year I be
held up hereabouts by he."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Mr Witherington. "D'ye tell me he's been
working this road for a half-year?"</p>

<p>"Aye, I do so. And mighty hard he works it. But he be a rare
'un. Always merry."</p>

<p>"Cursed merry." Mr Witherington looked with loathing at the
leering oaf. "Is there no plaguy Sheriff in this poxy county?"</p>

<p>"To be sure there be. Sir James Blount be High Sheriff."</p>

<p>"So! And where does this cursed High Sheriff live, if so be that
he's alive at all?"</p>

<p>"Over to Compton Mallet, t'other side o' Winchester."</p>

<p>"Take me there," said the beau, on a sudden impulse. In the
Sheriff he had suddenly perceived his most urgent need; someone
upon whom to vent the fury of humiliation that was choking him.
"Get on!" he exploded, and so drove the position back to the saddle
and his duty.</p>

<p>An hour later they were rattling downhill into Winchester, which
the disgruntled man of fashion cursed for a town at the bottom of a
well. They climbed out of it again on the other side and, as the
shadows were lengthening, came to Sir James Blount's untidy
parklands of Compton Mallet.</p>

<p>The four-square, red-brick, sash-windowed mansion proved as
ill-kempt within as without. Admitted by a lean, elderly,
knock-kneed servant in a greasy livery, with tattered wristbands
and dirty, slack white stockings, Mr Witherington was ushered into
the presence of the Sheriff. He found a shaggy, loose-limbed man,
gaitered in leather to the thighs, wearing a coat of faded red and
carrying a peck of snuff on his neck-cloth. In the fastidious eyes
of his angry visitor, Sir James was in harmony with his setting. No
wonder the roads in his care were infested by robbers. The fellow's
mind, Mr Witherington supposed, would be as slovenly as his person
and his dwelling. His manners, however, left no cause for
complaint. He welcomed with affability Mr Witherington's radiant
splendours of gold-laced, blue velvet coat and flaxen wig, and
conducted him to the gun-room, which announced itself for his main
abiding-place. It was a room of a certain fusty cosiness, smelling
of leather, gun-oil, dust and stale tobacco. In Mr Witherington's
view, a disgusting room in which to entertain a gentleman. Some
antlered skulls adorned the dark wainscot, serving as racks for
such objects as dog-collars, whips, powder-horns and the like; the
moth-eaten masks of a couple of foxes snarled from the overmantel;
a brass lantern-clock ticked on a corner bracket.</p>

<p>Sir James, rejoicing in the entertainment of a visitor from the
great world, thrust him into the best chair, a roomy machine of
leather, faded, rubbed and greasy, called for a jug of October and
a couple of pipes, and required to know in what he could be of
service. The beau, having disdainfully refused both tankard and
tobacco, told his tale with such calm as his simmering wrath
permitted.</p>

<p>The Sheriff's jovial surface was scarcely ruffled. "Looked like
a parson, and rode a roan mare with a white blaze, eh? Faith, it
would be that damned Welshman, Tom Evans. Captain Evans, they call
him."</p>

<p>"So the post-boy said. And he tells me the blackguard has been
infesting your roads for the past half-year."</p>

<p>"Every day of it," the Sheriff agreed heartily and shamelessly.
"Ever since he made Shropshire too hot for his hoofs."</p>

<p>"Ah! I take it that he finds no such troublesome heat in
Hampshire. I found him cool enough today."</p>

<p>Sir James suspected no sarcasm. "Cool!" he almost chortled. "An
old maid for coolness. Slippery as an eel and wily as a fox. That's
Tom Evans. And a man of parts, as I gather. They say he was brought
up to be an attorney, but, seemingly, he prefers to find his profit
outside the law."</p>

<p>Standing with wide-planted feet, his broad shoulders to the
over-mantel, the burly Sheriff laughed boisterously at his own
jest. Mr Witherington considered him with horror. His sarcasm
deepened.</p>

<p>"My post-boy thought him amusing. He described him as a rare 'un
I gather you're much of the same mind."</p>

<p>"Impossible to be of any other," Sir James agreed. "Lord, sir!
The rascal may be a thorn in my flesh, but that don't keep me from
laughing at his waggishness."</p>

<p>"I see. A thorn that merely tickles," said Mr Witherington,
striving with his disgust.</p>

<p>Still unconscious of his guest's acidity, Sir James became
engrossed in contemplation of the waggishness of Captain Evans.</p>

<p>"Ye'll not have heard tell of the end of him in Shropshire. Stab
me! It would make an undertaker laugh. He was actually in the
custody of the Sheriff's officers, and they were taking him to
Shrewsbury with his feet tied under his horse's belly. He was as
unconcerned as you please, easy and jocular with his captors, and
keeping them in laughter with his quips and his sallies, till they
must ha' thought it a shame to take so jolly a rascal to be
hanged.</p>

<p>"They were coming along a country lane when they put up a fine
cock pheasant that was feeding on acorns. The bird flew up into the
oak and perched there. The Captain fetches a sigh and cocks a
melancholy eye at it.</p>

<p>"'I mind me the time I used to go a-fowling,' says he,
maudlin-like. 'And there was never a better shot than me in
England. I don't recall ever missing a bird.' Then he sighs again.
'Pity to let that one bide,' says he, 'a fine plump fowl like that.
It would make a savoury supper for a poor man.'</p>

<p>"Now this set the fool of a constable a-watering at the mouth,
as our rascal reckoned it would. 'D'ye think ye could bring it
down?' says he.</p>

<p>"'Blindfolded,' says the Captain, drawing rein and holding out
his hand. 'Here! Lend me your piece.'</p>

<p>"He had so won upon them by his easy ways, and his manner now
was so natural and casual, that the fool fell into the trap. 'About
it, then,' says he, and hands me his fowling-piece to the Captain.
And what think you, sir, the rascal did?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in human folly could surprise me," said Mr
Witherington.</p>

<p>"He clapped the muzzle to the constable's belly, and swore to
blow his insides out unless his men at once threw down their
weapons. He was so fierce and resolute that they durstn't deny him.
Next he ordered them to cut his bonds. Then he took a brace of
pistols, and the best horse in the company, wished them a very good
day, and rode off to come and plague us here in Hampshire."</p>

<p>His boisterous laugh almost made the windows rattle. But Mr
Witherington did not join in it. He waited until the explosion had
subsided. Then: "And here in Hampshire," he said, "he roams at
large to rob the quality to his heart's content without
interference. Stab my vitals! I can understand it since you regard
him with such amusement. I take it the blackguard has won your
affection?"</p>

<p>"Affection!" Sir James sobered. At last he began to perceive the
beau's humour. "Gadsmylife! D'ye jest, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't. I'm not in the mood. I've been robbed of a purse of
twenty guineas and some odds and ends worth twice as much. That's
not the kind of jest I relish, though it may amuse your
worship."</p>

<p>The blood darkened in Sir James' pendulous cheeks. Yet he
preserved a commendable tolerance under provocation. "La, now,
ye're sore, and I don't wonder. But ye're not to suppose that I'm
careless of my office. I'll have the dog by the heels yet, I
promise you. The devil of it is that he bribes every waiter and
drawer and ostler between Guildford and Portsmouth. They're all in
league with him."</p>

<p>"That I can well believe," said Mr Witherington, remembering
what had happened to his pistols. "A pretty state of things, as I
live. And nothing done about it."</p>

<p>This time the Sheriff's forbearance cracked under the strain.
"Nothing done? What the devil do you mean, sir? That's no way to
speak to me. I'm the Sheriff of this county."</p>

<p>"That's what I complain of. It was my suspicion that the county
had no Sheriff and no posse comitatus. Half a year this scoundrel
has been at his robberies on the roads in your charge. Half a year!
Sink me, it's a scandal. A damned scandal, sir."</p>

<p>His countenance purple, Sir James strove with his wrath. "That's
what you came to tell me, is it?" he rumbled as a beginning, and
squared himself to amplify it.</p>

<p>"Before putting the matter to my friend Lord Carteret," the beau
explained. This timely mention of the Secretary of State saved Mr
Witherington from a major explosion, but did not avert a minor
one.</p>

<p>"Lord Carteret! By God, sir, you're mighty glib. What, pray, do
you suppose Lord Carteret could do?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what any man of sense and authority would have done
long since. See that you clear your roads of this pest."</p>

<p>"Sense and authority!" echoed the indignant Sheriff. "I'll make
bold to ask you, sir, in which it is that you find me lacking. But,
faith, you need not answer. For, since I possess the authority, you
must account me to lack sense. Damme! I'm much obliged to you.
You'll have gathered a great notion of your worth from crowing on
your own little dunghill of Ranelagh or Vauxhall. You should be
Sheriff of Hampshire for a month. It might teach you humility."</p>

<p>"Yet you don't appear to have learnt it," was the retort.
"Gadslife, sir, in your place I'ld clear the highways of this
gadfly in a week."</p>

<p>The assertion, lightly and recklessly made, as assertions are
made in the heat of acrimonious argument, provoked the obvious,
angry rejoinder. "A safe boast, sir, since it isn't likely to be
tested. Or is it? Would you care, now, to exhibit your talents and
lay bare my infirmities? Faith, you have my leave to attempt it,
and all the county will be in your debt if you succeed."</p>

<p>Mr Witherington's stare was cold and scornful. "Gad, sir! What
next? I am no catchpoll."</p>

<p>The Sheriff gave him back scorn for scorn. "That's what I
expected you to say." And he ran on, gathering angry momentum as he
went.</p>

<p>"Ye're a very pretty fellow, Mr Witherington; but I wonder are
you anything besides. I mean to say, I've some acquaintance with
your kind, and it leaves me wondering if, in all your life, you've
done more than boast of what ye might do."</p>

<p>Our man of fashion flushed under the other's withering eye. "You
account me boastful?" said he, more in amazement than in anger.</p>

<p>"What else? You come hectoring me that my work is ill done, and
vowing that you could do it better. But you're careful to refuse
the challenge that would prove you. Bah, sir! I wonder at my
patience with you."</p>

<p>"A challenge, was it?" Mr Witherington became soberly
thoughtful. Suddenly he uttered a little laugh. "Why not? Why not?"
Again he laughed. "Sir, I came into the country seeking adventure
to enliven a dull life. I seem to have stumbled upon what I sought.
And, egad, I'll not lie under the imputation that I boast of more
than I can perform."</p>

<p>Sir James' annoyance was overlaid now by surprise. "Ye don't
mean ye're so rash as to turn thief-taker?"</p>

<p>"To prove myself, as you say. And to prove you at the same
time."</p>

<p>"What you're like to prove yourself is a laughing-stock."</p>

<p>This was merely a goad to Mr Witherington. "I'll take the risk
of that and more." He stood up suddenly. "Will you back your
confidence, Sir James? Will you take a wager of fifty guineas that
within ten days I'll bring you this tobyman bound neck and heel?
Will you take it?"</p>

<p>"It would serve you right if I did," growled the Sheriff.
"You've been robbed enough for one day. I'll not be adding to your
losses."</p>

<p>"Faith, sir, you're like the fox in the fable," said Mr
Witherington, and became so furiously insistent that in the end,
losing all patience, the Sheriff accepted the wager.</p>

<p>In doing so under that offensive provocation, he was not perhaps
quite honest. There was something that he did not tell the beau. He
did not disclose that the authorities, sharing Mr Witherington's
opinion of Sir James' supineness, had not merely sent him sharp
remonstrances; they had instructed him to proclaim a reward of a
hundred guineas for the apprehension of Captain Evans. Saying
nothing of this, he lent Mr Witherington twenty guineas for his
immediate needs, and sped him with an ironical blessing upon a
quest which Sir James regarded as preposterous.</p>

<p>On the very next morning, to complicate matters, a
riding-officer from Bow Street arrived at Compton Mallet. His name
was Baldock, and he enjoyed the repute of being the most astute and
enterprising thief-taker in the country. The government, in its
determination to make an end of Captain Evans, and in its despair
of the activities of Sir James Blount, was permitting Bow Street's
most efficient officer to set about earning the proclaimed
reward.</p>

<p>Sir James did not view the matter amiably. He perceived in it a
reflection upon his zeal, and found no consolation in the prospect
of winning fifty guineas. At the same time he accounted it no less
than his duty to acquaint Baldock with the fact that another was
ahead of him already upon the quest. When the riding-officer,
dismayed at first, learnt that his competitor was Beau
Witherington&mdash;well known to him by reputation, as he was,
indeed, to all the town&mdash;he was uproariously amused, and went
off with no faintest misgiving to cloud his prospective enjoyment
of the prize money.</p>

<p>A sturdy fellow of middle height, with the jaw of a mastiff and
the thews of an ox, Baldock was attended by a brace of scoundrels
who, under his suasion, had deserted the army of priggers to enlist
with the sleuths of Bow Street. The three of them sought the trail
with diligence and cunning. The inn folk might be friendly to
Captain Evans, but it was in Baldock's experience that such
friendships can be diluted. In every town and hamlet through which
he passed he set up a copy of the proclamation of the reward for
the highwayman's capture. To every ostler whom he questioned he
offered from ten to twenty guineas of the blood-money for
information that would enable him to earn it. He never doubted that
sooner or later he would find one whose affection for the Captain
would not survive such a temptation. And in the matter of Mr
Witherington he was not concerned to play fair. However slight his
fear of being forestalled by the man of fashion, he thought it
would do no harm to foul his chances. So from the outset he took
care to publish the story of the wager in every quarter whence
there was a chance of its being reported to Captain Evans. He
justified himself by the reasoning that to put the Captain on his
guard against Mr Witherington might serve to throw him off his
guard against Baldock himself.</p>

<p>Had Mr Witherington been aware of this, it might have damped the
enthusiasm and confidence with which, being committed to it, he was
embracing the novel office of catchpoll. Confidence to succeed in
whatever he took in hand was a commodity with which the beau was
abundantly supplied. He certainly did not lack for courage, and he
was practised in the use of arms. So that he counted his only
obstacle to success the difficulty of coming upon the Captain. In
order to discover him he employed all his resourcefulness.
Remembering the Sheriff's assertion that every drawer, waiter and
ostler, between Portsmouth and Guildford, was in the Captain's pay,
he sought amongst them, by tactics similar to Baldock's of artful
inquiry and lavish bribery, the necessary information; and although
he was careful to say no more than his needs demanded, yet
inevitably he must say a little more than might be prudent.</p>

<p>At the end of three days of this assiduity, all the information
that he had gathered was that a zealous riding-officer from Bow
Street was hot upon the highwayman's trail. This was an unexpected
and disquieting intervention until suddenly, on the fourth morning,
by a stroke of fortune, he was placed in possession of the very
news of the Captain that he sought.</p>

<p>It was brought to <i>The George</i> at Alton, where Mr
Witherington had lain the night, by a young gentleman whose dress
and air proclaimed the country squire. He stalked into the common
room of the inn, complaining furiously within the hearing of Mr
Witherington that he had been held up and robbed by a tobyman who
looked like a damned parson, and crying&mdash;as Mr Witherington
himself had cried&mdash;shame on Sir James Blount for keeping no
better order in the county.</p>

<p>"That would be Cap'n Evans for sure," said a sympathetic
landlord.</p>

<p>"Of course it was Captain Evans. Don't I know him? And don't the
whole county know him and that roan of his with the white blaze?
And it's not the first time that he's robbed me." He flung himself
into a chair, and called for a pint of claret laced with Nantes.
"For which," he added, "you'll have to give me credit; for the dog
has cleaned me out."</p>

<p>Mr Witherington took this for his cue. He had been scrutinizing
the newcomer. A well-knit lad, his attractive, open countenance
under his own copper-coloured hair, simply queued, invited
sympathy. In dress, from his fine riding-boots to his dove-coloured
coat with its black silk buttonholes, he was irreproachable. The
blue-and-gold elegance of Mr Witherington sauntered across to
him.</p>

<p>"Permit a fellow-sufferer to be your host on this occasion." He
waved the landlord away upon the execution of the order received,
and then, in answer to the stranger's hard, frowning stare, he
presented himself. "My name is Witherington; Geoffrey
Witherington."</p>

<p>The frown vanished. The fine dark eyes became alight. "Not Beau
Witherington?" the young man cried, rising, as if respect impelled
him.</p>

<p>Gratified, Mr Witherington made a leg. "Your humble, obedient,"
he declared. "Shall we sit?"</p>

<p>"I am honoured, sir. Deeply honoured. I am Sir John Vanbrugh of
Lettons, very much at your service."</p>

<p>They sat down to improve the acquaintance over the claret, and
in the course of the confidences exchanged between them, Mr
Witherington heard again of the coming of Baldock into
Hampshire.</p>

<p>"Not before he was needed, egad," swore Sir John. "For there's
no hope in Blount. The old dodderer sleeps at his post. Sleeps like
the dead, stab me. Gad! If I but had the luck to run into Baldock
now, I could show him how to make a quick end of this cursed
thief."</p>

<p>Mr Witherington's attention quickened. He begged Sir John to be
more explicit, to confide in him how the thing was to be
achieved.</p>

<p>Sir John obliged him. "Don't I know where Evans stays? In the
Staunton Thicket. He lurks there undercover, like a fox watching a
hen-roost. He bounced out of it today, just as he did when last he
robbed me, and he vanished into it again. I'll make oath he's there
at this moment, waiting for his next victim. And if I but knew
where to find this riding-officer, and could find him
quickly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may do better," Mr Witherington interruped, now quivering
with excitement. In a dozen words he told of the wager he had
laid.</p>

<p>"I've sworn to deliver him to the Sheriff tied neck and heel,
and you arrive in the very nick of time to save me from being
forestalled by this Bow Street fellow. If he's where you say, it
should be easy to draw him. Let us ride forth together past this
thicket, tempting Captain Evans to come and rob us. Between us, and
forewarned, we should easily make his capture. What say you?"</p>

<p>What Sir John said was not stimulating; he was so full of doubts
that Mr Witherington began to fear he wanted spirit. He argued that
seeing two able-bodied horsemen the Captain might hesitate to show
himself. These gentlemen of the road were cautious, craven dogs,
who became shy when they espied more than a single victim.</p>

<p>"Then we'll oblige him," said Mr Witherington with confidence.
"Put me on the road to this thicket, and then leave the rest to
me."</p>

<p>"You'll face him single-handed?" Sir John displayed
consternation. But the beau laughed with the careless confidence of
the knight-errant.</p>

<p>"As you please, since you're resolved," said Sir John. "I can
certainly put you on your way. I'll ride with you as far as
Tupper's Corner, which is no more than a stone's cast from Staunton
Thicket."</p>

<p>He yielded to Mr Witherington's impatience to set out at once,
lest even at this eleventh hour the Bow Street man should forestall
him. And, indeed, there was less time to lose than even his
eagerness imagined; for Baldock's artful diligence had just borne
fruit. Within two or three hours of Mr Witherington's meeting with
Sir John Vanbrugh, a stable-lad at Faringdon, dazzled by the
glitter of promised gold, was able to inform the thief-taker that
Captain Evans was reported to have robbed a gentleman that very
morning near Staunton Thicket, between Alton and Farnborough. To
this the lad added the opinion&mdash;evidently shared with Sir
John&mdash;that the thicket was a favourite lurking-place of the
Captain's, and that it was likely enough he might be found
there.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out that by noon of that same day Baldock and his
men were pounding along the road by which Mr Witherington and Sir
John had ridden a few hours earlier. They were approaching Tupper's
Corner when round it, at a trot, came a well-mounted gallant in a
gold-laced blue coat and a flaxen wig. Advancing towards them, the
resplendent figure drew rein, and held up a hand to stay them.</p>

<p>"Well met," was his greeting. "You'll be the Bow Street men sent
after Captain Evans?"</p>

<p>"Faith, sir, ye've shrewd eyes," said Baldock suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It has been remarked before. But there's little need for them
at present. You wear a sort of livery that's not to be mistook, and
it's known you were sent from London to mend the Sheriff's
shortcomings. My name is Witherington. Ye may ha' heard of me."</p>

<p>Such was the shock that it was a moment before Baldock found
breath to loose a great horse-laugh. "'Eard o' ye!" He choked in
his sudden mirth as he scanned the splendours of our frowning
gentleman. "'Eard&mdash;o' ye! Blood and 'ounds! You're him what
undertook to catch Tom Evans. Ha, ha! Ha, ha!" He held his sides,
and squirmed, convulsed, in the saddle.</p>

<p>His satellites, no less quick to perceive the humour of this
mincing dandy's presumption, abandoned themselves to a like
hilarity, whilst a limp mocking hand was flung out by Baldock to
feed the derision.</p>

<p>"And...and I suppose ye'll ha' taken him by now," spluttered the
catchpoll.</p>

<p>The gallant sat his horse, one hand on his hip, his head thrown
back, such a curl on his lip and so haughty a blaze in his eyes
that they were gradually brought to a sense of the deference due
from men of their station to a gentleman of his. When he had
reduced them by his stare to a sheepish silence, his lip curled
further.</p>

<p>"Stab my vitals!" said he. "Now that the thorns have ceased from
crackling under the pot, I'll inform you that, in effect, I have
taken Captain Evans."</p>

<p>"You...you've taken him?" gasped Baldock.</p>

<p>"Ready for delivery to Sir James, bound neck and heel as I
wagered. You see me on my way to Alton for a chaise." With cold
authority he added: "Since I've met you, I'll require you to lend a
hand." He touched his horse as he spoke, and, without waiting for
an answer, rode past them and on, leaving them to follow.</p>

<p>The three looked at one another in crestfallen awe, and then
obediently fell in behind him.</p>

<p>The tobyman, he was to tell them later, with immense
condescension, was bestowed in a cottage near the village of Foyle,
a cottage which had long served the scoundrel as an unsuspected
hiding-place. Later he was to tell them also, and with becoming
loftiness, that, being no professional catchpoll, he would scorn to
claim the reward. He did not soil his hands with blood-money. That
would be for Baldock and his men. Enough for him the satisfaction
of having been as good as his boast and the fifty guineas Sir James
had lost to him. It was an announcement that roused the
thief-takers from their dejection and changed reluctant into eager
obedience.</p>

<p>By a country lane that was no better than a cart track they came
in the early afternoon to that cottage within a mile or so of
Foyle, with the chaise trundling after them. Dismounting, the
thief-takers followed their leader round to the back, through a
little plot of neglected kitchen-garden. As they approached, the
neigh of a horse welcomed them from a wooden lean-to that stood
against the cottage wall.</p>

<p>Baldock checked at the sound, then stepped to the door and threw
it open. His indrawn breath was audible, and the men, peering over
his shoulder, beheld a tall, sleek roan mare with a white blaze.
"That be the nag!" he cried. "That be the nag, sure enough!"</p>

<p>"And now for the man himself," said our gentleman, as he
unlocked the cottage door.</p>

<p>It was a mere hovel, of two rooms below and a loft above, to
which there was access by a ladder. But they did not go beyond the
meanly furnished room upon which the door had been opened. In a
corner they beheld a bundle, which the beau dragged across the
uneven earthen floor into the light.</p>

<p>"There is your man."</p>

<p>Baldock stooped over a gentleman in black, trussed like a fowl,
and breathing stertorously. His grizzled wig was awry on a cropped
head, disclosing on the brow a lump as large as a pigeon's egg.
"Ecod!" muttered the thief-taker. "What ails him? Is he drunk?"</p>

<p>The beau laughed. "After a fashion. When he recovered from the
tap I gave him, he asked for a drink. It was only charity to let
him have a cup of his own ale, but I added something to it, so as
to keep him quiet. He'll give less trouble that way."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," Baldock agreed. "Here, my lads. Out with him."</p>

<p>As they bore the inert body to the chaise, the officer rubbed
his hands and grinned. "Faith, sir, as a catchpoll ye put me to
shame, so ye do."</p>

<p>Our fine gentleman stiffened. "You may spare me your praise,
sirrah. I don't aspire to the honour of belonging to your inept
profession."</p>

<p>Crestfallen, Baldock mounted, and they set out for Compton
Mallet, with the captive in the chaise. But, coming through Alton
again an hour or so later, our gentleman drew rein before <i>The
George.</i></p>

<p>"Ride you on," he commanded. "Tell Sir James I follow."</p>

<p>Baldock hesitated, turning a thirsty eye upon the inn. "Ecod,
sir, my lads, too, would be glad of a sup of ale."</p>

<p>The beau looked down his nose at him. "Have you no thought for
your duty? Aren't you aware that you have a prisoner? Get on, man.
Get on," was his merciless command. "And tell Sir James to have his
guineas ready. Though I'll be there as soon as you are."</p>

<p>Cowed by that peremptoriness, Baldock did not stay to argue.</p>

<p>"Damn the sour pimp," he grumbled to his lads, as they jogged
on. "Very high-and-mighty for a silly popinjay. All blown up with
pride because he's taken a tobyman, 'od rot him."</p>

<p>They found some passing comfort in a wayside ale-house farther
on. But in such subjection were they to the haughty Mr Witherington
that they dared not linger over their huckle-my-butt lest he should
discover them there. Mr Witherington, however, was evidently taking
a well-earned ease at <i>The George</i> at Alton, for he had still
not overtaken them when, as night was falling, they came to Compton
Mallet. Admitted by the faded butler, Baldock trod heavily in
self-assertiveness into the presence of Sir James, who sat at
supper.</p>

<p>"We've got the Captain, Sir James," he announced exultantly.</p>

<p>The Sheriff thrust back his chair, and rose from the candle-lit
table. "Got him, d'ye say?"</p>

<p>"All tied up and snug. My lads are carrying him in."</p>

<p>"That's brave. That's well done." Sir James was flushed with
satisfaction. "And you were ahead of that fool Witherington."</p>

<p>Baldock lost some of his assertiveness. "I'd not say that, Sir
James. Not quite. Ye see, Mr Witherington helped us to take
him."</p>

<p>"Helped you?"</p>

<p>Perforce Baldock must explain, since soon Mr Witherington would
be there to give his own account. The joviality faded out of Sir
James' countenance. Black annoyance replaced it when Baldock added:
"But the gentleman's behaving generous. He's leaving the reward to
us."</p>

<p>This had not been at all in the Sheriff's reckoning. He was
thinking not of the reward but of the wager which lost him fifty
guineas, besides leaving the laugh with Mr Witherington.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you think you deserve it." The Sheriff's tone was
bitter. "Oddslife! You boast yourself Bow Street's best catchpoll,
and you let yourself be outdone by the first popinjay that takes
your work in hand. I hope you're proud of yourself, Baldock."
Abruptly he added: "Where is this fellow?" And he strode out into
the hall, leaving the shamefaced Baldock to follow.</p>

<p>The captive, still trussed and still under the drug, lay in a
heap on the floor with Baldock's men standing over him. The Sheriff
stepped up to him, seized his shoulder, and shook him with angry
impatience.</p>

<p>"Still asleep is he?" He stopped, and thrust aside the grizzled
wig, which half covered the man's face. Then he caught his breath
and stooped still lower. He loosed first an oath and then a laugh,
straightened himself and turned upon Baldock, who stood behind
him.</p>

<p>"Is this Captain Evans, you dolt? Rat me! You've been finely
cozened."</p>

<p>"Co...cozened! cozened? By whom have I been tricked?"</p>

<p>"I'll suppose it would be by Captain Evans. For whom else would
be the gentleman who commanded your help?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, your honour. That's not possible. For if that was
Captain Evans, then who the plague is this?"</p>

<p>"This, you fool," said the Sheriff, "is Mr Witherington."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. LOADED DICE</h2>

<p>HIS lordship was peevish; that was his lordship's norm; but he
was more than usually peevish this afternoon. His lordship's
secretary and cousin was sardonic. That, too, was normal. Also, the
more peevish his lordship the more sardonic his secretary; and the
more sardonic the secretary the more peevish his lordship. Thus,
each reacting on the other, their relations were approaching the
intolerable.</p>

<p>They had dined reasonably well in this cosy, panelled room above
stairs in the <i>Red Fox Inn</i> at Farnborough, where they had
broken their journey. Now, the cloth removed, a decanter of port
stood on the round, polished mahogany table, glowing like a
gigantic ruby in the light of a fire that burned clear and
frostily. The decanter was flanked by graceful, long-stemmed
glasses, a dish of walnuts, and a rather scattered pack of
playing-cards. They had been gaming a little, for his lordship's
amusement and the secretary's profit. Beyond the table, in a
high-backed leather chair, lounged Mr Gascoyne, the secretary,
making an entry in a little leather-bound note-book. His lordship
stood by the window, fretfully tapping one of the panes, his pale
eyes staring out at the wide expanse of snow-enshrouded
country.</p>

<p>The ticking of a little wooden clock on the overmantel, overhung
with holly in honour of the Christmas season that was upon them,
served to stress the silence.</p>

<p>At last the secretary spoke.</p>

<p>"That will be twenty-three guineas you owe me, Frank," he said,
and closed his note-book.</p>

<p>"Will it?" His lordship spoke sourly, without turning. "Ye're a
damned expensive opponent, Basil. You always win."</p>

<p>"Be thankful. For if it were otherwise I shouldn't play. A poor
devil with but a few hundred pounds a year of his own, and the
extravagant tastes of his kind, must perforce look for the crumbs
that fall from your opulent table."</p>

<p>Candour and mockery were the blended wares in which Mr Gascoyne
habitually dealt&mdash;which was one reason why Lord Harpington
liked him. He was a provider of moral salt to temper the insipidity
of the fare by fate and nature predestined to his lordship.</p>

<p>Yet now the candour and mockery were so sharp that his lordship
swung round in surprise.</p>

<p>"Ye're deuced bitter, Basil."</p>

<p>"It's the truth that's bitter. I but enunciate it."</p>

<p>"And that's worse!" cried his lordship. "I vow to God you grow
unendurable."</p>

<p>"Ah well," said Mr Gascoyne, "you'll not have to endure me much
longer." And he reached across to pour himself a glass of wine. He
was a lean, active young man, with a sallow hatchet face under
neatly queued black hair that disdained powder. He was dressed with
simple elegance in a riding-suit of dark green cloth, with long,
black boots armed with tiny silver spurs, and there was a vague,
easy grace in his movements.</p>

<p>His lordship, plump and fair, and slightly overdressed&mdash;in
each and every detail an antithesis to his secretary&mdash;stared a
moment in speechless amazement.</p>

<p>"What the devil d'ye mean by that?" he asked at length. "Ye're
not thinking of leaving me?"</p>

<p>"What's to surprise you? You're getting married. Single, I have
found you difficult. Married, I should probably find you
impossible. Besides, what place&mdash;what endurable
place&mdash;could there be for me in a connubial ménage? Your wife
would probably disapprove of my ways and habits and general want of
respect for your lordship."</p>

<p>"Basil!" There was dismay as well as indignation in the cry. "I
thought you were my friend!"</p>

<p>"So did I. So I am. But I find that you grow more peevish and
difficult in a measure as you put on flesh. And you put on flesh
alarmingly. A vile habit, which will probably be encouraged by
marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn the marriage!" his lordship exploded. "It's none so
certain, after all." He rolled to the fire, and planted himself
squarely with his back to it. "It's bad enough having to give up
Rosie without losing you as well&mdash;and for what, when all's
said? For a saucy baggage who rallies me, and...and slights me at
every chance, and...and altogether is at pains to show that
she...oh, curse it...that she hasn't the least taste for me."</p>

<p>"Since you realize it, why marry?" quoth the secretary, his
voice hardening.</p>

<p>"You know very well why," was the irritable answer. "That
spendthrift father of mine. Molly Westrup is no common heiress. And
a fine, handsome filly, and...and of course I'm deuced fond of
her&mdash;damn her! D'ye suppose I'd have cut with Rosie, and
endured that horrible scene with her, if I hadn't been sharp-set on
Molly Westrup? D'yo suppose we'ld be travelling to Priorlands to
spend Christmas with that peddling, ill-bred moneybags of an uncle
of hers if it had been otherwise?"</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne sipped his wine in silence.</p>

<p>"Pour me a glass," said his lordship, curtly.</p>

<p>The secretary obeyed. His lordship gulped the wine. Then he
looked at Mr Gascoyne, and fetched a sigh.</p>

<p>"I'ld give a deal to...to win her affection," said he.</p>

<p>"You're doing so," Mr Gascoyne reminded him. "You're giving up
Rosie and probably me."</p>

<p>His lordship let the gibe pass. He sighed again. "I wish I had
your way with the women, Basil!"</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne looked up almost startled. "Of what will you be
accusing me next?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. You waste no thought on them. You're a cursed
puritan, a cold-blooded fish of a man. But you draw them to you in
spite of yourself. I've seen it. I believe in my soul that if Miss
Westrup were given the choice she would prefer you, with your few
beggarly hundreds a year, as you say, to me, with my title and the
rest."</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne's eyes were wide, and fixed in their stare; and the
unobservant viscount never noted how white his secretary's face had
become. He smiled faintly, as if with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"It's the way she looks at you. But it's the same with them
all."</p>

<p>He was plaintive. "Why, that slut of a chambermaid just now all
but boxed my ears for no more than pinching her chin; yet if ever
eyes invited liberties it was when they looked at you. What the
devil the women should find to admire in your lean shanks and
lantern jaws is a mystery to me. But there it is; you've a luck
with them that's denied me."</p>

<p>"You can say that in spite of Rosie, drowned in tears of despair
and demanding a thousand guineas with which to patch up the heart
you've broken?"</p>

<p>"If you mention Rosie again, I shall quarrel with you," snapped
his lordship, and he strode back to the window, fuming.</p>

<p>A spell of brooding silence followed. Mr Gascoyne reached up to
the overmantel for a fresh pipe, loaded it from a leaden jar and
lighted it with a spill. He smoked reflectively whilst his lordship
stood moodily tapping the pane as before. From outside came the
sound of hooves and wheels, muffled by the thick carpet of snow,
and presently the harsh voice of the post-boy, shouting: "House!
House!"</p>

<p>His lordship, who had craned forward idly to view the newcomers,
drew back with a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>"Gad! What'll be the meaning of this? Burn me if it isn't old
Westrup and Molly? What the devil are they doing here, instead of
waiting at Priorlands to receive us?"</p>

<p>"We are not expected there until evening," Gascoyne reminded
him. He had risen, and stood now, tall and tense, by the table.</p>

<p>"Shall I ring and send them word that you are here?"</p>

<p>"Pray do."</p>

<p>Yet before the waiting-maid had come in answer to the summons
his lordship had changed, or at least modified, his intention. He
desired his secretary to write a brief note to Mr Westrup, and
instructed the girl to give it to him when the lady was not
looking.</p>

<p>Within five minutes, Mr Westrup, portly and rubicund, rolled
into the panelled room with hands outheld to greet his lordship.
But care sat on his brow, and lurked in the very creases of the
mechanical smile he donned. In passing, he had flung the secretary
a curt nod.</p>

<p>"My lord! My lord!" he bleated. "This is most fortunate. It is
what I hoped. 'Pon honour it is." He took snuff copiously and
nervously. He was manifestly ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>"A glass of port, sir?" Mr Gascoyne invited, decanter in
hand.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir...I thank you."</p>

<p>"You arrive most opportunely," was his lordship's welcome.
"Nothing could be more timely. I have been thinking, and I'm not
altogether happy." Thereafter he held forth at length, and what he
said was much what he had said already to Mr Gascoyne. He dwelt
upon his affection for Miss Westrup, and his distress at the
indifference to him which he suspected in her.</p>

<p>Mr Westrup seemed surprised. "Faith, now, it's the very subject
in which I desired a word with you myself. And I'm glad of this
chance of a heart-to-heart talk with your lordship." Then he became
emphatic, as a man will who desires to convince himself as well as
others. "It's not indifference in the girl, my lord. Not
indifference at all. It's... it's...the devil knows what it is.
I've been wanting to talk to you about it. She's plaguy capricious.
She takes after that trying woman my poor brother married."</p>

<p>His lordship breathed noisily, apprehensively. What he had
sought was contradiction. This unexpected measure of agreement
deepened his dismay. "At least, then, you confess that there is
occasion for my concern." His fair, plump face was overcast.</p>

<p>"Confess it?" said Mr Westrup. "Of course I confess it. I am
glad you should have perceived for yourself how it is with the
baggage. I have been so flurried and cluttered at the thought of
your coming to spend Christmas with us while the minx is in her
present mood that...that, ecod, I've been praying I might have this
chance of a word with you beforehand."</p>

<p>The viscount's pale eyes vacantly considered Mr Westrup, who
stood now warming himself by the fire. Then his lordship poured
himself another glass of wine and drank it.</p>

<p>"Vile port!" he criticized.</p>

<p>"It's your palate," said the secretary, bluntly. "You drink too
much."</p>

<p>Mr Westrup's face expressed surprise and disgust. Like most
parvenus he went in awe of titles, and he never could understand
how a nobleman came to tolerate these liberties in a secretary, a
paid servant. He, too, had paid servants in his counting-house in
the city, creatures who quailed under his glance and quivered at
his nod, men who never dared to speak unless questioned, and this
although Mr Westrup was not a viscount. He concluded with regret
that although a member of the peerage there must be a strain of
weakness in Lord Harpington's character, a strain deplorable in one
so highly placed.</p>

<p>"Ye see," he said, presently, "that niece of mine has stuffed
her head with romantic nonsense."</p>

<p>"Egad," said Mr Gascoyne, "ye'll not be so discourteous as to
suggest that his lordship ain't romantic!"</p>

<p>The merchant was disconcerted.</p>

<p>"No offence, my lord&mdash;no offence," he protested.</p>

<p>Harpington dismissed the matter by a gesture. "Be plain," he
entreated.</p>

<p>"It's best I am sure," Mr Westrup agreed. "You should know
exactly where we stand. Ecod, it's time you did; necessary that you
should. To be plain, as your lordship bids me, this misguided girl
swears at present that she will not marry you. I've done what I
can," he added, hurriedly. "Your lordship may be sure of that. I've
vowed that she shall not have a penny of mine unless she becomes
Lady Harpington. Her answer is...well, damme, it's not civil."</p>

<p>"I always deemed her a lady of spirit," said the incorrigible Mr
Gascoyne, preserving his flippancy in spite of the gloom of his
companions.</p>

<p>"Spirit!" roared her uncle. "Damme, she has more spirit, as you
call it, than is decent in a maid. My poor brother was too weak
with her. He let her grow up a hard-riding hoyden. Too used to
horses! Not good for a woman!" He took snuff again. "And now, ecod,
when she has the chance of a noble marriage, it's heroics she
wants, as if heroic husbands were ever good for a woman's peace of
mind."</p>

<p>His lordship sank mutely into a chair.</p>

<p>"I have often said you are too fat," Mr Gascoyne rallied him.
"But you wouldn't heed me."</p>

<p>"Really, sir&mdash;really, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Gascoyne,"
spluttered the East India merchant. "I call that an impertinence.
Ecod I do."</p>

<p>Blandly Mr Gascoyne pulled at his pipe. "Most pertinent, I
assure you. It is impossible to be fat and heroic at the same
time."</p>

<p>"You call his lordship fat?" Mr Westrup was scandalized.</p>

<p>"Too fat for a hero."</p>

<p>"You're mighty free of your opinions, sir; and to me they seem
singularly superfluous."</p>

<p>"They appear to agree with your niece's, Mr Westrup."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't heed him," broke in his lordship, fretfully. "He's
like that. A crossgrained dog that must be snarling."</p>

<p>"I'ld muzzle him if he were mine&mdash;with deference to your
lordship," said Mr Westrup, and was made still more savage by the
carelessness with which Mr Gascoyne blew smoke in his face.</p>

<p>"What we have to consider," said his downcast lordship, "is
what's to be done. Can I conceivably go on?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can." Mr Westrup was vehement. "Your lordship
would never own yourself beaten by the passing whim of a...a
bread-and-butter miss. All you need is to satisfy these sickly
romantic longings. That's what I had to tell you. If only you could
do... something to fire her fancy, now. Eh? Give it thought, my
lord. Give it thought."</p>

<p>"Fire her fancy?" My lord was nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Turn highwayman, for instance," mocked Mr Gascoyne; "emulate
the exploits of Sixteen-String Jack; or, better still&mdash;I have
it!&mdash;hire an actor to play the highwayman, to hold up and
carry off the haughty maiden; then enter Viscount Harpington, on
horseback very heroic, to give chase and overtake the scoundrel,
and rescue beauty in distress. Perseus delivering Andromeda. Then
we have Beauty swooning on the hero's breast; haughtiness conquered
by heroism&mdash;the whole served hot with a sauce of wedding
bells. Bear with me if I mix my metaphors."</p>

<p>The viscount shrugged his shoulders in irritation. He accounted
his secretary's levity ill-timed. But, incredibly, it was left for
Mr Westrup to grow solemn.</p>

<p>"Ecod, sir!" he cried. "You may jest, but, as the saying goes,
there's many a true word spoke in jest. And never a truer than
that. It is just such a comedy would do what's wanted."</p>

<p>It was Mr Gascoyne's turn to stare. "Fudge!" was his rude
comment.</p>

<p>"You may say 'fudge', young man, and be as uncivil as you
please; but you listen to me, my lord." He became almost eloquent
in an elaboration of the notion that Mr Gascoyne had so mockingly
propounded. He amplified it where necessary, until he had presented
them with a plot complete in every detail. From the apathy in which
his lordship listened at first, his feeble will gradually came
under the spell of the merchant's vehemence.</p>

<p>"'Pon honour," he said, at last, "I believe it could be
done."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" said Gascoyne again. But neither of them heeded
him.</p>

<p>"It can certainly be done," the nabob insisted, entirely
enamoured of a conception which he now believed to be his own. "The
more I think on it, the better I like it. And there's no time to
lose. Why not contrive it this very afternoon? We have the means at
hand, thanks be to this most fortunate meeting. And we shall yet
spend a merry Christmas at Priorlands, and toast the future Lady
Harpington."</p>

<p>"Gad! Westrup..." His lordship came to his feet, a flush
stirring in his cheeks, and clasped hands with his prospective
uncle-in-law.</p>

<p>Over by the fireplace, Gascoyne, who did not appear to share the
sudden enthusiasm of the other two, was pulling fiercely at his
pipe.</p>

<p>"You have the means, you say. But have you? Isn't there
something you forgot? Who is to play the highwayman in this pretty
comedy?"</p>

<p>"Why, you will, of course, Basil," cried his lordship.</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne's pipe fell with a clatter to the fender, and was
shattered. "Not for a thousand pounds," said he.</p>

<p>Westrup turned slowly to survey him</p>

<p>"If I were to say two thousand?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am not for sale, Mr Westrup." Deliberately Gascoyne turned
his shoulder upon the merchant. "Frank," he said, and for once his
tone was serious, "this foolery goes no further. If you can't win
the lady by fair means, you owe it to yourself not to attempt foul
ones."</p>

<p>That put Mr Westrup in a rage. His countenance became
congested.</p>

<p>"I marvel your lordship tolerates him. I do so, ecod!"</p>

<p>His lordship, if annoyed, remained peevishly conciliatory.
"After all, Basil, it was yourself proposed the thing."</p>

<p>"In jest, man. I was rallying you."</p>

<p>"You permit yourself singular liberties, sir," fumed
Westrup.</p>

<p>"But no liberty to equal the proposal that I should take a hand
in so unseemly a business," said Mr Gascoyne.</p>

<p>"Unseemly!" protested his lordship. He forced a laugh. "Sink me,
Basil! Have you never heard that 'all is fair in love and
war'?"</p>

<p>"Even loaded dice?"</p>

<p>"Ay, or marked cards, if you will."</p>

<p>Gascoyne looked at him narrowly for a moment. "You believe that,
do you?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Believe it? Of course I believe it."</p>

<p>"Why, then, since you believe it, I don't see why I shouldn't do
as you require."</p>

<p>"You mean you'll play the highwayman?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean."</p>

<p>After that they went, as it were, into committee, to settle
details. Thanks to Mr Gascoyne's wit and invention, fully deployed
now that he had committed himself to a share in the adventure, this
did not take long. A half-hour later Mr Westrup was driving out of
Farnborough with his niece, who remained in ignorance and
unsuspicious of those with whom her uncle had been closeted at the
<i>Red Fox.</i></p>

<p>The sun's orange disc was on the rim of the snow-bound expanse
of Bagshot Heath, and the blue of the clear sky was fading to
turquoise, when the great family coach toiled up the last gradient
and reached the summit. It lumbered past the fir copse in which Mr
Gascoyne&mdash;who had set out ahead&mdash;sat his horse and
waited. He allowed it to go by, and remained at his post, there on
the heights of Chobham Ridge, until, in the valley below, a
half-mile or so away, a horseman, whom he knew for his lordship,
came into view, approaching by the same road from Farnborough.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr Gascoyne wheeled his horse, and set off in pursuit
of the coach, which by now was a good quarter of a mile ahead. He
rode at an amble, deep in thought, without lessening the distance
between himself and the vehicle. He was considering the exact
manner of accomplishing the thing ahead. It had been settled before
he set out that he should swing the girl to the withers of his
horse, and so ride off with her. Mr Westrup had feared that this
might prove difficult; but he agreed with Mr Gascoyne that if it
could be accomplished the effect would be infinitely more dramatic
than a mere scuffle at the carriage door. Also, the girl's terror
being naturally increased if the supposed highwayman should succeed
in thus rudely carrying her off, it followed that her gratitude to
his lordship when he rescued her would be commensurately greater,
and thus her surrender to him the more assured. His lordship being
better mounted than Mr Gascoyne, whose horse would, moreover,
labour under a double burden, it follows that the latter must
inevitably be quickly overtaken.</p>

<p>It was this last point that was chiefly engaging Mr Gascoyne's
thoughts, as he now ambled forward through the crisp air of that
December evening. And so engrossed was he that he never heeded a
horseman in a brown coat with tarnished lace, and a round hat, who
approached briskly from the south along a bridle-path that crossed
the high road rectangularly at a four-armed signpost some little
way ahead.</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne and the horseman converging towards this signpost
reached it at the same moment. Mr Gascoyne eyed the follow keenly.
Nothing could have been more untimely than this traveller's advent
and the secretary could but hope that their way did not lie along
the same road.</p>

<p>"The compliments of the season to you, sir," the horseman
greeted him, and before Mr Gascoyne could answer, swung his nag
across the secretary's path. The rays of the setting sun glinted
ominously on the long, polished barrel of a pistol, ostentatiously
displayed.</p>

<p>"I'll be troubling your honour for a little Christmas gift,"
said the facetious rogue.</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne, taken aback, looked into a villainous pockmarked
face, with a stubble of beard, and fierce, hard eyes. He laughed,
finding it peculiarly humorous to be thus held up by a real
highwayman whilst in the very act of playing the highwayman
himself. On the instant he decided to keep to the part.</p>

<p>"Stab me!" said he. "Does dog eat dog on Bagshot Heath?"</p>

<p>The tobyman stared, clearly not understanding; but his pistol,
at the cock, continued to cover Mr Gascoyne.</p>

<p>"Whajer mean&mdash;dawg eat dawg?"</p>

<p>"I mean does one gentleman of the toby prey on another
hereabouts? I am a stranger to the place as yet. Hownslow is my
usual hunting-ground. So I ask the question."</p>

<p>"You a cove of the toby?" The highwayman was incredulous and
mistrustful.</p>

<p>In order to reassure him, Mr Gascoyne, who was learned in many
curious arts and sciences, addressed him in the same canting
language, known to every professed rogue in England.</p>

<p>"Would you nip a boung from a gentry cove of the pad? Why then,
ye're no better than a damned foist, and deserve to have your
stumps in the herman. Bing a wast."</p>

<p>The highwayman's gasp was audible.</p>

<p>"Ye can cant," said he, and lowered at last his pistol.
"But&mdash;skewer my vitals!&mdash;ye've little the look of a cove
of the pad."</p>

<p>"Take a lesson from it, brother. Thus you may last longer. Come,
my lad, bing a wast&mdash;out of my way. There's room for both of
us, and game for both of us, on the Heath, as I can show you."</p>

<p>"Can you so?" quoth the ruffian, sneering.</p>

<p>"Ay, can I. Listen, man. There's a gentry cove following, well
mounted on a sturdy roan&mdash;a lord, no less, with well-lined
purse. I took his measure at the <i>Red Fox</i> at Farnborough.
I've been jogging easily to let him overtake me, which is why I let
that coach go by. But as you seem more in need of a good nag, I'll
leave him to you, and take the coach instead."</p>

<p>"Sink me, ye're mighty accommodating," said the suspicious
ruffian. "Why shouldn't I go after the chaise?"</p>

<p>"Because that knacker's carrion you're riding could never
overtake it. But it's as you please."</p>

<p>The highwayman considered him narrowly. "I'ld be more likely to
trust you if you weren't so damned civil."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can persuade you," said Mr Gascoyne.</p>

<p>Equipped, as he came, to play the highwayman, this was not
difficult. From his pocket he drew a square of black crêpe, and
stuck the edge of it under his hat, so that it covered his face
like a mask. Then, whilst the other's attention was riveted, he
unobtrusively whipped a pistol from its holster, and abruptly
levelled it. It happened to be a long and very shiny pistol,
specially procured for the occasion.</p>

<p>"Keep your hand down, my lad. How's that, now? Do you know me
for a brother of the pad?"</p>

<p>"What's your will?" screeched the highwayman, too scared to dare
to raise his own pistol again.</p>

<p>"Why, to share sport with you, as I said. Hark!" Faintly from
the distance came a clopping of hooves. "That'll be his lordship.
Ride on to meet him, and may his purse prove as heavy as I suppose.
Don't stay to thank me. Be prigging!"</p>

<p>At a disadvantage, covered by that ominous pistol, the
highwayman was prompt enough to obey the peremptory order to ride
on.</p>

<p>"May you end on the chates if you're cozening me," he growled,
as he moved past Mr Gascoyne. Then he plied his spurs, and was off
as fast as his nag would carry him in the direction of his
lordship's approach.</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne watched that brisk departure, then laughed as he put
his own horse to the trot. That opportune highwayman had solved his
little problem for him, and it amused him infinitely to consider
Harpington's consternation when confronted by a very different
tobyman from the one he was reckoning to meet.</p>

<p>A half-hour later he overtook the coach, his face again covered
by the square of black crêpe.</p>

<p>"Stand!" he bawled, and let fly a couple of shots as
prearranged.</p>

<p>The postilion, in wholesome fear of a bullet, reined up
obediently, whilst forth from the window came the ruddy countenance
of Mr Westrup demanding querulously what might be amiss.</p>

<p>"It's just," said Mr. Gascoyne, handling his long and shiny
pistol, "that I want to know what treasures you carry in your
coach."</p>

<p>"Treasures, sir! If you want my purse you may have it," and he
flung it down into the snow. "And now perhaps you'll let us on. I
have no treasure save my niece."</p>

<p>"A niece&mdash;a treasure of a niece!" crowed the pseudo-robber,
on a note of laughter. "Why, it is such treasure that I love. Put
up your hands, you dog." He admonished the postilion. "If I have
any tricks from you I'll blow your master's brains out." He swung
nimbly from the saddle, picked up the purse, and then, with the
bridle over his arm, advanced and threw open the door of the
carriage. "Let us be looking at this treasure, sir."</p>

<p>The treasure sat huddled in a corner, very pale and
breathless.</p>

<p>"Come out here where I can see you," Mr Gascoyne commanded
gruffly, and reached forward to seize her wrist.</p>

<p>Mr Westrup, to play the comedy convincingly, attempted to
interpose, loud and angry in his protests; and Mr Gascoyne, to be
no less convincing, floored him neatly by thrusting a knee into his
stomach with possibly a little more weight than was strictly
necessary.</p>

<p>The girl screamed and shrank resisting; but Mr Gascoyne's grip
of her wrist was as firm as his purpose, and for all her struggles
she was dragged relentlessly from the coach. Then, as the pretended
highwayman was steadying her upon her feet, she sank suddenly
against him with closed lids and a fluttering sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh slife! She's swooned," said Mr Gascoyne.</p>

<p>"So much the better," muttered Mr Westrup. "It will make things
easier." He was panting as he picked himself up from the floor of
the chaise. He pawed his stomach. "Ecod, sir, you used a deal of
violence," he complained.</p>

<p>"Would you have had it look what it is?" wondered the other.</p>

<p>"No, no. Away with you now. The Chertsey road, remember."</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne was at some trouble to hoist the swooning girl to
the withers of his horse. Having at last contrived it and mounted,
he held her firmly before him, her head against his breast, and
rode off down the sloping road.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill, when out of sight of the coach, which
remained where he had left it, Miss Westrup opened her eyes, and
removed her head from its resting-place.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said she, "I hope I swooned as convincingly as your
note commanded. Perhaps now you'll tell me what it means?"</p>

<p>Jogging along at an easier pace, Mr Gascoyne rendered an account
of what was planned in the <i>Red Fox Inn.</i></p>

<p>As she listened her cheeks were flushed and pale by turns, and
with these changes of colour there were changes of expression. When
he had done, she looked at him soberly a moment. He had removed the
black crêpe from his face by now.</p>

<p>"You seem to have been oddly lacking in good faith sir," she
reproved him. "You have hardly behaved well by your friend."</p>

<p>"That will be Harpington's point of view. It need not be yours.
I was concerned to behave well to you: to save you from being their
dupe. I refused to have any part in it until I saw that if I held
to that, they would find someone else to play the highwayman. Then
I sent you that note of forewarning, so that I might spare you
anxiety, and also so that by swooning you should spare me trouble.
If I have behaved ill to Frank, at least remember that I had to
choose between that and behaving ill to you."</p>

<p>"You should not have hesitated in the choice. You knew no duty
to me."</p>

<p>Mr Gascoyne said nothing. In the fading daylight his face showed
grim and pale. She stirred within the circle of his supporting arm.
"Is it necessary that you should hold me quite so tightly?"</p>

<p>"You might fall if I did not."</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that if you will let me alight I could contrive
to walk."</p>

<p>"In the snow? Impossible. Have mercy on your feet, so thinly
clad."</p>

<p>They reached a signpost, and Mr Gascoyne drew rein.</p>

<p>"Why do you halt?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Because we are at a cross-roads," said he, "and you must decide
which way we go. You consider that I have behaved unconscionably.
But the harm that I have done is not yet beyond repair."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, and Mr Gascoyne thought that her
breathing quickened.</p>

<p>"Before you lies the road to Chertsey. If we follow it we shall
no doubt be overtaken presently by his lordship, who must by now
have shaken off my friend, the highwayman. It is for you to choose
whether you will allow yourself to be won at once by the heroics
with which he will entertain you, or whether, still resisting now,
you may return to Priorlands to be constrained into finally
becoming Lady Harpington."</p>

<p>"I would yield to constraint, would I? You must think me
singularly weak, sir."</p>

<p>"I think you everything that is dear and lovely and wonderful,"
he said with fervour, "else be sure you would not be where you are
at this moment."</p>

<p>"We had better be pushing on, sir," said she, coolly.</p>

<p>"Towards Chertsey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, whither else?"</p>

<p>"Did I not point out that we stand at a cross-roads? I have told
you what lies along the road to Chertsey. There is, however, still
the Guildford Road. Shall I tell you whither that will lead?"</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said she, still mighty cool.</p>

<p>He was thoughtfully silent for a moment. Then he sighed. "I am
answered. I thank you for the mercy you have used. We ride to
Chertsey, then." And he wheeled his horse about.</p>

<p>"A moment," she begged him. "After all, perhaps...perhaps I had
better know about this other road."</p>

<p>He caught his breath before answering. "It leads to love and
little else besides," said he.</p>

<p>She lowered her head, and spoke so softly that he barely caught
her words. "If I had that perhaps I should want little else
besides."</p>

<p>"It means for you the sacrifice of so much, and...Oh, Molly,
could you go that way with me?"</p>

<p>"At last," said she, between a laugh and a sob, "you set me a
question I can answer."</p>

<p>"And you answer...?"</p>

<p>"That way or another with you, my dear." Her voice broke. "I
thought you would never see."</p>

<p>"I scarcely dared to look," he cried, and drew her closer to
him.</p>

<p>Above them, on the crest of the hill, the lights of a carriage
flashed suddenly upon the deepening gloom. She clutched his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Quick," she bade him. "Quick! The Guildford Road." And thus was
her choice made.</p>

<p>A letter survives which Mr Gascoyne wrote to Lord Harpington
from Guildford on that memorable Christmas Day.</p>

<p class="letter">My dear Frank,<br>
<br></p>

<p>Yourself propounded it that in love and war even loaded dice are
fair. Complain not, therefore, that I have loaded the dice against
you. Something must have delayed you upon the road, for you left me
riding too long with Molly in my arms. This produced inevitable
consequences, and she and I were married this morning. Remembering
how reluctant you were to break with Rosie, I am sure that you will
be glad to find consolation with her, and therefore see no cause
for distress on your account. I even hope that, returning me good
for evil, you will make our peace with your nabob. I hope that you
and he are spending a merry Christmas together, although I dare not
suppose that it is as happy as our own.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. CASANOVA'S ALIBI</h2>

<p>THERE can be little doubt&mdash;although it is not explicitly so
stated in his Memoirs&mdash;that it was the sight of the mast of
the fruit boat before the window of his prison that first dropped
the seed of inspiration into the fertile soil of his rascally
mind.</p>

<p>But let us begin at the beginning of this account of one of the
early exploits of that Giacomo di Casanova, who has been aptly
described as the Prince of Adventurers, and whom some have
accounted the very Prince of Scoundrels.</p>

<p>He was at the time in his twentieth year, but with the
appearance of at least another five or six. Extremely tall,
well-made and personable, he had already acquired that noble air
which later&mdash;and coupled with his amazing impudence and still
more amazing wits&mdash;was to stand him in such excellent stead in
the exploitation of his fellow-men. He was perhaps at the most
critical age of his life. The career of the priesthood, for which
he had been intended by his mother, and for which, surely, there
never was born a man less suitable, had rejected him. The seminary
at Padua, in which he had been qualifying for holy orders, outraged
by the wildness of his almost pagan nature, had very properly
expelled him. He had taken the expulsion shamelessly, in that
spirit of philosophy for which he is so remarkable, accounting all
happenings as for the best. Blithely he had exchanged the
seminarist's frock for a laced coat, bought at second-hand, and the
steel-hilted sword of the ruffler. Thus arrayed, he had returned in
the summer of the year 1743 to Venice, the city of his birth,
intent upon following his destiny&mdash;<i>sequere deum</i>, as he,
himself, expresses it. There he eked out at the gaming-tables the
slender allowance which his mother sent him out of her earnings on
the trestles of a <i>forain</i> theatre at Warsaw; and we perceive
already the beginnings of that extraordinary success of his at faro
and other kindred games; a success so constant that, in spite of
his emphatic and repeated assurances, it is impossible to escape a
suspicion that he had discovered how to govern fortune by
astuteness. But that is by the way.</p>

<p>The trouble with which we are now concerned came to him through
one Razetta, a Venetian of some substance and importance, of whom
he has many evil things to say, some of which are very possibly
true. In what Razetta first provoked his hostility we are not
permitted to perceive. But we do know that such was his hatred of
the man that although Razetta must undoubtedly have been considered
an excellent match for Casanova's sister&mdash;and there is no
suggestion that his intentions by her were not honest&mdash;our
young adventurer was determined not to have him for a
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Casanova's sister dwelt, as did Casanova himself in the early
days of that sojourn of his in Venice, at the house of the Abbé
Grimani, the kindly old tutor appointed to the pair by their absent
mother. At this house Razetta became a constant visitor, and as
soon as our shrewd-eyed ex-seminarist had perceived the real object
of these visits, he determined to put an end to them.</p>

<p>He began with his sister. He addressed her one evening in that
pseudo-philosophic strain which he affected&mdash;if his Memoirs
are a faithful mirror of his utterances&mdash;a habit of speech
acquired, we suppose, in the course of his preparations for a
pulpit which, fortunately, he was never destined to disgrace. He
reduced her, he says, to tears; which is not in the least
surprising to those acquainted with his rhetoric. Then he flung out
in pursuit of her lover, who had just taken leave of Grimani. He
overtook him on the Rialto, as he was crossing the bridge, preceded
by a servant who carried a lantern. Casanova took him by the
shoulder, announced that he desired two words in private with him,
and ordered the servant to place himself out of earshot.</p>

<p>Razetta, an uncomely gentleman of five-and-twenty or so, too
corpulent for his age, not suspecting what was coming, and deeming
it well to use civility towards the brother&mdash;and such a
brother&mdash;of the lady to whose favour he aspired, made no
demur.</p>

<p>Casanova proved as prodigal of words with him as he was sparing
of tact.</p>

<p>"It distresses me, Messer Razetta, that a gentleman of my
condition should be reduced to discussing with an animal of yours
so delicate a matter as his own sister. It is an indignity forced
upon me by your lack of discretion. You have been wanting in that
fine feeling which might have saved us both from the humiliations
inseparable from this interview. That, after all, I suppose, was
only to be expected from a person of your vulgarity."</p>

<p>Razetta's face had become congested. "Sir!" he gasped. "You
insult me."</p>

<p>"I felicitate you upon a susceptibility to insult which I should
never have suspected in a man of your deplorable origin and
neglected breeding. Since it is so, I am permitted to hope that we
may yet understand each other without my being put to the trouble
of proceeding to harsher measures."</p>

<p>"Not another word, sir," blazed Razetta. "You...you...will not
listen to another word."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he swung upon his heel, and was making off when
Casanova took him by the shoulder again. I have said that Casanova
was of more than common height; it remains to add that he was of
more than common strength. Razetta's soft flesh was mangled in that
iron grip.</p>

<p>Casanova swung him round, and smiled balefully into the
empurpled face. "It is as I feared," he said. "Indeed, until you
spoke of insult, it had not occurred to me that mere words could be
of the least avail with you. Nor, indeed, was I prepared to use
with you any argument whatever. My sole intent was to command you
never again to show your nasty face at the Abbé Grimani's whilst my
sister is a resident there, and to assure you that in the event of
disobedience&mdash;a folly to which I implore you not to commit
yourself&mdash;I shall be under the necessity of breaking every
bone of your body, among which your neck will probably be
included."</p>

<p>Razetta shook with fear and rage. "By the Madonna," he swore, "I
go straight to the Signoria, to inform the Saggio of your threats,
and to claim protection. You'll be laid by the heels for it, you
rascal. There is law and order in Venice, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas!" Casanova interrupted him. "You precipitate your
fate."</p>

<p>He swung his cane, and brought it down about the shoulders of
his victim. Razetta struggled as best he might, struck out in
self-defence, and bellowed for help. Over the kidney stones of the
bridge his servant came clattering to his assistance. Casanova,
resuming his grip of Razetta's shoulder, pulled him down to the
foot of the bridge, where the parapet ended, and incontinently
flung him into the canal.</p>

<p>When the servant reached him, Casanova was straightening his
cravat and smoothing his ruffles. With his cane he pointed
superfluously to the water, where Razetta was floundering and
gurgling, in danger of drowning.</p>

<p>"There's your master. If you have any sense of your duty to
mankind you will leave him where he is. But you may want to fish
him out for the sake of the wages he will owe you. A pity."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and went home to supper, feeling that he
had borne himself with infinite credit, but deploring that in the
absence of gloves he had been under the necessity of soiling his
hands by the contact of so vile a body.</p>

<p>The sequel was what you might expect. Razetta, rescued from
drowning, smarting with pain and anger, and still dripping, went
instantly to lay his plaint before the Chief Notary&mdash;the
Saggio della Scrittura&mdash;who was responsible for order in the
Republic.</p>

<p>Next morning Casanova awakened to find his bedchamber invaded by
Messer Grande, as the functionary was styled who executed the
orders of the Saggio. In Messer Grande's large black gondola he was
carried off to the Palace of the Signoria, and was presently
brought before the magistrate and confronted with Razetta.</p>

<p>With wrathful volubility, punctuated by sneezings, the injured
man poured out his bitter tale, and his servant confirmed on oath
the truth of every word of it.</p>

<p>The Saggio was stern. "What have you to say?" he asked
Casanova.</p>

<p>The swarthy, masterful face was a study in scorn; the full, red
lips curled contemptuously. He was not to suffer truth to be an
insurmountable obstacle to his defence.</p>

<p>"I have to say, Excellency, that this tale is all a lie. These
villains abuse your credulity and make a mock of your justice. Let
me throw light upon their motives. This rascal, this gutterling,
permits himself the effrontery of paying his addresses to my
sister. I have intimated my natural distaste to him, and informed
him that it must cease. This, Excellency, is his retort: basely to
employ you to remove me, so that his ineffable purposes may be
served. His lackey there is bribed and suborned to confirm the lies
with which he insults you."</p>

<p>This was merely the beginning of his oration. Volubility never
failed him, and whatever the Church may have gained when he was
cast out of the seminary, there can be little doubt that she lost a
preacher likely to have become famous, another Bossuet. What he may
have lacked in evidence he supplied by fervid verbiage. It was of
the kind that carries conviction. Unfortunately on this occasion
there was against him the testimony of Razetta's back and
shoulders, still contused from last night's drubbing. The Saggio
inquired sardonically whether it was suggested that Messer Razetta
had had himself belaboured especially so that he might add weight
to his accusation.</p>

<p>Casanova was scornful. "Evidence that he has been belaboured is
not evidence that I belaboured him," he said.</p>

<p>This was reasonable enough. What was not so reasonable was that
he allowed the magistrate to perceive that his scorn was for His
Excellency's wits. The Saggio, after all, was only human, and so
Messer Casanova was taken back to the black gondola. This was
headed towards the Lido, and brought up a half-hour later at the
steps of the Fortress of Sant' Andrea, fronting the Adriatic, at
the very spot where the bucentaur comes to a halt when the Doge
goes on the Feast of the Annunciation to wed the sea. A year's
sojourn in this prison was the sentence passed upon Casanova for
his offence against the peace of Venice.</p>

<p>The place was garrisoned by Albanian soldiers, from that part of
Epirus which belonged to the Most Serene Republic. The governor was
a Major Pelodoro, whom the ingratiatory Casanova impressed so
favourably that he was given the freedom of the fortress. The Major
took a lenient view of his offence, and was persuaded by the
singular charm of the prisoner's assurances that the sentence was,
anyway, unjust. He gave him a fine room on the first floor, with
two windows overlooking the water, and it was from these that
Casanova first espied the mast of that fruit boat, and conceived
the notion of enlisting the fruit-seller's assistance so as to
escape.</p>

<p>That, of course, was no more than the first crude germinal
thought. Another in Casanova's place might have lacked the wit to
go beyond it. But he perceived at once that a mere evasion could
profit him but little in the end. It would mean remaining a
fugitive from justice, probably hunted, certainly unable ever to
show his face again in Venice, save at the risk of being dealt with
in a fashion far more rigorous than the present. A door was
certainly open to him; and he were a fool not to avail himself of
it; yet he were doubly a fool unless he could avail himself of it
to better purpose than had at first occurred to him.</p>

<p>He gave it thought, and this so fruitfully that when, soon after
dawn on the morrow, the gentle splash of an oar sounded below, he
slipped from his bed and gained the window. The single mast of the
fruit barge came level with it at that moment.</p>

<p>Casanova put his head between the sill and the iron bar of the
window, and called softly to the boatmen.</p>

<p>"Holà, my friends! Have you any peaches?"</p>

<p>"Peaches, excellency? At once."</p>

<p>One of the two men steadied the boat against the wall of the
fort whilst the other swarmed up the short, stout mast, with a
basket on the crook of his arm. Casanova stretched out to reach it,
emptied the peaches on to the floor of his room, and put a gold
coin in the basket.</p>

<p>"That," he said, pointing to the glistening ducat, "is fruit of
another sort; it grows on the Tree of Wisdom. If you choose you may
fill your pannier with the like."</p>

<p>The boatman, stupefied by such munificence, invoked every saint
in the calendar to come and protect this prince who gave gold for
peaches worth a few pence.</p>

<p>"Show me but where the tree stands, excellency," he ended.</p>

<p>Casanova's answer was indirect. "What would you do for ten
ducats?" In naming that sum he named practically all the money in
his possession, yet a sum, as he knew, which to a man of the
fruiterer's modest estate must appear a fortune.</p>

<p>"Anything short of murder."</p>

<p>Casanova smiled, and nodded. "Be here at ten tonight, then. Now
go with God."</p>

<p>Casanova's first impulse was to send the peaches, with his
compliments, to the governor's wife. But, considering that his
possession of them might afterwards supply a trace, however
slender, he decided instead to eat a couple, and drop the
remainder, one by one, into the sea.</p>

<p>Later that day, whilst taking the air with the Major's
aide-de-camp, he happened to leap down from a parapet of the
bastion. As his foot touched the ground he cried out in pain,
staggered, and fell in a heap, clapping his hand to his knee.
Stefani, the aide, came in quick concern to his assistance.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Casanova, and made shift to rise unaided.
Finding the task impossible, however, he availed himself of the
kindly hand that was proffered. Thus he came to his feet, or,
rather, to his left foot, for now that he was standing he found it
quite impossible to put his right foot to the ground. It was clear,
he declared, that he had sprained his knee. He clenched his teeth
as he spoke in a pain that Stefani perceived must be intense.</p>

<p>Leaning upon his cane on one side, and heavily upon Stefani's
arm on the other, he hobbled painfully indoors and straight to his
room, where presently he was attended by the surgeon of the fort.
The knee was examined, and although no swelling was yet
perceptible, it was undoubtedly extremely sensitive, for the
patient winced and cried out whenever the surgeon pressed upon the
cap.</p>

<p>"Evidently a sprain of the ligaments," the surgeon concluded.
"Not very serious, but naturally painful. A very delicate joint,
the knee. You have had a narrow escape, my dear sir. As it is, a
few days of absolute rest and a bandage according to a fashion of
which I possess the secret, and you will be yourself again. But
absolute rest, let me assure you, is essential."</p>

<p>"I don't need the assurance." Casanova's lips twisted in painful
humour. "I couldn't move if I would."</p>

<p>With the joint tightly bound in a bandage soaked in camphorated
spirits of wine, and with the ailing helpless limb stretched across
a chair, Casanova moped through the remainder of that day. The
Major and some of the officers of the garrison, taking pity upon
him, spent a portion of the evening at cards with him, and whatever
the condition of his leg, it was clear that his wits had suffered
no damage, for despite the small points for which they played he
contrived to win a few ducats from them.</p>

<p>When, towards eight o'clock, they left him, to go to supper, he
begged that his servant might be sent to him and permitted to spend
the night in his room, considering his crippled state.</p>

<p>This temporary valet was a soldier of the garrison, whose
services the prisoner had been permitted to hire for a few coppers
daily. The fellow's chief recommendation lay in the fact that he
had been a hairdresser before enlisting, and Casanova, vain of his
thick, lustrous mane, demanded always the utmost attention for it.
At this particular moment the sometime hairdresser possessed
another quality that commended him to his temporary master. He was
a notorious drunkard. Casanova, more than ordinarily indulgent now,
supplied him with the means to gratify his vice. He gave him money
and made him procure three bottles of a full-bodied Falernian from
the canteen. Further, he insisted that the fellow should drink them
all himself; that is to say, if such mild persuasion as it was
necessary to employ can be described as insistence.</p>

<p>By half-past nine the bottles were empty, and the soldier-valet
was snoring resonantly. By ten o'clock the entire fort was wrapped
in slumber, for strict discipline prevailed and early hours were
kept. Within a few minutes thereafter came the splash of an oar
under Casanova's window, and but for the darkness a mast might have
been seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly and miraculously cured of his lameness, Casanova
slipped from the bed upon which he had been lying fully clothed.
Nothing could have been more agile than the gait with which he sped
to the window. The opening was crossed by a single rod of iron. But
Casanova, whilst tall and strong, was still of a stripling
slenderness at this time of his life, and there was just room for
him to squeeze through the gap below the bar. He tied a sheet to
it, twisted this into a rope, and a moment later he was standing
amid the decaying vegetable matter in the barge.</p>

<p>There he found one man only, the fruiterer with whom he had that
morning made his bargain. He pressed five ducats into the rogue's
hand.</p>

<p>"The other five when the thing is done," he promised. "Now push
off."</p>

<p>"Whither, excellency?"</p>

<p>"Why, to Venice. Land me at the Schiavoni."</p>

<p>They had words on this. The boatman had conceived that the
fugitive&mdash;as he naturally supposed Casanova&mdash;would desire
him to make for the open sea beyond the Lido, and so head for the
mainland. This going to Venice seemed to him fraught with danger,
and he spoke of the risk of being sent to the galleys if he were
caught assisting the evasion of a prisoner. Casanova reminded him
that he was to receive ten ducats, that ten ducats was worth some
risk, and that he could not have supposed that he was to receive so
great a sum merely in order to take a gentleman for a pleasure
jaunt in his foul-smelling barge. Still, if he had been under that
delusion, it only remained for him to return the five ducats
already received, and allow his passenger to climb back into his
room in the fort. As he spoke, in his softest voice, Casanova
picked up a stout oaken cudgel that lay opportunely under his hand
in the bottom of the boat, as perhaps a gentle hint of what might
happen if the boatman's choice did not happen to be what was
desired.</p>

<p>That ended the argument, and a half-hour later Casanova was
landed at the Schiavoni. Bidding the boatman await him there, he
went off at speed, making for the Piazza, and thence by narrow
streets to the Rialto.</p>

<p>It was Razetta's invariable habit, upon leaving the Abbé
Grimani's, to repair for a while to an obscure café beyond the
bridge, taking his way home thence at about eleven o'clock.
Casanova was counting upon this. Should the man unfortunately
happen to depart tonight from his habit, Casanova must have
recourse to sending him a message that would bring him forth.</p>

<p>Leaning upon the parapet of the bridge, he waited patiently,
smiling grimly down into the black oily waters in pleasurable
anticipation of the business ahead.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed. A few minutes after eleven had struck a
man emerged from one of the little side streets on the right, again
accompanied by another who carried a lantern. This light, borne by
a servant, revealed Razetta.</p>

<p>Casanova quitted his position, and moved down to meet him. The
place at that hour was quite deserted, and they had it to
themselves.</p>

<p>They came face to face at the foot of the bridge, Casanova
walking in the middle of the road. There he halted in such a way as
to bar the other's passage, whereupon the servant raised the
lantern so that the light fell upon Casanova's face. Stupefaction
in Razetta was swiftly succeeded by fear. He conceived himself
confronted by an assailant. Casanova chose to play the
assailed.</p>

<p>"Do you put yourself in my way?" he cried. He whirled the
cudgel, which he had thoughtfully brought with him from the fruit
barge, and the lantern flew into a thousand atoms.</p>

<p>"Seize him!" cried Razetta to his lackey. The servant, however,
displayed no alacrity. He was nursing a hand that tingled from the
blow that had swept away the lantern. Razetta stormed on. "Body of
Satan! You've broken prison, have you? This will mean the galleys
for you, you rascal. The galleys."</p>

<p>"I don't know whom you are supposing me," said Casanova. "But
you appear to be in a mistake."</p>

<p>"Mistake? Do you think I don't know you, rascal? You are
Casanova. Seize him, zany!"</p>

<p>"Seize me, do you say? Madonna! If we are to have violence I
must defend myself as best I can."</p>

<p>On the occasion of their last unhappy meeting he had been armed
with a slender cane capable of comparatively light punishment.
Tonight the stout oaken cudgel that he wielded went near to
endangering Razetta's life. The unfortunate lover screamed under
its smashing blows, whilst his servant roared lustily for help.
Casanova was too wise to linger. As before, he heaved Razetta into
the canal, flung the cudgel after him and, in a voice of thunder,
ordered the servant to be silent.</p>

<p>"Instead of squalling there, go and fish him out, so that I may
have the pleasure of throwing him in again upon some other
evening."</p>

<p>Already steps were approaching at a run. Casanova vanished into
the darkness of a by-street, and within ten minutes of flinging
Razetta into the water he was back at the Schiavoni, and once more
aboard the fruit barge. There was a freshening breeze, so they
hoisted sail, and made a good speed towards the Lido and the Fort
of Sant' Andrea beyond it.</p>

<p>Before midnight had struck Casanova was climbing through the
window of his prison. Another couple of minutes and he had peeled
off his clothes and put himself to bed. His servant still slept in
his chair, as Casanova had left him. One of the boots that Casanova
flung at him struck him on the brow, whereupon he awoke with a
choking start.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir? What is it?" he babbled, still half bemused
from sleep and wine.</p>

<p>"You drunken dog!" roared Casanova. "Were you sent here to sleep
or to watch over me? I might die for aught you know or care. Go
fetch me the surgeon. I am in agony. My knee's on fire. I have a
fever. See, I am all a-sweat. I cannot sleep. Go. Make haste."</p>

<p>Before that fierce urgency the servant fled, to return in a few
minutes with the surgeon, who, in nightcap and bedgown, came
puffing and grumbling at this midnight disturbance. Even as he
entered Casanova's room the hour was booming from St Mark's through
the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>Casanova lay moaning, with his eyes half-closed. Seeing him
thus, the surgeon stifled his irritation. "What's this? What now?
Are you in pain?"</p>

<p>"In pain? In Hell, I think, and have been this hour past. A
half-hour it took me to awaken that drunken sot. A half-hour of
sheer agony. I burn. My knee throbs. I cannot sleep. For God's sake
do something to help me."</p>

<p>Mechanically the surgeon took his pulse, and to his alarm
discovered that it had almost ceased to beat. He was not to guess
that in expectation of this Casanova had tied a ligature round his
upper arm under his shirt. He departed in order to mix a drug, and
on the way roused the governor, to inform him that Casanova was
desperately ill. Major Pelodoro cursed Casanova and the doctor with
equal fervour for disturbing his rest, unsympathetically turned
over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Casanova swallowed the drug when it was brought, and the surgeon
sat with him until he announced that he felt easier, and thought
that he might perhaps now sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he was so much better that he was able, supported
by his servant, to hobble to breakfast in the governor's
dining-room&mdash;for the governor had made him free of his table.
There he congratulated the surgeon in very graceful and flattering
terms upon his skill and the efficacy of his drugs. His knee was
much less painful, he announced. The surgeon recommended care and
rest for a few days, when he was sure that all would be well.</p>

<p>But there was to be no rest for Casanova just yet. Breakfast was
scarcely over when the barge of Messer Grande drew up at the Fort
of Sant' Andrea. The functionary was received by Stefani, the
aidede-camp, to whom he announced his errand.</p>

<p>"I am sent by his Excellency the Saggio to seek an explanation
from Major Pelodoro. His Excellency desires to know how it happens
that he has not been informed of the evasion of your prisoner,
Messer Giacomo di Casanova."</p>

<p>"Evasion?" echoed Stefani. "What evasion? There has been no
evasion."</p>

<p>"Conduct me to the governor," said Messer Grande, peremptory and
self-sufficient.</p>

<p>"I think it will be best," said Stefani, and led the way.</p>

<p>Messer Grande, a big man in black, carrying a cane, was ushered
into the Major's office. He repeated the matter of his errand.</p>

<p>"His Excellency desires you to explain how it happens that the
evasion of your prisoner, Casanova, should have been communicated
to him by others than yourself."</p>

<p>The Major, who was by nature peppery, stared at him with
bulging, angry eyes, offended by the policeman's tone. "What the
devil is the meaning of this impertinence? Don't put on that air
with me, my man. It's as silly as your message."</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried the officer in a big voice.</p>

<p>"Bah! Stefani, be good enough to ask Messer Casanova to give
himself the trouble of coming here."</p>

<p>Messer Grande's eyes grew round. His mouth kept them some sort
of company. "Do I understand that Messer Casanova is still in the
fort?"</p>

<p>"Where the devil else should he be? What's this cock-and-bull
tale of an evasion?"</p>

<p>"Cock-and-bull! I only know...ah...His Excellency is
assured...He has evidence that Messer Casanova was in Venice last
night."</p>

<p>"Has he? Well, I have evidence that he wasn't. Here it
comes."</p>

<p>Casanova hobbled in, one arm round his servant's neck, the other
round Stefani's, so that between them they seemed to carry him. He
looked bland inquiry from the Major to Messer Grande, and waited
for them to speak. As Messer Grande merely stared, and the Major
merely sneered, it was he, himself, who at last broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"May I hope, sir, that your presence here and Major Pelodoro's
request for my presence means that the truth of the matter with
which I am charged has at last been brought to light, and that you
are come to set me at liberty? Since I am suffering, as you may
see, the news would be very welcome. Though considering that
yesterday morning I had the misfortune to twist my knee, and have
since been unable to walk, I am less vexed by my imprisonment at
the moment than I might be at another time."</p>

<p>"You spoke of evidence," said the Major, enjoying the
high-and-mighty Messer Grande's confusion, "Is that evidence enough
for you? Or do you still think I allow my prisoners to escape?"</p>

<p>"I...I am at a loss," the functionary confessed. "Here are the
facts as I have them from His Excellency." His explanation
followed. Razetta and his servant had been before the Saggio that
very morning to lay a second plaint against Casanova, the details
of which the officer now supplied.</p>

<p>Casanova's face was blank with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Can malice really go so far? This is quite incredible."</p>

<p>"Incredible?" cried the governor. "It's impossible. At what hour
does this man say that the assault took place?"</p>

<p>"At a little before midnight."</p>

<p>"That is easily disproved. But we won't waste words. Messer
Casanova had best go before His Excellency, and his servant and the
surgeon, who were attending to him here at midnight, shall go with
him."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," said Casanova. "I can only look upon this as
a dispensation of Providence to establish the villainy of
Razetta."</p>

<p>His arrival at the Palace of the Signory surprised the Saggio as
much as his appearance in the fort had surprised Messer Grande.</p>

<p>Casanova bowed as gracefully as his crippled condition would
permit, a twinge of pain crossing his features in the act. He
begged the Saggio, of his charity, to permit him to sit, and when
this was considerately granted, he was lowered gently into the
chair by the surgeon and his servant, his maimed leg stretched
stiffly in front of him. He then delivered one of his famous
addresses.</p>

<p>Somewhere in his voluminous Memoirs he protests that a gentleman
should never have recourse to anything but the truth, save only
when he has dealings with rogues, with whom the truth would be
unavailing. It would seem to follow that he had a good many
dealings with rogues in his time, and it looks in this case as if
the Saggio were carelessly included in that category
notwithstanding his unimpeachable integrity.</p>

<p>"I understand, Excellency," he began, "that it is alleged by the
man Razetta, and his servant, that last night, near the Bridge of
the Rialto, at about midnight, I fell upon him with a cudgel,
belaboured him, and then flung him into the canal, all, in fact,
precisely as before."</p>

<p>"That is so," said the bewildered Saggio.</p>

<p>"When I was last before Your Excellency, I had the honour to
inform you that your credulity was being abused and your high
office mocked by those two villains, who conspired to procure my
ruin. It is not for me to blame Your Excellency for having been
their dupe. They were two, and I was but one, and the law&mdash;of
which Your Excellency is so exalted and enlightened an
administrator&mdash;runs that the testimony of two persons shall
outweigh that of one. Happily there is another justice, which sees
into the very hearts of men, a justice more discerning and
far-reaching than that human justice of which Your Excellency is so
noble and shining a dispenser. This justice has ordained that these
rascals should overreach themselves in order to betray their own
falsehood. If Your Excellency's renowned perspicacity should ever
plumb the full depth of this infamy, it will be discovered, I have
no doubt, that the man Razetta, misled by some false rumour that I
had broken prison, and actuated by his malice against me to spur
you on to effect my recapture, has come to you with this fresh
lie."</p>

<p>"The falsehood of your having broken prison is, of course,
plain," said the Saggio. "Yet Messer Razetta's condition this
morning, and the testimony of several witnesses, besides his
servant, proves beyond doubt that he was cruelly beaten and thrown
into the canal."</p>

<p>"All exactly as before, when I had the honour to point out to
Your Excellency that evidence that the man had been beaten was not
evidence that I had beaten him. It now appears to be established by
the facts that I am not the only person in Venice who knows the
execrable Razetta for a villain, and that those others signify
their perception of the fact with a violence of which I ask Your
Excellency to believe that I am incapable. Not only, as Your
Excellency perceives, have I not broken prison, I could not have
done so had the opportunity been supplied, and had I wished to do
so. As the surgeon here will tell you, I have been crippled these
four-and-twenty hours, unable to walk without assistance. Both he
and this servant of mine will swear that precisely at the hour at
which I am accused of having committed this assault on the Rialto I
was in bed at Sant' Andrea, in extreme pain, in an exhausted
condition and quite incapable of walking unaided. At need Major
Pelodoro will add his testimony that he was informed of my need of
the doctor's assistance at that hour. I will leave it to them to
add what may be necessary so as to enable Your Excellency's acute
penetration to reach the truth of this affair."</p>

<p>The Saggio heard the other two in turn, questioned them closely,
and if they were less prolix, they were so definite that no
conclusion was possible other than that which Casanova had
indicated.</p>

<p>"It is enough," said His Excellency at last. "Since it is
established beyond doubt that Messer Razetta was mistaken in his
assailant last night it is impossible to resist the conclusion that
he would be no less mistaken on the former occasion."</p>

<p>"Mistaken?" said Casanova, with a wry smile. "Is it possible
that Your Excellency does not yet perceive the malice of that
wicked man?"</p>

<p>The Saggio took up a pen. "You will be restored at once to
liberty, Messer Casanova," he announced. "No need in this instance
to confront you with your accusers. The case is too clear. I will
deal with them." He bent to write, but Casanova had not yet reached
the end of his rascally purpose.</p>

<p>"I go in such dread of the rancour of this villain," he said,
"that I implore Your Excellency to accord me the State's protection
until I am restored to such vigour as will enable me to protect
myself. I shall be eternally grateful for permission to return to
Sant' Andrea until my knee is completely mended&mdash;a matter of a
week or so, the surgeon informs me."</p>

<p>The Saggio considered. "Very well," he said, at last, "if you
wish it."</p>

<p>But still Casanova had not done. "I thank Your Excellency, and
it only remains for me most respectfully to submit that some amend
is due for what I have suffered, morally and physically: the
indignity extremely painful to a man of my sensitive honour, the
duress in which I have been kept, and, finally, my present crippled
state arising directly out of my imprisonment."</p>

<p>"The State, sir..." the Saggio was beginning coldly, when
Casanova interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, your indulgence! It is not from the State that I
suggest that any amend should come. It is not the fault of the
State that these misfortunes have happened to me, but solely of
this infamous liar Razetta. And I submit&mdash;most respectfully
and humbly&mdash;that from Razetta should come the adequate
compensation I solicit."</p>

<p>The Saggio proved sympathetic. Persuaded that Casanova had been
ill-used, he confessed that the claim was not unreasonable, and he
invited Casanova to state the sum which in his view would be an
adequate solatium.</p>

<p>Casanova fetched a sigh. "It is not in ducats and sequins that a
gentleman of my condition can appraise the hurts he has suffered in
honour and in body. Not, then, to compensate me so much as to
punish the abominable Razetta for falsely procuring my imprisonment
do I suggest that he should be mulcted in my favour to the extent
of&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;a hundred ducats."</p>

<p>The Saggio pursed his lips. The sum was heavy. "I should say,"
he opined, "that fifty ducats would be an abundant fine."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is the best judge," said Casanova, with angelic
submission. "Fifty ducats be it, then, so as to teach him the way
of truth and honesty for the future."</p>

<p>Thus ended the matter in spite of all that Razetta had presently
to say, which was a deal, and some of it so offensive and profane
that it only served to confirm the Saggio in the conviction that he
was dispensing strict justice to a worthless rascal.</p>

<p>With the fifty ducats Casanova set up a faro bank, and prospered
so well that before long Venice became too hot for him, and he was
compelled to seek fresh pastures for the nourishment of talents
which, whilst undoubtedly outstanding, must, by the moralist, be
accounted deplorable.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. THE OPEN DOOR</h2>

<p>"THE open door," says the Castilian proverb, "will tempt a
saint," which is only the Spanish way of saying that opportunity
makes a thief.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that Florimond Souverain de la Galette was a
saint, or only exceptional temptation would lead him to seize an
opportunity of profit, whatever the moral considerations involved.
Nor did the discerning suppose that he had any right to that too
high-sounding name of his, or that it was anything more than one of
the theoretical properties calculated to create the romantic
background which he conceived proper to his profession. It was a
piece with his favourite description of himself: "I live by the
sword."</p>

<p>This being translated into vulgar terms meant no more than that
he was a fencing master. The sword by which he lived was buttoned
and padded at the point, otherwise he would not have lived by it
long. For, in fact, he was an indifferent performer; and if he
drove even a precarious trade in the exercise of his art, this was
because a great vogue of swordsmanship had been created in the
declining lustres of the eighteenth century by the <i>Art des
Armes</i>, that revolutionary and widely read treatise on fencing
by the great Parisian master, Guillaume Danet.</p>

<p>Those were days in which the name of Guillaume Danet was on
every lip. His methods were discussed wherever gentlemen assembled,
and fantastic tales were told of his wizardry with the blade.</p>

<p>It was Florimond's pretence that he had studied under Danet. The
truth was that he had learnt what swordsmanship he knew in a
third-rate Paris fencing-school, where, in addition to sweeping up
the floor and furbishing the foils, it had been his function to
instruct beginners in the various guards. He had read Guillaume
Danet's famous treatise assiduously, and, having scraped together a
few louis, the little rascal had gone off to Rheims to set up as a
master-at-arms. Over his door he hung a shield, bearing the
conventional but in his case unauthorized and inaccurate legend,
<i>"Maître en fait d'Armes des Académies de S.M. le Roi."</i> And
he appropriated some of the lustre of the great name of Danet by
unblushingly proclaiming himself the favourite pupil of that
celebrated master.</p>

<p>That magical name accomplished all that Florimond could have
hoped, but only until the young gentlemen of the neighbourhood, who
had flocked so eagerly to his academy, discovered the falsehood of
his pretensions to teach an art of which he himself possessed
little more than the rudiments. After that, his only pupils were a
few aspiring younger members of the bourgeoisie, and Florimond fell
upon esurient days.</p>

<p>His fortunes were touching their nadir when he became aware of
that open door which is said to tempt the saint. He made the
discovery, by purest chance, at the inn of the <i>Sucking
Calf&mdash;Le Veau Qui Tète</i>&mdash;where it was his evening
habit to sit over a game of écarté with Philibert the notary,
Desjardins the wine merchant, and Fleury the apothecary.</p>

<p>Into that hostelry, on an evening of Spring, came a gaudy,
overdressed young man in yellow and silver, with cheap lace at
throat and wrist, and a ribbon wherever he could stick one, who had
just descended from the Paris stagecoach.</p>

<p>He was the son of a mercer named Desfresnes, of the Rue St
Antoine, and he had lately inherited from his father a modest
fortune with which he was setting out upon his travels, proposing
upon a quite inadequate education to play in the world the
careless, glittering role of a man of fashion. With his cheap
finery he had put on the insolent airs which he had observed in men
of the class of which he aspired to be accounted a member.</p>

<p>There may have been a dozen patrons in the common-room of the
<i>Sucking Calf</i> when he swaggered in, calling, so as to be
heard by all, for the best supper, the best wine, the best room,
and the best of anything else the house could supply. In the hush
produced by his loud commands, Florimond turned to look him over
with an eye of increasing scorn. For Florimond, who, for a time at
least, had rubbed shoulders with members of the lesser nobility,
knew a gentleman when he saw one.</p>

<p>The day had been a lean one, the cards that evening were not
going well for him, and the moment's inattention caused by the
noisy advent of this pinchbeck gallant betrayed him into a
disadvantageous discard. It was enough to sour his humour.</p>

<p>The newcomer, who had announced his name of Desfresnes in such a
way as to make it sound like de Fresnes, conceived it in his rôle
that no pretty woman should be overlooked; and little Pâquotte of
the <i>Sucking Calf</i>, with her merry eyes, red lips, plump bosom
and tip-tilted nose, suddenly found the young gentleman's arm round
her waist and his finger under her chin.</p>

<p>"My dear, I vow to Heaven that you're too dainty a pullet for a
provincial inn. I profess to Heaven you'ld adorn the Palais Royal.
You'ld find your fortune there at Février's." With princely
condescension he added: "I vow to Heaven you shall wait on me,
little one." And in the best manner, as he supposed, of the Palais
Royal rake, he placed a kiss, which none could have described as
chaste, upon her fresh young lips.</p>

<p>Whether his spuriousness deceived her or not, and whatever may
have been her feelings, Pâquotte knew her duties too well to make a
fuss. With a laugh she slipped from his detaining arm, and moved
off to prepare a table. Monsieur Desfresnes was following when
Florimond's unkindly comment on a note of mimicry arrested him.</p>

<p>"I vow to Heaven we are to be edified by this canary. He talks
of the Palais Royal, of Février's. I vow to Heaven he will have
been a waiter there."</p>

<p>The words were bad enough, but carried to every corner of the
room by Florimond's thin, piercing voice they aroused a general
laugh.</p>

<p>Monsieur Desfresnes stood arrested by this brutal shattering of
his proud persuasion that he was dazzling these provincials. He
lost his head.</p>

<p>A dark flush on his lumpy countenance, he turned back to the
card-players' table. He wore a sword, and, leaning his hand upon
the hilt, he thrust it up behind him like the angry tail of a
roaring captain. And his tone matched the attitude in truculence.
He ransacked his wits for words that should sear and scorch. But,
failing to discover them in the little time at his disposal, he
contented himself with being haughtily direct.</p>

<p>"Did you talk at me, sir?"</p>

<p>Florimond put down his cards, and swung round on his chair. His
glance took in this haughty challenger, from the curls of his cheap
wig to the buckles (of gilded brass) on his shoes, and his thin
mouth tightened with malice.</p>

<p>"Now that I behold you better I perceive how little that was
worth while."</p>

<p>The intransigence of the phrase should have warned Desfresnes
that here was a man who, for all his slight build and the rusty
black of his garments, might be dangerous. But, like the fool he
was, he allowed himself to be swept forward by his gust of passion.
He slapped Florimond's face.</p>

<p>"Let that teach you to mend your manners."</p>

<p>Consternation was followed by hubbub.</p>

<p>Florimond knocked over his chair in his haste to rise, and his
three friends rose with him to restrain him. In what he did,
however, he was as restrained as he was deadly.</p>

<p>"The lesson calls, I think, for payment. Monsieur Fleury, do me
the honour to arrange a meeting for eight o'clock tomorrow morning
in the Pré-aux-Chêvres. The length of my blade is twenty-five
inches." He bowed with cold formality. "Not to embarrass you,
monsieur, I will withdraw."</p>

<p>He marched out stiff with dignity, leaving consternation in the
bosom of the Parisian who found himself so abruptly with a duel on
his hands. Reminding himself, however, that he had to deal with a
benighted provincial, for whom such elementary swordsmanship as he
possessed should be more than enough, Desfresnes recovered his
confidence, and sustained the ruffler's part.</p>

<p>"I vow to Heaven, sirs, that your friend is in a hurry to get
himself killed."</p>

<p>Florimond's three associates regarded him with disconcerting
pity. Then Fleury, the apothecary, answered him.</p>

<p>"If he doesn't kill you, sir, you will owe it either to his
kindness of heart or to his fear of the consequences. The law is
not lenient with a fencing-master, even when he has been
provoked."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>The three men sighed as one. Philibert shook his big head.</p>

<p>"Ah! You would not know, of course. A fatal ignorance, young
sir. The gentleman you have so unpardonably struck is Monsieur
Florimond Souverain de la Galette, master-at-arms of the King's
Academies."</p>

<p>Desfresnes suddenly felt that the dinner eaten at Epernay had
disagreed with him. He stared wide-eyed and pallid, the jauntiness
gone out of him like air from a pricked balloon.</p>

<p>"A fencing-master! But&mdash;Sacred-name!&mdash;one does not
fight a fencing-master!"</p>

<p>"It is not prudent," the lean wine-merchant agreed. "But then
neither is it prudent to slap a fencing-master's face."</p>

<p>Fleury, however, showed himself brisk and practical. "I trust,
sir, that you have a friend to make the necessary arrangements with
me?"</p>

<p>"But...but..." Monsieur Desfresnes broke down, and finally
demanded: "Where does he live, this Monsieur de la Galette?"</p>

<p>It was a boy from the inn who conducted him on foot to the
shabby house behind the Cathedral where Florimond had his being and
his academy.</p>

<p>Florimond's greeting was not encouraging. His scowl was
forbidding.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, this is most irregular."</p>

<p>Desfresnes stammered in a nervous flurry. "Mu...Monsieur, in
ordinary circumstances...But these circumstances are...quite
extraordinary. I did not know that you were a fencing-master."</p>

<p>"Ah! Indeed! I am to wear a placard on my breast, for the
warning of impertinent cockerels."</p>

<p>But no insult could inflame anew the young Parisian. "It is
impossible that I should meet you."</p>

<p>"Of course, if you prefer that I cane you in the streets..."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have come to apologize."</p>

<p>"Apologize?" Florimond laughed, and to Desfresnes it was the
most dreadful sound that he had ever heard. "But where do you come
from, then? From Egypt, or Persia, or perhaps China? For all that I
know, it may be possible in some of these places to slap a
gentleman's face and avoid the consequences by an apology. But in
France, monsieur, we arrange it differently, as you may have heard.
For even in the Palais Royal, even at Février's, these things are
understood."</p>

<p>The young man abased himself in intercessions. Florimond, with
no other end in view but completely to humble the upstart, did not
yet choose to be mollified.</p>

<p>"You fetched the blood to my cheek just now. I shall fetch yours
to your shirt in the morning. Then we shall be quits, and honour
will be satisfied."</p>

<p>Desfresnes was in despair. He thought of flight. But his baggage
was at the inn, which, moreover, was the post-house. Surreptitious
departure would be impossible. His wandering, fearful eyes observed
that the furniture of Florimond's room was shabby, that Florimond,
whilst spruce to the casual glance, was threadbare to a close
inspection. And so he came by the inspiration that was, in the
sequel, to make a rogue of Florimond.</p>

<p>"If I were to offer compensation for the injury, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Compensation?" Florimond's eye was terrible.</p>

<p>"You live by the sword. You give lessons for money. Why should
you not satisfy your honour by...by..." He halted foolishly.</p>

<p>"By what, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Desfresnes took a flying leap at his goal. "By ten louis."</p>

<p>"Leave my house, sir!" roared the incorruptible Florimond.</p>

<p>"Fifteen louis," gasped Desfresnes, putting up his hands as a
shield against the other's wrath.</p>

<p>But the fierceness had gone out of the fencing-master's eyes.
His lips twitched.</p>

<p>"Fifteen louis! Bah! Name of a name, it costs more than that to
smack my face, young sir."</p>

<p>"Twenty, then," cried Desfresnes more hopefully.</p>

<p>Florimond became suddenly thoughtful. He stroked his chin. Here
was a queer, unexpected shaping of events. Twenty louis was as much
as he now could earn in a year. For half the sum he would gladly
allow himself to be slapped on both cheeks and any other part of
his body that might tempt an assailant. He cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course, that in these matters there can be
no question of compensation. Honour is not for sale. But a fine,
now: that might be different. After all, I do not want your blood.
By a fine of, say, twenty louis, I might consider that I had
sufficiently mulcted your temerity. Yes, all things considered, I
think I might."</p>

<p>Desfresnes lost not an instant, lest Florimond should change his
mind. He whipped out a fat purse, bled himself and departed.</p>

<p>And from that hour Florimond was a changed man.</p>

<p>An unsuspected source of easy profit had suddenly revealed
itself. It was the open door that tempts even the saint. Florimond
strangled a conscience that had never been robust, and crossed the
threshold.</p>

<p>Twice, in the month that followed, he gave such provocation to
travellers resting at the <i>Sucking Calf</i> that on each occasion
a challenge resulted. True, the meetings provoked never followed.
If Florimond, hitherto so gentle and unobtrusive, had suddenly, to
the dismay of his three card-playing friends, become truculent and
aggressive, at least, to their consolation, he was always to be
mollified by a visit from his intended opponent. Commonly the visit
was suggested by Fleury. Of the nature of the mollification which
Florimond exacted, his honest friends had no suspicion. From the
fact that he now spent money more freely, they simply assumed that
the affairs of his academy were improving. Nor did these good, dull
men draw any inference from the circumstance that his clothes
assumed a character of extreme bourgeois simplicity, and that he
abandoned the weaning of a sword, which, in the past, had been an
integral part of his apparel.</p>

<p>Their suspicions might have been aroused if Florimond's victims
had walked less readily into his snares. Shrewd in his judgment of
likely subjects, he spread his net only for the obviously
self-sufficient numskull, and he never forced the pace, always
leaving it for the victim to commit the extreme provocation.</p>

<p>Subjects such as these were, after all, by no means common. It
is certain that at no time did the average run higher than one a
fortnight, and with this, Florimond was at first abundantly
content. Greed, however, increasing with prosperity, and fostered
by the ease with which it could be satisfied, he grew less
cautious.</p>

<p>Yet all went smoothly for him until one Autumn evening, when a
moon-faced, quiet-mannered man in the plainest of tie-wigs, his
sober brown suit almost suggesting a plain livery, descended from a
post-chaise at the <i>Sucking Calf</i>, and mildly ordered himself
supper, a bottle of wine and a bed for the night.</p>

<p>From his table in the usual corner Florimond observed him
narrowly, and judged him a timid simpleton of the merchant class,
yet a man of substance, since he travelled in a chaise and not by
the stage. He was an ideal victim, save that his unobtrusiveness
opened no avenue of approach.</p>

<p>Demure and self-effacing, he ate his supper, and Florimond began
to fear that at any moment now he might call for his candle, and so
escape. Some departure from ordinary tactics became necessary.</p>

<p>Florimond loaded a pipe, rose and crossed the room to the fire,
in quest of a light.</p>

<p>The stranger, having supped, had slewed his chair round and was
sitting at his ease, a little unbuttoned and somnolent, his legs
stretched before him. Florimond trod upon the fellow's foot; after
that he stood glaring into the moon-face that was raised in a
plaintive stare. Thus for a long moment. Then: "I am waiting,
monsieur," said Florimond.</p>

<p>"Faith! So am I!" said Moon-face. "You trod on my foot,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"Let it teach you not to sprawl as if the inn belonged to
you."</p>

<p>The man sat up. "There was plenty of room to pass, monsieur," he
protested, but so mildly plaintive as merely to advertise his
timidity.</p>

<p>Florimond had recourse to stronger measures. "You are, it seems,
not only a clumsy lout, but also a mannerless one. I might have
pitched into the fire, yet you have not even the grace to offer
your excuses."</p>

<p>"You...you are amazingly uncivil," the other remonstrated.</p>

<p>The round face grew pink, and a wrinkle appeared at the base of
the nose.</p>

<p>"If you don't like my tone, you have your remedy, monsieur,"
snapped Florimond.</p>

<p>Rounder grew the eyes in that bland countenance. "I wonder if
you are deliberately seeking to provoke me."</p>

<p>Florimond laughed. "Should I waste my time? I know a poltroon
when I see one."</p>

<p>"Now that really is going too far." The stranger was obviously
and deeply perturbed. "Oh, yes. Much too far. I do not think I
could be expected to suffer that." He rose from his chair at last,
and called across to a group at a neighbouring table. "You there,
messieurs! I take you to witness of the gross provocation I have
received from this ill-mannered bully, and..."</p>

<p>Florimond's piercing voice interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Must I box your ears before you will cease your insults?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, monsieur. So much will not be necessary." He sighed
mournfully, in a reluctance almost comical. "If you will send a
friend to me we will settle the details."</p>

<p>It came so unexpectedly that, for a moment, Florimond was almost
out of countenance. Then he brought his heels together, bowed
stiffly from the waist, and stalked off to request of Fleury the
usual service. After that, pursuing the tactics long since
perfected for these occasions, he departed from the inn. As the
unvarying routine of the matter had taught him to expect, it was
not long before he was followed. Himself, as usual, he opened to
the knock, and with his usual air of indignant surprise admitted
the moon-faced gentleman. As usual the victim displayed all the
signs of distress proper to these occasions. His nervousness made
him falter and stammer.</p>

<p>"Mu...Monsieur, I realize that this is most irregular. Bu...but
the fact is...I realize that I have been too hasty. It is necessary
that I should explain that...that a meeting between us is, after
all, quite...quite impossible."</p>

<p>He paused there, prematurely as it seemed, and as if fascinated
by the wicked smile that was laying bare the swordsman's dog-tooth.
Into that pause came the sarcastic answer that had done duty on
every occasion since Desfresnes': "Ah! I am to wear a placard on my
breast, so as to warn the impertinent that I am a
fencing-master."</p>

<p>But the phrase which hitherto had proved so disconcerting proved
now the very opposite. The stranger's expression completely
changed. It became so quickened by surprise and relief that it
entirely lost its foolish vacuity.</p>

<p>"A fencing-master! You are a fencing-master? Oh, but that makes
a great difference." The enlivened glance swept round the room,
observed its bareness, the lines chalked on the floor, the trophies
of foils, plastrons and masks adorning the walls. The man drew
himself up. His figure seemed to acquire an access of virility. He
actually smiled. "And this, of course, is your school. I see. I
see. In that case everything arranges itself."</p>

<p>Heels together, he bowed with the proper stiffness. "Forgive the
needless intrusion. We meet, then, at eight o'clock in the
Pré-aux-Chêvres." He turned to depart.</p>

<p>For the first time in one of these affairs it was Florimond who
was disconcerted. He set a detaining hand upon the other's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"A moment, Monsieur le mystérieux. What the devil do you mean by
'everything arranges itself'?"</p>

<p>"Just that." The eyes in the moon-face twinkled with
amusement.</p>

<p>"For me, as for you, monsieur, a duel with an ordinary civilian
would be a serious matter. If there should be an accident the
consequences might be grave. You see, I am, myself, a
fencing-master. But since you are of the fraternity there are no
grounds whatever for my apprehensions."</p>

<p>A sensation of cold began to creep up Florimond's spine. As a
swordsman he knew that whilst among asses he might be a lion, among
lions he was certainly an ass. He looked more closely at this
stranger in whom he had been so mistaken; he looked beyond the
round placidity of that pallid countenance, and observed that the
man was moderately tall, well-knit, of a good length of arm and an
exceptionally well-turned leg.</p>

<p>"You are, yourself, a fencing-master?" he echoed, and his stare
was foolish.</p>

<p>"Even of some little celebrity," was the answer in a tone of
mild deprecation. "My name is Danet."</p>

<p>"Danet?" Florimond's voice cracked on the name. "Not...not
Guillaume Danet?"</p>

<p>Again the stranger bowed, that stiff bow from the waist so
suggestive of the swordsman. "The same. Very much at your service.
I see that you have heard of me. You may even have read my little
treatise. It has made some noise in the world. Until tomorrow,
then, at eight o'clock, my dear confrère."</p>

<p>"But...a moment, mon maître!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" The other paused, his eyebrows raised.</p>

<p>"I...I did not know..."</p>

<p>He heard his own phrase cast in his teeth.</p>

<p>"Am I to wear the name Guillaume Danet on a placard on my breast
as a warning to impertinent little provincial fencing-masters?"</p>

<p>"But to meet you, mon maître...It is not possible. You cannot
wish it. It would be my ruin."</p>

<p>"That will not matter since you will probably not survive
it."</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, pallid, Florimond stared at this opponent, the very
mildness of whose aspect had now become so terrible. Already he had
the sensation of a foot or so of cold steel in his vitals. "I will
apo... pologize, mon maître."</p>

<p>"Apologize! What poltroonery! You provoke, wantonly you insult
the man you suppose to be incapable of defending himself, and you
imagine that an apology in private and in secret will adjust the
matter. You are caught in your own trap, I think. You had better be
making your soul, Monsieur de la Galette. Good night!"</p>

<p>"Wait! Ah, wait! If now...if I were to compensate you..."</p>

<p>"Compensate me? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"If twenty-five louis..."</p>

<p>"You miserable cut-throat, do you dare to offer me money? Not
for fifty louis would I forgo the satisfaction of dealing with you
as you deserve. To bleed you of a hundred louis might perhaps be to
punish you enough. But..."</p>

<p>"I will pay it! Master, I will pay it!" Frantically, Florimond
made an offer that would beggar him of almost every louis wrung
from the victims of his dishonest practices.</p>

<p>Round grew the eyes and the mouth in the round face that
confronted him. "A hundred louis!" The great master's tone reminded
Florimond that every man has his price. Slowly Monsieur Danet
seemed to resolve. Slowly, with a shrug of the shoulders, he spoke.
"After all, why not? The object, when all is said, is to punish
your temerity. Since you are penitent, to kill you, or even to maim
you, might be too much. I am a man of heart, I hope. It is not in
my nature to be inclement. I will take your hundred louis, and
bestow them on the poor of Paris."</p>

<p>It was of no consolation to Florimond to assure himself that the
poor of Paris would never see a sou of the money. With a heart of
lead he counted out his hoard, and found to his dismay that
ninety-eight louis was his total fortune. But now the great Danet
showed himself not only clement, but magnanimous. Far from exacting
the last obol, he actually left Florimond three louis for his
immediate needs.</p>

<p>You conceive, however, that this generosity did not mitigate the
fencing-master's bitter chagrin to see the fruits of months of
crafty labour swept away. The only solace he found for his
mortification was the reflection that what he had done once he
could do again. There would be no lack of pigeons still to be
plucked. In future, however, he must proceed with greater caution
and not trust too readily to a mild and simple exterior.</p>

<p>So, putting a brave face on the matter, he resumed his habits,
and each evening at the <i>Sucking Calf</i> he sat like a spider in
its web, waiting for the unwary fly to blunder in.</p>

<p>They were on the threshold of winter, a season of diminished
travelling, and for the best part of a fortnight Florimond's
vigilance went unrewarded. Then one evening a traveller arrived,
whose entrance was like a gust of wind, whose voice, summoning the
landlord, was sharp with authority.</p>

<p>The vintner bustled forward, and Florimond could scarcely
believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Landlord, I am seeking here in Rheims a rascally
fencing-master, who is a disgrace to his calling, and who goes by
the flamboyant name of Florimond Souverain de la Galette. Can you
tell me at what address he may be found?"</p>

<p>It was Florimond, himself, who answered.</p>

<p>With the feeling that the gods were casting a timely gift into
his very lap, he sprang from his chair. He seemed to spin round in
the act of leaping, and landed, heels together, in a rectangle
before the inquirer.</p>

<p>"He is here."</p>

<p>He was confronted by a tall, lithe gentleman elegantly dressed
in black, who regarded him sternly out of an aquiline countenance.
A cold stern voice rang upon the awed stillness of the room.</p>

<p>"You are that scoundrel, are you?"</p>

<p>At least a dozen pairs of eyes were turned in pity upon this
rash stranger who came thus to skewer himself, as it were, upon the
fencing-master's sword. A dozen pairs of ears listened attentively
to his further words.</p>

<p>"Another in my place might account himself your debtor. For I
have to thank you for four pupils who have sought me in the course
of the past two months. Each of them had been craftily entangled by
you in a quarrel, so identical in detail as to betray its
calculated nature. Each of them, so as to keep a whole skin, paid
you in blackmail either ten or fifteen louis. Before the last of
them came to me for fencing lessons I had already begun to
understand the rascal trade you are driving. I have since assured
myself of it, and for the honour of the profession of arms, of
which I am a jealous guardian, I account it my duty to put an end
to it."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the now livid Florimond.</p>

<p>"You have the right to know. I am Guillaume Danet,
master-at-arms of the King's Academies."</p>

<p>"You? You, Guillaume Danet?" Goggle-eyed, Florimond regarded
him; and then his glance was drawn beyond this tall stranger to a
man who entered at that moment, carrying a valise: a man in sober
brown that looked like a plain livery; a man with a round, bland,
pallid moon-face, hatefully well known to Florimond.</p>

<p>"Then who the devil may that be?"</p>

<p>The stranger looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That? That is my valet. The man I sent here a couple of weeks
ago, to verify my conclusions about you."</p>

<p>And then this poor, rascally Florimond committed his worst
blunder. Like all rogues, judging the world to be peopled by rogues
having kindred aims, he uttered a snarling laugh.</p>

<p>"He did more than that. He anticipated you. You are behind the
fair, Monsieur Danet."</p>

<p>"Behind the fair?"</p>

<p>"That scoundrel had a hundred louis from me. I have nothing
left."</p>

<p>"I see. He played your own game, did he? And you do me the
honour to suppose me equally base?"</p>

<p>He laughed, not pleasantly. He raised his cane, and for months
thereafter they told the tale in Rheims of the caning administered
by the great Danet to Florimond Souverain de la Galette, a caning
which made an end of his career as a master-at-arms, at least in
that part of France.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. THE LORD OF TIME</h2>

<p>IT was Cagliostro's queer arresting gesture before the crucifix
in the great square that supplied the decisive spur to the wishes
of the Cardinal-Prince Louis de Rohan.</p>

<p>From the moment of his entrance into Strasbourg, in his gilded
rococo coach, drawn by six cream-coloured ponies, Count Cagliostro
had been the focus of attention in the town, even before he had
afforded evidence of his miraculous powers.</p>

<p>Without fee or guerdon he cured diseases which ordinary doctors
had pronounced beyond human relief. As a result, and very soon, the
house in which he lodged was besieged from early morning to late
evening by the crowds that thronged to implore his aid or to
gratify in some degree the extraordinary curiosity he excited. The
fame of him ran, like a ripple over water, through Alsace. His
power to expel disease was accounted superhuman and was almost the
least of the superhuman attributes discovered in him. He was
credited with possessing the secret of the fixation of mercury and
the transmutation of metals; precious stones composed themselves
under his hands from the commonest elements; he could restore youth
to the aged, and he was actually master of an elixir of life
itself; he possessed gifts of prophecy and clairvoyance, and he
could read thoughts as easily as another might detect the signs of
emotion on a countenance; to such extraordinary lengths did he
carry the art with which Mesmer had lately astonished the world
that he was said to have the power of controlling the very souls of
men, and that he rendered manifest how far was Mesmer from
understanding the application of those forces upon the wells of
which he had more or less accidentally blundered. In short, this
Count Cagliostro, coming no man knew whence, was being pronounced
divine.</p>

<p>That great aristocrat, that noble Maecenas, the Cardinal-Prince
de Rohan, who was more royal than the King, for in his veins ran
the blood of every house that had ever given kings to France, heard
of these marvels, and was moved to desire a nearer acquaintance
with them. All his life a passionate student of alchemy, botany,
astrology and the occult in general, the Cardinal brought to the
study of the supernatural the open-mindedness of a credulous
person. It seemed to him that if Cagliostro were indeed sincere,
and not merely a charlatan, like so many in France just then, he
might bring to real fruition pursuits which His Eminence had
hitherto found vexatiously elusive in results. And then came the
report of those queer words in the square to quicken this
desire.</p>

<p>Count Cagliostro had gone forth one evening to take the air,
followed at a respectful distance by his servant, the slight, dark,
pallid fellow who bore the curious name of Abdon. The Count's
appearance was that of a man in the prime of life, between thirty
and forty. Of middle height, his frame was thick-set and vigorous,
and he carried his big coarsely handsome head with an air of
majesty on his powerful neck. He was dressed with an ostentation
that in itself took the eye. His blue silk coat was laced in gold
along the seams, with the sword worn through the pocket; his
red-heeled shoes were fastened with buckles of precious stones;
brilliants flashed in the billows of lace at his throat; rubies
attached his solitaire and glowed in the buckle that held the white
plumes in his hat <i>à la mousquetaire</i>. It has been testified
by practically all who knew him, and who have left records, that
few could support the direct gaze of his full, bold, dark, uncanny
eyes.</p>

<p>As he walked, men turned to observe and to follow him, until an
inquisitive crowd had formed at a respectful distance in his wake.
This was customary. Just as it was customary for him, aloof and
absorbed, to appear unconscious of the attention he was
attracting.</p>

<p>And then at last he came to pause before the crucifix in its
open shrine. Leaning upon the jewelled head of his ebony cane, he
stood for some moments in thoughtful, wistful contemplation.</p>

<p>"Strange, Abdon," he said at last, over his shoulder, to his
servant, "that one who can never have seen Him should so faithfully
reproduce His lineaments." There was an implication here that sent
a thrill of awe through the attendant, but respectfully silent,
crowd. Then, after a long pause, Cagliostro sighed and spoke again.
"Do you remember that evening in Jerusalem when they crucified
Him?"</p>

<p>The spectators caught their breath, then held it so as not to
miss the answer. Abdon, bowing low with something of the Orient in
his manner, replied quietly but distinctly: "You forget, Master,
that I have been with you only fifteen hundred years."</p>

<p>"Ah, true," said the Count. "I was forgetting. But with so many
centuries to remember..." He left the sentence there, shrugged, and
sauntered on.</p>

<p>A report of this left the Cardinal-Prince wondering whether this
man of marvels was indeed divine or merely the most impudent
charlatan that had ever walked the earth. His Eminence, considering
it incumbent upon him to resolve the question, sent a gentleman of
his following, the Baron de Planta, to command Cagliostro to wait
upon him at the Château de Saverne, where His Eminence had his
seat.</p>

<p>Cagliostro's reception of the command reflected his lofty
disdain of the mighty of this world.</p>

<p>"If the Cardinal is ill let him come to me, and I will cure him.
If he is well he has no need of me, nor I of him."</p>

<p>That anyone should send such a message to the Cardinal-Prince
implied to the Baron de Planta that the end of the world was at
hand. And this was confirmed by the manner in which the matchlessly
urbane and gracious Cardinal received it.</p>

<p>"Sublime reply, whatever the man may be," was the liberal
opinion he expressed.</p>

<p>Louis de Rohan was approaching fifty at the time, but his tall
figure still preserved the grace of youth as did his countenance,
which, reflecting his mind, was handsome in a rather infantile way;
it was so smooth of contours, and so free from lines, that his
ashen hair seemed prematurely faded.</p>

<p>Accustomed from earliest youth to sycophancy, the proud
independence of Count Cagliostro drew this great prince, temporal
and spiritual, to seek the man of marvels at his lodging in
Strasbourg, like the humblest suitor. There, attended only by de
Planta, he waited without resentment in the thronged ante-chamber
to take his turn, as was imposed by one who made a parade of
awarding no precedence to rank.</p>

<p>What reservations the Cardinal's ingenuous mind still harboured
on the subject of Count Cagliostro's claims were dispelled almost
as soon as he came to stand in the Count's presence. Under the
hypnotic gaze of the man's singular eyes, dark and lustrous and of
a penetration that seemed unearthly, His Eminence experienced such
a sense of awe that his own glance fell abashed. But when he had
accepted the proffered chair a mild resentment stirred in him that
he, who had borne as an equal the gaze of kings, should have
suffered himself so easily to be stared down. Determinedly he
raised his eyes again, and compelled himself to meet and hold the
other's glance. Soon, however, whilst Cagliostro, who remained
standing before him, talked in a deep vibrant voice and in a
language that was only just perceptibly French, the Cardinal became
aware that it was not himself but the Count who was exercising this
compulsion: that it was his own glance that was being held, and
that he was powerless to withdraw it from those glittering orbs
that seemed presently to wax and wane as he watched them in a
helpless fascination. Rohan began to be pervaded by a sense of his
own unreality; it was as if all power of will and of self-assertion
had gone out of him. His senses were being further lulled into
subjection by the rise and fall in rhythmical hypnotic cadences of
the voice addressing him in that curious Italianate French.</p>

<p>"Now that I behold you I perceive the source of your
persistence, Monseigneur. We have met before."</p>

<p>To this the bewildered Cardinal, after a faltering search in his
memory, made answer: "I don't remember."</p>

<p>"How should you? Between this and that stand for you the walls
of a dozen deaths, a dozen re-births. The soul-memory deep within
you is choked and smothered by the ponderous strata of all the
flesh it has since worn, with the lusts, the passions, the sins and
aspirations that belong to each. It was sixteen centuries ago in
Antioch. You were a Roman proconsul, and I was, mutatis mutandis,
much as I am now, a wanderer upon the face of the earth, a
traveller down the ages."</p>

<p>Even in the befogged state of his senses this was more than His
Eminence could be expected to digest. Indeed, indignation at the
impudent affront to his intelligence aroused combativeness.</p>

<p>"You will have evidence of this?" he said, in quiet mockery.</p>

<p>"Evidence!" boomed the sonorous voice. "What is evidence? The
thing seen. And what shall be seen of the eternal verities by poor
human vision, as narrowly restricted to the immediate environment
as is that of the blind earthworm to the soil in which it burrows?
Can the earthworm see the stars? How, then, help him if he asks for
evidence of their existence? And how help man if he asks for
evidence of what lies beyond them?"</p>

<p>Despite himself the Cardinal must admit that there was
theological authority for these implications.</p>

<p>"And yet," the mystagogue continued, "since you ask for it, some
evidence I shall hope to give you before all is said. So condescend
to hear me out.</p>

<p>"You were drawn to me in those far-off days as you are drawn
now, which is to say that you were inquisitive about me;
inquisitive and mistrustful. Then your Roman arrogance, your Roman
scepticism, obfuscated your understanding. You supposed me an
impostor, a vain seducer, even as remains of arrogance and
scepticism, heritage of those Roman days&mdash;a heritage which has
cursed and warped your every incarnation&mdash;still afflict you
now. It is so, Monsiegneur. Do not interrupt me.</p>

<p>"In those days I was your friend. I realized the greatness
latent in your soul, a soul so closely in tune with mine; and I
sought to deliver it from its dull chrysalis of carnal pride, to
set it free to soar in the empyrean, and from those calm altitudes
to survey eternity. I would have made you lord of Life and Time,
you who then, as now, were but the ephemeral lord of a fleshly
envelope. I would have spread before you the Fruits of the Tree of
Life and rendered you everlasting as myself. But stubborn and
obstinate in your puny pride you mocked; and so I left you to your
poor carnal limitations, and went my ways."</p>

<p>And here the Cardinal, deathly pallid, and with eyes that still
stared but were now dull and vacant, contrived at last to interrupt
him.</p>

<p>It required a supreme effort to break through the web that was
being spun about his wits, to conquer a difficulty of articulation
such as will trammel a man in dreams. But he conceived that he had
received illumination, and at all costs he must voice it.</p>

<p>"I know you now," he cried. "You are the Wandering Jew, the
accursed cobbler of Jerusalem who spat upon Our Lord, and is doomed
to walk the earth until He comes again."</p>

<p>A smile swept like a shadow across the Olympian calm of
Cagliostro's countenance. Sorrowfully the great, compelling eyes
considered the prelate.</p>

<p>"How history repeats itself! So you said then, sixteen hundred
years ago. When your wits were baffled by proof of my unaccountable
longevity, they took refuge from the intolerable truth, in the only
explanation legend offered you. But you are wrong now as you were
wrong then. I am not the Wandering Jew. I am older than
Cartaphilus, older than Jerusalem, where I was with Solomon at the
building of the Temple. And I shall survive them both. For I have
eaten of the Tree of Life. My elixir vitae is distilled from its
fruits. To me, existence is not as a string of beads; a succession
of brief moments of consciousness in eternity; fleeting,
uncomprehended glimpses of the world. To me, existence is a
continuous stream, visible from its source to the limitless ocean
of eternity into which it flows. For me, this illusion men call
Time has no reality. For I am He Who Is."</p>

<p>On those last five words his vibrant, metallic voice had swelled
to a trumpet-note. Thence it fell again at once to its quieter
level.</p>

<p>"Yet that you tell me again, as you told me sixteen centuries
ago in Antioch, that I am Cartaphilus, proves that I have touched
in you at least a chord of that soul-memory which survives deep
down in each of us. What you have remembered is what you called me
once before. Let me now help your poor human weakness. Look into
this mirror and endeavour to see what once you were when last I was
beside you."</p>

<p>Leaning his elbow on the table beside the Cardinal, Cagliostro
extended his left hand, which was gloved in black velvet. Cupped in
the palm of it he displayed a crystal sphere something less in
circumference than a tennis-ball.</p>

<p>So dominated by now that, in obeying, he experienced no sense of
derogating, Rohan directed his gaze as he was bidden. For some
moments he stared into the empty depths of the crystal. Suddenly he
moved and caught his breath. He leaned forward, peering.</p>

<p>"I see. I see," he murmured thickly. "I see men; a multitude; an
arena; a pillared marble tribune."</p>

<p>"Centre your gaze upon that tribune," Cagliostro commanded.
"What do you find there?"</p>

<p>"A man of medium height and powerful frame, boldly featured,
with eyes that burn their way into one's brain. He is in white; a
snowy chlamys edged with gold. I know his face. Ah! It is
yourself."</p>

<p>"And the man in the chair? Look at him: the man who sits elbow
on knee and chin on fist, with a proud sad face that is wreathed in
weariness and disdain? Can you name him?"</p>

<p>The Cardinal bent closer still; he hesitated; he was breathing
heavily. "Can it be myself?"</p>

<p>The gloved hand closed upon the crystal and was swiftly
withdrawn. Cagliostro drew himself erect, and his voice rang hard.
"Yourself. Marcus Vinicius, as you then were named."</p>

<p>The abruptness of movement and tone seemed to shatter a spell.
Rohan sat up, restored to a normal alertness. The colour crept back
into his cheeks. He passed a hand, long and slim, and delicate as a
woman's, across eyes and brow.</p>

<p>"You are master of strange secrets, sir," he said slowly and
gravely. Then he added a complaint. "My senses are a little dazed,
I think."</p>

<p>"That will pass." Cagliostro spoke harshly, and waved a hand
contemptuously. "No man may look down the ages and hope to escape
vertigo. It will pass. What I have discovered to you, however,
remains. So that you have faith, you may now prevail where you
failed before. To help you I am here; for your soul is now of a
strength to bear the secrets I could impart to you, to employ the
power which must never be bestowed unworthily. I am at your
service, Prince Louis. And my coming is timely, if only so that I
may restore your fortune so sadly sapped by the Prince de
Guémenée."</p>

<p>The Cardinal was startled. "You know that?"</p>

<p>Again Cagliostro waved a hand. He was prodigal of gesture. "Does
not all the world know it?" he asked, like a man scorning to make a
mystery of the possession of knowledge reached by ordinary
channels.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, common knowledge how much of his fortune Louis
de Rohan had sacrificed to buttress the honour of his family which
had been so sadly imperilled by the bankruptcy of his nephew the
Prince de Guérnenée. Vast though his wealth might be, it could
scarcely bear the strain of some thirty millions which that
bankruptcy was imposing upon it. With deeply rooted habits of
prodigal expenditure in the maintenance of his more than princely
establishment, without knowledge of economy, a knowledge which his
munificent spirit scorned to acquire, the Cardinal-Prince was
sweeping towards the edge of financial difficulties.</p>

<p>He was not, however, at present concerned with this. His
thoughts were consumed in the endeavour to extricate the present
startling experience from the fog, as of a dream, that seemed to
enshroud it.</p>

<p>"It is all strange," he murmured. "So very strange! Incredible!
And yet something within me seems to compel belief."</p>

<p>"Now God be thanked that you are at last given grace to conquer
the obstinacy of material scepticism. You yield at last to the
instinctive knowledge of reincarnation deep in each of us: the
oldest and strongest of human beliefs, persistent in spite of
temporary occlusions; a belief that is at war with no creed that
ever was."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is true," the Cardinal agreed, with the
eagerness of one who persuades himself. "There is no heresy in that
belief. It can be reconciled. No heresy that I can perceive."</p>

<p>"There is none," said Cagliostro, as one speaking with full
authority. "We will return to that. Meanwhile, there are Your
Eminence's pressing needs." His tone blended condescension with
command.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes." The Cardinal's will&mdash;never, it must be admitted,
of the strongest&mdash;continued in suspension, a thing that veered
as Cagliostro blew upon it. He smiled wanly. "My nephew's affairs
are absorbing millions."</p>

<p>Cagliostro, erect, dominant, his great head thrown back, made a
wide gesture of effacement. "Dismiss your anxieties. I have been
stigmatized a magician, and persecuted as a warlock, by the
ignorance of men. But, as you will come to perceive, I practise no
magic that is not the natural magic of knowledge, the application
of the hidden forces of nature, the fruits of study and of long
centuries of experience. Among the secrets I have mastered,
building upon what I learnt in ancient Egypt from the priests of
Isis, who already had glimmerings of these sciences, three are
pre-eminent: the elixir of life, the Philosopher's Stone with its
power of transmuting metals, and the gift of healing all ills to
which the flesh is subject. The last I hold at the disposal of
suffering mankind; the second I place at the service of those whom
I can trust not to abuse the power that gold bestows; the first I
guard most jealously from all save the few&mdash;the very
few&mdash;who, under the most rigorous tests, give proof that the
indefinite prolongation of their lives will be for the benefit of
humanity.</p>

<p>"When I shall have relieved your most urgent need, as I so
easily can, and when, thereby, I shall have increased your faith in
me, we may, if you so incline, turn our attention to matters of
real and abiding weight."</p>

<p>There was much more of the same kind before they parted on that
fateful day. It followed from it that Count Cagliostro presently
transferred himself from his Strasbourg lodging to be an honoured
guest at the Cardinal-Prince's imposing Château de Saverne. There,
by the orders of a bemused prelate at once attracted and repelled,
who knew not what to believe, a laboratory was prepared for him.
And there, one day, a month later, he set a crown to the empire he
was obtaining over Louis de Rohan by demonstrating that his claim
to transmute base metal into gold was no mountebank's boast. From
the crucible set up in that laboratory he withdrew an ingot of pure
gold of the value of five thousand livres, which under the
Cardinal's eyes he had transmuted out of lead. He presented it to
his noble host, as a mere earnest of all that was to come, with as
light and casual a manner as if he were handing him a leaf plucked
from a tree in passing.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of more, however, there were certain
ingredients that Cagliostro lacked, and so as to come within reach
of these he proposed to his noble patron that they should transfer
themselves to Paris, to the Hôtel de Rohan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, pending this removal, his apartments at the Château
de Saverne were daily becoming more and more thronged by all that
was noble, wealthy and fashionable in Alsace, attracted by his fame
as a healer and a man of marvels, a fame which rippled thence in
ever-widening circles over the face of France, and set Paris itself
agog in expectation of his advent.</p>

<p>Arrogant, domineering, impatient even, he would move through the
press of distinguished suitors, his great head thrown back, his
terrible, uncanny eyes at once dazzling and awing those upon whom
he fixed them. Waving his short, powerful, jewelled hands in
fantastic gestures, he chattered constantly in that queer, inflated
jargon of his that was compounded of Italian, Italianate French and
scraps of Spanish, a sort of lingua franca that would have been
more or less understood in any country where a Romance language was
spoken. He was abrupt and harsh of speech and manner, observing few
of the amenities that obtained in the polite world which now paid
court to him. But as a healer his success was manifest; and not
only with malingerers and hypochondriacs, but also with the
genuinely afflicted. Sometimes he would display his powers of
reading the secrets of a man's soul, and sometimes he would even
foretell a future event.</p>

<p>Very soon the respect commanded for him by the aegis of the
Cardinal-Prince was converted by the clear magnitude of his own
arts into reverence and even worship. No enemy troubled the
serenity of his days until suddenly the Prince de Guémenée, the man
whose dishonest extravagances had rendered Cagliostro's services so
timely to the Cardinal, came gliding like a malevolent snake into
this Eden.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée was a hard-bitten man of the world,
regarding the Hereafter with a good deal of mistrust, and of the
Present accepting no more than those material parts of whose
reality his senses enabled him to test the evidences. The
charlatanism and quackery which in that disjointed period of
transition were rampant in France moved him to contempt. That his
uncle, the uncle upon whom he was depending for his existence,
should be falling a prey to one of these empirics&mdash;for that
was Monsieur de Guémenée's view of Count Cagliostro&mdash;aroused
in him the remorseless anger that is born of selfish fear.</p>

<p>He descended suddenly upon the Château de Saverne with intent to
disillusion the Cardinal and send the warlock packing. Armed with
something besides indignation and commonsense, he never doubted
that he should accomplish his object.</p>

<p>He arrived in the dusk of a September day, and, being bidden to
supper so soon as he had changed from his travelling-clothes, he
must curb until afterwards his agnostic impatience.</p>

<p>It was not necessary that Cagliostro should be pointed out to
him among the considerable company at the open table kept by the
munificent Cardinal. The man's dominant air and magnetic
personality made him sufficiently conspicuous. Although
overdressed&mdash;his black satin coat was excessively gold-laced,
and he wore with it a red waistcoat&mdash;and over-jewelled, and
although his table manners left much to be desired, yet he escaped
being ridiculous or even vulgar by the majestic assurance of his
demeanour.</p>

<p>Observing the spell which the man appeared to cast upon those
about him, meeting once or twice and finding himself unable to
support the glance of those singularly uncanny eyes, Monsieur de
Guémenée began to apprehend that the battle ahead might sternly
test his strength.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he engaged it intrepidly with his uncle in the
magnificent pillared library whither the Cardinal conducted him
after supper.</p>

<p>His Eminence took a seat at his ormolu-encrusted writing-table,
whilst his nephew faced him from a tall armchair upholstered in red
velvet on which was embroidered an R surmounted by a coronet.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée was approaching thirty. Like his uncle he
was tall and slender, and he bore also in his countenance a strong
resemblance to the Cardinal, but lacked the Cardinal's gentle
candid air. He sat back, crossed his legs, and plunged straight
into the matter.</p>

<p>"I have come, monseigneur, to talk to you about this man who
calls himself Count Cagliostro."</p>

<p>His Eminence, of imperturbable urbanity, looked mildly at his
nephew.</p>

<p>"How should you prefer to call him, Charles?"</p>

<p>"An impudent impostor," was the downright answer. "A common
swindler; a quacksalver whose proper place is on the Pont Neuf; a
charlatan who makes a victim of Your Eminence. What his real name
may be I have not yet ascertained."</p>

<p>The handsome Cardinal betrayed no annoyance. But there was some
sorrow in his glance. "I could bear with a good grace to be such a
victim as Count Cagliostro makes me. I can bear it thankfully even;
and so, my dear Charles, should you, considering how much we are
likely to owe to him."</p>

<p>"Ah! And how much is he likely to owe to you by the time he has
invaded Paris, as I hear is the intention, under your exalted
sponsorship; by the time you have presented him at Court and set
him on the way to swindle all the people of our world?"</p>

<p>"You are vulgar and commonplace in your views, Charles. God
commiserate me that I should discover it in a man of my own
blood."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée leaned forward. "Monseigneur I have been
looking into this man's history."</p>

<p>"In that case, my dear Charles, perhaps I can add something to
the information you already possess. Look at this ring." He held
out a fine white hand on the middle finger of which gleamed a
magnificent brilliant carved with the Rohan arms. "That is a gift
from Count Cagliostro. And not only a gift, an evidence of his
powers. It is a creation of his own. In the laboratory above stairs
I, myself, saw it taken from the crucible in which it was fused by
him."</p>

<p>"Jugglery!" scoffed Monsieur de Guémenée. "Common jugglery. If
he can do that, what need to live upon you?"</p>

<p>"He does not live upon me. Here it is he, not I, who is the
benefactor. And what of the cures he daily makes upon all-comers,
sometimes of maladies accounted mortal? Is that jugglery? And all
is done freely, without recompense, for the love of humanity. Is
that the way of an impostor, a quacksalver? And then the alms he
distributes, the gold he makes. Jugglery? A stupidity of the
malicious. For if he is indeed a juggler, he must be the richest
juggler that ever lived. Whence does he derive his wealth,
Charles?"</p>

<p>His Eminence set the question with the air of a man delivering
checkmate. But Monsieur de Guémenée had an answer ready.</p>

<p>"I can enlighten Your Eminence upon that, for I have been at
pains to inform myself. He derives it from the lodges of so-called
Egyptian freemasonry which he has been founding in France and
elsewhere; he derives it from the sensation-seeking gulls whom he
initiates into these clap-trap mysteries and from whom the
Grand-Copht, as he calls himself, demands rich fees for his
impostures."</p>

<p>The Cardinal stiffened and sat bolt upright, unable, despite his
deep-seated amiability, to restrain resentment.</p>

<p>"If you come to me merely as a retailer of vulgar scandal, of
almost blasphemous calumny, I will not listen to you further."</p>

<p>"A moment's patience, monseigneur. There is something else;
something you may easily investigate for yourself, and not so
easily dismiss. If you will condescend to hear me, I
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then the double-doors were thrown open by a lackey, who
entered, ranged himself aside and announced:</p>

<p>"His Excellency Count Cagliostro."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée sank back into his chair with a movement of
petulance as the man of marvels came into view. He made a
deliberate entrance, grave and masterful, from the carriage of his
head to the manner in which he set his feet, and his eyes, the
while, were steadily upon the Prince de Guémenée. He had seen the
hasty movement and observed now the sullenness which the young man
was not concerned to conceal.</p>

<p>As the door closed, he halted, and, maintaining that steady
regard under which Monsieur de Guémenée, to his profound annoyance,
began to feel uncomfortable, he spoke, subduing his resonant
voice.</p>

<p>"If I seem to be inopportune, Monsieur de Guémenée, if I
interrupt the criticisms you were about to offer, you have in this
more matter for thankfulness than you may suspect."</p>

<p>The Cardinal smiled his satisfaction at this immediate evidence
of Cagliostro's supernatural gifts of omniscience. But Monsieur de
Guémenée did not choose to be impressed.</p>

<p>"An easy guess, sir. I trust, for the sake of the wits of those
you delude, that you have more convincing tricks of
clairvoyance."</p>

<p>His Eminence flushed with pain at this coarse insult. He would
have spoken, but the mystagogue raised a hand in a gesture that
imperiously commanded that the answer be left to him. He had
remained standing on wide-planted feet within a yard or so of
Monsieur de Guémenée, and his uncanny eyes never left the young
man's face. He spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"There is no ground for resentment. Monsieur de Guémenée but
makes himself the mouthpiece of the vulgar and of the base calumny
in which the vulgar deal. Men will ever sneer at what they do not
understand. That is why they remain fast in the slime of their
brutish ignorance. Kindliness dictates that I deliver Your
Eminence's nephew from the fog that envelops him to his own hurt.
If Your Eminence will give me leave alone with him for a few
moments I shall hope to accomplish it."</p>

<p>Rohan smiled. "That will be yet another miracle." He rose at
once. "By all means, since you are so generously disposed,
enlighten this maladroit young man. I shall be at hand, in my
closet."</p>

<p>He moved, tall and stately, with a silken swish of his scarlet
robes, to a little door that led to a small adjoining chamber which
he frequently used for his studies. Monsieur de Guémenée sprang to
his feet, at first purely out of deference to his uncle. But as the
little door closed upon His Eminence he betrayed yet another reason
for that sudden rising.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Cagliostro, I have no wish to hear you. I will not
remain to be annoyed by your impertinences."</p>

<p>The Count, who had deferentially been facing the door through
which His Eminence had passed, turned slowly to confront him.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid, Monsieur de Guémenée?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of being convinced against your preconceptions, of seeing your
prejudices destroyed. Look at me. Look in my face, in my eyes,
sir."</p>

<p>The Prince looked up to meet that burning intent glance, then
lowered his eyes again, his manner sullen. "Why should I do that?"
he asked contemptuously.</p>

<p>"To conquer the difficulty that you experience in doing it."</p>

<p>"Difficulty? You want to laugh, I think." And in defiance, so as
to prove how easily he could support those awful eyes, he stared
boldly into them.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Monsieur de Guémenée," the Count commanded, and with
a shrug Monsieur de Guémenée sank again into the tall red
chair.</p>

<p>"Why, here's to humour you, then. But I warn you not to strain
my patience." He was conscious even as he spoke that he was using
jactancy as a cloak for a vague discomfort, for an irritating sense
that he was being dominated.</p>

<p>Count Cagliostro began to talk, in a low, crooning voice. "I
remember once, nearly two thousand years ago, as I was walking one
evening on the shore of Lake Tiberias, I met a man whose mind was
as obstinately delimited as is your own to the things that may be
apprehended through the bodily senses."</p>

<p>After that, partly because what the mystagogue said seemed
gibberish, partly because of the jargon in which he delivered
himself the Prince could understand but little of what he was being
told. But as he listened, consciousness vaguely grew that something
was happening to him, something which inspired him with an
increasing dread, yet from which he could no longer escape. The
glare of the eyes into which he was staring had become intolerable,
yet he found himself powerless to seek relief by averting his gaze.
His own eyes were held as irresistibly, as inexplicably, as his
very will to avert them was caught in some impalpable tentacle
against which it seemed useless to struggle. The eyes into which he
gazed grew in size to the dimensions of the eyes of an ox; they
continued to dilate until they were great twin pools gradually
merging into a single glowing pool in which he felt that presently
he must plunge and drown himself. And all the while that droning
voice growing more and more distant was pursuing with its
unintelligible narrative, adding something to the utter subjugation
of his senses. Gradually at first, then with increasing swiftness,
his consciousness diminished until it was totally blotted out.</p>

<p>For what ensued we must follow Monsieur de Guémenée's own
account as set down by him in a letter some years thereafter. He
was awakened from that singular slumber into which he had lapsed by
the booming of a great bell, like that of Nôtre Dame, which
resolved itself as consciousness cleared into the tinkling note of
the Sèvres clock on the tall overmantel. It was striking the hour
of ten.</p>

<p>From this he knew that his lapse could only have been momentary,
and as he recovered he found that the queer spell to which he had
been succumbing was shattered, and he was once more entirely
himself. He was still seated in the tall red chair, but Cagliostro
no longer stood before him. The man of mystery had moved over to
the fireplace, and was planted there now beside the clock, his
shoulders to the overmantel.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée's first and dominant emotion was
indignation, the more bitter because he could not understand the
nature of the trick that had been played upon him. It was from
anxiety to show that this trick, whatever it might be, had failed
that he sprang to his feet and gave expression to his wrath in
terms that took no account of Cagliostro's feelings.</p>

<p>"Miserable buffoon, do you dream that you can constrain me to
remain here to listen to your lying explanations? If you do, you
are as mistaken as when you suppose that I could be deceived by
them. I have nothing to say to you, nothing to hear from you. My
affair is with your silly dupe, His Eminence, my uncle."</p>

<p>Cagliostro remained impassive. "So be it, sir. I'll not detain
you. I merely ask that you remark the time. You will have noted
that it has just struck ten."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," said de Guémenée, and strode tempestuously
across the room, to pass into the closet to which the Cardinal had
withdrawn. He was conscious of being swept along by a tide of
ungovernable anger, and this was swollen by the mildness with which
the ever urbane Cardinal-Prince received him.</p>

<p>His Eminence stood reading by a bookcase on the far side of the
little room. Between him and his nephew there was a writing-table,
on which some documents were pinned down by a paper-weight in the
shape of a miniature, but fairly solid, silver battle-axe. At his
nephew's gusty entrance he closed the book upon his forefinger and
looked up.</p>

<p>"Well, Charles? Has His Excellency satisfied you?"</p>

<p>Recklessly out of his towering passion the young man answered:
"Do you suppose me as besotted as yourself that I could condescend
to listen to that charlatan's impostures?"</p>

<p>"Charles!" His Eminence raised his brows, his eyes grew round in
horror. "I think you are wanting in respect."</p>

<p>"What respect do you inspire, you, a Prince of the House of
Rohan, lending yourself to the swindling plans of this scoundrel,
this gaol-bird?"</p>

<p>His Eminence stiffened where he stood. His voice was cold and
stern.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you go too far. You will leave my house at once, and
you will never enter it again until you have sued for and obtained
pardon, both from me and from Monsieur de Cagliostro, for your
insulting words."</p>

<p>"Sue pardon from this mountebank! I?"</p>

<p>"On your knees, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Why, you fool," stormed Monsieur de Guémenée, lost in his rage
to reason and decency alike, "do you know what he is? Do you know,
for example, that in England he was gaoled for swindling and for
debt? I have proofs of it, and..."</p>

<p>"I care not what you have, monsieur. You will leave my house at
once. I do not permit myself to be addressed in such terms as those
which you have employed. You have gone too far. You have forgotten
the respect due, not only to my person, but to my office. In all my
life this has never happened to me before. You say that this man
has been gaoled for debt. Whether it is true or not, that fate is
one that is very likely to overtake you in the near future; for
from this moment you cease to interest me; you may wrestle with
your own difficulties, and yourself satisfy the creditors you have
abused, as you have abused my patience and my good nature. Not
another penny of mine shall stand between you and the fate you have
invited."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Monsieur de Guémenée. But even now there was
more anger than dismay in his soul.</p>

<p>"With that knowledge take your departure, sir, and do not
venture to return. You are an ingrate whom I never wish to see
again."</p>

<p>Trembling with fury, Monsieur de Guémenée steadied himself with
a hand upon the writing-table. He controlled himself to ask in a
voice that was steady, dangerously steady, considering his
condition: "Is that your last word, monseigneur."</p>

<p>With a great dignity the Cardinal replied: "My last word,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"Then your last word it shall be," said his frenzied nephew,
and, snatching up the silver battle-axe, he hurled it straight and
true at his uncle's august head. He saw it strike him full upon the
brow before His Eminence could so much as put up a hand to avert
the unexpected missile; he saw the blood gush forth; saw the tall
scarlet figure sway an instant where it stood, the fine hands
clawing the air as if seeking a support; then, with a sound as of a
rush of wings, the Cardinal-Prince sank together, crumpled and
fell, to lie inert.</p>

<p>Terror-stricken by his deed, his blind rage driven forth by
panic, Monsieur de Guémenée leaned forward over the table, clawing
its sides with nerveless hands. "Monseigneur! Monseigneur!" he
cried, in a choking wail, then sprang past the table and went to
kneel beside the fallen man. Horror came up like a great tide about
him at sight of the gaping vertical wound in the brow, where the
axe, hard-driven at close quarters, had split the skull. His
Eminence was quite dead.</p>

<p>Then, as he knelt there, paralysed in body and in spirit, he
heard the door open softly behind him. He looked up and round, to
behold Cagliostro, stern and grim, upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"Wretched man, what have you done?" asked the vibrant voice.</p>

<p>The Prince leapt to his feet. There was blood on his hands and
on the ruffles at his wrists. "It is your act," he raved. "Yours.
Behold the havoc you have wrought. It is you who are responsible
for this."</p>

<p>Cagliostro preserved a terrible calm. "Tell that to your judges
if you think it will save you from being broken on the wheel, from
being disembowelled alive for this hideous parricide. Ah, you
quail! But that is the least of the punishment in store for you.
You will have earned the execration of all upright men for this
horrible murder of your uncle and benefactor. Your name will
hereafter become a by-word."</p>

<p>"Cease! In God's name, cease!" cried Monsieur de Guémenée. "Do
you think I do not realize it?" And then his tone changed to a
piteous whine. "Sir, sir, you are reported to possess more than
human powers. Of your pity, help me in this my dreadful need."</p>

<p>"Ah! You believe in me now. It is true that I possess more than
ordinary human powers; but the power to raise the dead is not
within them."</p>

<p>"Is it not? Is it not?" Monsieur de Guémenée reverted abruptly
to his earlier frenzy. He was leering now with wicked cunning. "So
much the worse for you. Since yours is the blame, you shall bear
the punishment. I will rouse the house, and declare that it was you
who did this thing. What then, my friend? What then? Will your word
weigh against mine, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>Cagliostro smiled. "Ingenious. Unfortunately there is a witness.
Look behind you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Startled, Monsieur de Guémenée looked round. Dimly in the
shadows of a farther doorway, a doorway of whose existence he had
been in ignorance, he discerned the figure of a man. Looking more
closely his straining eyes recognized the Baron de Planta. "How
long have you been there, Monsieur?" he asked.</p>

<p>Cold and stern the Baron answered him: "From the moment that you
threw the axe."</p>

<p>The courage went out of Monsieur de Guémenée, taking all fury
with it. He raised his blood-stained hands in a gesture of
impotence. "What shall I do? Mon Dieu, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"What are you prepared to do if I can save you?" asked
Cagliostro.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée faced him; advanced towards him.</p>

<p>"Save me, do you say? Do you mock my distress? What help can
you, what help can any, give? You have said that you cannot raise
the dead."</p>

<p>"True. But I can undo what is done. Even that is possible to
such as I, for I am He Who Is. Listen, my prince, and seek to
understand. This deed of yours is something done in time. Time,
sir, is not a reality, not one of the fundamental verities. It is
an illusion, a human convention for the measuring of actions
concerned with our little moment of existence, this heartbeat in
eternity which we call life. To such as I who stand untrammelled by
the bonds of time, the past and the future are as they are in
eternity; that is to say they are not at all; for in eternity there
is always and only the present. If I were to turn time back for
you, Monsieur de Guémenée; if I were to turn it back to the moment
at which you rose to go in quest of your uncle, so that all that
now lies in the past would lie once more in the future and would be
inevitable. If I were to do this, what would you do for me?"</p>

<p>"For you?" Monsieur de Guémenée could only stare and stare.
Nevertheless, he answered the fantastic question, passionately
sobbing, "God knows there is nothing that I would not do."</p>

<p>Cagliostro approached him, smiling gently. "I ask a little thing
of you in return for so much. You have procured from England
evidence that I was in prison there. You have been at great pains
to do this simply so that you might destroy my credit with your
uncle, and raise a barrier to my accompanying him to Paris. I am
not the first great prophet who has suffered imprisonment. Some
have even been put to death by the vicious ignorance of men. For
myself I fear nothing from that revelation. But others whom I am
concerned to help and serve must suffer if, yielding to prejudice,
they should turn from me.</p>

<p>"What I offer you now is this: if you will swear to me on your
honour as a gentleman to destroy this evidence which you have
wasted such pains in obtaining and never to mention this matter to
a living soul, I on my side will so put back the clock for you,
that what has been will be still to come and may therefore be
avoided. Do you swear, monsieur?"</p>

<p>There was such firm authority in the voice that even the
Sadducaic mind of Monsieur de Guémenée was more than half conquered
by it. Feebly the other half still battled with reason.</p>

<p>"What you are proposing is impossible."</p>

<p>"Will you make the experiment? Will you swear as I require? It
is your only hope."</p>

<p>Desperately came the answer: "I swear! I swear!" and in pursuit
of it the oath was circumstantially given in the terms Cagliostro
dictated.</p>

<p>As Monsieur de Guémenée uttered the last formidable word of it,
his senses swam. He had a moment of faintness, which even as it
overtook him he attributed to the strain of what he had endured.
Then his senses cleared, and as sight, momentarily occluded, was
restored to him, he found himself in the library, seated once more
in the tall red chair, his legs composedly crossed.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not understand how he had come there, or,
indeed, anything. His wits were in chaos. Then, out of it, emerged
a sharp pellucid perception of the thing he had done and of the
horrible situation in which he found himself. Wild-eyed he looked
round, and saw Cagliostro standing as before by the overmantel in
such a position that his shoulders eclipsed the face of the Sèvres
clock. He stood with wide-planted feet, his countenance as
enigmatically calm as that of Amhitaba upon his nenuphar.</p>

<p>"Well, sir? Well?" The sight of him thus stirred Monsieur de
Guémenée to distraction. "You know what is to do."</p>

<p>The booming voice answered him. "It is done."</p>

<p>"Done? It is done?"</p>

<p>Cagliostro shrugged in weariness. "The stupidity of human nature
can be unfathomable. Did you expect to witness some visible,
material operation? What is done is an effort to the spirit, of the
will, sir. Look at your hands?"</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed. He turned his hands about as he stared at
them. They were white and clean; there was no faintest trace of
blood upon them or upon his ruffles. Vacantly, foolishly, he looked
again at Cagliostro, and Cagliostro answered the agonized question
in those wide eyes.</p>

<p>"I have accomplished no less than I promised, Monsieur de
Guémenée. We have stepped back in time." He moved aside, disclosing
the face of the blue and gold Sèvres clock, and as he moved it
began to strike the hour of ten, just as it had struck in the
moment before de Guémenée had risen to go to his uncle.</p>

<p>A sense of awe encompassed him, of a quite different order from
the last. His heart was beating in his throat; he had a sensation
of stifling. He was in the presence of forces that he could not
understand. Then, with reviving scepticism, another dread arose. He
was the dupe of some imposture. Hands could be wiped; clocks could
be turned back; but the dead could not be restored to life. In that
room beyond the little door his uncle lay with a split skull.</p>

<p>As if answering his thought, Count Cagliostro crossed the room
to the closet door, opened it, and spoke.</p>

<p>"I think Your Eminence will now find Monsieur de Guémenée
persuaded of the error with which he did me injustice."</p>

<p>From within the closet he was answered by a movement made
manifest by the rustle of silken robes, and, as Monsieur de
Guémenée sat forward, wild-eyed, clutching the arms of his chair,
the tall handsome figure of the Cardinal came into view and paused
under the lintel. His Eminence, smooth of brow and calm of eye,
composed and urbane as ever, was quietly smiling his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I knew he would find it easy to convince you, Charles, and I
rejoice in it. Men of the same blood must hold together in all
important things." His elegant hand was placed affectionately upon
Cagliostro's shoulder. "You will find His Excellency, Charles, the
arch-enemy of all fraud and error. Trust him as I do, and you
cannot fail to profit by it."</p>

<p>"I think he holds the proof of that," said Cagliostro
quietly.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Guémenée, breathing with difficulty, answered
nothing. He asked himself had he merely dreamt, was he still
dreaming, or had some unfathomable miracle been wrought. Then, as
his uncle advanced into the room, he remembered the deference due
to that august personage, and staggered like a drunkard to his
feet.</p>

<p>Many years later, in his prison in the fortress of San Leo, when
his thaumaturgy had brought him into the clutches of the Holy
Office, Cagliostro told this story to a young Dominican who had
been charged to show him the error of his ways.</p>

<p>"When we reflect," he ended, "that all this that the Prince de
Guémenée had seen and heard and felt and done had no existence save
in my mind and will, may we not ask ourselves what, after all, is
objective truth?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. THE DEATH-MASK</h2>

<p>ARMAND DE BAZANCOURT possessed, as we shall see, vision and a
gift of inference. These, in spite of shortcomings which we shall
also see, might, under any ministry but that of Thiroux de Crosne,
have carried him far. A young man of good shape, elegant
appointments, and engaging manner, he moved freely in the world of
fashion, everywhere regarded as an amiable trifler, and nowhere
suspected of association with the King's Lieutenant-General of
Police.</p>

<p>It was, however, a part of the tragedy towards which the French
Monarchy was sweeping that the office of Lieutenant-General was
filled by the incompetent de Crosne. A self-sufficient numskull,
whom Court influence alone had hoisted to his position, he
concerned himself almost exclusively with petty oppressions of a
people which, schooled in consciousness of its rights, was becoming
impatient of every form of tyranny. He had no ear for the distant
mutterings of the storm, no eye for the signs that alarmed
Bazancourt, no patience with Bazancourt's attempts to claim his
attention for these portents.</p>

<p>Above all, Bazancourt mistrusted the idealists who were loosed
upon the world of Louis XVI. He knew the danger of these
pseudo-intellectuals, these theorists who in crazy conceit would
destroy the existing order without discerning how to replace it. He
was aware of the dangerous forces of illuminism that toiled
underground in Germany, his attention caught by the edict of the
Elector of Bavaria against secret societies. He had studied the
malign activities of Weishaupt, and he suspected the mysterious
Count Alexandre de Cagliostro, who had descended upon Paris under
the exalted sponsorship of the Cardinal-Prince Louis de Rohan, but
who came no man knew whence, and who worked miracles that staggered
humanity, of being a missionary of the German adept. Therefore, in
order to investigate at close quarters, he had procured initiation
to the Coptic Freemasonry over which Cagliostro presided.</p>

<p>He bore the fruits of his observations in the Lodge of Supreme
Wisdom to de Crosne, and was mocked for his pains.</p>

<p>"I wonder what mare's nest you will be discovering next. An
organization working in secret, you say, for the destruction of the
existing order. To what end, then? To what end?"</p>

<p>"So that they may rebuild it&mdash;by their lights&mdash;on a
nobler plan."</p>

<p>"I am to believe, then, that men of birth, such as the
Cardinal-Prince de Rohan, the Prince de Soubise, the Due de
Chartres, Monsieur de Vergennes, and many more of their kind, are
conspiring for their own overthrow. That is what you invite me to
believe. My dear Bazancourt, it does not make sense. I shall end by
asking myself whether so bright an intelligence as yours is not
wasted in my dull department."</p>

<p>It was precisely what Bazancourt was beginning to ask himself.
But he practised patience under the ironic glance of the
Lieutenant-General's eyes, so reminiscent of a frog's.</p>

<p>"Does Your Excellency know how many degrees there are in this
Coptic Freemasonry?"</p>

<p>"I care not if there be a thousand."</p>

<p>"There are not quite so many. But there are many more than the
three with which the noblemen you name are allowed to become
acquainted. These three degrees, with their Egyptian ritual and
their fantastic mummeries, supply a convenient façade, behind
which, in the higher degrees, the sinister real work of the
revolutionaries is secretly performed."</p>

<p>For a moment de Crosne was serious. "You will have proof of
this? You have been initiated to these higher degrees?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. But I am seeking initiation, so that I may confirm
these suspicions."</p>

<p>The Minister took him up on the word. "Suspicions! Death of my
life! Shall I bring a storm about my ears from the nobility of
France, whom this charlatan amuses, upon no better grounds than
those of your suspicions? You are out of your senses, I think.
You'll bring me something better than that before I incommode
Monsieur de Cagliostro."</p>

<p>Bazancourt departed in wrathful determination to confront the
Lieutenant-General with evidence of his abounding fatuity. In quest
of it you behold him some weeks later mingling in the fashionable
crowd that paid court to Cagliostro in his startlingly appointed
house in the Rue St Claude.</p>

<p>The mystagogue was holding a reception in the spacious sybaritic
salon that provided so subtle and suggestive a setting for his
peculiar genius, blending the crafts of East and West in French
marqueterie and rugs from Smyrna and Ispahan, and symbolizing the
wisdom of antiquity by, here, a statue of Isis, and, yonder, a bust
of Hippocrates upon a Louis Quinze console. He was receiving his
noble following for the particular purpose of doing honour to
Houdon, and admiring the imposing bust of himself which that famous
sculptor had just completed.</p>

<p>Of middle height and stocky build, with the shoulders of an
Atlas, the mystagogue bore in his person the coarseness of a
Calabrian peasant with the majesty of an emperor. His dress was an
aesthetic outrage. Over a scarlet waistcoat and scarlet breeches,
he wore a grey velvet coat that was heavy with gold. Valuable
Spanish lace foamed at his wrists and throat; diamonds sparkled on
his breast, on his fingers and on the buckles of his shoes in a
profusion that served to remind the world that he possessed the
secret of their manufacture. Without fineness of feature, yet his
countenance was of a bold, commanding power that compelled the
veneration he enjoyed. And this not merely from frivolous,
sensation-loving women, such as Mesdames de Polignac, de Choiseul,
D'Avrincourt, and the like, who hung spellbound upon his
utterances, but from men of great positions in the world, the
Cardinal-Prince de Rohan, the Prince de Soubise and a dozen other
scarcely less eminent.</p>

<p>As suited the occasion, it was of art that the Master
discoursed, in his queer Italianate French that at times was
difficult to follow. He talked of Leonardo, of Michelangelo, and
even of Praxiteles; as if he had personally known them in former
avatars. He repeated sayings which he attributed to one or another
of them; he disclosed secrets hitherto unpublished which he seemed
to imply that he had observed in their working methods. Thus he
entranced his audience by these fresh revelations of a knowledge so
vast that it seemed to encompass all Creation.</p>

<p>In Houdon he declared, with a hand affectionately poised upon
the embarrassed sculptor's shoulder, that the spirit of Donatello
lived again. In fact, he seemed to hint that the Florentine had
been reincarnated in the Frenchman. Like Donatello, Houdon
possessed, he pronounced, the uncanny art of endowing inert bronze
or marble with the very quality of life. He reminded his gaping
listeners that when Pope Clement had seen Houdon's St Bruno, he had
exclaimed: "He would speak if it were not that the rules of his
order impose silence."</p>

<p>"And you may say the same of this," he told them, pointing
dramatically to the bust of himself.</p>

<p>This, at least, was true, thought Bazancourt. For Houdon had
produced a head so vital that, had it been tinted, it might have
passed for living flesh and bone.</p>

<p>With amazing insight and clarity, Cagliostro went on to expound
the difference between art, such as Houdon's, and mere
craftsmanship, such as that of some others whom he mentioned; and
then, the better to illustrate his meaning, he exhibited some
grotesque masks in wax that Houdon had modelled for the amusement
of the Master. Among them was a death-mask of Rousseau that sent a
shiver through those who beheld it, and drew from Monsieur de
Soubise the comment: "So horribly natural that it scarcely seems a
mask. Rather is it as if the actual dead face had been sliced
off."</p>

<p>Then Cagliostro was garrulously expounding art in Greece and art
in Rome, and came by way of this to other Roman matters, all in
that manner of reminiscence which enthralled his disciples and
irritated the sceptic Bazancourt.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-General's agent, however, found a salve for this
irritation in the propinquity of the Countess of Cagliostro. For a
month now he had been paying her a flagrant court. Few scruples
ever troubled Monsieur de Bazancourt; none where a woman was
concerned. It was among his failings that he suffered from a
temperament so ardent as never to be happy unless offering himself
as a wilting victim upon the altar of Aphrodite. And whilst he may
have deluded himself that it was sound strategy to approach the
Grand Copht's secrets obliquely through the lovely Countess, it is
just as possible that Serafina de Cagliostro's beauty, acting upon
his susceptibility, had inspired him with this rather ignoble line
of attack. Imperceptibly, however, he had reached a stage where his
audacious love-making was in danger of becoming an end in itself.
And his conduct was being noticed more than he suspected. No longer
did he join the fashionable parade along the Cours la Reine in the
elegant phaeton which it had been his habit to drive. Instead he
displayed himself there on horseback, obviously so that he might
enjoy the closer company of the lovely Serafina de Cagliostro,
whose mornings were so frequently devoted to riding <i>en
amazone</i>. And his relations with her, in a measure as they
increased in intimacy, drew him further away from the object he had
started out to serve. When he remembered it, he persuaded himself
that he merely awaited opportunity; that he must not scare the game
by too brusque an approach. As it happened, opportunity too clear
to be neglected presented itself now as he leaned upon the lady's
chair.</p>

<p>Cagliostro's discourse on ancient Rome and Romans had led the
Master to talk of Pontius Pilate.</p>

<p>"The fact is," boomed the sonorous voice, "that he was not the
man for Judea. His Roman tolerance was marred by Roman pride. He
was too limited in the extent to which he could suffer the Jews to
pursue ideals different from those in which he had, himself, been
reared." The theurgist's uncanny eyes, so bright and terrible in
their magnetic power, were dimmed as if by retrospection. "On that
fateful day I warned him that if he washed his hands he would
bestow upon his name a detestable immortality. I see him now, a
comely, portly man, the very incarnation of calm authority, in his
purple-bordered toga, bending in full view of that howling, unclean
multitude over the silver basin that was proffered by a kneeling
slave. Alas! Alas! Had he but heeded me&mdash;had the Great
Architect of the Universe so willed it&mdash;how different an
edifice would history have built."</p>

<p>He ended on a sigh, and like an echo of it a shivering rustle
ran through the awed listeners. Then, as he ceased, and the spell
was lifted, a growing hum of conversation followed. Under cover of
it, Bazancourt, who had perceived his cue, spoke softly into the
ear of the Countess.</p>

<p>"Surely it cannot lie in the Divine Will that mankind shall
continue to groan in chains that are of Man's forging. Surely the
end must be near." There was a passionate earnestness in his voice
which she had never heard before. "Surely redemption must be at
hand for the people who sweat and writhe under the heel of
oppression. To help it forward would be a man's work in the
world."</p>

<p>She was looking up at him out of her lovely, delicate, almost
childlike, face, and the candid blue eyes, over the colour of which
duels had been fought, were wide and round with wonder.</p>

<p>"You take me by surprise, sir. These feelings, this perception
of the sufferings of humanity."</p>

<p>She was nibbling at the bait, he thought. He put on a
countenance of wistfulness. "I am perhaps not as shallow as I seem,
nor so concerned with selfish interests that I can behold without
anger so much cruelty, injustice and tyranny. Ah, but forgive the
transgression into which my emotions have betrayed me."</p>

<p>"They are emotions that do you honour," she murmured, still
regarding him. "They deepen my esteem for you."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged he proceeded. Who that had a heart could remain
indifferent to these wrongs? It was time, high time, that men of
sensibility should organize themselves to regenerate society.</p>

<p>Her wonder seemed to increase. "You perceive that, too? But
perhaps you are not alone in perceiving it." She lowered her voice
to a confidential note, "Do you know that this organization does
not exist already?"</p>

<p>He assumed the question to be something more than rhetorical.
"What do you tell me?" he cried, like a man in whom a great hope is
suddenly aroused.</p>

<p>The outburst brought her to her feet. Slim and straight at his
side, she set a delicate curbing hand upon his satin sleeve. "Sh!
No more now. It is not the moment. And the Master is watching us."
She sighed. "Jealousy is the one human weakness that lingers in
that great soul. But I shall ride tomorrow morning. If we should
meet we can talk of this again."</p>

<p>Bazancourt departed that day from the Rue St Claude in the
conviction that the first step was taken towards the lifting of the
veil. If he rightly gauged Cagliostro's methods, the Countess would
now inform her husband that in Bazancourt he possessed a likely
proselyte, and his initiation to those suspect higher degrees of
Coptic Freemasonry would be considered. To gather the fruits of his
scheming he rode forth on the morrow's fair Spring morning, very
brave in his best coat of a becoming royal blue.</p>

<p>He had gone the length of the Cours la Reine and was approaching
the Bois before he espied the Countess. She rode, as usual, her
mettlesome white Arab, and was followed at a respectful distance by
the Sicilian groom, Pasquale, whose devotion to his mistress had
been fortified of late by Bazancourt's bribes. The grace of her
supple figure, and the mastery with which she sat her horse, proved
so inflaming a sight to him that when he had overtaken her, and
they were moving gently side by side, his discourse was of anything
but the Rights of Man. The susceptible Bazancourt's ultimate object
was again obscured by the immediate joys her presence gave him. So
far did he push audacity that at last she reproved him.</p>

<p>"Was it for this foolishness that we were to meet today,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Foolishness? Cruel! Is my love a foolishness?"</p>

<p>"You are not to talk to me of love, sir. You do not know the
dangers you incur."</p>

<p>"Say that I do not heed them..."</p>

<p>"But you must. You must remember that I am the wife of Count
Cagliostro. Gentle, benign, divinely kindly as he is, he is yet the
master of terrible powers, which it would be madness to
provoke."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bazancourt became suitably lyrical. "If he were
master of the lightnings, with power to blight me, yet the torment
in my soul must find expression. Serafina! Deep calls to deep. A
passion such as mine cannot leave you untouched."</p>

<p>"It must, my friend. It must!" And she added, sadly grave, "For
both our sakes."</p>

<p>"Ah! But that is almost an admission."</p>

<p>"Never! It is not." The protest was on such a wailing note that
it confessed the very opposite. Then, suddenly mastering herself,
"Come, my friend," she bade him. "Help me to be strong. We were to
be serious today. We were to think not of ourselves, but of the
millions groaning in the chains of servitude."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said, and sighed, aghast almost at the reluctance
which he discovered in himself to cross the threshold which
yesterday he had been so jubilant to have reached.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just because of this mood of his, this amorous
obscuring of his real aims, that the interview proved barren. Taken
in the toils he had so artfully spread, his enthusiasm as a
policeman was dimmed by his enthusiasm as a lover. He probed with
clumsy abruptness. "You were to tell me of the organization that is
to mend these ills."</p>

<p>She turned her graceful head to face him. "I was to tell you
that?" Amazement stressed her question. "You have dreamt, my
friend, Could I tell you what I do not know?"</p>

<p>"Did you not say that the organization exists?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I asked you did you know that it does not. For well it
may. The Count holds in his great wisdom that every action brings
its own reaction. When an evil becomes overwhelming it creates its
own remedy."</p>

<p>"And that is all?" he asked. "Is it no part of the Master's
benevolent mission to lead in this holy work, in which I would so
gladly co-operate?"</p>

<p>"I will tell him what you say. He will, at least, admire your
altruism."</p>

<p>It was not an answer. But, growing cautious, he would press no
further. He had said enough. The next move must come from the other
side.</p>

<p>What came, at dusk, on the evening of the morrow, was an urgent
note from the Countess left at his lodging in the Chaussée d'Antin
by Pasquale, the groom.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Friend (she wrote in a straggling hand that
was in itself an evidence of distress), I am in great trouble and
most urgent need. If the half is true of the feelings you profess
for me, you will come at the earliest moment.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Serafina.</p>

<p>That cry quickened his pulses. If hitherto he had sought
Serafina sometimes as the policeman, sometimes as the lover, it was
as both that he sought her now.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the house in the Rue St Claude, not by the
gigantic turbaned negro, who was Cagliostro's usual doorkeeper, but
by the confidential Pasquale, who bade him go up unannounced to the
waiting Countess.</p>

<p>He beheld her on the dimly-lighted landing, coming to meet him,
all in white. As he climbed the last step of the stairs, she flung
herself forward and collapsed against him. He caught the slight,
lissom body in his arms, and, intoxicated by that contact, hitherto
so ardently but so vainly desired, he held her close and kissed her
by sheer force of instinct. She was trembling violently as she
yielded him her lips.</p>

<p>"You love me, Armand?" she murmured. It was the first time that
she uttered his name. "Say it! Say it, for pity's sake!"</p>

<p>It was certainly not the policeman who answered hoarsely: "I
worship you, my angel."</p>

<p>"I am in such need of you," she moaned. "Tell me that I can
depend upon you. Trust you."</p>

<p>"To the death," said Bazancourt in his intoxication, and would
have kissed her again, but that now she stayed him.</p>

<p>She disengaged herself from his clasp "Hush, my friend, Wait.
Come with me."</p>

<p>She took him by the hand, and, with steps that faltered and
stumbled, led him forward, whilst he, like a somnambulist,
submissive to her will, went blindly.</p>

<p>She opened a door and drew him over the threshold of a room that
was dimly lighted by only two candles in ormolu sconces on the
brocaded wall. In the room's middle Bazancourt beheld a great bed
under a silken rosy canopy. Towards this, Bazancourt, in amazement,
with quickened pulses, suffered himself very willingly to be drawn
by the fingers that encircled his wrist and the gently murmured,
"Come, my dear."</p>

<p>Having reached the bed, she paused a moment, hesitating, her
hand upon the curtain. Then, with abrupt violence, she tore it
aside, and Bazancourt, suddenly disillusioned and sobered by
horror, wrenched himself from her grasp, and leaned forward to
stare in the dim light at the thing she had unveiled.</p>

<p>Supine upon the bed lay the sheeted bulk of Cagliostro. His face
and hands alone were laid bare, but it needed no more than a glance
to reveal not only that he was dead, but also how he had died. From
between the slits of half-closed lids the eyes that in life had
been so compelling stared now in vitreous, imbecile fixity from a
countenance that was leaden-hued, and wore about the blue-lipped
mouth the grin of rigor. His hands, like hands of yellow wax,
emerging from beruffled sleeves, were folded upon the bulky chest,
almost touching the gold hilt of the dagger that had been plunged
into his breast. About it a reddish viscous stain had spread and
gleamed now in the twilight of the guttering candles.</p>

<p>Mechanically the stricken Bazancourt leaned further forward, and
touched one of those hands. Its cold clamminess sent a shudder
through him. It told him that the Count must have been dead some
hours. He would have carried investigation further, but the
Countess, as if unable to bear more, pulled him away, and,
thrusting herself between him and the bed, drew the curtains again
so as to shut out that dreadful sight.</p>

<p>With her shoulders to that background of rosy silk she faced
Bazancourt, her pallor scarcely less than that of the corpse. Her
voice came hoarse and strangled at first, a vague moan that only
gradually assumed coherence.</p>

<p>"You have seen, my friend. Dead! Dead! He boasted that neither
steel nor poison could touch his immortality. Yet this poor weak
hand sufficed to quench it."</p>

<p>"You!" Bazancourt's tall, graceful figure seemed to shrink.
Horror made him crouch a little. "You killed him? You!"</p>

<p>Her answer stunned what little sense remained in him. "Because
of you, Armand. For your sake. For your honour, which he insulted.
I could not bear it, my love. It made me mad. I struck without
knowing what I did. Our rides had been reported to him. He
suspected us. He accused us of betraying him. That I could have
borne. But when his jealousy drove him the lengths of saying you
were a creature of de Crosne's, that I had taken a mouchard, a spy,
for my lover, that affront to you was more than I could suffer. And
so...And so..." She broke down, sobbing, and staggered helplessly
towards him.</p>

<p>His arms received her, but not his heart. This had been turned
to lead. She had killed Cagliostro because he had said that
Bazancourt was a catchpoll. She had killed him because of her faith
in Bazancourt. He was shamed by consciousness of how he had abused
that faith, so that it was almost as if his own hand had driven
that dagger into Cagliostro's heart. The policeman in him, aroused
by the first glimpse of that corpse, was thrust out now, and not by
the lover, but by the accomplice, shamed and
conscience-stricken.</p>

<p>He perceived how, by making love to the woman so that he might
spy the better upon the husband, he had aroused in her an
unsuspected passion that had brought her into mortal jeopardy.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" he groaned, and beat his brow with his
clenched fist. "Ah Dieu! What is to be done?"</p>

<p>"You will save me, Armand?" she moaned. "You must save me. You
must."</p>

<p>This was just what he was telling himself that he must do. "Why,
yes. But how? How? There is this body." He was suddenly inspired.
"Could it be suicide? Let me look again."</p>

<p>He made to put her from him. But she clung. "No, no! I cannot
bear it! No pretence will serve. If I am questioned when they find
him I shall break down and betray myself. I know I shall. I am
weak. Terribly weak, Armand. He must disappear. I will give out
that he has gone away; gone abroad on a sudden summons, on a sudden
duty of his lofty mission. It has always been his way to appear and
disappear mysteriously. That is known. People will not wonder
unduly."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." Bazancourt was almost impatient. "But how? How
disappear? How are we to get rid of this?"</p>

<p>"That is where I need your help," she whimpered. "You must take
him away."</p>

<p>"I!" He recoiled, aghast. "Take him away? Take him where?"</p>

<p>"Listen! Listen!" She wrung her hands. "Be calm, Armand. Be
yourself, for pity's sake. Listen. There is your phaeton. You could
carry him away in that, away into the country, and there dispose of
him. There is the river. And no one will ever know. Only Pasquale.
He will help. I can trust him. There are no other servants in the
house tonight. I have thought of all. You will do this, Armand, my
love. You will do this for me, who killed him for you. Afterwards,
my love, there is nothing... nothing I will refuse you."</p>

<p>But Bazancourt was no longer to be moved by such a promise.
Horror had withered all desire. The will to help her had basis for
only the responsibility she thrust upon him for what had happened.
And even this will to help her shrank before the terrible
difficulties and dangers it involved. How could he hope,
undetected, to convey a corpse out of Paris in a phaeton? How hope,
undetected, to dispose of it afterwards? And if he were caught with
such an evidence of crime, what did she conceive must happen to
him? Frenziedly he voiced these questions. She amazed and horrified
him by the promptness of an answer which showed him how well and
coldly she had considered all.</p>

<p>She pointed to a great chest curiously wrought of iron that
stood against a wall, an Italian wedding-coffer. The body, she
said, could be packed into it, and so conveyed to some convenient,
lonely spot where road and river met, or from some bridge that at
night would be untenanted. It could be dropped into the water never
to be seen again.</p>

<p>In mounting anguish, Bazancourt argued, first recoiling from the
task, and then, finally, with an abrupt, frantic yielding to her
wild supplications, he ordered her to set about emptying the chest
so that he might thrust the body into it.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," she answered him. "Let that be my part, with
Pasquale to help me. It will save precious time, for we can do it
while you are gone. Heaven bless you, my Armand, my love. I knew
that you would not fail me." She was thrusting him towards the door
as she spoke. She was all impatience, now that he had consented, to
have him fetch his carriage without the least delay. "Lose no
time," she admonished him. "Every moment that passes increases the
danger of discovery. Go, my dear. Make haste, for pity's sake."</p>

<p>He took himself off at last upon that errand with wits as
muddled as a drunkard's. Here, he told himself, was a fine end to
his adventure, to the investigations that were to unmask a vast
conspiracy and shame the harsh complacency of Monsieur de Crosne.
As a result of mixing love-making with police work, he had made
himself an accessory to a murder. And because a woman with a face
of childlike innocence, who was yet capable of driving a poniard
into a man's vitals, told him that the murder had been committed
for his sake, here was he risking ruin and the hangman. Let him but
win safely out of this, and he would order himself differently in
future.</p>

<p>Thus Armand de Bazancourt what time he went from the Rue de St
Claude and returned to it within the hour in the gay phaeton that
was to do duty as a hearse.</p>

<p>All was ready when he arrived. Pasquale, wooden-faced, was
waiting in the vestibule with the Italian wedding-chest which had
now become a sarcophagus. Between them they hoisted it to the floor
of the carriage. The Countess did not appear, and for this, at
least, Bazancourt was thankful. His most ardent wish was that he
might never set eyes on her again, and nothing was further from his
chilled mind than to claim from her fulfilment of the promise to
reward this loathly service that he rendered her.</p>

<p>His whip cracked, and he rolled away through the night, down the
Rue St Denis, and along the Faubourg St Honoré, to be halted at
last by the closed gates of the Barrier of the Roule. His summons
to the guard to open for him was loud and peremptory.</p>

<p>A sergeant emerged from the guard-house. Lanterns gleamed about
the phaeton, and then came questions. Whither was monsieur going at
this hour?</p>

<p>Bazancourt was hotly indignant. "What's that to you, my man?
What's this impertinence? Unbar the gate at once, or I'll make you
smart for your officiousness."</p>

<p>The sergeant was calmly remonstrative. "I do no more than my
duty. Orders are to allow no one to pass the barriers tonight
without giving an account of himself."</p>

<p>"What are you telling me? What orders are these?"</p>

<p>"From His Majesty's Lieutenant-General, himself, if you must
know. They have just been issued."</p>

<p>Bazancourt ground his teeth, but more in scorn than fear. Here
was another of these petty enactments with which de Crosne
irritated the world whilst ignoring the underground ferment that
threatened to engulf them all.</p>

<p>He answered irritably. "Such orders do not apply to me. I am
Armand de Bazancourt, of the Lieutenant-General's own department,
and I am going to St Cloud about my business. Now open the gate. I
am late already."</p>

<p>But his peremptoriness made no visible impression upon the
stolidity of the sergeant. A lantern was thrust within the phaeton.
Its light gleamed upon the iron chest. "What have you there,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"A box, fool. Can't you see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, I can see. And what do you carry in it, if you
please?"</p>

<p>"What do I carry in it? My effects, of course."</p>

<p>"To be sure. But I'll have to see them. Pray give yourself the
trouble of opening the box."</p>

<p>"Open...?" Bazancourt was suddenly in a cold sweat. "Name of
God, my lad, you exceed your authority. I've told you who I am.
Enough of this! Unbar the gate."</p>

<p>"Patience, monsieur! Patience! There has been a robbery. And
we're to let no one out of Paris without making sure that he's not
the thief."</p>

<p>"Ah! You take me for a thief now! What's your name? By God, I'll
have you broke for this."</p>

<p>The sergeant was stirred out of his phlegm. "That's enough!
That's enough! You'll open that box, or I'll treat you same as if
you were the thief; that is, take you straight to the
Lieutenant-General. Those are my orders. So open the box if you
want to get to St Cloud tonight."</p>

<p>"That I shall certainly not. We'll report to His Excellency by
all means, and you'll see what'll happen to you for delaying
me."</p>

<p>His fears had been lifted from him. He had but to show himself
to Monsieur de Crosne, and there would be an end to any question of
investigating his luggage. The Lieutenant-General was not likely to
take his assistant for a thief.</p>

<p>So, with a couple of guardsmen in the phaeton, seated on the
accursed chest, Bazancourt drove back as far as the Rue St Honoré
where the minister dwelt.</p>

<p>The Swiss doorkeeper, to whom Bazancourt was well known,
dispatched a lackey with his message to the Lieutenant-General,
and, after the shortest of delays, Monsieur de Crosne came to him
in the little office on the ground floor where he waited.</p>

<p>"But what is this, my dear Bazancourt?"</p>

<p>Bazancourt explained. The Minister raised his brows.</p>

<p>"Surely, my friend, it would have been easier to open the box
than give yourself the trouble of being brought back here, so that
I may speak for you."</p>

<p>"That perhaps. But, then, the indignity of it. To submit me, a
member of Your Excellency's department, to be searched."</p>

<p>"You must be patient with the sergeant. He had only your word
for it that you are one of my lieutenants. Of course I sympathize
with your repugnance to have a common fellow fingering your
effects. Quite. So natural, after all."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is always so understanding. If you will say a
word to these guards I will remove the inconvenience of my
presence."</p>

<p>"Of course. Of course. But I think..." He paused, taking his lip
between finger and thumb. "We had better see this box. You would
not object to my looking through it? A mere formality."</p>

<p>"Yourself?" Bazancourt's mouth fell open and remained so.</p>

<p>De Crosne was apologetic. "The person robbed is a man of
consequence," he explained. "And he is in great distress. He is
here in my house now, awaiting the result of my measures. After
all, I must respect the regulations I have made, must I not? So
we'll have the box in and in five minutes, my dear Bazancourt, you
will be able to resume your journey."</p>

<p>He waddled to the door to give his orders, whilst Bazancourt
stood petrified. He came back, rubbing his hands. He was jocular.
"It shall never be said of me that a law-maker is a law-breaker. I
must see my own regulations upheld. But a mere formality, my dear
fellow. A mere formality."</p>

<p>Bazancourt, still inarticulate, cursed him in his heart. It was
characteristic of the pettifogging idiot to be so fatuously
obedient to the letter of his imbecile enactments. With ruin
grinning at him from the shadow of the gallows, Bazancourt mopped
his wet brow as the two soldiers staggered in with the box.</p>

<p>De Crosne waved them out, and stood for a moment staring at the
chest. "Do you know that it is uncommonly like the description of
the coffer that has been stolen? No wonder the sergeant was so
insistent. However, if you'll unlock it, we shall soon be
done."</p>

<p>"Unlock it?" Bazancourt glared wildly from a face that was of
the colour of chalk. "I...I have not the key." This was as truthful
as it sounded foolish.</p>

<p>"You have not the key? Of your own box? But, my friend!" The
minister stared at him. He was fingering his lip again. "Hum! Ha! I
wonder, now." He went to the door again, uttered an order to the
Swiss outside and stood waiting, whilst Bazancourt, sick and faint,
leaned for support against the marble overmantel.</p>

<p>Brisk steps approached and paused beyond the threshold. When
Monsieur de Crosne turned at last and half-closed the door, he
carried a key in his hand. He went to the box again, and stooped
over it.</p>

<p>"It fits!" he cried. "Now this is very strange." The lock
clicked, and as the Lieutenant-General straightened himself, he
flung back the lid.</p>

<p>Bazancourt sprang forward with a cry of terror that froze on his
lips. Monsieur de Crosne had tossed a coverlet from the contents
and he was taking out some of these: an épergne, a salver, a silver
bowl, a pair of massive candlesticks, another salver and, beyond
these, Bazancourt caught the gleam of more silver, partially
swathed, so as to prevent it from rattling.</p>

<p>Bazancourt stared aghast, too amazed even to experience relief.
By what miracle, he asked himself, had this come about? By what
magic had the corpse of the murdered Cagliostro become
transmogrified into a parcel of household silver?</p>

<p>De Crosne was calling. "Are you there, Monsieur le Comte? Come
in, sir. Come in."</p>

<p>And now, as if there were not mystery enough already, the body
of Cagliostro surged upon the threshold. But it was alive, this
body which an hour ago his own eyes had seen dead, his own touch
had verified to be cold. The portly figure in its grey velvet coat,
with a blazing star of diamonds upon that breast which Bazancourt
had seen transfixed by a dagger, advanced solemnly. He carried his
plumed three-cornered hat tucked under his arm. His majestic head
was thrown back, his bold, magnetic eyes were stern.</p>

<p>Passing from one terror to another, Bazancourt gulped and
stared, and then told himself this was all an evil dream. Dimly he
heard the voice of de Crosne.</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to verify if this is your property,
Monsieur le Comte. But of course it must be since your key fits the
lock."</p>

<p>"Of course," boomed the deep voice. "Per Bacco! That is proof
enough, I think. And in Monsieur de Bazancourt's possession, as I
foretold. Your Excellency would not believe in my
clairvoyance."</p>

<p>De Crosne was measuring his lieutenant with an eye in which
there was no affection, and only now did it dawn on Bazancourt that
the earlier smoothness had been that of the cat that toys with the
mouse it means to slay.</p>

<p>"Without doubt there will be some explanation," said his frigid
Excellency. "I hope so. I hope so, Monsieur de Bazancourt."</p>

<p>Bazancourt had a difficulty with his strangled throat.
"Why...Why, I am as astounded as Your Excellency," he contrived at
last. "There... there has been some mistake. The box..." Words
failed him. His very voice was choked again.</p>

<p>"A mistake!" boomed Cagliostro. "Ah, Cospetto! A mistake,
indeed." He squared himself before the stricken man. He assumed the
mantle of the thaumaturge. "In my understanding of the human heart
and of human weakness I can forgive you that you made love to my
wife. She is of a beauty to turn heads less empty than your own.
Knowing the lengths to which temptation will urge a needy man, I
can forgive you that you stole my silver. But that you should have
made love to my wife merely as a means to win into my house and
steal my silver, that is the abomination that I can never
forgive."</p>

<p>"It is not true!" screamed Bazancourt from the depths of his
despair.</p>

<p>"Not true?" Cagliostro's great eyes seemed to dilate. "Can you
explain how else my silver comes to be in your possession? If so,
here is Monsieur de Crosne to hear you. Tell him your tale."</p>

<p>He could explain, of course. But only in part; for how
Cagliostro, whom he had certainly seen dead, had come to life again
went beyond the horizon to which his sight was limited, unless the
mystagogue possessed, indeed, the gift he claimed of immortality.
But who would credit so crack-brained a tale? And even if it should
be made credible, dare he assert that he had been a willing
accessory to a murder?</p>

<p>He perceived that Cagliostro mocked him, just as he perceived
the motives from which the Man of Mystery had acted. Made somehow
aware of Bazancourt's connection with the Ministry of Police, and
suspecting the aims of his espionage, the mystagogue, with the
assistance of that traitress, Serafina, had gone about encompassing
his ruin. So much was clear enough. What still remained to bewilder
Bazancourt was Cagliostro's resurrection. He was to brood over it
in the unhappy days that followed, viewing again in imagination
that leaden-hued countenance with its glazed eyes and rigor-grin,
those waxen hands that had been so cold to his touch. And then the
very image that his thought employed brought light. Waxen hands.
Wax. Suddenly he remembered the wax masks of Houdon's fashioning,
and in particular the tinted death-mask of Rousseau which had sent
a shiver through those who beheld it, and of which Soubise had said
that it was as if the actual dead face had been sliced off. The
mystery was solved.</p>

<p>Bazancourt, you see, had vision, as I began by asserting, and a
gift of inference which might, had his temperament been less
ardent, have made him one of the ornaments of the profession from
which he was now cast out.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. THE ALCHEMICAL EGG</h2>

<p>COUNT CAGLIOSTRO exhibited a wrath unworthy of a man in whom
mastery of the secrets of nature, from microcosm to macrocosm, and
consciousness of former avatars should induce a philosophic calm in
all situations.</p>

<p>He delivered himself to his Countess, the delicately lovely
Serafina. It was against the German physician, Friedrich Anton
Mesmer, that he inveighed, and this torrentially in his native
Italian.</p>

<p>"This scorpion! This slug! This larva! As insupportable as he is
ridiculous with his vats and his magnetic fluids, and the rest of
the empirical stock-in-trade with which he swindles credulous fools
and hysterical women. Animal magnetism! Ah, Cospetto! It needs
animal minds to absorb it. The Egyptian adepts, who probed the
mysteries of nature to depths not even suspected by the so-called
men of science of today, could have told this quacksalver..."</p>

<p>"Alessandro!" his Countess interrupted. "We are alone."</p>

<p>He checked, and drawn up to the full of his powerful, stocky
middle height, his heavy black brows came together above the
uncannily piercing eyes, eyes described as terrible by so many of
those who had experienced their mysterious power. Then abruptly he
relaxed, shrugged and acknowledged her gentle irony by a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, per Bacco! Why, indeed, burn myself up over that
contemptible homunculus. Let him sneer all he pleases over my claim
to possess the Philosopher's Stone. The more publicly he sneers,
the more publicly shall he be confounded, the more shall his crass
ignorance be exposed when he is confronted with the triumph of my
sublime art."</p>

<p>"Be careful in what you do," she ventured. Timidity was, after
all, her norm, notwithstanding that she was Grand Mistress of the
Lodge of Coptic Freemasonry, which he, as Grand Copht, had
consecrated, so that the fair sex should contribute to the
advancement of the high mission on which he walked the Earth. Ten
years younger than her husband, she seemed scarcely more than a
child, very slenderly fashioned and finely featured, with a skin
that was like mother of pearl and eyes of a gentian blue, from
which innocence and candour looked shyly upon the world. Her
ethereal personality supplied an arresting complement to his
overpowering vigour.</p>

<p>"Madame de Choiseul was telling me," she warned him, "that this
man possesses great knowledge and power. He is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cagliostro broke in derisively. "Madame de Choiseul! That hen!
Will you quote me her cacklings? Madonna! I'll so deal with this
Tudescan empiric, this dear Signor Mesmer, that he shall crawl to
me for pardon. I'll give him magnetism; a bellyful of it; enough to
sicken and break him. And not of the animal variety."</p>

<p>Yet behind the fierce boast a certain anxiety lurked in the
stout heart of the thaumaturge. Monsieur de Vivonne, one of his
most loyal disciples, had reported to him that Mesmer was
proclaiming him a charlatan who was not even original; a charlatan
modelled upon the famous Comte de Saint Germain, a clumsy
plagiarist of the arts of that mysterious, gifted man who had been
the intimate of the late King. Like Saint Germain, Cagliostro
pretended to a sort of immortality, but whereas Saint Germain
merely conveyed the impression that he had been an eye-witness of
the march of history, Cagliostro&mdash;in the actual words of
Mesmer&mdash;explicitly and impudently asserted his fabulous
longevity. Not content, as Saint Germain had been, to pretend to
increase the size of diamonds, Cagliostro claimed to have
manufactured those with which he plastered himself to excess, and
where Saint Germain was content to profess that he could induce the
oyster to grow pearls, Cagliostro boasted that he could fashion
pearls of great price by an amalgamation of little, worthless ones.
Like Saint Germain, he gave out that he had discovered the
Philosopher's Stone, that he could transmute metals, and by means
of an elixir prolong life indefinitely.</p>

<p>"In fact," Monsieur de Vivonne reported Mesmer to have said,
"this impudent Italian has appropriated the whole of Saint
Germain's stock-in-trade, and vulgarized it."</p>

<p>To Cagliostro this had been the cruellest cut of all. He
rehearsed it now to his Countess. "What was that Latin tag this son
of a dog spat out? Ah, yes: Nihil tetigit quod non inquinavit. I
touch nothing but I soil it! Cospetto! We shall see who will be
soiled by what I shall show him here tonight."</p>

<p>"He is coming here?" Serafina displayed anxiety.</p>

<p>"His Eminence of Rohan has asked me if he might bring him, so
that he may be humbled by witnessing the little transmutation I am
to demonstrate."</p>

<p>She stood up. "And you..."</p>

<p>He reared his majestic head. He seemed to swell and grow with
pride. "I have told the Cardinal-Prince that Doctor Mesmer shall
act as my fellow-spagyrist in the operation."</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was a trembling gasp of dismay. "I hope you know what
you are doing. Beware of over-confidence, Alessandro. This man
Mesmer is no fool. I am afraid of him."</p>

<p>Cagliostro answered her with the scornful laugh of him whose
confidence in his own powers is to be shaken by nothing human.</p>

<p>The company that assembled in the Rue St Claude that night was
some thirty strong, and as distinguished as any that the Paris of
Louis XVI could muster. There was the old Prince de Soubise, whom
an elixir of Cagliostro's had cured when the doctors were
despairing of his life; there was the handsome, stately
Cardinal-Prince de Rohan, Grand Almoner of France, who had
witnessed so many of Cagliostro's miracles that he accounted him
the most sublime of men; Monsieur de Vergennes, the Minister, was
present, and the Count d'Avrincourt with his elegant Countess; the
gay Duchess of Polignac and the Duchess of Choiseul, too, were
prominent members of that exalted gathering, all of them disciples
of the great Cagliostro.</p>

<p>Lackeys, in the Count's livery of blue and silver, ushered the
illustrious guests into the dimly-lighted laboratory, where he and
his Countess stood to receive them, and where chairs were set in
orderly rows for their accommodation.</p>

<p>At the far end of the long room, under a cowled chimney-piece,
glowed the athanor, or furnace. Beside it there was a brass-bound
tub of water. Before it stood a long table covered by a black cloth
on which there was an array of glass jars, phials, porcelain bowls,
a small clay crucible, and some further objects. Another table to
the left of the furnace was encumbered with alchemical vessels in
glass and copper, phials, retorts, alembics, mortars and the like,
and above this, at something more than a man's height, a shelf that
was similarly laden.</p>

<p>The Cardinal-Prince, who was among the last to arrive, brought
with him a dour-faced, pallid man, who derived from his funereal
garments and his black unpowdered hair something of the air of a
crow. He was presented as Friedrich Anton Mesmer, and the sturdy
Cagliostro, resplendent as a bird of paradise in a gown of yellow
arabesques upon a rose-coloured ground, beamed upon him in welcome,
and delivered himself effusively in his queer jargon of compounded
French and Italian.</p>

<p>"My poor laboratory is honoured. Your eminence must persuade
Doctor Mesmer to lend me his assistance in my little experiment.
The collaboration of so illustrious a confrère is something of
which I shall boast myself hereafter."</p>

<p>If Mesmer suspected irony, he remained outwardly unmoved. Having
come there expressly so as to unmask Cagliostro, nothing could suit
him better than this opportunity, so rashly afforded him, for the
closest vigilance. It was a satisfaction shared by the spectators,
but from opposite motives. These loyal disciples of the Grand
Copht, the men all initiates of his Lodge of Supreme Wisdom, aware
of how Mesmer had defamed him, rejoiced in the prospect of the
crushing answer they knew the Master could not fail to deliver.</p>

<p>Cagliostro drove out the servants, locked the doors, covered the
lower half of his splendours by an apron, and tossed another one to
Mesmer so that he might similarly protect his garments.</p>

<p>"All is in readiness," he announced. "Here is the mercury to be
transmuted. Examine it, Doctor, and weigh it carefully. It should
amount to exactly a pound."</p>

<p>Tight-lipped, solemn, Mesmer weighed an empty glass jar, so as
to ascertain its tare, and then poured into it the mercury,
scanning it closely as it passed from one vessel to the other.
Although the light was dim, he could not, from its behaviour, doubt
the nature of the metal. He placed the loaded jar in one of the
scales. "It weighs exactly a pound," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Let us proceed." The mystagogue took up a bottle of clear glass
in the bottom of which could be seen a minute quantity of a
grey-brown powder. He displayed it, turning the bottle about, his
every movement ritualistic. "In this we have thirty grains of
virgin earth."</p>

<p>"Of what?" barked Mesmer, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"Virgin earth," Cagliostro stolidly repeated. "Or, if you prefer
it, Secondary Matter." And contemptuously he explained: "It is
procured by distilling rainwater to the point of siccity." He
proffered it to Mesmer. "You will oblige me, Doctor, by taking one
of those empty jars, and weighing into it precisely the half of the
mercury, which you will then transfer to this bottle."</p>

<p>When it was done, Cagliostro held up a phial, containing three
or four ounces of a colourless liquid. "Give me the vessel. Observe
now that I add to the mixture of mercury and virgin earth exactly
thirty drops of this extract of Saturn."</p>

<p>The scorn fermenting in Mesmer's soul found sudden and harsh
expression. "Distilled from the planet, I suppose," he croaked.</p>

<p>The Master stood arrested, the phial poised. He turned a blank
stare upon his colleague. "But is it possible, Doctor, that your
learning stops short of the knowledge that the alchemists call
Saturn that which is vulgarly known as lead? Do not tell me, sir,
that I must talk the language of the streets so as to be
intelligible to a man of science."</p>

<p>Less the rebuff, itself, than the ripple of amusement that
stirred the company left Mesmer without an answer, confused and
mortified, whilst Cagliostro, suavely resuming his task, counted
aloud as with a steady hand he dispensed the thirty drops. Then,
closing the bottle with a stopper, he shook it vigorously before
holding it out and turning it slowly about.</p>

<p>"And now, Doctor, take another of those empty bottles and pour
into it the other half of the mercury. I thank you. Upon this too I
pour thirty drops of the extract of Saturn. Similarly I shake it
well. Now take both bottles, yourself, Doctor, and unite their
contents in this third one."</p>

<p>Mesmer, who, since his rebuff, had completely put aside his air
of derision, obeyed in nervous silence.</p>

<p>"Cover it with that stopper, and shake the mass so that it will
blend! Enough! You perceive that it has now lost its lustre and has
become a dull grey."</p>

<p>Cagliostro went aside to the shelf, reached up and took from it
a clay vessel of the size of a coconut.</p>

<p>"Here is our crucible. Be good enough now to pour the mass into
it. Now hold it out."</p>

<p>From a breast pocket the Master drew a slender parchment
envelope. He opened one end of it, and more than ever with the air
of performing a ritual he shook from it, upon the matter in the
crucible, a quantity of powder of a brilliant red. Next he dipped a
bowl into the tub of water, withdrew it half-full, and placed it on
the table. After that he went aside again to the shelf, and reached
for a square wooden box. From this, with an ivory-handled trowel,
he ladled some white plaster into the water, and leaving the trowel
in the bowl he desired Mesmer to mix it so that he might seal the
crucible with it. Whilst Mesmer was obeying, he went to replace the
box upon its shelf.</p>

<p>Under the Master's observing eye, the Doctor completed the
mixture and began to plaster the mouth of the crucible as he was
bidden. He had just succeeded in covering the aperture, when
Cagliostro, with a sudden display of impatience, snatched the
crucible from his hands. "In the name of Heaven, man, don't you see
that the mixture is too thin? Will you spoil all? It needs more
plaster. Wait."</p>

<p>With the crucible in his left hand, he turned yet again to the
shelf and reached up for the box. He came back with it to the
table. "Give me the trowel." He was brisk and peremptory. He ladled
more plaster into the water, mixed it briskly, and then slapped
coat after coat of the thicker consistency upon the crucible until
it was completely sealed.</p>

<p>"There. It is done. Behold the alchemical egg." He held it aloft
a moment, then thrust it once more into Mesmer's hands. "Take it,
my friend. Set it for an instant on the edge of the athanor to dry.
Meanwhile with the bellows I quicken the fire with which we are to
hatch it."</p>

<p>Since this hatching operation would, he announced, take a
half-hour, he placed a stool by the athanor for Mesmer so that he
might sit on guard over the crucible, when presently, the plaster
having set, he had thrust it, under Cagliostro's direction, into
the very heart of the glowing fire.</p>

<p>To beguile for his guests the time of waiting, the Master
discoursed to them in his queer Italianate jargon of the labours of
the alchemists to wrest from nature the secrets that should carry
men nearer to the gods. By way of the Kabbalists and the Arab
alchemists, he came at length, logically but with a malice, that
was presently to appear, to speak of the great Theophrastus Bombast
of Hohenheim, better known to the world as Paracelsus, who had
formed himself upon them.</p>

<p>Mesmer's accusation of plagiarism rankled with him. It
represented a debt to be repaid in kind, and it was to this
repayment that he now addressed himself.</p>

<p>"What a sublime man was that!" he sighed, in allusion to
Paracelsus. "And to what hideous persecution was he not subjected
by the envious spite of the medical faculty of his day. Of what
stupid, cruel calumnies was he not the victim! They called him the
Luther of Medicine. That was their way of branding him a dangerous
heretic. I remember him so well, that unforgettable man. It will be
two centuries and a half ago, in 1527 or 1528, that he occupied the
chair of medicine at the University of Bâle. I recall the date
because it was at about the time of the sack of Rome by the
Constable de Bourbon, and all Europe was talking of little
else."</p>

<p>Whilst his noble audience, hushed and enthralled as ever when
this Man of Mystery spoke out of the memories of his immeasurable
past, gazed upon him in round-eyed awe, Mesmer, a little behind
him, cross-legged upon his stool, twisted his thin lips into a
smile of scorn.</p>

<p>Cagliostro went quietly on, moving slowly to and fro as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"A little man he was, weakly of body, but with the strength of
soul and mind that conquers worlds. I remember how he disdained the
outward show of doctoral robe, gold chain and crimson cane. I saw
him come to his first lecture in a homely suit of grey that was
stained from his chemical experiments, a flat black cap to cover
his premature baldness, and at his side a sword that never left
him. This because once he had been a military surgeon in the armies
of the King of Sweden. The students laughed to see him. But they
did not laugh when the lecture was ended. Ah, Cospetto! No. They
had not listened to the usual trite re-hash of Galen. They had
heard revolutionary theories upon the treatment of disease, and an
odd insistence upon the cultivation of an intuitive sense which
opened a new world to them.</p>

<p>"The nights I spent at work with him in Bâle, and later at
Colmar! And if much I was able to teach him, yet there was much
that he taught me. For there was no branch of medical or alchemical
lore which he had not investigated.</p>

<p>"I am reminded by the presence of Doctor Mesmer here that it was
Paracelsus who first expounded the virtue of magnetism and
prescribed the magnet as a healing agent, thus being the inventor
of a science which men today, in their ignorance, are beginning to
call Mesmerism."</p>

<p>That stirred his listeners. But whilst de Rohan was smiling a
benign approval of the Master, Mesmer was bounding, livid, from his
stool, to roar a question. "What is that you dare to say?"</p>

<p>Thus rudely checked, Cagliostro half-turned. "You do not believe
me?" he asked in plaintive surprise.</p>

<p>"Believe you? By God! The effrontery of you!" Mesmer choked in
his wrath. "Not content with the imposture of your mummeries, you
must have recourse to calumny, it seems."</p>

<p>"Calumny! My friend!" Cagliostro's tone was shocked. "You are
overheated, Doctor. Read the <i>Herbarius Theophrasti</i> of
Paracelsus. You will find there the fruit of his experiments in
magnetism. And," he added gently, "you will realize that, as
Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun."</p>

<p>"Solomon said that in your hearing, I suppose," was the other's
furious sneer. "Where is it to be found, this book? Does it exist
at all, or is it but another of your inventions, to bolster up your
slander?"</p>

<p>The Cardinal gently interposed. "Be sure that it exists,
Monsieur Mesmer. Count Cagliostro is the possessor of a copy. I
have, myself, seen the passages to which he alludes."</p>

<p>"As you shall see them, sir," Cagliostro promised, "so that you
may assure yourself that it is possible for two gifted minds
independently to arrive at identical conclusions." Thus,
gracefully, without resentment of Mesmer's insults, the Master
opened a door by which the Doctor might escape. But it nowise
soothed the Doctor. The mischief was done, and might be
irrevocable. The very terms in which Cagliostro now went on to
exonerate him only made the matter worse.</p>

<p>"After all, Doctor, it is not for you to be offended, but for me
whom you could suppose capable of such a baseness as to defame a
colleague by imputing plagiarism to him. It was never in my mind
that you were re-cooking the scraps from Paracelsus' table; for God
knows I had no reason to suppose that his learned works were
included in your studies." Then, with an abrupt change of manner
that brushed the whole question aside, he turned to the furnace.
"But to our purpose. The egg should by now be hatched."</p>

<p>He placed an iron dish upon the table, and with a pair of tongs
seized the crucible and lifted it from the glowing embers. The
clatter with which it dropped upon the dish was as a signal to the
company. There was a scraping of chairs and a forward shuffle
accompanied by a momentary hum of talk.</p>

<p>Cagliostro smote the crucible sharply with a hammer. It cracked
across, and, as the two halves fell apart, in the heart of it was
disclosed to the awed gaze of the spectators a gleaming
ruddy-yellow ingot. The miracle of the transmutation was
complete.</p>

<p>He took the ingot in the tongs, held it forward for a moment, so
that all might behold it clearly, then plunged it into the
water-tub. When presently it was cool, he set it down upon the
table.</p>

<p>"Eminence, permit me to offer you this product of the
Philosopher's Stone, so that you may bestow its proceeds upon the
poor of your diocese."</p>

<p>"Ever as benevolent as you are munificent, Count," murmured
Rohan, whilst the company broke into exclamations of praise and
wonder. And then, abruptly, dominating all, came the harsh voice of
Mesmer.</p>

<p>"Impossible! I say it is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Sadducee!" The Prince de Soubise apostrophized him. And "For
shame, sir!" cried the Duchess of Polignac, whilst others still
more angrily rebuked him, until Cagliostro raised a restraining
hand.</p>

<p>"My friends, there is no need for heat. Monsieur Mesmer but
displays the proper scientific mind, which cautiously refuses to
accept until the last proof has been supplied." Smiling into the
Doctor's pallid furious face, he added: "My dear colleague, you
shall yourself apply the tests. I will furnish the acids, and
you..."</p>

<p>There Mesmer interrupted. "Tests? What do I care for tests? What
need for tests? I may not be an alchemist; but I am chemist enough
to know that this is an imposture; for, in the first place, it is
impossible that there should be a liquefaction of metal at the
paltry heat of that furnace."</p>

<p>"How, then, comes the gold to be present, sir?" asked Monsieur
de Vergennes.</p>

<p>"That is for Monsieur de Cagliostro to tell us," was the
answering sneer.</p>

<p>Dolefully the Man of Mystery shook his noble head; sadly his
great eyes considered the magnetist. "Oh, my friend! My poor
friend! How stout is the assurance that has its roots in ignorance!
No liquefaction at that temperature, you say. But mercury, sir, is
a fluid metal. It is already liquid whilst cold, as every schoolboy
knows."</p>

<p>"Mercury, ay. But not gold. And before gold can set into a solid
ingot as a result of transmutation it must be present in a liquid
state."</p>

<p>"Must, eh? Why must it? Does it not occur to you that therein
lies the very secret of the transmutation of a fluid into a solid?
How can you understand the release of latent forces contained in
matter when you are not even aware of their existence?"</p>

<p>"He should know something now," said Avrincourt, "since at least
he has seen the results."</p>

<p>Silenced by that alchemical jargon, stung by the ridicule of
that illustrious company, Mesmer took his departure that night from
the laboratory in the Rue St Claude, baffled, mortified, but
unalterably persuaded that he had witnessed an imposture.</p>

<p>The conclusions he reached after a sleepless night of brooding
he communicated next day to Monsieur de Vivonne, when that
unsuspected disciple of the mystagogue came to him on the pretext
of magnetic treatment.</p>

<p>"I insist," said the raging Doctor, "that the athanor, the
crucible and the rest are no more than the appurtenances of fraud,
the properties of the comedy he played. I know, if I know anything,
that no transmutation could be accomplished without at least the
degree of heat necessary to melt the metal. The lack of it betrays
the ignorance of that charlatan. His explanation was a ready-witted
impudence."</p>

<p>"But the gold, you say, was in the crucible. How came it
there?"</p>

<p>"A common conjuring trick. I must have detected it at once, but
that his calculated offensiveness had disturbed my mind and
distracted my perceptions. In the quiet of the night, going step by
step over all that happened in that laboratory, I solved it. I
remembered how he snatched the crucible from my hands on the
pretext that the plaster&mdash;which he had prepared himself,
remember&mdash;was too thin, and how he went to the shelf for the
plaster box. For a moment then his back was turned, and his body,
as he leaned forward against the side-table, acted as a screen. It
concealed his left hand and the crucible it held. Under cover of it
he changed that crucible for another, similarly half-plastered,
that stood ready behind some of the appliances littering the table.
Don't you see how simple it is? That is how this vile impostor
gulls his foolish following."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Vivonne implied that he could scarcely believe in so
much turpitude. Afterwards, with scrupulous fidelity, he reported
all to Count Cagliostro, and together they laughed over a
scepticism so obstinate and a perversity so spiteful as to produce
so stupid an invention. But to Serafina, later, when Cagliostro
reported in his turn, he did not laugh at all.</p>

<p>"That misbegotten German horse-leech will be spreading this
pretty discovery of his all over Paris. The addle-headed hysterics
who frequent his magnetic bath-tub will act as his Mercuries."</p>

<p>"You would have done better," opined the demure Serafina, "had
you let me deal with him."</p>

<p>"With him? With that frost-bitten dish-washer? That chilblain?
There's no blood in him to quicken, my dear."</p>

<p>"And what now? Something you must do to check this
mischief?"</p>

<p>"Something, yes, per Bacco! But, tell me, what? What?"</p>

<p>It was Mesmer himself who was to answer that despairing question
a week later, through the lips of the Cardinal de Rohan.</p>

<p>His Eminence sought the mystagogue in the Rue St Claude.
"Monsieur Mesmer takes his defeat very badly."</p>

<p>"I know. I know. I've heard his tale. May his malice choke the
dog."</p>

<p>"He must be persuaded of his error; persuaded of it beyond
possibility of further doubt. It is the only way to silence him,
and I am sure that you can do it."</p>

<p>Cagliostro's stocky figure seemed to assume height. He became
majestic. "Am I concerned to silence every cur that yelps at me?
Who will believe this miserable empiric, unless it be some of the
poor witlings he magnetizes, who matter nothing."</p>

<p>But Rohan shook his noble, powdered head. "It's a scurrilous
world, my friend. It delights in diminishing the great. Mesmer is
providing a weapon for the hand of malice. It must be struck from
his grasp. You must demonstrate for him again."</p>

<p>Cagliostro's eyes were hard. "That would not strangle his
mendacity."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. It will compel him, unless he could take you <i>in
flagrante</i>, to acknowledge his error, and to hold his peace. I
know of no other way in which it can be done."</p>

<p>Cagliostro moved about the chamber angrily. He vowed he was
indifferent to unbelief. He did not demonstrate for the amusement
of ignorant doubters, or for charlatans who saw tricks in
everything they could not understand. Mesmer had not only seen a
gold ingot made, he had assisted in the making of it. If that did
not convince him, it was because he did not desire to be convinced.
Cagliostro could do no more. It would be beneath his dignity.
Besides, he ended, it was not likely that Mesmer would consent to
come. He would fear to be robbed of the last pretext for his
calumnies.</p>

<p>"As for that," said Rohan, "I have enough influence to compel
him. It must be done, dear Master." He was emphatic. "I wish it.
You must not lie under this stigma, which all of us who believe in
you must share. Depend upon me to arrange the matter."</p>

<p>He departed, leaving Cagliostro to gloom in a simmer of baffled
rage upon the unresponsive images of Isis and Hippocrates that
adorned his salon. But by the time that Serafina came seeking him,
he had recovered his serenity. He startled her with the news of the
Cardinal's visit and its purpose. Her gentian eyes reflected her
panic.</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Do?" He raised his black brows; he was regal in his scorn.
"That which is expected of me, of course."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid?" She was breathless.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" For a moment his aspect was terrible. Then he laughed.
"You do not yet know the man you've married, Serafina."</p>

<p>Before so magnificent a confidence she suppressed her fears. But
they were fully alive in her again when they came, some two or
three nights later, to that second demonstration.</p>

<p>It differed in little from the first. The same distinguished
company was gathered in the dimly-lighted laboratory, saving that
now Monsieur de Vergennes was absent, and a prince of the blood,
the Duc de Chartres, a member of Cagliostro's Lodge, was present.
The same properties were provided, the fire glowed in the furnace,
and Monsieur Mesmer was there to assist, his countenance pale, his
eyes glittering with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>Behind locked doors the preparations followed the same course as
on the last occasion, with, however, one slight, yet to Doctor
Mesmer very notable, exception. When the elements had been mixed
and deposited in the crucible, Cagliostro did not, as before,
invite his assistant to plaster it, but undertook the task himself.
Taking the vessel from Mesmer with his left hand, he picked up with
his right the water-bowl, and went to place it on the encumbered
side-table. Then, still retaining the crucible, and with his back
to the spectators, he reached up to the shelf above for the
plaster-box, poured plaster from it into the bowl, and with a
trowel set himself vigorously to mix.</p>

<p>It was all most natural, and every eye but Mesmer's had
inevitably followed his right hand as it reached up. The Doctor,
however, who knew what to look for, watched the mystagogue's body,
noted how heavily and closely it leaned against the table under the
shelf; his ears caught even a tinkle of one vessel against another,
to betray a clumsiness in his juggling. With grim amusement he
observed that Cagliostro splashed a trowelful of the swiftly-mixed
plaster over the mouth of the crucible before he turned again to
continue the operation in full view of all, like a man who has
nothing to conceal.</p>

<p>"There," the Count announced at last, holding the crucible
aloft, "is the alchemical egg complete. I deliver it into your
care, Doctor, so that with your own hands you may place it upon the
athanor."</p>

<p>Mesmer, whose pale lips wore the cruel smile into which they had
curled as he watched Cagliostro at the shelf, received the
crucible, and for a long moment held it between his two hands,
making no movement. Then he spoke, and his voice was a hoarse rasp
of sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Why trouble to place it in the furnace&mdash;the athanor, as
you call it in the language of quackery?"</p>

<p>"How?" Cagliostro glared at him, and in those terrible eyes
Mesmer beheld, as he expected, a reflection of fear.</p>

<p>"How else is the transmutation to be effected?" asked someone in
indignant impatience.</p>

<p>Mesmer turned squarely to the gathering. "Transmutation! There
is no transmutation. There is a swindle, a vulgar trick of
legerdemain, and that is performed already."</p>

<p>Cagliostro reached forward in a sudden wild fury. "Give me that
crucible!" he roared.</p>

<p>But the Doctor drew back, fiercely retaining it, gathering
assurance.</p>

<p>"Ah, no. It has been entrusted to me, this precious alchemical
egg." He laughed unpleasantly. "I do not relinquish it."</p>

<p>There was a general stir of annoyance, and the Duke of Chartres
demanded what he meant.</p>

<p>"I mean, Highness, that this crucible is not the crucible that I
prepared. It has been changed. That is why it is unnecessary to
protract this nauseous comedy by subjecting it to the fire."</p>

<p>"Your spite makes you very rash, sir," cried Rohan, and after
his came other indignant protests.</p>

<p>But Mesmer coldly faced a hostility over which he was assured of
triumph. "God knows I am no gambler," he said, "but I will wager
anyone a hundred louis that the transmutation has already taken
place, that the gold ingot is already in this crucible."</p>

<p>"I'll take the wager," eagerly cried Madame de Polignac. "A
hundred louis, Monsieur Mesmer."</p>

<p>Cagliostro uttered a groan of distress, and Serafina, watching
him from amongst the spectators, felt her senses begin to swim.
Then the mystagogue was bellowing like a calf.</p>

<p>"No, no! Domeniddio! This must go no further. I will not permit
it. I will not suffer that my sublime arts should be subjected to
this prostitution. Give me that crucible, Monsieur Mesmer. At
once."</p>

<p>An icy breath of doubt in their Master momentarily chilled his
disciples as they saw him reach forth in frenzy and heard the
exulting laugh with which Mesmer again eluded him.</p>

<p>"Aha, you charlatan!" the Doctor mocked. "Exposure is upon
you."</p>

<p>He seized a flat trowel, dropped the crucible on to the table,
and by a smashing blow with the sharp edge of the tool reduced it
to fragments, crying triumphantly: "Behold!"</p>

<p>The spectators crowded forward fearfully to the table's edge,
and stood there in utter silence, gaping at the squelched grey
mud-like mass that the fractured vessel yielded.</p>

<p>Thus for a long moment. Then a terrific explosion of laughter
deafened the appalled and bewildered Mesmer.</p>

<p>Tumbled from the lofty pinnacle of his false confidence, and
shattered in spirit by the fall, the German doctor stood shaking,
limp and pallid, whilst Cagliostro fulminated with eye and tongue
to complete his annihilation.</p>

<p>"Derider of mysteries you are too base to apprehend! Defiler of
the altars of Hygeia! Buffoon! Impostor! Away to your swindling
wash-tubs and the poor hysterics upon whom you prey! Out of my
house, and never again dishonour it by your presence!" He strode
across to the door, unlocked it, and flung it wide. "Out, sir,
before I summon my lackeys to cast you from a threshold you have
desecrated."</p>

<p>Discomfited, hang-dog, wincing under the derision with which the
company belaboured him, realizing the futility now of all protests,
Mesmer was glad to be permitted to escape.</p>

<p>Later, when the last of their noble guests had departed
rejoicing in a faith confirmed, Cagliostro faced Serafina with a
grim smile.</p>

<p>"I do not think that we shall have any more annoyance from
Monsieur Mesmer, if, indeed, he survives the ridicule that will
haunt him."</p>

<p>Serafina's lovely, childlike face was blank. "I am still
trembling," she confessed, "at the risks you took. What if he had
not broken the crucible? What if, obeying you, he had placed it in
the furnace? What then would have been the end?"</p>

<p>He pinched her ear and gave her the tolerant smile of the god
for the purblind mortal. "Little pullet, why these questions? It is
the faculty of great minds, the very quintessence of their
greatness, to perceive exactly how lesser minds will function in
given circumstances. If I had not the intelligence to plumb the
shallow puddle of Monsieur's Mesmer's wit, or exactly to foresee
its workings, why then I should not be Cagliostro."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. THE GHOST OF TRONJOLLY</h2>

<p>TRONJOLLY'S meeting with M. de Saint André took place in the
courtyard of the <i>Bouc Inn</i> at Strasbourg as they were both
about to mount the diligence for Paris. It was marked by courtesies
of which Saint André was the initiator. His air of the beau monde,
the charm of manner with which he fell back in deference and waved
the other to precede him to a seat on the vehicle stirred
Tronjolly's bourgeois soul to a similar and quite unusual
courtliness.</p>

<p>Not that Tronjolly was by any means a boor. He was a
good-natured, amiable young man; of a rather clumsy habit of body,
it is true, but of a good-humoured, frank and kindly countenance.
If he was a little awkward in his manners and slow to those
courtesies which are as natural as the breath of life in the world
of fashion, it is because the world of fashion was not his world.
He was the son of an exceedingly prosperous Strasbourg merchant,
reared in a bourgeois atmosphere which neglected only those things
that do not make for efficiency in the counting-house. To Tronjolly
the elder, the counting-house was the world, the making of money
was life. He knew little of any other existence, and that little he
despised. In these religious convictions&mdash;for they amounted to
nothing less&mdash;had he reared his eldest son. And if his eldest
son was now being despatched to Paris that there he might marry a
lady whom he had never seen, you are not to suppose from this that
any such unprofitable matter as romance was in question. The whole
affair had been settled, terms discussed, charges adjusted by
correspondence like any other ledger transaction; and our rather
lumpish, amiable young friend was journeying to marry an
heiress.</p>

<p>The ostler stood back from the horses, the postilion blew a
flourish on his horn, cracked his whip, and, with cries of "Gare!
Gare!" the diligence swept out of the yard and started upon its
journey.</p>

<p>Tronjolly permitted himself to take admiring stock of the
graceful and gracious travelling companion who occupied the outside
seat beside him. He considered him carefully from top to toe, and
mentally&mdash;from force of habit&mdash;estimated his outward
worth. There was his laced hat, the furred roquelaure of
bottle-green cloth in which our gentleman wrapped his long, shapely
body against the crisp air of that bright autumnal day, the long
black knee-boots of fine leather, the jewel glittering in the snowy
ruffles of his neck, the costly lace that fell over his gloved
hands, the small sword with its hilt of mother-o'-pearl and silver.
Tronjolly was deeply impressed by the sum total of his calculations
which even then did not include, as he remembered, the sleek valet
who sat behind in charge of the gentleman's abundant luggage.</p>

<p>They made an odd contrast, these two&mdash;Tronjolly, who had
been reared in the ways of making money, and Saint André, who was
acquainted only with the ways of spending it; Tronjolly, to whom
life was earnest and stern, and Saint André, to whom it was more or
less of a jest, an adventure to be relished. Much of an age and
much of a height, with a good deal even that was similar in cast of
countenance, yet in build they compared as a greyhound with a
mastiff. Saint André wore his own hair carefully dressed and tied
into a cue with long ribbons of black, watered silk; Tronjolly
affected a bag-wig of an antiquated type.</p>

<p>Turning his head presently, his eyes drawn by the other's
scrutiny, Saint André addressed his neighbour in pleasant, level
tones: "Do you travel far, monsieur?"</p>

<p>For a moment Tronjolly was in confusion, so that he reddened and
stammered. When he recovered he replied that he was on his way to
Paris.</p>

<p>M. de Saint André's face lighted up, conveying the flattering
intimation that he was pleased.</p>

<p>"In that case, monsieur, we shall be travelling companions all
the way."</p>

<p>Tronjolly received the news in a silence which endured until it
tardily occurred to him that it would be polite to profess himself
enchanted. Having done so, he shyly asked a question. "Do
you&mdash;do you know Paris, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Know it?" Saint André's fine eyebrows were raised. He
laughed.</p>

<p>"Like my pocket. I was a student at the Sorbonne for three
years, and what a Sorbonne student does not know of Paris, my
friend..." He shrugged and laughed again, leaving his sentence
there.</p>

<p>In this manner began an acquaintance which was steadily to
improve during the six tedious days of that journey.</p>

<p>Tronjolly, finding himself out in the world for the first time,
was a little bewildered, very lonely and very ill-at-ease. He was
soon made conscious that he lacked the proper address towards all
those&mdash;ostlers, chamberlains, postilions, drawers, landlords,
and the rest&mdash;whose business it was to minister to travellers.
He was in deadly fear of being swindled, and almost as fearful of
being ridiculous.</p>

<p>Then, too, in answer to his anxious questions, Saint André told
him things about Paris which went far to increase his natural
timidity and to fill him with dread at the very thought of finding
himself alone in such an ocean of guile and wickedness. He even
began to fear Monsieur Coupri, the father of the heiress he was
going to wed. Not a doubt but that Monsieur Coupri and the family
would make him welcome. Yet it was not as if he knew them or they
knew him, and any unknown quantity connected with Paris began to
assume formidable and terrifying proportions for Tronjolly.</p>

<p>Now, it is not in the nature of a Tronjolly to carry such a
burden when confession to an amiable and worldly-wise companion
will partially relieve it. Hence followed confidences, at first
faltering and hesitant, then&mdash;being encouraged&mdash;full and
frank.</p>

<p>Tronjolly entertained M. de Saint André with an exact account of
his relations with the Coupri family, of the marriage that had been
arranged between himself and Mdlle Coupri, and of the lady's very
substantial dowry.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Saint André, "if the lady's beauty at all
matches those endowments, you are a singularly fortunate
fellow."</p>

<p>"As to that," said Tronjolly, pouting and raising a shoulder, "a
man must take his chance. I am assured that she is sound and
healthy, and not without attraction. But where the main thing is so
extremely satisfactory one must not be too expectant as to details.
As I have said, a man must take his chance."</p>

<p>"And you may take it with a good heart," laughed the man of the
world. "All marriage is a lottery, as someone has said, and you are
fortunate in your knowledge that the essentials are assured."</p>

<p>"You are not married yourself, by chance, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I?" Saint André laughed. "My friend, I am a younger son with a
patrimony too slender to suffice for my own abnormally developed
habits of expenditure. And then, too, I am cursed with
fastidiousness&mdash;a madness in a poor man. My family had
proposed to marry me to a gargoyle of a woman&mdash;a heavily
gilded gargoyle, it is true, with a title and lands and rent-roll
as long as a lawsuit. But&mdash;what would you?&mdash;I declined on
the ground that, as I have not the means to build a cathedral, I
should not know what to do with a gargoyle. My father, who has a
poor sense of humour, considered the answer offensive. People are
like that. At present I am more or less in disgrace, and I am going
to Paris to forget it and to take a holiday from my father. He is
not an adorable man at the best of times, but when offended he is
unendurable."</p>

<p>Confidence inviting confidence, Tronjolly told Saint André of
his own father, and of his family generally, and thus the intimacy
between them grew apace.</p>

<p>Paris was reached in the twilight of the sixth day of their
journey. The diligence drew up at the <i>Golden Hand</i>, at the
corner of the Rue de la Verrière, and if Tronjolly was a little
bewildered by the bustle in the yard of that notable hostelry, he
was profoundly impressed, awed almost, to hear Bercy&mdash;M. de
Saint André's valet&mdash;issuing orders for their accommodation in
a tone so arrogant that very soon there was as much scurry and
confusion at the <i>Golden Hand</i> as if a prince of the blood had
alighted there.</p>

<p>A suite of fine apartments was placed at their disposal, and
presently they dined in a blue-and-gold room above-stairs, of
splendours such as Tronjolly beheld for the first time. They were
waited upon by the sleekest of servants, under the instructions of
the capable Bercy. The supper was to Tronjolly a succession of
incredible sensations, a succession of discoveries in what could be
achieved with ordinary fish and flesh; and it was washed down by a
well-ripened, soft, velvety Bordeaux which burst into incredible
perfumes upon the palate, and left Tronjolly persuaded that until
this hour he had never tasted wine.</p>

<p>Coming from Strasbourg, as he did, he was well acquainted with
that epicurean paste that is made from the livers of diseased
geese. But it required Paris and the chef at the <i>Golden Hand</i>
to show him to what unimagined uses it can be applied. By a
fatality there was a dish of boned quails&mdash;unfathomable
mystery&mdash;stuffed tight with that toothsome paste. Tronjolly,
by nature a glutton, ate no fewer than six of those stuffed birds,
with the consequence that he was taken ill in the night. After
writhing awhile in pain on his magnificent, canopied bed, he
screamed and rang for assistance.</p>

<p>A little later, M. de Saint André was awakened by the landlord
and a grim-faced physician, who came to inform him that Tronjolly
was gravely ill, and to ask if he was related to the sufferer.</p>

<p>"Not at all, monsieur," said Saint André.</p>

<p>"You are his friend, at least?"</p>

<p>"You may call me that. We were travelling companions from
Strasbourg."</p>

<p>"He will have relations in Paris?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"From what he tells me of himself, he has none."</p>

<p>The doctor clucked in vexation.</p>

<p>"Your friend, sir, is in very grave case. He is suffering from a
very remorseless form of gastric inflammation. Had his relatives
been at hand, I must have advised you to summon them."</p>

<p>Horrified, Saint André sat up in bed. "Do you mean that his life
is in danger?"</p>

<p>The physician spread his hands. "I will do what I can. But, to
be frank, I doubt if he will be alive in the morning."</p>

<p>The event was to confirm his prognosis. Tronjolly spent the
night in delirium. Towards dawn, in a fleeting moment of lucidity,
he found Saint André in a bedgown beside him, and realized
something of his circumstances.</p>

<p>"I am very ill, am I not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You are certainly ill, my friend."</p>

<p>Tronjolly considered.</p>

<p>"They are expecting me tomorrow&mdash;M. Coupri and
Mademoiselle," he said. "Should I be unable to go, you will do me
the favour to send word to them, will you not?"</p>

<p>"I will bear them word myself," Saint André promised.</p>

<p>The unfortunate youth died a few hours later, and M. de Saint
André, profoundly troubled by the event, spent the greater part of
the morning, out of the goodness of his nature, in making
arrangements for the funeral. Having completed these, he remembered
that the Coupri family would be awaiting the bridegroom, and
determined to go at once upon his grim errand. He ordered a
carriage, and went forth dressed as he was, in his travelling-suit
and bottle-green roquelaure.</p>

<p>The carriage clattered over the Pont-au-Change, and on through a
maze of narrow streets to the more spacious Rue du Foin. It rolled
along beside the high wall of a garden, and came at last to rest
before the fairly imposing house to which the garden belonged.</p>

<p>M. de Saint André alighted, and rapped sharply on the green door
with the gold knob of his cane. It opened almost instantly and a
female servant, with a comely smiling face and almost devouring
eyes, confronted our fine gentleman expectantly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Coupri lives here, I think," said Saint André.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur." She was almost breathless.</p>

<p>"May one see him? I have just arrived from Strasbourg,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he got no further. The mention of Strasbourg was evidently
all that the girl awaited. With a ripple of laughter, she turned
and sped away from him into the house, calling: "Monsieur! Monsieur
Coupri! He has arrived. He is here!"</p>

<p>"Pst! Pst! Hi! My good girl!" Saint André called after her in
vexation.</p>

<p>But in her excitement she either did not hear or did not heed
him. And then a door flew open, and a stout little man rolled out.
He had a rosy, good-humoured face and twinkling little eyes. He
exuded bonhomie at every pore.</p>

<p>Before Saint André could utter a word of protest, the little man
had violently descended upon him, embraced him, kissed him upon
both cheeks, and was dragging him across the threshold by main
force, smothering him the while in volubility.</p>

<p>"But come in, then, come in. I was wagering it would be you when
the carriage stopped. You see it was the hour, and I knew that the
son of old Tronjolly would be as punctual as his father. Be welcome
to my house, my child. The ladies are waiting to receive you, and
Geneviève is dying of impatience to see you. Did you have a good
journey? It is a plaguy long way to Strasbourg, and on such an
errand the journey must have seemed long indeed. Youth's
impatience!" The little man laughed with a will. "Youth's
impatience!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but one moment, monsieur!" cried Saint André, disengaging
himself from those massive, clinging arms. "I haven't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;the carriage," said M. Coupri. "But Mariette
will see to it. Pay him, Mariette," he bade the grinning domestic.
"And give him a pourboire of six sous. Open-handedness is the order
of such a day as this, eh? We do not get married every day, do we,
Georges?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Saint André gravely, "there is a very important
matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure there is!" cried Coupri, exploding in laughter. "The
ladies are waiting for a sight of you. We must not keep them. It is
not gallant."</p>

<p>He flung open the door of the little salon on the right, and, to
the eyes of a dozen people assembled there in expectation, he
disclosed the elegant M. de Saint André.</p>

<p>There was a moment's staring silence, produced by M. de Saint
André's personality, his handsome figure, his fine clothes and his
air of the great world, all of which went to make upon the Coupri
family an impression very different from that which the family had
expected to receive.</p>

<p>Then an elderly but still attractive lady, whom Coupri presented
as Aunt Jeanne, sailed forward, flung her arms round Saint André's
neck, hugged him to her bosom, and kissed him resoundingly. We
conjecture that it was at this point that the spirit of mischief
prompted Saint André to accept the part which destiny and the
Coupri family were forcing upon him. Yielding, he abandoned himself
recklessly to the adventure, without thought of anything beyond the
immediate amusement which it offered. He suffered himself meekly to
be embraced and kissed by every bourgeois present, and he
discovered that one or two of the bourgeoises made the ordeal well
worth enduring. All called him Georges&mdash;which name he thought
detestable&mdash;and all gave him effusive welcome, with one
exception. This was a young man in the red coat of an officer of
the Swiss Guards, who gave himself airs on the strength of his
military rank in a notoriously plebeian corps, and who held himself
scowlingly aloof from M. de Saint André.</p>

<p>The family commented with embarrassing bourgeois frankness on
Saint André's fine clothes, on his figure, on his manner; they
described with frankness what they had expected him to be like, and
with equal frankness confessed themselves to be pleasantly
surprised by what they beheld.</p>

<p>Not until there was mention of a portrait did Saint André become
uneasy.</p>

<p>"Do you know now," said Coupri, "that I find you singularly
unlike your picture. I had expected you to be stouter, and to have
more colour. And then your hair. It was quite fair in the
portrait."</p>

<p>"I was stouter and I had more colour," said Saint André. "Also,
in effect, my hair has darkened. But then, you see, I have been
ill. It has left me like this."</p>

<p>"Ill?" It was a chorus of concern. They crowded closer round
him, tender-eyed. "Ill?" they clamoured.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that is over now. Though, of course, the fatigue of the
journey, and&mdash;and...the natural impatience consuming
me..."</p>

<p>Peals of thrilling laughter acclaimed the faltering gallantry of
these words. Then Aunt Jeanne's voice was heard.</p>

<p>"But come here, Geneviève. Come, then, my little one, and greet
your bridegroom. Do you not hear what he is saying?"</p>

<p>From a corner of the room, whither she had fled like some
frightened bird, Aunt Jeanne dragged forth the bride, all trembling
reluctance. Fresh from her convent, wrapped in her purity and
innocence, white and lovely as a budding rose, she stood before our
gentleman, long lashes veiling the fear in her blue eyes. Saint
André stared in surprise a moment; then, recovering, he bowed with
a courtier's practised grace. Geneviève replied with a curtsey,
then sidled to her aunt for cover and protection.</p>

<p>As conversation broke out again the young officer of Swiss, who
had watched the meeting of the betrothed with lowering eyes, now
begged Coupri to present him to the bridegroom. Coupri did so,
announcing the Swiss as a cousin, and left them together.</p>

<p>The officer looked the bridegroom over with an eye of cold
dislike. "Your manners, sir," said he, "are precisely what one
would expect from a Strasbourg shopkeeper!"</p>

<p>Startled, Saint André made an instant recovery. He smiled his
sweetest. "Just as yours, sir, are what one would look for in a
Swiss cowherd!"</p>

<p>It was the officer's turn to be startled. He had not expected a
rejoinder so ready and so apt. He stiffened and clicked his
heels.</p>

<p>"My name," he said, "is Stoffel. Lieutenant Stoffel."</p>

<p>"An unpleasant name," said Saint André, "but no doubt you
deserve it."</p>

<p>The soldier's eyes narrowed. His thin lips smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"I see that we understand each other," he said, keeping his
voice low. "And I am glad to see also that you wear a sword."</p>

<p>"I bought it cheap in a second-hand shop in Strasbourg," Saint
André apologized, feeling that the entertainment promised to be
more complete than he had expected. "I think it looks rather well.
Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Can you use it?" growled the Swiss.</p>

<p>"You might show me how," ventured Saint André.</p>

<p>Stoffel leaned nearer, and spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>"In the garden, then, at five o'clock."</p>

<p>He would have moved away, but Saint André caught him by the
sleeve of his red coat.</p>

<p>"A moment, mon lieutenant," he begged. "Would it be impertinent
to inquire the nature of your quarrel with me?"</p>

<p>The fire-eater sneered. "You arrive inopportunely. You are de
trop. That is all. You were rash to leave Strasbourg."</p>

<p>Then Aunt Jeanne interrupted them, leading forward again the shy
Geneviève, and followed by Coupri and Uncle Grégoire. An ill-bred,
inquisitive silence fell upon the company, and Stoffel drew
away.</p>

<p>"Let us leave the children to become better acquainted," said
Uncle Grégoire, rubbing his fat hands.</p>

<p>"Leave them!" echoed Aunt Jeanne on a note of horror.</p>

<p>Her notions of propriety were above the level of those of her
brother.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Coupri, peremptorily brushing aside all objections.
"We dine in a quarter of an hour, Georges. Geneviève will entertain
you until then. Come, my friends."</p>

<p>They departed. Stoffel going last, his powdered head very much
in the air.</p>

<p>Alone with her future husband, Geneviève sat down abruptly
without daring to look at him. Saint André lost some of his ease.
He had enough decency left to begin to regret the adventure. There
was an awkward silence, courageously broken at last by
mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"You had a good journey, monsieur?" she inquired
mechanically.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;an impatient journey, mademoiselle," said he as
mechanically.</p>

<p>She flushed, and tapped her foot. Apparently there was a spirit
behind the air of convent-bred simplicity.</p>

<p>"You said that before, I think."</p>

<p>"A truthful man is bound to repeat himself," said Saint André.
"Have patience with my lack of wit. Forgive it on the score of my
sincerity."</p>

<p>"Sincerity!" she echoed. She flashed him a glance of annoyance.
"You are sincere? It is sincere to imply that you were impatient to
come and marry a girl you had never seen?"</p>

<p>For once in his impudent life Saint André was at a loss.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there is such a thing as intuition, mademoiselle,"
he explained lamely.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur. And, of course, in your case there was even
more&mdash;there was definite knowledge. Of the amount of my dowry,
I mean. That would account for your impatience. I had not thought
of it."</p>

<p>He understood that she was angry, and that she gathered from
anger an unsuspected strength. A moment he hesitated, then instinct
prompted him to go down on one knee beside her and seek to take her
hand, what time he prepared a likely speech. But the hand was
snatched away.</p>

<p>"I am not yet your wife," she reminded him. "The transaction is
not yet complete. Delivery of the goods does not take place until
this evening."</p>

<p>His amorous words perished unborn. Instead, "Mademoiselle, you
are very cruel," he protested.</p>

<p>"Neither cruel nor kind. I am nothing. Just a bale of
merchandise that your father and mine have marketed between
them."</p>

<p>He rose awkwardly, brushing his knee. Decidedly the adventure
did not run an amiable course.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it impossible that we should love each other?"
he asked her.</p>

<p>And he confessed afterwards that in that moment he was almost
sincere, for this dainty child with the unsuspected spirit
perturbed him most unusually.</p>

<p>"Quite impossible!" said she, tightening her red lips.</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"Impossible that you should love me&mdash;that I can
understand." His voice throbbed with melancholy feeling. "But that
I should love you. Oh, mademoiselle, a little mercy, I implore you!
I could serve you all the days of my life, with increasing joy and
happiness in the service."</p>

<p>Apparently the tender words were not without effect. The fire
faded from her eyes. They became almost shy again. Seeing him
standing there, his head bowed in dejection, it is possible that
she observed, for the first time, what a very handsome head it
was.</p>

<p>"Alas, monsieur, you come too late for love!" said she.</p>

<p>"Too late!" he echoed, and then he understood "Stoffel!" he
cried.</p>

<p>Her cheeks flamed.</p>

<p>"Stoffel," she admitted. "We love each other. I tell you this
because, after all, I think I like you. You are not as uncouth as I
had expected."</p>

<p>"I understand, mademoiselle," he answered, with a tinge of
bitterness, "that I cannot hold the lists against a Swiss
mercenary."</p>

<p>"I warn you, sir, that Stoffel has sworn to me that this
marriage contract shall never be signed."</p>

<p>Saint André discovered that this annoyed him extremely. But
before he could explode, Coupri had come to summon them to
dinner.</p>

<p>At table Saint André sat moody and silent for a while. Wounded
in his vanity, deeply compromised, a duel on his hands with a Swiss
fire-eater who had sworn to kill him, he had now abundant matter
for reflection, and he began to wonder how the Tronjolly whom he
was impersonating would acquit himself in such unexpected
circumstances; whether, indeed, the Strasbourg merchant were not to
be envied at rest in his coffin.</p>

<p>Presently, however, the wine doing its work, and his volatile
nature reasserting itself, he recovered his liveliness. The more he
talked, and the brighter became the sparkle of his ready wit, the
more sullen grew Stoffel, the more fiercely the Swiss scowled at
him across the table. Geneviève watched and listened in amazement
and a growing wonder. Saint André began to feel pleased with
himself. The adventure was going none so badly after all. Then he
reflected that, nevertheless, it was high time to end it. The hour
of the contract was approaching.</p>

<p>Observing that the company began to grow torpid from excessive
indulgence, Saint André proposed to take the air in the garden for
some moments. Coupri was eager to accompany him, but Saint André
protested that he desired to be alone to collect himself against
the coming of the notary.</p>

<p>Half-way down the garden he became aware that he was followed.
Over his shoulder he caught a glimpse of a red coat, and, cursing
his pursuer, he quickened his steps towards the door in the wall
which led to the street and safety. He reached it to find it locked
and the key missing. With a stifled oath, he turned and faced the
hurrying Stoffel.</p>

<p>"You are forgetting an appointment, I think," said the Swiss,
smiling terribly.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I was remembering it," said Saint André.</p>

<p>"So indeed I might have supposed, knowing your rabbit-hearted
kind."</p>

<p>Saint André was disposed to be a little angry.</p>

<p>"I thought that was the source of your valour," he said.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. You are a man practised in arms, and you take
advantage of that fact to browbeat and to impose your will upon an
unoffending, rabbit-hearted bourgeois whom you suppose scarcely to
know point from pummel."</p>

<p>Stoffel, standing stiffly as a fencing-master, went red and
white by turns.</p>

<p>"I do not force you to fight, monsieur," he said. "You may
withdraw if you please."</p>

<p>"But I no longer please," said Saint André, unsheathing his
small sword. "You have deliberately detained me, and you must take
the consequences. I assure you that they will not be pleasant. I
await your convenience, monsieur!"</p>

<p>In a rage, the Swiss threw off wig and coat, whipped out his
sword, and, with a bellowed, "On guard!" flung himself upon the
supposed Strasbourg merchant. He was met by a guard that astonished
him, and for some few moments nothing was heard but the click-click
of their blades.</p>

<p>Saint André knew Stoffel's kind, and had not expected much. He
found even less than he had expected. He laughed as he fenced.</p>

<p>"Come come, sir!" he mocked. "Is this the best that you can do?
And against a rabbit-hearted bourgeois? Then here's to make an
end."</p>

<p>There was a slither of steel, a sharp blow of forte on foible, a
sudden wrench, and the Swiss officer stood disarmed.</p>

<p>Smiling and calm, Saint André bowed to him.</p>

<p>"Another time, mon lieutenant," he said, "make certain about the
rabbit heart, or they may mourn you in the Cantons."</p>

<p>He picked up the fallen weapon, sheathed his own, and, bowing
again, was departing.</p>

<p>"You are taking my sword!" cried Stoffel suddenly, in a choking
voice.</p>

<p>Saint André paused, and turned. He was very grave.</p>

<p>"If I return it to you, monsieur, we recommence; and if we
recommence the ending may be different."</p>

<p>The lieutenant clenched his hands, then, with an oath, he flung
aside to pick up his coat and wig. It is disconcerting when you
happen to be a fire-eater to meet a bourgeois who can play such
tricks with you.</p>

<p>Saint André walked back towards the house. Midway he met
Geneviève. She was pale and out of breath. At sight of him she
became paler, and stood still.</p>

<p>"Where is Monsieur Stoffel?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Engaged at the moment in swallowing his mortification," said
the gentle Saint André. "Otherwise he has suffered no damage. I
have brought you his sword. You may like to return it to him as a
wedding gift, though, if you really love him, you may think twice
about it, for I assure you that the weapon is a greater danger to
himself than to anyone else."</p>

<p>He bowed again, and left her gazing after him somewhat
foolishly, Stoffel's sword in her hands. On the threshold of the
house he encountered Coupri, who hailed him with the news that the
notary was expected at six o'clock with the marriage contract.</p>

<p>Saint André pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot wait, monsieur," he said.</p>

<p>"Not wait?" quoth Coupri. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You will have to excuse me, monsieur," he said, faltering a
little, in agony almost. "But I have a most important engagement to
fulfil."</p>

<p>Coupri's face was blank with astonishment. "Today?" he asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"At once, monsieur," said Saint André.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" Coupri stared. "In less than an hour the
notary will be here. Your engagement must keep, my friend."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately it is an engagement that cannot keep," Saint
André insisted.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;name of a name! I do not understand."</p>

<p>In his despair, Saint André's audacity returned, and he invented
boldly.</p>

<p>"What I have to say will no doubt surprise you, monsieur; but,
since you insist, you shall know. I arrived here last night at
dusk, and I put up at the <i>Golden Hand</i>, in the Rue de la
Verrière. At supper I ate so many stuffed quails that in the night
I was seized with cramps. A doctor was sent for, who found me to be
suffering from a grave internal disorder, of which I died at five
o'clock this morning. My funeral takes place at six o'clock this
evening, and that, monsieur, is the appointment that I must keep.
You will understand its utter urgency."</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, open-mouthed, Coupri stared at him for a long moment;
then he began to laugh. But his laughter withered before the
other's solemnity. He became uneasy, and peered at his proposed
son-in-law.</p>

<p>"You are not, by any chance..." He touched his forehead
significantly.</p>

<p>"I feared that you might think so, monsieur. Let me assure you
that I am not mad. I am just dead. Adieu, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"A moment, sir!" roared Coupri.</p>

<p>But Saint André did not wait. He slipped past Coupri, eluding
his grasping hands, snatched up his hat and cane in the hall, and
was gone from the house so quickly that by the time Coupri came
panting to the door he was already out of sight.</p>

<p>Bewildered, fuming, Coupri went back to the company and roared
out the incredible tale of Tronjolly's behaviour.</p>

<p>"Perhaps..." began Aunt Jeanne, and stopped abruptly, a scared
look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps what?" demanded Coupri.</p>

<p>"Suppose you go to the <i>Golden Hand</i> and make inquiries?"
Uncle Grégoire suggested.</p>

<p>Coupri bellowed for his hat and cane, and set out at once,
accompanied by his brother and by Stoffel, who was in a simmer of
vindictiveness.</p>

<p>At the <i>Golden Hand</i>, M. Coupri demanded the landlord.</p>

<p>"Did a Monsieur Tronjolly alight here last evening from the
Strasbourg diligence?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The landlord's face became extremely grave.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Tronjolly?" he replied. "Yes, that is so. It is true
that he alighted here."</p>

<p>Something in his tone and manner filled them with vague
premonitions.</p>

<p>"And where is he now?" inquired Coupri.</p>

<p>"Alas! messieurs, the unfortunate gentleman was taken ill in the
night, and although everything possible was done, he succumbed to a
gastric inflammation some hours later. They are burying him at the
Père-la-Chaise at six o'clock this evening."</p>

<p>"My God!" said Coupri, and sat down in a state of collapse. "It
was true, then, what he told me."</p>

<p>Three pallid men returned to the pleasant house in the Rue du
Foin with the dreadful story that a ghost had sat with them that
day&mdash;a story which spread rapidly and made no little stir at
the time. And it is not until now that the memoirs of that amusing
M. de Saint André have been discovered that we are afforded the
truth of the mysterious affair of the Ghost of Tronjolly.</p>

<p>Whether the lieutenant of Swiss was able to persuade Geneviève
that no disgrace attached to his sword since his opponent was a
supernatural one, and whether, once the Tronjolly wedding was
definitely out of the question, he was able to persuade Coupri to
allow him to become his son-in-law, are matters, unfortunately, not
now discoverable.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. THE LUCK OF CAPOULADE</h2>

<p>CAPOULADE had no illusions about his luck, just as he had no
illusions about himself. He knew that his luck was bad, just as he
knew himself to be a thief, a liar and a scoundrel. Necessity had
fashioned him. He thieved and lied and the rest because these were
the only arts by which he had found it possible to earn&mdash;ever
since he could remember&mdash;a precarious livelihood. In this he
found no reason to complain. But to be cursed with bad luck, that
was another story. There was no vice that could more seriously
trammel a man of his proclivities, as he had found. In the days of
the old régime, when he had been as dirt beneath the feet of
reputable folk, he had been, as a result of his ill luck, seldom
out of the clutches of the police. Now that all this was so
gloriously changed, and reputability laid low, the change still
profited him nothing. He did not prosper.</p>

<p>For example: He was in the sack of the Tuileries. He had brought
thence, as his share of the loot, a suit of yellow brocade laced
with gold, a pair of silk stockings, a pair of lacquered shoes with
paste buckles, a wig, a gold-hilted sword worth fifty louis, and a
purse containing close upon another fifty. He had obtained these
things from a gentleman who had no further use for
them&mdash;having been amongst those who were shot in defending the
main staircase from the mob. He had been at some pains to become
possessed of them, but at least they were possessions to which
none, in these enlightened days of liberty, equality and
fraternity, would question his absolute right. He was premature in
the assumption. His evil luck must inspire his vanity to trick
himself out in these fripperies, in this livery of base servitude.
As a result, he was beset that same night by a band of patriots,
all breathing fire and dripping blood. They mistook him for an
aristocrat, and already they had taken down a lantern to hoist him
in its place, when, in his rage and despair, he revealed by his
speech the error with which they had insulted him. For in the
matter of objugatory obscenity. Capoulade was the wonder and the
envy of the Cour des Miracles.</p>

<p>He escaped with his life, overwhelmed by the laughter of the
revolutionary mob. But the lovely suit of brocade was reduced to
tatters, and the beautiful sword with its precious gold hilt and
the purse of fifty louis had vanished from his person! It was only
to himself, he swore, that such things could happen.</p>

<p>Later his singular rhetoric won him a certain measure of
recognition. He became a Jacobin, and accounted himself at last on
the high road to fortune. But an ill-considered speech destroyed
his chances, and brought him within an ace of leaving his head in
the National Basket. Thereupon he fled from Paris.</p>

<p>Following his ill-starred destiny, he found himself in January
of the year '93 penniless and shoeless in Thouars. It will be seen
that he had not prospered on the journey. There was so little to
steal in France in those days, and that little was guarded with a
care that seemed to Capoulade an outrage upon the principles of
Liberty by which he desired to order his life, like the good
patriot that he was.</p>

<p>He was rescued from starvation and befriended by Guinard, the
kind-hearted Mayor of Thouars, and in exchange for bed and board
and raiment and a trifle of wages, was given employment in
Guinard's modest Republican household.</p>

<p>So as the "official"&mdash;"official" being the euphemism of
"servant" in the vocabulary of the Reign of Reason&mdash;Capoulade
fetched water, hewed wood, groomed the horse, brushed the coat, and
cleaned the boots of his brother-citizen, Guinard. It was
intolerable, of course, that a man of his resources, a man whom the
Republic had made the equal of any in the land, should waste in
this fashion the precious gift of Liberty that was the birthright
of every Frenchman.</p>

<p>He cursed his luck steadily and volubly, and he cursed his
benefactor, Guinard, whom he hated, firstly because Guinard
humiliated him&mdash;a free-born citizen of the French Republic,
One and Indivisible&mdash;by setting him to menial offices;
secondly, because Guinard was father to as winsome and buxom a
daughter of France as had ever perturbed the senses of Capoulade.
Presuming upon the new-found equality, leveller of all those
hateful distinctions between men which had marked the extinct age
of the despots, Capoulade, in the early days of his officialdom in
the Guinard establishment, had offered himself as a suitor for the
plump hand of the Citoyenne Mélanie. Guinard had received his
proposals with threats of physical injury, expressed in terms which
made it clear that he was by no means abreast of the times and
appreciative of the glorious change that had been wrought in human
relations. His words savoured of aristocracy, of incivisme, of
treason to the Republic and to Man. Yet Guinard was the Republican
Mayor of Thouars; he wore a tricolour scarf about his protuberant
middle, a tricolour tuft of plumes, and a tricolour cockade adorned
his cocked hat. To impeach him were a serious matter, too serious
for Capoulade, who had already been on the point of sneezing into
the National Basket through excess of Republican zeal.</p>

<p>So Capoulade nursed in secret his resentment, his hatred of
Guinard and his longing for Guinard's daughter&mdash;who
contemptuously ignored him&mdash;and patiently awaited his hour. He
grew servile, the better to mask his feelings and insinuate himself
into the heart of his employer's confidence; and being a master in
the arts of hypocrisy he succeeded completely. The good Guinard was
not astute. Soon Capoulade made the useful discovery that for all
his tricolour scarf, plumes, cockade, and Republican office,
Guinard was at heart a reactionary; that his Republicanism was no
more than a travesty assumed in order the better to serve his
Royalist friends, the insurgents of Poitou and Brittany, the
peasant-army of La Vendée.</p>

<p>All that Capoulade lacked was evidence. So he watched and
waited. One of these fine days, he was sure, this traitorous Mayor
of Thouars would carry indiscretion a step too far. Then would be
Capoulade's opportunity to become a hero in the eyes of the Nation.
And there would be good pickings when that happened: pickings that
must include this nose-in-the-air Citoyenne Mélanie, with her pink
cheeks, moist mouth and provocative breasts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he employed exemplary patience, and craftily increased
Guinard's esteem of him by sly assumptions of anti-Revolutionary
sentiments.</p>

<p>His chance came at last, early in May, a few days after General
Quétineau had come to occupy Thouars, making it his headquarters
for operations against the insurgents of La Vendée.</p>

<p>It happened that Mayor Guinard was owed a considerable sum of
money by a wine-merchant of Nantes, to whom he had lately sold some
property. He determined to set out and collect it. Further, he
determined to use the occasion to take the delectable Mélanie to
Nantes, to the home of his sister who resided there. He had yet a
third purpose to serve, which may have prompted this removal of his
daughter. He applied to General Quétineau for a safe-conduct that
should enable him to travel unmolested by the troops with which the
country was infested.</p>

<p>This safe-conduct he received together with the advice that so
as to avoid the Vendéans he had best go by way of Martigne, and
cross the Loire at Chalonnes. He set out in a little cart,
accompanied by Mélanie and this rascal Capoulade, who by now had
won his entire trust and confidence.</p>

<p>Capoulade was downcast, because of the coming separation from
Mélanie, and still more because of an indifference to his existence
so manifest that she had scarcely a word of farewell for him when
they deposited her at her aunt's.</p>

<p>His spirits revived a little at the wine-merchant's in the newly
named Rue de la République (formerly the Rue Royale) when Guinard
made trouble upon being tendered payment in assignats of the
Republic.</p>

<p>"What's this?" quoth the Mayor of Thouars in a rage, as he
fingered contemptuously the paper that represented the five
thousand livres owing to him.</p>

<p>"The currency of the nation," answered the wine-merchant,
truculently. "Every bill bears the sacred imprint of the Republic,
One and Indivisible. Dare you refuse it?" And his little black eyes
held a death-challenge.</p>

<p>Guinard thrust back his cocked hat, and scratched his head in
perplexity.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "in that pestilent part of the country
in which I have the misfortune to reside the light of Reason has
not yet irradiated the hearts and minds of Frenchmen. It will come
in time, my brother, for it is not in the power of Nature to
withstand a change so glorious. But until it comes I am likely to
starve if I am to depend upon what this paper will buy me."</p>

<p>"Paper!" roared the merchant. "What effrontery! Dare you call
this paper?" And with his fist he pinned the wad of soiled notes to
the counter.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;that to the&mdash;ah&mdash;unenlightened,"
stammered the unfortunate mayor, "it...looks like paper."</p>

<p>"Then enlighten them," said the merchant. "Bear the sacred torch
of Reason among them, and he who refuses to be enlightened&mdash;to
the guillotine with him! You will soon see with what alacrity this
money will become current in Thouars."</p>

<p>For a patriot there is no denying that the wine-merchant of
Nantes had a delicacy in veiling his threats. Guinard trembled:
Capoulade at his elbow nudged him warningly. Nevertheless he made a
last objection.</p>

<p>"You see, even here in Nantes, which, under the rule of the
magnificent Citizen Carrére, is more Republican, they say, than
Paris itself, it is impossible to obtain the full value for an
assignat. Give me another thousand livres to meet the discount,
and..."</p>

<p>"A moment," snapped the merchant. "Give me the name of any man
who refuses an assignat at its full value. Give me his name, I say;
or step round to the Préfecture with me, and name him there, and
tomorrow you shall see him making faces through the little window
of the guillotine."</p>

<p>Then he changed his tone, and made an appeal to Capoulade. "Eh,
you, <i>l'ami!</i> You look an honest man." Capoulade recognized
this for a stupendous lie and wondered what intended infamy might
lurk behind it. "Tell me now, would you not count yourself richer
by money sanctified by the Convention, bearing the emblem of the
Republic, the image of the Goddess of Reason herself, the symbol of
Universal Brotherhood, than by base coin defiled by the portrait of
the late despot, disfigured by a head which in her wisdom the
Nation has shorn away, the head of a man guilty of the crime of
incivisme? To proffer such coin is in itself a treason against the
Rule of Liberty. Ah, sacred name of a name! You agree with me. You
are a good patriot!"</p>

<p>Capoulade accepted modestly the honour thrust upon him, and gave
every reason to the fierce wine-merchant.</p>

<p>It was enough. Guinard perceived that one more refusal on his
part and this truculent fellow would do by him what he advised him
to do by others in like case. He made the best of it; after all,
money in this form had the advantage of being extremely portable;
and, now that he came to think of it, he reflected that there would
be a certain grim relish in hectoring patriots into accepting it as
legal tender.</p>

<p>So he pocketed the bills, gave the wine-merchant his quittance,
and, in company with the faithful Capoulade, who felt himself the
richer by considerable information, he departed.</p>

<p>They took a meal together at an inn, whereafter Guinard
disappeared for the best part of an hour into a room which he
hired, and Capoulade had little doubt that he was spending the time
in so bestowing the assignats as to defy the search of any brigands
upon whom they might chance on their return journey. He emerged
again to call for his cart, and he paid the reckoning with an
assignat for fifty livres, by way of experiment. The taverner was
so ill-advised as to look reluctant and disdainful. A
refusal&mdash;or perhaps a suggestion of a discount&mdash;obviously
trembled on his lips. But it was anticipated by Capoulade.</p>

<p>"You would scarcely believe, citizen-host," said he, his lean,
wolfish face wearing a doleful look, "that there are men in France
so dead to patriotism, so lost to all sense of duty to the Nation,
that they demur at accepting the paper of the Republic. We had one
such scoundrel guillotined last week in Thouars for refusing to
accept an assignat for more than seventy-five per cent of its face
value."</p>

<p>The vintner's eyes thoughtfully considered the speaker's
patibulary countenance, and made haste to approve.</p>

<p>"He was well served." And he explained his apparent reluctance.
"I hope you don't insult me by supposing me one of those. I
examined the assignat to assure myself that it is genuine. There is
so much forgery nowadays..." He shrugged to complete the sentence,
and counted out the change in full, without a murmur, whilst
Guinard was at pains to control his laughter. Later, as they
rattled out of the city in the Mayor's little cart, he patted
Capoulade's shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>"You did famously, my lad," he commended him. "My faith, there
will be some secret maledictions uttered by the patriots of
Thouars." And he laughed his jovial laugh, whilst Capoulade grinned
cynically.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, mon patron," said he, "and I'll show you how to
tame these breechless sons of dogs."</p>

<p>It was on the morrow that their adventure befell them. In the
afternoon they reached Bressuire&mdash;the stronghold of the
Vendéans. From this it will be seen that, in returning home,
Guinard had chosen the longest way round. Capoulade was entirely in
his confidence as to the reason, and he laughed his close-lipped
laugh when a surge of Royalist peasants, with the white cross in
each round hat, surrounded the cart and declared them prisoners,
being attracted by the Mayor's tricolour sash and plumes.</p>

<p>Guinard made a brief speech, in which he swore that, appearances
notwithstanding, he was as much for God and King as any of them.
His peroration was a demand to be taken instantly before M. de
Charette, the commander of the Royalist forces in the town.</p>

<p>Capoulade did not accompany his master into the presence of the
insurgent leader. But he had a very good idea of what was taking
place there; Guinard, the false Republican, was informing the
Royalists of the strength and disposition of General Quétineau's
forces about Thouars. Capoulade permitted himself to wonder what
profit he could extract from his denunciation of Guinard on their
return home, but he found his calculations hampered by the thought
that, after all, there would be no more than his own word against
Guinard's, and that&mdash;human nature being what it
was&mdash;Guinard's was likely to be preferred.</p>

<p>Presently the Mayor reappeared, accompanied by M. de Charette in
person. The Royalist leader shook hands with him in sight of all
the assembled insurgents, and commended him to their care.</p>

<p>They left Bressuire in a sort of triumph, upon which Capoulade
permitted himself the liberty of passing certain strictures.</p>

<p>"Hardly judicious, mon patron," said he. "There may be patriots
in Bressuire, just as there are Royalists in Thouars. Now a word
from them to General Quétineau, and it would go very ill with
us."</p>

<p>But Guinard was not disturbed.</p>

<p>"Pish!" said he. "By tomorrow the Royalists themselves will be
in Thouars, and Quétineau and his rabble in full flight. I tell you
there is such a breeze springing up in La Vendée as will sweep
France clear of this cloud of sansculottism. Before the summer is
out the King will be back in Paris."</p>

<p>"The King is dead," said Capoulade.</p>

<p>"The King never dies," replied Guinard in a big voice.</p>

<p>"Not even when he is guillotined?" asked Capoulade.</p>

<p>Guinard turned to regard him gravely, sorrowfully. At times this
Capoulade, so cunning at others, showed signs of impenetrable
stupidity. They were driving at a gentle pace along a road that was
cut through a forest, approaching a bridge over the river
Thoué.</p>

<p>Guinard was moved to explain this mystery of the immortality of
kingship, and he had already made an excellent beginning, when he
was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a half-dozen men from
among the trees; all looked fierce, all wore white crosses in their
hats, and all six of them carried muskets. Quite unnecessarily one
of them shouted, "Halte-là!"</p>

<p>Guinard had already halted. He sat benignly smiling upon these
and upon others like them, who came surging from the woods on
either side of the road. A young dandy, of some twenty years, in
fine clothes and a charming pigtail, but sadly in need of a shave,
stood truculently forward.</p>

<p>"Now then, canaille, render your accounts. What the devil are
you doing here?"</p>

<p>His young eyes were very fierce; his whole manner was plainly
saying, "I hope to have the pleasure of hanging you within five
minutes."</p>

<p>Guinard made him no answer in words. He took off his hat, and
removed from the lining a scrap of paper, which he presented to the
officer.</p>

<p>Having examined it the young man fell back at once, and saluted
with a flourish. "Return arms!" he barked over his shoulder, and a
line of menacing muskets was instantly lowered.</p>

<p>A few words were exchanged, the ambuscaders disappeared into the
woods again, the leaves rustled into silence, and Guinard was free
to pursue his way.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour later, just beyond the bridge over the
Thoudé they were met by a detachment of Republican cavalry. It was
commanded by Captain Duchâtel&mdash;a distinguished
officer&mdash;who, two years ago, had been a pastrycook in
Marseilles. Guinard cursed softly under his breath. The officer
drew rein, and exchanged courtesies with the Mayor of Thouars, who
was well known to him.</p>

<p>Then, looking at him attentively, with frowning brows&mdash;"You
return from Nantes by an odd way," said he, on a note of
suspicion.</p>

<p>"True," said Guinard, easily. "I made a detour at some risk in
the service of the Nation. I was pursued by some infantry some
miles this side of Bressuire, and I was fortunate to get safely
away!"</p>

<p>"You have been to Bressuire?" cried the officer in increasing
surprise.</p>

<p>"Ah, but no," said Guinard, with a wink that implied he was not
such a fool as that. "I kept clear of Bressuire by a couple of
leagues."</p>

<p>"And, save for this infantry, the country is quiet? You saw
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered the Mayor.</p>

<p>"Good." He turned to his men and waved his sabre. "Forward!" he
commanded.</p>

<p>They thundered past, over the bridge and down the forest road,
straight into the ambuscade and the death to which Guinard sent
them, and to which he would gladly have sent all the Republican
rabble of France. He did not wait for this, however. As soon as
they had ridden off he whipped up his horse, and made for Thouars
at the little beast's best speed.</p>

<p>"That was an ill encounter," he muttered, and a shiver ran
through him. <i>"Peste!</i> I had not reckoned on it. Pray Heaven
the Royalists will do their work well, and let no man come back to
tell the tale of that ambush."</p>

<p>But Heaven did not heed his prayer. Under the very walls of
Thouars he was overtaken by Captain Duchâtel's returning troop,
Half a dozen saddles had been emptied, and at least a dozen men
were wounded. Duchâtel's left arm hung useless at his side.
Nevertheless they came along now at a furious gallop.</p>

<p>"Arrest me that man!" roared Duchâtel.</p>

<p>"Me?" cried the Mayor, blenching at the thought of what might be
in store for him. "Upon what grounds, if you please?"</p>

<p>"I'll state my grounds to General Quétineau."</p>

<p>"But, name of a name, what has happened?" the Mayor demanded,
insistent in the part of injured innocence.</p>

<p>"Death has happened!" snarled the Republican, "and perhaps
treachery. Bring them along."</p>

<p>As they went, Guinard sought to reassure himself. After all,
what proof could there be that he had knowledge of the ambuscaders?
And who would believe it without proof? His excellent Republican
reputation in Thouars must count for something. The notion of his
being a traitor would be flouted by all men, from Quétineau,
himself, downwards.</p>

<p>So it was with a comparatively confident heart that he suffered
himself to be haled into the presence of the Republican
General.</p>

<p>Quétineau, a big, florid man in a blue uniform coat, white
nankeens, and Hessian boots, sat studying a map at a deal table, in
a bleak, whitewashed room of truly Republican austerity. The floor
was bare, and the only decoration of the wall was a sheet bearing
the orders of the day, with a splash of evening sunshine, like a
splash of blood, upon the whitewash.</p>

<p>He rose as the wounded Duchâtel burst into the room, followed by
his captives under guard. Whilst the captain poured out his fierce
tale of disaster, the General considered the Mayor in incredulous
amazement. He scowled and swore as he listened. But at the
suggestion that Guinard might be in communication with the
Royalists he shrugged impatiently.</p>

<p>"And what have you to say, Guinard?" he asked, never doubting
that Guinard's answer would be ready and conclusive.</p>

<p>It was; and Quétineau was on the point of dismissing the matter,
when Capoulade discovered that he had something to say.</p>

<p>He had been considering his position, and for the first time in
his life he experienced an overmastering impulse to speak the
truth.</p>

<p>He spoke it. He stated succinctly and precisely that the Mayor
had been into the town of Bressuire that morning, that he had been
closeted there with M. de Charette, that the ambuscaders had
challenged them, and then allowed them to pass when Guinard
presented a safe conduct from the Royalist commander.</p>

<p>Guinard, stricken and grey-faced, scarcely able to believe his
ears, looked at Capoulade with eyes of horror and amazement. When
the little rascal had done, a tempest of speech burst forth in that
room of the mairie. Quétineau swore, Duchâtel swore, the very
troopers swore&mdash;for in those glorious days of Equality
Republican troopers were not to be restrained by the presence of
mere officers.</p>

<p>"And why didn't you tell us this before?" blazed Quétineau at
last.</p>

<p>Capoulade spread his hands, his sharp, wolfish face thrust
impudently forward. "I was coming to tell you when we were
taken."</p>

<p>"Coming to tell us?" thundered Duchâtel. "Then why, you rascal,
did you not tell me of the trap that waited for us ahead? Why did
you allow us to ride into it?"</p>

<p>"I dared not. This abandoned slave of despots had threatened to
shoot me dead at the first word. He had his pistol ready."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" said Guinard. But none heeded him</p>

<p>"Yet a good sansculotte," was Duchâtel's hot answer, "would have
done his duty and been shot."</p>

<p>"True," answered the plausible little rascal, his voice
vibrating with noble conviction, noble intent. "I would have done
my duty to the Nation and never grudged my life as the price of
that privilege. But I perceived in time that I should have been
shot at my first word, before I could perform that duty; and had I
been shot, I ask you, Citizen-General, who would have been left to
unmask this villain?"</p>

<p>"Ah! He has reason," Quétineau agreed. "He is a good patriot."
He pointed to Guinard. "Search me that fellow."</p>

<p>"You need look no further than the lining of his hat," said
Capoulade.</p>

<p>The search, thus directed, disclosed at once that utterly
damning piece of evidence&mdash;the safe-conduct obtained from
Charette.</p>

<p>"That will be quite enough," said Quétineau. His eyes, hard as
agates, played over the quaking Mayor. "Dog!" was all he had to say
to him. Then he turned to Duchâtel. "A firing-party in the
courtyard within ten minutes." And curtly he waved them out.</p>

<p>When all had gone, Capoulade, who had deliberately lingered,
licked his lips, and blinked. A shiver ran down his spine at the
thought of the narrowness of the peril through which he had come.
But like a ray of sunshine in a dark cell shone the golden
reflection that here was his chance at last. His ill-luck was
conquered. And the thing had come upon him unawares, as Fortune's
favours ever come.</p>

<p>Quétineau looked up gloomily. "Why do you wait?" he barked. "You
have done your duty, citizen. The Nation thanks you. You can go to
the devil."</p>

<p>Capoulade thought the time had come to burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Why, what the devil's this?" stormed the General.</p>

<p>"Guinard was good to me," sobbed the rascal. "He was as a father
to me, and I have sent him to his death."</p>

<p>"Had he actually been your father, your duty to the Nation
demanded no less. You have nothing with which to reproach
yourself."</p>

<p>"I know, my General. Yet it is a hard duty that the Nation has
imposed upon me."</p>

<p>"You have discharged it nobly, citizen," the General comforted
him. "Let that thought uplift you." He sighed, infected by
Capoulade's emotion. "Alas! he was my friend, too. Yet you saw with
what determination I pronounced against him. One must suffer if
necessary for the greater honour and glory of our sacred
Republic."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I suppose so." Capoulade sniffed, and mopped his
eyes with the sleeve of his dirty coat, thereby leaving his face
dirtier than it had been before. "May I...May I beg a favour, my
General?"</p>

<p>"What is it, my brave fellow?"</p>

<p>"His poor daughter&mdash;his only child, whom he left in
Nantes&mdash;would like to know that he had been decently buried.
If I might..."</p>

<p>Quétineau understood. He was on his feet in a moment, grasping
the rascal's hand.</p>

<p>"Citizen," he said, "your feelings do you credit. I honour your
emotions and your wishes. It shall be as you desire. I desire it so
myself. After all, was he not my friend?"</p>

<p>He sat down again, and wrote the order. As he sanded it, the
window shook with the vibration of a fusillade in the yard below.
It was over.</p>

<p>Capoulade drove out of the courtyard in Guinard's trap, with
Guinard's body lying in the bottom of it.</p>

<p>He bore it home to Guinard's empty house, and there ten minutes'
diligent search discovered to him between the leathers of the
Mayor's boots the five thousand livres in assignats, which were the
reward that Heaven sent Capoulade for having so nobly discharged
his duty to the Nation.</p>

<p>Equipped with a safe-conduct from Quétineau, to enable him to
travel safely to Nantes and bear the sad news to Guinard's
daughter, Capoulade&mdash;now a man of fortune&mdash;set out upon
the morrow. He felt that the tide of his luck was but at the
beginning of its flow. In Nantes was the delectable Mélanie.
Capoulade thrilled with anticipatory delight. The girl had treated
him in the past with airs and graces little suited to the wife of a
patriot such as he was about to make her. Well, well! He would
amend all that. He had a way with women, had Capoulade; not quite a
lover's way, perhaps, but effective. If she should choose to prove
loving, good; if not, why so much the worse for her, and it might
be amusing to tame her.</p>

<p>So it was with blithe anticipations that our little rascal
entered the city of Nantes once more. It occurred to him that
before waiting upon Mélanie he would do well to render himself more
presentable. Women, he reflected, like a nice exterior, and he did
not look his best in Guinard's cast-off rags.</p>

<p>He sought a tailor, and chose with care a suit, stockings, shoes
and hat, all of the very plainest, as became a sober
Republican.</p>

<p>Fifty-five livres the man demanded for the lot. Capoulade
tendered him an assignat for a hundred. The tailor took it with a
contemptuous sniff, and presented Capoulade with five livres
change.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said he, fierce as a rat.</p>

<p>"Your change," said the tailor. "The assignat is not good for
more than sixty livres."</p>

<p>There was something so supercilious, so savouring incivisme
about this infernal dealer in clothes, that Capoulade's lofty sense
of patriotism was deeply wounded. He would waste few words upon
such a scoundrel. He thrust the bundle back.</p>

<p>"Return me my assignat," he demanded curtly.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the other, thus aggravating his
offensiveness.</p>

<p>Capoulade took the bill in his left hand. In his right he took
the tailor's beard. By this he pulled the fellow's face down until
it was on a level with his own; then into it he fiercely spat his
valediction.</p>

<p>"You want shaving, my friend. We'll see what the National Barber
can do for you with his famous razor. Just wait until I return from
the Préfecture."</p>

<p>On that he flung out of the shop in a white-heat of rage. The
scared tailor ran to the door and called him back. But Capoulade
was too angry to give heed. He took his way at speed to the
Préfecture, arrived out of breath and panted a demand for instant
audience of the Prefect. He was desired to lower his voice,
informed that the overbearing manner had disappeared from France
with the despots, all of which but went to increase his annoyance.
Presently he was introduced into the august presence of the
Prefect&mdash;a grimy fellow with a phrygian cap on a dishevelled
head, who sat in a bare room that reminded him of the one in which
he had been brought before Quétineau.</p>

<p>Capoulade smacked his assignat down upon the table. "Be good
enough, Citizen-Prefect, to tell me what that may be worth in
Nantes."</p>

<p>The functionary in silence took up the bill, fingered it,
considered Capoulade, looking him over from head to foot, pondering
his raggedness. The little rogue felt that his effrontery was
oozing away under the sluggish, bloodshot eyes of that formidable
ruffian. At last the Nation's representative condescended to
speak.</p>

<p>"Have you many more of these about you?" he growled.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" quoth Capoulade.</p>

<p>The Prefect did not trouble to explain. A couple of sansculottes
in red shirts lounged against the wall. He waved a dirty hand.
"Search him," he commanded.</p>

<p>Fearing the worst, Capoulade lost his head, and made a dash for
the door. He was intercepted, caught, searched, and his bundle of
assignats brought to light and handed to the Prefect.</p>

<p>The ruffian looked through them Then his dull eyes rested once
more upon Capoulade.</p>

<p>"You are audacious," he said. "I am sorry for you, because I
like audacious men." He sighed. <i>"Hélas!</i> The forging of
assignats is a capital offence. They will probably guillotine you.
Take him away."</p>

<p>"Wait!" screamed Capoulade. "Forged? Did you say they are
forged?" he cried, his little eyes looking big for once.</p>

<p>"That is what I said," replied the Prefect, who was now
emotionless.</p>

<p>"But I didn't forge them," Capoulade protested. He was livid. He
felt the weight of his ill-luck upon him in that moment as he had
never felt it yet. It was only to him that such things could
happen. "I can explain," he bleated.</p>

<p>"But why didn't you say so? Explain, then."</p>

<p>He explained. There was nothing for it but the truth. And the
truth, as we know, had never proved a friend of his.</p>

<p>When he had done the Prefect's brow was black and ominous. "But
this is even worse!" he cried. "You have stolen the property of the
Nation&mdash;for the possessions of a traitor are by law confiscate
to the Republic. There is less hope for you than ever. You are
certain to be guillotined." He waved his hand, and a very limp
Capoulade was assisted towards the door by the Prefect's men.</p>

<p>But the cruellest cut was yet to come&mdash;prompted by the
Prefect's vanity.</p>

<p>"It is very odd," said he, "but now that I come to look at these
assignats more closely, I see that I was mistaken. They are
genuine, after all."</p>

<p>He laughed a soft, malicious laugh, which informed the almost
swooning Capoulade of the trick which had been played upon him in
order to discover how so disreputable-looking a fellow came to be
so well supplied with money.</p>

<p>The bitterness welled up from his soul in the astonishing words
he uttered as he was flung into a prison cell: "I wonder whether my
ill luck will play me such tricks as these in the next world."</p>

<p>Nor was he comforted by the gaoler's stern reminder that the
Republic had abolished the Hereafter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. THE PASSPORT</h2>

<p>OUT of the yellow chaise, whose reeking horses reeled to a
standstill in the cobbled yard of the <i>Three Pigeons</i>
(formerly the <i>Three Kings</i>) at Pontarlier, sprang a tall,
active man, bawling "Horses!"</p>

<p>The post-boy slid from the saddle, and faced him with a
wide-mouthed grin. "It's a miracle the poor beasts be standing up.
Another furlong must have burst their guts."</p>

<p>The traveller, unheeding, continued peremptorily clamant.
"Postmaster! Horses!"</p>

<p>The aproned landlord, who was also the postmaster of Pontarlier,
emerged, thrusting aside a stable-boy. He came in a truculence that
fell from him like a cloak at sight of the tricolour sash of office
visible about the traveller's waist under the frieze greatcoat
which had fallen open.</p>

<p>"Alas, Citizen-Representative, my stables are empty, and so is
every other stable in Pontarlier. A requisition this morning took
all our cattle."</p>

<p>"How? No horses!" The dismay of the Representative's countenance
implied catastrophe. His vigour was blown out of him; his very
stature seemed to diminish. "No horses! Oh, but...Name of God! I am
in haste. In great haste. Business of the Nation."</p>

<p>The host was sympathetic. "What would you? For once the business
of the Nation must wait until your own cattle are rested."</p>

<p>"Look at them!" cried the Representative in exasperation. It was
as if he asked would they ever again be fit to travel. They stood
with heaving flanks and sodden, darkened coats, from which a steam
was rising on the chill air of that grey November afternoon.</p>

<p>"One sees well that they've not been spared," the landlord
commented. "But a good rub down, a feed of corn and a twelve hours'
rest, and you'll be on your way again. We'll make you comfortable
for the night at the <i>Three Pigeons</i>, citizen."</p>

<p>The landlord fell to praising his house, his beds, his wine, his
kitchen. The Citizen-Representative would find here none of the
lenten fare imposed by the hard times upon so many hostelries in
France.</p>

<p>Bemused, his keen, intellectual countenance dark with anxious
thought, the traveller scarcely heeded the unctuous babble. "Twelve
hours!" he was muttering in his dismay. "I ask myself by how many
hours that may be too late."</p>

<p>"Too late?"</p>

<p>The traveller supplied no explanation. "Enfin! Idle to stand
here in the cold." He shrugged, drew himself up and squared his
shoulders, a man bracing himself to face the inevitable. "Boy, see
the horses stabled. Landlord, lead the way."</p>

<p>He was brought to an inn-parlour that was cheerfully aglow from
a fire of heaped logs; a homely place, provincially but cosily
equipped, and dominated by a great dresser laden with utensils of
brass and copper, whose polished surfaces reflected the leaping
flames.</p>

<p>To excite the appetite of his distinguished guest, the landlord
recited the contents of a well-stocked larder. But either the
distinguished guest's tastes were not epicurean or else his
vexation at the interruption of his journey had robbed him of
appetite. He stood in gloomy preoccupation over the fire, his
forearm along the overmantel, his head resting upon it.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he muttered absently to that catalogue of pheasant,
venison, capon and the rest. "Anything. At your choice."</p>

<p>The host strove with his disgust. "The venison, then. It will be
longer cooking; but since you're not now in haste...You shall give
me news of it when you've eaten. And with it perhaps a flask of red
Anjou. A wine of quality. Oh, but of great quality." He paused in
vain for a reply. "Bien. It is understood, then."</p>

<p>He shuffled out in suppressed dudgeon. A curmudgeon, this
Representative, an animal. These damned Republicans were more
haughty and intractable than the aristocrats of old, and of a
peremptoriness that nothing must withstand. Here was a spoilt
darling of the rabble made sour and surly because of a delay that
probably mattered nothing. Contemptuously the landlord went to see
to the preparation of a supper in which the guest's lack of
interest had extinguished his own.</p>

<p>The Representative stripped off his greatcoat, tossed it over
the tall back of a wooden settle that was ranged beside the hearth,
sat down, and lost himself in gloomy abstraction. He was ultimately
roused from it by an approaching sound of wheels and hooves. He
sprang up, listening, eyes wide and startled; then he crossed
briskly to the window.</p>

<p>Thence he beheld a man and a woman alighting from a post-chaise
that was drawn by a pair of horses manifestly still reasonably
fresh. At the sight, something more than relief succeeded
apprehension. It occurred to him that these travellers&mdash;and he
blessed the chance that brought them&mdash;would make a longer
sojourn at the <i>Three Pigeons</i> than they suspected; for if
they would not relinquish these horses to him in response to a
courteous request, why then he would exercise his powers as a
member of the government, and requisition them.</p>

<p>He heard their approaching voices and the landlord's, and the
hollow ring of their steps on the stone flags of the passage. Then
the parlour door was flung open, and they were across the threshold
before they perceived the grimly waiting figure of its occupant.
The sight of him&mdash;his quality advertised by his sash of
office&mdash;halted them with an abruptness that was almost a
recoil.</p>

<p>The woman was the first to recover. Tall, young and beautifully
proportioned, the almost classical perfection of her face and its
delicate tint announced a rank that refused to be dissembled by the
simple bourgeois gown she wore with its muslin fichu crossed upon
her generous breast. Besides, although she dressed the humble part,
she could not act it. Humility was mocked by the proud poise of her
head, whilst the disdainful glance with which she measured the
Representative betrayed the arrogance of caste which not even at
the peril of her life could she subdue.</p>

<p>The man, as tall as the Representative and as spare, offered in
his plain brown frock the same Republican simplicity of apparel,
and wore his lank black hair hanging loose, <i>en oreilles de
chien</i>. He displayed a like simplicity in his demeanour, nor was
it assumed, for Armand de Beauval, Vicomte de Fresnay, was by
nature kindly, gentle and unaffected. He expressed it in a glad
astonishment of recognition following upon that first startled
check.</p>

<p>"Why, Vailly!" He sprang forward, proffering his hand.</p>

<p>The Representative met surprise with surprise. "If it is not
Beauval!" he exclaimed, and came a step to meet him.</p>

<p>Whilst, smiling, they clasped hands, the landlord rubbed his
own.</p>

<p>"Now that is good. No place like an inn for happy encounters.
You will all sup pleasantly together."</p>

<p>Of this, however, there was no promise in Madame's austere
frigidity. So forbidding was her expression, so scornful her
petulant mouth, that her countenance lost most of its
attractiveness. Darker still grew her brows when her husband
presented the Republican.</p>

<p>"Clotilde, my dear, this is an old friend. The
Citizen-Representative Vailly. He is from Troyes, like ourselves. A
compatriot." There was timidity in his smile, and appeal in his
eyes. "We were at school together, Vailly and I, at
Louis-le-Grand."</p>

<p>The courtly grace in the Representative's bow was observed by
Madame with a cold stare that went to increase her husband's
uneasiness. In a desperate attempt to thaw her, he added nervously:
"You've often heard me speak of Vailly. He represented the Third
Estate of Troyes in the States General, and has since become a man
of great consequence in the Convention."</p>

<p>As an appeal to her caution, as a warning that here was one whom
it would be dangerous to offend, it failed completely.</p>

<p>Vailly, who had been born a gentleman, and retained the manners
of one, despite his fall from grace, affected not to perceive a
hostility which he perfectly understood. He set a chair for her. "A
seat, Madame. Here by the fire. The weather is raw. You will be
cold." Without acknowledgment she swept past him, and went to seat
herself, spreading slim, aristocratic hands to the blaze, what time
her compressed lips and tapping foot betrayed her ill-suppressed
resentment.</p>

<p>The landlord departed, and the Vicomte, so as to conciliate this
man, a word from whom could ruin them, made excuses for her.</p>

<p>"My wife is tired, Vailly. We've had a trying journey in this
cold. Tired and anxious. You know how anxiety wears down the
spirit. Old friend, I know we are safe with you, in spite of
politics. I may be frank without fear."</p>

<p>Perceiving at once that Beauval said this in order to reassure
his wife, the Representative went generously to his assistance. "No
need, my friend. You can tell me nothing that I do not know. You
are proscribed, of course. And if I find you within five miles of
Switzerland, it is because you are emigrating. What then?" With a
shrug and a smile, he added: "I rejoice that you should have come
so far in safety, and I hope that you will complete the journey as
safely. It is certainly not I who will raise any obstacles to your
crossing the frontier."</p>

<p>"I knew it. You hear this good Vailly, Clotilde?"</p>

<p>She looked round. "I am relieved," she admitted coldly.
"Monsieur Vailly&mdash;ah, pardon!&mdash;the Citizen Vailly will
understand that I was not to guess so much forbearance in one of
his political faith."</p>

<p>"An old friendship, Madame," Vailly assured her, "should count
for more than politics."</p>

<p>"Does anything count with sansculottes?"</p>

<p>He refused to be ruffled. Her vixenish demeanour served merely
to engage his sympathies more deeply for the Vicomte. He marvelled
that with so uncompromising and imprudent a wife the man should so
long have kept his head.</p>

<p>"Political beliefs may wither and change, Madame. Not so the
friendships that we form in our early years, before doctrines are
embraced that place men in different camps."</p>

<p>"Doctrines!" Her sneer was unmistakable. "The doctrines you
profess, sir, have done that to some purpose. They have drenched
the land in blood."</p>

<p>In his dismay, Beauval moved swiftly to her side, to set a
cautioning hand upon her shoulder. She shrugged it off in
petulance.</p>

<p>"What then? Am I never to speak my mind? Am I to cringe like a
coward, and be mute? I speak as I think."</p>

<p>It was Vailly who answered her out of his compassion for
Beauval. "With safety almost in sight, Madame, discretion would be
prudent," he gently reproached her. "Having won so far, it were
sheer folly to jeopardize escape by unnecessary and excessive
frankness."</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, Clotilde," Beauval admonished her. "You
hear?"</p>

<p>But she displayed the egotist's utter intolerance of reproof. "I
hear myself subjected to impertinences."</p>

<p>Vailly chose to find this amusing. He laughed outright. "Not
impertinences, Madame. Nothing could be more pertinent than what I
have said. It is fortunate, perhaps, that the treason you so rashly
utter represents opinions which I have come to share. But it was
not the doctrines which I embraced, and for which I fought, that
were unsound. Those I still believe to be lofty and noble. They
were conceived by men of heart and brain, whose only purpose was to
uplift the groaning unfortunates, and better the lot of all
mankind. Unhappily the revolution that we made has fallen into the
control of political adventurers, of self-seeking sanguinocrats,
who have befouled our labours. For the vile tyranny of the palace
which we abolished they have set up a tyranny of the gutter
infinitely viler. I surprise you? Let me confess, then, that I have
done with the Republic; that I, too, am leaving France."</p>

<p>He may have thought by this frank disclosure to ease the
tension. He was at once to learn that his admission merely served
to increase not only her hostility but her hardihood in expressing
it.</p>

<p>"You are leaving France? Done with it, you say? Having made of
it a shambles by the anarchy of which you are an apostle, having
wrecked it, spread misery and desolation over the face of it, you
go. To us who are of the class against which you stirred up these
horrors, all that you feel called upon to say is that you perceive
your error."</p>

<p>"But that is what I have not said." His tone was gentle, the
glance of his dark eyes indulgent. "There was no error in the
conception. It is that execution has fallen into the hands of
criminals who crowded in through the door we opened so that we
might drive criminals out."</p>

<p>"We were these criminals you would have driven out. That is what
you mean." She spoke in swelling indignation, and would have
continued, but that her husband intervened.</p>

<p>"Peace! Peace!" he cried, with the vehemence of distress. "What
purpose does it serve now to recriminate?"</p>

<p>"Particularly," added the Representative, "since today we are in
the same case, you and I: fugitives alike."</p>

<p>"From the havoc such men as you have wrought," she insisted.</p>

<p>"Have it so if you will, Madame." He sighed, and turned to the
Vicomte. "I could not wish, Beauval, at such a time to embitter
this meeting by disputes."</p>

<p>"Nor could I," Beauval agreed, and then, as if in censure of his
wife's tongue, he added: "It is fortunate for us that the meeting
is with you, Vailly, and not another."</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse's sneer of contempt for what she accounted a lack
of pride was audible. Elbow on knee, and chin in her hand, she
frowned into the fire, and her foot resumed its impatient tapping.
Vailly, observing it, likened it in his mind to the tail-lashings
of an angry wild-cat. His weary eyes looked mournfully at Beauval.
He sighed.</p>

<p>"If there were any means by which I could further your escape,
believe me, I should be happy to employ them. But...no doubt you
have well provided. You will be supplied with papers?"</p>

<p>The Vicomte shook his head. "We have none."</p>

<p>"None?" The Representative frowned. "Then how do you propose to
cross the frontier?"</p>

<p>"By stealth. On foot. Avoiding roads, and keeping to the open
country and the mountains. Fortunately I am familiar with the
district. Many have crossed the Jura in safety, and so with a
little luck shall we."</p>

<p>"It has its dangers."</p>

<p>"They are slight for one so well acquainted with the ground.
Without passports we have no choice. Oh, but I assure you, I am not
seriously perturbed."</p>

<p>"Even so, hardships remain. For a man they are perhaps no great
matter. But for a lady..." He looked at the Vicomtesse.</p>

<p>"I do not ask your concern, Monsieur," she snapped.</p>

<p>"It is inevitable that I should feel it, Madame." In his
tolerance he made every allowance for the unhappy position in which
she found herself. Perhaps, too, being a man, her delicate beauty
stimulated his desire to soften this hostility. "If I could offer
help, instead of useless sympathy. If...And yet...Something I might
do. My passport is personal only to myself&mdash;a Representative
on mission to Switzerland. Unfortunately not even my office and the
deference it commands would enable me to pass both of you over the
frontier with me. But if a lady only were to accompany me, the
frontier guards would hardly find this so strange that they would
not be content to wink at it in the case of a Representative of the
Nation."</p>

<p>His tone left no doubt that this was an offer. Beauval sprang
forward eagerly, to clutch his arm.</p>

<p>"You would do that, Vailly! God reward you, my friend. It would
take a load from my heart. Alone I should face the adventure
without concern. If you take my wife with you..."</p>

<p>There she interrupted him. "Are you crazy?" Her voice was harsh,
her glance baleful. "You must be, if you can conceive so mean a
thought of me. After all, there is something that I owe myself, my
dignity, my birth."</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear," he faltered, quailing before her wrath. "All
my thought is for your safety, for..."</p>

<p>"Safety may be too dearly bought. Have you not lived long enough
to realize it? Rather than support such a proposal I should have
expected you to resent the insult of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame!" Vailly remonstrated without heat. "Insult can
exist only where there is the intention to offend."</p>

<p>"It exists in all presumption, Monsieur the Sansculotte."</p>

<p>Whilst the Vicomte turned pale with angry horror, the
Representative calmly bowed. "I make you my excuses, Madame. In my
stupidity I conceived your need so urgent that I hoped you might
overlook the unworthiness of the means by which you served it.
Forgive me." He turned more briskly to Beauval, who stood crushed
by shame and misery. "Permit me to come to what are purely my own
concerns. I am delayed here by lack of relays, and, to be frank,
the delay is not without danger. Since you will be continuing your
journey on foot I will make so bold as to appropriate your horses.
If you will give me leave I will have them harnessed to my chaise
at once. As I shall not now remain to sup, Madame will be relieved
of my...of my presence."</p>

<p>"My dear Vailly, I...I..."</p>

<p>"Not another word." The Representative was all kindly
graciousness. "By your leave."</p>

<p>As the door closed upon him, Beauval looked at his wife in pain
and reproach. "My dear Clotilde! How could you? Oh, how could
you?"</p>

<p>"Ah! And now I am to be scolded, I suppose; scolded for not
being as pusillanimous as you are."</p>

<p>"Scolded? No. But, my dear, to reject in such offensive terms an
offer so generous."</p>

<p>"You really thought I could accept favours from your
revolutionary gutterlings?"</p>

<p>"But Vailly! An old friend."</p>

<p>"It does you no credit to have friends among the rabble. Always
you disappoint me, Armand, and I suppose you always will. Even to
suggest that I should travel with this man&mdash;as what? A woman
to be leered at by the corps-de-garde at the frontier. Is that your
notion of the part to be played by your wife? Is that your idea of
manliness?"</p>

<p>He choked down a rising indignation and abased himself lest
worse reproaches should follow. Through five years of matrimony the
scolding and sneers of this headstrong, ill-natured, lovely
termagant had abused his patient nature. Always her merciless
tongue had scourged him to obey a will, that often had been no more
than a perversity. Yielding for the sake of peace, because
dissensions were loathsome to his sensitive soul, he had come ever
more inextricably under that petulant yoke. If he still ventured
now to remonstrate, it was because of the chance of safety so
wantonly and perversely lost, rather than because of the grossness
of the terms in which it had been rejected. But it was not her way
to listen when what he said opposed her. She was of those who
demand the flattery of constant agreement.</p>

<p>"What then of dignity, of proper pride?" she stormily
interrupted him. "To be sure you have none. Because of that you
have had to suffer countless humiliations. But not on that account
will I be humiliated."</p>

<p>"When one is born a lady it is not necessary to be so conscious
of it," he protested wearily. "All my concern was for your
safety."</p>

<p>"My safety? Why are you not frank? Why not confess that your
concern is for your own safety? A woman would hamper you in this
trudge across the Jura. Do you think I don't understand? You would
travel more quickly and safely alone. That is it. That was all your
selfish thought. Why do you scowl at me? Am I wrong, perhaps? Have
I not always been the victim of your selfishness? Of that and your
stupidity, and never more than now when a man of wit is
needed."</p>

<p>He flung out a hand in distraction. He knew that reasoning would
be vain; that no argument would persuade her against what she had
chosen to think. "Tell me, then, what a man of wit would do."</p>

<p>"Are you quite a fool, Armand?" She stood up suddenly. Her eyes
glittered with sudden inspiration. "This man, this rascal, this
Citizen-Representative, possesses papers that will pass him
anywhere. He is on mission, he said, to Switzerland. He also said
that the frontier guards would not account it odd in a
Citizen-Representative to travel with a lady of pleasure. That was
the noble part you had in mind that your wife might play. Very
well. I'll play it if you will play the
Citizen-Representative."</p>

<p>He frowned bewilderment. "Play the Citizen-Representative? What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for a man of a little understanding! Possess yourself of
his papers, you fool. We can travel in safety under the shelter of
them. That is what I mean."</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded. "That is merely mad." He shrugged his
ill-humoured scorn of the suggestion. "How could it be
accomplished?"</p>

<p>"You carry pistols. Are they merely for adornment?"</p>

<p>"God of God! What are you suggesting? Am I to kill a man so that
I may rob him? Is that whither I am to be led by this pride, this
dignity, of which you boast?"</p>

<p>But she was no longer heeding him. Her glance had strayed to
Vailly's greatcoat, where it lay tossed across the back of the
wooden settle. Abruptly she crossed to it, flung it inside out, and
disclosed a bulging inner pocket. From this she pulled a bulky
leather wallet. With swift fingers that trembled in their
eagerness, she ran through the contents, despite the muttered
protests of Beauval, and drew forth at last a sheet headed by the
emblems of the Republic, One and Indivisible.</p>

<p>"Here it is. His passport. 'Let no man hinder...'" she was
reading, when he broke in, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Bah! The description, then?" He chose that line of objection as
the likeliest to save argument.</p>

<p>Feverishly she read it out: "'Hair, straight and black; eyes,
dark; complexion, olive; nose, hooked...' You possess all these.
'Height, one metre seventy.' That is about your height. It all
fits."</p>

<p>Defeated along that line, he fell back upon the real
objection.</p>

<p>"You can really think of turning thief?" His voice was thick
with horror. Her answer was a stare of amazed anger, whilst he ran
on: "Is this the wit you promised? A fine return for the toleration
he has shown us, for his offer of assistance. And the folly, the
futile folly of it! When he discovers the theft..."</p>

<p>"Your pistols can prevent that. Or does your courage
falter?"</p>

<p>"Courage? Courage to do murder?"</p>

<p>She was flung into raging disgust. "This is war, you fool! This
man represents the enemy. It is his life or ours."</p>

<p>"That is not even true. Our plans are sound, and we will keep to
them."</p>

<p>"When we have this?" She flourished the passport. "Can't you
understand that it makes our escape easy and certain?"</p>

<p>There was loathing in his glance. "At the price of murder. I am
to buy our safety by murdering an old friend, one who, despite all
differences, is ready to help us now. That would be noble. Would it
not?"</p>

<p>"Is it more noble to sacrifice your wife? You have to choose
between me and this precious friend. Choose whether you'll see me
dragged back to Paris and the guillotine, or raise your hand
against this gutterling?"</p>

<p>"How you distort the facts!" he cried out in despair.</p>

<p>"Distort them? Don't you see that this is a chance sent us by
Heaven? Will you neglect it in your weakness as you have neglected
so many? Act the man for once."</p>

<p>"The assassin, you mean."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Armand. If you refuse I shall not take another
step with you." Stridently she raved on: "Understand me. I
refuse&mdash;definitely refuse&mdash;to go tramping through the
Jura mountains. I would rather go back to Paris at the risk of
being guillotined. That, at least, would put an end to a life of
which your cruel disregard of me has made me weary. I swear it. Now
take your choice."</p>

<p>Often had he hated her for bending him to detested courses by
her headstrong, egotistical perversity, which could be combated
only by means repulsive to his gentle nature. But never had he
hated her as now, for the cruel coercion she was exercising. His
knowledge of her unyielding stubbornness did not permit him to
doubt that she would execute her threat. To spite and punish him,
did he deny her, he judged her capable of laying her head under the
knife; and the courage, with the lack of which she taunted him, was
the courage to let her do it.</p>

<p>Livid, agonized, he stood before her and beat his brow with his
clenched hand. Then a thought arose, to supply an argument that she
might understand: "Don't you see that to pistol him would bring the
place about our ears? Our doom would then be certain."</p>

<p>The petulant mouth was curved in disdain. "How your weakness
finds pretexts! There are other ways. Silent ways. You have your
hands. You claim to be strong. Must I tell you this? Must I always
think for both?"</p>

<p>He strove against her dominance. "It is impossible. Impossible!
Clotilde, my dear." He approached with intent to essay the
persuasion of caress. Sensing it in his tone, she drew away. She
remained sternly practical.</p>

<p>"You had better decide before it is too late."</p>

<p>"What you ask is unthinkable," he still protested.</p>

<p>"But it is not unthinkable to leave me in danger."</p>

<p>"You exaggerate the danger, and I leave you in none that I do
not share with you."</p>

<p>"I am to comfort myself with that!" And then, abruptly, her
tactics changed. She was in tears. "Always it has been the same,"
she complained. "Always. From the hour I married you. Your folly
and your weakness have spoilt my life. Always have you opposed me.
Had you had a thought for me you would have emigrated months ago,
when I first urged it, when all sensible men were doing so."</p>

<p>"Clotilde! Were they all fools and weaklings, then, who remained
to suffer?"</p>

<p>"I am not concerned with them. I did not marry them. I married
you."</p>

<p>"Alas!" he sighed.</p>

<p>That stayed her tears, and revived her fury. "So! And now you
insult me. And in such an hour as this. Oh, it is brave, it is
gallant, to mock a poor, weak woman. How detestable you are. But
how right not to protect me. I am better dead."</p>

<p>"Hush, Clotilde! Hush!" the distracted man implored her.</p>

<p>She was hushed, however, not by his prayer, but by the sound of
Vailly's returning steps. In panic her shaking hands thrust the
passport into her bosom and returned the wallet to the pocket of
the greatcoat. Her fumbling had scarcely completed the task when
Vailly came in, announcing that his chaise was ready, and the
landlord already waiting to speed him.</p>

<p>He had cast off the gloom that earlier had enveloped him, and
seemed a man transfigured. His glance, moving from one to the other
of them, noted their odd look of strain, noted that Madame was
trembling. A moment he hesitated, smiling a little. Then, in a tone
almost apologetic, "I wonder," he said, "whether, upon second
thoughts, Madame would avail herself of the offer I had the
temerity to make. If so, I am entirely at her service, to carry her
to Neuchâtel, where you, Beauval, would rejoin her."</p>

<p>This time her refusal was in more courteous terms. "You are very
good, Monsieur." Her voice had a queer, strangled sound. "But the
Vicomte and I are resolved to go together."</p>

<p>He made a little gesture of regretful dismissal. "So be it. It
remains, then, only to wish you a safe journey."</p>

<p>He moved past them, to take his greatcoat. They saw him check
and stare, and following his glance their fearful eyes beheld the
betraying signs of Madame's tampering. The garment lay reversed, as
in her haste she had left it; the inner pocket was displayed, and
from this a third of the wallet was protruding.</p>

<p>Their cringing furtiveness seemed to supply an answer to his
sharp, questioning glance. With tightening lips he drew forth the
wallet and set himself to inspect its contents.</p>

<p>Within the space of a single heart-beat, Beauval perceived the
abomination to which he was committed by the rash abstraction of
that passport which now rested in the bosom of his wife. As he saw
the matter, and without time to weigh it, he conceived that he had
now no choice. At however repugnant a cost he must prevent a
discovery which could result only in ruin and death for her as for
himself. Within the space of that same heart-beat, standing as he
did by the dresser behind the Representative, his hand had closed
upon a heavy brass candlestick, and, with all his strength, using
the utensil as a bludgeon, he had brought it down upon Vailly's
head.</p>

<p>The Representative's knees bent under him, and without a single
cry he sagged down, senseless, at their feet.</p>

<p>For one breathless moment they stood gazing in awe upon the
fallen man. Then the Vicomtesse spoke.</p>

<p>"Thank God that for once you have acted sensibly." But her
quavering voice and ashen face belied the stout cynicism of her
words.</p>

<p>Appalled by his instinctive act, Beauval went down on one knee
beside the unconscious Representative. "At least, God be thanked,
he lives," he announced in relief.</p>

<p>"Then we've the less time to waste. Come! Stir yourself. Let us
go."</p>

<p>"Go? Ah, yes." He stood up. He glanced stupidly at the
candlestick which he still held. He flung it from him in sudden
horror. "I shall always hate myself for this," he cried. "Why did
you put it upon me?"</p>

<p>"Will you rant now, when every second counts? Here!" She caught
up Vailly's greatcoat, and thrust it upon him. Half-dazed under
that dominance to which he yielded whilst detesting it and her who
exercised it, he struggled into the garment. She raised the wide
collar, so that it muffled him to the ears; she pressed down upon
his brows the Republican's round, shadowing hat. "Come," she
commanded. "Come! Don't you yet understand? The Representative's
chaise is waiting at the door. You are now the Representative, and
you have persuaded me to travel with you."</p>

<p>Still bewildered, anguished, he suffered her to lead him forth,
leaving all initiative to those active, imperious, remorseless wits
that forgot nothing.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause whilst she locked the parlour door
and withdrew the key. "That will delay anyone who comes, and
prevent Vailly from following if he recovers too soon. By the time
they discover him we shall be upon our way, and there are no horses
with which to follow us."</p>

<p>They reached the doorway leading to the yard, where the landlord
waited. Masterfully she thrust her muffled husband on towards the
waiting yellow chaise, the post-boy already in the saddle.</p>

<p>"I am accompanying the Citizen-Representative," she announced.
"My brother remains with you until tomorrow. He will pay you for
your trouble."</p>

<p>Beauval, dissembled in Vailly's greatcoat and hat, had climbed
into the vehicle. With her foot on the step, she gave her orders to
the postilion. "You'll take the road to St Sulpice, and remember
that the Citizen-Representative is pressed. So do not spare the
horses."</p>

<p>She sprang in, the landlord slammed the door, the postilion
cracked his whip, and the yellow chaise rolled out of the yard and
took the way through the town at rocking speed.</p>

<p>She fetched a deep sigh of relief as she sank back, her pulses
throbbing. "It is done. Thank God I can think for both of us. You
see how easy it all proved."</p>

<p>"Easy, indeed." He was bitter. "God forgive me. And you."</p>

<p>"Of course you will still be repining. What a weakling you are!
Where would you be without my wit and my courage? On your way to
the guillotine by now. Yet without the grace to thank me, you must
even grumble." She fumbled at her breast and drew forth Vailly's
passport. "Take it."</p>

<p>Mechanically he took it. "You do not give a thought to Vailly's
case," he said. "Like ourselves, he was in flight. This theft will
doom him."</p>

<p>"Why should it? Let him tramp across the Jura as we were
prepared to do. Although I dare say you would still prefer that
your wife should suffer that hardship."</p>

<p>"You forget that he does not know the mountains. Or perhaps you
do not care."</p>

<p>She did not account this worth an answer, and silence fell
between them. His affection for her, which her termagant spirit had
long since impaired, had now been utterly slain by the odious deed
into which her conduct had surprised him. And so for a couple of
miles or more they rode without another word. Already they were
more than halfway to the frontier-post, when, to a growing thud of
hooves behind them, was added a shout at which the chaise slowed
down and drew to a standstill.</p>

<p>Madame thrust her head from the window. "What is it, oaf? Why
are you stopping?"</p>

<p>The postilion turned in the saddle, to point back with his whip
as a troop of dragoons swept up. An officer drew alongside the
chaise and halted. His leer, of a Republican impudence, drove the
Vicomtesse to sit back. His head came to the window. "Who are you?"
he demanded, and added in the same breath: "Your papers, if you
please."</p>

<p>Beauval roused himself. He proffered the passport. "Vailly,
Representative on mission to the Swiss Republic," he announced
shortly.</p>

<p>To this Madame must be adding: "The Representative is in
haste."</p>

<p>"So the landlord of the <i>Three Pigeons</i> told me."</p>

<p>"You are not to delay us," she warned him.</p>

<p>"Am I not, citoyenne?" There was a humorous insolence in his
tone. At his elbow a sergeant was chuckling. He scanned the
passport, then folded it, and thrust it into his pocket. "You've
given us a long chase, Citizen Vailly. I began to fear we were too
late to catch you. I have an order for your arrest on a charge of
treason to the Republic. You'll return with me to Paris. And,
faith," he added jocularly, "we may as well take the lady also,
lest you should feel lonely." He waved to the postilion. "Put
about, my lad."</p>

<p>As they were wheeling round, the Vicomtesse roused herself from
her stupor. "Wait! My God! Wait! There's a mistake."</p>

<p>But the officer had gone; the dragoons were closing about the
chaise. She clutched the arm of the Vicomte, who sat singularly
unmoved. She shook him frenziedly.</p>

<p>"Rouse yourself, fool, rouse yourself! Tell them there's a
mistake."</p>

<p>To her increasing horror, he actually laughed. "Can you suppose
that it would avail us? And, after all, why trouble? They'll
discover the mistake for themselves when we reach Pans. But comfort
yourself, Madame. Your wit and your courage will not be wholly
wasted. They will have served, at least, to save Vailly's life."
And then the undertone of mockery that seemed to rumble in the
voice of that long-suffering man gave itself full vent. "How Vailly
will laugh when he discovers what has happened!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. THE RECOIL</h2>

<p>FOUCHÉ, foxy of face, under an already thinning thatch of reddish
hair, drooped his eyelids and bent his supple back before the
whirlwind of the First Consul's wrath. His cadaverous countenance
remained a mask, the thin, bloodless lips faintly curved in a smile
that was inscrutable.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, a lean, active young figure, in the gold-embroidered
old-rose consular coat of David's designing, restlessly paced the
lofty room of the Tuileries, snarling and grunting in rage.</p>

<p>"I am, then, to be beaten to death like a dog in the streets,
whilst your imbecile police is chasing phantoms," was the burden of
his complaint.</p>

<p>It was a week after that attempt on his life by means of the
infernal machine in the Rue St Nicaise, with which it had been
hoped to blow him to perdition. But the carriage of the First
Consul, who was preserved for higher destinies, had driven past the
danger-point a few minutes too soon. And whilst the explosion had
made a shambles of the street, the intended victim had continued on
his way to the Opéra, to attend the first performance of Haydn's
<i>Creation</i>.</p>

<p>The escape had been near enough, however, to leave the First
Consul shaken in spirit if sound in body, and Fouché, his Minister
of Police, was brought to realize how hot could be the blast of a
Corsican temper. But Fouché, fish-like in temperature and
temperament, was not warmed by it.</p>

<p>"St Regent and Carbon are not phantoms," he answered in his
cold, precise voice. "I not only hold them, but I've wrung
admissions for them that permit me to insist that this is a Bourbon
plot."</p>

<p>Bonaparte, snarled at him in Italian. "Coglione! You are of
those who can always find what they seek. Not phantoms? No.
Scapegoats. Scapegoats served up to deceive me. But you don't
succeed." The splendid hazel eyes smouldered with scorn. "If you
weren't at heart what you are, Fouché, you'ld not try to persuade
me that it's not the work of your cursed Jacobin friends. They want
to bring back the Revolution. And you know it."</p>

<p>Fouché shrugged his narrow shoulders. "They might succeed, First
Consul, if you obstinately refuse to see where your peril really
lies. That is to say they might if they were indeed active. But
they're a poor, negligible gang, too crippled to move. No. No. For
your own sake accept my word for it that it's the monarchists we
should watch, with particular attention for your friend Delavigne.
He shall have a domiciliary visit, and we'll go through his papers.
It should be interesting."</p>

<p>Bonaparte looked at him without affection. "How hard it is for
you to forget that the days and ways of the Terror are over, and
that laws are to be respected. Where is the evidence to justify you
in such a step?"</p>

<p>Fouché grinned. "The domiciliary visit should produce it."</p>

<p>If this was a jest, Bonaparte was not amused. "You are futile.
Are you ignorant of, or do you forget, the financial assistance
Delavigne has rendered me? Does that look as if he were a
monarchist plotter?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not ignorant, and so little forgetful that I remember
some things that you, First Consul, have never known about this
man. For instance, you have never realized that if he supplied you
in your need with funds, it was in the hope of being given the
control of public affairs. That ambition of this financier, who
from being a grocer's assistant has become a munitioneer and a
multi-millionaire, you persist in frustrating. Now that he realizes
that your government offers him no chance of rising to the
spectacular and profitable eminence of his dreams, he turns his
attention to one that may."</p>

<p>Bonaparte stared at him. "Pish! Surmise. Pure, simple
surmise."</p>

<p>"Certainly pure. Certainly not simple. And of a logic&mdash;ah,
of a logic not to be denied. A logic based on the premise that men
do not do good for its own sake. Prudence strongly dictates this
domiciliary investigation."</p>

<p>"I forbid it." Bonaparte was peremptory. "Do you understand? I
forbid it."</p>

<p>Again Fouché shrugged. "First Consul, your eyes are filled with
the dust of the half-million you owe him."</p>

<p>This merely exasperated Bonaparte. "You make phrases. But I am
not fooled by phrases. Say what you will, I perceive in the debt a
proof of his attachment to me. Am I to allow you to harass my
friends so that you may cover up the tracks of your own? Until you
can bring me some better evidence than your assumptions I refuse to
permit Delavigne to be molested." Curtly, in dismissal, he added:
"There is no more to say."</p>

<p>Fouché sighed. "Bien! But if you tie my hands, at least don't
blame me when another bomb bursts under your feet."</p>

<p>"It won't if you look to your Jacobins. Make your investigations
among that carrion. That's all."</p>

<p>The minister brought his heels together and bowed. "First
Consul!"</p>

<p>In Fouché, however, deference and submission were never more
than external. His was a heart that held no man in awe or
reverence, and whilst content to seem a servant, it was in his
nature to play the master, and to be guided by no judgment but his
own.</p>

<p>Back in his office at the Ministry on the Quai Voltaire, he sent
for Desmarets, who was probably the ablest of all his agents.</p>

<p>"What of Delavigne?" he asked. "Have you learnt anything
more?"</p>

<p>"Little enough, Citizen Minister." Desmarets was a dark, stocky
man of thirty, with the head of a Roman emperor. "But this I know:
that he is in correspondence with someone across the Rhine; at
Ettenheim, I understand. His couriers come and go regularly between
here and Strasbourg."</p>

<p>Fouché sat back and brought his lean finger-tips together. His
low-lidded eyes were veiled, as if he had withdrawn into himself.
"Little enough, you say? Come, come, Desmarets. That's not very
intelligent, or don't you know that the Duc d'Enghien lurks at
Ettenheim?"</p>

<p>Desmarets made a startled movement. "What are you suggesting
Citizen Minister?"</p>

<p>"That one of these couriers had better meet with an accident.
Then we shall know with whom this financier corresponds, and to
what purpose."</p>

<p>"It could be contrived. But would it not be simpler and more
profitable to pay him a visit, and go through his papers?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. But the rascal enjoys the protection of the First
Consul. Bonaparte will not allow us to act without evidence. I
cannot move him."</p>

<p>Desmarets smiled. "A burglary is no more difficult to commit
than a highway robbery."</p>

<p>At this sly hint Fouché's eyelids, so like the membrane of a
bird, rolled slowly back from his pale eyes. "A happy thought,
Desmarets. Contrive it. But cautiously. Remember the First Consul's
prejudices." He seemed to sneer. "They must be respected."</p>

<p>Now it happened that Desmarets' was not the only inspiration to
burgle the financier's mansion in the Faubourg St Germain. An old
associate of Delavigne's lean days, a rascal, it must be confessed,
named Lessart, was being driven at about that time to the same
course by the financier's brutal indifference to his
necessities.</p>

<p>The Revolution, which had reduced so many wealthy families to
penury, had supplied unparalleled opportunities of swift fortune to
the scoundrels who had known how to profit by them. Of these was
the sometime provincial grocer's assistant, who from that humble
state had blossomed, none quite knew how, into an army contractor,
and in a few short but militarily busy years had amassed a fortune
computed at upwards of a hundred millions.</p>

<p>To Lessart it had occurred that a man so fantastically wealthy
would never miss a gift that would make an old friend independent
for life, and that for the sake of old times, when he and Delavigne
had taken it in turns to sweep out the shop, he would never refuse
it.</p>

<p>Lessart, you see, had his illusions about humanity, and it was
to surprise him that Delavigne should by no means take the same
simple and natural view. When, after great difficulty, he had
penetrated to the august presence of that great man in his
softly-carpeted, luxurious mansion in the Faubourg St Germain, it
was only to realize that Delavigne's chief anxiety was to be rid of
him again.</p>

<p>There was no warmth in the financier's professions of pleasure
to see this friend of his youth, or in the regrets to observe that
he did not appear to have prospered too well. If there was anything
Delavigne could do for him, Lessart must let him know; but he
begged Lessart to be brief, for he was submerged in affairs and
pressed for time.</p>

<p>Lessart, small, lean and shabby, shifted his feet in their
broken boots, and with a leer on his crafty, pinched face,
considered the opulent, portly, powerful figure, in which it was
difficult to discover traces of the starveling he had known but a
few years ago. He whined a confession that he was without
resources; he reminded Delavigne of how they had loved each other
in the past, and he prayed God that some of that love still
lingered in the great man's bosom to move him to commiserate an old
friend's distress.</p>

<p>Delavigne consented to be moved, but not to the extent of
offering a half-million or so to mend the suppliant's indigence.
What he offered him was an assignat for ten livres, and he offered
it in the consciousness of being generous. It was a consciousness
that Lessart could not share.</p>

<p>"This," he reflected gloomily, "will perhaps buy me a
dinner."</p>

<p>What he really meant was that it would do no more. But there
were moments when the astute Delavigne was dull.</p>

<p>"Eat it with a good appetite, my friend," he said, and
condescended, with his fat white hand, to slap the ragamuffin's
shoulder. "And now be off, for I am busy."</p>

<p>He tinkled a handbell, and Lessart, disillusioned and
thoughtful, was shown out by a Swiss doorkeeper in a glittering
livery.</p>

<p>Inevitably he came again, a week later, and Delavigne, on the
point of having him flung into the street, checked on the thought
of a need which Lessart might serve.</p>

<p>"Look you, my lad," he told him. "If you come for alms, I've
nothing for you; but if you choose to earn a few louis, I can give
you work."</p>

<p>It was not a proposal that Lessart found attractive. Work was
the last thing he sought. He mistrusted his capacity for disposing
of it. Being hungry, however, he thought that he had better learn
more about it.</p>

<p>"It's a simple, courier's job. You will carry a letter for me to
Strasbourg. Put up at the <i>Stag Inn</i>, and ask the landlord to
send for Monsieur Fritz. Now pay attention. When Monsieur Fritz
comes, you will tell him that the vines are bearing well this year,
and he should answer you that the vintage will be a good one. By
this you will identify him, and only then will you deliver my
letter. After that you will remain at the <i>Stag</i> until he
brings you the answer, with which you will return at once. Above
all, you will regard your mission as confidential, and breathe no
word of it to anyone. You'll be paid five louis and, of course,
your expenses. You understand that I employ you for old times' sake
and in order to help you. I shall expect you to be as diligent as
any of my regular couriers."</p>

<p>Lessart had his doubts of the pretended philanthropy. The whole
affair, with its injunctions of secrecy, and its passwords about
vines and vintages so suggestive of Delavigne's own name, was
curiously mysterious. It required no great astuteness to lead
Lessart to the suspicion that he was being employed because it was
less likely to connect him with Delavigne than any of the couriers
known to be in the financier's regular service. It was not,
however, for the needy Lessart to refuse a chance to earn five
louis at the cost of so little labour, with perhaps a little more
to be made out of the expenses. Nor did it prove to be merely a
matter of a single journey. A second followed immediately, and
another after that, and Lessart realized that he had fallen upon
what amounted to regular employment. Making on an average a weekly
journey, he was kept constantly coming and going between Paris and
Strasbourg.</p>

<p>He would not have been the man he was&mdash;and Delavigne should
have thought of this&mdash;had he not sought to learn more of this
business and of the rude-mannered, mysterious Monsieur Fritz, who
obviously was, himself, no better than a messenger. So in the dusk
of a December evening, when his employment had lasted a couple of
months, he cautiously trailed Monsieur Fritz across the Rhine and
all the way to an inn at Ettenheim.</p>

<p>Now, even Lessart was aware that Ettenheim was reported a hotbed
of Bourbon intrigue, and that one of the Bourbon princes, the Duke
of Enghien, was known to be in residence there. It was natural that
he should wonder whether Delavigne might not be dabbling in some of
the Bourbon plots that were rumoured to be stirring. But just as
natural that on second thoughts he should dismiss the notion,
remembering how notoriously bound to the existing government was
Delavigne by the financial assistance he had rendered it. Such,
indeed, was the man's devotion to Bonaparte that&mdash;as Lessart
had seen&mdash;a copy of David's heroic equestrian portrait of the
First Consul crossing the Alps occupied the place of honour on the
walls of the financier's study. Nevertheless Lessart would be
watchful, and his cunning little eyes were keenly observant of
Delavigne on his return from that particular journey.</p>

<p>The eagerness in which the financier broke the seal of the
letter was no more marked than usual. But Lessart saw, or thought
he saw, the bloated face turn pale, and fancied that the man's
breath quickened as he read its contents. Certain it is that
Delavigne was plunged into such absorption that, as if Lessart's
presence were forgotten, he suddenly left the writing-table, at
which he had been standing, and purposefully crossed the room,
towards the portrait of Bonaparte. Abruptly he checked, and looked
over his shoulder at Lessart, as if suddenly aware of him. His
voice came harsh and vibrant, shaken by some excitement.</p>

<p>"Well? Why do you wait?"</p>

<p>"You had not dismissed me."</p>

<p>"Ah! You can go. Come again at this time tomorrow."</p>

<p>Lessart bowed himself out. But he went no farther than the other
side of the door, and through the keyhole saw Delavigne standing
before the David portrait, fingering the side of the frame. Then,
on an unsuspected hinge, the picture swung like an opening door,
revealing a second door in the wall behind it, into which Delavigne
fitted a key.</p>

<p>Although Lessart had now discovered all that he could reasonably
expect to discover from his present point of observation, he would
still have lingered had he not been disturbed by a sound of
approaching footsteps. He had no sooner straightened himself and
turned than Frambois, Delavigne's splendid Swiss doorkeeper,
appeared on the threshold of the ante-chamber.</p>

<p>The Swiss eyed him sharply as he stood there, his air not
altogether innocent. "You are leaving, Citizen Lessart?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Just leaving. Yes."</p>

<p>Sheepishly Lessart crossed the ante-chamber and departed. He
went off to brood over the knowledge gained and how to turn it to
account.</p>

<p>This had happened two days before the attempt to blow up the
First Consul in the Rue St Nicaise.</p>

<p>On the following morning, whilst Paris was agape and stricken,
Lessart presented himself to Delavigne.</p>

<p>The financier's pallor and preoccupation suggested that he fully
shared the Parisian horror. He glared at Lessart out of
blood-injected eyes. "I didn't send for you. What do you want?" he
growled.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten you told me yesterday to come again this
morning," Lessart reminded him, and then he drew a daring bow at a
venture. "I thought you would be wanting me to carry news of the
event to Ettenheim." His tone was charged with sly implication.</p>

<p>Beyond a momentary parting of his thick lips, a momentary
dilation of the eyes, Delavigne gave no sign that the shaft had
gone home. But it was a long moment before he found his voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" A frown of annoyed bewilderment was
darkening now his brow. "What do you mean? Ettenheim? And to what
event do you allude?"</p>

<p>"Why, to what happened last night in the Rue St Nicaise. You
know well enough that I mean that, Delavigne."</p>

<p>Contempt, real or assumed, twisted the financier's lips. "You're
drunk, I suppose. Go and put your head under a pump and cool your
brains. Get out."</p>

<p>"Not so high and mighty, my friend. Suppose now that I were to
go as far as the Quai Voltaire and the Ministry of Police. You
wouldn't like that, would you?"</p>

<p>Delavigne heaved himself up in a towering rage, a great quaking
mass of a man. "Are you threatening me with something? By God, you
offal, is that your return for the charity you've had from me? Get
out of my sight, and if ever you dare to come here again I'll have
you flung in the gutter for the filth you are."</p>

<p>It was in Lessart's mind to say a word about that secret
cupboard behind the picture. But Delavigne gave him no chance. He
advanced like a charging bull upon the wizened little rascal. "Out!
Do you hear me? Out, before I break the bones of your mangy
body."</p>

<p>Lessart, who had a horror of physical violence, fled before this
incontinent threat of it, pursued by the irate financier as far as
the ante-chamber, where the Swiss was on duty. "Frambois," roared
Delavigne, "fling me that scoundrel into the street!"</p>

<p>Outside on the pavement Lessart cursed himself for a fool. He
had played the game clumsily. He should have held his tongue until
required to carry another letter to Strasbourg. Then he would have
been in possession of a trump card, and that damned munitioneer
would have been forced to come to terms with him. His cursed
precipitancy had lost him this lovely chance of growing rich at a
stroke.</p>

<p>But the spite begotten of his frustration took him nevertheless
to the Quai Voltaire. There he saw one of the agents of Fouché,
who, after the manner of the professional spy in dealing with the
amateur tale-bearer, sucked him dry and then kicked him out.</p>

<p>And that is how the knowledge of Delavigne's correspondence had
come to Desmarets, and through Desmarets to Fouché.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lessart, the foiled outcast, virulently inveighed
against his luck, against Delavigne and against the Minister of
Police, who, among them, had defrauded him. When he had cursed his
fill&mdash;which did not happen until a couple of days
later&mdash;he reflected. After all, he possessed knowledge, and
knowledge, he knew, was power. He had not told the police quite
everything. The brutality of the agent had checked his disclosures
before he had mentioned Delavigne's secret repository, and it was
brooding upon this that suggested to him how the lost chance might
be repaired.</p>

<p>His sense of an injury to be avenged and the prospect of wealth
to be acquired supplied him with the necessary courage, and so, on
a cold January night, he set about turning to good account his
acquaintance with Delavigne's mansion.</p>

<p>He made his way soon after midnight through the streets of that
residential quarter, empty and silent at that hour. Beyond a patrol
on its rounds and a shivering wretch who approached him with a
whine for alms he met no one in the Faubourg until he was within a
hundred yards of his destination. Here, however, just as he had
driven off the beggar with a snarl of curses, being heartily and
shrilly cursed in return, he was passed by a big man, wrapped to
the nose in a rough greatcoat, who greeted him by name. As chance
would have it he had just come within the spread of light from a
street lantern.</p>

<p>"Good night, Citizen Lessart."</p>

<p>Startled, he stood arrested, peering after the bulky figure that
marched unconcernedly on to merge into the gloom. It was Frambois,
the doorkeeper, going home from his place of employment.</p>

<p>That recognition left Lessart standing for a long moment shaken
and undecided. His first impulse was to postpone the enterprise to
another night. Upon reflection, however, he perceived how little to
be feared was discovery: for if he found at Delavigne's what he was
confident of finding, the financier would be at his mercy. So he
went on, and seeing Delavigne's mansion all in darkness, he slipped
into the short garden and, after a last survey, cautiously
approached the house.</p>

<p>The three windows of Delavigne's study were at no more than a
man's height from the ground. By the middle one, with a silent,
speedy skill that suggested some experience, Lessart effected his
entry.</p>

<p>Behind the heavy plush curtains he stood a moment, listening and
recovering the breath of which excitement rather than exertion had
robbed him. Not a sound disturbed the stillness of the house.
Carefully he parted the curtains and stepped into a room made
faintly visible by the glow from the lingering remnants of a fire.
A fuller survey followed by the light from the dark lantern with
which he came equipped. The room was in disorder, presenting signs
of a hasty, reckless search. One of the drawers of the
writing-table stood open. Papers protruded from another, and papers
were strewn there about the floor, and again at the foot of a press
which had been left ajar. These matters, suggestive of a hasty
search, claimed, however, no more than passing attention from
Lessart. He moved swiftly over the thick carpet that muffled his
steps, going straight to the portrait.</p>

<p>It was some moments before his fingers, groping carefully along
the frame, discovered the spring that released the catch. He swung
the picture on its hinges, and faced the real difficulty. The door
now disclosed was of iron, and, of course, it was locked. Prepared
for this, Lessart had come armed with a cold chisel. He contrived
to wedge the tool between the edge of the door and its iron frame,
and bore upon it with all his strength. The frame yielded a little,
so that he was able to thrust the chisel deeper. Then, suddenly,
with a report like a pistol shot, the lock yielded to the
leverage.</p>

<p>Lessart sucked in his breath in terror at the noise, and stood
frozen, listening, with the sweat in beads upon his brow. Only
after moments in which no sound save the ticking of the buhl clock
on the overmantel disturbed the house did his startled nerves cease
quivering.</p>

<p>The door of the cupboard stood open. He flashed his light into
its recesses. On the topmost shelf there were leather cases such as
might contain jewels. The next, below, was divided into three
compartments, each of which was packed with papers. Below this
again there was an iron drawer. Lessart pulled it open, to be
dazzled by the yellow gleam of gold. It was filled almost to the
brim with louis&mdash;two or three hundred of them&mdash;more than
Lessart had ever seen at any one time together.</p>

<p>He went to work like a practical man. Whatever passport to gold
might be contained in the papers could wait until he possessed
himself of the actual gold here ready to his hand. He placed his
lantern upon the floor, pulled out the drawer, lowered this also,
and went down on his knees to transfer the louis by handfuls to his
pockets. They chinked as he handled them, and more than once a coin
slipped from his trembling fingers, to ring as it fell back upon
the mass of its fellows. But the sounds, however loud they might
seem to the furtively working man, were not, he knew, such as to
penetrate beyond the closed door.</p>

<p>At last it was done, and then, when with heavy pockets he stood
up to give his attention to the real object of his search, the room
was suddenly suffused with light.</p>

<p>With an audible gasp Lessart swung round and shrank to a crouch,
his rat's eyes blinking at Delavigne, who, monstrous in bed-gown,
nightcap and slippers, filled the doorway, holding a candle-branch
aloft.</p>

<p>Conceiving that his last hour might well be at hand, Lessart,
crouching ever, edged instinctively away towards the hearth.
Delavigne's heavy sluggish glance moved from him to sweep over the
disorder of the room. It came at last to the forced repository and
dwelt there for a moment. There was no expression on his great
face. He took a step forward and paused softly to close the door by
which he had so noiselessly entered. As deliberately he went to set
down the candle-branch upon the writing-table, and only then did he
speak. But whilst his tone was fierce and bitter, he contrived to
keep it almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>"So it's you, you sewer-rat," he said.</p>

<p>Lessart, his wits sharpened by danger, received illumination. He
perceived the reason for the soft closing of the door, the muted
voice. Consciousness of what the repository contained made
Delavigne fearful of allowing even his household to become aware of
it. Hence not only did he not dare to summon help, but his anxiety
was to avoid noise that might arouse the house. Perception of this
went far to restore some of Lessart's courage.</p>

<p>"You carrion!" Delavigne was growling. "You foul spy! This is
the return for the good of which I was liberal to you."</p>

<p>"Liberal! You, liberal?" Lessart snarled back. "You made me earn
your paltry pay at the risk of my neck, and you had me flung out of
doors when I asked to be properly rewarded."</p>

<p>"When you tried to blackmail me, you energumen. And it's to find
the means for it that you break into my house. Already you've found
too much for the peace in which I like to sleep o'nights. There'll
be the cheap funeral of a burglar in your quarter, you dog."</p>

<p>He advanced upon Lessart, his hands in the pockets of his
bedgown. Lessart, watching him warily, saw his right hand come from
his pocket bringing with it a short life-preserver, a thing of
plaited leather to cover a flexible handle and the knob of lead
attached to it. With all his ox-like strength Delavigne aimed at
Lessart's head a blow that must have brained him had he not dodged
it with lightning swiftness. Instinctively, in that evading
movement, he stooped, and the suddenness of it brought him off his
balance and down upon one knee. The hand he put out to save himself
closed upon a heavy ornamented poker of steel and chiselled
brass.</p>

<p>For what followed the rascal's reflexes were answerable. Whilst
there was intelligence behind the action, there was no actual
design. With a sudden upward swing he crashed the poker across
Delavigne's face, and sent him reeling, to fall at full length and
lie inert. There was, however, conscious will enough in the fury in
which Lessart sprang upon the fallen man, the bestial fury that
followed upon his release from terror's grip. Again and yet again
he swung the heavy fire-iron, and brought it down on the
financier's skull. In his blind rage he would have battered it to a
pulp, but that as he raised his weapon for the third time, his arm
was palsied and his blood frozen by a quiet voice speaking just
behind him.</p>

<p>"This is an obscenity, my lad. Must you glut your rage? Be
content to have killed him. Besides, the noise you are making! You
will rouse the house."</p>

<p>On one knee beside the body, Lessart instinctively hunched his
shoulders, as if to protect his head; then fearfully he looked
round and up.</p>

<p>Behind him, almost over him, stood a stockily built man in a
tightly buttoned black riding-coat and a sugar-loaf hat. The
shaven, swarthy face was of a stern cast, powerful of jaw, with a
high-bridged nose set between cold eyes. The lips were tightened in
a faint, grim smile.</p>

<p>It was a moment before Lessart resolved the mystery of that
apparition. Then he perceived it in the set of the heavy curtains
to the northernmost of the room's three windows. From close-drawn
that they had been, they hung now with a wide gap between them.
Lessart perceived the explanation of the disorder in which he had
found the room: the gaping drawers, the strewn papers. It must be
the work of this intruder, this thief, whose search he had
interrupted by his advent and who had taken cover behind those
curtains.</p>

<p>"A nasty mess for you, my lad," was the man's soft comment.</p>

<p>Lessart's voice came shrill and husky from parched lips.
"You...you saw how it happened. I struck in self-defence."</p>

<p>"Sh! You fool!" he was softly admonished. "Quiet! There has been
noise enough."</p>

<p>Subdued, yet still vehement, Lessart repeated: "I struck in
self-defence. You saw. You heard. He would have killed me."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it might bring you to the guillotine."
Astonishingly the fellow added: "I shouldn't linger here if I were
you."</p>

<p>Lessart stood erect, glaring in bewilderment, to ask at last:
"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Does that matter?"</p>

<p>"Faith! I needn't ask. You're a thief, a housebreaker."</p>

<p>"And that shocks you, of course; with the dead man's gold in
your pocket. Ah, well, as you don't like my company there's nothing
to detain you." Suddenly the soft voice became peremptory. "Away
with you, you fool, whilst you may."</p>

<p>But undersized rat though he might be, Lessart did not lack for
tenacity. He hesitated. It was in his mind to propose a compromise,
to offer to go halves with this grim-faced housebreaker in the
remaining contents of the repository. There might be a fortune in
those jewel-cases. Then a glance at the body at his feet brought on
a momentary nausea. A full sense of his peril came up like a tide
to overwhelm all else. At any moment they might be discovered.
There had been some noise. Servants might have been aroused. He
said so, in a dozen broken words.</p>

<p>"Very true," he was coolly answered. "But take no thought for
me. Be off."</p>

<p>Lessart required no further persuasion. Let this rash fool
linger if he would, and be destroyed by his greed. He shrugged his
narrow shoulders, and, moving swiftly on tiptoe, he crossed the
room and dropped from the window.</p>

<p>He reached the gates, and the deserted, silent street, and there
he paused, looking back. Between the parted curtains of Delavigne's
study he could see the light and the moving shadow of the man who
had so temerariously remained to plunder. Resentment stirred in his
mean soul. The fellow might yet reap the richer harvest, a harvest
exposed to him by Lessart's own activities, a harvest which
consequently belonged to Lessart himself. The papers, it was true,
were worthless now that the man who must have paid handsomely for
their recovery was dead. But any one of those jewel-cases might
easily contain more value than all the gold which Lessart had
pocketed. He conceived himself swindled by that cool scoundrel who
had reared the bogey of the guillotine so as to scare him away.</p>

<p>It would serve the rascal right if he were caught with the body.
From this it was but a step to the reflection of what might follow
if he were not so caught. There would be a hue-and-cry for the
murderer, and Lessart was suddenly cold with horror to think how it
might lead straight to himself. He had remembered that inopportune
meeting with Frambois. The Swiss would be sure to bear witness that
he had seen Lessart in the neighbourhood at midnight and would add
an account of how last he had been flung out of the financier's
house. Perhaps this might not be enough to prove him guilty of the
murder, but if that other burglar were discovered there with the
body that fellow's head would certainly be the one to roll into the
basket. And if that should happen, Lessart need shiver no longer as
he was doing now with the dread of being brought to answer for the
death of Delavigne. That burglar's capture would make him safe;
safe to take his ease and spend without fear of questions the gold
that was straining his pockets.</p>

<p>Whilst he lingered, considering how his profit might lie in that
event, the gleam of a lantern and the steady tramp of an
approaching patrol stirred him to perceive how easily it might be
contrived.</p>

<p>With a chuckle he went to meet the corporal and two National
Guards.</p>

<p>"Hi!" he hailed them. "There's a robbery being committed, I
think. I've just seen a man enter a house by a window." He led them
back, and drew the corporal's attention to the line of light
between the parted curtains. "That way he went."</p>

<p>"The house of the Citizen Delavigne!" said the corporal. "Sacred
name!"</p>

<p>They entered the gates. "Tread softly," Lessart advised, and
obeying him they reached the window in silence.</p>

<p>The gap in the curtains revealed the intruder standing before
the secret cupboard. The corporal waved his men through the window
and drew Lessart to follow with him. Only when he stood within the
room did the corporal see the body on the floor, nor needed that
Lessart should point to it, chattering, "Look! Look! There's been
murder done."</p>

<p>At the repository the burglar, already in the grip of the
guards, had slowly turned. He was holding some papers that he had
taken from their hiding-place. His hard glance fastened upon
Lessart.</p>

<p>"You've come back, then," was his cool, staggering comment, and
he laughed. "That was scarcely wise."</p>

<p>The corporal, at last able to see the man's face, recoiled with
a cry of surprise. "Citizen Desmarets!"</p>

<p>Lessart was already chilled by a perception that here all was by
no means as he supposed it, when Fouché's agent spoke again. "You'd
better take that rascal, corporal. You'll find his pockets stuffed
with the dead man's gold."</p>

<p>In Fouché's room on the following morning Desmarets laid before
the minister a sheaf of documents proving Delavigne's treasonable
correspondence with the Bourbons and containing evidence enough to
bring a dozen heads to the guillotine.</p>

<p>As he looked through letter after letter that confirmed his
convictions of the real identity of the conspirators, there was a
tight-lipped smile on the livid face of the Minister of Police. At
the end he looked up, frowning.</p>

<p>"Touching this fellow Lessart: What I don't understand,
Desmarets, is why you were allowing him to get away."</p>

<p>"In a sense I felt I owed him something. He had discovered for
me that receptacle of Delavigne's treasures, so cunningly hidden
that I might have pulled the house down before finding it. Then he
and Delavigne were birds of a feather, scoundrels both, and
Delavigne certainly meant to kill him; so that he may be said to
have acted, as he claimed, in self-defence. My real reason,
however, was that at that stage, being still without the evidence
of Delavigne's Bourbon correspondence, I was anxious to be rid of
the rascal before any disturbance might rouse the house, and so
prevent me from obtaining it. For I knew that if I were caught
there before I had got the evidence we should have trouble with the
First Consul. Unfortunately for Lessart, I couldn't explain all
this to him, and so the poor fool was caught by the recoil of his
own rascality."</p>
