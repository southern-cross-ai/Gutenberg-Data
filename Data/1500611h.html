  <h2><a id="b4b"
     name="b4b"></a>BOOK IV. WITICHIS.<br>
  <i>Continued</i>.</h2>

  <h2><a id="b4b-24"
     name="b4b-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">Thanks to the precautions taken by Procopius, the trick had
  succeeded completely.</p>

  <p>At the moment in which the flag of the Goths fell and their King was taken
  prisoner, they were everywhere surprised and overpowered. In the courts of
  the palace, in the streets and canals of the city and in the camp, they were
  surrounded by far superior numbers. A palisade of lances met their sight on
  all sides. Almost without an exception the paralysed Goths laid down their
  arms. The few who offered resistance&mdash;the nearest associates of the
  King&mdash;were struck down.</p>

  <p>Witichis himself, Duke Guntharis, Earl Wisand, Earl Markja, and the
  leaders of the army who were taken prisoners with them, were placed in
  separate confinement; the King imprisoned in the "prison of Theodoric," a
  strong and deep dungeon in the palace itself.</p>

  <p>The procession from the Gate of Stilicho to the Forum of Honorius had not
  been interrupted.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the palace, Belisarius summoned the Senate and decurions of the
  city, and took their oaths of allegiance for Emperor Justinian.</p>

  <p>Procopius was sent to Byzantium with the golden keys of Neapolis, Rome,
  and Ravenna. He was to give a full report to the Emperor, and to demand for
  Belisarius the prolongation of his office until Italy had been completely
  tranquillised, as could not fail to be the case presently, and afterwards, as
  had been the case after the Vandal wars, to accord him the honour of a
  triumph, with the exposure of the King of the Goths, as prisoner of war, in
  the Hippodrome.</p>

  <p>For Belisarius looked upon the war as ended.</p>

  <p>Cethegus almost shared this belief. But still he feared the outbursts of
  indignation amongst the Goths in the provinces. Therefore he took care that,
  for the present, no report of the manner in which the city had fallen should
  pass the gates; and he pondered upon some means of making use of the
  imprisoned King himself, to palliate the possible renewal of national feeling
  in the Goths.</p>

  <p>He also persuaded Belisarius to send Acacius, with the Persian horsemen,
  to follow Hildebad, who had escaped in the direction of Tarvisium.</p>

  <p>In vain he tried to speak to the Queen.</p>

  <p>She had not yet fully recovered the effects of the night of the
  earthquake, and admitted no one. She had even listened to the news of the
  fall of the city with indifference. The Prefect gave her a guard of honour,
  in order to make sure of her, for he had great plans in connection with her.
  Then he sent her the sword of the King, accompanying it with a note.</p>

  <p>"I have kept my word. King Witichis is ruined, you are revenged and free.
  Now it is your turn to fulfil my wish."</p>

  <p>A few days later, Belisarius, deprived of his constant adviser Procopius,
  called the Prefect to an interview in the right wing of the palace, where he
  had taken up his quarters.</p>

  <p>"Unheard-of mutiny!" he cried, as Cethegus entered.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"You know that I placed Bessas, with the Lazian mercenaries, in the
  trenches of the Gate of Honorius, one of the most important points of the
  city. Hearing that the temper of these troops was insubordinate I recalled
  them&mdash;and Bessas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Refuses to obey."</p>

  <p>"Without reason? Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"A ridiculous reason! Yesterday the term of my office expired."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"And Bessas declares that since midnight I am no longer his
  commander!"</p>

  <p>"Shameful! But he is in the right."</p>

  <p>"In the right! In a few days the Emperor's reply will arrive, according to
  my wish. He will naturally, after the conquest of Ravenna, again appoint me
  as commander-in-chief, until the war is ended. The news may be here the day
  after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps still sooner, Belisarius. At sunset the watchman on the
  lighthouse of Classis announced the approach of a ship coming from Ariminum.
  It appears to be an imperial trireme. It may run into harbour at any hour.
  Then the knot will be loosened."</p>

  <p>"I will cut it beforehand. My body-guard shall storm the trenches and
  strike the head off the obstinate Bessas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the entrance of Johannes.</p>

  <p>"General," he cried, "the Emperor is here! The Emperor, Justinian himself,
  has just anchored in the harbour of Classis."</p>

  <p>Cethegus involuntarily started. Was such a thunderbolt from a clear sky,
  such a whim of the incalculable despot, after such toil, to overthrow the
  almost perfect structure of his plans?</p>

  <p>But Belisarius, with sparkling eyes, asked:</p>

  <p>"The Emperor? How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"He comes himself to thank you for your victory&mdash;never was such
  honour done to mortal man! The ship from Ariminum bears the imperial
  flag&mdash;purple and silver. You know that that indicates the actual
  presence of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"Or of a member of his family," interposed Cethegus thoughtfully, and once
  more breathing freely.</p>

  <p>"Let us hasten to the harbour, to receive our Imperial master," cried
  Belisarius.</p>

  <p>He was disappointed in his joy and pride when, on their way to Classis,
  they were met by the first courtiers who had disembarked, and who demanded
  quarters in the palace, not for the Emperor, but for his nephew Germanus.</p>

  <p>"At least he sends the next in rank," said Belisarius&mdash;consoling
  himself&mdash;to Cethegus as they went on. "Germanus is the noblest man at
  court. Just, incorruptible, and pure. They call him 'The Lily of the Swamp.'
  But you do not listen to me!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon! but I saw my young friend Lucius Licinius in the crowd of people
  who are approaching us."</p>

  <p>"Salve, Cethegus!" cried Lucius as he made his way to the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to free Italy! What news from the Empress?" asked Cethegus in a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"Her parting word, 'Nike!' (Victoria), and this letter," Lucius whispered
  just as softly. "But," and he frowned, "never again send me to that
  woman!"</p>

  <p>"No, no, young Hippolytus, I think it will never again be necessary."</p>

  <p>They had now reached the quay of the harbour, the steps of which the
  Imperial Prince was just ascending. His noble form distinguished itself from
  the crowd of splendid courtiers who surrounded him, and he was received by
  the troops and the people with imperial honours and cries of joy.</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked keenly at him.</p>

  <p>"His pale face has become still paler," he remarked to Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Yes. They say that the Empress, because she could not seduce him, has
  poisoned him."</p>

  <p>The Prince, bowing his acknowledgments to all sides, had now reached
  Belisarius, who greeted him reverently.</p>

  <p>"I return your greeting, Belisarius," said the Prince gravely; "follow me
  at once to the palace. Where is Cethegus the Prefect? Where is Bessas? Ah,
  Cethegus!" he said, grasping the latter's hand, "I am glad to see again the
  greatest man in Italy. You will presently accompany me to the granddaughter
  of Theodoric. To her belongs my first visit. I bring her gifts from Justinian
  and my humble service. She was a prisoner in her own kingdom; she shall be a
  queen at the Court of Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"That she shall!" thought Cethegus. He bowed profoundly and said, "I know
  that you are acquainted with the Princess already. Her hand was once destined
  for you."</p>

  <p>A flush rapidly spread over the cheek of the Prince.</p>

  <p>"But unfortunately," he answered, "not her heart. I saw her here years
  ago, at her mother's court, and since then, my mind's eye has beheld nothing
  but her picture."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is the loveliest woman on earth," said the Prefect quietly.</p>

  <p>"Accept this chrysolite as thanks for that word!" cried Germanus, and put
  a ring upon the Prefect's finger.</p>

  <p>They entered the door of the palace. "Now, Mataswintha," said Cethegus to
  himself, "now a new life begins for you. I know no Roman woman&mdash;one girl
  perhaps excepted&mdash;who could resist such a temptation. And shall this
  rude barbarian withstand?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Prince had partially recovered from the fatigue of the
  voyage, and had exchanged his travelling dress for a state-costume, he
  appeared, with Cethegus at his side, in the throne-room of the great
  Theodoric.</p>

  <p>The trophies of Gothic valour still hung on the walls of the lofty and
  vaulted hall. On three sides ran a colonnade; in the middle of the fourth
  stood the elevated throne of Theodoric.</p>

  <p>The Prince ascended the steps of the throne with dignity. Cethegus with
  Belisarius, Bessas, Demetrius, Johannes, and numerous other leaders, remained
  standing at a short distance.</p>

  <p>"In the name of my Imperial master and uncle, I take possession of this
  city of Ravenna and of the Western Roman Empire," said Germanus. "To you,
  magister militum, this writing from our master the Emperor. Break the seal,
  and read it before the assembly. Such were the orders of Justinian."</p>

  <p>Belisarius stepped forward, received the letter upon his knees, kissed the
  seal, rose, opened it, and read:</p>

  <p>"'Justinian, Emperior of the Romans, Lord of the East and West, conqueror
  of the Persians and Saracens, of the Vandals and Alans, of the Lazians and
  Sabirians, of the Huns and Bulgarians, the Avarians and Slavonians, and
  lastly of the Goths, to Belisarius the Consul, lately magister militum. We
  have been acquainted by Cethegus the Prefect with the events which led to the
  fall of Ravenna. His report will, at his request, be communicated to you. We,
  however, cannot at all agree with the good opinion, therein expressed, of you
  and your successes; and we dispense you from your office as
  commander-in-chief. We order you by this letter to return at once to
  Byzantium, to answer for yourself before our throne. We can the less accord
  you a triumph, such as you received after the Vandal wars, because neither
  Rome nor Ravenna fell through your valour; Rome having freely capitulated,
  and Ravenna having fallen by means of an earthquake, which was a sign of the
  anger of the Almighty against the heretics, and against highly suspicious
  actions, the harmlessness of which you, accused of high treason, must prove
  before our throne. As, in consideration of former merit, we would not condemn
  you unheard&mdash;for East and West shall celebrate us to all time as the
  King of Justice&mdash;we refrain from arresting you as your accusers wish.
  Without chains&mdash;only bound by the fetters of your own self-accusing
  conscience&mdash;you will appear before our Imperial countenance.'"</p>

  <p>Belisarius reeled; he could read no further; he covered his face with his
  hands and let the letter fall.</p>

  <p>Bessas lifted it up, kissed it, and read on:</p>

  <p>"'We name the strategist Bessas as your successor in the army. We charge
  the Archon Johannes with the care of Ravenna. The administration of the taxes
  will remain&mdash;in spite of the highly unjust complaints made against him
  by the Italians&mdash;in the hands of the logician Alexandros, who is so
  zealous in our service. And as our Governor in Italy we name the
  highly-deserving Prefect of Rome, Cornelius Cethegus Cæsarius. Our nephew
  Germanus, furnished with Imperial power, is answerable for your transport to
  our fleet off Ariminum, whence Areobindos will take you to Byzantium.'"</p>

  <p>Germanus rose, and ordered all present, except Belisarius and Cethegus, to
  leave the hall.</p>

  <p>Then he descended from the throne, and went up to Belisarius, who was now
  totally unconscious of what was going on around him. He stood immovable,
  leaning his head and arm against a column, and staring at the ground.</p>

  <p>The Prince took his right hand.</p>

  <p>"It pains me, Belisarius, to be the bearer of such a message. I undertook
  it, because I thought that a friend would fulfil such an errand more gently
  than any of the enemies who were eager to do it. But I cannot deny that this
  last victory of yours cancels the fame of many former ones. Never could I
  have expected such a game of lies from the hero Belisarius! Cethegus begged
  that his report to the Emperor should be laid before you. It is full of your
  praise. Here it is. I believe it was the Empress who kindled the anger of
  Justinian against you. But you do not hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the unfortunate man. Belisarius
  shook it off.</p>

  <p>"Let me alone, boy! You bring me&mdash;you bring me the true thanks of a
  crowned head!"</p>

  <p>Germanus drew himself up with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Belisarius, you forget yourself, and who I am!"</p>

  <p>"Oh no! I am a prisoner, and you are my gaoler. I will go at once on board
  your ship&mdash;only spare me chains and fetters."</p>

  <p>It was very late before the Prefect could get away from the Prince, who
  spoke to him with the greatest frankness on state affairs and his own
  personal wishes.</p>

  <p>As soon as Cethegus was alone in his rooms, which had also been appointed
  to him in the palace, he hastened to read the letter which Lucius Licinius
  had brought from the Empress. It ran thus:</p>

  <p>"You have conquered, Cethegus. As I read your epistle I thought of old
  times, when your letters to Theodora, written in the same cipher, did not
  talk of statesmanship and warfare, but of kisses and roses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She must always remind me of that!" cried the Prefect, interrupting his
  perusal of the letter.</p>

  <p>"But even in this letter I recognise the irresistible intellect that, more
  even than your youthful beauty, conquered the women of Byzantium. And this
  time also I accede to the wishes of the old friend as I once did to those of
  the young one. Ah, how I love to think of our youth&mdash;our sweet youth! I
  fully understand that Antonina's spouse would stand far too securely for the
  future if he did not fall now. So&mdash;as you wrote me&mdash;I whispered to
  the Emperor that a subject who could play such a game with crowns and
  rebellion was too dangerous; no general ought to be exposed to such
  temptations. What he had this time feigned, he could, at another time, carry
  into earnest practice. These words weighed more heavily than all Belisarius's
  success, and my&mdash;that is, your&mdash;demands were granted. For mistrust
  is the very soul of Justinian. He trusts no one on earth,
  except&mdash;Theodora. Your messenger, Lucius, is <i>handsome</i>, but
  unamiable; he has nothing in his head but weapons and Rome. Ah, Cethegus, my
  friend, youth is now no more what it was! You have conquered,
  Cethegus&mdash;do you remember that evening when I first whispered those
  words?&mdash;but do not forget to whom you owe your victory. And mind:
  Theodora permits herself to be used as a tool only so long as she likes.
  Never forget that."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Cethegus, as he carefully destroyed the letter. "You
  are too dangerous an ally, Theodora, my little demon! I will see whether you
  cannot be replaced.&mdash;Patience! In a few weeks Mataswintha will be in
  Byzantium."</p>

  <h2><a id="b4b-25"
     name="b4b-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">The round tower, in the deepest dungeon of which Witichis
  was confined, was situated at the angle of the right wing of the palace, the
  same in which he had dwelt and ruled as King.</p>

  <p>The iron door of the tower formed the end of a long passage which led from
  a court, and which was separated from this court by a heavy iron gate.</p>

  <p>Exactly opposite this gate, on the ground-floor of the building at the
  left side of the court, was the small dwelling of Dromon, the
  <i>carcerarius</i> or gaoler of the prison.</p>

  <p>This dwelling consisted of two small chambers; the first, which was
  separated from the second by a curtain, was merely an ante-room.</p>

  <p>The inner chamber afforded an outlook across the court to the round
  tower.</p>

  <p>Both rooms were very simply furnished. A straw couch in the inner room,
  and two chairs, a table, and a row of keys upon the walls in the outer room,
  was almost all that they contained.</p>

  <p>Upon the wooden bench in the window abovementioned, sat, day and
  night&mdash;her eyes fixed upon the hole in the wall, through which alone
  light and air could penetrate to the King's prison&mdash;a silent and
  thoughtful woman.</p>

  <p>It was Rauthgundis. Her eyes never left the little chink in the wall,
  "For," she said to herself, "thither turn all my thoughts&mdash;there, where
  <i>his</i> eyes too are ever fixed."</p>

  <p>Even when she spoke to her companion, Wachis, or to the gaoler, she never
  turned her eyes away. It seemed as if she thought that her mere look could
  guard the prisoner from every danger.</p>

  <p>On the day of which we speak she had sat thus for a long time.</p>

  <p>It was evening. Dark and threatening the massive tower rose into the sky,
  casting a broad shadow over the court and the left wing of the palace.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, O Heavenly Father," murmured Rauthgundis; "even the strokes of
  fate have led to good. If, as I once intended, I had gone to my father upon
  the High Arn, I should never have heard of all the misery here. Or far too
  late. But I could not bear to forsake the last resting-place of my child near
  our home. The last, indeed, I was obliged to leave, for how could I know that
  <i>she</i>, his Queen, would not come there? I dwelt in the woods near
  Fæsulæ, and when news came of failure, and one misfortune followed another;
  when the Persians burnt our house, and I saw the flames from my hiding-place;
  it was too late to escape to my father. All the roads were blocked, and the
  Italians delivered all whom they found with yellow hair into the hands of the
  Massagetæ. No way was open but the road here&mdash;to the city where I had
  ever refused to go as <i>his</i> wife. I came like a fugitive beggar. Wachis,
  the slave, now the freedman, and Wallada, our horse, alone remained faithful
  to me. But&mdash;forced by God's hand to come, whether I would or not&mdash;I
  found that it was only that I might save <i>him</i>&mdash;deliver him from
  the shameful treachery of his wife, and out of the hands of his enemies! I
  thank Thee, O God, for this Thy mercy!"</p>

  <p>Her attention was attracted by the rattling of the iron gate opposite.</p>

  <p>A man with a light came through it across the court, and now entered the
  ante-room. It was the old gaoler.</p>

  <p>"Well? Speak! cried Rauthgundis, leaving her seat and hurrying to him.</p>

  <p>"Patience&mdash;patience! Let me first set down the lamp. There! Well, he
  has drunk and it has done him good."</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis laid her hand upon her heart.</p>

  <p>"'What is he doing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He always sits in the same position, perfectly silent. He sits on a stone
  block, his back turned to the door, his head supported on his hands. He gives
  me no answer when I speak to him. Generally he does not even move; I believe
  grief and pain have stupefied him. But to-day, when I handed him the wine in
  the wooden cup and said, 'Drink, dear sir; it comes from true friends,' he
  looked up. Ah, his look was so sorrowful, as sad as death! He drank deeply,
  and bowed his head thankfully, and gave such a sigh, that it cut me to the
  heart."</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis covered her eyes with her hand.</p>

  <p>"God knows what horrid thing that man means to do to him!" the old man
  murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>"What sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>"I say that you must eat and drink well, or else you will lose your
  strength; and you will need it before long, poor woman!"</p>

  <p>"I shall have strength enough!"</p>

  <p>"Then take at least a cup of wine."</p>

  <p>"Of this wine? No, it is all for him!"</p>

  <p>And she went back into the inner chamber, where she again took her old
  place.</p>

  <p>"The flask will last some time," old Dromon said to himself; "but we must
  save him soon, if he is to be saved at all. There comes Wachis. May he bring
  good news, else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wachis entered. Since his visit to the Queen he had exchanged his steel
  cap and mantle for clothes borrowed from Dromon.</p>

  <p>"I bring good news!" he cried, as he entered. "But where were you an hour
  ago? I knocked in vain."</p>

  <p>"We had both gone out to buy wine."</p>

  <p>"To be sure; that is the reason why the whole room smells so sweet. What
  do I see? Why, this is old and costly Falernian! How could you pay for
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Pay for it?" repeated the old man. "With the purest gold in the world! I
  told you that the Prefect had purposely let the King starve, in order to
  undermine his health. For many days I have received no rations for him.
  Against my conscience I have kept him alive by depriving the other prisoners.
  This Rauthgundis would no longer suffer. She fell into deep thought, and then
  asked me whether the rich Roman ladies still paid so dearly for the yellow
  locks of the Gothic women. Suspecting nothing, I said 'Yes.' She went away,
  and soon returned shorn of her beautiful auburn hair, but with a handful of
  gold. With this the wine was bought."</p>

  <p>Wachis went into the next room, and kissing the hand of Rauthgundis,
  exclaimed: "Good and faithful wife!"</p>

  <p>"What art thou doing, Wachis? Rise, and tell me thy news."</p>

  <p>"Yes, tell us," said Dromon, joining them. "What says my Paukis? What
  advice does he give?"</p>

  <p>"What matters his advice?" asked Rauthgundis. "I can manage alone."</p>

  <p>"We need him very much. The Prefect has formed nine cohorts, after the
  model of the Roman legionaries, of all the youth of Ravenna, and my Paulus is
  enrolled amongst them. Luckily, the Prefect has entrusted the guard of the
  city gates to these legionaries. The Byzantines are placed outside the city
  in the harbour; the Isaurians here in the palace."</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Wachis; "and these gates are carefully closed at night;
  but the breach near the Tower of Ætius is not yet repaired. Only sentinels
  are placed there to guard it."</p>

  <p>"When has my son the watch?"</p>

  <p>"In two days. He will have the third night-watch."</p>

  <p>"Thanks be to the saints! It could not have lasted much longer. I
  feared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What? Speak!" cried Rauthgundis. "I can bear to hear everything."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is well that you should know it; for you are cleverer than we
  two, and will better find out what is to be done. I fear they have something
  wicked in their heads. As long as Belisarius had the command here, it went
  well with the King. But since Belisarius has gone and the Prefect&mdash;that
  silent demon!&mdash;is master of the palace, things look dangerous. He visits
  the King every day, and speaks to him for a long time, earnestly and
  threateningly. I have often listened in the passage. But it seems to have
  little effect, for the King, I believe, never answers him; and when the
  Prefect comes out, he looks as black as thunder. For six days I have received
  no wine for the King, and only a little piece of bread; and the air down
  there is as mouldy and damp as the grave."</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," continued Dromon, "when the Prefect came up, he looked
  blacker than ever. He asked me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well? Tell me, whatever it may be!"</p>

  <p>"He asked me whether the instruments of torture were in good order!"</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis turned pale, but remained silent.</p>

  <p>"The wretch!" cried Wachis. "What did you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid; all is safe for a time. 'Clarissimus,' I said&mdash;and
  it is the pure truth&mdash;'the screws and pincers, the weights and spikes,
  and the whole delightful apparatus lie all together as safe as possible.'
  'Where?' he asked. 'In the deep sea,' I answered; 'I myself, at the order of
  King Theodoric, threw them in!' For you must know, Mistress Rauthgundis, that
  when your master was a simple Earl, he once saved me from being tortured. At
  his request, the horrible practice was fully abolished. I owe him my life and
  my sound limbs, and I would gladly risk my neck for him. And, if it cannot be
  otherwise, I will leave this city with you. But we must not delay long, for
  the Prefect has no need of my pincers and screws if he once takes it into his
  head to torture a man's marrow out of his bones. I fear him as I fear the
  devil!"</p>

  <p>"And I hate him as I hate a lie!" cried Rauthgundis sternly.</p>

  <p>"So we must be quick," Dromon went on, "before he can carry out his cruel
  intentions; for he is certainly planning something terrible against the King.
  I don't know what he can want of the poor prisoner. Now listen, and mark my
  words. The third night from now, when Paulus keeps the watch, and I take the
  King his evening drink, I will unlock his chains, throw my mantle over him,
  and lead him out of the prison and the passage into the court. Thence he will
  be able to go unnoticed to the gate of the palace, where the sentinel will
  demand the watch-word. This I shall acquaint him with. When he is once in the
  street, he must go direct to the Tower of Ætius, where Paulus will let him
  pass the breach. Outside, in the pine-grove of Diana, at a short distance
  from the gate, Wachis will wait for him with Wallada. But no one must
  accompany him; not even you, Rauthgundis. He will escape more surely
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Of what consequence am I? He shall be free; not even bound to me! Thou
  must not even name my name. I have brought him misfortune enough, I will only
  look at him once again from the window as he goes away!"</p>

  <p>The Prefect now sunned himself in the feeling of supremacy. He was
  Governor of Italy. By his order the fortifications were repaired and
  strengthened, the citizens practised in the use of arms all over the country.
  The representatives of Byzantium could no longer counterbalance him. Their
  captains had no luck; the siege of Tarvisium, as well as of Verona and
  Ticinum, made no progress. And Cethegus heard with pleasure that Hildebad,
  whose troops had been augmented by deserters to the number of about six
  hundred, had badly beaten Acacius, who had overtaken and attacked him with a
  thousand Persian horsemen. But Hildebad's road was still blocked by a strong
  battalion of Byzantines, who marched against him from Mantua&mdash;he had
  intended to join Totila at Tarvisium&mdash;and he was obliged to throw
  himself into the Castle of Castra Nova, which was still occupied by the Goths
  under Thorismuth.</p>

  <p>Here the Byzantines kept him shut up. They could not, however, take the
  strong fortress, and the Prefect already foresaw that Acacius would soon call
  upon him to help to destroy the Goths, who could then no longer escape him.
  It rejoiced him that, since the departure of Belisarius, the forces of
  Byzantium were proved, in the face of all Italy, to be incapable of putting
  an end to the resistance of the Goths. And the harshness of the Byzantine
  financial administration, which had accompanied Belisarius wherever he
  went&mdash;for he could not prevent the practice of draining the resources of
  the country, which was carried on at the Emperor's command&mdash;awakened or
  heightened the dislike of both town and country to the East Roman rule.</p>

  <p>Cethegus took good care not&mdash;as Belisarius had often done&mdash;to
  oppose the worst acts of Justinian's officials. It gave him great pleasure
  when the populations of Neapolis and Rome repeatedly broke out into open
  rebellion against their oppressors.</p>

  <p>When the Goths were completely annihilated, the power of the Byzantines
  become contemptible, and their tyranny sufficiently hated, Italy might be
  called upon to assert her independence, and her saviour, her ruler, would be
  Cethegus.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding, he was troubled by one circumstance&mdash;for he was far
  from undervaluing his enemies. The Gothic war, the last sparks of which were
  not yet trampled out, might at any time flame up anew, fanned by the national
  indignation aroused by the treachery which had been practised. It had great
  weight with the Prefect that the most hated leaders of the Goths, Totila and
  Teja, had not been taken in the trap laid at Ravenna.</p>

  <p>For the purpose, therefore, of preventing such a national uprising as he
  feared, he attempted to drag from the Gothic King a declaration, that he had
  surrendered himself and the city without hope and without condition, and that
  he called upon his people to abstain from fruitless resistance. He also
  wished his prisoner to tell him in what castle the war-treasure of Theodoric
  was concealed.</p>

  <p>Even in those days such a treasure, as a means of gaining foreign princes
  and mercenaries, was of the highest importance. If the Goths lost it, they
  would lose their best chance of strengthening their exhausted forces by the
  aid of foreign weapons.</p>

  <p>And it was the Prefect's greatest wish not to let this
  treasure&mdash;which legend spoke of as immense&mdash;fall into the hands of
  the Byzantines&mdash;whose need of money, and the tyranny caused by this
  need, were such active allies in his plans&mdash;but to secure it for
  himself. His means were also not inexhaustible. But opposed to the calm
  steadfastness of his prisoner, the Prefect's efforts to extort the secret
  were vain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b4b-26"
     name="b4b-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">All necessary measures had been taken for the escape of the
  King.</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis and Wachis had made themselves thoroughly acquainted with the
  pine-grove where the faithful freedman was to wait with the charger of
  Dietrich of Bern.</p>

  <p>And it was with the confidence which completed preparations always lend to
  a stout heart, that Rauthgundis returned to the dwelling of the gaoler.</p>

  <p>But she turned pale when the latter rushed to meet her with an air of
  desperation, and dragged her across the threshold.</p>

  <p>Once in the room, he threw himself on his knees before her, beating his
  breast with his fists and tearing his grey hair.</p>

  <p>For some time he could find no words.</p>

  <p>"Speak," cried Rauthgundis, pressing her hand to her wildly-beating heart.
  "Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"No; but flight is impossible! all is lost! all is lost! An hour ago the
  Prefect came, and went down to the King. As usual, I opened both doors for
  him, the passage and the prison door, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Then he took both keys from me, saying he would keep them in future
  himself."</p>

  <p>"And thou gavest them up!" said Rauthgundis, grinding her teeth.</p>

  <p>"How could I refuse? I did all I could. I kept them back and asked:
  'Master, do you no longer trust me?' He looked at me with a look that seemed
  to pierce soul and body. 'From this moment,' he said, 'no longer,' and
  snatched the keys from my hand."</p>

  <p>"And thou didst not prevent him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, mistress, you are unjust! What could you have done in my place?
  Nothing!"</p>

  <p>"I should have strangled him. And now? What shall we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Do? Nothing! Nothing can be done!"</p>

  <p>"He <i>must</i> be liberated. Dost thou hear? he <i>must</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But, mistress, I know not how."</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis caught up an axe which lay near the hearth.</p>

  <p>"We will open the doors by force."</p>

  <p>Dromon tried to take the axe from her hand.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible! They are thickly plated with iron."</p>

  <p>"Then send for the monster! Tell him that Witichis desires to speak with
  him, and I will strike him down at the passage door."</p>

  <p>"And then? You rave! Let me go out. I will call Wachis away from his
  useless watch."</p>

  <p>"No! I cannot think that we shall not succeed. Perhaps that devil will
  return of his own accord. Perhaps&mdash;" she continued
  reflectively&mdash;"Ha!" she cried suddenly, "it must be so. He wants to
  murder him! He intends to steal alone to the defenceless prisoner. But woe to
  him if he come! I will guard the threshold of that door as if it were a
  sanctuary, and woe to him if he cross it!"</p>

  <p>She leaned heavily against the half-door of the room, and swung the
  ponderous axe.</p>

  <p>But Rauthgundis was wrong.</p>

  <p>Not to kill his prisoner had the Prefect taken the keys into his own
  keeping.</p>

  <p>He had gone with them in his hand to the south side of the palace, where
  he gained admittance to Mataswintha's room.</p>

  <p>The stillness of death and the excitement of fever alternated so rapidly
  in Mataswintha, that Aspa could never look at her mistress without the tears
  rushing to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Most beautiful daughter of the Germans," began the Prefect, "dissipate
  the cloud which rests upon your white brow, and listen to me calmly."</p>

  <p>"How is the King? You leave me without news. You promised to let him go
  free when all was decided. You promised that he should be taken over the
  Alps. You have not kept your word."</p>

  <p>"I promised it on two conditions. You know them well, and you have not yet
  done your part. Tomorrow the nephew of the Emperor will return from Ariminum,
  ready to take you to Byzantium, and I desire you to give him hopes that you
  will become his bride. Your marriage with Witichis was forced and null."</p>

  <p>"No, never! I have told you so before."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it, for the sake of my prisoner, for he will not see the
  light of day again until you are on the way to Byzantium with Germanus."</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>"Do not irritate me, Mataswintha. The folly of the girl who bought the
  Ares' head at such a high price, is, I think, outgrown. For that once
  enamoured being has since sacrificed the Ares of the Goths to his enemies.
  But if you still honour that dream of girlhood, then save the man you once
  loved."</p>

  <p>Mataswintha shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Until now I have treated you as a free agent, as a Queen. Do not remind
  me that you, as well as he, are in my power. You will become the
  wife&mdash;soon the widow&mdash;of this noble Prince&mdash;and
  Justinian&mdash;Byzantium&mdash;the whole world, will lie at your feet.
  Daughter of the Amelungs, is it possible that you do not love power?"</p>

  <p>"I only love&mdash;&mdash; Never!"</p>

  <p>"Then I must force you."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"<i>You?</i> Force <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I force you! (She still loves the man she has ruined!) The second
  condition is this: that the prisoner fill up this empty space with a
  name&mdash;the name of the castle in which the treasure of the Goths is
  concealed&mdash;and sign the declaration. He refuses to do this with a
  stubbornness which begins to anger me. Seven times I, the conqueror, have
  been to him. He would never yet speak to me. And the first time I went I
  received a look for which alone he deserves to lose his haughty head."</p>

  <p>"He will never consent!"</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen. The continual dropping of water wears away a
  stone at last. But I can wait no longer. Early to-day I received word that
  that mad Hildebad, in a furious sally, has beaten Bessas so thoroughly, that
  the latter can scarcely continue the siege. Everywhere the Goths rebel. I
  must go and make an end of it, and extinguish these last sparks with the
  water of deception, which is better than blood. To this end I must have the
  King's declaration, and the secret of the castle. Therefore I tell you that
  if, before to-morrow, you do not consent to accompany the Prince to
  Byzantium, and have not procured for me the signature of the prisoner,
  witnessed as such by yourself, I will&mdash;I swear by the
  Styx&mdash;kill&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Horrified at the awful expression of Cethegus's face, Mataswintha started
  from her seat and grasped his arm.</p>

  <p>"You will not kill <i>him</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; or rather, I will first torture him, then blind him, and afterwards
  kill him!"</p>

  <p>"No! no!" screamed Mataswintha.</p>

  <p>"I am resolved. The executioners are ready. And you, you shall tell him
  this. He will believe that I am in earnest when he sees your despair. You
  will perhaps be able to soften him; the sight of me only hardens him. Perhaps
  he thinks that he is still in the hands of Belisarius, that tender-hearted
  hero. You will tell him in whose power he really is. Here are the
  documents&mdash;here the keys which open his prison. You shall choose the
  hour yourself."</p>

  <p>A ray of joyful hope shone from Mataswintha'a eyes. Cethegus failed not to
  remark it, but, smiling calmly, he left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b4b-27"
     name="b4b-27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after the Prefect had left the Queen it became quite
  dark.</p>

  <p>The sky was thickly covered with ragged clouds, which were driven across
  the moon by the fierce wind, so that brief and uncertain light alternated
  with a gloom rendered greater by contrast.</p>

  <p>Dromon had completed his evening round of the cells, and returned to his
  dwelling tired and sad.</p>

  <p>He found no light within. He could scarcely make out that Rauthgundis was
  still leaning against the half«door, the axe in her hand, her eyes fixed upon
  the door of the passage.</p>

  <p>"Let me strike a light, mistress, and kindle the chips upon the hearth.
  Share the evening meal with me. Come, you wait here in vain."</p>

  <p>"No, no light, no fire! I can see better what happens in the court
  without, for it is moonlight."</p>

  <p>"Well, at least come in here and rest yourself. Here is bread and
  meat."</p>

  <p>"Shall I eat while he hungers?"</p>

  <p>"You will be exhausted! Of what are you thinking the whole evening?"</p>

  <p>"Of what am I thinking?" repeated Rauthgundis, still looking out. "I am
  thinking how often we have sat in the colonnade before our beautiful house,
  when the fountain splashed in the garden and the cicalas chirped in the
  trees. The cool night-breeze fanned his beloved face, and I nestled against
  his shoulder, and we did not speak one word, and above us was the silent
  march of the stars. And we listened to the deep and peaceful breathing of our
  child, who had fallen asleep upon my lap, his little hands, like soft white
  fetters, clasping the arm of his father. Alas! his arm now wears other
  fetters! Iron fetters&mdash;that pain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And she pressed her forehead against the iron grating, until she, too,
  felt pain.</p>

  <p>"Mistress, why do you torment yourself thus? We cannot help it!"</p>

  <p>"'But we will help it! I must save him and&mdash;&mdash;Dromon! look
  there! What is that?" she whispered, and pointed at something in the
  court.</p>

  <p>The old man hastened noiselessly to her side.</p>

  <p>In the court was a tall white figure, which seemed to glide stealthily
  along the wall.</p>

  <p>At brief intervals, but sharp and clear, the moonlight fell upon it.</p>

  <p>"It is a Lemure! The ghost of some one who has been murdered here!" said
  the old man, trembling. "God and all the saints protect us!"</p>

  <p>He crossed himself and covered his head with his mantle.</p>

  <p>"No," said Rauthgundis, "the dead do not return from the other world! Now
  it has disappeared&mdash;all is dark. Ha! the moon breaks through
  once&mdash;more there it is again! It moves towards the passage-door. What is
  that shining red in the white light? Ha! it is the Queen&mdash;that is her
  red hair? She stops at the door! She opens it! She is going to murder him in
  his sleep!"</p>

  <p>"God knows, it is the Queen! But <i>she</i> murder him! How could
  she?"</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> could! But, as I live, she shall not! Follow her! A miracle
  opens the door to us. But softly, softly!"</p>

  <p>And she went out on tiptoe into the court, the axe still in her hand,
  slowly and stealthily, seeking the shadow. Dromon followed her closely.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mataswintha, for she it was, had opened the door and gone
  forward, down many steps and then through a small passage, feeling the way
  with her hands.</p>

  <p>She now reached the door of the prison. She opened it very softly.</p>

  <p>Through an aperture high up on the wall, where a stone had been taken out,
  a slanting strip of moonlight fell into the square and narrow dungeon.</p>

  <p>The light revealed the prisoner. He sat motionless upon a block of stone,
  his back turned to the door, his head supported on his hands.</p>

  <p>Mataswintha trembled and leaned against the doorpost. The air felt damp
  and icy-cold. She shivered. She could not say a word for very horror.</p>

  <p>Witichis remarked the draught of air from the open door. He lifted his
  head, but did not look round.</p>

  <p>"Witichis&mdash;King Witichis&mdash;" at last stammered Mataswintha; "it
  is I! Dost thou hear me?"</p>

  <p>But the prisoner did not move.</p>

  <p>"I come to save thee&mdash;fly! Thou art free!"</p>

  <p>But the prisoner dropped his head again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, speak!&mdash;oh, only look at me!"</p>

  <p>She now went quite into the dungeon. Gladly would she have touched his
  arm, and taken his hand, but she did not yet dare.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus will kill thee!" she said; "torture thee. He surely will if thou
  dost not fly!"</p>

  <p>And now her desperation gave her courage. She drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"But thou wilt fly! Thou shalt not die! I must save thee! I beseech thee,
  fly, fly! Oh, thou dost not hear me, and time presses! Sometime thou shalt
  know everything! but now fly&mdash;to life and liberty! I have the keys of
  the doors! fly, fly!" And now she grasped his arm and tried to drag him from
  his seat.</p>

  <p>But she heard the rattling of chains&mdash;on his arms on his feet. He was
  chained to the block of stone.</p>

  <p>"Oh! what is this?" she cried, and fell upon her knees.</p>

  <p>"Stone and iron," he said, in a toneless voice. "Leave me, I am doomed.
  And even if these bonds did not hold me&mdash;I would not follow thee. Back
  to the world? The world is one great lie. Everything is a lie."</p>

  <p>"Thou art right. It is better to die. Let me die with thee, but forgive
  me! For I, too, have lied to thee."</p>

  <p>"It is very possible. It does not surprise me."</p>

  <p>"But thou wilt forgive me before we die? I have hated thee&mdash;I have
  rejoiced in thy ruin&mdash;I have&mdash;oh, it is so hard to tell! I have not
  the strength to confess it! And yet I must have thy forgiveness. Oh, forgive
  me!&mdash;give me thy hand as a sign of thy pardon."</p>

  <p>But Witichis had sunk back into his former stupor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beseech thee&mdash;forgive me, whatever I may have done!"</p>

  <p>"Go&mdash;why should I not forgive thee? thou art like the rest&mdash;not
  better and not worse."</p>

  <p>"No, I am more wicked than all&mdash;and yet better. At least more
  miserable. It is true that I hated thee, but only because thou hast ever
  thrust me from thee. Thou wouldst not permit me to share thy life. Forgive
  me!&mdash;O God! I only wish to die with thee!&mdash;give me thy hand as a
  sign of pardon!"</p>

  <p>Kneeling and beseeching, she stretched out both her hands.</p>

  <p>The King again lifted his head. The kindness of his nature awoke within
  him, and overpowered his own dull pain.</p>

  <p>"Mataswintha," he said, lifting his chained hand, "go. I am sorry for
  thee. Let me die alone. Whatever thou mayst have done&mdash;go&mdash;I
  forgive thee."</p>

  <p>"O Witichis!" breathed Mataswintha, and would have clasped his hand, but
  she felt herself suddenly and violently dragged away.</p>

  <p>"Incendiary! never shall he forgive thee! Come, Witichis!&mdash;<i>my</i>
  Witichis!&mdash;follow me; thou art free!"</p>

  <p>The King sprang up, roused to life by this voice.</p>

  <p>"Rauthgundis! My wife! Thou hast never lied! Thou art true! at last I have
  thee again!"</p>

  <p>And, with a gasp of joy, he stretched out his arms. His wife flew to his
  bosom, and tear's of delight rushed from their eyes.</p>

  <p>But Mataswintha, who had risen, tottered to the wall. She slowly stroked
  her loose red hair out of her eyes and looked at the pair, who were
  illuminated by the bright moonlight from the chink in the wall.</p>

  <p>"How he loves her! Yes, he will follow <i>her</i>! But he shall not! He
  shall remain and die with me!"</p>

  <p>"Delay no longer!" said the voice of Dromon at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come, come quickly, my life!" cried Rauthgundis.</p>

  <p>She drew a little key from her bosom and felt at the chains, seeking the
  small opening of the lock.</p>

  <p>"What? Shall I really breathe once more the air of freedom?" asked the
  prisoner, half sinking back into his stupor.</p>

  <p>"Yes; the free and open air!" cried Rauthgundis, and threw the loosened
  chains to the ground. "Here, Witichis, here is a weapon! an axe! Take
  it!"</p>

  <p>Eagerly the Goth took the axe and weighed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ha! how the weapon strengthens my arm and soul!"</p>

  <p>"I knew it, my brave Witichis," said Rauthgundis, kneeling down and
  unlocking the chain which bound his left foot to the block of stone. "Now
  step out, for thou art free!"</p>

  <p>Witichis, raising the axe in his right hand, made a step toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"And <i>she</i> is permitted to loose his chains!" whispered
  Mataswintha.</p>

  <p>"Yes, free!" cried Witichis, drawing a deep breath. "Come, Rauthgundis,
  let us go!"</p>

  <p>"He goes with <i>her</i>!" screamed Mataswintha, and cast herself before
  the pair. "Witichis&mdash;farewell&mdash;but tell me once more&mdash;that
  thou hast forgiven me!"</p>

  <p>"Forgiven thee!" cried Rauthgundis. "Never&mdash;never! She has destroyed
  our kingdom&mdash;she has betrayed thee! It was no lightning&mdash;it was her
  hand which kindled the granaries!"</p>

  <p>"Ha&mdash;then be thou accursed!" cried Witichis. "Away, away from this
  serpent!" and, thrusting Mataswintha violently away, he crossed the
  threshold, followed by Rauthgundis.</p>

  <p>"Witichis," screamed Mataswintha, dragging herself
  up&mdash;"stay&mdash;stay! Hear one word&mdash;Witichis!"</p>

  <p>"Be silent," said Dromon, grasping her arm. "You will alarm the
  guard!"</p>

  <p>But Mataswintha, now no more mistress of herself, ran up the steps into
  the passage. "Stay, Witichis&mdash;stay!" she screamed. "Thou canst not leave
  me thus!" and fell fainting to the earth.</p>

  <p>Dromon hurried past her, and followed the fugitives.</p>

  <p>But the shrill cries of Mataswintha had already reached the ear of one who
  ever slept lightly. Cethegus, his sword in his hand, and only half dressed,
  came out of his chamber into the gallery which looked over the square court
  of the palace.</p>

  <p>"Guards!" he cried. "To arms!"</p>

  <p>The soldiers were already astir.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had Witichis, Rauthgundis, and Dromon left the passage and safely
  reached the dwelling of the latter, when six Isaurian mercenaries rushed
  noisily into the passage.</p>

  <p>Quick as thought Rauthgundis ran out of the house to the heavy iron door,
  shut it, turned the key, and took it out.</p>

  <p>"Now they can do no harm," she whispered.</p>

  <p>The husband and wife presently hastened from Dromon's house to the great
  gate which led from the court into the street. The single sentinel who had
  remained behind stopped them and demanded the watchword. "Rome," he cried,
  "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Revenge!" cried Witichis, and struck him down with the axe.</p>

  <p>The sentinel screamed and fell, hurling his spear at the fugitives. It
  pierced the last of the three&mdash;Dromon.</p>

  <p>As Witichis and Rauthgundis rushed down the marble stairs of the palace
  into the street, they heard the imprisoned soldiers thundering at the strong
  iron door, and a loud voice calling: "Syphax, my horse!" Then they
  disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the courtyard was bright with the lights of many
  torches, and several horsemen galloped off to the different gates of the
  city.</p>

  <p>"Six thousand solidi to whoever takes him alive; three thousand if he be
  brought in dead!" cried Cethegus, swinging himself into the saddle. "Up, Sons
  of the Wind, Ellak and Mondzach, Huns and Massagetæ! Ride as you have never
  ridden before!"</p>

  <p>"But whither?" asked Syphax, as he galloped out of the gate at his
  master's aide.</p>

  <p>"That is difficult to say. But all the gates are closed and guarded. They
  can only escape by a breach."</p>

  <p>"There are two large breaches."</p>

  <p>"Look at Jupiter, which is just rising from behind the clouds in the east.
  It seems to sign to me. In that direction&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lies the breach near the Tower of Ætius."</p>

  <p>"Good! Then thither&mdash;I follow my star!"</p>

  <p>Meantime the fugitives had happily reached the breach, where Paulus, the
  son of Dromon, let them pass. In the pine-grove of Diana they found their
  faithful Wachis and two horses.</p>

  <p>The husband and wife mounted Wallada. The freedman took the other horse
  and rode off at a gallop towards the river, which at this point was very
  broad.</p>

  <p>Witichis held Rauthgundis before him.</p>

  <p>"My wife&mdash;losing thee I had lost all: life and courage. But now I
  will once more try for the kingdom. Oh, how could I ever let thee go, thou
  soul of my soul!"</p>

  <p>"Thine arm is wounded with the chaffing of the chain. Lay it across my
  neck, my Witichis."</p>

  <p>"Forward, Wallada&mdash;quick! It is for life or death!"</p>

  <p>They now issued from the grove into the open country. They reached the
  shore of the river.</p>

  <p>Wachis was trying to urge his rearing steed into the dark flood. The
  animal shyed and resisted.</p>

  <p>The freedman sprang off.</p>

  <p>"It is very deep, very rapid," he said. "For three days the river has been
  unusually full. The ford is useless. The horses will have to swim, and the
  current will drag us far to the left. There are rocks in the stream, and the
  moonlight is so inconstant and deceptive."</p>

  <p>He looked doubtfully and searchingly up and down the river.</p>

  <p>"Hark! what was that?" asked Rauthgundis. "It was not the wind in the
  trees."</p>

  <p>"It is horses!" cried Witichis. "They approach rapidly. I hear the clatter
  of arms. There&mdash;torches! Now into the river for life or death&mdash;but
  softly!"</p>

  <p>He urged his horse into the water.</p>

  <p>"There is no footing. The horses must swim. Hold fast by the mane,
  Rauthgundis. Forward, Wallada!"</p>

  <p>Snorting and trembling, the noble animal looked at the black water. His
  mane was blown wildly about his head&mdash;he held his fore-feet stretched
  out, his haunches drawn in.</p>

  <p>"Forward, Wallada!" said Witichis, and called softly into the faithful
  animal's ear, "Theodoric!"</p>

  <p>At this the charger sprang willingly into the water.</p>

  <p>The pursuing horsemen had already galloped out of the wood, Cethegus
  foremost; at his side rode Syphax with a torch.</p>

  <p>"Here the track disappears in the sand, master."</p>

  <p>"They are in the river. Forward, Huns!"</p>

  <p>But the horsemen drew rein and stood stock-still.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ellak, why do you linger? At once into the flood!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, we cannot. Before we ride into running water at night-time, we must
  ask forgiveness of Phug, the water-spirit. We must first pray to him."</p>

  <p>"Pray when you are across as long as you like; but now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Just then a strong gust of wind blew from the river and extinguished all
  the torches.</p>

  <p>The river rushed and roared.</p>

  <p>"You see, sir, that Phug is angry."</p>

  <p>"Be silent. Did you see nothing? There to the left."</p>

  <p>The moon just then glanced between the driving clouds. It shone upon the
  light-coloured garments of Rauthgundis. She had lost her brown mantle.</p>

  <p>"Aim quickly; there!"</p>

  <p>"We cannot; we must first finish our worship!"</p>

  <p>The clouds passed across the moon, and it was again quite dark.</p>

  <p>With a curse, Cethegus snatched bow and quiver from the shoulder of the
  chief of the Huns.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" cried Wachis in a low voice, when he had almost reached the
  opposite shore; "come quickly, before the moon issues from that narrow strip
  of cloud!"</p>

  <p>"Halt, Wallada!" cried Witichis, as he dismounted in order to lighten the
  burden, and held fast by the horse's mane. "Here is a rock. Take care,
  Rauthgundis."</p>

  <p>Horse, man, and woman were checked for a moment while balancing upon the
  top of the rock, past which the water rushed and gurgled in a deep whirl.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the moon shone out clear and bright. It illuminated the surface
  of the stream and the group on the rock.</p>

  <p>"It is they!" cried Cethegus, who held his bow and arrow ready.</p>

  <p>He took a rapid aim, and pulled the string.</p>

  <p>Whistling, the long black-feathered arrow flew from the string.</p>

  <p>"Rauthgundis!" cried Witichis in terror; for his wife started convulsively
  and sank forward upon the horse's neck. But she did not utter a groan.
  "Rauthgundis, thou art hit?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so. Leave me here and save thyself."</p>

  <p>"Never! Let me support thee."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, sir, stoop! dive! They take aim again!"</p>

  <p>The Huns had finished praying. They rode a short way into the water,
  fixing their arrows and taking aim.</p>

  <p>"Leave me, Witichis. Fly! I will die here."</p>

  <p>"No; I will never leave thee again!"</p>

  <p>He lifted her out of the saddle, and tried to hide her on the rock. The
  group stood in the full light of the moon.</p>

  <p>"Yield, Witichis!" cried Cethegus, spurring his horse up to its haunches
  in the water.</p>

  <p>"A curse upon thee, thou traitor!" was the reply of Witichis.</p>

  <p>Twelve arrows whizzed at once. The charger of Theodoric leaped wildly
  forward, and sank for ever into the flood.</p>

  <p>But Witichis also was mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>"With thee!" sighed Rauthgundis. She held him closely with both arms.</p>

  <p>"With thee!"</p>

  <p>And, locked in a fast embrace, husband and wife sank into the river.</p>

  <p>In bitter grief, Wachis, on the farther shore, called their names. In
  vain. Three times he called, and then galloped away into the night.</p>

  <p>"Get the bodies out," ordered Cethegus grimly, turning his horse to the
  bank.</p>

  <p>And the Huns rode and swam to the rock, and sought for the bodies. But
  they sought in vain.</p>

  <p>The rapid current had carried man and wife, united now for ever, into the
  free and open sea.</p>

  <p>The same day Prince Germanus had returned from Ariminum to the harbour of
  Ravenna, ready to take Mataswintha to Byzantium.</p>

  <p>The latter was only roused from the faint into which she had fallen when
  left by Witichis and Rauthgundis, by the noise of the hammers with which the
  work-people broke open the passage to liberate the soldiers.</p>

  <p>The Princess was found crouching upon the steps of the prison. She was
  carried up to her chamber in a high fever. She lay for hours upon her purple
  cushions without moving or speaking, her eyes fixed in a wild stare.</p>

  <p>Towards noon Cethegus asked for admission.</p>

  <p>His look was dark and threatening; his expression cold as ice.</p>

  <p>He went up to Mataswintha's couch.</p>

  <p>"He is dead!" she quietly said.</p>

  <p>"He would not have it otherwise. He&mdash;and you. It is useless to
  reproach you. But you see what ensues when you oppose me. The report of his
  death will inevitably rouse the barbarians to new fury. You have created a
  difficult task for me; for you only are the cause of his flight and death.
  The least that you can do to atone for this is to fulfil my second wish.
  Prince Germanus has landed. He comes to fetch you. You will follow him."</p>

  <p>"Where is the corpse?"</p>

  <p>"It has not been found. The current has carried it away; his body
  and&mdash;the woman's."</p>

  <p>Mataswintha's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Even in death! She died with him?"</p>

  <p>"Think no more of the dead. In two hours I will return with the Prince.
  Will you then be prepared to welcome him?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well. We will be punctual."</p>

  <p>"I also. Aspa, call all my slaves; they shall adorn me richly to meet this
  Prince. Diadem, purple, and silk."</p>

  <p>"She has lost her senses," Cethegus said to himself as he left the room.
  "But women are tough; she will recover them. These women can live, even when
  their hearts are broken."</p>

  <p>He went to console the impatient Prince.</p>

  <p>Before the expiration of the time appointed, a slave came to invite the
  two men to come to the Queen.</p>

  <p>Germanus crossed the threshold of her room with a rapid step. But he stood
  still astonished. He had never seen the Gothic Princess looking so lovely, so
  queenly.</p>

  <p>She had placed a high golden diadem upon her shining hair, which fell over
  her shoulders in two thick tresses. Her under-dress of heavy white silk,
  embroidered with golden flowers, was only visible below the knee, for the
  upper part of her body was covered by the royal purple. Her face was white
  and cold as marble: her eyes blazed with a strange and supernatural
  light.</p>

  <p>"Prince Germanus," she said, as he entered, "you once spoke to me of love;
  but do you know of what you spoke? To love is to die."</p>

  <p>Germanus looked inquiringly at the Prefect, who now came forward.</p>

  <p>He was about to speak, but Mataswintha, in a clear loud voice,
  recommenced:</p>

  <p>"Prince Germanus, you are famed as the most highly-cultivated man of a
  learned court, where it is a favourite pastime to practise the solving of
  finely-pointed riddles. I also will put to you a riddle; see to it that you
  solve it. Let the clever Prefect, who so well understands human nature, help
  you. What is this?&mdash;A wife, and yet a maid; a widow, and yet no wife?
  You cannot guess? You are right; death alone resolves all riddles!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden movement, she cast off her purple robe.</p>

  <p>There was a flash of steel! She had stabbed herself to the heart.</p>

  <p>With a shriek, Germanus and Aspa (who had stood behind) sprang
  forward.</p>

  <p>Cethegus silently caught the falling figure.</p>

  <p>She died as soon as he drew the sword from her breast. He knew the sword.
  He himself had sent it to her.</p>

  <p>It was the sword of King Witichis.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="b5a-1"
     name="b5a-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days after the death of Mataswintha and the departure
  of Prince Germanus, who was deeply shocked by the sad event, a message came
  from Castra Nova, which rendered necessary the march of Byzantine troops from
  Ravenna.</p>

  <p>Hildebad had been informed, by fugitive Goths, who had made their way in
  disguise through the lines of the besiegers, of the treacherous imprisonment
  of the King.</p>

  <p>On hearing the news, he sent word to Cethegus and Belisarius, through some
  prisoners whom he released, that he challenged them, either together or
  singly, to mortal combat, "if they had a drop of courage in their veins, or a
  trace of honour in their souls."</p>

  <p>"He thinks that Belisarius is still in the country, and does not seem to
  fear him greatly," said Bessas.</p>

  <p>"This might be a means," said Cethegus cunningly, of ruining the turbulent
  fellow. "But, certainly, it needs great courage&mdash;such courage as
  Belisarius possesses."</p>

  <p>"You know that I do not yield to him a jot in that," answered Bessas.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Cethegus. "Then follow me to my house. I will show you how to
  destroy this giant. You shall succeed where Belisarius failed." But he said
  to himself, "Bessas is indeed a tolerably bad commander; but Demetrius is
  still worse, and therefore easier to lead. And I owe Bessas a grudge for that
  affair of the Tiburtinian Gate at Rome."</p>

  <p>The Prefect had not without reason feared that the almost extinguished
  resistance of the Goths would be renewed on hearing of the treason practised
  on their King.</p>

  <p>No exact report had yet reached old Hildebrand at Verona, Totila at
  Tarvisium, or Teja at Ticinum.</p>

  <p>They had only heard that Ravenna had fallen, and that the King was
  imprisoned.</p>

  <p>Vague rumours of treachery accompanied this report, and the friends of the
  King, in their pain and anger, were persuaded that the fall of the strong
  fortress and of the brave King had not been effected by honest means.</p>

  <p>Instead of discouraging them, this misfortune only increased the strength
  of their resistance.</p>

  <p>They weakened their besiegers by repeated and successful sallies.</p>

  <p>And the enemy felt almost constrained to raise the siege, for already
  signs of an important change of circumstance crowded upon them from all
  sides.</p>

  <p>This change was, in fact, a rapidly progressing reversion of feeling in
  the Italian population, at least of the middle classes: the merchants and
  artisans of the towns; the peasants and farmers of the country.</p>

  <p>The Italians had everywhere greeted the Byzantines as liberators.</p>

  <p>But after a short period their exultation died away.</p>

  <p>Whole troops of officials followed Belisarius from Byzantium, sent by
  Justinian to reap without delay the fruits of the war, and to fill the
  ever-empty treasury of the East with the riches of Italy.</p>

  <p>In the midst of all the suffering caused by the war, these zealous
  officials began their work.</p>

  <p>As soon as Belisarius had occupied a town, his treasurer summoned all free
  citizens to the Curia or to the Forum; ordered them to divide themselves into
  six classes according to their wealth, and then called upon each class to
  value the property of the class above it.</p>

  <p>According to this valuation, the imperial officials then laid the highest
  possible tax upon each class.</p>

  <p>And, as these officials were almost necessitated, because of the retention
  and curtailment of their never punctually paid salaries, to think of filling
  their own pockets as well as the Emperor's treasury, the oppression they put
  in practice became intolerable.</p>

  <p>They were not content with the high rates which the Emperor required to be
  paid in advance for three years; the special tax laid upon every liberated
  town of Italy as a "gratitude tax"&mdash;besides the large contributions and
  requisitions which Belisarius and his generals were obliged to demand for the
  use of the army&mdash;for neither gold nor provisions came from
  Byzantium&mdash;but every official sought to extort special payments, by
  special means, out of the richer citizens.</p>

  <p>They everywhere ordered a revision of the tax-lists, discovered arrears
  owing since the times of the Gothic Kings, even from the days of Odoacer, and
  left the citizens the option of paying immense sums for indemnity or of
  carrying on a ruinous lawsuit with Justinian's fiscus, who scarcely ever lost
  one.</p>

  <p>But if the tax-lists were incomplete or destroyed&mdash;which happened
  often enough in those times of war&mdash;the accountants arbitrarily
  reconstructed them.</p>

  <p>In short, all the arts of finance which had ruined the provinces of the
  Eastern Empire were practised in Italy, after the landing of Belisarius, as
  far as imperial arms could reach.</p>

  <p>Without consideration for the misery of war-time, the tax executors
  unyoked the oxen of the peasant from the plough, took his tools from the
  workshop of the artisan, and his wares from the house of the merchant.</p>

  <p>In many towns the people rebelled against their oppressors and drove them
  away; but they only returned in larger numbers with severer measures.</p>

  <p>The Mauretanian horsemen of Justinian, with African bloodhounds, hunted
  the desperate peasants from their hiding-places in the woods, whither they
  had fled to escape the tax-gatherer. And Cethegus, who alone was in a
  position to check such deeds, looked on with calculating coolness.</p>

  <p>He desired that, before the end of the war, all Italy should have become
  acquainted with the tyranny of Byzantium, for then it would be a lighter task
  for him to persuade the people to rise and, when they had got rid of the
  Goths, to throw off the burden of the Byzantines. He listened to the
  complaints of the deputations from various towns, who appealed to him for
  assistance, with a shrug and the laconic answer:</p>

  <p>"That is only Byzantine government&mdash;you must get used to it."</p>

  <p>"No," had answered the deputation from Rome, "one does not get accustomed
  to what is unbearable. The Emperor may live to see that of which he has never
  even dreamed!"</p>

  <p>To Cethegus this could only mean the independence of Italy; he knew of
  nothing else.</p>

  <p>But he was mistaken.</p>

  <p>Although he thought meanly enough of his countrymen and the times in which
  he lived, he yet believed that he could elevate them by example.</p>

  <p>But the thought so natural to his spirit; as necessary to him as the air
  he breathed&mdash;the freedom and independence of Italy&mdash;was far too
  grand for the comprehension of that generation.</p>

  <p>They could only vacillate between two masters.</p>

  <p>And when the yoke of Byzantium proved unbearable they began to recall to
  their memory the milder rule of the Goths; a possibility which had never
  entered the Prefect's head.</p>

  <p>And yet such was the case.</p>

  <p>Before Tarvisium, Ticinum, and Verona, there now happened on a small
  scale, that which was preparing on a large one in such cities as Neapolis and
  Rome. The Italian country-people revolted against the Byzantine officials and
  soldiers, and the inhabitants of the above-named three cities supported the
  Goths in every possible manner.</p>

  <p>So, when Totila, backed by the armed peasants of the plains, had destroyed
  a great part of their works, the besiegers of Tarvisium were obliged to cease
  their attacks, and limit themselves to the defence of their camp, thus
  enabling Totila to draw supplies and soldiers from the neighbouring
  country.</p>

  <p>With a more cheerful spirit than usual he one evening made his round of
  the walls of Tarvisium.</p>

  <p>Rosy clouds floated across the sky, and the sun, as it sank behind the
  Venetian hills, gilded all the plain before him.</p>

  <p>With emotion he watched the peasants from the neighbourhood streaming
  through the open gates of the city, bringing bread, meat, and wine to his
  half-starved Goths; who, on their part, hurried out into the open country,
  and Germans and Italians, embracing, celebrated the victory which they had
  together gained over their hated enemies.</p>

  <p>"Is it then impossible," said Totila to himself, "to preserve and
  propagate this amity through the whole country? Is it a necessity that these
  two nations should be eternally divided? How their friendship embellishes
  each! Have we not also failed, in that we ever treated the Italians as the
  vanquished? We meet them with suspicion, instead of with generous confidence.
  We demand their obedience, and neglect to win their affection. And it would
  have been well worth the winning! Had it been won&mdash;never would Byzantium
  have gained a footing here! The release from my vow&mdash;Valeria&mdash;would
  not have been so unattainable. Would that it were permitted me to strive for
  this goal in <i>my</i> way!"</p>

  <p>His reflections and dreams were interrupted by a messenger from the
  outposts, announcing that the enemy had suddenly forsaken their camp, and
  were in fall retreat to the south, towards Ravenna. On the road to the west
  clouds of dust were seen: a large body of horsemen was
  approaching&mdash;probably Goths.</p>

  <p>Totila received the news with joy, but also with doubt. He took all
  necessary measures against a stratagem.</p>

  <p>But during the night his doubts were resolved. He was awakened by the news
  of a Gothic victory, and the arrival of the victor.</p>

  <p>He hurried out and found Hildebrand, Teja, Thorismuth, and Wachis.</p>

  <p>With the cry of "Victory! victory!" his friends greeted him, and Teja and
  Hildebrand announced that at Ticina, and Verona also, the country-people had
  rebelled against the Byzantines, and had aided the Goths in falling upon the
  besiegers, whom, after destroying their defences, they had forced to
  retreat.</p>

  <p>But in spite of this joyful news, there lay in Teja's eyes and voice a
  deeper melancholy than usual.</p>

  <p>"What of sorrow hast thou to communicate, beside this joy?" asked
  Totila.</p>

  <p>"The shameful ruin of the best man in the world!" said Teja, and signed to
  Wachis, who now related the sufferings and death of the King and his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"I escaped the arrows of the Huns by hiding amongst the rushes. Thus I
  still live. But only for one thing; that is, to revenge my master upon his
  betrayer and murderer&mdash;Cethegus the Prefect."</p>

  <p>"No; the Prefect is mine!" said Teja.</p>

  <p>"Thou, Totila, hast the first right to his life," said Hildebrand, "for
  thou hast a brother to revenge."</p>

  <p>"My brother Hildebad!" cried Totila. "What of him?"</p>

  <p>"He has been shamefully murdered by the Prefect," said Thorismuth, "before
  my very eyes, and I could not prevent it."</p>

  <p>"My strong Hildebad dead!" exclaimed Totila. "Speak!"</p>

  <p>"The hero lay with us in the Castle of Castra Nova, near Mantua," related
  Thorismuth. "The report of the King's treacherous death had reached us.
  Hildebad challenged Belisarius and Cethegus to mortal combat. Presently a
  herald arrived, who said that Belisarius had accepted the challenge, and
  expected thy brother on the plain between our walls and their camp. Thy
  brother set forth rejoicing; we horsemen followed. And verily, there rode out
  of a tent, in his golden armour, with closed helm and white plume, with his
  round shield&mdash;well known to us all&mdash;the hero, Belisarius. Only
  twelve horsemen followed him; foremost of all, Cethegus the Prefect. The
  other Byzantines halted just outside the camp. Hildebad ordered me to follow
  him with an equal number of horsemen. The two combatants greeted each other
  with their spears; the trumpets sounded, and Hildebad rushed at his enemy.
  The next moment the latter lay upon the ground, pierced through and through.
  Thy brother, unhurt, dismounted, crying: 'That was no thrust from
  Belisarius!' and opened the visor of the dying man. 'Bessas!' cried Hildebad,
  and looked, furious at the deception, towards his enemies. Then the Prefect
  gave a sign. The twelve Moorish horsemen hurled their spears, and, severely
  hit, thy brother fell."</p>

  <p>Totila covered his face. Teja went sympathisingly up to him.</p>

  <p>"Listen to the end," said Thorismuth. "When we saw this murder, we were
  filled with fury. We threw ourselves upon the enemy, who, trusting that we
  should be discouraged, pressed forward from the camp. After a hot fight, we
  compelled them to fly. Only the speed of his devilish horse saved the
  Prefect, who was wounded in the shoulder by my spear. Thy brother lived to
  see our victory. He caused the chest which he had brought from Ravenna to be
  carried down to the Castle; opened it, and said to me: 'Crown, shield, and
  sword of Theodoric. Take them to my brother.' And with his last breath he
  cried: 'He must revenge me and renew our kingdom. Tell him&mdash;that I loved
  him very dearly!' Then he sank back upon his shield, and his faithful soul
  departed."</p>

  <p>"My brother! Oh, my beloved brother!" cried Totila, leaning against a
  pillar. Tears flowed from his eyes.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of reverent silence.</p>

  <p>Then: "Remember thine oath!" cried Hildebrand. "He was doubly thy brother!
  Thou wilt revenge him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Totila, and involuntarily he drew the sword&mdash;which Teja
  handed to him&mdash;from its sheath. "I will revenge him!"</p>

  <p>It was the sword of Theodoric.</p>

  <p>"And renew the kingdom," said old Hildebrand solemnly, and, taking the
  crown, he set it upon Totila's head. "Hail to thee, King of the Goths!"</p>

  <p>Totila started.</p>

  <p>He raised his left hand to the golden coronet.</p>

  <p>"What do ye?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"That which is right. The dying hero's words were prophecy! Thou wilt
  surely renew the kingdom. Three victories call upon thee to take up the
  struggle. Remember thine oath. We are not yet defenceless. Shall we lay down
  our weapons? Shall we submit to treachery and tricks?"</p>

  <p>"No," cried Totila, "that we will not. And it is well done to choose a
  king, as a sign of renewed hope. But here stands Earl Teja, worthier than I,
  of proved experience. Choose Teja!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Teja, shaking his head, "it is thy turn first! Thy dying
  brother has sent <i>thee</i> this sword and crown. Wear them happily! If the
  kingdom can be saved, it is thou who canst save it; if not, an avenger must
  be left."</p>

  <p>"But now," interrupted Hildebrand, "now we must hasten to sow the seeds of
  confidence in all hearts. This is thine office, Totila! See, the young day
  breaks in glory. The first rays of the sun fall into the hall and kiss, thy
  brow! It is a sign from the gods! Hail, King Totila&mdash;thou that shalt
  renew the Gothic kingdom!"</p>

  <p>The youth pressed the glittering crown firmly upon his golden locks, and
  raised Theodoric's sword towards the morning sun.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he cried, "if human strength can do it, I will raise anew the
  kingdom of the Goths."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-2"
     name="b5a-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">And King Totila kept his word.</p>

  <p>Once again he raised the Goths, whose sole hold on Italy was embodied in a
  few thousand men and three cities, to a great power, greater even than in the
  days of Theodoric.</p>

  <p>He drove the Byzantines out of all the towns of Italy, with one fatal
  exception.</p>

  <p>He won back the islands of Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicilia.</p>

  <p>And still more: he victoriously crossed the old limits of the kingdom,
  and, as the Emperor obstinately refused recognition of the Gothic rule and
  possession, sent his royal fleet to carry terror and devastation into the
  provinces of the Eastern Empire.</p>

  <p>And Italy, in spite of the continuance of the war&mdash;which was never
  quite extinguished&mdash;bloomed under his government as in the time of
  Theodoric.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that the legends both of the Goths and Italians celebrate
  this fortunate King, now as the grandchild of Numa Pompilius, Titus, or
  Theodoric, now as the spirit of the latter, returned to earth in youthful
  form, to restore and bless his well-beloved kingdom.</p>

  <p>As the morning sun, issuing from the clouds of night, irresistibly spreads
  light and blessing abroad, so Totila's arms brought happiness to Italy.</p>

  <p>The dark shadows retreated step by step at his approach. Victory flew
  before him, and the gates of the cities and the hearts of men opened to him
  almost without a struggle.</p>

  <p>The manly qualities&mdash;the genius of a general and a ruler&mdash;which
  had slumbered in this fair youth, which were only guessed at by Theodoric and
  Teja, and known to their full extent to no one, were now gloriously
  displayed.</p>

  <p>The youthful freshness of his nature, far from being destroyed by the hard
  trials of the last years, by the sufferings which he had endured in Neapolis
  and before Rome, by the long absence from his beloved Valeria, from whom he
  was parted farther and farther by every fresh victory of the Byzantines, had
  only deepened into more earnest manliness. The bright sympathy of his manner
  remained, and cast the charm of amiability and heartfelt kindness over all
  his actions.</p>

  <p>Sustained by his own ideality, he tamed trustingly to the ideal in his
  fellow-men; and almost all, except those governed by some diabolical power,
  found his confident appeal to what was noble and good irresistible.</p>

  <p>As light illumines whatever it shines upon, so the noble-heartedness of
  this glorious King seemed to communicate itself to his courts to his
  associates, and even to his adversaries.</p>

  <p>"He is irresistible as Apollo!" said the Italians.</p>

  <p>More closely regarded, we find that the secret of his great and rapid
  success lay in the genial art with which&mdash;following the inmost impulse
  of his nature&mdash;he contrived to transmute the bitterness of the Italians
  against Byzantine oppression into sympathy with the benevolence of the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>We have seen how this feeling of bitterness had taken root amongst the
  peasants, the farmers, the rich merchants, the artisans, and the middle and
  lower ranks of the citizens; in fact, among the greater part of the
  population.</p>

  <p>And later, when the Goths marched to the field of battle with the
  jubilating cry of "Totila!" the personality of the young King completely
  estranged the Italians from their Byzantine oppressors, who seemed to be
  totally forsaken by the fortune of war.</p>

  <p>It is true that a minority remained uninfluenced: the Orthodox Church,
  which knew of no peace with heretics; hard-headed Republicans; and the kernel
  of the Catacomb conspiracy&mdash;the proud Roman aristocrats and the friends
  of the Prefect. But this small minority compared to the mass of the
  population, was of little moment.</p>

  <p>The King's first act was to publish a manifesto to the Goths and
  Italians.</p>

  <p>It was proved to the first that the fall of King Witichis and Ravenna had
  been the work of superior falsehood, and not of superior strength; and the
  duty of revenge, begun already by three victories, was impressed upon
  them.</p>

  <p>And the Italians, having now experienced what kind of exchange they had
  made in revolting to Byzantium, were invited to return to their old
  friends.</p>

  <p>In order to favour this return, the King promised not only a general
  amnesty, but equal rights with the Goths; the abolition of all former Gothic
  privileges; the right of forming a native army; and&mdash;what was especially
  effective by contrast&mdash;the abolition of all taxes upon Italian soil or
  property until the end of the war.</p>

  <p>Further, as the aristocracy favoured the Byzantines&mdash;the farmers, on
  the contrary, the Goths&mdash;it was a measure of the highest prudence which
  provided that every Roman noble who did not, within three months, subject
  himself to the Goths, should lose his landed property in favour of his former
  tenants.</p>

  <p>And, lastly, the King placed a high premium, to be paid out of the royal
  purse, on all intermarriages between Goths and Italians, promising the
  settlement of the pair upon the confiscated property of Roman senators.</p>

  <p>"Italia," concluded the manifesto, "bleeding from the wounds inflicted by
  the tyranny of Byzantium, shall recover and bloom again under my protection.
  Help us, sons of Italia, to drive from this sacred ground our common enemies,
  the Huns and Scythians of Justinianus. Then, in the new-born kingdom of the
  Italians and Goths, a new people shall arise&mdash;begotten of Italian beauty
  and cultivation, of Gothic strength and truth&mdash;whose nobility and
  splendour shall be such as the world has. never yet beheld!"</p>

  <p>When Cethegus the Prefect, awaking at morn on the field-bed to which his
  wound had confined him, heard the news of Totila's accession, he sprang from
  his couch with a curse.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the Grecian physician, "you must take care of yourself
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you not hear? Totila wears the Gothic crown! It is no time now to be
  prudent.&mdash;My helm, Syphax."</p>

  <p>And he snatched the manifesto from the hand of Lucius Licinius, who had
  brought the news, and read eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Is it not ridiculous&mdash;madness?" asked Lucius.</p>

  <p>"Madness it is if the Romans be yet Romans! But are they so? If they are
  not&mdash;then we&mdash;and not the barbarian prince&mdash;work madness. The
  thing must never be put to a trial, but be at once nipped in the bud. The
  blow directed against the aristocracy is a masterpiece. It must not have time
  to take effect. Where is Demetrius?"</p>

  <p>"He marched against Totila last evening. You were asleep. The physician
  forbade us to awaken you, and Demetrius also."</p>

  <p>"Totila king, and you let me sleep! Do you not know that this flaxen-head
  is the very genius of the Goths? Demetrius wishes to win his laurels alone.
  How strong is he?"</p>

  <p>"More than twice as strong as the Goths; twelve thousand to five
  thousand."</p>

  <p>"Demetrius is lost. Up&mdash;to horse! Arm all who can carry a lance.
  Leave only the wounded to guard the walls. This firebrand Totila must be
  trampled out, or an ocean of blood cannot extinguish him. My weapons&mdash;to
  horse!"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen the Prefect look so," said Lucius Licinius to the
  physician. "It must be fever? He grew pale."</p>

  <p>"He is without fever."</p>

  <p>"Then I do not comprehend it, for it cannot be <i>fear</i>. Syphax, let us
  follow him."</p>

  <p>Cethegus urged on his troop indefatigably. So indefatigably, that only a
  small suite of horsemen could keep up with his impatience and the swift hoofs
  of his war-horse.</p>

  <p>At long intervals followed Marcus Licinius, Massurius with Cethegus's
  mercenaries, and Balbus with the hurriedly-armed citizens of Ravenna. For
  Cethegus had indeed left in the fortress only old men, women and children,
  and the wounded soldiers.</p>

  <p>At last the Prefect succeeded in communicating with the rear-guard of the
  Byzantines.</p>

  <p>Totila was marching from Tarvisium southwards against Ravenna.</p>

  <p>He was joined by numerous bands of armed Italians from the provinces of
  Liguria, Venetia, and Æmilia, who had been roused by his manifesto into new
  hope and new resolve.</p>

  <p>They desired to fight with him his first battle against the
  Byzantines.</p>

  <p>"No," Totila had answered their general; "you shall decide upon what you
  will do <i>after</i> the battle. We Goths will fight alone. If we win, then
  you may join us. If we lose, then the revenge of the Byzantines will not
  affect you. Await the result."</p>

  <p>The report of such magnanimous sentiments attracted many more to the
  Gothic flag.</p>

  <p>Besides this, Totila's army was reinforced from hour to hour, during the
  march, by the arrival of Gothic warriors, who, singly, or in small bands, had
  come out of prison or left their hiding-places when they heard of the
  treachery practised on King Witichis, the accession of a new King, and the
  renewal of the war.</p>

  <p>The haste with which Totila pressed forward, in order to avail himself of
  the enthusiasm of his troops before it had time to cool, and the zeal with
  which Demetrius flew to meet him, soon brought the two armies in sight of
  each other.</p>

  <p>It was at the bridge across the Padus, named Pons Padi.</p>

  <p>The Byzantines stood in the plain; they had the river, which they had
  crossed with half their foot, at their backs.</p>

  <p>The Goths appeared upon the gently-sloping hills towards the
  north-west.</p>

  <p>The rays of the setting sun dazzled the eyes of the Byzantines.</p>

  <p>Totila, from the hill, observed the position of the enemy.</p>

  <p>"The victory is mine!" he cried to his troops, and, drawing his sword, he
  swooped upon his enemies like a falcon on his prey.</p>

  <p>Cethegus and his followers had reached the last deserted camp of the
  Byzantines shortly after sunset.</p>

  <p>They were met by the first fugitives.</p>

  <p>"Turn, Prefect," cried the foremost horseman, who recognised him, "turn
  and save yourself! Totila is upon us! He cleaved the helm and head of
  Artabazes, the best captain of the Armenians, with his own hand!" And the man
  continued his flight.</p>

  <p>"A god led the barbarians!" cried a second. "All is lost&mdash;the
  commander-in-chief is taken!"</p>

  <p>"This King Totila is irresistible!" cried a third, trying to pass the
  Prefect, who blocked his way.</p>

  <p>"Tell that in hell!" cried Cethegus, and struck him to the earth.
  "Forward!"</p>

  <p>But he had scarcely given the command when he recalled it.</p>

  <p>For already whole battalions of vanquished Byzantines came flying through
  the wood towards him. He saw that it would be impossible to stem the flight
  of these masses with his small troop.</p>

  <p>For some time he watched the movement irresolutely.</p>

  <p>The Gothic pursuers were already visible in the distance, when Vitalius,
  one of Demetrius's captains, came wounded up to Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Oh, friend," he cried, "there is no stopping them! They will now go on
  till they reach Ravenna."</p>

  <p>"I verily believe it," said Cethegus. "They will more likely carry my men
  away with them than stand and fight."</p>

  <p>"And yet only the half of the victors, under Teja and Hildebrand, follow
  us. The King turned back already on the field of battle. I saw him withdraw
  his troops. He wheeled to the south-west."</p>

  <p>"<i>Whither?</i>" cried Cethegus, becoming attentive. "Tell me again. In
  <i>what</i> direction?"</p>

  <p>"He marched towards the south-west."</p>

  <p>"He is going to Rome!" exclaimed the Prefect, and pulled his horse round
  so suddenly that it reared. "Follow me!&mdash;to the coast!"</p>

  <p>"And the routed army? without leaders!" cried Lucius Licinius. "See how
  they fly!"</p>

  <p>"Let them fly! Ravenna is strong. It will hold out. Do you not hear? The
  Goth is going to <i>Rome</i>! We must get there before him. Follow me to the
  coast&mdash;the way by sea is open. To Rome!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-3"
     name="b5a-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Lovely&mdash;famed far and wide for its beauty&mdash;is the
  valley in which the Passara flows from the north into the rapid Athesis,
  which hurries from the west to the south-east.</p>

  <p>Like a bending figure, which leans longingly towards the beautiful
  Southland, the lofty Mendola rises at a distance from the right bank of the
  river.</p>

  <p>Here, above the junction of the two streams, once lay the Roman settlement
  of Mansio Majæ.</p>

  <p>A little farther up the river, on a dominating rock, stood the Castle of
  Teriolis.</p>

  <p>Now&mdash;from a mountain-"muhr" or "mar" (landslip)&mdash;the town is
  called Meran.</p>

  <p>The Castle has given its name to the Tyrol.</p>

  <p>"Mansio Majæ" is heard even now in the name of the place "Mais," rich in
  pleasant villas.</p>

  <p>But at the time of which we speak an East Gothic garrison lay in the
  Castle of Teriolis, as was the case in all the old Rhætian rock-nests on the
  Athesis, the Isarcus, and the Oenus, in order to keep down the only
  half-subjected Suevi, Alamanni, and Markomanni, or, as they were already
  named, the Bajuvars, who dwelt in Rhætia, on the Licus, and on the lower
  course of the Oenus.</p>

  <p>But, besides the garrisons of the castles, East-Gothic families had
  settled in larger numbers in the mild and fruitful valley and on the
  willow-covered slopes of the mountains.</p>

  <p>Even now a singular, noble, and grave beauty distinguishes the peasants of
  the valleys of Meran, Ultner, and Sarn. These reticent people are much more
  refined, pensive, and aristocratic than the Bajuvar type on the Inn, the
  Lech, and the Isar.</p>

  <p>Their dialect and legends support the supposition that here some few
  remains of the Goths continued to flourish; for the legends of the Amelungs,
  Dietrich of Bern, and the Rose-garden, still live in the names of the places
  and the traditions of the people.</p>

  <p>Upon one of the highest mountains on the left shore of the Athesis, a Goth
  named Iffa had before-times settled; his descendants continued the
  settlement.</p>

  <p>The mountain is named the "Iffinger" to this day. Upon the southern slope,
  half-way up, the simple settlement was fixed. The Gothic emigrants had found
  it already cultivated. The Rhætian alpine-house, which Druses had met with
  when he conquered the Rasenian mountain-people, had suffered no change in its
  characteristic and commodious form through the Roman conquerors, who built
  their villas in the valley, and their watch-towers on dominating rocks.</p>

  <p>All the Romanised inhabitants of the Eltsch valley had, after the
  East-Gothic invasion, remained in quiet possession of their property.</p>

  <p>For not here, but farther east, from the Save and over the Isonzo, had the
  Goths pressed forward into the peninsula; and only when Ravenna and Odoacer
  had fallen, did Theodoric spread his hosts in a peaceful and regular manner
  over North Italy and the Etschland.</p>

  <p>Thus Iffa and his people had peacefully shared the soil with the Roman
  settlers whom they found upon the mountain, which at that time still
  possessed its Rasenian name.</p>

  <p>A third of the arable land, the meadows and woods; a third part of the
  house, slaves, and animals, was, here as everywhere, claimed by the Gothic
  settler from the Roman farmer.</p>

  <p>In the course of years, however, the Roman <i>hospes</i> had found this
  close and involuntary vicinity to the barbarians inconvenient. He therefore
  left the rest of his property on the mountains to the Goths, in exchange for
  thirty yoke of the splendid oxen which the Germans had brought with them from
  Pannonia&mdash;and which they so well understood how to breed&mdash;and went
  southwards, where the Romans dwelt in greater numbers.</p>

  <p>And so the "Iffinger" had become completely Germanic, for the present
  master had suddenly sold the few Roman slaves which he possessed, and had
  replaced them by men and maids of Germanic race: Gepidians taken in war. This
  master was again named "Iffa," like his ancestor. He lived alone, a
  silver-haired man. A brother, and his wife and daughter-in-law, had, many
  years ago, been buried under a landslip.</p>

  <p>A son, a younger brother, and a son of the latter, had obeyed the call of
  King Witichis to arms, and had never returned from the siege of Rome.</p>

  <p>So no one was left to the old man but his two grandchildren, the boy and
  girl of the son who had fallen.</p>

  <p>The sun had set gloriously behind the mountains which bordered the
  incomparable Etsch valley in the blue distance to the south and west.</p>

  <p>A warm golden lustre lay upon the tender porphyry colouring of the
  "Iffinger," making it glow like red wine.</p>

  <p>Up the mountain slope, upon the top of which stood a dwelling-house with a
  row of stalls a little apart, climbed slowly, step by step, resting ever and
  again, and holding her hands over her eyes as she looked at the sunset, a
  child&mdash;or was it already a maiden?&mdash;who was driving a flock of
  lambs before her.</p>

  <p>She now and then gave her <i>protégées</i> time to crop with dainty tooth
  the aromatic Alpine herbs which grew in their path, and beat time with the
  hazel stick which she carried to an ancient and simple melody, the words of
  which she was softly singing:</p>

  <p>"Little lambkins, Follow freely; By your shepherd's Hand led heedful; Like
  the heaven's Lovely lambkins, Like the quiet Steady stars, that Shining,
  sparkling, Obey ever Their bright shepherd, Mustered by the Mild moon ever,
  Without trouble, Without pause."</p>

  <p>She ceased, and bent forward to look over into a deep ravine on her left
  hand, which had been hollowed out in the steep slope by a rapid mountain
  brook. Now, being summer, the water was very shallow. On the opposite side
  the hill again rose steeply upward.</p>

  <p>"Where can he be?" the girl said; "usually his goats are already
  descending the hill when the sun has turned to gold. My flowers will fade
  soon!"</p>

  <p>She seated herself upon a stone near the path, let the lambs graze, laid
  the hazel stick beside her, and allowed the apron of sheepskin, which, till
  now, she had held up carefully, to fall. A shower of the loveliest Alpine
  flowers fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>She began to wind a wreath.</p>

  <p>"The blue speik will suit his brown hair the best," she said as she worked
  busily. "I get much more tired when I drive the flock alone than when he is
  with me. And yet then we climb much higher. I wonder how it is! How my naked
  feet burn! I might go down to the brook and cool them. And then I should see
  him sooner when he comes along the height. The sun does not scorch any
  more."</p>

  <p>She took off the large broad pumpkin leaf which she wore instead of a hat;
  and now was seen the shining colour of her pale golden hair&mdash;so fair it
  was!&mdash;which, stroked back from the temples, was tied together at the
  back of the head with a red ribbon. Like a flood of sunbeams it rippled over
  her neck, which was only covered by a white woollen kirtle, that, confined at
  the waist with a leather girdle, reached a little above the knees.</p>

  <p>She measured the size of her wreath on her own head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she said, "his head is larger. I will add these Alpine
  roses."</p>

  <p>Then she tied the two ends of the wreath together with delicate grasses,
  sprang up, shook the remaining flowers from her lap, took the wreath in her
  left hand, and turned to descend the steep declivity, at the foot of which
  the brook gurgled amid the stones.</p>

  <p>"No! stop up here and wait! Thou, too, darling White Elf! I will come back
  directly."</p>

  <p>And she drove back the lambs, which had tried to follow, and which now,
  bleating, looked wistfully after their mistress.</p>

  <p>With great agility the practised girl sprang down the ravine; now holding
  fast to the tough shrubs, spurge-olives, and yellow willow; now boldly
  leaping from rock to rock.</p>

  <p>The loose stones broke and the fragments came rattling after her. As she
  merrily jumped after the rolling pebbles, she suddenly heard a sharp and
  threatening hiss from below.</p>

  <p>Before she could turn, a great copper-brown snake, which had no doubt been
  disturbed from sunning itself on a stone, coiled itself up, ready to dart at
  her naked feet.</p>

  <p>The child was alarmed; her knees trembled, and screaming loudly, she
  called:</p>

  <p>"Adalgoth, help! help!"</p>

  <p>A clear voice immediately replied to this cry of fear with the words,
  "Alaric! Alaric!" which sounded like a battle-cry.</p>

  <p>The bushes on the right creaked and cracked; stones rolled down the slope,
  and, swift as an arrow, a slender boy in a rough wolf-skin flew between the
  hissing snake and the affrighted maiden.</p>

  <p>He hurled his strong Alpine stick like a spear, and with so true an aim
  that the small head of the snake was transfixed to the ground. Its long body
  twined convulsively round the deadly shaft.</p>

  <p>"Gotho, thou art not wounded?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks to thee, thou hero!"</p>

  <p>"Then let me say the snake-charm before the viper ceases to struggle; it
  will ban all its fellows for three leagues around."</p>

  <p>And lifting the three first fingers of his right hand, the boy repeated
  the ancient saying:</p>

  <p>"Woe! thou wolf-worm, Wriggle wildly! Bite the bushes, Poisonous panting:
  Men and maidens, Hurt thou shalt not. Down, black devil, Venomous viper, Down
  and die now! High o'er the heads Of scaly-bright serpents Steppeth the race
  of the glorious Goths!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-4"
     name="b5a-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">As he finished speaking, and was bending to examine the
  snake, the girl suddenly placed the wreath which she had made upon his curly
  auburn hair.</p>

  <p>"Hail, hero and helper! Look! the victor's wreath was ready for thee. Ah!
  how well the blue flowers become thee!" And she clapped her hands
  joyfully.</p>

  <p>"Thy foot is bleeding!" said Adalgoth anxiously; "let me suck the wound.
  If the poisonous snake has bitten thee!"</p>

  <p>"It was only a sharp stone. Thou wouldst better like to die thyself?"</p>

  <p>"For thee, Gotho, how gladly! But the poison is harmless in the mouth. Now
  let me wash thy wound. I have still some vinegar and water left in my gourd.
  And then I will put sage-leaves upon it, and healing endive."</p>

  <p>Thus saying, he gently made her sit down upon a stone, lifted her naked
  foot and dropped the mixture out of the gourd upon it. This done, he sprang
  up, looked about in the grass, and presently returned with some soothing
  herbs, which he tied carefully over the wound with the leather strap which he
  loosened from his own foot.</p>

  <p>"How kind thou art, dear boy!" said the girl, stroking his hair.</p>

  <p>"Now let me carry thee&mdash;only up the hill?" he begged; "I should so
  like to hold thee in my arms!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed thou shalt not!" she laughed, as she sprang up; "I am no wounded
  lamb! See how I can run. But where are thy goats?"</p>

  <p>"There they come out from the juniper-trees. I will call them."</p>

  <p>And putting his shepherd's-pipe to his mouth, he blew a shrill note,
  swinging his stick round his head.</p>

  <p>The sturdy goats came leaping towards him&mdash;fearing punishment.</p>

  <p>And now, laying his arm tenderly about the girl's neck, and strewing a
  stripe of salt from his pocket upon the earth, which the goats, following,
  eagerly licked up, Adalgoth went up the slope.</p>

  <p>"But tell me, dearest," said Gotho, when they had arrived at the top of
  the hill, and she was gathering her lambs together, "why thy cry was again
  'Alaric! Alaric!' just as when thou madest the eagle leave my little White
  Elf, which it had already seized in its talons?"</p>

  <p>"That is my battle-cry."</p>

  <p>"Who taught it thee?"</p>

  <p>"Grandfather; the first time he took me with him to hunt wolves. The time
  when I got this skin from Master Isegrim's ribs. As I sprang at the wolf,
  which could not escape and turned to attack me, crying 'Iffa,' just as I had
  always heard grandfather cry, he said, 'Thou must not cry "Iffa," Adalgoth.
  When thou attackest a hero or a monster, cry "Alaric!" it will bring thee
  luck.'"</p>

  <p>"But none of our ancestors are so named, brother. We know all their
  names."</p>

  <p>They had now reached the stalls, into which they drove the animals, and
  then seated themselves before an open window upon a wooden bench, which ran
  round the front of the house on each side of the door.</p>

  <p>"There are," counted Gotho, "first Iffamer, our father; and Uncle Wargs,
  who was buried by the mountain; then Iffa, our grandfather; Iffamuth, our
  other uncle; Iffaswinth, his son; and Iffarich, our great-grandfather; and
  Iffa again&mdash;but no Alaric."</p>

  <p>"And yet I feel as if I had often heard that name at the time when I used
  first to run about the mountain; when the great landslip killed Uncle Wargs.
  And I like the name. Grandfather has told me about a hero-king who was called
  so; who was first of all the heroes to conquer the fortress of
  Roma&mdash;thou knowest, it is the city from which father and Uncle Iffamuth
  and Cousin Iffaswinth never returned. And that hero died young, like
  Siegfried, the dragon-killer, and Balthar, the heathen god. And his grave is
  in a deep river. There he lies on his golden shield, under his treasures, and
  tall reeds bend and wave above him. And now another king has arisen, who is
  called Totila, as the warriors who relieved the garrison over there in the
  Castle of Teriolis told me. They say he is just like that Alaric, and like
  Siegfried and the Sun-god. And grandfather says that I also shall become a
  warrior and go down to King Totila and rush into the fray with the cry of
  'Alaric! Alaric!' Long ago I got tired of climbing about and keeping goats
  here on the mountains, where there is nothing to fight but wolves, or at most
  a bear which eats up the grapes and honey-combs. You all praise my
  harp-playing and my songs, but I feel that they are not worth it, and that I
  cannot learn much more from the old man. I should like to sing better things.
  I am never tired of listening to the soldiers' stories about the victories of
  glorious King Totila. Lately I gave the best chamois I ever shot to old
  Hunibad&mdash;whom the King sent up here to nurse his wounds&mdash;so that he
  might tell me, for the third time, all about the battle at the bridge across
  the Padus, and how King Totila himself overthrew that black devil, the
  dreadful Cethegus. And I have made a song about it, which begins:</p>

  <p>"Tremble, thou traitor, Cunning Cethegus; Tricks will not serve thee; Teja
  the terrible Daunts thy defiance. And brightly arises, Like morning and
  May-time, Like night from the darkness, The favourite of Heaven, The bright
  and the beautiful King of the Goths.</p>

  <p>"But it goes no further; and I can make no more poetry alone. I need a
  master for the words and the harp. I should like to finish a song that I have
  began about the spear-hurler Teja, whom they call the 'Black Earl,' and who
  is said to play the harp wonderfully. And long ago&mdash;but this I tell to
  thee alone&mdash;I should have run away without asking grandfather, who
  always says I am too young yet, if <i>one</i> thing did not keep me
  back."</p>

  <p>He sprang hastily up.</p>

  <p>"What is that, brother?" asked Gotho, who sat quite still and looked full
  at him with her large blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nay, if thou dost not guess it," he answered almost angrily, "I cannot
  tell thee. But now I must go and forge some new arrow-points in the smithy.
  First give me one more kiss&mdash;there! And now let me kiss each of thine
  eyes, and thy fair hair. Good-bye, dear sister, until supper-time."</p>

  <p>He left her and ran to a side building, before the door of which stood a
  grind-stone and various implements.</p>

  <p>Gotho rested her cheek upon her hand, and looked thoughtful. Then she said
  aloud:</p>

  <p>"I cannot guess it; for of course he would take me with him. We could not
  live apart."</p>

  <p>She rose with a slight sigh, and went to a field near the house, to look
  after the linen which was lying there bleaching.</p>

  <p>But now old Iffa rose from his seat behind the open window, where he had
  heard all that had passed.</p>

  <p>"This will not do," he cried, rubbing his head hard. "I never yet had the
  heart to separate the children&mdash;for they were but children! I always
  waited and waited; and now I think I have put it off a little too long. Away
  with thee, young Adalgoth!"</p>

  <p>He left the dwelling-house, and walked slowly to the smithy. He found the
  boy working busily. With puffed-out cheeks, he blew into the fire on the
  hearth, and held the already roughly-prepared arrow-points in it, in order to
  make them red-hot and fit for the hammer. Then he took them out with a pair
  of pincers, laid them on an anvil, and hammered out neat points and hooks.
  Without pausing in his work, he nodded silently to his grandfather, striking
  sturdily upon the anvil till the sparks flew.</p>

  <p>"Well," thought the old man, "just now, at least, he thinks of nothing but
  arrows and iron."</p>

  <p>But suddenly the young smith finished his work with a tremendous stroke,
  threw away the hammer, passed his hand across his hot forehead, and asked,
  turning sharply to the old man:</p>

  <p>"Grandfather, where do men come from?"</p>

  <p>"Jesus, Woden, and Maria!" exclaimed the old man, starting back. "Boy, how
  comest thou to such thoughts?"</p>

  <p>"The thoughts come to me, not I to them. I mean the first men&mdash;the
  very first. That tall Hermegisel over there in Teriolis, who ran away from
  the Arian church at Verona, and can read and write, says that the Christian
  God made a man in a garden out of clay, and, while he slept, took one of his
  ribs and made a woman. That is ridiculous; for out of the longest rib that
  ever was, one could not make ever so small a girl."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't believe it either," the old man thoughtfully confessed. "It
  is difficult to imagine. And I remember that my father once said, as he was
  sitting by the hearth, that the first men grew upon trees. But old
  Hildebrand, who was his friend, although he was much older&mdash;and who
  stopped here on his way back from an expedition against the savage Bajuvars,
  and who was sitting near father, for it was early in the year, and very rough
  and cold&mdash;<i>he</i> said that it was all right about the trees; only
  that men did not grow on them, but that two heathen gods&mdash;Hermegisel
  called them demons&mdash;once found an ash and an alder lying on the
  sea-shore, and from them they framed a man and a woman. They still sing an
  old song about it. Hildebrand knew a few words of it, but my father could not
  remember it."</p>

  <p>"I would rather believe that. But, at all events, there were very few
  people at the beginning?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure."</p>

  <p>"And at first there was only <i>one</i> family?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"And the old ones generally died before the young ones?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Then I tell thee what, grandfather. Either the race of men must have died
  out, or, as it still exists&mdash;and thou seest that is what I am coming
  to&mdash;brothers and sisters must often have married each other, until more
  families were formed."</p>

  <p>"Adalgoth, the fairies are riding thee! Thou speakest nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. And, in short, if it could happen before, it can happen now;
  and I will have my sister Gotho for my wife."</p>

  <p>The old man ran to stop the boy's mouth by force; but the lad evaded him
  and said:</p>

  <p>"I know all that thou wouldst say. The priests from Tridentum would soon
  get to know of it here, and tell the King's Earl. But I can go with her to
  some distant land, where no one knows us. And she will go with me, I
  know."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Thou knowest that already?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I am sure."</p>

  <p>"But this thou dost not know, Adalgoth," the old man now said, gravely and
  decidedly: "that to-night is the last which thou wilt spend upon the
  'Iffinger.' Up, Adalgoth! I command thee&mdash;I, thy grandfather and
  guardian! Thou hast a sacred duty to perform&mdash;the duty of revenge! Thou
  wilt fulfil it at the court, and with the army of Totila. A duty bequeathed
  to thee by thine uncle Wargs&mdash;bequeathed to thee by thine ancestor. Thou
  art now old and strong enough to undertake it. To-morrow, at dawn of day,
  thou wilt start for the south&mdash;for Italia, where King Totila punishes
  evil-doers, helps the good cause, and fights against that wretch, Cethegus.
  Follow me to my chamber. I have to hand over to thee a jewel, which was left
  for thee by thine uncle Wargs, and to give thee many a word of counsel. But
  do not speak about it to Gotho; do not make her heart heavy. If thou obeyest
  thine uncle's orders and my counsel, thou wilt become a mighty and joyous
  hero in King Totila's court. And then, but only then, thou shalt again see
  Gotho!"</p>

  <p>Very grave and pale, the youth followed his grandfather into the house.
  There, in the old man's chamber, they talked in low voices for a long
  time.</p>

  <p>At supper, Adalgoth was missing.</p>

  <p>He sent word to Gotho by their grandfather that he had gone to bed, being
  more tired than hungry.</p>

  <p>But at night, when Gotho slept, he went into her room on tiptoe. The moon
  threw a soft light upon her angel face.</p>

  <p>Adalgoth stopped upon the threshold, and only stretched out his right hand
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"I shall see thee again, my Gotho," he cried, and signed a farewell.</p>

  <p>Presently he crossed the threshold of the simple alpine cottage.</p>

  <p>The stars had scarcely begun to pale; fresh and exhilarating the
  night-wind blew from the mountains around his temples.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the silent sky.</p>

  <p>All at once a falling star shot in a bright semicircle over his head. It
  fell towards the south.</p>

  <p>The youth raised his shepherd's staff, and cried:</p>

  <p>"The stars beckon thither! Now beware, Cethegus the traitor!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-5"
     name="b5a-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">On seeing the disastrous result of the battle at the bridge
  across the Padus, the Prefect had sent messengers back to his troops and the
  armed citizens of Ravenna, who were following him, to order them to return at
  once to the latter city. He left the defeated troops of Demetrius to their
  fate.</p>

  <p>Totila had taken all the flags and field-badges of the twelve thousand, a
  thing which, as Procopius angrily writes, "never before happened to the
  Romans."</p>

  <p>Cethegus himself, with his small band of trusty adherents, hastened across
  the Æmilia to the west coast of Italy, which he reached at Populonium. There
  he went on board a swift ship of war, and, favoured by a strong breeze from
  the north-east (sent, as he said, by the ancient gods of Latium), sailed to
  the harbour of Rome&mdash;Portus.</p>

  <p>He could never have succeeded in reaching Rome by land, for, after
  Totila's victory, all Tuscany and Valeria fell to the Goths; the plains
  unconditionally, and also such cities as were held by weak Byzantine
  garrisons.</p>

  <p>Near Mucella, a day's march from Florence, the King once again vanquished
  a powerful army of Byzantines, under the command of eleven disunited leaders,
  who had gathered together the imperial garrisons of the Tuscan fortresses to
  block his way. The commander-in-chief of this army, Justinus, escaped to
  Florence with difficulty.</p>

  <p>The King treated his numerous prisoners with such lenity, that very many
  Italians and imperial mercenaries deserted their flag and joined the Gothic
  army.</p>

  <p>And now all the roads of Central Italy were covered by Goths and natives
  who hastened to join Totila on his march to Rome.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the latter city, Cethegus had at once taken the necessary
  measures for its defence.</p>

  <p>For Totila, after this new victory at Mucella, approached rapidly,
  scarcely detained by anything but the ovations made to him by the cities and
  castles on his way, which rivalled each other in opening wide their gates to
  the conqueror.</p>

  <p>The few forts which still resisted were invested by small divisions of
  Italians, kept in order by a few chosen Gothic troops. Totila was enabled to
  do this without weakening his army, as, during his march to Rome, his power
  was increased, like a river, by the inflowing of greater or smaller parties
  of Goths and Italians. Not only did the Italian peasants join him by
  thousands, but even the mercenaries of Belisarius, who for months had
  received no pay, now offered their weapons to the Goths, so that a few days
  after the arrival of the Prefect, Totila led a very considerable army before
  the walls of Rome.</p>

  <p>With loud hurrahs the troops in the Gothic encampment greeted the arrival
  of the brave Duke Guntharis, Wisand the bandalarius. Earl Markja, and old
  Grippa, whose release Totila had procured by exchanging them for the
  prisoners taken at the battle of the Padus.</p>

  <p>And now the almost impossible task was laid upon Cethegus of manning
  effectually his grandly-designed fortifications. The whole army of Belisarius
  was missing&mdash;besides the greater part of his own soldiers, who were
  slowly sailing to the harbour of Portcus from Ravenna.</p>

  <p>In order, even insufficiently, to defend the entire circle of the
  ramparts, Cethegus was obliged, not only to demand unusual and unexpected
  exertions from the Roman legionaries, but also to increase their numbers by
  despotic measures.</p>

  <p>From boys of sixteen years of age to old men of sixty, he called "all the
  sons of Romulus, Camillus, and Cæsar to arms; to protect the sanctuary of
  their forefathers against the barbarians."</p>

  <p>But his appeal was scarcely read or propagated, and was responded to by
  very few volunteers; while he saw with mortification that the manifesto of
  the Gothic King, which was thrown every night over the walls in many places,
  was carried about and read by crowds; so that he angrily proclaimed that
  anyone found picking up, pasting on the walls, or reading this manifesto, or
  in any way facilitating its publication, would be punished by the
  confiscation of his property or the loss of his liberty.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, the manifesto still spread among the citizens, and the
  list of volunteers remained empty.</p>

  <p>He then sent his Isaurians into all the houses to drag boys and old men to
  the walls by force; and very soon he was more feared, and even hated, than
  beloved.</p>

  <p>His stern will, and the gradual arrival of his troops from Ravenna, alone
  checked the growing discontent of the Roman population.</p>

  <p>But in the Gothic camp messengers of good fortune overtook each other.</p>

  <p>Teja and Hildebrand had pursued the Byzantines to the gates of
  Ravenna.</p>

  <p>The defence of that city was conducted by Demetrius, one of the exchanged
  prisoners, and by Bloody Johannes; that of the harbour town of Classis by
  Constantianus against Hildebrand, who had won Ariminum in passing, for the
  citizens had disarmed the Armenian mercenaries of Artasires and opened the
  gates.</p>

  <p>Teja had beaten the troops of the Byzantine general Verus, who had
  defended the crossing of the Santernus; had killed the general with his own
  hand, and had then hastened through the whole of North Italy with the
  manifesto in his left hand, his sword in his right, and in a few weeks had
  won by force or by persuasion all towns and castles as far as Mediolanum.</p>

  <p>But Totila, taught by the experience of the first siege of Rome, would not
  expose his troops by attempting to storm the formidable defences of the
  Prefect, and also desired to spare his future capital.</p>

  <p>"I will get into Rome with linen wings, and on wooden bridges," he one day
  said to Duke Guntharis; left to him the investment of the city; and taking
  all his horsemen with him, marched for Neapolis.</p>

  <p>There in the harbour lay, very inefficiently manned, an imperial
  fleet.</p>

  <p>Totila's march upon the Appian Way through South Italy resembled a
  triumphal procession.</p>

  <p>Those districts which had suffered the longest under the yoke of the
  Byzantines were now most willing to greet the Goths as liberators.</p>

  <p>The maidens of Terracina went to meet the King of the Goths with wreaths
  of flowers.</p>

  <p>The people of Minturnæ brought out a golden chariot, made the King descend
  from his white horse, and dragged him into the town in triumph.</p>

  <p>"Look! look!" was the cry in the streets of Casilinum&mdash;an ancient
  place once dedicated to the worship of the Campanian Diana&mdash;"Phoebus
  Apollo himself has descended from Olympus and comes as a saviour to the
  sanctuary of his sister!"</p>

  <p>The citizens of Capua begged him to impress the first gold coins of his
  reign with the inscription, "<i>Capua revindicata</i>."</p>

  <p>Thus it continued until he reached Neapolis; the very same road he had
  once passed as a wounded fugitive.</p>

  <p>The commander of the Armenian mercenaries in Neapolis, who had a very
  brave but small troop, did not dare to trust the fidelity of the population
  in case of a siege.</p>

  <p>He therefore led his lance-bearers and the armed citizens to meet the King
  outside the gates.</p>

  <p>But before the battle commenced, a man on a white horse rode out of the
  lines of Goths, took his helmet from his head, and cried:</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten me, men of the Parthenopæian city? I am Totila. You
  loved me when I was commander of your harbour. You shall bless me as your
  King. Do you not recollect how I saved in my ships your wives and children
  from the Huns of Belisarius? Listen. These very wives and children are again
  in my power; not as fugitives, but as prisoners. To protect them from the
  Byzantines (perhaps from me also), you sent them into the strong fortress of
  Cumæ. But know that Cumæ has surrendered, and all the fugitives are in my
  power. I have been advised to keep them as hostages in order to compel you to
  capitulate. But that is repugnant to my feelings. I have set them at liberty;
  the wives of the Roman senators I have sent to Rome. But your wives and
  children, men of Neapolis, I have brought with me; not as my hostages, not as
  my prisoners, but as my guests. Look how they stream out of my tents! Open
  your arms to receive them&mdash;they are free! Will you now fight against me?
  I cannot believe it! Who will be the first to aim at this breast?" and he
  opened wide his arms.</p>

  <p>"Hail to King Totila the Good!" was the universal acclamation.</p>

  <p>And the warm-hearted men threw down their weapons, rushed forward, and
  greeted with tears of joy their liberated wives and children, kissing the hem
  of Totila's mantle.</p>

  <p>The commander of the mercenaries rode up to him.</p>

  <p>"My lancers are surrounded and too weak to fight alone. Here, O King, is
  my sword. I am your prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Not so, brave Arsakide! Thou art unconquered&mdash;therefore no prisoner.
  Go with thy troop whither thou wilt."</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> a prisoner, conquered by your magnanimity and the splendour
  of your eyes. Permit us henceforward to fight under your flag."</p>

  <p>In this manner a chosen troop, who stood by him faithfully, was won for
  Totila.</p>

  <p>Amid a shower of flowers he made his entry into Neapolis through Porta
  Nolana.</p>

  <p>Before Aratius, the admiral of the Byzantine fleets could raise the
  anchors of his war-ships, their crews were overpowered by the sailors of the
  many merchant vessels which lay near in the harbour, the masters of which
  were old admirers and thankful <i>protégés</i> of Totila.</p>

  <p>Without shedding a drop of blood, the King had gained a fleet and the
  third city of importance in the kingdom.</p>

  <p>In the evenings during the banquet which the rejoicing inhabitants had
  prepared for him, Totila stole softly away.</p>

  <p>With surprise the Gothic sentinels saw their King, all alone, disappear
  into an old half-fallen tower, close to an ancient olive-tree by the Porta
  Capuana.</p>

  <p>The next day there appeared a decree of Totila which dispensed the women
  and girls of the Jews of Neapolis from a pole-tax which had, until now, been
  laid upon them; and which&mdash;they being forbidden to carry jewels in
  public&mdash;permitted them to wear a golden heart upon the bosom of their
  dress as a mark of distinction.</p>

  <p>In the neglected garden, where a tall stone cross and a deep-sunk grave
  were completely overgrown with wild ivy and moss, there presently arose a
  monument of the most beautiful black marble, with the simple inscription:
  "<i>Miriam from Valeria.</i>"</p>

  <p>But there was no one living in Neapolis who understood its meaning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-6"
     name="b5a-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">There now streamed into Neapolis ambassadors from Campania
  and Samnium, Bruttia and Lucania, Apulia and Calabria, who came to invite the
  Gothic King to enter their cities as a liberator.</p>

  <p>Even the important and strong fortress of Beneventum and the neighbouring
  forts of Asculum, Canusia, and Acheruntia surrendered at discretion.</p>

  <p>In these districts thousands of cases occurred in which the peasants were
  settled upon the lands of their former masters, who had fallen in battle, or
  had fled to Byzantium or to Rome.</p>

  <p>Besides Rome and Ravenna, there were now in the hands of the Byzantines,
  only Florentia, held by Justinus; Spoletium, whose joint governors were Bonus
  and Herodianus; and Perusia, under the Hun, Uldugant.</p>

  <p>In a few days the King, reinforced by many Italians from the south of the
  Peninsula, had new manned his conquered fleet, and left the harbour in full
  sail, while his horsemen marched by land on the Via Appia to the north.</p>

  <p>Rome was the goal of both ships and horse; while Teja, having conquered
  all the country between Ravenna and the Tiber&mdash;Petra and Cæsena fell
  without bloodshed&mdash;the Æmilia and both Tuscanies (the Annonarian and the
  Sub-urbicarian), marched with a third army on the Flaminian Way against the
  city of the Prefect.</p>

  <p>On hearing of these movements, Cethegus was obliged to acknowledge that
  the struggle would now begin in good earnest, and, like a dragon in his den,
  he determined to defend himself to the death.</p>

  <p>With a proud and contented look he viewed the ramparts and towers, and
  said to his brothers-in-arms, who were uneasy at the approach of the
  Goths:</p>

  <p>"Be comforted! Against these invincible walls they shall be broken to
  pieces for the second time!"</p>

  <p>But at heart he was not so easy as his words and looks would seem to
  indicate.</p>

  <p>Not that he ever repented his past deeds or thought his plans
  unachievable. But that when, after repeated reverses, he appeared to have
  arrived at the point of success, he should be as far off the goal as ever
  because of Totila's victories&mdash;this feeling had a great effect upon even
  <i>his</i> iron nerves.</p>

  <p>"Water wears away a rock!" he said, when his friend Licinius once asked
  him why he looked so gloomy. "And besides, I cannot sleep as I used to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Since when?"</p>

  <p>"Since&mdash;Totila! That fair youth has stolen my slumbers!"</p>

  <p>Though the Prefect felt so secure and so superior to all his enemies and
  adversaries, Totila's bright and open nature, and his easily-won success,
  irritated him so much, that his coolness often melted in the heat of his
  passion; while Totila went to meet the universally feared foe with a sense of
  victory which nothing could disquiet.</p>

  <p>"He has luck, the downy-beard!" cried Cethegus, when he heard of the easy
  conquest of Neapolis. "He is as fortunate as Achilles and Alexander. But
  luckily such god-like youths never grow old! The soft gold of such natures is
  quickly worn out. We lumps of native iron last longer. I have seen the
  laurels and roses of the enthusiast, and it seems to me that I shall soon see
  his cypresses. It cannot be that I shall yield to this maiden soul! Fortune
  has borne him rapidly to a dizzy height; she will hurl him down as rapidly
  and dizzily. Will she first carry him over the ramparts of Rome?&mdash;Fly
  then, without effort, young Icarus, in the brightest sunshine. I, through
  blood and strife, step by step, climb up in the shade. But I shall stand on
  high when the treacherous and burning kiss of Fortune has melted the wax on
  thy bold wings. Thou wilt vanish beneath me like a falling star!"</p>

  <p>This, however, did not seem likely to happen soon.</p>

  <p>Cethegus awaited with impatience the arrival of a numerous fleet from
  Ravenna, which was to bring him the remainder of his troops, and all who
  could be spared of the legionaries and the troops of Demetrius, as well as a
  quantity of provisions.</p>

  <p>When these reinforcements had arrived, he would be able to relieve the
  grumbling Romans from their arduous duties.</p>

  <p>For weeks he had comforted the embittered inhabitants with the promise of
  this fleet.</p>

  <p>At last it was announced by a swift-sailer that the fleet had reached
  Ostia.</p>

  <p>Cethegus caused the news to be published in all the streets with a
  flourish of trumpets, and announced that at the next Ides of October, eight
  thousand citizens would be relieved from duty on the walls. He also caused
  double rations of wine to be distributed among the soldiers on the
  ramparts.</p>

  <p>When the Ides of October arrived, thick fog covered Ostia and the sea.</p>

  <p>The day after, a little sailing-boat flew from Ostia to Portus. The
  trembling crew announced that King Totila had attacked the Ravennese triremes
  with the fleet from Neapolis, under the protection of a thick fog. Of the
  eighty ships, twenty were burnt or sunk; the remaining sixty, with all their
  men and provisions, taken.</p>

  <p>Cethegus would not believe it.</p>

  <p>He hurried on board his own swift boat, the <i>Sagitta</i>, and flew down
  the Tiber.</p>

  <p>But with difficulty he escaped the boats of the King, who had already
  blockaded the harbour of Portus and sent small cruisers up the river.</p>

  <p>The Prefect now hastily caused a double river-bolt to be laid across the
  Tiber; the first consisting of masts; the second of iron chains placed an
  arrow's length farther up the river. The space between the two bolts was
  filled with a great number of small boats.</p>

  <p>Cethegus felt deeply the blow which had fallen upon him. Not only had his
  long-wished-for reinforcements fallen into the enemy's hand; not only was he
  obliged to lay still heavier burdens upon the Romans, who began to curse him,
  for now the river, too, had to be defended against the constant attempts of
  the Gothic ships to break through; but with a slight shudder of horror he saw
  approaching nearer and nearer the most terrible of all
  enemies&mdash;famine.</p>

  <p>The water-road, by which he, as formerly Belisarius, had received abundant
  provisions, was now blocked.</p>

  <p>Italy had no third fleet. That of Neapolis and that of Ravenna blockaded
  Rome under the Gothic flag.</p>

  <p>And now the horsemen which Marcus Licinius had sent on the Flaminian Way
  to reconnoitre and forage, came galloping back with the news that a strong
  army of Goths, under the dreaded Teja, was approaching at a quick step. The
  vanguard had already reached Reate.</p>

  <p>The day following Rome was also invested on the last side which had
  remained open&mdash;the north&mdash;and had nothing left to depend upon but
  its own citizens.</p>

  <p>And the latter were weak enough, however strong might be the Prefect's
  will and the walls of the city.</p>

  <p>Yet for weeks and months Cethegus's stern resolution sustained the
  despairing defenders against their will.</p>

  <p>At last the fall of the city, not by force, but by starvation, was
  expected daily.</p>

  <p>At this juncture an unexpected event occurred, which revived the hopes of
  the besieged, and put the genius and good fortune of the young King to a hard
  proof: for there once more appeared upon the scene of
  battle&mdash;Belisarius!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-7"
     name="b5a-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">When news arrived in the golden palace of the Cæsars at
  Byzantium of the lost battles on the Padus and at Mucella; of the renewed
  siege of Rome, and the loss of Neapolis and almost all Italy, the Emperor
  Justinian, who had already imagined the West again united to the East, was
  awakened from his dream of triumph in a terrible manner.</p>

  <p>It was now easy for the friends of Belisarius to prove that the recall of
  that hero had been the origin of all these disasters.</p>

  <p>It was clear that as long as Belisarius had been in Italy victory had
  followed victory; and no sooner had he turned his back, than misfortunes
  crowded one upon the other.</p>

  <p>The Byzantine generals in Italy openly acknowledged that they could not
  replace Belisarius.</p>

  <p>"I am not able," wrote Demetrius from Ravenna, "to meet Totila in the open
  field. Scarcely am I able to defend this fortress in the marshes. Neapolis
  has fallen. Rome may surrender any day. Send us again the lion-hearted man,
  whom, in our vanity, we dreamed we could replace&mdash;the conqueror of the
  Vandals and the Goths."</p>

  <p>And Belisarius, although he had sworn never again to serve the ungrateful
  Emperor, forgot all his wrongs as soon as Justinian smiled upon him. And
  when, after the fall of Neapolis, he actually embraced him and called him
  "his faithful sword"&mdash;in truth, the Emperor had never believed in the
  general's rebellion, but was envious of his sovereign
  position&mdash;Belisarius could no longer be restrained by Antonina and
  Procopius. As, however, the Emperor feared the expense of a second enterprise
  in Italy (besides that of the Persian wars, which Narses conducted
  successfully but expensively in Asia), avarice and ambition produced a
  struggle within him, which would, perhaps, have lasted longer than the
  resistance of Rome and Ravenna, had not Prince Germanus and Belisarius
  proposed an expedient. The noble Prince was impelled by the wish to revisit
  Ravenna and the tomb of Mataswintha, and to revenge her memory on the rude
  barbarians, for Cethegus had declared that the cause of the tragic end of
  this incomparable woman was that her mind had been disordered in consequence
  of her forced marriage with Witichis.</p>

  <p>Belisarius, on his side, could not endure that all his fame should be
  imperilled by Totila's success. "For," asked his enemies at court, "could he
  really have conquered a people who, within the year, had again almost made
  themselves masters of Italy?"</p>

  <p>He had given his word to annihilate the Goths, and he would keep it.</p>

  <p>So, influenced by these motives, Germanus and Belisarius proposed to
  conquer Italy for the Emperor at their own expense. The Prince offered his
  whole fortune for the equipment of a fleet; Belisarius all his lately
  reinforced body-guard and lance-bearers.</p>

  <p>"That is a proposition after Justinian's own heart!" cried Procopius, when
  informed of it by Belisarius. "Not a solidus out of his own pocket! And
  perhaps the laurels of fame and a province for this world, and the wholesale
  destruction of heretics to rejoice Heaven and Theodora! You may be sure that
  he will accept, and give you his fatherly benediction into the bargain. But
  nothing else. You, Belisarius, I know, can be as little kept back as Balan,
  your piebald, when he hears the call of the trumpet; but I will not see your
  lamentable fall."</p>

  <p>"Fall? Wherefore, Raven of Misfortune?"</p>

  <p>"This time you have both Goths and Italians against you. And you could not
  conquer the first when Italy was <i>for</i> you."</p>

  <p>But Belisarius only reproached him with cowardice, and presently went to
  sea with Germanus.</p>

  <p>The Emperor, in fact, gave them nothing but his blessings and the great
  toe of the holy Mazaspes.</p>

  <p>The Byzantines in Italy breathed again when they heard that an imperial
  fleet had anchored off Salona, in Dalmatia, and that the army had landed.</p>

  <p>Even Cethegus, to whom the news was brought by spies, exclaimed with a
  sigh:</p>

  <p>"Better Belisarius in Rome than Totila!"</p>

  <p>And the King of the Goths was filled with anxiety. He determined first of
  all to discover the strength of the Byzantine army, in order to decide upon
  what course he would take. Perhaps it would be necessary to raise the siege
  of Rome, and advance to attack the army of relief.</p>

  <p>Belisarius sailed from Salona to Pola, where he mustered his ships and
  men. While there, two men came to him, who announced themselves to be
  Herulian mercenaries, therefore Goths, but speaking Latin well. They said
  that they had been sent by Bonus, one of the commanders of Spoletium.</p>

  <p>They had succeeded in passing the Gothic lines, and they pressed the
  commander-in-chief to come to the relief of that place. They begged for exact
  particulars as to the strength of his army and the number of his ships, in
  order to be able to revive the sinking courage of the besieged by trustworthy
  reports.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friends," said Belisarius, "you must perforce embellish your
  report; for the truth is, that the Emperor has left me entirely to my own
  resources."</p>

  <p>All the day long he showed these messengers his army and fleet.</p>

  <p>The night following the messengers had disappeared.</p>

  <p>They were Thorismuth and Aligern, who had been sent by King Totila, and
  now furnished him with the much-desired particulars.</p>

  <p>So, from the very beginning, fate was against Belisarius, and the whole
  course of this campaign was unworthy of the fame of that great general.</p>

  <p>It is true that he succeeded in running into the harbour of Ravenna, and
  providing that city with provisions.</p>

  <p>But, the very day that he arrived. Prince Germanus was attacked by a fatal
  malady while visiting the tomb of Mataswintha.</p>

  <p>She had been buried in the vault of the palace, near the graves of her
  brother and the young King Athalaric.</p>

  <p>Germanus died, and, according to his last wish, was buried beside the
  woman he had loved so truly.</p>

  <p>In a little niche in the same vault there reposed a heart which had ever
  beat warmly for Queen "Beautiful-hair."</p>

  <p>Aspa, the Numidian slave, would not outlive her beloved mistress.</p>

  <p>"In my home," she had said, "the virgins of the Goddess of the Sun often
  voluntarily leap into the flames which receive the Godhead. Aspa's goddess,
  the lovely, bright, and kind, has left her. Aspa will not live forlorn in the
  cold and darkness. She will follow her Sun."</p>

  <p>She had heaped up flowers in the death-chamber of her
  mistress&mdash;heaped them still higher than on the day when she had prepared
  the same small room for a bridal chamber&mdash;and had kindled unknown
  combustibles and African resin, the stupefying odours of which drove away all
  the other slaves. But Aspa had spent the night in the room.</p>

  <p>The next morning Syphax, attracted by the well-known but dangerous odour,
  which reminded him of his country's sacrificial customs, went softly into the
  room, which was as silent as the grave. At Mataswintha's feet, her head
  buried in flowers, he had found his Antelope&mdash;dead.</p>

  <p>"She died," he told Cethegus, "for love of her mistress. And now I have
  none left on earth but you."</p>

  <p>After the burial of Germanus, Belisarius left Ravenna with the whole
  fleet.</p>

  <p>But his very next undertaking, an attempt to surprise Pisaurum, was
  repulsed with great loss.</p>

  <p>And King Totila, now acquainted with the small number of Belisarius's
  troops, had sent skirmishers, under the command of Wisand, supported by a few
  ships of war, to take Firmum, which was situated on the same coast, almost
  under the generals very eyes.</p>

  <p>The Byzantines, Herodian and Bonus, surrendered Spoletium to Earl Grippa,
  after the lapse of thirty days, during which they had hoped for
  reinforcements from Belisarius in vain.</p>

  <p>In Assisium the commander of the garrison was a man of the name of
  Sisifrid, a Goth who had deserted in the days of the fall of Witichis.</p>

  <p>This man well knew what was in store for him, should he fall into
  Hildebrand's hands, who besieged the fort in person. Hatred of such treason
  had enticed the old man from the siege of Ravenna to complete this task of
  retribution.</p>

  <p>The Goth obstinately defended the town, but when, during a sally, the axe
  of the old master-at-arms sent him to the other world, the citizens obliged
  the Thracian garrison to yield. Many aristocratic Italians, members of the
  old Catacomb conspiracy, three hundred Illyrian horsemen, and some chosen
  body-guards of Belisarius, were taken prisoners.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards, Placentia, the last town in the Æmilia which was
  held by a Saracen garrison for the Emperor, was forced to capitulate to Earl
  Markja, who commanded the small army of investment.</p>

  <p>In Bruttia, the fortress of Ruscia, the most important harbour for Thurii,
  surrendered to the bold Aligern.</p>

  <p>Belisarius now despaired of reaching Rome by land. On hearing of the
  terrible distress of that city, he determined at once to attempt to relieve
  it by running the blockade of the Gothic fleet.</p>

  <p>But as he sailed round the south point of Calabria, off Hydrunt, a fearful
  storm dispersed his ships; he himself, with a few triremes, was driven
  southward as far as Sicily, and the greater part of his ships, which had
  taken refuge in a bay near Croton, were there surprised and taken by a Gothic
  squadron sent by the King from Rome, which had lain in ambush near
  Squillacium. These prizes proved to be an important addition to the Gothic
  fleet, for, as we shall see hereafter, the Goths, were thereby enabled to
  attack the Byzantines in their islands and coast-towns.</p>

  <p>After this blow, the forces of Belisarius, which had been weak from the
  very first, became completely powerless.</p>

  <p>Generalship and valour could not replace missing ships, warriors, and
  horses.</p>

  <p>The hope that the Italians, as in the first campaign, would revolt to the
  Emperor's commander-in-chief, proved vain.</p>

  <p>Thus the whole enterprise was a complete failure, as we are told by
  Procopius in unsparing words.</p>

  <p>The Emperor left all petitions for reinforcements unanswered. And when
  Antonina repeatedly begged for permission to return, the Empress sent the
  mocking reply, "that the Emperor dare not venture, for the second time, to
  interrupt the hero in the course of his victories."</p>

  <p>So, lying off Sicily, Belisarius spent a miserable time of doubt and
  helplessness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-8"
     name="b5a-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">And meanwhile the suffering and exhaustion of the citizens
  in Rome reached its highest point.</p>

  <p>Hunger thinned the ranks, never very full, of the defenders on the
  walls.</p>

  <p>The Prefect in vain did his utmost. In vain he had recourse to all
  possible measures of persuasion or despotism. In vain he lavishly opened his
  coffers to provide the means of existence for the people.</p>

  <p>For the stores of grain which he had procured from Sicily and garnered in
  the Capitol were exhausted.</p>

  <p>He promised incredible rewards to any boat which should succeed in running
  the blockade of the King's ships and bring provisions to the city; to every
  mercenary who ventured to creep through the gates and the tents of the
  besiegers and bring back food.</p>

  <p>But Totila's watchfulness was not to be deceived.</p>

  <p>At first the promised reward had tempted a few avaricious and daring men
  to venture out at night. But when Earl Teja, next morning, caused their heads
  to be thrown over the walls at the Flaminian Gate, even the most venturesome
  lost all desire to follow their example.</p>

  <p>The dung of animals was sold at a high price.</p>

  <p>Hungry women fought for the weeds and nettles which they found on the
  heaps of rubbish.</p>

  <p>Long since had hunger taught the populace to eat greedily unheard-of
  things.</p>

  <p>And countless deserters fled from the city to the Goths.</p>

  <p>Teja would have forced them to return, in order the sooner to oblige the
  city to surrender; but Totila gave orders that they should be received and
  fed, and that care should be taken that they did not injure themselves by the
  too sudden gratification of their ravenous appetites.</p>

  <p>Cethegus now spent his nights upon the walls. At various hours he himself,
  spear and shield in hand, went the round of the patrols, and sometimes took
  the place of a sentinel who was overcome with hunger or the want of sleep.
  His example certainly had the greatest effect on the brave. The two Licinii,
  Piso, and Salvius Julianus stood by the Prefect and his blindly-devoted
  Isaurians with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>But not so all Romans; not Balbus, the gormandiser.</p>

  <p>"No, Piso," said Balbus one day, "I cannot endure it any longer. It is not
  in a man's power, at least not in mine. Holy Lucullus! who would have thought
  that I should ever give my last and largest diamonds for half a
  rock-marten!"</p>

  <p>"I remember the time," answered Piso, laughing, "when you would have put
  your cook in irons if he had let a lobster boil a minute too long."</p>

  <p>"A lobster! Mercy on us! How can you recall such a picture to my mind! I
  would give my immortal soul for one claw of a lobster, or even for the tail.
  And never to sleep one's fill! To be awakened, if not by hunger, by the
  trumpets of the patrol!"</p>

  <p>"Look at the Prefect! For the last fourteen days he has not slept fourteen
  hours. He lies upon his hard shield, and drinks rain-water out of his
  helmet."</p>

  <p>"The Prefect! He need not eat. He lives upon his pride, like the bear on
  his fat, and sucks his own gall. He is made of nothing but sinews and
  muscles, pride and hatred! But I&mdash;who had accumulated such soft white
  flesh, that the mice nibbled at me when I slept, thinking that I was a
  Spanish ham!&mdash;Do you know the latest news? A whole herd of fat oxen was
  driven into the Gothic camp this morning&mdash;all from Apulia; darlings of
  gods and men!"</p>

  <p>The next day early Piso, with Salvius Julianus, came to wake the Prefect,
  who had lain down on the wall by the Porta Portuensis, close to the most
  important point of defence, the bolt across the river.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me for disturbing your rare slumbers."</p>

  <p>"I was not asleep; I was awake. Tell me your news, tribune."</p>

  <p>"Last night Balbus deserted his post with twenty citizens. They let
  themselves down from the Porta Latina by ropes. Outside there had been heard
  all night long the lowing of Apulian herds. It seems that their bellowing was
  irresistible."</p>

  <p>But the smile of the satirist faded away when he looked at the Prefect's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Let a cross thirty feet high be erected before the house of Balbus in the
  Via Sacra. Every deserter who falls into our hands shall be crucified
  thereon."</p>

  <p>"General&mdash;Constantinus abolished the punishment of crucifixion in the
  name of our Saviour," said Salvius Julianus reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Then I re-introduce the practice in honour of Rome. That Emperor no doubt
  held it to be impossible that a Roman noble and tribune could desert his post
  for the sake of roast meat."</p>

  <p>"I have other news. I can no longer set the watch on the tower of the
  Porta Pinciana. Of the sixteen mercenaries nine are either dead or sick."</p>

  <p>"Almost the same thing is reported by Marcus Licinius, at the Porta
  Tiburtina," said Julianus. "Who can ward off the danger which threatens us on
  all sides?"</p>

  <p>"I! and the courage of the Romans. Go! Let the heralds summon all the
  citizens, who may yet be in the houses, to the Forum Romanum."</p>

  <p>"Sir, there are only women, children, and sick people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Obey, tribune!"</p>

  <p>And with a dark expression on his face the Prefect descended from the
  walls, mounted his noble Spanish charger, and, followed by a troop of mounted
  Isaurians, made a long round through the city, everywhere assuring himself
  that the sentinels were on the alert, and examining the troops; thus giving
  the herald time to summon the people, and the latter to obey. He advanced,
  very slowly, along the right bank of the Tiber. A few ragged people crept out
  of their huts to stare in dull despair at the passing horsemen. Only at the
  Bridge of Cestius did the throng become thicker.</p>

  <p>Cethegus stopped his horse in order to muster the guard on the bridge.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, from the door of a low hut, there rushed a woman with
  dishevelled hair, holding a child in her arms. Another pulled at her ragged
  skirt.</p>

  <p>"Bread? bread?" she asked; "can stones be softened by tears until they
  become bread? Oh no! They remain as hard&mdash;as hard as that man. Look,
  children, that is the Prefect of Rome. He upon the black horse, with the
  crimson crest and the terrible eyes! But I fear him no longer. Look,
  children! that man forced your father to keep watch on the walls day and
  night, until he fell dead. Curses on the Prefect of Rome!"</p>

  <p>And she shook her fist at the immovable horseman.</p>

  <p>"Bread, mother! Give us something to eat," howled the children.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing more for you to eat, but plenty to drink! Come!" screamed
  the woman, and, clasping the elder child round the waist with her right arm,
  and pressing the younger more firmly to her bosom, she cast herself over the
  wall into the river.</p>

  <p>A cry of horror, followed by curses, ran through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"She was mad!" said the Prefect in a loud voice, and rode on.</p>

  <p>"No, she was the wisest of us all!" cried a voice from the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Silence! Legionaries, sound the trumpets! Forwards! To the Forum!"
  commanded Cethegus, and the troop of horsemen galloped away.</p>

  <p>Across the Fabrician Bridge and through the Carmentalian Gate, the Prefect
  arrived in the Forum Romanum at the foot of the Capitoline Hill.</p>

  <p>The wide space appeared almost empty; the few thousand people who, clad in
  miserable garments, crouched upon the steps of the temple and halls, or
  supported themselves on their staffs or spears, made little impression.</p>

  <p>"What does the Prefect want?"&mdash;"What can he want? we have nothing
  left but our lives."&mdash;"And those he will&mdash;" "Do you know that the
  day before yesterday the coast town Centumcellæ surrendered to the
  Goths?"&mdash;"Yes; the citizens overpowered the Prefect's Isaurians and
  opened the gates."&mdash;"Would that we could follow their
  example!"&mdash;"We must do it soon, or it will be too
  late."&mdash;"Yesterday my brother fell down dead, some boiled nettles still
  in his mouth. He was too weak to swallow the mess."&mdash;-"Yesterday in the
  Forum Boarium a mouse was sold for its weight in gold!"&mdash;"For a week I
  got roasted meat from a butcher&mdash;he would not sell the flesh
  raw."&mdash;"You were lucky! They storm all houses where they smell roast
  meat!"&mdash;"But the day before yesterday he was torn to pieces by the mob,
  for he had enticed beggar-children into his house&mdash;and that was the
  flesh he had sold us!"&mdash;"But do you know what the Gothic King does with
  his prisoners? He treats them as a father treats his helpless children; and
  most of them enter his army at once."&mdash;"Yes, and those who will not he
  provides with money for the journey."&mdash;"Yes, and with clothes and shoes
  and provisions. The sick and wounded are nursed."&mdash;"And he gives them
  guides to the coast towns."&mdash;"And sometimes he even pays for their
  passage in merchant-ships to the East."&mdash;"Look, the Prefect
  dismounts!"</p>

  <p>"He looks like Pluto!"</p>

  <p>"He is no longer Princeps Senatus, but Princeps Inferorum."</p>

  <p>"Look at his eyes! As cold as ice, and yet like red-hot arrows."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my godmother is right; she says that only those who have no heart
  can look like that."</p>

  <p>"That is an old tale. Spectres and Lemures have eaten his heart in the
  night."</p>

  <p>"Ah, bah! There are no Lemures. But there is a devil, for it says so in
  the Bible. And the Prefect has sold himself to the devil. The Numidian who is
  holding his black horse by the bridle is an imp from hell, who always
  accompanies him. Nothing can hurt the Prefect. He feels neither hunger nor
  thirst nor the want of sleep. But he can never smile, for he has sold his
  soul!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"The deacon of St. Paul's has explained it all. And it is a sin to serve
  such a man any longer. Did he not betray our Bishop, Silverius, to the
  Emperor, and send him over the sea in chains?"</p>

  <p>"And lately he accused sixty priests, Orthodox and Arian, of treason, and
  banished them from the city."</p>

  <p>"That is true!"</p>

  <p>"And he must have promised the devil that he would torment the
  Romans."</p>

  <p>"But we will endure it no longer. We are free! He himself has often told
  us so. I will ask him by what right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the bold speaker stopped short, for the Prefect glanced at the
  murmuring group as he mounted the rostrum.</p>

  <p>"Quirites," he began, "I call upon you all to become legionaries. Famine
  and treachery&mdash;a shameful thing to say of Romans!&mdash;have thinned the
  ranks of our defenders. Do you hear the sound of hammers? A crucifix is being
  erected to punish all deserters. Rome demands still greater sacrifices from
  her citizens, for <i>they</i> have no choice. The citizens of other towns
  choose between surrender or destruction. We, who have grown up in the shadow
  of the Capitol, have no choice; for more than a thousand years of heroism
  sanctify this place. Here no coward thought dare arise. You cannot again
  endure to see the barbarians tie their horses to the columns of Trajan. We
  must make a last effort. The marrow of heroism ripens early in the
  descendants of Romulus and Cæsar; and late is spent the strength of the men
  who drink of the waters of the Tiber. I call upon all boys from their
  twelfth, all men until their eightieth year, to help to man the walls.
  Silence! Do not murmur. I shall send my tribunes and the lance-bearers into
  every house&mdash;only to prevent boys of too tender years and too aged men
  from volunteering their services&mdash;then why do you murmur? Does any one
  know of something better? Let him speak out boldly; from this place, which I
  now vacate in his favour."</p>

  <p>At this, the group at which the Prefect looked became perfectly
  silent.</p>

  <p>But behind him, amid those whom his eye could not intimidate, there arose
  a threatening cry:</p>

  <p>"Bread!" "Surrender!" "Bread!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus turned.</p>

  <p>"Are you not ashamed? You, worthy of your great name, have borne so much,
  and now, when it is only necessary to hold out a little longer, you would
  succumb? In a few days Belisarius will bring relief."</p>

  <p>"You told us so seven times already!"</p>

  <p>"And after the seventh time Belisarius lost almost all his ships.</p>

  <p>"Which now aid in blocking our harbour!"</p>

  <p>"You should name a term; a limit to this misery. My heart bleeds for this
  people!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the Prefect asked the invisible speaker of the last
  sentence; "you can be no Roman!"</p>

  <p>"I am Pelagius the deacon, a Christian and a priest of the Lord. And I
  fear not man but God. The King of the Goths, although a heretic, has promised
  to restore to the orthodox the churches of which his fellow-heretics, the
  Arians, have deprived them, in every town which surrenders. Three times
  already has he sent a herald to the citizens of Rome with the most lenient
  proposals&mdash;they have never been permitted to speak to us."</p>

  <p>"Be silent, priest! You have no fatherland but heaven; no people but the
  communion of saints; no army but that of the angels. Manage your heavenly
  kingdom, but leave to men the kingdom of the Romans."</p>

  <p>"But the man of God is right!"</p>

  <p>"Set us a term."</p>

  <p>"A short one!"</p>

  <p>"Till then we will still hold out."</p>

  <p>"But if it elapse without relief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then we will surrender!"</p>

  <p>"We will open the gates."</p>

  <p>But Cethegus shunned this thought. Not having received news from the outer
  world for weeks, he had no idea when Belisarius could possibly arrive at the
  mouth of the Tiber.</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried. "Shall I fix a term during which you will remain Romans,
  and after which you will become cowards and slaves! Honour knows no
  term!"</p>

  <p>"You speak thus, because you do not believe in the reinforcements."</p>

  <p>"I speak thus, because I believe in <i>you</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But we will have a term. We are resolved. You speak of Roman freedom! Are
  we free, or are we bound to obey you like your slaves? We demand a term, and
  we will have it."</p>

  <p>"We will have it!" repeated a chorus of voices.</p>

  <p>Before Cethegus could reply, the sound of trumpets was heard from the
  south-eastern corner of the Forum.</p>

  <p>From the Via Sacra advanced a crowd of people, citizens and soldiers; in
  their midst were two horsemen in foreign armour.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-9"
     name="b5a-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">Lucius Licinius galloped before them, sprang off his horse,
  and mounted the tribune.</p>

  <p>"A herald from the Goths! I arrived too late to prevent his entrance as
  usual. The famished legionaries at the Tiburtinian Gate opened it for
  him."</p>

  <p>"Down with him! He must not speak," cried the Prefect, rushing from the
  tribune and drawing his sword.</p>

  <p>But the people guessed his intentions. They surrounded the herald with
  cries of joy, protecting him from the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"Peace!"</p>

  <p>"Hail!"</p>

  <p>"Bread! Peace! Listen to the herald!"</p>

  <p>"No! do not listen to him!" thundered Cethegus. "Who is Prefect of Rome,
  he or I? Who defends this city? I, Cornelius Cethegus Cæsarius; and I tell
  you, do not listen!"</p>

  <p>And he tried to make a way for himself.</p>

  <p>But, thick as a swarm of bees, women and old men threw themselves into his
  path, and the armed citizens surrounded the herald.</p>

  <p>"Speak, herald!" they cried; "what bring you?"</p>

  <p>"Peace and deliverance!" cried Thorismuth, and waved his white wand.
  "Totila, King of the Italians and the Goths, sends you greetings and demands
  a safe-conduct into the city, in order to tell you important news and to
  announce peace."</p>

  <p>"Hail to King Totila!"</p>

  <p>"We will hear him. He shall come!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus had hastily mounted his horse, and now ordered his trumpeters to
  blow a flourish.</p>

  <p>At this well-known sound, all became quiet.</p>

  <p>"Hear me, herald! I, the governor of this city, refuse a safe-conduct. I
  shall treat every Goth who enters this city as an enemy."</p>

  <p>But at these words a cry of rage burst from the multitude.</p>

  <p>"Cornelius Cethegus, are you our officer or our tyrant? We are free. You
  have often vaunted the majesty of the Roman people. And the Roman people
  command that the King shall be heard. Do we not, people of Rome?"</p>

  <p>"We do!"</p>

  <p>"It is according to law," growled the Quirites.</p>

  <p>"You have heard! Will you obey or defy the people of Rome?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus sheathed his sword.</p>

  <p>Thorismuth and his companion galloped off to fetch the King.</p>

  <p>The Prefect signed to the young tribunes to draw near him.</p>

  <p>"Lucius Licinius," he said, "go to the Capitol. Salvius Julianus, you will
  protect the lower river-bolt: the bolt of masts. Quintus Piso, you will
  defend the chain-bolt. Marcus Licinius, you shall keep the bulwark which
  protects the ascent to the Capitoline Hill and the way to my house. The
  mercenaries will follow me."</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do, general?" asked Lucius Licinius, as he was
  preparing to obey the order.</p>

  <p>"Attack and destroy the barbarians."</p>

  <p>There were but fifty horsemen and about a hundred lance-bearers to follow
  the Prefect, when he had sent away the tribunes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the people had waited anxiously for the sound of the Gothic
  horns.</p>

  <p>At last they were heard, and presently there appeared Thorismuth and six
  horn-blowers; Wisand the bandalarius, carrying the royal blue banner of the
  Goths; the King, accompanied by Duke Guntharis and Earl Teja; and about ten
  other leaders, almost all without weapons; only Earl Teja displayed his broad
  and dreaded axe.</p>

  <p>As this procession was on the point of setting forth from the Gothic
  encampment, to ride through the Metronian Gate into the city, Duke Guntharis
  felt some one pull his mantle, and looking down, beheld a boy or youth, with
  short and curly brown hair and blue eyes, standing near his horse, with a
  shepherd's staff in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Art thou the King? No, thou art not he. And that, that is brave Teja, the
  Black Earl, as the songs call him!"</p>

  <p>"What wouldst thou with the King, boy?"</p>

  <p>"I would fight for him."</p>

  <p>"Thou art still too tender. Go, and return two summers hence. And,
  meanwhile, guard thy flocks."</p>

  <p>"I may be young, but I am no longer weak, and I have guarded the flock
  long enough. Ha! I see that that is the King!" and he went up to Totila, and
  bowed gracefully, saying:</p>

  <p>"By thy leave, O King!"</p>

  <p>And he caught the bridle of the horse to lead it, as if it were a matter
  of course.</p>

  <p>The King looked amused, and smiled at the boy.</p>

  <p>And the boy led his horse.</p>

  <p>But Guntharis thought: "I have seen that face before! But no, it is only a
  resemblance; yet such a resemblance I have never seen in my life. And how
  noble is the young shepherd's carriage!"</p>

  <p>"Hail to King Totila! Peace and salvation!" cried the people, as the Goths
  entered the city.</p>

  <p>But the young guide looked up into the King's shining countenance, and
  sang in a soft sweet voice:</p>

  <p>"Cunning Cethegus: Tricks will not serve thee! Teja the terrible Daunts
  thy defiance. And brightly arises, Like morning and May-time, Like night from
  the darkness, The favourite of heaven, The bright, and the beautiful King of
  the Goths! To him are wide opened All halls and all hearts; To him,
  overpowered, Yield Winter and Woe!"</p>

  <p>When the King entered the Forum, there fell a dead silence upon the
  people.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus, who had expected this, immediately took advantage of it. He
  urged his horse into the crowd and cried:</p>

  <p>"What would you, Goth, in this my city?"</p>

  <p>Totila cast one flaming look at him, and then turned away.</p>

  <p>"With <i>him</i> I speak, for evermore, only with my sword! With him, the
  threefold liar and murderer! To <i>you</i> I speak, unhappy and befooled
  inhabitants of Rome! Your sufferings wring my heart. I come to end your
  misery. I come without arms, for I am safer, trusting to the honour of
  Romans, than protected by sword and shield."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>Cethegus no more attempted to interrupt him.</p>

  <p>"Quirites," continued Totila, "you yourselves have truly acknowledged that
  I might long since have stormed your walls with my hosts. For now you have
  but stones, and no men to defend them. But if Rome were carried by storm,
  then Rome would burn; and I confess that I would rather never enter Rome,
  than enter to find it in ashes. I will not reproach you with the manner in
  which you have requited the kindness of Theodoric and the Goths. Have you
  forgotten the time when you coined your gold with the grateful inscription,
  'Roma felix'? Truly you are punished enough; more heavily punished by hunger,
  pestilence, and the yoke of the Byzantines and that demon Cethegus, than by
  the severest penalty which we could have inflicted. More than eight thousand
  people&mdash;women and children not included&mdash;have perished. Your
  deserted houses fall into ruins; you greedily pluck the grass which grows in
  your temples; despair walks your streets with hollow eyes; famished
  mothers&mdash;Roman mothers&mdash;have devoured the flesh of their own
  children. Until this day, your resistance was heroic, although lamentable.
  But henceforward it is madness. Your last hope was placed in Belisarius. Then
  hear: Belisarius has sailed from Sicily to Byzantium. He has deserted
  you."</p>

  <p>Cethegus ordered the trumpets to be sounded, in order to drown the groans
  of the multitude.</p>

  <p>For some time it was all in vain, but at last the brazen tones
  conquered.</p>

  <p>When all was quiet the Prefect cried:</p>

  <p>"It is a lie! Do not believe such barefaced lies!"</p>

  <p>"Have the Goths, have I, ever lied to you, Romans? But you shall believe
  your own eyes and ears. Come forward, man, and speak. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>A Byzantine in rich armour was led forward by the Gothic horsemen.</p>

  <p>"Konon!"</p>

  <p>"The navarchus of Belisarius!"</p>

  <p>"We know him!" cried the crowd.</p>

  <p>Cethegus turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Men of Rome," said the Byzantine, "Belisarius, the magister militum, has
  sent me to King Totila. I arrived in the camp to-day. Belisarius was obliged
  to return to Byzantium. On leaving Sicily, he recommended Rome and Italy to
  the well-known benevolence of King Totila. This was my message to him and to
  you."</p>

  <p>"If this be so," cried Cethegus, with a threatening voice, "then now is
  the day to prove whether you be Romans or bastards! Mark me well! Cethegus
  the Prefect will never, never surrender his Rome to the barbarians! Oh I
  think once more of the time when I was your all! When you exalted my name
  above those of the saints! Who has given you, for years, work, bread, and,
  what is more, weapons? Who protected you&mdash;Belisarius or
  Cethegus?&mdash;when these barbarians encamped by millions before your walls?
  Who saved Rome, with his heart's blood, from King Witichis? For the last time
  I call you to the combat! Do you hear me, grandchildren of Camillus? As he
  once, solely by the might of the Roman sword, swept the Gauls, who had
  already taken the city, away from the Capitol, so will I sweep away these
  Goths! Follow me! We will sally forth and let the world see what is possible
  to Roman valour when led by Cethegus and despair. Choose!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, choose!" cried Totila, raising himself in his stirrups. "Choose
  between certain destruction or certain freedom. If you once more follow this
  madman, I can no longer protect you. Listen to Earl Teja, who stands at my
  right hand. You know him, I think. I can no longer protect you."</p>

  <p>"No," cried Teja, raising his mighty axe, "then, by the God of Hate, no
  more mercy! If you refuse this last offer, not a life will be spared within
  these walls. I, and a thousand others, have sworn it!"</p>

  <p>"I offer you complete immunity, and will prove a mild and just king to
  you. Ask Neapolis what I am! Choose between me and the Prefect!"</p>

  <p>"Hail to King Totila! Death to the Prefect!" was the unanimous
  acclamation.</p>

  <p>And, as if at a signal, the women and children, with uplifted hands, threw
  themselves on their knees; while all the armed inhabitants raised their
  weapons threateningly, and many a spear was hurled at the Prefect. They were
  the very weapons which he himself had given to the people.</p>

  <p>"They are dogs&mdash;no Romans!" exclaimed Cethegus, with disdainful fury,
  and turned his horse. "To the Capitol!"</p>

  <p>And his horse, with a sudden leap, cleared the row of kneeling and
  screaming women. Through a shower of darts which the Romans now sent after
  him galloped the Prefect, riding down the few who had courage enough to try
  to stop him.</p>

  <p>His crimson crest soon disappeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>His companions galloped swiftly after him. The lance-bearers on foot
  retreated in good order, now and then turning and levelling their spears.
  Thus they reached the lofty bulwark which, held by Marcus Licinius, protected
  the ascent to the Capitol, and the way to the Prefect's house.</p>

  <p>"What next? Shall we pursue?" the citizens asked the King.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;stay. Let all the gates be opened. Wagons laden with meat,
  bread, and wine stand ready in the camp. Let them be brought into all parts
  of the city. Feed the people of Rome for three whole days. My Goths shall
  keep watch to prevent excess."</p>

  <p>"And the Prefect?" asked Duke Guntharis.</p>

  <p>"Cornelius Cethegus, the ex-Prefect of Rome, will not escape the vengeance
  of God," cried Totila, turning away.</p>

  <p>"And not mine!" cried the shepherd-boy.</p>

  <p>"And not mine!" said Teja, and galloped after the King.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-10"
     name="b5a-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">Most of the quarters of the city of Rome had now fallen into
  the hands of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Cethegus was in possession of that part of the city which extended on the
  right bank of the Tiber from the Mausoleum of Hadrian in the north to the
  Porta Portuensis in the south, near which were situated the two bolts across
  the river.</p>

  <p>On the left bank the Prefect held only the small but dominating quarter
  west of the Forum Romanum, of which the Capitol formed the centre. This
  quarter was enclosed by walls and high bulwarks which stretched from the
  shore of the Tiber at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, and round the hill
  eastwards, to the Forum of Trajan in the north; while at the back and
  westwards from the Capitol, they passed between the Circus Flaminius and the
  Theatre of Marcellus (abandoning the first and enclosing the last), and ended
  at the Fabrician Bridge and the Island of the Tiber.</p>

  <p>The King had left the Forum, and the rest of the day was spent by the
  inhabitants of the city in feasting and rejoicing.</p>

  <p>The King caused eighty wagons, each drawn by four oxen, to be drawn up in
  all the principal squares and places of those parts of the city which had
  surrendered. And round about these wagons, upon the pavement or upon
  speedily-erected wooden benches, lay the famishing population, raising their
  voices in thanks to God, the saints, and the "good King."</p>

  <p>The Prefect had at once closed all the gates which led from those parts of
  the city occupied by the Goths into <i>his</i> Rome; particularly the
  approaches from the Forum Romanum to the Capitol, and the Flumentanian,
  Carmentalian and Ratumenian Gates. He caused them all to be barricaded, and
  divided the few soldiers he had at his command among the most important
  points of defence.</p>

  <p>He held much about the same part of Rome as he had before occupied under
  and against Belisarius.</p>

  <p>"Salvius Julianus must have another hundred Isaurians to protect the bolt
  of masts on the river," he commanded. "The Abasgian bowmen must hasten to
  join Piso at the bolt of chains. Marcus Licinius will remain on the bulwark
  of the Forum."</p>

  <p>But now Lucius Licinius announced that the rest of the legionaries, who
  had not been present at the scene on the Forum, because they had been on duty
  in the now barricaded portion of the city, were become very unruly.</p>

  <p>"Ah," cried Cethegus, "the odour of the roast meat for which their
  comrades sold their honour, tickles their nostrils! I come."</p>

  <p>And he rode up to the Capitol, where the legionaries, about five hundred
  men, were standing in their ranks with a very gloomy and threatening
  aspect.</p>

  <p>Looking at them with a searching eye, Cethegus slowly rode along their
  front.</p>

  <p>At last he spoke.</p>

  <p>"For you I had reserved the fame of having defended the Lares and Penates
  of the Capitol against the barbarians. I hear, indeed, that you prefer the
  joints of beef below there. But I will not believe it. You will not desert
  the man who, after centuries of helplessness, has again taught the Romans how
  to fight and conquer. Whoever will stand by Cethegus and the
  Capitol&mdash;let him raise his sword."</p>

  <p>But not a blade was seen.</p>

  <p>"Hunger is a more powerful god than the Capitoline Jupiter," said Cethegus
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>A centurion stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"It is not that, Prefect of Rome. But we will not fight against our
  fathers and brothers who are on the side of the Goths."</p>

  <p>"I ought to keep you as hostages for your fathers and brothers, and when
  they storm the bulwarks, throw to them your heads! But I fear it would not
  stop them in their enthusiasm, which comes from their stomachs! Go&mdash;you
  are not worthy to save Rome! Open the gate, Licinius. Let them turn their
  backs upon the Capitol and honour!"</p>

  <p>And the legionaries marched away, all but about a hundred men, who stood
  still irresolutely, leaning on their spears.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want?" cried Cethegus, riding up to them.</p>

  <p>"To die with you, Prefect of Rome!" cried one of them.</p>

  <p>And the others repeated: "To die with you!"</p>

  <p>"I thank you! Do you see, Licinius, a hundred Romans! Are they not enough
  to found a new Roman Empire?&mdash;I will give you the post of honour; you
  shall defend the bulwark to which I have given the name of Julius Cæsar."</p>

  <p>He sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Syphax, called his tribunes
  together, and spoke:</p>

  <p>"Now listen to my plan."</p>

  <p>"You have a plan already?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We will attack! If I know these barbarians, we are safe for to-night
  from any assault. They have won three quarters of the city. Before they think
  of the last quarter, their victory must be celebrated in a hundred thousand
  tipsy bouts. At midnight the whole company of yellow-haired heroes and
  drinkers will be immersed in feasting, wine, and sleep; and the hungry
  Quirites will not be behindhand in excess. Look! How they feast and sing
  below there&mdash;crowned with flowers! And very few barbarians have yet
  entered the city. That is our hope of victory. At midnight we will sally
  forth from all our gates&mdash;they will not dream of an attack from such a
  minority&mdash;and slay them in their revels."</p>

  <p>"Your plan is bold," said Lucius Licinius. "And if we fall, the Capitol
  will be our tombstone!"</p>

  <p>"You learn from me words as well as sword-strokes," said Cethegus,
  smiling. "My plan is desperate, but it is the only one now possible. Is the
  watch set? I will go home and sleep for a couple of hours. No one must rouse
  me before that time. In two hours come and wake me."</p>

  <p>"You can sleep at such a moment, general?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I <i>must</i>. And I hope I shall sleep soundly. I must have time to
  collect myself&mdash;I have just yielded the Forum Romanum to the barbarian
  King! It was too much! I need time to recover myself. Syphax, I asked
  yesterday if no more wine was to be had on the right bank of the Tiber?"</p>

  <p>"I have been to seek some. There is yet a little in the temple of your
  God; but the priests say that it is dedicated to the service of the
  altar."</p>

  <p>"That will not have spoiled it! Go, Lucius, and take it from the priests.
  Divide it amongst the hundred men on the bulwark of Cæsar. It is the only
  thing that I can give them to show my gratitude."</p>

  <p>Followed by Syphax, Cethegus now rode slowly home.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the principal entrance to his house.</p>

  <p>In answer to the call of Syphax, Thrax, a groom, opened the gate.</p>

  <p>Cethegus dismounted and stroked the neck of his noble charger.</p>

  <p>"Our next ride will be a sharp one, my Pluto&mdash;to victory or in
  flight! Thrax, give him the white bread which was reserved for me."</p>

  <p>The horse was led into the stables near at hand. The stalls were empty.
  Pluto shared the spacious building only with the brown horse belonging to
  Syphax. All the Prefect's other horses had been slaughtered and devoured by
  the mercenaries.</p>

  <p>The master of the house passed through the splendid vestibule and atrium
  into the library.</p>

  <p>The old ostiarius and secretary, the slave Fidus, who was past carrying a
  spear, the only domestic in the house. All the slaves and freedmen were upon
  the walls&mdash;either living or dead.</p>

  <p>"Reach me the roll of Plutarch's Cæsar, and the large goblet set with
  amethysts&mdash;it scarcely needed their decoration&mdash;full of spring
  water."</p>

  <p>The Prefect stayed in the library for some time. The old servant had
  lighted the lamp, filled with costly oil of spikenard, as he had been
  accustomed to do in times of peace.</p>

  <p>Cethegus cast a long look at the numerous busts, Hermes, and statues,
  which cast sharp shadows along the exquisite mosaic pavement.</p>

  <p>There, upon pedestals or brackets, on which were inscribed their names,
  stood small marble busts of almost all the heroes of Rome, from the mythic
  Kings to the long rows of Consuls and Cæsars, ended by Trajan, Hadrian, and
  Constantine.</p>

  <p>The ancestors of the "Cethegi" formed a numerous group.</p>

  <p>An empty niche already contained the pedestal upon which his bust would
  one day stand&mdash;the last on that side of the room, for he was the last of
  his house.</p>

  <p>But on another side there was a whole row of arches and empty niches,
  destined for future scions of the family, not by marriage, but by adoption,
  should the name of Cethegus be continued into more fortunate generations.</p>

  <p>As Cethegus walked slowly past the rows of busts, he chanced to look at
  the niche destined to contain his own, and, to his astonishment, saw that it
  was not empty.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" he asked. "Lift up the lamp, secretary. Whose is that bust
  standing in my place?"</p>

  <p>"Forgive, master! The pedestal of that bust, one of the ancients, needed
  reparation. I was obliged to remove it, and I placed it in the empty niche to
  keep it from harm."</p>

  <p>"Show a light. Still higher. Who can it be?"</p>

  <p>And Cethegus read the short inscription upon the bust: "Tarquinius
  Superbus, tyrant of Rome, died in exile; banished from the city by the
  inhabitants on account of his monstrous despotism. A warning to future
  generations."</p>

  <p>Cethegus, in his youth, had himself composed this inscription.</p>

  <p>He took the bust away, and placed it on one side.</p>

  <p>"Away with the omen!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Lost in thought, he entered his study.</p>

  <p>He leaned his helm, shield, and sword against the couch. The slave kindled
  the lamp which stood on the tortoise-shell table, brought the goblet and the
  roll of papyrus, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Cethegus took up the roll.</p>

  <p>But he soon laid it down again. His forced composure could not last; it
  was too unnatural. In the Roman Forum the Quirites drank with the barbarians
  to the health of the King of the Goths and the ruin of the Prefect of Rome,
  the Princeps Senatus! In two hours he was about to attempt to wrest the city
  from the Goths. He could not fill up the short pause with the perusal of a
  biography which he almost knew by heart.</p>

  <p>He drank thirstily of the water in the goblet.</p>

  <p>Then he threw himself upon his couch.</p>

  <p>"Was it an omen?" he asked himself. "But there are no omens for those who
  do not believe in them. 'This is the only omen: to fight for the fatherland,'
  says Homer. Truly, I fight not alone for my native land; I fight still more
  for myself. But have not to-day's events disgracefully proved that Rome is
  Cethegus, and Cethegus is Rome? These name-forgetting Romans do not make
  Rome. The Rome of to-day is far more Cethegus than the Rome of old was Cæsar.
  Was not he, too, a tyrant in the eyes of fools?"</p>

  <p>He rose uneasily, and went up to the colossal statue of his great
  ancestor.</p>

  <p>"God-like Julius! If I could pray, I would pray now to thee! Help me!
  Complete the work of thy grandchild. How hard have I striven since the day
  when the idea of the renewal of thy empire was born within my
  brain&mdash;born full-armed, like Pallas Athene from the head of Jupiter! How
  have I fought, mentally and physically, by day and by night! And though
  thrown to the ground seven times by the superior force of two peoples, seven
  times have I again struggled to my feet, unconquered and unintimidated! A
  year ago my goal seemed near&mdash;so near; and now, this very night, I must
  fight this fair youth for Rome and for my life! Can it be that I must succumb
  after such deeds and such exertions? Succumb to the good fortune of a youth!
  Is it, then, impossible for thy descendant to stand alone for his nation,
  until he renew both it and himself? Is it impossible to conquer the
  barbarians and the Greeks? Can not I, Cethegus, stop the wheel of Fate and
  roll it backward? Must I fail because I stand alone&mdash;a general without
  an army, a king without a nation to support him? Must I yield thy and my
  Rome? I cannot, will not think so! Did not thy star fade shortly before
  Pharsalus? and didst thou not swim over the Nile to save thy life, bleeding
  from a hundred wounds? And yet thou hast succeeded. Again thou hast entered
  Rome in triumph. It will not go more hardly with thy descendant. No; I will
  not lose my Rome! I will not lose my house, and this thy God-like image,
  which has often, like the crucifix of the Christian, filled me with hope and
  comfort. As a pledge of my success, to thee I will entrust a treasure. Where
  can anything on earth be safe if not with thee? In an hour of despondency, I
  was about to give this treasure to Syphax to bury in the earth. But if I lose
  Rome and this house, this sanctuary, I will lose all. Who can decipher these
  hieroglyphics? As thou hast kept the letters and the diary, so shalt thou
  keep this treasure also."</p>

  <p>So saying, he drew from the bosom of his tunic, beneath his shirt of mail,
  a rather large leather bag, filled with costly pearls and precious stones,
  and touched a spring on the left side of the statue, below the edge of its
  shield.</p>

  <p>A small opening was revealed, out of which he took an oblong casket of
  beautifully-carved ivory, provided with a golden lock. The casket contained
  all sorts of writings and rolls of papyrus. He now added the bag.</p>

  <p>"Here, great ancestor, guard my secrets and my treasure. With whom should
  they be safe, if not with thee?"</p>

  <p>He touched the spring again, and the statue looked as perfect as
  before.</p>

  <p>"Beneath thy shield, upon thy heart! As a pledge that I trust in thee and
  my good fortune as thy descendant! As a pledge that nothing shall force me
  away from thee and Rome&mdash;at least for any length of time. If I
  <i>must</i> go&mdash;I will return again. And who will seek my secret in the
  marble Cæsar?"</p>

  <p>If the water in the amethyst cup had been the strongest wine, it could not
  have had a more intoxicating effect than this soliloquy or dialogue with the
  colossal statue which Cethegus worshipped like a god.</p>

  <p>The unnatural strain upon all his mental and physical powers during the
  last few weeks; the unsuccessful attempt to persuade the people on the Forum;
  the conception of a new and desperate plan as soon as he had been defeated in
  the first, and the consuming anxiety with which he awaited its execution, had
  excited and exhausted the iron nerves of the Prefect to the utmost.</p>

  <p>He thought, spoke, and acted as if in a high fever.</p>

  <p>Tired out, he threw himself upon his couch at the foot of the statue; and
  suddenly sleep overcame him.</p>

  <p>But it was not the sound sleep which, until now, he had been able to
  command at will, even after some criminal act or before a dangerous
  enterprise: the result of a strong constitution which was superior to all
  excitement.</p>

  <p>For the first time his slumber was uneasy, disturbed by changeful dreams,
  which, like the fancies of a delirious man, chased each other through his
  brain.</p>

  <p>At last the visions of the dreamer took a more concrete form.</p>

  <p>He saw the statue at the feet of which he lay, grow and grow. The majestic
  head rose higher and higher, and passed through the roof of the house. With
  its crown of laurel it at last penetrated the clouds, and towered into the
  starry heavens.</p>

  <p>"Take me with thee!" sighed Cethegus.</p>

  <p>But the demigod replied:</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely see thee from this height. Thou art too small! Thou canst
  not follow me."</p>

  <p>And it seemed to Cethegus that a thunderbolt fell and shattered the roof
  of his house. With a crash the beams fell upon him, burying him under the
  ruins. The statue of Cæsar also broke and fell.</p>

  <p>And crash after crash echoed through the place.</p>

  <p>Cethegus woke, sprang up, and looked around in bewilderment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-11"
     name="b5a-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">The sound continued.</p>

  <p>It was real&mdash;no dream! Blow after blow fell thundering against the
  door of his house.</p>

  <p>Cethegus caught up his helm and sword.</p>

  <p>At that moment Syphax and Lucius rushed into the room.</p>

  <p>"Up, general!"</p>

  <p>"Up, Cethegus!"</p>

  <p>"Two hours cannot yet have passed. Why have you awakened me?"</p>

  <p>"The Goths! They have been beforehand with us! They storm the
  bulwarks!"</p>

  <p>"Damn them! Where do they storm?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus had already reached the door of the room.</p>

  <p>"Where does the King attack?"</p>

  <p>"At the bolts on the river. He has sent fire-ships up the stream. Floats
  with heavy towers on deck, full of resin, pitch, and sulphur. The first bolt
  of masts and all the boats between are in flames! Salvius Julianus is wounded
  and taken prisoner. There! you can see the reflection of the flames in the
  south-east!"</p>

  <p>"The bolt of chains&mdash;does it hold?"</p>

  <p>"It holds still. But if it break&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I, as once before, am the bolt of Rome! Forward!"</p>

  <p>Syphax led up the snorting horses.</p>

  <p>Cethegus swung himself into the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Away! Where is your brother Marcus?"</p>

  <p>"At the bulwark by the Forum."</p>

  <p>As Cethegus and Lucius were galloping off, they were met by a mass of
  mercenaries, Isaurians and Abasgians, who fled from the river.</p>

  <p>"Fly!" they cried. "Save the Prefect!"</p>

  <p>"Where is Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;to save you! Turn back. To the river!"</p>

  <p>He galloped on. The reflection of the burning masts plainly showed the
  way. Arrived at the river bank, Cethegus dismounted. Syphax placed his horse
  out of harm's way in an empty storehouse.</p>

  <p>"Torches!" cried Cethegus. "Into the boats! There lie a dozen ready.
  Bowmen, into the boats! Follow me! Lucius, go into the second boat. Row up to
  the chain. Place yourselves close to it. Whatever comes up the
  river&mdash;shoot! They cannot land below the bolt, the walls are too high
  and descend straight into the water. They <i>must</i> come up here to the
  chain!"</p>

  <p>Already a few boats, filled with Goths, had ventured too near. Some caught
  fire at the burning masts; others were upset in the crush and confusion. One,
  which had approached within half an arrow's length of the chain, drove
  helplessly down the stream again: all the crew had been killed by the arrows
  of the Abasgians.</p>

  <p>"Do you see! There goes a boat of corpses! Resist to the last man. Nothing
  is lost! Bring torches and firebrands! Kindle the wharf there! Fire against
  fire!"</p>

  <p>"Look there, master!" cried Syphax, who never left the Prefect's side.</p>

  <p>"Aye, now comes the struggle!"</p>

  <p>It was a splendid sight.</p>

  <p>The Goths had seen that the bolt of chains could never be forced by small
  boats, so they had hewn away so much of the burning bolt of masts that a
  space was left in the middle just broad enough to permit the passage of a
  ship of war.</p>

  <p>But to try to pass up the river, exposed to the arrows of the Abasgians,
  between the flaming ends of the masts, and propelled only by their oars,
  might be more dangerous for the large vessel than for the "boat of
  corpses."</p>

  <p>The Goths hesitated and stopped just before the burning beams.</p>

  <p>But suddenly there arose a strong breeze from the south, rippling the
  surface of the water.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel the wind? It is the breath of the God of Victory! Set the
  sails! Now follow me, my Goths!" cried a joyful voice.</p>

  <p>The sails were set, and the wings of the royal galley, the "Wild Swan,"
  spread wide to the breeze.</p>

  <p>It was a magnificent spectacle as the great vessel, all its canvas spread,
  and urged by a hundred oarsmen, came majestically up the river, illuminated
  by the terrible light from the burning masts and boats.</p>

  <p>With irresistible force the noble galley sailed up the stream.</p>

  <p>On both sides of the upper deck, high above the heads of the oarsmen on
  the lower deck, kneeled close rows of Gothic warriors, their shields forming
  a brazen roof to protect them from the arrows of the foe.</p>

  <p>Upon the bows of the ship an immense figure of a swan lifted high its
  snowy wings.</p>

  <p>Between these wings, upon the back of the swan, stood King Totila, his
  sword in his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" he cried. "Pull, my men, with all your might! Be ready,
  Goths!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus recognised the youth's tall figure. He even recognised the
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Let the galley approach quite close. When within twenty feet, shoot! Not
  yet!&mdash;Now! now shoot!"</p>

  <p>"Crouch close, Goths!" cried Totila.</p>

  <p>A hail of arrows fell over the galley. But they rebounded from a roof of
  shields.</p>

  <p>"Damn them!" cried Piso, behind the Prefect. "They intend to break the
  chain with the force of the shock. And they will surely do it, even if every
  man on deck should fall! The oarsmen we cannot reach, and the south wind
  cannot be wounded!"</p>

  <p>"Fire the sails! fire the ship! Bring firebrands!" cried Cethegus.</p>

  <p>Ever nearer rustled the threatening "Swan."</p>

  <p>Ever nearer approached the ruinous shock against the tightly-stretched
  chains.</p>

  <p>Firebrands were hurled at the galley.</p>

  <p>One flew into the sail of the main-mast, burnt quickly up, and then died
  out.</p>

  <p>A second&mdash;Cethegus himself had hurled it&mdash;passed close to the
  golden locks of the King. It fell near him. He had not remarked it; but a
  shepherd-boy, who carried no weapon but a shepherd's staff, ran up and
  trampled it out.</p>

  <p>The other brands rebounded from the shields and fell hissing into the
  river.</p>

  <p>And now the prow of the galley was only eight feet from the chain.</p>

  <p>The Romans trembled in expectation of the shock.</p>

  <p>Cethegus stepped to the bow of his boat, balancing and aiming his heavy
  spear.</p>

  <p>"Mark!" he said; "as soon as the King falls, be quick with more
  firebrands."</p>

  <p>Never had the practised soldier aimed better. Drawing back his spear once
  more, he launched it at the King with all the force lent to his arm by
  hatred.</p>

  <p>His followers waited breathlessly. But the King did not fall. He had
  caught sight of Cethegus while aiming; at the same moment he threw down his
  long and narrow shield and awaited the flying shaft with his left arm drawn
  back.</p>

  <p>Whistling came the spear straight at the spot where the King's bare neck
  showed above his breastplate.</p>

  <p>When within a few inches of his throat, the King caught the shaft with his
  left hand and immediately hurled it back at the Prefect, wounding him on the
  left arm just above his shield.</p>

  <p>Cethegus fell on his knee.</p>

  <p>At the same instant the galley struck the chain. It burst. The Roman boats
  which lay near, including that of Cethegus, were upset; and most of them
  drove masterless down the river.</p>

  <p>"Victory!" shouted Totila. "Yield, mercenaries!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus, bleeding, swam to the left bank of the river. He saw how the
  Gothic galley lowered two boats, into one of which sprang the King.</p>

  <p>He saw how a whole flotilla of large vessels, which had sailed up in the
  wake of the King's galley, now broke through the boats of his bowmen, and
  landed troops on both sides of the river.</p>

  <p>He saw how his Abasgians&mdash;neither armed nor in the mood for a
  hand-to-hand fight&mdash;surrendered themselves by companies to the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>He saw how a rain of arrows from the royal galley fell upon the defenders
  on the left bank.</p>

  <p>He saw how the little boat, in which stood the King, now approached the
  place where he himself stood, dripping with water.</p>

  <p>He had lost his helmet in the river, his shield he had thrown away, in
  order the more speedily to gain the land.</p>

  <p>He was on the point of attacking the King, who had just landed, with his
  sword alone, when a Gothic arrow grazed his neck.</p>

  <p>"Well hit, Haduswinth?" cried a young voice; "better than at the
  Mausoleum!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo, Gunthamund!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus tottered.</p>

  <p>Syphax caught his arm.</p>

  <p>At the same moment a hand was laid on his shoulder. He recognised Marcus
  Licinius.</p>

  <p>"You here! Where are your men?"</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said Marcus. "The hundred Romans fell on the bulwark. Teja, the
  terrible Teja, stormed it. The half of your Isaurians fell on the way to the
  Capitol. The rest still keep the doors, and the half-bulwark in front of your
  house. I can no more. Teja's axe penetrated through my shield and entered my
  ribs. Farewell, O great Cethegus! Save the Capitol. But&mdash;look there!
  Teja is quick!"</p>

  <p>And he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>From the Capitoline Hill flames rose high into the night.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more to be done here," the Prefect said with difficulty,
  for he was losing blood fast and becoming rapidly weak. "I will save the
  Capitol! To you, Piso, I leave the barbarian King. Once before you have
  wounded a Gothic King upon the threshold of Rome. Now wound a second, but
  this time mortally! You, Lucius, will revenge your brother. Do not follow
  me!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he cast one more furious glance at the King, at whose feet
  kneeled his Abasgians, and sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"You tremble, master!" said Syphax sadly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Rome</i> trembles!" cried Cethegus. "To the Capitol!"</p>

  <p>Lucius Licinius pressed the hand of his dying brother.</p>

  <p>"I shall follow him notwithstanding," he said, "for he is wounded."</p>

  <p>While Cethegus, Syphax, and Lucius Licinius disappeared in the distance,
  Piso crouched behind the columns of a Basilica close to which the street led
  upwards from the river.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the King had placed the Abasgians under the guard of his
  soldiers. He went a few steps up the bank of the river and pointed with his
  sword to the flames which arose from the Capitol.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the Goths who were landing.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" he cried. "Make haste! The flames up there must be
  extinguished. The fight is over. Now, Goths, protect and preserve Rome, for
  it is yours!"</p>

  <p>Piso took advantage of the moment.</p>

  <p>"Apollo!" he exclaimed; "if ever my satires hit their mark, help now my
  sword!"</p>

  <p>And he sprang from behind the column towards the King, who stood with his
  back turned to him. But before he could deal a blow, he let his sword fell
  with a loud cry. A sturdy stroke from a stick had lamed his hand.</p>

  <p>Immediately a young shepherd sprang upon him and pulled him to the ground,
  kneeling on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Yield, thou Roman wolf!" cried a clear boyish voice.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Piso.... the poet He is thy prisoner, boy," said the King, who now
  turned. "He shall ransom himself with a goodly sum. But who art thou, young
  shepherd?"</p>

  <p>"He is the saviour of your life, sire," interposed old Haduswinth. "We saw
  the Roman rush at you, but we were too far off to call or help you. We owe
  your life to this boy."</p>

  <p>"What is thy name, young hero?"</p>

  <p>"Adalgoth."</p>

  <p>"And what wouldst thou here?"</p>

  <p>"Cethegus, the traitor, the Prefect of Rome! where is he, King? Pray tell
  me. I was sent to the boats. I heard that he would oppose thy attack
  here."</p>

  <p>"He was here. He has fled; most likely to his house."</p>

  <p>"Wouldst thou overcome that King of Hell with this stick?" asked
  Haduswinth.</p>

  <p>"No," cried the boy; "I have now a sword."</p>

  <p>And he took up his prisoner's sword, which was lying on the ground;
  brandished it over his head and rushed away.</p>

  <p>Totila gave Piso in charge to the Goths, who had now landed in great
  numbers.</p>

  <p>"Hasten!" he cried again. "Save the Capitol, which the Romans are
  destroying!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5a-12"
     name="b5a-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile the Prefect had left the river and gone in the
  direction of the Capitol.</p>

  <p>He passed the Porta Trigemina and arrived at the Forum Boarium.</p>

  <p>Before the Temple of Janus he met with a crowd of people by which he was
  detained for a short time.</p>

  <p>In spite of his wound he had made such haste that Lucius and Syphax could
  scarcely follow. They had repeatedly lost sight of him. Only now did they
  overtake him.</p>

  <p>He now tried to go through the Porta Carmentalis, and thus gain the back
  of the Capitol.</p>

  <p>But he found the gate already occupied by numerous Goths. Amongst them was
  Wachis. He recognised the Prefect from a distance.</p>

  <p>"Revenge for Rauthgundis!" he cried.</p>

  <p>A heavy stone struck the Prefect's helmless head. He turned and fled.</p>

  <p>He now remembered that there was a sinking of the wall not far from the
  gate. He determined to climb it at that place.</p>

  <p>As he neared it, the flames from the Capitol again shot high into the
  air.</p>

  <p>Three men sprang over the wall just in front of him. They were Isaurians.
  They recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Fly, general! The Capitol is lost! Teja, the black Gothic devil!"</p>

  <p>"Did he&mdash;did Teja kindle the fire?"</p>

  <p>"No; we ourselves set a wooden bulwark, which the barbarians had taken, on
  fire. The Goths do all they can to extinguish the flames."</p>

  <p>"The barbarians save the Capitol!" said Cethegus bitterly, and supported
  himself upon a spear which was handed to him by one of the mercenaries.</p>

  <p>"I must get to my house."</p>

  <p>And he turned to the right, the shortest way to the principal entrance to
  his house.</p>

  <p>"O master, that way is dangerous!" cried one of the Isaurians. "The Goths
  will soon be there. I heard the Black Earl ask repeatedly after you. He was
  seeking you everywhere upon the Capitol. He will now seek you in your
  house."</p>

  <p>"I <i>must</i> once more go to my house!"</p>

  <p>But he had scarcely gone a few steps, when a troop of Goths and Romans,
  carrying torches and firebrands, came towards him from the city.</p>

  <p>The foremost, who were Romans, recognised him.</p>

  <p>"The Prefect!"</p>

  <p>"The destroyer of Rome!"</p>

  <p>"He has set the Capitol on fire! Down with him!"</p>

  <p>Arrows, stones, and spears were hurled at Cethegus. One of his Isaurians
  fell; the others took to their heels.</p>

  <p>Cethegus was hit by an arrow; it penetrated slightly into his left
  shoulder. He tore it out.</p>

  <p>"A Roman arrow, with my own stamp!" he cried with a terrible laugh.</p>

  <p>With difficulty he gained a dark side-street.</p>

  <p>Before his House there was a crowd of soldiers, trying in vain to break
  open the principal door.</p>

  <p>Cethegus heard the uproar, and well understood the cries of rage with
  which the soldiers accompanied their ineffectual exertions.</p>

  <p>"The door is strong," he said to himself. "Before they force an entrance,
  I shall be again out of the house."</p>

  <p>He hurried to the back of the house. He pressed a secret spring which
  opened the door of the court, entered, and, leaving the door open behind him,
  hurried in.</p>

  <p>Hark! a stroke&mdash;very different from all which had gone
  before&mdash;thundered against the front door of the house.</p>

  <p>"That is a battle-axe!" thought Cethegus. "That is Teja?"</p>

  <p>He hastened to a small gap in the wall, which afforded an outlook into the
  main street. It was Teja. His long black locks waved about his bare head; in
  his left hand he carried a firebrand; in his right the dreaded battle-axe. He
  was covered with blood.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus!" he shouted at every stroke of his axe. "Cornelius Cethegus
  Cæsarius, where art thou? I sought thee in the Capitol, Prefect of Rome!
  Where art thou? Must I seek thee upon thy hearth?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus, listening, heard hasty steps behind him.</p>

  <p>Syphax had reached the court, and had followed his master through the open
  door. He now caught sight of him.</p>

  <p>"O master, fly! I will protect thy threshold with my body."</p>

  <p>And he hastened past Cethegus, through a suite of apartments to the front
  door.</p>

  <p>Cethegus turned to the right. He could hardly keep himself upright. He
  managed to reach the "Hall of Jupiter." Here he sank to the ground. But the
  next moment he again sprang to his feet, for a fearful noise was heard from
  the front door.</p>

  <p>At last it was broken in.</p>

  <p>With a thundering crash it fell inwards, and Teja entered the dwelling of
  his enemy.</p>

  <p>Upon the threshold, with a leap like that of a panther, the Moor sprang
  upon him, grasping his throat and raising a dagger in his hand.</p>

  <p>But the Goth let fall his axe, seized him in his right hand, and, like a
  stone from a sling, the Moor flew sideways through the door and rolled down
  the steps into the street.</p>

  <p>"Where art thou, Cethegus?" again sounded the voice of Teja, coming nearer
  and nearer, from the vestibule and the atrium.</p>

  <p>Some doors, which had been bolted by the secretary, Fidus, were forced one
  after the other by Teja's axe.</p>

  <p>With difficulty Cethegus dragged himself to the middle of the Hall of
  Jupiter. He still hoped to be able to reach the study and take the writings
  and treasure out of the statue of Cæsar.</p>

  <p>He heard the crash of another falling door, and the voice of Teja now
  sounded from the study.</p>

  <p>He heard how the soldiers, who had pressed forward after Teja into the
  library, were demolishing the statues and busts of his ancestors.</p>

  <p>"Where is thy master, old man?" asked Teja's voice.</p>

  <p>The slave had taken refuge in the study.</p>

  <p>"I know not, by my soul!"</p>

  <p>"Not even here! Cethegus! coward! Where hidest thou?"</p>

  <p>It was now evident that the soldiers had also entered the study.</p>

  <p>Cethegus could no longer stand upright.</p>

  <p>He leaned against the marble statue of Jupiter, from which the hall took
  its name.</p>

  <p>"What shall be done with this house?" he heard some one ask.</p>

  <p>"It shall be burned!" cried Teja.</p>

  <p>"The King has forbidden that," answered the voice of Thorismuth.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but I have begged this house from the King. It shall be razed to the
  ground! Down with the temple of that devil! Down with the holiest of
  holies&mdash;this idol!"</p>

  <p>A fearful blow resounded.</p>

  <p>With a crash the Cæsar statue fell in fragments to the ground.</p>

  <p>Gold, jewels, and rolls of papyrus covered the floor.</p>

  <p>"Ah! the barbarian!" cried Cethegus, forgetting himself, and he was about
  to rush into the study with his drawn sword, when he fell senseless at the
  foot of the statue of Jupiter.</p>

  <p>"Hark! What was that?" cried a boyish voice.</p>

  <p>"The voice of the Prefect!" exclaimed Teja, and opening the door which led
  from the study into the hall, he sprang forward, swinging his battle-axe.</p>

  <p>But the hall was empty.</p>

  <p>A pool of blood lay at the feet of the Jupiter, and a broad track of the
  crimson fluid led to the window which opened into the inner court.</p>

  <p>The court was empty.</p>

  <p>But some Goths who entered it found the little door closed from outside;
  the key was still in the lock on the side of the street.</p>

  <p>When they had forced this door&mdash;some of them had also gone round from
  the front of the house&mdash;and had searched the side-street and the
  dwellings in it, they only found the Prefect's sword, which was recognised by
  Fidus, the secretary.</p>

  <p>With a gloomy look Teja took it up, and returned into the study.</p>

  <p>"Take up carefully all that was concealed in the Prefect's idol,
  particularly the writings, and carry everything to the King. Where is the
  King?"</p>

  <p>"When he left the Capitol, he, with all the Romans and Goths, went into
  the sanctuary of St. Peter, to attend a service of thanksgiving."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well. Go to him in the church and give him everything. Also the
  sword of the fugitive. Tell him that Teja sends it."</p>

  <p>"Thy order shall be obeyed," said Thorismuth. "But thou&mdash;wilt thou
  not go with us to the church?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where wilt thou spend this night of victory, when all the others are
  giving thanks?"</p>

  <p>"I will spend it in the ruins of this house!"</p>

  <p>And he thrust the firebrand into the purple cushions of the Prefect's
  couch.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="b5b-1"
     name="b5b-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">Thenceforth King Totila held his court in Rome with much
  splendour and rejoicing.</p>

  <p>The heaviest task of all the war seemed to be completed.</p>

  <p>After the fall of Rome, most of the small forts on the coast and in the
  Apennines opened their gates; very few remained to be taken by siege.</p>

  <p>For this purpose the King sent forth his generals, Teja, Guntharis,
  Grippa, Markja, and Aligern; while he himself undertook the difficult
  political task of reducing to order the kingdom so long disturbed by war or
  rebellion. He had, indeed, almost to refound it.</p>

  <p>He sent his dukes and earls into the towns and districts to carry out his
  intentions in all departments of the state; particularly to protect the
  Italians from the vengeance of the victorious Goths. He had published from
  the Capitol a general amnesty; excluding only one person: the ex-Prefect,
  Cornelius Cethegus Cæsarius.</p>

  <p>Everywhere he caused the destroyed churches, both Catholic and Arian, to
  be restored; everywhere the landed property was settled, the taxes newly-laid
  and diminished.</p>

  <p>The beneficial results of all this care were not long in making themselves
  felt.</p>

  <p>Even when Totila had first assumed the crown and issued his manifesto, had
  the Italians resumed the long-neglected cultivation of the land. The Gothic
  soldiers were directed to refrain from disturbing this important work, and to
  do all in their power to prevent any such disturbance on the part of the
  Byzantines.</p>

  <p>And a wonderful fertility of the soil, a harvest of grain, wine, and oil,
  such as had not been seen for ages, seemed to prove that the blessing of
  Heaven had fallen upon the young King.</p>

  <p>The news of the taking of Neapolis and Rome spread rapidly through the
  Eastern Empire, where it was received with great astonishment, for all there
  had long since considered the Gothic kingdom to be extinct.</p>

  <p>Merchants who had been tempted by the strong and just government, the
  security of the high-roads and of the sea&mdash;which were severally
  protected by patrols of soldiers and watchful squadrons of Gothic
  ships&mdash;to revisit the deserted towns and harbours of the peninsula,
  praised the justice and benevolence of the royal youth, and told of the
  flourishing state of his kingdom, and of the brilliancy of his court at Rome,
  where he gathered about him the senators who had repented of their rebellion,
  and gave to the populace liberal alms and splendid games in the Circus.</p>

  <p>The Kings of the Franks acknowledged this change of circumstances. They
  sent presents&mdash;Totila rejected them; they sent ambassadors&mdash;Totila
  would not receive them.</p>

  <p>The King of the Ostrogoths frankly offered an alliance against Byzantium
  and the hand of his daughter. The Avarian and Slavonian marauders on the
  eastern frontier were punished. With the exception of the few fortresses
  which were still in a state of siege&mdash;Ravenna, Perusium, and a few small
  castles&mdash;the whole country enjoyed as perfect peace as in Theodoric's
  most glorious days.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the King was wise enough to be moderate. He
  acknowledged, in spite of his victories, the danger-fraught superiority of
  the East, and earnestly sought to make peace with the Emperor.</p>

  <p>He resolved to send an embassy to Byzantium, to offer peace on the basis
  of a full acknowledgment of the Gothic rule in Italy. He would renounce all
  claim to Sicily&mdash;where not a Goth was now dwelling (the Gothic
  settlements on that island had never been very numerous); he would also
  resign those parts of Dalmatia now occupied by the Byzantines. On his side
  the Emperor should immediately evacuate Ravenna, which no perseverance or
  stratagem on the part of the Gothic besiegers had been able to reduce.</p>

  <p>As the person most qualified to undertake this mission of peace and
  reconciliation, the King thought of a man who was distinguished by worth and
  dignity, by his love for Italy and the Goths, and who was renowned, even in
  the East, for his wisdom&mdash;the venerable Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>Although the pious old man had withdrawn from all affairs of state for
  many years, the young King succeeded in persuading him to leave the peaceful
  quiet of his lonely cloister, and brave the troubles and dangers of a journey
  to Byzantium in order to perform this noble and pious work.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible to lay upon the old man the whole burden of such an
  embassy, and the King now sought for a younger and stronger man to accompany
  him. A man of similar benevolent and Christian feeling&mdash;a second apostle
  of peace.</p>

  <p>A few weeks after the conquest of Rome, a royal messenger carried the
  following letter over the Cottian Alps into Provence:</p>

  <p>"To Julius Manilius Montanus, Totila, who is called the King of the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>"Come, my beloved friend, return to my heart! Years have passed; much
  blood has been shed, and many tears have fallen. More than once, terribly or
  fortunately, has everything changed around me since I pressed your hand for
  the last time. Everything around me has changed, but I remain the same. All
  is as it was between you and me. I still revere the idols at whose shrines we
  worshipped together in the first dreams of our youth, but growing experience
  has ennobled these idols. When sin, treachery, and all dark powers raged upon
  Italian soil, you abandoned it. See, they have disappeared, like moisture in
  the sun and wind. The conquered demons growl in the distance, and a rainbow
  stretches its brilliant arch over this my beloved kingdom. When nobler souls
  unhappily succumbed. Heaven preserved me to see the end of the fearful storm
  and to sow the seeds of a new time. Come now, my Julius; help me to carry out
  those dreams at which you so often smiled, thinking them <i>mere</i> dreams.
  Help me to create a new people of Goths and Italians, which will unite the
  advantages and exclude the weaknesses of both nations. Help me to found a
  realm of justice and of peace, of freedom and of beauty, ennobled by Italian
  grace, and strengthened by Gothic endurance. You, my Julius, have built a
  cloister for the Church&mdash;help me to build a temple for humanity. I am
  lonely, friend, at the summit of fortune. Lonely my bride awaits the full
  completion of my vow. The war has robbed me of my devoted brother. Will you
  not come, my Dioscuros? In two months I shall expect you at Taginæ with
  Valeria."</p>

  <p>Julius read; and with emotion said to himself: "My friend, I come!"</p>

  <p>Before King Totila left Rome for Taginæ, he resolved to pay an old debt of
  gratitude, and to give a worthy, that is a beautiful, form to an old
  connection that, until now, had not satisfied the desire for harmony which
  possessed his soul&mdash;his connection with the first hero of his nation,
  with Teja.</p>

  <p>They had been friends from their earliest boyhood. Although Teja was
  several years older, he had always perceived and honoured the depth of the
  younger man's nature under the brilliant husk of his joyous temperament. And
  a common inclination to enthusiasm and idealism, besides a certain pride and
  magnanimity, had drawn them early together. Later, however, their opposite
  fates had caused their originally very different natures to deviate more and
  more.</p>

  <p>The sunny brightness of the one seemed to contrast with the austerity of
  the other with painful brilliancy. And Totila, after repeated and impetuous
  attempts to dispel the gloom of his silent friend&mdash;the cause of which he
  did not know, and the nature of which he did not understand&mdash;had at
  last, attributing it to a morbid mind, withdrawn to a distance.</p>

  <p>The milder, though grave and softer influence of Julius, and his passion
  for Valeria, gradually estranged Totila from the friend of his boyhood.</p>

  <p>But the experience of late years, the sufferings and dangers he had
  endured since the death of Valerius and Miriam, the burning of Neapolis, the
  distress of Rome, the crimes committed at Ravenna and Castra Nova, and lately
  the cares and duties of royalty, had so completely matured the impatient and
  joyous youth, that he was now able to do full justice to his gloomy
  friend.</p>

  <p>And what had not this friend accomplished since the night when they had
  sworn brotherhood!</p>

  <p>When the others had become paralysed by suffering; when Hildebrand's
  impatience, Totila's enthusiasm, and the quiet steadfastness of Witichis,
  even old Hildebrand's icy fortitude, had wavered&mdash;Teja had never sighed,
  but always acted; never hoped, but always dared!</p>

  <p>At Regeta, before Rome, after the fall of Ravenna, and again before
  Rome&mdash;what had he not accomplished! What did not the kingdom owe to his
  efforts! And he would receive no thanks.</p>

  <p>When Witichis had offered him the dignity of a duke, gold, and land, he
  had rejected the offer as an offence.</p>

  <p>Lonely, silent, and melancholy, he walked through the streets of Rome, the
  last shadow in the light of Totila's presence. He stood next to the King's
  throne, with his black eyes ever lowered to the ground. He stole away without
  a word from the royal table. He never laid aside his armour or weapons.</p>

  <p>Only when in action did he sometimes laugh; when, with contempt of death,
  or the temerity which courts it, he sprang amid the spears of the
  Byzantines&mdash;then only did he seem to feel at ease, then all his being
  was life, movement, and fire.</p>

  <p>It was known to all the nation&mdash;and Totila specially had known it
  from his boyhood&mdash;that this melancholy hero possessed the gift of
  song.</p>

  <p>But since his return from captivity in Greece, no one had ever been able
  to persuade him to sing one of his glowing and inspiring songs; and yet every
  one knew that his little triangular harp was his constant companion in war or
  peace, inseparable as his sword. At the moment of attack he was sometimes
  heard to sing wild snatches of song to the measure of the Gothic horns. And
  whoever followed him into the wilderness of white marble and green bushes,
  among the old Roman ruins, where he was fond of passing his nights, might
  sometimes hear him play some long-forgotten melody, accompanying it with
  dreamy words. But if any one&mdash;which was seldom the case&mdash;ventured
  to ask what he wanted, he turned silently away.</p>

  <p>Once, after the taking of Rome, he replied to a similar question put by
  Guntharis, by the words, "The head of the Prefect!"</p>

  <p>The only person whose company he affected was Adalgoth, to whom he had
  lately attached himself.</p>

  <p>The young shepherd had been raised to the office of herald and cup-bearer
  to the King, as a reward for his bold act at the storming of the Tiber
  shore.</p>

  <p>He had brought with him, though little schooled, a decided gift for song.
  Teja was pleased with his genius; and it was reported that he secretly taught
  him his superior art, though they suited each other as little as night and
  morning.</p>

  <p>"It is just on that account," said Teja, when his brave cousin Aligern
  once remarked this to him, "something must be left when the night sinks."</p>

  <p>The King felt that the only thing that could be offered to this man was in
  <i>his</i> power to offer&mdash;neither gold, nor land, nor dignities.</p>

  <p>One night King Totila came to where the two bards were sitting. He
  followed the sounds which, arising at irregular intervals from a grove of
  cypresses, and interrupted by half-sung, half-spoken words, were borne to his
  ear by the night wind. Unnoticed and unbetrayed by the soft moonlight, Totila
  reached the avenue of half-wild laurels and cypresses which led into the
  centre of the garden.</p>

  <p>But now Teja heard the approaching footsteps, and laid aside his harp.</p>

  <p>"It is the King," he said; "I recognise his step. What seekest thou here,
  my King?"</p>

  <p>"I seek thee, Teja," answered Totila.</p>

  <p>Teja sprang from his seat upon a fallen column.</p>

  <p>"Then we must fight!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No," said Totila; "but I deserve this reproach."</p>

  <p>He took Teja's hand, and affectionately drew him down to his former seat,
  placing himself at his side.</p>

  <p>"I did not seek thy sword, Teja; I sought thyself. I need thee; not thine
  arm, but thy heart. No, Adalgoth; do not go. Thou mayst see&mdash;and I wish
  thee to see&mdash;how every one must love this proud man, the 'Black
  Earl.'"</p>

  <p>"I knew it," said Adalgoth, "ever since I first saw him. He is like a dark
  forest, through the branches of whose lofty trees blows a mysterious breach,
  full of terror and charm."</p>

  <p>Teja fixed his large and melancholy eyes upon the King.</p>

  <p>"My friend," began Totila, "the gracious God of Heaven has endowed me
  richly. I have won back a kingdom which was half-lost; shall I not be able to
  win back the half-lost heart of a friend? And it was to this friend's efforts
  that most of my success was owing; he must now help me to regain my friend.
  What has estranged thee from me? Forgive me if I, or my good fortune, has
  offended thee. I know to whom I owe my crown; but I cannot wear it with
  gladness if only thy sword and not thy heart be mine. We were once friends,
  Teja; oh! let us be so again, for I miss thee sorely!"</p>

  <p>And he would have embraced Teja, but the latter caught both his hands and
  pressed them to his heart.</p>

  <p>"This evening's walk honours thee more than thy victorious march through
  Italy! The tear which I see glittering in thine eye is worth more than the
  richest pearl upon thy crown. Forgive thou me; I have been unjust. The gifts
  of fortune and thy careless joy have not corrupted thy heart. I have never
  been angered against thee; I have ever loved thee, and it was with sorrow
  that I saw our paths in life diverge; for, in truth, thou art more congenial
  to me, nearer than thou ever wert to the brave Witichis, or even to thine own
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Adalgoth; "you two complete each other like light and
  shade."</p>

  <p>"Our natures are, indeed, equally emotional and fiery," said the King.</p>

  <p>"If Witichis and Hildebad," continued Teja, "went the straight way with a
  steady pace, we two were borne, by our impatient enthusiasm, as if on wings.
  And being so congenial, though so different, it pains me that, in thy sunny
  bliss, thou seemest to think that any one who cannot laugh like thee is a
  sick fool! Oh, my King and friend! whoever has once experienced certain
  trials and woes, and conceived certain thoughts, has for ever lost the sweet
  art of laughter!"</p>

  <p>Totila, filled with a deep sense of Teja's worth, answered:</p>

  <p>"Whoever has fulfilled life's noblest duties with a heroism equal to
  thine, my Teja, may be pitied, but not blamed, if he proudly scorns life's
  light pleasures."</p>

  <p>"And thou couldst think that I was envious of thy good fortune or thy
  cheerful humour? O Totila! it is not with envy, but with deep, deep sadness
  that I observe thee and thy hopefulness. As a child may excite our sadness
  who believes that sunshine, spring-time, and life endure for ever; who knows
  neither night, winter, nor death! Thou trustest that success and happiness
  will be the reward of the cheerful-hearted; but I for ever hear the flapping
  of the wings of Fate, who, deaf and merciless to curses, prayers, or thanks,
  sweeps high above the heads of poor mortals and their futile works."</p>

  <p>He ceased, and looked out into the darkness, as if he saw the shadow of
  the coming future.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the young cup-bearer, "that reminds me of an old adage
  which Iffa sang in the mountain, and which means something like that; he had
  learnt it from Uncle Wargs:</p>

  <p>"'Good fortune or bad Is not the world's aim; That is but vain folly,
  Imagined by men. On the earth is fulfilled A Will everlasting. Obedience,
  defiance&mdash; They serve it alike.'</p>

  <p>"But," he continued thoughtfully, "if, with all our exertions, we can
  never alter the inevitable, why do we move our hands at all? Why do we not
  wait for what shall come in dull inaction? In what lies the difference
  between hero and coward?"</p>

  <p>"It does not lie in victory, my Adalgoth, but in the kind of strife or
  endurance! Not justice, but necessity decides the fate of nations. Often
  enough has the better man, the nobler race, succumbed to the meaner. 'Tis
  true that generosity and nobility of mind are in themselves a power. But they
  are not always able to defy other and ignoble powers. Noble-mindedness,
  generosity, and heroism can always consecrate and glorify a downfall, but not
  always prevent it. And the only comfort we have is, that it is not
  <i>what</i> we endure, but <i>how</i> we endure it, that honours us the most;
  it is often not the victor, but the conquered hero, who deserves the crown of
  laurels."</p>

  <p>The King looked meditatively at the ground, leaning on his sword.</p>

  <p>"How much thou must have suffered, friend," he then said warmly, "before
  thou couldst embrace such a dark error! Thou hast lost thy God in heaven! For
  me, that would be worse than to lose the sun in the sky&mdash;I should feel
  as if blinded. I could not breathe if I could not believe in a just God, who
  looks down from His heavenly throne upon the deeds of men, and makes the good
  cause to triumph!"</p>

  <p>"And King Witichis?" asked Teja; "what evil had he done? that man without
  spot or blemish! And I myself, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He suddenly became silent.</p>

  <p>"Thy life has been a mystery to me since our early
  youth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough for the present," said Teja. "I have this evening revealed more of
  my inmost heart than in many a long year. The time will surely come when I
  may unfold to thee my life and my thoughts. I should not like," he continued,
  turning to Adalgoth, and stroking his shining locks, "to dim too soon the
  bright harp-strings of the youngest and best singer of our nation."</p>

  <p>"As thou wilt," said the King, rising. "To me thy sorrow is sacred. But, I
  pray thee, let us cherish our refound friendship. To-morrow I go to Taginæ,
  to my bride. Accompany me&mdash;that is, if it does not pain thee to see me
  happy with a Roman woman."</p>

  <p>"Oh no&mdash;it touches me&mdash;it reminds me of&mdash;&mdash; I will go
  with thee!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-2"
     name="b5b-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after this conversation, the King, Earl Teja, Adalgoth,
  and a numerous suite, arrived at the small town of Taginæ, above which, on a
  precipitous and thickly-wooded height, stood the cloister founded by
  Valerius, in which Valeria still continued to reside.</p>

  <p>For her the place had lost all its terrors. She had become used to it, not
  only physically but morally. Slowly but surely, her reluctant soul was
  influenced by the grave authority of the sacred precincts.</p>

  <p>The King met her in the cloister garden, and it seemed to him that her
  complexion was much paler, her step slower, than usual.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, Valeria?" he asked tenderly. "When our vow seemed past
  fulfilment, you were still full of hope and courage. Now, when your lover
  wears the crown of this realm, and the foot of the enemy treads the sacred
  soil of Italia in scarcely more than one city, will you sink and
  despair?"</p>

  <p>"Not despair, friend," said Valeria gravely, "but renounce. No, no! be
  patient and hear me. Why do you hide from me what all Italia knows&mdash;what
  your people wish? The King of the Ostrogoths at Toletum has offered you his
  alliance against Byzantium, and the hand of his daughter. Your people expect
  and wish you to accept both these offers. I will not be more selfish than was
  that high-minded daughter of your nation, Rauthgundis, of whom your minstrels
  already sing. And I know that you are as capable of sacrifice as the
  simple-minded man who was your unfortunate King."</p>

  <p>"I hope that I should be so, if necessary. But happily there is no need of
  sacrifice. I do not want the help of the Ostrogoth. Look around, or rather,
  look beyond these convent walls. Never has the kingdom flourished as it does
  now. Once again I will offer to make peace with the Emperor. If he still
  refuse, a war will break out such as he has never seen. Ravenna will soon
  fell. Truly, my power and my courage are not reduced to the point of
  renunciation! The air of this cloister has at length enervated your steadfast
  mind. You must leave this place. Choose the most lovely of all Italian cities
  for your residence. Let us rebuild your father's house in Neapolis."</p>

  <p>"No. Leave me here. I have learned to love this quiet place."</p>

  <p>"It is the quiet of the grave! And you know well that to renounce you
  would be to renounce the ideal of my life. You are the living symbol of all
  my plans; you are to me Italia herself! You must become mine&mdash;wholly,
  irrevocably mine. Goths and Italians shall take their King and Queen for a
  pattern; they shall become as united and happy as we. No&mdash;no
  objections&mdash;no more doubts! Thus I smother them!" and he passionately
  embraced her.</p>

  <p>A few days later Julius Montanus arrived, coming from Genoa and
  Urbinum.</p>

  <p>The King and his retinue went to meet him outside the cloister gates.</p>

  <p>The two friends embraced each other tenderly; for some time they were
  incapable of speaking.</p>

  <p>Teja stood near and gravely observed them.</p>

  <p>"Sir," whispered Adalgoth, "who is the man with the deep-set eyes? a
  monk?"</p>

  <p>"In his heart he is; but not outwardly."</p>

  <p>"Such a young man with such an old look! Dost thou know whom he resembles?
  That picture in the cloisters on the golden background."</p>

  <p>"It is true; he is like that gentle and sorrowful head of the Apostle
  John."</p>

  <p>"Your letter," Julius said to Totila, "found me already resolved to come
  here."</p>

  <p>"You were about to seek me&mdash;or Valeria?"</p>

  <p>"No, Totila. I came to be examined and accepted by Cassiodorus. Benedict
  of Nursia, who fills our century with the fame of his miracles, has founded
  an order which powerfully attracts me."</p>

  <p>"Julius, you must not do that! What spirit of flying from the world has
  seized upon my companions? Valeria, you, and Teja!"</p>

  <p>"I fly from nothing," said Julius, "not even from the world."</p>

  <p>"How," continued the King, taking his friend by the arm, and leading him
  towards the cloister, "how come you, in the bloom of your manhood, to think
  of this moral suicide? Look, there comes Valeria. She must help me to
  convince you. Ah, if you had ever loved, you would not turn your back upon
  the world."</p>

  <p>Julius smiled, but made no reply. He quietly clasped Valeria's offered
  hand, and followed her into the cloister, where Cassiodorus came to meet
  them.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the King's eloquence, he was able to induce his friend to
  promise that he would accompany the aged Cassiodorus to Byzantium in a few
  days. Julius at first shunned the glitter, the noise, and the wickedness of
  the Emperor's court, until at last Cassiodorus' example and Totila's
  persuasions overcame his scruples.</p>

  <p>"I think," the King said, "that more pious works can be accomplished in
  the world than in the cloister. <i>This</i> embassy is such a pious work; a
  work which is to save two nations from the horrors of renewed warfare."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Julius, "a king and a hero can serve God as well as a
  monk. I do not blame your manner of service&mdash;leave mine to me. It seems
  to me that in the time in which we live, when an ancient world is sinking
  amid much terror, and a new one arises amid wild storms; when all the vices
  of a degenerated heathenism are mixed with the wildness of a barbarous race;
  when luxury, brute force, and the lusts of the flesh fill East and West, I
  think it is well done to found a sanctuary apart from the world, where
  poverty, purity, and humble-mindedness can dwell in peace."</p>

  <p>"But to me," said Totila, "it seems that splendour, the happiness of
  honest love, and cheerful pride, are no sin before the God of Heaven! What
  thinkest thou of our dispute, friend Teja?"</p>

  <p>"It has no meaning for me," answered Teja quietly, "for your God is not my
  God. But let us not speak of that, for here comes Valeria."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-3"
     name="b5b-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">One evening, the same on which Adalgoth had arrived with the
  King at Taginal, Gotho, the shepherdess, stood in the sunset light upon the
  southern declivity of the Iffinger, leaning upon her staff.</p>

  <p>Round her gambolled and grazed her flock of sheep and lambs, and gradually
  gathered close round their mistress, eagerly expecting to be led to the
  sheepfold.</p>

  <p>But they waited and bleated in vain, for the pretty maiden bent over the
  mossy stones on the edge of the clear mountain brook. Heaped up in her
  leather apron lay the lovely scented flowers of the mountain: thyme,
  wild-rose, mint&mdash;which grew on the moist edges of the brook&mdash;and
  the dark blue enzian.</p>

  <p>Gotho murmured and spoke to herself, to the flowers, and to the running
  stream, throwing the flowers into the water, sometimes singly, sometimes in
  little sprays or unfinished wreaths.</p>

  <p>"How many," said the girl, as she tossed her thick yellow braids over her
  shoulder, "how many of you have I sent away to greet him! For he has gone to
  the south, and the water runs there too. But I know not if you give my
  greeting, for he has never yet come home. But you, as you rise and sink in
  the dance of the ripples, you beckon me to follow you. Ah! if I could! or
  follow the little fish which dart down the stream like dark arrows! Or the
  swift mountain swallows that skim through the air as free as thought! Or the
  rosy-winged evening clouds, when the mountain wind drives them southwards!
  But most surely of all would the heart of the seeker herself find him, could
  she but leave the mountain, and follow him to the distant and sunny land. But
  what should I do down there? A shepherdess amongst the warriors or the wise
  court-ladies! And I shall certainly see him again, as surely as I shall again
  see the sun, although it sinks behind yonder mountains. It is sure to come
  again, and yet! all the time between its parting ray and its morning greeting
  is filled with longing!"</p>

  <p>From the house there suddenly sounded a far-reaching tone, a blast upon
  the twisted ram's horn. Gotho looked up; it had become darker; she could see
  the red fire upon the hearth glimmer through the open door. The sheep
  answered the well-known sound with louder bleatings, stretching their necks
  in the direction of the house and the stalls. The brown and shaggy sheep-dog
  sprang upon Gotho, as if to remind her that it was time to go home.</p>

  <p>"I will go directly," she said, smiling, and stroking the dog's head. "Ah!
  the sheep are sooner tired of their pasture than the shepherdess of her
  thoughts! Now, forwards, White Elf, thou art already become a great fat
  sheep!"</p>

  <p>She went down the hill towards the little hollow between two mountain
  summits, where the house and stalls found protection from the wind and the
  avalanches. There the last rays of the sun dazzled her no more. The stars
  were already visible. Gotho looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"They are so beautiful, because <i>he</i> has looked at them so
  often!"</p>

  <p>A shooting-star fell to the south.</p>

  <p>"He calls me! Thither!" cried Gotho, slightly trembling.</p>

  <p>She now drove the sheep more quickly forward, and presently shut them into
  their cot, and entered the large and only chamber of the ground-floor of the
  dwelling-house.</p>

  <p>There she found her grandfather stretched upon the raised stone placed
  close to the hearth; his feet covered with two large sheep-skins.</p>

  <p>He looked paler and older than usual.</p>

  <p>"Seat thyself beside me, Gotho," he said, "and drink; here is milk mixed
  with honey. Listen to me. The time is come of which I have often spoken. We
  must part. I am going home. Thy dear face is indistinct; my tired old eyes
  can no longer distinguish thy features. And yesterday when I tried to go down
  to the spring, my knees failed me. Then I felt that the end was near, and I
  sent the goat-herd over to Teriolis with a message. But thou shalt not be
  present when his soul flies out of old Iffa's mouth. The death of a man is
  not lovely to behold&mdash;especially death upon the straw-bed. And thou hast
  never yet seen anything sorrowful. This shadow shall not fall upon thy young
  life. To-morrow, before cockcrow, brave Hunibad will come over from Teriolis
  to fetch thee&mdash;he has promised me to do so. His wounds are not yet
  healed; he is yet weak; but he says that he cannot remain idle when, as they
  say, the war will be sure to break out again. He wishes to go to King Totila
  in Rome. And there too thou must go with an important message. He shall be
  thy guide and protector. Bind thick soles of beech-rind under thy feet, for
  the way is long. Brun, the dog, may accompany thee. Take that bag of goat's
  leather; in it are six gold pieces which belonged to&mdash;to
  Adalgoth's&mdash;to your father; they are Adalgoth's&mdash;but thou mayst use
  them&mdash;they will last till thou reachest Rome. And take a bundle of
  scented mountain hay from the meadows of the Iffinger, and lay thy head upon
  it at night; then thou wilt sleep more soundly. And when thou reachest Rome
  and the golden palace of the King, and enterest the hall, observe which of
  the men wears a golden circlet upon his brow, and from whose countenance
  shines a light like that of the morning&mdash;that will be King Totila. Then
  bow thy head before him&mdash;but not too much&mdash;and do not bend thy
  knee; for thou art a free Goth's free child. Thou must give the King this
  roll, which I have carefully kept for many summers. It comes from Uncle
  Wargs, who was buried by the mountain."</p>

  <p>The old man lifted a brick from the masonry which separated the hearth
  from the floor of stamped clay, and took from a hole a roll of papyrus,
  which, tied and sealed, was folded in a piece of parchment covered with
  writing and fastened with strange seals.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, "take the greatest care of this writing. That upon the
  parchment cover I myself dictated to Hermegisel over in Majæ. He swore to
  keep it secret, and he has kept his oath. And now he can speak no more from
  out of his grave in the church. And thou and Hunibad&mdash;you cannot read.
  That is a good thing, for it might be dangerous for thee and&mdash;and
  another&mdash;if any one knew what that roll contains before Totila, the mild
  and just King, has read it. Above all, hide it carefully from the Italians.
  And in every town to which thou comest, ask if there dwells Cornelius
  Cethegus Cæsarius, the Prefect of Rome. And if the door-keepers say aye, then
  turn upon thy heel, however tired thou mayst be, and however late the night,
  or hot the day, and wander on until thou hast put three several waters
  between thee and the man Cethegus. And no less carefully than the
  writing&mdash;thou seest that I have put rosin, such as drops from the
  fir-trees, upon it instead of wax, and I have scratched our house-mark upon
  the seal, the mark that our cattle and wagons bear&mdash;not less carefully
  keep this old and costly gold."</p>

  <p>And he took from the hole the half of a broad gold bracelet, such as the
  Gothic heroes wore upon their naked arms. He kissed the bracelet and the
  imperfect Runic inscription upon it reverently.</p>

  <p>"This came from Theodoric, the great King, and from him&mdash;my
  dear&mdash;son Wargs. Mark&mdash;it belongs to Adalgoth. It is his most
  valuable inheritance. The other half of the bracelet&mdash;and the half of
  the inscription&mdash;I gave to the boy when I sent him away. When King
  Totila has read the writing, and if Adalgoth is present&mdash;as he must be
  if he obeys my orders&mdash;then call Adalgoth and put half-ring to
  half-ring, and ask the King to pronounce a judgment. He is said to be mild
  and wise and clear as the light of day. He will judge righteously. If not he,
  then no one. Now kiss my darkening eyes, and go and sleep. May the Lord of
  heaven and all his clear eyes, sun, moon, and stars, shine upon all thy ways.
  When thou hast found Adalgoth, and when thou dwellest with him in the little
  rooms of the close houses in the narrow streets of the city, and when it
  feels too small and close and narrow down there&mdash;then both of you think
  of your childish days up here upon the high Iffinger, and once again the
  fresh mountain air will seem to blow across your heated brows."</p>

  <p>Silently, without objection, without fear, without a question, the
  shepherd-girl listened and obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, grandfather!" she said, kissing him upon his eyes; "I thank
  thee for much love and faithfulness."</p>

  <p>But she did not weep.</p>

  <p>She knew not what death was.</p>

  <p>She went away from him to the threshold of the door, and looked out at the
  mountain landscape, which now appeared dark and melancholy. The sky was
  clear, the summits of the mountains shone in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Farewell!" said Gotho; "farewell, thou Iffinger! and thou, Wolf's-head!
  and thou, old Giant! and thou, running below, bright-shining Passara! Do you
  know it already? To-morrow I leave you all. But I go willingly, for I go to
  <i>him</i>!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-4"
     name="b5b-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">After the lapse of many weeks, Cassiodorus and Julius
  returned from Byzantium, bringing&mdash;no peace.</p>

  <p>On landing, Cassiodorus, weary of the world and its ways, retired at once
  to Brundusium, to his Apulian cloister, leaving Julius to report their
  ill-success to the King in Rome.</p>

  <p>Totila received his friend in the Capitol, in the presence of the leaders
  of the army.</p>

  <p>"At first," related Julius, "our prospects were sufficiently favourable.
  The Emperor, who had formerly refused to receive the ambassadors of Witichis,
  could not shut his palace doors in the face of the most learned man of the
  West, the pious and wise Cassiodorus. We were received with kindness and
  respect. In the council held by the Emperor, men of distinction, such as
  Tribonianus and Procopius, raised their voices in favour of peace. The
  Emperor himself seemed inclined thereto. His two great generals, Narses and
  Belisarius, were fighting, at different points of the south-eastern frontier
  of the Empire, against Persians and Saracens; and the campaign in Italy and
  Dalmatia had demanded such great sacrifices, and had lasted so long, that war
  with the Goths had become hateful to the Emperor. It was indeed not likely
  that he would entirely renounce the hope of reconquering Italy, but he saw
  the impossibility of doing so at present. He therefore willingly entered into
  negotiations of peace, and accepted our proposals for further consideration.
  His first thought was, as he told us, to bring about a provisional division
  of the peninsula; the far larger portion of the country, to the south of the
  Padus, to belong to the Emperor, the northern half to the Goths. One day at
  noon, we had left the Emperor's presence with great hopes; the audience had
  turned out more favourably than all former ones. But in the evening of the
  same day we were surprised by the arrival of the Curo-palata Marcellus,
  accompanied by slaves carrying the gifts which it is customary to present to
  parting guests&mdash;a not-to-be-mistaken sign that all negotiations were
  broken off. Confounded at this sudden change, Cassiodorus decided, for the
  sake of his work of peace, to dare the utmost&mdash;namely, to seek an
  audience of the Emperor after the presentation of the parting gifts.
  Tribonianus, who had always opposed the war, and who highly esteemed
  Cassiodorus, allowed himself to be prevailed upon to sue for this
  extraordinary grace. The answer came in a very ungracious threat of
  banishment should he ever again venture to petition for anything against the
  clearly-expressed will of the Emperor, Never, never would the Emperor
  conclude peace with the barbarians, until they had entirely evacuated the
  kingdom. Never would he look upon the Goths in Italy as anything but enemies.
  In vain we tried," Julius continued, "to discover the cause of this sudden
  change. We only learned that, after our last audience, the Empress, who is
  said to be often suffering, had invited her husband to dinner in her
  apartments. But it is certain that the Empress, formerly known to be the most
  zealous advocate of war, has lately given her voice in favour of peace."</p>

  <p>"And what," asked the King, who had listened quietly, and with an
  expression of countenance more threatening than anxious&mdash;"what has
  procured me the honour of such a change of sentiment in the circus-girl?"</p>

  <p>"It is whispered that, becoming more and more anxious for the salvation of
  her soul, the Empress desires to use all pecuniary means&mdash;not for a war,
  the end of which she scarcely expects to outlive&mdash;but upon the erection
  of churches, and especially for the completion of the church of St. Sophia.
  It is said that she wishes to be buried with the plan of this church
  imprinted upon her bosom."</p>

  <p>"No doubt as a shield against the anger of the Almighty, at the
  resurrection of the dead! The woman thinks to disarm her God with her hundred
  churches, and to bribe Him with the sums expended. What madness this belief
  engenders!" murmured Teja.</p>

  <p>"We could discover nothing," repeated Julius; "for I cannot think the
  shadow of suspicion which crossed my mind, perhaps the shadow of a mistake,
  of any moment."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" inquired Totila.</p>

  <p>"That evening, as I left the palace at a late hour, thinking over
  Tribonianus's unfavourable report, the golden litter of the Empress was
  carried past me by her Cappadocian slaves from the quadrangle of the garden
  where stands the Empress's palace. The trellised shutter was lifted a little
  by the inmate of the litter&mdash;I looked up&mdash;and it seemed to me as if
  I recognised&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked the King.</p>

  <p>"My unhappy protector, the vanished Cethegus," concluded Julius sadly.</p>

  <p>"That can scarcely be," said the King. "He fell when Rome was taken. It
  was surely a mistake when Teja thought he heard his voice in his house."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> mistake that voice!" cried Teja. "And what meant his sword,
  which Adalgoth found at the corner of the street?"</p>

  <p>"He may have lost it earlier, when he hurried to the Tiber from his house.
  I distinctly saw him conduct the defence of the chain from his boat. He
  hurled his spear at me with all the force and steadiness lent by intense
  hatred. And I struck him, I am sure, when I cast the spear back again. And
  Gunthamund, that excellent shot, told me that he was certain that he wounded
  the Prefect in the neck. His mantle with the purple hem was found by the
  river, pierced by many arrows and covered with blood."</p>

  <p>"No doubt he died there," Julius said, very gravely.</p>

  <p>"Are you such good Christians, and do not know that demons are immortal?"
  asked Teja.</p>

  <p>"They may be," said the King, "but so are angels!" and, with a frown on
  his brow, he continued: "Up, my brave Teja! now there is new work for thy
  sword. Hear it, Duke Guntharis, Wisand, Grippa, Markja, Thorismuth, and
  Aligern&mdash;I shall soon have enough to do for you all. You have heard that
  Emperor Justinian refuses to make peace, and will not leave us in quiet
  possession of Italy. It is evident that he considers us inclined to peace at
  any cost. He thinks it can never hurt him to have us for enemies; that in the
  worst case we shall quietly await his attack in Italy; that Byzantium will
  always be able to choose the moment, repeating it until successful.
  Well&mdash;we will show him that we can become dangerous! That it might be
  wiser to leave us Italy, and not irritate us! He will not let us enjoy our
  kingdom? Then, as in the days of Alaric and Theodoric, he shall again see the
  Goths in his own country! At present only this&mdash;for secrecy is the
  mother of victory&mdash;we will reach the heart of the Eastern Empire as we
  once reached Rome&mdash;on canvas wings and wooden bridges.&mdash;Now,
  Justinianus, protect thine own hearth-stone!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-5"
     name="b5b-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after the Emperor's refusal of the proposals of the
  Goths had arrived in Rome, we find&mdash;in the dining-room of a simple but
  tastefully-built and furnished house upon the Forum Strategii at Byzantium,
  which, close to the incomparable shore of the Golden Horn, affords a view of
  the Straits and of the splendid suburb "Justiniana"&mdash;two men engaged in
  confidential talk.</p>

  <p>The master of the house was our old&mdash;and, we hope, not
  unloved&mdash;acquaintance Procopius, who now lived much respected as a
  senator in Byzantium.</p>

  <p>He zealously attended to the wants of his guest, but in doing so used his
  left hand. His right arm ended in a covered stump.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he was saying, "at every moment I am reminded by my missing hand of
  a folly. I do not, however, repent it. I should do the same thing again even
  if it cost me my eyesight. It was a folly of the heart, and to be capable of
  that is the greatest happiness. I have never been able really to love a
  woman. My only love was and is&mdash;Belisarius! I know very well&mdash;you
  need not draw down the corners of your mouth so contemptuously,
  friend&mdash;I see very clearly the weaknesses and imperfections of my hero.
  But that is exactly what is sweet in a heart-folly&mdash;to love the foibles
  of your idol more than the merits of other people. And so&mdash;to cut my
  story short&mdash;it was during the last Persian war that, one day, I warned
  the lion-hearted general not to ride through a dangerous wood with a scanty
  escort. Of course he did it all the more, the dear fool; and of course
  Procopius, the wise fool, rode with him. All happened just as I had expected.
  The whole wood was suddenly filled with Persians. It seemed as if the wind
  had shaken the withered leaves from the trees, and every leaf was an axe or a
  spear. It was very like the ambush before the Tiburtinian Gate. Balan, the
  faithful piebald, bore his master for the last time. Stuck full of spears, he
  fell dead to the ground. I assisted the hero to mount my own horse. But a
  Persian prince, who was almost as tall as his name was long&mdash;the
  pleasant fellow was called Adrastaransalanes&mdash;aimed a blow at the
  magister militum which, in my hurry, I received upon my right arm&mdash;for
  my shield was occupied in protecting Belisarius against a Saracen. The blow
  was well meant; if it had reached my hero's helmless head, it would have
  cracked it like a nutshell. As it was, it only cut off my fore-arm as if it
  had never been part of my body."</p>

  <p>"Of course Belisarius escaped, and of course Procopius was taken
  prisoner," said the guest, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, you commander of perspicacity, as my friend
  Adrastaransalanes would call you. But the same man with his long body,
  scimitar, and name&mdash;you will not insist upon my repeating it&mdash;was
  so moved by my 'elephantine magnanimity,' as he expressed himself, that he
  very soon set me free without ransom. He only begged for a ring which had
  been on the finger of my former right hand: as a remembrance, he said. Since
  then it is all over with my campaigns," added Procopius more gravely. "But in
  this loss of my pen-hand I see a punishment. I have written with it many a
  useless or not perfectly sincere word. However, if a like punishment overtook
  all the writers of Byzantium, there would soon be not a two-handed man left
  who could write. Writing is now a much slower and more difficult process with
  me. But that is good, for then, at every word one considers whether it is
  worth the trouble of inscribing or whether one is justified in doing so."</p>

  <p>"I have read with true enjoyment," said the guest, "your 'Vandal Wars,'
  your 'Persian Wars,' and, as far as it goes, the 'Gothic War.' When
  recovering from my hurt, it was my favourite book. But I am surprised that
  you were not sent to the Ult-ziagirian Huns and the mines of Cherson to keep
  our friend Petros company. If Justinian so severely punishes the forgery of
  documents&mdash;how harshly must he punish veracity in history! And you have
  so mercilessly scourged his indecision, his avarice, his mistakes in the
  choice of generals and officers&mdash;I wonder that you go unpunished."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have not escaped punishment," said the historian gravely. "He left
  me my head: but he tried to rob me of my honour; and <i>she</i> still more,
  the beautiful demon. For I had hinted that Justinian was tied to her
  apron-string. And she as passionately tries to hide her dominion as to uphold
  it. When my book was published, she called me to her. When I entered her
  apartment, and saw those pages upon her lap, I
  thought&mdash;Adrastaransalanes took off the hand that wrote; this woman will
  take off the head that thought. But she contented herself with giving me her
  little golden shoe to kiss; smiled very sweetly, and said, 'You write Greek
  better than any other author of our day, Procopius. So beautifully and so
  truly! I have been advised to sink you to the dumb fishes in the Bosphorus.
  But the man who so well told the truth when it was bitter to us, will also
  tell the truth when it is sweet to our ears. The greatest censurer of
  Justinian shall be his greatest panegyrist. Your punishment for the book upon
  Justinian's warlike deeds&mdash;shall be a book upon Justinian's peaceful
  deeds. You will write by the imperial order a book upon the edifices erected
  by the Emperor. You cannot deny that he has done great things in that line.
  If you were a better jurist than your camp-life with the great Belisarius
  has, unfortunately, allowed you to become&mdash;you should describe the
  Emperor's great piece of mosaic&mdash;his pandects. But for that your legal
  education is not complete enough' (and she was right!). 'Therefore you will
  describe the edifices of Justinian; and you yourself will be a living
  monument of his generosity. For you must confess that, for far less heinous
  offences, many an author under former Emperors has lost eyes, nose, and other
  things that it is disagreeable to miss. No Emperor has ever allowed such
  things to be said of him, and, moreover, rewarded candour with new
  commissions. But if the edifices of Justinian were to displease you, then
  indeed I fear you would not long outlive your want of taste&mdash;the gods
  would punish such ingratitude with a speedy death. See, I have procured this
  reward for you&mdash;for Justinian would have made you senator&mdash;so that
  you may be right in your assertion that Theodora possesses a pernicious and
  all-commanding influence!' Another kiss of her foot; of which she took
  advantage playfully to strike me on the mouth with her shoe. I had made my
  will before going to this audience. You now see how this demon in a woman's
  form revenges herself upon me! One really cannot censure the edifices erected
  by Justinian: one can only be silent&mdash;or praise them. If I remain
  silent, it will cost me my life. If I speak and do not praise, it will cost
  my life and my veracity. Therefore I must either praise or die. And I am weak
  enough," concluded Procopius with a sigh, "to prefer to praise and live."</p>

  <p>"You have consumed so much Thucydides and Tacitus, dry or liquid," said
  the guest, filling the glasses, "and yet have become neither a Thucydides nor
  a Tacitus!"</p>

  <p>"I would rather let my long-named friend cut off my left hand also than
  write about these buildings."</p>

  <p>"Keep your hand. But, after the public panegyric on the buildings, write a
  secret history of the shameful deeds of Justinian and Theodora."</p>

  <p>Procopius sprang from his seat.</p>

  <p>"That would be devilish, but grand! The advice is worthy of you, friend.
  For that you shall have one of the nine muses of Herodotus from my
  cellar&mdash;my oldest, dearest, most excellent wine. Oh! this secret history
  shall excite astonishment! The only pity is that I cannot relate the most
  filthy and most murderous deeds. I should die of disgust. And that which I
  can write will be always looked upon as immensely exaggerated. And what will
  posterity say of Procopius, who left a panegyric, a criticism, and an
  accusation&mdash;one and all on Justinian?"</p>

  <p>"Posterity will say that he was the greatest historian, but also the son
  and the victim, of the Empire of Byzantium. Revenge yourself; she has left
  you your clever head and your left hand. Well, your left hand need not know
  what your right hand formerly wrote. Draw the picture of this Empress and her
  husband for all future generations. Then <i>they</i> will not have conquered
  with their buildings, but <i>you</i> with your secret history. They would
  have punished limited candour; you will punish them by an unlimited
  revelation of the truth. Every one revenges himself with his own
  weapons&mdash;the bull with his horns, the warrior with his sword, the author
  by his pen."</p>

  <p>"Particularly," said Procopius, "when he has only his left hand. I thank
  you, and will follow your advice, Cethegus. I will write the 'Secret History'
  in revenge for the 'Edifices.' But now it is your turn to tell your story. I
  know the progress of events, through letters and the report of fugitives from
  Rome, or legionaries set free by Totila, until the time when you were last
  seen in your house, or, as they say, were last heard. Now relate what
  happened afterwards, you Prefect without a city!"</p>

  <p>"Immediately," said Cethegus. "But tell me first, how did Belisarius
  succeed in the last Persian war?"</p>

  <p>"As usual. You should not need to ask such a question! He had really
  beaten the enemy, and was on the point of forcing the Persian King, Chosroes,
  the son of Kabades, to conclude a lasting peace. Just then Areobindos, the
  Prince of Purple Snails, appeared in the camp with the announcement of an
  armistice of half a year's duration, granted, unknown to Belisarius, by
  Byzantium. Justinian had long ago entered into secret negotiations with
  Chosroes; he needed money; he again pretended to mistrust Belisarius, and let
  the Persian King escape for a hundred tons of gold, just as we were about to
  draw the net over him. Narses was wiser. When the Prince of Purple Snails
  came to him, on the Saracen side of the scene of war, he declared that the
  ambassador must be either a forger or a madman, took him prisoner, and
  continued the war until he had completely vanquished the Saracens. Then he
  sent the imperial ambassador back with an excuse to Byzantium. But the best
  excuse was the keys and treasures of seventy forts and towns which he had
  wrested from the enemy during the armistice, which Belisarius had
  respected."</p>

  <p>"This Narses is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The greatest man of our time," said Procopius, "the Prefect of Rome not
  excepted; for he does not, like the latter, wish for impossibilities. But
  we&mdash;that is, Belisarius and the cripple Procopius&mdash;always growling
  and grumbling, yet always as faithful as a poodle-dog, and never taught by
  experience, kept the armistice, gnashed our teeth, and returned to Byzantium.
  And now we wait for new commissions, laurels, and kicks. Fortunately,
  Antonina has renounced her inclination for the flowers and verses of other
  men, and so the couple&mdash;the lion and the dove&mdash;live very happily
  together here in Byzantium. Belisarius, day and night, naturally thinks of
  nothing but how he can again prove his heroism and devotion to his imperial
  master. Justinian is his folly, as Belisarius is mine. But now for your
  story."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-6"
     name="b5b-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Cethegus took a deep draught from the cup which stood before
  him, which was made of chased gold and shaped like a tower.</p>

  <p>He was considerably changed since that last night in Rome. The wrinkles on
  his temples were more sharply defined; his lip more firmly closed; his
  under-lip protruded still farther than before; and the ironical smile, which
  used to make him look younger and handsomer, very rarely played round the
  corners of his mouth. His eyes were generally half shut; only sometimes did
  he raise the lids to dart a glance, which, always dreaded by those upon whom
  it fell, now appeared more cruel and piercing than ever.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have become, not older, but harsher, more inexorable, and
  more merciless.</p>

  <p>"You know," he began, "all that happened until the fall of Rome. In one
  night I lost the city, the Capitol, my house, and my Cæsar! The crash of the
  fall of that image pained me more than the arrows of the Goths, or even of
  the Romans. As I was about to punish the destroyer of my Cæsar, my senses
  forsook me. I fell at the foot of the statue of Jupiter. I was restored to my
  senses by the cool breeze that blows over the Tiber, and which once before,
  twenty years ago, had restored a wounded man."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Of that another time, perhaps&mdash;perhaps never," he said, hastily
  cutting short a question from his host. "This time Lucius Licinius&mdash;his
  brother died for Rome and for me&mdash;and the faithful Moor, who had escaped
  the Black Earl as if by miracle, saved my life. Cast out of the front
  entrance by Teja&mdash;who, in his eagerness to murder the master, had no
  time to murder the slave&mdash;Syphax hurried to the back-door. There he met
  Lucius Licinius, who had only just then reached my house by a side-street.
  Together they followed the trace of my blood to the hall of the Jupiter.
  There they found me senseless, and had just time to lower me from the window,
  like a piece of baggage, into the court. Syphax jumped down and received me
  from the hands of the tribune, who then quickly followed, and they hurried
  with me to the river.</p>

  <p>"There very few people were to be seen, for all the Goths and friendly
  Romans had followed the King to the Capitol to help to extinguish the flames.
  Totila had expressly ordered&mdash;I hope to his destruction!&mdash;that all
  non-combatants should be spared and left unmolested. So my bearers were
  allowed to pass everywhere. It was thought that they carried a dead man. And
  they themselves, for some time, thought so too. In the river they found an
  empty fishing-boat full of nets. They laid me in it. Syphax threw my bloody
  mantle, with the purple hem of the 'princeps senatus,' upon the shore, in
  order to mislead my enemies. They covered me with sail-cloth and nets, and
  rowed down the river, through the still burning boats. When we had passed
  them, I came to myself. Syphax bathed my face with the water of the Tiber. My
  first glance fell on the still burning Capitol. They told me that my first
  exclamation was, 'Turn back! the Capitol!' And they were obliged to keep me
  quiet by force. My first clear thought was naturally: 'To return; to take
  revenge; to re-conquer Rome.' In the harbour of Portus we met with an Italian
  ship laden with grain. There were seven rowers in it. My companions
  approached it to beg for wine and bread, for they also were wounded and
  exhausted. The rowers recognised me. One of them wanted to take me prisoner
  and deliver me up to the Goths, sure of a rich reward. But the other six had
  served under me at the Mausoleum. I had nourished them for years. They slew
  the man who wanted to betray me, and promised Lucius that they would save me
  if it were possible. They hid me in heaps of grain while we passed the Gothic
  guardships which watched at the entrance of the harbour, Lucius and Syphax
  put on the dress of sailors, and rowed with the others. Thus we escaped. But
  while on board this vessel I was dangerously ill from my wounds. Only the
  ceaseless care of Syphax and the sea-air saved me. For days, they say, I only
  reiterated the words, 'Rome, Capitol, Cæsar!' When we landed at Panormus, in
  Sicily, under the protection of the Byzantines, I rapidly recovered. My old
  friend Cyprianus, who had admitted me into Theodoric's palace when I was made
  Prefect, received me at Panormus as captain of the harbour. Scarcely
  recovered, I went to Asia Minor&mdash;or, as you say, Asiana&mdash;to my
  estates; you know that I had splendid possessions at Sardes, Philadelphia,
  and Tralles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have them no longer&mdash;the columned villas?"</p>

  <p>"I sold them all, for I was obliged at once to find the means of engaging
  fresh mercenaries, in order to liberate Rome and Italy."</p>

  <p>"Tenax propositi!" cried Procopius, amazed. "You have not, even now, given
  up hope?"</p>

  <p>"Can I give up myself? I have sent Licinius to enlist a wild and savage
  race, the Longobardians."</p>

  <p>"God protect your Italy if <i>they</i> ever set foot in it."</p>

  <p>"I have also succeeded in winning the Empress to my cause, and by her
  means the propositions of peace made by Cassiodorus were refused at the last
  moment. For Rome must be freed from the barbarians! But when shall I find
  means to move this lazy colossus, Justinian? When will fate call me to my
  battle-field&mdash;Italia?"</p>

  <p>At this moment Syphax entered the room. He brought Cethegus a message from
  the Empress. It ran:</p>

  <p>"To the Jupiter of the Capitol. Do not leave your house to-morrow until I
  call you.&mdash;Theodora."</p>

  <p>On the next day the Emperor Justinian was standing buried in deep
  reflection before the tall golden crucifix in his room. The expression of his
  face was very grave, but without a trace of alarm or doubt. Quiet decision
  lay upon his features, which, else not handsome or noble, at this moment
  betrayed mental power and superiority. He lifted his eyes almost
  threateningly to the crucifix.</p>

  <p>"God of the Cross," he said, "Thou puttest Thy faithful servant to a hard
  proof! It seems to me that I have deserved better. Thou knowest all that I
  have done to the honour of Thy name! Why do not Thy strokes fall upon Thine
  enemies, the heathens and barbarians? Why not?"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted in his soliloquy by the entrance of the chamberlains
  and wardrobe-keepers.</p>

  <p>Justinian exchanged his morning garment for the robes of state. His slaves
  served him upon their knees.</p>

  <p>He apparelled himself in a tunic of white silk, reaching to the knees,
  embroidered with gold on both sides, and confined by a purple girdle. The
  tightly-fitting hose were also of silk of the same colour. His slaves threw
  over his shoulders a splendid mantle of a lighter shade of purple, with a
  broad hem of gold thread, upon which red circles and symbolic animal-forms,
  embroidered in green silk, alternated with each other. But the pearls and
  precious stones which were lavishly strewed over it, rendered the design
  almost invisible, and made the mantle so heavy, that the assistance of the
  train-bearer must have been indeed a welcome relief.</p>

  <p>On each of his arms the Emperor wore three broad golden bracelets. The
  wide crown was made of massive gold, arched over with two rows of pearls. His
  mantle was fastened on the shoulder with a costly brooch of large precious
  stones.</p>

  <p>The sceptre-keeper put into the Emperor's hand a golden staff the length
  of a man, at the top of which was a globe made out of a single large emerald,
  and surmounted with a golden cross.</p>

  <p>The Emperor grasped it firmly and rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>A slave offered him the thick-soled buskins which he usually wore, in
  order to increase his height.</p>

  <p>"No; to-day I need no buskins," said Justinian, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Down the Stairs of the Lions, so called from the twenty-four immense
  marble lions which guarded the twelve steps, and which had been brought from
  Carthage by Belisarius, the Emperor descended to a lower story, and entered
  the Hall of Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>This hall derived its name from the porphyry columns, the onyx vases, the
  golden tables and the numerous golden vessels which, arranged on pedestals
  and along the walls, were said to have formerly decorated the Temple of
  Jerusalem. These treasures had been taken to Rome by Titus, after the
  destruction of Jerusalem. From Rome the Sea-king Geiseric had taken them on
  his dragon-ships, together with the Empress Eudoxia, to his capital,
  Carthage. And now Belisarius had brought them from Carthage to the Emperor of
  the East.</p>

  <p>The cupola of the hall, representing the firmament, was wrought in mosaic.
  Costly blue stones formed the ground-work, in which was inlaid, besides the
  sun, the moon, the eye of God, the lamb, the fish, the birds, the palm, the
  vine, the unicorn, and many other symbols of Christianity, the whole zodiac
  and innumerable stars of massive gold.</p>

  <p>The cost of the cupola alone was estimated as high as the whole income of
  the taxes on property in all the Empire for forty-five years.</p>

  <p>Opposite the three great arches of the entrance, which were closed by
  curtains&mdash;it was the only entrance to the hall&mdash;and were guarded
  outside by a threefold line of imperial body-guards&mdash;the "Golden
  Shields"&mdash;stood, at the bottom of the semicircular hall, the elevated
  throne of the Emperor, and below it on the left the seat of the Empress.</p>

  <p>When Justinian entered the hall with a numerous retinue of palace
  officials, all the assembly, consisting of the highest dignitaries of the
  realm, threw themselves upon their faces in humble prostration.</p>

  <p>The Empress also rose, bowed deeply, and crossed her arms upon her bosom.
  Her dress was exactly similar to that of her husband. Her white stola was
  also covered by a purple mantle, but without hem. She carried a very short
  sceptre of ivory.</p>

  <p>The Emperor cast a slight but contemptuous glance at the patriarchs,
  archbishops, bishops, patricians and senators, who, above thirty in number,
  occupied a row of gilded chairs set in a semicircle and provided with
  cushions. He then passed through the middle of the hall and ascended his
  throne with a quick firm step. Twelve of the chief officers of the palace
  stood upon the steps of the two thrones, holding white wands in their hands.
  A blast of trumpets gave the signal to the kneeling assembly to rise.</p>

  <p>"Reverend bishops and worthy senators," began the Emperor, "we have called
  you together, to ask your advice in an affair of great moment. But why is our
  Magister Militum per Orientum, Narses, absent?"</p>

  <p>"He returned only yesterday from Persia&mdash;he is sick and confined to
  bed," answered the usher.</p>

  <p>"Where is our treasurer of the Sacri Palatii, Trebonianus?"</p>

  <p>"He has not yet returned from his embassy to Berytus about the code."</p>

  <p>"Where is Belisarius, our Magister Militum per Orientum extra
  Ordinem?"</p>

  <p>"He does not reside in Byzantium, but in Asia, in the Red House at
  Sycæ."</p>

  <p>"He keeps too far apart in the Red House. It displeases us. Why does he
  avoid our presence?"</p>

  <p>"He could not be found."</p>

  <p>"Not even in the house of his freedman, Photius?"</p>

  <p>"He has gone hunting to try the Persian hunting-leopards," said Leo, the
  assistant-huntsman.</p>

  <p>"He is never to be found when wanted, and is always present when not
  wanted. I am not content with Belisarius.&mdash;Hear now what has lately been
  communicated to me by letter; afterwards you shall hear the report of the
  envoys themselves. You know that we have allowed the war in Italy to die
  away&mdash;for we had other occupation for our generals. You know that the
  barbarian King sued for peace and the quiet possession of Italy. We rejected
  it at that time; awaiting more convenient circumstances. The Goth has
  answered, not in words, but by very insolent deeds. No one in Byzantium knows
  of it&mdash;we kept the news to ourselves, thinking it impossible, or at
  least exaggerated. But we find that it is true; and now you shall hear it and
  advise upon it. The barbarian King has sent a fleet and an army to Dalmatia
  with great haste and secrecy. The fleet entered the harbour of Muicurum near
  Salona; the army landed and carried the fortress by storm. In a similar way
  the fleet surprised the coast-town of Laureata. Claudianus, our governor at
  Salona, sent numerous and strongly-manned vessels to retake the town from the
  Goths. But a naval combat took place, and the Goth, Duke Guntharis, beat our
  Squadron so thoroughly that he made prizes of all the vessels without
  exception, and carried them victoriously into the harbour of Laureata.
  Further, the Gothic King equipped a second fleet of four hundred large ships
  at Centumcellæ. It was formed for the most part of Byzantine vessels, which,
  sent from the East to Sicily to reinforce Belisarius, in ignorance that the
  Italian harbours were again in possession of the Goths, had been taken by a
  Gothic earl, Grippa, with all their crews and freights. The goal of this
  second fleet was unknown. But suddenly the barbarian King himself appeared
  with the fleet before Regium, the fortress in the extreme southern part of
  Bruttia, which place we had won on our first landing in Italy, and had not
  since lost. After a brave resistance, the garrison of Herulians and Massagetæ
  were forced to capitulate. But the tyrant Totila sailed immediately to
  Sicily, to wrest from us that earliest of Belisarius's conquests. He beat the
  Roman governor Domnentiolus, who met him in the open field, and in a short
  time took possession of the whole island, with the exception of Messana,
  Panormus and Syracusæ, which were enabled to hold out by reason of their
  formidable fortifications. A fleet which I sent to attempt the reconquest of
  Sicily was dispersed by a storm. A second was driven by the north-west wind
  to the Peloponnesus. At the same time a third fleet of triremes, equipped by
  this indefatigable King and commanded by Earl Haduswinth, sailed for Corsica
  and Sardinia. The first of these islands presently fell to the Goths, after
  the imperial garrison of the capital city of Alexia had been beaten before
  the walls. The rich Corsican Furius Ahalla, to whom the greater part of the
  island belongs, was absent in India. But his stewards and tenants had been
  ordered, in case of a landing of the Goths, in nowise to oppose them, but to
  aid them to the best of their power. From Corsica the barbarians turned to
  Sardinia. Here, near Karalis, they beat the troops which our magister militum
  had sent from Africa to conquer the island, and took Karalis as well as
  Sulci, Castra Trajani and Turres. The Goths then settled down in both islands
  and treated them as permanently-acquired dependencies of the Gothic kingdom,
  placing Gothic commanders in all the towns, and raising taxes according to
  Gothic law. Strange to say, these taxes are far less heavy than ours, and the
  inhabitants shamelessly declare that they would rather pay the barbarians
  fifty than ninety to us. But all this was not enough. Sailing to the
  north-east from Sicily, the tyrant Totila united his squadron with a fourth
  fleet, under Earl Teja, off Hydrus. Part of this united fleet, under Earl
  Thorismuth, sailed to Corcyra, took possession of that island, and thence
  conquered all the surrounding islands. But not yet enough. The tyrant Totila
  and Earl Teja already attack the mainland of our Empire."</p>

  <p>A murmur of terror interrupted the august speaker.</p>

  <p>Justinian resumed in an angry voice:</p>

  <p>"They have landed in the harbour of Epirus vetus, carried the towns
  Nicopolis and Anchisus, south-west of the ancient Dodona, and taken a great
  many of our ships along the coast. All this may excite your indignation
  against the insolence of these barbarians; but you have now to hear what will
  move you in a different way. Briefly, according to reports which reached me
  yesterday, it is certain that the Goths are in full march upon Byzantium
  itself!"</p>

  <p>At this some of the senators sprang to their feet.</p>

  <p>"They intend a double attack. Their united fleet, commanded by Duke
  Guntharis, Earls Markja, Grippa, and Thorismuth, has beaten, in a combat of
  two days' duration, the fleet which protected our island provinces, and has
  driven it into the straits of Sestos and Abydos. Their army, under Totila and
  Teja, is marching across Thessaly by way of Dodona against Macedonia.
  Thessalonica is already threatened. Earl Teja has razed to the ground the
  'New Wall' which we had there erected. The road to Byzantium is open. And no
  army stands between us and the barbarians. All our troops are on the Persian
  frontier. And now listen to what the Goth proposes. Fortunately God has
  befooled and blinded him to our weakness. He again offers us peace under the
  former conditions, with the one exception that he now intends to keep
  possession of Sicily. But he will evacuate all his other conquests if we will
  acknowledge his rule in Italy. As I had no means, neither fleets nor cohorts,
  to stop his victorious course, I have, for the present, demanded an
  armistice. This he has agreed to, on condition that afterwards peace is to be
  concluded on the former conditions. I have agreed to this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And, pausing, the Emperor cast a searching glance at the assembly, and
  looked askance at the Empress.</p>

  <p>The assembly was evidently relieved. The Empress closed her eyes in order
  to conceal their expression. Her small hand grasped convulsively the arm of
  her throne.</p>

  <p>"But I agreed to it with the reservation that I should first hear the
  opinion of my wife, who has lately been an advocate for peace, and that also
  of my wise senate. I added that I myself was inclined to peace."</p>

  <p>All present looked more at ease.</p>

  <p>"And I believed that I could tell beforehand what would be the decision of
  my counsellors. Upon this understanding, the horsemen of Earl Teja
  unwillingly halted at Thessalonica; unfortunately they had already taken
  prisoner the bishop of that city. But they have sent him here with other
  prisoners, carrying messages and letters&mdash;you shall hear them and then
  decide. Reflect that if we refuse to conclude a peace, the barbarians will
  soon stand before our gates, and that we are only asked to yield that which
  the Empire has given up long ago, and which Belisarius in two campaigns
  failed to reconquer&mdash;Italia! Let the envoys approach."</p>

  <p>Through the arches of the entrance the body-guard now led in several men,
  in clerical, official, and military costume. Trembling and sighing, they
  threw themselves at the feet of Justinian. Even tears were not wanting.</p>

  <p>At a sign from the Emperor they rose again, and stood before the steps of
  the throne.</p>

  <p>"Your petitions and lamentations," said the Emperor, "I received
  yesterday. Protonotary, now read to us the letter from the Bishop of
  Nicopolis and the wounded Governor of Illyricum&mdash;since then the latter
  has succumbed to his wounds."</p>

  <p>The protonotary read:</p>

  <p>"To Justinianus, the unconquerable Emperor of the Romani, Dorotheos,
  Bishop of Nicopolis, and Nazares, Governor of Illyricum. The place whence we
  write these words will be the best proof of their gravity. We write on board
  the royal barge of the Gothic King, the <i>Italia</i>. When you read these
  words, you will have already learned the defeat of the fleet, the loss of the
  islands, the storming of the 'New Wall,' and the destruction of the army of
  Illyricum. Quicker than the messengers and the fugitives from these battles,
  have the Gothic pursuers reached us. The Gothic King has conquered and spared
  Nicopolis. Earl Teja has conquered and burnt Anchisus. I, Nazares, have
  served in the army for thirty years&mdash;and never have I seen such an
  attack as that in which Earl Teja overthrew me at the gates of Anchisus. They
  are irresistible, these Goths! Their horsemen sweep the country from
  Thessalonica to Philippi. The Goths in the heart of Illyricum! That has not
  been heard of for sixty years. And the King has sworn to return every year
  until he has peace&mdash;or Byzantium! Since he won Corcyra and the Sybotes,
  he stands upon the bridge of your Empire. Therefore, as God has touched the
  heart of this King, as he offers peace at a moderate price&mdash;the price of
  what he has actually gained&mdash;we beseech you, in the name of your
  trembling subjects, and of your smoking towns, to conclude a peace! Save us
  and save Byzantium! For your generals Belisarius and Narses will rather be
  able to stop the course of the sun and the blowing of the wind, than to stay
  King Totila and the terrible Teja."</p>

  <p>"They are prisoners," said the Emperor, interrupting the reader; "and
  perhaps they speak in fear of death. Now it is your turn to speak, venerable
  Bishop of Thessalonica; you, Anatolius, commander of Dodona; and you,
  Parmenio, brave captain of the Macedonian lancers. You are safe here under
  our imperial protection, but you have seen the barbarian generals. What do
  you advise?"</p>

  <p>At this the aged Bishop of Thessalonica again threw himself upon his
  knees, and cried:</p>

  <p>"O Emperor of the Romani, the barbarian King, Totila, is a heretic, and
  accursed for ever, yet never have I seen a man more richly endowed with all
  Christian virtues! Do not strive with him! In the other world he will be
  damned for ever, but&mdash;I cannot comprehend it&mdash;on earth God blesses
  all his ways. He is irresistible!"</p>

  <p>"I understand it well," interposed Anatolius. "It is his craft which wins
  for him all hearts&mdash;the deepest hypocrisy, a power of dissimulation
  which outdoes all our much-renowned and defamed Grecian cunning. The
  barbarian plays the part of a philanthropist so excellently, that he almost
  deceived me, until I reflected that there was no such thing in the world as
  the love which this man pretends, with all the art of a comedian. He acts as
  if he really felt compassion for his conquered enemies! He feeds the hungry,
  he divides the booty&mdash;your tax-money, O Emperor!&mdash;amongst the
  country people, whose fields have been devastated by the war. Women who had
  fled into the woods, and were found by his horsemen, he returns uninjured to
  their husbands. He enters the villages to the sound of a harp, played by a
  beautiful youth, who leads his horse. Do you know what is the consequence?
  Your own subjects, O Emperor of the Romani, rebel to him, and deliver your
  officers, who have obeyed your severe laws, into his hands. The peasants and
  farmers of Dodona did so by me. This barbarian is the greatest comedian of
  the century, and the clever hypocrite understands many other things besides
  fighting. He has entered into an alliance against you with the distant
  Persians, with your inveterate enemy Chosroes. We ourselves saw the Persian
  ambassador ride out of his camp towards the East."</p>

  <p>When Anatolius had ceased speaking, the Macedonian captain gave his
  report, which ran:</p>

  <p>"Ruler of the Romani&mdash;since Earl Teja gained the high-road of
  Thessalonica, nothing stands between your throne and his battle-axe but the
  walls of this city. He who stormed the 'New Wall' eight times in succession,
  and carried it at the ninth attempt, will carry the walls of Byzantium at the
  tenth. You can only repel the Goths if you have sevenfold their number. If
  you have it not, then conclude a peace."</p>

  <p>"Peace! peace! we beseech you, in the name of your trembling provinces of
  Epirus, Thessaly, and Macedonia!"</p>

  <p>"Deliver us from the Goths!"</p>

  <p>"Let us not again see the days of Alaric and Theodoric!"</p>

  <p>"Peace with the Goths! Peace! peace!"</p>

  <p>And all the envoys, bishops, officials, and warriors sank upon their knees
  with the cry of "Peace!"</p>

  <p>The effect upon the assembly was fearful.</p>

  <p>It had often happened that Persians and Saracens in the east. Moors in the
  south, and Bulgarians and Slavonians in the north-west, had made incursions
  into the country, slaying and plundering, and had sometimes beaten the troops
  sent against them, and escaped unhindered with their booty. But that Grecian
  islands should be permanently conquered by the enemy, that Grecian harbours
  should be won and governed by barbarians, and that the high-road to Byzantium
  should be dominated by Goths, was unheard of.</p>

  <p>With dismay the senators thought of the days when Gothic ships and Gothic
  armies should overrun all the Grecian islands, and repeatedly storm the walls
  of Byzantium, only to be stopped by the fulfilment of all their demands. They
  already seemed to hear the battle-axe of the "Black Earl" knocking at their
  gates.</p>

  <p>Quietly and searchingly did Justinian look into the rows of anxious faces
  on his right and on his left.</p>

  <p>"You have heard," he then began, "what Church, State, and Army desire. I
  now ask your opinion. We have already accomplished an armistice. Shall war or
  shall peace ensue? One word will buy peace&mdash;our assent to the cession of
  Italy, which is already lost. Whoever among you is in favour of war, let him
  hold up his hand."</p>

  <p>No one moved; for the senators were afraid for Byzantium, and they had no
  doubt of the Emperor's inclination for peace.</p>

  <p>"My senate unanimously declares for peace. I knew it beforehand," said
  Justinian, with a singular smile. "I am accustomed always to follow the
  advice of my wise councillors&mdash;and of my Empress."</p>

  <p>At this word Theodora started from her seat, and threw her ivory sceptre
  from her with such violence, that it flew far across the hall.</p>

  <p>The senators were startled.</p>

  <p>"Then farewell," cried the Empress, "farewell to what has ever been my
  pride&mdash;my belief in Justinian and his imperial dignity! Farewell all
  share in the cares and honours of the state! Alas, Justinian! alas for you
  and me that I must hear such words from your lips!"</p>

  <p>And she hid her face in her purple mantle, in order to conceal the agony
  which her excitement caused her.</p>

  <p>The Emperor turned towards her.</p>

  <p>"What! the Augusta, my wife, who, since Belisarius returned to Byzantium
  for the second time, has always advocated peace&mdash;with a short
  exception&mdash;does she now, in such a time of danger,
  advise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"War!" cried Theodora, uncovering her face. And, in her intense
  earnestness, she looked more beautiful than she ever did when smiling in
  playful sport. "Must I, your wife, remind you of your honour? Will you suffer
  these barbarians to fix themselves firmly in your Empire, and force you to
  their will? You, who dreamt of the re-establishment of the Empire of
  Constantine! You, Justinian, who have taken the names of Persicus,
  Vandalicus, Alanicus, and Gothicus&mdash;you will allow this Gothic stripling
  to lead you by the beard whithersoever he will? Are you not the same
  Justinian who has been admired by the world, by Byzantium, and by Theodora?
  Our admiration was an error!"</p>

  <p>On hearing these words, the Patriarch of Byzantium&mdash;he still believed
  that the Emperor had irrevocably decided upon peace&mdash;took courage to
  oppose the Empress, who did not always hit upon the strict definition of
  orthodoxy of which he was the representative.</p>

  <p>"What!" he said, "the august lady advises bloody war? Verily, the Holy
  Church has no need to plead for the heretic. Notwithstanding, the new King is
  wonderfully mild towards the Catholics in Italy; and we can wait for more
  favourable times, until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, priest!" interrupted Theodora; "the outraged honour of this Empire
  can wait no longer! O Justinian!"&mdash;he still remained obstinately
  silent&mdash;"O Justinian, let us not be deceived in you! You dare not let
  that be wrung from you by defiance which you refused to humble petitions!
  Must I remind you that once before your wife's advice, and will, and courage,
  saved your honour? Have you forgotten the terrible rebellion of the Nika?
  Have you forgotten how the united parties of the Circus, of the frantic mob
  of Byzantium, attacked this house? The flames arose, and the cry of 'Down
  with the tyrants!' rang in our ears. All your councillors advised flight or
  compliance; all these reverend bishops and wise senators, and even your
  generals; for Narses was away in distant Asia, and Belisarius was shut up by
  the rebels in the palace on the shore. All were in despair. Your wife
  Theodora was the only hero by your side. If you had yielded or fled, your
  throne, your life, and most certainly your honour, would have been lost. You
  hesitated. You were inclined to fly. 'Remain, and die if need be,' I then
  said; 'but die in the purple!' And you remained, and your courage saved you.
  You awaited death upon your throne, with me at your side&mdash;and God sent
  Belisarius to our relief! I speak the same now. Do not yield. Emperor of the
  Romani&mdash;do not yield to the barbarians! Stand firm. Let the ruins of the
  Golden Gate overwhelm you if the axe of the terrible Goth can force it; but
  die an Emperor! This purple is stained by the immeasurable insolence of these
  Germans. I throw it from me, and I swear by the wisdom of God, never will I
  again resume it until the Empire is rid of the Goths!"</p>

  <p>And she tore off her mantle and threw it down upon the steps of the
  throne. But then, greatly exhausted, she was on the point of sinking back
  into her seat when Justinianus caught her in his arms and pressed her to his
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"Theodora," he cried, "my glorious wife! You need no purple on your
  shoulders&mdash;your spirit is clothed in purple! You alone understand
  Justinian. War, and destruction to the Goths!"</p>

  <p>At this spectacle the trembling senators were overwhelmed with terror and
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, wise fathers," cried the Emperor, turning to the assembly, "this
  time you were too clever to be men. It is indeed an honour to be called
  Constantine's successor, but it is no honour to be <i>your</i> master! Our
  enemies, I fear, are right; Constantine only planted here the dead mummy of
  Rome, but the soul of Rome had already fled. Alas for the Empire! Were it
  free or a republic, it would now have sunk in shame for ever. It must have a
  master, who, when, like a lazy horse, it threatens to sink into the quagmire,
  pulls it up by the rein; a strong master with bridle, whip, and spurs!"</p>

  <p>At this moment a little crooked man, leaning on a crutch, forced his way
  into the hall, and limped up to the steps of the throne.</p>

  <p>"Emperor of the Romani," he began, when he rose from his obeisance, "a
  report reached me on my bed of pain of all that the barbarians had dared, and
  of what was going on here. I gathered all my strength and dragged myself here
  with difficulty, for, by one word from you, I must learn whether I have been
  a fool from the beginning in holding you to be a great ruler in spite of many
  weaknesses; whether I shall throw your marshal's staff into the deepest well,
  or still carry it with pride! Speak only one word: war or peace?"</p>

  <p>"War! war!" cried Justinian, and his countenance beamed.</p>

  <p>"Victory! Justinian!" cried the general. "Oh, let me kiss your hand, great
  Emperor!" and he limped up the steps of the throne.</p>

  <p>"But how is this, patrician, you have all at once become a man!" mocked
  the Empress. "You were always against the war with the Goths. Have you
  suddenly become endowed with a sense of honour?"</p>

  <p>"Honour!" cried Narses, "after that gay soap-bubble Belisarius, that great
  child, may run! Not honour but the Empire is at stake. As long as danger
  threatened from the east, I advised the Persian war. Nothing was to be feared
  from the Goths. But now your piety, O Empress, and Belisarius's hero-sword,
  have stirred up the hornets' nest so long, that at last the whole swarm flies
  dangerously into our faces. Now the danger threatens from that side, and I
  advise a Gothic war. The Goths are nearer to Byzantium than Chosroes to the
  eastern frontier. He who, like this Totila, can raise a kingdom from an
  abyss, can much more easily hurl another kingdom into an abyss. This young
  King is a worker of miracles, and must be stopped in time."</p>

  <p>"For this once," said Justinian, "I have the rare pleasure of finding my
  Empress and Narses of one mind."</p>

  <p>He was on the point of dismissing the assembly, when the Empress caught
  his arm.</p>

  <p>"Stay, my husband," she said. "To-day, for the second time, I have the
  honour to be proved your best adviser! Is it not so? Then listen to me and
  follow my further advice. Keep this wise assembly&mdash;all except
  Narses&mdash;confined in this hall.&mdash;Do not tremble, Illustrissimi; this
  time your lives are not in jeopardy. But you are unable to keep a secret; at
  least unless your tongues are slit. For this time, we will insure your
  silence by confinement.&mdash;There exists a conspiracy against your life,
  Justinian, or at least against your free will. A certain party had decided to
  force you to a war with the Goths. This object, truly, is now attained. But
  either to-night or to-morrow early the conspirators will again finally
  assemble. We must allow them to do so. We must not hinder them in their
  purpose by letting them know that their object is already planned. For
  dangerous persons&mdash;persons suspected long ago, and&mdash;O
  Justinian&mdash;very very <i>rich</i> persons are concerned in it. It would
  be a pity if they escaped my snare."</p>

  <p>Justinian was not alarmed at the word conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"I also knew of it," he said. "But is it already so far advanced?
  To-morrow! Theodora," he cried, "you are more to the Empire than Belisarius
  or Narses!&mdash;Captain of the Golden Shields, you will keep all present
  confined here until Narses comes to fetch them. Meanwhile, my pious and wise
  fathers, reflect upon this hour and its teachings! Narses, follow us and the
  Empress."</p>

  <p>So saying, Justinian descended the steps of the throne. When he, with
  Theodora and Narses, had left the Hall of Jerusalem, the entrance was
  immediately blocked with threatening spears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-7"
     name="b5b-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">The Emperor ordered the Empress and Narses to follow him to
  his room.</p>

  <p>When they reached it, he embraced his wife with great tenderness,
  unembarrassed by the presence of a witness.</p>

  <p>"How your enthusiasm rejoices and exalts me!" he exclaimed. "I am proud of
  such a wife. How beautiful you were, O Theodora, in your noble indignation.
  How can I reward you! Choose any favour, any sign of my gratitude, my best
  and truest councillor and co-ruler?"</p>

  <p>"If I, a weak woman, dare indeed believe that I may share your thoughts
  and plans in this war, then confide in me, and tell me how you intend to
  conduct it."</p>

  <p>"I am resolved to send Belisarius again to Italy. But not alone. His
  trifling with a crown has made me wary."</p>

  <p>"Then I beg the favour of being allowed to propose a second
  general.&mdash;Narses," she continued, before Justinian could speak, "will
  you be the other?"</p>

  <p>She wished to make it impossible for him to go.</p>

  <p>"No, I thank you," Narses answered bitterly. "You know that I am a
  stubborn and ill-tempered horse; I cannot endure to draw together with
  another. A marshal's staff and a wife, Justinian, should be kept on the same
  condition."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Alone, or not at all."</p>

  <p>"Then <i>you</i> not at all," answered Justinian with vexation. "You must
  not imagine that you are indispensable, magister militum."</p>

  <p>"No one on earth is so, Justinian. With all my heart! Send great
  Belisarius again! He may try his luck for the third time in that country,
  where laurels grow so thickly. My turn will come later. I am no doubt
  unnecessary here as a witness of your domestic felicity, and at home,
  opposite to my sickbed, stands a map of the Italian roads. Allow me to
  continue my study of it. It is more interesting than the map of our Persian
  frontier. One piece of advice. You will ultimately be obliged to send Narses
  to Italy. The sooner you send him the more you will spare yourself defeat,
  vexation, and money. And if gout or that wretched epilepsy should carry
  Narses off before King Totila lies upon his shield, who then will conquer
  Italy for you? You believe in prophecy. In Italy there runs a saying: 'T
  beats B, N beats T.'"</p>

  <p>"Does that mean, perhaps, that Theodora beat Belisarius, and Narses beats
  Theodora?" asked the Empress mockingly.</p>

  <p>"That is not <i>my</i> interpretation of the riddle; it is yours. But I
  accept it. Do you know which was the wisest of your many laws, O
  Justinian?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That which made death the punishment of all accusations against the
  Empress, for it was the only way in which you could keep her." And he left
  the room.</p>

  <p>"The insolent fellow!" cried Theodora, sending a venomous look after him.
  "He dares to threaten! When Belisarius has once been rendered harmless,
  Narses must quickly follow."</p>

  <p>"But meanwhile we need them both," said Justinian. "Do you really propose,
  as the second general to be sent to Italy, the man who persuaded us to reject
  the proposals of Cassiodorus?"</p>

  <p>"The same."</p>

  <p>"But my distrust of that ambitious man has since then become
  stronger."</p>

  <p>"Have you then forgotten," retorted Theodora, "who revealed the intentions
  of Silverius? Who was the first to warn you of Belisarius's dangerous
  game?"</p>

  <p>"But he now frequents the company of the men who are conspiring against
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but, O Justinian, it is by my order, as their destroyer."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! But if he is also deceiving you?"</p>

  <p>"Will you believe him and me, and send him to Italy, if he brings the
  conspirators to your feet in chains to-morrow, and amongst them their unknown
  chief?"</p>

  <p>"I already know who it is; it is Photius, the freedman of Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"No, Justinian; it is he whom you would again send to Italy if I did not
  warn you: Belisarius himself!"</p>

  <p>The Emperor grew pale, and grasped the arm of his chair. "Will you now
  believe in that wonderful Roman's devotion, and send him to Italy with your
  army, instead of Belisarius?"</p>

  <p>"Everything, everything!" said Justinian. "Belisarius, then, is really a
  traitor! Then we must make haste! Let us act at once."</p>

  <p>"I have already acted, Justinian. My net is cast, and no one can escape.
  Give me full power to draw it close."</p>

  <p>The Emperor nodded acquiescence.</p>

  <p>And passing through the curtains, Theodora said to the door-keeper:</p>

  <p>"Fetch Cethegus, the Prefect of Rome, from his house, and take him to my
  room."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-8"
     name="b5b-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Shortly after, Cethegus once more stood before the still
  seductive woman, whom he had known in youth. She was lying stretched upon her
  couch in the room in which we have before seen her.</p>

  <p>Galatea frequently handed to her a small onyx-cup, filled with the drops
  prescribed by her Persian physician. Grecian doctors no longer sufficed.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Theodora," said Cethegus, after a friendly greeting, "and if
  I must thank any other than myself&mdash;and a woman!&mdash;I would rather
  owe something to my early friend than to another."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Prefect," said Theodora, looking gravely at him. "You would be
  just the man&mdash;shall I say the barbarian or the Roman?&mdash;to first
  kiss a Cleopatra whom a Cæsar and an Antony had adored, and then take her in
  triumph to the Capitol in order to strangle her, as, perhaps, Octavianus once
  intended, if that sly Queen had not been beforehand with him. Cleopatra has
  always been my model. 'Tis true, I have never found a Cæsar. But the asp,
  perhaps, will not be wanting. But you need not thank me. I have spoken and
  acted out of conviction. The insolence which we have suffered from these
  Goths must be smothered in blood. Perhaps I have not always been such a
  faithful wife as Justinian believed; but I was always his best and truest
  adviser. Belisarius and Narses cannot be sent together, and still less
  singly, to Italy. You shall go. You are a hero, a general, and a statesman,
  and yet you are too weak to harm Justinian."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for your good opinion," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Friend, you are a general without an army, an Emperor without an empire,
  a pilot without a ship. But enough of this&mdash;you will not believe me. I
  send you to Italy because I believe that you hate the barbarians with all
  your heart. The second general, whom the imperial distrust will undoubtedly
  send after you, shall be Areobindos. He will not trouble you much! I am
  rejoiced that I can thus serve not only my old companion but also the Empire.
  Ah, Cethegus, our youth! To you men it is either golden hopes or golden
  memories: to a woman it is life itself! Oh for a single day of the time when
  I sent you roses and you sent me verses!"</p>

  <p>"Your roses were beautiful, Theodora, but my verses were poor."</p>

  <p>"They were fine to me, for they were addressed to me! My choice of you,
  which is necessary for the Empire, is sweetened by old and new hate as well
  as by old love. Belisarius must not rise to new honours. He must fall, and
  this time fall low and for ever. As sure as I live!"</p>

  <p>"And Narses? I should understand and like it better if you were to ruin
  that head without an arm, than this arm without a head."</p>

  <p>"Patience! One after the other."</p>

  <p>"What has the good-natured hero done to you?"</p>

  <p>"He? Nothing. But his wife! that clumsy Antonina, whose whole triumph lies
  in her good health."</p>

  <p>And the delicate Empress clenched her little white fist, the fingers of
  which had become more transparent than ever.</p>

  <p>"Ah," she exclaimed, "how I hate her! Yes, and I envy her too! Stupid
  people are always healthy. But she shall not rejoice while I suffer!"</p>

  <p>"And the fate of the Capitol depends upon such a woman's hatred!"
  exclaimed Cethegus to himself. "Down with Cleopatra!"</p>

  <p>"The foolish woman is in love with her husband's honour and glory. There I
  can wound her fatally!" continued Theodora.</p>

  <p>As she spoke the twitching of her delicate features betrayed an attack of
  acute pain; she threw herself back upon her cushions.</p>

  <p>"My little dove," said Galatea, "do not be angry. Thou knowest what the
  Persian said. Every excitement, be it of love or of hate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. To hate and to love is life! And as one grows older, hatred is
  almost sweeter than love. Love is false; hate is true."</p>

  <p>"In both," said Cethegus, "I am a novice compared to you. I have always
  called you the Siren of Cyprus. One can never be sure that you will not
  suddenly tear your victim in the very act of embracing him&mdash;either from
  love, or from hate. And what has suddenly changed your love of Antonina into
  hatred?"</p>

  <p>"She has become virtuous, the hypocrite! Or can she be really so
  weak-minded? It is possible. Her fishy blood can never be made to boil. For a
  strong passion or a bold crime she was always too cowardly. She is too vain
  to forego admiration and too paltry to reciprocate it. Since she accompanied
  her husband on his campaign she has become quite virtuous. Ha, ha, ha!
  because she was obliged! Even as the devil fasts when he has nothing to eat.
  Because I kept her lover a prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Anicius, the son of Boëthius? I heard of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he. When in Italy Antonina again clung to her husband and shared his
  fame and his misfortunes. And since that time she is a very Penelope! When
  she returned here, what did the goose do? She reproached me with having
  enticed her from the path of virtue! and swore that she would save Anicius
  from my toils. And she succeeds, the snake! She opens the gates of conscience
  and weans my unfaithful chamberlain more and more from me&mdash;of course
  only to keep him for herself."</p>

  <p>"So you cannot imagine," said Cethegus, "that any woman can try to save a
  soul?"</p>

  <p>"Without profit? No. But at the same time she deceives herself and him by
  pious speeches. And oh! how gladly the youth allows himself to be saved by
  this youthful blooming saint from the arms of the faded woman&mdash;who is
  wasted before her time! Ha!" she added passionately, starting from her seat,
  "how pitiable that the body must succumb from fatigue before the soul has
  half satisfied its thirst for life! And to live is to rule, to hate, and to
  love!"</p>

  <p>"You seem insatiable in these arts and enjoyments."</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried Theodora, "and I am proud of it. Must I indeed leave the
  richly-spread table of existence, must I leave this imperial throne, with all
  my ardent love of joy and power still unquenched? Shall I only sip a few more
  drops? Oh, Nature is a miserable blunderer! Once in many thousand ages she
  creates, amid a host of cripples, ugly in body and weak in mind, a soul and
  body like mine, perfect and strong, and full of the longing to live and to
  enjoy for an eternity. And, when only six lustres have passed, when I have
  scarcely sipped of the full cup offered to me. Nature dries up the spring of
  life! A curse upon the envy of the gods! But men can envy too, and envy
  changes them into demons. Others shall not enjoy when I can do so no longer!
  Others shall no more laugh when I must writhe in agony all night long!
  Antonina shall not rejoice in her youth with the false man who was once mine
  and yet could think of another, or of virtue, or of heaven! Anicius has told
  me this very day that he can bear this life without fame and honour no
  more&mdash;that heaven and earth call him away. He shall repent
  it&mdash;together with her. Come, Cethegus," she said furiously, grasping his
  arm, "come; we will destroy them both!"</p>

  <p>"You forget," said Cethegus coldly, "that I have no reason to hate either
  her or him. So what I do will be done for your sake."</p>

  <p>"Not so, you wise and icy Roman! Do you believe that I do not see through
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not," thought Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"You wish to keep Belisarius away from Italy. You wish to fight and
  conquer alone. Or at most with a shadow beside you, such as Bessas was and
  Areobindos will be. Do you think I did not understand why you so cleverly
  managed the recall of Belisarius when before Ravenna? Anxiety for Justinian!
  What is Justinian to you?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus felt his heart beat.</p>

  <p>"The freedom of Rome!" continued Theodora. "Nonsense! You know that only
  strong and simple men can be trusted with freedom. And you know your
  Quirites. No, your aim lies higher."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that this woman guesses what all my enemies and friends do
  not even suspect?" thought Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"You wish to free Italy alone, and alone rule her as Justinian's
  vice-regent. To be next to his throne, high above Belisarius and Narses, and
  second only to Theodora. And if there were any higher goal, yours would be
  the spirit to fly at it."</p>

  <p>Cethegus breathed again.</p>

  <p>"That would hardly be worth the trouble," he thought.</p>

  <p>"Oh," continued Theodora, "it is a proud feeling to be the first of
  Justinian's servants!"</p>

  <p>"Of course," thought Cethegus, "she is not capable of imagining anything
  superior to her husband, although she deceives him daily."</p>

  <p>"And," Theodora went on, "to rule <i>him</i>, the Emperor, in company with
  me."</p>

  <p>"The flattering atmosphere of this court dulls even the clearest
  intellect," thought Cethegus. "It is the madness of the purple. She can only
  think of herself as all-commanding."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cethegus," continued Theodora; "I would allow no other man even to
  <i>think</i> of this. But I will help you to obtain it. With you I will share
  the mastery of the world. Perhaps only because I remember many a foolish
  youthful dream. Do you still remember how, years ago, we shared two cushions
  in my little villa? We called them the Orient and the Occident. It was an
  omen. So will we now share the Orient and the Occident. Through my Justinian
  I will rule the Orient. Through my Cethegus I will rule the Occident!"</p>

  <p>"Ambitious, insatiable woman!" thought Cethegus. "Oh that Mataswintha had
  not died! She at this court&mdash;and you would sink for ever!"</p>

  <p>"But to gain this," said Theodora, "Belisarius must be got out of the way.
  Justinian had resolved to send him once more as your commander-in-chief to
  Italy."</p>

  <p>Cethegus frowned.</p>

  <p>"He trusts again and again to his dog-like fidelity. He must be thoroughly
  convinced of his falsity."</p>

  <p>"That will be difficult to manage," said Cethegus. "Theodora will sooner
  learn to be faithful than Belisarius to be false."</p>

  <p>A blow from Theodora's little hand was the punishment for this speech.</p>

  <p>"To you, foolishly, I have been ever faithful&mdash;that is, in affection.
  Do you want Belisarius again in Italy?"</p>

  <p>"On no account!"</p>

  <p>"Then help me to ruin him, together with Anicius, the son of
  Boëthius."</p>

  <p>"So be it," said the Prefect. "I have no reason to spare the brother of
  Severinus. But how can you possibly bring proofs against Belisarius? I am
  really curious. If you accomplish <i>that</i>, I will declare myself no less
  a novice in plots and machinations than in love and hatred."</p>

  <p>"And that you are, you dull son of Latium! Now listen. But it is such a
  dangerous subject, that I must beg thee, Galatea, to keep watch that no one
  comes and listens. No, my good mother, not inside! I beg thee; <i>outside</i>
  the door. Leave me alone with the Prefect: it is&mdash;more's the
  pity&mdash;no secret of love?"</p>

  <p>When, after some time, the Prefect left the room, he said to himself:</p>

  <p>"If this woman were a man&mdash;I should kill her! She would be more
  dangerous than the barbarians and Belisarius together! But then, certainly,
  the iniquity would be neither so inscrutable nor so devilish!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-9"
     name="b5b-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after the Prefect had returned home, Syphax announced
  the son of Boëthius, who came from the Empress.</p>

  <p>"'Let him enter, and admit no one else until he has gone," said Cethegus.
  "Meanwhile send quickly for Piso, the tribune."</p>

  <p>And he rose to meet Anicius, who now entered the room.</p>

  <p>Anicius was no longer a youth, and his delicate features were much
  improved by the expression of resolution which at this moment rested upon
  them. He was dressed very simply, and his hair, which was usually curled, now
  hung straight down.</p>

  <p>"You remind me of your beautiful sister, Anicius."</p>

  <p>With these words the Prefect received his visitor.</p>

  <p>"It is on her account, Cethegus, that I come," said Anicius gravely. "You
  are the oldest friend of my father and of our house. You hid Severinus and me
  from our enemies, and assisted us to escape at your own risk. You are the
  only man in Byzantium to whom I can appeal in a mysterious affair. A few days
  ago I received this incomprehensible letter, 'To the son of my patron;
  Corbulo the freedman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Corbulo? I know that name!"</p>

  <p>"He was the freedman of my father, with whom my mother and sister took
  refuge, and who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fell before Rome with your brother!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But he only died after being carried into the Gothic encampment, for
  he was taken prisoner, together with my dying brother, in the village <i>ad
  aras Bacchi</i>. So I am told by one of Belisarius's mercenaries called
  Sutas, who was taken prisoner at the same time, And who has now brought me
  the letter which Corbulo could not finish. Read it for yourself."</p>

  <p>Cethegus took the small wax tablet with its scarcely legible writing and
  read:</p>

  <p>"'The legacy of your dying brother, and his last words were: Anicius must
  revenge our mother, our sister, and myself. It was the same enemy of our
  house, the same demon who&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"The letter ends here," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Corbulo lost his senses and never again became conscious, the
  mercenary said."</p>

  <p>"There is not much to be made of this," observed Cethegus, shrugging his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"No; but the mercenary Sutas&mdash;they were all in the same
  tent&mdash;heard a few words spoken by my dying brother to Corbulo, which may
  give us the key to the letter."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Cethegus, with concealed anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Severinus said: 'I suspect it. He knew of the ambush&mdash;he sent us to
  meet certain death.'"</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked Cethegus quietly.</p>

  <p>"That is just what I want to find out."</p>

  <p>"You have no suspicion?"</p>

  <p>"No; but it cannot be impossible to discover the man who is meant."</p>

  <p>"How will you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"'Sent us to meet certain death,' that can only mean some leader or
  general who was the cause of my brother's sharing that fatal morning ride out
  of the Tiburtinian Gate. For Severinus did not at that time belong to the
  suite of Belisarius. He was a tribune of your legions. If you, Belisarius,
  and Procopius will earnestly try to find out the man who sent Severinus with
  Belisarius, you must succeed. For he did not go with other
  legionaries&mdash;none of your legionaries or horsemen accompanied
  Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"As far as I recollect," said Cethegus, "you are right."</p>

  <p>"Not one," repeated Anicius. "Procopius&mdash;unfortunately he has gone to
  examine the buildings which Justinian has erected in Asia&mdash;was present,
  and has often told me the names of all who were with him. When he returns, I
  will make a careful inquiry of what my brother did just before the sally.
  Into whose house or tent he went&mdash;I will not rest, I will ask all the
  still living comrades of Severinus where they saw him last before he rode
  out."</p>

  <p>"You are very acute for your years," said the Prefect with a strange
  smile. "What will you be when you are arrived at maturity? But certainly you
  are in a good school. Does the Empress know of this letter?"</p>

  <p>"No. And she shall never hear of it. Do not name her to me! This duty of
  revenge has been sent by God to tear me away from her!"</p>

  <p>"But she sent you to me?"</p>

  <p>"In another affair, which, however, shall end very differently to what she
  intends. A few hours ago she sent for me, and asked me once again if it was
  so very terrible to be kept in a golden cage. But the woman disgusts me. And
  I heartily regret the months that I have wasted at her side, while my brother
  fought and fell for the fatherland. I gave her such a rude answer, that I
  expected a storm. But, to my astonishment, she was perfectly quiet, and said,
  smiling, 'Be it so. No faithfulness lasts long. Go to Antonina, or to Virtue,
  or to both goddesses. But, as a last sign of my favour, I will save you from
  certain destruction. There exists in Byzantium a conspiracy against the life
  or free will of Justinian. Be quiet&mdash;I know it. I know also that you are
  already half won; that you have not yet gone to any of their meetings, but
  that you have the documents of the conspiracy in your keeping. I have allowed
  them to do as they liked, because there are some of my old enemies amongst
  them, whom I wish to ruin. In a few days they will be surprised. But I will
  warn and save you. Go to the Prefect. He must take you with him away from
  Byzantium. Tell him that you are in danger, and that Theodora sends you. But
  say nothing to him of the conspiracy. There are some of his tribunes
  concerned in it, whom he would gladly save, but whom I will destroy.' All
  this she said to me, and I came, but not to fly! I came to warn you and my
  Roman comrades. I shall also go to the meeting&mdash;there is no danger for
  to-day, the Empress said&mdash;and warn them all. I shall tell them that the
  conspiracy is discovered. You must not be there, Prefect; you must not place
  yourself in any further danger. Justinian already suspects you. The foolish
  youths wish to wait until they have won Belisarius to their cause! And if
  they are not warned they will most likely be all taken prisoners to-morrow. I
  shall hasten to tell them of their danger. But, that done, I will not rest a
  moment until I have discovered the murderer of my brother."</p>

  <p>"Both intentions are highly praiseworthy," said Cethegus. "But, by the
  way, where do you hide the papers of the conspirators?"</p>

  <p>"Where I hide all secrets," said Anicius, blushing&mdash;"secrets and
  letters that are sacred and dear to me; where I will also hide this tablet.
  You shall know the spot, for you, the oldest friend of my house, must help me
  to complete my task of vengeance. I have written out Sutas's report of the
  scarcely-comprehensible conversation of the two dying men. They spoke of
  'poisoning'&mdash;of 'murderous order'&mdash;of an 'accusation before the
  senate'&mdash;therefore our enemy must be a Roman senator&mdash;of a 'crimson
  crest'-of a 'black devil of a horse&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Et cetera, et cetera," said Cethegus, interrupting him. "Where is your
  hiding-place? It may be that you will have to escape in a hurry&mdash;for I
  strongly advise you not to trust the Empress&mdash;and perhaps you would not
  even be able to reach your house."</p>

  <p>"And besides," added Anicius, "it is necessary that you take up my work. I
  should in any case have told you of the hiding-place. It is in the cistern in
  the court of my house&mdash;the third brick to the right of the wheel is
  hollow. And you must know for another reason," he concluded gloomily. "If it
  is not possible to save my friends, if my own freedom is in danger&mdash;for
  you are right in your warning: I have long since remarked that I am followed
  by the spies of the Emperor or Empress&mdash;then I will quickly make a
  bloody end to it all. What matter if I die, if I cannot fulfil the duty which
  Severinus has imposed upon me? Then&mdash;it is my office to tell the Emperor
  every morning how the Empress has passed the night&mdash;then&mdash;I will
  strike the tyrant in the midst of his slaves!"</p>

  <p>"Madman!" cried Cethegus, in real terror&mdash;for he <i>now</i> wished to
  keep Justinian alive and in power&mdash;"to what has remorse and a planless
  and dissolute life brought you? No! the son of Boëthius must not end as a
  murderer. If you wish to atone in blood for your inglorious past&mdash;then
  fight with my legions! Purify yourself in the blood of the barbarians, shed,
  not by the dagger of the murderer, but by the sword of the hero!"</p>

  <p>"You speak nobly, Cethegus. And will you really place <i>me</i>, untried
  and without fame, amongst your brave knights? How can I thank you!"</p>

  <p>"Spare your thanks until all is ended&mdash;until we meet again. Meanwhile
  warn the conspirators. That alone will be a proof of courage. For, as it
  seems you are followed, I think it a dangerous task. If you shun the danger,
  say so frankly."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> hesitate to give the first proof of my courage! I would go and
  warn them, even if certain death were the consequence."</p>

  <p>He pressed the Prefect's hand, and hurried away.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, Syphax brought in the tribune Piso through another
  door.</p>

  <p>"Master of Iambics," cried Cethegus, "you must now be as quick-footed as
  your verses! Enough of conspiracy and creeping here in Byzantium! You must
  immediately seek all the young Romans who frequent the house of Photius. The
  setting sun must find none of you within those walls. Your lives depend upon
  it. No one must go to the 'evening feast' at Photius's house. Go hunting,
  singly or in groups; make boat-races on the Bosphorus; only hurry away. The
  conspiracy is superfluous. The sound of the trumpet will soon summon you to
  battle against the barbarians in Latium. Away with you all! Wait for me at
  Epidamnus. Thence, with my Isaurians, I will fetch you to the third fight for
  Rome. Away!&mdash;Syphax," he said, when left alone with his slave, "have you
  inquired at the great general's house? When is he expected back?"</p>

  <p>"At sunset."</p>

  <p>"Is his faithful wife at home? Good. Bring a litter&mdash;not
  mine&mdash;bring the first you find at the Hippodrome. The blinds must shut
  closely. Take it to the harbour, into the back street of the
  slop-dealers."</p>

  <p>"Sir, the worst rabble of this city of vagabonds dwell in that street.
  What will you do there?"</p>

  <p>"I will there enter the litter, and then go to the Red House."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-10"
     name="b5b-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">In the Red House, the abode of Belisarius, which was
  situated in the suburb "Justiniana" (Sycæ), sat Antonina in the women's
  chamber, working busily.</p>

  <p>She was embroidering a border of golden laurels upon a mantle for her
  hero, Belisarius.</p>

  <p>Near her, upon a citron-wood table, lay, in a costly binding set with
  precious stones, a splendid edition of the "Vandal Wars," by Procopius, the
  lately published book which described her husband's prowess.</p>

  <p>At her feet lay a magnificent animal, one of the four tame hunting
  leopards which the Persian King had presented to Belisarius after the last
  peace; a very costly present, for it was seldom that the attempt to tame
  these leopards succeeded, and many hundreds of cubs which had been caught or
  born in confinement, were obliged to be killed as useless after being trained
  for years. The large, beautiful, and powerful animal&mdash;it easily became
  wild when it tasted warm blood while hunting, and had therefore been left at
  home stretched itself luxuriously, like a cat, upon the folds of Antonina's
  dress, played with her ball of gold thread, waved its tail, and sometimes
  rubbed its round and clever-looking head against the feet of its
  mistress.</p>

  <p>A slave entered and announced a stranger&mdash;he had arrived in a modest
  litter, and was dressed in a common mantle&mdash;the door-keeper would have
  refused to admit him, as the master was away, and the mistress received no
  visitors, but he would not be denied; he ordered them to announce to Antonina
  "the conqueror of Pope Silverius."</p>

  <p>"Cethegus!" cried Antonina.</p>

  <p>She grew pale and trembled.</p>

  <p>"Let him in at once."</p>

  <p>The influence which the powerful intellect of Cethegus had gained upon her
  the first time of their meeting; the recollection that, when her husband,
  Procopius, and all the leaders of the army, had helplessly succumbed to the
  priest, this man had conquered and humbled the conqueror; of how, at the
  entrance into Rome, the fight on the bridge of the Anio, the defence of Rome
  Against Witichis, in the camp of Ravenna and at the taking of that city, he
  had always and everywhere kept the upper hand, and yet had never used his
  superiority inimically against her husband; how nothing but misfortune had
  followed any neglect of his warnings; how all his counsels had been
  victorious in themselves&mdash;these recollections now confusedly crossed her
  mind.</p>

  <p>She heard the footsteps of the Prefect, and hastily rose.</p>

  <p>The leopard&mdash;pushed roughly aside and disturbed in his comfortable
  sport on account of the intruder&mdash;rose with a low growl, and looked
  threateningly at the door, gnashing his yellow teeth.</p>

  <p>Cethegus, before entering, drew the curtain violently aside and thrust
  forth his head, which was covered by a cowl. The abrupt movement must have
  either frightened or irritated the leopard. When the Persian lion and tiger
  tamers first began to break in a newly-caught animal, they were accustomed to
  envelop themselves and cover their heads with long woollen cloaks. Possibly
  the fierce and never wholly-tamed beast was reminded of his old enemies. With
  a terrible howl he crouched in preparation for a deadly spring, whipping the
  floor with his long tail and foaming at the mouth a sure sign of fury.</p>

  <p>Antonina saw it with horror.</p>

  <p>"Fly! fly, Cethegus!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>Had he done so, had he but turned his back, he would have been lost; the
  monster would at once have been upon his back with his teeth in his neck. For
  no door closed the entrance, the only barrier was a curtain.</p>

  <p>Cethegus promptly stepped forward, threw back his cowl, looked straight
  into the leopard's eyes, raising his left hand with an action of command, and
  threatening him with the dagger held in his right.</p>

  <p>"Down! down! The irons are hot!" he cried in the Persian language, at the
  same time moving a step in advance.</p>

  <p>The leopard suddenly broke into a whining howl of fear; his muscles, which
  had been contracted for the spring, relaxed; he crept whining, with his belly
  on the ground, to the feet of Cethegus, and howling with fear, licked the
  sandal of his left foot, while Cethegus set his right foot firmly upon the
  animal's neck.</p>

  <p>Antonina had sunk upon her couch in her fear; she now stared at the
  terrible, but beautiful scene.</p>

  <p>"That animal&mdash;the prostration!" she stammered. "Dareios always
  refused to do it; he was furious when Belisarius insisted upon it. Where have
  you learned this, Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"In Persia, of course," he answered.</p>

  <p>And he kicked the thoroughly cowed animal between the ribs with such
  violence, that with a howl it flew into the farthest comer of the room, where
  it remained trembling and crouching, with its eyes fixed upon its
  subduer.</p>

  <p>"Belisarius only mastered the forts, but not the language of Persia," said
  Cethegus. "And these beasts do not understand Greek. You are grimly guarded,
  Antonina, when Belisarius is absent," he added, as he hid his dagger in the
  folds of his dress.</p>

  <p>"What brings you to my house?" Antonina asked, still trembling.</p>

  <p>"My often misdoubted friendship. I would save your husband, who has the
  courage of a lion, but not the dexterity of a mouse! Procopius is
  unfortunately absent, or I should have sent that better-trusted adviser, I
  know that a heavy blow threatens Belisarius from the Emperor. We must ward it
  off. The favour of the Emperor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is very fickle, I know. But the services of Belisarius&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are his ruin. Justinian would not fear an insignificant man. But he fears
  Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"That we have often experienced," sighed Antonina.</p>

  <p>"Learn then&mdash;you before all others&mdash;what no one outside the
  palace knows: the Emperor's indecision is at an end. He has decided upon war
  with the Goths."</p>

  <p>"At last!" cried Antonina, with a beaming countenance.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but&mdash;think of the shame! Belisarius is not appointed
  commander-in-chief."</p>

  <p>"Who else?" asked Antonina angrily.</p>

  <p>"I am one of the generals&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it was my aim long since, I confess. But the second in command is to
  be Areobindos. I cannot conquer the Goths with him, hindered by his
  ignorance. No one can conquer the Goths but Belisarius. Therefore I must have
  him near me, or, for aught I care, over me. See, Antonina, I hold myself to
  be the greater statesman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My Belisarius is a hero, no statesman!" cried the proud wife.</p>

  <p>"But it would be ridiculous to compare myself as a general with the
  conqueror of the Vandals, Goths, and Persians. You see that I openly confess
  that I am not influenced only by friendship to Belisarius, but also by
  egotism. I <i>must</i> have Belisarius for a comrade."</p>

  <p>"That is clear," said Antonina, much pleased.</p>

  <p>"But Justinian is not to be persuaded to appoint him. Still more, he again
  suspects him, and indeed more than ever."</p>

  <p>"But, by all the saints! wherefore?"</p>

  <p>"Belisarius is innocent; but he is very imprudent. For months he has
  received secret letters, notes, and warnings&mdash;stuck into his
  bathing-robe, or thrown into his garden&mdash;which invite him to take part
  in a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"Heavens! You know of this?" stammered Antonina.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately not I only, but also others&mdash;the Emperor himself!"</p>

  <p>"But the conspiracy is not against the Emperor's life or throne," said
  Antonina apologetically.</p>

  <p>"No; only against his free will. 'War with the Goths.'&mdash;'Belisarius
  commander-in-chief.'&mdash;'It is shameful to serve an ungrateful
  master.'&mdash;'Force the Emperor to his own advantage.' Such and similar
  things do these papers contain, do they not? Well, Belisarius has certainly
  not accepted; but, imprudently, he did not at once speak of these invitations
  to the Emperor, and this oversight may cost him his head!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, holy saints!" cried Antonina, wringing her hands. "He omitted to do
  so at my request, by my advice. Procopius advised him to tell all to the
  Emperor. But I&mdash;I feared Justinian's mistrust, which might have
  discovered the semblance of guilt in the mere fact that such papers had been
  sent to Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"It was not that alone, I think," said Cethegus cautiously, when he had
  looked round to see if any could hear, "which impelled you to give such
  advice, taken, of course, by Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"What else? What can you mean?" asked Antonina in a low voice.</p>

  <p>But she blushed up to the roots of her hair.</p>

  <p>"You knew that good friends of yours were concerned in the conspiracy; you
  wished first to warn them before the plot was betrayed."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she stammered. "Photius, the freedman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet another," whispered Cethegus, "who, scarcely freed from
  Theodora's gilded prison, would only exchange it for the vaults of the
  Bosphorus."</p>

  <p>Antonina covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"I know all, Antonina&mdash;the slight fault of former days, the good
  resolutions of a later time. But in this case your old inclination has
  ensnared you. Instead of thinking only of Belisarius, you thought also of his
  welfare. And if Belisarius now falls, whose is the guilt?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! be silent! have pity!" cried Antonina.</p>

  <p>"Do not despair," continued Cethegus. "You have still a strong prop, one
  who will be your advocate with the Emperor. Even if banishment be threatened,
  the prayers of your friend Theodora will prevent the worst."</p>

  <p>"The Empress!" cried Antonina, in terror. "Oh, how she will misrepresent!
  She has sworn our undoing!"</p>

  <p>"That is bad," said Cethegus&mdash;"very bad! For the Empress also knows
  of the conspiracy, and of the invitations to Belisarius. And you know that a
  much less crime than that of being invited to join a conspiracy is
  sufficient&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Empress knows of it! Then we are lost! Oh! you who know how to find a
  means of escape when no other eye can see it&mdash;help I save us!"</p>

  <p>And Antonina sank at the Prefect's feet.</p>

  <p>A lamentable howl issued from the corner of the room. The leopard trembled
  with renewed fear. The Prefect cast a rapid glance at his beaten adversary,
  and then gently raised the kneeling woman.</p>

  <p>"Do not despair, Antonina. Yes; there is a way to save
  Belisarius&mdash;but only one."</p>

  <p>"Must he tell <i>now</i> what has happened? As soon as he returns?"</p>

  <p>"For that it is too late; and it would be too little. He would not be
  believed; mere words would not prove that he was in earnest. No; he must
  prove his fidelity by deeds. He must seize all the conspirators together, and
  deliver them into the Emperor's power."</p>

  <p>"How can he seize them all together?"</p>

  <p>"They themselves have invited him. To-night they assemble in the house of
  Photius, his freedman. He must consent to put himself at their head. He must
  go to the meeting, and take them all prisoners. Anicius," he added, "has been
  warned already by the Empress. I have seen him."</p>

  <p>"Alas! But if he must die, it is to save Belisarius. My husband must do as
  you say; I see that it is the only way. And it is a bold and dangerous step;
  it will allure him."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he will sacrifice his freedman?"</p>

  <p>"We have warned the fool again and again. What matters Photius when
  Belisarius is in danger! If ever I have had any power over my husband, I
  shall prevail to-day. Procopius has often advised him to give such a
  brutal&mdash;as he called it&mdash;proof of his fidelity. I will remind him
  of it. You may be sure that he will follow our united counsel."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well. He must be there before midnight. When the watchman on the
  walls calls the hour, I shall break into the hall. And it is better, so that
  Belisarius may be quite safe, that he only enter the meeting when he sees my
  Moor Syphax in the niche before the house behind the statue of Petrus. He may
  also place a few of his guards in front of the house. In case of need, they
  can protect him, and bear witness in his favour. He is not capable of much
  feigning; he must only join the meeting shortly before midnight; thus he will
  have no need to speak. Our guards will wait in the Grove of Constantinus, at
  the back of Photius's house. At midnight&mdash;the trumpet sounds when the
  guard is relieved, and you know that it can be distinctly heard&mdash;we
  shall break in. Belisarius, therefore, need not undertake the dangerous task
  of giving a signal."</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;you will be sure to be there?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not fail. Farewell, Antonina."</p>

  <p>And, suddenly stepping backwards, his face still turned towards the
  leopard, his dagger pointed, he had gained the exit.</p>

  <p>The leopard had waited for this moment; he moved slightly in his corner,
  rising slowly.</p>

  <p>But as he reached the curtain, Cethegus once again raised his dagger and
  threatened him.</p>

  <p>"Down, Dareios! the irons are hot!"</p>

  <p>And he was gone.</p>

  <p>The leopard laid his head upon the mosaic floor and uttered a howl of
  impotent fury.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-11"
     name="b5b-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">The power and glory of Totila were now at their height. His
  happiness was completed by his union with Valeria.</p>

  <p>The betrothal had just taken place in the church of St. Peter, and was
  solemnised by Cassiodorus, assisted by Julius, now a Catholic priest, and
  also by an Arian minister. When Cassiodorus had betrothed the daughter of his
  old friend to the King, and they had exchanged rings, the royal couple were
  led in solemn procession over the Janiculum towards the right bank of the
  river, and across the Theodosian and Valentinian Bridges, which were
  decorated with triumphal arches. Following the course of the river, the
  procession entered a villa situated on an eminence overlooking the river and
  the campagna, and the betrothed couple took their places under a magnificent
  baldachin in the great hall.</p>

  <p>There, before the assembled national army, under the golden shield of the
  King, which was hung upon his spear, the Roman bride stepped into the right
  shoe of her Gothic bridegroom, while he laid his mailed right hand upon her
  head, which was covered with a transparent veil.</p>

  <p>Thus the betrothal was completed according to ecclesiastical, Roman, and
  Germanic custom.</p>

  <p>This ceremony over, Totila and Valeria took their seats at the centre
  table upon the terrace of the villa; Valeria surrounded by noble Roman and
  Gothic women, Totila by the dukes and earls of his army.</p>

  <p>Grecian and Roman flute-players played and sang alternately; Roman dances
  followed the sword-dance of the Gothic youths. Presently, dressed in a long,
  white festive garment, the hem embroidered in gold, and a wreath of laurel
  and oak-leaves upon his head, Adalgoth stood forth in front of the royal
  pair, cast an inquiring look at his teacher in war and song. Earl Teja, who
  sat on the King's right hand, and, to the accompaniment of his harp, sang in
  a clear voice:</p>

  <p>"Hear, all ye people, far and near, Hear, Byzant', to thy dole: The Gothic
  King, good Totila, Thrones on the Capitol/</p>

  <p>"No more is Belisarius' name In Rome with honour decked: Of Orcus, and no
  more of Rome Cethegus is Prefect.</p>

  <p>"Of what leaves shall we weave the crown For good King Totila? Like
  sweetest rose upon his breast Blooms sweet Valeria.</p>

  <p>"Peace, freedom, right, and law protect His shield, his star, his sword:
  <i>Olive</i>, thy peaceful spray now give, Give for the peaceful Lord!</p>

  <p>"Who carried terror and revenge? Who bore the Grecians down? Come,
  <i>laurel</i>, leaf of victory, Make rich my hero's crown!</p>

  <p>"But his victorious strength grew not From Roma's mouldering ground: With
  leaves of young Germanic <i>oak</i> Let his young head be crowned.</p>

  <p>"Hear, all ye people, far and near, Hear, Byzant', to thy dole: The Gothic
  King, young Totila, Thrones on the Capitol."</p>

  <p>A burst of applause rewarded his song, during which a Roman youth and a
  Gothic maiden, kneeling before Totila and Valeria, offered each a crown of
  roses, laurels, olive-leaves and oak-leaves.</p>

  <p>"<i>Our</i> songs are also not quite without sweetness, Valeria," said
  Totila with a smile, "and not without strength and truth. I owe my life to
  this youthful minstrel." And he laid his hand upon Adalgoth's head. "He
  struck thy countryman Piso, his colleague in the art of song, most roughly
  upon his clever scanning fingers&mdash;as a punishment for having written
  many a verse to my Valeria and raised the deadly steel against me with one
  and the same hand!"</p>

  <p>"There is one thing that I would rather have heard, my Adalgoth," Teja
  said to the boy in a low voice, "than your song of praise."</p>

  <p>"What is that, my Earl of harp and sword?"</p>

  <p>"The death-cry of the Prefect, whom thou hast only sent to hell in thy
  verse."</p>

  <p>But Adalgoth was called away down the steps by a crowd of Gothic warriors,
  who would not part with him for a long time; for his song pleased the Gothic
  heroes who had fought with Totila much better than it will perhaps please
  you, my reader.</p>

  <p>Duke Guntharis embraced and kissed Adalgoth and said, as he drew him
  aside:</p>

  <p>"My young hero! What a resemblance! Whenever I see thee my first thought
  is: Alaric!"</p>

  <p>"Why, that is my battle-cry!" said Adalgoth, and, engaged in conversation,
  they disappeared amid the crowd.</p>

  <p>At the same time the King looked back at the vestibule of the villa, for
  the performance of the flute-players stationed there was suddenly
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>He quickly perceived the cause and started from his seat with a cry of
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>For between the two centre and flower-wreathed columns of the entrance
  stood a form which seemed scarcely human. A maiden of wondrous beauty, clad
  in a pure white garment, holding a staff in her hand, and with a wreath of
  star-like flowers upon her head.</p>

  <p>"Ah! what is that? Lives this charming figure?" the King asked.</p>

  <p>And all the guests followed the direction of the King's eyes and the
  movement of his hand with equal wonder, for the small opening left between
  the pillars by the masses of flowers was filled up by a more lovely form than
  their eyes had ever beheld.</p>

  <p>The child, or girl, had fastened her shining white linen tunic upon her
  left shoulder with a large sapphire clasp; her broad golden girdle was set
  with a row of sapphires. The long and pointed sleeves of her dress fell from
  her shoulders like two white wings. Wreaths of ivy were twined about her
  whole figure; in her right hand, which rested on her bosom, she held a
  shepherd's staff, wreathed with flowers; her left hand carried a beautiful
  crown of wild-flowers and was laid upon the head of a large shaggy dog, whose
  neck was likewise surrounded with a wreath.</p>

  <p>The girl looked without fear, but thoughtfully and examiningly, at the
  brilliant assembly. For a while the guests stared and waited, and the maiden
  stood motionless. Then the King left his seat, went towards her, and said
  with a smile:</p>

  <p>"Welcome to our feast, if thou art an earthly being. But if&mdash;which I
  almost believe&mdash;thou art the lovely Queen of the Elves&mdash;why then,
  be welcome too! We will place a throne for thee high above the King's seat."
  And with a graceful action he opened both his arms, inviting her to
  approach.</p>

  <p>With a light and gentle step the maiden crossed the threshold of the
  vestibule and, blushing, replied:</p>

  <p>"What sweet folly speakest thou, O King! I am no queen. I am Gotho, the
  shepherdess. But thou&mdash;I see it more by thy clear brow than by thy
  diadem&mdash;thou art Totila, the King of the Goths, whom they call the 'King
  of joy.' I have brought flowers for thee and thy lovely bride. I heard that
  this feast was to celebrate a betrothal. Gotho has nothing else to give. I
  plucked and twined these flowers as I came through the last meadow. And now,
  O King, protector of the orphan's right, hear and help me!"</p>

  <p>The King again took his place near Valeria. The maiden stood between them.
  Valeria took one of her hands; the King laid his hand upon her head, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"I swear to protect thee and thy rights by thine own lovely head. Who art
  thou, and what is thy desire?"</p>

  <p>"Sire, I am the grand-child and child of peasants. I have grown up in
  solitude amid the flowers of the Iffinger mountain. I had nothing dear to me
  on earth except my brother. He left me to seek thee. And when my grandfather
  felt that he was dying, he sent me to thee to find my brother and the
  solution of my fate. And he gave me old Hunibad from Teriolis as a companion
  and protector. But Hunibad's wounds were not fully healed and soon re-opened,
  and he was obliged to stay sick at Verona. And I had to nurse him for a long
  time, until at last he died too. And then I went alone, accompanied only by
  my faithful dog Brun, across all this wide hot country, until at last I found
  the city of Rome and thee. But thou keepest good order, O King, in thy
  land&mdash;thou deservest all praise. Thy high-roads are watched day and
  night by soldiers and horsemen. And they were friendly and good to the lonely
  wandering child. They sent me to the houses of good Goths at nightfall, where
  the housewife cherished me. And it is said that the law is so well obeyed in
  thy realm, that a golden bracelet might be laid upon the high-road, and would
  be found again after many many nights. In one town, Mantua, I think it was
  called, just as I was crossing the market-place, there was a great press, and
  the people ran together. And thy soldiers led forth a Roman to die there, and
  cried: 'Marcus Massurius must die the death, at the King's command. The King
  set him, a prisoner of war, free, and the insolent Roman ravished a Jewish
  girl. Sang Totila has renewed the law of the great Theodoric.' And they
  struck off his head in the open market-place, and all the people were
  terrified at King Totila's justice. Now, my faithful Brun, thou mayest rest
  here; here no one will hurt thee. I have even ornamented <i>his</i> neck with
  flowers to-day, in honour of thee and thy bride."</p>

  <p>She slightly struck the powerful dog on the head; he immediately went up
  to the King's throne, and laid his left fore-foot confidingly upon the King's
  knee. And the King gave him water to drink out of a flat, golden dish.</p>

  <p>"For golden fidelity a golden dish," he said. "But who is thy
  brother?"</p>

  <p>"Well," the girl answered thoughtfully, "from what Hunibad told me during
  the journey and upon his sick-bed, I think that the name my brother bears is
  not his real one. But he is easy to be known," she added, blushing. "His
  locks are golden-brown; his eyes are blue as these shining stones; his voice
  is as clear as the note of the lark; and when he plays his harp, he looks up
  as if he saw the heavens open."</p>

  <p>"Adalgoth!" cried the King.</p>

  <p>"Adalgoth!" repeated all the guests.</p>

  <p>The boy&mdash;he had heard the loud shout of his name&mdash;flew up the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"My Gotho!" he exclaimed in a jubilant voice, and locked her in a tender
  embrace.</p>

  <p>"Those two belong to each other," said Duke Guntharis, who had followed
  the youth.</p>

  <p>"Like the dawn and the rising sun," added Teja.</p>

  <p>"But now," said the girl, as she quietly withdrew from Adalgoth's arms,
  "let me fulfil my errand and the behest of my dying grandfather. Here, O
  King, take this roll and read it. In it is contained the fate of Adalgoth and
  Gotho; the past and the present, said our grandfather."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-12"
     name="b5b-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">The King broke the seals and read:</p>

  <p>"'This is written by Hildegisel, the son of Hildemuth, whom they call "the
  long;" once priest, now castellan at Teriolis. Written at the dictation of
  old Iffa; and it is all written down faithfully. Lo!&mdash;now it begins! The
  Latin is not always as good as that sung in the churches. But thou, O King,
  wilt understand it. For where it is bad Latin it is good Gothic.
  Lo!&mdash;now it really begins. Thus speaks the old man Iffa: My Lord and
  King Totila; the roll which is wrapped in this cover is the writing of the
  man Wargs, who, however, was neither my son, nor was his name Wargs&mdash;but
  his name was Alaric, and he was a Balthe, the banished Duke
  of&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>A ay of astonishment from all present interrupted the King. He paused. But
  Duke Guntharis cried:</p>

  <p>"Then Adalgoth, who calls himself the son of Wargs, is the son of Alaric!
  whom he himself, in his office of herald, has often, riding through the town
  on a white horse, loudly summoned to appear. And never saw I a greater
  resemblance than that between the father Alaric and the son Adalgoth."</p>

  <p>"Hail to the Duke of Apulia!" cried Totila, with a smile, as he embraced
  the boy.</p>

  <p>But, speechless with excitement, Gotho sank upon her knees, her eyes
  filled with tears, and, looking up at Adalgoth, she sighed:</p>

  <p>"Then thou art not my brother! O God!&mdash;Hail, Duke of Apulia!
  Farewell! farewell for ever!" and she rose to her feet and turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Not my sister!" cried Adalgoth. "That is the best thing which this
  dukedom brings me! Stop there!" and he caught Gotho in his arms, pressed her
  to his bosom, and kissed her heartily. Then he led her up to the King,
  saying, "Now, King Totila, unite us! Here is my bride&mdash;here is my
  duchess!"</p>

  <p>And Totila, who had meanwhile cast a rapid glance over the two documents,
  answered smiling:</p>

  <p>"In this case I do not need the wisdom of Solomon. Young Duke of Apulia,
  thus I betroth thee to thy bride." And he laid the laughing, weeping girl in
  Adalgoth's arms.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the assembled Goths, and said:</p>

  <p>"Permit me shortly to explain to you what this writing&mdash;the Latin of
  which is rather rude, for Hildegisel was cleverer with the sword than the
  pen&mdash;contains. Here is, besides, Duke Alaric's declaration of his
  innocence."</p>

  <p>"That has already been proved by his son," cried Duke Guntharis. "And I
  never believed in his guilt."</p>

  <p>"Duke Alaric," continued the King, "discovered his secret accuser too
  late. Our Adalgoth, as you know, brought his innocence to light, when he
  found the hidden documents in the broken statue of Cæsar. Cethegus the
  Prefect had kept a sort of diary in a secret cypher. But Cassiodorus, with
  grief and amazement, deciphered the writing, and found an entry at the
  commencement of the book, written about twelve years ago, which ran thus:
  'Duke Alaric condemned. That he was innocent, is now only believed by himself
  and his accuser. He who injures Cethegus shall not live. At the time when I
  woke from a death-like swoon on the banks of the Tiber, I swore to be
  revenged. I made a vow and it is now fulfilled.' The cause of this hatred is
  still a secret. But it is connected in some way with our friend Julius
  Montanus. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He has already returned to St. Peter's with Cassiodorus," answered Earl
  Teja; "excuse them. Every day at this hour they pray for peace with
  Byzantium. And Julius," he added with a bitter smile, "prays also for the
  Prefect's soul."</p>

  <p>"King Theodoric," said the King, "was hardly to be persuaded of the guilt
  of the brave duke, with whom he was on terms of intimate friendship."</p>

  <p>"Yes," observed Duke Guntharis, "he once gave him a broad gold bracelet
  with a runic device."</p>

  <p>The King now resumed his reading of the papers:</p>

  <p>"'I took a bracelet given me by King Theodoric'&mdash;these are the words
  of the duke&mdash;'when I fled with my child. Broken in two just in the
  centre of the runic inscription. It will one day serve to prove the
  honourable birth of my son.'"</p>

  <p>"He bears the proof on his face," cried Duke Guntharis.</p>

  <p>"But the golden proof is also not wanting!" exclaimed Adalgoth: "at least
  old Iffa gave me a broken bracelet. Here it is," and he took out the half of
  a broken bracelet, which he carried tied to a ribbon round his neck; "I have
  never been able to explain the sense of these words:</p>

  <p>"'The Amelung&mdash; The eagle&mdash; In need&mdash; The
  friend&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Thou hast not the other half," said Gotho, and took the second half of
  the bracelet from her bosom. "See, here is written:</p>

  <p>"'&mdash;to the Balthe, &mdash;to the falcon, &mdash;and death, &mdash;to
  the friend.'"</p>

  <p>And now Teja, holding the two halves together, read:</p>

  <p>"'The Amelung to the Balthe, The eagle to the falcon, In need and death,
  The friend to the friend.'"</p>

  <p>But the King continued to read from the roll:</p>

  <p>"'King Theodoric could no longer protect me when letters were laid before
  him, in which my handwriting was so excellently imitated that I myself, on
  being shown a harmless sentence which had been cut out, acknowledged without
  hesitation that I had written it. Then the judges fitted the piece into the
  parchment and read the whole to me. That letter purported to be written to
  the court of Byzantium, with the promise that the writer would murder the
  King and evacuate South Italy, if the Emperor would acknowledge him as King
  of North Italy. And the judges condemned me. As I was led away from the hall,
  I met my old friend Cethegus Cæsarius in the passage. I had some time before
  succeeded in persuading a girl with whom he was in love to leave him and
  marry a good friend of mine in Gaul. Cethegus forced his way through my
  guards, struck me lightly on the shoulder and said, "He from whom his love
  has been torn, comforts himself with revenge;" and his eyes told me that he,
  and no other, had been my secret accuser. As a last favour, the King procured
  me the means of escape. But I and all my house were outlawed. For a long time
  I wandered restlessly in the northern mountains, until I recollected that
  some old and faithful adherents of my house were settled upon the Iffinger
  mountain. Thither I went with my boy, taking with me a few hereditary jewels,
  and my faithful friends received me and my son, and hid me under the name of
  Wargs&mdash;the banished&mdash;and gave out that I was the son of old Iffa,
  sending away all untrustworthy servants who might have betrayed me. Thus I
  lived in secret for some years. I educate my son to be my avenger on Cethegus
  the traitor, and when I die, old Iffa will continue this education. I hope
  the day will come when my innocence will be proved. But if it delays too
  long, my son, when he can wield the sword, shall leave the Iffinger and go to
  Italy, and revenge his father upon Cethegus Cæsarius. That is my last word to
  my son.'&mdash;'But,'" the King now read from a second paper, "'soon after
  the Duke had written this, a great landslip buried him, together with some of
  my relations. And I, Iffa, have brought up the boy as my grandchild and
  Gotho's brother, for the ban had not been taken off the family of Duke
  Alaric, and I did not wish to expose the boy to the revenge of that devil,
  Cethegus. And that it might not be possible for the boy to betray anything
  about his dangerous parentage, I never told him of it. But when he was grown
  up, and I heard that there reigned in the Roman citadel a mild and just King,
  who had conquered the devilish Prefect as the God of Morning conquers the
  Giant of the Night, I sent young Adalgoth away, and told him that, according
  to his father's command, he must revenge the noble chief and patron of our
  family upon Cethegus the traitor. But I did not even then tell him that he
  was Alaric's son, for I feared the ban. So long as his father's innocence was
  unproved, his father's name could only injure him. And I sent him away in
  great haste, for I discovered that the belief in his brotherly relation to my
  grandchild, Gotho, had not prevented him from loving her in a very
  unbrotherly manner. I might have told him that Gotho was not his sister. But
  far be it from me that I should dishonestly try to unite the noble scion of
  my old master and patron with my blood, the simple shepherd's child. No, if
  justice still exists upon earth, he will soon take his place as Duke of
  Apulia, like his father before him. And as I fear that I may die before he
  sends me word of the Prefect's ruin, I have begged the long Hildegisel to
  write all this down.' (And I, Hildegisel, have received for the writing
  twenty pounds of the best cheese, and twelve jars of honey, which I
  thankfully acknowledge, and all of which was good.) 'And with, these
  writings, and with the blue stones and fine garments and golden solidi from
  the inheritance of the Balthes, I send my child Gotho to King Totila the
  Just, to whom she must reveal everything. He will take the ban away from the
  innocent son of the guiltless duke. And when Adalgoth knows that he is the
  heir of the Balthes, and that Gotho is not his sister&mdash;then he may
  freely choose or shun the shepherdess; but this he must know, that the race
  of the Iffingers was never a race of vassals, but free from the very
  beginning, although under the protection of the House of Balthe.</p>

  <p>"'And now. King Totila, decide the fate of my grandchild and
  Adalgoth.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-13"
     name="b5b-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">"Well," laughed the King, "thou hast spared me the trouble,
  Duke of Apulia!"</p>

  <p>"And the little duchess," added Valeria, "has, as if she had foreseen what
  was coming, already adorned herself like a bride."</p>

  <p>"In honour of <i>you</i>," said the shepherdess. "When I heard of this
  feast as I entered the gates of Roma, I opened my bundle, as my grandfather
  had bidden me, and put on my ornaments."</p>

  <p>"Our betrothal," said Adalgoth to his bride, "has fallen upon the day of
  the King's betrothal; shall our wedding take place also on the wedding-day of
  the royal pair?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" interrupted Valeria hastily, almost anxiously. "Add no other to
  a vow which is yet unfulfilled! You children of Fortune, be wise. You have
  to-day found each other. Keep to-day fast, for to-morrow belongs to the
  unknown!"</p>

  <p>"Thou speakest truth!" cried Adalgoth. "Even today shall be our wedding!"
  and he lifted Gotho upon his left arm, and showed her to all the people.
  "Look here, ye good Goths! This is my little wife and duchess!"</p>

  <p>"With your favour!" said a modest voice. "When so much sunshine falls upon
  the summits and heights of the nation, the lower vegetation would also gladly
  share some of its warmth."</p>

  <p>A homely-looking man approached the King, leading a pretty girl by the
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Is it thou, brave Wachis?" cried Earl Teja, going up to him. "And no
  longer a bond-servant, but with the long hair of a freedman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. My poor master. King Witichis, gave me my liberty when he sent
  me away with Mistress Rauthgundis and Wallada. Since then I have let my hair
  grow. And my mistress&mdash;I know it for a fact&mdash;was about to free
  Liuta, so that we might be married according to the law of the nation; but,
  alas, my mistress never returned to her home at Fæsulæ. But I returned just
  at the right moment to save Liuta, for the very next day the Saracens burnt
  the house and murdered all whom they found. After Mistress Rauthgundis's
  death&mdash;leaving no one to claim the inheritance, for a storm had buried
  her father Athalwin under an avalanche&mdash;Liuta became the King's
  property; and therefore I would beg the King to take me again as a
  bond-servant, so that we may not be punished if we marry,
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wachis, thou art indeed faithful!" cried Totila, interrupting him. "No!
  thou shalt contract a free marriage! Give me a gold-piece."</p>

  <p>"Here, King Totila," said Gotho, eagerly taking one from her shepherd's
  bag; "it is the last of six."</p>

  <p>The King took the gold, laid it upon Liuta's open palm, and then struck
  her hand from below, so that the gold-piece flew up into the air, and fell
  ringing upon the mosaic pavement.</p>

  <p>Then the King said:</p>

  <p>"Liuta, thou art free! No bonds hold thee. Go in peace and rejoice with
  thy bridegroom."</p>

  <p>Earl Teja now came forward and said:</p>

  <p>"Wachis, once before thou hast borne the shield of a luckless master. Wilt
  thou now become my shield-bearer?"</p>

  <p>With tears in his eyes, Wachis clasped the hand of the Earl in both his
  own.</p>

  <p>And now Teja lifted his golden goblet and solemnly said:</p>

  <p>"Fortune befall you! Already shines on you The shimmering sunshine: Yet
  thankfully think Of the Dear and the Dead With reverent remembrance! He who
  strove unsuccessful, The world-renowned warrior: Witichis, Waltharis'
  worthiest son! Though you celebrate cheerily The feast of the fairest, The
  Deity's darlings, Yet honour for ever The memory mournful Of the Great and
  the Good! I remind you, O revellers, To drink to the dear ones; To the
  manliest man, And the worthiest woman; To Rauthgundis and Witichis,
  Deploring, I drink!"</p>

  <p>And all solemnly and silently returned his pledge.</p>

  <p>Then King Totila once more raised his cup and said before all the
  people:</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> deserved! <i>I</i> received! To him be eternal honour!"</p>

  <p>As he resumed his place&mdash;the other two betrothed couples had been
  seated at the King's table&mdash;Earl Thorismuth, of Thurii (he had been
  rewarded for his valour by the title of Earl, but, at his own request, had
  retained his office of herald and shield-hearer), ascended the steps, and
  lowered his herald's staff before the King, saying:</p>

  <p>"I come to announce strangers, O King of the Goths! Guests who have sailed
  here from afar. The large fleet, of about a hundred ships, which was reported
  by thy coast-guards and from the harbour-towns, has now run into the harbour
  of Portus. It has brought northern people, an old, brave, and seafaring folk,
  from the land of farthest Thule. Their dragon-ships have lofty decks, and
  their monstrous figure-heads terrify the beholder. But they come to thee in
  peace. Yesterday the flag-ship lowered its boats, and our noble guests have
  sailed up the river. I challenged them, and received the answer: 'King Harald
  of Goetaland, and Haralda (his wife, as it seems), wish to greet King
  Totila.'"</p>

  <p>"Lead them to us! Duke Guntharis, Duke Adalgoth. Earl Teja, Earl Wisand,
  and Earl Grippa, go to meet and accompany them here."</p>

  <p>Presently, to the sound of strange and twisted horns made of shells, and
  surrounded by twenty of their sailors and heroes clad in close coats of mail,
  there appeared on the terrace two figures which far overtopped even the
  slender Totila and his table companions.</p>

  <p>King Harald bore upon his helmet the two wings&mdash;each several feet
  long&mdash;of the black sea-eagle. The tail-feathers of the same bird floated
  from his iron crest. Down his back fell the skin of a monstrous black bear,
  the jaws and fore-paws of which hung from broad iron rings upon his
  breast-plate. His coat, woven of iron wire, reached to the knee, and was
  confined round the hips by a broad belt of seal-skin, set with shells. His
  arms and legs were bare, but at once adorned and protected by broad golden
  bracelets. A short knife hung from a steel chain at his belt. In his right
  hand he carried a long forked spear like a harpoon. His thick, bright yellow
  hair fell like a mane low down upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>At his left hand stood&mdash;scarcely shorter by a finger's
  length&mdash;the Walkyre-like form of his female companion.</p>

  <p>Upon her head she wore a golden open helmet, decorated with the small
  wings of the silver-gull. Her bright red hair, which had a metallic lustre,
  fell from beneath it in a long straight mass over the small strip of white
  bearskin which covered her back&mdash;more an ornament than a
  mantle&mdash;almost to her ankles.</p>

  <p>A closely-fitting mail, made of little scales of gold, betrayed the
  incomparable figure of the Amazon, yielding to every movement of her heaving
  bosom. Her under garment, which reached half-way between the knee and ankle,
  was tastefully made of the white skin of the snow-hare. Her arms were covered
  by sleeves made of rows of amber beads, which glittered strangely in the
  evening rays of the southern sunshine.</p>

  <p>Upon her left shoulder was gravely perched one of the delicate white
  falcons of Iceland.</p>

  <p>A small hatchet was stuck into her girdle. She carried over her shoulder a
  long sweeping harp, surmounted with a swan's head and neck of silver.</p>

  <p>The Roman populace&mdash;their eyes opened wide in wonder&mdash;pressed
  after these singular figures, and even the Goths could not but admire the
  wondrously fair complexion and the singularly light and sparkling eyes of
  these northerners.</p>

  <p>"As the black hero who received me," began the Viking, "assures me that he
  is not the King, then no other can be he but thou," and he gave his hand to
  Totila, first pulling off his fighting-glove of shark's skin.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to the Tiber, my cousins from Thuleland!" cried Totila, as he
  raised his cup and pledged his guests.</p>

  <p>Seats were quickly prepared, and the royal visitors took their places at
  the King's table; their followers at the table near them. Adalgoth poured out
  wine from tall, two-handled jugs.</p>

  <p>King Harald drank, and looked wonderingly around.</p>

  <p>"By Asathor!" he cried; "but it is beautiful here!"</p>

  <p>"Such I imagine Walhalla to be!" said his companion.</p>

  <p>The Goths and the northerners could scarcely understand each other.</p>

  <p>"If it pleases thee so well, brother," Totila slowly said, "then rest
  amongst us with thy wife for some time."</p>

  <p>"Ho-ho! Rome-King!" laughed the giantess, and tossed back her head so
  suddenly, that the waves of her red hair shook.</p>

  <p>The falcon flew screaming up, and circled round her head three times. It
  then quietly returned to her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The man has not yet been born," continued the Amazon, "who could conquer
  Haralda's heart and hand. Harald alone, my brother, can bend my arm, and
  spring and hurl his spear farther than I."</p>

  <p>"Patience, my little sister! I trust that soon a man of marrow will master
  thy coy maidenhood. This King here, although he looks as mild as Baldur, yet
  resembles Sigurd, the vanquisher of Fafner. You shall vie with each other in
  hurling the spear."</p>

  <p>Haralda cast a long look at the Gothic King, blushed, and pressed a kiss
  upon her falcon's smooth head.</p>

  <p>But Totila said:</p>

  <p>"Evil befell, as the singers tell us, when Sigurd strove with the Amazon.
  Rather let woman greet woman in peace. Give thy hand, Haralda, to my
  bride."</p>

  <p>And he signed to Valeria, to whom Duke Guntharis had very imperfectly
  translated what was said.</p>

  <p>Valeria rose with graceful dignity. She wore a long white Roman-Grecian
  garment, which hung in soft folds, and was confined at the waist by a golden
  girdle, and upon the shoulder with a cameo brooch. Bound her nobly-shaped
  head was bound a branch of laurel, which Totila had taken from Adalgoth's
  wreath to fasten into her black hair. Her beauty, and the rhythm of her
  movements and the folds of her garments, seemed to float around her like
  music. She silently held out her hand to her northern sister.</p>

  <p>Haralda had cast a sharp and not very friendly look upon the Roman girl;
  but admiration soon dispelled the angry surprise which had overspread her
  countenance, and she said:</p>

  <p>"By Freia's necklace! thou art the most lovely woman I have ever beheld. I
  doubt whether a Wish-girl of Walhalla could compare with thee. Dost thou
  know, Harald, whom this Princess resembles? Ten nights ago we laid waste an
  island in the blue Grecian sea, and plundered a columned temple. There stood
  a tall, icy-cold woman, made of white stone; upon her breast was the figure
  of a head surrounded with snakes; at her feet the night-bird; she was clad in
  a garment of many folds. Swen unfortunately broke her to pieces because of
  the jewels in her eyes. The King's bride resembles that marble goddess."</p>

  <p>"I must translate what she has said to thee," said Totila, turning to
  Valeria with a smile. "Thy poetical adorer, Pisa, could not have flattered
  thee more delicately than this Bellona of the north. They landed, so we were
  told, at Melos, and there broke the beautiful statue of Athene, sculptured by
  Phidias. You have made great desolation, I hear," he continued, turning to
  Harald, "in all the islands between Cos, Chios, and Melos. What, then, has
  led you so peacefully to us?"</p>

  <p>"That I will tell thee, brother; but only after more drink." And he held
  out his cup to Adalgoth. "No, do not spoil the splendid juice with water!
  Water should be salt, so that no one could drink it unless he were a shark or
  a walrus. Water is good to carry us upon its back, but not to be carried in
  our stomachs. And this vine-beer of yours is a wonderful drink. I am soon
  tired of our mead; it is like a tame sweet dish. But this vine-mead! the more
  a man drinks, the thirstier he becomes. And if one drank too much&mdash;which
  is scarcely possible&mdash;it is not like the intoxication of ale or mead,
  which makes a man ready to pray to Asathor to hammer an iron ring round his
  temples. No; the intoxication of the vine is like the sweet madness of the
  Skalds&mdash;a man feels like a god! So much for the vine! But now I will
  tell thee how it was that we came here."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-14"
     name="b5b-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">"Well," began King Harald, "our home is in Thuleland, as the
  Skalds call it; in Goetaland, as we name it. For Thuleland is the land where
  one does <i>not</i> dwell; where only, still nearer to the ice-mountains,
  <i>other</i> people live. Our realm reaches, towards the rising of the sun,
  to the sea and our island, Gothland; towards the setting of the sun, as far
  as Hallin and the Skioldungahaff; towards midday, to Smaland, Skone, and the
  kingdom of the Sea-Danes; towards midnight, to Svealand. The King is my
  father, Frode, whom Odin loves. He is much wiser than I; but he has now
  crowned me as Vi-king, upon the sacred-stone at King-Sala, because he is
  already a hundred years old, and quite blind. Now the minstrels in our halls
  still sing the legends which tell that you Goths were originally our
  brothers, and that only by reason of the wandering of the peoples have you
  gradually drawn nearer to the south; for you followed the flight of the crane
  from the Caucasus, but we the running of the wolf."</p>

  <p>"If that be so," said King Totila, smiling, "I prefer the crane for a
  guide."</p>

  <p>"It may well seem so to thee, sitting here in this gay drinking-hall,"
  answered King Harald gravely. "But however that maybe&mdash;and I do not
  quite believe it, for then we ought to understand each other's words
  better&mdash;we truly and highly honour this our blood-relationship. For a
  long time nothing but good news came from your warm realm to our cold
  Gothaland&mdash;news of the highest fame. And once my father and your King
  Thidrekr,[1] who is praised by the harp-songs of our Skalds, exchanged envoys
  and gifts, through the agency of the Esthes, who live on the Austrway. These
  men led our envoys to the Wends, on the Wyzla; these to the Longobardians, on
  the Tisia; these to the Herulians, on the Dravus; these through Savia to
  Salona and Ravenna."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1: Theodoric.]</p>

  <p>"Thou art a man learned in roads and countries," observed Totila.</p>

  <p>"That the Viking must be; for else he will never go forwards, and likewise
  never get back. Well, for some time we only heard of your glory and good
  fortune. But once and again there came bad news, brought by merchants who
  bought our furs and eiderdown and amber, and took it to the Frisians, and
  Saxons, and franks, giving us in exchange artfully-formed vessels, and silver
  and gold. The news became sadder and more sad; we heard that King Thidrekr
  had died, and that afterwards great evils had broken out in your realm. We
  heard of defeat, treachery, and of the murder of Kings; of Goths warring
  against Goths; and of the might of the false Prince of Grêkaland. And it was
  said that you had broken your heads by thousands against the high walls of
  your own Roman citadel, which was held not by you, but by a man like Asathor,
  and another man still worse than the fire-fiend Loki. And we asked if none of
  the many Kings and Princes who had begged favours of Thidrekr of Raven could
  have helped you. But at that the Frank merchant, who offered us fine tissues
  from the Wahala, laughed and said, 'Broken fortunes, broken faith! They have
  all forsaken the luckless Gothic heroes, Visigoths and Burgundians, Herulians
  and Thuringians, and most of all we Franks, for we are wiser than all.' But,
  on hearing this. King Frode threw down his staff angrily, and cried, 'Where
  is my strong son Harald?" 'Here, father,' I answered, and took his hand.
  'Hast thou heard,' my father continued, 'the news of the faithlessness of the
  Southland Kings? Such things shall not be said or sung of the men of
  Goetaland! If all others turn away from the Goths of Gardarike and Raven, we
  will keep faith and help them in their need. Up, my brave Harald, and thou,
  my bold Haralda! equip a hundred dragon-ships, and fill them with men and
  weapons. Put your hands deeply into my royal treasure at Kinsala, and do not
  spare the heaped-up golden rings. And set forth with Odin's wind in your
  sails. Go first from Konghalla, past the island Danes and the Jutlanders,
  towards the setting of the sun; thence along the coasts of the Frisians and
  the Franks, through the narrow path of the sea; then sail farther round the
  realm of the Sueves to the mountain land that is called Asturia; and round
  the land of the Visigoths bend towards the south. Then wind through the
  narrow strait of the wide ocean, where Asathor and Odin have set two
  pillars.</p>

  <p>"You will then have entered the sea of Midilgard, where lie innumerable
  islands covered with evergreen bushes, out of which shine marble halls,
  upheld by high, round stone-beams. Lay waste these islands, for they belong
  to the false Prince of Grêkaland. And then sail to the Roman citadel or to
  Raven, and help the people of King Thidrekr against their enemies. And fight
  for them by land and water, and stand by them until all their enemies are
  overcome. And then speak to them and say: Thus advises King Frode, who will
  soon have seen a hundred winters, and who has seen the rise and fall of many
  peoples, and who, as a young Viking, has himself visited the Southland. This
  is his advice: 'Leave the Southland, however beautiful it may be. You cannot
  endure therein. As little as the iceberg can endure when it drifts into the
  southern sea. The sun, air, and waves consume it continually, and be it ever
  so mighty, it must melt away and leave not a trace behind. It is better to
  live in the poor Northland than to die in the rich Southland. Go on board our
  dragon-ships, and equip your own, and fill them with all your people; men,
  women, and children; and with your oxen and horses, and weapons and
  treasures; and leave the hot ground that will surely swallow you up, and come
  away to us. We will press closely together and make room, or take as much
  land from the Wends and Esthes as you need. And you shall be preserved fresh
  and green. Down there the southern sun withers and scorches you.' This is the
  advice of King Frode, whom men have called the Wise for fifty years. Now as
  we passed into the sea of Midilgard, we had already heard from seafarers that
  your troubles had been put an end to by a new King, whom they described as
  looking like the god Baldur; that you had re-won the Roman citadel and all
  the land of Gardarike, and had even victoriously carried destruction into
  part of Grêkaland itself. And now we see with our own eyes that you do not
  need the aid of our weapons. You live in plenty and pleasure, and everything
  is full of red gold and white stone. But still I must repeat my father's
  words and advice; listen to him; he is wise! Until now, every one who has
  despised King Frode's advice, has bitterly regretted it."</p>

  <p>But Totila shook his head, smiled, and said:</p>

  <p>"We owe you and King Frode warm thanks for rare and noble faithfulness.
  Such brotherly love from the Northern heroes shall never be forgotten in the
  songs of the Goths. But, O King Harald, follow me and look about you."</p>

  <p>And Totila rose and took his guest by the hand, and led him to the
  entrance of the pavilion, casting back the hanging curtains.</p>

  <p>There lay river and land and city in the glowing light of the setting
  sun.</p>

  <p>"Look at this land, wonderful in the beauty of its sky and soil and art.
  Look at this Tiber-stream, covered by a happy, jubilant, and handsome people.
  Look at these masses of laurel and myrtle. Cast thine eyes upon the columned
  palaces, which shine across from Rome in the evening rays; on the tall marble
  figures upon these terrace-steps&mdash;and say thou, if all this were thine,
  wouldst thou ever leave it? Wouldst thou exchange all this magnificence for
  the firs and pines of the cold land of the north, where spring-time never
  blooms, for the smoke-blackened wooden huts on the misty heaths?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, that I would, by Thorns hammer! This land is good to lay waste, to
  luxuriate and win battles in; but that done, then up and away with the booty!
  But you, Goths, are thrown here like drops of water upon hot iron. And if
  ever we sons of Odin shall rule this land, it will be only such of us as have
  a strong support in other sons of Odin. But you&mdash;you have already become
  very different to us. Your grandfathers, your fathers, and yourselves have
  wooed Roman women; in a few generations, if this continue, you will be
  Romanised. Already you have become smaller, and darker in skin, eyes, and
  hair. At least many of you. I long to be away from this soft and sultry air,
  and to breathe the north wind that rushes over our woods and waves. Yes, and
  I long for the smoke-blackened halls of wood, where Gothic runes are burnt
  into the roof-beams, and the harps of the Skalds hang on the wooden pillars,
  and the sacred hearth-fire glows hospitably for ever! I long for our
  Northland, for it is our home!"</p>

  <p>"Then permit us to love <i>our</i> home: this land Italia!"</p>

  <p>"It will never be your home; but perhaps your grave. You are strangers and
  will remain so. Or you will become Romanised. But there is no abiding in the
  land possible for you as sons of Odin."</p>

  <p>"Let us at least try, my brother Harald," cried Totila, laughing. "Yes, we
  have changed in the two centuries during which our people have lived among
  the laurels. But are we the worse for it? Is it necessary to wear a bearskin
  in order to be a hero? Is it necessary to rob gold and marble statues in
  order to enjoy them? Can one be only either a barbarian or a Roman? Can we
  not keep the virtues of the Germans and lay aside their faults? Adopt the
  virtues of the Romans without their vices?"</p>

  <p>But Harald shook his massive head.</p>

  <p>"I should rejoice at your success, but I do not believe in it. The plant
  takes the nature of the soil and climate upon and under which it lives. And,
  for my part, I should not at all like it, even if I and mine could succeed.
  Our faults are dearer to me than the virtues of the Italians&mdash;if they
  have any."</p>

  <p>Totila remembered the words with which he himself had answered Julius.</p>

  <p>"From the north comes all strength&mdash;the world belongs to the
  Northmen," concluded Harald.</p>

  <p>"Tell it to them in the words of thy favourite song," said his sister.</p>

  <p>And she handed him her harp; and Harald played and sang an alliterative
  measure, or <i>stabreim</i>, which Adalgoth, translating it into rhymed
  verse, thus repeated to Valeria:</p>

  <p>"Thor stood at the midnight end of the world, And the battle-axe flew from
  his hand. 'As far as the battle-axe flies when hurled, Is mine the sea and
  the land!' And the hammer flew from his powerful hand Like chaff by a
  hurricane blown: And it fell in the farthest southern-land, So that all
  became his own. Since then 'tis German right and grace With the hammer the
  lands to merit; We come of the Hammer-God's noble race, And his world-wide
  realm will inherit!"</p>

  <p>A burst of applause from his Gothic hearers rewarded the royal minstrel,
  who looked as if he could well realise the proud boast of the song.</p>

  <p>Harald once more emptied his deep golden cup. Then he rose and said:</p>

  <p>"Now, my little sister Haralda, and you, my sailor brothers, we must break
  up. We must be on board the <i>Midgardschlange</i> before the moon shines
  upon her deck. What says the Wikinga-Balk?&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Ill sleeps the ship When her pilot lies on shore.'</p>

  <p>"Long friendship&mdash;short parting; that is northern custom."</p>

  <p>Totila laid his hand upon his guest's arm.</p>

  <p>"Art thou in such haste? Fearest thou to become Romanised with us? Do but
  remain; it does not come so quickly. And with thee would scarcely
  happen."</p>

  <p>"There thou art right, Rome-King," laughed the giant; "and, by Thor's
  hammer, I am proud of it! But we must go. We had three things to do here. To
  help you in battle. You do not need us. Or do you? Shall we wait until new
  wars break out?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Totila, with a smile; "we have peace and not new strife in
  view. And if it should really once more come to a war&mdash;shall I prove
  thee right, brother Harald, in thinking us Goths too weak to uphold our rule
  alone? Have we not beaten our enemies without your help? Could we not beat
  them again, we Goths alone?"</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," said the Viking. "Secondly, we came to fetch you back
  to the Northland. You will not come. And, thirdly, to lay waste the islands
  of the Emperor of Grêkaland. That is a merry sport, which we have not
  sufficiently practised. Come with us, help us, and revenge yourselves."</p>

  <p>"No; the word of a king is sacred. We have agreed to an armistice which
  has still several months to run. And listen, friend Harald. Have a care and
  do not mistake <i>our</i> islands for those of the Emperor. It would
  displease me if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," laughed Harald, "fear nothing. We have already noticed that thy
  harbours and coasts are excellently guarded. And here and there thou hast
  erected high gallows, and affixed to them tablets inscribed with Roman runes.
  Thy commodore at Panormus translated it to us:</p>

  <p>"'Sea-robbers drowned, Land-robbers hanged; That is the law In Totila's
  land.'</p>

  <p>"And my sea-brothers have taken a great dislike to thy sticks and tablets
  and runes. Farewell, then, Rome-King of the Goths! May thy good-fortune
  endure! Farewell, lovely Queen of Night! Farewell, all you heroes! we shall
  meet again in Walhalla, if not sooner."</p>

  <p>And after taking a short leave, the northerners walked away.</p>

  <p>Haralda threw her falcon into the air.</p>

  <p>"Fly before us, Snotr&mdash;on deck!"</p>

  <p>And the intelligent bird flew away, swift as an arrow, straight down the
  river.</p>

  <p>The King and Valeria accompanied their guests halfway down the staircase;
  there they exchanged the last greetings. The Amazon cast one more rapid
  glance at Totila.</p>

  <p>Harald remarked it, and as they descended the last steps he whispered:</p>

  <p>"Little sister, it is on thy account that I left so quickly. Do not grieve
  about this handsome King. Thou knowest that I have inherited from our father
  the gift of recognising men who are fated to die. I tell thee, death by the
  spear hovers over this King's sunny head. He will not again see the changing
  of the moon."</p>

  <p>At this the strong and tender-hearted woman forced back the tears which
  rose into her proud eyes.</p>

  <p>Duke Guntharis, Earl Teja, and Duke Adalgoth accompanied the Goths to
  their boats on the Tiber, and waited until they had put off.</p>

  <p>Teja looked after them gravely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, King Frode is wise," he said. "But folly is often sweeter than
  truth; and grander. Go back to the terrace without me, Duke Guntharis. I see
  the King's despatch-boat coming up the river. I will wait and see what news
  it brings."</p>

  <p>"I will wait with thee, my master," said Adalgoth, looking at Teja
  anxiously. "Thy countenance is so terribly grave. What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I have a foreboding, my Adalgoth," answered Teja, putting his arm round
  the youth's neck. "See how rapidly the sun sets. I shudder! Let us go and
  meet the boat&mdash;it will land below there, where lie the ancient marble
  columns."</p>

  <p>Totila and Valeria had returned to the pavilion.</p>

  <p>"Wert thou moved, my beloved," asked the Roman girl with emotion, "by what
  that stranger said? It was&mdash;Guntharis and Teja explained it to
  me&mdash;of very grave import."</p>

  <p>But Totila quickly raised his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Valeria, it did not move me! I have taken great Theodoric's great
  work upon my shoulders. I will live and die for the dream of my youth, for my
  kingdom! Come&mdash;where is Adalgoth, my cup-bearer? Come; let us once more
  pledge a cup, Valeria&mdash;let us drink to the good fortune of the Gothic
  kingdom!"</p>

  <p>And he lifted up his cup; but before he could put it to his lips,
  Adalgoth, with a loud call, hurried up the steps followed by Teja.</p>

  <p>"King Totila," cried Adalgoth breathlessly, "prepare to hear terrible
  news; collect thyself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Totila set down his cup and asked, turning pale:</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Thy despatch-boat has brought news from Ancona. The Emperor has broken
  the armistice&mdash;he has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Teja had now drawn near. He was pale with fury.</p>

  <p>"Up, King Totila!" he cried. "Exchange the wreath for the helmet! Off
  Senogallia, near Ancona, a Byzantine fleet suddenly attacked our squadron
  which lay under the protection of the armistice. Our ships no more exist. A
  powerful army of the enemy has landed. And the commander-in-chief
  is&mdash;Cethegus the Prefect!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-15"
     name="b5b-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">In the camp of Cethegus the Prefect at Setinum, at the foot
  of the Apennines, a few miles north of Taginæ, Lucius Licinius, who had just
  arrived by sea from Epidamnus, was walking up and down, in eager conversation
  with Syphax, before the tent of the commander-in-chief.</p>

  <p>"My master has been anxiously expecting you, tribune, for many days," said
  the Moor; "he will be rejoiced to find you in the camp when he returns. He
  has ridden out to reconnoitre."</p>

  <p>"Whither rode he?"</p>

  <p>"Towards Taginæ, with Piso and the other tribunes."</p>

  <p>"That is the next fortified town occupied by the Goths to the south, is it
  not? But now, you wise Moor, tell me what happened last at Byzantium? You
  know that your master sent me to levy forces among the Longobardians, long
  before anything was decided. And as, after a dangerous journey through the
  country of the Longobardians and Gepidæ, I safely crossed the rapid Ister
  near Novæ into Justinian's kingdom, and went to fetch the promised orders of
  the Prefect from my host at Nicopolis, I only found a laconic command to meet
  him in Senogallia. I was much astonished; for I scarcely dared to hope that
  he would ever again, at the head of the imperial fleet and army, victoriously
  tread the soil of Italy. From Senogallia I followed your march hither. The
  few captains whom I have met in the camp told me briefly of the course of
  events until shortly before the arrest of Belisarius. But they could not tell
  me how that occurred, and what took place later. Now you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know what happened almost as well as my master, for I was
  present."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible? Can Belisarius really have conspired against the Emperor?
  I could never have believed it!"</p>

  <p>Syphax smiled slyly.</p>

  <p>"I have no right to judge of that. I can only tell you exactly what
  happened. Listen&mdash;but come into the tent and refresh yourself. My master
  would scold me for letting you stand outside unattended to. And we can talk
  more freely inside," he added, as he closed the curtains of the tent behind
  him. Then begging his master's guest to be seated, he served him with fruit
  and wine, and began his account. "As the night of that fateful day fell, I
  went and hid myself in a niche of Photius's house, behind the tall statue of
  some Christian saint, whose name I do not know, but who had a famous broad
  back. I could easily look into the hall of the house through an aperture just
  above my head, which had been made to allow the passage of fresh air. The
  faint light within enabled me to distinguish a number of the aristocrats whom
  I had often seen in the imperial palace, and in the houses of Belisarius and
  Procopius. The first thing that I understood&mdash;for my master has taken
  care that I should learn the speech of the Greeks who call themselves
  Romani&mdash;was what the master of the house was saying to a man who had
  just then entered. 'Rejoice,' he said, 'for Belisarius comes. After scarcely
  deigning to look at me yesterday when, full of expectation, I stopped him in
  the gymnasium of Zenon, to-day he himself addressed me as I was slowly and
  cautiously passing his house, for I knew that he would return from the hunt
  towards evening. He pressed this waxen tablet into my hand, first looking
  round to make sure that no one observed him. And on the tablet is written: "I
  cannot longer withstand your appeals. Certain reasons impel me to join you. I
  shall come this evening." But,' continued the master of the house, 'where is
  Piso, where is Salvius Julianus and the other young Romans?' 'They will not
  be coming,' answered the man. 'I saw almost all of them in boats on the
  Bosphorus. They have no doubt sailed to some feast at the Prefect's villa,
  near the Gate of Constantine.' 'Let them go,' said Photius; 'we do not need
  the brutal Latins, nor the proud and false Prefect. Verily, Belisarius
  outweighs them all.' At that moment I saw Belisarius enter the hall. He wore
  an ample mantle, which entirely hid his figure. The master of the house
  hurried to meet him, and all present gathered respectfully around him. 'Great
  Belisarius,' said his freedman, 'we know how to value your compliance.' And
  he pressed upon Belisarius the little ivory staff which is held by the head
  of the assembly, and led him to the raised seat of the president, which he
  himself had just vacated. 'Speak&mdash;command&mdash;act&mdash;we are ready,'
  said Photius. 'I shall act at the right time,' answered Belisarius gloomily,
  and took his seat. Just then young Anicius rushed into the room with tangled
  hair and flying garments; a drawn sword in his hand. 'Fly!' he cried. 'We are
  discovered and betrayed.' Belisarius rose. 'They have forced my house,'
  continued Anicius. 'My slaves were taken prisoners. The weapons which I had
  hidden were found, and your letters and documents, and, alas, my own too,
  have disappeared from a hiding-place which was known only to me! And still
  more&mdash;as I turned into the grove of Constantine, I thought I heard the
  sound of whispering and the rattle of arms amongst the bushes. I am
  followed&mdash;save yourselves!' The conspirators rushed to the doors.
  Belisarius alone remained quietly standing before his chair. 'Take heart!'
  cried Photius. 'Follow the example of your hero-chief!' But the sound of a
  trumpet was heard from the great house-door, the sign for me to leave my post
  and join my master, who stormed into the house at the head of the imperial
  lance-bearers and Golden Shields, with the Prefect of Byzantium, and the
  archon of the palace-guard. My master looked splendid," continued Syphax
  enthusiastically, "as, with a flaming torch in his left hand, a sword in his
  right, and his crimson plume floating behind him, he rushed into the hall; so
  looks the fire-demon when he issues from a blazing mountain in Africa! I drew
  my sword and sprang to my master's left side, for he carried no shield. He
  had ordered me to render young Anicius harmless as soon as possible. 'Down
  with all who resist, in the name of Justinian!' cried my master. His sword
  was dripping with blood, for he had killed with his own hand the body-guards
  whom Belisarius had placed at the entrance of the grove. 'Yield!' he cried to
  the frightened crowd; 'and thou, archon of the palace, arrest <i>all</i> the
  conspirators. Do you understand&mdash;<i>all</i>!' 'Is it possible! Shameless
  traitor!' cried Anicius, and rushed at my master with his sword. 'Yes,' he
  cried, 'there is the crimson crest! Die, murderer of my brother!' But the
  next moment he lay at our feet, severely wounded. I drew my sword out of his
  breast, and then disarmed Photius, who was the only one who still resisted.
  All the others allowed themselves to be taken like sheep bewildered by a
  thunder-storm. 'Bravo, Syphax!' cried my master. 'Examine his dress for any
  writings.' Then he turned to the archon, asking him if he were ready, for he
  had stopped hesitatingly opposite Belisarius, who remained perfectly quiet.
  'What!' asked the archon&mdash;'must I also arrest the magister militum?'
  '<i>All</i>, I said. 'Do you no longer understand Greek? You see&mdash;all
  see&mdash;that Belisarius is at the head of the conspiracy&mdash;he holds the
  president's staff, he occupies the president's chair.' 'Ha!' now cried
  Belisarius; 'is it so! Guards! Help, help, my body-guards! Marcellus,
  Barbatio, Ardaburius!" 'The dead cannot hear, magister militum,' said my
  master. 'Yield, in the name of the Emperor! Here is his great seal. For this
  night he has made me his representative, and a thousand lances bristle round
  this house.' 'Fidelity is madness!' cried Belisarius, threw his sword away,
  and held out his strong arms to the archon, who put on the chains. 'Into the
  dungeons with all the prisoners,' said my master. 'Photius and Belisarius
  must be put separately into the round tower of Anastasius, in the palace. I
  will hasten to the Emperor and return his ring, and take him this
  steel'&mdash;he lifted the sword of Belisarius from the ground&mdash;'and
  tell him that he may sleep in peace. The conspiracy is crushed&mdash;the
  Empire is saved!'&mdash;The very next morning the trial for high treason was
  commenced. Many witnesses were heard&mdash;I amongst them. I swore that I had
  seen Belisarius received and heard him greeted as the head of the conspiracy.
  I myself had taken the tablet from the dress of Photius. Belisarius would
  have appealed to the testimony of his bodyguards, but they were all dead.
  Photius and other prisoners, submitted to the rack, confessed that Belisarius
  had finally consented to become the head of the conspiracy. Antonina was
  strictly guarded in the Red House. The Empress refused to grant the interview
  for which she passionately sued. It told strongly against both her and
  Belisarius when spies of the Empress bore witness that they had seen young
  Anicius steal by night into the house of Belisarius for weeks together. And
  it shocked the judges that Anicius himself, Antonina and Belisarius,
  continued obstinately to deny their guilt, although it was so fully proved.
  Immediately after the arrest I was sent for by my master, to tell Antonina
  that he had been most painfully surprised to find that Belisarius was
  <i>really</i> at the head of the conspiracy; and at the same time to say that
  he had found not alone letters of hatred in the cistern belonging to Anicius.
  As I said these words, which I did not understand, the beautiful wife of
  Belisarius fell fainting to the ground.&mdash;We left Byzantium before
  Belisarius was sentenced; but Photius and most of the others were already
  condemned to death as we set sail with the imperial fleet for Epidamnus,
  where my master's tribunes and mercenaries, and the imperial forces
  originally intended for the Persian wars, were awaiting us. For my master had
  been honoured with the newly-created dignity of Magister Militum per Italium,
  and the command of the 'first army.' The 'second army' was to be brought
  after us by Prince Areobindos, when he had accomplished the easy task of
  overpowering the small Gothic garrisons in the towns of Epirus and the
  islands with a force five times their number."</p>

  <p>"What is said will be the punishment of Belisarius?" asked Lucius
  Licinius. "I could never have believed that that man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The judge will certainly condemn him to death, for his guilt is clear.
  But people speculate as to whether the Emperor's anger or his former
  affection for the general will get the victory. Most of them think that the
  Emperor will change the sentence of death into one of banishment and loss of
  sight. My master says that Belisarius's senseless denial of his guilt does
  him great harm. And he is also without the assistance of his wise friend
  Procopius, who is absent in Asia. Cethegus managed the embarkation of the
  troops to Epidamnus with such secrecy that the stupid Goths, who, besides,
  reckoned upon the armistice, were completely taken by surprise; and while the
  crews were sleeping on shore, the scantily-guarded Gothic fleet was taken and
  destroyed. But hark! here comes my master; he alone has such a proud
  step?"</p>

  <p>From Licinius Cethegus now learned that not only had he obtained a promise
  from Alboin, the Longobardian chief, that he would come to the help of
  Cethegus with twenty thousand men (a number which the latter, always jealous,
  found almost too great), but that he had succeeded in engaging other warlike
  troops of mercenaries.</p>

  <p>Cethegus, on his side, informed Lucius that, although he had been able to
  relieve Ravenna, he had met with much hindrance on the part of his own
  countrymen, who were slow to rise in revolt against the Goths; and that only
  with the Byzantines under his command, it would be impossible to beat Totila.
  He complained bitterly of the delay of Areobindos in bringing up the "second
  army," and regretted that he had been unable to reach Taginæ before Earl
  Teja, who had beaten the Saracens there posted with great loss, and had taken
  up a strong position in the expectation of being speedily joined by King
  Totila with the army.</p>

  <p>"And Taginæ is the key of the position," concluded Cethegus. "Earl Teja
  must have flown from Rome on the wings of the wind! I have tried to-day to
  ascertain the strength of his garrison, but I could not penetrate beyond
  Capræ. The barbarian King is already on the march, and where, oh! where
  tarries my 'second army?'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-16"
     name="b5b-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">The next day Totila reached Taginæ, accompanied by Valeria
  and Julius. He had hastened forward to join Teja with a portion of his
  troops, while Wisand and Guntharis reached him later with the main army. Only
  after their arrival could any attack be made upon the very strong position of
  the Prefect.</p>

  <p>Cethegus, too, attempted no assault, but while thus inactive, awaiting his
  "second army," he once more, and in vain, endeavoured to regain the lost
  affection of Julius. He went to Taginæ to meet him at a spot between the
  outposts of the opposing forces. He tried all possible means to induce him to
  return to his allegiance, even unveiling the history of his past life. The
  mother of Julius had once been betrothed to Cethegus, but her father had been
  persuaded by Duke Alaric to break off the match, and to give her in marriage
  to a Gothic noble. On the day of her wedding, Cethegus, mad with grief, had
  tried to carry her off by force, but, overpowered by numbers, had been struck
  down, and thrown, seemingly lifeless, on the banks of the Tiber. Many years
  after, he had found Julius, a young boy, forsaken, with his dying mother, in
  their villa on the banks of the Rhodus, which had been sacked by bands of
  marauders. From that moment Cethegus had adopted the son of his lost
  bride.&mdash;But in vain he now appealed to the gratitude of his adopted son.
  Julius not only recoiled with horror from any further connection with a man
  whose ruthless hands were stained with blood, but his deepening religious
  feeling separated him entirely from the avowed atheist.</p>

  <p>And, blow upon blow, Cethegus was disappointed in another matter. The
  "second army" was at last reported as approaching. Syphax brought the news;
  he had ridden night and day in order to reach the Prefect before this army
  should arrive, for at its head was, not Areobindos,
  but&mdash;<i>Narses</i>.</p>

  <p>Vexed and alarmed, Cethegus left his camp, and rode forward to meet
  Narses, with whom he found Alboin, the Longobardian chief. Narses received
  him with marked coolness, and at once explained to him that he could suffer
  no rival in his camp; that Cethegus must either serve under him as one of his
  generals, or remain inactive as his <i>guest</i>. Clearly seeing that he must
  either submit or be a prisoner, Cethegus at once affirmed that he considered
  it an honour to serve under Narses, and together the generals reached a
  favourable position between Helvillum and Taginæ.</p>

  <p>And a mighty army was that of Narses, with which he had advanced from the
  north and east in terrible strides, driving before him the Goths from
  position to position, making no prisoners, but inexorably annihilating all
  who stood in his way.</p>

  <p>Totila had but a small force to oppose to these numbers, for his army had
  been fearfully diminished; and now, when the Italians foresaw the probable
  consequences of the renewed war, and that the Goths were being slowly but
  surely overcome, they ceased to rally round Totila's flag, and even, where
  they felt themselves safe, betrayed the hiding-places of the Gothic people to
  the Byzantines. The persecuted Gothic families fled, and sought protection in
  the camp of Totila, who, fearing the famine sure to be caused by the
  accumulation of helpless masses, sent them still farther south to those parts
  of the peninsula yet uninvaded by Narses.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by his Earls, Totila now formed a plan by which he intended to
  entice the centre of the army of Narses (which was held by the Longobardians)
  into an ambush between Capræ and Taginæ. Reckoning upon the headlong valour
  of the Longobardians, Totila determined to place the full half of his troops
  in the town of Capræ, leaving the other half in Taginæ. Totila himself, with
  his small troop of horsemen, would advance beyond Capræ against the
  Longobardians; and at the moment of attack, would turn, feigning a sudden
  panic; would gallop back through the gates of Capræ (the troops there
  remaining concealed in the houses), and thus draw on the Longobardians to
  pursue him into the narrow road, between low hills, which lay between Capræ
  and Taginæ. At this spot Totila would place in ambush a troop of Persian
  horsemen, which had been unexpectedly brought to him by his old friend and
  rival, Furius Ahalla, who had orders, when the Longobardians were fairly
  taken in the trap, to issue from their ambush, and annihilate them. Totila
  counted upon the fidelity of Ahalla, who was bound to him by strong ties of
  gratitude in spite of the defeat he had suffered in his suit of Valeria. This
  plan of Totila was highly approved of by Hildebrand, and all the warriors who
  shared his counsels.</p>

  <p>The evening before the day of its execution all was in readiness. Furius
  Ahalla and his horsemen were posted in the narrow road, the "Flaminian Way."
  Earl Thorismuth himself went out to make sure that they had punctually obeyed
  orders. When he returned to Totila's camp, he brought word that Furius Ahalla
  begged Totila to delay his attack and feigned flight on the morrow, until
  three hundred of his best men, who had been delayed on the march, should have
  joined him; of which event he would immediately apprise Totila outside the
  gates of Capræ.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Totila, smiling, "I will await the proper moment, and
  meantime entertain the Longobardians by my feats of horsemanship. To-morrow,
  Teja, God will decide the right. Thou sayest there is no God but necessity. I
  say there is a living God&mdash;my victory to-morrow shall prove it."</p>

  <p>"Stay," cried Julius, who was present, "ye shall not tempt the Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Seest thou," cried Teja, as he rose and took up his shield, "Julius fears
  for his God!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-17"
     name="b5b-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">Brilliantly arose the sun on the next morning, casting its
  first beams over the warlike movement in the Gothic camp.</p>

  <p>As the King issued from his dwelling in the marketplace of Taginæ,
  Adalgoth, Thorismuth, and Phaza hurried to meet him with his milk-white
  charger, sent, together with a magnificent suit of armour, by Valeria, his
  bride.</p>

  <p>His arms rang as the King swung himself into the saddle.</p>

  <p>His grooms led up two other horses in reserve, one of which was Pluto, the
  Prefect's restless and fiery charger.</p>

  <p>From Totila's shoulders flowed his long white mantle, held together at the
  neck by a broad and heavy clasp set with precious stones. His cuirass was of
  shining silver, richly inlaid with gold, the figure of a flying swan upon the
  breast. The edges of the cuirass at the neck, arms, and belt, were bound with
  red silk. Beneath it showed the coat of white silk, reaching over the
  thighs.</p>

  <p>Broad gold bracelets and silvered gauntlets protected his arms and hands;
  greaves his knees and the top of his feet.</p>

  <p>His narrow and gracefully-shaped shield was divided into three fields of
  silver, gold, and crimson. On the golden field the figure of the flying swan
  was wrought in white enamel.</p>

  <p>The caparison and reins of his horse were set with silver and embroidered
  with red silk.</p>

  <p>In his right hand the King held a spear, to the point of which Valeria had
  fastened four streamers of red and white riband; merrily they fluttered in
  the morning breeze.</p>

  <p>Thus brilliantly arrayed, the King rode through the streets of Taginæ at
  the head of his horsemen. Earl Thorismuth, Phaza, and Duke Adalgoth, and also
  Julius, rode in his train. Julius carried no weapons, but he bore a shield
  forged by Teja.</p>

  <p>Never had Totila shone in such beauty! The people greeted him upon his way
  with shouts of joy. At the northern gate of Taginæ, Aligern came riding
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"I thought that thy place was with the right wing," said the King. "What
  brings thee here?"</p>

  <p>"My cousin Teja has ordered me to remain at thy side and guard thy
  life."</p>

  <p>"My Teja is untiring in his care of me!" cried the King.</p>

  <p>Aligern joined the escort.</p>

  <p>Earl Thorismuth now undertook the command of the footmen who were hidden
  in the houses of Taginæ.</p>

  <p>Outside the gate, the King rode to the front of his not very numerous
  troop of horsemen, and disclosed his plan to the captains.</p>

  <p>"I entrust to you, comrades, the most difficult of all tasks&mdash;flight!
  But the flight will be only seeming. What is true, is your courage and the
  destruction of the foe."</p>

  <p>And now the small troop rode forward past the place of ambush on the
  Flaminian Way, the King convincing himself that the Persian horsemen were in
  readiness upon both the wooded heights. The ambush on the right was commanded
  by Furius himself, that on the left by his chief, Isdigerd.</p>

  <p>Totila now rode into Capræ through the southern gate, and admonished the
  bowmen under Earl Wisand not to issue from the houses in which they were
  concealed, until the Persian horsemen had fallen upon the Longobardians from
  their ambush, but then immediately to sally out of the southern gate, while
  at the same time the spear-bearers would advance against the enemy from the
  northern gate of Taginæ.</p>

  <p>"Thus the Longobardians and such of Narses' foot who have pressed forward
  between Capræ and Taginæ will be surrounded on all sides and crushed. I and
  Thorismuth attack in front, Furius and Isdigerd on both flanks, and Wisand in
  the rear. They will be lost!"</p>

  <p>"Does he not look like the sun-god?" Adalgoth delightedly asked
  Julius.</p>

  <p>"Peace! Make no idol of sun or man! Besides, to-day is the solstice!"
  answered Julius.</p>

  <p>At length the King reached the northern gate of Capræ, left it open behind
  him, and galloped out with his little troop upon the level land between Capræ
  and Helvillum.</p>

  <p>Here Narses had placed his centre; foremost Alboin with his Longobardians.
  Behind these, at a considerable distance, stood Narses in his litter,
  surrounded by Cethegus, Liberius, Auzalas, and other leaders.</p>

  <p>Narses had had a bad night, disturbed by slight fits. He was very weak,
  and could not stand up for any length of time in his low and open litter.</p>

  <p>He had strictly admonished Alboin not to advance to the attack without
  special orders.</p>

  <p>King Totila gave a sign to his horsemen, and at a trot the thin line
  advanced towards the far superior ranks of the Longobardians.</p>

  <p>"They surely will not shame us by attacking us with only a few lances?"
  cried Alboin.</p>

  <p>But an attack did not seem to be the present object of the King.</p>

  <p>He had ridden far in advance of his men, who had suddenly halted, and now
  attracted all eyes by his feats of horsemanship.</p>

  <p>The spectacle which he afforded was so wonderful in the eyes of the
  Byzantines, that the witnesses related it in astonishment to Procopius, who,
  himself amazed, has remitted it to us.</p>

  <p>"On this day," he writes, "King Totila evidently wished to show his
  enemies what manner of man he was. His weapons and his horse shone with gold.
  So many shining red streamers fluttered from the point of his spear that this
  ornament alone announced the King from a distance. Thus, mounted on a
  splendid charger, in the space between the two armies, did he indulge in a
  skilful exercise of arms. Now he rode in a circle; now he caracoled in
  semicircles to the right and left; now he hurled his spear into the air, as
  he rode off at full gallop, and caught it by the middle of the shaft as it
  fell quivering, first with his right hand, and then with his left; and thus
  he showed to the wondering troops his feats of horsemanship."</p>

  <p>After the battle, however, the Byzantines learned the true reason of this
  merry sport.</p>

  <p>For a time Alboin looked on quietly.</p>

  <p>Then he said to a Longobardian chief who stood near him:</p>

  <p>"That fellow rides to the battle-field adorned like a bridegroom! What
  costly armour! We do not see the like at home, Gisulf. And not to dare to
  attack! Does Narses again sleep?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-18"
     name="b5b-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">At last a Persian horseman, making his way through the ranks
  of the Goths, galloped up to the King, gave a message, and galloped back
  again at full speed.</p>

  <p>"At last!" cried Totila. "Now enough of sport! Brave Alboin, son of
  Audoin," he loudly cried across to the enemy's ranks, "wilt thou really fight
  for the Greeks against us? Then come on, O King's son&mdash;it is a King who
  calls thee?"</p>

  <p>Alboin could no longer restrain his impatience.</p>

  <p>"Mine must he be with armour and horse!" he shouted, and spurred forward
  with his lance couched.</p>

  <p>Totila, with a gentle pressure of his thigh, brought his horse to a sudden
  standstill. It seemed that he intended to stand the shock.</p>

  <p>Alboin came on at a furious gallop.</p>

  <p>Another slight pressure of Totila's thigh, a clever spring to one side,
  and the Longobardian, who could not check his horse, rushed far past his
  adversary.</p>

  <p>But the next moment Totila was at Alboin's back; he could easily have
  bored him through with his spear.</p>

  <p>The Longobardians, seeing the danger of their chief, uttered loud cries
  and hurried to his assistance.</p>

  <p>But Totila whirled his lance round, and contented himself with giving his
  adversary such a thrust in the left side with the shaft end, that Alboin fell
  headlong out of his saddle on the right side of his horse. Totila quietly
  rode back to his troop, waving his spear over his head in triumph.</p>

  <p>Alboin had remounted, and now led his troop against the thin ranks of the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>But just before the shock of meeting, the King cried, "Fly! fly into the
  town!" turned his horse's head, and galloped away towards Capræ.</p>

  <p>His horsemen followed him.</p>

  <p>For one moment Alboin halted in perplexity. But the next he cried:</p>

  <p>"It is nothing else; it is a pure flight! There they run into the gate!
  Yes, feats of horsemanship are one thing, and fighting is another. After
  them, my wolves! into the town!"</p>

  <p>And the Longobardians galloped forwards to Capræ, burst open the northern
  gate&mdash;which had been closed, but not bolted, by the flying
  Goths&mdash;and rushed through the long street towards the southern gate,
  through which the last Goth was just disappearing.</p>

  <p>Narses had till now stood upright in his litter with difficulty, observing
  all that passed.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" he angrily cried. "Halt! Blow the trumpets! Sound the retreat! It
  is the most clumsy trap in the world! But this Alboin thinks that if any one
  runs away from him, it must be in earnest!"</p>

  <p>But the trumpeters blew in vain.</p>

  <p>The cries of victory uttered by the pursuing Longobardians, drowned the
  blast of the trumpets; or those that heard it disregarded it.</p>

  <p>Narses groaned as he saw the last ranks of the Longobardians disappear
  into the Gate of Capræ.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he sighed; "those blockheads oblige me to commit a folly with open
  eyes. I cannot let them suffer for their stupidity as they deserve. I still
  need them. Therefore, forward, in the name of nonsense! Before we can
  overtake them, they may be already half destroyed! Forward, Cethegus,
  Anzalas, and Liberius! Take the Isaurians, Armenians, and Illyrians, and get
  into Capræ. But reflect that the town <i>cannot</i> be empty. It is a snare,
  into which we follow those blind bulls with open eyes. I will come after in
  my litter; but I can stand no more."</p>

  <p>And he sank back into his seat, terribly fatigued. A slight convulsion,
  such as he often experienced when excited, shook his frame.</p>

  <p>The footmen of Cethegus and Liberius advanced towards the town at a rapid
  march, the two leaders riding in front.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile pursued and pursuers had rushed through the little town, and the
  last Longobardians had passed Capræ, while the first, with Alboin, had
  reached that part of the Flaminian Way where the two hills bounded and
  confined the road on the right and left.</p>

  <p>The King galloped forward another horse's length; then he halted, turned,
  and gave a sign.</p>

  <p>Adalgoth, who rode at his side, blew his horn, and out of the northern
  gate of Taginæ issued Thorismuth and his spear-bearers, while from the double
  ambush on the hills the Persian horsemen of the Corsican burst out with a
  yell and a blast of cornets.</p>

  <p>"Now wheel about, my Goths! Forward to the charge! Woe to the befooled!"
  cried Totila.</p>

  <p>Alboin looked helplessly round.</p>

  <p>"We have never before trotted into anything so evil, my wolves!" he
  said.</p>

  <p>He would have retreated, but now Gothic footmen issued likewise from the
  southern gate of Capræ, blocking the way back.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for it but to die merrily, Gisulf! Greet Rosimunda, if
  thou escapest!"</p>

  <p>And he turned to meet one of the leaders of the Persian horsemen, who,
  distinguished by a richly-gilded open helm, had now reached the road, and was
  advancing straight upon him.</p>

  <p>As he came up to Alboin, he of the gilded helmet cried:</p>

  <p>"Turn, Longobardian! yonder stands our common foe! <i>Down with the
  Goths!</i>"</p>

  <p>And he ran his sword through a Gothic horseman who was aiming a stroke at
  Alboin.</p>

  <p>And now the Persian horsemen, galloping past the Longobardians, attacked
  the horrified Goths. For a moment the latter halted, taken by surprise. But
  when they saw that it was no mistake&mdash;that the ambush was against
  <i>them</i>, and not against the Longobardians&mdash;they cried, "Treachery,
  treachery! all is lost!" and, this time in unfeigned flight, rushed back to
  Taginæ, carrying everything along with them, even their own footmen, who were
  just issuing from the gate.</p>

  <p>Even the King changed countenance when he saw the Corsican strike at the
  Goths at Alboin's side.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is treachery!" he cried. "Ha! the tiger! Down with him!"</p>

  <p>And he rushed at the Corsican. But before he could reach him, Isdigerd the
  Persian had stormed into the road from the left between the King and
  Furius.</p>

  <p>"Aim at the King!" he cried to his men. "All spears at the King! There he
  is, the white one! With the swan on his helmet! Down with him!"</p>

  <p>A hail of spears whistled through the air. In a moment the King's shield
  bristled with darts.</p>

  <p>By this time the Corsican had recognised the tall and glittering figure in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>"It is he! I will have his heart's blood!"</p>

  <p>And he forced his way through his own and Isdigerd's men.</p>

  <p>The two enraged adversaries were now separated only by a few feet.</p>

  <p>But Totila had turned against Isdigerd. Pierced in the neck by the King's
  spear, the chief fell dead to the ground.</p>

  <p>And now Totila and Furius met.</p>

  <p>The Corsican aimed his spear full at the King's unprotected face.</p>

  <p>But suddenly the glittering helmet and the white mantle had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Two spears had struck the white horse, and at the same time a third
  pierced the King's shield and wounded his left arm severely.</p>

  <p>Horse and man fell.</p>

  <p>Isdigerd's Persians raised a wild cry of exultation and pressed
  forward.</p>

  <p>Furius and Alboin spurred their horses.</p>

  <p>"Spare the King's life! take him prisoner! He spared me!" cried
  Alboin.</p>

  <p>For he had been greatly touched when Gisulf told him that he distinctly
  saw the King change the point of his spear for the shaft.</p>

  <p>"No! Down with Totila!" cried Furius.</p>

  <p>And he hurled his spear at the wounded man, whom Aligern was trying to
  lift upon the Prefect's horse and lead out of the fight.</p>

  <p>Julius caught the Corsican's first spear upon Teja's proven shield.</p>

  <p>Furius called for a second, and aimed at the press around the King; Phaza,
  the Armenian, tried to parry the stroke and received the spear in his
  heart.</p>

  <p>Then Furius, who had now spurred close up, raised his long and crooked
  scimetar against the King. But before the stroke could fall the Corsican fell
  backwards from his saddle.</p>

  <p>The young Duke of Apulia had thrust the staff of his banner with such
  force against Ahalla's breast that the wood was shattered.</p>

  <p>And now Totila's banner&mdash;the costly work of Valeria and her
  women&mdash;was in the greatest danger in Adalgoth's hands. For all the
  enemy's horse pressed upon the bold young standard-bearer; a stroke of
  Gisulf's axe struck the staff and broke it again&mdash;Adalgoth tore off the
  silken flag and tucked it into his sword-belt.</p>

  <p>Alboin had now come up, and cried:</p>

  <p>"Yield, thou King of the Goths&mdash;to me, a King's son!"</p>

  <p>Aligern had just succeeded in lifting the King on to the Prefect's horse;
  he turned to the Longobardian, who, wishing to stay the King's flight but to
  save his life, aimed a stroke at the latter's horse with his spear. But the
  next moment Aligern had cleft Alboin's vulture-winged helmet, and, stunned,
  the latter wavered in his saddle.</p>

  <p>Thus, the leaders of their enemies being for the moment repulsed,
  Adalgoth, Aligern, and Julius had time to lead the King out of the tumult as
  far as the northern gate of Taginæ. From this place the King would have
  conducted the battle, but he could scarcely hold himself upright in his
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"Thorismuth," he said, "thou must defend Taginæ; for the present Capræ is
  lost. Let a mounted messenger fetch the whole of Hildebrand's wing here; the
  road to Rome must be kept open at all costs. Teja, as I learned, has already
  joined in the battle with his left wing.&mdash;To defend the retreat to the
  south&mdash;is our last hope!"</p>

  <p>And, saying this, he swooned away.</p>

  <p>But Earl Thorismuth said:</p>

  <p>"I and my spearmen will defend Taginæ to the last man. Not a foe shall get
  in here; neither the Persians nor the Longobardians. I will protect the
  King's life as long as I can raise a finger. Take him farther back; into the
  mountain&mdash;into the cloister but make haste, for there, from the Gate of
  Capræ, come the enemy's foot&mdash;and, look there!&mdash;Cethegus the
  Prefect with his Isaurians! Capræ and our bowmen are lost!"</p>

  <p>And so it was.</p>

  <p>Wisand, obeying his orders, had not defended Capræ, but had allowed
  Cethegus and Liberius to enter, and only when they were fairly inside the
  town did he begin the fight in the streets, at the same time sending a
  thousand of his men out of the southern gate to attack the Longobardians.</p>

  <p>But, as the ambuscades had fallen upon the Goths instead of the
  Longobardians; as Alboin and Furius united in dispersing or annihilating the
  few Gothic horsemen, and the attack intended by the spearmen from Taginæ did
  not take place; the Gothic bowmen, first in Capræ itself, and then on the
  Flaminian Way, between Capræ and Taginæ, were quickly crushed by superior
  force.</p>

  <p>Wisand escaped as if by a miracle, and, though wounded, reached Taginæ and
  reported the annihilation of his troops.</p>

  <p>Narses was carried into Capræ, and the Illyrians began to storm Taginæ.
  Earl Thorismuth resisted heroically. He fought his best in order to cover the
  retreat of his comrades.</p>

  <p>He was presently reinforced by a few thousand men from Hildebrand's left
  wing, who now hurried up, while the old master-at-arms led the greater part
  of his troops southwards beyond Taginæ upon the high-road to Rome.</p>

  <p>Just as the storming of Taginæ was about to commence, Cethegus met Furius
  and Alboin, who had recovered from the blows they had received.</p>

  <p>Cethegus had heard of the course pursued by the Corsican, which had
  decided the fate of the battle. He shook him by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Well done, friend Furius! At last on the right side, and against the
  barbarian King!"</p>

  <p>"He must not escape alive!" growled the Corsican.</p>

  <p>"What? How? He still lives! I thought that&mdash;he had fallen," said
  Cethegus hastily.</p>

  <p>"No; they managed to rescue him after he was wounded."</p>

  <p>"He must not live!" cried Cethegus. "Then you are right! It is of more
  importance than to win Taginæ. Narses can manage that heroic work from his
  litter. He has seventy to one. Up, Furius! Why do your horsemen stand idle
  here?"</p>

  <p>"The animals cannot ride up the walls!"</p>

  <p>"No; but they can swim. Up! take three hundred yourself, and give me three
  hundred. Two roads lead right and left from the little town over&mdash;no!
  they have broken down the bridges&mdash;they lead <i>through</i> the Clasius
  and the Sibola&mdash;let us take these roads. The wounded King is
  certainly&mdash;can he still fight?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly."</p>

  <p>"Then he has fled beyond Taginæ&mdash;to Rome or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No; to his bride!" cried Furius. "Most certainly to Valeria in the
  cloister. Ha! I will stab him in her very arms! Up, Persians! follow me.
  Thanks, Prefect! Take as many horsemen as you like. And ride to the
  right&mdash;I will ride to the left round the town; for both roads lead to
  the cloister."</p>

  <p>And, wheeling to the left, he disappeared.</p>

  <p>Cethegus ordered the rest of the horsemen to follow him, speaking in the
  Persian language.</p>

  <p>Then he rode up to Liberius and said:</p>

  <p>"I will take the Gothic King prisoner."</p>

  <p>"What? He still lives? Then make haste!"</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile you can take this Taginæ," continued Cethegus; "I will leave
  you my Isaurians."</p>

  <p>And he galloped away with Syphax and three hundred Persians.</p>

  <p>Meantime the wounded King had been taken by his friends out of Taginæ into
  a little pine-wood near the road, where he drank from a spring and gradually
  revived.</p>

  <p>"Julius," he said, "ride on to Valeria; tell her that the battle is lost,
  but not the kingdom. That I am alive and still hope. As soon as I feel a
  little stronger I shall ride up to the Spes Bonorum. I ordered Teja and
  Hildebrand there when they had finished their tasks. It is a high and safe
  position. Go, I beg thee; comfort Valeria and take her also from the cloister
  to Spes Bonorum. Thou wilt not? Then I must myself ride up the difficult
  road&mdash;surely thou wilt spare me that?"</p>

  <p>Julius was reluctant to leave the wounded man.</p>

  <p>"Oh, relieve me from my helmet and mantle! they are so heavy," said
  Totila.</p>

  <p>Julius took them from him and gave him his own mantle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-19"
     name="b5b-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">All at once a thought flashed across the mind of the monk;
  had they not once before exchanged garments&mdash;the Dioscuri?</p>

  <p>Had he not once before drawn the murderous steel directed at Totila's
  heart upon himself?</p>

  <p>He thought they were followed. It seemed to him that he heard horses
  approaching, and Aligern&mdash;Adalgoth held the King's head upon his
  knees&mdash;had hastened to the edge of the wood to look.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is they," he cried as he returned; "Persian horsemen are riding
  up from both sides of the wood!"</p>

  <p>"Then make haste, Julius," begged Totila; "save Valeria! Take her to Teja
  at the sarcophagus."</p>

  <p>"I will make all speed, my friend! Farewell till we meet again!" And
  Julius once more pressed Totila's hand. Then he mounted Pluto&mdash;he chose
  the wounded horse, leaving his own, which was unhurt.</p>

  <p>Unseen by Totila, he set the helmet with its silver swan upon his head,
  folded the white mantle around him, and galloped out of the wood towards the
  cloister hill.</p>

  <p>"This road," he thought, "is open and undefended, while the road which the
  King will take to the Spes Bonorum leads through wood and vineyard. Perhaps I
  shall succeed in attracting the pursuers away from him."</p>

  <p>And, in fact, he had no sooner issued from beneath the trees, and begun to
  ride up the hill, than he saw that the horsemen who had come from beyond
  Taginæ were eagerly following him.</p>

  <p>In order to keep the pursuers away from the King, and from discovering
  their error, he urged his horse to its full speed.</p>

  <p>But the animal was wounded, and the way was very steep. Nearer and nearer
  came the pursuers.</p>

  <p>"Is it he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is he."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not. He is too short," said the leader of the troop, who rode
  foremost.</p>

  <p>"Would he fly alone?"</p>

  <p>"That would be the best way to escape," observed the leader.</p>

  <p>"It is he most surely; I see the silver swan on his helmet!"</p>

  <p>"And the white mantle!"</p>

  <p>"But he rode a white horse," said the leader.</p>

  <p>"Yes, at first," said one of the horsemen; "but when it fell, struck by my
  spear, they lifted him&mdash;I was close by&mdash;upon that charger."</p>

  <p>"Enough," said the leader, "you are right. I recognise the horse."</p>

  <p>"A noble animal! How it keeps on, and up hill, too, although wounded."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is a noble animal! And I will make him stop. Pay attention! Halt,
  Pluto!" he shouted. "On your knees!"</p>

  <p>Snorting and trembling, the clever, obedient animal, in spite of spur and
  blows, stood stockstill, and slowly bent its fore-legs in the sand.</p>

  <p>"It is ruin, barbarian, to ride the Prefect's horse! There, take that for
  the Forum! and that for the Capitol! and that for Julius!"</p>

  <p>And the Prefect&mdash;for he it was&mdash;furiously hurled three spears
  one after the other, his own and two carried by Syphax, at the back of his
  victim, and with such force that they passed completely through the
  fugitive's body.</p>

  <p>Then Cethegus sprang from his horse, drew his sword, and taking the fallen
  man by the back of his helmet, dragged up his head from the earth.</p>

  <p>"Julius!" he screamed in horror.</p>

  <p>"You, O Cethegus!" Julius could just murmur.</p>

  <p>"Julius! you must not, must not die!"</p>

  <p>And Cethegus passionately tried to stanch the blood that issued from the
  three wounds.</p>

  <p>"If you love me," said the dying man, "save him&mdash;save Totila!" And
  his gentle eyes closed for ever.</p>

  <p>Cethegus put his hand upon the heart of the dead man; he laid his ear upon
  the bared breast.</p>

  <p>"All is over!" he then said, in a faint voice. "O Manilia! Julius, I loved
  thee! And he died with <i>his</i> name upon his lips! All is over!" he cried
  again, but this time in a voice of anger; "the last bond which united me to
  human love I have myself cut, deceived by mocking accident! It was my last
  weakness! And now all tender feeling, be dead to me! Lift him on to the
  horse.&mdash;This, my Pluto, shall be your last service.&mdash;Take
  him&mdash;up there I see a chapel&mdash;take him there, and let him be buried
  with all ceremony by the priests. Merely say that he died as a
  monk&mdash;that he died for his friend. He deserves a Christian burial. But
  I," he added, with a terrible expression on his face, "I will once more seek
  his friend; I will unite them without delay&mdash;and for ever."</p>

  <p>And he mounted his horse.</p>

  <p>"Whither?" asked Syphax. "Back to Taginæ?"</p>

  <p>"No! down into that wood. He must be hidden there, for thence came
  Julius."</p>

  <p>During these occurrences the King had recovered, and now rode with
  Adalgoth, Aligern, and a few riders, straight out of the wood, on the outer
  edge of which the road ascended to the chapel hill. As they issued from the
  trees they could distinctly perceive the walls of the building.</p>

  <p>But they themselves had been seen, for they heard a yell to their right,
  and over the open level a numerous troop of horsemen came galloping towards
  them from the river.</p>

  <p>The King recognised the leader, and before his companions could prevent
  him, he spurred his horse, couched his spear, and rushed to meet his enemy.
  Like two thunderbolts from the lowering heavens, the two horsemen crashed
  together.</p>

  <p>"Insolent barbarian!"</p>

  <p>"Miserable traitor!"</p>

  <p>And both fell from their horses.</p>

  <p>They had met with such fury, that neither of them had thought of defending
  himself, but only of overthrowing his adversary.</p>

  <p>Furius Ahalla had fallen dead, for the King had pierced him to the heart
  through gilded shield and breastplate with such force, that the shaft of the
  spear had broken in the wound. But the King also sank dying into Adalgoth's
  arms. Ahalla's lance had entered his breast just below his throat.</p>

  <p>Adalgoth tore Valerians blue banner out of his belt and tried to stanch
  the streaming blood&mdash;in vain; the bright blue was at once dyed deep
  red.</p>

  <p>"Gothia!" breathed Totila, "Italia! Valeria!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, before the unequal fight could commence, Alboin arrived
  upon the spot with his Longobardians. He had followed the Prefect, not being
  inclined to remain idle while the fight was going on round the walls of
  Taginæ.</p>

  <p>The Longobardian looked silently and with emotion at the corpse of the
  King.</p>

  <p>"He gave me my life&mdash;I could not save his," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>One of his horsemen pointed to the rich armour worn by the dead man.</p>

  <p>"No," said Alboin, "this royal hero must be buried with all his royal
  trappings."</p>

  <p>"There, Alboin, on the rocky height above us," said Adalgoth, "his bride
  and his tomb, self-chosen, have waited for him long."</p>

  <p>"Take him up! I will give safe-conduct to the noble corpse and the noble
  bearers. Now, my men, follow me back to the fight!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-20"
     name="b5b-20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">But the fight was over: as Alboin and the Prefect
  discovered, to their great disgust, when they again reached Taginæ.</p>

  <p>The Prefect, just as he had entered the pine-wood and was about to follow
  the King's track, had been overtaken by a messenger from Liberius, who sent
  word for him to return immediately. Narses was insensible, and the peril of
  the situation necessitated immediate counsel.</p>

  <p>Narses insensible&mdash;Liberius perplexed&mdash;the victory they had
  thought certain, endangered&mdash;these circumstances weighed more with the
  Prefect than the doubtful expectation of dealing the death-stroke to the
  half-dead King.</p>

  <p>In haste Cethegus galloped back to Taginæ the way that he had come. When
  he reached the town he found Liberius, who cried:</p>

  <p>"Too late! I have already settled and agreed to everything. A truce! The
  rest of the Goths march off!"</p>

  <p>"What?" thundered Cethegus&mdash;he would gladly have poured all the blood
  of the Goths upon the grave of his darling as a sacrifice. "They march? A
  truce? Where is Narses?"</p>

  <p>"He lies insensible in his litter; he has been taken with severe
  convulsions. The fright, the surprise&mdash;it prostrated him, and no
  wonder."</p>

  <p>"What surprise? Speak, man!"</p>

  <p>And Liberius briefly related how they had forced their way into Taginæ
  with fearful loss of blood, "for the Goths stood like a wall"&mdash;had been
  obliged to storm house by house, even room by room&mdash;"we were obliged to
  hack to pieces by inches one of their leaders, who ran Anzalas through as he
  leaped into the first breach, before we could force our way into the town
  over his body."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" asked Cethegus earnestly. "I hope Earl Teja?"</p>

  <p>"No; Earl Thorismuth. When we had finished our bloody work, and Narses was
  about to let himself be carried into the town, he met in the gate a messenger
  from our left wing&mdash;which no more exists! It was Zeuxippos, wounded, and
  accompanied by Gothic heralds."</p>

  <p>"Who has&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He whom you just named&mdash;Earl Teja! He guessed or learned that
  Zeuxippos was threatening his centre, that the King was wounded&mdash;and,
  well knowing that he would arrive too late to turn the course of events at
  Taginæ, he came to a bold and desperate resolution. He suddenly gave up his
  post of expectation on the hills, threw himself upon our left wing, which was
  slowly advancing up the hill opposite to him, beat it at the first onset,
  pursued the fugitives into their camp, and there made prisoners of ten
  thousand of our men, and all the captains, amongst them my Orestes and
  Zeuxippos. He sent Gothic heralds to Narses, who took Zeuxippos with them to
  witness to the truth of what they said, and demanded an immediate truce of
  twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Otherwise he swore to slay all his ten thousand prisoners&mdash;-together
  with the captains."</p>

  <p>"That is no matter," observed Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"It may be no matter to you, Roman&mdash;what matters to you a myriad of
  our troops?&mdash;but not so to Narses. The terrible surprise, the still more
  terrible necessity of making a choice, quite prostrated him. A severe attack
  of his malady came on, and as he sank down, he gave me his commander's staff,
  and I, of course, accepted the conditions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, Pylades must save Orestes!" said Cethegus in a rage.</p>

  <p>"And, besides, ten thousand men of the imperial army!"</p>

  <p>"I am not bound by this agreement," cried Cethegus; "I shall again
  attack."</p>

  <p>"You dare not! Teja has taken most of his prisoners and all the captains
  with him as hostages&mdash;he will slay them if another arrow be shot?"</p>

  <p>"Let him slay them! I shall attack."</p>

  <p>"See whether the Byzantines will follow you! I at once communicated the
  order of Narses to your troops: for now <i>I</i> am Narses."</p>

  <p>"You shall die, as soon as Narses has recovered his senses!"</p>

  <p>But Cethegus perceived that he could do nothing against the Goths with his
  mercenaries alone. For when Teja had retreated to the cloister and chapel
  hill and the Flaminian Way with his prisoners, and Hildebrand's wing had also
  reached the road with little loss of life&mdash;for the two rivers, and then
  the news of the truce, had checked the pursuit attempted by
  Johannes&mdash;the Goths had gathered the rest of their troops together and
  taken up a safe position.</p>

  <p>Cethegus waited with impatience for the recovery of Narses, who he hoped
  would never acknowledge the agreement concluded by his representative.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b5b-21"
     name="b5b-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile Teja and Hildebrand had arrived upon the chapel
  hill, whither, as they had been apprised, the wounded King had been
  carried.</p>

  <p>News of later events had not yet reached them.</p>

  <p>Before they entered the walls which enclosed the grove before the chapel,
  the two leaders had agreed upon the plan which they would propose to the
  King. There was no other way but to retreat to the south under the protection
  of the truce. But when they entered the grove, what a sight met their
  view!</p>

  <p>Sobbing loudly, Adalgoth hurried up to Teja, and led him to an ancient and
  ivy-grown sarcophagus. Within it, upon his shield, lay King Totila. The
  majesty of death gave to his noble features a solemnity that made them more
  beautiful than they had ever been when brightened by joy.</p>

  <p>On his left hand rested Julius, in the open hollow cover of the
  sarcophagus, which had long since fallen from its proper place. Under the
  common shadow of death, the resemblance between the "Dioscuri" was more
  striking and touching than ever.</p>

  <p>And between the two friends lay a third form, which had been carefully
  laid by Gotho and Liuta upon the King's blood-stained mantle. Upon a
  gently-rising mound lay Valeria, the Roman virgin.</p>

  <p>Fetched from the neighbouring cloister to receive her lover, she had
  thrown herself, without a scream, without even a sigh, upon the broad shield
  with its solemn burthen, which Adalgoth and Aligern were carrying through the
  gate with sad and slow steps. Before any one could speak, she had cried:</p>

  <p>"I know all&mdash;he is dead!"</p>

  <p>She had assisted them to lay the corpse in the sarcophagus, and while so
  occupied she had repeated to herself, in a low voice, these words:</p>

  <p>"'Him too thou seest, how stalwart, tall, and fair! Yet must he yield to
  death and stubborn fate, Whene'er, at morn or noon or eve, the spear Or arrow
  from the bow may rend his life. Then may I, too, visit th' eternal
  shades!"</p>

  <p>Then, without haste, quietly and slowly, she drew a dagger from her
  girdle, and with the words, "Here, stern Christian God, take my soul! thus I
  fulfil the vow!" the Roman maiden thrust the sharp steel into her bosom.</p>

  <p>Cassiodorus, a little cross of cedar in his hand, went, deeply
  moved&mdash;the tears trickled down his venerable white beard&mdash;from
  corpse to corpse, repeating the prayers of the Church.</p>

  <p>And the pious women of the cloister, who had accompanied Valeria, began
  the simple and noble chant:</p>

  <p>"Vis ac splendor seculorum, Belli laus et flos amorum Labefacta mox
  marcescunt; Dei laus et gratia sine Ævi termino vel fine In eternum
  perflorescunt."</p>

  <p>Gradually the grove had become filled with warriors, who had followed
  their leaders. Among them were Earls Wisand and Markja.</p>

  <p>Teja heard the report of the weeping Adalgoth in silence. Then he went
  close to the King's corpse. Without a tear, he laid his mailed right hand
  upon the King's wounded breast, bent over him, and whispered:</p>

  <p>"I will complete the work."</p>

  <p>Then he went back and took his place under a mighty tree, which rose above
  a forgotten grave-mound, and spoke to the little group of soldiers who stood
  silently and reverently round the dead.</p>

  <p>"Gothic men! the battle is lost, and the kingdom likewise. Whoever will
  now go to Narses, whoever will subject himself to the Emperor, I will not
  keep him back. But I am resolved to fight to the end; not for victory, but to
  die the free death of a hero. Whoever wishes to share this fate with me, may
  remain. You all wish it? 'Tis well."</p>

  <p>Hildebrand interposed.</p>

  <p>"The King has fallen. The Goths cannot&mdash;even to die&mdash;fight
  without a King. Athalaric, Witichis, Totila&mdash;<i>one</i> only can be the
  fourth; only one is worthy to succeed these three; thou, Teja, our last, our
  greatest hero!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Teja; "I will be your King. Under me you shall not live
  joyfully; you shall only die greatly. Be still! No cry of joy, no clang of
  arms must greet me. Whoever will have me for his King, let him do as I
  do."</p>

  <p>And he broke a small branch from the tree under which he stood, and
  twisted it round his helmet. All silently followed his example.</p>

  <p>Adalgoth, who stood next him, whispered:</p>

  <p>"O King Teja! it is a cypress bough! Thus is crowned a victim doomed to
  sacrifice!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my Adalgoth, thou speakest prophecy;" and Teja swung his sword in a
  circle round his head. "Doomed to death!"</p>

  <p class="cp">"I have now to describe a most remarkable battle,<br>
  and the high heroism of the man<br>
  who was inferior to none of the heroes&mdash;of Teja."<br>
  &mdash;<i>Procopius: Gothic War</i>, iv. 35.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b6-1"
     name="b6-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">The destiny of the Goths was soon to be fulfilled. The
  rolling stone approached the abyss.</p>

  <p>When Narses came to his senses and learned what had taken place, he gave
  orders at once to arrest Liberius and send him to Byzantium to answer for his
  conduct.</p>

  <p>"I will not say," he said to his confidant, Basiliskos, "that he has come
  to a false decision. I myself could not have done otherwise. But I should
  have done it for different reasons. <i>His</i> only wish was to save his
  friend and the ten thousand prisoners. That was wrong. Situated as he was, he
  ought to have sacrificed them, for he could not overlook the actual condition
  of the war. He did not know, as I know, that after this battle the Gothic
  kingdom is lost&mdash;whether it be completely destroyed at Rome or Neapolis
  is indifferent&mdash;and that alone would have been, and is, the reason for
  which the ten thousand should be saved."</p>

  <p>"At Neapolis? But why not at Rome? Do you not remember the formidable
  fortifications of the Prefect? Why should not the Goths throw themselves into
  Rome and resist for months?"</p>

  <p>"Why? Because things are very different with regard to Rome. But the Goths
  know this as little as Liberius. And Cethegus&mdash;above all&mdash;must know
  nothing of it yet; therefore be silent. Where is the Prefect of Rome?"</p>

  <p>"He has hastened forward, in order to be the first to conduct the pursuit
  as soon as the time of truce has expired."</p>

  <p>"Surely you have taken care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not doubt it! He would have marched with his Isaurians alone, but
  I&mdash;that is, Liberius at my order&mdash;gave him Alboin and the
  Longobardians as companions, and you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Narses, with a smile, "my wolves will not lose sight of
  him."</p>

  <p>"But how long shall he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As long as he is necessary to me; not an hour longer. So the young and
  royal wonder-worker lies upon his shield! Now may Justinian rightly call
  himself 'Gothicus,' and again sleep peacefully. But truly&mdash;he will never
  more sleep peacefully&mdash;that disappointed widower&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So the two generals, Narses and Teja, were of one opinion with regard to
  the Gothic kingdom. It was lost. The flower of the Goths had fallen at Capræ
  and Taginæ. Totila had placed there five-and-twenty thousand men; not even a
  thousand had escaped. The two wings of the army had also suffered great loss;
  and so King Teja commenced his retreat to the south with scarcely twenty
  thousand men.</p>

  <p>He was urged to the greatest speed by the calls for help sent by the
  little army under Duke Guntharis and Earl Grippa, who were hard pressed by
  the greater force of the Byzantines under the command of Armatus and
  Dorotheos, who had landed between Rome and Neapolis.</p>

  <p>And besides this, Teja's retreat was also precipitated because of the
  terrible manner in which, when the truce was ended, he was pursued by
  Narses.</p>

  <p>While the Longobardians and Cethegus pursued the fugitives without pause,
  Narses slowly followed with the main army, spreading to the right and left
  his two formidable wings, which extended in the south-west far beyond the
  Sub-urbicarian Tuscany to the Tyrrhenian sea, and in the north-east through
  Picenum to the Ionian Gulf, extinguishing as they passed from north to south
  and from west to east, every trace of the Goths behind them.</p>

  <p>This proceeding was considerably facilitated by the now general desertion
  of the Gothic cause on the part of the Italians. The benevolent King, who had
  once won their sympathies, had been succeeded by a gloomy hero of terrible
  reputation. And all who hesitated were speedily drawn over to the other side,
  not by inclination to the rule of Byzantium, but from fear of Narses and of
  the Emperor's severity, who threatened all who took the part of the
  barbarians with death.</p>

  <p>The Italians who still served in Teja's army now deserted and hastened to
  Narses. It also happened much more frequently than before the battle of
  Taginæ, that Gothic settlers were betrayed to the Romani by their Italian
  neighbours, generally by the <i>hospes</i>, who had been obliged to
  relinquish a third of his property to the Goths; or, where the Italians were
  in the majority, the Goths were either killed, or taken prisoners and
  delivered up to the two Byzantine fleets, the "Tyrrhenian" and the "Ionian,"
  which, sailing along the coasts of those seas, accompanied the march of the
  land forces and received all the captured Goths on board&mdash;men, women,
  and children.</p>

  <p>The forts and towns, weakly garrisoned&mdash;for Teja had been obliged to
  strengthen his small army by lessening their numbers&mdash;generally fell by
  means of the Italian population, who now overpowered the Gothic garrison, as,
  after Totila's election, they had done the imperial. Thus fell, during the
  progress of the war, Namia, Spoletium and Perusia; the few towns which
  resisted were invested.</p>

  <p>So Narses resembled a strong man who walks with outstretched arms through
  a narrow passage, pursuing all who try to hide themselves before him. Or a
  fisher, who wades up a stream with a sack-net; behind him all is empty. The
  few Goths who could yet save themselves fled before the "iron roller" to the
  army of the King, which soon consisted of a greater number of the defenceless
  than of warriors.</p>

  <p>The Visigoths were again engaged in migration, just as they had been a
  hundred years before, but this time the iron net of Narses was behind them;
  and before them, as they advanced farther and farther into the constantly
  narrowing peninsula, the sea. And not a ship did they possess in which to
  fly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-2"
     name="b6-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">Added to this, an inevitable necessity reduced the number of
  Goths in the King's army capable of bearing arms in the most frightful
  manner.</p>

  <p>From the very commencement of the pursuit, Cethegus, with his mercenaries,
  and Alboin with his Longobardians, had stuck to the heels of the fugitives,
  and consequently, if the retreat of the Gothic army&mdash;already delayed by
  the number of women, children, and aged people who had joined it&mdash;was
  not to be brought to a complete standstill, it was necessary to sacrifice
  each night a small number of heroes, who halted at some spot suitable for
  their design, and held the pursuers at bay by an obstinate, fearless, and
  hopeless resistance, until the main army had again gained a considerable
  advance.</p>

  <p>This cruel, but only possible expedient, always entailed the loss of at
  least fifty men, and often, where the place to be defended had a wider front,
  a much greater number.</p>

  <p>Before King Teja marched from Spes Bonorum, he had explained this plan to
  the assembled army; his faithful troops silently assented to it. And every
  morning the "death-doomed" volunteered so eagerly to join this forlorn hope,
  that King Teja&mdash;with humid eyes&mdash;made them draw lots, not wishing
  to offend any one by the preference of others. For the Goths, who saw nothing
  before them but the certain destruction of the nation, and many of whom knew
  that their wives and children had fallen into the enemy's hands, vied with
  each other in seeking death.</p>

  <p>So their retreat became a triumphal procession of Gothic heroes, and every
  halting-place a monument of courageous self-sacrifice. Thus, among the
  leaders of the "doomed rear-guard," old Haduswinth fell near Nuceria
  Camellaria; the young and skilful archer, Gunthamund, at Ad Fontes; and the
  swift rider, Gudila, at Ad Martis. But these sacrifices, and the King's
  generalship, were not without influence on the fate of the nation.</p>

  <p>Near Fossatum, between Tudera and Narnia, a night attack took place
  between the rear-guard under Earl Markja, and the horsemen of Cethegus, which
  lasted from afternoon till sunrise.</p>

  <p>When at last the returning light illumined the hastily-constructed
  earthworks thrown up by the Goths, they were as still and silent as the
  grave.</p>

  <p>The pursuers advanced with the utmost caution. At last Cethegus sprang
  from his horse and on to the parapet of the earthworks, followed by
  Syphax.</p>

  <p>Cethegus turned and signed to his men: "Follow me; there is no danger! You
  have only to step over the bodies of our enemies, for here they all
  lie&mdash;a full thousand. Yonder is Earl Markja; I know him."</p>

  <p>But when the earthworks were demolished, and Cethegus and his horsemen
  continued their pursuit of the main army&mdash;which had gained a great
  advance they soon learned from the peasants of the neighbourhood that the
  Gothic army had not passed on the Flaminian Way at all.</p>

  <p>By the noble sacrifice of this night, King Teja had been enabled to
  conceal the further direction of his retreat, and the pursuers had lost the
  scent.</p>

  <p>Cethegus advised Johannes and Alboin, the one to send a portion of his men
  to the south-east, the other to the left on the Flaminian Way, to try to find
  the lost track. He himself longed to get to Rome. He wished to reach that
  city before Narses. Once there, he hoped to be able to checkmate him, as he
  had done Belisarius, from the Capitol.</p>

  <p>After discovering that King Teja had evaded all pursuit, Cethegus summoned
  his trusty tribunes, and told them that he was resolved&mdash;if necessary,
  by force&mdash;to rid himself of the constant supervision of Alboin and
  Johannes&mdash;who were at present weakened by the division of their troops
  at his advice&mdash;and to hasten with his Isaurians alone straight to Rome
  by the Flaminian Way, which was now no longer blocked by the Goths.</p>

  <p>But even while he was speaking, he was interrupted by the entrance of
  Syphax, who led into the tent a Roman citizen, whom he had with difficulty
  rescued from the hands of the Longobardians. The man had asked for the
  Prefect, and the Longobardians had answered, laughing, that they would treat
  him (the messenger) "as usual."</p>

  <p>"But," added Syphax, "a great crowd of people is approaching in the rear;
  I will see what it is and bring you word."</p>

  <p>"I know you, Tullus Faber," said the Prefect, turning to the messenger,
  when Syphax had left him; "you were ever faithful to Rome and to me. What
  news do you bring?"</p>

  <p>"O Prefect!" cried the man, "we all thought you were dead, for you sent us
  no answer to eight several messages."</p>

  <p>"I have not received even one!"</p>

  <p>"Then you do not know what has happened in Rome? Pope Silverius has died
  in exile in Sicily. His successor is Pelagius, your enemy!"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing. Speak!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, you will neither be able to advise nor to help. Rome
  has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Just then Syphax returned, but before he could speak, he was followed into
  the tent by Narses, supported by Basiliskos.</p>

  <p>"You have allowed yourself to be detained here so long by a thousand
  Gothic spears," said the commander-in-chief angrily, "that the healthy have
  escaped, and the sick have overtaken you. This King Teja can do more than
  break shields; he can weave veils with which to blind the Prefect's sharp
  sight. But I see through many veils, and also through this. Johannes, call
  your people back. Teja cannot have gone south, he must have gone northwards,
  for he, no doubt, has known long since that which concerns the Prefect most:
  Rome is wrested from the Goths."</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked at him with sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"I had smuggled a few clever men into the city. They excited the
  inhabitants to a midnight revolt. All the Goths in the city were slain; only
  five hundred men escaped into the Mausoleum of Hadrian, and continue to
  defend it."</p>

  <p>Faber took courage to put in a word.</p>

  <p>"We sent eight messengers to you. Prefect, one after the other."</p>

  <p>"Away with this man!" cried Narses, signing to his officers. "Yes," he
  continued quietly, "the citizens of Rome think lovingly of the Prefect, to
  whom they owe so much: two sieges, hunger, pestilence, and the burning of the
  Capitol! But the messengers sent to you always lost their way, and fell into
  the hands of the Longobardians, who, no doubt, slew them. But the embassy
  sent to me by the Holy Father, Pelagius, reached me safely, and I have
  concluded an agreement, of which you, Prefect of Rome, will surely
  approve."</p>

  <p>"In any case, I shall not be able to annul it."</p>

  <p>"The good citizens of Rome fear nothing so much as a third siege. They
  have stipulated that we shall undertake nothing that can lead to another
  fight for their city. They write that the Goths in the Mausoleum will soon
  succumb to hunger; that they themselves can defend their walls; and they have
  sworn only to deliver up their city, after the destruction of those Goths, to
  their natural protector and chief, the Prefect of Rome. Are you content with
  that, Cethegus? Read the agreement. Give it to him, Basiliskos."</p>

  <p>Cethegus read the paper with deep and joyful emotion. So they had not
  forgotten him, his Romans! So now, when everything was coming to a crisis,
  they called, not the hated Byzantines, but himself, their patron, back to the
  Capitol! He again felt at the height of power.</p>

  <p>"I am content," he said, returning the roll.</p>

  <p>"I have promised," continued Narses, "to make no attempt to get the city
  into my power by force. First King Teja must follow King Totila. Then
  Rome&mdash;and many other things. Accompany me, Prefect, to the council of
  war."</p>

  <p>When Cethegus left the council in the tent of Narses, and asked after
  Tullus Faber, not a trace of the latter was to be found.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-3"
     name="b6-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Narses, that great general, had acutely guessed in what
  direction King Teja had turned aside from the Flaminian Way. He had first
  gone north towards the coast of the Ionian Gulf, and thence, with singular
  knowledge of the roads, had led his fugitive people and army by a circuitous
  route past Hadria, Aternum, and Ortona, to Samnium. That Rome was lost, he
  had learned beyond Nuceria Camellaria from some Goths who had fled from that
  city.</p>

  <p>The King, whose impatient and unsparing disposition ever looked forward to
  the end, not unwillingly found himself obliged to get rid of his
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>In number about as strong as their conquerors, the captives had made the
  office of guarding them so difficult, that Teja threatened to punish with
  death any attempt at escape.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding, when the army marched northwards, a number of these
  prisoners made an attempt to free themselves by force. Very many were killed
  in the struggle that ensued, and the King ordered that all the rest, together
  with Orestes and the whole of the officers, should be thrown into the Aternus
  with their hands bound; where they died miserably by drowning.</p>

  <p>When Adalgoth begged Teja to revoke his cruel sentence, the latter
  replied:</p>

  <p>"Did they not fall upon our defenceless women and children in their
  peaceful homes, and slay them? This is no longer a war between warriors; it
  is nation murdering nation. Let us do our part."</p>

  <p>From Samnium the King, leaving his unarmed people to follow slowly under
  scanty escort&mdash;for they were threatened by no pursuit&mdash;hurried
  forward with his best troops to Campania. His arrival in those parts was so
  unexpected, that he not only surprised Duke Guntharis and Earl Grippa, whose
  small army had melted still more in consequence of frequent battles with
  superior forces, but, shortly after, the enemy also, who now had thought
  themselves sure of victory.</p>

  <p>He had found Duke Guntharis and Earl Grippa occupying a secure position
  between Neapolis and Beneventum. He learned that the Romani were threatening
  Cumæ from Capua.</p>

  <p>"They shall not reach that city before me," he cried; "I have to complete
  there an important work."</p>

  <p>And, his army being now reinforced by the garrison of his own county town
  of Tarentum, under the command of brave Ragnaris, he surprised the superior
  force of the Byzantines, which was about to march upon Cumæ, and defeated
  them with great loss. He himself slew the Archon Armatus with his battle-axe,
  and at his side young Adalgoth ran Dorotheos through with his spear. The
  Byzantines were routed, and fled northwards to Terracina.</p>

  <p>It was the last ray of sunshine cast by the God of Victory upon the blue
  banner of the Goths.</p>

  <p>The next day King Teja entered Cumæ. Totila, upon his last fatal march
  from Rome, had decided, at the instance of Teja, and contrary to his custom,
  to take with him hostages from that city. No one knew what had become of
  them.</p>

  <p>On the evening of his entry into Cumæ, King Teja ordered the walled-up
  garden of the Castle of Cumæ to be broken open. There were hidden the
  hostages from Rome: patricians and senators&mdash;among them Maximus,
  Cyprianus, Opilio, Rusticus, and Fidelius, the most distinguished men of the
  Senate&mdash;in all they numbered three hundred. All were members of the old
  league against the Goths.</p>

  <p>Teja ordered the Goths who had lately escaped from Rome to tell these
  hostages how the Romans, persuaded by envoys sent by Narses, had one night
  risen in revolt, had murdered all the Goths upon whom they could lay hands,
  even the women and children, and had driven the rest into the <i>Moles
  Hadriani</i>.</p>

  <p>The King fastened such a terrible look upon the trembling hostages, as
  they listened to this news, that two of them could not endure to wait till
  the end, but then and there killed themselves by dashing their heads against
  the stony walls which surrounded them.</p>

  <p>When the Goths from Rome had sworn to the truth of their story, the King
  silently turned away and left the garden. An hour after, the heads of the
  three hundred hostages stared ghastly down from the summit of the walls.</p>

  <p>"It was not alone to fulfil this terrible judgment that I came here," Teja
  said to Adalgoth: "I have also to reveal a sacred secret."</p>

  <p>And he invited him and the other leaders of the troops to a solemn and
  joyless midnight banquet. When the sad feast was over, the King made a sign
  to old Hildebrand, who nodded, and took a dimly burning torch from the iron
  ring into which it was stuck on the centre column of the vaulted hall,
  saying:</p>

  <p>"Follow me, children of these latter days, and take your shields with
  you."</p>

  <p>It was the third hour of the July night; the stars glittered in the sky.
  Out of the hall, silently following the King and the aged master-at-arms,
  there stepped Guntharis and Adalgoth, Aligern, Grippa, Ragnaris, and Wisand
  the standard-bearer. Wachis, the King's shield-bearer, closed the procession,
  carrying a second torch.</p>

  <p>Opposite the castle garden rose an ancient round tower, named the Tower of
  Theodoric, because that great King had restored it. Old Hildebrand was the
  first to enter this tower with his torch, but instead of leaving the
  ground-floor, which contained only the empty tower-room, the old man halted,
  knelt down, and carefully measured fifteen spans of his large hand from the
  door, which he had closed behind them, to the centre of the room. The whole
  floor seemed to be composed of three colossal slabs of granite. When
  Hildebrand had measured the fifteen spans, he held his thumb upon the spot at
  which he had arrived, and struck his battle-axe against the floor; it sounded
  hollow. Boring the point of his axe into a scarcely-visible crack in the
  stone, he signed to his companions to stand aside on his left; when they had
  done so, he pushed a portion of the slab to the right. A chasm, as deep as
  the tower was high above them, revealed itself to the astonished eyes of
  those present.</p>

  <p>The opening was only large enough to admit one man at a time. It led to a
  narrow flight of more than two hundred steps, hewn in the living rock.</p>

  <p>Silently, at a sign from Hildebrand, the men descended. When they arrived
  at the bottom, they found that the circular space was divided in the middle
  by a stone wall. The semicircle into which they had entered was empty.</p>

  <p>And now King Teja measured ten spans on the wall to the centre, and
  pressing his hand upon a stone, a small door opened inwards. Hildebrand
  entered with his torch, and kindled two others which were fixed upon the
  wall.</p>

  <p>The observers started back dazzled, and covered their eyes with their
  hands. When they again looked up, they recognised&mdash;at once guessing the
  secret&mdash;the whole rich treasure of Dietrich of Berne.</p>

  <p>There lay, partly heaped up symmetrically, partly thrown in disorder one
  upon another, weapons, vessels, and ornaments of all kinds. Strong Etruscan
  steel-caps of ancient times, brought by the commerce of the Goths as far as
  the Baltic, or to the Pruth and Dniester, and now brought back to the south
  by the migration of the nations, probably near to the very spot where they
  had been fashioned. Near these lay flat wooden head-pieces, over which was
  stretched the skin of the seal, or the jaws of the ice-bear; pointed Celtic
  helmets; high-crested helms from Rome or Byzantium; neck-rings of bronze and
  iron, of silver and gold. Shields&mdash;from the clumsy wooden shield, as
  tall as a man, which was set up like a wall to hide the archer, to the small
  round and ornamented horseman's shield of the Parthians, studded with pearls
  and precious stones. Ancient ring-mail of crushing weight, and light-padded
  clothing of purple-coloured linen, besides scimitars, swords and daggers, of
  stone, bronze, and steel. Axes and clubs of all kinds&mdash;from those rudely
  made from the bones of the mammoth and tied to the antler of a stag with
  bast, to the Frankish <i>franciska</i>, and the small perforated and gilded
  axe with which the Roman circus-riders used to split an apple while at full
  gallop. Spears, lances, and darts of all sorts&mdash;from the roughly carved
  tusk of the narwal, to the ebony shaft, inlaid with gold, of the Asdingian
  Vandal Kings in Carthage, and the massive golden arrows of these princes,
  with steel points a foot long, and the shafts decorated with the purple
  feathers of the flamingo. War-mantles&mdash;made of the fur of the black fox,
  the skin of the Numidian lion, and the costliest purple of Sidon.
  Shoes&mdash;from the long shovel-shaped snowshoes of the Skrito Fins, to the
  golden sandals of Byzantium. Doublets of Frisian wool, and tunics of Chinese
  silk. Innumerable vessels and table utensils&mdash;tall vases, flat salvers,
  cups, and round-bellied urns, of amber, of gold, of silver, of
  tortoise-shell. Arm-rings and shoulder-clasps, necklaces of pearls and of
  crystal beads, and innumerable other utensils for meat and drink, for
  clothing and decoration, for sport and war.</p>

  <p>"This secret cave," said Teja, "known only to us, the blood
  brethren&mdash;the master-at-arms caused it to be hewn in the rock when he
  was Earl of Cumæ, forty years ago&mdash;was the vault in which was hidden the
  treasure of the Goths. This is the reason why Belisarius found so little,
  when he ransacked the treasure-house at Ravenna. The most costly pieces of
  booty, the gifts, the collection of Amelung trophies in war and peace, which
  existed long before Theodoric, in the time of Winithar, Ermanarich, Athal,
  Ostrogotho, Isarna, Amala, and Gaut&mdash;all these have we concealed here.
  We left nothing in Ravenna but the minted gold, and such things as seemed
  richer in intrinsic value than in honour. For months our enemies have walked
  above these treasures; but the faithful abyss kept the secret. But now we
  will carry all away with us. Take the treasures on your shields, and hand
  them from one to another up the steps. We will take it to the last
  battle-field upon which an Ostrogothic army will ever fight. No, do not be
  anxious, young Adalgoth; even when I have fallen, and all is lost, the enemy
  shall not bear away the sacred treasure to Byzantium. For wonderful is the
  last battle-field which I have chosen; it shall conceal and swallow up the
  last of the Goths, their treasure and their fame!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and their greatest treasure and noblest renown," said old
  Hildebrand; "not merely gold and silver and precious stones. Look here, my
  Goths!"</p>

  <p>And he held his torch towards a curtain which shut off a portion of the
  treasure-cave, and pushed the curtain to one side. As he did so, all present
  fell upon their knees. For they recognised the great dead, who sat, erect and
  clothed in purple, upon a golden throne, the spear still grasped in his right
  hand.</p>

  <p>It was the great Theodoric.</p>

  <p>The art which had been introduced to the Romans by the Egyptians&mdash;the
  art of embalming the dead&mdash;had preserved the body of the hero-King with
  terrible perfection.</p>

  <p>All present were struck dumb with emotion.</p>

  <p>"Many years ago," at last Hildebrand began, "Teja and I mistrusted the
  good fortune of the Goths. And I, who, before the breaking out of the war,
  had the command of the guard-of-honour at the Mausoleum of Ravenna, in which
  Amalaswintha had interred her dead father&mdash;I liked the building but
  little, and still less the incense-scented priests who so often prayed there
  for the soul of my good and great King&mdash;I thought that if ever all trace
  of my nation were rooted out of this southern land, no Italian or Greekling
  should mock at the remains of our beloved hero. No! even as the first great
  conqueror of the Roman fortress, Alaric the Visigoth, found his unknown and
  never to be dishonoured tomb in the sacred bed of the stream, so also should
  my great King be delivered from the curiosity of posterity. And, with Teja's
  help, I took the noble corpse away by night, from its marble house, and from
  the vicinity of the whining priests, and we brought it hither, as part of the
  royal treasure. Here it was safe. And if, after the lapse of centuries, some
  accident should betray its resting-place, who could then recognise the King
  with the eagle-eye? And so the sarcophagus at Ravenna is empty, and the monks
  sing and pray in vain. Here, near his treasures and his trophies, in hero
  splendour, erect upon his throne, he rests; it is more pleasing to his soul,
  which looks down from Walhalla, than to see his mortal remains stretched out,
  weighed down by heavy stones, and surrounded with clouds of incense."</p>

  <p>"But now," concluded Teja, "the hour has come for him once more to rise
  from the abyss. When you have raised the treasure, we will carefully lift up
  this beloved form. Early to-morrow we will march out of this city. The
  approach of Narses and the Prefect has already been announced. We will go,
  with royal corpse and royal treasure, to the last battle-field of the Goths,
  whither I have already sent the women and children. The
  battle-field&mdash;long ago I saw it in the visions of my sleepless
  nights&mdash;the battle-field whereon we and our nation will gloriously
  perish; the battlefield which, even when the last spear is broken, can save
  and hide all who do not fear to die in its glowing bosom; the battle-field
  which Teja has chosen for you and for himself!"</p>

  <p>"I guess thy meaning," whispered Adalgoth; "this last battle-field
  is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mons Vesuvius!" said Teja. "To work!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-4"
     name="b6-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">As rapidly as his fearful, all-encompassing system would
  allow, Narses, after the council which we have mentioned as taking place at
  Fossatum, had marched southward with his whole force and with the broadest
  front, in order to make an end of all the remaining Goths. Only to Tuscany
  did he send two small detachments, under his generals, Vitalianus and
  Wilmuth, to take such forts as still resisted, and, after them, Lucca, in
  Annonarian Tuscany. Valerianus, who had meanwhile conquered Petra Pertusa,
  which place blocked the Flaminian Way beyond Helvillum, was sent still
  farther north against Verona, the obstinate defence of which had enabled many
  Goths to escape up the valley of the Athesis to the Passara.</p>

  <p>With these exceptions, Narses hurried south with the whole of his army. He
  himself passed Rome on the Flaminian Way; while Johannes, on the coast of the
  Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Herulian Vulkaris on that of the Ionian Gulf, were to
  drive the Goths before them.</p>

  <p>But Johannes and Vulkaris found but little work to do; for in the north
  the Gothic families had already been received, in passing, into the mass of
  the army of the King, which it was now impossible to overtake; and from the
  south the Goths had likewise long since streamed past Rome to Neapolis,
  whither expresses from the King had bidden them to repair. "Mons Vesuvius!"
  was the rallying word for all these Gothic fugitives.</p>

  <p>Narses had named Anagnia to his two wings as the point of reunion with the
  main body.</p>

  <p>Cethegus gladly accepted the commander's invitation to remain with him in
  the centre, for he could expect no great events with the two wings; and the
  road taken by Narses led past Rome. In case that the commander, in spite of
  his promise, should attempt to procure entrance into Rome, Cethegus would be
  on the spot.</p>

  <p>But, almost to the Prefect's astonishment, Narses kept his word. He
  quietly marched his army past Rome. And he called upon Cethegus to be witness
  to his interview with Pope Pelagius and the other governing bodies of Rome,
  which interview took place below the walls at the Porta Belisaria (Pinceana),
  between the Flaminian and Salarian Gates.</p>

  <p>Once more the Pope and the Romans assured Narses&mdash;swearing by the
  holy remains of Cosma and Damian (according to legend, Arabian physicians who
  were martyred under Diocletian), which were brought in silver and ivory
  caskets to the walls&mdash;that they would unhesitatingly, after the
  annihilation of the Goths in the Moles Hadriani, open their gates to the
  Prefect of Rome, but firmly resist any attempt on the part of the Byzantines
  to enter the city by force; for they would not expose themselves to any
  possible struggle which might yet take place.</p>

  <p>The offer of Narses to leave them at once a few thousand armed men, in
  order to enable them the more speedily to reduce the Moles Hadriani, was
  civilly but decidedly refused, to the great joy of the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"They have learned two things during the last few years," he said to
  Lucius Licinius, as they rode away at the termination of the
  interview&mdash;"to keep the Romani at a distance, and to connect Cethegus
  with the well-being of Rome. That is already a great deal."</p>

  <p>"I regret, my general," said Lucius Licinius, "that I cannot share your
  joy and confidence."</p>

  <p>"I neither," cried Salvius Julianus. "I fear Narses; I mistrust him."</p>

  <p>"Oho! what wise men!" laughed Piso. "One should exaggerate nothing; not
  even prudence. Has not everything turned out better than we dared to hope
  since the night when a shepherd-boy struck the greatest Roman poet upon his
  immortal verse-writing hand, and the great Prefect of Rome swam down the
  Tiber in a granary?&mdash;since Massurius Sabinus was recognised by Earl
  Markja, dressed in the garments of his Hetares, in which disguise he was
  about to make his escape?&mdash;and since the great jurist, Salvius Julianus,
  was rudely fished up, bleeding, from the slime of the river by Duke
  Guntharis? Who would have thought then that we should ever be able to count
  upon our fingers the day when not a single Goth would be left to tread
  Italian soil?"</p>

  <p>"You are right, poet," said Cethegus with a smile; "these two friends of
  ours suffer from '<i>Narses</i>-fever,' as their hero suffers from epilepsy.
  To over-rate one's enemy is also a failing. The holy remains upon which those
  priests have sworn, are really sacred to them; they will not break such an
  oath."</p>

  <p>"If I had only seen, besides the priests and artisans," replied Licinius,
  "any of our friends upon the walls! But there were none but fullers,
  butchers, and carpenters! Where is the aristocracy of Rome? Where are the men
  of the Catacombs?"</p>

  <p>"Taken away as hostages," said Cethegus. "And they were rightly served?
  Did they not return to Rome, and do homage to the fair-haired Goth? If now
  the 'Black Earl' cuts off their heads, it cannot be helped. Be comforted; you
  see things in too dark a light, all of you. The crushing superiority of
  Narses has made you timid. He is a great general; but the fact that he has
  made this treaty with Rome&mdash;this agreement that I, and no other, should
  be admitted&mdash;and that he has <i>kept</i> it, shows that he is harmless
  as a statesman. Let us but once again breathe the air of the Capitol! It does
  not agree with epileptic subjects."</p>

  <p>And when, the next morning, the young tribunes went to fetch the Prefect
  from his tent to join the united march against Teja, their leader received
  them with sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well," he cried, "who knows the Romans best, you or the Prefect of Rome?
  Listen&mdash;but be silent. Last night a centurion, one of the newly-formed
  city cohorts, named Publius Macer, stole out of Rome and into my tent. The
  Pope has entrusted to his care the Porta Latina, to that of his brother
  Marcus, the Capitol. He showed me both commissions&mdash;I know the
  handwriting of Pelagius&mdash;they are authentic. The Romans are long since
  tired of the rule of the priesthood. They would rejoice once more to see me,
  and you, and my Isaurians patrolling the walls. Publius left me his nephew
  Aulus, at once as a hostage and a pledge, who will let us know the
  night&mdash;which will be announced to him in the harmless words of a letter
  agreed upon beforehand&mdash;on which the Romans will open to us their gates
  and the Capitol. Narses cannot complain if the Romans voluntarily admit
  us&mdash;I shall use no force. Now, Licinius! Tell me, Julianus, who best
  knows Rome and the Romans?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-5"
     name="b6-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Narses now marched to Anagnia. Two days after his arrival,
  his two wings reached that place according to order. After some days occupied
  in resting, mustering, and newly ordering his immense forces, the
  commander-in-chief marched to Terracina, where the remainder of the troops of
  Armatus and Dorotheos joined him. And now the united army rolled forward
  against the Goths, who had taken up a most excellent and secure position on
  Vesuvius, on the opposite mountain. Mons Lactarius, and on both shores of the
  little river Draco, which flowed into the sea north of Stabiæ.</p>

  <p>Since he had left Cumæ, marched past Neapolis (the citizens of which place
  shut their strong gates, which had been restored by Totila, overpowered the
  garrison and declared that, following the example of Rome, they would at
  present hold their fortress against both parties), and reached his chosen
  battle-field, King Teja had done all that was possible to make his naturally
  strong position still stronger.</p>

  <p>He had caused provisions to be carried from the fertile country around up
  to the mountains, in sufficient quantities to nourish his people until the
  light of the last day should dawn upon his nation.</p>

  <p>It has ever been a vain task for learned investigation to attempt to find
  on Mons Lactarius or Vesuvius the exact spots which correspond to the
  description of Procopius. It is impossible to fix upon any one of the
  innumerable ravines and valleys. And yet the description of the Byzantine
  historian, grounded as it was upon the verbal reports of the leaders and
  generals of the army of Narses, cannot be doubted.</p>

  <p>Rather may the contradictions be simply explained by the sudden, forcible
  and gigantic changes, and by the still more numerous, gradual and slighter
  alterations made in the face of the country by streams of lava, landslips,
  the crumbling of the rocks, and floods which have taken place upon that never
  quiet mountain, during the course of more than thirteen centuries. Even
  credible accounts of much later Italian authors, concerning places and
  positions on Mount Vesuvius, cannot always be reconciled with the
  reality.</p>

  <p>The ground which sucked up Teja's life-blood has no doubt been covered,
  ages ago, by deep layers of silent and impenetrable lava.</p>

  <p>Even Narses was compelled to admire the circumspection with which his
  barbarian adversary had chosen his last place of defence.</p>

  <p>"He intends to die like the bear in his den," he exclaimed as he observed
  the whole of the Gothic defences from his litter at Nuceria. "And many of
  you, my dear wolves," he added, turning with a smile to Alboin, "will fall
  under the blows of this bear's paws when you try to trot through those narrow
  entrances."</p>

  <p>"Oho! It is only necessary to let so many run in at once that the bear
  gets both paws full and is not able to strike again."</p>

  <p>"Softly, softly! I know of a pass on Vesuvius&mdash;long ago, when I still
  nursed my miserable body hoping to restore its strength, I spent weeks
  together upon Mons Lactarius, in order to enjoy the pure air, and at that
  time I firmly impressed upon my memory the pass I speak of; from that
  pass&mdash;if the Goths get into it&mdash;only famine can drive them
  out."</p>

  <p>"That will be tiresome!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing else for it. I have no desire once more to sacrifice a
  myriad of imperial troops in order to stamp out these last sparks."</p>

  <p>And so it happened. Very gradually, gaining each forward step only at a
  great and bloody loss, did Narses draw his net tighter and more tightly
  together. He surrounded in a semicircle every point of the Gothic position,
  on west, north, and east; only on the south, the sea-side, where he himself
  had encamped on the strand, was he able to leave a space undefended, for the
  enemy had no ships whereon to fly or wherewith to procure provisions.</p>

  <p>The "Tyrrhenian" fleet of Narses was already occupied in carrying the
  captive Goths to Byzantium; the "Ionian" was shortly expected; a few vessels
  had been sent to cruise in the Bay of Bajæ and opposite Surrentum. Thus
  Narses, notwithstanding his great superiority, only gradually occupied, with
  obstinate patience and forgetting nothing, Piscinula, Cimiterium, Nola,
  Summa, Melane, Nuceria, Stabiæ, Cumæ, Bajæ, Misenum, Puteoli, and Nesis. And
  presently Neapolis also became alarmed at the power of Narses, and
  voluntarily opened to him its gates.</p>

  <p>From all sides the Byzantines advanced concentrically towards the Gothic
  position. After many furious battles the Byzantines succeeded in driving the
  Goths away from Mons Lactarius and over the river Draco; where the rest of
  the nation encamped upon a level plain above the pass so highly praised by
  Narses, in the immediate vicinity of one of the numerous craters which, at
  that time, surrounded the foot of the principal cone; only rarely, when the
  wind blew from the south-east, suffering from the smoke and sulphurous
  exhalations of the volcano.</p>

  <p>Here, in the innumerable hollows and ravines of the mountain, the unarmed
  people encamped under the open sky, or under the tents and wagons which they
  had brought with them, in the warm August air.</p>

  <p>"The only access to this encampment," writes Procopius, "could be obtained
  by a narrow pass, the southern opening of which was so small that a man
  holding a shield could completely block it up."</p>

  <p>This opening was guarded day and night, each man occupying it for an hour,
  by King Teja himself, Duke Guntharis, Duke Adalgoth, Earl Grippa, Earl
  Wisand, Aligern, Ragnaris, and Wachis. Behind them the pass was filled by a
  hundred warriors, who relieved each other at intervals.</p>

  <p>And so, in accordance with the system pursued by Narses, the whole
  terrible war, the struggle for Rome and Italy, had been dramatically reduced
  to a point; to a battle for a ravine of a foot or two wide on the southern
  point of the so dearly-loved, so obstinately-defended peninsula. Even in the
  historical representation of Procopius, the fate of the Goths resembles the
  last act of a grand and awful tragedy.</p>

  <p>On the shore, opposite to the hill from which the pass was approached,
  Narses had pitched his tents with the Longobardians; on his right Johannes;
  on his left Cethegus.</p>

  <p>The Prefect drew the attention of his tribunes to the fact that Narses, by
  the cession of this position&mdash;Cethegus himself had chosen it&mdash;had
  given either a proof of great imprudence or of complete inoffensiveness of
  intention, "for," said Cethegus, "with this position he has left open the way
  to Rome, which he could easily have prevented, by giving me the command of
  the right wing or of the centre. Hold yourselves in readiness to start
  secretly and at night with all the Isaurians, as soon as a sign is made by
  Rome."</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked Licinius anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I remain here with the dreaded commander. If he had wished to murder
  me&mdash;he could have done so long ago. But it is evident that he has no
  such intention. He will not act against me without just cause. And if I obey
  the call of the Romans, I do not break, I fulfil, our agreement."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-6"
     name="b6-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Above the narrow pass on Vesuvius, which we will call the
  Ravine of the Goths, a small but deep chasm had been formed by the black
  blocks of lava. Within it King Teja had concealed the most sacred possession
  of the nation&mdash;the corpse of King Theodoric and the royal treasure.
  Theodoric's banner was fixed before the mouth of this chasm.</p>

  <p>A purple mantle, stretched upon four spears, formed the dark curtain to
  the rocky chamber which the last King of the Goths had chosen for his royal
  hall. A block of lava, covered with the skin of the black tiger, formed his
  last throne.</p>

  <p>Here King Teja rested, when not called away by his jealously-held post at
  the southern entrance of the Ravine of the Goths; upon which, now from a
  distance with arrows, slings, and hurling&mdash;spears, now close at hand in
  a bold and sudden attack, the outposts of Narses commenced their assaults.
  None of the brave guardians returned home without bringing tokens of such
  attacks upon shield and armour, or leaving signs at the entrance of the
  ravine, in the form of slain enemies.</p>

  <p>This happened so frequently, that the stench arising from the decay of the
  bodies threatened to render any further sojourn in the ravine impossible.
  Narses seemed to have counted upon this circumstance, for, when Basiliskos
  lamented the useless sacrifice, he said, "Perhaps our slain soldiers will be
  more useful after death than during their life." But King Teja ordered that
  the bodies should be thrown by night over the lava cliffs; so that, horribly
  mutilated, they seemed a warning to all who should attempt to follow their
  example. Seeing this, Narses begged to be allowed to send unarmed men to
  fetch away the bodies, a favour which King Teja immediately granted.</p>

  <p>Since retiring into this ravine, the Goths had not lost a single man in
  fight; for only the foremost man in the pass was exposed to the enemy, and,
  supported by the comrades who stood behind him, this guardian had never yet
  been killed.</p>

  <p>One night, after sunset&mdash;it was now the month of September, and all
  traces of the battle at Taginæ were already obliterated; the flowers planted
  by Cassiodorus and the nuns of the cloister round the sarcophagi of King
  Totila, his bride, and his friend, had put forth new shoots&mdash;King Teja,
  who had just been relieved from his post by Wisand, approached his lava hall,
  his spear upon his shoulder. Before the curtain which closed the entrance to
  his rocky chamber, Adalgoth received Teja with a sad smile, and, kneeling,
  offered to him a golden goblet.</p>

  <p>"Let me still fulfil my office of cup-bearer," he said; "who knows how
  long it may last?"</p>

  <p>"Not much longer!" said Teja gravely, as he seated himself. "We will
  remain here, outside the curtain. Look! how magnificently the bay and the
  coast of Surrentum shine in the glowing light left by the setting
  sun&mdash;the blue sea is changed to crimson blood! Truly, the Southland
  could afford no more beauteous frame with which to enclose the last battle of
  the Goths. Well, may the picture be worthy of its setting! The end is coming.
  How wonderfully everything that I foreboded&mdash;dreamed, and sang&mdash;has
  been fulfilled!"</p>

  <p>And the King supported his head upon both his hands. Only when the silver
  tones of a harp was heard, did he again look up. Adalgoth had, unseen,
  fetched the King's small harp from behind the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt hear," he said, "how I have completed thy song of the Ravine;
  or I might have said, how it has completed itself. Dost thou remember that
  night in the wilderness of ivy, marble, and laurel in Rome? It was not a
  battle already fought, a battle of ancient days, of which thou didst sing.
  No! in a spirit of prophecy, thou hast sung our last heroic battle here." And
  he played and sang:</p>

  <p>"Where arise the cliffs of lava, On Vesuvius' glowing side, Tones of
  deepest woe and wailing, Evening's peace and calm deride. For the brave
  dead's direst curses Rest upon the rocky tomb, Where the Gothic hero-nation
  Will fulfil their glorious doom."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Teja, "glorious, my Adalgoth! Of that glory no fate and no
  Narses shall deprive us. The awful judgment, which our beloved Totila
  challenged, has fallen heavily upon himself, his people, and his God. No
  Heavenly Father has, as that noble man imagined, weighed our destinies in a
  just balance. We fall by the thousand treacheries of the Italians and the
  Byzantines, and by the brute superiority of numbers. But <i>how</i> we fall,
  unshaken, proud even in our decay, can be decided by no fate, but only by our
  own worth. And after us? Who after us will rule in this land? Not for long
  these wily Greeks&mdash;and not the native strength of the Italians. Numerous
  tribes of Germans still exist on the other side of the mountains&mdash;and I
  nominate them our heirs and our avengers."</p>

  <p>And he softly took up the harp which Adalgoth had laid down, and sang in a
  low voice as he looked down upon the rapidly darkening sea. The stars
  glittered over his head; and at rare intervals he struck a chord.</p>

  <p>"Extinguished is the brightest star Of our Germanic race! O Dietrich, thou
  beloved of Bern, Thy shield is bruised, defaced. Unblemished truth and
  courage fail&mdash; The coward wins&mdash;the noble fly; Rascals are lords of
  all the world&mdash; Up, Goths, and let us die!</p>

  <p>"O wicked Rome, O southern gleam, O lovely, heavenly blue! O rolling
  blood-stained Tiber-stream&mdash; O Southerns, all untrue! Still cherishes
  the North its sons Of courage true and high; Vengeance will roll its thunders
  soon&mdash; Then, up! and let us die!"</p>

  <p>"The melody pleases me," said Adalgoth; "but is it already finished? What
  is the end?"</p>

  <p>"'The end can only be sung in time to the stroke of the sword," said Teja.
  "Soon, methinks, thou wilt also hear this end." And he rose from his seat.
  "Go, my Adalgoth," he said; "leave me alone. I have already kept thee far too
  long from"&mdash;and he smiled through all his sadness&mdash;"from the
  loveliest of all duchesses. You have but few of such evening hours to spend
  together, my poor children! If I could but save your young and budding
  lives&mdash;&mdash;" He passed his hand across his brow. "Folly!" he then
  cried; "you are but a part of the doomed nation&mdash;perhaps the
  loveliest."</p>

  <p>Adalgoth's eyes had filled with tears as the King mentioned his young
  wife. He now went up to Teja and laid his hand inquiringly upon his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Is there no hope? She is so young!"</p>

  <p>"None," answered Teja; "for no saving angel will come down from heaven. We
  have still a few days before famine commences its inroads. Then I will make a
  speedy end. The warriors shall sally forth and fall in battle."</p>

  <p>"And the women, the children&mdash;the defenceless thousands?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot help them. I am no god. But not a Gothic woman or maiden need
  fall into slavery under the Byzantines, unless they choose shame instead of a
  free death. Look there, my Adalgoth&mdash;in the dark night the glow of the
  mountain is fully seen. Seest thou, there, a hundred paces to the
  right.&mdash;Ha! how splendidly the fiery smoke rushes from the gloomy
  mouth!&mdash;When the last guardian of the pass has fallen&mdash;one leap
  into that abyss&mdash;and no insolent Roman hand shall touch our pure women.
  Thinking of <i>them</i>&mdash;more than of us, for we can fall anywhere
  thinking of the Gothic women, I chose for our last
  battle-field&mdash;Vesuvius!"</p>

  <p>And Adalgoth, no longer weeping, but with enthusiasm, threw himself into
  Teja's arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-7"
     name="b6-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days after Cethegus had taken up his chosen position
  on the left of Narses with his mercenaries, the report came to the camp of
  the Byzantines that the Goths in the Mausoleum of Hadrian had been
  overpowered.</p>

  <p>So now all Rome was in the hands of the Romans; not a single Goth, and, as
  Cethegus exultingly thought, not a single Byzantine, ruled in his Rome.</p>

  <p>If he could now succeed in throwing his Isaurians, under the command of
  the tribunes, into Rome, the Prefect would be in a much more favourable
  position, opposed to Narses, than he had ever been opposed to Belisarius,
  with whom he had been obliged to share the possession of the city.</p>

  <p>One of the messengers who had brought the news from Rome, at the same time
  gave to Aulus, the hostage, a letter from the two centurions, the brothers
  Macer, which ran thus: "The bride has recovered from her long sickness; if
  the bridegroom will come, there is nothing more to hinder the wedding. Come,
  Aulus."</p>

  <p>These were the words fixed upon. Cethegus communicated them to his Roman
  knights.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" cried Lucius. "Now I shall be able to place a monument upon
  the spot where my brave brother fell for Rome and for Cethegus."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Salvius Julianus, "imprescriptible is the Romans' right to
  Rome."</p>

  <p>"But if we are to go secretly, see to it well, Prefect," said Piso, "that
  our departure is concealed so long from the greatest cripple of all times,
  that it will be impossible for him to overtake us."</p>

  <p>"No," said Cethegus, "you shall not depart in secret. I have convinced
  myself that this most prudent of all heroes has placed outposts far beyond
  our position on the left wing. What we considered our outposts are hemmed
  round by <i>his</i>&mdash;occupied by his Longobardian wolves, whom he has
  placed in all directions. Without his consent, you cannot manage your
  departure either by force or deception. It will be far wiser to act openly.
  If he chooses, he can frustrate our plan, for, in any case, he is sure to
  hear of it. But he will have nothing to say against it&mdash;you will see! I
  shall tell him of my resolution, and, depend upon it, he will approve of
  it."</p>

  <p>"General, that is very bold; it is great!"</p>

  <p>"It is the only possible way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right," said Salvius Julianus, after a few moments'
  reflection. "Force and deception are equally impossible; and should Narses
  consent, I will willingly confess that my fears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Were founded upon an over-estimation of the <i>statesman</i> Narses.
  Large numbers have intimidated you, and the certainly not to be
  over-estimated <i>general-ship</i> of the sick man. I confess that before the
  battle of Taginæ the whole horizon threatened thunderstorms; but, as I am
  still alive, those appearances must have been illusive. I will at once send
  you with my inquiry to Narses. You are suspicious, you will therefore observe
  sharply. Go, tell him that the Romans have resolved to admit me, their
  Prefect, within their walls <i>now</i>, before the annihilation of Teja's
  army. And I wish to know if he will permit you to march to Rome with my
  Isaurians, or if he would consider such an act as a breach of our agreement.
  Against his will neither I nor the Isaurians will set forth."</p>

  <p>The two tribunes took leave, and, as he stepped out of the Prefect's tent,
  Piso said with a laugh to the others:</p>

  <p>"The crutch of Narses rendered your wits useless, longer than the stick of
  the shepherd did my fingers!"</p>

  <p>When they were well outside, Syphax hurried up to his master.</p>

  <p>"O master," he said, "do not trust this sick man with his quiet and
  impenetrable looks! Last night I again questioned my snake oracle. I divided
  the skin of my idol into two pieces, and laid them upon live coals. The piece
  which I called 'Narses' outlasted by far the piece which I called 'Cethegus.'
  Shall I not make the attempt? You know that a scratch with this dagger, and
  he is lost! What would it matter if they impaled Syphax, the son of Hiempsal?
  I cannot do it by stealth, for the Longobardian prince sleeps in the tent of
  Narses, in a bed stretched across the entrance, and seven of his 'little
  wolves' lie upon the threshold. The Herulians stand outside the curtain.
  According to your hint, I have watched Narses' tent at night ever since we
  left Helvillum. Even a gnat can scarcely escape the vigilance of the
  Herulians and Longobardians when it flies into the tent. But openly, by day,
  one spring into his litter&mdash;a scratch of the skin&mdash;and he is a dead
  man in a quarter of an hour!"</p>

  <p>"And before that time has elapsed, not only is Syphax, the son of
  Hiempsal, a corpse, but also Cethegus. No. But listen; I have discovered
  where the commander is accustomed to hold his secret conversations with
  Basiliskos and Alboin. Not in his tent&mdash;a camp has a thousand
  ears&mdash;but in the bath. The physicians have ordered Narses a morning bath
  in the bay at Stabiæ, and he has had a bath-house built out into the sea,
  which can only be reached in a boat. When Alboin and Basiliskos accompany him
  thither, they are only as wise as&mdash;well, as Basiliskos and Alboin. But
  when they return, they are full of the wisdom of Narses; they know what
  letters have come from Byzantium, and many other things. Round about the
  bath-house there is much seaweed. Syphax, for how long a time can you
  dive?"</p>

  <p>"As long," answered the slave, not without pride, "as the clumsy and
  suspicious crocodile in our streams takes to observe the gazelle which has
  been thrown into the reeds as a bait, and to make up his mind to swim to
  it&mdash;then a knife from below in his belly! This small-eyed Narses has
  something of the crocodile&mdash;we will see if I cannot outdo him by patient
  diving."</p>

  <p>"Excellent! my panther on shore, my diving duck in the water!"</p>

  <p>"I would leap into fire for your sake, then you would call me your
  'salamander.'"</p>

  <p>"Well, you must manage to listen to the conversation of this sick man when
  he goes to bathe."</p>

  <p>"The office will very well suit another game which I have on hand. For
  many days a fisherman, who throws his net every morning and evening, and
  never catches anything, has been signing and winking to me in a very
  innocent-sly manner. I believe he is watching for me, and not for sea
  mullets. But the long-bearded wolves of this Alboin are always at my heels.
  Perhaps, when I dive into the water, I shall be able to catch up what this
  fisherman wishes to confide to me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-8"
     name="b6-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Very gravely, but no more in a melting mood, Adalgoth told
  his young wife of the resolve of the King, and of the last alternative
  between death and a shameful slavery.</p>

  <p>He expected an outbreak of wild grief, such as it had been so difficult
  even for him to repress. But, to his astonishment, Gotho remained
  unshaken.</p>

  <p>"I have foreseen this long ago, my Adalgoth! It is no misfortune; to lose
  what we love, and still live, that alone is a misfortune. I have attained to
  the highest earthly bliss, I am thy wife. Whether I shall have been so for
  ten years or for twenty, or for scarcely half a year, alters nothing. At
  least we shall die together on the same day, possibly at the same hour. For
  King Teja will not forbid thee&mdash;when thou hast done thy part in the last
  battle, and, perhaps wounded, canst fight no longer&mdash;he will not forbid
  thee to come and take me in thine arms&mdash;how often hast thou carried me
  on the Iffinger!&mdash;and leap with me into the abyss. Oh, Adalgoth!" she
  cried, passionately embracing him, "how happy we have been! We will show that
  we were worthy of such bliss, by dying bravely, without cowardly lament. The
  scion of the Balthe," and she smiled, "shall not say that the shepherd's
  daughter could not keep pace with his nobility. There arises in my soul a
  vision of the grandeur of our mountains! My grandfather, Iffa, admonished me,
  when I left him, to call to mind the fresh and free air of our mountains, and
  the strict and noble severity of the proud heights, should ever life in the
  narrow, small, gilded chambers here below seem too paltry for our souls. We
  have not been menaced with that, but now, when it is necessary to raise our
  minds from timid, tender sorrow&mdash;which almost crept over me&mdash;and to
  gain strength for a noble resolve, the remembrance of my native mountains has
  made me strong. 'Shame on thee,' I said to myself, 'shame on thee, daughter
  of the mountains! What would the Iffinger, and the Wolfshead, and all the
  stony giants say, if they saw the shepherdess despair? Be worthy of thy
  mountains and of thy hero husband.'"</p>

  <p>Adalgoth pressed his young wife to his bosom, with mingled pride and
  joy.</p>

  <p>Behind the tent of the Duke lay the low hut, made of dried branches, where
  dwelt Wachis and Liuta. Liuta, who had heard from Gotho what fate menaced
  them, had been obliged to use all her powers of persuasion upon her husband
  (who sat shaking his head and hammering and patching his shield, which had
  been sadly defaced, by Longobardian arrows in the last watch he had held at
  the mouth of the pass, and who now began to whistle to hide his suppressed
  sobs) before she could raise him to a like enthusiasm of renunciation.</p>

  <p>"I do not think," said the honest man, "that the Lord of heaven can see it
  done. I am one of those who never like to say, 'All is over!' The proud ones,
  those who hold their heads high, like King Teja and Duke Adalgoth, certainly
  run constantly against the beams of fate. But we small people, who can stoop
  and bend, easily find a mouse-hole or a chink in the wall by which to escape.
  It is too vile! miserable! cruel! rascally!"&mdash;and each word was
  accompanied by a sounding stroke with his hammer. "I will not believe it! I
  cannot believe that hundreds of good women, pretty girls, lisping children,
  and stammering old men, must jump into the hellish fire of this accursed
  mountain! As if it were but a merry bonfire! As if they would come out at the
  other side safe and sound! I might just as well have let thee burn in the
  house at Fæsulæ. And not only thou must burn, but also our expected child,
  whom I have already named Witichis."</p>

  <p>"Or Rauthgundis," said Liuta, blushing, as she bent over her husband's
  shoulder and stopped his hammering. "Let this name admonish thee, Wachis!
  Think of our beloved mistress. Was she not a thousand times better than
  Liuta, the poor maid-servant? And would she have hesitated or refused to die
  on the same day with all her people?"</p>

  <p>"Thou art right, wife!" exclaimed Wachis, with a last furious stroke of
  his hammer. "Thou knowest I am a peasant, and peasants do not at all like to
  die. But if the heavens fall, they strike down peasants as well as others;
  and before it happens&mdash;ha-ha!&mdash;I will deal many a famous stroke!
  That would please Sir Witichis and Mistress Rauthgundis right well also. In
  honour of them&mdash;yes, thou art right, Liuta&mdash;we will live
  bravely&mdash;and, if it cannot be otherwise, bravely die!"</p>

  <h2><a id="b6-9"
     name="b6-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">It was with most joyful surprise that the two tribunes,
  Licinius and Julianus, entered the tent of the Prefect after their interview
  with Narses.</p>

  <p>"Once again you have conquered, O Cethegus!" cried Licinius.</p>

  <p>"You have got the upper hand, Prefect of Rome," said Salvius Julianus. "I
  do not understand it, but Narses really abandons Rome to you."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried Piso, who had entered with the others, "that is your old
  Cæsarian luck, Cethegus! Your star, which has seemed to wane since this
  famous cripple's arrival, shines anew. It seems to me that sometimes his
  <i>mind</i> suffers from attacks of epilepsy. For, with a sound mind, how
  could he quietly let you enter Rome? No! Quem deus vult perdere dementat! Now
  will Quintus Piso again wander through the Forum, and look into the
  book-stalls to see if the Goths have assiduously bought his 'Epistolas ad
  amabilissimum, carissimum pastorem Adalgothum et ejus pedum'&mdash;(Letters
  to the very amiable and greatly beloved shepherd-boy, Adalgoth, and his
  bludgeon)."</p>

  <p>"So you have composed in exile, like Ovidius?" asked Cethegus,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Piso. "The six-footed verses come more readily, since they
  no longer need to fear the Goths, who are a foot longer. And amid the noise
  of Gothic banquetings it would not be easy to compose, even in time of
  peace."</p>

  <p>"He has composed some merry verses, intermixed with Gothic words, on that
  subject too," said Salvius Julianus. "How does it begin, 'Inter hails
  Gothicum skapja'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not wrong my words! It is not permitted to quote falsely what is
  immortal."</p>

  <p>"Well, how go the verses?" asked Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Thus," said Piso:</p>

  <p>"De conviviis barbarorum. Inter: 'Hails Gothicum! skapja matjan jah
  drinkan!' Non audet quisquam dignos educere versus: Calliope madido trepidat
  se jungere Baccho, Ne pedibus non stet ebria Musa suis."</p>

  <p>"Horrible poetry!" exclaimed Salvius Julianus.</p>

  <p>"Who knows," said Piso, laughing, "whether the thirst of the Goths will
  not become immortal through these verses?"</p>

  <p>"But now tell me exactly what Narses answered?" said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"First he listened to us with great incredulity," replied Licinius, "He
  asked suspiciously, 'Is it possible that the prudent Romans can again beg for
  an Isaurian garrison and the Prefect, whom they have to thank for so much
  famine and unwilling valour?' But I answered that he under-rated the
  patriotism of the Romans, and that it was your affair if you had deceived
  yourself. If the Romans did not voluntarily admit us, your seven thousand men
  were too weak to storm the city. This seemed to convince him. He only
  required our promise that, if we were not admitted voluntarily, we would at
  once return here."</p>

  <p>"And we thought we might well venture to promise this in your name,"
  concluded Julianus.</p>

  <p>"You were right," said Cethegus, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Narses then said that he would not hinder us if the Romans liked to have
  us. And he is so completely harmless," Licinius went on, "that he does not
  seem to wish to detain you, even as a hostage; for he inquired when the
  Prefect would start. Therefore he must have taken it for granted that you
  would lead the Isaurians to Rome yourself. And he has nothing to say against
  that either. He was evidently surprised when I answered that you preferred to
  witness here the destruction of the Goths."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cethegus, "where, then, is this terrible Narses, the great
  statesman! Even my friend Procopius sadly over-rated him, when he once named
  him to me as the greatest man of the time."</p>

  <p>"The greatest man of the time is&mdash;some one else," cried Licinius.</p>

  <p>"It was natural that Procopius should give the palm to the superior enemy
  of his Belisarius. But one almost ought to take advantage of the clumsy
  blunder made by the 'greatest man,'" continued Cethegus reflectively. "The
  gods might be angry if we did not make use of the miracle of infatuation
  which they have accomplished for us. I alter my resolution; I long to get to
  the Capitol; I will go with you to Rome. Syphax, we will start&mdash;at once!
  Saddle my horse!"</p>

  <p>But Syphax gave his master a warning look.</p>

  <p>"Leave me, tribunes!" said Cethegus, "I will recall you directly."</p>

  <p>"O sir!" cried Syphax eagerly, as soon as they were alone, "do not go
  to-day! Send the others on in advance. To-morrow early I shall fish two great
  secrets out of the sea. Diving under his boat, I have already spoken to the
  fisherman I mentioned. He is no fisher, he is a slave, a post-slave belonging
  to Procopius."</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" asked Cethegus hastily and in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"We could only exchange a few words in a whisper. The Longobardians stood
  on the shore watching us. Seven letters from Procopius, sent either openly or
  secretly, have never reached you. He therefore chose this clever messenger,
  who will fish to-night by moonlight and give me the letter. He had not
  brought it with him to-day. And to-morrow early&mdash;to-day he was too
  ill&mdash;Narses will again bathe in the sea. I have found a hiding-place
  among the weeds; quite close. And should they chance to see bubbles rising
  from the water, I can whistle like an otter. I saw the imperial post arrive
  with well-filled mail-bags. Basiliskos took them. Do but wait until to-morrow
  early; Narses will be sure to talk over the latest secrets from Byzantium
  with Basiliskos and Alboin. Or at least leave me here
  alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, that would be at once to betray you as a spy. You are worth more than
  ten times your weight in gold, Syphax!&mdash;I shall remain here till
  to-morrow," he continued, as the tribunes again entered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come with us!" begged Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Away from the oppressive influence of this Narses!" added Julianus.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus frowned.</p>

  <p>"Does he still over-top me in your eyes, this fool, who allows Cethegus to
  escape from his well-guarded camp to Rome; who throws the fish out of his net
  into the water? Verily, he has too much intimidated you! To-morrow evening I
  will follow you. I have still some business to transact here, which no one
  but myself can complete. Meanwhile, if Rome does not resist, you can occupy
  it without me. But I shall surely overtake you at Terracina. If not, march
  into Rome. You, Licinius, will keep the Capitol for me."</p>

  <p>With sparkling eyes Licinius exclaimed: "You honour me highly, my general!
  I will answer for the Capitol with my life! May I venture a petition?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Do not expose yourself foolhardily to the spear of the Gothic King! The
  day before yesterday he hurled two spears at once at you; one in each hand.
  If I had not caught the one from his left hand upon my
  shield&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, Licinius, the Jupiter of the Capitol would have blown it aside
  before it struck me. For the god still needs me. But you mean well."</p>

  <p>"Do not widow Roma!" persisted Lucius.</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked at him with the irresistible look of admiring love which
  was so winning on <i>his</i> face; and continued, turning to Salvius
  Julianus:</p>

  <p>"You, Salvius, will occupy the Mausoleum. And you, Piso, the rest of the
  city on the left bank of the Tiber. Particularly the Porta Latina; through
  that gate I shall follow you. You will not open to Narses <i>alone</i>, any
  more than you formerly did to Belisarius alone. Farewell; salute my Roma for
  me. Tell her, that the last contest for her possession, that between Narses
  and Cethegus, has ended with victory for Cethegus. We shall meet again in
  Rome! Roma eterna!"</p>

  <p>"Roma eterna!" repeated the tribunes with enthusiasm, and hurried out.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why was not this Licinius the son of Manilia!" cried Cethegus,
  looking after the young men as they departed. "Folly of my heart, why art
  thou so obstinate? Licinius, you shall take the place of Julius as my heir!
  Oh, would that you were indeed Julius!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-10"
     name="b6-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">The departure of the Prefect for Rome was delayed for many
  days. Narses, who invited him to his table, did not indeed seek to keep him
  back. He even expressed his astonishment that the "Ruler of the Capitol" was
  not more powerfully drawn to the Tiber stream.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said with a smile, "I can understand that, as you have
  seen these barbarians rule and conquer so long in your Italy, you desire
  strongly to see them fall there. But I cannot say how long that event may yet
  be put off. The pass cannot be taken by storm as long as it is defended by
  men like this King Teja. Already more than a thousand of my Longobardians,
  Alamannians, Burgundians, Herulians, Franks, and Gepidæ have fallen before
  it."</p>

  <p>"Send for once," interposed Alboin in a vexed tone of voice&mdash;"send
  for once your brave Romani Against the Goths. The Herulians, Vulkaris and
  Wilmuth, fell under King Teja's axe almost as soon as they arrived here; the
  Gepidian Asbad, under the spear of that boy Adalgoth; my cousin Gisulf lies
  wounded by Duke Guntharis's sword; Wisand, the standard-bearer, has stabbed
  the Frank count, Butilin, with the point of his flagstaff; the old
  master-at-arms has dashed out the brains of the Burgundian Gernot with his
  stone axe; the Alamannian Liuthari was slain by Earl Grippa, and my
  shield-bearer, Klaffo, by a common Gothic soldier. And for every one of these
  heroes, a dozen of their followers lie dead also. If, at midnight last night,
  a block of lava, upon which I was standing, had not most opportunely slipped
  down just as King Teja, who can see in the dark, was hurling his lance at me,
  Rosamunda would not be the loveliest woman, but the loveliest widow in the
  realm of the Longobardians! As it was I got off with some ugly bruises, which
  will not be extolled in future heroic songs, but which I fancy much more than
  King Teja's best spear in my stomach. But I think that it is now the turn of
  other heroes. Let your Macedonians and Illyrians come forward. We have shown
  them often enough how a man can die in front of that needle's eye."</p>

  <p>"No, my little wolf! Diamond cut diamond!" laughed Narses. "Always Germans
  against Germans; there are too many of you in the world!"</p>

  <p>"You seem to have the same fatherly opinion about the Isaurians&mdash;at
  least about <i>mine</i>!&mdash;magister militum," said Cethegus. "Shortly
  before their departure for Rome, you ordered my Isaurians to storm the pass
  in mass&mdash;the first storming-party in mass that you had ever ordered!
  Seven hundred of my seven thousand remained dead upon those rocks, and
  Sandil, my tried and faithful chief, at last found this Black Earl's axe too
  sharp for his helmet. He was very valuable to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, the rest are safe in Rome. But nothing except fire can drive these
  Goths out of their last hole; unless indeed the earth would do me the favour
  to quake, as it did at Ravenna when Belisarius&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is there still no news of the result of the process against Belisarius?"
  asked Cethegus. "Letters came lately from Byzantium, did they not?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet read them all.&mdash;Or, if not fire&mdash;then hunger.
  And if they then sally forth for a last battle, many a brave man would rather
  hear the murmur of the Ganges than the murmur of the Draco. Not you, Prefect!
  I know that you can look boldly into the eye of death."</p>

  <p>"I will still wait here a little and see how things turn out. It is bad
  travelling weather. It storms and rains unceasingly. On the first or second
  warm sunshiny day, I will start for Rome."</p>

  <p>It was true. On the night of the departure of the Isaurians, the weather
  had suddenly changed. The fisherman, who dwelt in a village near Stabiæ,
  could not venture out upon the sea; less on account of the storm than because
  of the Longobardians, who had long been watching him with suspicion, and who
  had once arrested him. Only when his old father came forward and proved that
  Agnellus was really his, the old fisherman's son, did they hesitatingly let
  him go free. But he did not dare to pretend to fish, when no other fisher
  threw out his nets; and only far out upon the water could Syphax, who was
  also closely watched, venture to communicate with him.</p>

  <p>The exits of all the camps, even of the half-deserted camp of
  Cethegus&mdash;Narses had placed only three thousand Thracians and Persians
  in the tents deserted by the Isaurians&mdash;were guarded night and day by
  the Longobardians. And Narses was also obliged to postpone his baths for some
  days. But for the secrets, namely, the letter from Procopius and the
  conversation held by Narses in his bath-house, Cethegus fully intended to
  wait.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-11"
     name="b6-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">The usual good luck of the Prefect did not desert him. The
  weather changed again. On the morning of the day after his last conversation
  with Narses, the sun rose splendidly over the blue and sparkling bay, and
  hundreds of small fishing-boats set out to take advantage of the favourable
  weather.</p>

  <p>Syphax, yielding his place at the threshold of his master's tent to the
  four Isaurians, who alone had remained behind their comrades, had disappeared
  at the first approach of dawn.</p>

  <p>When Cethegus had taken his morning bath in an adjoining tent, and was
  returning to his breakfast, he heard Syphax making a great noise as he
  approached through the lines of tents.</p>

  <p>"No!" he was shouting; "this fish is for the Prefect. I have paid for it
  in hard cash. The great Narses will not wish to eat other people's fish!"</p>

  <p>And with these words he tore himself loose from Alboin, and from several
  Longobardians, as well as from a slave belonging to Narses, who were trying
  to detain him.</p>

  <p>Cethegus stopped. He recognised the slave. It was the cook of the
  generally sick and always temperate general, whose art was scarcely practised
  except for his master's guests.</p>

  <p>"Sir," the well-educated Greek said to the Prefect, in his native
  language, "do not blame me for this unseemly turmoil. What does a sea-mullet
  matter to me! But these long-bearded barbarians forced me to take possession,
  at any cost, of this fish-basket, which your slave was bringing from the
  boats."</p>

  <p>A glance which Cethegus exchanged with Syphax sufficed. The Longobardian
  had not understood what had been said. Cethegus gave Syphax a blow on the
  cheek, and cried in Latin:</p>

  <p>"Good-for-nothing, insolent slave! will you never learn manners? Shall not
  the sick general have the best there is?"</p>

  <p>And he roughly snatched the basket from the Moor and gave it to the
  slave.</p>

  <p>"Here is the basket. I hope Narses will enjoy the fish."</p>

  <p>The slave, who thought he had refused the gift distinctly enough, took the
  basket with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"What can it all mean?" he asked in Latin as he went away.</p>

  <p>"It means," answered Alboin, who followed him, "that the best fish is
  <i>not</i> hidden in the basket, but somewhere else."</p>

  <p>As soon as Syphax entered the tent, he eagerly felt in his waterproof belt
  of crocodile-skin for a roll of papyrus, which he handed to the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"You bleed, Syphax!"</p>

  <p>"Only slightly. The Longobardians pretended, when they saw me swimming in
  the water, to take me for a dolphin, and shot their arrows at me."</p>

  <p>"Nurse yourself&mdash;a solidus for every drop of your blood!&mdash;the
  letter is worth blood and gold, as it seems. Nurse yourself! and bid the
  Isaurians let no one enter."</p>

  <p>And now, alone in his tent, the Prefect began to read.</p>

  <p>His features grew darker and darker. Ever deeper became the wrinkle in the
  centre of his mighty forehead; ever more harshly and firmly compressed his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"To Cornelius Cethegus Cæsarius, the Ex-prefect and ex-friend, Procopius
  of Cæsarea, for the last time. This is the most sorrowful business for which
  I have ever used either my former or my present pen-hand. And I would gladly
  give this my left hand, as I gave my right for Belisarius, if I need not
  write this letter. The revocation and renunciation of our friendship of
  thirty years! In this unheroic time I believed in two heroes; the hero of the
  sword, Belisarius; and the hero of the intellect, Cethegus. In future I must
  hate, and almost despise, the latter."</p>

  <p>The reader threw the letter on the couch upon which he lay. Then he took
  it up again with a frown and read on:</p>

  <p>"Nothing more was wanting but that Belisarius should prove to be the
  traitor that you would have represented him to be. But his innocence is as
  clearly proved as your black falsehood. I had often felt uneasy at the
  crookedness of your ways, into which you had partly led me also; but I
  believed in the grandeur and unselfishness of your design: the liberation of
  Italy! Now, however, I see that the mainspring of your actions was
  measureless, unlimited, merciless ambition! A design which necessitates such
  means as you have used is desecrated in my eyes for ever. You tried to ruin
  Belisarius, that brave and simple-minded man, by means of his own repentant
  wife, and to sacrifice him to Theodora and to your own ambition. That was
  devilish; and I turn away from you for ever."</p>

  <p>Cethegus closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to wonder at it," he said to himself. "He too has his idol:
  Belisarius! Whoever touches that idol is as hateful to the wise Procopius as
  he who sees in the Cross merely a piece of wood is to the Christian.
  Therefore I ought not to wonder at it&mdash;but it pains me! Such is the
  power of a thirty years' habit. During all those years a warmer feeling came
  over my heart at the sound of the name, Procopius! How weak does custom make
  us! The Goth deprived me of Julius&mdash;Belisarius deprives me of Procopius!
  Who will deprive me of Cethegus, my oldest and last friend? No one. Neither
  Narses nor Fate. Away with you, Procopius, out of the circle of my life!
  Almost too lachrymose, certainly too long, is the funeral speech which I have
  held over you. What else does the dead man say?"</p>

  <p>And he continued to read:</p>

  <p>"But I write this letter, because I wish to close our long
  friendship&mdash;to which you have put an end by your treacherous attack upon
  my hero, Belisarius&mdash;with a last sign of affection. I wish to warn and
  to save you, if it yet be possible. Seven letters which I sent you have
  evidently never reached you, otherwise you would not still be dwelling in the
  camp of Narses, as his army-reports affirm. So I will entrust this eighth
  letter to my slave, Agnellus, a fisherman's son from Stabiæ, where you are
  now encamped. I will give him his freedom, and recommend this letter to him
  as my last commission. For, although I ought to hate you, I still love you,
  Cethegus! It is hard to abandon you, and I would gladly save you. When,
  shortly after your departure, I returned to Byzantium&mdash;already on the
  way the news of the arrest of Belisarius (on account of treachery!) came upon
  me like a thunderbolt&mdash;I believed at first that you, like the Emperor,
  had been deceived. In vain I tried to gain a hearing from Justinian; he raged
  against all who had ever been united in ties of friendship to Belisarius. In
  vain I strove to see Antonina by every means in my power. She was strictly
  guarded (thanks to your hints) in the Red House. In vain I proved to
  Tribonianus the impossibility of treachery on the part of Belisarius. He
  shrugged his shoulders and said: 'I cannot comprehend it! But the proof is
  striking; this senseless denial of the visits of Anicius. He is lost!' And he
  was lost. The sentence was pronounced; Belisarius was condemned to death;
  Antonina to banishment. The Emperor mercifully <i>mitigated</i> the sentence
  of Belisarius into banishment&mdash;far from Antonina's exile&mdash;the loss
  of sight, and confiscation of his property. This terrible judgment lay heavy
  upon all Byzantium. No one believed in the guilt of Belisarius except the
  Emperor and the judges. But no one was able to prove his innocence, or change
  his fate. I was resolved to go with him into banishment; the one-armed with
  the blind. Then&mdash;and may he be blessed for it for ever!&mdash;his great
  enemy, Narses, saved him! He whom I once named to you as the greatest man of
  the age."</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said Cethegus to himself, "and now he will also be the most
  magnanimous."</p>

  <p>"As soon as the news reached him in the Baths of Nikomedia&mdash;whither
  the sick man had repaired&mdash;he hurried back to Byzantium. He sent for me
  and said: 'You know well that it would have been my greatest pleasure to beat
  Belisarius thoroughly in the open field; but he who has been my great and
  noble rival shall not perish miserably because of these lies. Come with me.
  We two&mdash;his greatest friend and his greatest enemy&mdash;will together
  save that impetuous man.' And he demanded an audience of the Emperor, which
  was at once granted to the enemy of Belisarius. Then he said to Justinian:
  'It is impossible that Belisarius is a traitor. His only failing is his blind
  fidelity to your ingratitude.' But Justinian was deaf. Then Narses laid his
  marshal's staff at the Emperor's feet and said: 'Well, either you will annul
  the sentence of the judges, and permit a new inquiry, or you will lose both
  your generals on one day. For, on the same day that Belisarius goes into
  exile, I go too. Then see to it, who will guard your doors from the Goths,
  Persians, and Saracens.' And the Emperor hesitated, and demanded three days'
  time for consideration, and meanwhile Narses was to be allowed to look
  through the papers in company with me, and to speak to Anicius and all
  concerned. I soon perceived from the papers that the worst proof against
  Belisarius&mdash;for I hoped to be able to explain away the consent which he
  had written upon the tablet found in the house of Photius&mdash;was the
  secret and midnight visits of Anicius, which Belisarius, Antonina, and
  Anicius himself, obstinately and unreasonably denied. I then spoke to
  Antonina in private. I told her that these visits and their denial would be
  the ruin of Belisarius. Then she cried with sparkling eyes: 'Then I alone
  will be ruined, and Belisarius shall be saved! He really knew nothing of
  these visits, for Anicius did not come to him&mdash;he came to me. All the
  world shall know it&mdash;even Belisarius! He may kill me, but he shall be
  saved!' And she gave me a little bundle of letters from Anicius, which,
  certainly, when laid before the Emperor, would explain everything, but would
  also accuse the <i>Empress</i> in a terrible manner. And how firmly stood
  Theodora at that time in the esteem of Justinian! I hastened with these
  letters to Narses. He read them through and said, 'In this case, either
  Belisarius and all of us are ruined&mdash;or the beautiful she-devil will
  fall! It is for life or death! First come with me to Antonina once more.'
  And, accompanied by guards, and taking Antonina with us, we hastened to
  Anicius, who was slowly recovering from his wound in prison."</p>

  <p>Cethegus stamped his foot; but he read on:</p>

  <p>"And then we all four went to Justinian. The magnanimous sinner, Antonina,
  confessed upon her knees the nightly meetings with Anicius, which, however,
  she had only encouraged in order to deliver the youth from the toils of the
  Empress. She gave the Emperor the letters of Anicius, which spoke of the
  seductress, of her manifold arts, of the secret passage to her chamber, and
  of the turning statue. The poor Emperor broke out into a fearful rage; he
  would have arrested us all upon the spot for leze majesty, for unlimited
  calumny. But Belisarius said, 'Do that&mdash;to-morrow! But this evening,
  when the Empress sleeps, let Anicius and me lead you through the turning
  statue into the chamber of your wife, seize her letters, confront her with
  Antonina and Anicius, subject the old witch Galatea to the torture, and then
  see if you do not learn much more than you will like to hear. And if we have
  deceived ourselves, punish us to-morrow as you like!' The turning, statue!
  that was so palpable! The assurance of Anicius, that he had often passed this
  secret door, was so provoking! Such things could scarcely be invented.
  Justinian accepted our proposition. That very night Anicius led the Emperor
  and us three into the garden adjoining the Empress's apartments. A hollow
  plantain-tree concealed the mouth of the subterranean passage which ended
  under the mosaic of Theodora's ante-room. Until then, Justinian had still
  preserved his belief in the Empress. But when Anicius pushed a marble slab to
  one side, and opened a secret lock with a secret key that he had fetched from
  his house, and the statue became visible, the Emperor, half fainting, sank
  back into my arms. At last he roused himself, and pressed forward alone past
  the statue into the chamber. Twilight filled the room. The dimly burning lamp
  shone over the couch of Theodora. The poor befooled man went up to her with a
  stealthy and unsteady step. There lay Theodora, fully dressed in imperial
  garments. A shrill cry from the Emperor called us to his side, and also
  Galatea from an adjoining chamber, whom I immediately seized. Justinian,
  stiff with horror, pointed to the couch&mdash;we stepped forward&mdash;the
  Empress was dead! Galatea, not less startled than we, fell into convulsions.
  Meanwhile, we searched the room, and found, upon a golden tripod, the ashes
  of numerous rolls of parchment. Anicius called for slaves and lights. By this
  time Galatea had recovered, and, wringing her hands, told how the Empress had
  left her rooms towards evening&mdash;about the time of our
  audience&mdash;without attendants, in order to visit the Emperor, as she
  frequently did at that hour. She had returned almost immediately, very quiet,
  but strikingly pale. She had ordered the tripod to be filled with glowing
  coals, and had then locked herself up in her room. When Galatea knocked some
  time later, she had answered that she had gone to rest, and required nothing
  more. On hearing this, the Emperor threw himself again upon the beloved
  corpse; and now, by the light of the lamps which had been brought, he saw
  that the little ruby capsule, containing poison, in the ring which had once
  belonged to Cleopatra, and which Theodora wore upon her little finger, had
  been opened&mdash;the Empress had killed herself! Upon the lemonwood table
  lay a strip of parchment, upon which was written her favourite motto: 'To
  live is to rule by means of beauty.' We were still in doubt whether it was
  the tortures of her malady or the discovery of her threatened fall which had
  driven her to this desperate deed. But our doubts were soon solved. When the
  news of Theodora's death spread through the palace, Theophilos, the Emperor's
  door-keeper, hurried, half desperate, into the chamber of death, threw
  himself at the Emperor's feet, and confessed that he guessed the connection.
  He had been for years in the secret service of the Empress, and every time
  that the Emperor held an audience to which he had given orders that the
  Empress was not to be admitted, he (the doorkeeper) had apprised the latter
  of it. She had then almost always heard the most secret councils of the
  Emperor from a hiding-place in the doorway of an adjacent chamber. Thus
  yesterday he had, as usual, informed the Empress that we were to have an
  audience, to which he had been particularly ordered not to admit her.
  Presently she had entered her hiding-place, but she had scarcely heard a few
  words spoken by Antonina and Anicius, when, with a smothered cry, she had
  sank half fainting behind the curtains; but, quickly rising, she had made a
  sign to him to keep silence, and then disappeared.&mdash;Narses pressed the
  Emperor to question Galatea upon the rack, but Justinian said, 'I will
  inquire no further.'</p>

  <p>"Day and night he remained alone near the corpse of the still beloved
  woman, after which he caused her to be interred, with the highest imperial
  honours, in the church of St. Sophia. It was officially published that the
  Empress had been suffocated by charcoal fumes while sleeping. The tripod,
  with the ashes, was publicly exposed. But that night had made Justinian an
  old man. The complete agreement of the evidence of Antonina, Anicius,
  Belisarius, Photius, the slaves of Antonina, the litter-bearers who had taken
  you to Belisarius's house before his arrest&mdash;all fully proved that you,
  in conjunction with the Empress, had persuaded Belisarius, through Antonina,
  to place himself seemingly at the head of the conspirators; and I swore to
  the fact that a few weeks ago he had expressed to me his just anger at the
  project of Photius.</p>

  <p>"Justinian hastened to the cell where Belisarius was confined, embraced
  him with tears, begged his forgiveness for himself and for Antonina, who
  remorsefully confessed all her innocent love-makings, and obtained full
  pardon. The Emperor, in atonement, begged Belisarius to accept the chief
  command in Italy. But Belisarius said, 'No, Justinian; my work on earth is
  finished. I shall retire with Antonina to my most distant villa in
  Mesopotamia, and there bury myself and my past. I am cured of the wish to
  serve you. If you will grant me a last favour, then give the command of the
  army in Italy to my friend and preserver, Narses. He shall revenge me upon
  the Goths, and upon that Satan called Cethegus!' And the two great enemies
  embraced before our sympathetic eyes. All this was buried in the deepest
  secrecy, in order to spare the memory of the Empress; for Justinian still
  loves her. It was announced that the innocence of Belisarius had been fully
  proved by Narses, Tribonianus, and me, by means of lately-discovered letters
  of the conspirators. Justinian pardoned all who had been sentenced; also
  Scævola and Albinus, who were formerly undone by you. But I tell you the
  whole truth, in order to warn and save you. For, although I do not know in
  what way, I am quite convinced that Justinian has sworn your ruin, and
  entrusted your destruction to the hands of Narses. Your design to found a
  free and recognised Rome, ruled only by yourself, was madness. To it you have
  sacrificed everything&mdash;even our fair friendship. I shall accompany
  Belisarius and Antonina, and I will try, in the contemplation of their
  complete reconciliation and happiness, to forget the disgust, doubt, and
  vexation with which all human affairs have filled me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-12"
     name="b6-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">Cethegus sprang from his seat, tossed the letter down, and
  hastily paced his tent.</p>

  <p>"Feeble creature! and weak-minded Cethegus! to vex yourself that another
  soul is lost to you! Had you not lost Julius long before you killed him? And
  yet you still live and strive! And this Narses, whom all fear as if he were
  God and devil in one&mdash;is he, then, really so dangerous? Impossible! He
  has blindly entrusted Rome to me and mine. It is not his fault that I do not
  defy him at this moment from the Capitol. Bah! I cannot learn to be afraid in
  my old days. I trust in my star! Is it foolhardiness? Is it the calmest
  wisdom? I do not know; but it seems to me that confidence like this led Cæsar
  from victory to victory! However, I can scarcely learn more from the secret
  council of Narses in his bath-house than I have learned from this letter."
  And he tore the papyrus roll into small pieces. "I will start this very day,
  even if Syphax has overheard nothing at this moment, for I think it is the
  hour of the bath."</p>

  <p>Just then Johannes was announced, and, at a sign from Cethegus, was
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Prefect of Rome," said Johannes, "I am come to beg pardon for an old
  injury. The pain I felt at the loss of my brother Perseus made me
  suspicious."</p>

  <p>"Let that rest," said Cethegus; "it is forgotten."</p>

  <p>"But I have not forgotten," continued Johannes, "your heroic valour. In
  order at once to honour it and profit by it, I come to you with a proposal. I
  and my comrades, used to Belisarius's straightforward attacks, find the
  caution of the great Narses very tiresome. We have now been lying for nearly
  two months before this cursed pass; we lose men and win no renown. The
  commander-in-chief will starve the barbarians out. Who knows how long that
  may last? And there will be a fine butchery if, at last driven by despair,
  the barbarians break out and sell dearly every drop of their blood! It is
  clear that if we only had the mouth of that confounded
  pass&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, <i>if</i>!" said Cethegus, smiling. "It is not ill-defended by this
  Teja."</p>

  <p>"Just on that account he must fall! He, the King, is evidently the only
  one who holds together the whole loose bundle of spears. Therefore I and more
  than a dozen of the best blades in the camp have formed a league. Whenever it
  is the King's turn to guard the pass&mdash;the approach is so narrow and
  steep, that only one at a time can attempt a hand-to-hand fight&mdash;we, one
  after the other, taking our turns by lot, will attack him; the others will
  keep as close as possible to the foremost combatant, will save him if
  wounded, step into his place when he falls, or, if he is victor and slays the
  Goth, press forward into the ravine. Besides me, there are the Longobardians
  Alboin, Gisulf, and Autharis, the Herulians Rodulf and Suartua, Ardarich the
  Gepide, Gunebad the Burgundian, Chlotachar and Bertchramn the Franks, Vadomar
  and Epurulf the Alamannians, Garizo the tall Bajuvar, Kabades the Persian,
  Althias the Armenian, and Taulantius the Illyrian. We should much like to
  have your terrible sword among us. Will you, Cethegus, be one in our league?
  I know you hate this black-haired hero."</p>

  <p>"Gladly," said Cethegus, "as long as I am here. But I shall soon exchange
  this camp for the Capitol."</p>

  <p>A strange and mocking smile passed across the face of Johannes, which did
  not escape Cethegus. But he attributed it to a wrong feeling.</p>

  <p>"You cannot well doubt my courage," he said, "according to your own words.
  But there are more important things for me to do than to stamp out the last
  glimmering sparks of the Gothic war. The orphaned city longs for her Prefect.
  The Capitol beckons me."</p>

  <p>"The Capitol!" repeated Johannes. "I think, Cethegus, that a heroic death
  is also worth something."</p>

  <p>"Yes, when the aim of one's life is reached."</p>

  <p>"But no one knows, O Cethegus, how near he has approached his aim. But,
  another thing: it seems to me as if something is in preparation among the
  barbarians on their cursed mountain. From the hill near my quarters we can
  peep a little, through a gap, over the peaks of the lava. I should like you
  to turn your practised eye in that direction. At least, they shall not
  surprise us by a sally. Follow me thither. But do not speak of our league to
  Narses; he does not approve of such things. I purposely chose the hour of his
  bath for my visit to you."</p>

  <p>"I will come," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>He finished putting on his armour, and, after vainly inquiring for Syphax
  of the Isaurian sentry, went with Johannes through his own and the central
  camp of Narses, and finally turned into that on the right wing&mdash;the camp
  of Johannes.</p>

  <p>Upon the crown of the little hill mentioned by Johannes stood a great many
  officers, who were eagerly looking through a small gap in the lava into the
  portion of the Gothic encampment visible to them.</p>

  <p>When Cethegus had looked for some time, he cried:</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about it! They are evacuating this easternmost part of
  their position; they are pushing the wagons, which were drawn together,
  apart, and dragging them farther to the right, to the west. That must mean
  concentration; perhaps a sally."</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Johannes?" quietly asked a young captain, who had
  evidently only lately arrived from Byzantium, and who was a stranger to
  Cethegus, "what do you think? Could not the new catapults reach the
  barbarians from the point of that rock? I mean the last inventions of
  Martinus&mdash;such as my brother took to Rome."</p>

  <p>"<i>To Rome?</i>" repeated Cethegus, and cast a sharp look at the
  questioner and at Johannes.</p>

  <p>He felt himself suddenly turn hot and cold&mdash;a fright came over him,
  more terrible still than he had experienced when he had heard of the landing
  of Belisarius, of Totila's election, of Totila's march to Rome at <i>Pons
  Padi</i>, of Totila's entrance into the Tiber; or of the arrival of Narses in
  Italy. It seemed to him as if an iron hand were clutching his heart and
  brain. He saw that Johannes imposed silence on the young questioner with a
  furious frown.</p>

  <p>"<i>To Rome?</i>" again repeated Cethegus in a low voice, and fixing his
  eyes, now upon the stranger, now upon Johannes.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, of course, to Rome!" at last answered Johannes. "Zenon, this
  man is Cethegus, the Prefect of Rome."</p>

  <p>The young Byzantine bowed with the expression of one who sees for the
  first time some far-famed monster.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus, Zenon here, a captain who till now has been fighting on the
  Euphrates, arrived only yesterday evening with some Persian bowmen from
  Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"And his brother," asked Cethegus, "has gone to <i>Rome</i>?"</p>

  <p>"My brother Megas," quietly answered the Byzantine&mdash;who had now
  collected himself&mdash;"had the order to offer to the Prefect of
  Rome"&mdash;and here he again bowed&mdash;"the newly-invented
  double-catapults for the walls of Rome. He embarked long before me; so I
  thought that he had already arrived, and was gone to you in Rome. But his
  freight is very heavy. I am rejoiced to become personally acquainted with the
  most powerful man of the West, the glorious defender of the Tomb of
  Hadrian."</p>

  <p>But Cethegus cast another sharp look at Johannes, and, abruptly bowing to
  all present, turned to go.</p>

  <p>When he had gone a few paces he suddenly looked back, and caught sight of
  Johannes, with both his fists raised in anger, scolding at the talkative
  young archon. A cold shudder ran through the Prefect. He intended to reach
  his tent by the shortest cut, and, without waiting for Syphax and his
  discoveries, to mount his horse and hasten to Rome without taking leave.</p>

  <p>The shortest way to get to his tent was to leave the camp of Johannes, and
  walk along the straight line of the semicircle formed by the whole
  encampment. In front of him a few Persian bowmen were riding out of the camp
  commanded by Johannes. And some peasants who had sold wine to the soldiers
  were also permitted to pass unhindered by the sentinels. These sentries were
  all Longobardians, to whom, as everywhere, the exits of this camp were
  entrusted by Narses.</p>

  <p>As Cethegus was about to follow his countrymen, these sentries stopped him
  with their spears. He caught at the shafts and angrily pushed them aside. At
  this one of the Longobardians blew his horn; the others pressed more closely
  round Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"By order of Narses!" said Autharis, the captain.</p>

  <p>"And those?" asked Cethegus, pointing to the peasants and the
  Persians.</p>

  <p>"Those are not you," said the Longobardian.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the horn a troop of guards had hurried up. They bent their
  bows. Cethegus silently turned his back on them and returned to his tent by
  the way that he had come.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was only his suddenly-aroused mistrust which made him imagine
  that all the Byzantines and Longobardians whom he passed regarded him with
  half-jeering, half-compassionate looks. When he reached his tent he asked the
  Isaurian sentry:</p>

  <p>"Is Syphax back?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, long since. He is impatiently waiting for you in the tent. He
  is wounded."</p>

  <p>Cethegus quickly pushed aside the curtains and entered. Syphax, deadly
  pale beneath his bronzed skin, rushed to meet him, embraced his knees, and
  whispered in passionate and desperate excitement:</p>

  <p>"O my master! my lion! You are ensnared&mdash;lost&mdash;nothing can save
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Compose yourself, slave!" said Cethegus. "You bleed?" "It is nothing!
  They would not permit me to return to your camp&mdash;they began to struggle
  with me as if in joke, but their dagger-stabs were bitter earnest."</p>

  <p>"Who? Whose dagger-stabs?"</p>

  <p>"The Longobardians, master, who have placed double guards at all the
  entrances of your camp."</p>

  <p>"Narses shall give me a reason for this," said Cethegus angrily.</p>

  <p>"The reason&mdash;that is, the pretext&mdash;he sent Kabades to inform you
  of it&mdash;is a menaced sally by the Goths. But oh! my lion, my eagle, my
  palm-tree, my wellspring&mdash;you are lost!"</p>

  <p>And again the Numidian threw himself at his master's feet, covering them
  with tears and kisses.</p>

  <p>"Tell me coherently," said Cethegus, "what you have heard."</p>

  <p>And he leaned against the central support of his tent, crossing his arms
  behind his back, and raising his head. He did not seem to regard the troubled
  face of Syphax, but to gaze at vacancy.</p>

  <p>"O sir&mdash;I shall not be able to tell it very clearly&mdash;but I
  succeeded in reaching my hiding-place among the sea-weed. It was scarcely
  necessary to dive&mdash;the weeds hid me sufficiently. The bathing-house is
  made of thin wood and has been newly covered with linen since the last storm.
  Narses came in his little boat with Alboin, Basiliskos, and three other men,
  disguised as Longobardians&mdash;but I recognised Scævola,
  Albinus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are not dangerous," interrupted Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;Anicius!"</p>

  <p>"Are you not mistaken?" asked Cethegus sharply.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I knew his eyes and his voice! From their conversation&mdash;I did
  not understand every word&mdash;but the sense was clear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would that you could repeat their very words!"</p>

  <p>"They spoke Greek, sir, and I do not understand it as well as your
  language&mdash;and the waves made a noise, and the wind was
  unfavourable."</p>

  <p>"Well, what did they say?"</p>

  <p>"The three men only came from Byzantium yesterday evening&mdash;they at
  once demanded your head. But Narses said, 'No murder! A just sentence after a
  process in all form.' 'When is it to be?' asked Anicius. 'So soon as it is
  time.' 'And Rome?' asked Basiliskos. 'He will never see Rome again!' answered
  Narses."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" cried Cethegus. "Wait a moment. I must be quite clear."</p>

  <p>He wrote a few lines upon a wax tablet.</p>

  <p>"Has Narses returned from his bath?"</p>

  <p>"Long ago."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well." He gave the tablet to the sentinel at the door. "Bring back
  the answer immediately.&mdash;Continue, Syphax."</p>

  <p>But Cethegus could no longer stand still. He began hastily to pace the
  tent.</p>

  <p>"O sir, something monstrous must have happened at Rome&mdash;I could not
  exactly understand what. Anicius put a question; in it he named your
  Isaurians. Narses said, 'I am rid of the chief Sandil,' and he added,
  laughing, 'and the rest are well cared for in Rome by Aulus and the brothers
  Macer, my decoy-birds.'"</p>

  <p>"Did he name those names?" asked Cethegus grimly. "Did he use that
  word?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Then Alboin said, 'It is well that the young tribunes are gone;
  it would have cost a hard fight.' And Narses replied, 'All the Prefect's
  Isaurians must go. Shall we fight a bloody battle in our own camp, and let
  King Teja burst in upon us?' O sir, I fear that they have enticed your most
  faithful followers away from you with evil intent."</p>

  <p>"I believe so too," said Cethegus gravely. "But what did they say about
  Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Alboin asked after a leader whose name I had never heard before."</p>

  <p>"Megas?" asked Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Megas! That was it. How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"No matter. Continue! What about this Megas?"</p>

  <p>"Alboin asked how long Megas had been in Rome. Narses said, 'In any case
  long enough for the Roman tribunes and the Isaurians.'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus groaned aloud.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Syphax, "Scævola remarked that the citizens of Rome
  idolised their tyrant and his young knights. 'Yes.' answered Narses,
  'formerly; but now they hate and fear nothing so much as the man who tried by
  force once more to make them brave men and Romans.' Then Albinus asked, 'But
  if they were to take his part again? His name has an all-conquering
  influence.' Narses answered, 'Twenty-five thousand Armenians in the Capitol
  and the Mausoleum will bind the Romans&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus struck his fist fiercely on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"'Will bind them more strictly than Pope Pelagius, their treaty, or their
  oath.' 'Their treaty and their oath?' asked Scævola. 'Yes,' answered Narses,
  'their oath and treaty! They have sworn only to open their gates to the
  Prefect of Rome.' 'Well, and then?' asked Anicius. 'Well', they know, and
  they knew then, that now the Prefect of Rome is called&mdash;Narses. <i>To
  me, not to him</i> have, they sworn!'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus threw himself upon his couch and hid his face in his
  purple-hemmed mantle. No loud complaint issued from his heaving chest.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear master!" cried Syphax, "it will kill you! But I have not yet
  finished. You must know all. Despair will give you strength, as it does to
  the snared lion."</p>

  <p>Cethegus raised his head.</p>

  <p>"Finish," he said. "What I have still to hear is indifferent; it can only
  concern me, not Rome."</p>

  <p>"But it concerns you in a fearful manner! Narses went on to say, after a
  few speeches which escaped me in the noise of the waves&mdash;that yesterday,
  at the same time as the long-expected news from Rome&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What news?" asked Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"He did not mention what. He said, 'At the same time, Zenon brought me
  word to open the sealed orders which I carry from the Emperor; for the latter
  rightly judges that any day may bring about the destruction of the Goths. I
  opened and'&mdash;O master, it is dreadful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Speak!"</p>

  <p>"Narses said, 'All the great Justinian's littleness is exposed in these
  orders. I believe he would more easily pardon Cethegus for having enticed him
  to blind Belisarius, than for having been in collusion with Theodora, for
  having been the seducer of the Empress! A frightful anachron'&mdash;I did not
  understand the word."</p>

  <p>"Anachronism!" said Cethegus, quietly righting Syphax.</p>

  <p>"'For having deceived and outwitted him. The fate which Cethegus almost
  brought upon Belisarius, will now fall upon his own head&mdash;the loss of
  his sight.'"</p>

  <p>"Really!" said Cethegus with a smile. But he involuntarily felt for his
  dagger.</p>

  <p>"Narses said further," continued Syphax, "that you were to suffer the
  punishment which, in blasphemous desecration of Christ's death, and contrary
  to the law of the Emperor Constantine, you had lately introduced into Rome.
  What can he mean by that?" added Syphax anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Crucifixion!" said Cethegus as he put up his dagger.</p>

  <p>"O master!"</p>

  <p>"Softly! I do not yet hang in the air. I still firmly tread the
  hero-nourishing earth. Conclude!"</p>

  <p>"Narses said that he was a general and no executioner, and that the
  Emperor would have to be contented if he only sent him your head to
  Byzantium. But oh, not that! Only not that&mdash;if we <i>must</i> die!"</p>

  <p>"We?" said Cethegus, who had fully gained his usual calmness. "<i>You</i>
  have not deceived the great Emperor. The danger does not threaten you."</p>

  <p>But Syphax continued:</p>

  <p>"Do you not know then? Oh, do not doubt it. All Africa knows that if the
  head of a corpse is wanting, the soul must creep for ages through dust and
  mire, in the shape of a vile and filthy headless worm. Oh, they shall not
  separate your head from your trunk!"</p>

  <p>"It still stands firm upon these shoulders of mine, like the globe on the
  shoulders of Atlas. Peace&mdash;some one comes."</p>

  <p>The Isaurian who had been sent to Narses, entered with a sealed
  letter.</p>

  <p>"To Cethegus Cæsarius: Narses, the magister militum. There is nothing to
  prevent your carrying out your wish to go to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Now I understand," said Cethegus, and read on:</p>

  <p>"The sentinels have orders to let you ride forth. But, if you insist upon
  going, I will give you a thousand Longobardians under Alboin as an escort,
  for the roads are very unsafe. As, in all probability, an attempt will be
  made by the Goths, to-day or tomorrow, to break through our lines, and
  repeated foolhardy sallies on the part of my soldiers have led to the loss of
  leaders and troops, I have ordered that no one be permitted to leave the camp
  without my express permission, and have entrusted the watch, even that of the
  tents, to my Longobardians."</p>

  <p>Cethegus sprang to the entrance of his tent, and tore the curtains open.
  His four Isaurians were just being led away. Twenty Longobardians, under
  Autharis, drew up before the tent.</p>

  <p>"I had thought of escaping to-night," he said to Syphax, turning back. "It
  is now impossible. But it is better so, more dignified. Rather a Gothic spear
  in my breast, than a Grecian arrow in my back. But I have not yet read all
  that Narses writes."</p>

  <p>He read on:</p>

  <p>"If you will come to my tent, you will learn what measures I have taken
  against the probably great bloodshed which will ensue if the barbarians
  venture to sally, as they threaten. But I have still a painful communication
  to make to you. News, which reached me yesterday evening by sea from Rome,
  informs me that your tribunes and the greater part of the Isaurians have been
  killed."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Licinius, Piso, Julianus!" cried the Prefect, startled out of his icy
  and defiant calmness by deep pain.</p>

  <p>After a pause he controlled his emotion sufficiently to take up the letter
  and read on:</p>

  <p>"When they had been quietly admitted into the city (shamefully decoyed!)
  they refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Emperor. They tried,
  contrary to their promise, to use force. Lucius Licinius attempted to take
  the Capitol by storm; Piso, the Porta Latina; Salvus Julianus, the Mausoleum.
  They fell, each before the place which he attacked. What remained of the
  Isaurians were taken prisoners."</p>

  <p>"My second Julius follows the first!" cried Cethegus. "Well, I do not need
  an heir, for Rome will never now be mine! It is over! The great struggle for
  Rome is over! And brute force, small cunning, has conquered the mind of
  Cethegus as it did the sword of the Goth. O Romans, Romans! <i>You, too, my
  sons?</i> You are my Brutus. Come, Syphax, you are free. I go to meet death.
  Go back to your deserts."</p>

  <p>"O master!" cried Syphax, sobbing passionately, as he crouched at the feet
  of Cethegus. "Do not send me from you! I am not less faithful than Aspa! Let
  me die with you!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said Cethegus quietly, and laying his hand upon the Moor's
  head. "I have loved you, my panther! Then die with me. Give me my helm,
  shield, sword, and spear."</p>

  <p>"Whither go you?"</p>

  <p>"First to Narses."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"To Vesuvius!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-13"
     name="b6-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">King Teja's intention was to throw himself at night with all
  his armed men&mdash;except a few guards who would be left in the
  ravine&mdash;into the camp of Narses, and there, favoured by the darkness and
  surprise, to commit great carnage.</p>

  <p>Then, when the last of his warriors had fallen, and&mdash;probably at
  daybreak&mdash;the enemy prepared to assault the pass, the unarmed
  people&mdash;at least those who did not prefer slavery to death&mdash;were to
  seek an honourable grave in the neighbouring crater of Vesuvius, after which
  the few remaining defendants of the pass would sally forth and die
  fighting.</p>

  <p>When the King called his people together, and left the alternative to
  their choice, he was filled with pride and joy to find that not one voice
  among the thousands of women and children&mdash;for all the boys from ten
  years of age and all the old men were armed&mdash;was raised in favour of
  dishonour rather than death. His hero soul rejoiced in the thought that his
  whole race, by a deed unheard of in the history of nations, would die a
  glorious and heroic death, and worthily seal the renown of their great
  past.</p>

  <p>However, the despairing idea of the grim hero was not to be carried out.
  His dying eyes were to behold a brighter and more consoling picture. Narses,
  ever watchful and wary, had noticed the mysterious preparations of his
  enemies even sooner than Johannes and Cethegus, and had called a meeting of
  generals, which was to be held in his tent at the fifth hour, in order to
  explain to them his counter-measures.</p>

  <p>It was a lovely September morning, full of shining light and shining mist
  over land and sea; a golden glow, such as, even in Italy, is only poured
  forth in like wondrous beauty over the Bay of Neapolis.</p>

  <p>Into the clear sky curled the white cloud of smoke from the summit of
  Vesuvius. Upon the curved line of the shore the smooth and gentle waves
  rolled in a rhythmic measure. Close to the edge of the water&mdash;so close
  that the ripples of the waves often wetted his steel-shod feet&mdash;a lonely
  man walked slowly along, carrying his spear over his shoulder, and apparently
  coming from the left wing of the Byzantine army. The sun glistened upon his
  round shield, upon his splendid armour. The sea-breeze played with his
  crimson crest.</p>

  <p>It was Cethegus; and the way he was going led to the gates of death. He
  was followed at a short distance by the Moor. He soon reached a little
  promontory which stretched out into the bay, and going to its outer point, he
  turned and looked towards the northwest. There lay Rome&mdash;his Rome.</p>

  <p>"Farewell!" he cried with deep emotion; "farewell, ye seven immortal
  hills! Farewell, old Tiber stream! thou that hast laved the venerable ruins
  through many centuries. Twice hast thou tasted my blood; twice hast thou
  saved my life. Now, kindly River-god, thou canst save me no more! I have
  striven and fought for thee, my Rome, as none of thy children, not even
  Cæsar, has ever done before.&mdash;The struggle is over; the general without
  an army is vanquished. I now acknowledge that a mighty intellect may possibly
  supply the place of a single man, but not the want of a whole nation's
  patriotism. Intellect can preserve its own youth, but it cannot renew that of
  others, I have tried to do what is impossible; for to do only what is
  possible is common; and it is better to fall striving for the superhuman than
  to be lost in dull resignation among the common herd. But"&mdash;and he
  kneeled down and wet his hot forehead with the salt water&mdash;"be thou
  blessed, Ansonia's sacred flood; be thou blessed, Italians sacred
  soil!"&mdash;and he put his hand deep into the sea sand&mdash;"thy most
  faithful son parts from thee with a thankful heart&mdash;moved, not by the
  terrors of approaching death, but only by thy beauty. I forebode for thee,
  Italia, an oppressive foreign rule; I have not been able to turn it aside,
  but I have offered up my heart's blood; and if the laurels of thy Empire are
  for ever withered&mdash;may the olive of thy people's love of freedom still
  bloom amid the ruins of thy cities, and may the day quickly come when no
  foreign master rules in all the length and breadth of the land, and when thou
  art mistress of thyself from the sacred Alps to the sacred sea!"</p>

  <p>He rose quietly, and now walked more rapidly through the centre camp to
  the tent of the commander-in-chief. When he entered it, he found all the
  generals and officers assembled. Narses called to him in a friendly voice,
  saying:</p>

  <p>"You come at the right moment, Cethegus. Twelve of my officers, whom I
  have discovered in a foolish league, such as barbarians, but not the scholars
  o£ Narses, might make, have appealed to you in excuse. They say that what is
  shared in by the wise Cethegus cannot be foolish. Speak! have you really
  joined this league against Teja?"</p>

  <p>"I have; and when I leave you&mdash;let me be the first, Johannes, without
  casting lots&mdash;I go straight to Vesuvius. The hour of the King's watch
  approaches."</p>

  <p>"This pleases me, Cethegus."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. It will, no doubt, save you much trouble, <i>Prefect of
  Rome</i>," answered Cethegus.</p>

  <p>A movement of extreme surprise escaped all present; for even those who
  were initiated into the secret were amazed that Cethegus knew the position of
  affairs.</p>

  <p>Narses alone remained unmoved. He merely said in a low voice to
  Basiliskos:</p>

  <p>"He knows all, and it is well that he does so." Then he turned to Cethegus
  and said: "It is not my fault, Cethegus, that I did not tell you sooner of
  your dismissal; the Emperor had strictly forbidden me to do so. I approve of
  your resolve, for it agrees with my best intentions.&mdash;The barbarians
  shall not have the pleasure of slaying another myriad of my people tonight.
  We will march forward at once with all our troops, including both our wings,
  to within a spear's throw from the pass. We will not leave the Goths room to
  sally far out. The first step they take beyond the mouth of the ravine shall
  be amongst our spears. I have also nothing to object, Cethegus, if volunteers
  offer to fight that King of terrors. With his death, I hope, the resistance
  of the Goths will cease. Only one thing makes me anxious. I have long ago
  ordered up the Ionian fleet&mdash;for I expected that all would be over a few
  days earlier&mdash;and yet it has not arrived. The ships are to take the
  captured barbarians on board at once, and carry them to Byzantium.&mdash;Has
  the swift-sailer which I sent to gather news beyond the Straits, of Regium
  not yet returned. Captain Konon?"</p>

  <p>"No, general. Neither has a second swift ship, which I sent after the
  first."</p>

  <p>"Can the late storm have damaged the fleet?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible, general! It was not violent enough. And the fleets according
  to the last reports, lay safe at anchor in the harbour of Brundusium."</p>

  <p>"Well, we cannot wait for the ships! Forward, my leaders! We will march at
  once to the pass. Farewell, Cethegus! Do not let your dismissal disquiet you.
  I fear that you will be menaced with many a troublesome process when the war
  is ended. You have many enemies, rightly and wrongly. There are bad omens
  against you. But I know that from the very beginning you have believed in
  only one omen&mdash;'The only omen'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Is to die for the fatherland!' Grant me one more favour, Narses. Allow
  me&mdash;for my Isaurians and tribunes are in Rome&mdash;to gather round me
  all the Italians and Romans whom you have divided among your troops, and lead
  them against the barbarians."</p>

  <p>For one moment Narses hesitated. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"Well, go; gather them together and lead them&mdash;to death," he added in
  a low voice to Basiliskos. "There are at most fifteen hundred men. I do not
  grudge him the pleasure of falling at the head of his countrymen. Nor them
  the pleasure of falling behind him!&mdash;Farewell, Cethegus."</p>

  <p>Silently greeting Narses with his uplifted spear, Cethegus left the
  tent.</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Narses to Alboin, "you may well look after him, Longobardian.
  There goes a remarkable piece of universal history. Do you know who that is
  marching away?"</p>

  <p>"A great enemy to his enemies," said Alboin gravely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, wolf, look at him again; there goes to his death&mdash;the last
  Roman!"</p>

  <p>When all the leaders, except Basiliskos and Alboin, had left Narses, there
  hurried into the tent from behind a curtain, Anicius, Scævola, and Albinus,
  still in the disguise of Longobardians, and with faces full of alarm.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Scævola, "will you save that man from his judges?"</p>

  <p>"And his body from the executioner; and his fortune from his accusers?"
  added Albinus.</p>

  <p>Anicius was silent; he only clenched his hand upon the hilt of his
  sword.</p>

  <p>"General," said Alboin, "let these two brawlers put off the dress of my
  people. I am disgusted with them."</p>

  <p>"You are not wrong there, wolf!" said Narses; and turning to the others he
  said, "you need no further disguise. You are useless to me as accusers.
  Cethegus is judged; and the sentence will be carried out&mdash;by King Teja.
  But you, you ravens, shall not hack at the hero after he is dead."</p>

  <p>"And the order of the Emperor?" asked Scævola stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Even Justinian cannot blind and crucify a dead man. When Cethegus
  Cæsarius has fallen, I cannot wake him up again to please the Emperor's
  cruelty. And of his money, you, Albinus, shall not receive a single solidus,
  nor you, Scævola, one drop of his blood. His gold is for the Emperor, his
  blood for the Goths, and his name for immortality."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish the death of a hero for that wretch?" now asked Anicius
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Yes, son of Boëthius; for he has deserved it! But you have a veritable
  right to revenge yourself on him&mdash;you shall behead the fallen man, and
  take his head to the Emperor at Byzantium. Do you not hear the tuba? The
  fight has commenced!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-14"
     name="b6-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">When King Teja saw the whole of Narses' forces advancing
  towards the mouth of the pass, he said to his heroes:</p>

  <p>"It seems that instead of the stars, the mid-day sun is to shine upon the
  last battle of the Goths! That is the only change in our plan."</p>

  <p>He then placed a number of warriors in front of the hollow in the lava,
  showed them the royal treasure and the corpse of Theodoric, raised upon a
  purple throne, and ordered them to pay attention while the fight for the pass
  was raging, and, on receiving a sign from Adalgoth&mdash;to whom and Wachis
  he had confided the last defence of the pass&mdash;at once to throw the
  throne and the coffers into the crater. The unarmed people pressed together
  round the lava cave&mdash;not a tear was seen, not a sigh was heard.</p>

  <p>Teja arranged his men into hundreds, and these hundreds into families, so
  that father and sons, brothers and cousins, fought at each other's side; an
  order of battle the terrible obstinacy of which the Romans had often
  experienced since the days of the Cimbrians and Teutons, of Ariovist and
  Armin. The natural construction of the last battlefield of the Goths
  necessitated of itself the old order of battle inherited from Odin&mdash;the
  wedge.</p>

  <p>The deep and close columns of the Byzantines now stood in orderly ranks
  from the shore of the sea to within a spear's throw from the mouth of the
  pass: a magnificent but fearful spectacle. The sun shone brightly upon their
  weapons, while the Goths still stood in the deep shadow of the rocks. Far
  away over the spears and standards of the enemy, the Goths beheld the lovely
  blue sea, the surface of which flashed with a silvery light.</p>

  <p>King Teja stood near Adalgoth, who carried the banner of Theodoric, at the
  mouth of the pass. All the poet was roused in the Hero-King.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said to his favourite, "what more lovely place could a man have
  to die in? It cannot be more beautiful in the heaven of the Christian, nor in
  Master Hildebrand's Asgard or Breidablick. Up, Adalgoth! Let us die here,
  worthy of our nation and of this beauteous death-place."</p>

  <p>He threw back the purple mantle which he wore over his black steel armour,
  took the little harp upon his left arm, and sang in a low, restrained
  voice:</p>

  <p>"From farthest North till Rome&mdash;Byzant&mdash; The Goths to battle
  call! In glory rose the Goths' bright star&mdash; In glory shall it fall! Our
  swords raised high, we fight for fame; Heroes with heroes vie; Farewell, thou
  noble hero-race&mdash; Up, Goths, and let us die!"</p>

  <p>And he shattered the still vibrating harp upon the rocks at his feet.</p>

  <p>"And now, Adalgoth, farewell! Would that I could have saved the rest of my
  people! Not here; but by an unobstructed retreat to the north. It was not to
  be. Narses would never grant it, and the last of the Goths cannot <i>beg</i>.
  Now let us go&mdash;to death!"</p>

  <p>And raising his dreaded weapon, the mighty battleaxe with its lance-like
  shaft, he stepped to the head of the "wedge," Behind him Aligern, his cousin,
  and old Hildebrand. Behind them Duke Guntharis of Tuscany, the Wölfung, Earl
  Grippa of Ravenna, and Earl Wisand of Volsinii, the standard-bearer. Behind
  them again, Wisand's brother, Ragnaris of Tarentum, and four earls, his
  kinsmen. Then, in ever-broadening front, first six, then ten Goths. The rear
  was formed of close ranks, arranged by tens.</p>

  <p>Wachis, halting in the pass near Adalgoth, blew, at a sign from the King,
  a signal on the Gothic war-horn, and the assaulting force marched out of the
  ravine.</p>

  <p>The heroes in league with Johannes stood upon the first level place close
  before the pass; only Alboin, Gisulf, and Cethegus were still missing. Next
  behind the ten leaders stood Longobardians and Herulians, who at once greeted
  the advancing Goths with a hail of spears.</p>

  <p>The first to rush upon the King, who was easily recognisable by the crown
  upon his helmet, was Althias the Armenian. He fell dead at once, his skull
  split to the ears.</p>

  <p>The second was the Herulian, Rodulf. Holding his spear at his left side
  with both hands, he rushed at Teja. Teja stood firm, and, receiving the
  stroke upon his narrow shield, pierced his adversary through the body with
  the lance-like point of his battle-axe. Rodulf staggered back at the shock,
  then fell dead.</p>

  <p>Before Teja could disengage his weapon from the scales of his enemy's
  mail-coat, Suartua, the nephew of the fallen Herulian, the Persian Kabades,
  and the Bajuvar Garizo, all attacked him at once.</p>

  <p>Teja thrust back the last&mdash;the nearest and boldest&mdash;with such
  vigour, that he fell in the narrow and slippery lava path, and over a
  declivity on the right.</p>

  <p>"Now help, O holy virgin of Neapolis!" cried the tall man as he flew
  downwards. "Help me, as you have done during all these years of war!" And,
  but little damaged, Miriam's admirer came to a stop, slightly stunned by his
  fall.</p>

  <p>The Herulian Suartua was brandishing his sword over Teja's head, when
  Aligern, springing forward, struck his arm clean off his shoulder. Suartua
  screamed and fell.</p>

  <p>Kabades, who tried to rip up the King's body with his long and crooked
  scimetar, had his brains dashed out by old Hildebrand's stone axe.</p>

  <p>Teja, again become master of his battle-axe, and rid of his nearest foes,
  now sprang forward to attack in his turn. He hurled his axe at a man in a
  boar-helmet&mdash;that is, a helmet decorated with the head and tusks of a
  wild boar. It was Epurulf, the Alamannian, who fell backwards to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Above Teja bent Vadomar, Epurulf's kinsman, and tried to possess himself
  of the Gothic King's terrible weapon; but Teja was upon him in a moment, his
  short sword in his right hand. It flashed, and Vadomar fell dead upon the
  corpse of his friend.</p>

  <p>The two Franks, Chlotachar and Bertchramn, hurried up at the same moment,
  swinging the franciska, a weapon similar to Teja's battle-axe. Both axes
  whizzed through the air at once. Teja caught one upon his shield; the second,
  which came hurtling at his head, he parried with his own axe, and in another
  moment he stood between his two adversaries, whirled his axe round him in a
  circle, and at one blow the two Franks fell right and left, both their
  helmets beaten in.</p>

  <p>At that moment a spear struck the King's shield; it pierced the steel rim,
  and slightly grazed his arm. As he turned to meet this enemy&mdash;it was the
  Burgundian Gundobad&mdash;Ardarich, the Gepide, ran at him from behind with
  his drawn sword, and struck him a heavy blow on the top of his helmet. But
  the next moment Ardarich fell, pierced through by the spear of Duke
  Guntharis; and the King pressed Gundobad, who defended himself valiantly,
  down upon his knees. Gundobad lost his helmet in the struggle, and Teja
  thrust the spike of his shield into his throat.</p>

  <p>But already Taulantius the Illyrian and Autharis the Longobardian stood
  before Teja. The Illyrian struck at the King's shield with a heavy club made
  of the root of the ilex, and broke off a piece of the lower rim. At the same
  time, just above the crack thus made, a lance, hurled by the Longobardian,
  struck the shield and tore off the fastening of the spike, sticking with its
  hook into the hole, and dragging the shield down by its weight.</p>

  <p>Already Taulantius raised his club over the King's head. But Teja did not
  loiter; sacrificing his half-shattered shield, he dashed it into the
  Illyrian's visorless face, letting it go; and almost at the same moment he
  thrust the point of his battle-axe through the breast-plate of Autharis, who
  was rushing upon him. But now the King stood without a shield, and his
  distant enemies redoubled their hail of spears and arrows. With axe and
  sword, Teja parried the thickly falling darts.</p>

  <p>An alarum from the pass caused him to look round. He saw that the greater
  part of the warriors whom he had led out of the ravine had fallen. The
  innumerable projectiles hurled from a distance had done their deadly work,
  and already, advancing from the left, a powerful division of Longobardians,
  Persians, and Armenians, had attacked them in the flank, and now mingled in a
  hand-to-hand fight.</p>

  <p>On the right the King saw a column of Thracians, Macedonians, and Franks
  press forward against the guardians of the pass with spears couched; while a
  third division&mdash;Gepidians, Alamannians, Isaurians, and Illyrians, tried
  to cut off himself and the small troop which still stood at his back from the
  retreat into the pass.</p>

  <p>Teja looked sharply towards the pass. For a moment the banner of Theodoric
  disappeared&mdash;it seemed to have fallen. This circumstance decided the
  King.</p>

  <p>"Back into the pass! Save Theodoric's banner!" he cried to those behind
  him, and tried to break through the troop of enemies which surrounded
  him.</p>

  <p>But they were in terrible earnest, for they were led by Johannes.</p>

  <p>"Upon the King," lie cried. "Do not let him through. Do not let him go
  back! Spears! Throw!"</p>

  <p>Aligern had come up.</p>

  <p>"Take my shield!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Teja caught the proffered shield just in time to receive the lance hurled
  by Johannes, which would otherwise have pierced his visor.</p>

  <p>"Back to the pass!" again Teja cried, and rushed with such impetuosity
  upon Johannes, that the latter fell to the ground. The two nearest Isaurians
  succumbed to Teja's sword.</p>

  <p>And now Teja, Aligern, Guntharis, Hildebrand, Grippa, Wisand and Ragnaris
  hurried back to the pass. But here the battle was already raging. Alboin and
  Gisulf had stormed the pass, and a heavy, pointed block of lava, hurled by
  Alboin, had struck Adalgoth on the thigh, and caused him to sink upon his
  knees. But Wachis had caught the falling banner, and Adalgoth, quickly
  rising, had pushed the Longobardian, who was pressing forward, out of the
  pass with the spike of his shield.</p>

  <p>The sudden return of the King with his little troop of heroes relieved the
  almost overpowered guardians of the pass. The Longobardians fell in heaps
  before the unexpected assault in their rear. With loud cries the two
  guardians of the pass rushed forth, and the Longobardians, carrying their
  leaders along irresistibly, ran and leaped over the jagged lava in their
  downward retreat. But they did not run far. They were absorbed by the ranks
  of Isaurians, and Illyrians, Gepidians and Alamannians, who advanced in
  force, led by Johannes. Gnashing his teeth, he had risen from his fall, had
  set his helmet straight, and at once led his men against the pass, into which
  Teja had now entered.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" cried Johannes; "up and at him, Alboin, Gisulf, Vitalianus,
  Zenon! Let us see if this King be really spear-proof!"</p>

  <p>Teja had now taken up his old position at the mouth of the pass, and
  leaning upon the shaft of his battle-axe, he rested awhile to cool
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Now, barbarian King! the end is at hand! Have you crept again into your
  snail-shell? Come out, or I will make a hole in your house. Come out, if you
  be a man!"</p>

  <p>Thus cried Johannes, twirling his spear over his head in defiance.</p>

  <p>"Give me three spears!" cried Teja, and gave his shield and battle-axe to
  Adalgoth, who stood near him still, though wounded. "There! Now, as soon as
  he falls, follow me out."</p>

  <p>And he took one step forward out of the pass, without his shield, and
  holding his three spears in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to the open! and to death!" cried Johannes, as he hurled his
  spear.</p>

  <p>The spear was accurately aimed at the King's visor. But Teja bent to one
  side, and the strong ashen lance was shattered against the opposite rock.</p>

  <p>As soon as Teja hurled his first spear in return, Johannes cast himself
  upon his face; the spear flew over him and killed Zenon, who stood close
  behind.</p>

  <p>Johannes quickly recovered his feet, and rushed at the King like
  lightning, catching the King's second spear, which immediately followed the
  first, upon his shield. But Teja, immediately after hurling this second lance
  with his right hand, had followed it up by a third with his left, and this
  spear, unnoticed by Johannes, passed completely through the latter's body,
  the point coming out at his back. The brave man fell.</p>

  <p>At this his Isaurians and Illyrians were seized with terror; for, after
  Belisarius, Johannes was looked upon as the first hero of Byzantium. They
  cried aloud, turned, and fled in wild disorder down the mountain, followed by
  Teja and his heroes. For one moment the Longobardians, who had again
  collected together, still held firm.</p>

  <p>"Come, Gisulf&mdash;clench your teeth&mdash;let us stand against this
  death-dealing King," cried Alboin.</p>

  <p>But Teja was already upon them. His fearful battle-axe glittered above,
  between them. Pierced through his armour deep into the left shoulder, Alboin
  fell, and immediately afterwards Gisulf lay on the ground with his helmet
  shattered. Then there was no more stopping the rest: Longobardians,
  Gepidians, Alamannians, Herulians, Isaurians and Illyrians, scattered in
  headlong flight, rushed down the mountain.</p>

  <p>With shouts of exultation, Teja's companions followed. Teja himself kept
  to the pass. He called to Wachis for spear after spear, and aiming high over
  the Gothic pursuers, hurled them at the flying enemy, killing whomsoever he
  touched.</p>

  <p>They were the Emperor's best troops. In their flight they carried away
  with them the Macedonians, Thracians, Persians, Armenians, and Franks, who
  were slowly climbing the ascent, and fled until they reached Narses, who had
  anxiously raised himself upright in his litter.</p>

  <p>"Johannes has fallen!"</p>

  <p>"Alboin is severely wounded!" they cried as they ran past. "Fly! Back into
  the camp!"</p>

  <p>"A new column of attack must be&mdash;Ha! look!" said Narses, "there comes
  Cethegus, at the very nick of time!"</p>

  <p>And Cethegus it was. He had completed his long ride through all the troops
  to which Narses had sent Romans and Italians; he had formed these into five
  companies of three hundred men each, and when they were drawn up in battle
  array, he took his place quietly at their head.</p>

  <p>Anicius followed at a distance. Syphax, carrying two spears, kept close
  behind his master. Letting the defeated fugitives pass through the vacant
  spaces between their ranks, the Italians marched on. Most of them were old
  legionaries of Rome and Ravenna, and faithfully attached to Cethegus.</p>

  <p>The Gothic pursuers hesitated as they met with these fresh, well-ordered
  troops, and slowly receded to the pass. But Cethegus followed. Past the
  bloody place, covered with corpses, where Teja had first destroyed the league
  of the twelve; past the spot farther up, where Johannes had fallen, he
  marched on with a quiet and steady step, his shield and spear in his left
  hand, his sword in his right. Behind him, with lances couched, came the
  legionaries.</p>

  <p>They marched up the mountain in silence, without the word of command, or
  the flourish of trumpets. The Gothic heroes would not retreat into the pass
  behind their King. They halted before the entrance.</p>

  <p>Guntharis was the first with whom Cethegus came into contact. The Duke's
  spear was shattered on the shield of Cethegus, and at once Cethegus thrust
  his spear into his adversary's body; the deadly shaft broke in the wound.</p>

  <p>Earl Grippa of Ravenna set to work to avenge the Wölfung; he swung his
  long sword over his head; but Cethegus ran under the thrust, and struck the
  old follower of Theodoric below the right shoulder with his broad Roman
  sword. Grippa fell and died.</p>

  <p>Wisand, the standard-bearer, advanced furiously against Cethegus; their
  blades crossed; sparks flew from shield and helmet; but Cethegus cleverly
  parried a too hasty stroke, and before the Goth could recover himself, the
  broad blade of the Roman had entered his thigh. Wisand tottered. Two of his
  cousins bore him out of the fight.</p>

  <p>His brother, Ragnaris of Tarentum, now attacked Cethegus, but Syphax,
  running up, caught the well-thrust spear in his hand, and before Ragnaris
  could let fall the shaft, and draw his axe from his belt, Cethegus stabbed
  him in the forehead.</p>

  <p>Struck with horror, the Goths retreated before the terrible Roman, and
  pressed past their King into the ravine. Aligern alone, Teja's cousin, would
  not yield. He hurled his spear with such force at the shield of Cethegus,
  that it pierced it; but Cethegus lowered it quickly, and received Aligern, as
  he rushed forward, on the point of his sword. Severely wounded, Aligern fell
  into old Hildebrand's arms, who, letting fall his heavy stone axe, tried to
  carry the fainting man into the ravine.</p>

  <p>But Aligern's spear had also been well-aimed. The shield-arm of Cethegus
  bled profusely. But he did not heed it; he pressed on to make an end of both
  the Goths, Hildebrand and Aligern, and at that moment Adalgoth caught sight
  of his father's hated enemy.</p>

  <p>"Alaric! Alaric!" he shouted, and, springing forward, he caught up the
  heavy stone axe from the ground. "Alaric!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Cethegus caught the name and looked up. The axe, accurately aimed, came
  whizzing through the air upon his tall helmet. Stunned, Cethegus fell. Syphax
  sprang to him, took him in both his arms, and carried him aside. But the
  legionaries would not retreat; they could not. Behind them, sent by Narses,
  two thousand Persians and Thracians pressed up the ascent.</p>

  <p>"Bring hurling spears!" commanded their leader, Aniabedes. "No
  hand-to-hand fight! Cast spears at the King until he fall. By order of
  Narses!"</p>

  <p>The soldiers willingly obeyed this order, which promised to spare their
  blood. Presently such a fearful hail of darts rattled against the narrow
  opening of the pass, that not a Goth was able to issue forth and stand before
  the King.</p>

  <p>And now Teja, filling the entrance with his body and his shield, defended
  his people for some time&mdash;for a very considerable time&mdash;quite
  alone. Procopius, following the report of eye-witnesses, has described with
  admiration this, the last fight of King Teja:</p>

  <p>"I have now to describe a very remarkable fight, and the heroism of a man
  who is inferior to none of those we call heroes&mdash;of Teja. He stood,
  visible to all, covered by his shield, and brandishing his spear, in front of
  his own ranks. All the bravest Romans, whose number was great, attacked him
  alone; for with his death, they thought, the battle would be at an end. All
  hurled and thrust their lances at him alone; but he received the darts upon
  his shield, and, repeatedly sallying forth, killed numbers of his
  adversaries, one after the other. And when his shield was stuck so full of
  darts that it was too heavy for him to hold, he signed to his shield-bearer
  to bring him a fresh one. Thus he stood; not turning, nor throwing his shield
  on his back and retreating, but firm as a rock, dealing death to his foes
  with his right hand, warding it off with his left, and ever calling to his
  weapon-bearers for new shields and new spears."</p>

  <p>It was Wachis and Adalgoth&mdash;heaps of shields and spears had been
  brought to the spot from the royal treasure&mdash;who continually handed to
  Teja fresh weapons.</p>

  <p>At last the courage of the Romans, Persians, and Thracians sank as they
  saw all their efforts wrecked against this living shield of the Goths, and
  all their bravest men slain by the spears of the King. They wavered&mdash;the
  Italians called anxiously upon Cethegus&mdash;they turned and fled. Then
  Cethegus started up from his long stupor.</p>

  <p>"Syphax, a fresh spear! Halt! Stand, Romans! Roma, Roma eterna!" And
  raising himself with an effort, he advanced against Teja.</p>

  <p>The Romans recognised his voice. "Roma, Roma eterna!" they shouted, as
  they ceased their flight and halted. But Teja had also recognised the voice.
  His shield bristled with twelve lances&mdash;he could hold it no longer; but
  when he recognised the adversary who was advancing, he thought no more of
  changing it.</p>

  <p>"No shield! My battle-axe! Quick!" he cried.</p>

  <p>And Wachis handed to him his favourite weapon.</p>

  <p>Then King Teja dropped his shield, and, swinging his axe, rushed out of
  the pass at Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Die, Roman!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Once again the two great enemies looked each other in the face. Then spear
  and axe whizzed through the air. Neither thought of parrying the stroke, and
  both fell. Teja's axe had pierced Cethegus's left breast through shield and
  armour.</p>

  <p>"Roma, Roma eterna!" once more cried Cethegus, and fell back dead.</p>

  <p>His spear had struck the King's right breast. Not dead, but mortally
  wounded, he was carried into the pass by Hildebrand and Adalgoth. And they
  had need to make haste. For when, at last, they saw the King of the Goths
  fall&mdash;he had fought without a pause for eight hours, and evening was
  coming on&mdash;all the Italians, Persians, and Thracians, and fresh columns
  of attack which had now come up, rushed towards the pass, which was now again
  defended by Adalgoth with his shield; Hildebrand and Wachis supporting
  him.</p>

  <p>Syphax took the body of Cethegus in his arms and carried it to one side.
  Weeping aloud he held the noble head of his master upon his knees, the
  features of which appeared almost superhuman in the majesty of death. Before
  him raged the battle. Just then the Moor remarked that Anicius, followed by a
  troop of Byzantines&mdash;Scævola and Albinus among them&mdash;was
  approaching him, and pointing to the body of Cethegus with an air of
  command.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" cried Syphax, springing up as they drew near; "what do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"The head of the Prefect, to take to the Emperor," answered Anicius;
  "obey, slave!"</p>

  <p>But Syphax uttered a yell&mdash;his spear rushed through the air, and
  Anicius fell. And before the others, who at once busied themselves with the
  dying man, could come near him, Syphax had taken his beloved burden upon his
  back, and began to climb up a steep precipice of lava near the pass, which
  Goths and Byzantines had, till then, held to be impassable. More and more
  rapidly the slave advanced. His goal was a little column of smoke which rose
  just at the other side of the cliff. For there yawned one of the small crater
  chasms of Vesuvius. For one moment Syphax stopped upon the edge of the black
  rocks; once again he raised the corpse of Cethegus erect in his strong arms,
  as if to show the noble form to the setting sun. And suddenly master and
  slave had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The fiery mountain had received the faithful Syphax and the dead Cethegus,
  his greatness and his guilt, onto its glowing bosom. The hero was snatched
  away from the small spite of his enemies.</p>

  <p>Scævola and Albinus, who had witnessed the occurrence, hastened to Narses,
  and demanded that the corpse should be sought for on the sides of the crater.
  But Narses said:</p>

  <p>"I do not grudge the mighty hero his mighty grave. He has deserved it. I
  fight with the living, and not with the dead."</p>

  <p>But almost at the same moment, the tumultuous battle round the pass, which
  Adalgoth, not unworthy of his royal master, heroically defended against the
  attacks of the enemy, ceased. For while, standing behind Adalgoth, Hildebrand
  and Wachis suddenly cried, "Look! look at the sea! The dragon ships! The
  northern heroes! Harald! Harald!"&mdash;the solemn tones of the tuba were
  heard from below, sounding the signal for a cessation of
  hostilities&mdash;for a truce. Very gladly the fatigued and harassed warriors
  lowered their weapons.</p>

  <p>But King Teja, who lay upon his shield&mdash;Hildebrand had forbidden
  every one to draw out the spear of Cethegus from the wound&mdash;"for his
  life would flow out with his blood"&mdash;asked in a faint voice:</p>

  <p>"What do I hear them cry? The northern heroes? The ships? Is Harald
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Harald! He comes to our rescue! He brings safety for the rest of the
  nation! For us, and for the women and children!" cried Adalgoth joyously, as
  he knelt at Teja's side. "So thy incomparable heroism, my ever-beloved hero;
  thy superhuman and untiring efforts, were not in vain! Basiliskos has just
  come, sent by Narses. Harald has destroyed the Ionian fleet in the harbour of
  Brundusium; he threatens to land and attack the already exhausted Byzantines;
  he demands to be allowed to carry away all the remaining Goths, with weapons
  and goods, to Thuleland and liberty! Narses has agreed; he will honour, he
  says, King Teja's noble heroism, in the remnant of his people. May we accept?
  Oh, may we accept, my King?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Teja, as his eyes grew dim. "You may and shall. The rest of my
  people free! The women, the children, delivered from a terrible death! Oh,
  happy that I am! Yes, take all who live to Thuleland; and take with
  you&mdash;two of the dead: King Theodoric&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And King Teja!" said Adalgoth: and kissed the dead man's mouth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b6-15"
     name="b6-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">And so it happened, and this was the manner of it.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Narses had left his tent, a fisherman was led before
  him, who had just sailed round the promontory of Surrentum in a small and
  swift vessel, and who announced that an immense fleet of the Goths was in
  full sail for the coast. Narses laughed; for he knew that not a Gothic sail
  was to be found on all the seas.</p>

  <p>More narrowly questioned, the man was obliged to confess that he had not
  seen the fleet himself; but merchants had told him of it, and had related
  that a great naval combat had taken place, in which the Goths had destroyed
  the Emperor's fleet, at Brundusium.</p>

  <p>That was impossible, as Narses well knew. And when the fisherman described
  the appearance of the pretended Gothic ships, according to what his informers
  had told him, the commander-in-chief cried out:</p>

  <p>"At last they are coming! Triremes and galleys! They are our ships which
  are approaching, not Gothic vessels."</p>

  <p>No one thought of the Viking's fleet, which had not been heard of for four
  moons, and which, it was believed, had sailed to the north.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, as the battle was raging round the pass, engrossing the
  attention of all, the coastguards announced to Narses the fact of the
  approach of a very large imperial fleet. The ship of the admiral, the Sophia,
  had been distinctly recognised. But the number of sails was far greater than
  had been expected. The ships which Narses had sent to urge the coming of the
  fleet were also among them, sailing first. The strong south-eastern breeze
  would shortly bring them within sight of the camp.</p>

  <p>And presently Narses himself could enjoy from the hill the magnificent
  spectacle of the approach of the fleet, propelled not only by their spreading
  sails, but also by their long oars.</p>

  <p>Much relieved, he again turned his attention to the combat upon
  Vesuvius&mdash;when, suddenly, messengers reached him from the camp,
  affirming the first reports in an alarming manner, or rather, they brought
  much worse news. They had hurried on in advance of an embassy which reached
  the litter of Narses just as Cethegus was advancing for the last time against
  Teja.</p>

  <p>This embassy consisted of the admiral and captains of the Ionian fleet,
  who came forward with their hands in chains, and guarded by four Northmen,
  whose message they had been brought to interpret. They briefly related that
  they had been attacked by the fleet of the Viking one stormy night, and had
  lost almost all their ships; that not one could escape to warn Narses, for
  the enemy had blockaded the harbour.</p>

  <p>When Jarl Harald had heard of the threatened destruction of the Goths upon
  Vesuvius, he had sworn to prevent or to share their evil fate. And sending
  the captured Grecian ships in advance, prudently hiding behind them his
  dragon-ships, he had hurried to the coast of Neapolis on the wings of the
  east wind. "And thus," concluded the interpreters, "thus says Harald the
  Viking: 'Either you will allow all yet living Goths, with all their weapons
  and goods, to leave the Southland upon our ships and return with us to their
  fatherland; in return for which we will give up all our thousands of
  prisoners, and all our prize-ships, except those we need for the transport of
  the Goths; or we will immediately kill our prisoners, land, and attack you,
  your camp and army, in the rear. Then see to it, how many of you, when
  attacked in front by the Goths, in the rear by us, will remain alive! For we
  Northmen fight to the last man! I have sworn it by Odin.'"</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation Narses agreed to the departure of the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>"I have only sworn to drive them out of the Empire," he said, "not out of
  the world. It would bring me small renown if I overpowered and slaughtered
  the poor remains of such a noble nation. I reverence the heroism of this
  Teja; in forty years of warfare I have never seen his like. And I have no
  desire to try how my harassed army, which has had a day of the hardest
  fighting, and has lost almost all its leaders and numbers of its bravest
  soldiers, would resist these northern giants, who come with untired strength
  and unconquered courage."</p>

  <p>And so Narses had immediately sent heralds to Harald and to the pass. The
  battle ceased; the retreat of the Goths began.</p>

  <p>In double ranks, reaching from the summit of the mountain down to the sea,
  the army of heroes formed a lane. The Viking had landed four hundred men, who
  received the Goths on the sea-shore. But before the march began, Karses
  signed to Basiliskos and said:</p>

  <p>"The Gothic war is over&mdash;the stag is killed&mdash;now away with the
  wolves which hunted him to the death. How are the wounded leaders of the
  Longobardians?"</p>

  <p>"Before I answer," said Basiliskos respectfully, "accept this
  laurel-wreath, which your army sends to you. It is laurel from Vesuvius; from
  the pass above; there is heroes' blood upon the leaves."</p>

  <p>The first impulse of Narses was to push the wreath aside; but after a
  pause, he said:</p>

  <p>"'Tis well; give it to me." But he laid it beside him in the litter.</p>

  <p>"Autharis, Warnfrid, Grimoald, Aripert, Agilulf and Rotharis are dead,"
  Basiliskos now reported. "Altogether the Longobardians have lost seven
  thousand men; Alboin and Gisulf, severely wounded, lie motionless in their
  tents."</p>

  <p>"Good, very good! As soon as the Goths have embarked, let the
  Longobardians be led away. They are dismissed my service. And say to Alboin,
  as my parting words: 'After the death of Narses&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>; but
  certainly not before.' I will remain here in my litter; support me with the
  cushions&mdash;I cannot stand&mdash;but I must witness this wonderful
  spectacle."</p>

  <p>And in truth it was a grand and moving sight to behold the last of the
  Goths, as they turned their backs upon Vesuvius and Italy, and embarked in
  the high-prowed ships which were to bear them away to the safe and sheltering
  north.</p>

  <p>From the ravine, into which not a single enemy had succeeded in
  penetrating, was heard at intervals the solemn tones of the Gothic war-horns,
  accompanied by monotonous, grave, and touching strains from the men, women,
  and children&mdash;the ancient death-song of the Gothic nation.</p>

  <p>Hildebrand and Adalgoth&mdash;the last chiefs, the hoary Past and the
  golden Future&mdash;had arranged the order of march.</p>

  <p>Foremost went, full-armed, five hundred men, led by Wisand, the
  standard-bearer, who, in spite of his wounds, bravely opened the procession,
  leaning on his spear. Then followed, stretched upon his last shield, the
  spear of Cethegus still sticking in his breast, without helmet, his noble and
  pallid face framed by his long black locks&mdash;King Teja, covered with a
  purple mantle, and carried by four warriors. Behind him came Adalgoth and
  Gotho, and Adalgoth, softly striking his harp, sang in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Give place, ye peoples, to our march: The doom of the Goths is sped! No
  crown, no sceptre carry we, We bear the noble dead.</p>

  <p>"With shield to shield, and spear to spear, We march to the Northland
  cool; Until in grey and distant seas We find the Island Thule.</p>

  <p>"That is the Isle of the brave and true, Where none dishonour fears; There
  we will lay our bravest King In his bed of oaken spears.</p>

  <p>"From off our feet&mdash;give place! give place!&mdash; We shake Rome's
  traitor dust; We only bear our King away&mdash; For the Gothic crown is
  lost!"</p>

  <p>When the bier was carried past the litter, Narses called a halt, and said
  in a low voice in the Latin language:</p>

  <p>"Mine was the victory, but his the fame! There, take the laurel wreath!
  Other generations may see greater things, but now. King Teja, I greet you as
  the greatest hero of all ages!"</p>

  <p>And he laid the laurel wreath upon the dead man's pallid brow. The bearers
  again took up the bier, and slowly and solemnly, to the sad sound of
  Adalgoth's silver harp, the death-song of the people, and the long-drawn
  tones of the war-horns, the procession marched on towards the sea, which now
  glowed magnificently in the evening red.</p>

  <p>Close behind Teja's body was carried a lofty crimson throne. Upon it
  rested the silent august form of Dietrich of Bern; upon the head the crowned
  helm; on the left arm the tall shield; a spear leaning against the right
  shoulder. On the left of the throne marched old Hildebrand, his eyes fixed
  upon the face of his beloved master, which shone in the magic light of the
  setting sun. He held aloft the banner with the device of the lion, high above
  the head of the great Dead. The evening breeze from the Ausonian Sea rustled
  in the folds of the immense flag, which, in ghost-like speech, seemed to be
  taking leave of Italian soil.</p>

  <p>As the corpse was carried past, Narses said:</p>

  <p>"I know by the shudder which passes across me that this is the wise King
  of Ravenna! First came a stronger, now a greater man. Let us do this dead man
  homage."</p>

  <p>And, with great exertion, he rose upright in his litter, and bent his head
  reverently before the corpse.</p>

  <p>Then followed the wounded, supported by or carried in the arms of their
  followers. This part of the procession was opened by Aligern, who was carried
  on a broad shield by Wachis and Liuta, assisted by two warriors. Then came
  the chests and coffers, the baskets and vessels, containing the royal
  treasure and the goods of the different families, which, until then, had been
  hidden in the wagons.</p>

  <p>Afterwards came the great mass of the unarmed people&mdash;women, girls,
  children, and old people&mdash;for the boys, from ten years of age upwards,
  would not part with the weapons which had been entrusted to them, and marched
  in a separate corps.</p>

  <p>Narses smiled as the little fair-haired heroes passed, looking up at him
  with anger and defiance.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "the Goths have taken care that the Emperor's successors
  and their generals shall not want work!"</p>

  <p>The procession was closed by the rest of the Gothic army.</p>

  <p>Innumerable boats lent their assistance in the embarkation of the people
  and their scanty possessions. Presently all were on board the high-decked
  vessels of the Northmen.</p>

  <p>The corpses of Teja and Theodoric, the royal banner, and the royal
  treasure, were taken into Harald's ship. The great Dietrich of Bern was
  placed upon his throne at the foot of the mainmast, and his lion-standard
  hoisted to the mast-head. Old Hildebrand installed himself at the foot of the
  throne.</p>

  <p>In the stern of the ship, Adalgoth and Wisand had laid down the body of
  Teja. The mighty Harald and his beautiful sister approached it sorrowfully.
  The Viking laid his mailed hand gently upon the dead man's breast, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"I could not save thee, bold and daring King! I could not save thee and
  thy people. Nothing remains but to take thee and the rest of thy folk to the
  land of the strong and the true, from which you should never have departed.
  Thus, after all, I bring back to King Frode the Gothic nation."</p>

  <p>But Haralda said:</p>

  <p>"I will preserve the body of the noble dead by secret arts, so that it
  shall endure until we land in our home. There we will vault for him and King
  Thidrekr a hill-grave near the sea, so that they may together hear the roar
  of the breakers and hold converse with each other; for they were worthy of
  each other. Look, my brother! the enemy's army stands in ranks upon the
  strand; they lower their flags and weapons in reverence, and the sun sinks
  glowing behind Misenum and yonder islands; a crimson glow covers the sea as
  with a royal mantle; our white sails are coloured red, and red gold shines
  upon our weapons! Look how the south wind spreads out the banner of King
  Thidrekr! The wind, which obeys the will of the gods, points to the north!
  Up, brother Harald! weigh anchor! direct the rudder! turn the dragon's prow!
  Up, Freya's wise bird! Fly, my falcon!"&mdash;and she tossed her falcon into
  the air&mdash;"point out the way! to the north! to Thuleland! Home! home we
  take the last of the Goths!"</p>
