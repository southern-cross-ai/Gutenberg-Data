<p class="blurb">A brawny coolie from the filthy waterfront of Hong
Kong was Emperor of Asia and master of the vast reaches of Russia.
Armed with mysterious new weapons which made the bravest man
craven, he marched ruthlessly to conquer the world, and to win the
proud daughter of the Muscovite nobility who scorned his amorous
advances... Jimmy Christopher&mdash;Operator 5 of the United States
Intelligence&mdash;had given America more than enough warning to
prepare for the barbaric, invading yellow hosts. And when all
seemed lost&mdash;when great cities were razed and countless
thousands butchered&mdash;Operator 5 finally ignored restraining
bureaucracy and pitted himself in a single-handed battle to wrest
our nation from the Coolie Emperor's bloody grasp!</p>

<h2><a id="fore" name="fore">FOREWORD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">COLD Russian sun glinted on desolate, shell-torn
fields. Here and there lay the still-smoldering debris of a wooden
house which had been struck by roaring projectiles.</p>

<p>Along the narrow, white road which paralleled the torn-up,
single-track railroad lay the bodies of gray-clad Soviet soldiers,
torn and maimed. Rifles, knapsacks, canteens, various articles of
clothing also lay strewn along the way. At the side of the road, a
gun-carriage tilted crazily in the ditch, the gun pointing
grotesquely at a sign on the opposite side which had miraculously
survived the punishing barrage that must have been laid down upon
the road not so long before. The sign read:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">Moscow&mdash;220 versts&mdash; &gt;<br>
&lt; &mdash;Leningrad&mdash;300 versts</p>
<br>

<p>An old Model T Ford touring car chugged over a rise from the
direction of Moscow. Its radiator was smoking. Icicles clung to the
windshield and to the outsides of the curtains, which were
carefully locked on to keep out the cold.</p>

<p>A thin man was driving, and beside him sat a girl of perhaps
twenty or twenty-one. They were both clothed in astrakhan coats and
caps with earmuffs. They wore heavy, fur-lined gloves. Their faces
were red from the biting cold, and the girl's eyes were
watering.</p>

<p>The driver was hunched forward over the wheel, and each time he
expelled his breath, a huge cloud of vapor issued from between his
lips, as if he were smoking. His face was thin, pinched; and at
intervals a twinge of agony crossed his features, and he put a hand
quickly to his side, where blood seeped through his coat and
stained the fur.</p>

<p>At the top of the rise, abreast of the sign, he pressed his foot
on the brake, brought the car to a squealing stop. The girl glanced
at him swiftly, put a hand on his arm, spoke with quick
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Feodor! Your wound makes you weak! Let me drive!"</p>

<p>Feodor smiled bitterly. "It is hopeless, Katerina," he answered,
in the full, guttural accents of Southern Russia, in which the girl
had also spoken. He pointed to the signpost. "It is three hundred
versts farther to Leningrad. The Russian armies have retreated all
the way. Behind us come the tanks and the motorcycles of the
Asiatic hordes. We cannot hope to outdistance them!"</p>

<p>Weakly, as if every move caused excruciating agony, he opened
the side door, stood in the road. The girl descended from the other
side of the car and joined him, looking back over the empty expanse
through which they had come. Far in the distance, the sunlight
glinted on metal.</p>

<p>Feodor raised a hand and pointed. "There they come, Katerina.
They move twice&mdash;no, three times&mdash;as fast as we. There is
no chance to escape them!"</p>

<p>Katerina's beautiful, finely chiseled features were raw from the
cold. Her black eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Feodor!" she exclaimed. "You must not give up like this!" The
patrician lines of her face hardened, set stubbornly. "Come,
Feodor. Let us go on. There may yet be a chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head. His eyes were on the metallic flashes far
back on the road. "See," he said, "the vanguard of the Leopard's
hosts will soon be upon us. Those armored motorcycles could have
caught us long ago, but the Leopard is playing with us&mdash;he
knows he will get us. He knows there is no help for us between here
and Leningrad." His thin lips tightened. "While Europe drains
itself of life in war, these hordes overrun Russia. And you and I,
sister, are the only ones who know what the Leopard plans next. If
we die here, both of us, there will be no one to warn the
world&mdash;"</p>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0603911h-images/WarMastersFromTheOrient-02.gif" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>She tugged at his arm, her insistence becoming more frantic as
the glinting metal ranks drew ever nearer. Now she could make out
the individual shapes of the armored motorcycles which seemed to be
flying toward them with the speed of rockets.</p>

<p>"All the more reason for us to escape. Come, Feodor&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Gently he pushed her hand from his arm, moved to the car, and
reached inside. From within he brought out a submachine gun,
lifting the heavy weapon with a tremendous effort. The stain on his
coat grew larger as he adjusted a clip in the gun.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Feodor?" the girl asked, suddenly
breathless.</p>

<p>He looked at her, smiled gravely. "Both of us have no chance to
escape, Katerina, One of us has. Get in the car, and drive. It is
only thirty miles to where the plane is hidden. I will hold the
Leopard here&mdash;for a while."</p>

<p>The girl's cheeks paled. "No, no, Feodor! You will be
killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I am dying anyway. I will stay here and stop them for
a little while. It will give you a start&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Let me surrender to the Leopard. He will not harm me, and
he will spare you if I give myself up to him. It is I whom he
wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" Feodor's voice was like the crack of a whip. There was a
terrible anger in his eyes, and for a moment it seemed as if he
would strike her. Then his voice softened. "Katerina," he said
urgently, "remember that you are a Saratoff. Remember that your
father was a Duke of the Russian Empire. Rather than see you give
yourself to this Leopard&mdash;this coolie who has made himself the
master of Asia&mdash;I would shoot you with my own hand. You must
go, Katerina. In Leningrad, you will find Captain Kusmarenko. He
will take you in his steamer to America. There, you will find this
friend of mine, whose name I have given you&mdash;James
Christopher. He is known as Operator 5 of the American
Intelligence. You will tell him you are my sister. He will remember
me. Give him the paper which you carry. Make him understand what
the Leopard plans. He will know what to do."</p>

<p>Feodor turned from her toward the swiftly approaching
motorcycles.</p>

<p>"Go quickly, Katerina. In a moment it will be too late."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you," she announced stubbornly.</p>

<p>He did not look at her. "Go!" he repeated harshly, as he knelt
in the road, raising the sub-machine gun, resting it on one knee.
"In your hands rests the fate of the world. You have no
choice!"</p>

<p>For a moment she stood there, looking down at him rebelliously.
The motorcycles were less than a mile away. The road was filled
with them, and far behind them she could see horsemen. Great clouds
of dust rose in the air from the advancing host.</p>

<p>Feodor said over his shoulder: "Katerina, I am the head of the
family. You swore to our father before he died that you would obey
me in all things. You swore it by the Holy Virgin, and you kissed
the cross. Will you violate that oath now?"</p>

<p>He could not see the anguish in her eyes, but he heard the
choked sob that caught in her throat.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;will go, Feodor," she said, very low. "I obey."</p>

<p>He sighed, his eyes still on the advancing motorcycles, which
had slowed down now, at sight of them. "There are more clips of
ammunition in the car," he told her, matter-of-factly. "Leave them
beside me."</p>

<p>Moving as in a dream, she took out four clips, placed them next
to him, then bent impulsively and threw her arms around him.
"Feodor!" she cried brokenly. "I can't bear to leave you here to
die&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed grimly, lifting his eyes to her. "The Saratoffs know
how to die, Katerina."</p>

<p>She kissed him. "Good-by, Feodor. I will go to America, and find
this friend of yours, this Operator 5. And I swear to you that I
will never rest until I have seen the Leopard pay for the Saratoff
blood he is about to spill!"</p>

<p>She said it calmly enough, but there was a queer, cold deadness
in her voice. He pressed her hand, pushed her away.</p>

<p>She got into the car, the motor of which had been left running.
She pressed the pedal and the old Ford pulled away, leaving Feodor
Saratoff in the road facing the speeding motorcycles...</p>

<p>He did not look after her, did not wave. Tight-lipped, he
stretched out, belly to the ground, and sighted along the
submachine gun. He heard the Ford chugging away, and above it the
quick back-firing of the oncoming motorcycles. There were perhaps
fifty of them, and they advanced two abreast on the narrow road.
Each was equipped with an armored side-car, from which projected
the muzzle of a gun.</p>

<p>The thundering cycles swept up the rise in the road toward where
Saratoff lay, and he pressed the trip of his gun, sent a stream of
lead screaming toward them. He aimed low, at a point beneath the
metal plates which protected the drivers of the two foremost
machines.</p>

<p>His slugs clanged against steel, and the two first motorcycles
careened madly, crashed into each other with a deafening explosion,
in the center of the road. Tongues of flame lanced up from them,
and in a second the second pair of cycles had piled upon the first,
adding to the twisted, blazing wreckage.</p>

<p>The cycles behind swerved sharply to avoid the same fate,
spreading out to either side of the road, and slowing to a
halt.</p>

<p>Feodor Saratoff, grinning coldly behind the sights of his
machine gun, kept up a steady stream of lead, fanning it across
from one side of the road to the other. But now, with the
motorcycles halted, his barrage did little damage. His first burst
had caught the only exposed portion of the bodies of the
drivers&mdash;their feet. The following cyclists had drawn their
feet up behind the protection of the armor plates, and there was
now nothing to shoot at. The screaming lead from the machine gun
clanged futilely against the metal armor.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the muzzles of the guns which peeped from the
loopholes in the armor of each of those motorcycles did not spit
death back at the prone man on the hilltop. On the contrary, they
were silent.</p>

<p>Saratoff emptied his clip, frenziedly slipped another into the
hot gun. In the quarter-minute that it took him to effect the
change, the cycles chugged another fifty feet toward him, then
stopped again as he let loose another burst, which did no harm.</p>

<p>Behind the cycles, a company of cavalry was cantering up, and
the troops stopped, just out of range. Then, at an order from an
officer, they fanned out into the fields on either side of the
road, and advanced warily in a flanking movement, still staying out
of range. Not a single shot had yet been fired at the lone man.</p>

<p>Saratoff wavered to his feet, holding the still chattering
machine gun at his hip.</p>

<p>He swung it in a wide arc, so that his slugs now cut a wide
swathe into the fields on both sides. He could see where his
snub-nosed bullets plowed into the ground, far short of the troops,
and he cursed wildly, feverishly inserted another clip. The hot
breech burned his hands through the gloves. In the brief respite
while he ceased firing, the motorcycles moved forward once more,
stopped immediately when he again pressed the trip of the gun. The
cavalry remained out of range.</p>

<p>Saratoff glanced fleetingly behind him, smiled thinly as he saw
that the road toward Leningrad was empty as far as the eye could
reach. The old Ford was out of sight. He turned and bared his teeth
at the sight of the motorcycles, which had stolen another fifty
feet. He shouted wild defiance into the air.</p>

<p>"You want me alive, Mr. Leopard! Well, come and take me!"</p>

<p>And once more the staccato chattering of his machine gun cut
through the air, and the motorcycles halted.</p>

<p>He had only one clip left on the ground beside him. The
bloodstain in his right side was spreading over his coat, and
dripping to the ground to form a small crimson pool. His face was
pinched with frost, though his hands were hot from contact with the
gun.</p>

<p>He could see the horsemen, crouching low over their mounts,
waiting for him to exhaust his ammunition before charging in. These
men wore strange, angularly shaped helmets, and breastplates of
some sort of chain mesh which bent with their bodies. The horses
were unprotected, and that was why the riders kept out of
range.</p>

<p>Grimly he played the mad tune on his gun, finished the clip, and
reloaded. Once more the motorcycles rolled up toward him, stopped
when he started to fire again. This was the last clip. Behind the
motorcycles and the cavalry, marching foot soldiers appeared on the
road, helmeted and mailed. They were marching four abreast, and
their armor shone in the sun. In the forefront of the infantry, a
banner eddied in the slight breeze, billowed out, showing a white
background upon which was emblazoned the figure of a leopard,
stretched at full length, apparently leaping through the air.</p>

<p>A FIGURE became visible, cantering ahead of that banner. It was
a mounted man, riding a tall, coal-black horse. Saratoff's eyes,
glued to his sights, glinted with hatred as he glimpsed that
horseman. He was naked, save for a loin cloth. Naked, in that
frozen country where no man dared venture out unless bundled in
furs! Saratoff raised the sights of the gun, sent lead screaming
over the heads of the cavalry. His burst fell far short, but the
naked rider seemed to recognize the gesture, and raised one arm in
a mocking salute.</p>

<p>Now, Feodor's last clip was exhausted. His gun became silent,
and he threw the smoking weapon from him, reached into his coat
pocket and drew out a heavy automatic. He stood with this in his
hand&mdash;legs braced wide, tottering upon his feet, with the
blood from his side dripping slowly to the ground&mdash;and faced
the advancing array of mailed men.</p>

<p>His face was set, grim with hatred, as the motorcycles once more
resumed their advance, and the horsemen began closing in from both
sides. He fired nine times in rapid succession, swinging his gun
from side to side. Horses fell with each shot but in a moment he
was hemmed in, the last shot fired from his automatic.</p>

<p>Mailed men leaped from the horses and from behind the armored
plates of the motorcycles. Saratoff's fists flailed out in fierce
resistance, but his arms were seized, and he was held helpless. The
faces of his captors were not visible behind their glittering metal
helmets, but almond eyes peered out at him through slitted eyeholes
as his struggles stopped. He stood, breathing hard, would have
fallen were it not for the hands that held him up.</p>

<p>The press about him opened, and the naked man on the black horse
rode up close and dismounted, stood facing Saratoff.</p>

<p>The naked man towered above the frail Russian. He was a giant of
a man, with muscles that played in powerful ripples over all his
body and that ridged his back. He was a Chinese, and his skin was
dark, oily, his face was broad, flat, distinctly Mongol, with thick
lips and high cheekbones. His hair was cropped close to his head,
and his eyes were surmounted by bushy, unkempt brows. The lips were
parted now, in a cruel smile of vindictiveness. He spoke in a
queer, high-pitched dialect of the Steppes.</p>

<p>"Saratoff, I promised I would kill you with these two hands if
you tried to escape with your sister!"</p>

<p>Feodor Saratoff raised his head, not attempting any longer to
struggle in the grip of his captors. He answered simply: "I am
ready to die, Leopard!"</p>

<p>The naked man turned, spoke swift orders to a mailed officer who
stood behind him, using the sing-song Cantonese dialect.</p>

<p>The officer saluted, stepped back, and raised a hand, issued
orders to the crews of the motorcycles. At once, the men returned
to their machines, started the motors, and set off down the road in
the direction the Ford had taken.</p>

<p>The naked man turned back to Saratoff, who smiled defiantly.
"You will not catch her, Leopard. By this time, she has reached a
plane which we had hidden in Novomirsk!"</p>

<p>The features of the naked man contorted with rage. Stained teeth
showed through parted, thick, red lips. For a moment, those two
slanted eyes flared in small, ruby pinpoints. Then the huge man
seemed to master himself. He said coldly:</p>

<p>"She cannot go far enough, Saratoff. I will have her if I must
comb the world. Just as you see the armies of Russia retreat before
me, so shall the armies of other countries make way before me.
Wherever she may hide, the Leopard will find her. Your sister,
Saratoff, shall be the Leopard's queen! Where has she gone in the
plane?"</p>

<p>Feodor Saratoff's eyes blazed. His whole body shook in futile
anger. Far down on the road he could see rank upon rank of mailed
men, marching. The hosts of Asia were behind this naked man in the
loin-cloth. His body stiffened, and he threw his shoulders back,
raised his head. He spoke slowly, with an apparent effort to remain
calm.</p>

<p>"You are nothing but a filthy wharf-rat, Leopard&mdash;a filthy
coolie who has somehow made himself master of Asia. But ruler of
Asia or not, the Saratoffs are too good for you. My ancestors were
Dukes of Muscovy while yours groveled in the mud of Mongolia. How
dare you raise your eyes to a woman of the Saratoffs?&mdash;you, in
whose veins runs the hybrid blood of the carrion races of
Asia!"</p>

<p>The naked man snarled, stretched out two powerful, hairy hands
toward Feodor's throat. But he stopped, suddenly laughed.</p>

<p>"You are clever, Saratoff. You wish to goad me into killing you
before I force you to tell me where your sister has fled!" He shook
his head. "It does not matter what you say of me. It remains that I
am the master of Asia." He nodded. "Yes, a dirty coolie, raised on
the waterfront of Mukden, now rules Asia. Soon he will rule the
world. Look at these hands. They have loaded freight on a hundred
boats, have stoked coal in a hundred engine rooms. Now they hold
the fate of Asia. One day they will hold that beautiful sister of
yours. It is my misfortune, Saratoff, that I once saw your sister.
Now I must have this proud daughter of the Dukes of Muscovy; I will
make her the queen of the dirty coolie who will rule the world. And
now, Saratoff, you will tell me where she has fled."</p>

<p>Feodor laughed. "You are mistaken, Leopard. You think your
tortures will make me talk. But a Saratoff knows how to endure
pain. Once I was tortured by the Ogpu for four days, but I did not
reveal the secrets of the White Russian army. Do you think I will
betray my own sister?"</p>

<p>The Leopard nodded. "I think you will, Saratoff." He gestured at
the torn-up fields on both sides of them. "Why do you think the
Soviet armies retreated before me? They were as well armed and as
numerous as my own forces. I will show you, Saratoff, why they
retreated&mdash;and why you will tell me where your sister has
gone."</p>

<p>He motioned behind him, spoke in Cantonese. A mailed horseman
turned, and spurred down the road, alongside the ranks of troops.
In a few moments, he returned with another rider. This was an old,
wizened Chinese who carried a large, flat, black case under his
arm.</p>

<p>The old man dismounted, bowed low before the naked one.</p>

<p>"Doctor Fu," said the Leopard, motioning toward Feodor, "I want
this man to talk!"</p>

<p>Doctor Fu bowed once more, opened his case and drew a small vial
from it. He came and stood before Feodor, spoke sharply to the two
soldiers who held him: "Grip him tight. Do not let him move."</p>

<p>Then he removed the stopper from the vial, held it under
Feodor's nose. Feodor tried to rear back, sudden panic in his eyes.
But he was held firmly, helpless.</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src=

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Doctor Fu held the vial under Feodor's nose.</p>
</div>

<p>After a moment, Doctor Fu replaced the stopper in the vial, put
the glass tube back in the case, and bowed again. "He will talk
now, Lord," said the old doctor, and backed away.</p>

<p>The Leopard nodded, pleased, his gaze on Feodor. The thin
Russian's eyes were becoming glazed, dull. His jaw sagged a little.
His feet slid a bit in the frozen puddle of his own blood.</p>

<p>The Leopard asked him softly: "Where did your sister, Katerina,
fly in the plane, Saratoff?"</p>

<p>And suddenly, inexplicably, Feodor answered! He spoke in a dull
voice, the words coming from his lips effortlessly, as if it were
imperative that he tell: "She flies to Leningrad. There she will
embark with a Captain Kusmarenko, who served our father, but who is
now in the employ of the Soviet Steamship Lines. He will take her
to America."</p>

<p>"And where will she be in America, Saratoff?"</p>

<p>"She seeks an old friend of mine, whom I knew in Constantinople.
He is of the American Secret Service. He is known as Operator 5.
His name is James Christopher."</p>

<p>The Leopard's ugly face darkened. He took a step closer. "She
has a message perhaps, for this James Christopher?"</p>

<p>"She has. I gave her a letter, stating everything that I
discovered about you and your plans. It tells that you have some
strange means of winning victory after victory in the field. It
tells how you mastered Asia, and how you waited, watching Europe
destroy itself in this new world war which is even more destructive
than the first. It tells how you march across Russia to the
sea."</p>

<p>"And do you also write to this Operator 5 of what I plan
next?"</p>

<p>FEODOR nodded dully. "I told him in the letter, how you plan to
seize ships and sail for America with this strange power of yours
that brings you victory always. And I warned him that he must use
all his ingenuity if he would prevent his country from becoming
vassal to the Leopard of Asia."</p>

<p>The Leopard bent forward eagerly, asked tensely: "This power of
mine, Saratoff&mdash;did you tell him what it was?"</p>

<p>"No. How could I? I do not know its nature myself."</p>

<p>The Leopard nodded in satisfaction. "That is so. I just wanted
to make sure."</p>

<p>He turned to an officer behind him. "You heard, Dato?"</p>

<p>The mailed and helmeted officer bowed. "I heard, Lord."</p>

<p>"Then ride back at once. Send wires to our men in America. Have
them watch the docks in every port. Find out what ship this
Kusmarenko commands. We cannot reach Leningrad before her, but we
can stop her at the docks in America. Also let our own men in
America turn their attention to this Operator 5. You
understand?"</p>

<p>The officer bowed. "I understand, Lord; and I obey." He clicked
his heels, turned, and went to one of the motorcycles. In a moment,
the cycle was turned around, and went speeding back up the road,
along the ranks of halted soldiers.</p>

<p>The Leopard faced Feodor once more. There was a set smile of
savagery on his broad, flat face. "And now, Saratoff," he laughed,
"I keep my promise!" His two huge hands came up slowly to Feodor's
throat, linked themselves around it, and pressed...</p>

<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I. &mdash; THE LEOPARD MAKES A
MOVE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the seventh month after the entry of the
United States into the Second World War, as it was already
officially termed. Two million eight hundred thousand stalwart
young Americans had been equipped with arms, hastily trained, and
shipped across the Atlantic to bolster up the cracking battle-line
of the League of Nations Sanctioning Powers. Materials of war had
poured across the ocean in equally amazing quantities.</p>

<p>In seven months, the United States had stripped herself of men
and materials in order&mdash;as the propagandists put it this
time&mdash;'to make the world safe for Liberty'.</p>

<p>So cleverly had foreign diplomacy maneuvered&mdash;so
brilliantly had foreign financed propaganda played its
cards&mdash;that the objections of those veterans who still
recalled the tortured days and nights of the trenches of 1917 had
been smothered under a wave of high-pitched national feeling.</p>

<p>America was plunged into the war...</p>

<p>A regiment of fresh conscripts was marching down Broadway to the
accompaniment of blaring bands and the raucous cheers of the
thousands who lined the curbs. From every window of the tall
buildings on either side of New York's great thoroughfare, bits of
paper and confetti fluttered down upon the marching men.</p>

<p>At the docks, four huge transports were waiting to take them
aboard, together with other regiments which were hastily leaving to
plug up the gaps in the Twelfth Division on the Southern Front.</p>

<p>In the Hudson River, eight huge ships of war rode at anchor.
These were to be the convoys for the transports. There were six
long, sleek cruisers, and the capital ships, Dakota and Oregon. The
Dakota was the flagship of the Atlantic fleet, and Admiral Stanley
Winston, who was going across to take command of the Mediterranean
blockade for the Sanctioning Powers, would soon board her.</p>

<p>At Broadway and Forty-second Street, a black limousine purred at
the corner, waiting for a break in the ranks of the marching
draftees so that it could proceed west.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel was pockmarked, with gnarled, bony hands
and a face upon which there was a set expression of stolidity. He
wore a chauffeur's cap and uniform, but his bearing was far from
being that of a servant.</p>

<p>In the rear of the car sat a man and a woman. The man was
grossly fat, and small eyes peered furtively out from between folds
of flesh. There was a queer, unhealthy color in his cheeks. His
companion was taller than he. Her dark hair was braided around her
head, and set off as in a frame by the high collar of her ermine
coat. Her red lips formed a bright line of color in her otherwise
white face. The coat was open at the throat, revealing a string of
shimmering pearls which lay across her breast.</p>

<p>The woman, as well as the two men, was quite distinctly of
Eastern origin. A keen observer might have placed them as belonging
to one of those Eurasian races of mixed European and Asiatic
descent&mdash;which are notoriously known to have bred the most
unprincipled spies and intriguers in history.</p>

<p>At the feet of the fat man and the woman, a bundle lay stretched
across the floor of the car, covered by an auto robe. This bundle
was wriggling frantically, and for a moment the robe was thrown
back, revealing a young, freckled-faced boy, whose arms were tied
behind his back, and who was cruelly gagged with a greasy
automobile rag thrust into his mouth and tied behind his head with
a luggage strap.</p>

<p>The boy's eyes expressed desperate anger as he labored to a
half-sitting position, and tried to wriggle himself still
higher.</p>

<p>The woman, who had been staring straight ahead at the marching
men, over the shoulder of the chauffeur, glanced down and saw the
struggles of the boy. She nudged her companion, said:</p>

<p>"That brat is up again, Dmitri. Some one will notice him while
we are stopped here."</p>

<p>She spoke in English, with a trace of soft, slurring accent. Her
beautiful features showed no tinge of emotion at the lad's pitiful
struggles.</p>

<p>The fat man stirred, and frowned. He said nothing, but raised a
foot, planted the sole squarely in the boy's face, and pushed. The
bound lad's head cracked against the floor with a thud, and he lay
still.</p>

<p>AT that moment the marching men halted, and a traffic officer
motioned to the limousine to proceed. The chauffeur shifted into
first, and shot the car across, then sped west toward the
Hudson.</p>

<p>The woman said chillingly to the fat man beside her: "It will be
too bad if you have cracked the boy's skull. We will need to have
him conscious for a while, Dmitri."</p>

<p>Dmitri grunted, bent over and pinched the lad's pallid face. The
boy uttered a muffled groan through the gag, and his eyes opened
wide. The fat fingers had left a livid mark on his cheek.</p>

<p>Dmitri laughed. "You needn't worry," he said to the woman. "This
boy is hard to kill&mdash;like his friend."</p>

<p>The boy glared up at his tormentor.</p>

<p>The woman looked down at him coldly, and remarked to her
companion: "He has a lot of spirit; he will be hard to break."</p>

<p>"We'll break him, all right," the man chuckled. "We've broken
harder ones."</p>

<p>Playfully he raised his foot again, poked his toe at a spot in
the boy's elbow. The young captive squirmed in agony, and the fat
man's chuckle rose higher.</p>

<p>"You see, Lina, my dear, there is a good deal of science to this
business. One must use finesse. My toe poked him in what these
Americans call the funny bone. Just a little tap, and you see the
agony it causes. There are many little spots like that in the human
body. I assure you this boy will not be able to resist
my&mdash;er&mdash;persuasion for long."</p>

<p>The woman's gray-green, expressionless eyes regarded the fat man
for a moment, and she shuddered. "I should hate, Dmitri, to be the
subject of your attentions," she said. "It is not wise to have you
for an enemy."</p>

<p>Dmitri bowed. "Thank you, Lina," he murmured. "Let us hope that
the Leopard will appreciate my services when the time comes for
dispensing rewards."</p>

<p>At Eleventh Avenue, the limousine swung onto the ramp leading to
the elevated express highway, sped north to Riverside Drive, then
up the Drive to One Hundred and Third Street. It pulled up before a
brownstone house around the corner from the Roerich Museum. In the
first floor window of this house was a modest sign which read:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">Dmitri Osman<br>
Studio of the Dance</p>
<br>

<p>Cold wind roared in from the Hudson, causing pedestrians to walk
with their heads down, more occupied in holding onto their hats
than in watching the queer bundle which Dmitri and the chauffeur
carried into the house.</p>

<p>The door was opened without their ringing by a skinny Oriental
in a white house jacket, who grinned knowingly at sight of the
squirming bundle, and lent a hand to the two men in carrying it
into a room at the rear of the long, dark hall. The woman followed
them in.</p>

<p>The room which they entered was darkened; there were two
windows, but heavy steel shutters allowed no light to filter in.
The walls were bare, and the only furniture was a cot with a single
chair beside it, and a desk in one corner.</p>

<p>Dmitri and the chauffeur dumped the boy on the cot while the
woman lit a cigarette and watched dispassionately.</p>

<p>Then the chauffeur, at a nod from the fat man, untied the lad's
hands, and removed the gag. He stepped back, drawing from a
shoulder holster an automatic which he trained on the youthful
prisoner.</p>

<p>The boy sat up on the cot with an effort, moved his arms,
painfully, in order to restore circulation. He gazed from one to
the other of his captors, and his young, freckled face wrinkled in
perplexity. Finally he let his glance settle on the fat man and
said:</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll tell me what's the big idea of the kidnapping,
mister?"</p>

<p>Dmitri stepped close to him, brought his fat, pudgy hand down in
a vicious, openhanded slap that stung the boy's cheek to a vivid
purple hue. "You will answer questions," he purred, "and not ask
them."</p>

<p>The boy was flung back on the cot by the force of the blow. He
did not cower, but lay there, glaring up at the other.</p>

<p>Dmitri bent over him. "Your name," he grated, "is Tim Donovan.
You are the boy who assists the man known as Operator 5. You are
his constant companion. I want to know if he has recently received
a visit from a young lady named Katerina Saratoff?" He bent lower,
his eyes fastened on the boy's. "Well?"</p>
<br>

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Tim Donovan</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The lad's cheek still stung from the vicious blow. He pressed
his lips tight to keep back the tears that came involuntarily to
his eyes, and suddenly raised his knees, kicked upward with both
feet. The heels of his shoes caught the fat man in the stomach, and
Dmitri was thrown backward, doubled up in agony, both hands pressed
to his paunch.</p>

<p>The boy grinned, shouted: "That's for the smack you took at my
funny bone, Fatty! Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no further, for the stocky, pockmarked chauffeur had
rushed in with his automatic clubbed. He brought the butt down on
the boy's head, and the youngster buckled over on the cot,
unconscious. Blood oozed from his scalp at the spot where the
gun-butt had struck. He twitched a moment, then lay still.</p>

<p>The fat man was groaning with pain. He backed into the chair,
leaned far forward, still clutching at his stomach, swaying from
side to side, and moaning loudly.</p>

<p>The woman paid no attention to the fat man, but hurried to the
cot, put a hand on the boy's heart. After a second she nodded, then
turned to the chauffeur, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"You are an utter fool, Selig!" she snapped. "Don't you see that
this boy deliberately kicked Dmitri in order to goad you into doing
something like this? Now we cannot question him further!"</p>

<p>Selig hung his head. "I am sorry, Lina."</p>

<p>She didn't answer him, but turned to the fat man, helped him to
get up.</p>

<p>"Come, Dmitri," she said. "I'll help you into the office. Leave
this brat here till he recovers. There is much to be done."</p>

<p>She aided him to arise and walked him, still groaning, to the
door.</p>

<p>The chauffeur remained in the room with the unconscious boy.</p>

<p>"When he awakes," the woman said to the chauffeur from the
threshold, "call us."</p>

<p>The fat man groaned, said through pain-twisted lips: "Yes.
Call&mdash;me. I will have something to&mdash;say to him!"</p>

<p>The chauffeur nodded, and watched them leave. Then he seated
himself in the chair which Osman had vacated and settled himself to
wait for Tim Donovan to come to.</p>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">II. &mdash; PRIDE BEFORE A FALL</a>
</h2>

</div>
<br>

<p class="first">WHILE Tim Donovan was being carried across town by
the obese Dmitri Osman and the woman, Lina, James
Christopher&mdash;Operator 5, ace of the United States
Intelligence&mdash;was facing three men in a room on the third
floor of the Custom House Building, on Bowling Green, in downtown
New York.</p>

<p>The three men were seated. Operator 5 was standing, talking to
them vehemently, urgently. As he spoke, he gestured toward a girl
who stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he was pleading, "you must believe what this young
lady tells us. She is Katerina Saratoff, the sister of a very dear
friend of mine, who died so that she might come here to give me the
message. For two weeks I have tried to get you to listen to her.
Today I practically forced my way in here. I beg of you, gentlemen,
give this young lady five minutes of your time!"</p>

<p>One of the three men rose, glanced at the others, and cleared
his throat. He was a tall man in his late fifties, and his bearing
was distinguished, sedate. He was the Secretary of War&mdash;the
man who had the last word on the disposition of the fighting forces
of the United States. He adjusted his glasses on his thin, aquiline
nose, and spoke sharply:</p>

<p>"Operator 5, you must realize that you are interfering with the
embarkation of four thousand soldiers. The war in
Europe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The war in Europe be damned!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher broke in hotly. "Don't you realize, Mr.
Secretary, that our own shores are in danger? What will you do when
the enemy ships are sighted off our coastline?" He turned
pleadingly to the two seated men. "You, General Falk, and you,
Admiral Winston. Perhaps you will listen to me. This young lady has
definite information that the Union of Asiatic States plans to
attack the United States. You yourselves know that no news has come
out of Asia for months. You know, also, that Soviet Russia has been
fighting desperately, fruitlessly, for her life on her eastern
frontiers. You have heard rumors that a new dictator has sprung up
in Asia, who has consolidated all the yellow races under a single
banner. Yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man whom Jimmy Christopher had addressed as Admiral Winston
raised a hand. He was a comparatively young man, in his early
forties. He was attired in the full-dress uniform of a rear-admiral
of the United States Navy. It was he who was to take command of the
convoy sailing that evening&mdash;and who was scheduled to assume
full charge of the Sanctioning Powers' Joint Fleet in Mediterranean
waters.</p>

<p>He was smiling indulgently as he said:</p>

<p>"All these things may be quite true, Operator 5. But I should
like to point out to you that even if there is a new dictator in
Asia&mdash;even if the Asiatic States have conquered
Russia&mdash;they can constitute no very serious menace to us. Our
fleet has been brought up to full war-time capacity. We can
literally blast any attacking force out of the ocean. Just what do
you want us to do about this Asiatic attack that you fear so
much?"</p>

<p>"This is no laughing matter, sir!" Jimmy said urgently. "Miss
Saratoff here, tells me that she and her brother covered eight
hundred miles across Russia, in the wake of the retreating Soviet
armies. She tells me that not a single pitched battle was fought,
but that the Russian forces fell back constantly, leaving a clear
path across Europe from Lake Baikal."</p>

<p>He turned to Katerina Saratoff, who had been watching him
breathlessly, and said, switching easily into Russian: "Let me have
the message which Feodor wrote quickly. Perhaps I can convince them
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took the envelope which she extracted from her purse, and
turned back to the three men, opening it and extracting the folded
sheet of notepaper, covered with Russian hieroglyphics, written in
pencil in a small, scholarly hand.</p>

<p>"This, gentlemen, is the letter which Feodor Saratoff wrote when
he realized that he would never leave Russia alive. I won't take
your time to translate and read it. But Saratoff hints here that
the Dictator of the Union of Asiatic States has developed a new
kind of warfare. He has advanced across Russia without fighting a
single major engagement."</p>

<p>The tall man who had spoken first cleared his throat and stopped
Jimmy Christopher. "No doubt these Asiatics bribed the craven
Soviet commanders&mdash;"</p>

<p>JIMMY shook his head. "There is more than bribery behind this,
Mr. Secretary. There is some peculiar force which this
coolie&mdash;who calls himself The Leopard&mdash;has developed,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>General Falk, the Chief of Staff of the United States, who had
been sitting silent all this time, suddenly snapped his fingers in
impatience, and exclaimed: "Bosh! Let this Leopard cross the
Atlantic. We will show him&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as a knock sounded on the door. "Come in!" he
barked.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a young naval lieutenant entered, saluted
briskly, and handed a dispatch to Admiral Winston.</p>

<p>"Captain Loring's compliments, sir," he said, with a manner of
barely restrained excitement. "The radio room on the Dakota just
picked up this message in code, from the Destroyer, Macklin. We
tried to communicate with the Macklin at once after receiving it,
sir, but were unable to raise them again."</p>

<p>Admiral Winston frowned, took the dispatch and glanced at the
others. Then he unfolded it and his ruddy face grew pale as his
eyes traveled over the typed words.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up, and his gaze met Jimmy Christopher's.</p>

<p>"Operator 5," he said in a strangely altered voice, "it appears
that part of what you have been telling us has come true!"</p>

<p>There were gasps of astonishment from the Secretary of War and
from General Falk. Winston motioned them to silence, and read aloud
from the dispatch:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">HAVE SIGHTED FLEET OF FORTY SHIPS THIRTY-EIGHT
DEGREES NORTH LAT SEVENTY DEGREES EAST LONG. CANNOT ASCERTAIN
NATION FOR THEY ARE FLYING BLACK FLAG WITH FIGURE OF RED LEOPARD.
HAVE COUNTED THIRTY CONVOYS AND TEN SHIPS OF WAR. STANDING BY FOR
ORDERS.<br>
JOHN DENNY COMMANDER DESTROYER MACKLIN</p>
<br>

<p>For a moment there was startled silence in the room. From
outside came the blare of trumpets and the roll of drums as
marching men debauched from Broadway onto the docks and prepared to
embark.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War snatched the sheet from Winston's hand,
reread it himself, handed it to Falk.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher whispered in Katerina Saratoff's ear a
translation of the message, and her dark eyes suddenly snapped
fire.</p>

<p>She said in Russian to Jimmy:</p>

<p>"It is the Leopard! I shall pray now, every moment, that the
Holy Virgin give you strength and wit and courage to avenge the
death of my brother!"</p>

<p>Jimmy said to her somberly: "If my guess is right, Katerina, it
will take more than prayer to lick this Leopard. From Feodor's
letter, I should judge that we are going to be invaded within
twenty-four hours!"</p>

<p>He turned from the girl to hear Admiral Winston say to the
Secretary of War:</p>

<p>"This Leopard is in for a huge surprise. I ask you, sir, to give
me full command of the Atlantic Fleet. The troopships will have to
wait for their convoys. There are more than a hundred warships
along the Atlantic seaboard, and I can have most of them here
within a few hours. I will go meet this Leopard, and blow him to
Kingdom Come!"</p>

<p>"You have full authority, Winston," the Secretary said without
hesitation. "The fleet is yours!"</p>

<p>Winston beamed with satisfaction, snatched up the telephone on
the desk, and began to snap instructions. Jimmy Christopher
approached the Secretary, said low-voiced:</p>

<p>"There is another matter, sir, that I must call to your
attention." There was no trace of elation, of the I-told-you-so
attitude in Jimmy's manner. These men had laughed at him only a
moment ago, and his prediction and warning had come true,
dramatically. Yet he refrained from calling it to the Secretary's
attention.</p>

<p>"In Feodor Saratoff's note, here, he warns me that the Leopard
has placed agents of his in key positions with our armed forces, as
well as with the large industrial plants throughout the country.
Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Secretary put a kindly hand on his shoulder. "Do not concern
yourself about that, Operator 5. Within a few hours, this Leopard
will have become a thing of the past. With ten warships, he cannot
hope to oppose our splendid fleet. Either he will turn tail and
head back to Asia, or he will be annihilated."</p>

<p>"That may be so, sir," Jimmy Christopher insisted stubbornly.
"But it might be well to make some preparations to receive him in
the event that he manages to break through our fleet. The four
thousand men who are embarking now are about the only effective
armed forces in the East. The training camps have only raw
youths&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Secretary laughed. "You are far too pessimistic, Operator 5.
The Leopard will never break through."</p>

<p>Jimmy was about to protest further, but at that moment Winston
put down the telephone, turned from the desk, his face beaming with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Everything is arranged!" he exclaimed. "Within three hours
every available squadron will be ready for action. We will teach
the Leopard a lesson that he won't soon forget. I am ordering the
embarkation to continue. As soon as we have disposed of those tubs
from Asia, I will sail for Europe as originally planned!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher frowned. "Why not keep those men here,
Admiral? You can return after the engagement, and go on with the
embarkation. It's little enough protection for New York if anything
should happen to the fleet. And you must remember that the Leopard
controls some peculiar instrument of warfare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" The admiral snapped his fingers. "Those Soviet soldiers
were nothing but rank cowards; and their officers were probably
bribed. I'll concede that your information about the Leopard's
arrival was correct&mdash;but even then, it's nothing to get
worried about. It's ridiculous to think that ten battleships and
thirty tubs full of yellow soldiers could constitute a serious
threat to America!"</p>

<p>The Secretary of War was nodding in agreement with the naval
officer. "Your zeal is commendable, Operator 5. But I think that
you may well leave the handling of this business to Admiral Winston
from now on."</p>

<p>Hopelessly, Jimmy Christopher turned away from them, took
Katerina Saratoff by the arm. There was no use arguing with these
men. As he led the girl out of the room, none of them paid him any
attention.</p>

<p>Outside, Katerina said to him: "I am afraid, Operator
5&mdash;afraid for your country. Those men are fools. They do not
understand that the Leopard would not come against them were he not
sure of victory. The Leopard knows how strong your fleet is; and he
is not a fool. He has some plan to destroy it&mdash;I am sure!"</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. "What can I do, Katerina? Those men hold the
country's fate in their hands. They are the highest officers in the
land; I am only a number in the Intelligence Service!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III. &mdash; THE MAN-BREAKER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LESS than two hundred miles from the coast of New
England, the great Atlantic Fleet of the United States was steaming
eastward.</p>

<p>The long, lean, metal monsters cut through the clear blue water,
holding formations, squadron by squadron. Above them, and far
ahead, roared the naval aircraft, while from the stern of the
Dakota, the huge new flagship of the fleet, there fluttered the
two-starred pennant of Rear Admiral Stanley Winston.</p>

<p>A hundred and nine ships comprised that mighty fleet. There were
five capital ships of the line, besides the Dakota; there were
sixty-four destroyers, eleven heavy cruisers, the aircraft
carriers, Langley and Mattson, four submarine tenders, and
twenty-two submarines. Nine squadron pennants billowed in the
wind.</p>

<p>Behind the fleet lagged supply and hospital ships.</p>

<p>Inter-squadron and inter-division messages crackled over
wireless sets, and intra-division signal flags slid up and down on
signal-hoists.</p>

<p>On every ship the men were all at battle stations, and decks
were cleared for action. Grim, tight-lipped officers waited word
for the reconnoitering planes that the enemy had been sighted.</p>

<p>In a cabin on the flagship, Dakota, Admiral Stanley Winston sat
before a desk piled with memoranda, lists and charts. Though he
hadn't slept the night before, his uniform was spotless, and the
two silver stars and foul anchor of his shoulder insignia gleamed
with bright newness.</p>

<p>His voice crackled as he issued swift orders which sent junior
officers scurrying to the wireless room with messages for the
fleet. At his elbow stood Lieutenant Earl Ward, the Admiral's
personal secretary. On the desk was an ash-tray littered with dead
butts of cigarettes. As soon as Winston finished one, Lieutenant
Ward would hand him another, light it for him. It was a standing
matter of knowledge in the navy that Winston, brilliant sea
strategist that he was, would be lost without Ward to attend to the
little details of his personal comfort, which Winston himself
utterly forgot when in action.</p>

<p>"Now," Lieutenant Ward bent over his superior, whispered: "How
about a little rest, sir? It may be a matter of hours before we
contact the enemy. You've got everything in hand. You haven't
slept&mdash;"</p>

<p>Winston waved him aside impatiently. "I'll sleep after the
engagement&mdash;if there is any, Ward. There are still things to
be done." His voice assumed an edge of irritation. "I have to
receive this young fool that Intelligence is sending out. I don't
know why in God's name they should send me an Intelligence man at
this time. He'll probably get under our feet and clog up the works.
Those fellows think they've got a monopoly of brains!"</p>

<p>He picked up the phone at his elbow, barked: "Give me the
bridge!" Then when he got his connection: "My compliments to
Captain Loring, and instruct him to watch for an autogyro that
should be approaching us about this time. He is to signal it to
alight on the Langley. Its occupant is to be brought to me at
once!"</p>

<p>He hung up, sat back in the swivel chair, and looked up at his
orderly with an air of utter weariness. They were alone in the
cabin for the first time that morning. Suddenly his stern face
broke into a warm smile. He reached up and patted Ward on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Relax, Lieutenant," he said. "You seem to be all on edge. Why
the worry? This Leopard from Asia may be a big shot on land, but
I'll warrant you he's never met a fleet like this. We'll blow him
out of the water. There won't be a trace of his forty ships an hour
after we sight them!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ward fidgeted nervously, his glance straying through
the porthole, through which he could catch a glimpse of a long line
of destroyers that steamed to leeward of them.</p>

<p>"It isn't that, sir," he said uneasily.</p>

<p>"It's you I'm worried about. You haven't taken a minute's rest
in the last forty-eight hours. Perhaps a little coffee?"</p>

<p>"Good idea!" Winston grunted. He glanced at a small electric
stove in the corner. "I see you've got some brewing. Let's have a
cup."</p>

<p>WARD nodded, and went to the stove. An ensign entered, and
saluted. "Captain Loring's respects, sir. The plane you are
expecting has been sighted, flying very high. It should land within
a few minutes."</p>

<p>"All right," the admiral growled. "Have him brought right
over."</p>

<p>The ensign left, and Ward brought over a cup of black coffee,
which he placed on the desk.</p>

<p>"Have some yourself, Ward," the admiral said in kindly fashion.
"You can use it."</p>

<p>"No thanks, sir. I've had too much of it already."</p>

<p>Winston sipped the hot black liquid. "What do you think of that,
Ward?" he grumbled. "Intelligence is going to teach us how to fight
a sea battle. It's that Operator 5, I suppose. He tried to sell
Falk and myself some damned silly bill of goods this morning, and
now he must have got to the Secretary's ear again, and convinced
him. His story is that the Leopard will lick us by making a couple
of passes in the air, and saying some magic hocus-pocus!
Intelligence! Bah!"</p>

<p>He set the cup down with a bang, and arose to pace impatiently
up and down the cabin.</p>

<p>Ward stood aside respectfully as the admiral pushed past him,
and stared out of the porthole. The speeding vessel rocked hardly
at all as it ate up the knots. Streaming far out behind it, in a
huge V on either side, churned squadron after squadron of the most
powerful sea-fighting machine in the world.</p>

<p>Almost subconsciously, Winston's shoulders straightened, and the
weariness which he had felt fell from him as a discarded mantle.
Pride shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Ward," he said over his shoulder, "it's a queer
feeling&mdash;having all these ships under my orders. Imagine! I
have supreme command over a hundred and nine fighting vessels. This
whole fleet moves only at my word, stops only at my word! When I
was a cub at Annapolis, I never dreamed that such power would one
day lie in my hands!"</p>

<p>"It's a great responsibility, sir," Ward said quietly behind
him. "I'd be afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as a knock sounded on the door. An ensign entered,
saluted. "Captain Loring's respects, sir. Our planes have sighted
the enemy fleet, sir!"</p>

<p>Winston's eyes gleamed. He finished the rest of the coffee at a
gulp, and arose. "My compliments to Captain Loring. Tell him that I
will be on the bridge in ten minutes. In the meantime, have the gun
crews of every ship get the range from the planes&mdash;."</p>

<p>The ensign interrupted. "Captain Loring instructed me to tell
you, sir, that our planes are acting strangely. They have ceased to
communicate with us by radio, and they are veering about
erratically. Captain Loring respectfully requests that you come up
at once, sir. He is afraid there is something radically wrong!"</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the cabin, while Winston's
suddenly haggard eyes met the glance of Lieutenant Ward. There was
suddenly a queer sort of lassitude in the Admiral's eyes, that had
not been there a few moments before, even in spite of his utter
physical exhaustion. Almost blindly he stumbled out of the door of
the cabin. "Strange, very strange," he was muttering as he walked
unsteadily along the companionway, with the lieutenant and the
ensign trailing him. "Very strange..."</p>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV. &mdash; THE FINGER OF DOOM</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Operator 5 left the Custom House Building
with Katerina Saratoff, he did not take her out through the front
way. At a little-used side entrance a high-powered convertible
coupe was parked. The top was up. The glass sides had also been
raised, making it in effect, a coupe. No one could have suspected
that the canvas top really covered sheet steel, or, that the
innocent appearing sides and hood of the car were of bullet-proof
construction, with bullet-proof glass in the windows. The car was a
veritable moving fortress.</p>

<p>At the wheel sat a young, chestnut-haired girl whose
softly-modeled face and shining eyes formed a distinct contrast to
the reserved, patrician features of Katerina Saratoff. This girl
was Diane Elliot, star reporter for the Amalgamated Press. She was
one of the few people with whom Operator 5 was closely associated;
and she was, by the same token, one of the very few who knew that
the person listed on the rolls of the Secret Service only by the
designation of Operator 5 was really a human being, with emotions
and feelings like other people.</p>

<p>She opened the door of the car hastily now, as Operator 5 and
Katerina Saratoff appeared, and moved over to make room for them in
the wide seat.</p>

<p>The Secret Service ace took the wheel, guided the car expertly
away from the curb, and headed uptown, glancing backward several
times to make sure they were not followed.</p>

<p>It was only after they were well away from the Custom House that
Diane Elliot spoke. Her bright blue eyes were clouded with
worry.</p>

<p>"Jimmy! Didn't you say that Tim Donovan was to meet us
here?"</p>

<p>He nodded, gazing ahead as he threaded his way skillfully
through the cluttered traffic of Fulton Street. He was avoiding
Broadway because of the marching troops, and the narrow street was
crowded with vehicles which had been shunted here by the
police.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I told Tim to come down here. I wanted him to
keep a lookout in case we were observed. The Leopard has a lot of
agents in New York, and they're darned anxious to get their hands
on Katerina." He glanced sideways at the Russian girl, who was
sitting between Diane and himself, saw her shudder at the mention
of the Leopard. He smiled grimly. "It seems that the big coolie
from Asia has taken a fancy to Katerina. I'm sure she appreciates
the compliment!"</p>

<p>Diane exclaimed hurriedly: "But about Tim, Jimmy! I looked for
him. He wasn't anywhere around."</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher shrugged. "Maybe he was tied up at the house,
with dad. We'll probably find him home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Jimmy!" Diane's voice throbbed with anxiety. "I phoned
home a little while ago, and there was no answer. I'm
afraid&mdash;something's&mdash;happened! Your dad should have
answered the phone. He said he'd wait for us to come
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>Operator 5's face was suddenly bleak. His father, John
Christopher, who had been Q-6 in the Intelligence Service until
forced into semi-retirement by a wound received in the discharge of
his duty, presided over the brownstone house in the middle forties
where Jimmy Christopher made his home while in New York. Between
the father and son there existed a remarkable mutual understanding
and love.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher frowned at the news Diane had just given him.
"It's not like Dad to leave the phone unattended at a time like
this. I wonder&mdash; ?"</p>

<p>HIS lips clamped tight in a thin, grim line. His foot pushed
down on the accelerator and he made the long roadster squirm
through traffic with an exhibition of almost unbelievable driving
skill, until he had fought free of the snarl of cars around
Brooklyn Bridge. Then he raced north up Lafayette Street.</p>

<p>Katerina Saratoff put a sympathetic hand on his arm. "You fear
that something has happened to your father, Operator 5?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he muttered. "Tim should have been down here. If
he isn't, and if Dad doesn't answer the phone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Diane, in an effort to take his mind from thoughts of Q-6's
possible danger, asked:</p>

<p>"How did you make out with the Secretary of War and with Admiral
Winston, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"We didn't make out at all, Di! While I was warning them about
the Leopard, they got word that his fleet had been sighted out at
sea. That should have proved to them that I know what I was talking
about&mdash;that there was some truth to Feodor's claim that the
Leopard has some strange power. But no&mdash;they're sending out
the whole Atlantic Fleet under Winston to meet them. I tried to get
them to hold these troops in New York, in case the fleet should be
beaten, but they couldn't see it. In a couple of hours, Admiral
Winston will take out the whole sea power of the United
States&mdash;and they may be destroyed, just the way the Leopard
destroyed the Soviet resistance!"</p>

<p>"And there's nothing you can do about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! They won't listen to us. Will they, Katerina?"</p>

<p>The Russian girl's face was white. "God forgive them," she said,
very slow, "for they know not what they do! They are delivering
their country to the claws of the Leopard!"</p>

<p>They drove in silence until they reached the brownstone house
which was recorded in the files of Intelligence as "Address Y," and
which was the home of John Christopher.</p>

<p>Operator 5 did not stop at the door. He drove slowly past,
glancing keenly at the building, and up and down the street. At the
far corner, satisfied that no one was watching the place, he made a
U turn, and pulled up before the door. Quickly, he and the two
girls got out of the car and entered the house.</p>

<p>Just inside the hallway he stopped short, his blood suddenly
cold as he gazed down at the pitiful body on the floor. Diane and
Katerina pressed close behind him, and Diane uttered a choked
cry.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher knelt swiftly beside the body, gasped in a
broken voice: "Dad!"</p>

<p>The man who lay face up on the floor was like an old edition of
Operator 5. The cleanly-etched features, the wide forehead, the
straight nose. The hair, though, was not dark, but gray. And the
eyes were closed, while the head rested in a great pool of blood
from a wound behind the left ear.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher bent low, raised his father's head gently. His
lips were a tight, straight line as he placed his cheek against the
unconscious man's lips, waited for a warm breath that would tell
him there was still life in that body. The agony in his eyes was
hidden from the two girls behind him.</p>

<p>Diane came around opposite him in the hallway, and knelt on the
other side of the unconscious Q-6. She said huskily: "No wonder he
didn't answer the phone! Jimmy! Is he&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>Operator 5 raised his head, his eyes gleaming with hope. "No,
Di! Quick! On the phone, and get Doctor Harlan!"</p>

<p>She nodded, got to her feet, and hurried down the hall into a
room at the right.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher raised the body of his father tenderly in his
arms, carried him up the stairs into a bedroom. Katerina Saratoff
followed, hurriedly prepared the bed, then bustled about the room
in search of water, towels, antiseptic.</p>

<p>When Jimmy would have helped her she pushed him aside. "I know
what to do," she whispered. "I nursed many men in Russia!"</p>

<p>Jimmy knelt beside the bed, his eyes fastened to the pallid face
of his father. The pillow was rapidly becoming stained with
blood.</p>

<p>Katerina came back with the things she had found, gently pushed
Jimmy out of the way, and her cool white hands flew with the
efficient speed of a ministering angel. Diane came into the room,
and at a questioning glance from Jimmy, she nodded, then hurried
over to help Katerina. The wound in the back of John Christopher's
head was an ugly one, evidently made with some blunt weapon. Matted
hair and broken skin clotted it, and Katerina swabbed it out.</p>

<p>Q-6 stirred, groaned at the pain, and his eyelids fluttered
open. Diane exclaimed: "Dad! Thank God! Lie still, Dad. Don't
move!"</p>

<p>But John Christopher stubbornly kept his eyes open, muttered
weakly: "Jimmy! They got&mdash;Tim! Must&mdash;" He groaned again,
closed his eyes, then started to mumble once more.</p>

<p>Jimmy bent over him, said anxiously: "Keep quiet, Dad.
You&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as his father's voice came to him once more, faintly.
"They broke in...fat man and&mdash;pock-marked man. Got&mdash;Tim.
I&mdash; fought&mdash;with them&mdash;Got fat
man's&mdash;fingerprints!"</p>

<p>"Where, Dad?" Jimmy asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Here...on wristwatch strap...go get'em, Jimmy!" And John
Christopher's gray head fell back on Katerina's tenderly supporting
arm.</p>

<p>For a moment, Jimmy held his breath, thinking his father was
dead. But a sigh of relief escaped him as he noted the slow rise
and fall of John Christopher's chest. He leaned over, and lifted
his father's wrist, carefully unbuckled the silver chain of the
wrist watch.</p>

<p>His eager eyes examined its surface, detected the unmistakable
smudges of two prints&mdash;a thumb and another finger.</p>

<p>"Good old Dad!" he exclaimed. "He must have struggled with one
of them, just to get those prints!"</p>

<p>Diane looked up from the bedside. "Jimmy! What are you going to
do? Tim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to find him!" Operator 5 said harshly. "And find the
ones who did that to Dad! Stay here, Di, with Katerina. I'll call
back to find out how he is!"</p>

<p>And without looking back, he hurried out of the room, and
downstairs to the car. Outside, he met Doctor Harlan, who was the
unofficial surgeon to the men of the Intelligence Service. He
gripped Harlan's arm.</p>

<p>"Doc! It's dad! They got him in the head." His lips twitched.
"I've got to go, Doc. You'll do your best&mdash;more than your
best?"</p>

<p>Doctor Harlan nodded warmly. "You know I will, Jimmy. Go ahead
with your work&mdash;and leave your father to me."</p>

<p>Jimmy tore himself away, got into the car and drove downtown, to
police headquarters. Paralleling his course, only a block away,
festive men and women were shouting in acclaim, showering marching
troops with confetti, cheering them on toward their embarkation.
Out on the Hudson, giant ships were steaming down toward the Bay to
meet other ships, summoned from along the Atlantic seaboard, to go
out and meet an approaching enemy. None knew of the tragedy in the
brownstone house. There was none to share Jimmy Christopher's
anxiety with him&mdash;anxiety about his father, about Tim, and
about the coming naval engagement.</p>

<p>At police headquarters, Operator 5 showed credentials indicating
that he was one, George Wakely, of the Department of Justice. He
asked to have the prints on the watch band checked at once.</p>

<p>He waited, fiercely restraining his impatience and anxiety. It
was a very slim chance&mdash;the chance that the man who had struck
his father would have a criminal record, would have his prints
filed here. He thought, as he paced up and down the little anteroom
where he waited, that it would be a grisly irony if his father's
sacrifice in fighting that man were to go for naught.</p>

<p>But in less than five minutes, a grinning fingerprint man came
into the room with a card and photographs. "Here's your man,
Wakely! How's that for cooperation?"</p>

<p>Jimmy seized the card and the pictures. The name typed at the
top of the card brought recollections to him.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>There was more, but Jimmy skipped it. He fastened his eyes on
the picture of the oily, fat Dmitri Osman, committed every feature
to his memory. Then he returned them, together with the card, to
the fingerprint man, uttered hasty thanks, and hurried out.
Downstairs, in the lobby, he entered a telephone booth, dialed a
number.</p>

<p>"Operator 5, talking!" he snapped. "Give me Z-7, quick!" as he
got the connection he spoke crisply, concisely: "Chief! Dad's
been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," broke in Z-7, the head of the United States
Intelligence Service, who was almost a second father to Jimmy
Christopher. His voice was full of sympathy. "I've been trying to
get you, and I phoned Address Y. Diane told me about your dad, and
about Tim. What in the world would they want to kidnap Tim
for?"</p>

<p>"I think I know, Chief. They want to make Tim talk. They want to
find out where Katerina Saratoff is. They're agents of the Leopard,
or I miss my guess. And Chief&mdash;you remember Dmitri Osman, the
international spy? He's in this. Dad got his prints on his
wristwatch strap. And I've got Osman's address. They may have Tim
there&mdash;trying to make him talk. Give me a couple of men,
Chief. I'm going to raid that place."</p>

<p>"You'll have 'em, Jimmy. You'll have more than a couple. I'll
send you a dozen! What's the address?"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher gave it, then hung up. He phoned his father's
house, learned that Doctor Harlan was having Q-6 moved to a
hospital.</p>

<p>"Is it that bad, Di?" he asked hoarsely. "Will he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Diane Elliot's voice was husky, tired. "The doctor doesn't know
yet, Jimmy. They&mdash;they'll know by morning. Katerina and I are
going with him to the hospital. We've got special permission. What
about Tim, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"I think I know where they've got him. I'm raiding the place.
I'll call you later." He got the name of the hospital, hung up, and
went out once more to the car, raced uptown to meet the raiding
squad...</p>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V. &mdash; TREASON TRAIL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TIM DONOVAN groaned, stirred, and blinked. Then he
opened his eyes. He closed them again at once, because fiery
shooting pains were stabbing through his head. His mouth was
parched, and his throat was dry. For a moment he thought he was at
home, awakening from some sort of nightmare. Slowly recollection
struggled back through the dreadful throbbing behind his
temples.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes once more, and the room swam around; the
walls performed grotesque antics about him, and the ceiling seemed
to be tipping drunkenly. He turned painfully from his back to his
side, and put a hand gingerly to the lump on the back of his
head.</p>

<p>His gaze met the stolid glance of the pockmarked man, Selig, who
sat watching him, with a gun on his knee. The man's figure seemed
blurred, and his face looked like a gruesome gargoyle that advanced
and receded, grew bigger and smaller, and danced around.</p>

<p>Tim managed a rueful smile, and said: "Hello, Funny-face. That
was an awful sock you handed me. Hope to return the compliment some
time."</p>

<p>The other snarled, and rose from his chair, went to the door and
opened it. He called down the corridor, and the white-coated
Chinese who had admitted them came, peered in, nodded, and padded
away. In a few moments foot steps sounded, and the woman, Lina,
appeared, followed by Dmitri Osman.</p>

<p>The fat man waddled in, his small eyes fixed intently, viciously
on Tim. He said nothing, but came up to the cot and seized the
boy's left arm in both of his big fat hands, twisted it cruelly.
Tim gasped with the sudden agony, and his face went white with
pain. His head swam. He felt the bone of his arm was about to be
torn from its socket.</p>

<p>But the woman, Lina, cried out: "Osman! You fool! He'll faint
again. We must question him first. Later you can pay him for the
kick in the stomach!"</p>

<p>Osman growled deep in his throat, like an angry animal. But
under the whiplash of the woman's voice, he released Tim's arm.</p>

<p>The boy lay panting on the cot, weak with agony.</p>

<p>Osman stepped back from him, deliberately twisted his face into
a grimace that was meant to be a suave smile. His little eyes
burned with malice. "All right, Lina," he said. "I&mdash;wait!"</p>

<p>The woman turned to Tim Donovan, and she too, smiled, her red
lips curving into soft lines, and her eyes suddenly seeming to
caress the boy.</p>

<p>"My poor lad," she said. "You see, this man is so very hard to
keep in leash. He wants to do so dreadful things to you. Why do you
not speak, and spare yourself suffering? Tell us what you know of
Katerina Saratoff. You are in the confidence of Operator 5. You
know where he hides her. Speak, and I promise that you shall go
unharmed."</p>

<p>Tim's head still throbbed mercilessly; his shoulder muscles
still ached, with a dull, twisted pain. Yet he grinned up at her
impudently.</p>

<p>"Believe me, lady," he said, exerting a tremendous effort to
keep his voice steady, "Fatty is going to get his when Operator 5
catches up with him. You can't get away&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as Lina raised a long, white hand. "Foolish boy! In a
few hours, your Operator 5 will be as helpless as the rest of your
country. From Asia comes the Leopard. Soon he will march into New
York. The fools go out to meet him in stately ships; their ships
will turn tail and run. The Leopard will land with his conquering
might. For no man can resist the Leopard!"</p>

<p>She spoke with such earnestness, with such intensity of feeling,
that Tim forgot his pain. He raised himself on an elbow, asked her:
"Then why are you so anxious to find Katerina Saratoff? If you're
so sure the Leopard will be top hand, why don't you wait?"</p>

<p>The woman cast a side glance at Osman and at the chauffeur,
Selig. She shrugged. "We are only servants of the Leopard. The
Leopard orders, and we obey. He has sworn that his first stroke on
setting foot in the United States, shall be to punish Katerina
Saratoff for defying him in Russia. He wishes her to be presented
to him when he lands."</p>

<p>She came closer to the cot, said urgently: "Speak, boy! I have
told you all you need to know. Now you must talk, or else I cannot
help you."</p>

<p>Tim glared up at her. "Lady," he said, "if you were a man, I'd
tell you to go to hell. Being that you're not a man, I'm only
thinking it!"</p>

<p>Lina's face was suddenly convulsed with frustrated rage. She
swung away from him to Osman. "He is yours, Dmitri!" she blazed.
"Do with him what you like!"</p>

<p>Osman's thick lips parted in a smile of vicious satisfaction.
His thick hands clasped and unclasped, as if they already had the
boy in their grip.</p>

<p>"Now," he gloated, "You will see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ceased talking as the sound of a smashing window came to them
from somewhere in the house. It was followed at once by another
crash of breaking glass, and by a shout in the high-pitched voice
of the Chinese servant. There was a revolver shot out in the hall;
which mingled with the quick, short barks of an automatic.</p>

<p>Osman was fat, but he was a man of action. He swung away from
Tim's cot, and an automatic appeared in his hand. He ripped open
the door, launched himself into the hall, followed by Selig, who
had also drawn a gun.</p>

<p>The woman, Lina, stood with blanched cheeks, one hand at her
breast. From where he lay, propped once more on his elbow, Tim
could see into the hallway, could see Osman crouching, and firing
toward the front of the house, and Selig beside him.</p>

<p>The room, and the hall outside were filled with the thunderous
reverberations of gunfire, and with the acrid fumes of smoke, which
stung Tim's nostrils. From the front of the house he could see
flash after flash from the guns of the attackers. Slugs ricocheted
into the room. Selig uttered a strangled cry, pitched backward,
writhed on the floor, and then lay still, almost at Lina's
feet.</p>

<p>The woman snapped out of her momentary fright, and shouted:
"Osman! Back! Back in here!"</p>

<p>The fat man heard her above the gun roar, and sprang back into
the room, still shooting.</p>

<p>"The boy!" Lina shouted. "Use him as a shield!"</p>

<p>Osman fired the last shot from his automatic, kicked the door
shut, and his fat fingers raced as he inserted another clip. A
heavy body thudded against the door, and Osman, his teeth showing
in a wolfish grin, stepped back, seized Tim by the collar, and
dragged him upright, held him in front of himself. Lina had stooped
and picked up the heavy revolver which Selig had dropped.</p>

<p>For a moment the shots ceased coming from outside, and a
cautious hand tried the knob of the door. Osman called out: "We
have the boy here. If you shoot, you will kill him!"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan was struggling like a wildcat in the grip of the fat
man, striving to twist around so that his fists could reach his
captor's face. He shouted: "Come in shooting, Jimmy! To hell with
him!"</p>

<p>Osman swore under his breath, raised the barrel of the automatic
to strike at Tim's head. But just then a terrific jolt jarred the
door, and it creaked on its frame. Osman stepped back
involuntarily, swung his automatic down to fire through the
wood.</p>

<p>A shot sounded from outside, and the lock flew loose, the wood
around it splintered and smoking. The door swung open, and a man
came charging in, gun raised to fire. The man was Operator 5, and
behind were other Secret Service men. Jimmy Christopher saw Tim in
the grip of Osman, shielding the fat man, and he held his finger
away from the trigger of his gun, pulling up short.</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0603911h-images/WarMastersFromTheOrient-06.gif" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Jimmy Christopher saw Tim in the grip of
Osman</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Osman's lips were foaming at the edges. He kept his grip on Tim,
raised the automatic so that its muzzle pointed at Operator 5. His
finger contracted...</p>

<p>And Tim Donovan, exerting every last ounce of strength in his
pain-wracked body, twisted, pushed out with both hands, and shoved
Osman's gun arm far to the right. The fat man's automatic exploded,
the slug going wild into the wall.</p>

<p>In that second, Jimmy Christopher leaped in, switched his gun
from right hand to left, and brought it down hard on Osman's
temple. Osman's eyes rolled up, the automatic dropped from
nerveless fingers, and his grip on Tim relaxed. Slowly his body
collapsed to the floor.</p>

<p>Lina had clicked the trigger of the revolver she had picked up
from the floor, aiming at Operator 5, but Selig must have emptied
before he was hit. For the hammer fell on an empty chamber, and
before she could move, other Secret Service men had swarmed into
the room to overpower her.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan was wobbling on his feet, and Operator 5 gripped
him, demanded anxiously: "Tim! You all in one piece?"</p>

<p>The boy took a grip on himself, and grinned. "I'm okay. I'm a
little frayed here and there, but I guess I'll last." Suddenly his
tone changed, became somber. "How's dad, Jimmy? Is he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dad's in the hospital," Jimmy told him shortly. "I've got to
call up to find out how he is. Who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Tim's eyes dropped to Osman, who was slowly getting to his feet.
"This guy socked him, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Operator 5's eyes were bleak as he turned to the other Secret
Service men in the room. "Will you boys leave for a few minutes?"
He asked softly. "I've got a little business with this
gentleman!"</p>

<p>The men glanced at each other knowingly, winked at Jimmy, and
filed out. Two of them, holding the woman captive, led her to the
door. As she passed Jimmy she stopped, let her eyes wander over his
trim, well-knit figure. Then she looked up into his face.</p>

<p>"So you are the famous Operator 5?" she queried. "You are
clever, to have found this place so quickly. You and I, perhaps,
can do some business, too. When you are through with that
swine&mdash;" her glance flicked to Osman&mdash;"come and talk to
me."</p>

<p>Operator 5 did not answer. His eyes were cold, hard, and he did
not take them from the fat man. His body was held taut.</p>

<p>The woman shrugged, allowed herself to be led out. Tim remained
in the room. He picked up Osman's automatic, went and took a
position with his back to the door.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Jimmy," he said, very low. "Give it to him!"</p>

<p>Osman regarded Operator 5 out of his narrow slits of eyes. There
was a trace of fear in them. "What are you going to do?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher's thinned lips moved with cold precision as he
said: "The man whom you wounded back at the house is my father. He
is at the hospital now, dying. I am going to put my hands around
your throat and choke you to death!"</p>

<p>Osman's teeth bared in a snarl. He crouched, his two hands
hanging low.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher stepped in, and Osman suddenly lifted both
hands, fingers held stiffly forward, and poked at Jimmy's eyes.</p>

<p>But Operator 5 had learned that trick many years ago in
Constantinople. His head flicked back out of reach; and at the same
time, he brought up his own hands, caught Osman's two forefingers,
and pushed forward and down.</p>

<p>There were two short, ugly snaps of cracking bone, and Osman's
face drained of color. He uttered a short, whimpering cry,
staggered backward, and raised his hands stupidly, looked at the
dangling forefingers. They were both broken.</p>

<p>Jimmy said softly: "That's for what you did to Tim, Mr. Osman.
I'm not blind. I can see that you've been torturing the kid. I'm
not through, either. I've got a few more little tricks to show you
before I kill you!"</p>

<p>He came slowly closer to the fat man, like an inevitable
nemesis.</p>

<p>Osman cringed away from him, all the fight gone out of his fat
body. "For the Love of God," he whimpered, "be merciful! I cannot
stand pain; I will do whatever you want. But do not hurt me!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher's lips curled in scorn. "You can dish it out,
but you can't take it, eh? Well, you've got to take it. Or&mdash;"
his voice lowered&mdash;"would you prefer to tell me a few
things?"</p>

<p>"Anything! Anything!" Osman gasped. There were lines of sweat
running down his round face.</p>

<p>"All right. Tell me how the Leopard plans to win America."</p>

<p>"I do not know that. I swear I do not know! We, here, are not in
the Leopard's confidence. Wait!" As Jimmy came closer, his voice
rose to a screech, and the words tumbled from his quivering lips.
"I only know that the Leopard can make armies to retreat before
him, and can melt all defense. I do not know how. But I can tell
you that he has agents planted with the fleet. Those agents will
see that the fleet is destroyed."</p>

<p>"Their names?" Operator 5's voice crackled. "Quick!"</p>

<p>Osman fumbled in his pocket, drew out a folded slip of paper.
"Lina and I enlisted them all. But we do not know their duties. We
handed them sealed instructions which were mailed to us."</p>

<p>His shaking hand extended the paper to Jimmy, who took it,
stepped back, and ran his eye down the list of six names. He
whistled. "No wonder the Leopard is so confident!" he exclaimed to
Tim. "These are all executive officers!"</p>

<p>Tim suggested: "Call up Admiral Winston, Jimmy, and have him
hold those men on shore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too late, Tim. The fleet has sailed. Here's the wireless
operator on the Dakota, on the list. We'd never be able to get a
message through to Winston. And here's Lieutenant Ward, Winston's
personal secretary."</p>

<p>Suddenly he went to the door, pulled it open. "All right, boys,"
he called to the other Secret Servicemen. "You can come in."</p>

<p>He turned Osman over into their custody, watched them leave with
the fat man, and the woman, Lina, who kept looking back at him all
the time, but who said nothing. Jimmy knew that she guessed Osman
had talked. As soon as the men were gone, leaving two of their
number on guard in the house, Operator 5 swung to Tim Donovan. "How
do you feel, kid? Equal to a little flight?"</p>

<p>Tim flexed his muscles. "As good as ever, Jimmy. Where do we go
this time?"</p>

<p>"We're going to use my autogyro. We're flying out to the fleet,
and have a personal interview with Admiral Winston. God grant that
we get there before he sights the Leopard!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI. &mdash; DISASTER AT SEA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE wide stretch of the Atlantic Ocean was dotted
with little specks from which thin streams of smoke rose in
wavering spirals.</p>

<p>To the two figures in the autogyro high up near the clouds, the
panorama was vast, the ships merely tiny shells whose decks seemed
to swarm with insects.</p>

<p>Those insects were United States marines, hurrying to battle
stations. From their vantage point, high above the planes of the
fleet, the mighty formation of the United States navy appeared
strangely picayune to Operator 5 and to Tim Donovan.</p>

<p>Operator 5 was piloting and Tim was scanning the ocean beyond
the fleet with a pair of binocular telescopes. The thought occurred
to Jimmy Christopher that it was thus with everything that man
did&mdash;down on the earth, it all seemed so important&mdash;his
father dying in a hospital, with Diane and Katerina at his bedside;
Winston, confident in the vast floating armament which he
commanded; the Leopard, seeking world dominion while Europe writhed
in the death-throes of war. They loomed so large down below, while
up here they receded to minute proportions. Jimmy wondered how all
those things must look to God.</p>

<p>He snapped out of his reverie as Tim's arm rose and fell over
the side of the cockpit, pointing to a cluster of smoke spirals far
to the east of the fleet. Jimmy picked up his own binocular
telescopes, leveled them down at the spot indicated. The powerful
glasses brought everything up close to his eyes, and he discerned a
small flotilla, steaming in close formation directly for the United
States Fleet! At the masthead of each of those ships he made out
the peculiar ensign with the figure of the crouching leopard.</p>

<p>He spoke into the instrument connecting with Tim's earphones.
"The Leopard's got something up his sleeve, Tim, or he'd never sail
so boldly for a fleet more than twice his size. And we're too late.
There goes the first gun."</p>

<p>A puff of smoke had billowed out from a forward gun on the
Dakota, and as if at a signal, the long V of the American ships
spread out into a straight line.</p>

<p>It was then that Jimmy Christopher observed the peculiar actions
of the United States planes. They were veering about, flying in odd
directions, as if the pilots did not know exactly what to do, or
where to go. Suddenly they turned, streaked back for their mother
ships, the Langley and the Mattson. The first plane to reach the
Langley bumped and bounced in an awkward landing, crashed its gear.
The pilot of the second plane had not waited to see if the runway
was clear, and he thundered down to end in a smashing holocaust,
tangled with the first. Almost the same thing happened on the
Mattson. In a moment, both aircraft carriers were a mass of living
flame, and the other planes circled helplessly around them, unable
to land, apparently at a loss as to what to do.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher watched, his eyes clouded with dread. "Tim!"
he gasped into the transmitter. "They're without orders!
Something's happened on the Dakota!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the flagship was steaming in an aimless circle, while
the other ships of the line slowed their speed, also began to
wander aimlessly. A destroyer rammed a heavy cruiser, and a huge
pillar of flame erupted into the air. Smoke and fire engulfed the
two ships, and when the wind blew it away, there was little left of
them but the stern of the cruiser, rearing up into the air. Both
ships had sunk in less than five minutes. Other ships rammed each
other now, and soon the whole fleet was entangled in a snarl of
aimlessly wandering, unguided ships. Many of the planes streaked
down into the water, apparently out of control.</p>

<p>Half of the great fleet which had sailed so majestically only a
few minutes before was now nothing but a helpless mass of wreckage;
while the other half, including the Dakota, turned tail and
ran.</p>

<p>And behind them steamed the forty ships of the Leopard, proudly
victorious in their first battle with the greatest fleet in the
Atlantic&mdash;victorious in a battle in which they had not struck
a single blow!</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher circled the scene of wreckage and death,
grinding his teeth helplessly. The two aircraft carriers were on
fire, and he could not land on them. His plane was not equipped
with pontoons, and he couldn't come down on the water.</p>

<p>Before his eyes had taken place the greatest disaster in
American naval history, and he had been utterly powerless to avert
it.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan turned a dread-filled face toward him, asked
tremblingly through the earphones: "Jimmy! What&mdash;what's it all
about?"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher gazed down at the fleeing remnants of the
United States fleet, and his eyes narrowed. He circled the Dakota,
then flew to windward of her, and peered through the telescope at
the cluster of figures on the bridge. He made out the uniform of
Admiral Winston, and beside him that of Captain Loring, the
commander of the ship. Just behind them was Lieutenant Ward.</p>

<p>Ward's name had been on that list in Dmitri Osman's possession.
Jimmy had feared that Ward might do some physical harm to Admiral
Winston at the critical moment, thus leaving the fleet without a
supreme command. That might have slowed up the fleet's movements,
but would not have proved disastrous. There were plenty of men on
those ships who could direct the mighty armada in a sea battle
nearly as well as Winston.</p>

<p>But apparently Ward had not harmed the admiral. Something far
more subtle&mdash;far more devastating had been consummated under
Jimmy Christopher's very eyes. What it was, he could not guess.
However, he had seen its effects.</p>

<p>Now he exclaimed to Tim: "They've got enough ships left to stop
the Leopard's fleet even now! Why, in God's name, are they falling
back?"</p>

<p>There was very little space separating the rearmost of the
United States ships from the foremost of the Leopard's fleet. Now,
with startling abruptness, a long gun in the forward turret of the
Leopard's leading ship belched flame and sound, and a shell
screamed through the air, smashing into the stern of a lagging
American destroyer. At that close range it had been impossible to
miss.</p>

<p>The destroyer's rudder was shattered, and she wallowed suddenly
in the trough of the sea, swinging around slowly with her broadside
to the leading Asiatic ship.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher, flying above the Dakota, exulted. Now was the
opportunity of the crippled destroyer. A single broadside would
blast the pursuing vessel to Kingdom Come. Yet her big guns were
silent. She rocked helplessly, and her captain apparently gave no
orders as the Asiatic ship steamed up past her and let go with all
of her port guns.</p>

<p>The destroyer was raked from stem to stern by that withering
broadside, and abruptly Jimmy Christopher's throat became parched.
For he saw the United States ensign being hauled down from the
staff of the destroyer. She was surrendering without firing a
shot!</p>

<p>Such a thing, to Operator 5's knowledge, had never before
occurred in American naval history! His hand shook a little as he
fingered the controls and banked, coming around into the wind and
returning toward the Dakota.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan's face was white under the flying helmet and
goggles. He brought his lips close to the transmitter, exclaimed:
"God, Jimmy! They're quitting cold! Look! There's the flag coming
down on another ship!" The boy closed his eyes to hide the
sight.</p>

<p>He opened them again, looked back toward Jimmy Christopher.
"What's the matter with Winston? He's watching those ships strike
their colors and not even making a move to do anything about
it!"</p>

<p>It was true. The admiral was standing on the bridge there beside
Captain Loring. He was watching the surrender of the two ships and
not moving. As the autogyro passed directly over the flagship,
Jimmy Christopher looked squarely down, saw that the admiral's
shoulders seemed to droop with despondency. The plane was quite
low, and Jimmy could see the listless glance that Winston threw
upward at them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Operator 5's lips narrowed into a thin line. His eyes
mirrored quick resolve as he barked into the transmitter: "Take
over the controls, Tim!"</p>

<p>The boy looked around very startled. "W-what're you going to do,
Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to bail out! I've got to talk to Winston, and see
what's the trouble with him!"</p>

<p>"But Jimmy&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Take over, Tim! Orders!"</p>

<p>Operator 5's voice crackled with authority, and Tim Donovan
turned reluctantly, tested the controls. The boy had been trained
to fly by Jimmy Christopher, and he held a pilot's license by
special dispensation of the Department of Commerce, even though he
was not of age. And he could fly rings around many seasoned
airmen.</p>

<p>"Get me altitude!" Jimmy snapped.</p>

<p>In response to his command, the plane rose under Tim Donovan's
manipulation, while Operator 5 tightened the cinches of the
parachute about himself.</p>

<p>From one of the Asiatic ships, an antiaircraft gun began to
spit; then another and another. The air about the plane began to be
peppered with lead.</p>

<p>Calmly, in spite of the air-barrage, Jimmy Christopher threw a
leg over the side of the cockpit, waited while Tim maneuvered the
autogyro into position at a spot well ahead of the swiftly
retreating Dakota. Half a dozen of the Asiatic ships were now
joining in the fusillade. A slug sang through a wing of the plane,
another screeched along one of the struts, but did not break
it.</p>

<p>Tim glanced back at Operator 5, cried frantically into the
transmitter: "You can't make it, Jimmy! They'll get you sure on the
way down!"</p>

<p>But Jimmy Christopher didn't hear; for he had just then ripped
off the earphones, thrown his other leg over the side, and kicked
away from the plane. Tim's anxious eyes followed him as he
plummeted down, and the boy uttered a short prayer.</p>

<p>His heart stopped in his mouth until he saw Jimmy Christopher
pull the rip-cord, saw the bag billow and open, saw Jimmy's drop
suddenly broken.</p>

<p>Operator 5 had fallen unscathed through the barrage, and now the
antiaircraft guns followed him down. He was an easier target than
the plane.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan, looking down, saw the muzzles of the long, thin
guns on the Asiatic ship lower, to get Operator 5 in range. He said
under his breath: "God, Jimmy, they'll get you!"</p>

<p>He saw the tracers from below scorching closer and closer to the
parachute. In a moment now they would have the range. The chute was
moving down so slowly that they'd be able to pick off Jimmy
Christopher at their leisure.</p>

<p>And Tim Donovan, his face white, shouted defiantly down:</p>

<p>"Damn you! You won't get him!" With sudden decision, he snapped
off the autogyro control, flung the plane downward in a singing
power dive at the Asiatic fleet. The two machine guns mounted on
the wings of the plane burst out in a wicked stutter as he pressed
the trips, and a hail of lead spattered the deck of the foremost of
the Leopard's ships. Tim flew low, keeping the machine guns
belching until the last moment; then he pulled the plane out of the
dive and rose swiftly.</p>

<p>His trick worked. The guns on all of the Asiatic ships swung
away from the easy target offered by Operator 5, and concentrated
on the autogyro. Tim had drawn their fire in order to give Jimmy
Christopher a chance to get down!</p>

<p>Once more Tim dived; once more he swept the decks of the enemy
ship with hot lead; and again he climbed steeply at the fag end of
the dive. The air around him seemed literally filled with leaden
death. Holes appeared in a hundred places in the plane. A strut
snapped with a sound that was audible even above the roar of the
motors.</p>

<p>But the boy, with his young face set in stubborn lines, returned
again to dive. But he held his hand on the controls. For his
downward glance at the parachute showed him Jimmy Christopher
dropping squarely on the deck of the Dakota!</p>

<p>He yelled jubilantly into space: "Made, it, Jimmy! Attaboy!" He
saw Jimmy Christopher get up out of the tangled mess of the chute,
aided by some of the seamen on the deck. Jimmy looked up, and waved
to Tim.</p>

<p>The boy leaned far out over the side of the ship, and shook
hands with himself in the air. Then, his face all a grin, he
snapped on the autogyro controls, and the huge blades overhead
resumed their rhythmic movement. Tim swung the plane about, lifted
it high out of the range of the barrage and climbed slowly.</p>

<p>Down below, on the Dakota, Jimmy Christopher hastened up to the
bridge. As he passed along the decks he noted the expressions of
the seamen and the marines. Their faces were dazed,
uncomprehending. Most of them paid no attention to Operator 5. They
were looking out to sea, watching boarding parties from the Asiatic
ships taking over command of the United States vessels which had
struck their colors.</p>

<p>When Jimmy Christopher reached the bridge, he strode wrathfully
past several officers, faced Admiral Winston.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir!" he exclaimed. "You are throwing this battle to
the Leopard! Even now, you have more ships left than he has. Why
don't you turn on him? You haven't fired a shot yet!"</p>

<p>ADMIRAL WINSTON stood there dejectedly, a beaten man. Beside
him, Captain Loring seemed no more spirited. The commander of the
Dakota did not even appear to hear what Jimmy had said to the
admiral. Instead, he threw a frightened glance in the direction of
the pursuing ships of the Asiatic fleet, and turned to the engine
room telegraph. He pressed a button, spoke into the tube:</p>

<p>"Can't you get more steam up, Michaels?" he demanded of the
engineer. "They're still gaining on us!"</p>

<p>Then he turned back, stared out over the bridge at the dreadful
scene behind them on the sea. United States ships were floating in
flames behind them. Other ships were being boarded by the enemy.
Not an American plane was left in the air. All around, behind them,
the waters were dotted with the wreckage of those
planes&mdash;twisted masses of metal and fabric which had plunged
into the water at the command of some invisible force.</p>

<p>The anti-aircraft guns had ceased the snarling, but other guns
on the enemy ships had opened up now, and shells were falling all
about the Dakota and the other fleeing vessels.</p>

<p>Admiral Winston's eyes seemed glazed, expressionless, as he
faced Jimmy Christopher. Behind the admiral, Lieutenant Ward gazed
out at the scene with a dull, listless face.</p>

<p>Operator 5 stepped close to the admiral, seized his coat in one
hand, shook him.</p>

<p>"Winston!" he cried. "Don't you hear me? What's the matter with
you? Look at those ships firing at us! Turn around, man, and put up
a fight! Our guns are superior to theirs. We have a longer range!
You can still smash that Asiatic fleet!"</p>

<p>Winston shook his head slowly, hopelessly. "It's no use,
Operator 5. It's no use! We can never fight the Leopard. Our only
hope is to escape!"</p>

<p>The other officers clustered about the rail, paying no attention
to Jimmy's hot words, but staring listlessly out over the ocean,
their sole thought seeming to be of escape.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher's hand dropped from the admiral's coat. His
eyes reflected puzzlement, bewilderment. These men were all brave
men, he knew. They had distinguished themselves in many naval
engagements during the war. The very men who stood there&mdash;the
captain and officers of the Dakota&mdash;had run a submarine
blockade into the Mediterranean half a dozen times, convoying
troops to Europe. The Dakota had been chosen as the flagship of the
Atlantic fleet because its crew had signalized itself by its valor
in standing off an enemy squadron in the Mediterranean for sixteen
hours only a couple of months ago, while the transports it was
convoying made port safely. Yet here they were, turning tail meekly
without firing a shot, and fleeing from an enemy which had not
fired a single shot at them until just now.</p>

<p>Impulsively, Jimmy Christopher turned to Captain Loring. "You,
captain!" he urged. "You're a hero to the American public. If you
turn tail now, running away like this without firing a shot, you'll
go home in disgrace. Give the order to turn around and fight,
Captain. I'm sure the other ships will follow your example!"</p>

<p>Loring's face was white with some unnamed dread. "We can't
fight!" he groaned hoarsely. "We don't mind dying; but we can't
fight something we don't understand!"</p>

<p>The heavy guns of the Asiatic fleet were thundering behind them.
The cruiser, Star, next in line to the Dakota, was suddenly struck
by a shell. The shell hit the rear gun-turret, doing little damage
against the heavy armor-plate. Yet almost at once the Star's flag
began to come down!</p>

<p>Winston turned away from Jimmy Christopher, said in a dazed
voice to Lieutenant Ward: "Do you think we should strike our colors
too? It's so hopeless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Operator 5's face was set, his eyes bleak. He seized Winston by
the shoulder, swung him around roughly.</p>

<p>"You're mad, Winston!" he shouted. "You've got more strength
than the Leopard. Look at that fleet of his&mdash;there are not
more than ten ships of war; the rest are transports. Didn't you say
that you could blast them out of the water in no time? Go ahead and
do it! Give the signal to the fleet to stand and fight!"</p>

<p>Winston gazed at him with dull eyes. "I was mistaken, Operator
5. No man can stand against the Leopard. The less opposition we
give him, the better it will be for us&mdash;and for the whole
country.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" Jimmy Christopher cried, "you're yellow!" He pushed
past the admiral and Captain Loring, stared down onto the deck at
the massed men below. They were all looking up at the bridge with
pallid, fear-ridden faces.</p>

<p>Operator 5 called out to them: "Men! Your officers are mad. They
are throwing this fight. Are you going to let them? By running away
now, you are delivering your wives and daughters to the mercy of
the Leopard. Will you fight? Then let's take over the
ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no farther than that. Behind him he heard Captain Loring
order: "Seize him!"</p>

<p>He swung about, but too late. There was a rush of feet, and the
dozen officers on the bridge overwhelmed him. He struck out with
both fists, desperately, madly. For a moment they gave back before
the fierceness of his attack.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the rail again, shouted down to the men
below:</p>

<p>"Come on up, men! Take the ship! Let's put up a fight!"</p>

<p>But the men below stood about listlessly, not moving. And he
swung back to the attacking officers just in time to see Lieutenant
Ward aiming at him with a revolver from behind Admiral Winston's
back. He ducked, launched himself at Ward. But the revolver in the
lieutenant's hand bucked, roared. If Jimmy had been standing still
at the moment, the slug from that gun would have struck him between
the eyes. As it was, his leap saved his life. The slug tore through
his flying helmet, creased the top of his skull.</p>

<p>Jimmy fell full length on the deck, lay there still. Blood oozed
from the top of his head.</p>

<p>The big guns of the Asiatic fleet continued to boom, as Ward
calmly put his revolver away, said coolly to Winston: "That
disposes of him, sir. Now we had better try to get away before they
sink us."</p>

<p>Winston nodded eagerly, said to Loring: "Get that engineer of
yours to coax more steam out of her, Captain."</p>

<p>Loring saluted, turned to obey. And far above them, Tim Donovan
in the autogyro, put down the binocular telescopes with which he
had been watching the scene on the deck of the Dakota, while tears
of chagrin coursed down his youthful cheeks. He shook his little
fist down at the sea with impotent rage.</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" he sobbed. "Jimmy! They've killed you, Jimmy. God,
they've killed you!" His hands shook on the controls as he raced
back for shore...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII. &mdash; AMERICA IS DOOMED!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was toward evening that the crippled remnants
of the American fleet steamed into New York harbor past the Statue
of Liberty, which seemed to stare at them in sardonic bitterness as
they filed by. Some thirty-odd ships were all that was left of the
majestic fleet which had sailed out so confidently to meet an
inferior enemy that morning... New Yorkers, drawn and gray of face,
lined the Battery and the banks of the Hudson, staring
uncomprehendingly at these iron-and-steel bulwarks of their safety,
which had proved to be no bulwarks at all.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan had returned hours ago, bringing word of the
debacle, and now the boy sat tense and white-lipped in that same
room in the Custom House where Jimmy Christopher had brought
Katerina Saratoff that morning. He was telling the story of what he
had seen to the Secretary of War, to General Falk, and to another
man. This other man was the black-eyed, square-jawed head of the
United States Intelligence Service, known as Z-7. He was Operator
5's chief.</p>

<p>The three men listened to Tim's tale in unbelieving wonder. "I
tell you&mdash;" the boy's voice almost broke&mdash;"I saw it with
my own eyes. I saw the ships haul down their flags, and I saw Jimmy
shot. They were fighting on the bridge, and one of the officers
with Admiral Winston pulled out a gun and shot him!"</p>

<p>Z-7 got up and paced nervously up and down the room. "After all
this!" he muttered. "To think that Operator 5 would be killed by
our own men!" He turned to the Secretary of War and General Falk.
"That young man was like a son to me. His father served under me.
Now his father's in the hospital&mdash;and Jimmy is dead!"</p>

<p>The Secretary of War shrugged. "I sympathize with you, Z-7. But
there are graver things for us to consider. It appears that
Operator 5 was right when he warned us of the Leopard's power. We
laughed at him this morning. Now, if he were alive, he could laugh
at us."</p>

<p>Tim Donovan got up, his lower lip trembling. The boy was trying
hard to restrain his emotion. "Jimmy wouldn't laugh at you, Mr.
Secretary. He would do something! Look!" Tim pointed dramatically
out the window, from which a view of the Upper Bay was afforded.
There, under their eyes, was the spectacle of the fleet, limping
into port.</p>

<p>Behind the United States ships appeared a line of strange
vessels. "There they come!" Tim exclaimed. "The Leopard's fleet!
Why do you sit here? Why don't you do something? Are you going to
let them take New York?"</p>

<p>General Falk stirred, got up and came to the window.</p>

<p>"They won't take New York," he said with confidence. "The fleet
will make a stand in the harbor. Every fort in the harbor and on
Staten Island, as well as the coast defense, is just waiting for my
signal to open up. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The general stopped short, and his face went pale. "God!" he
exclaimed. He reached to the desk, snatched up a telescope, and
raised it to his eye. The others in the room clustered around
him.</p>

<p>"The fleet is surrendering!" he said hoarsely. "Look at
that!"</p>

<p>The others didn't need the telescope to see the flag coming down
on the Dakota.</p>

<p>In a moment the other ships of the fleet followed suit. There,
practically within the harbor of New York, the remnants of the
country's sea-forces were striking their colors.</p>

<p>"It's uncanny!" Falk murmured. "I would never have thought it of
Winston. I've seen that man fight. He's never been afraid of
anything in his life. And now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swung away from the window. The Secretary of War took the
telescope from him with a trembling hand, applied it to his eye.
Tim Donovan crowded up beside the portly cabinet officer, and
watched the American ships heave to, each with its flag lowered,
and await the slow, steady approach of the Asiatic fleet.</p>

<p>The Secretary suddenly thrust the telescope at Tim, rushed to
the phone on the table. "I've got to call Washington&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was roughly pushed aside by General Falk, who growled at
him:</p>

<p>"Washington can wait! This is more pressing!" And he seized the
phone, barked a number into it. When he got his connection he
snapped:</p>

<p>"Falk talking! Give the signal for Forts Wood and Jay to open up
at once on the enemy fleet in the harbor. Have them flood the bay
with shells! Bring every gun to bear on those ships. And they
needn't worry about our own vessels. Understand? And they're not to
stop until I give the word. I'll be watching!"</p>

<p>He put down the phone, turned to the others with a saturnine
smile. "Watch the fireworks now!" he said. "The gunners at those
forts have been waiting for the signal for an hour. In one minute
the bombardment will begin. The Leopard and his fleet have sailed
into a trap!"</p>

<p>He pushed past the Secretary of War, and stepped to the window
beside Tim Donovan. The Secretary peered over his shoulder, while
Z-7 went to the next window.</p>

<p>Everybody in the room was at high tension. The thoughts of Z-7
and of Tim Donovan were divided between the peril that threatened
the city, and the fate which had overtaken Operator 5. They all
watched, dull-eyed, the dramatic scene in the Bay, almost within
the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, and of Fort Wood, on Bedloe
Island. Boarding parties had left several of the vessels in the
Asiatic Fleet, and were moving toward the American ships, which
were awaiting them docilely.</p>

<p>Falk chuckled, deep in his throat. "Thirty seconds more," he
said, "and you will see what I mean by a trap. These ships are
right under the guns of Fort Wood on Bedloe Island, and of Fort Jay
on Governor's Island. They won't be there five minutes after the
bombardment opens. Mr. Leopard doesn't seem to know that it is
impossible to attack New York Harbor. I've spent ten years making
it impregnable. Our coast defense guns, together with the batteries
in the forts can sink anything that floats before it gets to the
Battery!"</p>

<p>He reached for the telescope which Tim was using, saying
gruffly: "Here, boy. I'll take&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tim interrupted him with a hoarse shout, jerked the glass out of
the general's grasp, and kept his eye at it. "Jimmy!" he shouted.
"It's Jimmy! He's just dived off the Dakota!" The lad turned
around, his eyes shining with sudden relief and joy, and he almost
screamed at Z-7: "It's Jimmy, I tell you! I saw his face as he
jumped!"</p>

<p>The others, also, had seen the lone figure race down the ladder
from the bridge to the deck of the Dakota, leap over the side. They
had not recognized the man, of course, but Tim had been focusing
his glass on the flagship, in an effort to find the body of
Operator 5. Now he almost danced with joy.</p>

<p>Falk scowled, attempted to take the telescope from him, but the
boy pushed the general aside, peered through it again. He followed
the swimming figure as it stroked powerfully away from the Dakota,
while Z-7 breathed a deep sigh of relief. The news that Jimmy
Christopher was still alive had removed a heavy load from his
heart.</p>

<p>But General Falk growled: "Too bad. Ten seconds to go. When the
bombardment starts, Operator 5 won't have a chance. Even if he
isn't directly hit, the detonation will stun him. He'll sink!"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan turned quickly, gripped the general's sleeve. His
eyes were desperate, and his lips were trembling. "Please,
General!" he begged. "Hold off on the bombardment for a couple of
minutes. He's a strong swimmer. Give him a fighting chance to get
away. Quick! You still have time to phone!"</p>

<p>FALK shook his head. "Sorry, boy. I know how you feel. But we
can't let one man's life stand in our way now. Operator 5 will have
to take his medicine. I'd sacrifice a thousand lives&mdash;I'm
doing it anyway&mdash;in order to blast that Asiatic. Fleet out of
the harbor. I'm sacrificing the lives of every man in our own
ships. I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan sobbed hysterically, beat with his fists against
Falk's uniformed breast. "Damn you! Damn you!" he shouted. "You
never liked Jimmy. Now you're willing to see him die. Well, you
won't!"</p>

<p>Out in the harbor the lone swimmer cut through the water
lithely, swiftly. In the room, Falk staggered backward under the
boy's sudden onslaught, his face purple with rage.</p>

<p>Abruptly Tim sprang away from him, scooped up the phone from the
desk. "Give me Corps Headquarters!" he snapped into the
instrument.</p>

<p>Falk demanded: "What are you going to do?" and leaped toward
him.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan's eyes were blazing. He reached into the open drawer
of the desk, where he saw a service revolver lying, and snatched it
out, leveled it at General Falk.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" he shouted. "I'll kill you if you try to stop
me!"</p>

<p>Falk stopped stock-still at the wild look in Tim's eyes. He knew
that the boy would shoot.</p>

<p>Into the telephone Tim spoke rapidly: "Corps Headquarters!
General Falk wishes to countermand the order to open bombardment.
You will delay it ten minutes, then open&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped speaking as Z-7 came around the desk, behind him, and
struck down the wrist in which he held the revolver. Falk jumped in
and snatched it away, clubbed it to bring it down on Tim's head.
But Z-7 blocked the blow.</p>

<p>Falk glared at the Intelligence Chief. "Look out of my way! I'll
break that whelp's neck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing!" Z-7 snapped at him. "Don't you see that the
lad is crazy with fear?" He glanced down at Tim, who had collapsed
on the desk, sobbing with deep rasping sobs that racked his young
body. He put his hand on the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tim!" he said softly. "It had to be this way. Jimmy would have
wanted it like this if he'd been asked. I'd gladly die in his place
if I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>Falk had grasped the telephone, and was barking into it:</p>

<p>"Proceed as I ordered, Lieutenant Gormley. Let the bombardment
commence without delay. Have you given the order...what?"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan stopped his sobbing, raised his head at the sudden
urgency&mdash;the sudden hint of panic in the general's voice.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War stepped closer, demanded sharply: "What's
the matter, Falk?"</p>

<p>But the Chief of Staff didn't answer. He listened to a staccato
voice at the other end, then shouted into the transmitter: "Put me
through directly to Colonel Sloane at Fort Wood. Why!
the&mdash;the&mdash;" Falk seemed to choke on the sudden anger that
filled him. He stuttered for a moment, swallowed hard, then roared
into the phone: "I'll hold the line! Put me right through!"</p>

<p>While he waited for the connection he sputtered with rage.</p>

<p>Z-7 glanced at Tim Donovan, said quietly: "I don't think you
need to worry about Jimmy."</p>

<p>The Secretary of War demanded again: "What is the meaning of all
this, Falk? You said the bombardment would commence in one minute.
It's more than two minutes now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Falk tried to keep calm. His hand squeezed so hard on the
telephone that it seemed the instrument would be snapped in two. He
said tightly: "Colonel Sloane, at Fort Wood, informs Lieutenant
Gormley that he thinks it's no use to bombard the Leopard's fleet.
He says it's hopeless to try to defend New York against the
invasion. He won't fight!"</p>

<p>The Secretary took a step backward as if he had been struck a
blow. He echoed Falk's words. "Won't fight? But-but&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He stopped as Falk got his connection, fairly roared into the
phone:</p>

<p>"Sloane! What's happened to you over there? Are you mad? Get
your guns in action, I tell you. Hurry man! You... my God!" Falk's
voice broke. Tim and Z-7, who were quite close to the
general,&mdash;distinctly heard the click at the other end, as
Colonel Sloane hung up on his superior.</p>

<p>All the energy seemed to go out of Falk. He sighed, and let the
phone drop from listless hands. "We're licked!" he said in a very
low voice. "Sloane is quitting on the job. Gormley tells me that
the commanders of Wadsworth and Hamilton won't fight either. The
coast defense are lying down, too. They all say the same
thing&mdash;that it's no use trying to fight the Leopard!"</p>

<p>TIM stared at him with wet, red eyes. "Jimmy Christopher warned
you that something like this would happen. Didn't he tell you that
the Leopard had marched across Russia without opposition? Didn't he
tell you the same thing would happen here? But you wouldn't listen
to him! Maybe you'll listen to him now!"</p>

<p>The boy sprang to the window. Night had fallen swiftly.</p>

<p>It was too dark to be able to make out anything on the waters of
the bay. If Operator 5 were still swimming, it was impossible to
catch sight of him.</p>

<p>There were red lights on the ships, now, and Tim shuddered as he
saw the ominous Leopard flag go up on one after another of the
American vessels as the boarding parties reached them.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War watched over Tim's shoulder. "There's no
more United States Navy!" he whispered. He swung on Falk. "Those
ships of the Leopard will land their troops in the morning. We've
got to organize a defense. We've got to keep them out of New
York!"</p>

<p>Falk laughed. "How are we going to keep them out? Our officers
won't fight!" His eyes swung to Z-7, who had picked up the
telephone and was talking quietly into it. When the Intelligence
chief hung up, Falk asked him sarcastically: "Well, what are you
doing to save your country from invasion? Or do you think we ought
to retreat before the Leopard the way the Russians did?"</p>

<p>Z-7 replied without rancor. "We seem to be at a standstill. You
appear helpless. I've phoned some of my men to get out in the
harbor and try to pick up Operator 5. I confess I don't know what
steps to suggest next. Perhaps he will know what to do."</p>

<p>Falk grimaced. "I'll not wait for that. I'm going to order all
the troops available into New York. The Leopard can't land till
morning. By then we'll have a reception ready for him!"</p>

<p>Z-7 laughed bitterly. "The only trained troops in the area
embarked this morning&mdash;against the advice of Operator 5, I
understand. They're out at sea now, waiting for a convoy which will
never arrive. Where are you going to get troops?"</p>

<p>"I'll get them...somewhere!" Falk said stubbornly. "We're not
reduced yet to waiting for the advice of a young whippersnapper
like your Operator 5!"</p>

<p>The Secretary of War frowned. He leaned his stout, soft body
against the window sill, stared out moodily at the ships clustered
in the bay. "I can't understand this," he said querulously. "What
could Winston have learned that caused him to turn tail and
retreat? And what can have happened to Sloane and the commanders of
the other forts in the bay, to make them feel it's useless to
fight? I've got to call the President, and God help me, I don't
know what to tell him!"</p>

<p>"Tell him," Z-7 said harshly, "that he will soon be a president
without a country. Tell him that within forty-eight hours he will
see the United States laid waste the way Russia was; that he will
see his country pillaged and raped and burned&mdash;if he leaves
its defense in the present hands!" Z-7's chin jutted. "And if you
don't tell him that, I will, by God!"</p>

<p>General Falk's face flushed a deep red, and his hands clenched.
He took a single step forward, and stopped, facing the Intelligence
Chief. The two men stood that way for a long minute, their eyes
locked, wills clashing.</p>

<p>In a moment there might have been a physical clash between the
two. But just then the telephone rang. Without taking his eyes from
Z-7, Falk picked it up and answered it. Then he handed it sullenly
to Z-7. The Intelligence Chief took the instrument, said: "Yes?"
and listened for a second. His eyes brightened. "See that he has
dry clothes," he ordered, "and bring him right up here!" He put
down the phone, exclaimed excitedly: "They've picked up Operator 5!
He's safe! Now&mdash;!"</p>

<p>His words were drowned by the dull boom of cannonading. Flashes
of fire shone from Governor's Island, out in the harbor. They all
rushed to the window. Thunderous detonations reverberated through
the air, deafening them. Huge projectiles screamed high over their
heads, above the roof of the Custom House Building. The night was
suddenly made garish with flame and fire and noise.</p>

<p>The three men and the boy looked out at the harbor, standing in
speechless amazement; terror rushed upon them as they realized what
was happening.</p>

<p>Z-7 exclaimed in choked horror: "The Leopard has taken Fort Jay!
They've turned our guns against us. They're bombarding the
city!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE LEOPARD'S FIRST
BLOW</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITHIN twenty minutes after the bombardment began,
New York City became untenable. The enemy had not stopped at the
capture of Fort Jay. They had taken, in swift sequence, Forts Wood,
Hamilton and Wadsworth. The big guns of these forts, together with
the heavy pieces of the surrendered ships, belched a continuous
torrent of steel into the metropolis. The Leopard seemed to be bent
upon making a shambles of Manhattan Island, and he succeeded.
Shells fell everywhere, spreading destruction and devastation.
Almost at once the great exodus began. Every means of conveyance
was used to hurry frantic, terror-stricken civilians to safety. But
those who perished far outnumbered those who escaped.</p>

<p>All the main arteries leading out of Manhattan were clogged with
autos of all vintages and descriptions. Household goods were
abandoned. Trucks labored under loads of fifty and sixty people
apiece. Private cars were crowded to capacity. The few regular
soldiers available in the city, as well as the National Guard, were
hastily impressed to aid the police in keeping traffic moving
northward into Westchester, and across the Hudson into Jersey.</p>

<p>General Falk had acted with speed and efficiency. In spite of
his choleric temper and hide-bound, old-school methods, he was a
brave man, capable of quick decisions. He had only a few minutes
after the commencement of the rain of steel projectiles in which to
issue orders. After that the telephones and the lighting systems
were paralyzed.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he was big enough to
acknowledge his mistakes when he was finally convinced of them; and
when Jimmy Christopher burst into the room in the Custom House,
dripping wet, not having waited to change clothes, the general was
the first to meet him at the door.</p>

<p>"Operator 5," he said steadily, "I've been an old fool.
Everything you predicted has come to pass." Falk's face was
suddenly lined and old. "If we shouldn't survive this night, I want
to say here and now that I am the one to blame!"</p>

<p>He had to shout to make himself heard above the thunder of the
guns and the crashing explosions in the city where the big shells
fell.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher passed a wet hand across his face, and wrung
water from his flying suit. He was panting, breathing hard from his
long swim. There was a raw welt across the top of his head, where
Ward's bullet had creased him. He was weary, almost dropping from
his wound and from exhaustion. But his eyes still flashed with the
energy that kept him going even while his body screamed to him from
every muscle for rest.</p>

<p>He brushed Falk's self-criticism aside. "You're not to blame,
General. You couldn't be expected to believe that anything like
this could happen. Now we've got to face it. You must use every
available man in uniform. All cars and trucks must be commandeered,
and the city of New York must be evacuated. God knows if we'll be
able to get a tenth of the people out of here alive!"</p>

<p>Falk nodded eagerly, rushed to the telephone. He issued swift
orders, then listened while Jimmy swiftly outlined more things that
had to be done.</p>

<p>"We must keep communications open. In a little while, the
telephone lines will be down, and the light cables will be
destroyed. A shell may strike a vital spot at any time. Arrange for
communication by flares and Very light. Get in touch with Forts
Slocum and Schuyler in Westchester, with Fort Tilden in Rockaway,
and Totten in Bayside. They all have the range of the harbor. Have
them open up at once."</p>

<p>Falk nodded, talked swiftly into the phone. He got the machinery
of transportation in motion, then called Fort Tilden. Just as he
got the connection, the line went dead. He dropped the phone, made
a gesture of resignation. "That's that. I'll have to send
messengers now."</p>

<p>He turned to the Secretary of War. "You'd better be getting out,
sir. This building may be hit any minute. All of you&mdash;" he
waved a hand to include Tim Donovan and Z-7&mdash;"come out of
here."</p>

<p>He led the way down to the street. Outside, though night had set
in, there was plenty of light to see by. Fires had started in a
hundred places throughout the city, and the flames made the
darkness bright. The din of the cannonading deafened them, and the
screeching of the shells made a continuous unearthly sound that
dinned into their brains.</p>

<p>Men and women were running about wildly, panic-stricken. They
had come down here to the Battery to see the fleet come back
victorious. Instead, they had witnessed its abject surrender. Even
when they saw the gruesome flag of the Leopard on the pursuing
ships&mdash;even when they saw that flag go up on the captured
United States vessels&mdash;they had not fully realized their own
peril. Now, with the city in flames, with the continuous booming of
cannon, their minds refused to react to the full significance of
the catastrophe. They milled about on the Battery and in Bowling
Green, like so many sheep, waiting for a shell to descend upon them
and wipe them out of existence.</p>

<p>In response to Falk's orders, automobiles began to pour into the
square, driven by National Guardsmen, and the terror-stricken
people were loaded into them, packed like sardines, and driven
quickly across to the East River, where ferries carried them over
to Queens and the remoter parts of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>All the bridges were jammed. One of the first shells struck the
Williamsburg Bridge, and the mighty structure buckled, collapsed
into the river carrying with it thousands of unfortunates who had
been seeking safety. After that, no one would use the remaining
bridges to Queens and Brooklyn, and as a result, the ferries were
overloaded. One ferry foundered in crossing, and hundreds more
perished.</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0603911h-images/WarMastersFromTheOrient-07.gif" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">The mighty structure buckled, collapsed into the
river.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Soon the streets became impassable with debris from collapsed
buildings. Huge craters appeared in the asphalt where shells
struck. Water mains burst, flooding the whole of Manhattan Island.
Gas fumes filled the air, mingling with the smell of cordite.</p>

<p>At Times Square, where there was an intricate network of subway
lines underground, the whole surface caved in from the west side of
Seventh Avenue to the east side of Broadway, and from Forty-second
to Forty-fourth street. The Times Building and the Paramount
Theatre Building collapsed, as well as many smaller structures in
the area. The exact loss of life was never ascertained.</p>

<p>At last it became impossible for vehicles to move out of the
city, due to the broken up streets. Those who had not escaped with
the first wave of the exodus, and who were unable to find
accommodations on any of the ferries, were doomed to remain and
die. And die they did.</p>

<p>After five hours of steady shelling, the bombardment suddenly
ceased. There was now no sign of life anywhere in the streets. Of
the almost two million souls who had inhabited the borough of
Manhattan, it was estimated that less than two hundred thousand had
escaped the holocaust. The scorched, twisted, charred, drowned
bodies of the other million eight hundred thousand persons made of
Manhattan Island the greatest graveyard in the world.</p>

<p>At a single stroke, as many people had been wiped out as the
United States had sent overseas to the trenches of Europe. And now
the pitifully depleted troops gathered in Westchester, in Long
Island and in Jersey, prepared to make a stand against the
invaders.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War had flown to Washington in Jimmy
Christopher's autogyro, with a pilot whom General Falk had
supplied.</p>

<p>Jimmy himself, with the general, Tim Donovan and Z-7, remained
in Manhattan until the last moment; all three of them kept
constantly on the move, exerting themselves tirelessly to save the
last possible human being from the terrific barrage that was being
laid down. The section around the Battery had not been as heavily
hit as other parts, and they were able to stall almost until the
end of the bombardment. It was from an improvised headquarters that
General Falk issued orders by means of runner and signal, for the
concentration of what troops there were at hand around the Kensico
Dam in Westchester, around Forest Park in Queens, and along the
Palisades on the Jersey shore.</p>

<p>IT was at Jimmy Christopher's recommendation that he chose those
sites, each of them being ideal for defense by a small body of
men.</p>

<p>At last, bursting water mains flooded them out of Bowling Green,
and they moved eastward just as the first of the Leopard's ships
moved up the Hudson with the dawn.</p>

<p>Forts Schuyler, Slocum and Totten, as well as Tilden in
Rockaway, had laid down a barrage in the harbor, but had done
little damage to the enemy ships, for they had moved about
constantly, without lights. Observation planes sent up from every
field had been able to render little help in range-finding, due to
the darkness. A couple of hits had been scored on Bedloe Island,
but not at the fort; the right arm of the Statue of Liberty had
been struck, falling in a shattered mass of metal. One or two of
the enemy ships had been struck by accident, but aside from that,
the Leopard's fleet was unscathed through the night.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn, a flock of airplanes went up at Falk's
command, but no sooner had they appeared over the Asiatic Fleet,
than they began to act as erratically as had those attached to
Winston's squadrons. Some mysterious power wielded by the Leopard
seemed to deprive the pilots of their faculties, and the planes
crashed into each other in the air, took nose dives, and went into
tailspins until they struck the water.</p>

<p>After the destruction of the first contingent, Falk ordered no
more air observation. It was at this time that he decided to leave
Manhattan and take over command of the forces he had concentrated
in Westchester.</p>

<p>"We'll make our stand around the Kensico Dam," he told Jimmy.
"If this damn voodoo of the Leopard's should, by any chance, work
up there, we'll be able to smash the dam and flood him out. It'll
mean a terrific waste of land, and it'll do irreparable damage; but
it'll all be nothing to what's already been done!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher had worked like a beaver with the general, as
had Tim and Z-7. But through it all there had preyed on Jimmy's
mind the thought of his father in Mercy Hospital, and of Diane and
Katerina with him. The hospital must have been destroyed with
everything else. There was a queer heaviness in his chest when he
stopped for a moment to think of that, but he said nothing, knowing
that the same thing must be in the minds of Z-7 and Tim
Donovan.</p>

<p>At last, the general was ready to leave by the power boat which
awaited him at the foot of Liberty Street, on the East River. He
said to Operator 5: "All right. I guess there's nothing more we can
do here. We can't help the dead. The power boat will take us up the
river around Astoria to the Glenn Curtiss Airport. I've got a plane
waiting there to fly us to the Kensico Dam. Let's go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute, general," Jimmy Christopher said quietly. "You
go with Tim and Z-7. I'm staying here."</p>

<p>Falk stared at him. "Staying here! Why, man, the Leopard's
troops will land here in an hour. You'll be taken&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've got to stay, General," Jimmy persisted. "You know in your
heart that all these plans you're making aren't worth a tinker's
damn. The Leopard has some kind of power that makes our men quit
before they start. How do you know you'll be immune to it, any more
than Winston was, or the commanders of the forts in the bay? Our
only chance is to find out what that power is. I'm going to stay
and make a try at finding out!"</p>

<p>They were in the street in front of the Custom House Building,
and Z-7 stepped up beside Jimmy, said quickly: "I'm staying
too!"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan exclaimed: "Attaboy! The three of us will stay. We
can't leave Jimmy here alone. We'll show that Leopard&mdash;well
clip his claws yet!"</p>

<p><br>
GENERAL FALK'S face was gray in the half light of the new morning.
His eyes mirrored a strange wistfulness. "You are brave&mdash;I
almost said 'men'&mdash;" with a glance at Tim's slim youthfulness.
"The Three Musketeers! I&mdash;I wish I could stay here with you.
You're right, Operator 5. There's little chance of our making a
stand against the Leopard as long as he controls this power to make
us quit. There's no use in my taking over command at Kensico;
anybody else can surrender just as well as I can." Suddenly a
fierce resolve showed in his face.</p>

<p>"I'm going to remain here with you! Let me die with you, rather
than see our country ravished by this coolie from Asia!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Jimmy Christopher burst out. "You're needed elsewhere,
sir!" General Falk was an executive whom it would be hard, if not
impossible to replace at this time. Though Operator 5 had clashed
with him often, he recognized the old war-dog's outstanding ability
and innate tenacity. For him to stay here engaged in espionage
work, would constitute a fatal loss to the defenses of the
country.</p>

<p>"You've got to go, sir!" he rushed on. "This isn't your work;
it's ours. Take Tim along with you&mdash;he doesn't belong here
either. Hurry, sir. Z-7 and I will need time to get under cover and
perfect our plans. Come on!" He started to lead the way across the
water-swept street, littered with sewage from broken pipes.</p>

<p>But Falk stood his ground stubbornly. "I'm staying with you!
Operator 5, I am the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. As
such I am the superior of yourself and Z-7. I order you to cease
arguing. I'm staying!"</p>

<p>Jimmy turned slowly, throwing a side glance at Z-7. He said: "I
admire you for your courage, sir. If I were in your place, I'd want
to do the same. But you're needed at Kensico. So I hope that later
on you'll forgive me for this!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he stepped in close, brought up his bunched fist in
a swift blow to the point of Falk's jaw. There was a dull thud, and
the general sagged, his eyes glazing.</p>

<p>Jimmy caught him before he fell to the ground. "Help me carry
him to the boat, Z-7!" he rapped.</p>

<p>The Intelligence Chief was startled at Jimmy's swift action;
then suddenly he smiled, bent to help. The two men carried General
Falk across the three blocks to the foot of Liberty Street,
deposited him in the power boat which was waiting, manned by three
officers of the General Staff.</p>

<p>They fired questions at Z-7 and Jimmy Christopher when they saw
their chief being carried, unconscious.</p>

<p>"The general's had an accident," Jimmy explained. "He'll be all
right in a little while. Take him up to the airport as fast as you
can."</p>

<p>The officer in charge, who knew both Z-7 and Operator 5, nodded,
and made Falk as comfortable as possible in the stern of the
boat.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," Jimmy said. He swung around to Tim Donovan.
"All right, kid. Get in there too."</p>

<p>Tim Donovan shook his head rebelliously. "Nix, Jimmy. I go where
you go. Laugh that off!"</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped close to Tim, drawing his right arm back a bit,
setting himself for another blow. But the boy had learned his
lesson from watching what had happened to Falk. He backed away
hurriedly, turned and ran down the street. Then, when he got a safe
distance away he stopped, and thumbed his nose at Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" Jimmy shouted. "Get in that boat or I'll break
your neck!"</p>

<p>"Okay, Jimmy!" the lad called back. "Send the boat away, and
I'll bring my neck over to be broken!"</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged helplessly. He nodded to the officer, and the
painter was thrown off, the boat chugged up the river bearing the
unconscious Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>Z-7 said to Jimmy: "The lad's been through so much with you,
he's entitled to stay, Jimmy. I can tell how he feels with your
father and Diane probably dead, with you going into the face of
almost certain death; I guess there's nothing left in life for
him."</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded somberly. He motioned to Tim, who came running
back, but stayed at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"Fingers, Jimmy?" he asked, watching warily lest Jimmy
Christopher make a dive for him.</p>

<p>"Fingers, Tim. I guess you stay."</p>

<p>The boy's face lighted up joyfully, and he came closer. "What do
we do now?"</p>

<p>Jimmy glanced questioningly at Z-7. "First of all, we've got to
find a place to hole up in till after the Leopard and his men have
landed. Has Intelligence got any spots around here, that haven't
been destroyed?"</p>

<p>Z-7 shook his head. "You know all the Intelligence addresses as
well as I do, Jimmy. There's nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Operator 5 snapped his fingers. "I've got just the
place! Do you remember the old municipal wine cellars under the
Brooklyn Bridge?"</p>

<p>"They haven't been used for years. Hardly anybody knows about
them. We could hide out in them for years, and nobody would find
us!"</p>

<p>"Wine cellars?" Tim asked. "I never heard of them."</p>

<p>"You've got a lot to learn yet, kid," Jimmy told him.</p>

<p>Z-7's eyes were sparkling. "It's a natural, Jimmy. Maybe we can
recruit a force of men down there. There must be some survivors
wandering about the city, unable to escape. We can move them in
there!"</p>

<p>The three hurried up Broadway, picking their way in the unsure
footing of torn-up asphalt and mangled bodies, debris of buildings
and floating sewage.</p>

<p>Behind them, the first of the Leopard's ships tied up at the
Battery, and a stream of men began to descend. Jimmy Christopher
and his two companions glanced back frequently, watching the
queerly mailed soldiers from Asia set foot on New York ground. In
their van was a huge figure, with a peculiar breastplate of mail,
and a helmet of similar material. In the light of the flares which
illuminated the landing they could see this huge figure strut up
and down while his men disembarked. He carried only a single
weapon&mdash;a huge Chinese broadsword, which the average man would
have required two hands to wield, but which he carried easily in
his right fist.</p>

<p>Z-7 whispered to Jimmy: "The Leopard!" Jimmy Christopher nodded.
He half turned, as if to go back.</p>

<p>"If we could get him now, the whole invasion would fall to
pieces!" But Z-7 laid a restraining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Too late, Jimmy. You could never reach him!"</p>

<p>It was true. The immense figure of the Leopard was now
completely surrounded by a bodyguard of mailed warriors. Other
Asiatic soldiers now descended, wheeling motorcycles. They formed
in a solid phalanx ahead of the bodyguard. And so the procession of
the conquering horde from Asia marched into the wrecked streets of
New York City, while Operator 5, Z-7 and Tim Donovan slunk away

<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX. &mdash; MINUTE MEN OF 1936!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH Manhattan had been turned into a gory
shambles, there were yet many spots between the Battery and Spuyten
Duyvil which had been spared by the screaming barrage. Here and
there, houses stood, untouched. By a peculiar quirk of fate, the
old Sixth Avenue Elevated line between South Ferry and Fifty-third
Street had not been hit in its entire length. The old, rickety
looking structure, which the taxpayers of the city had been
fighting to tear down for years, still stood intact. Along its
entire length the trains of wooden cars remained on the tracks, at
the spots where they had stopped when the power-houses ceased to
function.</p>

<p>And it was to the shelter of these cars that hundreds of
survivors flocked. Men and women without homes, carrying children
in their arms, or lugging some few possessions that they had
managed to salvage, climbed the creaking staircases of the "L"
structure, walked the tracks until they found a car in which there
was room for them.</p>

<p>The biting January winds had caught many without clothes, just
as they had run from their homes. Some had only thin night clothes
to protect them against the bitter winds; and there was none who
had clothing to spare. So they hurried gladly to the comparative
warmth of the elevated cars.</p>

<p>The stations along the line had been improvised into emergency
dressing rooms for the wounded, and here the handful of doctors who
had survived were treating victims of the bombardment as well as
many patients who had been carried from neighboring hospitals.</p>

<p>As well as they could, without leadership, physicians and nurses
had organized a home-made system of relief, scouting among the
wreckage of drug stores for medical supplies, gauze and bandages,
and using whatever came to hand.</p>

<p>During the early morning hours these unselfish doctors and
nurses labored over the sick and wounded, not knowing what their
fate was to be, wondering vaguely in the backs of their minds
whether the conquerors would not come in a little while and undo
with the sword what they had done so well with the implements of
the healing arts.</p>

<p>They were soon to know...</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the first cohorts of the Asiatic army began
their march through Manhattan Island. In their van, strangely, rode
the Leopard himself, in the armored sidecar of a motorcycle. The
streets were impassable to wide-bodied, automobiles, but these
narrow vehicles, which the Asiatic army had used in Russia, were
able to negotiate them with comparative ease, skirting the wide
maws of the shell-holes in the asphalt, sloshing through deep
puddles of sewage. The stench in the city was almost unbearable,
but the Leopard did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>His darting eyes, set deep in his flat head, seemed to look
everywhere at once, as if he were savoring to the full the perfume
of his victory. In spite of the cold, he wore the same breech-clout
that he had worn on the plains of Russia, with the addition of a
glinting metal breastplate, and helmet of the same material. His
arms, thighs and legs were bare, copper-colored, oily. Muscles
bulged on his sinewy body.</p>

<p>Behind him, far down Broadway, was strung out the long line of
motorcycles, and behind the motorcycles came infantry, disembarking
from ship after ship that tied up at the dock.</p>

<p>Lean, wiry, yellow men these, who marched phlegmatically,
stoically, hardly impressed with the sight of the havoc their guns
had wrought. Each motorcycle was armed with a machine-gun cunningly
fastened to the front plate of the side car, so that it could be
swiveled in any direction. The cycles themselves were heavy
machines, with solid tires. The driver was protected by a sort of
shield which was part of the handle-bar, and which came down in
front almost to his knees. It was equipped with slotted holes for
the eyes. The only parts of the driver which were exposed were his
feet.</p>

<p>As the motorcade proceeded up lower Broadway, patrols branched
out from the main column into the side streets wherever they were
passable, and then filtered up the other north-and-south
thoroughfares. Wherever there appeared to be signs of life, the
patrols stopped and investigated...</p>

<p>Whatever unfortunates were found huddled in chance buildings
which had been left standing were immediately seized and searched.
Then, after any valuables in their possession had been taken from
them, they were forced to march north at the double-quick, ahead of
the motorcycles. No words were spoken to them by the little yellow
soldiers, but resistance or objections of any kind insured swift
death.</p>

<p>On the East Side, a patrol found two dozen or so bedraggled men
and women, with two children among them, huddled for shelter in one
of the loading platforms used by the vegetable markets.</p>

<p>The mailed Asiatics descended from the armored cars, swarmed
into the loading platform, and prodded the shivering, frightened
captives out into the raw cold night at the points of their
bayonets.</p>

<p>Several of the women were only half dressed, and the gallant men
had lent them overcoats and other articles of clothing. The
overcoats were ruthlessly stripped from the women, and the rough
hands of the wiry yellow soldiers searched them for valuables.</p>

<p>One of the women, a plump young matron, pretty, with blond hair,
wore only a night dress under the great overcoat which she pressed
about her. She shrank from the brutal soldier who ripped the coat
open, and turned to cling to a tall man who was holding a
curly-headed girl of five by the hand. The little girl was staring
with wide, frightened eyes at the silent soldiers. The tall man put
his free arm about the woman, shouted at the mailed looters: "Damn
you! Take your hands off my wife!"</p>

<p>The soldier grinned wickedly under his helmet, swung his long
rifle down, and without hesitation thrust the bright, glinting
bayonet into the tall man's stomach, twisted it cruelly, and yanked
it out, dripping red.</p>

<p>The tall man screamed, writhing in agony as blood gushed from
him, then he collapsed to the ground, his screams dying to muted
groans. The little girl whose hand he had been holding stood rooted
to the spot, staring with unbelieving eyes at the death throes of
her father, while the woman swiftly knelt, grasped at her husband
with frantic hands. She cradled his head in her arms, let her tears
fall on his face. The wounded man's hands were pressed hard to his
stomach, and they were becoming swiftly wet with his own blood.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the Asiatic patrol were facing the rest of the
group of fugitives, holding their bayonets ready for any further
protests. But the others were too cowed by what had happened to do
anything but stand meekly by. There were six mailed men in that
patrol, under the command of a petty officer. It was the officer
who had stabbed the woman's husband.</p>

<p>Now he bent down, seized her by the shoulder, and dragged her
roughly away from her husband. The man's head fell to the ground as
she was suddenly compelled to release him, while the little girl,
with a sudden cry of anguish, rushed at the officer, beating at him
with her two little fists, and shouting:</p>

<p>"My daddy! You hurt my daddy!"</p>

<p>The Asiatic officer bared his teeth at the child, held the woman
with one hand, and raised his clubbed rifle with the other. In
another instant he would have brought it down on her skull.</p>

<p>It was at that instant that the bark of an automatic sounded at
a little distance behind him. A slug whined through the air,
smashed into the bone of his right wrist, shattered it. The rifle
fell from inert fingers, and he let go of the screaming woman,
gazed stupidly at his bloody hand, which suddenly hung uselessly at
his side.</p>

<p>The five men of his detail swung, startled, in the direction
from which the shot had come. About fifty feet down the street was
a low pile of debris from a shell-torn building, consisting of
bricks and fragments of steel which had fallen athwart the gutter.
Behind this pile of wreckage they saw the head and shoulders of a
young man, attired in a flying suit and helmet. The top of his
leather helmet was stained with clotted blood.</p>

<p>Beside the young man stood a grizzled, older man, and on his
left hand was a boy with a freckled face. All three of them held
automatics.</p>

<p>EVEN as the yellow soldiers raised their rifles, the young man
and his two companions fired again, their automatics spitting flame
at the armored warriors. Lead slugs clanged harmlessly against the
armor of the Asiatics; their breastplates were bullet-proof. The
fusillade did no damage beyond staggering the Asiatics backward,
spoiling their aim with the rifles.</p>

<p>Their first volley went high over the heads of the three behind
the breastwork of debris. The twenty-odd American captives stood
tense with sudden hope as the young man and his two companions
fired again, more carefully from behind their protection.</p>

<p>One of the Asiatic soldiers uttered a scream that ended in a
gurgling whisper, pitched forward with a jagged hole spurting blood
from his throat. Another collapsed on a wounded leg, while a third
was spun about by the force of a bullet through the exposed part of
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The three with the automatics had realized at once that the
armor was not for show, but was truly bullet-proof; and they were
aiming at the exposed parts of the Asiatics.</p>

<p>The wounded officer shouted to the two unwounded soldiers in a
high-pitched, sing-song dialect, and the two dropped to their
knees, took deliberate aim with their rifles. But the young man
behind the debris fired twice quickly, with deadly accuracy, and
caught them both between the eyes before they could shoot.</p>

<p>A glad shout went up from the shivering white captives, and the
Asiatic officer, suddenly gripped with fear, turned to run, holding
his shattered wrist pressed close to his chest. But the little
girl, who had been standing at the side of her dying father, threw
herself at him, clasping his shins in both her frail arms. The
officer went sprawling to the ground, and in a moment the three had
run out from behind the breastworks and leaped upon him.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the four wounded Asiatics were securely tied
with belts and suspenders commandeered from the men among the
fugitives. The young man with the automatic patted the little girl
on the head.</p>

<p>"That was a brave thing you did, young lady," he said.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, smiling through her tears, then glanced at
the trembling form of her mother, leaning over the rigid body of
her father.</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she called in choked voice. "Daddy!"</p>

<p>Gently the young man led her away from the sight. He called over
the freckle-faced boy, who had been busy examining the armor and
weapons of the fallen Asiatics.</p>

<p>"Here's something for you to do, Tim," he said. "Take care of
this young lady. She needs care."</p>

<p>Tim Donovan grimaced, but took over the assignment without other
objection.</p>

<p>Z-7 was talking to the bedraggled fugitives, and Jimmy
Christopher went over to him, said crisply: "I have an idea, Chief.
Let's get all these people into the shelter of the wine cellar.
Have them help to carry the Asiatics in there too. We can use that
armor and those rifles."</p>

<p>He turned to the assembled group. "It's a lucky thing this
happened right around the comer from our hiding place. We heard the
motorcycles, and came out to investigate. Now, if you'll help us
carry these prisoners around the comer, we'll get them in there and
mop up around here, so as not to leave any trace of what's happened
in case another patrol should come along. Then I've got a little
plan to talk over with all of you. I suppose you'd all be willing
to strike a blow against the Leopard?"</p>

<p>The men in the group assured him fervently that they would. The
wife of the man who had been bayoneted came over, pressing the
overcoat about her, her eyes shining with a fanatic glow.</p>

<p>"I'll help," she said. "They killed my husband."</p>

<p>The statement was a simple one, and she said it without any
great show of emotion. But Jimmy Christopher could detect the taut
hate behind her eyes.</p>

<p>"You shall have your chance, madam," he promised. "Meanwhile,
you can help best by taking care of your little girl." He motioned
to Tim Donovan, who led the child over, gave her into the custody
of her mother.</p>

<p>IT was the work of only a short while for the men and women of
that group to carry the wounded Asiatic soldiers around the comer,
and to dispose of the body of the dead father and the two yellow
soldiers whom Jimmy had shot between the eyes. Soon there was
nothing to show that anything had happened at this spot except for
several dull, reddish stains in the gutter.</p>

<p>Around the corner was the entrance to the old wine cellars.
Above them loomed the wrecked structure of the Brooklyn Bridge,
with long shanks of steel hanging from the splintered framework.
All about them were the torn and twisted bodies of civilians who
had died during the bombardment, half covered by debris from the
destroyed bridge.</p>

<p>Through all this wreckage Jimmy Christopher led the way to a
shattered subway kiosk. Picking his way through twisted steel, he
found the staircase leading down into the subway station. Behind
him came a procession of bedraggled men and women, carrying the
wounded Asiatics. Into the eyes of these people had come a new
light of hope. Jimmy's quiet, efficient manner, his crisp, quick
decisiveness, had imbued them with fresh courage.</p>

<p>At the end of the procession, Z-7 and Tim Donovan, with one of
the men from the fugitive group, wheeled the three motorcycles.
Quietly, silently, the whole company disappeared within the kiosk.
Under the ground, about a hundred feet up the subway track, there
was a wall opening in the tunnel, which led directly into the old
wine cellars. Here there was refuge from the merciless Asiatic
hordes who patrolled the streets above.</p>

<p>No sounds entered these deep caverns from above, and the air was
musty, stagnant. Candles guttered in one corner, and provisions of
every description, which Jimmy Christopher, Z-7 and Tim had foraged
early that morning were piled high. There were tins of canned
salmon, canned corned beef, canned milk and fruit juices, as well
as boxes of crackers and stores of other groceries.</p>

<p>Beside them, Operator 5 had knocked together a rude wooden table
upon which he had placed electrical materials picked out of a
wrecked wholesale warehouse. He and Tim were working on the
construction of a wireless sending equipment with which to
communicate with General Falk and the outside world.</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled as he saw the expressions of astonishment and
pleasure on the faces of the refugees.</p>

<p>"If you ladies," he suggested gaily, "will go to work on the
groceries, you may be able to scare up a meal for all of us. If
you're as hungry as I am, those cans ought to go fast."</p>

<p>The women welcomed the chance to do something that would take
their minds from the tragedy of the sacked city, and they were soon
busying themselves with can-openers, chatting animatedly among
themselves.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher drew the men of the group to one side, and
while Tim Donovan and Z-7 listened, he spoke swiftly, keeping one
eye on the three Asiatic captives, whose wounds were being tended
by some of the other women.</p>

<p>"You men are going to be the nucleus of the fight to drive the
Leopard from the city and from the country," he told them. "We'll
use this place as headquarters, and we'll go about the city in
search of more refugees and of weapons to arm them with. Wherever
you find white men and women in hiding, you will try to guide them
here in safety. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," one of the men interrupted. "How are we going
to go around the city, without being caught by these Asiatics? The
minute we walk out&mdash;even if it's at night we'll be
spotted!"</p>

<p>"We're going to minimize that chance," Jimmy told him grimly.
"We'll go out only at night, as you say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they'll have flares up. They'll be able to tell us from
their&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No they won't. Tonight, only six of us will go out. We'll be
dressed just like them! There's complete equipment for six of us on
the captured soldiers&mdash;even including the motorcycles. We'll
be an Asiatic patrol!"</p>

<p>The boldness of Jimmy Christopher's proposal stunned his
listeners for a moment. There were fifteen men in that group. Some
of them were downtown business employees&mdash;insurance agents,
bank tellers, stockbrokers' clerks.</p>

<p>Others were husky laborers from the fruit markets, and petty
East Side gangsters. Two or three were fairly prosperous business
men from other sections of the city, who had been caught in
restaurants with their wives and children by the sudden
bombardment. All of them, Jimmy Christopher knew, were exempt from
military service either by reason of some physical disability such
as heart trouble or defective eyesight, or by reason of employment
in an industry necessary to the conduct of the war. The trenches in
Europe had already claimed the best of American manhood, and these
were but pitiable tools with which to work.</p>

<p>Yet he saw by the eagerness which grew in their eyes as the
possibilities of his plan opened up before them, that they would
work with him to the limit. All nationalities were represented in
this group&mdash;they were men whose parents or grandparents or
great-grandparents had come from the four corners of the earth. But
they were Americans. Theirs was the stock which had brought the
country to the pinnacle of its power; and when catastrophe
threatened, they would fight to the last breath in their body.</p>

<p>A quick murmur of enthusiasm ran through the crowd. They
surrounded Jimmy, throwing questions at him, each volunteering to
be among the first six to man the motorcycles that night.</p>

<p>Operator 5 ran his eye over them, and selected four
likely-looking men.</p>

<p>None of them knew who he was, but they all were ready to trust
themselves to his leadership. The four men selected grinned with
pride at being chosen.</p>

<p>Jimmy detailed others to the task of stripping the armor and
weapons from the dead and wounded Asiatics. Then he took a census
of the weapons in the possession of the group, and found that there
was only one revolver among them all.</p>

<p>The man who owned the revolver, he stationed at the foot of the
subway stairs, with instructions to keep a lookout there. The
possibility of discovery was very slight; but, like a good general,
Jimmy guarded against it.</p>

<p>Then he drew aside the four men he had selected, and spoke to
them in low tones.</p>

<p>"We'll start tonight, as soon as it gets dark. I'll drive one
motorcycle, and this gentleman&mdash;" he nodded toward
Z-7&mdash;"whom you can call Mr. Smith, will drive another. You,
Green&mdash;" he addressed one of the four, a stocky man of forty
who was clad in the greasy overalls of a mechanic, and who knew all
about motorcycles will drive the third. "You three&mdash;Hadley,
Cohen and O'Ryan&mdash;will man the side cars and use the machine
guns in case we get in a jam. Mr. Smith and I will show you how
they work before we leave. Our object&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan, who had been listening on the fringe of the group,
broke in heatedly:</p>

<p>"Hey, Jimmy! Where do I come in on this? Why can't I drive the
third motorcycle? I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You stay here, Tim!" Jimmy told him sternly, pointing at the
pile of electrical supplies. "Your job is to build a sending set
before morning. You've got everything you need right there, and
it's vital that we have some means of communicating with General
Falk."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Tim, but the answer is nix!"</p>

<p>Tim Donovan made a wry face, but refrained from further protest.
He realized the importance of building a sending set, and he knew
that he was probably the only one there, outside of Jimmy
Christopher himself, who could do it. Many times he had puttered
about in the laboratory which Jimmy maintained at his father's
house, and he had taken a keen interest in wireless, learning
everything that Jimmy tried to teach him. Though he was barely out
of his middle teens, his fund of information on many subjects was
equivalent to that of an expert.</p>

<p>"Okay, Jimmy," he said. "I'll get to work."</p>

<p>He left the group, and Operator 5 went on with his instructions.
"Our object will be to cruise the city, avoiding large Asiatic
patrols if possible. We will try to locate as many refugees as we
can, and direct them to this place. If we should meet any isolated
motorcycles, we will try to capture them, and thus increase our
strength. We will always cruise together; if we should be
recognized and chased by a superior force, we will separate, and
return here by different routes, singly. In that way, the chances
of all of us being caught will be reduced. Under no circumstances
is any of you to come back here unless you're absolutely certain
that you have shaken off pursuit. This place must remain a
secret!"</p>

<p>As he finished issuing his instructions, one of the women came
over, smiling, to inform them that dinner was served.</p>

<p>The whole tone of the group was different now from what it had
been an hour before. Their spirits were soaring with the prospect
of action.</p>

<p>And one of the men, raising his improvised cup, offered a
toast:</p>

<p>"Here's to us&mdash;the Minute Men of 1936!"</p>

<p>A low shout went up from all of them, and the cups were drained.
Eyes glowed, talk bubbled. The spirit of 1776 was rumbling through
the vaulted spaces of the old wine cellar!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X. &mdash; TOWERS OF TERROR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE disembarking of the hordes of Asiatic troops
took most of the morning. While it went on, the Leopard pushed up
as far as Thirty-fourth Street. Here he found the Sixty-ninth
Regiment Armory standing undamaged, and he made it his
headquarters.</p>

<p>On the way up town, the yellow soldiers had rounded up several
hundred homeless refugees, driving them from "L" stations and other
places where they had hidden.</p>

<p>When the long column of mailed troops halted at noon time, the
captives were forced to cook for the soldiers, in the improvised
kitchens set up in the streets. Others were made to wait on the
invaders. At the least sign of unwillingness, at the slightest
mistake, death came painfully&mdash;by means of a bayonet in the
stomach. The iron heel of the conqueror was making itself felt.</p>

<p>Down at the docks, the captured seamen and marines from the
thirty-odd American ships which had surrendered, were compelled to
unload large square plates of metal, of material similar to that of
the armor the yellow soldiers wore. After the metal plates came
heavy crates of mysterious machinery. All of this had to be hauled
through the streets to the Leopard's headquarters and since it was
impossible for trucks to drive through the shell-torn
thoroughfares, the prisoners were pressed into service as beasts of
burden. And if a man dropped and could not rise again, he met a
lingering, painful death.</p>

<p>At last, the machinery reached Thirty-fourth Street, but the
prisoners were given no respite. They were at once set to work at
putting together the plates, fastening them with heavy threaded
bolts which fitted into slots in the metal. Others were ordered to
unpack the crates of machinery.</p>

<p>Supervising all the work was a wizened, wrinkle-faced Chinese,
whom the yellow officers addressed as Doctor Fu. So hard did Doctor
Fu drive the conscript labor, that within two hours the work was
completed, and there stood, in the street before the armory, a
tall, square tower, with loopholes through which projected
long-barreled objects resembling guns.</p>

<p>The prisoners could guess, however, that these were not ordinary
guns, for instead of having breeches which could be loaded, there
was merely a long piston-like ramrod, worked by a lever. At a shift
of the lever, the ramrod could drive into the long barrel of the
tube. Just within that tube, where the ramrod struck, was a chamber
containing powder, and an aluminum ball about six inches in
diameter. These balls were apparently hollow, for they weighed
almost nothing.</p>

<p>It was shortly after noon that the first counter-attack against
the invaders was launched by the United States forces under General
Falk. It took the shape of a small flotilla of airplanes which flew
over Manhattan Island, reconnoitering.</p>

<p>From outside, in the street, the prisoners watched the droning
planes overhead, almost hoping that the aviators would drop heavy
explosives upon them and though ending their own misery, wipe out
these yellow warriors who were a grisly threat against American
ideals and liberty. Manhattan Island was a shambles anyway; an air
bombardment could not do much further damage, and it would destroy
most of the Asiatic troops massed in the streets.</p>

<p>But no bombs were dropped...</p>

<p>FOR suddenly, while the planes were still north of Manhattan,
the long tubes in the tower began to belch flame as they were
fired. The aluminum balls were catapulted upward at amazing
velocity, bursting among the planes.</p>

<p>And abruptly, though no direct hits had been scored, the pilots
seemed to lose control of their machines. Formations broke. Wings
grazed, and ships crashed.</p>

<p>Those planes which were not destroyed at once turned tail and
fled. It was the last air attack attempted by the beleaguered
United States forces.</p>

<p>But the long guns in the metal tower did not cease firing. The
American captives, watching with sinking hearts, saw that the
elevation of the muzzles was being changed, saw a second tier of
guns in the tower, longer than the first, swing into action.</p>

<p>And then they saw a part of the Asiatic column start to move
northward again. Motorcycles barked and stuttered as rank upon rank
of yellow troops swung into motion, drove past them.</p>

<p>They saw the Leopard standing in the entrance of the armory,
watching his hordes move on to the attack. There were among them
many who would gladly have leaped upon that figure if they had
possessed a weapon of any sort. But they had been stripped of
everything in their possession; and, moreover, a double rank of
mailed warriors was lined up between them and the coolie
conqueror.</p>

<p>Black anger suddenly shone in the eyes of the prisoners, as they
saw a dapper figure in naval officer's uniform come out of the
armory and join the Leopard. Some of them knew that man. It was
Lieutenant Earl Ward.</p>

<p>Ward spoke a few words respectfully to the Leopard, who grinned
wolfishly, nodded, and reentered the armory, with the American
lieutenant trailing him.</p>

<p>Murmurs ran among the captives. They all wore hangdog, ashamed
expressions. They could not understand what had happened to them
aboard their ships. They could not understand now why they had,
abruptly hauled down their flags, meekly surrendered to the enemy
more than thirty first-class fighting ships, all superbly equipped.
They only knew that they had done a shameful thing, and they burned
to vindicate themselves.</p>

<p>But their captors seemed to understand their mood completely,
and they were given no opportunity to attempt anything. They were
ringed by a circle of glittering steel bayonets in the hands of
merciless yellow soldiers who did not hesitate to use them.</p>

<p>Now a little food was passed among them, the remains of the
repast of the Asiatic troops. And then they were once more put to
work.</p>

<p>More plates were fastened together, more machinery lifted into
place by the labor of their sweating backs. But this time, the
tower which they constructed was built upon a platform of steel
which in turn rested on wheels. It was a mobile fort.</p>

<p>They were driven to their task as long as daylight lasted, and
by the time night had fallen, the moving tower was complete. Then
they were allowed to sleep&mdash;out in the street, wherever they
dropped, too weary from exhaustion to quibble at the hardness of
their bed, or at their lack of covering...</p>

<p>In the mean time, the word had flashed over the entire United
States that New York was destroyed. The country was in a panic of
excitement. Criticism of the General Staff, of the Secretary of
War, of the President, was rife.</p>

<p>Washington was a beehive of feverish activity. Orders crackled
over the wires across the length and breadth of the country. In
every training camp in the East, raw, untrained men were rushed
into trains and motor trucks, headed for New York.</p>

<p>General Falk, who had recovered consciousness from Jimmy
Christopher's blow, was once more his old dynamic self. From his
headquarters at White Plains he ordered the disposition of all the
American troops available. Almost a hundred thousand men were
strung out across Westchester County in New York, and across Bergen
and Essex Counties in New Jersey. These men were not the highly
trained troops which the United States had sent to Europe, but they
were far more eager to fight&mdash;because this was really a war
for the protection of their homeland.</p>

<p>With a shrewd eye to a pitched battle, Falk had concentrated the
bulk of his force around Kensico Dam, as he had told Jimmy he would
do. The terrain here was ideal for defense, and there was not much
doubt in General Falk's mind that he would be able to stem the
advance of the Asiatic horde. All of southern Westchester County
had been evacuated up to White Plains. Supplies of every kind had
been withdrawn. Throughout the day, huge trucks, driven by
volunteer civilians, had removed from that section all the food and
useful supplies which could be found. Stores and warehouses were
emptied.</p>

<p>When the invader marched north from New York, he would find
nothing to eat. Heavy cannons were being moved into place which
would lay down a devastating barrage. Forts Slocum and Schuyler
were crammed with ammunition for their big guns, ready to join the
barrage at the zero hour. And the zero hour would be, according to
Falk's plan, when the Asiatic troops reached Yonkers and Mount
Vernon. He was prepared to sacrifice those towns
deliberately&mdash;to wipe them from the map&mdash;and with them,
the handful of yellow invaders from the East.</p>

<p>As a feeler, he ordered four squadrons of planes into the air,
to observe the movements of the enemy in Manhattan. From the roof
of the County Building in White Plains he watched the flight of
those squadrons, watched them destroy themselves just as the naval
planes had done the day before.</p>

<p>He waited in vain for a single plane to return-to report exactly
what had happened. None returned. But he heard the dull booming
reports of guns from New York City. He didn't know about the metal
tower.</p>

<p>Suddenly, all the snap and pep went out of him. The same uncanny
power which had made Winston surrender, was reaching out for the
peppery old Chief of Staff. With sagging shoulders, Falk descended
from the roof, made his way to a room in the County Building where
a telegraph operator sat at a key, alertly waiting.</p>

<p>"Have you picked up anything from Operator 5 yet?" Falk asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>The telegraph operator shook his head.</p>

<p>"Watch for his code signal," Falk ordered. "If he isn't dead
yet, he'll manage to communicate with us somehow. He is our only
hope!"</p>

<p>He went into his own office to report by telephone to
Washington. His report was never given out to the press...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE LEOPARD HOLDS
COURT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN New York City, in the armory on Thirty-fourth
Street, the Leopard was holding court. He sat at the desk of the
former commanding officer of the armory, which had been hauled out
of the office into the large assembly room. Light from dozens of
tapers fell on the Leopard's brutish, powerful face.</p>

<p>He was well satisfied with himself and with the progress of the
invasion. As he sat there, runners entered every few minutes, to I
report further advances of the mailed troops into Westchester.</p>

<p>One messenger entered, breathless, saluted, and spoke swiftly:
"Master, Colonel Dato reports complete victory. The American troops
encamped around the dam at Kensico are in flight. The Colonel bid
me tell you that he used Doctor Fu's magic which is shot from the
towers. Thousands of them were easily slaughtered, and General
Falk, who commanded them, has been captured. He is being sent here
to grace one of your cages!"</p>

<p>The Leopard smiled, and waved to the runner. "Go and eat," he
ordered. "Then rest. You have done well."</p>

<p>He turned to the parchment-faced, shriveled old Doctor Fu, who
sat at his right, clad in a silk jacket and skull cap. He nodded in
satisfaction. "The country is ours," he said. "They cannot stand
against the magic of your science, Fu."</p>

<p>The wizened old doctor made no reply, merely smiled tightly.</p>

<p>The Leopard glanced up at the man who stood at his left. This
man still wore the uniform of a naval lieutenant in the United
States Navy. He was Earl Ward. "Now, Ward," said the Leopard, "we
can question these prisoners." He glanced at a row of a dozen
captives facing the desk, under guard of a file of Asiatic soldiers
with fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>"You will be my interpreter," he told the lieutenant. Ward
smirked, and bowed...</p>

<p>Among the prisoners was Admiral Stanley Winston. The admiral's
face was haggard, his eyes filled with misery at the thing he had
done. He stood erect, shoulders back, facing the desk. And his eyes
never left the face of Lieutenant Earl Ward.</p>

<p>Also in the line of captives was a gray-haired man with a
bandaged head, and a chestnut-haired, blue-eyed girl, who
solicitously supported the gray-haired man, with an arm about his
shoulders. The man reached up and gently removed the girl's arm
from about his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Diane," he said softly. "I'm not an invalid any
more. I can stand without help."</p>

<p>Diane's troubled eyes swung to glance at him sideways as she
stood in the line facing the giant Leopard. "Don't exert yourself
too much, dad," she whispered. "That wound in your head isn't
healed yet." Her tone changed quickly to one of worry. "I
wonder&mdash;" her voice dropped an octave lower&mdash;"if Katerina
will be safe where we hid her." She shuddered. "I hate to think of
her fate if the Leopard's men should find her while they're
patrolling."</p>

<p>"Shhh!" Jimmy's father cautioned her. His eyes were on the
Leopard, who had raised his coarse face, whispered something to
Ward.</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded servilely, and pointed at Admiral Winston,
whose uniform was bedraggled, clotted with dirt and mud, so that it
was hard to determine his rank.</p>

<p>Two Asiatic soldiers stepped up behind him at a gruff order from
the Leopard, seized the Admiral by the arms, and pushed him forward
toward the desk.</p>

<p>The Leopard whispered a question to Ward, who interpreted it to
Winston.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where Operator 5 could have gone to after he
escaped from the Dakota?"</p>

<p>Winston's gaze burned into the face of his treacherous former
assistant. His voice came hoarsely, huskily, filled with
emotion.</p>

<p>"You Judas! You put some sort of drug in my coffee! Tell that
dirty coolie emperor of yours that he better look out&mdash;you may
do the same for him some day, if he trusts you the way I did!"</p>

<p>Ward's eyes lowered before the accusing glance of his former
chief. He bit his lip, said: "Answer my question!"</p>

<p>"Go to hell!" exclaimed Admiral Winston. The lieutenant
hesitated a moment, then bent and spoke in the Leopard's ear. The
big coolie bared his stained teeth in a snarl, spoke quickly,
angrily. Ward smiled thinly, straightened, and interpreted the
Leopard's words with vicious vindictiveness. "The emperor says that
he is sparing you now only because of your rank. He likes to
collect ex-generals, ex-kings, ex-dukes and ex-admirals of the
countries he conquers. He keeps them in small steel cages, where
they cannot stand up, but must remain perpetually in a crouching
position. He has eleven such cages on board one of the ships in the
harbor. In those cages he has a Manchukuan emperor, two Russian
commissars, and the president of Finland. He instructs me to tell
you that you are to join that noble collection of his. After a
while, you will forget all about your pride, and beg for something
to eat every day when the keeper comes around with food!"</p>

<p>Winston paled, and his hands clenched at his sides. But he said
nothing. At an imperious motion from the Leopard, the two soldiers
who held him dragged him from the room.</p>

<p>Two more soldiers stepped up, and pushed forward the next in
line of captives. This was a huge, bearded man, with a thick, bull
neck, and shoulders whose corded muscles rippled across his
shoulders, under his coat.</p>

<p>Ward asked him a number of questions which apparently were
routine, and which were asked of each prisoner. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>The man's thick eyebrows came together as he frowned, and
answered reluctantly: "John Shoomacher."</p>

<p>"What is your occupation?"</p>

<p>"I'm a professional wrestler."</p>

<p>Ward smiled, stooped and interpreted to the Leopard, whose eyes
gleamed wickedly, sizing up the captive. The emperor turned to the
silent Doctor Fu, at his left, and spoke to him in Cantonese. "This
man looks very powerful, Fu."</p>

<p>The wizened Chinese doctor bobbed his head. "I am sure he is not
as strong as the Leopard!"</p>

<p>Ward was proceeding with the usual questions.</p>

<p>"The emperor is very anxious to find three people who were here
in New York when the bombardment started. If you can give him any
information about them, your life will be spared, and you will be
given a handsome reward. These people were a very fat man named
Dmitri Osman, a woman named Lina Cavelli, and a beautiful Russian
girl by the name of Katerina Saratoff. Have you ever heard those
names?"</p>

<p>John Shoomacher glared at Ward from under his thick eyebrows. He
growled: "I want none of your rewards. I wouldn't tell you if I
knew. And what that Admiral said to you goes for me too. You can go
to hell, you Judas!"</p>

<p>Ward shrugged, and interpreted.</p>

<p>The Leopard's eyes blazed. He turned to Doctor Fu, spoke again
in Cantonese, his voice rising uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"Fu, I must find Katerina Saratoff! From the moment when I first
set eyes upon her, I knew that she was the woman to grace the
Leopard's throne&mdash;a fitting companion for the conqueror of the
world. I must have her, Fu! I would give up half of my conquests to
have her!"</p>

<p>In the line of captives, the eyes of old John Christopher
flickered slightly as he listened. But his face betrayed nothing.
He understood Cantonese, could talk it as well&mdash;better,
perhaps, than the ignorant coolie who sat behind that desk. In his
youth he had served as an American Intelligence officer in Peiping
during the Boxer Rebellion, and had been assigned to the Far East
for five years after that. He spoke half a dozen Asiatic dialects
like a native, and it was he who had schooled his son, Operator 5,
in those same languages when Jimmy Christopher was assigned to the
same station which his father had covered thirty years before.
Jimmy himself had spent a good deal of time in the Orient, and
often in their leisure, father and son would converse in Chinese,
switching from one dialect to another, in order to keep in
practice.</p>

<p>Now, John Christopher understood the passion that drove the
Leopard to search for Katerina Saratoff. This wharf-rat, this
coolie who had risen from the slum quarter of Hong Kong to be the
dictator of all Asia, and the potential conqueror of the world, had
fallen blindly in love with the beautiful, patrician daughter of
Russian nobility. And he would never rest until he had found
her.</p>

<p>But John Christopher's thoughts were dragged away from the
subject of Katerina, as he noted the thing that was occurring now.
The Leopard had spoken swiftly to Ward, while John Shoomacher, the
wrestler, fidgeted from one foot to the other, already regretting
the lack of restraint with which he had defied the emperor.</p>

<p>Ward listened intently, nodding appreciatively, then translated
to Shoomacher: "The emperor wishes to know whether you think you
can beat him in a hand-to-hand fight."</p>

<p>A slow smile spread over the wrestler's not-too-intelligent
features. His eyes traveled over the well-muscled body of the
Leopard and Shoomacher's chest expanded with confidence. "I hope to
tell you I can. I could lick him easy. I bet I could pin him to the
floor in five minutes." Ward smiled in smug satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The Leopard will give you a chance for your life. If you beat
him, you go free!"</p>

<p>The Leopard arose from behind his desk, and walked around in
front, stripping off his armor. He stood there, mighty muscles
rippling smoothly, dressed only in his breech-clout.</p>

<p>At a wave of his hand, the yellow soldiers pressed the other
prisoners back out of the way, so that a space was cleared around
the two men.</p>

<p>Shoomacher eagerly removed his coat and shirt, flexed his
muscles, and grinned at the emperor.</p>

<p>The Leopard nodded to Ward, who snapped "Begin!"</p>

<p>Shoomacher fell into a crouch, warily circled the emperor, hands
hanging loose at his sides, thick stubby fingers spread to seize a
grip.</p>

<p>The Leopard stood erect, turning slowly as the professional
wrestler moved around him. His slanting eyes never left the eyes of
Shoomacher.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wrestler lowered his head, dove straight at the
emperor's stomach. The coolie did not move by so much as an inch,
but his body tautened to receive the shock of the impact.</p>

<p>There was a dull thud as Shoomacher's head smacked into the
abdomen of the emperor with all the weight of the heavy wrestler's
body behind the lunge.</p>

<p>The Leopard merely grunted, and his two arms went about
Shoomacher's middle and lifted the heavy man into the air as if he
were a child. Then the emperor's arms contracted slowly, squeezing,
squeezing, while Shoomacher's arms and legs threshed futilely in
the air. The pressure against the wrestler's stomach must have been
terrific, for suddenly the breath was expelled from his body in a
long, agonized whistle. For a moment, his arms and legs ceased to
move, and in that moment, the Leopard, with a cruel, set smile on
his copper features, swung the wrestler upright, keeping one arm
around his waist while he pressed with his left hand against the
helpless man's chin.</p>

<p>Shoomacher's feet wriggled helplessly under that murderous
pressure, then hung limp. His head was pushed far back, his spine
was arched at an almost impossible angle. Beads of sweat gleamed on
his forehead, and his eyes rolled in uncontrollable terror.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sickening, crunching snap, and Shoomacher
uttered a gurgling shriek that died in his throat.</p>

<p>His body went limp. His spine was broken.</p>

<p>The Leopard let him drop carelessly to the floor, where he lay,
a sprawled, broken, inert completely pitiable figure.</p>

<p>Doctor Fu, who had sat calmly through the spectacle, nodded
benevolently, went through the motions of shaking hands with
himself. "An interesting exhibition," he murmured.</p>

<p>The emperor laughed deep in his throat. "The Leopard," he said,
"has yet to meet the man he cannot break!"</p>

<p>He waved carelessly, and two soldiers stepped forward, picked up
the still living body of the broken wrestler, carried him to the
door.</p>

<p>"Let him lie outside," the coolie emperor ordered. "He will have
time to think about the fight before he dies!"</p>

<p>Unconcernedly, he buckled his armor on once more. Then he
stepped behind his desk, sat down with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>"In accordance with my oath," he said to Doctor Fu, "I will
break the back of one man every day until I find Katerina
Saratoff!" He motioned to Ward. "Go on with the questioning of the
prisoners!"</p>

<p>John Christopher was next in line, and he was pushed roughly
forward by the guards while Diane watched with anxious eyes, her
stomach still churning after the sight of the wrestler's broken
body.</p>

<p>The Leopard's slant eyes studied the brave, dignified bearing of
John Christopher. His lips were drawn back in a half snarl. For he
recognized in the quiet fearlessness of the old man the same spirit
of indomitable courage that he had found in other white
men&mdash;like Feodor Saratoff. And it angered this coolie
wharf-rat that he could not break the spirit of such men by
torturing their bodies. Innately, he knew that men such as these
were superior to himself; and the knowledge produced an
ungovernable rage within him, drove him to fiendish, gruesome
tortures.</p>

<p>Now, as he gazed upon Q-6, Ward bent close to him, whispering
excitedly in wretched Cantonese: "I know that man! He is the father
of him whom you seek. I failed to notice him in the line with the
other prisoners. But now I know him. He is the father of Operator
5!"</p>

<p>The Leopard stiffened, threw a triumphant side glance at Doctor
Fu, who smiled benignly.</p>

<p>"You are very sure?" the Leopard asked softly.</p>

<p>"Positively!" Ward said.</p>

<p>"That is well. For this day's work you may ask me for anything
you wish!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, master," Ward murmured.</p>

<p>The Leopard kept his eyes fixed on Q-6. "Play with him a while,"
he instructed his interpreter. "Let him think we do not know him. I
wish to watch how he acts."</p>

<p>Ward nodded, was about to address John Christopher, when the old
man spoke loudly, clearly, in flowing Mandarin&mdash;a tongue which
neither Ward nor the Leopard understood. He seemed to be speaking
to the emperor, for he gazed directly at him But it was the wizened
Doctor Fu who started in his seat at the first sound of the noble
language which he had not heard spoken in years. And John
Christopher was speaking to Doctor Fu, though he looked at the
Leopard. He used the bombastic, rounded sentences of the old
Chinese court, where learned conversation in stilted phrases had
been the popular pastime for centuries before China passed into the
hands of war-lords and bandits.</p>

<p>"A learned man," he said. "A noble descendant of the House of
Han. Are you, too, one of those who has stepped into the gutter to
serve a rat of the T'angs who has raised his head from the filth of
those whom you once scorned? And do you so soon forget your
friends? Do you not recall the days when the Manchu emperor
glittered in brocade and silk among his sparkling courtiers in the
court at Peiping? I was there, my friend, you were there. You were
the court astrologer, but you were also a man of science, widely
read, and replete with knowledge. Do you not recall the service I
did you when the emperor was angry with you, and ordered you
beheaded? I saved you then. I call upon you now to pay your
debt!"</p>

<p>There was no expression on the face of the Chinese scientist,
but his narrow, watery eyes blinked a little.</p>

<p>The Leopard frowned, glanced up at Ward, then turned to Doctor
Fu. "He speaks in Mandarin, does he not?" the emperor asked, in
Cantonese.</p>

<p>Fu nodded. "He is a master of the noble language of the
scholars."</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"He says," Fu lied, "that he is a man of honor, and he knows
that you are aware of his identity."</p>

<p>"Does he speak Cantonese?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. He has lived much in the East, he says, and speaks
many languages."</p>

<p>"Then I will speak with him!" The Leopard addressed John
Christopher. "Man, you are the father of him to whom Katerina
Saratoff came, sent by her brother. I must know where she is. You
will tell me&mdash;or you will scream for a quick death!"</p>

<p>John Christopher smiled. "You are wrong," he said quietly. "I
will neither talk, nor will I scream."</p>

<p>The Leopard half rose in his seat, his face livid. "Three inches
of bayonet in your groin will make you sing a different song!" He
raised his hand to a guard. "The bayonet! But be careful not to
pierce a vital organ! Twist it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as Doctor Fu laid a hand on his arm. "Wait!"
commanded the old doctor.</p>

<p>The Leopard turned on him questioningly. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I have served you well, have I not, Leopard? I have given into
your hands the weapon which defeats your enemies before they strike
a blow, have I not?"</p>

<p>The emperor frowned. "You have. It is true. But why do you speak
of it now? Your rewards shall be great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have never asked a favor of you before. I ask one now."</p>

<p>"Name it!"</p>

<p>"I ask for the life of this man!"</p>

<p>"What? You are mad, Fu! He knows where Katerina Saratoff is. I
must make him speak&mdash;if I cut him to bits!"</p>

<p>"I ask you for his life," Fu persisted. "Will you grant it if I
tell you another way to make him speak?"</p>

<p>"Another way? You mean the way you made Feodor Saratoff
speak?"</p>

<p>"No, I have no more of the fluid in the vial. The way I will
show you is much surer." The Leopard glanced at the skinny doctor
suspiciously, but he nodded.</p>

<p>"How?" Fu pointed a long, crooked finger at Diane Elliot, who
was standing in line with the other captives.</p>

<p>"That girl, I observed her before. She is very close to this
man. I noted from the way he talked to her that he loves her almost
as a father. If you will but turn the bayonet on her, I am sure he
will speak&mdash;" John Christopher had heard every word of what
the doctor had said. He broke in hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Fu! You are a devil! You have violated the memory of your
ancestors! You have betrayed one who did you a great
service&mdash;" Doctor Fu shrugged.</p>

<p>"I have paid my debt. I owed you a life, and I have given it to
you. The debt does not extend to this girl; she was not even in the
world when I knew you in Peiping!" Q-6 stood, speechless at the
logic of the Chinese scientist. It was the Eastern fatalism, the
disregard for human beings as such. Fu did not consider the agony
of soul that he was inflicting on John Christopher. He was paying
his debt to the letter. At a swift order from the vilely grinning
Leopard, two guards seized Diane, while a third leveled a bayonet
at her stomach. She attempted to struggle in their grip, but was
helpless.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>John Christopher cried out: "Wait! Wait! You must not do that! I
know nothing of my son's whereabouts!"</p>

<p>"I do not ask you that," the Leopard said. "I ask you where I
can find Katerina Saratoff. If you know, you will talk. If you do
not know, then it is too bad; for you will witness the
disemboweling of this beautiful young lady whom you love more than
yourself!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII. &mdash; RAID ON THE LEOPARD'S
DEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THREE armored motorcycles chugged north on Fifth
Avenue. Their spotlights lanced long furrows up the street ahead,
limning the deep pits where shells had gouged out the concrete.</p>

<p>They proceeded slowly, like the other patrols of Asiatic troops
in the conquered city. But the occupants of those cycles were not
Asiatics. In the driver's seat of the leading machine sat Jimmy
Christopher, and beside him, in the side car was a young American
by the name of Max Cohen. The second cycle was manned by Z-7 and
Bert Hadley, while in the third rode Joe Green, with Pat O'Ryan at
the machine gun.</p>

<p>Minute Men. They were casting their lives upon the gaming table
of fate as the stakes in a desperate game to learn the secret of
the Leopard's power. Earlier that evening, Jimmy Christopher and
Max Cohen had reconnoitered the enemy's position, learned that he
had established headquarters at the armory. Now they were going to
try getting inside.</p>

<p>Tim Donovan had succeeded in establishing contact by wireless
with the main body of United States troops at Kensico under General
Falk; and the newly raised hopes of the refugees in the old wine
cellar had been dashed at the news of Falk's capture and the
precipitate route of the American forces.</p>

<p>Now it became imperative to pierce the enemy's stronghold and
try to wrest his secret from him. The faces of all six men were
grim, tight. Several times they passed other patrols, and slowed
up, while Jimmy, carefully keeping his face in the shadow, had
carried on a short conversation with the Asiatic soldiers in
Cantonese. If there was a diversity of accent, it was not noticed,
for these soldiers of the Leopard were recruited from every part of
the Orient, and there were many dialects and many accents among
them. Cantonese seemed to have been adopted as their official
language.</p>

<p>From these conversations, Jimmy Christopher learned that the
Leopard was questioning prisoners himself, in an effort to find if
anyone had seen or heard of Katerina Saratoff. He also learned that
every patrol had been charged with the task of finding her, and
that a princely reward would be paid to the motorcycle team that
was successful.</p>

<p>At Thirty-fourth Street the small cavalcade turned east, pulled
up at a side entrance of the armory. It was quite dark here, and
Jimmy felt that they could risk showing themselves. The only thing
that could betray them was a glimpse of their faces, which were
distinctly not Asiatic, but the helmets afforded them some security
from that danger.</p>

<p>At a signal from Operator 5, they all dismounted, approached the
entrance.</p>

<p>Two guards were stationed here, and dozens of yellow soldiers
swaggered about. Across the street, hundreds of captives, men and
women, were huddled in a close group, resting on the hard concrete,
while guards watched them with rifles ready. These prisoners had
labored until every muscle of their bodies ached. Now they were
waiting to be questioned.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher marched to the doorway of the armory at the
head of his small company, striding boldly as if he had business
inside. The guard, recognizing the insignia of a petty officer on
his breastplate, saluted, and stood aside.</p>

<p>Numerous yellow soldiers were moving about within, bent on
various missions. The six Americans made their way along a
corridor, turned left toward the main assembly room. Suddenly,
Operator 5 stopped stock still, his face set and cold. His eyes had
met the eyes of another man who was being marched out of the
assembly room between two soldiers! They recognized each
other...</p>

<p>It was Admiral Stanley Winston, being taken from the presence of
the Leopard. Winston half-opened his mouth to utter an exclamation,
then shut it again.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher whispered to the others: "After them boys! But
take it easy. And keep your heads down!"</p>

<p>They followed Winston and his two guards to the other end of the
armory, and down a flight of stairs. The two guards paid no
attention.</p>

<p>Down below were the detention cells, and into one of these the
guards were about to thrust Winston. Jimmy Christopher glanced
around, saw that there was no one else in the cellar, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now boys!"</p>

<p>He leaped at the startled guards, lunging with his bayonet. Z-7,
beside him, did likewise. So efficiently had it been done, that no
sound was made. The other four Minute Men dragged the two dead
guards into the cell, stripped them of armor and weapons, while
Jimmy Christopher and Z-7 spoke to Winston.</p>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0603911h-images/WarMastersFromTheOrient-09.gif" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">He leaped at the startled guards, lunging with
his bayonet.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The admiral exclaimed: "Operator 5! How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Jimmy said hurriedly. "There's no time for
explanations. We're here to find some clue to the Leopard's secret.
Can you help us?"</p>

<p>Winston shook his head. "I know as little as I did yesterday. I
know that Ward doctored my coffee in some way. It was my fault that
the fleet was destroyed. I should have listened&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmy stopped the admiral, said: "Put on that suit, sir. It'll
get you by."</p>

<p>While Winston was donning the armor, he spoke quickly: "Your
father's up there in the assembly room, Operator 5. It'll be his
turn to be questioned in a few minutes. There's a girl with
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One?" Jimmy queried anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. Very pretty, with chestnut hair&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Diane!" Z-7 exclaimed. "Then he hasn't caught Katerina
yet?"</p>

<p>"No. But he's torturing the prisoners to make them talk. God!"
Winston's voice was tense with emotion. "I only want one chance at
that Leopard&mdash;and at Earl Ward. Ward's his interpreter." Jimmy
swung around.</p>

<p>"Let's go! We're going to take a crack at the Leopard!" He
hurried back up the stairs. The entrance to the cellar was on the
Thirty-third Street side, and he stopped, his eyes narrowed,
looking down a corridor at right angles to the one they had
used.</p>

<p>A long line of Asiatic soldiers was moving along this corridor
through the main entrance of the building. And they were passing,
one at a time, into a room, the door of which was wide open. From
where the Americans stood, they could see into that room, which was
lit by a half-dozen candles. Four Chinese, in white smocks, were in
that room, and as the soldiers entered, the white-smocked
Celestials picked up hypodermic syringes from tables at their
elbows, swabbed off the arm of a soldier, and drove home the
plunger of the hypo.</p>

<p>They were giving some sort of injection to the men as fast as
they could work.</p>

<p>"I think, Chief," Operator 5 whispered, "that we're on the track
of the Leopard's secret!" His eyes were fixed on a small room next
to the laboratory, the door of which was also open. In this room,
two more white-smocked Asiatics were working over test-tubes set in
brackets above Bunsen burners. While Jimmy and Z-7 watched, one of
these two poured the contents of the test tubes into a large vial,
and carried it out into the laboratory in which the injections were
being given. There was only one man left in the small room, and
Jimmy said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Z-7! I'm going to get one of those!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for acknowledgement Operator 5 swiftly entered
the small room. The white-coated Chinese looked up inquiringly,
peering near-sightedly through thick-lensed glasses. He started in
consternation as he realized that Jimmy was not an Asiatic. But
Operator 5 gave him no chance to cry out.</p>

<p>Stepping in close, he brought up his fist in a swift, hard blow
to the man's chin, sent him smashing back against the wall,
unconscious. Then he swung quickly to the row of tubes above the
Bunsen burner, removed them, and poured their contents into a vial.
He corked it, sped out of the room to join Z-7 again.</p>

<p>"Let's get away from here, quick!" he urged. He led the way down
the corridor. No alarm was raised...</p>

<p>Jimmy hurried in the direction of the assembly room, with Z-7
beside him, and Winston and the Minute Men behind.</p>

<p>They came in sight of the large double doors, and Z-7 shouted
suddenly: "God! Jimmy! God! Look at that! Diane!"</p>

<p>The tableau caused Jimmy's blood to race. The Leopard was seated
at the desk. In front of the desk, stood his father, in the grip of
two guards. Close by, two more Asiatics were gripping Diane while a
third was drawing back a bayonet to plunge it into her body.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher flung himself forward, headlong, his automatic
snapping into his hand as if by magic. The guard with the bayonet
was just lunging toward Diane when Jimmy's first hasty shot caught
him high in the chest.</p>

<p>John Christopher turned toward the corridor. Numerous Asiatics
now swung toward the doorway, raising their rifles, but Jimmy's
automatic spoke quickly in sharp, staccato barks. A deadly calm was
upon him. Each shot was placed perfectly. Four men fell to four
shots. They were the huge guards who pinioned Diane and John
Christopher. Above the reverberations of the swift reports, Jimmy
shouted loudly: "Diane! Dad! Run! This way!"</p>

<p>John Christopher leaped into action at the sound of his son's
voice, seized Diane by the hand and raced with her through the
doorway, then dragged her flat on the floor as the rifles in the
room began to crack spitefully.</p>

<p>Operator 5 had held his fire during that tense moment while his
father and Diane raced from the room.</p>

<p>Now Diane and John Christopher were safe, and the doorway was
clear. The Minute Men raised their own rifles, poured out a
withering blast.</p>

<p>John Christopher had urged Diane on again, and Jimmy gestured
his men on down the corridor. They raced around an angle in the
passageway and out into the night through the side door they had
entered.</p>

<p>The Oriental guards died without understanding what had killed
them.</p>

<p>Outside, the motorcycles were still parked where Jimmy and his
men had left them. They all piled in, Diane, Q-6 and Admiral
Winston each crowding into a side car with one of the Minute
Men.</p>

<p>The soldiers in the street were dazed by the unexpected
swiftness of the escape. For a moment, they did not realize that
the armored men were not their Asiatic comrades. And that moment of
respite was sufficient for the Americans.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of breakneck speed, Jimmy raised a hand,
pointed south, and they raced downtown.</p>

<p>Through the night, along broken streets, Jimmy Christopher led
his tiny army at a reckless pace. Behind them in the armory, the
Leopard, livid and choking with rage, was spluttering orders,
threats, curses. Every motorcycle available was ordered out to hunt
the fugitives.</p>

<p>But the Minute Men had a good start, and a brilliant commander.
They shook the pursuit easily, and in twelve minutes they were
holed up in the old wine cellar. Tim Donovan let out a boyish whoop
of joy when he saw Diane and Q-6. But Jimmy permitted little time
for greetings. He drew Z-7 and Tim Donovan aside. "Any more news,
Tim?" he questioned.</p>

<p>Tim nodded. "I did what you told me, Jimmy. I got through to
Washington, and talked to the Secretary of War. He's at his wits'
end&mdash;a regular blue funk. He orders you to report to him in
person at once. He has called the North Beach Airport, and has
arranged for a seaplane to be waiting for you in the East River,
without lights, at midnight. You're to get out to it tonight. The
Secretary wants you in Washington too, Z-7. The plane will hold two
people besides the pilot."</p>

<p>"All right," Jimmy said. "I have to go anyway. I want to get to
a laboratory as fast as I can, and analyze the contents of this
vial. These people will be safe."</p>

<p>For a moment he stood deep in thought. Then he called over
Admiral Winston, explained to him what he was going to do. "You're
the logical man to take charge of this secret headquarters,
Winston. Keep these people safe in here. Don't let them venture out
again. The Asiatics are surely combing the city for us."</p>

<p>Winston's eyes held a wistful light. "Do you feel confident that
I can be trusted with a command of any kind, Operator 5, after the
way&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Z-7 cheered him heartily, clapping him on the back.
"Look at what happened to Falk. You couldn't help it. Operator 5
and I know you're all right."</p>

<p>It was plainly visible to them both how Winston's shoulders
suddenly straightened, and how his chin rose and jutted. He had
been bitterly reproaching himself as a coward&mdash;a traitor,
almost.</p>

<p>The confidence in him which Jimmy had shown by placing him in
charge of these people had given him faith in himself.</p>

<p>Jimmy hurried over to Diane and his father, managed to pull them
away from the eager, curious men and women about them. "Where is
Katerina Saratoff?" Diane exchanged glances with John Christopher
then informed Jimmy quickly:</p>

<p>"When the shells began to fall near Mercy Hospital, we moved all
the patients out on stretchers. Dad was able to walk by then, and
he and I and Katerina helped. After the bombardment, the Sixth
Avenue "L" Station at Fourteenth Street was still standing, so we
moved into it. Two patients died while we were in the station.</p>

<p>"Then we saw the Asiatics coming to round up prisoners, and dad
here said that if the Leopard got Katerina, she would be worse off
than any of us. So we put her on a stretcher and covered her with a
sheet, alongside of the two who had previously died. When the
soldiers came, dad told them that they were the bodies of small-pox
cases, and the Asiatics left them severely alone. So Katerina is
probably still up there."</p>

<p>"Good work, Diane," Jimmy praised her. He turned to his father.
"I'm leaving here at midnight, dad. I've asked Winston to take
charge. I thought it would help him get his self-confidence back."
He explained about the message from the Secretary of War. "Besides,
I want to analyze this stuff. If, God willing, it helps us beat
these Asiatics, we'll come down on New York shooting. So help
Winston keep everybody down in these vaults where they'll be safe.
I'll communicate with Tim, and let you know what's going on."</p>

<p>John Christopher nodded. "If you stage a counter-attack, Jimmy,
let me know a little ahead of time. I'll try to get to where
Katerina is, and keep her safe."</p>

<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; FATE CALLS THE
COOLIE EMPEROR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN of the second day following the successful
raid of the Minute Men against the Leopard's stronghold in the
armory found the remnants of the United States troops entrenched
around the southeastern edge of Muscoot Reservoir, thirty miles
north of New York City.</p>

<p>The vanguard of the Asiatics was less than five miles away, at
Mount Kisco.</p>

<p>Southern Westchester and western Connecticut had been sacked,
burned and pillaged. It was now a trackless, charred wasteland.</p>

<p>From every part of the country, frantic queries were pouring
into Washington. Why were the troops retreating without striking a
blow? Why was heavy ordnance abandoned without a shot being fired?
Would the whole country be given over to pillage and fire and
rapine, like New York?</p>

<p>To all these questions, Washington had for two days maintained a
discreet, painful silence.</p>

<p>At the Muscoot Reservoir, however, a strange spirit of animation
was in the air. Peculiarly, the atmosphere of self-distrust and
futility which had pervaded the American troops for the past three
days was lacking. And strange things were happening there,
too...</p>

<p>Heavily guarded supply trucks raced along all the highways, and,
upon arrival at the Muscoot encampment, were unloaded with frenzied
zeal and haste. On being opened, the crates were proved to contain
however, not guns or other similar implements of war, but cases of
bottles, outfits of hypodermic syringes, and cartons of cotton and
antiseptics!</p>

<p>Physicians and internes by the hundreds seized the strange
military material and laid it out in hastily improvised infirmaries
along the reservoir.</p>

<p>At Headquarters, located just outside the small town of Goldens
Bridge, Jimmy Christopher sat before a hurriedly installed battery
of telephones. As the reports came in from the physicians in charge
of each field-unit, he assigned to that unit troops for
inoculation.</p>

<p>In a field near Jimmy's office, a plane whirred to a landing,
and a few moments later, the Secretary of War strode into the room.
Scowling, he strode wrathfully to the desk where Jimmy sat.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher smiled, motioned to an officer to take charge
of the phones, and arose from his chair. He took the Secretary's
arm, led him into the next room. Here, a laboratory had been set
up&mdash;small, but complete in every detail.</p>

<p>"I haven't had a chance to talk to you, sir, since I came up
here. I told you about the vial I had taken from the laboratory, in
the armory, but you didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Well, I analyzed the stuff, and found it was a compound of
strychnine and caffeine. The Leopard was giving his men an
injection of that stuff."</p>

<p>The Secretary gazed at Jimmy in a puzzled manner. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't understand it either," Jimmy went on, "until I
analyzed some of the air in the pockets of the ground around
Kensico Dam where we were defeated two days ago.</p>

<p>"I found a gas which I had never known to exist before. It has
all the properties which would be possessed by a compound of
nembutal, aconitine and sodium amytol. Those are all coma-producing
drugs, but if they were to be reduced to a gaseous form they would
be too volatile for any practical use. This gas which I found in
the air-pocket, is a heavy gas and yet possesses all the
coma-producing qualities."</p>

<p>"I still don't&mdash;" the Secretary began.</p>

<p>But Jimmy hurried on. "Don't you understand, sir? Those towers
of the Asiatics; those queer guns of theirs&mdash;it would be
impossible to disseminate any ordinary gas over a vast area. But it
can be done with this one. And to ensure that his own troops are
not affected by it, the Leopard injects them with a stimulant of
strychnine and caffeine. Thus, when that queer feeling of futility
struck the navy, the Asiatics were not affected in the same way
because they had already assimilated a powerful stimulant. The same
thing happened at Kensico Dam."</p>

<p>Suddenly a light gleamed in the Secretary's eyes. "Then you're
giving the same stimulant to our own men now!"</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir! And we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as an officer burst into the room, saluted, and
reported excitedly: "The Asiatics are advancing, sir. The attack
has started!"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. He said to the Secretary: "The next ten minutes
will tell the story, sir. If I've guessed right&mdash;victory. If
I've guessed wrong&mdash;we're doomed!"</p>

<p>Operator 5 hurried out of the headquarters building, issued
swift orders to the officers gathered about him. To the East he
could see the armored motorcycles of the Asiatics racing toward the
hastily built trenches.</p>

<p>From a distance came the dull reports of the queer guns on the
steel towers of the Asiatics. The gas shells began to burst in the
air about them. The gas itself was odorless, and Jimmy gazed
anxiously from one face to another of the officers about him. They
had all had injections, including himself.</p>

<p>Z-7 came hurrying over to him, exclaimed: "Jimmy! I think you've
hit it this time. I don't feel a thing!"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. "The troops all seem okay." He glanced down the
line of trenches at the tense, youthful faces of the volunteer
defenders, waiting for the signal to fire at the advancing
motorcycles.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmy Christopher's body tautened. He gripped Z-7's
arm. "Look at that, Chief!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>From a side road, only a hundred yards distant, an automobile
had swung into the main road in the path of the oncoming
motorcycles. It was an open touring car, and Jimmy and Z-7 could
see that the two occupants were both women.</p>

<p>"It's Diane!" Jimmy shouted. "And she's got Katerina with
her!"</p>

<p>Behind the touring car raced a motorcycle. It was driven by an
Asiatic soldier, and in the side car, standing erect, was the huge
figure of the Leopard bent down to the machine on the side car.
Flame belched from it, and a stream of bullets lanced out toward
the auto, to the accompaniment of a wicked rat-tat-tat.</p>

<p>A rear tire on the automobile exploded with a report that
sounded like a dull echo of the guns from the towers. The touring
car careened, and Jimmy could see Diane struggling with the
wheel.</p>

<p>The oncoming motorcycles were close now, on the main road.
Diane's car lurched to one side, landed in the ditch along the
road. The two white-faced girls sprang from the twisted wreckage,
started to race toward the American trenches, while the Asiatic
motorcycles charged down on them from behind.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Leopard sprang from the side car of his
motorcycle, raced, after the girls. His great body glistened in the
morning light and he was brandishing a heavy, two-edged sword. His
face was twisted in fury; his lips were drawn back from his teeth
in a snarl. He was very close to the panic-stricken girls now. It
was obvious that he would reach them perhaps two minutes before the
roaring motorcycles of his own troops. In either event, the two
girls were doomed...</p>

<p>Jimmy groaned aloud. He could not give the order to the men in
the trenches to shoot, for Diane and Katerina were directly in the
line of fire.</p>

<p>"Z-7!" he shouted hoarsely. "Take over command!" And with that,
he leaped up, sprinted furiously, frantically, down the road toward
the three. As he ran, his automatic came into his hand, and he
raised it to take a pot-shot at the Leopard. But at that instant,
he saw the driver of the Leopard's side car rise behind his plate
armor, and draw a bead with his rifle on the two fleeing girls.
Jimmy swung his automatic, sent a stream of hot lead spouting at
that soldier until the clip of the automatic was empty. But his
shots had winged home, for the man dropped the rifle from nerveless
fingers, toppled from the cycle to sprawl dead in the dusty
roadway.</p>

<p>And just at that moment, when it seemed the girls might outrun
the huge man pursuing them still, Katerina tripped, fell in the
road. Diane, close behind her, barely missed stumbling over her,
lost precious seconds as she bent to help.</p>

<p>The Leopard, now only a few paces away uttered a mad cry of
triumph, raised his ponderous broadsword. Jimmy, coming from the
opposite direction, covered the short space between him and the
coolie emperor in a desperate breathless sprint, clubbed his
automatic, flung it violently into the Leopard's face!</p>

<p>That blow probably would have killed any ordinary man, but the
giant coolie shook his head, plunged ahead...</p>

<p>Jimmy stood weaponless now, and the Leopard grinned evilly,
advanced toward him with the sword raised aloft for a slicing,
slanting blow which could shave a man's head from his neck.
Operator 5 waited until the sword was actually descending before he
acted. Then, with the swiftness of light, he dropped flat to the
ground while the blade whistled harmlessly over his head.</p>

<p>The Leopard was pulled off balance, by the weight of the sword
at that instant, and Jimmy launched himself from the ground in a
short football tackle which toppled the huge man sideways.</p>

<p>Like a majestic forest giant falling before the grim hacking of
the woodsman, the coolie fell heavily on his right arm. The keen
edge of the sword, still gripped in his massive fists was jammed up
between his shoulder and his neck. It sliced through the Leopard's
thick throat as if it were cutting butter, and the conqueror of
Asia&mdash;the scourge of Russia and terror of America&mdash;lay
there on the road, bleeding to death.</p>

<p>Jimmy Christopher was back on his feet in an instant. He raced
to Katerina, who was limping in the road with a badly twisted
ankle, resting on Diane's arm. He picked up the Russian girl, gave
Diane a shove that sent her sprawling off the road into the ditch,
leaped to follow her just as the first ranks of the armored
motorcycles swept up. The drivers tried frantically to brake their
machines when they saw their master lying in the road bathed in his
own blood. But they were traveling far too fast. Solid-tired wheels
crunched on the bones of the man who had yearned to master the
world.</p>

<p>And at that instant, Z-7, standing in front of the headquarters
building, raised his arm in a signal. From the trenches lining the
reservoir a solid sheet of fire belched at those motorcycles from
the muzzles of a thousand rifles. The cycles piled up on one
another in crashing wreckage. The road became a mess of twisted,
flaming metal and writhing dying men.</p>

<p>A great shout of triumph rose from the trenches, and wave after
wave of young men went over the top, charging with bayonets. They
swept past the spot where Jimmy Christopher crouched with Diane and
Katerina, swept around the wrecked motorcycles, swarmed down the
road in a yelling, mad, victorious charge against the foot-soldiers
of the Asiatics who were still a great distance in the rear.</p>

<p>Those Oriental troops had never encountered active resistance
before. The sudden sight of the charging madmen of the American
army signified only one thing to them&mdash;that their master's
magic had finally failed.</p>

<p>Their courage was not equal to facing that onsweeping charge.
They turned tail and ran. The great Asiatic army fled in panicky
rout...!</p>

<p>Along the edge of the road, Diane was saying swiftly to
Jimmy:</p>

<p>"I couldn't bear to think of Katerina staying alone there with
the corpses. So I stole out last night, and went to the "L"
station, and found her. We wandered over to the Express Highway,
and saw that touring car, abandoned. I started it, and we raced up
here. We didn't know that the Leopard was camped around Mt. Kisco,
and they sighted us."</p>

<p>Diane was breathing quickly, her eyes shining with excitement.
"And believe me, Jimmy, the Leopard almost had us!"</p>

<p>Jimmy saw Z-7 run past them after the charging troops, and waved
to him.</p>

<p>From the direction of the headquarters building, the Secretary
of War was sedately approaching them, his face wreathed in
smiles.</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed. "It's a victory, all right, those lads of ours
won't stop until they've chased every last Asiatic back into the
ocean again. And you, Katerina&mdash;" he glanced somberly at the
pile of twisted motorcycles in the road, beneath which lay the body
of the coolie who had wanted to be emperor&mdash;"and you,
Katerina, are revenged for your brother."</p>

<p>"Yes," Katerina said simply. "Feodor must be
satisfied&mdash;wherever he is. And I&mdash;well, I've found a
wonderful new friend, Jimmy Christopher&mdash;the bravest man in
the world!"</p>
