  <h3>IN WHICH A SHORT-SIGHTED TAXIDERMIST FROM<br>
  TANGIER MAKES A DISCOVERY UPON ROSEVEAR</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE discovery made a great stir amongst the islands, and
  particularly at St. Mary's. In the square space before the Customs' House, on
  the little stone jetty, among the paths through the gorse of the Garrison, it
  became the staple subject of gossip, until another ship came ashore and other
  lives were lost. For quite apart from its odd circumstances, a certain
  mystery lent importance to Ralph Warriner. It transpired that nearly two
  years before, when on service at Gibraltar, Captain Warriner of the Artillery
  had slipped out of harbour one dark night in his yacht, and had straightway
  disappeared; it was proved that subsequently he had been dismissed from the
  service; and the coroner of St. Mary's in a moment of indiscretion let slip
  the information that the Home Office had requested him to furnish it with a
  detailed history of the facts. The facts occurred in this sequence.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock of a morning in the last week of July, the St. Agnes
  lugger which carries the relief men to and fro between the Trinity House
  barracks upon St. Mary's and the Bishop Lighthouse in the Atlantic, ran
  alongside of St. Mary's pier. There were waiting upon the steps, the two
  lighthouse men, and a third, a small rotund Belgian of a dark, shiny
  countenance which seemed always on the point of perspiring. He was swathed in
  a borrowed suit of oilskins much too large for him, and would have cut a
  comical figure had he not on that raw morning looked supremely unhappy and
  pathetic. M. Claude Fournier was a taxidermist by profession and resided at
  Tangier; he was never backward in declaring that the evidences of his skill
  decorated many entrance-halls throughout Europe; and some three weeks before
  he had come holiday-making alone to the islands of Scilly.</p>

  <p>He now stood upon the steps of the pier nervously polishing his glasses as
  the lugger swung upwards and downwards on the swell. He watched the relief
  men choose their time and spring on board, and just as Zebedee Isaacs, the
  master of the boat, was about to push off with his boat-hook, he nerved
  himself to speak.</p>

  <p>"I go with you to the Bishop, is it not?"</p>

  <p>Isaacs looked up in surprise. He had been wondering what had brought the
  little man out in this dress and on this morning.</p>

  <p>"There'll be a head-wind all the way," he said discouragingly, "and wi'
  that and a heavy ground sea we'll be brave an' wet before we reach the
  Bishop, brave an' wet."</p>

  <p>"I do not mind," replied M. Fournier. "For the sea, I am <i>dévot</i>;"
  but his voice was tremulous and belied him.</p>

  <p>Isaacs shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's not only the sea. Look!" And he stretched out his arm. A variable
  fog rolled and tumbled upon a tumbling wilderness of sea. "I'ld sooner have
  two gales lashed together than sail amongst these islands in a fog. I'ld
  never go to-day at all, but the boat's more'n three weeks overdue."</p>

  <p>Indeed, as M. Fournier looked seawards, there was no glimpse of land
  visible. A fortnight of heavy weather had been followed by a week of fog
  which enveloped the islands like a drenched blanket. Only to-day had it shown
  any signs of breaking, and the St. Agnes lugger was the first boat, so far as
  was known, to run the hazard of the sea. It is true that two days before one
  man had run in to the bar of Tregarthen's Hotel and told how he had stood
  upon the top of the Garrison and had looked suddenly down a lane between two
  perpendicular walls of mist, and had seen the water breaking white upon Great
  Smith Rock, and in the near distance an open boat under a mizzen and a jib,
  beating out through the heavy swell towards the west. But his story was in no
  wise believed.</p>

  <p>To all of Isaacs's objections M. Fournier was impervious, and he was at
  last allowed to embark.</p>

  <p>"Now!" cried Zebedee Isaacs, as the lugger rose. M. Fournier gave a
  pathetic look backwards to the land, shut his eyes and jumped. Isaacs caught
  and set him upon the floor of the boat, where he stood clutching the runners.
  He saw the landing-steps dizzily rush past him up to the sky like a Jacob's
  ladder, and then as dizzily shut downwards below him like a telescope.</p>

  <p>The boat was pushed off. It rounded the pier-head and beat out on its
  first tack, across the Road. M. Fournier crouched down under the shelter of
  the weather bulwark.</p>

  <p>"As for the sea I am <i>dévot</i>," he murmured, with a watery smile.</p>

  <p>In a little the boat was put about. From Sour Milk Ledge it was sailed on
  the port tack towards Great Minalto, and felt the wind and felt the sea. It
  climbed up waves till the red lug-sail swung over M. Fournier's head like a
  canopy; and on the downward slope the heavy bows took the water with a thud.
  M. Fournier knelt up and clung to the stays. At all costs he must see. He
  stared into the shifting fog at the rollers which came hopping and leaping
  towards him; and he was very silent and very still, as though the fascination
  of terror enchained him.</p>

  <p>On the third tack, however, he began to resume his courage. He even smiled
  over his shoulder towards Zebedee Isaacs at the tiller.</p>

  <p>"As for the sea," he began to say, "I am&mdash;" But the statement, which
  he was not to verify on this day, ended in a shriek. For at that moment a
  great green wave hopped exultingly over the bows, and thenceforward all the
  way to the Bishop the lugger shipped much water.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's behaviour became deplorable. As Isaacs bluntly and angrily
  summarised it, "he lay upon the thwarts and screeched like a rook;" and in
  his appeals to his mother he was quite conventionally French.</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to land upon the Lighthouse. The relief men were
  hoisted up in the sling, the head-keeper and one of his assistants were
  lowered, and the lugger started upon its homeward run before the wind. The
  fog thickened and lightened about them as they threaded the intricate
  channels of the western islands. Now it was a thin grey mist, parting here
  and there in long corridors, driven this way and that, twirling in spires of
  smoke, shepherded by the winds; now again it hung close about them an
  impenetrable umber, while the crew in short quick tones and gestures of the
  arms mapped out the rocks and passages. About them they could hear the roar
  of the breaking waves and the rush of water up slabs and over ledges, and
  then the "glumph glumph" as the wave sucked away. At times, too, the fog
  lifted from the surface and hung very low, massed above their heads, so that
  the black hillocks of the islets stood out in the sinister light like
  headstones of a cemetery of the sea, and at the feet of them the water was
  white like a flash of hungry teeth.</p>

  <p>It was at one such moment, when the boat had just passed through
  Crebawethan Neck, that M. Fournier, who had been staring persistently over
  the starboard bulwark, suddenly startled the crew.</p>

  <p>"There's a ship on shore. <i>Tenez</i>&mdash;look!" he cried. "There,
  there!" And as he spoke the mist drove between his eyes and what he declared
  that he saw.</p>

  <p>Zebedee Isaacs looked in the direction.</p>

  <p>"On Jacky's Rock?" he asked, nodding towards a menacing column of black
  rock which was faintly visible.</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;beyond!&mdash;There!" And M. Fournier excitedly
  gesticulated. He seemed at that moment to have lost all his terror of the
  sea.</p>

  <p>"On Rosevear, then," said the keeper of the lighthouse, and he strained
  towards Rosevear.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing," he said, "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to see," replied Isaacs, who did not alter his
  course.</p>

  <p>"But it's true," exclaimed the little Belgian. "I see it no more myself.
  But I have seen it, I tell you. I have seen the mast above the
  island&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You!" interrupted Isaacs, with a blunt contempt; "you are blind!" And M.
  Fournier, before anyone could guess his intention, flung himself upon Isaacs
  and jammed the tiller hard over to port. The boat came broadside to the wind,
  heeled over, and in a second the water was pouring in over the gunwale.
  Zebedee wrenched the main sheet off the pin, and let the big sail fly;
  another loosed the jib. The promptitude of these two men saved the boat. It
  ran its head up into the wind, righted itself upon its keel, and lay with
  flapping sails and shivered.</p>

  <p>Isaacs without a word caught hold of M. Fournier and shook him like a rat;
  and every man of the crew in violent tones expounded to the Belgian the
  enormity of his crime. Fournier was himself well-nigh frantic with
  excitement. He was undaunted by any threats of violence; neither the boat,
  nor the sea, nor the crew had any terrors for him.</p>

  <p>"There is a ship!" he screamed. "The fog was vanished&mdash;just for a
  second it was vanished, and I have seen it. There may be men alive on that
  rock&mdash;starving, perishing, men of the sea like you. You will not leave
  them. But you shall not!" And clinging to the mast he stamped his feet. "But
  you shall not!"</p>

  <p>"And by the Lord he's right," said the lighthouse-keeper, gravely&mdash;so
  gravely that complete silence at once fell upon the crew. One man stood up in
  the bows, a second knelt upon the thwarts, a third craned his body out beyond
  the stern, and all with one accord stared towards Rosevear. The screen of
  haze was drawn aside, and quite clear to the view over a low rock, rose the
  mast and tangled cordage of a wreck.</p>

  <p>The sheets were made fast without a word. Without a word, Zebedee Isaacs
  put the boat about and steered it into the Neck between Rosevear and
  Rosevean. As they passed along that narrow channel, no noise was heard but
  the bustle of the tide. For at the western end they saw the bows of a ship
  unsteadily poised upon a ledge. There was a breach amidships, the stern was
  under water, only the foremast stood; and nowhere was there any sign of
  life.</p>

  <p>Isaacs brought the boat to in a tiny creek, some distance from the
  wreck.</p>

  <p>"We can land here," he said, and the lighthouse-keeper and Fournier
  stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>On the instant that quiet, silent islet whirred into life and noise. So
  startling was the change that M. Fournier jumped backwards while his heart
  jerked within him.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he cried, and then laughed as he understood. For a cloud of
  puffins, gulls, kittiwakes and shearwaters whirled upwards from that nursery
  of sea-birds and circled above his head, their cries sounding with infinite
  melancholy, their wings flickering like silver in that grey and desolate
  light.</p>

  <p>"It's so like your Robinson Crusoe," said M. Fournier.</p>

  <p>"It is more like our islands of Scilly," said the lighthouse-keeper, as he
  looked towards the wreck.</p>

  <p>They climbed over the low rocks and walked along the crown of the island
  towards the wreck. There was no tree or shrub upon the barren soil, only here
  a stretch of sandy grass, there a patch of mallows&mdash;mallows of a rusty
  green and whitened with salt of the sea. In the midst of one such patch they
  came upon the body of a man. He was dressed in a pilot coat, sea boots and
  thick stockings drawn over his trousers to the hips, and he lay face
  downwards with his head resting upon his arms in a natural posture of
  sleep.</p>

  <p>Fournier stood still. The lighthouse-keeper walked forward and tapped the
  sleeper upon the shoulder. But the sleeper did not wake. The lighthouse man
  knelt down and gently turned the man over upon his back; as he did so, or
  rather just before he did so, Fournier turned sharply away with a shudder.
  When the sailor was lying upon his back, the keeper of the lighthouse started
  with something of a shudder too. For the sailor had no face.</p>

  <p>The lighthouse man drew his handkerchief from his pocket and gently
  covered the head. It seemed almost as if Fournier had been waiting, had been
  watching, for this action. For he turned about immediately and stood by the
  lighthouse-keeper's side. Above the lonely islet the sea-birds circled and
  called; on the sea the mist was now no more than a gauze, and through it the
  glow of the sun was faintly diffused.</p>

  <p>"Strange that, isn't it?" said the lighthouse-keeper, in a hushed voice.
  "The sea dashed him upon the rocks and drew him down again and threw him up
  again until it got tired of the sport, and so tossed him here to lie quietly
  face downwards amongst the mallows like a man asleep."</p>

  <p>Then he sat back upon his heels and measured the distance between the
  mallows and the sea with some perplexity upon his forehead&mdash;and the
  perplexity grew.</p>

  <p>"It's a long way for the sea to have thrown him," he said, and as Fournier
  shifted restlessly at his side, he looked up into his face. "Good God, man,
  but you look white," he said.</p>

  <p>"The sight is terrible," replied Fournier, as he wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>The lighthouse-keeper nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a terrible place, the sea about these western islands," he
  said. "Did you ever hear tell that there are sunken cities all the way
  between here and Land's End, the sunken cities of Lyonnesse? Terrible sights
  those cities must see. I often think of the many ships which have plunged
  down among their chimneys and roof-tops&mdash;perhaps here a great Spanish
  galleon with its keel along the middle of a paved square and its poop
  overhanging the gables, and the fishes swimming in and out of the cabins
  through the broken windows; perhaps there a big three-decker like Sir
  Cloudesley Shovel's, showing the muzzles of her silent guns; or a little
  steam-tramp of our own times, its iron sides brown with rust, and God knows
  what tragedy hidden in its tiny engine-room. A terrible place&mdash;these
  islands of Scilly, dwelling amongst the seas, as the old books
  say&mdash;dwelling amongst the seas."</p>

  <p>He bent forward and unfastened the dead sailor's pilot jacket. Then he
  felt in his pocket and drew out an oilskin case. This he opened, and Fournier
  knelt beside him.</p>

  <p>There were a few letters in the case, which the two men read through. They
  were of no particular importance beyond that they were headed "Yacht The Ten
  Brothers," and they were signed "Ralph Warriner," all of them except one.
  This one was a love-letter of a date six years back. It was addressed to
  "Ralph," and was signed "Miranda."</p>

  <p>"Six years old," said the lighthouse-keeper. "For six years he has carried
  that about with him, and now it will be read out in court to make a sorry fun
  for people whom he never knew. That's hard on him, eh? But harder on the
  woman."</p>

  <p>At the words, spoken in a low voice, M. Fournier moved uneasily and seemed
  to wince. The lighthouse-keeper held the letter in his hands and thoughtfully
  turned over its pages.</p>

  <p>"I have a mind to tear it up, but I suppose I must not." He returned the
  papers to the oilskin case, and going back to the boat called for two of the
  crew to carry the body down. "Meanwhile," said he to Fournier, "we might have
  a look at 'The Ten Brothers.'"</p>

  <p>They could not approach the bows of the ship, but overlooked them from a
  pinnacle of rock. There was, however, little to be remarked.</p>

  <p>"She is an old boat, and she has seen some weather from the look of her,"
  said the lighthouse-keeper. That, indeed, was only to be expected, for "The
  Ten Brothers" had been a trader before Ralph Warriner bought her, and two
  years had elapsed between the night when he slipped from Gibraltar Harbour,
  and the day when this boat came to its last moorings upon Rosevear.</p>

  <p>The mist cleared altogether towards sunset. The sun shone out from the
  edge of the horizon a ball of red fire, and the lugger ferried the dead body
  back to St. Mary's over a sea which had the colour of claret, and through
  foam ripples which sparkled like gold.</p>

  <p>The Miranda who wrote the love-letter was Miranda Warriner, Ralph
  Warriner's wife. Miranda Bedlow she had been at the date which headed the
  letter. She was living now at Ronda in the Andalusian hills, a hundred miles
  from Algeciras and Gibraltar, and had lived there since her husband's
  disappearance. To Ronda the oilskin case was sent. She heard the news of her
  Ralph's death with a natural sense of solemnity, but she was too sincere a
  woman to assume a grief which she could not feel. For her married life had
  been one of extraordinary unhappiness.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>PRESENTS THE HERO IN THE UNHEROIC ATTITUDE OF A SPECTATOR</h3><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Lady Donnisthorpe who two years later introduced Luke
  Charnock to Mrs. Warriner. Lady Donnisthorpe was an outspoken woman with an
  untameable passion for match-making, which she indulged with the ardour and,
  indeed, the results of an amateur chemist. Her life was spent in mingling
  incompatible elements and producing explosions to which her enthusiasm kept
  her deaf, even when they made a quite astonishing noise. For no experience of
  reverses could stale her satisfaction when she beheld an eligible bachelor or
  maid walk for the first time into her parlour.</p>

  <p>She had made Charnock's acquaintance originally in Barbados. He sat next
  her at a dinner given by the Governor of the Island, and took her fancy with
  the pleasing inconsistency of a boyish appearance and a wealth of
  experiences. He was a man of a sunburnt aquiline face, which was lean but not
  haggard, grey and very steady eyes, and a lithe, tall figure, and though he
  conveyed an impression of activity, he was still a restful companion. Lady
  Donnisthorpe remarked in him a modern appreciation of the poetry of
  machinery, and after dinner made inquiries of the Governor.</p>

  <p>"He is on his way homewards from Peru," answered the latter. "He has been
  surveying for a railway line there during the last two years. What do you
  think of him?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know what you think."</p>

  <p>"I like him. He is modest without diffidence, successful without
  notoriety."</p>

  <p>"What are his people?" asked Lady Donnisthorpe.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he has any. But I believe his father was a clergyman in
  Yorkshire."</p>

  <p>"It would sound improper for a girl without visible relations to say that
  she was the daughter of a clergyman in Yorkshire, wouldn't it?" said her
  ladyship, reflectively. "But I suppose it's no objection in a man;" and in
  her memories she made a mark against Charnock's name. She heard of him again
  once or twice in unexpected quarters from the lips of the men who from East
  to West are responsible for the work that is done; and once or twice she met
  him, for she was a determined traveller. Finally, at Cairo, she sat next to
  Sir John Martin, the head partner of a great Leeds firm of railway
  contractors.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever come across a Mr. Charnock?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The head partner laughed.</p>

  <p>"I did; I knew his father."</p>

  <p>"It's a strange thing about Mr. Charnock," said she, "but one never hears
  anything of what he was doing before the last few years."</p>

  <p>"Why not ask him?" said the North-countryman, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"It might sound inquisitive," replied Lady Donnisthorpe, "and perhaps
  there's no need to, if you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," returned Sir John, with a great deal of provoking
  amusement, "and, believe me, Lady Donnisthorpe, it's not at all to his
  discredit."</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe began thereafter to select and reject possible wives for
  Charnock, and while still undecided, she chanced to pass one December through
  Nice. The first person whom she saw in the vestibule of the hotel was Luke
  Charnock.</p>

  <p>"What in the world are you doing here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Taking a week's holiday, Lady Donnisthorpe. I have been in Spain for the
  last two years, and shall be for the next nine months."</p>

  <p>"In Spain?"</p>

  <p>"I am making a new line between Cadiz and Algeciras."</p>

  <p>"God bless the man, and I never thought of it!" exclaimed Lady
  Donnisthorpe. "I think you will do," she added, looking him over, and nodding
  her head.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," replied Charnock, cheerfully. "It's a big lift for me."</p>

  <p>"In a way, no doubt," agreed her ladyship. "Though, mind you, the land
  isn't what it was."</p>

  <p>"The railway will improve it," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>They happened to be talking of different subjects. Lady Donnisthorpe
  pursued her own.</p>

  <p>"Then you won't be in England for a year?" she said regretfully.</p>

  <p>"The company building the line is an English one," replied Charnock. "I
  shall have to see the directors in June. I shall be in London then."</p>

  <p>"Then you must come and see me. Write before you leave Spain. Promise!"
  said Lady Donnisthorpe, who was now elated.</p>

  <p>Charnock promised, and that day Lady Donnisthorpe wrote to her cousin,
  Miranda Warriner, at Ronda, who was now at the end of the first year of her
  widowhood, and of the third year of her ridiculous seclusion at that little
  hill-town of Spain. Miranda was entreated, implored, and commanded to come to
  London in May. There was the season, there was Miranda's estate in Suffolk,
  which needed her attention. Miranda reluctantly consented, and so Lady
  Donnisthorpe was the instrument by which Charnock and Mrs. Warriner became
  acquainted. But the foundations of that acquaintanceship were laid without
  her ladyship's agency, and indeed without the knowledge of either Charnock or
  Miranda.</p>

  <p>A trifling defect in the machinery of a P. and O. boat began it. The P.
  and O. stayed for four days at Aden to make repairs, and so Charnock had four
  days to wait at Gibraltar before he could embark for England. He did not,
  however, spend more than two of those four days at Gibraltar, but picking up
  a yellow handbill in the lounge of the hotel, he obeyed its advice, and
  crossing the sunlit straits early the next morning saw the jealous hills
  about Tangier unfold and that cardboard city glitter down to the sea.</p>

  <p>He was rowed ashore to the usual accompaniment of shouts and yells by a
  villainous boat's crew of Arabs. A mob of Barbary Jews screamed at him on the
  landing-stage, and then a Moorish boy with a brown roguish face who was
  dressed in a saffron jellabia, pushed his way forwards and in a
  conversational voice said, "You English? God damn you, give me a penny!"</p>

  <p>Charnock hired that boy, and under his guidance sauntered through Tangier
  where the East and the West rub shoulders, where the camel snarls in the Sôk
  with an electric arc-lamp for a night-light, and all the races and all the
  centuries jostle together in many colours down the cobbles of its narrow
  streets. Charnock was shown the incidentals of the Tangier variety
  entertainment: the Basha administering more or less justice for less or more
  money at his Palace gate; the wooden peep-hole of the prison where the
  prisoners' hands come through and clutch for alms; a dancing-room where a
  Moorish woman closely veiled leaned her back against a Tottenham Court Road
  chest of drawers under a portrait of Mrs. Langtry, and beat upon a drum while
  another stamped an ungainly dance by the light of a paraffin lamp; and coming
  out again into the sunlight, Charnock cried out, "Hamet, take me somewhere
  where it's clean, and there's no din, and there are no smells."</p>

  <p>Hamet led the way up the hills, and every now and then, as he passed a man
  better dressed than his fellows he would say in a voice of awe:</p>

  <p>"That's a rich." He invariably added, "He's a Juice."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Hamet," said Charnock, at length, "can't you show me a rich
  who isn't a Jew?"</p>

  <p>"These are the loryers," observed Hamet, after the fashion of the March
  Hare when posed with an inconvenient question. He pointed to a number of
  venerable gentlemen in black robes who sat in wooden hutches open to the
  street. "I will show you," he continued, "a Moor who was the richest man in
  all Tangier."</p>

  <p>The pair walked up out of the town towards the Mazan, and came to a lane
  shadowed by cedars and bordered with prickly pears. Here the resounding din
  of the streets below was subdued to a murmurous confusion of voices, from
  which occasionally a sharp cry would spirt up clear into the air like a jet
  of water. Only one voice was definite and incessant, and that voice came down
  to them from the trees higher up the lane&mdash;a voice very thin, but on
  that hot, still afternoon very distinct&mdash;a voice which perpetually
  quavered and bleated one monotonous invocation.</p>

  <p>"Hassan Akbar," said Hamet.</p>

  <p>The invocation became articulate as they ascended. "Allah Beh!" the voice
  cried, and again "Allah Beh!" and again, until the windless air seemed to
  vibrate with its recurrence.</p>

  <p>They came upon the Moor who uttered this cry at the gate of the Moorish
  cemetery. A white, stubbly beard grew upon his chin and lips, but his
  strength was not diminished by his years, and with every movement of his body
  the muscles beneath the tough skin of his bare legs worked like live things.
  He sat cross-legged in the dust with a filthy sack for his only garment; he
  was blind, and his eyes stared from their red sockets covered with a bluish
  film as though the colours of the eyeballs had run.</p>

  <p>"Allah Beh!" he cried, swaying his body backwards and forwards with the
  regularity of an automaton and an inimitable quickness. He paid no heed
  whatever to Charnock and the boy as they halted beside him. "Allah Beh!" he
  cried, and his chest touched the cradle of his knees. He marked the seconds
  with the pendulum of his body; he struck them with his strident
  invocation.</p>

  <p>"He was the richest man in Tangier," said Hamet, and he told Hassan
  Akbar's story as though it was an affair of every day. Hassan had not secured
  the protection of any of the European Legations. He had hoped to hide his
  wealth by living poorly, and though he owned a house worth three thousand
  dollars in Tangier, he did not dwell in it. But no concealments had availed
  him. Someone of his familiars had told, and no doubt had made his profit from
  the telling. The Basha had waited his opportunity. It came when blindness
  left Hassan defenceless. Then the Basha laid hands upon him, forced him to
  give up the gains of a lifetime's trade, and so cast him out penniless to beg
  for copper flouss at the gate of the cemetery.</p>

  <p>"And Europe's no more than seven miles away," cried Charnock. Even where
  he stood he could see the laughing water of the Straits, and beyond that, the
  summit of Gibraltar. "Who was it that told?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is not known."</p>

  <p>Charnock dropped some money into the blind man's lap, but Hassan did not
  cease from his prayer to thank him.</p>

  <p>"He is very strong," said Hamet, who saw nothing strange in the story he
  had told. "He swings like this all day from seven in the morning to five at
  night. He never stops." And at that moment, upon the heels of Hamet's words,
  as though intentionally to belie them, Hassan Akbar suddenly arrested the
  motion of his body and suddenly ceased from his pitiable cry.</p>

  <p>His silence and immobility came with so much abruptness that Charnock was
  fairly startled. Then Hamet held up a finger, and they both listened. Maybe
  the blind man was listening too, but Charnock could not be certain. His face
  was as blind as his eyes, and there was no expression in the rigid attitude
  of his body.</p>

  <p>Charnock heard a faint sound higher up the lane. The sound became louder
  and defined itself. It was the slap-slap of a pair of Moorish slippers.
  Charnock drew Hamet back by the trunk of a tree, which sheltered them both
  from the view of anyone who came down the hill. He left the lane free, and
  into the open space there came a man who wore the dress of a Moor of wealth,
  serwal, chamir, farajia, and haik, spotless and complete. In figure he was
  slight and perhaps a trifle under the middle height, and the haik was drawn
  close over his forehead to shield him from the sun.</p>

  <p>Hassan was seated in the dust with the sun beating full upon his head. In
  front of him the newcomer stopped. "Peace be with you," he said, as Charnock,
  who had some knowledge of Arabic, understood. But the beggar made no answer,
  nor gave any sign that he heard. He sat motionless, impassive, a secret
  figure of stone.</p>

  <p>The newcomer laughed lightly to himself, and the laughter, within view of
  the rags and misery of the once rich man, sounded unpleasant and callous.
  Hamet shifted a foot at Charnock's side, and Charnock, whose interest in this
  picturesque encounter was steadily growing, pressed a hand upon the boy's
  shoulder to restrain him.</p>

  <p>The stranger, however, had noticed neither of the two spectators. He was
  still laughing softly to himself as he watched the beggar, and in a little he
  began to hum between his teeth a tune&mdash;a queer, elusive tune of a sweet
  but rather mournful melody; and it seemed to Charnock by some indefinable
  hint of movement that Hassan Akbar was straining his ears to catch and
  register that tune.</p>

  <p>The stranger advanced to Hassan and dropped a coin in his lap. The coin
  was not copper, for it sparkled in the air as it fell. Then with another easy
  laugh he turned to go down into Tangier. But as he turned he saw Charnock
  watching him. On the instant his hand went to his hood and drew it close
  about his cheeks, but not before Charnock had seen a scared face flashed at
  him for a moment, and immediately withdrawn. The Moor went down the lane.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was he who told?" said Charnock.</p>

  <p>Hamet disagreed.</p>

  <p>"He would not know. His beard was fair, so he comes from Fez." Charnock,
  too, had remarked that the man was fair-haired. But nevertheless this
  encounter of the rich Moor and the beggar remained in his thoughts, and he
  allowed his imagination lazily to fix a picture of it in his mind. Thus
  occupied, he walked through the cemetery, taking in that way a short cut to
  the Sôk. But he was not half-way across the cemetery when he turned sharply
  towards Hamet.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the tune the Moor hummed?"</p>

  <p>Charnock's ear was slow to retain the memory of music. Hamet, however,
  promptly whistled the melody from beginning to end, while Charnock stood and
  took count of it.</p>

  <p>"I shall have forgotten it to-morrow," said Hamet.</p>

  <p>"I think now that I shall recollect it tomorrow," said Charnock, and he
  walked on.</p>

  <p>But in a moment or two he stopped again as though some new perplexity was
  present to his mind.</p>

  <p>"Hamet," he said, "before the Moor appeared at all, while his footsteps
  were still faint, certainly before he spoke, Hassan Akbar stopped his prayer,
  which you say he never stops. He knew then who was coming. At all events he
  suspected. How did he know? How did he suspect?"</p>

  <p>"There is the Sôk," replied Hamet.</p>

  <p>They had passed round the bend of the hill up which the cemetery slopes,
  and were come within view of the market-place. Charnock was puzzled by his
  unanswered question, and the question was forced to his notice again that
  afternoon, and with yet greater force.</p>

  <p>It was market-day. Charnock beheld stretched out beneath him a great
  field, or rather a great plain, (for the grass was long since trampled into
  mud,) which curved down to the yellow sun-baked wall of the city, and whereon
  an innumerable throng, Negroes from Timbuctoo, Arabs, Jews, and Moors, in all
  manner of raiment, from rags to coloured robes, jostled and seethed, bawled
  and sweated, under a hot sun and in a brilliant air. Here an old hag screamed
  aloud the virtues of her merchandise, a few skinny onions and vegetables;
  there two men forced a passage with blows of their sticks, and behind them a
  stately train of camels brought in from the uplands their loads of dates. A
  Riffian sauntered by with an indifferent air, his silver-mounted gun upon his
  back, a pair of pistols in his belt, and a great coarse tail of hair swinging
  between his shoulders. He needed no couriers to prepare his way. At one spot
  a serpent-charmer thrust out his tongue, from which a snake was hanging by
  the fangs; at another a story-teller, vivid in narration, and of an
  extraordinary aptness in his gestures, held an audience enchained. From every
  side the din of human voices rose into the air, and to the din was added the
  snarling of camels, the braying of donkeys, the bleating of sheep, the lowing
  of oxen, and all manner of squeals and grunts, so that it seemed the whole
  brute creation had combined to make one discordant orchestra.</p>

  <p>Into this Babel Charnock descended.</p>

  <p>"Those are the shoemakers," said Hamet. He pointed to a cluster of tiny
  grimed gunny-bag tents in a corner of the highest part of the Sôk. In the
  doorways of the tents a few men sat cobbling; one or two wood fires crackled
  in the intervals between the tents; and in close proximity a dead mule took
  its last unsavoury sleep.</p>

  <p>"Hassan Akbar sleeps in the mud near to the tents," continued Hamet.
  "Every evening he comes down to the Sôk, buys milk and bread from the
  shoemakers, and sleeps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Near to that mule!" interrupted Charnock. "And he was the richest man in
  all Tangier."</p>

  <p>A moment later there was shown to him the second picture which he was to
  carry away from Tangier. Down the Sôk, through the crowd, came the Moor, in
  his spotless robes, and a few yards behind him, striding swiftly and
  noiselessly, the blind gaunt beggar of the cemetery gate followed upon his
  trail. In and out amongst the shifting groups he threaded and wound, and
  never erred in his pursuit. The man in whose track he kept never spoke when
  all were shouting, yet Hassan never faltered. The sound of his footsteps was
  lost in a multitude of the like sounds, yet Hassan was somehow sensible of
  it, somehow to his ears it emerged distinct.</p>

  <p>Charnock was amazed; in a way too he was chilled. It seemed uncanny that
  this sightless creature of the impassive face should be able to follow,
  follow, follow relentlessly, unswervingly, one silent man amongst the noisy
  hundreds. Charnock walked for a few yards by Hassan Akbar's side, keeping
  pace with him. Even with his eyes fixed upon the Moor in front, even though
  he saw his feet tread the ground, he could not distinguish his footfalls. How
  then could Hassan?</p>

  <p>Tracker and Tracked passed from the Sôk under the archway of the gate, and
  Charnock dismissing Hamet walked down towards his hotel near the waterside.
  However, he missed his road. He turned through the horse market, descended
  the steep street, past the great Mosque, and walked along a narrow, crooked
  alley between blank and yellow walls, which ended in a tunnel beneath
  over-arching houses. Almost within the mouth of this tunnel there was a shop,
  or so it seemed, for a stuffed jackal swung above the door as a sign. Before
  this shop Charnock halted with a thrill of excitement. The door of the shop
  was shut, the unglazed window was shuttered. It was not on that account that
  Charnock stopped; but underneath the shuttered window, his head almost
  touching the sill, Hassan squatted on the cobbles fingering now and then a
  silver dollar.</p>

  <p>Inside the door a bolt grated, the door opened, and a stout, undersized
  European appeared in the entrance, polished a pair of glasses, set them upon
  his nose, glanced up and down the street, closed the door behind him, and
  taking no heed whatever of the blind man under his window, walked briskly
  into the tunnel. He walked with a short, tripping, and jaunty step.</p>

  <p>Charnock waited while the echo of it diminished and ceased, and the moment
  it had ceased he saw Hassan, without any hurry, without any sign of
  expectation or excitement, rise slowly to his feet and move along the house
  wall towards the door. His right elbow scraped the plaster; then his elbow
  touched nothing. He had come to the recess of the door, and he stopped.</p>

  <p>It flashed upon Charnock that he had not heard the bolt again grate into
  its socket. The door was then only latched and&mdash;was Hassan's quarry
  behind its panels?</p>

  <p>The affair had ceased to be a toy with which Charnock's imagination could
  idly play. He strode across the alley and planted himself face to face with
  Hassan. Hassan quietly and immediately murmured a request for alms and
  stretched out his left hand, a supple, corded hand, with long sinuous
  fingers, a hand of great strength. But as he spoke he drew within the recess
  of the door, and Charnock noticed his right hand steal up the panels feeling
  for the latch.</p>

  <p>Made by this seemingly passionless and apathetic man, the secret movement
  shocked Charnock. It seemed to him at that moment so cold-blooded as to be
  almost inhuman.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" he shouted through the door and in broad English, forgetting
  that the man for whom his warning was intended was a Moor. But the warning
  had its effect. There was a heavy blow upon the door, as though a man's
  shoulder lurched against it, and then the bolt grated into the socket. Hassan
  Akbar walked on repeating his prayer for alms, as if his hand had never for
  an instant stolen up the panel and felt for the latch.</p>

  <p>Charnock, to make his warning the more complete, rapped on the door for
  admission, once, twice, thrice. But he got no answer. He leaned his ear to
  the panel. He could detect not so much as a foot stirring. Absolute silence
  reigned in that dark and shuttered room.</p>

  <p>Charnock walked back to his hotel. On the way he passed the end of the
  pier, where he saw the little Frenchman bargaining with the owner of a
  felucca. His excitement gradually died down. It occurred to him that there
  might have been no grounds at all for any excitement. Hassan Akbar might have
  been following through the Sôk by mere accident. He might have tried the door
  in pursuit of nothing more than alms; and in a little the whole incident
  ceased to trouble his speculations. He crossed the Straits to Gibraltar the
  next morning, and waited there for two days until the P. and O. came in. It
  was on the P. and O. that he first fell in with Major Wilbraham.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <h3>TREATS OF A GENTLEMAN WITH AN AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE,<br>
  AND OF A WOMAN'S FACE IN A MIRROR</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MAJOR AMBROSE WILBRAHAM had embarked at Marseilles, and
  before the boat reached Gibraltar he had made the acquaintance of everyone on
  board, and had managed to exchange cards with a good many. The steamer was
  still within sight of Gibraltar when he introduced himself to Charnock with a
  manner of effusive jocularity to which Charnock did not respond. The Major
  was tall and about forty years of age. A thin crop of black hair was
  plastered upon his head; he wore a moustache which was turning grey; his
  eyebrows were so faultlessly regular that they seemed to have been stencilled
  on his forehead, and underneath them a pair of cold beady eyes counterfeited
  friendliness. Charnock could not call to mind that he had ever met a man on
  whom geniality sat with so ill a grace, or one whose acquaintance he less
  desired to improve.</p>

  <p>Major Wilbraham, however, was not easily rebuffed, and he walked the deck
  by Charnock's side, talkative and unabashed.</p>

  <p>Off the coast of Portugal the boat made bad weather, and she laboured
  through the cross-seas of the Bay under a strong south-westerly wind. Off
  Ushant she picked up a brigantine which Charnock watched from the hurricane
  deck without premonition, and indeed without more than a passing
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Fine lines, eh, Charnock old fellow!" said a voice at his elbow.</p>

  <p>The brigantine dipped her head into a roller, lifted it, and shook the
  water off her decks in a cascade of snow.</p>

  <p>"I have seen none finer," answered Charnock, "except on a racing-yacht or
  a destroyer."</p>

  <p>"She's almost familiar to me," speculated the Major.</p>

  <p>"She reminds me of some boats I saw once at the West Indies," returned
  Charnock, "built for the fruit-trade, and so built for speed. Only they were
  schooners&mdash;from Salcombe, I believe. The Salcombe clippers they were
  called."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said the Major, with a sharp interest, and he leaned forward
  over the rail. "Now I wonder what her name is."</p>

  <p>Charnock held a pair of binoculars in his hand. He gave them to the Major.
  Wilbraham raised them to his eyes while the P. and O. closed upon the
  sailing-boat. The brigantine slid down the slope of a wave and hoisted her
  stern.</p>

  <p>"The 'Tarifa,'" said the Major, and he shut up the binoculars. "What is
  her tonnage, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"About three hundred, I should say."</p>

  <p>"My notion precisely. Would it be of any advantage to alter her rig,
  supposing that she was one of the Salcombe schooners?"</p>

  <p>"I should hardly think so," replied Charnock. "I rather understood that
  the schooners were noted boats."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's interesting," said Wilbraham, and he returned the binoculars.
  The steamer was now abreast of the brigantine, and in a little it drew
  ahead.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Charnock, I shall hope to see more of you," resumed Major
  Wilbraham. "I haven't given you a card, have I?"</p>

  <p>He produced a well-worn card-case.</p>

  <p>"It's very kind of you," said Charnock, as he twirled the card between his
  forefinger and his thumb. "Don't you," he added, "find cards rather a heavy
  item in your expenses?"</p>

  <p>Major Wilbraham laughed noisily.</p>

  <p>"I take you, dear friend," he exclaimed, "I take you. But a friend in this
  world, sir, is a golden thread in a very dusty cobweb."</p>

  <p>"But the friendship is rather a one-sided arrangement," rejoined Charnock.
  "For instance, the cards you give, Major Wilbraham, bear no address, the
  cards you receive, do." And while showing the card to his companion, he
  inadvertently dropped it into the sea.</p>

  <p>Major Wilbraham blamed the negligence of a rascally printer, and made his
  way to the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>The P. and O. boat touched at Plymouth the next morning, and landed both
  Major Wilbraham and Charnock. The latter remained in Plymouth for two days,
  and on the morning of the third day hired a hansom cab, and so met with the
  last of those incidents which were to link him in such close, strange ties
  with the fortunes of men and women who even in name were then utterly unknown
  to him.</p>

  <p>A yellow handbill had led Charnock across the Straits to Tangier, and now
  it was nothing more serious than a draft upon Lloyd's bank which took him in
  a hansom cab through the streets of Plymouth. Spring was in the air; Charnock
  felt exceedingly light-hearted and cheerful. On the way he unconsciously
  worked his little finger into the eye of the brass bracket which juts inwards
  on each side of the front window at the level of the shoulder; and when the
  cab stopped in front of the bank he discovered that his finger was securely
  jammed.</p>

  <p>Across the road he noticed a chemist's shop, and descending the steps of
  the bank a fair-haired gentleman of an agreeable countenance, who, quite
  appropriately in that town of sailors, had something of a nautical
  aspect.</p>

  <p>"Sir," began Charnock, politely, as he leaned out of the window, "I shall
  be much obliged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>To Charnock's surprise the good-natured gentleman precipitately sprang
  down the steps and began to walk rapidly away. Charnock was sufficiently
  human and therefore sufficiently perverse to become at once convinced that
  although there were others passing, this reluctant man was the only person in
  the world who could and must help him from his predicament.</p>

  <p>So he leaned yet farther out of the cab.</p>

  <p>"Hi, you sir!" he shouted, "you who are running away!"</p>

  <p>The words had an electrical effect. The man of the agreeable countenance
  stopped suddenly, and so stood with his back towards Charnock while gently
  and thoughtfully he nodded his head. It seemed to Charnock that he might
  perhaps be counting over the voices with which he was familiar.</p>

  <p>"Well," cried Charnock, who was becoming exasperated, "my dear sir, am I
  to wait for you all day?"</p>

  <p>The street was populous with the morning traffic of a business quarter.
  Curious people stopped and attracted others. In a very few moments a small
  crowd would have formed. The stranger thereupon came slowly back to the
  hansom, showing a face which was no longer agreeable. He set a foot upon the
  step of the cab, and fixed a blue and watchful eye upon Charnock.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said the latter, with severity, "that my first impression
  of you was wrong."</p>

  <p>An indescribable relief was expressed by the other, but he spoke with
  surliness.</p>

  <p>"You mistook me for someone else?"</p>

  <p>"I mistook your disposition for something else," Charnock affably
  corrected. "I expected to find you a person of great good-nature."</p>

  <p>"You hardly made such a point of summoning a perfect stranger," and here
  the blue eyes became very wary, "for no other reason than to tell him
  that."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," returned Charnock; "I would not trespass upon your time,
  which seems to be extremely valuable, without a better reason. But my finger
  is fixed, as you can see, in this brass ring, and I cannot withdraw it. So if
  you would kindly cross over to the chemist and buy me a pennyworth of
  vaseline, I shall be more than obliged." And with the hand which was free he
  felt in his pocket for a penny and held it out.</p>

  <p>A look of utter incredulity showed upon the listener's face.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me&mdash;" he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"That I ask you to be my good Samaritan? Yes."</p>

  <p>The stranger's face became suddenly vindictive. "Vaseline!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"A pennyworth," said Charnock, again offering the penny.</p>

  <p>The man of the agreeable countenance struck Charnock's hand violently
  aside, and the penny flew into a gutter. He stood up on the step and thrust
  his face, which was now inflamed with fury, into the cab.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what," he cried, "you are a fair red-hotter, you are. Buy you
  vaseline! I hope your finger will petrify. I hope you'll just sit in that cab
  and rot away in your boots, until you have to ante up in kingdom come." He
  added expletives to his anathema.</p>

  <p>"Really," said Charnock, "if I was a lady I don't think that I should like
  to listen to you any longer."</p>

  <p>But before Charnock had finished the sentence, the good Samaritan, who was
  no Samaritan at all, had flung himself from the cab and was striding up the
  street.</p>

  <p>"After all," thought Charnock, "I might just as well have driven across to
  the chemist, if I had only thought of it."</p>

  <p>This he now did, got his finger free, cashed his draft, and took the train
  to London.</p>

  <p>During this journey the discourteous stranger occupied some part of his
  thoughts. Between Charnock's eyes and the newspaper, against the red cliffs
  of Teignmouth, on the green of the home counties, his face obtruded, and for
  a particular reason. The marks of fear are unmistakable. The man whom he had
  called, had been scared by the call, nor had his fear quite left him when he
  had come face to face with Charnock. Set features which strove to conceal,
  and a brightness of the eye which betrayed emotion, these things Charnock
  remembered very clearly.</p>

  <p>In London he dined alone at his hotel, and over against him the stranger's
  face bore him company. He went out afterwards into the street, and amidst the
  myriad ringing feet, was seized with an utter sense of loneliness, more
  poignant, more complete, than he had ever experienced in the waste places of
  the world. The lights of a theatre attracted him. He paid his money, took a
  seat in the stalls, and was at once very worried and perplexed. He turned to
  his neighbour, who was boisterously laughing.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me what this play is?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a musical comedy."</p>

  <p>"I see. But what is it about?"</p>

  <p>Charnock's neighbour scratched his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I ought to remember," he said, "for I saw the piece early in the
  run."</p>

  <p>Charnock went out, crossed a street, and came to another theatre, where he
  saw a good half of the tragedy of <i>Macbeth</i>. Thence he returned to his
  hotel and went to bed.</p>

  <p>The hotel was one of many balconies, situated upon the Embankment. From
  the single window or his bedroom Charnock looked across the river to where
  the name of a brewery perpetually wrote itself in red brilliant letters which
  perpetually vanished. It was his habit to sleep not merely with his window
  open, but with the blinds drawn up and the curtains looped back, and these
  arrangements he made as usual before he got into bed.</p>

  <p>Now, the looking-glass stood upon a dressing-table in the window, with its
  back towards the window-panes; and since the night was moonless and dark,
  this mirror, it should be remembered, reflected nothing of the room or its
  furniture, but presented only to the view of Charnock, as he lay in bed, a
  surface of a black sheen.</p>

  <p>Charnock recurred to his adventure of the morning, and thus the abusive
  stranger was in his thoughts when he fell asleep. He figured also in his
  dreams.</p>

  <p>For, after he had fallen asleep, a curtain was raised upon a fantastic
  <i>revue</i> of the past week. Hassan Akbar strode quickly and noiselessly
  behind his quarry, tracking him by some inappreciable faculty, not through
  the muddy Sôk, but across the polished floor of the ball-room in the musical
  comedy. Again Charnock shouted "Look out!" and the Moor with one bound leapt
  from the ball-room, which was now become a landing-stage, into a felucca. The
  crew of the felucca, it now appeared, was made up of Charnock, Lady Macbeth,
  and Hassan Akbar, and by casting lots with counters made of vaseline,
  Charnock was appointed to hold the tiller. This duty compelled extraordinary
  care, for the felucca would keep changing its rig and the bulk of its hull
  swelled and dwindled. At last, to Charnock's intense relief, the boat settled
  into a Salcombe clipper with the rig of a P. and O., but with immeasurably
  greater speed, so that within a very few seconds they sailed over a limitless
  ocean and anchored at Tangier. At once the crew entirely vanished. Charnock
  was not distressed, because he saw a hansom cab waiting for him at the
  Customs, though how the hansom was to pass up those narrow cobbled streets he
  could not think. That however was the driver's business.</p>

  <p>"I hope your horse is good," said Charnock, springing into the cab.</p>

  <p>"She comes of the great Red-hotter stock," replied the cabman, and lifting
  the trap in the roof he showered packets of visiting cards, which fell about
  Charnock like flakes of snow.</p>

  <p>Charnock had not previously noticed that the cabman was Major
  Wilbraham.</p>

  <p>The cab shot up the hill through the tunnel, past the closed shop. A
  figure sprang from the ground and thrust a face through the window of the
  cab. The man was in Moorish dress, but the face was the face of the abusive
  stranger of Plymouth&mdash;and all at once Charnock started up on his elbow,
  and in the smallest fraction of a second was intensely and vividly awake.
  There was no sound at all within the room. But in the black sheen of the
  mirror he saw a woman's face.</p>

  <p>He saw it quite clearly for perhaps five seconds, the face rising white
  from the white column of the throat, the dark and weighty coronal of the
  hair, the curved lips which alone had any colour, the eyes, deep and
  troubled, which seemed to hint a prayer for help which they disdained to
  make&mdash;for five seconds perhaps the illusion remained, for five seconds
  the face looked out at him from the black mirror, lit palely, as it seemed,
  by its own pallor, and so vanished.</p>

  <p>Charnock remained propped upon his elbow. A faint twilight from the stars
  crept timidly through the open window as though deprecating its intrusion.
  Charnock looked into the dark corners of the room, but nowhere did the
  darkness move. Nor could he hear any sound. Not even a board of the floor
  cracked, and outside the door there was no noise of a footstep on the stairs.
  Then from a great distance the jingle of a cab came through the open window
  to his ears with a light companionable lilt. Gradually the sound ceased, and
  again the silence breathed about him. Charnock struck a match and looked at
  his watch. It was a few minutes after three.</p>

  <p>Charnock lay back in his bed wondering. For he had seen that face once, he
  had once exchanged glances with those eyes, once only, six years ago, and
  thereafter had entirely forgotten the incident&mdash;until this moment. He
  had stopped for a night at Monte Carlo and had seen&mdash;the girl&mdash;yes,
  the <i>girl</i>, though it was a woman's face which had gleamed in the depths
  of his mirror&mdash;standing under the green shaded lamps in the big
  gambling-room. His attention, he now remembered, had been seized by the
  contrast between her amused indifference and the feverish haste of the
  gamblers about the table; between her fresh, clear looks and their heated
  complexions,&mdash;even between her frock of lilac silk and their more
  elaborate toilettes. The girl was entirely happy then, the red lips smiled,
  the violet eyes laughed. Why should her face appear to him now, after these
  years, and paled by this distress?</p>

  <p>A queer fancy slipped into his mind&mdash;a fancy at the extravagance of
  which he knew very well he should laugh in the sane light of the morning,
  though he indulged it now&mdash;that somehow, somewhere, this woman needed
  help, and that it was thus vouchsafed to her, a stranger, to make her appeal
  to him in this way, which spared her the humiliation of making any appeal at
  all. Charnock fell asleep convinced that somehow, somewhere, he was destined
  to meet and know her. As he had foreseen, he laughed at his fancies in the
  morning, but nevertheless, he did meet her. It had, in fact, already been
  arranged that he should. For the face which he saw in the mirror was the face
  of Miranda Warriner.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <h3>TREATS OF THE FIRST MEETING BETWEEN CHARNOCK AND MIRANDA</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LADY DONNISTHORPE, with a sigh of relief, retired from her
  position at the head of the stairs, and catching Charnock in the interval
  between two dances:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You kept some dances free," she said, "didn't you? I want to introduce
  you to a cousin of mine, Miranda Warriner, because she lives at Ronda."</p>

  <p>"At Ronda. Indeed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Her ladyship added with a magnificent air of indifference, "She is
  a widow," and she led Charnock across the ball-room.</p>

  <p>Miranda saw them approaching, noticed an indefinable air of expectation in
  Lady Donnisthorpe's manner, and smiled. A few excessively casual remarks
  concerning one Mr. Charnock, which Lady Donnisthorpe had dropped during the
  last few days, had not escaped the notice of Miranda, who was aware of her
  cousin's particular weakness. This was undoubtedly Mr. Charnock. She raised
  her eyes towards him, and had her ladyship been less fluttered, she might
  have remarked that Miranda's eyes lit up with a momentary sparkle of
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Warriner&mdash;Mr. Charnock."</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe effected the momentous introduction and felt immediately
  damped. She had not indeed expected that her two newest victims would at once
  and publicly embrace. But at all events she had decked out her ball-room as
  the sacrificial altar, and had taken care that a fitting company and cheerful
  music should do credit to the immolation. This tame indifference was less
  than she deserved.</p>

  <p>Miranda, to whom Lady Donnisthorpe was looking, made the perfunctory dip
  of the head and smiled the perfunctory smile, and Charnock&mdash;why in the
  world did he not move or speak? Lady Donnisthorpe turned her eyes from
  Miranda to this awkward cavalier, and was restored to a radiant good-humour.
  "Dazzled," she said to herself, "absolutely dazzled!" For Charnock stood
  rooted to the ground and tongue-tied with amazement.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for Lady Donnisthorpe that at this point she thought it
  wise to withdraw. Otherwise she would surely have remarked an unmistakable
  look of disappointment which grew within Charnock's eyes and spread out over
  his face. Then the disappointment vanished, and as he compared programmes
  with Miranda, he recovered his speech.</p>

  <p>Four dances must intervene before he could claim her, and Charnock was
  glad of the interval to get the better of his bewilderment. Here was the
  woman whom his mirror had shown to him! After all, his nocturnal fancy was
  fulfilled, or rather part of it, only part or it. He had met her, he was to
  dance with her. Some miracle had brought them together. From the corner by
  the doorway he watched Miranda, he remarked an unaffected friendliness in her
  manner towards her partners. Candour was written upon her broad white
  forehead and looked out from her clear eyes. He had no doubt it was fragrant
  too in her hair. There were heavy masses of that hair, as he knew very well
  from his mirror, but now the masses were piled and woven about her head with
  a cunning art, which to be sure they deserved. There was a ripple in her
  hair, too, which caught the light&mdash;a most taking ripple. Here was a
  woman divested of a girl's wiles and vanities. Charnock, without a scruple,
  aspersed all girls up to the age of say twenty-four, that he might give her
  greater praise.</p>

  <p>He fell to wondering, not how it was that her face had appeared to him,
  nor by what miracle he was now enabled to have knowledge of her, but rather
  by what miracle of forgetfulness he had allowed her face, after he had seen
  it that one time six years ago, ever to slip from his thoughts, or her eyes
  after that one time he had exchanged a glance with them.</p>

  <p>The whirl of the dance carried her by his corner. She swung past him with
  the lightest imaginable step, and he was suddenly struck through and through
  with a chilling apprehension that by some unconscionable maladroitness he
  would surely tread upon her toes.</p>

  <p>At once he proceeded to count over the dances in which he had borne
  himself with credit. He had danced with Spanish women, he assured himself,
  and they had not objected. He was thus consoling himself when the time came
  for him to lead her out. And the touch of her hand in his, he remembers,
  turned him into a babbling idiot.</p>

  <p>He recollects that they danced with great celerity; that they passed Lady
  Donnisthorpe, who smiled at him with great encouragement, and that he was
  dolefully humorous concerning Major Wilbraham and his exchanges of cards,
  though why Major Wilbraham should have thrust his bald head into the
  conversation, he was ever at a loss to discover. And then Miranda said,
  "Shall we stop?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't, did I?" exclaimed the horror-stricken Charnock, as he
  looked downwards at her toes.</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't," Miranda assured him with a laugh. "Do you usually?"</p>

  <p>"No," he declared vehemently, "believe me, no! Never, upon my word! I have
  danced with Spanish women,&mdash;not at
  all,&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>And they laughed suddenly each to the other, and in a moment they were
  friends. Conversation came easily to their tongues, and underneath the
  surface of their light talk, the deeps of character called steadily like to
  like.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you once before, Mrs. Warriner," said Charnock, as they
  seated themselves in an alcove of the room.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she returned promptly, "at Monte Carlo, six years ago," and her
  face lost its look of enjoyment and darkened with some shadow from her
  memories. The change was, however, unremarked by Charnock.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange," he said in an absent voice, "that we should meet first
  of all in a gambling-room, and the next time at a ball."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The question could not be answered. Charnock had a real but inexplicable
  feeling that Miranda and he should have met somewhere amidst the grandeur of
  open spaces, in the centre of the Sahara, and for the moment he forgot to
  calculate the effect of the sand upon Miranda's eyes. This feeling, however,
  he could hardly express at the present point of their acquaintanceship; and,
  indeed, he immediately ceased to be aware of it.</p>

  <p>"Do you actually remember our meeting in that way six years ago?" he
  exclaimed. "How wonderful of you!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" again asked Mrs. Warriner. "Why is it wonderful, since you remember
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I didn't remember it until"&mdash;he paused for a second or
  two&mdash;"until I saw your face in a looking-glass."</p>

  <p>Miranda glanced at him in considerable perplexity. Then she said with a
  demure smile, "I have at times seen it there myself."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," he replied with a glance at the cunning arrangement of her
  hair.</p>

  <p>"My maid does that," said she, biting her lip.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, but you sit in front of the glass at the time. You're in the
  room," he continued hastily; "but when I saw your face in my mirror, you
  couldn't be. I was in bed,&mdash;I mean,&mdash;let me tell you!" He stopped,
  overwhelmed with embarrassment. Miranda, with an air of complete
  unconsciousness, carefully buttoned her glove; only the glove was already
  buttoned, and her mouth twitched slightly at the corners.</p>

  <p>"It was just a week ago to-day," Charnock began again. "I got home to my
  hotel late."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" murmured Mrs. Warriner, as though the whole mystery was now
  explained to her.</p>

  <p>"I assure you," he retorted with emphasis, "that I dined in the train and
  drank nothing more serious than railway claret."</p>

  <p>"I made no accusation whatever," Miranda blandly remarked, and seemed very
  well pleased.</p>

  <p>"After I had fallen asleep, I began to dream, but not about you, Mrs.
  Warriner; that's the strange feature of the business. It wasn't that I had
  been thinking of you that evening, or indeed, that I had ever been at all in
  the habit of thinking&mdash;" Again Charnock was utterly confused. "I don't
  seem to be telling the story with the best taste in the world, do I?" he said
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," she said in a soothing voice.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I could have turned it into a compliment," he continued. "Only
  I take it you have no taste for compliments, and I lack the experience to put
  them tactfully."</p>

  <p>"For a novice," said she, "you seem to be doing very well." Charnock
  resumed his story. "I dreamt solely of people I had seen, and incidents I had
  witnessed during the last week, at Tangier and at Plymouth. I dreamed
  particularly of a man I quarrelled with at Plymouth, and I suddenly woke up
  and saw your face in the mirror."</p>

  <p>"As you fancied."</p>

  <p>"It was no fancy. It was no dream-face that I saw&mdash;dream-faces are
  always elusive. It was no dream-face, it was yours."</p>

  <p>"Or one like mine."</p>

  <p>"There cannot be two."</p>

  <p>"For a novice," repeated Miranda, with a smile, "you <i>are</i> doing very
  well."</p>

  <p>Charnock had watched her carefully while he told his story, on the chance
  that her looks, if not her lips, might give him some clue to the
  comprehension of his mysterious vision. But she had expressed merely an
  unconcerned curiosity and some amusement.</p>

  <p>"Shall I explain your vision?" said she. "You must have seen me in London
  during the day: the recollection that you had seen me must have lain latent,
  so that when you woke up you saw me in your mirror and did not remember that
  you had seen me during the day."</p>

  <p>"Were you at any theatre this day week?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Miranda, after counting over the days.</p>

  <p>"You did not see <i>Macbeth</i> that night?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then it is impossible I should have seen you. For I came up from Plymouth
  only that afternoon. I drove from Paddington to my hotel; from the hotel I
  went to the theatre; from the theatre I walked back to the hotel. It is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"It is very strange," said Miranda, whose interest was increasing, and
  whose sense of amusement had vanished; for she saw that her companion was
  moved by something more than curiosity. It was evident to her from his urgent
  tones, from the eagerness of his face, that he had some hidden reason for his
  desire to fathom the mystery. It seemed to her that he nourished some
  intention, some purpose in the back of his mind, which depended for
  fulfilment upon whether or no there was any feasible solution.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your dream," she said.</p>

  <p>"It was the oddest jumble,&mdash;it had neither sense nor continuity.
  Moors figured in it, ships, Lady Macbeth, the Major with his card-case, and
  the stranger who swore at me through the cab-window at Plymouth. The phrases
  that man used came into it."</p>

  <p>"What phrases?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't repeat to you the most eloquent. There were milder ones,
  however. He called me a fair red-hotter amongst other things," said Charnock,
  laughing at his recollections, "and expressed a wish that I might&mdash;well,
  sit in that cab until I ante'd up in kingdom come."</p>

  <p>Miranda leaned back in her seat and opened and shut her fan. "He was a
  stranger to you, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>"You are sure?"</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>"You had never seen him anywhere&mdash;anywhere? Think!"</p>

  <p>Charnock deliberated for a few seconds. "Never anywhere," he replied.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Mrs. Warriner gently fanned herself as she
  leaned back in the shadow of the alcove. "Describe him to me," she said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"A man of a slight figure, a little under the middle height, fair hair,
  bright blue eyes, an open, good-natured face, and I should say a year or so
  under forty. I took him to be a sailor."</p>

  <p>The fan stopped. Miranda let it fall upon her lap. That was the only
  movement which she made, and from the shadow of the recess, she said: "There
  is no explanation."</p>

  <p>Charnock drew a breath and leaned forward, his hands clasped, his elbows
  on his knees. It seemed he had been waiting for just that one sentence. As he
  sat now his face was in the light, and Miranda remarked a certain timidity
  upon it, as though now that he had heard the expected words, he dared not
  after all reply to them. He did not look towards her. He stared at the
  dancers, but with vacant eyes. He saw nothing of their jewels, or their
  coloured robes, or the flash of their silver feet, and the noise of their
  chatter sounded very dimly in his ears. He was quite occupied, indeed, with
  the hardihood of what he had it on his tongue's tip to say&mdash;when he had
  gained sufficient courage.</p>

  <p>Miranda moved restlessly, unbuttoned a glove, drew it off her wrist
  unconsciously, and then was still as Charnock began to speak.</p>

  <p>"Is there no explanation?" he asked. "I imagined one. You know how fancies
  come to one in the dark. That night I imagined one. I laughed at it the next
  morning, but now, since I have talked with you, I have been wondering whether
  by any miracle, it might be true. And if there's an infinitesimal chance that
  it's true, I think that I ought to tell you it, even though it may seem
  merely ridiculous, even though it may offend you. But I have lived for the
  most part of my time, since I was a man, in the waste places of the earth,
  and what may well be an impertinence&mdash;for we are only these few minutes
  acquainted&mdash;you will perhaps pardon on that account."</p>

  <p>He received no encouragement to continue; on the other hand he received no
  warning to stop, for Miranda neither spoke nor moved. He did not look at her
  face lest he should read the warning there; but from the tail of his eye, he
  could see the fan, the white glove lying idle upon the black satin of her
  dress. The skirt hung from her knee to her foot without a stir in its folds,
  nor did her foot stir where it showed beneath the hem. She remained in a pose
  of most enigmatical quietude.</p>

  <p>"The face which my mirror showed to me," he went on, "was your face, as I
  said; but in expression it was not your face as I see it to-night. It was
  very troubled, it was very pale; the eyes haunted me because of the pain in
  them, and because of&mdash;something else beside. It was a tortured face I
  saw, and the eyes seemed to ask&mdash;but to ask proudly&mdash;for help. Is
  it plain, the explanation which occurred to me?" His voice sank; he went on,
  slowly choosing every word with care, and speaking it with hesitation. "I
  imagined that out of all the millions of women in the world, here was one who
  needed help&mdash;my help, who was allowed to appeal to me for it, without,
  if you understand, making any appeal at all, and the explanation was not ...
  unpleasant ... to a man who lives much alone. In fact it has been so
  pleasant, and has become so familiar during this last week, that when I saw
  you to-night without a care, just as I saw you that night at Monte Carlo,"
  and indeed it seemed to Charnock that the black dress she wore alone marked
  the passage of those six years,&mdash;"I am ashamed to say that I was
  disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miranda. "I noticed the disappointment, but there's a simpler
  explanation of the troubled face than yours. You had been to
  <i>Macbeth</i>that evening; Lady Macbeth played a part in your dreams. What
  if Lady Macbeth lent her pallor and her distress to the face which you saw in
  your mirror?"</p>

  <p>Charnock swung abruptly round towards her. It was not the explanation
  which surprised him, but the altered voice she used. And if her voice
  surprised him, he was shocked and startled by her looks. She was still
  leaning back in the shadow of the alcove, and her head rested against the
  dark wood-panels. She did not move when he looked towards her.</p>

  <p>"My God," he said in a hushed and trembling whisper, and she gave no sign
  that she heard. She might have fainted, but that her eyes glittered out of
  the shadow straight and steadily into his. She might be dead from the
  whiteness of her face against the panels, but that her bosom rose and
  fell.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she replied, and rose to her feet. "Here is Lady Donnisthorpe."
  She walked abruptly past him across the room to the open window. Charnock
  remained nailed to the ground, following her with his eyes. For in that
  alcove, leaning against the dark panels, he had seen not merely the features,
  but the expression on the features, he had seen exact in every detail the
  face which he had seen in the polished darkness of his mirror. The sheen of
  the dark polished panels helped the illusion. His fancy had come true, was
  transmuted into fact. Somewhere, somehow, he was to meet that woman. He had
  met her here and in this way, and her eyes and her face uttered her distress
  as with a piercing cry. Her eyes! The resemblance was perfect to the last
  detail. For Charnock ventured to surmise in them the same involuntary appeal
  which he had seen in the eyes that had looked out from his mirror. What then
  if the rest were true? What if his explanation was as true as the true facts
  which it explained? What if it was given to him and to her to stand apart
  from their fellows in this mysterious relation?...</p>

  <p>He saw that Miranda was already near the window, that Lady Donnisthorpe
  was approaching him. He followed instantly in Miranda's steps, and Lady
  Donnisthorpe, perceiving his attention, had the complaisance to turn aside.
  For the window opened on to a balcony wherein discreet palms sheltered off a
  nook. There was one of Lady Donnisthorpe's guests who did not share her
  ladyship's complacency. A censorious dowager sitting near to the window had
  kept an alert eye upon the couple in the recess during the last three dances;
  and each time that her daughter&mdash;a pretty girl with hair of the palest
  possible gold, and light blue eyes that were dancing with a child's delight
  at all the wonders of a first season&mdash;returned to the shelter of her
  portly frame, the dowager drew moral lessons for her benefit from the text of
  the oblivious couple. She remarked with pain upon their increasing
  infatuation for each other; she pointed out to her daughter a hapless youth
  who tiptoed backwards and forwards before Mrs. Warriner, with a dance-card in
  his hand, too timorous to interrupt the intimate conversation; and when Mrs.
  Warriner dropped a glove as she stepped over the window-sill on to the
  balcony, the dowager nudged her daughter with an elbow.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mabel, there's a coquette," she said.</p>

  <p>Charnock was close behind, and overheard the triumphant remark.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said politely, "it was the purest accident."</p>

  <p>The dowager bridled; her face grew red; she raised her tortoiseshell
  glasses and annihilated Charnock with a single stare. Charnock had the
  audacity to smile. He stooped and picked up the glove. Mrs. Warriner had
  indeed dropped the glove by accident; but since it fell in Charnock's way and
  since he picked it up, it was to prove, like the handbill at Gibraltar and
  the draft on Lloyd's bank, a thing trivial in itself, but the opportunity of
  strange events.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <h3>WHEREIN CHARNOCK AND MIRANDA IMPROVE THEIR ACQUAINTANCESHIP IN A
  BALCONY</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LADY DONNISTHORPE'S house stood in Queen Anne's Gate, and
  the balcony overlooked St. James's Park. There Charnock found Miranda; he
  leaned his elbows upon the iron balustrade, and for a while neither of them
  spoke. It was a clear night of early June, odorous with messages of hedgerows
  along country lanes and uplands of young grass, and of bells ringing over
  meadows. In front of them the dark trees of the Park rippled and whispered to
  the stray breaths of wind; between the trees one line of colourless lamps
  marked the footpath across the bridge to the Mall; and the carriages on the
  outer roadway ringed that enclosure of thickets and lawns with flitting
  sparks of fire.</p>

  <p>Charnock was still holding the glove which he had picked up on the
  window-sill.</p>

  <p>"That's mine," said Miranda; "thank you," and she stretched out her hand
  for it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Charnock, absently, and he drew the glove through his fingers.
  It was a delicate trifle of white kid; he smoothed it, and his hand had the
  light touch of a caress. "Miranda," he said softly but distinctly, and
  lingered on the word as though the sound pleased him.</p>

  <p>Miranda started and then sank back again in her chair with a quiet smile.
  Very likely she blushed at this familiar utterance of her name, and at the
  caressing movement of his hand which accompanied and perhaps interpreted the
  utterance, or perhaps it was only at a certain throb of her own heart that
  she blushed. At all events, the darkness concealed the blush, and Charnock
  was not looking in her direction.</p>

  <p>The freshness of the night air had restored her, but she was very willing
  to sit there in silence so long as no questions were asked of her, and
  Charnock had rather the air of one who works out a private problem for
  himself than one who seeks the answer from another.</p>

  <p>The clock upon Westminster tower boomed the hour of twelve. Miranda
  noticed that Charnock raised his head and listened to the twelve heavy
  strokes with a smile. His manner was that of a man who comes unexpectedly
  upon some memento of an almost forgotten time.</p>

  <p>"That is a familiar sound to you," said Mrs. Warriner, and she was
  suddenly sensible of a great interest in all of the past life of this man who
  was standing beside her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Charnock, turning round to her.</p>

  <p>"You lived in Westminster, then? At one time I used to stay here a good
  deal. Where did you live?"</p>

  <p>Charnock laughed. "You would probably be no wiser if I named the street;
  it is not of those which you and your friends go up and down," he replied
  simply. "Yes, I lived in Westminster for three hard, curious years."</p>

  <p>"It's not only the years that are curious," said Miranda, but the hint was
  lost, for Charnock had turned back to the balustrade. She was still, however,
  inclined to persist. The details which Lady Donnisthorpe had sown in her
  mind, now bore their crop. Interested in the man, now that she knew him, she
  was also interested in his career, in his hurried migratory life, in the
  mystery which enveloped his youth, and all the more because of the contrast
  between her youth and his. He had lived for three years in some small back
  street of Westminster; very likely she had more than once rubbed shoulders
  with him in the streets on the occasions when she had come up from her home
  in Suffolk. That home became instantly very distinct in her memories&mdash;an
  old manor-house guarded by a moat of dark silent water, a house or broad
  red-brick chimneys whereon she had known the roses to bloom on a
  Christmas-day, and of leaded windows upon which the boughs of trees
  continually tapped.</p>

  <p>"I should like to show you my home," she said with a sudden impulse, and
  did not check herself before the words were spoken. "Perhaps some day," she
  continued hurriedly, "you will tell me of those three years you spent in
  Westminster." And she hoped that he had not heard the first sentence of the
  two.</p>

  <p>"I will make an exchange," said Charnock. "I will exchange some day, if
  you will, the history of my three years for the history of your trouble." He
  turned eagerly towards her, but she held up her hand.</p>

  <p>"Please, please!" she said in a low, shaking voice, for her distress had
  come back upon her. She had begun, if not to forget it, at all events to dull
  the remembrance of it since she had come out upon the balcony. She had, in a
  word, sought and found a compensation in the new friendship of this man, and
  a relief in his very <i>naïveté</i>. But he had brought her anxieties back to
  her, as he clearly understood, for he said: "That is the second time this
  evening. I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"The second time?" said Miranda, quickly. "Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Am I wrong?" he asked. "Am I wrong in fearing that I myself have brought
  on you the trouble which I fancied I was to avert? I should be glad to know
  that I was wrong, for since I have stood here on this balcony, that fear has
  been growing. Your face so changed at the story I told you. At what point of
  it I do not know. I was not looking. Did I show you some misfortune you were
  unaware of, and might still be unaware of, if I had only held my tongue? In
  offering to shield you, did I only strike at you? I do not know, I am in the
  dark." He spoke in a voice of intense remorse, pleading for a proof that his
  fear was groundless, and Miranda did not answer him at all. "I do not ask you
  to speak freely now," he continued; "but sometime perhaps you will. You see,
  we shall be neighbours."</p>

  <p>"Neighbours!" exclaimed Miranda, and her lips parted in a smile.</p>

  <p>"You live at Ronda, Lady Donnisthorpe tells me; my headquarters now are at
  Algeciras;" and he told her briefly of his business there.</p>

  <p>"My cousin did not tell me that," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe, in the wisdom of her heart, had, in fact, carefully
  concealed Charnock's place of abode, thinking it best that Miranda should
  learn it from Charnock's lips, and be pleasantly surprised thereby. That
  Miranda was pleasantly surprised might perhaps have been inferred by a more
  experienced man, from the extreme chilliness of her reply.</p>

  <p>"Ronda is at the top," she said, "Algeciras at the bottom, and there are a
  hundred miles of hillside and cork-forest between."</p>

  <p>"There are also," retorted Charnock, "a hundred miles of railway."</p>

  <p>"Shall we go back into the room?" suggested Miranda.</p>

  <p>"If you wish. Only there is something else I am trying to say to you,"
  said Charnock, and at that Miranda laughed, and laughed with a fresh bright
  trill of amusement. It broke suddenly and spontaneously from her lips and
  surprised Charnock, who was at a loss to reconcile it with the signs of her
  distress. He turned towards her. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said hastily, "nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"You wished to go in?"</p>

  <p>"Not now,&mdash;not for the world."</p>

  <p>She was genuinely amused. Her eyes laughed at him in the starlight.
  Charnock was very content at the change in her, though he did not at all
  understand it. It made what he meant to say easier, if he could only find the
  means to say it. He held the means unwittingly in his hand, for he held
  Miranda's glove. It was that glove which provoked her amusement. Charnock,
  with a pertinacity which was only equalled by his absence of mind, was trying
  to force his hand into Mrs. Warriner's glove. He had already succeeded in
  slipping the long sleeve of it over his palm; he was now engaged in the more
  strenuous task of fitting his fingers into its slender fingers, as he leaned
  upon the balcony.</p>

  <p>"You are laughing, no doubt, at my pertinacity, and it is true that our
  acquaintanceship is very slight," said he.</p>

  <p>"In a moment you will irretrievably destroy it," said she, looking at the
  glove.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mean that," he answered sadly, as he smoothed the
  finger-tip of the forefinger down upon his own, and at once proceeded to the
  other fingers. The little finger in particular needed a deal of strenuous
  coaxing, and caused him to break up his words with intervals of physical
  effort. "Because&mdash;as I say&mdash;we shall be
  neighbours&mdash;there!"&mdash;The exclamation "there" meant that he was
  satisfied with the third finger.&mdash;"A hundred miles of hill-side&mdash;in
  a foreign country&mdash;on a map a thumb will cover it."</p>

  <p>"Will it cover a thumb, though?" asked Miranda, who took a feminine
  interest in the durability of her glove. She leaned forward in a delighted
  suspense, as Charnock proceeded to answer her question by experiment.</p>

  <p>"There's the railway too," said he, as he struggled with the thumb of the
  glove, "and as I say, a foreign country. Very likely, we shall be nearer
  neighbours, though you are at Ronda and I am at Algeciras, than if you lived
  in this house and I at the house next door. Because after all there's one
  advantage in trouble of any kind. Trouble is the short foot-path to
  friendship, don't you think? Like that line of lamps across the Park."</p>

  <p>Miranda forgot the glove. She was touched by the deep sincerity of his
  voice, by the modesty of his manner. She rose from her chair and stood by his
  side at the balustrade. "Yes," she answered, looking at the circling lights
  on the outer rim of the Park. "I think that is true. It spares one the long
  carriage-road of ceremonial acquaintanceship. But," she said thoughtfully, "I
  do not know whether after all I shall soon return to Ronda."</p>

  <p>She heard a little sound of something tearing, and there was Charnock
  contemplating in amazement upon his left hand a white kid glove of which the
  kid was ripped across the palm. He felt in his pocket with his right hand and
  drew out both of his own gloves, which he had taken off while he was talking
  in the alcove. Then he looked at Miranda and his amazement became
  remorse.</p>

  <p>"It's yours!" he said. "Of course, I picked it up. I had forgotten even
  that I was holding it. I had no notion that I was putting it on."</p>

  <p>"I gave you fair warning," said Miranda, with a frank laugh, "but you
  would not pay any attention."</p>

  <p>Charnock looked at her with absolute incredulity. "You mean to say that
  you don't mind? You are wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"It seems almost too late to mind," said she, looking at the tattered
  glove.</p>

  <p>"Or to mend," said he, ruefully, drawing it off with extreme care, and as
  a new thought struck him. "Oh!" he exclaimed, "suppose it had belonged to
  anyone else, the dowager in the window, for instance." He dangled the glove
  in the air. "Now that's a lesson!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's a parable," said Miranda, as she took the glove from
  him.</p>

  <p>Charnock saw that she had grown quite serious. "If so," said he, "I cannot
  expound it."</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" The smile had faded from her lips, her eyes shone upon his,
  with no longer a sparkle of merriment, but very still, very grave.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," she said slowly, "shall I say that no man can offer a woman
  his friendship or help without doing her a hurt in some other way?"</p>

  <p>His eyes as steadily answered back to hers. "Do you believe that?" he
  said. He spoke quite simply without raising his voice in any way, but none
  the less Mrs. Warriner was certain that she had but to say "yes," and there
  would be an end, now and forever, of his questions, of his help, of his
  friendship, of everything between them beyond the merest acquaintanceship.
  Perhaps some day they might cross the harbour together in the same ferry from
  Algeciras to Gibraltar, and bow and exchange a careless word, but that would
  be all&mdash;and only that until his work was finished there.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that?"</p>

  <p>She was half tempted to say "yes"; but she had an instinct, a premonition,
  that whatever answer she made would stretch out to unknown and incalculable
  consequences. She seemed to herself to be drawing the lots which one way or
  another would decide and limit all her years to come. Upon the tiny "yes" or
  "no" between which she had to make her choice, her whole life was destined to
  pivot. Accordingly, she made up her mind to say neither, but to turn the
  matter into a jest. "Here's the proof," said she, as lightly as she could,
  and she flourished the glove.</p>

  <p>But the man steadily held her to his question, with his eyes, with his
  voice, with his very attitude. "Do you believe that?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I believe it," she murmured resentfully. "I don't
  see why I should be asked to mean what I say, or whether I mean what I
  say.... But it might be so, I think.... I don't know.... I don't know."</p>

  <p>To her relief Charnock moved. If he had stood like that, demanding an
  answer with every line of his body, for another instant, she knew she would
  have been compelled to answer one way or another; and she felt certain, too,
  that whatever answer she gave it would have been the one she would have
  wished afterwards to take back. "Now if you are satisfied," she added with a
  touch of petulance, "we will go in."</p>

  <p>He moved aside for her to pass, but before she had time to step forward,
  he moved back again and barred the way. "No, please," he said quickly, and
  his voice thrilled as though he had hit upon an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Lady Donnisthorpe told me you were rather unconventional," she remarked
  with a sigh, which was only half of it a jest; and she drew back as though
  she did not wish to hear what he had to say, as though she almost feared to
  hear it.</p>

  <p>But Charnock barely even remarked her reluctance. "That glove," he said,
  and pointed to it. Miranda imagined that he was reaching out a hand for
  it.</p>

  <p>"I have <i>heaps</i> of pairs," she exclaimed, whipping it behind her
  back; "there is no need to trouble about it at all."</p>

  <p>"I do not ask for it; I had no thought of that. On the contrary, I would
  ask you to keep it if you will. There is something else which I was trying to
  say, if you remember."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" said Miranda, ruefully, "I could wish after all that you had
  trodden on my toes."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Charnock, and instantly he drew aside. He left
  the way clear for her. She passed him, and went towards the window, from
  which the lights and the music streamed out into the night. Had he followed,
  she would have stepped into the room, amongst the dancers; she would have
  been claimed by a partner, and she would have seen no more of Charnock, and
  the only consequences of this interview upon the balcony would have been a
  memory in her thoughts, a curiosity in her speculations.</p>

  <p>But Charnock did not follow her. He remained where she left him, and her
  feet loitered more with every step she took. At the edge of the window she
  stopped. For the second time that evening she became aware that one way or
  other she must do the irrevocable thing. It was a mere step to make across
  the sill of the window, from the stone of the balcony to the parquet of the
  ball-room floor,&mdash;a thing insignificant in itself and in its
  consequences most momentous. She stood for a second undecided. The sight of
  her partner looking about the room decided her. She came back to where
  Charnock stood in a soldierly rigidity.</p>

  <p>"You might have come half-way to meet me," she said in a whimsical
  complaint, and then very gently: "I will hear what you wish to say, if you
  will still say it."</p>

  <p>"What I mean is this," he replied; "it is what I was trying to say. The
  hardest thing, if one ever wants help, is&mdash;don't you think?&mdash;the
  asking for it. I could not say that to you until I had hit upon a means by
  which the asking, should it ever be necessary, might be dispensed with. And
  it seemed to me that there was something providential in my tearing that
  glove; for that torn glove can be the means, if ever you see fit to use it.
  You live at Ronda; for the next year I am to be found at Algeciras; you will
  only have to send that torn glove to me in an envelope. I shall know without
  a word from you; and when I answer it by coming up to you at Ronda, it will
  be understood by both of us, again without a word, why I have come. I shall
  not need to speak at all; you will only need to say the precise particular
  thing which needs to be done."</p>

  <p>Miranda stood with her eyelids closed, and her ungloved hand pressed over
  her heart. The blood darkened her cheeks. Charnock saw her whole face soften
  and sweeten. "I understand," she said in a low voice. "I might appeal and be
  spared the humiliation of appealing, like the face in your mirror."</p>

  <p>"I believe," said he, "that my mirror sent me a message on that night. I
  have tried to deliver it."</p>

  <p>Miranda slowly raised her eyes and they glistened with something other
  than the starlight. "Thank you," she said; "for the delicacy of the thought I
  am most grateful. What woman would not be? But I do not think that I shall
  ever send you the glove: not because I would not be glad to owe gratitude to
  you, but just for the same reason which has kept me from telling you anything
  of my troubles. Such as they are I must fight them through by myself."</p>

  <p>This time she passed over the sill into the ballroom; but she was holding
  the glove tight against her breast, and she had a feeling that Charnock very
  surely knew that at some time she would send it to him.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <h3>WHILE CHARNOCK BUILDS CASTLES IN SPAIN, MIRANDA RETURNS THERE</h3><br>

  <p>THE anxious dowager, who was preparing to depart with her daughter, had
  just risen from her seat by the window as Miranda stepped over the sill into
  the ball-room. She sat down again, however, for she had a word or two to say
  concerning Miranda's appearance.</p>

  <p>"Muriel," she observed, "take a good look at that woman, and remember that
  if ever you sit out with one man for half-an-hour on a cool balcony you can
  make no greater mistake than to return with a flushed face."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, mother," said Muriel, who was growing restive under this
  instructional use of an evening party. "I will take the first opportunity of
  practising your advice."</p>

  <p>At this moment Charnock stepped over the sill. He stepped up to Mrs.
  Warriner's side and spoke to her. Mrs. Warriner stopped within a couple of
  yards of the dowager and gave her hand, and with her hand her eyes, to her
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Muriel, look!" said the censorious one. "How vulgar!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I listen too?" asked Muriel, innocently.</p>

  <p>"Do, my child, do!" said the dowager, who was impervious to sarcasm.</p>

  <p>What was said, however, did not reach the dowager's ears. It was, indeed,
  no more than an interchange of "good-nights," but the dowager bridled,
  perhaps out of disappointment that she had not heard.</p>

  <p>"An intriguing woman I have no doubt," said she, as through her glasses
  she followed Miranda's retreat.</p>

  <p>"Surely she has too much dignity," objected the daughter.</p>

  <p>"Dignity, indeed! My child, when you know more of the world, you will
  understand that the one astonishing thing about such women is not their
  capacity for playing tricks but their incredible power of retaining their
  self-respect while they are playing them. Now we will go."</p>

  <p>The dowager's voice was a high one. It carried her words clearly to
  Charnock, who had not as yet moved. He laughed at them then with entire
  incredulity, but he retained them unwittingly in his memory. The next moment
  the dowager swept past him. The daughter Muriel followed, and as she passed
  Charnock she looked at him with an inquisitive friendliness. But her eyes
  happened to meet his, and with a spontaneous fellow-feeling the girl and the
  man smiled to each other and at the dowager, before they realised that they
  were totally unacquainted.</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe was lying in wait for Charnock. She asked him to take
  her to the buffet. Charnock secured for her a chair and an ice, and stood by
  her side, conversational but incommunicative. She was consequently compelled
  herself to broach the subject which was at that moment nearest to her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"How did you get on with my cousin?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Charnock smiled foolishly at nothing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, say something!" cried Lady Donnisthorpe, and tapped with her spoon
  upon the glass plate.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about her," said Charnock, drawing up another chair.</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe lowered her voice and said with great pathos: "She is
  most unhappy."</p>

  <p>Charnock gravely nodded his head. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe settled herself comfortably with the full intention of
  wringing Charnock's heart if by any means she could.</p>

  <p>"Miranda comes of an old Catholic Suffolk family. She was eighteen when
  she married, and that's six years ago. No, six years and a half. Ralph
  Warriner was a Lieutenant in the Artillery, and made her acquaintance when he
  was staying in the neighbourhood of the Pollards, that's Miranda's house in
  Suffolk. Ralph listened to Allan Bedlow's antediluvian stories. Allan was
  Miranda's father, her mother died long ago. Ralph captured the father;
  finally he captured the daughter. Ralph, you see, had many graces but no
  qualities; he was a bad stone in a handsome setting and Miranda was no
  expert. How could she be? She lived at Glenham with only her father and a
  discontented relation, called Jane Holt, for her companions. Consequently she
  married Ralph Warriner, who got his step the day after the marriage, and the
  pair went immediately to Gibraltar. Ralph had overestimated Miranda's
  fortune, and it came out that he was already handsomely dipped; so that their
  married life began with more than the usual disadvantages. It lasted for
  three years, and for that time only because of Miranda's patience and
  endurance. She is very silent about those three years, but we know enough,"
  and Lady Donnisthorpe was for a moment carried away. "It must have been
  intolerable," she exclaimed. "Ralph Warriner never had cared a snap of his
  fingers for her. His tastes were despicable, his disposition utterly mean.
  Cards were in his blood; I verily believe that his heart was an ace of
  spades. Add to that that he was naturally cantankerous and jealous. To his
  brother officers he was civil for he owed them money, but he made up for his
  civility by becoming a bully once he had closed his own front door."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Charnock, hurriedly, as though he had no heart to
  hear more; "I understand."</p>

  <p>"You can understand then that when the crash came we were glad. Two years
  after the marriage old Allan Bedlow sickened. Miranda came home to nurse him
  and Ralph&mdash;he bought a schooner-yacht. Allan Bedlow died; Miranda
  inherited, and the estate was settled upon her. Ralph could not touch a
  farthing of the capital, and he was aggrieved. Miranda returned to Gibraltar,
  and matters went from worse to worse. The crash came a year later. The nature
  of it is neither here nor there, but Ralph had to go, and had to go pretty
  sharp. His schooner-yacht was luckily lying in Gibraltar Bay; he slipped on
  board before gunfire, and put to sea as soon as it was dark; and he was not
  an instant too soon. From that moment he disappeared, and the next news we
  had of him was the discovery of his body upon Rosevear two years
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>Charnock hunted through the jungle of Lady Donnisthorpe's words for a clue
  to the distress which Miranda had betrayed that evening, but he did not
  discover one. Another question forced itself into his mind. "Why does Mrs.
  Warriner live at Ronda?" he asked. "I have never been there, but there are no
  English residents, I should think."</p>

  <p>"That was one of her reasons," replied Lady Donnisthorpe. "At least I
  think so, but upon that too she is silent, and when she will not speak no one
  can make her. You see what Ralph did was hushed up,&mdash;it was one of those
  cases which are hushed up,&mdash;particularly since he had disappeared and
  was out of reach. But everyone knew that disgrace attached to it. His name
  was removed from the Army List. Miranda perhaps shrank from the disgrace. She
  shrank too, I think, from the cheap pity of which she would have had so much.
  At all events she did not return home, she sent for Jane Holt, her former
  companion, and settled at Ronda." Lady Donnisthorpe looked doubtfully at
  Charnock. "Perhaps there were other reasons too, sacred reasons." But she had
  not made up her mind whether it would be wise to explain those other reasons
  before her guests began to take their leave of her; and so the opportunity
  was lost.</p>

  <p>Charnock walked back to his hotel that night in a frame of mind entirely
  strange to him. He was inclined to rhapsodise; he invented and rejected
  various definitions of woman; he laughed at the worldly ignorance of the
  dowager. "A woman, madam "&mdash;he imagined himself to be lecturing
  her&mdash;"is the great gift to man to keep him clean and bright like a
  favourite sword." He composed other and no less irreproachable phrases, and
  in the midst of this exhilarating exercise was struck suddenly aghast at the
  temerity of his own conduct that night, at the remembrance of his
  persistency. However, he was not in a mood to be disheartened. The dawn took
  the sky by surprise while he was still upon his way. The birds bustled among
  the leaves in the gardens, and a thrush tried his throat, and finding it
  clear gave full voice to his song. The blackbirds called one to the other,
  and a rosy light struck down the streets. It was morning, and he stopped to
  wonder whether Miranda was yet asleep. He hoped so, intensely, for the sake
  of her invaluable health.</p>

  <p>But Miranda was seated by her open window, listening to the birds calling
  in the Park, and drawing some quiet from the quiet of the lawns and trees;
  and every now and then she glanced across her shoulder to where a torn white
  glove lay upon the table, as though she was afraid it would vanish by some
  enchantment.</p>

  <p>But the next day Miranda packed her boxes, and when Charnock called upon
  Lady Donnisthorpe, he was informed that she had returned in haste to Ronda.
  Charnock was surprised, for he remembered that Mrs. Warriner had expressed a
  doubt whether she would ever return to Ronda, and wondered what had occurred
  to change her mind. But the surprise and bewilderment were soon swallowed up
  in a satisfaction which sprang from the assurance that Miranda and he were
  after all to be neighbours.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <h3>IN WHICH MAJOR WILBRAHAM DESCRIBES THE STEPS BY WHICH HE ATTAINED<br>
  HIS MAJORITY, AND GIVES MIRANDA SOME PARTICULAR INFORMATION</h3><br>

  <p class="first">A MONTH later at Ronda, and a little after midday. In the
  cool darkness of the Cathedral, under the great stone dome behind the choir,
  Miranda was kneeling before a lighted altar. That altar she had erected, as
  an inscription showed, to the memory of Ralph Warriner, and since her return
  from England she had passed more than an ordinary proportion of her time in
  front of it.</p>

  <p>This morning, however, an unaccountable uneasiness crept over her. She
  tried to shake the sensation off by an increased devoutness, but though her
  knees were bent, there was no prayer in her mind or upon her lips. Her
  uneasiness increased, and after a while it defined itself. Someone was
  watching her from behind.</p>

  <p>She ceased even from the pretence of prayer. Her heart fluttered up into
  her throat. She did not look round, she did not move, but she knelt there
  with a sinking expectation, in the light of the altar candles, and felt
  intensely helpless because their yellow warmth streamed full upon her face
  and person, and must disclose her to the watching eyes behind.</p>

  <p>She knelt waiting for a familiar voice and a familiar step. She heard only
  the grating of a chair upon the stone flags beyond the choir, and a priest
  droning a litany very far away. Here all was quiet&mdash;quiet as the eyes
  watching her out of the gloom.</p>

  <p>At last, resenting her cowardice, she rose to her feet and turned. At once
  a man stepped forward, and her heart gave a great throb of relief, as she saw
  the man was a stranger.</p>

  <p>He bowed, and with an excuse for his intrusion, he handed her a card. She
  did not look at it, for immediately the stranger continued to speak, in a
  cool, polite voice, and it seemed to her that all her blood stood still.</p>

  <p>"I knew Captain Warriner at Gibraltar," he said. "In fact I may say that I
  know him, for he is alive."</p>

  <p>Miranda was dimly aware that he waited for an answer, and then excused her
  silence with an accent of sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Such good news must overwhelm you, no doubt. I have used all despatch to
  inform you of it, for I was only certain of the truth yesterday."</p>

  <p>And to her amazement Miranda heard herself reply:</p>

  <p>"Then I discovered it a month before you did."</p>

  <p>The next thing of which she was conscious was a thick golden mist before
  her eyes. The golden mist was the clear sunlight in the square before the
  Cathedral. Miranda was leaning against the stone parapet, though how she was
  there she could not have told. She had expected the news. She had even
  thought that the man standing behind her was her husband, come to tell her it
  in person; but nevertheless the mere telling of it, the putting of it in
  words, to quote the stranger's phrase, had overwhelmed her. Memories of
  afternoons during which she had walked out with her misery to Europa Point,
  of evenings when she had sat with her misery upon the flat house-top watching
  the riding lights in Algeciras Bay, and listening to the jingle of
  tambourines from the houses on the hillside below&mdash;all the sordid
  unnecessary wretchedness of those three years spent at Gibraltar came
  crushing her. She savoured again the disgrace which attended upon Ralph's
  flight. Her first instinct, when she learned Ralph was alive, had urged her
  to hide, and at this moment she regretted that she had not obeyed it. She
  regretted that she had returned to Ronda, where Ralph or any emissary of his
  at once could find her.</p>

  <p>But that was only for a moment. She had returned to Ronda with a full
  appreciation of the consequences of her return, and for reasons which she was
  afterwards to explain, and of which, even while she stood in that square, she
  resumed courage to approve.</p>

  <p>The stranger came from the door of the Cathedral and crossed to her.</p>

  <p>"Your matter-of-fact acceptance of my news was clever, Mrs. Warriner," he
  said with a noticeable sharpness. "Believe me, I do homage to cleverness. I
  frankly own that I expected a scene of sorts. I was quite taken aback&mdash;a
  compliment, I assure you, upon my puff," and he bowed with his hand on his
  breast. "You were out of the Cathedral door before I realised that all this
  time you had been the Captain's&mdash;would you mind if I said
  accomplice?"</p>

  <p>That her matter-of-fact acceptance of the news was entirely due to the
  fact that the news dazed her, Miranda did not trouble to explain.</p>

  <p>"The altar," continued the stranger, in a voice of genuine admiration,
  "was a master-stroke. To erect an altar to the memory of a husband who is
  still alive, to pray devoutly before it, is highly ingenious and&mdash;may I
  say?&mdash;brave. Religion is a trump-card, Mrs. Warriner, in most of the
  games where you sit with law and order for your opponents; but not many women
  have the bravery to play it for its value."</p>

  <p>Miranda coloured at his words. There had been some insincerity in her
  daily prayers before the altar, though the self-satisfied man who spoke to
  her had not his finger upon the particular flaw,&mdash;enough insincerity to
  cause Miranda some shame, now that she probed it, and yet in the insincerity
  there had been also something sincere. The truth is, Miranda could bring
  herself to wish neither that her husband was dead if he was alive, nor that
  he should come to life again if he was dead; she made a compromise&mdash;she
  daily prayed with great fervour for his soul's salvation before the altar she
  had erected to his memory. But this again was not a point upon which she
  troubled to enlighten her companion. She was more concerned to discover who
  the man was, and on what business he had come.</p>

  <p>"You knew my husband at Gibraltar," she said, "and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true," replied the man, in answer to her suspicion. "You need not
  be afraid, Mrs. Warriner. I have not come from Scotland Yard. I have had, I
  admit, relations with the police, but they have always been of an involuntary
  kind."</p>

  <p>"You assume," said she, with some pride, "that I have reason to fear
  Scotland Yard, whereas nothing was further from my thoughts. Only you say
  that you knew my husband at Gibraltar. You pretend to come from
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By no means. We are at cross-purposes, I fancy. I do not come from him,
  though most certainly I did know him at Gibraltar. But I admit that he never
  invited me to his house."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Miranda, with a cold bow, "I can do no more than
  thank you for the news you give me and wish you a good day."</p>

  <p>She walked by him. He turned and imperturbably fell into step by her side.
  "Clever," said he, "clever!" Miranda stopped. "Who are you? What is your
  business?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"As to who I am, you hold my card in your hand."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner had carried it from the Cathedral, unaware that she held it.
  She now raised it to her eyes and read, <i>Major Ambrose Wilbraham</i>.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham noted, though he did not understand, the rapid, perplexed glance
  which she shot at him. Charnock had spoken to her of a Major Wilbraham, had
  described him, and undoubtedly this was the man. "As to my business," he
  continued, "I give you the news that your husband is alive, but I have also
  something to sell."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Obviously my silence. It might be awkward if it was known in certain
  quarters that Captain Warriner, who sold the mechanism of the new Daventry
  quick-firing gun to a foreign power; who slipped out of Gibraltar just a
  night before his arrest was determined on, and who was wrecked a year ago in
  the Scillies, is not only alive, but in the habit of paying periodical visits
  to England."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner again read the name upon the card. "Major Ambrose
  Wilbraham," she said, with an incredulous emphasis on the <i>Major</i>.</p>

  <p>"Captains," he retorted airily, "have at times deviated from the narrow
  path, so that a Major may well be forgiven a peccadillo. But I will not
  deceive you, Mrs. Warriner. The rank was thrust upon me by a barman in
  Shaftesbury Avenue, and I suffered it, because the title after all gives me
  the entrance to the chambers of many young men who have, or most often have
  not, just taken their degrees. So Major I am, but my mess is any bar within a
  mile of Piccadilly Circus. Shall we say that I hold brevet rank, and am
  seconded for service in the noble regiment of the soldiers of fortune?"</p>

  <p>"And the enemies you fight with," said Miranda, with a contemptuous droop
  of the lips, "are women like myself."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," retorted Wilbraham, with unabashed good humour. "Women like
  yourself, Mrs. Warriner, are the <i>vivandières</i> whom we regretfully
  impress to supply our needs upon the march. Our enemies are the
  rozzers&mdash;again I beg your pardon&mdash;the gentlemen in blue who lurk at
  the street corners, by whom from time to time we are worsted and
  interned."</p>

  <p>They walked across the square along a narrow street down towards the Tajo,
  that deep chasm which bisects the town. The heat was intense, the road
  scorched under foot, and they walked slowly. They made a strange pair in the
  old, quaint streets, the woman walking with a royal carriage, delicate in her
  beauty and her dress; the man defiant, battered and worn, with an eye which
  from sheer habit scouted in front and aside for the chance which might toss
  his day's rations in his way.</p>

  <p>Their talk was stranger still, for by an unexpressed consent, the subject
  of the bargain to be struck was deferred, and as they walked Wilbraham
  illustrated to Miranda the career of a man who lives by his wits, and dwelt
  even with humour upon its alternations of prosperity and starvation. "I have
  been a manager of theatrical companies in 'the smalls,'" he said, "a
  billiard-marker at Trieste, a racing tipster, a vender of&mdash;photographs,
  and I once carried a sandwich-board down Bond Street, and saw the women I had
  danced with not so long before draw their delicate skirts from the defilement
  of my rags. However, I rose to a better position. It is funny, you know, to
  go right under, and then find there are social degrees in the depths. I have
  had good times too, mind you. Every now and then I have struck an A1
  copper-bottomed gold mine, and then there were dress suits and meals running
  into one another, and ormolu rooms on the first floor."</p>

  <p>Dark sayings, unintelligible shibboleths, came and went among his words
  and obscured their meaning; accents and phrases from many countries betrayed
  the vicissitudes of his life; but he spoke with the accent of a gentleman,
  and with something of a gentleman's good humour; so that Miranda, moved
  partly by his recital and perhaps partly because her own misfortunes had
  touched her to an universal sympathy, began to be interested in the man who
  had experienced so much that was strange to her, and they both slipped into a
  tolerance of each other and a momentary forgetfulness of their relationship
  as blackmailer and blackmailed.</p>

  <p>"I could give you a modern edition of Don Guzman," he said. "I was a
  money-lender's tout at Gibraltar at one time. It's to that I owed my
  acquaintance with Warriner. It's to that I owe my present acquaintance with
  you." He came to a dead stop in the full swing of narration. He halted in his
  steps and banged the point of his stick down into the road. "But I have done
  with it," he cried, and drawing a great breath, he showed to Miranda a face
  suddenly illuminated. "The garrets and the first floors, the stale billiard
  rooms, the desperate scouting for food like a damned sea-gull&mdash;I beg
  your pardon, Mrs. Warriner. Upon my word, I do! But imagine a poor beggar of
  a bankrupt painter who, after fifteen years, suddenly finds himself with a
  meal upon the table and his bills paid! I am that man. Fifteen years of what
  I have described to you! It might have been less, no doubt, but I hadn't
  learnt my lesson. Fifteen years, and from first to last not one thing done of
  the few things worth doing; fifteen years of a murderous hunt for breakfast
  and dinner! And I've done with it, thanks to you, Mrs. Warriner." And his
  face hardened at once and gleamed at her, very cruel and menacing. "Yes,
  thanks to you! We'll not forget that." And as he resumed his walk the
  astounding creature began gaily to quote poetry:</p>

  <p>"I resume Life after death; for 'tis no less than life After such long,
  unlovely labouring days.</p>

  <p>A great poet, Mrs. Warriner. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Miranda, absently. That one cruel glance had chilled the
  sympathy in her; Major Wilbraham would not spare either Ralph or herself with
  the memory of those fifteen years to harden him.</p>

  <p>They came to the Ciudad, the old intricate Moorish town of tortuous lanes
  in the centre of Ronda. Before a pair of heavy walnut doors curiously
  encrusted with bright copper nails Wilbraham came to a stop. "Your house, I
  think, Mrs. Warriner," and he took off his hat and wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer," said she, "to hear what you have to say in the
  Alameda."</p>

  <p>"As you will. I am bound to say that I could have done with a soda and I'm
  so frisky, but I recognise that I have no right to trespass upon your
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>They went on, crossed a small plaza, and so came down to the Tajo. A
  bridge spans the ravine in a single arch; in the centre of the bridge Miranda
  stopped, leaned over the parapet and looked downwards. Wilbraham followed her
  example. For three hundred feet the walls of the gorge fell sheer, at the
  bottom the turbulence of a torrent foamed and roared, at the top was the span
  of the bridge. In the brickwork of the arch a tiny window looked out on
  air.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that window?" said Miranda, drily. "The prison is underfoot in
  the arch of the bridge."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, how picturesque," returned Wilbraham, easily, who was quite
  untouched by any menace which Miranda's words might suggest. Miranda looked
  across the road towards a guardia. Wilbraham lazily followed the direction of
  her glance; for all the emotion which he showed blackmail might have been
  held in Spain an honourable means of livelihood. Miranda turned back. "That
  window," she said, "is the window of the prison."</p>

  <p>"The view," remarked Wilbraham, "would compensate in some measure for the
  restriction."</p>

  <p>"Chains might add to the restriction."</p>

  <p>"Chains <i>are</i> unpleasant," Wilbraham heartily agreed.</p>

  <p>Miranda realised that she had tempted defeat in this little encounter. She
  accepted it and walked on.</p>

  <p>"You were wise to come off that barrow, Mrs. Warriner," Wilbraham remarked
  in approval.</p>

  <p>They crossed the bridge and entered the Mercadillo, the new Spanish
  quarter of the town, ascended the hill, and came to the bull ring. Before
  that Wilbraham stopped. "Why do we go to the Alameda?"</p>

  <p>"We can talk there on neutral ground."</p>

  <p>"It seems a long way."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," replied Miranda, "the Alameda is close to the railway
  station. By the bye, how did you know where I lived?"</p>

  <p>"There was no difficulty in discovering that. I learnt at Gibraltar that
  you lived at Ronda, and the station-master here told me where. When I saw
  your house I did not wonder at your choice. You were wise to take a Moorish
  house, I fancy&mdash;the patio with the tamarisks in the middle and the
  fountain and the red and green tiles&mdash;very pleasant, I should think. A
  door or two stood open. The rooms seemed charming, low in roof, with dark
  panels, of a grateful coolness, and so far as I could judge, with fine
  views."</p>

  <p>"You went into the house, then?" exclaimed Miranda.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I asked for you, and was told that Miss Holt was at home. I thought
  it wise to go in&mdash;one never knows. So I introduced myself, but not my
  business, to Miss Holt&mdash;your cousin, is she not? A profound
  sentimentalist, I should fancy; I noticed she was reading <i>Henrietta
  Temple</i>. She complained of being much alone; she nurses grievances, no
  doubt. Sentimentalists have that habit&mdash;what do you say?" Miranda could
  have laughed at the shrewdness of the man's perceptions, had she not been
  aware that the shrewdness was a weapon directed against her own breast.</p>

  <p>They reached the Alameda. Miranda led the way to a bench which faced the
  railings. Wilbraham looked quickly and suspiciously at her, and then walked
  to the railings and looked over. The Alameda is laid out upon the very edge
  of the Ronda plateau, and Wilbraham looked straight down a sheer rock
  precipice of a thousand feet. He remained in that posture for some seconds.
  From the foot of that precipice the plain of the Vega stretched out level as
  a South-sea lagoon. The gardens of a few cottages were marked out upon the
  green like the squares of a chess-board; upon the hedges there was here and
  there the flutter of white linen. Orchards of apples, cherries, peaches, and
  pears, enriched the plain with their subdued colours, and the Guadiaro, freed
  from the confinement of its chasm, wound through it with the glitter and the
  curve of a steel spring. A few white Moorish mills upon the banks of the
  stream were at work, and the sound of them came droning through the still
  heat up to Wilbraham's ears.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham, however, was not occupied with the scenery, for when he turned
  back to Miranda his face was dark and angry.</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring me to the Alameda?" he asked sternly.</p>

  <p>"Because I will not listen to you in my own, house," she answered with
  spirit.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham did not resent the reason, but he watched her warily, as though
  he doubted it.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Miranda, as she stood before him. "You tell me that my husband
  is living. I have your bare word for it, and out of your lips you have proved
  to me that your bare word has very little worth."</p>

  <p>"The buttons are off the foils," said he; "very well. In the Cathedral you
  corroborated my word. You know that he lives; I know it."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it?"</p>

  <p>"By adding two and two and making five, as any man with any savvy always
  can," replied Wilbraham. "Indeed, by adding two and two, one can even at
  times make a decent per annum."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner sat down upon the bench, and Wilbraham, standing at her
  side, presented the following testimonial to his "savvy." First of all, he
  drew from one pocket four pounds of English gold, and from the other a
  handful of dollars and pesetas. "This is what is left of two hundred and
  thirty pounds, which I won at Monte Carlo in the beginning of May. There's a
  chance for philosophy, Mrs. Warriner. If I hadn't won that money I shouldn't
  be standing here now with my livelihood assured. For I shouldn't have been
  able to embark on the P. and O. mail steamer <i>India</i> at Marseilles, and
  so I shouldn't have fallen in with my dear young friend Charnock."</p>

  <p>Miranda fairly started at the mention of Charnock's name in connection
  with Wilbraham's discovery. Instantly Wilbraham paused. Miranda made an
  effort to look entirely unconcerned, but Wilbraham's eye was upon her, and
  she felt the blood colouring her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Oho!" said Wilbraham, cocking his head. Then he whistled softly to
  himself while he looked her over from head to foot. Miranda kept silence, and
  he resumed his story, though every time he mentioned Charnock's name he
  looked to surprise her in some movement.</p>

  <p>"Off Ushant we came up with a brigantine, and I couldn't help fancying
  that her lines were familiar to me. Charnock lent me his binoculars&mdash;a
  dear good fellow, Charnock!&mdash;and I made out her name, the <i>Tarifa</i>.
  I should not have given the boat another thought but for Charnock. Charnock
  said she had the lines of a Salcombe clipper. Did you happen to know that the
  <i>Ten Brothers</i> was a Salcombe clipper? I did, and the moment Charnock
  had spoken I understood why the look of her hull was familiar; I had seen her
  or her own legitimate sister swinging at Warriner's moorings in Algeciras
  Bay. I did not set any great store upon that small point, however, until
  Charnock kindly informed me that her owner could have gained no possible
  advantage by altering her rig from a schooner's into a brigantine's. Then my
  interest began to rise, for he had altered the rig. Why, if the change was to
  his disadvantage? I can't say that I had any answer ready; I can't say that I
  expected to find an answer. But since I landed at Plymouth, from which
  Salcombe is a bare twenty miles, I thought that I might as well run over. One
  never knows&mdash;such small accidents mean everything for us&mdash;and, as a
  matter of fact, I spent a very pleasant half-hour in the back parlour of the
  Commercial Inn, watching the yachts at anchor and the little sailing boats
  spinning about the river, and listening to an old skipper, who deplored the
  times when the town rang with the din of hammers in shipbuilding yards, and
  twelve&mdash;observe, Mrs. Warriner, twelve&mdash;schooners brought to it the
  prosperity of their trade. The schooners had been sold off, but the skipper
  had their destinies at his fingers' ends as a man follows the fortunes of his
  children. Two had been cast away, three were in the Newfoundland trade, one
  was now a steam-yacht, and the others still carried fruit from the West
  Indies. He accounted for eleven of them, and the twelfth, of course, was the
  <i>Ten Brothers</i> wrecked upon Rosevear. I eliminated the <i>Ten
  Brothers</i>, the two which had been cast away, and the steam-yacht. Eight
  were left."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Mrs. Warriner.</p>

  <p>"I went back to Plymouth and verified the skipper's information. He had
  given me the owners' names and the names of the vessels. I looked them up in
  the sailing-lists and I proved beyond a shadow of doubt, from their dates of
  sailing and arrival at various ports, that not one of those eight schooners
  could have been the brigantine we passed off Ushant. There remained, then,
  the four which I had eliminated, or rather the three, for the steam-yacht was
  out of the question. Do you follow?"</p>

  <p>Miranda made a sign of assent.</p>

  <p>"Those three boats had been cast away. Two of them belonged to respectable
  firms, the third to Ralph Warriner. It would of course be very convenient for
  Ralph Warriner, under the circumstances, to be reputed dead and yet to be
  alive with a boat in hand, so to speak. On the other side, would it profit
  either of the two respectable firms to spread a false report that one of
  their boats had been cast away? Hardly; besides, it would of course be to
  Warriner's advantage, from the point of view of concealment, to change the
  rig and the name of his boat. It was all inference and guess-work, no doubt.
  Charnock, for instance, might have been entirely wrong; the <i>Tarifa</i>
  might never have been anything but the <i>Tarifa</i> and a brigantine; but
  the inference and the guess-work all pointed the one way, and I own that my
  interest was rapidly changing to excitement. My suspicions were strengthened
  by the behaviour of the <i>Tarifa</i> herself. No news of her approach was
  recorded in the papers. She didn't make any unnecessary noise about the port
  she was bound for, nor had she the manners to pass the time of day with any
  of Lloyd's signal-stations. The <i>Tarifa's</i> business began to provoke my
  curiosity. Here was (shall we say?) a needless lack of ceremony to begin
  with. It didn't seem as if the <i>Tarifa</i> had many anxious friends
  awaiting her arrival. Besides that, supposing that my suspicions were right,
  that the <i>Tarifa</i> was the <i>Ten Brothers</i> masquerading under another
  name, and that perhaps Ralph Warriner was on board, it stood to reason Ralph
  Warriner would not risk his skin in an English port, without a better reason
  than a cargo of trade. Comprenny, Mrs. Warriner? I was guessing,
  conjecturing, inferring; I had no knowledge. So I thought the cargo of the
  <i>Tarifa</i> was the right end of the stick to hang on to. If I could know
  the truth about that, I should be in a better position to guess whether it
  had anything to do with Ralph Warriner. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>It was clear enough to Miranda, who already felt herself enmeshed in the
  net of this man's ingenious deductions. "Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Very well. From the brigantine's course, she was evidently making for one
  of the western harbours. I lay low in Plymouth for a couple of days, and read
  the shipping news. That wasn't all I did during those two days, though. I
  went to the Free Library besides, overhauled the file of the <i>Western
  Morning News</i> and assimilated information about the inquest at St. Mary's.
  The faceless mariner chucked up on Rosevear struck one as interesting. I
  noticed too that there had been a good many wrecks in the Channel during the
  heavy weather and the fog just about that time. But before I had come to any
  conclusion, I opened my newspaper on the third morning and read that the
  <i>Tarifa</i> had dropped her anchor at Falmouth. I took the first train out
  of Plymouth, and sure enough I picked the <i>Tarifa</i> up in Falmouth docks.
  Then I made friends with the port-officers, but I got never a glimpse of
  Ralph Warriner."</p>

  <p>Miranda's hopes revived. She knew very well that Ralph Warriner was not at
  that time in Falmouth. For the moment, however, she let Wilbraham run on.</p>

  <p>"I frankly admit that my hopes sank a little," he continued. "Of course
  Warriner might have been put ashore; but it seemed to me impossible to obtain
  sufficient certainty of my suspicions unless I actually clapped eyes on
  him."</p>

  <p>Miranda agreed, and her prospects of escaping from this man's clutches
  showed brighter; for she was not in a mood of sufficient calmness to enable
  her to realise that Wilbraham would hardly have been so frank, if he had not
  by now at all events acquired absolute certainty.</p>

  <p>"My hopes were to sink yet more," Wilbraham continued. "The brigantine
  passed for a tramp out from Tarifa with a cargo of fruit. I saw that cargo
  unloaded. There was no pretence about it; it was a full cargo of fruit. The
  boat was sailing back to Tarifa with a cargo of alkali, and I saw that cargo
  stowed away in her hold. Mrs. Warriner, my spirits began to revive. That
  cargo of alkali was most uncommon small; the profit on it wouldn't have paid
  the decky's wages. Again I inferred. I inferred that the alkali was a blind,
  and that the <i>Tarifa</i> meant to pick up a cargo of another sort somewhere
  along the coast, though what the cargo would be I could not for the life of
  me imagine."</p>

  <p>"But it is all guess-work," said Miranda, with an indifference which she
  was far from feeling.</p>

  <p>"I learned one piece of solid cheering information from my friends the
  port-officers," retorted Wilbraham. "The <i>Tarifa's</i> papers were all
  quite recent, and yet she was an old boat. She was supposed to be owned by
  her master."</p>

  <p>"And no doubt was," added Miranda, with an assumption of weariness.</p>

  <p>"It appeared that her saloon had caught fire; the saloon had been gutted
  and the <i>Tarifa's</i> papers destroyed a year before," Wilbraham resumed,
  untroubled by Mrs. Warriner's objections. "A pretty careless captain that,
  eh? A most uncommon careless captain, Mrs. Warriner? For a boat to lose her
  papers&mdash;well, its pretty much the same as when a girl loses her marriage
  lines in the melodramas. A most uncommon careless captain! Or a most astute
  one, you say. What? Well, I'll not deny but what you may be right. For that
  brigantine caught fire and burned her papers just about the date when the
  <i>Ten Brothers</i> went ashore on Rosevear. How's that for the long
  arm?"</p>

  <p>"But you did not see my husband," said Miranda, stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"And why?" asked Wilbraham, and answered his question. "Because your
  husband wasn't onboard."</p>

  <p>"Then the whole story falls to the ground," exclaimed Miranda, as she rose
  from her seat.</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit, Mrs. Warriner," said Wilbraham, and he sat down on the seat
  and nursed his leg. "The <i>Tarifa</i> was supposed to belong to her master,
  who went by the name of John Wilson. Now here's a funny thing. I never saw
  John Wilson, though I prowled about the docks enough. The port-officers
  described him to me, a grizzled seafaring man of fifty; but he was always
  snug in his cabin, and a mate did the show business with the cargo. I grew
  curious about John Wilson; I wanted to see John Wilson. Accordingly I located
  the chart-room from the wharf, then I put on a black thumb tie and a dirty
  collar so as to look like a clerk, and I walked boldly down the gangway and
  stepped across the deck. I chose my time, you understand. I knocked at the
  chart-room door. 'Come in,' said a voice, and in I walked. Mrs. Warriner, you
  could have knocked me down with that dainty parasol of yours if you had been
  present when I first saw John Wilson.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want?' says he, short and sharp.</p>

  <p>"'Will you take a load of cotton to Valencia?' says I, and I quoted an
  insignificant price.</p>

  <p>"'I am not such a fool as you look,' said he, and out I went and shook
  hands with myself on the quay. For John Wilson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was not my husband," exclaimed Miranda, with almost a despairing
  violence. "He was not! He was not!"</p>

  <p>"You are right, Mrs. Warriner, he was not. But he was a man whom you and I
  knew as Thomas Discipline, first mate of the schooner-yacht the <i>Ten
  Brothers</i>, of which Captain Ralph Warriner was the certificated master.
  And observe, please, the whole crew of the <i>Ten Brothers</i> was reported
  lost upon Rosevear."</p>

  <p>"Thomas Discipline might have left the <i>Ten Brothers</i> before," argued
  Miranda. "His presence on the <i>Tarifa</i> does not connect my husband with
  that boat."</p>

  <p>"That's precisely the objection which occurred to me," said Wilbraham,
  coolly. "But here was at last a fact which fitted in with my guess-work, and
  I own to being uplifted. That evening I got the ticket that the
  <i>Tarifa</i>was to put to sea the next day, and sure enough in the morning
  she swung out into the fairway and waited for the evening ebb. I passed that
  day in an altogether unenviable state of anxiety, Mrs. Warriner; for if by
  any chance I was wrong, if she did not mean to take up another cargo of a
  more profitable kind by dark, if she were to sail clean away for Ushant on
  the evening ebb, why, the boat might be the <i>Ten Brothers</i> or it might
  not, and the master might be the late Captain Warriner or he might not. Any
  way the bottom fell clean out of my little business. But she did not; she got
  her anchors in about eight o'clock and reached out towards the Lizard in the
  dusk with a light wind from the land on her beam."</p>

  <p>"The story so far," Miranda interrupted, "seems nautical, but hardly to
  the point."</p>

  <p>"Think so?" said Wilbraham, indifferently. "Did I mention that at the
  mouth of the harbour the <i>Tarifa</i> passed a steam launch pottering around
  the St. Anthony Light? Between you and me, Mrs. Warriner, I was holding the
  tiller of that steam launch."</p>

  <p>"You!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Just poor little me," said he, smiling politely, "with a few paltry
  thick-uns in my pocket to speculate in the hire of a steam launch. I gave the
  <i>Tarifa</i> a start and followed, keeping well away on her lee with her red
  light just in view. That first half-hour or so was a wearing time for me,
  Mrs. Warriner, I assure you," and he took off his hat and wiped his forehead,
  as though the anxiety came back upon him now. He laboured his breath and
  broke up his sentences with short nervous laughter. He seemed entirely to
  forget his companion, and the sun, and the Andalusian sierras across the
  plain; he was desperately hunting the <i>Tarifa</i> along the Spit to the
  Lizard point.</p>

  <p>"I was certain of one thing: that no Captain Warriner had come aboard at
  Falmouth. So if the <i>Tarifa</i> kept out to sea, why, there was no Captain
  Warriner to come aboard, and here was I spending my last pounds in running
  down a will-o'-the-wisp, and the world to face again to-morrow in the grim
  old way, without a penny to my purse. On the other hand, if there was a
  Captain Warriner, he would come aboard with the cargo somewhere that night,
  and I fancied I could lay my finger on that somewhere. I had another cause
  for anxiety. Grant my guess-work correct, and the last thing the
  <i>Tarifa</i> was likely to hanker after would be a wasp of a steam launch
  buzzing in her wake. The evening was hazy, by a stroke of luck, but the wind
  was light and the sea smooth, and my propeller throbbed out over the water
  until I thought it must reverberate across the world, and the Esquimaux on
  Franz Josef Land and the Kanaka in the Pacific would hear it plain as the
  pulsing of a battleship. However, I slowed the launch down to less than
  half-speed, and the crew of the <i>Tarifa</i> made no account of me. The
  brigantine was doing only a leisurely five knots&mdash;she was waiting for
  the dark, I conjectured. Conjectured? I came near to praying it. And as if in
  answer to my prayer&mdash;it sounds pretty much like blasphemy now, doesn't
  it?&mdash;but at that moment I believed it&mdash;all at once her red light
  vanished and my heart went jumping in the inside of me as though it had
  slipped its moorings. For the <i>Tarifa</i> had changed her course; she was
  pointing closer to the wind and the wind came offshore; she was showing me
  her stern instead of her port beam; on the course she was lying now she
  couldn't clear the Manacles&mdash;not by any manner of means. She was heading
  for the anchorage I hoped she would; she was standing in towards Helford
  river. In a little she went about, and seeing her green light, I slowed down
  again. I could afford to take it easy."</p>

  <p>He drew a breath of relief and lolled back upon his seat. Miranda no
  longer put questions; there was a look of discouragement upon her face; she
  began bitterly to feel herself helpless in this man's hands, as clay under
  the potter's thumb.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the creek?" he asked, and did not wait for an answer. "I
  hadn't anchored there for twenty years, but I had a chart of it in my
  memories." His voice softened, with perhaps some recollection of a yachting
  trip in the days before his life had grown sour. "Steep hills on each side,
  and on each side woods. The trees run down and thrust their knees into the
  water like animals at their watering places of an evening. A mile or so up, a
  little rose and honeysuckle village nestles as pretty as a poem. There's a
  noise of birds all day, and all night and day the trees talk. Given a
  westerly wind, and the summer, I don't know many places which come up to
  Helford river," and his voice ceased, and he sat in a muse. A movement at his
  side recalled him. "But that's not business, you say," he resumed briskly. "I
  left the <i>Tarifa</i> at the mouth of the creek. The little village a mile
  or more up is on the southward side; opposite to it, on the Falmouth side, is
  the coast-guard station; nearer to the mouth, and still on the Falmouth side,
  a tiny dingle shelters a school-house and half-a-dozen cottages, and still
  nearer, the road from Falmouth comes over the brow of the hill and dips down
  along the hill-side. At one point the steep hill-side is broken, there's an
  easy incline of sand and bushes and soil between the water and the road. The
  incline is out of sight of the coast-guard. Besides, it is only just round
  the point and close to the sea. And for that reason I was in no particular
  hurry to follow the <i>Tarifa</i>. I edged the launch close in under the
  point, waded ashore, and scrambled along in the dark until I reached the
  break in the hill-side. Then I lay down among the bushes and waited. All
  lights were out on the <i>Tarifa</i>, but I could see her hull dimly, a blot
  of solid black against the night's unsubstantial blackness. I waited for
  centuries and aeons. There was neither moon nor any star. At last I heard a
  creaking sound that came from the other end of the world. It was repeated, it
  grew louder, it became many sounds, the sounds or cart wheels on the dry
  road. I looked at my watch; the glimmer of its white face made it possible
  for me to tell the hour. It was five minutes to eleven. For five minutes the
  sounds drew infinitesimally nearer. Higher up the creek six bells were struck
  upon a yacht, and then over the waters from the direction of the
  <i>Tarifa</i> came cautiously the wooden rattle of oars in the rowlocks of a
  boat. A boat, I say, but it was followed by another and another. The three
  boats grounded on the sand as the carts reached the break in the hill-side.
  There were few words spoken, and no light shown. I lay in the bushes
  straining my ears to catch a familiar voice, my eyes on the chance that a
  match might be struck and light up a familiar face."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Miranda, breaking in upon his speech. She was strung to a
  high pitch or excitement, and her face and voice betrayed it.</p>

  <p>"I was disappointed," replied Wilbraham, "but I saw something of the cargo
  which the waggons brought over the hill and the boats carried on board.
  Backwards and forwards between the <i>Tarifa</i> and the shore they were
  rowed with unremitting diligence and caution, carrying first longish
  packing-cases of some weight, as I could gather from the conduct of the men
  who stumbled with them down the incline. And after the packing-cases, square
  boxes, yet more unwieldy than the long cases, if one takes the proportion of
  size. The morning was breaking before the last boat was hoisted on board, and
  the last waggon had creaked out of hearing over the hill."</p>

  <p>"And what was the cargo?" asked Miranda.</p>

  <p>"That was the question which troubled me," replied Wilbraham. "I lay on
  the hill-side in the chill of the morning as disheartened a man as you can
  imagine. Through a break in the bushes I watched the <i>Tarifa</i> below me,
  her decks busy with the movement of her crew and from her galley the
  comfortable smoke coiling up into the air. Breakfast! A Gargantuan appetite
  suddenly pinched my stomach. Had Warriner gone on board with the cargo? And
  what was the cargo? And into what harbour would the <i>Tarifa</i> carry it? I
  had found out nothing. Then on board the brigantine men gathered at the
  windlass, a chain clinked musically as the anchor was hove short, the gaff of
  her mainsail creaked up the mast, and the festoons of her canvas were
  unfolded. The <i>Tarifa</i> was outward bound and I had discovered nothing. I
  was like a man tied hand and foot and a treasure within his reach. I had had
  my fingers on the treasure. Again the chain rattled on the windlass; she
  broke out her foresail and her jib; I saw the water sparkle under her foot
  and stream out a creaming pennant in her wake. I had lost. In the space of a
  second I lived through every minute of my last fifteen years and their dreary
  vicissitudes. I lived in anticipation through another fifteen similar in
  every detail, and fairly shuddered to think there might be another fifteen
  still to follow those. I stretched myself out and ground my face in the sand
  and cursed God with all my heart for the difference between man and man. And
  meanwhile the <i>Tarifa</i>, with a hint of the sun upon her topsails,
  slipped out over the tide to sea."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham's face was quite convulsed by the violence of his recollections;
  and with so vivid a sincerity, with a voice so mutable, had he described the
  growth and extinction of his hopes, that Miranda almost forgot their object,
  almost found herself sympathising with his endeavours, almost regretted their
  failure&mdash;until she remembered that after all he had not failed, or he
  would not have been sitting beside her in the Alameda.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said in a hard voice, "you failed. What then?"</p>

  <p>"I crawled down to my launch, the cheapest man in the United Kingdom. My
  engineer was muffled up in a pilot jacket and uncommon surly and cheap too. I
  hadn't the pluck left in me to resent his impudence, and we crept back to
  Falmouth. All the way I was pestered with that question, 'What was the cargo
  I had seen shipped that night in Helford river?' I couldn't get it out of my
  head. The propeller lashed it out with a sort of vindictiveness. The little
  waves breaking ashore whispered about it, as though they knew very well, but
  wouldn't peach. When I had landed in Falmouth, I found that I was walking
  towards the Free Library. The doors, however, were still closed. I
  breakfasted in a fever of impatience and was back again at the doors before
  they were opened. You may take it from me, Mrs. Warriner, I was the first
  student inside the building that morning. I read over again every scrap of
  news and comment about the inquest in Scilly which I could pester the
  Librarian to unearth; and points which in my hurry I had overlooked before,
  began to take an air of importance. The old man Fournier, for instance; it
  seemed sort of queer that a taxidermist of Tangier should come all the way to
  Scilly for a month's holiday. Eh, what? What was old man Fournier doing at
  Scilly? Scilly's a likely place for wrecks. Was old man Fournier a hanger-on
  upon chance, a nautical Mr. Micawber waiting for a wreck to turn up which
  would suit his purpose? Or had he stage-managed by some means or other the
  <i>coup de theater</i> on Rosevear? It seemed funny that the short-sighted
  man should spot the wreck on Rosevear before the St. Agnes men, eh? Suppose
  M. Fournier and Ralph Warriner were partners in that pretty cargo! I walked
  straight out of that library, feeling quite certain that I held the right end
  of the skein. I had made a mistake in following up Warriner. I ought to have
  followed up the taxidermist. I walked about Falmouth all that day puzzling
  the business out; and I came to the conclusion that the sooner I crossed to
  the Scillies the better. I was by this time fairly excited, and I think I
  should have spent my last farthing in the hunt even if I had known that when
  I had run the mystery to earth, it would not profit me at all. I took a train
  that very evening, and pottered about from station to station all night. In
  the morning I got to Penzance, and kicked my heels on the wharf of the little
  dock there until nine o'clock, when the <i>Lyonnesse</i> started for St.
  Mary's. Three hours later I saw the islands hump themselves up from the sea,
  and I stared and stared at them till a genial being standing beside me said,
  'I suppose you haven't been home for a good many years.'&mdash;By the way,
  Mrs. Warriner," he suddenly broke off, "I have heard that natural sherry is a
  drink in some favour hereabouts. I can't say that it's a beverage I have ever
  hankered after before, but what with the sun and the talk, the thought of it
  is at the present moment most seductive. What if we rang down the curtain for
  ten minutes and had an <i>entr'acte</i>, eh? Would you mind?" And Wilbraham
  rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"No," said Miranda. "Please finish what you have to say now."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham sighed, resumed his seat and at the same time his
story.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <h3>EXPLAINS THE MYSTERY OF THE "TARIFA'S" CARGO</h3><br>

  <p>"AT St. Mary's," he continued, "I called at once upon the doctor. 'Ah,'
  said he, 'liver, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>"'Permanently enlarged by excessive indulgence in alcohol,' said I. 'I had
  once a very dear friend in the same case called Ralph Warriner.'"</p>

  <p>Here Miranda interrupted with considerable indignation. "There is not a
  word of truth in that."</p>

  <p>"There is not," Wilbraham agreed pleasantly; "but I had to introduce the
  subject some way, and my way was successful. 'Ralph Warriner!' exclaimed the
  doctor. 'And what was he dismissed the service for?' I winked very slowly,
  with intense cunning; 'I understand,' said the doctor, with a leer, though
  Heaven only knows what he did understand; I fancy he thought his reputation
  as a man of the world was at stake. After that the conversation went on
  swimmingly.</p>

  <p>"I was more than ever convinced that the discovery on Rosevear was a
  put-up job. If so, old man Fournier must have been aware of that wreck before
  he discovered it. He must have landed on the island and shoved those papers
  into the dead man's pocket; and someone must have sailed him out to the
  island. I determined to lay myself out to discover who that someone was; but
  I went no farther than the determination. There was not indeed any need that
  I should, for I sailed myself the next day to Rosevear. I hired the <i>St.
  Agnes</i> lugger, and Zebedee Isaacs, as he sat at the tiller, gave me news
  of old man Fournier. Old man Fournier was a desperate coward on the sea, yet
  he had put out to the Bishop on a most unpleasing day. It was old man
  Fournier who insisted that they should run through the Neck and examine
  Rosevear, and when Zebedee Isaacs declined the risk, old man Fournier flung
  himself in a passion on the tiller and nearly swamped the boat. All very
  queer, eh? M. Fournier must have had some fairly strong motive to nerve him
  to that pitch of audacity. And what that motive was I should discover when I
  discovered the nature of the <i>Tarifa's</i> cargo. I thought perpetually
  about that cargo, all the way to Rosevear, and after I had landed on that
  melancholy island. The truth came upon me in a moment of inspiration. The
  ground I remember gave way under my foot. I had trodden on a sea-bird's nest
  and stumbled forward on my knees, and with the shock of the stumble came the
  inspiration. I remained on my knees, with the gulls screaming overhead, and
  the grey wastes of ocean moaning about the unkindly rocks. And I knew! The
  taxidermist from Tangier, the longish packing-cases, the square
  boxes&mdash;Ralph Warriner and old man Fournier were running guns and
  ammunition into Morocco!"</p>

  <p>Miranda could not repress an exclamation. She had no doubt that Wilbraham
  was right; the theory fitted in with Ralph's adventurous character. M.
  Fournier no doubt made the arrangements, and provided the capital; Ralph
  worked the cargo across from England to Morocco. And to make it safe for
  himself to venture upon English soil, he had altered the rig of the
  <i>Tarifa</i> in some unfrequented port, and somehow arranged the deception
  concerning his death.</p>

  <p>"You think as I thought in Rosevear," said Wilbraham, looking shrewdly
  into her face. "I only wish you could participate in the delight I felt. I
  had my fingers on the secret now, and it was such a perfect, profitable
  secret, for, quite apart from the other affair, gun-running in Morocco is
  itself an offence against the law. I fairly hugged myself. 'Ambrose,' said I,
  'never in all your puff have you struck anything like this. Fouché you shall
  trample under foot and Sherlock Holmes shall be your washpot; you are the
  best in the world. The faceless mariner was a fraud, a freak from Barnum's.
  Here at last is Eldorado, and there's no fly anywhere upon the gilding.'
  Thus, Mrs. Warriner, I soliloquised, and took the next boat back to Penzance;
  from Penzance I travelled by train to Plymouth; from Plymouth I sailed in an
  Orient boat to Gib, and from Gib I crossed to Tangier, where I had a few
  minutes' conversation with one or two officers of the custom-house.</p>

  <p>"Morocco as a social institution has many points of convenience which it
  is useful for men like Warriner and myself to know. Here's a small case in
  point. If you wish to smuggle forbidden goods into the country, you hire the
  custom-house officials to unload your cargo for you at night somewhere on the
  beach. Thus you avoid much trouble, all chance of detection and you secure
  skilled workmen. I had no doubt that Warriner had followed this course. So I
  hired the custom-house officials to tell me the truth, and out it came. The
  <i>Tarifa</i> had landed its cargo in the bay a mile and a half from Tangier
  a couple of days before I arrived, and M. Fournier had supervised the
  unloading, and the captain of the <i>Tarifa</i> was no longer the grizzled
  sea-dog, Mr. Thomas Discipline, but a gentleman of a slight figure, blue
  eyes, and fair hair. That middle-aged cherub, in a word, with whom you and I
  are both familiar, and who now calls himself Mr. Jeremy Bentham. When I had
  derived this information I walked into M. Fournier's shop and bought a
  stuffed jackal. There was a tourist making purchases, so I asked my question
  quietly as I leaned my elbows on the counter.</p>

  <p>"'How did you work the situation on Rosevear?' said I, 'and how's my sweet
  friend, Ralph Warriner?'</p>

  <p>"The little Frenchman turned white and sick. He babbled expostulations and
  denials. He demanded my name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You gave him your card, I hope," interrupted Miranda, biting her lip.
  Wilbraham gazed at her with admiration. "Well, you have got some spirit. I
  will say that for you, Mrs. Warriner."</p>

  <p>"I am not in need of testimonials," said Miranda. "What of M.
  Fournier?"</p>

  <p>"He talked to me mysteries after that. 'You were in Tangier a month ago,'
  said he. 'You shouted "Look out!" through the door; you startled a friend of
  mine; you are a coward.' Would you believe it, the little worm turned? He
  flew into a violent passion; I suppose it was in just such a passion that he
  flung himself on Zebedee Isaacs at Scilly. A plucky little man for all his
  cowardice! He called me a number of ill names. However, I had got what I
  wanted. I crossed back to Gibraltar, and here I am."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham crossed his legs, and with a polite "You will permit me?"
  lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Miranda, with a contemptuous droop of her lips. "Having
  failed to blackmail M. Fournier and my husband, you fall back upon
  blackmailing a woman."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham's answer to the sneer was entirely unexpected, even by Miranda,
  who was prepared for the unexpected in this man. He showed no shame; he did
  not try to laugh away the slur; but removing his cigarette from his mouth, he
  turned deliberately his full face to her and in a deliberate voice said: "I
  do not take the conventional view upon these matters. And, all other things
  being equal, had I to choose between a man and a woman, I should spare the
  man and strike the woman."</p>

  <p>He spoke without any bitterness, but in a hard, calm voice, as though he
  had sounded the question to the bottom. Miranda gasped, the words for a
  second took her breath away, and then the blood came warmly into her cheeks,
  and her eyes softened and brightened and she smiled. A sudden glory seemed to
  illuminate her face. Wilbraham wondered why. He could not know that the
  brutal shock of his speech had sent her thoughts winging back to a balcony
  overlooking St. James's Park, where a man had held a torn glove in his hand
  and in a no less decided voice than Wilbraham's had spoken quite other
  words.</p>

  <p>"I never intended to address either Fournier or your husband upon the
  subject of&mdash;shall we call it compensation? At the best I should have got
  a lump sum now and again from them, and as I say, I have learnt my lesson. If
  I had a lump sum, it would be spent, and I should again be penniless. I apply
  to you because I propose a regular sum per annum paid quarterly in
  advance."</p>

  <p>Miranda was still uplifted by the contrast between her recollections and
  Wilbraham's words. She had the glove at home locked up, an evidence that
  succour was very near&mdash;a hundred miles only down the winding valley
  which faced her&mdash;and she had not even to say a word in order to command
  it. When she spoke again to Wilbraham she spoke emboldened by this
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"And what if I were to refuse you even a shilling for your dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I should be compelled to lay my information before the proper
  authorities, that Ralph Warriner is alive and may at times be captured in
  England."</p>

  <p>"Would you be surprised to hear that Mr. Warriner committed no crime for
  which he could be captured?"</p>

  <p>"I should be surprised beyond words. Mr. Warriner sold the mechanism of
  the Daventry gun to a foreign government."</p>

  <p>"Are you so sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"I was his agent."</p>

  <p>"You! Then you are also his accomplice."</p>

  <p>"True,&mdash;and I look forward to turning Queen's evidence."</p>

  <p>Miranda withdrew from the contest. The discussion was hardly more than
  academic, for she knew both that her husband was alive and that this
  particular crime he had committed.</p>

  <p>"What is your price?" she asked, and she sat down upon the bench.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham did not immediately reply. He took a pocket-book from his coat
  and a letter from the pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"I should wish you fully to understand the strength of my position," he
  said. "This letter you will see is in your husband's handwriting. This
  passage," and he folded the letter to show Miranda a line or two, "enjoins me
  to be very careful about the plans. The gun is not mentioned by name, but the
  date of the letter and the context leave no possible doubt."</p>

  <p>He fluttered the letter under Miranda's eyes and within reach of her
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"It is my one piece of evidence, but a convincing piece."</p>

  <p>He made a pretence of dropping it at her feet and snatched it up quickly.
  Then he replaced it in his pocket-book and shut up his pocket-book with a
  snap.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you snatch at it?" he exclaimed with irritation.</p>

  <p>"Why did you wish me to snatch at it?" she replied.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;because," he said angrily, "you have made me feel real
  mean, as mean as a man in the commission of his first dishonourable act
  towards a woman, and I wanted you to look mean at all events; it would have
  made my business easier to handle. Well, let's have done with it. I know
  Ralph Warriner is alive. I can give information which may lead to his
  capture; and there's always the disgrace to publish."</p>

  <p>He blurted out the words, ashamed and indignant with her for the shame he
  felt. Miranda, in spite of herself, was touched by Wilbraham's manner, and
  she answered quite gently: "Very well. I will buy your silence."</p>

  <p>"Coals of fire!" he replied with a sneer. Miranda understood that he was
  defying her to make him feel ashamed. "Is that the ticket, Mrs. Warriner? It
  won't lessen the amount of the per annum I can assure you. What I propose is
  to live for the future in some more or less quiet hole, where none of my
  acquaintances are likely to crop up. Tarifa occurred to me; for one thing I
  can reach you from Tarifa; for another I can do the royal act at Tarifa on a
  moderate income; for a third it is a quiet place where I can have a shot
  at&mdash;well, at what I want to do," and his voice suddenly became shy. She
  looked at him and he coloured under her glance, and he shifted in his seat
  and laughed awkwardly.</p>

  <p>Miranda was familiar with those signs and what they signified. Wilbraham
  wanted her to ask him to confide in her. Many men at Gibraltar had brought
  their troubles to her in just this way, with just these marks of diffidence,
  this fear that the troubles would bore her. She had been called upon to play
  the guardian-angel at times and had not shrunk from the responsibility,
  though she had accepted it with a saving modesty of humour at the notion of
  herself playing the guardian-angel to any man.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want to do?" she asked, and Wilbraham confided in her. The
  position was strange, no doubt. Here was a woman whom he had bullied, whom he
  meant to rob, and on whom he meant to live until he died, and he was
  confiding in her. But the words tumbled from his lips and he did not think of
  the relationship in which he stood to her. He was only aware that for fifteen
  years he had not shared a single one of his intimate thoughts with either man
  or woman, and he was surcharged with them. Here was a woman, frank, reliable,
  who asked for his confidence, and he gave it, with a schoolboy's mixture of
  eagerness and timidity.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said he, "the Odes of Horace have never been well
  translated into English verse by anyone? Some people have done an ode or two
  very well, perhaps as well as it could be done&mdash;Hood for instance tried
  his hand at it. But no one has done them all, with any approach to success.
  And yet they ought to be capable of translation. Perhaps they aren't&mdash;I
  don't know&mdash;perhaps they are too wonderfully perfect. Probably I should
  make an awful hash of the job; but I think I should like to have a shot. I
  began years and years ago when I was an attaché at Paris, and&mdash;and I
  have always kept the book with me; but one has had no time." As he spoke he
  drew from his side pocket a little copy of Horace in an old light-brown cover
  of leather very much frayed and scratched. "Look," said he, and half
  stretched it out to her, as though doubtful whether he should put it into her
  hands or refuse to let her take it at all. She held out her hand, and he made
  up his mind and gave it into her keeping.</p>

  <p>The copy was dated 1767; the rough black type, in which all the s's looked
  like f's, was margined by paper brown with age and sullied with the rims of
  tumblers and the stains of tobacco; and this stained margin was everywhere
  written over with ink in a small fine hand.</p>

  <p>"You see I have made a sort of ground-work," said Wilbraham, with a
  deprecating laugh, as though he feared Miranda would ridicule his efforts.
  The writing consisted of tags of verse, half-lines, here and there complete
  lines, and sometimes, though rarely, a complete stanza. "You must not judge
  by what you see there," he made haste to add. "All I have written on the
  margin is purely tentative; probably it's no good at all." Miranda turned
  over a page and came upon one ode completely translated. "I did that,"
  explained Wilbraham, "one season when I shipped as a hand on a Yarmouth
  smack. We got bad weather on the Dogger Bank, out in the North Sea at
  Christmas. We spent a good deal of time hove to with the wheel lashed, and on
  night-watches I used to make up the verses. Indeed, those night-watches seem
  the only time I have had free during the last fifteen years. The rest of the
  time&mdash;well, I have told you about it. I got through one complete ode out
  in the North Sea, and did parts of others."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner began to read the ode. "May I?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, with a flush of pleasure, and he watched her most
  earnestly for the involuntary signs of approval or censure. But her face
  betrayed neither the one nor the other; and he was quick to apologise for the
  ode's shortcomings.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think that I had a great deal of time on those night-watches.
  For one thing we did not get over-much sleep on the voyage, and so one's
  brains no doubt were a trifle dull. Besides, there were always seas combing
  up above the bows and roaring along the deck. You had to keep your eyes open
  for them and scuttle down the companion before they came on board. Otherwise,
  if the weight of the water took you, it was a case of this way to the pit.
  The whole hull of the smack disappears, and you just see the foresail
  sticking up from the hungry, lashing tumble of green water. So, you see, it
  stands to reason that ode is subject to revision."</p>

  <p>But Miranda was not thinking of the ode. She had a vision of the smack
  labouring on a black night in the trough of a black sea flecked with white,
  at Christmas time, and a man on the watch, who had been an attaché at Paris,
  and was, even with the rude sailor-folk for his companions, engaged in
  translating Horace; and the vision had an exquisite pathos for her.</p>

  <p>"What was the beginning of it all?" she asked in a low voice, and since
  Wilbraham was in the train of confidences, he told her that too.</p>

  <p>He told her perhaps more than he meant to tell. It was an old story, the
  story of the faithless woman and the man who trusts her, and what comes of it
  all. The story of Helen and Menelaus, but disfigured into a caricature of its
  original by the paltriness of the characters and the vulgarity of the
  incidents. The throb of primitive passion was gone from the story, and
  therefore all dignity too. Subtle and intricate trivialities of sentiment
  took the place of passion, and made the episode infinitely mean. Menelaus was
  an attaché at Paris: Helen lived at Knightsbridge, and the pair of them were
  engaged to be married. Helen was faithless merely through a cheap vanity, and
  a cheaper pose of wilfulness, and even so she was faithless merely in a low
  and despicable way. It was an infidelity of innumerable flirtations. She
  passed from arm to arm without intermission, and almost allowed those who
  fondled her to overlap. Yet all the day she talked of her pride, and was
  conscious of no inconsistency between the vulgarity of her conduct and the
  high words upon her lips. She practised all the small necessary deceits to
  conceal her various meetings and appointments, and was unaware of the
  degradation they involved; for still she talked loudly of her pride. And when
  Menelaus lifted his hat and wished her good-morning, she only felt that she
  was deeply aggrieved.</p>

  <p>Menelaus, however, was in no better case. He had not the strength to
  thrust her from his mind, but let his thoughts play sensuously with his
  recollections, until he declined upon a greater and a greater weakness.</p>

  <p>"I went back to Paris," continued Wilbraham. "I had good prospects, but
  they came to nothing. Even now men going in for Mods. have to get up a book
  which I once wrote, and as for the service, if I were to tell you my real
  name, it is just possible that you might have heard it, for I was supposed to
  have done something quite decent at Zanzibar. Well, I went back to Paris.
  It's a hard thing, you know, to discover that the woman you have been working
  for, and in a way succeeding for, isn't worth the nicotine at the bottom of
  your pipe-bowl. At that time I reckon I would rather have been the wreck I am
  now, and believed it was all my fault, for, you see, I might then have
  imagined that if I had done all right, I should have won the desirable
  woman.... Anyway, after I got back to Paris, a little while after, there was
  trouble." Wilbraham examined his cane and drew diagrams upon the ground. "The
  woman blabbed, in a moment of confidence ... to her husband. There was a sort
  of a scandal.... I had to go. I didn't blame the woman who blabbed; no, Mrs.
  Warriner, I blamed the first woman, the woman in Knightsbridge. Was I right?
  I came back to England. I was a second son, and my father slammed the door in
  my face. Then, Mrs. Warriner, I blamed all women, you&mdash;you&mdash;you
  amongst the others, even though I didn't know you." He spoke in a gust of
  extraordinary violence, and so brought his confidences to an end. "Now your
  income is&mdash;" he resumed, and fetched out his pocket-book again. "I made
  a note about your estate when I was doing business with Warriner," he said.
  "The note comes in usefully now."</p>

  <p>He found the details of which he was in search, and made a neat little sum
  at the corner of the leaf, to which Miranda paid no attention whatsoever. The
  queer inclination towards pity which had moved her to ask for his confidence,
  had been entirely and finally destroyed by the confidence she had asked for.
  The story was so utterly sordid; the characters in it so utterly puny. Before
  he told it he had acquired in her eyes even a sort of dignity, the dignity of
  a man battered and defeated in a battle wherein his wits were unequally
  matched against the solid forces of order; but in the telling he had
  destroyed that impression. Miranda had no feeling now but one of aversion for
  the wreck of a man at her side. She looked at the Horace, which still lay
  open on her lap, and the contrast between the fine scholar's handwriting and
  the stains of the pothouse had no longer any power to touch her. She set the
  book down on the bench, and stood up.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham stopped his calculations, and, with the stump of his pencil in
  his mouth, looked at her alertly and furtively. She took a step or two
  towards the parapet of the Alameda. Wilbraham instantly laid his pocket-book
  on the seat with the pencil to mark the place, and without any noise, stood
  up. Miranda reached the railings at the edge of the gardens and leaned her
  arms upon it. The next moment she felt a firm grip upon her elbow. She turned
  round and saw Wilbraham's face ablaze with passion. "I suspected that," he
  said fiercely, "when first I saw where you had brought me," and he shook her
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"Suspected what?" exclaimed Miranda, and she drew away to free herself
  from his grasp. Wilbraham's next movement answered her question. For he
  slipped between her and the railings with a glance at the precipice
  below.</p>

  <p>"But you shall not do it," he continued. "I was robbed that way once
  before; I'll take care the robbery is not repeated." He leaned his back
  against the railings and shook his finger at her.</p>

  <p>"Besides, there's no sense in it," and he jerked his head backwards to
  signify the abysm. "You are crying out before you are hurt. You don't even
  know how much I want; I shan't ruin you. I made a mistake that way once; I
  had the best secret conceivable, and ran my man down across two continents.
  Then I was fool enough to put my hand too deep in his sky, and I suppose he
  thought&mdash;well, he blew his brains out that night, and then was I
  robbed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner stared at him with a growing horror in her eyes. "You
  murdered him," she said slowly.</p>

  <p>"We won't quarrel over words," said Wilbraham, callously.</p>

  <p>Miranda walked back to the bench. She was not troubled to explain
  Wilbraham's misconception of her movement. She was only anxious to be rid of
  him. "What income do you want?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You have three thousand a year," he returned. "Of that I take it Warriner
  takes a largish slice."</p>

  <p>Miranda flushed. "My husband has never asked for a farthing since the
  <i>Ten Brothers</i> slipped out of Gibraltar. He has never received a
  farthing," she said angrily.</p>

  <p>"An imprudent remark," said Wilbraham. "I might feel inclined to raise my
  price."</p>

  <p>"At all events you shall not slander him."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham looked at her with his head cocked on one side. "You are very
  loyal," said he, with genuine admiration. "I will not raise my price."</p>

  <p>Miranda did not, by any gesture or word, acknowledge his compliment. She
  stood over against him with a face just as hard and white as he had shown to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I say seven hundred a year," he said briefly. "I will call for it myself
  every quarter."</p>

  <p>"I will send it to you," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to call for it," said he; for so he concealed his own address
  and kept her within his reach. "You will not leave Ronda even for a week
  without giving me due notice of your destination. I will take a quarter's
  payment to-day. You draw on a bank in Ronda, I suppose, so a cheque will
  serve."</p>

  <p>"If you will wait here, I will bring you the cheque."</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes afterwards she returned with it to the Alameda, where she
  found Wilbraham seated on the bench with his Horace in his hand. He put down
  the book awkwardly, and rose. He had the grace to feel some discomfort as he
  took the cheque, and that discomfort his manner expressed.</p>

  <p>Miranda had no word, no look, for him. He stood perhaps for the space of a
  minute fingering the cheque. Then he said suddenly: "I can't imagine what a
  woman like you sees in Ralph Warriner to trouble about. In your place I
  should have let him go his own way, without paying to keep him out of
  prison."</p>

  <p>Miranda kept her reasons to herself, as she had done with the reason of
  her return to Ronda. She waited for him to go, and he walked sullenly
  away&mdash;for ten yards. Then he returned, for he had left his copy of
  Horace lying upon the bench. He picked it up with a curious and almost
  timorous glance of appeal towards Miranda. She did not move but waited
  implacably for his departure. Wilbraham worked his shoulders in
  discomfort.</p>

  <p>"My clothes don't fit and God hates me," he cried irritably. Then this
  jack-in-the-box of fortune slunk out of her sight.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>SHOWS THE USE WHICH A BLIND MAN MAY MAKE OF A DARK NIGHT A WEEK</h3><br>

  <p class="first">A WEEK after Wilbraham's departure from Ronda, the night
  fell very dark at Tangier. In the Sôk outside the city gate, the solitary
  electric lamp from its tall mast threw a pale light over a circle of the
  trampled grass, but outside the circle all was black. There was no glimmer in
  the tents of the shoemakers at the upper corner of the Sôk; nor was there any
  stir or noise. For it was past midnight and the world was asleep&mdash;except
  at one spot on the hill-side above the Sôk, and a little distance to the
  right.</p>

  <p>There a small villa, standing by itself, shone gaudily in the heart of the
  blackness. From its open windows a yellow flood of light streamed out, and
  besides the light, the music of a single violin and the rhythmical beat of
  feet. There were other noises too, such as the popping of corks, and much
  laughter.</p>

  <p>Outside the villa, and beyond the range of its light, a man and a boy sat
  patient and silent. The man for his sole clothing wore a sack, but a dark
  cloak lay on the ground beside him. With his hands he continually tested a
  cord twisted from palmetto fibres, as though doubtful of its strength. At
  length the door of the villa opened.</p>

  <p>"Who comes out?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"A man and a woman," answered the boy.</p>

  <p>"Describe the man to me."</p>

  <p>"Big, fat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is enough."</p>

  <p>The man and the woman passed through the little garden of the villa, and
  walked down across the Sôk towards the city gate. The door opened again and
  again. There was a continual sound of leave-taking in different languages,
  mostly German and French, and between the man and the boy the same dialogue
  was repeated and repeated. Some wore evening dress, others did not. Some
  walked across the Sôk, others rode.</p>

  <p>"They are all gone," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"Wait," commanded the man.</p>

  <p>"They are putting out the lights."</p>

  <p>"Are all the lights out?"</p>

  <p>"No, one light is burning."</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>The door opened again, and two men in evening dress came out on to the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"There are two men," said the boy, "but only one wears a hat."</p>

  <p>"Describe him to me."</p>

  <p>"He is not tall, he is thin, but I cannot see his face for his hat."</p>

  <p>"Look! look well!"</p>

  <p>"He goes back into the house. He takes off his hat. Wait! He is smoking.
  He strikes a match and holds it to his mouth. I can see him now."</p>

  <p>"Well! Of what colour is his hair?"</p>

  <p>"Very fair&mdash;yellow. His face is round, his eyes are light."</p>

  <p>The man in the sack ceased from his questions, but he gave no sign of
  either approval or disappointment. He sat still in the darkness until a voice
  from the little garden cried out with a French accent: "I cannot think what
  has come to the beast. He has got loose. And he was hobbled, Jeremy. You did
  hobble him, <i>hein?</i>"</p>

  <p>The boy began to laugh. "The little fat Christian is looking for the mule
  in the garden," said he. "Hush!" whispered the man, laying his hand upon the
  boy's mouth. "Listen! What does the other answer? Listen for his voice."</p>

  <p>"He does not answer," returned the boy. "He leans against the door, and
  smokes and waits, while the little fat Room searches for the mule."</p>

  <p>"Help to find the mule!"</p>

  <p>The boy laughed again, rose from the ground, and disappeared into the
  darkness. In a few minutes he returned, driving the mule in front of him. He
  drove it through the wicket of the garden. A few words passed between the
  little Frenchman and the boy. Then the boy came back to the man seated
  patiently outside the rim of the villa's lights.</p>

  <p>"What did he say to thee?" said the man.</p>

  <p>"He asked me if I had stolen the hobbles."</p>

  <p>"And thou didst answer?"</p>

  <p>"That I knew nothing of the hobbles. I said that I had found the mule
  loose in the Sôk, and seeing the lights, brought it to the house."</p>

  <p>"It is well. Now go, my son; go home and sleep, and forget the hours we
  have waited in the darkness outside the villa of the Room. Forget, so that in
  the morning they shall never have been. Go! God will reward thee!"</p>

  <p>The boy turned upon his heel, and ran down towards the town. The man was
  left alone. He remained squatting on the ground. He heard the French voice
  exclaim: "Good-night, Jeremy."</p>

  <p>But no answering voice returned the wish. Jeremy indeed contented himself
  with a careless nod of the head, mounted his mule, and passed out of the
  wicket gate. Jeremy passed within ten yards of the man seated upon the
  ground, who heard the padding of the mule's feet upon the grass and smelt the
  cigar.</p>

  <p>He did not move, however. A road ran between this stretch of grass and the
  Sôk beyond, and he waited until the mule's hooves rang upon it. Then he
  picked up the dark cloak by his side and ran swiftly and noiselessly down the
  grass, across the road, over the trampled Sôk. Ahead of him he heard the
  leisurely amble of the mule.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he cried out in the Moghrebbin dialect. "I have the hobbles of the
  most noble one."</p>

  <p>He heard the mule stop, and ran lightly forward.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked Jeremy, in the same tongue, as he bent round in his
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"Hassan Akbar," cried the other, leaping at the point from which the voice
  came. "Bentham, it is Hassan Akbar."</p>

  <p>The man addressed as Bentham turned quickly in his saddle with a cry and
  gathered up the reins; but he was too late. Even the cry was stifled upon his
  lips. For Hassan threw the cloak over his head, gathered it in tight round
  his neck, and still holding him by the neck, dragged him out of the saddle
  and flung him on to the ground. Bentham, half-throttled, half-stunned, lay
  for a moment or two upon his back, limp and unresisting. When he came to
  himself, it was no longer within his power to resist, for Hassan knelt
  straddled across his body, pinning him to the ground with the weight of his
  stature. One bony knee pressed upon his chest insufferably. Bentham's ribs
  cracked under it; he felt that his ribs were being driven into his lungs. The
  other knee held down his thighs, and while he lay there incapable of defence,
  Hassan bound his arms tightly together with the cord of palmetto fibres.</p>

  <p>Bentham tried to shout, but the cloak was over his mouth: the knee was
  grinding and boring into his chest, and his shout was an exiguous wail which,
  when it had penetrated the cloak, was no more than a sigh. He waited for the
  moment when the knee would be removed, and waited motionless without a twitch
  of his muscles, so that Hassan might be deceived into the belief that he had
  swooned, and remove his knee and the cloak.</p>

  <p>Hassan removed his knees, bent down to Bentham, twined one arm about his
  legs, thrust the other underneath his neck, and lifted him from the ground as
  though he was a child. Bentham was now less able to shout than before, for
  the hand of the arm which was about his neck pressed the cloak close upon his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Bentham struggled for his breath; Hassan's arms only tightened their grip
  and held him like a coil of wire. An utter terror seized upon Bentham. He
  remembered the darkness of the night, the lateness of the hour, the silence
  of the Sôk, and from the manner of Hassan's walk, he knew that he was being
  carried up the hill and away from Tangier. He was helpless in the hands of a
  Moor whom he had irreparably wronged. Death he knew he must expect; the
  question which troubled him was what kind of death.</p>

  <p>Hassan's foot struck against a rope drawn tight across his path, and in
  Bentham hope for a moment revived. The rope was the stay of a tent, no doubt.
  What if Hassan had lost his way and stumbled among the tents of the
  shoemakers? But Hassan loosened the grip of the arm which held his legs, and
  Bentham heard him fumbling with his hand for the door-flap of the tent.
  Plainly Hassan had not missed his way.</p>

  <p>Hassan dropt him on the ground, thrust him through the small opening, and
  crawled in after him. Then he knelt beside Bentham, turned back the cloak
  from his face, but tied it securely about his mouth. Bentham could now see,
  and the flap of the tent was open. The tent was indeed one of the low, tiny
  gunny-bag tents of the shoemakers, but it was set far apart from that small
  cluster, as Bentham recognized in despair, for through the aperture he could
  see a long way below him and a long way to his right the electric light in
  the middle of the Sôk.</p>

  <p>Outside the tent there was a sound of something moving. Bentham sat up and
  tore at his gag with his bound hands.</p>

  <p>"Why cry for help to a mule?" said Hassan, calmly. "Will a mule help
  thee?" He leaned forward and tightened the knot which fastened the cloak at
  the back of his head. Then he crawled out of the tent and Bentham heard him
  tethering the mule to one of the tent-pegs.</p>

  <p>Bentham was thus left alone. He had a few seconds, and he had at once to
  determine what use he would make of those seconds. There was not enough time
  wherein to free his hands. It would have been sheer waste of time to free his
  mouth from the cloak. For none was within earshot of that tent who would be
  concerned to discover the reason of a cry, and the cry would not be repeated,
  since Hassan outside the tent was still within arm's reach.</p>

  <p>Instead, he hitched and worked his white waistcoat upwards from the
  bottom, leaning forward the while, until his watch fell from the pocket and
  dangled on the end of the chain; after his watch a metal pencil-case rolled
  out and dropped between his knees. One of the two things he meant to do was
  done. Hassan had bound his hands not palm to palm, but wrist across wrist;
  and raising his hands he was able with the tips of his right-hand fingers to
  feel in the left-hand breast-pocket of his dress-coat. His fingers touched a
  small pocket-book, opened it, and plucked out a leaf of paper. This leaf and
  the pencil-case he secreted in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>Hassan crawled back into the tent and closed the flap. Bentham, with his
  knees drawn up to his chin, crouched back against the wall of the tent. Now
  that the flap was closed, it was pitch-dark; that, however, made no
  difference to Hassan Akbar, who lived in darkness, and out of the darkness
  his voice spoke.</p>

  <p>"The ways of God are very wonderful. You gave me this tent. With the
  dollar you dropped on my knees at the gate of the cemetery, I bought this
  tent and set it up here apart, to keep you safe for the little time before
  you start upon your journey."</p>

  <p>Bentham took no comfort from the passionless voice, though his heart
  leaped at the words. He was not then to be killed. He did not answer Hassan,
  but remained crouched in his corner.</p>

  <p>"Now the dog of a Christian will speak," said Hassan, quietly. Bentham
  made no movement. Hassan crawled towards him, felt his feet, his up-drawn
  knees, and reaching his face untied the cloak from his mouth. "Now the dog of
  a Christian will speak," he repeated softly, in a low gentle voice, "so that
  I may know it is indeed Bentham, who took shelter with me at Tangier, and ate
  of my <i>kouss-kouss</i>, and thereafter betrayed me."</p>

  <p>Bentham did not reply. If Hassan had a doubt, then it was his part to make
  the most of it to prolong the solution of the doubt, to defer it, if it might
  be, till the morning came. This was summer&mdash;July&mdash;the morning comes
  early in July, not so early as in June, but still early. Would that this had
  happened one month back!</p>

  <p>Hassan kneeled upon his hams by Bentham's side. "Will not the dog of a
  Christian speak?" he asked in a wheedling voice, which daunted and chilled
  the man he spoke to. "Let us see!" And again his sinuous hands lingered and
  stole over Bentham's face. The thumbs lingered about Bentham's eyes.</p>

  <p>Bentham shivered; but still, though the desire to shout, to curse, to
  relieve by some violence, if only of speech, the tension he was suffering,
  was strong, he mastered himself, he held his tongue, for if once he did speak
  he betrayed himself. His only chance lay in Hassan's doubt, which lived upon
  his silence. Again Hassan's fingers returned to his face. Bentham closed his
  eyes; the thumbs touched and retouched them, now pressing gently upon the
  eyeballs, now working about the corners of the sockets. Finally Hassan
  snatched his hands away. "If I did that," he murmured, "they would not take
  him, for he would fetch no price;" and Bentham understood the fate which was
  in store for him&mdash;if he spoke.</p>

  <p>Hassan left his side, and was busy in a corner of the tent, at what
  Bentham could not for the moment discover. He heard a cracking of twigs; what
  was to follow? One instant he dreaded, the next he burned to know, and all
  the while he shivered with terror. Hassan struck a match and lit the twigs,
  and breathed upon the little blue flames, until they warmed to yellow, and
  spirted up into a fire.</p>

  <p>Bentham watched Hassan's gaunt, disfigured, inexpressive face, as he
  crouched over the twigs, and his terror increased. He saw that he held
  something in each hand, something that flashed bright, like a disk of iron.
  Hassan laid the disks upon the twigs; they were the hobbles which Bentham had
  placed upon his mule early that evening.</p>

  <p>Bentham began to count the seconds; at any moment the morning might begin
  to break, surely, surely. As he watched the hobbles growing hot and the
  sparks dance upon the iron, he continued to count the seconds, not knowing
  what he did, and at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Hassan picked up the hobbles, each with a cleft stick, and brought them
  over to Bentham. "Now the dog of a Christian will speak," said he.</p>

  <p>Bentham summoned all his courage, all his strength, and was silent. Hassan
  reached out his hands, and drew his legs from under him, and fitted the
  hobbles over his slippers, and fixed them round his ankles like a pair of
  fetters.</p>

  <p>Bentham uttered a cry&mdash;it was almost a scream&mdash;as the iron burnt
  into his flesh. He kicked, he struggled to free his legs, to free his hands;
  but Hassan Akbar dragged him forward, thrust him down upon his back, and
  pinned his shoulders to the ground. Bentham could do no more than vainly
  writhe in convulsive movements of his limbs. The hot iron rings clung to his
  ankles; the smoke from the wood fire choked him; the smell of burning flesh
  was acrid in his nostrils. Agony redoubled his strength, but even so, he was
  too crippled, and Hassan's grasp upon his shoulders did not relax.</p>

  <p>In the end Hassan had his heart's desire, and Bentham spoke. He spoke too
  in the low voice which Hassan enjoined, though he used it without thought to
  obey,&mdash;low, voluble, earnest prayers for mercy, and then again voluble
  curses, and again voluble appeals for pity, and at the end of it a broken
  whimpering, as though his strength was gone, and the convulsive jerks which a
  fish makes in a basket.</p>

  <p>All the while Hassan held him down, listening to the appeals, the prayers,
  the curses, with an untouched gravity of face. "It is indeed you; I have made
  no mistake," and he freed him from the burning fetters, and opened the flap
  of the tent. Bentham rolled over on his side with his face to the opening,
  and lay there shaking, moaning. "Now I will tell you what I have planned for
  you," continued Hassan. "I thought at first to kill you, but it is so small a
  thing. Then I remembered words you once told me, that you had trouble with
  your own people, and could not ask them for protection. So friends of mine
  from Beni Hassan, who go upon their way to-night, will take you with them,
  and sell you when they are far away. And for the rest of your days you will
  carry loads upon your back up and down the inlands of Morocco, and your
  masters will beat you, and if you faint and are tired, they will do strange
  things to make you suffer, even as I did with the hobbles. Lo, here my
  friends come!"</p>

  <p>The sound of steps came to their ears. A few moments later a hand fumbled
  at the flap of the tent, opened it, and a head was thrust in. "Is it you,
  Hassan Akbar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Hassan; "and here is the Room whom you promised to take out
  of my path. He will fetch a price, and besides I give to you his mule, which
  you will find tethered to the tent."</p>

  <p>"And the saddle too, Hassan, is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Hassan cut Bentham's clothes from him as he lay upon the ground,
  and taking off his own sack, cast it for a garment over Bentham's shoulders,
  and wrapped himself in the dark cloak. In the place of that cloak he tied
  over Bentham's mouth a thick rag. Then he thrust him out of the tent, and
  jerked him on to his feet. Bentham made no longer any resistance; he let them
  do with him as they were pleased; and he stood tottering and swaying.</p>

  <p>Five Arabs waited outside the tent. "He cannot walk, he shall ride the
  mule this night," said the chief of them. "To-morrow he shall learn to
  walk."</p>

  <p>They hoisted Bentham on to the back of the mule, and tied him there with
  leathern thongs. Then they started on their long journey.</p>

  <p>The cool night air after the stifling tent revived the man who perforce
  rode the mule. It did not give him strength to resist, or as yet even the
  impulse to cry out; but it restored to him the power to hear and to
  understand. What he heard was a distant clock below him in Tangier striking
  an hour; what he understood was that the hour it struck was only one
  o'clock.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>M. FOURNIER EXPOUNDS THE ADVANTAGES WHICH EACH SEX HAS OVER THE
  OTHER</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE long interview with Wilbraham in the Alameda of Ronda
  had consequences for Miranda which she felt but did not trace to their
  source. It was not merely that she sickened at the vulgar, futile story of
  his ruin; that she saw in imagination the wretched victim he had run to earth
  across two continents, closing the door and slipping the pistol-barrel
  between his teeth; that she loathed the knowledge that this man was
  henceforward her gaoler; but she took him and the bitter years of her
  marriage together in her thoughts, and using them as premisses began
  doubtfully to draw universal conclusions.</p>

  <p>These conclusions Miranda hazarded at times in the form of questions to
  her companion Jane Holt, and sought answers from her as from one who had
  great experience of the tortuous conduct of men. Were men trustworthy at all?
  If so, were there any means by which a woman could test their
  trustworthiness? These two questions were the most constant upon Miranda's
  tongue, and Jane Holt answered them with assurance, and in her own way.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham had not erred when he described her as a sentimentalist with
  grievances. Sentimentalism was the shallows of her nature, and she had no
  depths. Her conversation ran continually upon the "big things," as she termed
  them, such as devotion, endurance, self-sacrifice, and the rest, in which
  qualities men were singularly deficient. She meant, however, only devotion to
  her, endurance of her, self-sacrifice for her, of which it was not unnatural
  that men should tire, seeing who it was that demanded them. Yet she had
  enjoyed her share, and more than her share. For though incapable of passion
  herself, she had in her youth possessed the trick of inspiring it, but
  without the power, perhaps through her own incapacity, of keeping it alive,
  and no doubt too because upon a moderate acquaintance she conveyed an
  impression of inherent falsity. For, being a sentimentalist, she lived in a
  false world, on the borders of a lie, never quite telling it perhaps, and
  certainly never quite not telling it. She was by nature exigent, for she was
  in her own eyes the pivot of her little world, and for the wider world
  beyond, she had no eyes whatever. And her exigence took amusing or irritating
  shapes according to the point of view of those who suffered it. For instance,
  you must never praise her costumes, of which she had many, and those worthy
  of praise, but the high qualities of her mind, which were few and often of no
  taste whatever. It should be added that she had always favoured an inferior
  before an equal. For it pleased her above all things to condescend, since she
  secured thus a double flattery, in the knowledge of her own condescension,
  and in the grateful humility of those to whom she condescended.</p>

  <p>It can be foreseen, then, what answers this woman,&mdash;who was tall, and
  still retained the elegance of her figure, and would have still retained the
  good looks of her face, but that it was written upon by many
  grievances&mdash;would give to Miranda's questions.</p>

  <p>"You can trust no men. You must bribe them with cajoleries; you must play
  the coquette; you must enlist their vanity. They are all trivial, and the big
  things do not appeal to them."</p>

  <p>Miranda listened. She was accustomed to Jane Holt, and had no longer a
  reasoned conception of her character. Habit had dulled her impressions. She
  remembered only that Jane Holt had had much experience of men wherein she
  herself was wofully deficient. Jane Holt embroidered her theme; a pretty
  display of petulance, the seemingly accidental disclosure of an ankle, a
  voluntary involuntary pressure of the arm, these things had power to persuade
  the male mind, such as it is, and to enmesh that worthless thing the male
  heart.</p>

  <p>"One might have a man for a friend, perhaps," suggested Miranda,
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>"My poor Miranda!" exclaimed Miss Holt. "No wonder your marriage was a
  failure. Men pretend friendship for a woman at times, but they mean something
  else."</p>

  <p>The moral was always that they were not to be trusted, and Miranda,
  vividly recollecting Ralph Warriner and Wilbraham, listened and wondered,
  listened and wondered, until she would rise of a sudden and take refuge in
  her own parlour, of which the window looked out across the valley to the
  hills, where she would sit with a throbbing forehead pressed upon her palms,
  certain, certain, that the homily was not true, and yet half distracted lest
  it should be true.</p>

  <p>On the morrow of one such conversation, and one such flight, Miss Holt
  came into the little parlour&mdash;a cool, dark-panelled, low-roofed room of
  which the door gave on to the patio&mdash;and found Miranda searching the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what month this is?" Miss Holt asked severely.</p>

  <p>"October."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," and great emphasis was laid upon the words.</p>

  <p>"I know," replied Miranda, penitently, as she crossed over to a table and
  lifted the books. "We have been here all the summer; it has been very hot. I
  am sorry, but I was compelled to stay. I did not know what might occur, and,"
  she anxiously turned over the letters and papers on her writing-table in the
  window, "it was some comfort, I admit, to feel that one was near&mdash;" She
  stopped suddenly and resumed in confusion, "I mean I did not know what might
  happen."</p>

  <p>Jane Holt looked at her with great displeasure, but said nothing until
  Miranda began hurriedly to open and shut the drawers of her writing-table.
  Then she said irritably: "What in the world are you looking for?"</p>

  <p>Miranda stood up and looked round the room. "There was a glove," she said
  absently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I threw it away."</p>

  <p>"Threw it away!" Miranda stared at Jane Holt with a look of complete
  dismay. "You don't mean that. Oh, you can't mean it!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do; it was torn across the palm."</p>

  <p>"I left it lying there, on my writing-desk, yesterday, after you and I had
  been talking&mdash;" She left the sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I found it there. It was torn, so I had it thrown away."</p>

  <p>Miranda rang a hand-bell, and ordered search to be made for the glove. It
  could not be found; it had been burnt with the answered letters.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miranda, and the servant retired. Miranda sat down, and
  showed to Jane Holt a face of which the expression was almost scared.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" exclaimed Jane. "The glove was torn; you could
  never have used it."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Miranda, quickly, almost guiltily it seemed. "I should
  never have used it; I never meant to use it. The glove was only a symbol; it
  was no more than that, it represented a belief. I can retain the belief, no
  doubt. No doubt, though, I have lost the glove&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What in the world are you talking about?" interrupted Jane Holt.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing," answered Miranda, with a start. The loss of the glove
  had so dismayed her that she had forgotten who it was she had been speaking
  to, or indeed that she was speaking to anyone. She had merely uttered her
  thoughts, for she had come to look upon that glove, which, under no
  circumstances, would she use, as none the less a safeguard, and of late, in
  particular, she had fallen into a habit of taking it from the drawer in which
  it rested and setting it before her eyes; of stating it, as it were, as a
  refutation of Jane Holt's ready opinions.</p>

  <p>Jane Holt shook her head. "You have changed very much towards me, Miranda.
  You are growing secret. I don't want to know. I would not press anyone for
  their confidence; but I may think it strange, I suppose?" She folded her arms
  across her breast and tapped with her fingers upon her elbows. "I suppose I
  may think it strange; and if anyone took the trouble to give me a thought,
  perhaps anyone might believe that I had a right to feel hurt. But I don't!
  Please don't run away with that idea! No, I cannot allow you, Miranda, to
  fancy for a moment that I should feel hurt. But I do notice that you jump
  whenever there is a knock at the door. There! What did I say?"</p>

  <p>The door of the parlour stood open to the patio; in the corner of the
  opposite side of the patio there was the mouth of a passage which led to the
  outer door; and upon that outer door just at this moment someone rapped
  heavily, as though he came in haste. Miranda started nervously, and to cover
  the movement, rose from her chair and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"And as for the glove," resumed Jane Holt, who found it difficult to leave
  any subject alone when it was evident that it was unwelcome, "you could never
  have used it."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Miranda, thoughtfully. "Of course&mdash;of course, I could
  never have used it;" and a servant entered the room and handed to her a card
  on which was engraved M. Fournier's name and address.</p>

  <p>Miranda held the card beneath her eyes for some little while. Then she
  walked out into the patio, where M. Fournier awaited her. He came towards her
  at once, in an extreme agitation, but she signed to him to be silent, and
  opening a second door on the same side of the patio as the door of her
  parlour, but farther to the right, she led the way into a tiny garden rich
  with deep colours. Jonquils, camellias, roses, wild geraniums, and pinks,
  tended with a care which bespoke a mistress from another country, made a gay
  blaze in the sun, and sweetened the air with their delicate perfumes.</p>

  <p>The garden was an irregular nook with something or the shape of a
  triangle, enclosed between the back wall of the house and a wing flung out at
  a right angle. The base of the triangle was an old brick wall, breast-high,
  which began at the end of the house wall and curved outwards until it reached
  the wing. Over this wall the eye looked through air to the olive-planted
  slope of a mountain. For the house was built on the brink of the precipice,
  it was in a line with the Alameda, though divided from it by the great chasm,
  and if one leaned over the crumbling wall built long ago by the Moors, one
  had an impression that one ought to see the waves churning at the foot of the
  rock and to hear a faint moaning of the sea; so that the sight of the level
  carpet of the plain continually surprised the eyes.</p>

  <p>Into this garden Miranda brought M. Fournier. No windows overlooked it,
  for those which gave light to Miranda's parlour were in the end and the other
  side of the wing, and so commanded the valley without commanding this
  enclosure. A little flagged causeway opened a path between the flowers to the
  nook between the wing of the house and the old wall, where two lounge chairs
  invited use.</p>

  <p>Miranda seated herself in one of these chairs and with a gesture offered
  the other to M. Fournier. M. Fournier, however, took no heed of the
  invitation. He had eyes only for Miranda's face. He held his hat in one hand,
  and with a coloured handkerchief continually mopped his forehead, a dusty
  perspiring image of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"You come from my husband?" said Miranda.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's face lightened. "Ah, then, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That he is alive? Yes. You come from him?"</p>

  <p>"From him, no; on his behalf, yes."</p>

  <p>Miranda smiled at the subtle distinction. "You need money, of course," she
  said drily. "How much do you want? You have, no doubt, some authority from my
  husband."</p>

  <p>The little Belgian's anxiety gave place to offended pride. "We do not need
  money, neither he nor I; but as for authority, perhaps this will serve."</p>

  <p>He drew from his pocket a soiled scrap of paper and handed it to Miranda.
  The paper, as she could see from the blue lines, the shape, and the jagged
  border, had been torn from a small pocketbook. It was so crumpled and soiled
  that a few words scribbled with a pencil on the outside in Arabic were barely
  visible. Miranda unfolded the paper slowly, for the mere look of it was
  sinister. The words within were written also in pencil, and her face altered
  as she read them.</p>

  <p>"What does J. B. mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"J. B. are the initials of the name he took."</p>

  <p>"You are sure this comes from my husband? I do not recognise his
  hand."</p>

  <p>"Quite sure."</p>

  <p>"Here is bad news," said she, and she conned the words over again, and
  could nowhere pick out the familiar characteristics of Ralph Warriner's
  handwriting. The words themselves were startling. <i>Reward the bearer well,
  and for God's sake do quickly what you can</i>. But more startling, more
  significant, than the words was the agitation of the writer's hand. Haste and
  terror had kept the hand wavering. Here the pencil had paused, yet even when
  pausing, its point had trembled on the paper, as the blurred dots showed.
  Miranda imagined that so it had paused and trembled, while someone walked by
  the writer's back and had but to glance over his shoulder to discover the
  business he was engaged upon. Then again the pencil had raced on, running the
  words one into the other, fevered to get the message done. A whole tragedy
  was indicated in the formation of the letters. Or a malady? Miranda turned
  eagerly to the letter. The writing wavered up and down. The small letters
  were clear; the capitals and the long letters, the "f's," the "q's," the
  "y's," weak, as though the fingers could not control the pencil. Illness
  might account for the message, and Miranda chose that supposition.</p>

  <p>"He is lying very ill somewhere," she said.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier shook his head. "No. I tried to believe that myself at first;
  but I never did believe it, and I thought and thought and
  thought&mdash;<i>Tenez</i>, look!" He drew a piece of blank paper from one
  pocket, a pencil from another. The paper he spread upon his knee, the pencil
  he took between his teeth; then he held out his wrists.</p>

  <p>"Now fasten them together."</p>

  <p>Miranda uttered a cry. Her face grew very white. "What with?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Your belt."</p>

  <p>She unclasped her belt from her waist and strapped Fournier's wrists
  together.</p>

  <p>"Tighter," said he, "tighter. Now see!"</p>

  <p>With great difficulty and labour he copied out Warriner's message on the
  blank paper; and while he wrote Miranda saw the sentence wavering up and
  down, the small letters coming out clear and small, the long strokes and
  tails straggling. She seized the copy almost before he had finished, and held
  it side by side with the original. There was a difference, of course, the
  difference which stamped one man's hand as Warriner's and the other as
  Fournier's, the difference of fear, but that was the only difference. The
  method in each case was identical; the same difficulties had produced the
  same results.</p>

  <p>"There can be no doubt, <i>hein?</i>" asked Fournier, as Miranda
  unfastened the belt.</p>

  <p>"How did this come to you?" she returned.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," said he, "from the beginning. Bentham&mdash;that is what M.
  Warriner calls himself now, Bentham&mdash;Jeremy Bentham he calls himself,
  because he says he's such an economist&mdash;well, he and I are partners in a
  little business, and we have prospered. So when Bentham came back from Bemin
  Sooar to Tangier a week ago, I give a dinner in my house to a few friends and
  we dance afterwards. Perhaps ten or eleven of us and Bentham. Bentham he came
  and danced and he was the last to go away. He did not stay in my
  house&mdash;it was better for our little business that we should not be
  thought more than mere friends. He had a lodging in the town, while my house
  was outside up the hill. He rode away alone on a mule, for he was in evening
  dress and one cannot walk across the Sôk in dancing shoes, and he never
  reached his lodging. He disappeared. I heard no word of him, until yesterday;
  yesterday about mid-day, an Arab brought that scrap of paper to my shop."</p>

  <p>"But the Arab told you how and where he got it?" said Miranda.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He belonged to a douar, a tent village, you understand. The village
  is three days from Tangier on the road to Mequinez. The Arab was leading down
  his goats to the water a week ago, in the morning, when six men passed him at
  a distance. They were going up into the country; they had a mule with them.
  He watched them pass and noticed that one of them would now and then loiter
  and fall a little behind, whereupon the rest beat him with sticks and drove
  him again in front. And he did not resist, Madame, I am afraid we know why he
  did not resist."</p>

  <p>Miranda pressed her hands to her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said with an effort, and her voice had sunk to a whisper,
  "finish, finish!"</p>

  <p>"It seemed to the Arab," continued Fournier, whose anxiety seemed in some
  measure to diminish, and whose face grew hopeful as he watched Miranda's
  increasing distress, "that this victim made a sign to him, and when the party
  had gone by he noticed something white gleaming on the brown soil in the line
  of their march. He went forward and picked it up. It was this piece of paper.
  He read the writing on it, these marks." M. Fournier turned over the sheet,
  and pointed to the indecipherable Arabic. "They mean, 'Take this to Fournier
  at Tangier and you will get money.' He opened it, he could not read the
  inside, but seeing that it was written in one of the languages of the
  Nazarenes, he thought there might be some truth in the promise. So he brought
  the paper to Tangier yesterday and I have brought it to you."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier settled his glasses upon his nose and leaned forward for his
  answer. Miranda sat with knitted brows, gazing out to the dark mountains.
  Fournier would not interrupt her; he fancied she was searching her wits for a
  device to bring help to Warriner; but, indeed, she was not thinking at
  all.</p>

  <p>Miranda had a trick of seeing pictures. She was not given to arguments and
  inferences; but a word, a sentence, would strike upon her hearing, and at
  once a curtain was rolled up somewhere in her mind, and she saw men moving to
  and fro and things happening as upon a lighted stage. Such pictures made up
  her arguments, her conclusions, even her motives; and it was because of their
  instant vividness that she was so rapidly moved to sympathy and dislike. So
  now there was set before her eyes the picture of a man riding down the hill
  of Tangier at night in the civilisation of evening dress, and, as she looked,
  it melted into another in which the same man, clad in vile rags, with his
  hands bound, was flogged forwards under a burning sun into the barbaric
  inlands of Morocco. She saw that brutal party, the five gaolers, the one
  captive, straggle past the tent village. She guessed at Ralph's despairing
  glance as though it was directed towards herself, she saw the scrap of paper
  flutter white upon the dark soil. And as she contemplated this vision, she
  heard M. Fournier speaking again to her; but the sound of his voice had
  changed. He was no longer telling his story; he was pleading with a
  tenderness which had something grotesquely pathetic, when she considered who
  it was for whom he pleaded. His foreign accent became more pronounced, and
  the voluble words tumbled one over the other.</p>

  <p>"So M. Warriner does not ask you for money; that sees itself, is it not?
  Nor even does he ask you for help. Be sure of that, Madame; read the note
  again. He would not come to you for help; he is not so mean; he has too much
  pride;" and as Mrs. Warriner smiled, with perhaps a little bitterness, M.
  Fournier, noticing her smile, became yet more astonishing and intricate in
  his apologies. "He take your money, oh yes, I know very well, while he is
  with you; but then you get his company in exchange. That make you both quits,
  eh? But once he has gone away, he would not come back to you for money or
  help at all. He has so much pride. Oh no! He just take it from the first
  person he meet, me or anyone else. He has so much pride; besides, it would be
  simpler. No! It is I who come to you. He often speak to me of you&mdash;oh,
  but in the highest terms! And I say to myself: That dear Ralph, he is
  difficult to live with. He is not a comfortable friend. We know that, Mrs.
  Warriner and I, but we both love him very much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The emphatic interruption fairly startled M. Fournier. Miranda had risen
  from her seat and stood over him. He would not have believed that so gentle a
  face could have taken on so vigorous an expression. He stammered a protest.
  Miranda repeated her denial: "No, no, no!" she cried. "Let us be frank!"</p>

  <p>She turned aside from him, and leaning her elbows upon the crumbling
  parapet of the wall, looked across the valley and down the cliff's side where
  one road was cut in steep zigzags, and winding down to the plain as to the
  water's edge, helped to complete the illusion that the sea should fitly be
  breaking at the base.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's hopes dwindled in the face of this uncompromising denial. He
  had come to enlist her help; he had counted upon her affections, and had
  boldly counted, because Warriner had so surely attracted his own. M. Fournier
  would have been at a loss to explain his friendship for Warriner, to account
  for the causes or the qualities which evoked it, but he felt its strength,
  and he now knew that Mrs. Warriner had no lot or share in it.</p>

  <p>He was therefore the more surprised when she turned back to him with eyes
  which were shining and moist, and said very gently: "But of course I will
  help." Her conduct was not at all inconsistent, however much it might appear
  so to M. Fournier. She was acting upon the same motive which had induced her,
  the moment she was aware of Ralph Warriner's existence, to return to Ronda,
  the one spot where Warriner would be sure to look for her if he needed her,
  and which had subsequently persuaded her to submit to the blackmail of Major
  Wilbraham. "Of course I will help. What can I do?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's eyes narrowed, his manner became wary and cunning. "I hoped
  that you might perhaps hit upon some plan," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I?" Miranda thought for a moment, then she said: "We must appeal to the
  English Minister at Tangier."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier sprang out of his chair. "No, that is the very last thing we
  must do. For what should we say? That Mr. Ralph Warriner, who was thought to
  be dead, has just been kidnapped in Morocco?"</p>

  <p>"No, but that Mr. Bentham has," she returned quickly.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier shrugged his shoulders. "Why am I here?" he exclaimed,
  stamping his foot. "I ask you, why am I here? <i>Saperlipopette!</i> Would I
  have come to you if any so simple remedy had been possible? Suppose we go
  politely to the English Minister and ask him to find Mr. Jeremy Bentham! The
  Minister goes to the Sultan of Morocco, and after many months, perhaps Mr.
  Bentham is found, perhaps he is not. Suppose that he is found and brought
  down to Tangier,&mdash;what next, I beg you? There will be talk about Mr.
  Bentham, there will be gentlemen everywhere, behind bushes, under tables,
  everywhere, so that the great British public may know the colours of the ties
  he wears, and at last be happy. His name will be in the papers, and more,
  Mrs. Warriner, his portrait too. His portrait; have you thought of that?"</p>

  <p>"But he might escape the photographers."</p>

  <p>"Suppose he do, by a miracle. Do you think there will be no inquiry as to
  what is Mr. Bentham's business in Morocco? Do you think the English Minister
  will not ask the inconvenient question? Do you think that you can hide his
  business, once an inquiry is set on foot, in that country? He might pass as a
  tourist, you think perhaps, <i>hein?</i> And any one man has only got to give
  a few dollars to some officer in the custom-house, and he will know that Mr.
  Bentham is smuggling guns into Morocco, and selling them to the Berbers of
  Bemin Sooar. What then? He would be taken for trial to Gibraltar, where only
  two years ago he was Captain Warriner."</p>

  <p>Miranda had already heard enough from Wilbraham to confirm M. Fournier's
  statement about the custom-house.</p>

  <p>"No," continued Fournier, "the risk is too great. And I call it risk!" He
  hunched his shoulders and spread out his hand. "It is a red-hot cert, as he
  would say. His identity would be established, and he had better, after all,
  be a captive in Morocco than a convict in England. There is some chance of an
  escape in Morocco."</p>

  <p>"There is also in Morocco some chance of a&mdash;" Miranda's lips refused
  to speak the word. M. Fournier supplied it.</p>

  <p>"Murder? I do not fear that. Had they intended murder, they would have
  killed that night, then and there, in the Sôk of Tangier. There would have
  been no letter dropped three days inland."</p>

  <p>Miranda eagerly welcomed the argument. "Yes, yes," she exclaimed, and the
  colour came back to her lips. "He is held for ransom then, surely?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier shook his head. "Hardly. Had they captured him for ransom,
  they would have got from him the names of his friends. They would have used
  measures," said he, with some emphasis upon the word, at which Miranda
  shivered; "sure measures to get the names, and Warriner would have given
  mine. They would have come to me for the ransom, and I should have given
  it&mdash;if it was everything I had&mdash;and Warriner would be safe by
  now."</p>

  <p>Fournier was aware that Miranda looked curiously and even with a sort of
  compunction towards him, though he did not understand the reason of her look.
  To him it was the most natural, simple thing in the world that he should care
  for Warriner.</p>

  <p>"No, it is not ransom," and he threw a cautious glance this way and that,
  and then, even in that secret spot, continued in a whisper: "Warriner has
  enemies, enemies of his own race. I do not wonder at it," he explained
  impartially. "He treats me, yes, even me, who am his one friend, as
  though&mdash;well, his own phrase is the best. He wipes the floor with me. He
  has promised to do it many times, and many times he has done it too. No doubt
  he has enemies, and they have arranged his capture."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose they sell him for a slave, a long way off and a long way inland.
  It would not be pleasant at all, and most of all unpleasant to him, for he is
  particular. Of course you know that, Mrs. Warriner. He likes his linen very
  clean and fine. He would not enjoy being a slave, yet he could not appeal to
  his Government, even if he got the chance."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't, please!" cried Miranda. That intimate detail about Ralph's
  habits brought home to her most convincingly his present plight. "But what
  enemies?" she asked in a moment or two. "Is it a guess of yours, or do you
  know of any?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier hitched his chair nearer. His voice became yet more
  confidential.</p>

  <p>"Three months ago an Englishman came to my shop."</p>

  <p>"Three months ago?" interrupted Miranda. "He leaned over your counter and
  he said, 'How did you work that little affair on Rosevear, and how's my dear
  friend, Ralph Warriner?'"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you know him!" cried Fournier, springing up in excitement.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and he has nothing to do with Ralph's capture," replied Miranda. "He
  only went that one time to Tangier." M. Fournier resumed his seat, and she
  briefly explained to the Belgian the reason and the consequence of
  Wilbraham's visit. Fournier's face fell as he listened. He had hoped that the
  necessary clue had been discovered, and when Miranda finished he sat silent
  in a glum despair. After a little his face lightened.</p>

  <p>"Only once you say he came to Tangier, this man you speak of&mdash;only
  once?" he asked eagerly, stretching out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Only the once."</p>

  <p>"He was not there earlier in the year? He was not there in May? Think
  carefully. Be very sure!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner reflected for a second. "I am sure he was not," she replied.
  "He travelled by train from Monte Carlo to Marseilles in May. From Marseilles
  he came directly by boat to England."</p>

  <p>"Good," said M. Fournier. He sat forward in his chair and rubbed the palms
  of his hands together. "Now listen! There was another Englishman who came in
  May. He came to my shop, though the shutter was on the window and the shop
  closed."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" asked Mrs. Warriner.</p>

  <p>"I cannot guess."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what he was like."</p>

  <p>"Ah! there's the trouble. Neither of us saw him. Warriner heard his voice,
  that is all. And a voice? There is no clue more deceptive. The one thing
  Warriner is sure of is that he had never heard the voice before."</p>

  <p>"But what was it that he heard?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you. Warriner came down to Tangier that very morning from the
  country. He travelled as always in the dress of a Moor, for he speaks their
  tongues, no Moor better, and our little business, you understand, needs
  secrecy. I closed my shop, shuttered the window, locked the door. Warriner
  told me he had arranged with the sheikhs of the Berber tribes to deliver so
  many Winchesters, so much ammunition, within a certain period. The period was
  short; Warriner's boat, the <i>Ten Brothers</i>, was waiting at Tarifa. I
  leave him to change his dress and shave his beard, while I go down to the
  harbour and hire a felucca to put him over to Tarifa. But Warriner forgot to
  lock the door behind me. In a minute or two he hear a hand scrape softly, oh
  so softly, up the door towards the latch. For a second he stood, with the
  razor in his hand like this," and the Belgian, in the absorption of his
  narrative began to act the scene, "looking at the latch, waiting for it to
  rise, and listening. Then he remembered that he had not locked the door. He
  crept on tip-toe towards it; just as he reached it he heard a loud English
  voice shout to him violently, 'Look out!' That phrase is a menace, eh?" he
  stopped to ask.</p>

  <p>"It might be. It would more naturally be a warning," said Mrs.
  Warriner.</p>

  <p>"In either case it means an enemy. As he shouted Warriner's hand was
  already on the key. Warriner turn the lock, and immediately the Englishman
  batter and knock at the door, but he could not get in, and after a little he
  went away. Ah! how often we have wondered who that man was, and why he
  shouted out his threat and tried to force the door. To know that you have one
  enemy at your heels, but you cannot pick him out because you have not seen
  his face! That frightens me, Madame Warriner. I am a coward, and it is no
  wonder that it frightens me." The perspiration broke out on Fournier's
  forehead as he made his frank confession. "But it frightens Warriner too, who
  is no coward. Often and often have I seen him lift up a finger, so," he
  suited the action to the word, "when a new voice speak within his hearing,
  and listen, listen, listen, to make sure whether that was the voice which
  shouted through the door or no. But a voice! You cannot be certain you
  recognise it, unless you can recognise also the face of the man to whom it
  belongs. A singer's voice, yes! Perhaps you might know that again though you
  heard it for the first time blindfold. But a voice that merely speaks or
  shouts, no!"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier picked up his hat and rose from his chair. Miranda rose too,
  and they stood face to face with one another under the awning.</p>

  <p>"So I ask you this. Will you help to recover your husband?" he asked, with
  a simplicity of appeal which went home to Miranda all the more, because it
  did not presume to claim her help. "Either a search must be made privately
  through Morocco until he is found and bought, and such a search seems
  hopeless; or the unknown man who shouted through the door must be discovered.
  That is the simplest way. For this I do believe"&mdash;and he expressed his
  belief with a great solemnity and conviction which sank very memorably into
  Miranda's mind&mdash;"I believe that if we lay our hands upon that man we
  shall lay our hands also upon the means to rescue Warriner from his
  servitude."</p>

  <p>"But how can I help? I do not know the man who shouted through the door."
  The words were flung at Fournier in a passion of impotence. "You say you need
  no money. I cannot scour Morocco. How can a woman help?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier hesitated. He took off his glasses. He found it easier to
  speak the matter of his thoughts when he saw her face dimly, and could not
  take note of its expressions.</p>

  <p>"A woman very often has friends," he hinted.</p>

  <p>He saw her face grow rosy and then pale.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I have lost the glove," she cried impulsively, and as she turned
  towards the perplexed M. Fournier, the blood rushed back into her cheeks. "I
  mean," she stammered, and broke off suddenly into a question which was at
  once an accusation and a challenge.</p>

  <p>"And men, have they no friends?"</p>

  <p>Fournier did not affect to misunderstand her.</p>

  <p>"Here and there, perhaps a man has one friend who will deliberately risk
  much, even life, for him, but in those cases he has only one such friend.
  Warriner has one, but alas! that one friend is myself. Already, it is true, I
  have risked my life for him at the Scillies, and I would gladly lose it for
  him now, if I could only lose it without foreknowledge. But what can I do? A
  little fat Belgian bourgeois, of middle age, who speaks no language correctly
  but his own, and has only a few poor words of Arabic, a man of no strength,
  and, Madame, a coward,&mdash;what could I do inland in Morocco?" He made no
  parade of humility as he described himself; he used the simple,
  straightforward tone of one who advances cogent arguments. Miranda was moved
  by an impulse to hold out her hand to him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," she said.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier was encouraged to continue his plea.</p>

  <p>"But to possess sufficient friends so that one may choose the adequate
  instrument,&mdash;ah, that is the privilege of women!" He added timidly, "Of
  women who have youth and beauty," but in a voice so low that the words hardly
  reached Miranda's ears, and their significance was not understood by her at
  all.</p>

  <p>"I have not many friends," she returned frankly, "but I have one who would
  be adequate. I cannot tell whether I can bring myself to&mdash;I mean I
  cannot tell whether he could go; he has duties. It is asking much to ask any
  man to set out into Morocco on such an errand. However, I must think of it; I
  could at all events send for him and tell him of my husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier interposed quickly: "He knows nothing of Ralph Warriner?"</p>

  <p>"He believes my husband dead."</p>

  <p>"Then why should he not continue to believe your husband dead?" asked
  Fournier, with a sly cunning. "It is Mr. Jeremy Bentham he goes out to
  find,&mdash;a friend of yours&mdash;a relation perhaps&mdash;is it not so? We
  can keep Ralph Warriner dead for a while longer."</p>

  <p>The little man's intention was becoming obvious.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Miranda, sharply.</p>

  <p>"It would be more prudent."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>Her voice was cold and dangerous.</p>

  <p>"A man has one friend, a woman many," explained M. Fournier; "but there
  are compensations for the man in that his friend will serve him for
  friendship's sake. But a man will not serve a woman for friendship's sake.
  Not if he serve her well."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier was prepared for an outburst of indignation; he was not
  prepared for the expression which came over Miranda's face, and he could not
  understand it. She looked at him fixedly and, as it seemed, in consternation.
  "That is not true," she said; "it is not true. Surely, surely it cannot be
  true."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier made no answer. She turned away from him and walked along the
  flagged pathway, turned at the end and came slowly back. "A man will only
  serve a woman if he cares for her?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier bowed.</p>

  <p>"And men can be made to care?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier smiled.</p>

  <p>"But it needs time?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.</p>

  <p>"And it needs tricks?"</p>

  <p>M. Fournier made a pun.</p>

  <p>"Nature, Madame, has put the tricks in your hand."</p>

  <p>Miranda nodded her head once or twice, and made a remark which M. Fournier
  was at a loss to apply. "The old question," said she, "and the old answer;"
  and at once an irrational anger flamed up within her, anger with M. Fournier
  for posing the question again, anger with herself for her perplexity, anger
  even against Charnock, because he did not magically appear in the garden and
  answer the question and dissolve her perplexity. But M. Fournier alone was in
  the garden with her, and the full force of her anger broke upon him. "I am to
  throw out my net," she cried, "and catch my friend! I am to trick him, to lie
  to him, and to earn with the lie the use of his life and his brains and his
  time and his manhood. How dare you come to me with such a thought? A coward's
  thought indeed!"</p>

  <p>"The thought of a man who loves his friend," said M. Fournier, stubbornly;
  and he continued without any sarcasm: "Your sentiments, Madame Warriner, are
  most correct; they do you honour, but I love my friend."</p>

  <p>To his surprise Miranda suddenly smiled at him, and then laughed. "I was
  never treated with such absolute disregard in all my life," she said. "No,
  don't apologise, I like you for it."</p>

  <p>"Then you will do as I propose?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Miranda grew serious. "I cannot. If I ask my friend to go upon this
  errand, he must know before he goes who it is I ask him to bring back. I must
  think what can be done. You will go back to Tangier; perhaps you may find
  Ralph there when you return. I will write to you at Tangier."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier had plainly no opinion of her plan; but he saw that he could
  not dissuade her. He took the hand which she held out to him, and returned
  sorrowfully through the patio to the street.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <h3>IN WHICH MIRANDA ADOPTS A NEW LINE OF CONDUCT<br>
  AND THE MAJOR EXPRESSES SOME DISCONTENT</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MIRANDA was left with two convictions, of which she was very
  certain. Somehow, somewhither, help must be sent to Ralph; and if Charnock
  carried the help, he must know why and for whom before he went.</p>

  <p>She stood in the patio until the outer door closed behind M. Fournier. A
  local newspaper lying upon a wicker chair caught her eye, and harassed and
  unresolved as she was, she turned eagerly for rest to its commonplaces. She
  read an anecdote about an unknown politician, and a summary of Don Carlos's
  prospects, with extreme care and concentration; for she knew that her
  perplexities lay in wait for her behind the screen of the news sheet, and she
  was very tired.</p>

  <p>She turned over the sheet, and in spite of herself, began to feel at a
  third idea. She applied herself consequently to the first paragraph which met
  her eye, and read it over with great speed, perhaps ten times. But the words
  she read were not the printed words. They were these:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Send me the glove, and when I come up to Ronda, it will be understood
  without a word why I have come. There will be no need for me to speak at all,
  and you will only have to tell me the particular thing that wants doing."</p>

  <p>And the idea became distinct. She could choose her own time for telling
  Charnock the particular thing which wanted doing. He would ask no questions;
  he had indeed hit upon that device of the glove to spare her; she could send
  the glove, and she could tell him after he had come in answer, but at her own
  discretion, why she had sent it. Therefore she had time&mdash;she had
  time.</p>

  <p>She turned to her paragraph again, read it with comprehension, and from
  the paragraph her trouble sprang at her and caught her by the heart. For what
  she read was the account of the opening of the branch line to Algeciras.
  Charnock's work was done, then; he would be leaving Algeciras. Even at that
  moment her first feeling was one of approaching loneliness, so closely had
  the man crept into her thoughts. She took a step towards her parlour,
  stopped, stood for a moment irresolute, ran up the winding iron staircase to
  the landing half-way up the patio, and fetched a new long white kid glove
  from her dressing-room. She moulded it upon her hand, soiled it by a ten
  minutes' wearing, ripped it across the palm, and sealed it up in an
  envelope.</p>

  <p>Jane Holt came into the patio while Miranda was still writing the
  address.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A sham, Jane, a sham," said Miranda, in a queer, unsteady voice; "a
  trick, the first of them."</p>

  <p>Jane Holt shook her head. "You are very strange, Miranda," but Miranda
  picked up the envelope, and putting on her hat hurried to the post-office. As
  she crossed the bridge over the Tajo a man barred her way. She tried to pass
  him; he moved again in front of her, and she saw that the man was
  Wilbraham.</p>

  <p>"I wish to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"In ten minutes," said she, "in the Alameda. I have a letter to post."</p>

  <p>"The letter can wait," said he.</p>

  <p>"If it did, it would never be posted," said she, and she hurried past
  him.</p>

  <p>The Major followed her with inquisitive eyes; he felt a certain admiration
  for her buoyant walk, her tall slight figure, which a white muslin dress with
  a touch of colour at the waist so well set off, and for the pose of her head
  under the wide straw hat. But business instincts prevailed over his
  admiration. He lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What is the large sealed letter which must be posted at once, or it will
  never be posted at all?" he asked himself. "Why must it be posted at
  once?"</p>

  <p>He strolled to the Alameda unable to find an answer. In the Alameda, at
  the bench before the railings, Miranda was waiting for him. She rose at once
  to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come?" she asked. "It is not quarter-day. We made our
  bargain. I have kept my part of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he. "But it was not a good bargain for me. I underrated my
  necessities. I overrated my taste for a quiet life."</p>

  <p>"And the Horace?" she asked scornfully. "One of the few things worth
  doing, was it not?"</p>

  <p>Wilbraham flushed angrily.</p>

  <p>"So it is," he said. "But I find it difficult to settle down. I need, in
  fact,&mdash;do we not all need them?&mdash;intervals of relaxation." He spoke
  uneasily; he looked even more worn and tired than when he first came to
  Ronda. Miranda understood that here indeed was the real tragedy of the man's
  life.</p>

  <p>"All these years, fifteen years," she said, "you have dreamed of doing
  sooner or later this one thing. You have played with the dream. You have kept
  your self-respect by means of it. It has set you apart from your companions.
  And now, when the opportunity comes, you find that you were only after all on
  the level of your companions, lower, perhaps a trifle lower, by this trifle
  of delusion. For you cannot do the work."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham did not resent the speech, which was uttered without reproach or
  accusation, but in the tone of one who notes a fact which should have been
  foreseen.</p>

  <p>"A topping fellow Horace, of course," Wilbraham began.</p>

  <p>"And I trusted you to do it," she said suddenly, and looked at him for a
  moment full in the face, not angrily, but with a queer sort of interest in
  the mistake she had made. Then she turned from him and walked away.</p>

  <p>The Major followed quickly, but before he could come up with her she
  turned round on him.</p>

  <p>"Follow me for one other step," she said, "and I call that guardia twenty
  yards away."</p>

  <p>She meant to do it, too; this was unmistakable. She resumed her walk, and
  the Major thought it prudent to remain where he was. He remained in fact for
  some time on that spot, whistling softly to himself. Wilbraham's menaces had
  sunk to a complete insignificance in Miranda's mind, since she had been
  confronted with the actual positive disaster which had befallen Ralph
  Warriner. Wilbraham, however, was not in a position to trace Miranda's sudden
  audacity to its true source. He fell therefore, and not unnaturally, into the
  error of imagining that she drew her courage to refuse his demands from some
  new and external support. His thoughts went back to the letter which must be
  posted at once. Had that letter anything to do with that support? Had it
  anything to do with her refusal?</p>

  <p>Wilbraham asked himself these questions with considerable uneasiness, for
  after all the seven hundred per annum was not so absolutely assured. He came
  to the conclusion that it would be wise to transfer his quarters from Tarifa
  to Ronda.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <h3>THE HERO, LIKE ALL HEROES, FINDS HIMSELF IN A FOG</h3><br>

  <p class="first">AT eight o'clock the next morning Charnock was crushing the
  remainder of his clothes into a portmanteau. A couple of corded trunks stood
  ready for the porters, while the manager of the line sat in the window
  overlooking Algeciras Bay, and gave him gratuitous advice as to totally
  different and very superior methods of packing.</p>

  <p>The manager suddenly rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Here's the P. and O. coming into the bay," he said. "Man, but you have
  very little time. I'm thinking you'll miss it."</p>

  <p>Charnock raised a flushed face from his portmanteau, and so wasted a few
  seconds. He made no effort to catch them up.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking, too, you would not be very sorry to miss it," continued the
  manager, sagely. "Though what charms you can discover in Algeciras, it's
  beyond my powers to comprehend."</p>

  <p>Charnock did not controvert or explain the manager's supposition. He
  continued to pack, but perhaps a trifle more slowly than before.</p>

  <p>"You have got my address, Macdonald?" he said. "You won't lose it, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>He shut up the portmanteau and knelt upon it.</p>

  <p>"You will forward everything that comes&mdash;everything without fail?" he
  insisted.</p>

  <p>"In all human probability," returned Macdonald, "I will forward nothing at
  all. For I am thinking you will lose the boat."</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the door; Charnock's servant brought in a letter. The
  letter lay upon its face, and the sealed back of the envelope had an official
  look.</p>

  <p>"Open it, will you, Macdonald?" said Charnock, as he fastened the straps.
  "Well, what's it about?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell. It's written in a dialect I do not understand," said the
  manager, gravely, and Charnock, turning about, saw that he dangled and
  deliberated upon a long white kid glove.</p>

  <p>Charnock jumped up and snatched it away.</p>

  <p>"It's a female's," said the manager, sagely.</p>

  <p>"It's a woman's," returned Charnock, with indignation.</p>

  <p>"You are very young," observed Macdonald. "And I'll point out to you that
  you have torn your letter."</p>

  <p>Charnock was turning the glove over, and showed the palm at that moment.
  He smiled, but made no answer. He folded the glove, wrapped it in its
  envelope, took it out again, and smoothed its creases. Then he folded it once
  more, held it for a little balanced on his hand, and finally replaced it in
  the envelope and hid the envelope in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Man, but you are <i>very</i> young," remarked Macdonald, "and I'm
  thinking that you'll lose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a train to Ronda pretty soon?" interrupted Charnock.</p>

  <p>"There is," replied Macdonald, drily, "and I'll be particular to mind your
  address, and forward everything that comes. Eh, but you have paid your
  passage on the P. and O."</p>

  <p>Charnock, in spite of that argument, took his seat in the train for Ronda,
  and travelled up through the forest of cork trees whose foliage split the
  sunshine, making here a shade, there an alley of light. The foresters were at
  work stripping the trunks of their bark, and Charnock was in a mood to make
  parables of the world, so long as they fitted in with and exemplified his own
  particular purposes and plans. He himself was a forester, and the rough bark
  he was stripping was Miranda's distress, so it is to be supposed that the
  bare tree-trunk was Miranda herself; and, to be sure, what simile could be
  more elegant?</p>

  <p>Charnock's dominant feeling, indeed, was one of elation. The message of
  his mirror was being fulfilled. He had the glove in his pocket to assure him
  of that, and the feel of the glove, of its delicate kid between his strong
  fingers, pleased him beyond measure. For it seemed appropriate and expressive
  of her, and he hoped that the strength of his fingers was expressive of
  himself. But beyond that, it was a call, a challenge to his chivalry, which
  up till now, through all his years, had never once been called upon and
  challenged; and therein lay the true cause of his elation.</p>

  <p>The train swept out of the cork forest, and the great grass slopes
  stretched upwards at the side of the track, dotted with white villages,
  seamed with rocks. Charnock fell to marvelling at the apt moment of the
  summons. Just when his work was done, when his mind and his body were free,
  the glove had come to him. If it had come by a later post on that same day,
  he would have been on his way to England. But it had not; it had come
  confederate with the hour of its coming.</p>

  <p>The train passed into the gorge of tunnels, climbing towards Ronda. He was
  not forgetful that he was summoned to help Miranda out of a danger perhaps,
  certainly out of a great misfortune. But he had never had a doubt that the
  misfortune from some quarter, and at some time, would fall. She had allowed
  him on the balcony in St. James's Park to understand that she herself
  expected it. He knew, too, that it must be some quite unusual misfortune. For
  had she not herself said, with a complete comprehension of what she said, "If
  I have troubles I must fight them through myself"? He had been prepared then
  for the troubles, and he was rejoiced that after all they were of a kind
  wherein his service could be of use.</p>

  <p>At the head of the gorge he caught his first view of Ronda, balanced aloft
  upon its dark pinnacle of rock. It was mid-day, and the sun tinged with gold
  the white Spanish houses and the old brown mansions of the Moors; and over
  all was a blue arch of sky, brilliant and cloudless. At that distance and in
  that clear light, Ronda seemed one piece of ivory, exquisitely carved and
  tinted, and then exquisitely mounted on a black pedestal. Charnock was not
  troubled with any of Lady Donnisthorpe's perplexities as to why Miranda
  persisted in making that town her home. To him it seemed the only place where
  she could live, since it alone could fitly enshrine her.</p>

  <p>The train wound up the incline at the back of the town and steamed into
  the station. Charnock drove thence to the hotel in the square near the
  bull-ring, lunched, and asked his way to Mrs. Warriner's house. He stood for
  a while looking at the blank yellow wall which gave on to the street, and the
  heavy door of walnut wood.</p>

  <p>For the first time he began to ponder what was the nature of the peril in
  which Miranda stood. His speculations were of no particular value, but the
  fact that he speculated at this spot, opposite the house, opposite the door,
  was. For, quite unconsciously, his eyes took an impression of the geometrical
  arrangement of the copper nails with which it was encrusted, or rather sought
  to take such an impression. For the geometrical figures were so intricate in
  their involutions that the eyes were continually baffled and continually
  provoked. Charnock was thus absently searching for the key to their
  inter-twistings when he walked across the road and knocked. He was conducted
  through the patio. He was shown into the small dark-panelled parlour which
  overlooked the valley. The door was closed upon him; the room was empty. A
  book lay open upon the table before the window. Charnock stood in front of
  this table looking out of the window across to the sierras; so that the book
  was just beneath his nose. He had but to drop his eyes and he would have read
  the title, and known the subject-matter, of the book, and perhaps taken note
  or some pencil lines scored in the margin against a passage here and there,
  for the book had been much in Miranda's hands these last few days. But he did
  not, for he heard a light step cross the patio outside and pause on the
  threshold of the door.</p>

  <p>Charnock turned expectantly away from the table. The door, however, did
  not open, nor on the other hand were the footsteps heard to retreat. A woman
  then was standing, quite silent and quite motionless, on the other side of
  that shut door; and that woman, no doubt, was Miranda. Charnock was puzzled;
  he, too, stood silent and motionless, looking towards the door and wondering
  why she paused there and in what attitude she stood. For the seconds passed,
  and there must have been a lapse of quite two minutes between the moment when
  the footsteps ceased and the moment when the door was flung open.</p>

  <p>For the door was flung open, noisily, violently, and with a great bustle
  of petticoats an unknown woman danced into the room humming a tune. She
  stopped with all the signs of amazement when she saw Charnock. "Oh!" she
  exclaimed, "why didn't they tell me?" She cast backwards over her shoulder
  that glance of the startled fawn which befits a solitary maid in the presence
  of a devouring man. Then she advanced timidly, lowered her eyes, and said:
  "So you have come to Ronda, then?"</p>

  <p>This unknown woman had paused outside the door, yet she had swung into the
  room as though in a great hurry, and had been much surprised to see her
  visitor. Charnock was perplexed. Moreover, the unknown woman wore the
  semblance of Miranda. She was dressed in a white frock very elaborate with
  lace, he noticed; there was a shimmer of satin at her throat and waist, and
  to him who had not seen her for these months past, and who had thought of her
  as of one draped in black,&mdash;since thus only he had seen her,&mdash;she
  gleamed against the dark panels of the room, silvered and wonderful.</p>

  <p>"So you have come to Ronda?" said she.</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand with a gingerly manner of timidity, and pressed his
  fingers when they touched hers, as though she could not help herself, and
  then hastily drew her hand away, as if she was ashamed and alarmed at her
  forwardness. Charnock could not but remember a frank, honest hand-clasp, with
  which she had bidden him goodbye in London.</p>

  <p>"Is this your first visit to Ronda?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Sure?" She looked at him with her eyebrows raised and an arch glance of
  provocation. "Sure you have not come up once or twice just to see in what
  corner of the world I lived?"</p>

  <p>"No; I have been busy."</p>

  <p>Miranda shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I had no right to expect you would." She pushed out a foot in a polished
  shoe beyond the hem of her dress, contemplated it with great interest, and
  suddenly withdrew it with much circumstance of modesty. Then with an
  involuntary gesture of repugnance which Charnock did not understand, she went
  over to the window and stood looking out from it. From that position too she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"You promised that night, if you have not forgotten, at Lady
  Donnisthorpe's, on the balcony, to tell me about yourself, about those years
  you spent in Westminster." And Charnock broke in upon her speech in a voice
  of relief.</p>

  <p>"I understand," said he.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"You," he replied simply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hope not," she returned; "for when a woman becomes intelligible to
  a man, he loses all&mdash;liking for her," and she spoke the word "liking"
  with extreme shyness as though there were a bolder word with which he might
  replace it if he chose. "Is not that the creed?"</p>

  <p>"A false creed," said he, and her eyes fell upon the open book. She
  uttered a startled exclamation, threw a quick glance at Charnock, closed the
  book and covered it with a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Let us go into the garden," said she; "and you shall talk to me of those
  years in which I am most interested."</p>

  <p>"That I can understand," said he, and she glanced at him sharply,
  suspiciously, but there was no sarcasm in his accent. He had hit upon an
  explanation of the change in her. She stood in peril, she needed help, and
  very likely help of a kind which implied resource, which involved danger. She
  knew nothing of him, nothing of his capacity. It was no more than natural
  that he should require to know and that she should sound his years for the
  knowledge, before she laid him under the obligation of doing her a
  service.</p>

  <p>He sat down on the chair in which M. Fournier had sat only yesterday.</p>

  <p>"It will sound very unfamiliar to you," he said with a laugh. "My father
  was vicar of a moorland parish on the hills above Brighouse in Yorkshire.
  There I lived until I was twelve, until my father died. He had nothing but
  the living, which was poor&mdash;the village schoolmaster, what with
  capitation grants, was a good deal better off&mdash;so that when he died, he
  died penniless. I was adopted by a maiden aunt who took me to her home, a
  little villa in the south suburbs of London of which the shutters had never
  been taken down from the front windows since she had come to live there three
  years before."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Miranda, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"She was eccentric," explained Charnock, with a smile, and he resumed.
  "Nor had the front door ever been opened. My aunt was afraid that visitors
  might call, and, as she truly said, the house was not yet in order. The
  furniture, partly unpacked, with wisps of straw about the legs of the chairs,
  was piled up in the uncarpeted rooms. For there was only a carpet down in one
  room, the room in which we lived, and since the room was in the front and the
  shutters were up, we lived in a perpetual twilight."</p>

  <p>"But did the servants do nothing?" exclaimed Miranda.</p>

  <p>"There were no servants," returned Charnock. "My aunt said that they
  hampered her independence. Consequently of course we made our meals of tinned
  meat and bottled stout, which we ate standing up by the kitchen table in the
  garden if it was fine. But wet or fine the kitchen table always stood in the
  garden."</p>

  <p>Here Miranda began to laugh and Charnock joined with her.</p>

  <p>"It was a quaint sort of life," said he, "but rather ghostly to a boy of
  twelve."</p>

  <p>"But you went to school?"</p>

  <p>"No, my schooldays were over. I just lived in the twilight of that house,
  and through the chinks of the shutters watched people passing in the street,
  and lay awake at night listening to the creak of the bare boards. The house
  was in a terrace, and since we went to bed as soon as it grew dark to save
  the gas, I could hear through the wall the sounds of people laughing and
  talking, sometimes too the voices of boys of my own age playing while I lay
  in bed. I used to like the noise at times; it was companionable and told me
  fairy stories of blazing firesides. At times, however, I hated it beyond
  words, and hated the boys who laughed and shouted while I lay in the dark
  amongst the ghostly piles of furniture."</p>

  <p>Miranda was now quite serious, and Charnock, as he watched her, recognised
  in the woman who was listening, the woman he had talked with on the balcony
  over St. James's Park, and not the woman he had talked with five minutes
  since.</p>

  <p>"Only to think of it," she exclaimed. "I was living then amongst the
  Suffolk meadows, and the great whispering elms of the Park, and I never
  knew." She spoke almost in a tone of self-reproach as she clasped her hands
  together on her knees. "I never knew!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but we had our dissipations," returned Charnock. "We dug potatoes in
  the garden, and sometimes we paid a visit to Marshall and Snelgrove."</p>

  <p>"Marshall and Snelgrove!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, those were gala days. My aunt would buy the best ready-made bodice
  in the shop, which she carried away with her. From Marshall and Snelgrove's
  we used to go to Verrey's restaurant, where we dined amongst mirrors and much
  gilding, and about nine o'clock we would travel back to our suburb, creep
  into the dark house by the back door, and go to bed without a light. Imagine
  that if you can, Mrs. Warriner. The clatter, the noise, the flowers, the
  lights, of the restaurant, men and women in evening dress, and just about the
  time when they were driving up to their theatres, these people, in whose
  company we had dined, we were creeping into the dark, close-shuttered villa
  of the bare boards, and groping our way through the passage without a light.
  I used to imagine that every room had a man hiding behind the door, and all
  night long I heard men in my room breathing stealthily. It was after one such
  night that I ran away."</p>

  <p>"You ran away?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and hid myself in London. I picked up a living one way and another.
  It doesn't cost much to live when you are put to it. I sold newspapers. I ran
  errands&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You didn't carry a sandwich-board?" exclaimed Miranda, eagerly. "Say you
  didn't do that!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't," replied Charnock, with some surprise at her eagerness. "They
  wouldn't have given a nipper like me a sandwich-board," and Miranda drew an
  unaccountable breath of relief. "Finally I became an office boy, and I was
  allowed by my employer to sleep in an empty house in one of the small streets
  at the back of Westminster Abbey. There weren't any carpets either in that
  house, but I was independent, you see, and I saved my lodging. I wasn't
  unhappy during those three years. I understood that very well, when I heard
  the big clock strike twelve again on Lady Donnisthorpe's balcony. It was the
  first time I had heard it since I lived in the empty house, and heard it
  every night, and the sound of it was very pleasant and friendly."</p>

  <p>"Then you left London," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>"After three years. I was a clerk then; I was seventeen, and I had
  ambitions which clerking didn't satisfy. I always had a hankering after
  machinery, and I used to teach myself drawing. The lessons, however, did not
  turn out very successful, when I put them to the test."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" asked Miranda.</p>

  <p>"I went up North to Leeds. There's a firm of railway contractors and
  manufacturers of locomotives. Sir John Martin is the head partner, and I had
  seen him once or twice at my father's house, for he took and takes a great
  interest in the Yorkshire clergy."</p>

  <p>"I see. You went to him and told him who you were," said Miranda, who
  inclined towards Charnock more and more from the interest which she took in a
  youth so entirely strange, and apart from her own up-bringing, just as he on
  his part had been from the first attracted to her by the secure traditional
  life of which she was the flower, of which he traced associations in her
  simplicity, and up to this day, at all events, her lack of affectations.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Charnock, "it would have been wiser if I had done that; but
  I didn't. I changed my name, and applied for a vacancy as draughtsman. I
  obtained it, and held the post for three weeks. Why they suffered me for
  three weeks is still a mystery, for of course I couldn't draw at all. At the
  end of three weeks I was discharged. I asked to be taken on as anything at
  thirteen shillings a week. I saw Sir John Martin himself. He said I couldn't
  live on thirteen shillings; I said I could, and he asked me how." Charnock
  began to laugh at his own story. "I told him how," he said. "I lived
  practically for nothing."</p>

  <p>"How?" said Miranda. "Quick, tell me!" Charnock laughed again. "I had been
  three weeks at the works, you see, where hands were continually changing. I
  lived in a sort of mechanics' boarding-house, and I lived practically for
  nothing, on condition that I kept the house full, which I was able to do, for
  I got on very well with the men at the works. Sir John laughed when I told
  him, and took me into the office. So there I was a clerk again, which I
  didn't want to be; however, I was not a clerk for long. One Sunday Sir John
  Martin came down to the boarding-house and asked for me. It was dinner time,
  and he was shown straight into the dining-room, where I was sitting, if you
  please, at the head of the table, in my shirtsleeves, carving for all I was
  worth. He leaned against the door and shook with laughter. 'You are certain
  to get on,' he said; 'but I would like a few minutes with you alone.' I put
  on my coat, and went out with him into the street. 'Is your name Charnock?'
  he asked, and I answered that it was. 'I thought I knew your face,' said he,
  'and that's why I took you into my office, though I couldn't put a name to
  you. So if you are proud enough to think that I took you on your own merits,
  you are wrong. You might as well have told me your real name, and saved
  yourself some time. Look at that!' and he gave me a newspaper, and pointed
  out an advertisement. A firm of solicitors in London was advertising for me,
  and the firm, I happened to know, looked after my aunt's affairs. I went to
  London that night. My aunt had died sixteen months before, and had left me
  six hundred a year. The rest was easy. I took Sir John's advice. 'Railways,'
  he said, 'railways; they are the white man's tentacles;' and Sir John gave me
  my first employment as an engineer."</p>

  <p>Miranda was silent for a long while after Charnock had ended his story.
  Charnock himself had nothing further to say. It was for her to speak, not for
  him to question. She had sent the glove. She knew why he had come. Miranda,
  however, took a turn along the flagged pathway, and leaned over the
  breast-high wall and pointed out a vulture above the valley, and talked in
  inattentive, undecided tones upon any impersonal topic. It was natural,
  Charnock thought, that she should wish to con over what he had told her. So
  he rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Shall I come back to-morrow?" he asked, and she rallied herself to answer
  him.</p>

  <p>"Will you?" she exclaimed. "I should be so glad," and checking the ardour
  of her words, she explained, "I mean of course if you have nothing better to
  do," and she examined a flower with intense absorption, and then looked at
  him pathetically over her shoulder, as he moved away. So again he lost sight
  of the Miranda of the balcony, and carried away his first impression, that he
  had met that afternoon with a stranger.</p>

  <p>His fervour of the morning changed to a chilling perplexity. He wondered
  at the change in her. Something else, too, seized upon his thoughts, and
  exercised his fancies. Why had she stood so long outside the door before she
  hurried in with her simulated surprise? How had she looked as she paused
  there, silent and motionless? That question in particular haunted him, for he
  thought that if only he could have seen her through the closed door he would
  have found a clue which would lead him to comprehend and to justify her.</p>

  <p>Absorbed by these thoughts he sat through dinner unobservant of his few
  neighbours at the long table. He was therefore surprised when, as he stood in
  the stone hall, lighting his cigar, a friendly hand was clapped down upon his
  shoulder, and an affable voice remarked:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Aha, dear friend! Finished the little job at Algeciras, I saw. What are
  you doing at Ronda?"</p>

  <p>"What are you?" asked Charnock, as he faced the irrepressible Major
  Wilbraham.</p>

  <p>"Trying to make seven hundred per annum into a thousand. You see I have no
  secrets. Now confidence for confidence, eh, dear friend?" and his eyes drew
  cunningly together behind the glowing end of his cigar.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I must leave you to guess."</p>

  <p>"Guessing's not very sociable work."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that's why I am given to it," said Charnock, and he walked
  between the stone columns and up the broad staircase.</p>

  <p>The Major looked after him without the slightest resentment.</p>

  <p>"Slipped up that time, Ambrose, my lad," he said to himself, and sauntered
  cheerfully out of the hotel.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Charnock passed through the square at a quick walk.
  Wilbraham was meditating a translation of the Carmen Saeculare, but business
  habits prevailed with him. He thrust the worn little Horace into his
  breast-pocket and followed Charnock at a safe distance. By means of a skill
  acquired by much practice, he walked very swiftly and yet retained the
  indifferent air of a loiterer. There was another picture of the tracker and
  the tracked to be seen that evening, but in Ronda instead of Tangier, and
  Charnock was unable to compare it with its companion picture, since, in this
  case, he was the tracked. The two men passed down the hill to the bridge.
  Charnock stopped for a little and stood looking over the parapet to the water
  two hundred and fifty feet below, which was just visible through the
  gathering darkness like a ridge of snow on black soil. Wilbraham halted at
  the end of the bridge. It seemed that Charnock was merely taking a stroll. He
  had himself, however, nothing better to do at the moment. He waited and
  repeated a stanza of his translation to the rhythm of the torrent, and was
  not displeased. Charnock moved on across the bridge, across the Plaza on the
  farther side of the bridge, up a street until he came to an old Moorish house
  that showed a blank yellow wall to the street and a heavy walnut door
  encrusted with copper nails.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped again and looked steadily at the house and for a long
  while. Wilbraham began pensively to whistle a slow tune under his breath.
  Charnock walked on, stopped again, looked back to the house, as though he
  searched for a glimpse of the lights. But there was no chink or cranny in
  that blank wall. The house faced the street, blind, dark, and repellent.</p>

  <p>Charnock suddenly retraced his steps. Wilbraham had just time to mount the
  doorsteps of a house as though he was about to knock, before Charnock passed
  him. Charnock had not noticed him. Wilbraham descended the steps and followed
  Charnock back into the Plaza.</p>

  <p>Charnock was looking for a road which he had seen that afternoon from
  Miranda's garden, a road which wound in zigzags down the cliff. The road
  descended from the Plaza, Charnock discovered it, walked down it; behind him
  at a little distance walked Wilbraham. It was now falling dark, but the night
  was still, so that Wilbraham was compelled to drop yet farther and farther
  behind, lest the sound of his footsteps upon the hard, dry ground should
  betray his pursuit. He fell so far behind, in fact, that he ceased to hear
  Charnock's footsteps at all. He accordingly hurried; he did more than hurry,
  he ran; he turned an angle of the road and immediately a man seated upon the
  bank by the road-side said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Buenas noches</i>."</p>

  <p>The man was Charnock.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham had the presence of mind not to stop.</p>

  <p>"<i>Felices suenos</i>," he returned in a gruff voice and continued to
  run. He ran on until another angle of the road hid him. Then he climbed on to
  the top of the bank, which was high, and with great caution doubled back
  along the ridge until Charnock was just beneath him.</p>

  <p>Charnock was gazing upwards; Wilbraham followed his example, and saw that
  right above his head, on the rim of the precipice, an open window glowed upon
  the night, a square of warm yellow light empanelled in the purple gloom.</p>

  <p>The ceiling of the room was visible, and just below the ceiling a gleam as
  of polished panels. At that height above them the window seemed very small;
  its brightness exaggerated the darkness which surrounded it; and both men
  looked into it as into a tiny theatre of marionettes and expected the
  performance of a miniature play.</p>

  <p>All that they saw, however, was a shadow-pantomime thrown upon the
  ceiling, and that merely of a tantalising kind&mdash;the shadow of a woman's
  head and hair, growing and diminishing as the unseen woman moved away or to
  the candles. A second shadow, and this too the shadow of a woman, joined the
  first. But no woman showed herself at the window, and Charnock, tiring of the
  entertainment, returned to his hotel.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham remained to count the houses between that lighted window and the
  chasm of the Tajo. He counted six. Then he returned, but not immediately to
  the hotel. On reaching the Plaza he walked, indeed, precisely in the opposite
  direction, away from the Tajo, and he counted the houses which he passed and
  stopped before the seventh.</p>

  <p>The seventh was noticeable for its great doors of walnut-wood and the
  geometrical figures which were traced upon it with copper nails.</p>

  <p>The Major cocked his hat on one side, and stepped out for the hotel most
  jauntily. "These little accidents," said he, "a brigantine sighted off
  Ushant; a man going out for a walk! If only one has patience! Patience,
  there's the secret. A little more, and how much&mdash;a great poet!" And he
  entered the hotel.</p>

  <p>Charnock rose from a bench in the hall, "Pleasant night for a stroll,"
  said he.</p>

  <p>"Business with me, dear old boy," replied the Major. "I fancy that after
  all I have made that seven hundred per annum into a thou. I am not sure, but
  I think so. Good-night, sleep well, be good!" With a flourish of his hand
  over the balustrade of the stairs, the Major disappeared.</p>

  <p>Charnock sat down again on the bench and reflected.</p>

  <p>"Wilbraham's at Ronda. I find him at Ronda when I am sent for to Ronda.
  Wilbraham said good-night to me on the road. Wilbraham was following me;
  Wilbraham's clothes were dusty: it was Wilbraham who kicked his toes into the
  grass on the top of the bank while I sat at the bottom. Have I to meet
  Wilbraham? What has his seven hundred per annum to do with Mrs. Warriner?
  Well, I shall learn to-morrow," he concluded, and so went to bed.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <h3>WHEREIN THE HERO'S PERPLEXITIES INCREASE</h3><br>

  <p class="first">CHARNOCK, however, learned nothing the next morning, except
  perhaps a lesson in patience. For the greater part of his visit was occupied
  in extracting a thorn from one of Mrs. Warriner's fingers. They chanced to be
  alone in the garden when the accident occurred, and Miranda naturally came to
  him for assistance. She said no word about the glove, nor did he; it was part
  of the compact that he should be silent. He came the next day, and it seemed
  that there was something amiss with Miranda's hairpins, for the coils of her
  hair were continually threatening to tumble about her shoulders; at least, so
  she said, complaining of the weight of her hair. But again there was no
  mention of the glove. That afternoon Charnock was introduced to Miss Holt,
  whom Miranda kept continually at her side, until Charnock took his leave,
  when she accompanied him across the patio.</p>

  <p>"We never seem to get an opportunity of talking to each other," said she,
  with the utmost innocence. "Will you ride with me to-morrow? Say at two. We
  might ride as far as Ronda La Viega."</p>

  <p>Charnock, who within the last half-hour had begun to consider whether it
  would not be wise for him to return to Algeciras, eagerly accepted the
  invitation. To-morrow everything would be explained. They would ride out
  together, alone, and she would tell him of the dragon he was required to
  slay, and no doubt explain why, for these last two days, she had been
  marketing her charms. That certainly needed explanation&mdash;for even at
  this moment in the patio, she was engaged in kissing a kitten with too
  elaborate a preparation of her lips to avoid a suspicion that the pantomime
  was intended for a spectator.</p>

  <p>Charnock was punctual to the minute of his appointment, and in Miranda's
  company rode through the town. As they passed the hotel, Major Wilbraham came
  out of the doorway. He took off his hat. Charnock nodded in reply and turned
  towards Miranda, remembering his suspicions as to whether Wilbraham was
  concerned in the mysterious peril which he was to combat. To his surprise
  Miranda instantly smiled at the Major with extreme friendliness, and markedly
  returned his bow.</p>

  <p>"Clever, clever!" muttered the Major, as he bit his moustache and
  commended her man[oe]uvre. "A little overdone, perhaps; the bow a trifle too
  marked; still, it's clever! Ambrose, you will have that thousand."</p>

  <p>Charnock was perplexed. "How long have you known Wilbraham?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Miranda stammered, bent her head, and smiled as it were in spite of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"A long while," she answered, and then she sighed. "A long while," she
  repeated softly. Charnock was exasperated to a pitch beyond his control.</p>

  <p>"If you want to make me believe that you are in love with him," he
  returned sharply, almost roughly, "you will fail, Mrs. Warriner. I should
  find it hard to believe that he is even one of your friends."</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his lips before he regretted them. They
  insulted her. She was hardly the woman to sit still under an insult; but her
  manner again surprised him. He was almost prepared to be sent curtly to the
  right about, whereas she made no answer whatever. She coloured hotly, and
  rode forward ahead of him until they were well out of the town and descending
  the hill into the bottom of the valley. Then she fell back again by his side,
  and said: "Why is your face always so&mdash;illegible?"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's a lid&mdash;a shut lid," she said. "One never knows what you think,
  how you are disposed." She spoke with some irritation perhaps, but sincerely,
  and without any effort at provocation.</p>

  <p>"I was not aware," returned Charnock. "You must set it down to habit, Mrs.
  Warriner. I was brought up in a hard school, and learned, no doubt,
  intuitively the wisdom of reticence."</p>

  <p>"Is it always wisdom?" she asked doubtfully, and it seemed a strange
  question to come from her whose business it was to speak, just as it was his
  to listen. But very likely her doubt was in this instance preferable to his
  wisdom. Some word of surprise at the change in her, perhaps one simple
  gesture of impatience, would have broken down the barrier between them. But
  he had taken the buffets of her provocations and her advances with, as she
  truly said, an illegible face.</p>

  <p>"Is it always wisdom?" she asked, and she added: "You were not so reticent
  when I first met you;" and just that inconsistency between his bearing at
  Lady Donnisthorpe's ball, and his inexpressive composure of these few last
  days, might have revealed to her at this moment what he thought, and how he
  was disposed, had she brought a cooler mind to consider it. For the man was
  not chary of expression when the world went well with him; it was only in the
  presence of disappointments, rebuffs, and aversions that his face became a
  lid.</p>

  <p>They left their horses at a farm-house, and climbed up the rough, steep
  slope to the windy ridge on which the old Roman town was built. They sat for
  a while upon the stones of the old wall, looking across the great level plain
  of olive trees, and poplars, and white villages gleaming in the sunlight.
  Here was a fitting moment for the story to be told, Charnock thought, and
  expected its telling. But he only saw that Miranda scrutinised his looks, and
  he only heard her gabbling of this triviality and that with a feverish
  vivacity. And no doubt his face betrayed less than ever what he thought and
  felt.</p>

  <p>"Shall I see you to-morrow?" she asked as they parted that afternoon
  outside her door.</p>

  <p>"I will come round in the morning after lunch," he replied, and she
  uttered a quick little sigh of pleasure, which made Charnock turn his horse
  with a sharp, angry tug at the rein, and ride quickly away across the
  bridge.</p>

  <p>That first impulse to leave Ronda had gone from him. He was engaged,
  through his own wish and action, to serve Mrs. Warriner, and he was resolved
  to keep the engagement to the letter. But he was beginning to realise that he
  should be serving a woman whom in the bottom of his heart he despised. The
  message of his mirror became a fable; he recalled what Miranda herself had
  suggested, that the look of distress which he had seen upon the face was due
  to his chance visit to <i>Macbeth</i>; and certain words which a woman had
  spoken at Lady Donnisthorpe's dance as she sat by the window recurred to him.
  "There's a coquette" was one phrase which on this particular evening recurred
  and recurred to his thoughts.</p>

  <p>However, he returned to the house upon the rim of the precipice the next
  morning, and being led by a servant through the patio into the garden, came
  upon Miranda unawares. She was busy amongst her flowers, cutting the choicest
  and arranging them in a basket, and she did not notice Charnock's appearance.
  Charnock was well content with her inattention. For in the quiet grace of her
  movements, as she walked amongst her flowers, he caught a glimpse of the
  Miranda whom he knew, the Miranda of the balcony. The October sunlight was
  golden about them, a light wind tempered its heat, and on the wind were borne
  upwards to his ears the distant cries of peasants in the plain below. He had
  a view now and then of her face, as she rose and stooped, and he remarked a
  gentleness and a simplicity in its expression which had been foreign to it
  since he had come to Ronda.</p>

  <p>But the expression changed when she saw Charnock standing in the
  garden.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think I am cutting these flowers for?" she asked with an
  intolerable playfulness. "You will never guess."</p>

  <p>Charnock stepped over to her side.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Warriner," said he, "will you give me one?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a whimsical hesitation.</p>

  <p>"They are intended for Gibraltar," she said, as she caressed the bunch
  which she held&mdash;but she spoke with a great repugnance, and the
  playfulness had gone from her voice before she had ended the sentence.</p>

  <p>"For Gibraltar?" he exclaimed, remembering the gentle look upon her face
  as she had culled them. "For whom in Gibraltar? For whom?" He confronted her
  squarely; his voice commanded her to answer.</p>

  <p>She drew back from him; the colour went from her cheeks; her fingers were
  interclasped convulsively; it seemed as though the words she tried to speak
  were choking her. But her emotion lasted for no more than a moment, though
  for that moment Charnock could not doubt that it was real. He took a step
  forwards, and she was again mistress of herself.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will give you one," she said hurriedly. "I will even fix it in
  your button-hole. Will you be grateful if I do? Will you be very grateful?"
  Charnock neither answered nor moved. He stood in front of her with a face
  singularly stolid. But Miranda's hands touched his breast, and at the shock
  of her fingers he drew in his breath, and his whole body vibrated.</p>

  <p>And how it came about neither of them knew, but in an instant the flowers
  were on the ground between them, and her hands gripped his shoulders as they
  stood face to face and tightened upon them in a passionate appeal. He read
  the same passionate appeal in her eyes, which now frankly looked up to
  his.</p>

  <p>"You don't know," she cried incoherently, "you don't know."</p>

  <p>"But I wish to know," he exclaimed, "tell me;" and his arms went about her
  waist. She uttered a cry and violently tore and plucked his arms from
  her.</p>

  <p>"No," she cried, "no, not now," and she heard the latch of the door click.
  Charnock heard it too.</p>

  <p>"When?" said he, as he stood away, and the door opened and Major Wilbraham
  with his hat upon his heart bowed, with great elegance, upon the threshold.
  Miranda started. She looked from Charnock to Wilbraham, from Wilbraham to
  Charnock.</p>

  <p>"So he is one of your friends," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Have you the right to choose my friends?" she asked, and she greeted
  Wilbraham warmly.</p>

  <p>The Major seemed very much at his ease. It was the first occasion on which
  he had had the effrontery to push his way into the house, but from his manner
  one would have judged him a family friend. He waved a hand to Charnock.</p>

  <p>"So you are there, dear old darling boy!" he cried. His endearments
  increased with every meeting. "I saw you come in and thought I might as well
  call at the same time, eh, Mrs. Warriner? So pleasant, I meet Charnock
  everywhere. Destiny will have us friends. That dear Destiny!" And as Charnock
  with an ill-concealed air of distaste turned from them towards the valley,
  Wilbraham whispered to Miranda, "You need have no fear. I shall not say a
  word&mdash;unless you force me to."</p>

  <p>Miranda drew back. She stood for a moment with her hands clenched, and her
  eyelids closed, her face utterly weary and ashamed. Then with a gesture of
  revolt she turned towards Charnock.</p>

  <p>Instantly the Major stepped in front of her.</p>

  <p>"May I beg one?" said he, pointing to the basket of flowers. It was all
  very well for him to threaten Miranda that he would tell Charnock of her
  husband; but it would not suit his purpose at all for her actually to tell
  him on an impulse of revolt against the deception and the hold he himself had
  upon her. So he fixed his eyes steadily upon her face.</p>

  <p>"May I beg one?" and he bent towards the stool on which the basket was
  set.</p>

  <p>"Not of those!" she cried, "not of those!" and she snatched up the basket
  and held it close.</p>

  <p>"But you shall have one," she continued with a forced laugh, as over
  Wilbraham's shoulder she saw Charnock watching them, and she snapped off some
  flowers from their stems with her fingers until she held a bunch. "There!
  Make your choice, Major. A flower sets off a man."</p>

  <p>"Just as a wife sets off a husband, eh, Mrs. Warriner?" returned the
  Major, with a sly gallantry, as he fixed the flower in his button-hole. "Eh,
  Charnock, did you hear?"</p>

  <p>He joined Charnock as he spoke, and Miss Holt coming from the house, the
  talk became general. But Charnock noticed that at one moment Miranda moved
  carelessly away from the group, and leaning carelessly over the wall,
  carelessly dropped down the face of the cliff the whole bunch of flowers from
  which Wilbraham had chosen one. As she lifted her eyes, however, she saw
  Charnock watching her, and at once and for the rest of the time during which
  her guests remained, she made her court to Wilbraham with a feverish
  assiduity. She laughed immoderately at his jokes, she was extremely confused
  by his compliments, she displayed the completest deference to his opinions;
  so that even the unobservant Miss Holt was surprised.</p>

  <p>Charnock was the first to break up the gathering.</p>

  <p>"I must be going," he said curtly to Miranda.</p>

  <p>"It would almost seem that you were displeased with us," she answered
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said he, coldly. "I do not claim the privilege to be
  displeased."</p>

  <p>"Jolly afternoon," murmured the Major, in a cheery desire to make the
  peace, "good company, dear old friends"&mdash;and he saw that Miranda was
  unmistakably bowing good-bye to himself. He took the hint at once. The Major
  was in a very good humour that afternoon, and as the party walked back to the
  house, he fell behind to Miranda, who had already fallen behind.</p>

  <p>"Clever, clever," he remarked encouragingly, "to play me off against the
  real man. A little overdone perhaps, but clever. I trust I did my part. We'll
  make it a thousand per annum."</p>

  <p>Miranda quickened her pace and took her leave of her visitors at the door
  of the garden. Wilbraham was in no particular hurry to settle his business;
  he was quite satisfied for that afternoon, and he entered genially into
  conversation with Miss Holt upon the subject of her grievances.</p>

  <p>Thus Miss Holt and Wilbraham crossed the patio and entered the passage to
  the outer door. Charnock followed a few steps behind them; and just after
  Miss Holt with her companion had entered the passage, while he yet stood in
  the patio, he heard a door slam behind him.</p>

  <p>He turned, and walked round the tiny group of tamarisks in the centre of
  the patio. It was not the door into the garden which had slammed, because
  that now stood wide open, whereas he remembered he had closed it behind him;
  and the only other door in that side of the house was the door of Miranda's
  parlour. He had left Miranda in the garden; it was plainly she who had
  slammed the door, and had slammed it upon herself.</p>

  <p>Charnock was alone in the empty patio. It was very quiet; the sunshine was
  a steady golden glow upon the tiled floor, upon the tiled walls; above in the
  square of blue there was no scarf of cloud. He stood in the quiet empty
  patio, and the touch of her fingers tingled again upon his breast. Again he
  saw her drop the flowers she had culled for Wilbraham down the cliff. Amongst
  his doubts and perplexities those two recollections shone. They were
  accurate, indisputable. Her feverish vivacity, her coquetries, her
  friendliness to Wilbraham, her silence towards himself, the basket of flowers
  for Gibraltar&mdash;these things were puzzles. But twice that afternoon she
  had been true to herself, and each time she had betrayed the reality of her
  trouble and the reality of her need.</p>

  <p>It was very still in the patio. A bee droned amongst the tamarisks. It
  seemed to Charnock that, after much sojourning in outlandish corners of the
  earth, he who had foreseen his life as a struggle with the brutality of
  inanimate things was, after all, here in the still noonday, within these four
  walls, to undergo the crisis of his destiny. He gently turned the handle of
  the door and entered the room.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>MIRANDA PROFESSES REGRET FOR A PRACTICAL JOKE</h3><br>

  <p class="first">HE closed the door behind him. Miranda had neither seen nor
  heard him enter. She sat opposite to the door, on the other side of the round
  oak table, her arms stretched out upon the table, her face buried in her
  arms. She was not weeping, and Charnock might have believed from the
  abandonment of her attitude that she lay in a swoon, but for one movement
  that she made. Her outstretched hands were clasped together and her fingers
  perpetually worked, twisting and intertwisting. There was no sound whatever
  in the room beyond the ticking of a clock, and Charnock leaned against the
  door and found the silence horrible. He would have preferred it to have been
  broken if only by the sound of her tears. All his doubts, all his
  accusations, were swept clean out of his brain by the sight of her distress,
  and, tortured himself, he stood witness of her torture. He advanced to the
  table, and leaning over it took the woman's clasped hands into his.</p>

  <p>"Miranda!" he whispered, and again, "Miranda!" and there was just the same
  tenderness in his voice, as when he had first pronounced the name in the
  balcony over St. James's Park.</p>

  <p>Miranda did not lift her head, but her hands answered the clasp of his.
  She did not in truth know at that moment who was speaking to her. She was
  only sensible of the sympathy of his touch and the great comfort of his
  voice.</p>

  <p>Charnock bent lower towards her.</p>

  <p>"I love you," he said, "you&mdash;Miranda."</p>

  <p>Then she raised her face and stared at him with uncomprehending eyes.</p>

  <p>"I love you," he repeated.</p>

  <p>She looked down towards her hands which he still held and suddenly she
  shivered.</p>

  <p>"I love you," he said a third time.</p>

  <p>And she understood. She wrenched her hands away, she stretched out her
  arms, she thrust him away from her, in her violence she struck him.</p>

  <p>"No, it's not true," she cried, "it's not true!" and so fell to pleading
  volubly. "Say that it's not true, now, at once. Say there's no truth in your
  words. Say that pity prompted them and only pity," and her voice rose again
  in a great horror. Horror glittered too in her eyes. "Say that you spoke more
  than you meant to speak!"</p>

  <p>"I can say that," he answered. "When I came into this room I had no
  thought of speaking&mdash;as I did. But I saw you&mdash;I watched your
  hands," and he caught his breath, "and they plucked the truth out from me.
  For what I said is true."</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Very true," he repeated quietly.</p>

  <p>Her protesting arms fell limply to her sides. She nodded her head,
  submitted to his words, acknowledged their justice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "yes. I knew this afternoon. You told me in the garden,
  and though I would not know, still I could not but know."</p>

  <p>Then she rose from her chair and walked to the window. Charnock did not
  speak. He hung upon her answer, and yet dreaded to hear it, so that when her
  lips moved, he would have had them still, and when they ceased to move, he
  was conscious of a great relief. After a long while she spoke, very slowly
  and without turning to face him, words which he did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Love," she said, in a wondering murmur, "is it so easily got? And by such
  poor means? Surely, then it's a slight thing itself, of no account, surely
  not durable," and at once her calmness forsook her; she was caught up in a
  whirl of passion. She raised a quivering face, and cried aloud in despair:
  "It's the friend I wanted; I want no lover!"</p>

  <p>"But you have both," returned Charnock. With a hand upon the table he
  leaned over it towards her. "You have both."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Miranda. With extraordinary swiftness she swung round and
  copied his movement. She leaned her hand upon the table, and bent forward to
  him. "But to win the one I have had to create the other. To possess the
  friend I have had to make the lover," and she suddenly threw herself back and
  stood erect. "Well, then," and she spoke with a thrill in her voice, as
  though she had this instant become aware of a new and a true conviction, "I
  must use neither&mdash;I will use neither&mdash;I want neither."</p>

  <p>She faced Charnock resolute, and in her own fancy inflexible to any
  appeal. Only he made no appeal; he drew his hand across his forehead and
  looked at her with an expression of simple worry and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"My ways have lain amongst men, and men, and men," he said regretfully. "I
  wish I understood more about women."</p>

  <p>The simplicity of his manner and words touched her as no protestations
  would have done, and broke down her self-control.</p>

  <p>"My dear, my dear!" she cried, with a laugh which had more of tears in it
  than amusement, "I am not so sure that we understand so very much about
  ourselves;" and she dropped again into the chair and covered her face with
  her hands. But she heard Charnock move round the table towards her, and she
  dared not risk the touch of his hand, or so much as the brushing of his coat
  against her dress. She drew her hands from her face, held out her arms
  straight in front of her like bars, and shrank back in the chair behind the
  protection of those bars.</p>

  <p>"I do not want you," she said deliberately, with a quiet harshness. "That,
  at all events, I understand and know. Go! Go away! I do not want you!" and
  the words, spoken this time without violence or haste, struck Charnock like a
  blow.</p>

  <p>He stood dazed. He shook his head, as though it sang from the blow.
  Miranda drew in a breath. "Go!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"You do not want me?" he asked, and somehow, whether it was owing to his
  tone or his look, Miranda understood from the few words of his question how
  much he had built upon the belief that she needed him; and consequently the
  reply she made now cost her more than all the rest to make. "I do not," she
  managed to say firmly, and dared not hazard another syllable.</p>

  <p>Charnock felt in his breast-pocket, took out an envelope, and from the
  envelope a glove. "Yet this was sent to me." He laid the glove upon the
  table. "It was sent by you." Miranda took it up. "It contradicts your
  words."</p>

  <p>Miranda turned the glove over, and stretched it out upon her knees. "Does
  it?" she asked, with a slow smile, "does it contradict my words?"</p>

  <p>"You sent it to me?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt."</p>

  <p>"You summoned me by sending it."</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"For some purpose, then?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but for what purpose?" said she, leaning forwards in her chair. The
  cold smile was still upon her face, and seemed to Charnock unfriendly as even
  her violence had not been. It had some cruelty too, and perhaps, too, some
  cunning.</p>

  <p>"For what purpose? You should know. It is for you to say," he answered in
  a dull, tired voice. He had built more upon this unneeded service than he
  himself had been aware.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," continued Miranda. "You have talked to my companion
  Miss Holt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"She has no very strong faith in men. Perhaps you noticed as much."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I did not agree with her. I had the glove. It would be&mdash;amusing to
  know whether she was right or whether I was. I sent it to you."</p>

  <p>"Just to prove whether I should keep my word or not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>"Just for your amusement, in a word?"</p>

  <p>"Amusement was the word I chose."</p>

  <p>"I see, I see." His voice was lifeless, his face dull and stony. Miranda
  moved uneasily as she watched him; but he did not notice her movement or
  regard her with any suspicion. His thoughts and feelings were muffled. He
  seemed to be standing somewhere a long way outside himself and contemplating
  the two people here in the room with a deal of curiosity, and with perhaps a
  little pity; of which pity the woman had her share with the man. "I see," he
  continued. "It was all a sham?"</p>

  <p>Miranda glanced at him, and from him to the glove. "Even the glove was a
  sham," she said quickly. "Look at it."</p>

  <p>He bent down and lifted it from her knees. Then he drew up a chair to the
  table, sat down, and examined the glove. Miranda hitched her chair closer to
  the table, too, and propping her elbows there, supported her chin upon her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"You see that the glove is fresh," she said.</p>

  <p>"It has been worn," answered Charnock. "The fingers have been shaped by
  wearing."</p>

  <p>"It was worn by me for ten minutes in this room the day I posted it to
  you."</p>

  <p>"But the tear?" he asked with a momentary quickening of speech.</p>

  <p>"I tore it."</p>

  <p>"I see." He laid the glove upon the table. "And the other glove&mdash;the
  one you wore that night&mdash;the one I tore upon the balcony over St.
  James's Park? It was you I met that night in London? Or wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>The question was put without any sarcasm, but with the same dull curiosity
  which had marked his other questions, and on her side she answered it simply
  as she had answered the others. "Yes, it was I whom you met, and the glove
  you speak of was thrown away."</p>

  <p>It seemed that he had come to the end of his questions, for he sat for a
  little, drumming with his fingers on the table. Once he looked up and towards
  the window, as though his very eyes needed the relief of the wide expanse of
  valley.</p>

  <p>"Now will you go? Please," said Miranda, gently, and the next moment
  regretted that she had spoken.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I will go," he answered. "I will go back to Algeciras, and from
  Algeciras to England." He was not looking at her, and so noticed nothing of
  the spasm of pain which for a second convulsed her face at his literal
  acceptation of her prayer. "But before I go, tell me;" and the questions
  began again.</p>

  <p>"You say you need no one?"</p>

  <p>"No one."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you cry out a minute ago, 'It's the friend I want, not the
  lover'? You were not amusing yourself then. Why, too, did you&mdash;this
  afternoon in the garden, perhaps you remember&mdash;when the flowers fell on
  to the ground between us? Neither were you amusing yourself then."</p>

  <p>Miranda drew the glove away from where it lay in front of him; absently
  she began to slip it over her hand, and then becoming aware of what she did,
  and of certain associations with that action at this moment, she hurriedly
  stripped it off.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have no right to press you," he said; "but I should like to
  know."</p>

  <p>Miranda spread the glove out on the table, and carefully divided and
  spread out the fingers. "I will tell you," she said at length, with something
  of a spirt in the quickness of her speech. "I am still capable of remorse,
  though very likely you can hardly believe that. Do you remember," she began
  to speak with greater ease, "when we rode out to Ronda La Viega, I asked you
  why you never expressed what you felt? I was then beginning to be afraid that
  you would take my&mdash;my trick too much to heart&mdash;that you would
  really think I needed you. My fear became certain this afternoon, when
  I&mdash;I was putting the flower in your coat. I was sorry then, as you saw
  when you came into the room. I was yet more sorry when you spoke to me as you
  did, for I thought that if you hadn't cared, if you had never intended to be
  more than my friend, the trick would not have mattered so much. And that was
  just what I meant, when I said it was the friend I wanted, not the
  lover."</p>

  <p>Charnock listened to the explanation, accepted it and put it away in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I see," he remarked, and her bosom rose and fell quickly. "All this time
  you have been just playing with me as you played with Wilbraham this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Just in the same way," she returned without flinching.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you dropped his flower down the cliff," he exclaimed
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You forget that yours had already fallen on to the ground."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's true," and the suspicion died out of his face. "And that
  basket of flowers?" he asked.</p>

  <p>This time, and for the first time since the questions had begun, Miranda
  did flinch. She had a great difficulty in answering, "It has already been
  sent off."</p>

  <p>"To Gibraltar?" Miranda's difficulty increased. "To whom at Gibraltar? A
  friend, a man?"</p>

  <p>Miranda's face grew very white; she tried to speak and failed; her throat,
  her lips, refused the answer. "At all events," she managed to whisper
  hoarsely, "not to a woman," and thereupon she laughed most mirthlessly, till
  the strange, harsh, strangled noise of it penetrated as something unfamiliar
  to Charnock's dazed mind.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said; "I was forgetful. I had no right to ask
  you," and he rose from his chair. She rose too. "I am glad," he continued
  with a formal politeness, "that you do not after all stand in need of
  anyone's help."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she replied carelessly, "no one's;" and almost before she was
  aware, he was holding her wrists, one in each of his hands, and with his eyes
  he was searching her face, silently interrogating her for the truth. Once
  before, upon the balcony, he had bidden her in just this way answer him, and
  now, as then, she found herself under a growing compulsion to obey.</p>

  <p>"You hurt me," she had the wit to say, and instantly Charnock released her
  wrists.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said he, and he walked to the door. At the door he
  turned. "Tell me," he said abruptly, "you dropped your glove&mdash;not that
  one on the table, but the other&mdash;just as you stepped out on to the
  balcony?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, and wondered what was coming.</p>

  <p>"Was that an accident?"</p>

  <p>Miranda stepped back and lowered her head.</p>

  <p>"You remember everything," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Was it an accident?"</p>

  <p>"You are unsparing."</p>

  <p>"Was it an accident?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It was a trick, a sham like all the rest?"</p>

  <p>"Just like all the rest," said Miranda, wearily.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Charnock. "Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>It was very quiet and still in the patio. In the square of blue sky there
  was no cloud; the sunshine poured into the court, only in one corner there
  was a shadow climbing the wall, where there had been no shadow when he
  entered the room. He vaguely wondered what the time was, and then someone
  laughed. Someone above him. He looked up. Jane Holt was leaning over the
  railing of the balcony.</p>

  <p>He made some sort of remark; and he gathered from her reply that he had
  been asking why she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why did I laugh?" she said. "Do you believe in affinities?"</p>

  <p>"No," he rejoined. "Why?"</p>

  <p>She descended the stairs as she answered him.</p>

  <p>"I saw you standing in the doorway there with your hand on your throat,
  breathing hard and quick, and altogether a very tragical picture."</p>

  <p>Charnock was not aware whether the details were true or not. "Well?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," she replied. "Do you remember the afternoon you came here? I was
  in that lounge chair. You were shown into the parlour. You did not notice me.
  Neither did Miranda when she followed you. But she stopped on the
  threshold."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remarked it. She stopped for some while. Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she stood just as you were standing a minute ago, in that precise
  attitude, with her hand to her throat, breathing hard and quick, and with a
  face not less tragical."</p>

  <p>Charnock's face now at all events ceased to look tragical. Jane Holt saw
  it brighten extraordinarily. Miranda, had she been there, would not at this
  moment have complained of its lack of expression.</p>

  <p>"That's true?" he asked eagerly. "What you tell me is true? She stood
  here, and in that attitude?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That's the one point unexplained. I forgot to ask. She did not refer to
  it. She stood here breathing hard and quick, you say, before she entered the
  room&mdash;with all that appearance of surprise&mdash;she stood here! Mere
  remorse does not account for that, does not account for her manner. On her
  own showing it cannot account, since the remorse was only felt this
  afternoon. There <i>is</i> something more." He was talking enigmas to Miss
  Holt, who went into the parlour and left him in the patio to talk to himself
  if he would. She was not greatly interested in his relationship towards
  Miranda. However, Charnock was not the only person to talk enigmas to her
  that afternoon. She found Miranda standing just as Charnock had left her.
  Miranda remained standing, with any absent answer to Jane Holt's remarks,
  until the big outer-doors clanged to, and made the house tremble.</p>

  <p>Then she started violently. The sound of those doors shook her as no word
  or look of Charnock's had done. Her ears magnified it. It seemed to her that
  the doors swung to from the east and from the west, clean across the world,
  shutting Charnock upon the one side, and herself upon the other. It seemed to
  her too that as they clanged together, her heart was caught and broken
  between them.</p>

  <p>"You were wrong, Jane," she said. "There are men who would be friends if
  we would only let them. Possibly we always find it out too late; I only found
  it out this afternoon." The clock struck the hour as she was speaking. "Four
  o'clock; the train for Algeciras leaves at six-fifteen," she said.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <h3>IN WHICH THE MAJOR LOSES HIS TEMPER AND RECOVERS IT</h3><br>

  <p class="first">ALL that evening Miranda's imagination followed the 6.15
  train from Ronda to Algeciras. She looked at the clock at half-past ten. The
  ferry would be crossing from Algeciras to Gibraltar, and no doubt Charnock
  was crossing upon it. She felt a loneliness of which she had never had
  experience. And when she woke up in the morning from a troubled sleep, it was
  only to picture some stately mail steamer marching out from Algeciras Bay.
  She was conscious to the full of the irony of the situation. If she had only
  met this man years ago, seven years ago&mdash;that regret was a continual cry
  at her heart, and not the least part of her loneliness was made up from her
  clear remembrance of the picture of herself which she had given him to carry
  away.</p>

  <p>She ordered her horse to be brought round early that morning, and rode out
  past the hotel a few minutes before nine. Major Wilbraham saw her pass. He
  was down betimes as a rule when he stayed in a hotel, since it was his habit,
  as often as possible, to look over the letters which came for the different
  visitors. The mere postmark he had known upon occasion to give him quite
  valuable hints. There was only, however, a telegram for Charnock, which he
  genially offered to deliver himself and did deliver, running into Charnock's
  bedroom for that purpose. Charnock thanked him and read the telegram. It
  seemed to raise his spirits.</p>

  <p>"Good news, old friend?" asked the Major.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;interesting news," replied Charnock, as he lathered his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Well, you shall give me it another time," said the Major, as he saw
  Charnock put the telegram in his pocket. "So long!"</p>

  <p>The Major went downstairs and kept an eye upon the road. At ten o'clock he
  noticed Miranda returning slowly. He put on his hat and followed her. When he
  reached the house the horse was still at the door, but Miranda had gone in.
  He observed that Charnock was hesitating upon the other side of the road.
  Charnock was in fact debating his plan of action; the Major's was already
  prepared. The door stood open. Wilbraham put ceremony upon one side, the more
  readily since ceremony would very likely have barred the door in his face. He
  walked straight into the patio where Miranda stood before a little wicker
  table drawing off her gloves.</p>

  <p>"Had a pleasant ride?" said the Major. "Nice horse; I am partial to roans
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Miranda.</p>

  <p>"To so uncompromising a question, I must needs give an uncompromising
  reply. I want one thousand jimmies per annum," and the Major bowed
  gracefully.</p>

  <p>"No," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>"But excuse me, yes, very much yes. You see, there is my excellent young
  friend, the locomotive-man."</p>

  <p>"Can't you keep his name out of the conversation?" she suggested, but with
  a dangerous quietude of voice.</p>

  <p>"Indeed no," replied the Major, who was entirely at his ease. He looked
  sympathetically at her face. "You look pale; you have not slept well; you are
  tired, and so you do not follow me. Charnock is my God of the machine, a
  blind unconscious God&mdash;shall we say a Cupid, but a Cupid in the machine?
  Let me explain! May I be seated? No? So sorry! On the first night of
  Charnock's stay at Ronda, I had the honour to follow him while he took a
  stroll."</p>

  <p>"You followed him unseen, of course?" said Miranda, contemptuously, as she
  tossed her gloves on to the wicker table.</p>

  <p>"You take me, you take me perfectly," returned the Major. "I followed him
  unseen, a habit of mine, and at times a very profitable habit. Charnock
  walked&mdash;whither? Can you guess? Can't you tell?" He hummed with
  unabashed impertinence. "He walked down a certain road which winds down the
  precipice under your windows. Ah!"&mdash;he uttered the exclamation in a
  playful raillery, for Miranda's hand had gone to her heart; "he walked down
  that road until he came to an angle from which he could see your lighted
  window."</p>

  <p>"Show me," said Miranda, suddenly. She walked round the patio, threw open
  the door of her parlour, and crossed to the window. The window was open, and
  the Major looked out. The window was in the outer wall of the wing, and was
  built on the very rim of the precipice. Wilbraham looked straight down on to
  the road.</p>

  <p>"That was the angle, Mrs. Warriner," said he, pointing with his finger.
  "By that heap of stones he sat him down." Mrs. Warriner leaned out of the
  window with something of a smile parting her lips. "At the bottom of the bank
  he sat and aspired. Little Ambrose reclined on the top."</p>

  <p>Miranda turned from the window abruptly. "Let us go back." She returned to
  the patio and took her former position by the wicker table. Wilbraham, upon
  the other side of it, faced her.</p>

  <p>"We could only see the ceiling of the room," he continued, "and the shadow
  of your head. But so little contents an amorous engineer. He sighed, and what
  a sigh, and yet how typical! So hoarse it seemed the whistle of an engine; so
  deep, it surely came from a cutting. He went home singing beneath the stars.
  He did not tread the ground. How should he? Love was his permanent way."</p>

  <p>Miranda had listened so far without interruption, though the Major, had he
  been less pleased with his flowery description, might have noticed something
  ominous in the still depths of her dark eyes. "Mr. Wilbraham," she said,
  "there is a little wicker table between us."</p>

  <p>"I see it."</p>

  <p>"And on the table?"</p>

  <p>"A pair of gloves."</p>

  <p>"Not only a pair of gloves."</p>

  <p>"Ah true! A riding-whip."</p>

  <p>"I was sure that you had not noticed it before."</p>

  <p>The Major picked it up and examined the mounting of the handle. "It is
  very pretty," he remarked with emphasis, and laid it down again. "As I was
  about to say,"&mdash;he proceeded with his argument,&mdash;"I thus obtained
  on the night of Charnock's arrival a very clear knowledge of his sentiments
  towards you, while you, on the other hand, have been obliging enough to
  favour me with some hint of your own towards him, not merely this morning,
  when you asked me to point out the precise point of the road from which he
  worshipped your window, but yesterday when, in order to give an impetus to
  his bashfulness, you ingeniously courted myself. If I were, then, at all
  disposed to make unpleasantness, you see that all I have to do is to walk out
  of your house and inform the trustful Charnock that Mrs. Warriner is
  carefully concealing the existence of her husband from the man with whom she
  is in love."</p>

  <p>Miranda took up the riding-whip. The Major did not give ground. If
  anything, he leaned a little towards her. His eyebrows drew together until
  they joined; his bird-like eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Drop it! Drop that whip," he commanded sharply. "I warn you, Mrs.
  Warriner. I have dealt with you gently, though you are a woman; be prudent.
  What if I took the gloves off? Eh?"</p>

  <p>"You would place me in a better position," replied Miranda, who still held
  the whip, "to point out to you that your hands are not clean."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham stepped back, stared at her, and burst into a laugh. "I will
  never deny that you are possessed or an admirable spirit," said he.</p>

  <p>"I would rather have your threats than your compliments," said she. "For
  your threats I can answer with threats; I cannot do the same with your
  compliments."</p>

  <p>"Threat for threat, then," said the Major; "but there's a difference in
  the threats. You cannot put yours into practice since I have my eyes upon the
  whip, whereas I can mine."</p>

  <p>"Can you?" said Miranda, with a suspicion of triumph.</p>

  <p>"I can," returned the Major. "I can walk straight out of your house and
  tell Luke Charnock," and he banged his hand upon the table and leaned over
  it. "Now what do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I say that you cannot, for Mr. Charnock is at Gibraltar, if he is not
  already on the sea."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Charnock is at Ronda, and contemplating the ornaments of your door at
  this very moment," said the Major, triumphantly.</p>

  <p>But never did a man get less visible proofs of his triumph. Miranda, it is
  true, was evidently startled; her bosom rose and fell quickly; but she was
  pleasurably startled, as her face showed. For it cleared of its weariness
  with a magical swiftness, the blood pulsed warmly in her cheeks, her eyes
  sparkled and laughed, her contemptuous lips parted in the happiest of
  smiles.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham construed her reception of his news in his own fashion.</p>

  <p>"You may smile, my lady," said he, brutally. "It's gratifying no doubt to
  have your lover hanging about your doors, a wistful Lazarus for the crumbs of
  your favour. It's pleasant no doubt to transform a man into a tame whipped
  puppy-dog. There's not one of you, from Eve to a modern factory-girl, but
  envies Circe her enchantments, and imitates them to the best of her ability.
  Circes&mdash;Circes in laced petticoats and open-worked stockings&mdash;to
  help you in the dainty work of making a man a beast." The Major's
  vindictiveness had fairly got hold of him. "But in the original story, if you
  remember, the men resumed their shape; now what if I play Ulysses in our
  version of the story!&mdash;" There was a knock upon the outer door. The
  Major paused, and continued hurriedly: "Do you understand? That knock may
  have been Charnock's. Do you understand? He may be entering the house at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"He is," said Miranda, quietly.</p>

  <p>The Major listened. He distinctly heard Charnock's voice speaking to the
  servant; he dropped his own to a whisper. "Then what if I told him, your
  lover, now and here, the truth about Ralph Warriner?"</p>

  <p>"You shall," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>Major Wilbraham was completely taken aback. She had spoken in no gust of
  passion, but slowly and calmly. Her face, equally calm, equally resolute,
  showed him that she intended and understood what she had said. The Major was
  in a predicament. The drawback to blackmailing as a profession is that the
  blackmailer's secret is only of value so long as he never tells it, his
  threats only of use so long as they are never enforced; and here he was in
  imminent danger of being compelled to tell his secret and execute his threat.
  If Charnock knew the truth, he would certainly lose his extra three hundred
  per annum. Moreover, since Charnock was a man, and not a woman, he would very
  likely lose his original seven hundred into the bargain. These reflections
  flashed simultaneously into the Major's mind; but already he heard Charnock's
  step sounding in the passage. "I don't wish to push you too far," he
  whispered. "Tomorrow, to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"No, to-day," said Miranda, quietly. "You shall tell my lover the truth
  about Ralph Warriner, and to help you to tell it him convincingly you shall
  tell it with this mark across your face."</p>

  <p>Charnock did not see the blow struck, but he heard Wilbraham's cry, and as
  he entered the patio, he saw the wheal redden and ridge upon his face. He
  stood still for a second in amazement. Wilbraham had reeled back from the
  table against the wall, with his coat-sleeve pressed upon his smarting
  cheeks. Miranda alone seemed composed. There was indeed even an air of relief
  about her; for she was at last to be lightened of the deception.</p>

  <p>"Major Wilbraham," she said as she dropped the whip upon the table and
  walked away to a lounge chair, "Major Wilbraham,"&mdash;she seated herself in
  the chair as though she was to be henceforward a spectator,&mdash;"Major
  Wilbraham has a confidence to make to you," she said.</p>

  <p>"And by God I have!" snarled the Major as he started forward. It would be
  told for a certain thing, either by Mrs. Warriner or himself, and since the
  slash of the whip burned intolerably upon his face, he meant to do the
  telling himself.</p>

  <p>"That woman's husband is alive."</p>

  <p>Charnock's face was a mask. He did not start; he did not even look at
  Miranda; only he was silent for some seconds. Then he said, "Well?" and said
  it in a quite commonplace, ordinary voice, as though he wondered what there
  was to make any pother about.</p>

  <p>Miranda was startled, the Major utterly dumbfoundered. His blow had
  seemingly failed to hurt, and his anger was thereby redoubled.</p>

  <p>"A small thing, eh?" he sneered. "A husband more or less don't matter in
  these days of the sacred laws of passion? Well, very likely. But this husband
  is a peculiar sort of a husband. He slipped out of Gibraltar one fine night.
  Why? Because he had sold the plans of the new Daventry gun to a foreign
  government, being stony."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Charnock, again.</p>

  <p>"Well, I know where he is."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Charnock, for the third time, and with an unchanged
  imperturbability.</p>

  <p>Wilbraham suddenly ceased from his accusations. He looked at Miranda, who
  was herself looking on the ground, and gently beating it with her foot. From
  Miranda he looked to Charnock. Then he uttered a long whistle, as if some new
  idea had occurred to him. "So you are both in the pretty secret, are you?" he
  said, and stopped to consider how that supposition affected himself. His
  hopes immediately revived. "Why, then, you are both equally interested in
  keeping it dark! I can't say but what I am glad, for I can point out to you
  precisely what I have pointed out to Mrs. Warriner. I have merely to present
  myself at Scotland Yard, observe that Ralph Warriner is alive, and mention a
  port in England where he may from time to time be found, and&mdash;do you
  follow me?&mdash;there is Ralph Warriner laid by the heels in a place which
  not even a triple-expansion locomotive, with the engineer from Algeciras for
  the driver, will get him out of."</p>

  <p>"And how does that concern me?" asked Charnock.</p>

  <p>"The consequences concern you. It will be known, for instance, that Mrs.
  Warriner has a real live husband."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Charnock. He looked at Wilbraham with a curious interest.
  Then he spoke to Miranda, but without looking towards her at all. "It is
  blackmail, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said she.</p>

  <p>"It is a claim for common gratitude," Wilbraham corrected.</p>

  <p>"What's the price of the claim?" asked Charnock, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"One thousand jimmies per annum is the minimum figure," replied the Major,
  whose jauntiness was quite restored. Since his affairs progressed so
  swimmingly towards prosperity, he was prepared to forgive, and, as soon as
  his looking-glass allowed, to forget that hasty slash of the riding-whip.</p>

  <p>"And up till now how much have you received?" continued Charnock, in the
  same pleasant business-like voice.</p>

  <p>"A beggarly two hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>"Then if for form's sake you will give Mrs. Warriner an I O U for that
  amount she can wish you good-day."</p>

  <p>Wilbraham smiled gaily, and with some condescension. "Is it bluff?" said
  he. "Where's the use? My dear Charnock, I have a full hand, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Major," replied Charnock, "I hold a royal straight flush."</p>

  <p>He produced a telegram from his pocket. The Major eyed it with suspicion.
  "Is that the telegram I brought into your room this morning?"</p>

  <p>"It is. To keep up your metaphor, you dealt me my hand. Do you call
  it?"</p>

  <p>The Major cocked his head. Charnock's ease was so very natural; his good
  temper so complete. Still, he might be merely playing the game; besides, one
  never knew what there might be in a telegram. "I do," he said.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Charnock. He sat down upon a chair, and spread out the
  telegram on his knee. "You talk very airily, Major, of dropping in upon
  Scotland Yard. Would it surprise you to hear that Scotland Yard would welcome
  you with open arms, for other reasons than a mere gratitude for your
  information?"</p>

  <p>The Major was more than disappointed; he confessed to being grieved. "I
  expected something more subtle, I did indeed. Really, my dear Charnock, you
  are a novice! Sir, a novice."</p>

  <p>"But a novice with a royal straight flush. Major, why have you been living
  for four months at an out-of-the-way and unentertaining place like
  Tarifa?"</p>

  <p>"I will answer you with frankness. I wished to keep my fingers upon Mrs.
  Warriner. An occasional tweak of the fingers, dear friend, is very useful if
  only to show that you are awake."</p>

  <p>"Was that the only reason?"</p>

  <p>"No," interposed Miranda. "He wanted quiet; he is translating Horace."</p>

  <p>The Major actually blushed, for the first and last time that morning.
  Accusations, even proofs of infamy, he could accept without a stir of the
  muscles; but to be charged, perhaps to be ridiculed, with his one honourable
  project&mdash;the Major was hurt.</p>

  <p>"A little mean!" he said gently to Miranda. "You will agree with me when
  you think it over. A little mean!"</p>

  <p>"But there was a third reason beyond those two," resumed Charnock. "When I
  saw you dining at the hotel on the night of my arrival, when I remembered
  that you had been living for four months at Tarifa, where from time to time I
  had the pleasure to come across you, I began, for reasons which there's no
  need to explain, to wonder whether you were causing any trouble to Mrs.
  Warriner. That night, too, if you remember, when I went for a
  stroll"&mdash;here Charnock faltered for a second, and Miranda looked quickly
  up&mdash;"you followed me, Major. When I sat down at the foot of the bank,
  you crouched upon the top. You made a mistake there, Major, for I at once
  thought it wise to learn what I could of your history and character. I
  accordingly wrote a letter that night to a friend of mine, who also happens
  to be an official at Scotland Yard. His answer, you see, comes by telegraph,
  and you will see that a reply is prepaid."</p>

  <p>He handed the telegram to the Major. The Major read it through and glanced
  anxiously towards the door, taking up his hat from the table at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>"I think so, too," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"What does the telegram say?" asked Miranda.</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite, but every word of it is suggestive," answered Charnock.
  "I asked my friend if he knew anything of Major Ambrose Wilbraham. He wires
  me: 'Yes. Is he at Ronda?' and prepays the reply. If there's a warrant
  already issued, Major, I don't think I should waste time, but you of course
  are the best judge."</p>

  <p>"Did you answer it?" asked the Major.</p>

  <p>"I have not answered it yet. Do you think Scotland Yard will wait for an
  answer? It does not interest me very much. The one point which does interest
  me is this. You are hardly in a position to enter into communication with
  Scotland Yard in order to revenge yourself on Mrs. Warriner for not paying
  you blackmail."</p>

  <p>Major Wilbraham tugged at his moustache. His jauntiness had vanished, and
  his face had grown very sombre and tired during the last few minutes.</p>

  <p>"I get nothing, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not one depreciated Spanish dollar."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. The Major started; he looked from Charnock
  to Miranda, his mouth opened, his eyes widened, he became at once a creature
  scared and hunted. The door was opened; the three people in the patio held
  their breath; but it was merely the postman with a letter for Miranda.</p>

  <p>"I must get out of here," said Wilbraham. "I must get out of Ronda. My
  God, I have to begin it again, have I&mdash;the hunt for breakfast and
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>He showed a dangerous face at that moment. His lips were drawn back from
  his teeth, his eyes furtive and murderous. Miranda felt very glad of
  Charnock's presence.</p>

  <p>However, the Major mastered himself. He might have taken some sort of
  revenge by insulting Miranda, on account of her disposition towards Charnock;
  but he did not, and it was not fear of Charnock which restrained him.</p>

  <p>"I go back to the regiment, Mrs. Warriner," he said, "the regiment of the
  soldiers of fortune. I have had my furlough&mdash;four months' furlough. I
  cannot complain." He endeavoured to speak gaily and to bow with grace.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>Miranda was implacably silent.</p>

  <p>"And they call women the softer sex," said the Major.</p>

  <p>"One moment," exclaimed Miranda, taking no notice of his remark. "Mr.
  Wilbraham has a letter from my husband about the Daventry gun."</p>

  <p>"It is mine," answered the Major; "it was written to me."</p>

  <p>"I will buy it," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"For a thousand&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"No; for permission to answer this prepaid telegram to Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"In your name?"</p>

  <p>"In my name."</p>

  <p>"You're not a bad fellow, Charnock," said the Major as he drew out his
  pocket-book. He handed the letter to Charnock, looked at him curiously, and
  then laughed softly, without malice.</p>

  <p>"O lover of my life! O soldier-saint!"</p>

  <p>he quoted. "A great poet, what? Do you know Ralph Warriner? Will you play
  Caponsacchi to his Guido? You might; very likely you will." The Major took
  the reply form and turned away.</p>

  <p>"It is not always a profitable habit, it seems," said Miranda, "that habit
  of following."</p>

  <p>"A little mean!" said the Major, gently. "Perhaps, too, a little
  overdone," and as he went out of the patio Miranda flushed and felt ashamed.
  Then the flush faded from her cheeks and left her white, for she was alone
  with Charnock and had to make her account with him.</p><hr><br>

     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <h3>EXPLAINS WHY CHARNOCK SAW MIRANDA'S FACE IN HIS MIRROR</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MIRANDA rose nervously from her chair. She made an effort to
  speak, which failed, and then yielding to a peremptory impulse she ran away.
  It was only, however, into her parlour that she ran, and thither Charnock
  followed her. She stood up rather quickly in the farthest corner of the room
  as soon as he entered, drew a pattern with her foot upon the floor, and tried
  to appear entirely at her ease. She did not look at Charnock, however; on the
  contrary she kept her eyes upon the ground, and felt very much like a
  school-girl who is going to be punished.</p>

  <p>"Your husband is alive." Charnock's voice was cold and stern. Miranda
  resented it all the more because she knew she deserved nothing less than
  sternness. "Did you," he continued, "learn that from Wilbraham for the first
  time this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, and since she had found her voice, she added
  rebelliously, "No, teacher," and was at once aware that levity was not in the
  best of taste. Charnock perhaps was not at that moment in a mood for
  jocularities.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known that your husband was alive?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Five months," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Who told you?"</p>

  <p>"You."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. Miranda's foot described more figures on the
  floor, and with great assiduity.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Charnock. "It is very humorous, no doubt,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true," interrupted Miranda. "If I had wished to evade you, to
  deceive you, I should have answered that Mr. Wilbraham brought me the news
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"I should have disbelieved it."</p>

  <p>"You could not at all events have disproved it. You would have had not a
  single word to say." She raised her eyes now and confronted him
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Charnock, "I admit that," and a great change came over
  Miranda. She stepped out of her corner. She raised her arms above her head
  like one waking from sleep. "But I have had my fill of deceptions. I am
  surfeited. Ask what you will, I'll answer you, and answer you the truth. And
  for one thing, this is true: you told me Ralph Warriner was alive, that
  night, at Lady Donnisthorpe's."</p>

  <p>"I told you? On the balcony?"</p>

  <p>"No, before. In the ball-room. You described him to me. You quoted his
  phrases. You had seen him that very morning. He was the stranger you
  quarrelled with in the streets of Plymouth."</p>

  <p>"And you knew him from my description!" cried Charnock. All the anger had
  gone from his face, all the coldness from his voice. "I remember. Your face
  grew so white in the shadow of the alcove I should have believed you had
  swooned but for the living trouble in your eyes. Your face became through its
  pallor and distress the face which I had seen in my mirror. Oh, that mirror
  and its message!" He broke into a harsh bitter laugh, and seating himself at
  the table, beat upon his forehead with his clenched fists. "A message of
  appeal! A call for help! Was there ever such a fool in all the world? Here's
  one woman out of all the millions who needs my help, I was vain enough to
  think, and the first thing, the only thing that I did, was to tell her that
  her outcast bully of a husband was still alive to bully her. A fine way to
  help! But I guessed correctly even that night. Yes, even on that night I was
  afraid that I had revealed to you some misfortune of which you were unaware.
  Oh, why wasn't I struck dumb before I spoke? But you could not have been sure
  from my description," he cried eagerly, grasping in his remorse at so poor a
  straw as that subterfuge. "For men are not all unlike, and they use the same
  phrases. You could not have been certain. You must have had some other proof
  before you were convinced."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true."</p>

  <p>"And that other proof you got from someone else?" he said, and his voice
  implored her to assent.</p>

  <p>Miranda only shook her head. "I promised to speak nothing but the truth. I
  got that other proof from you."</p>

  <p>"No, no," he exclaimed. "Let me think! No, I told you nothing else but
  just my meeting with the man, my quarrel with him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miranda. "You told me how you woke up from dreaming of Ralph,
  and saw my face in your mirror. Don't you see? There is the convincing proof
  that the man you described to me, the man you quarrelled with, the man you
  dreamed of, was Ralph, for when you woke with that dream vivid in your mind,
  you saw my face vivid in your mirror. You yourself were at a loss to account
  for it, you had never so much as thought of me during the seven years
  since&mdash;since our eyes met at Monte Carlo. You could not imagine why on
  that particular night, after you had dreamed of someone else, unassociated
  with me, my face should have come back to you. But it was no mystery to me.
  The man you dreamed of was not unassociated with me; it was my husband, and
  the husband recalled to you the wife, by an unconscious trick of memory."</p>

  <p>"But I did not know he was your husband," cried Charnock. "I had never
  seen him with you; I had never seen him at all before that day I quarrelled
  with him in the streets of Plymouth."</p>

  <p>"You had," answered Miranda, gently. "He was with me that night at Monte
  Carlo seven years ago. We were on our honeymoon," she added, with a queer
  melancholy smile.</p>

  <p>Charnock remembered the look of happiness upon her young face, and
  compared it with the tired woman's face which he saw now. "He was with you!"
  he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You forgot us both. You met him again; you did not remember that you
  had ever seen him, but none the less, the memory was latent in you, and
  recalled me to you too. You could not trace the association, but it was very
  clear to me."</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" said Charnock. He sat with his elbows on the table and the
  palms of his hands tightly pressed upon his eyes. "I can see you, as clearly
  as I saw you then at Monte Carlo, as though you were standing there, now, in
  the room and I in the room was watching you. You were a little apart from the
  table, you were standing a few feet behind the croupier at one end of the
  table. But Ralph Warriner! Was he amongst the players? Wait! Let me
  think!"</p>

  <p>Charnock remained silent. Miranda did not interrupt him, and in a little
  he began again, piecing together his memories, revivifying that scene in the
  gambling-room seven years ago. "I can see the lamps with their green shades,
  I can see the glow of light upon the green table beneath the lamps. I can see
  the red diamond, the yellow lines upon the cloth, the three columns of
  numbers in the middle, the crowd about the table, some seated, others leaning
  over their chairs. But their faces! Their faces!" and then he suddenly cried
  out, "Ah! He was seated, in front of you, next to the croupier. You were
  behind him," and in his excitement he reached out his arm towards her, and
  with shaking fingers bade her speak.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said she, "I was behind him."</p>

  <p>"You moved to him. I understand now. His back was towards me at the
  first&mdash;when I first saw you, when our eyes met. It was that vision of
  you, the first, which I carried away, it was that only which I
  remembered&mdash;you standing alone there. It was that which came back to me
  when I saw your face in my mirror, just the picture of you as you stood
  alone, distinct from the flowers in your hat to the tip of your shoe, before
  you moved to the table, before you laid your hand on Ralph Warriner's
  shoulder, before he turned to answer you and so showed me his face. I
  remember, indeed. I saw his hand first of all. It was reached out holding his
  stake. I can even remember that he laid his stake on <i>impare</i> and then
  he turned to you. Yes, yes, it's true," and Charnock rose from the table in
  his agitation, and walked once or twice across the room. "It was Ralph
  Warriner I met at Plymouth, and because of that trivial, ridiculous quarrel,
  I told you that he lived!"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly in front of the writing-table, and stood staring out
  through the window, while his fingers idly played with a newspaper which lay
  upon the desk.</p>

  <p>"But Major Wilbraham," said Miranda, thinking to lessen his remorse,
  "Major Wilbraham told me too, and only a month later; he came to me in the
  Cathedral at Ronda here, and told me. He would have told me in any case."</p>

  <p>"Wilbraham!" said Charnock. "Yes, that's true. How did he find out? Who
  told Wilbraham?" and he turned eagerly towards Miranda.</p>

  <p>Miranda stammered and faltered. She had not foreseen the question, and she
  tried to evade it. "He found out. He used his wits. He saw there was profit
  in the discovery if he could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If he could make the discovery. I understand that; but how did he make
  the discovery?"</p>

  <p>"Why, what does it matter?" cried Miranda. "He followed up a clue."</p>

  <p>Charnock noticed her hesitation, her effort to evade his question. "But
  who gave him the clue?"</p>

  <p>Miranda moved restlessly about the room. "He set his wits to work&mdash;he
  found out," she repeated. She sat down in the same chair in which Charnock
  had sat. "What does it matter?" she said, and even as Charnock had done, she
  pressed her hands upon her face.</p>

  <p>"You promised me to answer truly whatever question I put to you," said he,
  who, the more she hesitated, was the more resolved to know. "I ask you this
  question. Who gave him the clue?"</p>

  <p>"Since you will have it then,"&mdash;Miranda drew her hands from her
  face,&mdash;"my poor friend, you did," she answered gently.</p>

  <p>Charnock was more than startled. His face changed. There was something
  even of horror in his eyes as he leaned across the table towards her. "I?" he
  gasped. "I did?"</p>

  <p>"I would have spared you the knowledge of that," she said with a smile,
  "if only you would have allowed me to; but you would not. You pointed out to
  him a brigantine, which you passed off Ushant."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the <i>Tarifa</i>."</p>

  <p>"The <i>Tarifa</i> was once the <i>Ten Brothers</i>, Ralph's yacht which
  was supposed to have been wrecked on Rosevear."</p>

  <p>"But the <i>Ten Brothers</i> was a schooner," urged Charnock. "I was told
  only a few weeks ago at Gibraltar&mdash;one of the Salcombe&mdash;oh yes,
  that's true too. I suggested to Wilbraham&mdash;to Wilbraham who said he was
  familiar with the look of the boat&mdash;I suggested to him that the
  <i>Tarifa</i> was one of the Salcombe clippers."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Wilbraham had known Ralph at Gibraltar, had seen the <i>Ten
  Brothers</i>, very likely had been aboard of her. That was why the look of
  the <i>Tarifa</i> was familiar to him. When you told him the <i>Tarifa</i>
  was a Salcombe boat he understood why it was familiar. It was the merest
  clue; but he followed it up and found out."</p>

  <p>"And blackmailed you!" continued Charnock.</p>

  <p>He turned back to the writing-table and the window. Again his fingers
  played idly with the newspaper. For a while he was silent; then he said
  slowly, "Do you remember what you said to me on the balcony? That no man
  could offer a woman help without doing her a hurt in some other way."</p>

  <p>"I spoke idly," interrupted Miranda.</p>

  <p>"You spoke very truly, for here's the proof."</p>

  <p>"I spoke to elude you," said Miranda, stubbornly. "It was a mere idle
  fancy which came into my head, and the next moment was forgotten."</p>

  <p>"But I remembered it," cried Charnock. "It was more true than you
  thought."</p>

  <p>"It was no more true than"&mdash;she hesitated. However, Charnock was not
  looking at her; she found it possible to proceed&mdash;"than another belief
  which led me astray, as this one is leading you."</p>

  <p>"What other belief?"</p>

  <p>Miranda nerved herself to answer him. "That no man would serve a woman
  well, except for&mdash;for the one reason."</p>

  <p>The nature of that reason was apparent to Charnock from the very tone in
  which she spoke the word. "And you believed that?" he asked. In a movement of
  surprise he had knocked the newspaper off the writing-table. Underneath the
  newspaper was a book.</p>

  <p>"I did believe it," she replied, her face rosy with confusion, "for a few
  mad miserable days," and she checked herself suddenly, for she saw that
  Charnock had absently opened and was absently turning over the leaves of the
  book.</p>

  <p>"Was the message of your mirror after all so false?" she whispered. He
  turned towards her, with a face quite illumined. He did not, however, leave
  the table, and he kept the pages of the book open with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Then after all you do need help?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Need it?" she returned with a loud cry, and she stretched out hands
  across the table towards him. "Indeed, indeed I need it, I desperately need
  it! I sent the glove because I needed it."</p>

  <p>"Then the glove was no sham?"</p>

  <p>"It was not the glove that you tore; that was thrown away, but not by me.
  I searched for it, it was not to be found. So I tore the other and sent it as
  a substitute."</p>

  <p>"And when I came, waited to discover," he added, "whether the one reason
  held me to your service. I understand."</p>

  <p>"You see," she agreed, "really, in my heart, all the time I trusted you,
  for I knew you would keep your word. I knew you would say nothing, but would
  just wait and wait until I told you what it was I needed done."</p>

  <p>Charnock turned abruptly towards her, and as he turned the book slipped
  off the table and fell to the ground. "But yesterday," he exclaimed in
  perplexity, "yesterday, here in this room, I gave you the assurance which you
  looked for. You believed a man would only help you for the one reason. Well,
  I told you that the one reason held with me; yet, at that moment, you
  rejected all help and service. You cried out, 'It's the friend I want, not
  the lover.'"</p>

  <p>"Because just at that moment I understood that my belief was wrong. I
  understood the shame, the horror, of the tricks I had played on you."</p>

  <p>"Tricks?" said Charnock. "Oh!" and as he stooped down to pick up the book
  he added in a voice of comprehension, "At last! You puzzled me yesterday when
  you said, 'To possess the friend you had had to <i>make</i> the lover.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said eagerly, "you understand? I want you to. I want you to
  understand to the last letter, so that you may decide whether you will help
  me or not, knowing what the woman is who asks your help. I sat down to trick
  you into caring for me if by any means I could. I did it deliberately, how
  deliberately you will see if you only open the book you hold. And it wasn't
  until I had won that I realised that I had cheated to win and could not
  profit by the gains. I won yesterday and yesterday I sent you away. Perhaps
  God kept you here."</p>

  <p>Charnock made no answer. He sat down at the table opposite to Miranda and
  turned over the leaves of the book, whilst Miranda watched him, holding her
  breath. He was not angry yet, but she dreaded the moment when he should
  understand the subject-matter of the book.</p>

  <p>The book was a collection of letters written by a great French lady at the
  Court of Louis XV. to a young girl-relative in Provence, and the letters were
  intended to serve as a guide to the girl's provincial inexperience. There was
  much sage instruction as to the best methods of handling men, "ces animaux
  effroyables, dont nous ne pouvons ni ne voudrons nous débarrasser," as the
  great lady politely termed them. In the margin of the book Miranda's pencil
  had scored lines against passages here and there. Charnock read out
  one:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Et prends bien garde de tellement diriger la conversation qu'il parle
  beaucoup de lui-même."</p>

  <p>"That accounts for the history of my life which I gave you in your
  garden," said Charnock. He was not angry yet; he was even smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miranda, seriously; "but there's worse! Go on!"</p>

  <p>"Soyez sage, ma mie," he read, turning over a page. "On ne possede jamais
  un de ces animaux sans qu'on peut bien disposer d'un autre. Celui que tu
  aimes, t'aimera aussi si tu fais la cour à un deuxième. Ils ont bien tort qui
  disent qu'il ne faut que deux pour faire l'amour. Il faut au moins
  trois."</p>

  <p>"That accounts for Wilbraham, and the basket of flowers for
  Gibraltar."</p>

  <p>"For Wilbraham, yes," said Miranda.</p>

  <p>Charnock did not notice that she excluded the basket of flowers from her
  assent. He read out other items, still without any appearance of anger. A
  foot carelessly exhibited and carefully withdrawn, the young lady in the
  country was informed, might kick a hole in any male heart, so long as the
  foot was slim, and the shoe all that it should be. Charnock closed the book
  and sat opposite to Miranda with a laughing face, enjoying her intense
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>"So you won by cheating?" he said, "and this book taught you how to
  cheat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I don't think you have grasped it," she replied seriously, "and
  I want you to. I want you to understand the horrible, hateful way in which I
  made you care for me. I now know that I ought to have relied upon your
  friendship when you first came to Ronda. But I chose the worse part, and if
  you say that you will not help me, why, I must abide by it, and Ralph must
  abide by it too. But there shall be nothing but truth now between you and me.
  I was not content with friendship, I had the time I knew to try to make you
  care for me in the other way, and I did try hatefully, and hatefully I
  succeeded&mdash;" and to Miranda's surprise Charnock leaned back in his
  chair, and laughed loudly and heartily for a long while. The more perplexed
  Miranda looked, the more he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, Mrs. Warriner," he said, and stopped to laugh again, "if I
  had met you for the first time at Ronda, I should have taken the first train
  back to Algeciras. Your tricks! I noticed them all, and they drove me wild
  with indignation."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" exclaimed Miranda, and her downcast face
  brightened.</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," answered Charnock. "Oh, your tricks! I almost hated you for
  them." He began to laugh again as he recollected them.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," replied Miranda, in the prettiest confusion, and as
  Charnock laughed, in a little her eyes began to dance and she laughed
  too.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you what kept me at Ronda?" he said. "Because, in spite of
  yourself, every now and then yourself broke through the tricks. Because,
  however much you tried, you could not but reveal to me, now and then, some
  fleeting glimpse of the woman who once stood beside me in a balcony and
  looked out over the flashing carriage-lights to the quiet of St. James's
  Park. It was in memory of that woman that I stayed."</p>

  <p>He was speaking with all seriousness now, and Miranda uttered a long
  trembling sigh of gratitude. "Thank you," she said, "thank you."</p>

  <p>"Now what can I do for you?" he asked, and Miranda made haste to
  reply.</p><hr><br>

     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <h3>SHOWS HOW A TOMBSTONE MAY CONVINCE WHEN ARGUMENTS FAIL</h3><br>

  <p class="first">SHE showed him the scribbled note which M. Fournier had
  brought; she told him M. Fournier's story; how that Ralph had run guns and
  ammunition from England into Morocco on board the <i>Tarifa</i>; how that he
  had been kidnapped between M. Fournier's villa and the town-gate; how that he
  was not held to ransom, since no demand for ransom had come to the little
  Belgian; and finally how that it was impossible to apply for help to the
  Legation, since Ralph was already guilty of a crime, and would only be
  rescued that way in order to suffer penal servitude in England.</p>

  <p>"What a coil to unravel!" said Charnock. "I know some Arabic. I could go
  to Morocco. I went there once, but only to Tangier. But Morocco? How shall
  one search Morocco without a clue?"</p>

  <p>He rested his chin upon his hand, and stared gloomily at the wall. Miranda
  was careful not to interrupt his reflections. If there was a way out, she
  confidently relied upon this man to find it. Once she shivered, and Charnock
  looked inquiringly towards her. She was gazing at the soiled note which lay
  beneath her eyes upon the table, and saw again the picture of Ralph being
  beaten inland under the sun. She began to recall his acts and words, that she
  might make the best of them; she fell to considering whether she had not
  herself been in a measure to blame for the shipwreck of their marriage. And
  so, thinking of such matters, she absently hummed over a tune, a soft
  plaintive little melody from an <i>opéra-bouffe</i>. She ended it and hummed
  it over again; until it came upon her that Charnock had been silent for a
  long time, and she looked up from the note into his face.</p>

  <p>He was not thinking out any plan. He was watching her with a singular
  intentness, his head thrust forward from his shoulders, his face very
  strained. It seemed that every fibre of his body listened and was still, so
  that it might hear the better.</p>

  <p>"Who taught you that tune?" he asked in a voice of suspense.</p>

  <p>"Ralph," said she, in some surprise at the question; "at least I picked it
  up from him."</p>

  <p>And Charnock fell back in his chair; he huddled himself in it, he let his
  chin drop upon his breast. He sat staring at her with eyes which seemed
  suddenly deep-sunk in a face suddenly grown white. And slowly, gradually, it
  broke in upon Miranda that he held the clue after all, that that tune was the
  clue, that in a word Charnock knew how Ralph had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"You know!" she cried in her elation. "You know! Oh, and I sent you away
  yesterday! What if you had gone! Only to think of it! You know! That tune has
  given you the clue? It was Ralph's favourite! You heard it&mdash;when? Where?
  Tell me!"</p>

  <p>To her eager, joyous questions Charnock was silent. He did not move. He
  still sat huddled in his chair, with his chin fallen on his breast, and his
  eyes fixedly staring at her. Miranda's enthusiasm was chilled by his silence;
  it was succeeded by fear. She became frightened; she picked up the note and
  held it out to him and bade it speak for her.</p>

  <p>Charnock did not take the note or change his position. But he
  said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Even on your honeymoon, you see, he left you to stand alone, while he
  gambled at the tables."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't think of that," she cried. "It's so small a thing."</p>

  <p>"But so typical," added Charnock, quietly.</p>

  <p>Miranda gave a moan and held her head between her hands. That Charnock
  might refuse to help her, because with tears in her eyes she had played the
  sedulous coquette, she had been prepared to acknowledge. But that he would
  refuse to help, out of a mistaken belief that, by refusing to help, he was
  helping best&mdash;that supposition had not so much as occurred to her.</p>

  <p>"Read the note again," she implored him. "<i>Do quickly what you
  can!</i>And see, it is a week and more since M. Fournier was here. It is a
  fortnight and more since Ralph was kidnapped in the Sôk. Quickly! And nothing
  is done, and nothing will be done, unless you do it. Oh, think of
  him&mdash;driven, his hands tied, beaten with sticks, sold for a slave to
  trudge with loads upon his back, barefooted, through Morocco! You will go,"
  and her voice broke and was very tender as she appealed to him. "Please! You
  will have pity on me, and on him." And she watched Charnock's face for a sign
  of assent, her heart throbbing, her foot beating the ground, and every now
  and then a queer tremulous moan breaking from her dry lips.</p>

  <p>Charnock, however, did not soften at the imagined picture of Ralph's
  misfortunes, and he hardened his heart against the visible picture of her
  distress.</p>

  <p>"When I was at Algeciras, I asked many questions about Ralph Warriner. I
  listened to many answers," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Exaggerated answers," she returned, and as Charnock opened his mouth to
  reply, she hastened to continue: "Listen! Listen! Here's the strange thing!
  Not that I should need help, not that you should help me, not that I should
  come to you for help. Those three things&mdash;they are most natural. But
  that coming to you, I should come to the one man who can help, who already
  knows the way to help. Don't you understand? It is very clear to me. You were
  <i>meant</i> to help, to help me in this one trouble, so you were shown the
  means whereby to help." And seeing Charnock still impenetrable, she burst
  out: "Oh, he will not help! He will not understand!" and she took to
  considering how it was that he knew, how it was that he recognised the
  tune.</p>

  <p>"You were in Tangier once," she argued. "Yes. You told me that not only
  to-day, but at Lady Donnisthorpe's. You crossed from Gibraltar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, just before I came to England and met you."</p>

  <p>"Just before! Still you won't understand? You find out
  somehow&mdash;somehow in Tangier you come across a tune, an incident,
  something. Immediately after you meet a woman, at the first sight of whom you
  offer her your succour, and the time comes when she needs it, and that one
  incident you witnessed just before you met her gives you, and you alone in
  all the world, the opportunity to help her. Don't you remember, when you
  first were introduced at Lady Donnisthorpe's, what was your first
  feeling&mdash;one of disappointment, because I did not seem to stand in any
  need? Well, I do stand in need now&mdash;and now you turn away. And for my
  sake too! Was there ever such a tangle! Such a needless irony and tangle, and
  all because a man cannot put a woman from his thoughts!" And then she laughed
  bitterly and harshly, and so fell back again upon her guesses.</p>

  <p>"You were in Tangier&mdash;how long?"</p>

  <p>"For a day."</p>

  <p>"When? Never mind! I know. I met you in June. You were in Tangier for a
  day in May. In May!" she repeated, and stopped. Then she uttered a cry. "May,
  that was the month. M. Fournier said May. You were the man," and leaning
  forward she laid a clutching hand upon Charnock's arm, which lay quiet on the
  table. "You were the unknown man who cried 'Look out!' through the closed
  door of M. Fournier's shop."</p>

  <p>Charnock started. He was prepared to deny the challenge, if assent
  threatened to disclose his clue. But it did not. M. Fournier knew nothing of
  the blind beggar at the cemetery gate where Charnock had first heard the
  comic opera tune and registered it in his memory. That was evident, since in
  all M. Fournier's story, there was no mention anywhere of Hassan Akbar.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted. "It was I."</p>

  <p>"And you shouted it not as a menace&mdash;so M. Fournier thought and was
  wrong&mdash;but as a warning to Ralph, my husband, whom you will not speak a
  word to save. You spoke a word then, very likely you saved him then. Well, do
  just as much now. I ask no more of you. Only speak the word! Tell me the
  clue, I myself will follow it up. Oh, he will not speak!" and in her
  agitation she rose up and paced the room.</p>

  <p>Charnock rose too. Miranda flew to the door and leaned her back against
  it.</p>

  <p>"Just for a moment! Listen to what M. Fournier said! He said that if once
  we could lay our hands upon the man who shouted through the door, we should
  lay our hands upon the means to rescue Ralph. Think how truly he spoke, in a
  truer sense than he intended. You know why he disappeared. You know who
  captured him. And if you don't speak, I shall have no peace until I die," and
  she sat herself again at the table.</p>

  <p>"Do you still care for him?" asked Charnock, with some gentleness.</p>

  <p>Miranda, who was wrought almost to frenzy, drummed upon the table with her
  clenched fists.</p>

  <p>"Must we debate that question while Ralph&mdash;" Then she mastered
  herself. "I know you," she said. "If I were to tell you that I loved him
  heart and soul, you would go upon this errand, straight as an arrow, for my
  sake. But I promised there should be nothing but truth between you and me. I
  do not love him. Now, will you go to Morocco? Or, if you will not go, will
  you speak?"</p>

  <p>"No. Let him stay there! Where he cannot harm you. What if I was
  <i>meant</i> to keep you from rescuing him?"</p>

  <p>"You do not know," she replied. "You can do me no greater service than by
  rescuing Ralph, by bringing him back to me. Will you believe that?"</p>

  <p>"No," said he, calmly, and she rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>"But if I proved it to you?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot."</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>She looked at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It is four o'clock," she said. "Two hours and a quarter before the train
  leaves for Algeciras. Will you meet me on the platform? I had thought to
  spare myself&mdash;this. But you shall have the proof. I will not tell you of
  it, but I will show it to you to-morrow at Gibraltar."</p>

  <p>She spoke now with great calmness. She had hit upon the means to persuade.
  She was convinced that she had, and he was afraid that she had.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "The 6.15 for Algeciras."</p>

  <p>They travelled to Gibraltar that night. Miranda stayed at the Bristol,
  Charnock at the Albion; they met the next morning, and walked through the
  long main street. Here and there an officer looked at her with a start of
  surprise and respectfully raised his hat, and perhaps took a step or two
  towards her. But she did not stop to speak with anyone. It was two years
  since she had set foot within the gates of Gibraltar, and no doubt the stones
  upon which she walked had many memories wherewith to bruise her. Charnock
  respected her silence, and kept pace with her unobtrusively. They passed into
  the square with Government House upon the one side and the mess-rooms upon
  the other. Charnock sketched a picture of her in his fancies, the picture of
  a young girl newly-come from the brown solitudes of Suffolk into this crowded
  and picturesque fortress with the wonder of a new world in her eyes, and
  contrasted it with the woman who walked beside him, and inferred the
  increasing misery of her years. He was touched to greater depths of sympathy
  than he had ever felt before even when she had lain with her head upon her
  arms in an abandonment of distress; so that now the uncomplaining uprightness
  of her figure made his heart ache, and the sound of her footsteps was a pain.
  But of the most intolerable of all her memories he had still to learn. She
  led him into the little cemetery, guided him between the graves, and stopped
  before a headstone on which Charnock read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>RUPERT WARRINER, Aged 2 Years.</p>

  <p>and the date of his birth and death.</p>

  <p>The headstone was of marble, and had been sculptured with a poetic fancy;
  a boy, in whose face Charnock could trace a likeness to Miranda, looked out
  and laughed between the open lattices of a window.</p>

  <p>They both watched the grave silently for a while. Then Miranda said
  gently, "Now do you understand? When Rupert was born, it seemed to me that
  here was a blossom on the thorn bush of the world. But you see the blossom
  never flowered. He died of diphtheria. It was hard when he died;" and
  Charnock suddenly started at her side.</p>

  <p>"Those flowers!" he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Upon the grave were scattered jonquils, geraniums, roses, pinks,
  camellias&mdash;all the rich reds and yellows of Miranda's garden.</p>

  <p>"You were cutting them, packing them, that afternoon when Wilbraham
  came?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Warriner shrank from looking at Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she confessed in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he exclaimed. Miranda glanced at him in fear. So it was coming;
  he was remembering the use to which she had put those flowers. Would he
  loathe her sufficiently to withdraw his help?</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I thought?" he continued. "No, you can't guess. You
  could not imagine it. I actually believed that you were cutting those flowers
  so that you might send them to&mdash;" and he broke off the sentence. "But
  it's too odious to tell you."</p>

  <p>"But I meant you should believe just that," she cried. "I meant you to
  believe it. Oh, how utterly hateful! How could I have done it? I wanted to
  hide that from you, but it was right you should know. I must have been mad,"
  and she convulsively clasped and unclasped her hands.</p>

  <p>"I understand why you dropped that bunch from the cliff," said Charnock,
  "after Wilbraham had picked a flower from it."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to bring you here," said Miranda, "so that you might know why I
  ask this service of you. As I told you, I have no love left for Ralph, but he
  was that boy's father, and the boy is dead. I cannot leave Ralph in Morocco a
  slave. He was Rupert's father. Perhaps you remember that after I met you at
  Lady Donnisthorpe's I came back at once to Ronda. I had half determined not
  to return at all, and when you first told me Ralph was alive, my first
  absorbing thought was, where should I hide myself? But it occurred to me that
  he might be in need, and he was Rupert's father. So I came back, and when
  Wilbraham blackmailed me, I submitted to the blackmail again because he was
  Rupert's father; and because he was Rupert's father, when I learned in what
  sore need he stood, I sent that glove to you."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Charnock, and they turned and walked from the
  cemetery.</p>

  <p>"Now will you speak?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he returned, "but I will go myself to Morocco."</p>

  <p>"It is your life I am asking you to risk," said Miranda, who now that she
  had gained her end, began at once to realise the consequences it would entail
  upon her friend.</p>

  <p>"I know that and take the risk," replied Charnock.</p>

  <p>They walked out towards Europa Point, and turned into the Alameda.</p>

  <p>"There is something else," said Miranda. "Your search will cost money.
  Every farthing of that I must pay. You will promise me that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I wrote to M. Fournier yesterday. He will supply you. There is one thing
  more. This search will interrupt your career."</p>

  <p>"It will, no doubt," he assented readily, and sitting down upon a seat he
  spoke to her words which she never forgot. "The quaint thing is that I have
  always been afraid lest a woman should break my career. I lived as a boy high
  up on the Yorkshire hills, two miles above a busy town. All day that town
  whirred in the hollow below. I could see it from my bedroom window, and all
  night the lights blazed in the factories; and when I went down into its
  streets there were always grimed men speeding upon their business. There was
  a certain grandeur about it which impressed me,&mdash;the perpetual shuffle
  of the looms, the loud, clear song of the wheels. That seemed to me the life
  to live. And I made up my mind that no woman should interfere. A brake on the
  wheel going up hill, a whip in the driver's hand going down,&mdash;that was
  what I thought of woman until I met you."</p>

  <p>"And proved it true," cried Miranda.</p>

  <p>"And learned that there are better things than getting on," said
  Charnock.</p>

  <p>Miranda turned to him with shining eyes, and in a voice which left him in
  no doubt as to the significance of her words, she cried:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My dear, we are Love's derelicts, you and I," and so stopped and said no
  more.</p>

  <p>They went back to the hotel and lunched together and came out again to the
  geraniums and bellas sombras of the Alameda. But they talked no more in this
  strain. They were just a man and a woman, and the flaming sword kept their
  lips apart. But they knew it and were not aggrieved, for being a man and a
  woman they knew not grievances.</p>

  <p>The evening came down upon Gibraltar, the riding lanterns glimmered upon
  the masts in the bay; away to the left the lighthouse on Europa Point shot
  out its yellow column of light; above, the Spanish sky grew purple and rich
  with innumerable stars.</p>

  <p>"The boat leaves early," said Charnock. "I will say good-bye now."</p>

  <p>Miranda caught the hand which he held out to her and held it against her
  breast.</p>

  <p>"But I shall see you again&mdash;once&mdash;please, once," she said, "when
  you bring Ralph back to me;" and so they separated in the Alameda.</p>

  <p>Charnock walked away and left her standing there, nor looked back. Stray
  lines and verses of ballads which he had heard sung by women in drawing-rooms
  here and there about the world came back to him&mdash;ballads of knights and
  cavaliers who had ridden away at their ladies' behests. He had laughed at
  them then, but they came back to him now, and he felt himself linked through
  them in a community of feeling with the generations which had gone before.
  Men had gone out upon such errands as he was now privileged to do, and would
  do so again when he was dust, with just the same pride which he felt as he
  walked homewards on this night through the streets of Gibraltar. He realised
  as he had never realised before, through the fellowship of service, that in
  bone and muscle and blood he was of the family of men, son of the men who had
  gone before, father of the men who were to follow. The next morning he
  crossed the straits to Tangier.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <h3>IN WHICH THE TAXIDERMIST AND A BASHA PREVAIL OVER A BLIND MAN</h3><br>

  <p class="first">HE went at once to the taxidermist's shop. M. Fournier
  expected him, but not the story which he had to tell.</p>

  <p>"You wish to discover the man who shouted through your door six months
  ago," said Charnock. "It was I."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier got together his account-books and laid them on the counter of
  the shop. "I have much money. Where is my friend Mr. Jeremy Bentham?"</p>

  <p>"It is Hassan Akbar whom we must ask," said Charnock, and he told Fournier
  of what he had seen on the day of his previous visit to Tangier.</p>

  <p>The two men walked up to the cemetery gate, where Hassan still sat in the
  dust, and swung his body to and fro and reiterated his cry "Allah Ben!" as on
  that day when, clothed as a Moor, Ralph Warriner had come down the hill. It
  was the tune which that Moor had hummed, and which Miranda had repeated, that
  had led Charnock to identify the victim and the enemy.</p>

  <p>Charnock hummed over that tune again as he stood beside the Moor, and the
  Moor stopped at once from his prayer.</p>

  <p>"Hassan Akbar, what hast them done with the Christian who hummed that tune
  and dropped a silver dollar in thy lap at this gate?"</p>

  <p>Hassan made no answer, and as though his sole anxiety had been lest
  Warriner should have escaped and returned, he recommenced his cry.</p>

  <p>"Hassan," continued Charnock, "was it that Christian who betrayed thy
  wealth? Give him back to us and thou shalt be rich again."</p>

  <p>"Allah Beh!" cried Hassan. "Allah Beh!"</p>

  <p>"It is of no use for us to question him," said M. Fournier. "But the Basha
  will ask him, and in time he will answer. To-morrow I will go to the
  Basha."</p>

  <p>Charnock hardly gathered the purport of Fournier's proposal. He went back
  into the town, and that evening M. Fournier related to him much about Ralph
  Warriner which he did not know.</p>

  <p>The idea of running guns in Morocco had appealed to Warriner some time
  before he put it into practice, and whilst he was still at Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>"I did not know him then," said Fournier. "He had relations with others,
  very likely with Hassan Akbar, but nothing came of those relations. When he
  ran from Gibraltar in the <i>Ten Brothers</i>, he landed at Tangier, and lay
  hid somewhere in the town, while he sent the <i>Ten Brothers</i> over to
  South America and ordered the mate to sell her for as much as she would
  fetch. But in a little while Ralph Warriner met me and asked me to be his
  partner in his scheme. He had a little money then, and indeed it was just
  about the time when Hassan's fortune was discovered. It is very likely that
  our friend told the Basha of Hassan's wealth. If he knew, he would certainly
  have told," said M. Fournier, with a lenient smile, "for there was money in
  it. Anyway, he had some money then, I had some, I could get more, and I like
  him very much. I say yes. He tells me of his ship. We want a ship to carry
  over the guns. I telegraph to the Argentine and stop the sale. Warriner sent
  orders to change her rig, as he call it, and her name, and she comes back to
  us as the <i>Tarifa</i>. The only trouble left was this. The most profitable
  guns to introduce are the Winchester rifles. But for that purpose one of us
  must go between England and Tangier, must sail the <i>Tarifa</i> between
  England and Tangier. I could not sail a toy-boat in a pond without falling
  into the water. How then could I sail the <i>Tarifa?</i> So Warriner must do
  it. But Warriner, my poor dear friend, he has made little errors. He must not
  go to England, not even as Bentham. To make it safe for Jeremy Bentham to go
  to England, Ralph Warriner must be dead. You see?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see. But why in the world did he call himself Jeremy Bentham?"
  asked Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Because he was such an economist. Oh, but he was very witty and clever,
  my poor friend, when he was not swearing at you. At all events he decided
  that Ralph Warriner must die, and that there must be proofs that he was dead.
  So he packed up a few letters&mdash;one from his wife before he was married
  to her&mdash;that was clever, <i>hein?</i> A love-letter from his
  <i>fiancée</i>which he has carried about next to his heart for six years! So
  sweet! So convincing to the great British public, eh? He found that letter by
  chance among his charts. He gives it to me and some others in an oilskin
  case, and sends me with one of his sailors to the Scilly Islands. And then
  Providence helped us.</p>

  <p>"All that we hoped to do was to hear of a wreck, in which many lives were
  lost, to go out amongst the rocks, where the ship was wrecked, and to pick up
  that little oilskin case. You understand? Oh, but we were helped. There was a
  heavy storm for many days at Scilly, and after the storm for many days a fog.
  On one day the sailor and I&mdash;we go out in the fog to the Western
  Islands, to see if any ship had come ashore. But it was dangerous! I can tell
  you it was very dangerous and very wet. However, we come to Rosevear, and
  there was the remnant of a ship, and no sailor anywhere. We landed on
  Rosevear, and just as I was about to place the oilskin case among the rocks
  where it would be naturally found, we came upon one dead sailor, lying near
  to the sea just as if asleep. I slipped the oilskin case into his pocket, and
  then with stones we broke in his face. Ah, but that was horrible! It made me
  sick then and there. But we did it, until there was no face left. Then for
  fear the waves might come up and wash him away, we dragged him up the rocks
  and laid him amongst the grass, again as though he was asleep. We made a
  little mistake there. We dragged him too far from the sea. But the mistake
  did not matter."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Charnock. "And that day I shouted through the door Warriner
  sailed for England?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Fournier. "I hired that morning a felucca to sail himself
  across to Tarifa."</p>

  <p>"I remember."</p>

  <p>"The boat lay at Tarifa. He set sail that night."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Charnock. "I spent the night here. I waited two days for the
  P. and O. at Gibraltar, we passed the <i>Tarifa</i> off Ushant, and three
  days later I met Warriner in Plymouth. Yes, the times fit."</p>

  <p>"It is very likely Ralph who told about Hassan," mused M. Fournier, with a
  lenient smile. "If he knew, he would have been sure to have told; for there
  was money in it. To-morrow I will see the Basha."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier went down to the Kasbah and found the Basha delivering justice
  at the gates. The suitors were dismissed, and M. Fournier opened his
  business.</p>

  <p>"We do not wish to trouble the Legation," said he. "The Legation would
  make much noise, and his Shereefian Majesty, whom God preserve, would never
  hear the end of it. Besides, we do not wish it." And upon that money changed
  hands. "But if the Englishman told your nobility that Hassan Akbar was
  hoarding his money in utter selfishness, then your nobility will talk
  privately with Hassan and find out from him where the Englishman is."</p>

  <p>The Basha stroked his white beard.</p>

  <p>"The Nazarene speaks wisely. We will not disturb the dignity of his
  Majesty, whom Allah preserve, for such small things. I will talk to Hassan
  Akbar and send for you again."</p>

  <p>That impenetrable man was fetched from the cemetery gates, and the Basha
  addressed him.</p>

  <p>"Hassan, thou didst hide and conceal thy treasure, and truly the Room told
  me of it; and since thy treasure was of no profit to thee, I took it."</p>

  <p>"When I was blind and helpless," said Hassan.</p>

  <p>"So thou wast chastened the more thoroughly for thy profit in the next
  world, and thy master and my master, the Sultan, was served in this," said
  the Basha, with great dignity, and he reverently bowed his head to the dust.
  "Now what hast thou done with the Room?"</p>

  <p>But Hassan answered never a word.</p>

  <p>"Thou stubborn man! May Allah burn thy great-great-grandfather!" said the
  Basha, and chained his hands and his feet, and had him conveyed to an inner
  room, where he talked to him with rods of various length and thickness. At
  the end of the third day the Basha sent a message to M. Fournier that
  Hassan's heart was softened by the goodness of God, and that now he would
  speak.</p>

  <p>The Basha received Charnock and M. Fournier in a great cool domed room of
  lattice-work and tiles. He sat upon cushions on a dais at the end of the
  room; stools were brought forward for his visitors; and M. Fournier and the
  Basha exchanged lofty compliments, and drank much weak sweet tea. Then the
  Basha raised his hand; a door was thrown open; and a blind, wavering, broken
  man crawled, dragging his fetters, across the floor.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" whispered Charnock; "what have they done to him?"</p>

  <p>"They have made him speak, that is all," returned M. Fournier,
  imperturbably. He kept all his pity for Ralph Warriner.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier translated afterwards to Charnock the story which Hassan told
  as he grovelled on the ground, and it ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When the son of the English first came into Morocco I showed him great
  kindness and hospitality, and how he returned it you know. So after I was
  blind I waited. More than once I heard his voice in the Sôk, and in the
  streets of Tangier, and I knew that he had quarrelled with his own people the
  Nazarenes, and dared not turn to them for help. I sit by the gate of the
  cemetery, and many Arabs, and Moors, and Negroes, and Jews come down the road
  from the country to the market-place, and at last one morning I heard the
  steps of one whose feet shuffled in his <i>babouches</i>; he could not walk
  in the loose slippers as we who are born to the use of them. And it was not
  an old man, whose feet are clogged by age, for his stride was long; that my
  ears told me which are my eyes. It was an infidel in the dress of the
  faithful. It may be that if I had seen with my eyes, I should never have
  known; but my ears are sharpened, and I heard. When he passed me he gave me
  greeting, and then I knew it was the Room. He dropped a dollar into my hands
  and whistled a tune which he had often whistled after he had eaten of my
  <i>kouss-kouss</i>, and so went on his way. I rose up and followed him,
  thinking that my time had come. Across the Sôk I followed him, hearing always
  the shuffle of the slippers amidst the din of voices and the hurrying of many
  feet. He did not see me, for he never turned or stopped, but went straight on
  under the gate of the town, and then turned through the horse-market, and
  came to a house which he entered. I heard the door barred behind him, and a
  shutter fixed across the window, and I sat down beneath the shutter and
  waited. I heard voices talking quickly and earnestly within the room, and
  then someone rose and came out of the door and walked down the street towards
  the port. But it was not the man for whom I waited. This one walked with
  little jaunty, tripping steps, and I was glad that he went away; for the bolt
  of the door was not shut behind him, and the dog of a Nazarene was alone. I
  rose and walked to the door. A son of the English stood in the way: I asked
  him for alms with the one hand and felt for the latch with the other; but the
  son of the English saw what I was doing and shouted through the door."</p>

  <p>"It was I," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>Hassan turned his sightless face towards Charnock and reflected. Then he
  answered: "It was indeed you. And after you had spoken the bolt was shot.
  Thereupon I went back to the Sôk, and asking here and there at last fell in
  with some Arabs from Beni Hassan with whom in other days I had traded. And
  for a long while I talked to them, showing that there was no danger, for the
  Room was without friends amongst his own people, and moreover that he would
  fetch a price, every okesa of which was theirs. And at the last they agreed
  with me that I should deliver him to them at night outside the walls of
  Tangier and they would take him away and treat him ill, and sell him for a
  slave in their own country. But the Room had gone from Tangier and the Arabs
  moved to Tetuan and Omara and Sôk-et-Trun, but after a while they returned to
  Tangier and the Room also returned; and the time I had waited for had
  come."</p>

  <p>"What have you done with him?" said the Basha. "Speak."</p>

  <p>"I besought a lad who had been my servant to watch the Room Bentham, and
  his goings and comings. With the dollar which he had given me I bought a
  little old tent of palmetto and set it up in the corner of the Sôk apart from
  the tents of the cobblers."</p>

  <p>"Well?" interrupted M. Fournier, "speak quickly."</p>

  <p>"One evening the lad came to me and said the Room had gone up to a house
  on the hill above the Sôk, where there were many lights and much noise of
  feasting. So I went down the Sôk to where the Arabs slept by their camels and
  said to them, 'It will be to-night.' And as God willed it the night was dark.
  The lad led me to the house and I sat outside it till the noise grew less and
  many went away. At last the Nazarene Bentham came to the door and his mule
  was brought for him and he mounted. I asked the boy who guided me, 'Is it
  he?' and the boy answered 'Yes.' So I dismissed him and followed the mule
  down the hill to the Sôk, which was very quiet. Then I ran after him and
  called, and he stopped his mule till I came up with him. 'What is it?' he
  asked, and I threw a cloth over his head and dragged him from the mule. We
  both fell to the ground, but I had one arm about his neck pressing the cloth
  to his mouth so that he could not cry out. I pressed him into the mud of the
  Sôk and put my knee upon his chest and bound his arms together. Then I
  carried him to my tent and took the cloth from his head, for I wished to hear
  him speak and be sure that it was Bentham. But he understood my wish and
  would not speak. So I took his mule-hobbles which I had stolen while he
  feasted, and made them hot in a fire and tied them about his ankles and in a
  little while I made him cry out and I was sure. Then I stripped him of his
  clothes and put upon him my own rags. The Arabs came to the tent an hour
  later. I gagged Bentham and gave him up to them bound, and in the dark they
  took him away, with the mule. His clothes I buried in the ground under my
  tent, and in the morning stamped the ground down and took the tent away."</p>

  <p>"And the chief of these Arabs? Give me his name," said the Basha.</p>

  <p>"Mallam Juzeed," replied Hassan.</p>

  <p>The Basha waved his hand to the soldiers and Hassan was dragged away.</p>

  <p>"I will send a soldier with you, give you a letter to the Sheikh of Beni
  Hassan, and he will discover the Room, if he is to be found in those parts,"
  said the Basha to M. Fournier.</p>

  <p>Charnock spent the greater part of a month in formalities. He took the
  letter from the Basha and many other letters to Jews of importance in the
  towns with which M. Fournier was able to provide him; he hired the boy Hamet
  who had acted as his guide on his first visit, and getting together an
  equipment as for a long journey in Morocco, rode out over the Hill of the Two
  Seas into the inlands of that mysterious and enchanted country.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <h3>TELLS OF CHARNOCK'S WANDERINGS IN MOROCCO AND OF A WALNUT-WOOD
  DOOR</h3><br>

  <p class="first">IN the course of time Charnock came to a village of huts
  enclosed within an impenetrable rampart of cactus upon the flank of the hills
  southward of Mequinez and there met the Sheikh. The Sheikh laid his hands
  upon Mallam Juzeed and bade him speak, which he did with a wise promptitude.
  It was true; they had taken the Christian from Tangier, but they had sold him
  on the way. They had chanced to arrive at the great houseless and treeless
  plain of Seguedla, a day's march from Alkasar, on a Wednesday; and since
  every Wednesday an open market is held upon two or three low hills which jut
  out from the plain, they had sold Ralph Warriner there to a travelling
  merchant of the Mtoga. Mallam supplied the merchant's name and the direction
  of his journey. Charnock packed his tents upon his mules and disappeared into
  the south.</p>

  <p>For two years he disappeared, or almost disappeared; almost, since through
  the freemasonry of the Jews, that great telephone across Barbary by which the
  Jew at Tangier shall hear the words which the Jew speaks at Tafilet, M.
  Fournier was able to obtain now and again rare news of Charnock, and, as it
  were, a rare glimpse of him at Saforo, at Marakesch, at Tarudant, and to
  supply him with money. Then came a long interval, until a Jew of the Waddoon
  stopped Fournier in the Sôk of Tangier, handed him a letter, and told him
  that many months ago, as he rode at nightfall down a desolate pass of the
  Upper Atlas mountains, he came to an inhospitable wilderness of stones, where
  one in Moorish dress and speaking the Moorish tongue was watching the antics
  of a snake-charmer by the light of a scanty fire of brushwood. The Moor had
  two servants with him but no escort, and no tent, and for safety's sake the
  Jew stayed with him that night. In the morning the Moor had given him the
  letter to M. Fournier and had bidden him say that he was well.</p>

  <p>In that letter Charnock told in detail the history of his search. How he
  had held to his clue, how he had missed it and retraced his steps, how he had
  followed the merchant to Figuig on the borders of Algeria, and back; how he
  had gone south into the country of Sus and was now returning northwards to
  Mequinez. He had discarded the escort, because if a protection to himself, it
  was a warning to the Arabs with whom he fell in. They grew wary and shut
  their lips, distrusting him, distrusting his business; and since he could
  speak Arabic before, he had picked up sufficient of the Moghrebbin dialect,
  what with his dark face and Hamet to come to his aid, to pass muster as a
  native. M. Fournier sent the letter on to Mrs. Warriner at Ronda, who read it
  and re-read it and blamed her selfishness in sending any man upon such an
  errand, and wondered why she of all women in the world should have found a
  man ready to do her this service. Many a time as she looked from her window
  over the valley she speculated what his thoughts were as he camped in the
  night-air on the plains and among the passes. Did his thoughts turn to Ronda?
  Did he see her there obtruding a figure of a monstrous impertinence and
  vanity? For she had asked of him what no woman had a right to ask.</p>

  <p>His frank confession of how he had defined women came back to her with a
  pitiless conviction; "A brake on the wheel going up hill, a whip in the
  driver's hand going down." It was true! It was true! She was the instance
  which proved it true. There were unhappy months for Miranda of the
  balcony.</p>

  <p>At times Jane Holt would be wakened from her sleep by a great cry, and
  getting from her bed she would walk round the landing half-way up the patio,
  to Miranda's bedroom, only to find it empty. She would descend the staircase,
  and coming into the little parlour, would discover Miranda leaning out of the
  open window and looking down to a certain angle of the winding road.</p>

  <p>She had dreamed, she had seen in her dream Charnock with his two servants
  encamped upon a hill-side or on a plain, and hooded figures in long robes
  crawling, creeping, towards them, crouching behind boulders, or writhing
  their bodies across fields of flowers. She saw him too in the narrow, dim
  alleys of ruined towns, lured through a doorway behind impenetrable walls,
  and then robbed for his money and tortured for his creed.</p>

  <p>At such times the sight of that road whence he had looked upwards to her
  window was a consolation, almost a confutation of her dreams. There at that
  visible corner of the road, underneath these same stars and the same purple
  sky, Charnock had sat and gazed at this window from which she leaned. He
  could not be dead! And carried away by a feverish revulsion, she would at
  times come to fancy that he had returned, that he was even now seated on the
  bank by the roadside, that but for the gloom she would surely distinguish
  him, that in spite of the gloom she could faintly distinguish him. And so her
  cousin would speak to her, and with some commonplace excuse that the night
  was hot, Miranda would get her back to her room.</p>

  <p>These were terrible months for Miranda of the balcony. And the months
  lengthened, and again no news came. Miranda began to wonder whether she had
  only sent Charnock out to meet Ralph's disaster, to become a slave beaten and
  whipped and shackled, and driven this way and that through the barbarous
  inlands.</p>

  <p>The months were piled one upon the other. The weight of their burden could
  be measured by the changes in Miranda's bearing. Her cheeks grew thin, her
  manner feverish. The mere slamming of a door would fling the blood into her
  face like scarlet; an unexpected entrance set her heart racing till it
  stifled her.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Charnock had long ceased to be troubled by the interruption of
  his career. He moved now across wide prairies of iris and asphodel under a
  blazing African sun, with perhaps a single palm tree standing naked somewhere
  within view, or a cluster of dwarf olives; he halted now for the night under
  a sinister sky on a dark plain, which stretched to the horizon level as the
  sea; he would skirt a hill and come unawares upon some white town of vast,
  gaunt, crumbling walls, that ran out for no reason into the surrounding
  country, and for no reason stopped. He passed beneath their ruined
  crenellations, under the great gateways into the tortuous and dark streets
  where men noiseless and sombre went their shrouded way. There were nights too
  when he sat with a Mouser pistol in his hand, searching the darkness until
  the dawn.</p>

  <p>The continent he had left behind seemed very far away; the echo of its
  clamours diminished; the hurry of its conflicts became unreasonable and
  strange. He was in a country where the moss upon the palace roofs was itself
  of an immemorial antiquity; where neither the face of the country nor the
  ways of those who lived on it had changed. He had waited as he turned his
  back upon a town in the violet sunset, to see the white flags break out upon
  the tops of the minarets, and the Mueddins appear. He had waited for their
  cry, "Allah Akbar!" and for the great plaintive moan of prayer which rose to
  answer it from the terraces, the bazaars, from every corner of the town, and
  which trembled away with infinite melancholy over infinite plains, "Allah
  Akbar! Allah Akbar!"</p>

  <p>From those very minarets, during long successive centuries, a Mueddin at
  just that hour had uttered just that cry; so that the Mueddin became nothing,
  but the cry echoed down the years. And just that same answer had risen and
  trembled out in just the same plaintive mournfulness, so that those who
  prayed became of no account, and the prayer repeated by the generations, the
  one thing which lived.</p>

  <p>Charnock used to halt upon his road, turn his face backwards to the town,
  and picture to himself that from East to West the whole continent of Africa
  was murmurous with that one prayer, that the Atlantic carried away the sound
  of it upon its receding waves, and that the Nile floated it down from village
  to village through the Soudan. He ceased to wonder at the indifference, the
  passivity, the fatalism, of these mysterious men amongst whom he lived; for
  he felt something of that fatalism invading himself.</p>

  <p>He continued his search, northwards from the Atlas, escaping here a band
  of robbers, there struggling in the whirl of a swollen stream, listening at
  night to the cries of the jackals, and yielding to the witchery of a
  monotonous Arab flute into which one servant blew a few yards away, while
  Hamet, in a high strident voice, chanted a no less monotonous song. He
  continued his search almost because "it was written."</p>

  <p>Until on a dull afternoon he came to Mequinez, with its palaces of dead
  kings, which rise up one behind the other, draped in golden lichens, vast
  roofs stretching away into the distance, green and grey with the whipping of
  rains, tower overtopping tower, crumbling crenellations of wall, silent,
  oppressive. Each palace shut and barred after its master was dead, and left
  so, to frown into decay and make a habitation for the storks.</p>

  <p>To this city Charnock tracked the merchant, and taking up his abode in the
  Mellah with a Jew to whom M. Fournier had recommended him, he walked out
  through the streets beneath the walls of the palaces, neither inquiring for
  the merchant nor scanning the faces of the passers-by, but wrapped in his
  burnous, careless of any cry, impenetrable, unobservant, until he came out of
  the darkness of a bazaar, and saw, right before his eyes, a door.</p>

  <p>The door was set in a wall perhaps sixty feet high. Charnock could not see
  the top for the narrowness of the street. Blank, and menacing in the sinister
  light, the wall towered up before his eyes, and reached out to the right and
  to the left. And at the foot of the wall was the door&mdash;a door of walnut
  wood, studded with copper nails, and the nails were intricately ordered in a
  geometrical figure, impossible for the eye to unravel.</p>

  <p>That Charnock already knew; he had made trial before now to unravel those
  geometrical figures, once, very long ago, and very far away in the white
  sunlit street of a Spanish town. Charnock stood and stared at the door, and
  the Spanish town loomed larger before his vision, drew nearer, moved towards
  him, first slowly, then quickly, then in a rush. Ronda! Ronda! The town, as
  it were, swept over him. He seemed to wake; he seemed to stand again in the
  street. To his right was the chasm of the Tajo, and the bridge, and the
  boiling torrent; behind that door lived&mdash;and these two years slipped
  from him like a cloak. With an unconscious movement of his hands he pushed
  the hood back from his forehead, and stood bare-headed and alert. He was
  again one of the hurrying, strenuous, curious folk who live beyond the
  Straits.</p>

  <p>He gazed at the door. Behind that door's fellow Miranda lived and waited.
  Even as the thought burned through his mind, the door opened. For a moment
  Charnock imagined that Miranda herself would step out; but only a Moor came
  forth from an interview with the Basha, and a ragged, decrepit greybeard of a
  servant attended on the Moor and made his path. Charnock was in an instant
  aware of a grey light filtering between the squalid roof-tops, of the filth
  of the streets, of the tottering walls of Mulai Ismail. He was in
  Mequinez.</p>

  <p>And at Mequinez the long two years should end, and in ending bear their
  fruit. That door, on which his eyes were set, augured as much, nay promised
  it. "Not a sparrow shall fall...." Just for this reason, centuries ago, a
  Moorish conqueror had taken these slabs of walnut wood in Spain, and brought
  them back upon the shoulders of his slaves and made his door from them and
  set it in his wall at Mequinez; just that Charnock coming to this spot
  centuries afterwards might be quickened in his service towards a woman, and
  gird himself about with the memory of things which were growing dim, and be
  assured the service should not fail! Charnock was uplifted to believe it.</p>

  <p>He drew the hood again about his head, and the voice of the Mueddin called
  the world to prayer. Through the open doors of the mosques, from the white
  walls glimmering in the dimness within those doors, from the streets, from
  the houses, the high-pitched tremulous prayer rose and declined in an arc of
  sound.</p>

  <p>Charnock felt his whole being throb exultantly. At Mequinez, yes, and
  to-night, his search would end. Surely to-night! For the hour after the
  evening prayer was the hour for the selling of slaves.</p>

  <p>Charnock walked to the market and sat himself down in the first dim
  corner. He did not choose a place prominent and visible, inviting whosoever
  had wares to sell; he took the first seat which offered&mdash;certain that
  wherever he sat Ralph Warriner would be brought to him. He sat down and
  looked about him.</p>

  <p>Some half a dozen men were grouped about the market talking; a young
  negress from the Soudan, a white Moorish girl, a young negro from Timbuctoo,
  were brought to them in turn. They examined their teeth, their arms, their
  feet. The Moorish girl was bought; the others passed on, each with the owner.
  They were followed by the Moor whom Charnock had seen step from the Basha's
  door. He wished to sell his decrepit greybeard, and was met with laughter
  wheresoever he turned. These were all the slaves in the market.</p>

  <p>Charnock did not lose heart. At any moment within the next few minutes the
  narrow entrance to the market might darken, and Ralph Warriner's owner thrust
  Ralph Warriner in&mdash;at some moment that would happen.</p>

  <p>Did Warriner still shuffle in the Moorish slippers as he walked? Charnock
  found himself asking the question with a curious light-heartedness. The
  negress was offered to him, and then the negro; he refused them with a
  gesture. He lent an ear to the rustling whispering traffic of the streets
  outside. He listened patiently, confidently, for the sound of a shuffling
  footstep to emerge, and grow distinct and more distinct. The Moor brought his
  greybeard to Charnock's corner. Charnock held his head aside and listened for
  the loose slap-slap of the slipper upon the mud. The Moor spoke, was
  importunate; Charnock waved him aside impatiently.</p>

  <p>But as he waved his arm he turned his head; and then he suddenly reached
  out a hand, while his heart leaped in his throat. "Ten dollars," he said. The
  Moor began to expatiate on the merits of his slave; he was still strong; he
  could carry heavy loads, and for far distances. Charnock was impatient to
  interrupt, to pay the price. When he had turned his head, suddenly, for an
  instant, he had looked straight into the greybeard's eyes&mdash;and they were
  the blue eyes which had stared into his&mdash;once, how many centuries
  ago?&mdash;through the window of a hansom cab in a noisy street of Plymouth.
  Charnock had no doubt. Other Moors had blue eyes, and in no other feature of
  this wizened, haggard creature but his eyes could he trace a resemblance to
  Ralph Warriner; but he had no doubt. All the intuitions of the last half-hour
  came to his aid. He remembered the door, the call to prayer. This was Ralph
  Warriner, and he had almost let him pass! Had he not turned by mere accident
  just at the one moment when the greybeard's eyes were raised, he would have
  lost his chance now and forever. Warriner would have perished in his
  servitude, would have dropped somewhere on the plain under a load too heavy,
  and lain there until nightfall brought the jackals.</p>

  <p>The thought took Charnock at the throat, left him struggling for his
  breath. So near had he been to failing when he must not fail! He began to
  fear at once that another purchaser might step in, while the Moor was still
  exaggerating his goods. Yet he must not interrupt; he must give no sign of
  anxiety lest he should awaken suspicion; he must bargain with extreme
  indifference while a fever burnt in all his blood.</p>

  <p>"Thirty dollars," the Moor proposed.</p>

  <p>Charnock shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. The Moor turned away;
  the slave followed the master. Charnock clenched his hands together under the
  folds of his sleeves to prevent them reaching out and clasping the man. The
  merchant walked slowly for a few yards. At the entrance of the market there
  was a sudden obscurity; a tall man blocked the way, entered, and stopped
  before the merchant and his slave. Charnock's heart died within him; but the
  man only laughed and passed on.</p>

  <p>Charnock felt all his muscles relax, as his suspense ended. For now surely
  the slave would be brought back. The merchant turned slowly; Warriner turned
  obediently behind him, and the obedience went to Charnock's heart. It spoke
  of a discipline too hideous. Slowly the owner returned to Charnock; it seemed
  that he would never speak.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five dollars," he said.</p>

  <p>With an effort Charnock mastered his face and controlled his body.
  "Twenty," he returned, and spoke of the slave's age, and how little need he
  had of him. He heard the newcomer across the market haggling over the negro
  from Timbuctoo. And at last,&mdash;at last the word was spoken, the man he
  had come to search for was his, and his inalienably, so long as he remained
  in any corner of Morocco.</p>

  <p>Charnock paid the money; he did not so much as glance again at his slave.
  He rose from his seat. "Follow me," he said to Warriner in Moghrebbin; and
  one behind the other, Miranda's lover and Miranda's husband, master and
  slave, passed out of the market and down the street towards the gate of
  Mequinez.</p><hr><br>

  <h3>CHARNOCK, LIKE THE TAXIDERMIST, FINDS<br>
  WARRINER ANYTHING BUT A COMFORTABLE COMPANION</h3><br>

  <p class="first">ON the way Charnock stopped at the <i>fondak</i> where Hamet
  slept, and bade the lad saddle the mules and bring them out of the town.
  Hamet looked surprised, for nightfall was an ill time to start upon a journey
  near the country of the Lemur tribes, but he was accustomed to obey.
  Charnock's new slave did not even show surprise. Leaving Hamet to follow him,
  Charnock passed through the gate. He dreaded to remain in the town lest by
  some misfortune he might lose his slave; and, besides, a nausea for its
  smells and its dirt began to gain upon him. He walked down the slope of the
  hill to the olive trees and the mossy turf. Lepers, of an unimaginable
  aspect, dragged by the side of the beaten track and begged; robbers, who for
  their crimes had had their eyes burnt out, kept pace with him, their eyelids
  closed upon red and empty sockets; dead horses, mules, and camels were
  scattered by the way, their carcases half devoured; everywhere were ruins,
  and things decaying and things decayed; and over all was a sky of unbroken
  cloud, and a chill lugubrious light.</p>

  <p>Charnock observed his surroundings with newly-opened eyes and hurried on
  till he reached the olives. Then he stopped and turned to watch for Hamet's
  coming. He turned a trifle suddenly and his slave instinctively shrank away
  and stood submissive and mute, stilled by a long companionship with despair.
  And this was a captain of Her Majesty's Artillery, who had sailed his yacht
  in and out of Gibraltar Bay!</p>

  <p>"My God, how you must have suffered!" cried Charnock, and he spoke in the
  English tongue.</p>

  <p>Warriner raised a dazed, half-witted face. "Say that again," he said
  slowly, and he spoke in Arabic.</p>

  <p>"My God, how you must have suffered!"</p>

  <p>Warriner listened with one forefinger uplifted; he moved his finger
  backwards and forwards sawing the air. "Yes," he answered, and this time in
  English; but his mouth was awkward and the English came rustily from his
  tongue. "Yes, it has been a hell of a time."</p>

  <p>He spoke in a quite expressionless voice. But whether it was that the
  forgotten sound of the tongue he used awoke in his dim mind faint
  associations and a glimmer of memories, of a sudden he dropped upon the turf
  amidst the olive trees and, burying his face in the moss, sobbed violently
  like a child.</p>

  <p>Charnock let him lie there until he saw Hamet leading the mules down the
  beaten way from the town-gates. Then he bent down and touched Warriner on the
  shoulder. "Here is my servant&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;my servant."</p>

  <p>The white man's pride answered the summons. Warriner got quickly to his
  feet and drew a ragged sleeve across his face. Then he looked round between
  the withered olives at that grey cruel ruin of a city looming through the
  falling desolate light, and shivered. His eyes lighted upon Hamet, and
  suddenly opened wide. "Those mules," he said almost fiercely. "They are
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Let us ride! O dear God, let us ride!" And until Hamet reached them, his
  head darted this way and that, while his eyes searched the trees. "Mind, you
  bought me," he said. "I belong to you; to no one else. How far from here to
  the sea?"</p>

  <p>"Nine days."</p>

  <p>"Nine days," and he counted them over on his fingers.</p>

  <p>Hamet brought up the mules. Charnock unrolled a burnous and a turban.
  Warriner plucked off his rags and put on the dress. Then the three men rode
  out between the olive trees, past the outer rampart of breached walls, into
  the open plain.</p>

  <p>"Shall we camp?" said Charnock.</p>

  <p>Warriner cast a look across his shoulder. Mequinez was still visible, a
  greyer blot upon the grey hillside. "No," said he.</p>

  <p>They rode forward over carpets of flowers, between the hills. The light
  fell; the marigolds paled beneath their mules' feet; the gentians became any
  flower of a light hue. At last a toothed savage screen of rock moved across
  Mequinez.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Warriner. He tumbled rather than dismounted from his mule,
  stretched his limbs out upon the grass, and in a moment was asleep. Hamet
  gathered a bundle of leaves from a dwarf palm tree and a few sticks, lit a
  fire, and cooked their supper. Charnock woke Warriner, who ate his meal and
  slept again; and all that night, with a Mouser pistol in his hand, Charnock
  sat by his side and guarded him.</p>

  <p>The next morning they started betimes; they passed a caravan, farther on a
  tent-village, and towards evening, from the shoulder of a hill they looked
  down upon the vast plain of the Sebou. Level as a sea it stretched away until
  the distinct colours of its flower-patches merged into one soft blue.</p>

  <p>"Eight days," said Warriner; and that night, as last night, he asked no
  questions of Charnock, but ate his supper and so slept; and that night again
  Charnock sat by his side and guarded him.</p>

  <p>But the next morning Warriner for the first time began to evince some
  curiosity as to his rescue and the man who had rescued him. The two men had
  just bathed in a little stream which ran tinkling through the grass beside
  their camp. Warriner was kneeling upon the bank of the stream and
  contemplating himself in the clear mirror of its water, when he said to
  Charnock: "How in the world did you know me?"</p>

  <p>"By your eyes."</p>

  <p>"We are not strangers, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I hailed you from a hansom cab once outside Lloyd's bank in Plymouth. You
  expressed an amiable wish that I should sit in that cab and rot away in my
  boots. Lucky for you I didn't!"</p>

  <p>"You were the man who jammed his finger? I remember; I thought you had got
  a warrant in your pocket. By the way," and he lifted his head quickly, "you
  never, I suppose, came across a man called Wilbraham?"</p>

  <p>"Ambrose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; when did you come across him?"</p>

  <p>"He was blackmailing your wife."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my wife," said Warriner, suddenly, as though it had only just
  occurred to him that he had a wife. He turned his head and looked curiously
  to Charnock, who was scrubbing himself dry some yards behind him. "So you
  know my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Warriner again examined his face in the stream. "I think I might
  walk straight up from the Ragged Staff," said he, wagging his grey beard,
  "and shake hands with the Governor of Gibraltar and no one be a penny the
  wiser." Then he paused. "So you know Wilbraham," he said slowly, and paused
  again. "So you know my wife too;" and the pair went to their breakfast.</p>

  <p>Warriner walked in front of Charnock, and the latter could not but notice
  how within these two days his companion had changed. His back was losing its
  timid differential curve; there was less of a slink in his walk; he no longer
  shrank when a loud word was addressed to him. Moreover, his curiosity
  increased, and while they were at breakfast he asked "How did you find
  me?"</p>

  <p>And that morning as they rode forwards over the marigolds and irises,
  Charnock told him of his first visit to Tangier and of Hassan Akbar. "So when
  I came again," he said with perhaps a little awkwardness and after a pause,
  "I had a clue, a slight one, but still a clue, and I followed it."</p>

  <p>"It was you who shouted through Fournier's shop-door, was it?" said
  Warriner. "That's the second time a cry of yours has fairly scared me. So you
  know Wilbraham," he added in a moment; "so you know my wife too."</p>

  <p>They halted at noon under a hedge of cactus, and Charnock, tired with his
  long vigils, covered his head and slept. Through the long afternoon, over
  pink and violet flowers, under a burning sun, they journeyed drowsily, with
  no conversation and no sound at all but the humming of the insects in the air
  and the whistle of birds and the brushing of their mules' feet through the
  grass. That evening they crossed the Sebou and camped a few yards from the
  river's bank in a most lucid air.</p>

  <p>It was after supper. Charnock was lying upon his back, his head resting
  upon his arms, and his eyes upturned to the throbbing stars and the rich
  violet sky. Warriner squatted cross-legged beside a dying fire, and now and
  then, as a flame spirted up, he cast a curious glance towards Charnock.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been searching?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two years," replied Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The question was shot at him, in a sharp challenging voice. Charnock did
  not move from his position; he lay resting on that vast plain under the fresh
  night sky and the kindly stars; but he was some little while silent before he
  answered, "Your wife asked me to come."</p>

  <p>Warriner nodded his head thoughtfully, but said no more. That night
  Charnock did not keep watch, for they were across the Sebou and out of the
  perilous country. The next morning they rode on towards Alkasar with few
  words between them. Only Charnock noticed that Warriner was continually
  glancing at him with a certain furtiveness, and it seemed with a certain
  ill-will. Charnock grew restless under this surveillance: he resented it; it
  made him vaguely uneasy.</p>

  <p>They rode with no shadows to console them until the afternoon brought the
  clouds over the top of the Atlas. Towards evening they saw far ahead of them
  the town of Alkasar amongst its gardens of orange trees and olives.</p>

  <p>"We shall not reach it to-night," said Charnock, looking up at the
  sky.</p>

  <p>"No, thank God," answered Warriner, fervently. "No towns for me! What if
  it does rain?"</p>

  <p>So again they camped in the open, under a solitary wild fig tree, and the
  rain held off. They talked indifferently upon this subject and that,
  speculated upon news of Europe, and Charnock heard something of Warriner's
  comings and goings, his sufferings and adventures. But the talk was forced,
  and though now and again Wilbraham's name, and now and again Miranda's,
  recurred, it died altogether away.</p>

  <p>Warriner broke it suddenly. "You are in love with my wife," he said.</p>

  <p>Charnock started up on his elbow. "What the devil has that got to do with
  you?" he asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>The two men eyed one another across the leaping flames of the fire. "Well,
  you have a right to put it that way, no doubt," said Warriner.</p>

  <p>Charnock sank down again. He felt resentment throbbing hot within him. He
  was very glad that there were only five more days during which he and
  Warriner must travel together alone, and during which he must keep ward over
  the man he had rescued.</p>

  <p>But the next day was one of peace. The mere proximity of a Moorish town
  had terrors for Warriner. His eyes turned ever towards it, scared and
  frightened. His very body shrank and took on a servile air. Besides, it
  rained.</p>

  <p>"We might sleep in Alkasar. There is a Jew I stayed with coming up; you
  will be safe there," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"I would sooner shiver to death here," replied Warriner, and they skirted
  the town.</p>

  <p>But a little distance from the gates Charnock called a halt, and taking
  Hamet and a mule he went up into the town. He sought out his Jew, and bought
  a tent, which he packed upon the mule, and so returned to where Warriner
  crouched and hid amongst the orange trees. Beyond Alkasar they passed through
  a long stretch of stubble, whence acres of wheat had been garnered, and at
  night the two men sat in the opening of their tent, while the lad Hamet drew
  weird melancholy from his pipe.</p>

  <p>Warriner was silent; he was evidently turning over some thought in his
  mind, and his mind, rusted by his servitude, worked very slowly. A man of
  great vindictiveness and jealousy, he was not grateful for his rescue; but he
  was brooding over the motives which had induced Charnock to come in search of
  him, and which had persuaded Miranda to send him in search. Warriner had
  never cared for his wife, but his wife had never till now given him any cause
  for jealousy, and out of his present jealousy there sprang and grew in his
  half-crazy and disordered mind a quite fictitious passion.</p>

  <p>He revealed something of it the next morning to Charnock. For after he had
  waked up and yawned, after he had watched for a moment the busy shadow of
  Hamet upon the tent-wall and heard the light crackle of the breakfast fire,
  he roused Charnock with a shake of the shoulder and resumed the conversation
  at the point where it had been broken off when they sat by the camp-fire.</p>

  <p>"But I'll tell you a question which has to do with me, Charnock," he said.
  "Is my wife in love with you?"</p>

  <p>"You damned blackguard!" cried Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" said Warriner, with a chuckle. "That's answer enough."</p>

  <p>"It's no answer at all!" exclaimed Charnock, hotly, and he sat up amongst
  his blankets and took refuge in subterfuges. "If what you say were true, is
  it likely that your wife would have asked me to find you out and bring you
  back?"</p>

  <p>"That's the very point I have been considering," returned Warriner; "and I
  think it uncommon likely. Women have all sorts of underground scruples which
  it's difficult for a man to get upside with, and I can imagine a woman would
  send off her fancy man on this particular business as a kind of set-off and
  compensation. See?"</p>

  <p>Charnock dared not trust himself to answer. He got up and walked to the
  door of the tent, unfastened the flap, and let the sunlight in.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing!" continued Warriner, "I never took much account of my wife.
  She was a bit too stately for me. It was just as though someone played
  symphonies to you all day when you hankered after music of the music-hall
  type. But somehow,&mdash;I suppose it's seeing you doing the heroic and all
  for her, don't you know?&mdash;somehow I am getting very fond of her."</p>

  <p>Charnock seemed to have heard not a single word. He stood at the door of
  the tent, looking indifferently this way and that. His silence spurred
  Warriner to continue. "I tell you what, Charnock," he said, "you had better
  run straight with me. You'll find out your mistake if you don't. I'll tell
  you something more: you had better let me find when I get back to Ronda that
  you have run straight with me." He saw Charnock suddenly look round the angle
  of the tent and then shade his eyes with his hand. It seemed impossible to
  provoke him in any way. "Mind, I don't say that I shall take it much to
  heart, if the affair has stopped where you say it has." Charnock had said not
  a word about the matter, as Warriner was well aware. "No," he continued, "on
  the contrary; for no harm's actually done, you say, and my wife steps down
  from her pedestal on to my level. Understand, sonny?&mdash;What are you up
  to? Here, I say."</p>

  <p>Charnock had stridden back into the tent. He stooped over Warriner and
  roughly plucked him up from the ground. "Stand up, will you!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Here, I say," protested Warriner, rather feebly; "you might be speaking
  to a dog."</p>

  <p>"I wish I was."</p>

  <p>At that Warriner turned. The two men's faces were convulsed with passion;
  hatred looked out from Warriner's eyes and saw its image in Charnock's.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the tent," said Charnock, and taking Warriner by the shoulder,
  he threw rather than pushed him out.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's that?" and he pointed an arm towards the east.</p>

  <p>"That's a caravan."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, a caravan. Perhaps you have forgotten what you said to me
  outside the walls of Mequinez. You belong to me, you remember. You're mine; I
  bought you, and I can sell you if I choose."</p>

  <p>"By God, you wouldn't do that!" cried Warriner. His years of slavery
  rushed back on him. He saw himself again tramping, under the sun, with a load
  upon his back through the sand towards Algiers, over the hills to the Sus
  country; he heard again the whistle of a stick through the air, heard its
  thud as it fell upon his body, and felt the blow. "My God, you couldn't do
  that!" And seeing Charnock towering above him, his face hard, his eyes
  gloomy, he clung to his arm. "Charnock, old man! You wouldn't, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You'll fetch half a dozen copper <i>flouss</i>" said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Charnock, I apologise. See, old man, see? I am sorry; you hear
  that, don't you? Yes, I'm sorry. It's my cursed tongue."</p>

  <p>Charnock shook him off. "We left your rags behind, I believe, so you can
  keep those clothes. The caravan will pass us in an hour." Then Warriner fell
  to prayers, and flamed up in anger and curses and died down again to
  whimpering. All the while Charnock stood over him silent and contemptuous.
  There was no doubt possible he meant to carry out his threat. Warriner burst
  out in a flood of imprecations, and Moorish imprecations, for they came most
  readily to his tongue. He called on God to burn Charnock's great-grandmother,
  and then in an instant he became very cunning and calm.</p>

  <p>"And what sort of a face will you show to Miranda," he said smoothly,
  "when you get back to Ronda? You have forgotten that."</p>

  <p>Charnock had forgotten it; in his sudden access of passion he had clean
  forgotten it. Warriner wiped the sweat from his face; he did not need to look
  at Charnock to be assured that at this moment he was the master. He stuck his
  legs apart and rested his hands upon his hips. "You weren't quite playing the
  game, eh, Charnock?" he said easily. "Do you think you were quite playing the
  game?"</p>

  <p>From that moment Warriner was master, and he was not inclined to leave
  Charnock ignorant upon that point. Jealousy burnt within him. His mind was
  unstable. A quite fictitious passion for his wife, for whom he had never
  cared, and of whom he certainly would very quickly tire, was kindled by his
  jealousy; and he left no word unspoken which could possibly wound his
  deliverer. Charnock bitterly realised the false position into which he had
  allowed passion to lead him; and for the future he held his peace.</p>

  <p>"Only one more day," he said with relief, as they saw the hills behind
  Tangier.</p>

  <p>"And what then, Charnock?" said Warriner. "What then?"</p>

  <p>What then, indeed? Charnock debated that question during the long night,
  the last night he was to spend under canvas in company with Ralph Warriner.
  Sometime to-morrow they would see the minarets of Tangier&mdash;to-morrow
  evening they would ride down across the Sôk and sleep within the town. What
  then? Passion was raw in these two men. It was a clear night; an African moon
  sailed the sky, and the interior of the tent was bright. Warriner lay
  motionless, a foot or two away, wrapped in his dark coverings, and Charnock
  was conscious of a fierce thrill of joy when he remembered Miranda's
  confession that she had no love left for her husband. He did not attempt to
  repress it; he hugged the recollection to his heart. All at once Warriner
  began softly to whistle a tune; it was the tune which he had whistled that
  morning at the gates of Tangier cemetery, it was the tune which Miranda had
  hummed over absently in the little parlour at Ronda, and which had given
  Charnock the clue&mdash;and because of the clue Warriner was again whistling
  the tune in the same tent with himself&mdash;a day's march from Tangier.</p>

  <p>Charnock began hotly to regret that he had ever heard it, that he had
  charged Hamet to repeat it, and that so he had fixed it in his mind. He
  kicked over on his rugs, and he heard Warriner speak.</p>

  <p>"You are awake, are you? I say, Charnock," he asked smoothly, "did Miranda
  show you the graveyard in Gib? That was my youngster, understand?&mdash;mine
  and Miranda's."</p>

  <p>Charnock clenched his teeth, clenched his hand, and straightened his
  muscles out through all his body, that he might give no sign of what he
  felt.</p>

  <p>"Bone of my bone," continued Warriner, in a silky, drawling voice, "flesh
  of my flesh,&mdash;and Miranda's." Perhaps some deep breath drawn with a hiss
  through the teeth assured Warriner that his speech was not spoken in vain;
  for he laughed softly and hatefully to himself.</p>

  <p>Charnock lay quite still, but every vein in his body was throbbing. He had
  one thought only to relieve him. Warriner had said the last uttermost word of
  provocation; he had fashioned it out of the dust of his child, when but for
  that child he would still be a slave; and out of the wifehood of Miranda,
  when but for Miranda Charnock would never have come in search of him.
  <i>Rupert Warriner, aged two</i>. The gravestone, the boy looking out between
  the lattices, was very visible to Charnock at that moment. He was in the mind
  to give Warriner an account of how and why he was brought to see it; but he
  held his peace, sure that whatever gibes or stings Warriner might dispense in
  the future, they would be trifling and inconsiderable compared with this
  monumental provocation.</p>

  <p>He was wrong; Warriner's malice had yet another resource. Seeing that
  Charnock neither answered him nor moved, he got up from his couch. Charnock
  saw him rummaging amongst the baggage, hopping about the tent in the pale
  moonlight; the shadow of his beard wagged upon the tent-wall, and all the
  while he chuckled and whispered to himself. Charnock watched his fantastic
  movements and took them together with the man's fantastic words, and it
  occurred to him then for the first time to ask whether Warriner's mind had
  suffered with his body. He had come to this point of his reflections when
  Warriner, stooping over a bundle, found whatever it was for which he
  searched. Charnock heard a light snick, like the cocking of a pistol, only
  not so loud. Then Warriner hopped back to Charnock's side, knelt down and
  thrust something into the palm of Charnock's hand. Charnock's fingers closed
  on it instinctively and gripped it hard; for this something was the handle of
  a knife and the blade was open.</p>

  <p>"There!" said Warriner. "You have to protect me. This is the last night,
  so I give you the knife to protect me with."</p>

  <p>He hopped back to his rugs, twittering with pleasure; and turning his face
  once more towards Charnock, while Charnock lay with the open knife in his
  hand, he resumed, "My boy, Charnock&mdash;mine and Miranda's&mdash;mine and
  Miranda's."</p>

  <p>The next evening they rode over the cobblestones of Tangier and halted at
  M. Fournier's shop.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <h3>COMPLETES THE JOURNEYINGS OF THIS INCONGRUOUS COUPLE</h3><br>

  <p class="first">M. FOURNIER received the wanderers with an exuberant
  welcome. He fell upon Warriner's neck, patted him, and wept over him for joy
  at his return and for grief at his aged and altered looks. Then he grasped
  Charnock with both hands. "The deliverer," he cried, "the friend so
  noble!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Warriner, pleasantly; "<i>ce bon</i> Charnock, he loves my
  wife."</p>

  <p>Within half-an-hour the two travellers were shaved and clothed in European
  dress.</p>

  <p>"Would anyone know me?" asked Warriner.</p>

  <p>"My poor friend, I am afraid not," answered Fournier, and Warriner seemed
  very well pleased with the answer.</p>

  <p>"Then we will go and dine, really and properly dine, at a hotel on
  champagne wine," said he.</p>

  <p>They dined at a window which looked out across the Straits, and all
  through that dinner Warriner's face darkened and darkened and his gaze was
  sombrely fixed towards Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans?" asked Fournier.</p>

  <p>"The first thing I propose to do is to walk up to the cemetery and
  astonish my friend Hassan Akbar."</p>

  <p>"You will not find him. The Basha thought it wise to keep him safe in
  prison until you were found."</p>

  <p>"He has been there two years then?" said Warriner. "He had no friends.
  Then he is dead?" For the Moorish authorities do not feed the prisoners in
  the Kasbah.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier blushed. "No, he is not dead. He would have starved,
  but,&mdash;you will forgive it, my friend? After all he had no great reason
  to like you,&mdash;I sent him food myself every day,&mdash;not very much, but
  enough," stammered M. Fournier, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Warriner waved his hand. "It is a small thing; yes, I forgive you."</p>

  <p>"And he may go free?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? He will not catch me again."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's face brightened with admiration.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you are great, truly great," he exclaimed; "my friend, you are
  <i>magnanime!</i> Now tell me what you will do."</p>

  <p>M. Fournier's magnanimous friend replied. "The boat crosses to Algeciras
  to-morrow. I shall go up to Ronda. And you?" he asked, turning to
  Charnock.</p>

  <p>"I shall go with you," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ce bon</i> Charnock," said Warriner, with a smile. "He loves my
  wife."</p>

  <p>"But afterwards?" Fournier hurried to interpose. "Will you stay at
  Ronda?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Warriner's eyes strained out across the water to where the topmost ridge
  of Gibraltar rose against the evening sky. Since his rescue two thoughts had
  divided and made a conflict in his mind; one was his jealousy of Charnock,
  his unreal hot-house affection for Miranda; the other had been represented by
  his vague questions and statements about Wilbraham. He was now to speak more
  clearly, for as he looked over to the Rock, Wilbraham was uppermost in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"You did not know Wilbraham," he resumed. "Charnock did, <i>ce bon</i>
  Charnock. I have a little account to settle with Wilbraham, a little account
  of some standing, and now there's a new item to the bill. The scullion!
  Imagine it, Fournier. He blackmailed my wife; blackmailed Miranda! Do you
  understand?" he cried feverishly. "Miranda! You know her, Charnock. Fournier,
  how often have I spoken of her to you? Miranda!" And words failed him, so
  inconceivable was the thought that any man should bring himself to do any
  wrong to his Miranda.</p>

  <p>M. Fournier stared. As he had once told Mrs. Warriner, Ralph had spoken to
  him of Miranda; but it had not been with the startling enthusiasm which at
  present he evinced.</p>

  <p>"I shall settle my accounts with Wilbraham first," continued Warriner,
  "after I have seen Miranda. Did you know it was Wilbraham who sold the plans
  of the Daventry gun?"</p>

  <p>"Was it?" exclaimed Charnock.</p>

  <p>"It was," and the three men drew their chairs closer together. "Wilbraham
  was a moneylender's tout at Gib. I had borrowed money and renewed; I borrowed
  again, and again renewed. You see," he argued in excuse, "I would not touch a
  penny of my wife's estate; that of course was sacred. It was
  Miranda's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And settled upon Miranda," Charnock could not refrain from
  interposing.</p>

  <p>"Don't you call my wife by her christian name, else you and I will
  quarrel," exclaimed Warriner, banging his fist violently upon the table, and
  M. Fournier anxiously signed to Charnock to be silent.</p>

  <p>"It was a slip," said Fournier, and soothingly he patted Warriner on the
  shoulder. "Here! have one or two fine champagne, eh? Now go on; we are all of
  us good friends. You borrowed twice from Wilbraham and did not pay; you would
  not, of course. Well?"</p>

  <p>"I tried to borrow a third time," continued Warriner; "but Wilbraham
  refused unless I could offer him good security. He himself suggested the
  plans of the Daventry gun. He swore most solemnly that he would not use them;
  he would keep them as a security for three weeks, and I wanted his money. I
  had debts to pay, debts to my brother officers, and I agreed. He lent me the
  money; I gave him the plans, and he went off to Paris and sold them. I
  received a hint one afternoon that the mechanism of the gun was known, and I
  ran out of Gibraltar that evening. So, you see, I have an account with him;
  and it grows and grows and grows upon me each time that I see that." He
  pointed a shaking finger to where the sharp ridge of Gibraltar cut the
  evening sky. "Now that I can go where I will and no one will know me, I will
  get the account paid, and cut a receipt in full with a knife right across
  Wilbraham's face."</p>

  <p>His voice rose and quavered with a feverish excitement, his eyes shone and
  glittered; it seemed to Charnock there was madness in them. M. Fournier's
  eyes met his and they exchanged glances, so M. Fournier, who was engaged in
  assiduously soothing Warriner, shared the conjecture. Indeed, as M. Fournier
  took his leave, he said privately to Charnock: "My poor friend! what will be
  the end of it for him? His wife does not like him and he will follow this
  Wilbraham, and he is not himself."</p>

  <p>Charnock was lighting his candle at the hall-table.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, slowly. "There is his wife, there is Wilbraham, there is
  himself; what is to be the end of it all?"</p>

  <p>He went up the stairs to his room. His room communicated with Warriner's,
  and taking the key from the door, he left the door unlocked. More than once
  as he tossed upon his bed vainly reiterating the question, what was to be the
  end, he heard the latch of the door click, he saw the door open slowly, he
  saw a head come cautiously through the opening; and then, as he lay still,
  Warriner came hopping across the room to his bed. Warriner came to assure
  himself that Charnock had not stolen a march upon him during the night; he
  was possessed by a crazy fear lest Charnock should see Miranda before
  himself.</p>

  <p>On the following afternoon they crossed together to Algeciras, through a
  rough sea in a strong wind.</p>

  <p>"It's the Levanter," said Warriner; "there'll be three days of it." He
  looked earnestly at Gibraltar as the boat turned into the bay. "Wilbraham,
  Wilbraham," he muttered in a voice of anticipation. Then he turned to
  Charnock. "Mind, we go up to Ronda together! We shall have to stay the night
  at Algeciras. Mind, you are not to charter a special and go up ahead while I
  am asleep."</p>

  <p>Charnock was sorely tempted to secure an engine, as he could have done,
  but Miranda had asked to see him "once when he brought Ralph back," and so
  the next morning they travelled together.</p>

  <p>At noon Charnock saw again the walnut door encrusted with the copper
  nails, and Warriner was already hammering upon it with his stick. The moment
  it was opened he rushed through without a word, thrusting the servant
  aside.</p>

  <p>Charnock followed him, but though he followed he had the advantage, for
  while Warriner gazed about the patio into which for the first time he
  entered, Charnock ran across to the little room in which Miranda was wont to
  sit. He opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Empty," said Warriner, from behind his shoulder, and he pushed past
  Charnock into the room. From the balcony above them Jane Holt spoke. She
  spoke to Charnock as she ran down the stair.</p>

  <p>"It's you at last! Miranda is at Gibraltar. She expected to hear of you,
  and thought she would hear more quickly there. She has been ill, besides; she
  needed doctors."</p>

  <p>"Ill?" exclaimed Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" asked Miss Holt, glancing across Charnock's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ralph."</p>

  <p>"Ralph!" cried out Miss Holt. "But he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!"</p>

  <p>They followed Warriner into the room, and Charnock closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?" he asked. "I went to find him."</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, utterly bewildered. "It seems strange; but Miranda is
  very secret. A little unkind, perhaps," and then her voice went up almost in
  a scream as Warriner turned towards her. "Ralph! Is that Ralph?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, it's Ralph," said Warriner, and all the time he spoke, he
  trotted and hopped and danced about the room. "Ralph Warriner, to be sure; a
  little bit aged, eh, Jane Holt? Little bit musty? Been lyin' too long in the
  churchyard at Scilly&mdash;bound to alter your looks that,&mdash;what?" He
  skipped over to the writing table and began with a seeming aimlessness to
  pull out the drawers. "Where's Miranda? Does she know her lovin' husband's
  here? Why don't she come? Tell me that, Jane Holt!" He made a quick, and to
  Charnock an unintelligible, movement at the writing table, shut up a drawer
  with a bang, and the next moment he had a hand tight upon Jane Holt's wrist.
  "Where's Miranda? Quick!" and he shook her arm fiercely, but with a sly look
  towards Charnock; his other hand he thrust into his pocket. Charnock just got
  a glimpse of a sheet of paper clenched in the fist. Warriner withdrew his
  hand from his pocket empty. He had stolen something from the writing drawer.
  But what it was Charnock could not guess, nor did he think it wise, in view
  of Warriner's excitement, to ask.</p>

  <p>"Miranda's at Gibraltar," said Miss Holt, quite alarmed by the man's
  extravagance. "I told you, she is ill."</p>

  <p>Warriner waited to hear no more. He dropped her arm. "At Gibraltar," he
  said, and ran out of the room across the patio. Charnock followed him
  immediately. "He must not go alone," he cried over his shoulder to Miss Holt,
  but the excuse was only half of his motive. Passion, resentment,
  jealousy,&mdash;these too ordered him and he obeyed.</p>

  <p>Charnock came up with Warriner at the railway station. The train did not
  leave Ronda until three, as Charnock might have known and so behaved with
  dignity before Miss Holt; but he was beyond the power of argument or
  reflection. He hurried after Warriner and caught him up, and during the two
  hours of waiting, the two men kept watch and ward upon each other. Together
  they walked to the hotel, they lunched at the same table, they returned side
  by side to the station, and seated themselves side by side in the same
  carriage of the train. The train which takes four hours to climb to Ronda
  runs down that long slope of a hundred miles in two hours. Charnock and
  Warriner took their seats in a <i>coupé</i> at the end of the last carriage;
  they rushed suddenly into the dark straight tunnels, and saw the mouths by
  which they had entered as round O's of light which contracted and contracted
  until a mere pin's-point of sunshine was visible far away, and then suddenly
  they were out again in the daylight.</p>

  <p>There were certain landmarks with which Charnock was familiar,&mdash;a
  precipitous gorge upon the right, an underground river which flooded out from
  a hillside upon the left, a white town far away upon a green slope like a
  flock of sheep herded together, and finally the glades of the cork forest
  with the gleam of its stripped tree-trunks. The train drew up at Algeciras a
  few minutes after five.</p>

  <p>Charnock and Warriner were met with the statement that the Levanter of
  yesterday had increased in force, and by the order of the harbour-master the
  port of Algeciras was closed. It was impossible to make the passage to
  Gibraltar&mdash;and Miranda was ill. She had needed doctors, Jane Holt had
  said. Charnock's fears exaggerated the malady; she might be dying; she might
  die while he and Warriner waited at Algeciras for the sea to subside. "We
  must reach Gibraltar to-night," he cried.</p>

  <p>"And before gunfire," added Warriner. "But how?"</p>

  <p>Charnock went straight to the office of the manager of the line. The
  manager greeted him with warmth. "But, man, where have you been these two
  years?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There's a station at San Roque half-way round the bay," said Charnock. "I
  must get into Gibraltar to-night. If I can have a special to San Roque, I
  might drive the last nine miles."</p>

  <p>Gibraltar is before everything a fortress, and the gates of that fortress
  are closed for the night at gunfire, and opened again for the day at gunfire
  in the morning.</p>

  <p>"You will never do it," said the manager. "The gun goes off at seven."</p>

  <p>"What's the month?" cried Warriner.</p>

  <p>"July," answered the manager, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"And the day of July?"</p>

  <p>"The fifth."</p>

  <p>"Good," cried Warriner. "You are wrong; on the fifth of July the gun goes
  off at eight&mdash;from the fifth of July to the thirty-first of August."</p>

  <p>The manager uncoupled one carriage and the engine, coupled them together
  and switched them on to the up-line. Meanwhile Charnock telegraphed to the
  station-master at San Roque, to have a carriage in readiness; but time was
  occupied, and it was six o'clock before the engine steamed into San
  Roque.</p>

  <p>San Roque is a wayside station; the village lies a mile away, hidden
  behind a hill. Charnock and Warriner alighted amongst fields and thickets of
  trees, but nowhere was there a house visible, and worst of all, there was no
  carriage in the lane outside the station. The station-master had ordered one,
  and no doubt one would arrive. He counselled patience.</p>

  <p>For half-an-hour the incongruous companions, united by a common passion
  and a mutual hate, kicked their heels upon the lonely platform of San Roque.
  Then at last a crazy, battered, creaking diligence, drawn by six
  broken-kneed, sore-backed mules, cantered up to the station with a driver and
  a boy upon the box, whooping exhortations to the mules with the full power of
  their lungs.</p>

  <p>Charnock and Warriner sprang up into the hooded seat behind the box, the
  driver turned his mules, and the diligence went off at a canter, along an
  unmade track across the fields.</p>

  <p>It was now close upon a quarter to seven, and nine miles lay between San
  Roque and the gates of Gibraltar. Moreover, there was no road for the first
  part of the journey, merely this unmade track across the fields. The two men
  urged on the driver with open-handed promises; the driver screamed and
  shouted at his mules: "Hi! mules, here's a bull after you!" He counterfeited
  the barking of dogs; but the mules were accustomed to his threats and
  exhortations; they knew there were no dogs at their heels, and they kept to
  their regular canter.</p>

  <p>Charnock longed for the fields to end and for the road to begin; and when
  the road did begin, he longed again for the fields. The road consisted of
  long lines of ruts, ruts which were almost trenches, ruts which had been
  baked hard by the summer suns. The mules stumbled amongst them, the diligence
  tossed and pitched and rolled like a boat in a heavy sea; Charnock and
  Warriner clung to their seats, while the driver continually looked round to
  see whether a wheel had slipped off from its axle. At times the boy would
  jump down from the box, and running forward with the whip in his hand, would
  beat the mules with the butt-end; the lash had long ceased to influence their
  movements.</p>

  <p>"The road's infernal," cried Warriner.</p>

  <p>"It will be when we get to the sea," replied the driver, and Charnock
  groaned in his distress. There was worse to come, and Miranda was ill.</p>

  <p>The diligence lurched between two clumps of juniper trees, swung round a
  wall, and instantly the wheels sank into soft sand. The huge, sheer landward
  face of Gibraltar Rock towered up before them as they looked across the mile
  of neutral ground, that flat neck of land between the Mediterranean and the
  Bay. They saw the Spanish frontier town of Linea; but to Linea the sand
  stretched in a broad golden curve, soft and dry, and through that curve of
  sand the wheels of the diligence had to plough. The mules were beaten
  onwards, but the Levanter blew dead in their teeth. The driver turned the
  diligence towards the sea, and drove with the water splashing over the
  wheels; there the sand bound, and the pace was faster.</p>

  <p>It was still, however, too slow; Gibraltar seemed still as far away. The
  travellers paid the driver, leaped from their seats, and ran over the soft
  clogging sand to Linea. They reached Linea. They passed the sentinel and the
  iron gates, they stood upon the neutral ground. They had but one more mile to
  traverse.</p>

  <p>A cab stood without the iron gates. They jumped into it and drove at a
  gallop across the level; but the gun was fired from the Rock, while they were
  still half-a-mile from the gate, and the cabman brought his horses to a
  standstill.</p>

  <p>"What now?" said Warriner.</p>

  <p>"We might get in," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"The keys are taken to the Governor. There would be trouble; there always
  is. I know there would be questions asked; it would not be safe. I might slip
  in when the gates are open, but now it would not be safe. And mind, Charnock,
  when you go in I go in too."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Warriner meant what he said, every word of it. For
  Miranda's sake Charnock could not risk Warriner's detection. They must remain
  outside Gibraltar for that night, even though during the night Miranda should
  die.</p>

  <p>"Can we sleep at Linea?" said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"No, Linea is a collection of workmen's houses and workmen's pot-houses."
  The two men made their supper at one of these latter, and for the rest of the
  night paced the neutral ground before Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>A scud of clouds darkened the sky, and one pile of cloud, darker than the
  rest, lowered stationary upon the summit of the Rock. All night the Levanter
  blew pitilessly cold across that unprotected neck of land between sea and
  sea. With their numbed hands in their pockets, and their coats buttoned to
  the throat, Charnock and Warriner, accustomed to the blaze of a Morocco sun,
  waited from nightfall until midnight, and from midnight through the biting,
  dreary hours till dawn.</p>

  <p>The gates were opened at three o'clock in the morning. Together the two
  men went through; they had still hours to wait before they could return to
  the hotel. They breakfasted together, and they let the time go by, for now
  that they were within reach of, almost within sight of, Miranda Warriner,
  they both began to hesitate. What was to be the end? They looked at one
  another across the table with that question speaking from their eyes. They
  walked down to the hotel and faced each other at the door, and the question
  was still repeated and still unanswered. They turned away together and
  strolled a few yards, and turned and came back again. This time Charnock
  entered the hotel. "Is Mrs. Warriner in?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The waiter replied, "Yes."</p>

  <p>Charnock drew a long breath. Surely if much had been amiss with her the
  waiter would have told them; but he said nothing, he merely led the way
  upstairs.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <h3>IN WHICH CHARNOCK ASTONISHES RALPH WARRINER</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE waiter threw open the door, the two men entered, and
  Warriner shut the door. Miranda rose from a chair and stood looking from
  Charnock to Warriner and back again from Warriner to Charnock; and as yet no
  word was spoken by anyone of them. Charnock had time to note, and grieve for,
  the pallor of her face and the purple hollows about her eyes. Then she moved
  forward for a step or two quite steadily; she murmured a name and the name
  was not Ralph; and then suddenly, without any warning, she fell to the ground
  between Charnock and her husband, and lay still and lifeless.</p>

  <p>"My God, she's dead!" whispered Warriner. "We should have sent word of our
  coming. We have killed her," and then he stopped. For Charnock was standing
  by the side of Miranda and talking down to her as she lay, in a low, soft,
  chiding voice.</p>

  <p>"Come," he was saying, "it's what you wished. You will be glad when you
  have time to think over it and understand. There is no reason why you
  should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This intimate talking with the lifeless woman came upon Warriner as
  something horrible. "Man, can't you see?" he whispered hoarsely. "She's dead,
  Miranda is. We have killed her, you and I."</p>

  <p>Charnock slowly turned his head towards Warriner and looked at him
  steadily with his eyebrows drawn down over his eyes. Somehow Warriner was
  frightened by that glance; he felt a chill creep down his spine; he was more
  frightened than even on that morning when Charnock threatened to sell him
  outside Alkasar. "She's dead, I tell you," he babbled, and so was silent.</p>

  <p>Charnock looked back to Miranda, sank upon one knee by her side, and
  bending his head down began to whisper to her exhortations, gentle reproaches
  at her lack of courage, and between his words he smiled at her as at a
  wayward child.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason to fear," the uncanny talk went on; "and it hurts us!
  You don't know how much. You might as well speak, not be like
  this&mdash;pretending." He reached over her and took her hand, cherished it
  in his own, and entwined his fingers with her fingers and then laughed, as
  though her fingers had responded to his own. "You are rather cruel, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Warriner moved uneasily. "Charnock, I tell you Miranda's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charnock flung his other arm across her body and crouched over it, glaring
  at Warriner like a beast about to spring.</p>

  <p>"And I tell you she's not, she's not, she's not!" he hissed out. "Dead!"
  and suddenly he lifted up Miranda's head, held it in the hollow of his arm
  and kissed the face upon the forehead and the lips. "Dead?" and he broke out
  into a laugh. "Is she? I'll show you. Come! Come!" He forced his disengaged
  arm underneath her waist, and putting all his strength into the swing lifted
  himself on to his feet, and lifted Miranda with him. "Now don't you see?"
  Warriner was standing, his mouth open, his eyes contracted; there was more
  than horror expressed in them, there was terror besides.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" cried Charnock, in a wild triumph. "Perhaps you are
  blind. Are you blind, Ralph Warriner?"</p>

  <p>He held Miranda supported against his shoulder, and swung her up and tried
  to set her dangling feet firm-planted on the ground; but her limbs gave, her
  head rolled upon his shoulder. He hitched her up again, her head fell back
  exposing the white column of her throat. The heavy masses of her hair broke
  from their fastenings, unrolled about her shoulders, and tumbled about his.
  He tried again to set her on her feet, and her head fell forward upon his
  breast, and her hair swept across his lips. "There, man," he cried, "she can
  stand.... Can a dead woman stand? Tell me that!" He held her so that she had
  the posture, the semblance, of one who stands, though all her weight was upon
  his arm. His laughter rose without any gradation to the pitch of a scream,
  sank without gradation to a hoarse cry. "Why, she can walk! Can a dead woman
  walk? See! See!" And suddenly he dropped his arm from her waist, and stood
  aside from her, holding her hand in his. Instantly her figure curved and
  broke. She swung round towards him upon the pivot of his hand, and as she
  swung she stumbled and fell. Charnock caught her before she reached the
  ground, lifted her up, strained her to his breast, and held her so. One deep
  sob broke from him, shook him, and left him trembling. He carried Miranda to
  a couch, and there gently laid her down. Gently he divided her hair back from
  her temples and her face; he crossed her hands upon her breast, watched her
  for a second as she lay, her dress soiled with the dust of his journeyings;
  and then he dropped on his knees by the couch, and with a set white face,
  with his eyelids shut tight upon his eyes, in a low, even voice he steadily
  blasphemed.</p>

  <p>Some time later a hand was laid upon his shoulder and a strange voice bade
  him rise. He stood up and looked at the stranger with a dazed expression like
  one who comes out of the dark into a lighted room. Warriner also was in the
  room. Charnock caught a word here and there; the stranger was speaking to
  him; Charnock gathered that the stranger was a doctor, and that Warriner had
  fetched him.</p>

  <p>"But she's dead," said Charnock, resentfully. "Why trouble her? she's
  dead." And looking down to Miranda, he saw that there was a faint flush of
  pink upon her cheeks, where all had been white before. "But you said she was
  dead," he said stupidly to Warriner, and as the doctor bent over her, it
  broke in upon him that she was in truth alive, that she had but swooned, and
  the shame of what he had done came home to him. "I was mad," he said, "I was
  mad."</p>

  <p>"Go," said the doctor, "both of you."</p>

  <p>"I can stay," said Warriner. "This is Mrs. Warriner; I am her husband,
  Ralph Warriner." The doctor looked up sharply. Warriner simply nodded his
  head. "Yes, yes," he said; "and this is Charnock. <i>Ce bon</i> Charnock. You
  see, he loves my wife."</p>

  <p>Warriner spoke slowly and in an inexpressive voice, as though he too was
  hardly aware of what he said. The conviction that Miranda was dead had come
  with equal force to both of these two men, and the knowledge that she was not
  brought an equal stupefaction. Warriner remained in the room; Charnock went
  outside and down the stairs.</p>

  <p>He came to his senses in the streets of Gibraltar, and looking backwards,
  seemed to himself to have lost them weeks ago somewhere between Mequinez and
  Alkasar, in a profitless rivalry for a woman who could not belong to him. In
  the present revulsion of his feelings he was conscious that he had lost all
  his enmity towards Warriner. He walked down to the landing-stage at the Mole.
  The Levanter had spent its force during the night; the sea had gone down; a
  steamer was dropping its anchor in the bay. Charnock was in two minds whether
  or no to cross the harbour to Algeciras, where Warriner and himself had left
  their traps the day before, gather together his belongings, and sail for
  England in that steamer. He had done all that he had been enjoined to do; he
  had brought Warriner back; he had even, as he had promised, paid the one last
  visit to Miranda. But,&mdash;but, he might be wanted, he pleaded to himself,
  and so undecided he wandered about the streets, and in the afternoon came
  back to the hotel.</p>

  <p>The waiter was watching for his return. Mrs. Warriner wished to speak with
  him. There was no sign of Warriner. Charnock mounted the stairs. There was no
  sign of Warriner within the sitting-room. Miranda was alone, and from the
  frank unembarrassed way with which she held out her hand, Charnock understood
  that she knew nothing of what had passed in the morning.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <h3>RELATES A SECOND MEETING BETWEEN CHARNOCK AND MIRANDA</h3><br>

  <p class="first">"I WAS afraid you had gone without my thanks," she said;
  "and thanks are the only coin I have to pay you with."</p>

  <p>"Surely there needs no payment."</p>

  <p>"I should have thanked you this morning; but your return overcame me, I
  had hoped and prayed so much for it."</p>

  <p>The scream of the P. and O.'s steam-whistle sounded through the room. They
  both turned instinctively to the window, they saw the last late boat-load
  reach the ship's side, and in a moment or so they heard the rattle of the
  anchor-chain.</p>

  <p>"And Ralph?" asked Charnock.</p>

  <p>Miranda pointed to the steamer. Already the white fan of water streamed
  away from its stern.</p>

  <p>"He has sailed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He could not stay here. His&mdash;" she paused for a second and then
  spoke the word boldly, "his crime was hushed up, but it is of course known
  here to a few, and all know that there is something. He told his name to the
  doctor. It was not safe for him to stay over this morning."</p>

  <p>"He has gone to England?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he will leave England immediately. He promised to write to me,
  so that I may know where he is."</p>

  <p>More of Warriner's interview with his wife, neither Charnock nor anyone
  ever knew. Whether he asked her to come with him and she refused, or whether,
  once he saw her and had speech with her, his fictitious passion died as
  quickly as it had grown&mdash;these are matters which Miranda kept locked
  within her secret memories. At this time indeed such questions did not at all
  occur to Charnock. As he watched the great steamer heading out of the bay,
  and understood that he must be taking the same path, he was filled with a
  great pity for the lonely woman at his side. The thought of her home up there
  in the Spanish hills and of her solitary, discontented companion came to him
  with a new and poignant sadness. Ronda was no longer a fitting shrine for her
  as his first fancies had styled it, but simply a strange place in a strange
  country.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go home to your own place, to your own people?" he
  suggested rather than asked.</p>

  <p>Miranda was silent for a while. "I have thought of it," she said at
  length; "I think too that I shall. At first, there was the disgrace, there
  was the pity&mdash;I could not have endured it; besides, there was Rupert.
  But&mdash;but&mdash;I think I shall."</p>

  <p>"I should," said Charnock, decidedly. "I should be glad, too, to know that
  you had made up your mind to that. I should be very glad to think that you
  were back at your own home."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, a little surprised at his earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I wasn't born to it," he replied disconnectedly; "but now and
  then I have stayed at manor-houses in the country; and such visits have
  always left an impression on me. I would have liked myself to have been born
  of the soil on which I lived, to have lived where my fathers and grandfathers
  lived and walked and laughed and suffered, in the same rooms, under the same
  trees, enjoying the associations which they made. Do you know, I don't think
  that that is a privilege lightly to be foregone." And for a while again they
  both were silent.</p>

  <p>Then Miranda turned suddenly and frankly towards him: "I should like so
  much to show you my home." She had said much the same on that first evening
  of their meeting in Lady Donnisthorpe's balcony, as they both surely
  remembered.</p>

  <p>"I should like much to see it," returned Charnock, gently; "but I am a
  busy man." Miranda coloured at the conventional excuse, as Charnock saw. "But
  it was kind of you to say that. I was glad to hear it," he added.</p>

  <p>It was not to the addition she replied, but to his first excuse. "As it
  is, you have lost two years. I have made you lose them."</p>

  <p>"Please!" he exclaimed. "You won't let that trouble you. Promise me! I am
  a young man; it would be a strange thing if I could not give two years to
  you. Believe me, Mrs. Warriner, when my time comes, and I turn my face to the
  wall, whatever may happen between now and then, I shall count those two years
  as the years for which I have most reason to be thankful."</p>

  <p>Miranda turned abruptly away from him and looked out of the window with
  intense curiosity at nothing whatever. Then she said in a low voice: "I hope
  that's true; I hope you mean it; I believe you do. I have been much troubled
  by an old theory of yours, that a woman was a brake on the wheel going up
  hill, and a whip in the driver's hand going down."</p>

  <p>"I will give you a new theory to replace the old," he answered. "There are
  always things to do, you know. Suppose that a man has cared for a woman, has
  set her always within his vision, has always worked for her, for a long
  while, and has at last come surely, against his will, to know that she was
  ... despicable, why then, perhaps he might have reason to be disheartened.
  But otherwise&mdash;well, he has things to do and memories to quicken him in
  the doing of them."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said simply. "I think what you say is true. I once met a
  man who found a woman to be despicable, and the world went very ill with
  him."</p>

  <p>It was of Major Wilbraham she was thinking, who had more than once written
  to Miranda during these two years, and whose last letter she imagined to be
  lying then in a drawer of her writing-table at Ronda.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <h3>A MIST IN THE CHANNEL ENDS, AS IT BEGAN, THE BOOK</h3><br>

  <p class="first">BUT that letter was in Ralph Warriner's pocket, as he walked
  the deck of the P. and O. It was dated from a hotel at Dartmouth, whence,
  said the Major, he was starting on a little cruise westwards in the company
  of a young gentleman from Oxford who owned a competence and a yacht. The
  Major would be back at Dartmouth in some six weeks' time and hoped, for Mrs.
  Warriner's sake, that he would find a registered letter awaiting him. The
  Major was still upon his cruise, as Ralph Warriner was assured from the
  recent date of the letter.</p>

  <p>Warriner disembarked at Plymouth and took train to Dartmouth, where he
  learned the name of the yacht by merely asking at the hotel. He tried to hire
  a steam launch, for sooner or later in one of the harbours he would be sure
  to come up with Wilbraham, if he only kept a sharp eye; but steam launches
  are difficult to hire at this season of the year, and in the end he had to
  content himself with chartering a ten-ton cutter. He engaged one hand, by
  whose testimony the history of Ralph's pursuit came to be known, and sailed
  out of Dartmouth to the west. He sailed out in the morning, and coming to
  Salcombe ran over the bar on the tail of the flood, but did not find his
  quarry there, and so beat out again on the first of the ebb and reached past
  Bolt Head and Bolt Tail, across Bigbury Bay with its low red rocks, to
  Plymouth. Wilbraham had anchored in the Cattwater only two days before; the
  yacht was a yawl, named the <i>Monitor</i>; and was making for the Scillies.
  Warriner laughed when he picked up word about the destination of the yacht,
  and thought it would be very appropriate if he could overhaul the
  <i>Monitor</i> somewhere off Rosevear. As to what course he intended to
  pursue when he caught Wilbraham, he had no settled plan; but on the other
  hand he had a new revolver in his berth.</p>

  <p>He put out from Plymouth under a light breeze, which failed him altogether
  when he was abreast of Rame Head. Through the rest of the day he drifted with
  the tide betwixt Rame Head and Plymouth. The night came upon him jewelled
  with stars, and a light mist upon the surface of the water; all that night he
  swung up and down some four miles out to sea within view of Plymouth lights,
  but towards morning, a fitful wind sprang up, drove the cutter as far as
  Polperro, and left it becalmed on a sea of glass, in front of the little
  white village in the wooded cliff-hollow, while the sun rose. Warriner opened
  the narrow line of blue water which marks the mouth of the Fowey river at
  eleven o'clock of the morning, and anchored in Fowey harbour about twelve. It
  was a Sunday, and though the <i>Monitor</i> was not at Fowey, Warriner
  determined to stay at his anchorage till the morrow.</p>

  <p>The Brixham fisherman who served him upon this cruise relates that
  Warriner displayed no impatience or anxiety at any time. Of the febrile
  instability which had set his thoughts flying this way and that during the
  days of his companionship with Charnock, there was no longer any trace in his
  demeanour. Perhaps it was that he was so certain of attaining his desires;
  perhaps the long lesson of endurance which he had been painfully taught in
  Morocco now bore its fruit; perhaps too he had acquired something of the
  passive fatalism of the Moorish race. During this Sunday afternoon, his last
  Sunday as it proved, he quietly sculled the dinghy of his cutter, when the
  tide was low, through the mud flats of the Fowey river to Lostwithiel; and
  coming down again when the river was full, lay for a long time upon his oars
  opposite a certain church that lifts above a clump of trees on the
  river-bank. There he remained listening to the roll of the organ and the
  sweet voices of the singers as they floated out through the painted windows
  into the quiet of the summer evening; when the service was over he bent to
  his sculls again and rowed back between the steep and narrowing coppices, but
  it was dark before he turned the last shoulder of hill and saw the long lines
  of riding-lights trembling upon the water.</p>

  <p>Warriner raised his anchor early on the Monday morning, and having the
  wind on his quarter, made Falmouth betimes. At Falmouth he learned that the
  <i>Monitor</i> had put out past St. Anthony's light only the day before and
  had sailed westwards to Penzance.</p>

  <p>Warriner followed without delay, and when he was just past the Manacle
  rocks, the wind dropped. With the help of the tide and an occasional flaw of
  wind, he worked his cutter round the Lizard Point and laid her head for
  Penzance across the bay; and it was then that the fog took him. It crept out
  of the sea at about four of the afternoon, a thin grey mist, and it thickened
  into a dense umber fog.</p>

  <p>The fog hung upon the Channel for thirty hours. The cutter swung into the
  bay with the tide. The Brixham fisherman could hear all along, to his right
  hand, the muffled roar as the groundswell broke upon the Lizard rocks, and
  the sucking withdrawal which told that those rocks were very near. The Lizard
  fog-horn, which sounded a minute ago abreast of them, sounded now quite
  faintly astern. The boat swung with the tide and would not steer; yet
  Warriner betrayed no alarm and no impatience at the check. He sat on the deck
  with a lantern by his side and drew, said the fisherman, a little flute or
  pipe from his pocket, on which he played tunes that were no tunes, and from
  which he drew a weird shrill music of an infinite melancholy and of infinite
  suggestions. Once the Brixham man crouched suddenly by the gunwale and peered
  intently over the boat's side. At a little distance off, something black
  loomed through the fog about the height of the mast's yard,&mdash;something
  black which rapidly approached.</p>

  <p>"It's not a squall," said Warriner, quietly interrupting his music. "It's
  a rock. I know this coast well. We had better get the dinghy out and row her
  head off."</p>

  <p>When that was done, he squatted again upon the deck by the side of the
  lantern, and played shrilly upon his pipe while the light threw a grotesque
  reflection of his figure upon the fog.</p>

  <p>After a while they heard the Lizard-horn abreast of them again.</p>

  <p>"The tide has turned," said Warriner, and the Brixham man dived hurriedly
  into the well for the poor fog-horn which the boat carried. The cutter
  drifted out stern-foremost past the Lizard rocks, and in a little, from this
  side and from that, ahead of them, astern, they heard the throb of engines
  and the hoarse steam-whistles of the Atlantic cargo-boats and liners. They
  had drifted across the track of the ocean-going steamers. The Brixham man
  blew upon his horn till his lungs cracked. He relates that nothing happened
  until three o'clock in the morning, as he knows, since Warriner just at three
  o'clock took his watch from his pocket and looked at the dial by the
  lantern-light. He mentions too, as a detail which struck him at the time,
  that the door of the lantern was open, and so still was the heavy air that
  the candle burnt steadily as in a room. At three o'clock in the morning he
  suddenly saw a glimmering flash of white upon the cutter's beam. For a
  fraction of a second he was dazed. Then he lifted the horn to his mouth, and
  he was still lifting it&mdash;so small an interval was there of
  time&mdash;when a huge sharp wedge cut through the fog and towered above the
  cutter out of sight. The wedge was the bows of an Atlantic liner. No one on
  that liner heard the despairing, interrupted moan of the tiny fog-horn
  beneath the ship's forefoot; no one felt the shock. The Brixham man was
  hurled clear of the steamer, and after swimming for the best part of an hour
  was picked up by a smack which he came upon by chance. Warriner's body was
  washed up three days later upon the Lizard rocks.</p>

  <p>This history did not reach Charnock's ears for a full year afterwards; for
  within a week of his arrival in London, where his unexplained disappearance
  had puzzled very few, since he was known for a man of many disappearances, he
  had started off to Asia Minor, there to survey the line of a projected
  railway. The railway was never more than projected, and after a year the
  survey was abandoned. Charnock returned to London and heard the story of
  Warriner's death from Lady Donnisthorpe's lips at her last reception at the
  end of the season. Lady Donnisthorpe was irritated at the impassive face with
  which he listened. She was yet more irritated when he said casually, without
  any reference whatever to a word of her narrative, "Who is that girl? I think
  I have seen her before."</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe followed the direction of his eyes, and saw a young girl
  with very pale gold hair. Lady Donnisthorpe rose from her chair. "Perhaps you
  would like me to introduce you," she said with sarcastic asperity.</p>

  <p>"I should," replied Charnock.</p>

  <p>Lady Donnisthorpe waved her hands helplessly and brushed away all mankind.
  She led Charnock across the room, introduced him, and left him with a manner
  of extreme coldness, to which Charnock at this moment was quite
  impervious.</p>

  <p>"I think I have seen you here before," said Charnock.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl, "I remember. It was some while since. Why have you
  quarrelled?"</p>

  <p>The meaning of that question dawned upon Charnock gradually. The girl with
  the gold hair smiled at his perplexity, and laughed pleasantly at his
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>Charnock looked round the room.</p>

  <p>"No," said she.</p>

  <p>He looked towards the window, and the window was open.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Charnock found Miranda upon the balcony.</p>
