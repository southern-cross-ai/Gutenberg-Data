  <p class="first">IT has been my good fortune to have an experience of a life
  which is already extinct, for although whale-ships, both English and
  American, still go to Davis' Strait, the Greenland fishing--that is, the
  fishing in the waters between Greenland and Spitzbergen--has been attended
  with such ill-fortune during the last ten years that it has now been
  abandoned. The <i>Hope</i> and the <i>Eclipse</i>, both of Peterhead, were
  the last two vessels which clung to an industry which was once so flourishing
  that it could support a fleet of a hundred sail; and it was in the
  <i>Hope</i>, under the command of the well-known whaler, John Gray, that I
  paid a seven months' visit to the Arctic Seas in the year 1880. I went in the
  capacity of surgeon, but as I was only twenty years of age when I started,
  and as my knowledge of medicine was that of an average third year's student,
  I have often thought that it was as well that there was no very serious call
  upon my services.</p>

  <p>It came about in this way. One raw afternoon--in Edinburgh, whilst I was
  sitting reading hard for one of those examinations which blight the life of a
  medical student, there entered to me a fellow-student, with whom I had some
  slight acquaintance. The monstrous question which he asked drove all thought
  of my studies out of my head.</p>

  <p>"Would you care," said he, "to start next week for a whaling cruise?
  You'll be surgeon, two pounds ten a month, and three shillings a ton oil
  money.</p>

  <p>"How do you know I'll get the berth?" was my natural question.</p>

  <p>"Because I have it myself. I find at this last moment that I can't go, and
  I want to get a man to take my place."</p>

  <p>"How about an Arctic kit?"</p>

  <p>"You can have mine."</p>

  <p class="caption">Captain John Gray.</p><br>

  <p>In an instant the thing was settled, and within a few minutes the current
  of my life had been deflected into a new channel.</p>

  <p>In little more than a week I was in Peterhead, and busily engaged, with
  the help of the steward, in packing away my scanty belongings in the locker
  beneath my bunk on the good ship <i>Hope</i>. And this, my first appearance
  aboard the ship, was marked by an absurd incident. In my student days boxing
  was a favorite amusement of mine, for I had found that when reading hard one
  can compress more exercise into a short time in this way than in any other.
  Among my belongings, therefore were two pairs of battered and discolored
  gloves. Now, it chanced that the steward was a bit of a fighting man, so when
  my unpacking was finished he, of his own accord, picked up the gloves and
  proposed that we should then and there have a bout. I don't know whether Jack
  Lamb still lives--but if he does I am sure that he remembers the incident. I
  can see him now, blue-eyed, yellow-bearded, short but deep-chested, with the
  bandy legs of a very muscular man. Our contest was an unfair one, for he was
  several inches shorter in the reach than I, and knew nothing about sparring,
  although I have no doubt he was a formidable person in a street row. I kept
  propping him off as he rushed at me, and at last, finding that he was
  determined to bore his way in, I had to hit him out with some severity. An
  hour or so afterwards, as I sat reading in the saloon, there was a murmur in
  the mate's berth, which was next door, and suddenly I heard the steward say,
  in loud tones of conviction: "So help me, Colin, he's the best surrr-geon
  we've had! He's blackened my e'e!" It was the first--and very nearly the
  last--testimonial that I ever received to my professional abilities.</p>

    <p class="caption">The "Hope"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He was a good fellow, the steward, and as I look back at that long voyage,
  during which for seven months we never set our feet upon land, his kindly,
  open face is one of those of which I like to think. He had a very beautiful
  and sympathetic tenor voice, and many an hour have I listened to it, with its
  accompaniment of rattling plates and jingling knives, as he cleaned up the
  dishes in his pantry. He knew a great store of pathetic and sentimental
  songs, and it is only when you have not seen a woman's face for six months
  that you realize what sentiment means. When Jack trilled out "Her Bright
  Smile Haunts Me Still," or "Wait for Me at Heaven's Gate, Sweet Belle
  Mahone," he filled us all with a vague, sweet discontent, which comes back to
  me now as I think of it. As to his boxing, he practised with me every day,
  and became a formidable opponent--especially when there was a sea on, when,
  with his more experienced sea-legs, he could come charging down with the heel
  of the ship. He was a baker by trade, and I dare say Greenland is as much a
  dream to him now as it is to me.</p>

  <p>There was one curious, thing about the manning of the <i>Hope</i>. The man
  who signed on as first mate was a little, decrepit, broken fellow, absolutely
  incapable of performing the duties. The cook's assistant, on the other hand,
  was a giant of a man, red-bearded, bronzed, with huge limbs, and a voice of
  thunder. But the moment that the ship cleared the harbour the little decrepit
  mate disappeared into the cook's galley, and acted as scullery-boy for the
  voyage, while the mighty scullery-boy walked aft and became chief mate. The
  fact was, that the one had the certificate, but was past sailoring, while the
  other could neither read nor write, but was as fine a seaman as ever lived;
  so, by an agreement to which everybody concerned was party, they swapped
  their berths when they were at sea.</p>

    <p class="caption">Colin McLean</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Colin McLean, with his six foot of stature, his erect, stalwart figure,
  and his fierce, red beard, pouring out from between the flaps of his
  sealing-cap, was an officer by natural selection, which is a higher title
  than that of a Board of Trade certificate. His only fault was that he was a
  very hot-blooded man, and that a little would excite him to a frenzy. I have
  a vivid recollection of an evening which I spent in dragging him off from the
  steward, who had imprudently made some criticism upon his way of attacking a
  whale which bad escaped. Both men had had some rum, which had made the one
  argumentative and the other violent, and as we were all three seated in a
  space of about seven by four, it took some bard work to prevent bloodshed.
  Every now and then, just as I thought all danger was past, the steward would
  begin again with his fatuous, "No offence, Colin, but all I says is that if
  you had been a bit quicker on the fush--" I don't know how often this
  sentence was begun, but never once was it ended, for at the word "fush" Colin
  always seized him by the throat, and I Colin round the waist, and we
  struggled until we were all panting and exhausted. Then, when the steward had
  recovered a little breath, he would start that miserable sentence once more,
  and the "fush" would be the signal for another encounter. I really believe
  that if I had not been there the mate would have killed him, for he was quite
  the angriest man that I have ever seen.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>There were fifty men upon our whaler, of whom half were Scotchmen and half
  Shetlanders, whom we picked up at Lerwick as we passed. The Shetlanders were
  the steadier and more tractable, quiet, decent, and soft-spoken; while the
  Scotch seamen were more likely to give trouble, but also more virile and of
  stronger character. The officers and harpooners were all Scotch, but as
  ordinary seamen, and especially as boatmen, the Shetlanders were as good as
  could be wished.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Harpoon and gun.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>There was only one man on board who belonged neither to Scotland nor to
  Shetland, and he was the mystery of the ship. He was a tall, swarthy,
  dark-eyed man, with blue-black hair and beard, singularly handsome features,
  and a curious reckless sling of his shoulders when he walked. It was rumoured
  that became from the South of England, and that he had fled thence to avoid
  the law. He made friends with no one, and spoke very seldom, but he was one
  of the smartest seamen in the ship. I could believe from his appearance that
  his temper was Satanic, and that the crime for which he was hiding may have
  been a bloody one. Only once he gave us a glimpse of his hidden fires. The
  cook--a very burly, powerful man--the little mate was only assistant--had a
  private store of rum, and treated himself so liberally to it that for three
  successive days the dinner of the crew was ruined. On the third day our
  silent outlaw approached the cook with a brass saucepan in his hand. He said
  nothing, but he struck the man such a frightful blow that his head flew
  through, the bottom, and the side of the pan were left dangling round his
  neck. The half-drunken and half-stunned cook talked of fighting, but he was
  soon made to feel that, the sympathy of the ship was against him, so be
  reeled back grumbling to his duties, while the avenger relapsed into his
  usual moody indifference. We heard no further complaints about the
  cooking.</p>

  <p>There are eight boats on board a whaler, but it is usual to send out only
  seven, for it takes six men each to man them, so that when the seven are out
  no one is left on board except the so-called "idlers," who have not signed to
  do seaman's work at all. It happened, however, that on board the <i>Hope</i>
  the "idlers" were an exceptionally active and energetic lot, so we
  volunteered to man the eighth boat, and we made it, in our own estimation at
  least, one of the most efficient both in sealing and in whaling. The steward,
  the second engineer, the donkey-engine man, and I pulled the oars, with a
  red-headed Highlander for harpooner, and the handsome outlaw to steer. Our
  tally of seals stood as high as any; and in whaling we were once the
  harpooning boat and once the lancing boat, so our record was an excellent
  one. So congenial was the work to me, that Captain Gray was good enough to
  offer to make me harpooner as well as surgeon if I would come with him upon a
  second voyage, with power to draw the double pay. It is as well that I
  refused, for the life is such a fascinating one that I could imagine that a
  man would find it more and more difficult to give it up. Most of the crew are
  never called upon to do so, for they spend their whole lives in the same
  trade. There were men on board the <i>Hope</i> who had never seen corn
  growing, for from their boyhood they had always started for the whaling in
  March and returned in September.</p>

  <p>One of the charms of the work is the gambling element, which is inherent
  in it. Every man shares in the profit--so much for the captain, so much for
  the mate, so much for the seaman. If the voyage is successful everyone is
  rich until another spring comes round. If the ship comes from clean it means
  a starvation winter for all hands. The men do not need to be told to be keen.
  The shout from the crow's-nest, which tells of the presence of a whale, and
  the rattle of the falls as the boats are cleared away, blend into one sound.
  The watch below rush up from their bunks with their clothes over their arms,
  and spring into the boats in that Arctic air, waiting for a chance later for
  finishing their toilet. Woe betide the harpooner or the boat-steerer who by
  any clumsiness has missed a fish! He has taken a five-pound note out of the
  pocket of every meanest hand upon the ship. Black is his welcome when he
  returns to his fellows.</p>

  <p>What surprised me most in the Arctic regions was the rapidity with which
  you reach them. I had never realized that they lie at our very doors. I think
  that we were only four days out from Shetland when we were among the drift
  ice. I awoke of a morning to hear the bump, bump of the floating pieces
  against the side of the ship, and I went on deck to see the whole sea covered
  with them to the horizon. They were none of them large, but they lay so thick
  that a man might travel far by springing from one to the other. Their
  dazzling whiteness made the sea seem bluer by contrast, and with a blue sky
  above, and that glorious Arctic air in one's nostrils, it was a morning to
  remember. Once, on one of the swaying, rocking pieces we saw a huge seal,
  sleek, sleepy, and imperturbable, looking up with the utmost assurance at the
  ship, as if it knew that the close time had still three weeks to run. Further
  on we saw on the ice the long, human-like prints of a bear. All this with the
  snowdrops of Scotland still fresh in our glasses in the cabin.</p>

  <p>I have spoken about the close time, and I may explain that, by an
  agreement between the Norwegian and the British Governments, the subjects of
  both nations are forbidden to kill a seal before the 3rd of April. The reason
  for this is, that the breeding season is in March, and if the mothers should
  be killed before the young are able to take care of themselves, the race
  would soon become extinct. For breeding purposes, the seals all come together
  at a variable spot, which is evidently pre-arranged among them, and as this
  place may be anywhere within many hundreds of square miles of floating ice,
  it is no easy matter for the fisher to find it. The means by which he sets
  about it are simple but ingenious. As the ship makes its way through the
  loose ice-streams, a school of seals is observed travelling through the
  water. Their direction is carefully taken by compass and marked upon the
  chart. An hour afterwards perhaps another school is seen. This is also
  marked. When these bearings have been taken several times, the various lines
  upon the chart are prolonged until they intersect. At this point, or near it,
  it is likely that the main pack of the seals will be found.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>When you do come upon it, it is a wonderful sight, I suppose it is the
  largest assembly of creatures upon the face of the world--and this upon the
  open ice-fields hundreds of miles from Greenland coast. Somewhere between 71
  deg. and 75 deg., is the rendezvous, and the longitude is even vaguer; but
  the seals have no difficulty in finding the address. From the crow's-nest at
  the top of the main-mast, one can see no end of them. On the furthest visible
  ice one can still see that sprinkling of pepper grains. And the young lie
  everywhere also, snow-white slugs, with a little black nose and large, dark
  eyes. Their half-human cries fill the air; and when you are sitting in the
  cabin of a ship which is in the heart of the seal-pack, you would think you
  were next door to a monstrous nursery.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The <i>Hope</i> was one of the first to find the seal-pack that year, but
  before the day came when hunting was allowed, we had a succession of strong
  gales, followed by a severe roll, which tilted the floating ice and launched
  the young seals prematurely into the water. And so, when the law at last
  allowed us to begin work, Nature had left us with very little work to do.
  However, at dawn upon the third, the ship's company took to the ice, and
  began to gather in its murderous harvest. It is brutal work, though not more
  brutal than that which goes onto supply every dinner-table in the country.
  And yet those glaring crimson pools upon the dazzling white of the
  ice-fields, under the peaceful silence of a blue Arctic sky, did seem a
  horrible intrusion. But an inexorable demand creates an inexorable supply,
  and the seals, by their death, help to give a living to the long line of
  seamen, dockers, tanners, curers, triers, chandlers, leather merchants, and
  oil-sellers, who stand between this annual butchery on the one hand, and the
  exquisite, with his soft leather boots, or the savant using a delicate oil
  for his philosophical instruments, upon the other.</p>

    <p class="caption">Flensing and cutting up blubber on board.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>I have cause to remember that first day of sealing on account of the
  adventures which befell me. I have said that a strong swell had arisen, and
  as this was dashing the floating ice together the captain thought it
  dangerous for an inexperienced man to venture upon it. And so, just as I was
  clambering over the bulwarks with the rest, he ordered me back and told me to
  remain on board. My remonstrances were useless, and at last, in the blackest
  of tempers, I seated myself upon the top of the bulwarks, with my feet
  dangling over the outer side, and there I nursed my wrath, swinging up and
  down with the roll of the ship. It chanced, however, that I was really seated
  upon a thin sheet of ice which had formed upon the wood, and so when the
  swell threw her over to a particularly acute angle, I shot off and vanished
  into the sea between two ice-blocks. As I rose, I clawed on to one of these,
  and soon scrambled on board again. The accident brought about what I wished,
  however, for the captain remarked that as I was bound to fall into the ocean
  in any case, I might just as well be on the ice as on the ship. I justified
  his original caution by falling in twice again during the day, and I finished
  it ignominiously by having to take to my bed while all my clothes were drying
  in the engine-room.</p>

  <p>I was consoled for my misfortunes by finding that they amused the captain
  to such an extent that they drove the ill success of our sealing out of his
  head, and I had to answer to the name of "the great northern diver" for a
  long time thereafter. I had a narrow escape once through stepping backwards
  over the edge of a piece of floating ice while I was engaged in skinning a
  seal. I had wandered away from the others, and no one saw my misfortune. The
  face of the ice was so even that I had no purchase by which to pull myself
  up, and my body was rapidly becoming numb in the freezing water. At last,
  however, I caught hold of the hind flipper of the dead seal, and there was a
  kind of nightmare tug-of-war, the question being whether I should pull the
  seal off or pull myself on, At last, however, I got my knee over the edge and
  rolled on to it. I remember that my clothes were as hard as a suit of armour
  by the time I reached the ship, and that I had to thaw my crackling garments
  before I could change them.</p>

  <p>This April sealing is directed against the mothers and young. Then, in
  May, the sealer goes further north; and about latitude 77 deg. or 78 deg. he
  comes upon the old male seals, who are by no means such easy victims. They
  are wary creatures, and it takes good long-range shooting to bag them. Then,
  in June, the sealing is over, and the ship bears away further north still
  until in the 79th or 80th degree she is in the best Greenland whaling
  latitudes. There she remains for three months or so, and if she is fortunate
  she may bring back 300 or 400 per cent to her owners, and a nice little purse
  full for every man of her ship's company. Or if her profits be more modest,
  she has at least afforded such sport that every other sport is dwarfed by the
  comparison.</p>

  <p>It is seldom that one meets anyone who understands the value of a
  Greenland whale. A well-boned and large one as she floats is worth to-day
  something between two and three thousand pounds. This huge price is due to
  the value of whalebone, which is a very rare commodity, and yet is absolutely
  essential for some trade purposes. The price tends to rise steadily, for the
  number of the creatures is diminishing. In 1880, Captain Gray calculated that
  there were probably not more than 300 of them left alive in the whole expanse
  of the Greenland seas, an area of thousands of square miles. How few there
  are is shown by the fact that he recognised individuals amongst those which
  we chased. There was one with a curious wart about the size of a beehive upon
  his tail which he had remembered chasing when he was a lad on his father's
  ship. Perhaps other generations of whalers may follow that warty tail, for
  the whale is a very long-lived creature. How long they live has never been
  ascertained; but in the days when it was customary to stamp harpoons with
  the names of vessels, old harpoons have been cut out of whales bearing names
  long forgotten in the trade, and all the evidence goes to prove that a
  century is well within their powers.</p>

  <p>It is exciting work pulling on to a whale. Your own back is turned to him,
  and all you know about him is what you read upon the face of the
  boat-steerer. He is staring out over your head, watching the creature as it
  swims slowly through the water, raising his hand now and again as a signal to
  stop rowing when he sees that the eye is coming round, and then resuming the
  stealthy approach when the whale is end on. There are so many floating pieces
  of ice, that as long as the oars are quiet the boat alone will not cause the
  creature to dive. So you creep slowly up, and at last you are near that the
  boat-steerer knows that you can get there before the creature has time to
  dive--for it takes some little time to get that huge body into motion. You
  see a sudden gleam in his eyes, and a flush in his cheeks, and it's "Give
  way, boys! Give way, all! Hard!"</p>

  <p>Click goes the trigger of the big harpoon gun, and the foam flies from
  your oars. Six strokes, perhaps, and then with a dull, greasy squelch the
  bows run upon something soft, and you and your oars are sent flying in every
  direction. But little you care for that, for as you touched the whale you
  have heard the crash of the gun, and know that the harpoon has been fired
  point-blank into the huge, lead-coloured curve of its side. The creature
  sinks like a stone, the bows of the boat splash down into the water again,
  but there is the little red Jack flying from the centre thwart to show that
  you are fast, and there is the line whizzing swiftly under the seats and over
  the bows between your outstretched feet.</p>

  <p>And there is the one element of danger--for it is rarely indeed that the
  whale has spirit enough to turn upon its enemies. The line is very carefully
  coiled by a special man named the line-coiler, and it is warranted not to
  kink. If it should happen to do so, however, and if the loop catches the
  limbs of any one of the boat's crew, that man goes to his death so rapidly
  that his comrades hardly know that he has gone. It is a waste of fish to cut
  the line, far thy victim is already hundreds of fathoms deep.</p>

  <p>"Haud your hand, mon," cried the harpooner, as a seaman raised his knife
  on such an occasion, "The fush will be a fine thing for the widdey." It
  sounds callous, but there was philosophy at the base of it.</p>

  <p>This is the harpooning, and that boat has no more to do. But the lancing,
  when the weary fish is killed with the cold steel, is a more exciting because
  it is a more prolonged experience. You may be for half an hour so near to the
  creature that you can lay your hand upon its slimy side. The whale appears to
  have but little sensibility to pain, for it never winces when the long lances
  are passed through its body. But its instinct urges it to get its tail to
  work on the boats, and yours urges you to keep poling and boat-hooking along
  its side, so as to retain your safe position near its shoulder. Even there,
  however, we found upon this occasion that we were not quite out of danger's
  way, for the creature in its flurry raised its huge side-flapper and poised
  it over the boat. One flap would have sent us to the bottom of the sea, and I
  can never forget how, as we pushed our way from under, each of us held one
  hand up to stave off that great, threatening fin--as if any strength of ours
  could have availed if the whale had meant it to descend. But it was spent
  with loss of blood, and instead of coming down the fin rolled over the other
  way, and we knew that it was dead. Who would swap that moment for any other
  triumph that sport can give?</p>

  <p>The peculiar other-world feeling of the Arctic regions--a feeling so
  singular, that if you have once been there the thought of it haunts you all
  your life--is due largely to the perpetual daylight. Night seems more
orange-tinted and subdued than day, but there is no great difference. Some
captains
  have been known to turn their hours right round out of caprice, with
  breakfast at night and supper at ten in the morning. There are your
  twenty-four hours, and you may carve them as you like. After a month or two
  the eyes grow weary of the eternal light, and you appreciate what a soothing
  thing our darkness is. I can remember as we came abreast of Iceland, on our
  return, catching our first glimpse of a star, and being unable to take my
  eyes from it, it seemed such a dainty little twinkling thing. Half the
  beauties of Nature are lost through over familiarity.</p>

  <p>Your sense of loneliness also heightens the effect of the Arctic seas.
  When we were in whaling latitudes it is probable that, with the exception of
  our consort, there was no vessel within 800 miles of us. For seven long
  months no letter and no news came to us from the southern world. We had left
  in exciting times, The Afghan campaign had been undertaken, and war seemed
  imminent with Russia. We returned opposite the mouth of the Baltic without
  any means of knowing whether some cruiser might not treat us as we had
  treated the whales. When we met a fishing boat at the north of Shetland our
  first inquiry was as to peace or war Great events had happened during those
  seven months: the defeat of Maiwand and the famous march of Roberts from
  Cabul to Candahar. But it was all haze to us ; and, to this day, I have never
  been able to get that particular bit of military history straightened out in
  my own mind.</p>

  <p>The perpetual light, the glare of the white ice, the deep blue of the
  water, these are the things which one remembers most clearly, with the dry,
  crisp, exhilarating air, which makes mere life the keenest of pleasures. And
  then there are the innumerable seabirds, whose call is for ever ringing in
  your ears: the gulls, the fulmars, the snow-birds, the burgomasters, the
  looms, and the rotjes. These fill the air, and below, the waters are for ever
  giving you a peep of some strange new creature. The commercial whale may not
  often come your way, but his less valuable brethren abound on every side. The
  finner shows his ninety feet of worthless tallow, with the absolute
  conviction that no whaler would condescend to lower a boat for him. The
  mis-shapen hunchback whale, the ghost-like white whale, the narwhal, with his
  unicorn horn, the queer-looking bottle-nose, the huge, sluggish, Greenland
  shark, and the terrible killing grampus, the most formidable of all the
  monsters of the deep, these are the creatures who own those unsailed seas. On
  the ice are the seals, the saddle-backs, the ground seals, the huge
  bladdernoses, 12 ft. from nose to tail, with the power of blowing up a great
  blood-red football upon their noses when they are angry, which they usually
  are. Occasionally one sees a white Arctic fox upon the ice, and everywhere
  are the bears. The floes in the neighbourhood of the sealing-ground are all
  criss-crossed with their tracks--poor, harmless creatures, with the lurch and
  roll of a deep-sea mariner. It is for the sake of the seals that they come
  out over those hundreds of miles of ice--and they have a very ingenious
  method of catching them, for they will choose a big ice-field with just one
  blow-hole for seals in the middle of it. Here the bear will squat, with its
  powerful forearms crooked round the hole. Then, when the seal's head pops up,
  the great paws snap together, and Bruin has got its luncheon. We used
  occasionally to burn some of the cook's refuse in the engine-room fires, and
  the smell would, in a few hours, bring up every bear for many miles to
  leeward of us.</p>

  <p>But pleasant as the voyage is, there comes a day when the prow must be
  turned south once more. The winter comes on very suddenly sometimes, and woe
  betide the whaler which may be caught lagging. In September, then, our boats
  were taken in, our blubber tanks screwed down, and the <i>Hope</i> was fairly
  homeward bound. Far off loomed the huge peak of Jan-Mayen Island, the
  ice-blink glimmered and faded away behind us, and I had seen the last which I
  am ever, save in my dreams, likely to see of the Greenland Ocean.</p>
