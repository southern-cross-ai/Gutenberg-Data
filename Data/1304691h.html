  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE WATCHING DREAD</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the darkness Norma Lloyd could not see the little bridge
  over Wayne Creek, but she knew from the hollow rumble of boards under the
  roadster that they were on it. From beneath, the brawling of the thaw-swollen
  stream was greedy, ominous, and the hills circumscribing Hidden Valley, black
  against a black sky, seemed near, too near. They were like the inexorably
  moving walls of some monstrous Inquisition pressing inward, imperceptibly
  inward, till their victim must be crushed between. The girl shuddered and
  shrugged closer to her companion. The rasp of his rough tweed sleeve against
  her cheek, the sharp redolence of tobacco, gave her a grateful feeling of
  security. She felt the swell of his biceps as he tooled the car around an
  unseen, familiar curve, and an aura of masculine protection enveloped her.
  The car slowed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the storm will catch us if we walk, honey," Ted Stone's warm,
  deep voice sounded. "Maybe we'd better drive right up to the house." His face
  was only a paler oval in the gloom, but Norma visioned every broad-sculptured
  line of it. The corners of his mouth would be quirking in the tender half
  smile that was for her alone. "I'll switch on the headlights and take the
  upper road."</p>

  <p>"No." Her tone was sharp. "No, Ted. They'll know then that I was out with
  you and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What of it? The Sabins haven't any right to dictate to you. They're
  nothing but servants..."</p>

  <p>"Ted!" she cried indignantly. "I won't have you call them servants. They
  are real friends. You know very well that Prudence is the only mother I've
  ever known, and that Silas is devoted to me."</p>

  <p>"And why not? You mean a swell home and good wages to him. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Theodore Stone!" She pulled away from him. "Stop it. Stop it at once!
  Just because you don't like Silas you needn't keep on hinting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The jerk of the car as violent brakes went on, and jarred Norma to a halt.
  Lightning flickered behind the distant head of the valley and against its
  illumination Oak Mountain was a towering, jagged pyramid of ebony. Even in
  the stress of the lovers' quarrel the sense of dread, of impending evil,
  closed in again on Norma. But she would not admit it to Ted, or to herself.
  Her tumbling speech was only momentarily interrupted; yet despite herself its
  tone was subdued when she continued, "I've never felt they were servants, nor
  have they. I wouldn't hurt them for worlds. Anyhow, we must think of
  Jeefers."</p>

  <p>"That's right!" Ted ejaculated. "I forgot that you were supposed to have
  driven down to the village with him."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And he's waiting on the road now so that we can come back together.
  If Silas found out I was really with you, Jeefers would be the sufferer. He
  is irritatingly slow and clumsy about his work, with that short arm and
  twisted foot, and the old man would be only too glad of an excuse to fire
  him."</p>

  <p>"That settles it, kid. Guess we'll have to take the short cut. But I'm
  hanged if I like it." There was a slight edge of worry to the young lawyer's
  robust tone.</p>

  <p>"You're usually rather fond of that walk along the creek." A hint of
  Norma's usual merry teasing sounded in the lilt of her voice, "Why the sudden
  aversion?"</p>

  <p>"Come on! We'll have to hurry." Stone was out of the car, was lifting the
  girl out. Their lips met, and she clung to him for a moment. Then they were
  off the road, were following a path so accustomed that the aid of the torch
  Ted carried was unneeded. "It isn't that," he responded to Norma's remark. "I
  meant this hole and corner business, this skulking. Fine business for the
  assistant prosecutor of Calkin County to have to meet his sweetheart behind
  trees."</p>

  <p>Bushes rustled as the couple pushed through them, angry waters boiled to
  their right and far-off thunder rolled. But Ted heard only the part mocking,
  part affectionate sound of the other's rebuke: "Oh Teddy boy, when will you
  learn patience? It's only for a month more. Then I'll be twenty, dad's will
  will let us get married, and&mdash;Ohhh!" Norma's sudden scream was
  accompanied by a splash.</p>

  <p>"What the..." Stone's flash beam sprayed out. It showed the girl sprawled
  on the muddy creek bank, within inches of the tumbling, angry stream. Ted
  bent, lifted her to her feet. "Are you hurt, dear?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't think so. Part of the bank has given way. See..." She
  pointed. A trough was visible where earth had slid into the foaming waters.
  Then she gasped, "Look Ted. What's that? What is it?"</p>

  <p>The man followed the line of her shaking finger; saw that which his light
  revealed. "Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>At the edge of the disk of luminance something was gray against the
  black-brown of the mud, like gray rootlets curling. It was a hand, a skeleton
  hand, the flesh-stripped phalanges clawed as if it were scrabbling at the
  ground. Just that grisly hand showed; the rest, horribly, was covered by
  blackness.</p>

  <p>The threat of the Stygian night was imminent, personal. A rumbling thunder
  growl filled the valley and the sky was vivid with a fluttering, eerie light.
  Norma clutched Ted's arm, her fingers dug into his muscles. For a long minute
  the two stared at that which lay across their path. Then the torch moved in
  Stone's cold fingers and the light patch slid along the mire, slid along a
  bony arm, illumined a skull from which vertebrae sprouted like some noisome
  trailer vine. Ribs branched, arching down into the ooze, and mud ran fluidly
  away from the long leg bones at which watery fingers plucked.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord," Stone said again, slowly.</p>

  <p>The girl's voice was thin, edged with hysteria. "Ted," she mouthed. "Ted.
  Do you see? Do you see?"</p>

  <p>"That the back of the skull is crushed in. Yes. The man was murdered."</p>

  <p>"That too." She was forcing speech out through a squeezed throat. "But
  the...the arms. The left foot..."</p>

  <p>Her quick eye had caught something he had missed. Ted peered closer and
  cold rippled up his back. One outstretched arm was longer than the other; the
  left ankle was oddly deformed. If he were alive, upright, the man's one foot
  would be twisted sidewise. Just so was Jeefer's foot twisted, just so were
  his arms mismated, the handyman who was waiting for Norma on the road near
  here. Who <i>should</i> be waiting here...</p>

  <p>"It's Jeefers, Ted. It's Jeefers."</p>

  <p>"No," he almost groaned. "You saw him alive two hours ago. Even if
  something had happened to him in that time he couldn't have become&mdash;like
  that&mdash;in so short a time."</p>

  <p>Something, a plump, pallid worm, crawled out of an eye socket.</p>

  <p>"But there couldn't be two men with arms like that, with a foot twisted
  just like that. There couldn't..."</p>

  <p>Blue light exploded and deafening thunder peal rolled away, reverberating
  along the valley. A wall of wind swept down, howling in a siren blast; great
  raindrops lashed at them. Ted whirled to the girl, grabbed her arm. "Come on
  Norma, we've got to run for it."</p>

  <p>The wide meadow they had to cross, drenched and with running, slipping
  steps, was a lake into which a torrent pelted, the road beyond, a river.
  Through the driving rain the house was invisible till they stumbled on its
  very steps. Stone half carried Norma onto the porch. They could breathe
  something other than water here, but it was poor shelter. "Get inside," he
  gasped. "And I'll try to make it back to my car by the road."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to stay here, Ted." The girl dabbed ineffectually at the
  water streaming from her hair, her forehead. "You can't get anywhere in
  this."</p>

  <p>"But Sabin..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind Silas. This is different. I wouldn't send a dog out in this
  weather, much less you. You must stay."</p>

  <p>An opening door was outlined in a yellow light; a black figure was
  silhouetted within its aperture. An old man's voice quavered, "Who is it?
  Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"I, Silas. I'm drenched."</p>

  <p>"Come in. Come in then. Who's that with you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stone. Hurry, Ted. Prudence will give me fits if we get her nice hall
  all wet. The rain is blowing in."</p>

  <p>There seemed nothing else to do. Stone followed Norma in, helped Sabin get
  the door shut against the drive of the wind. The latch caught, the old man
  slipped a bolt into its socket, and turned to the dripping couple. He was
  tall, powerfully built; but his clothes hung loosely from his gaunt frame,
  and there was a half inch space between his collar and the seamed, leathery
  skin of his age-shrunk neck. His cheeks were hollow, and between them his
  great nose stuck out like a promontory on a rocky coast. Tobacco stain edged
  the white of his uneven mustache. His eyes&mdash;Norma saw only kindliness in
  their faded blue while her fiancé insisted they were sly and
  scheming&mdash;now peered near-sightedly at the girl. "You're all wet," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Silas," the girl ejaculated. "Jeefers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sabin jerked his nasal pointer to the curtained archway behind which was
  the parlor. Gruff voices rasped from within. The old man's bloodless lips
  moved, forming silent words. "Look out!"</p>

  <p>There was sudden tensity in the entrance hall, and Norma realized that
  Silas' hands, gnarled but almost transparent, were trembling slightly.
  Thought slid through her brain, lightning-fast. He didn't want the men inside
  to hear about Jeefers, he knew something but didn't dare to talk. Who were
  the visitors, anyway? The Lloyd farm was ten miles from its nearest neighbor,
  and visitors rare.</p>

  <p>Why was Silas so terribly frightened?</p>

  <p>Ted broke the taut silence. "You'd better go upstairs and get into dry
  clothes, Norma." He had noticed something too, and he was trying to get her
  away.</p>

  <p>The girl kept her voice even. She must find out what was going on. "Right
  you are! Silas, will you please ask Prudence to come up and help me?"</p>

  <p>Sabin's eyes were bleak. He made a little ineffectual gesture. "Prue's
  inside. She's busy." His troubled glance strayed to the parlor door. He was
  trying to convey a message, but Norma couldn't understand him. The voices
  inside had stopped; there was a listening silence. Norma made a decision. She
  moved quickly, too quickly for Sabin or Ted to stop her. Her hand was on the
  curtain and she thrust it aside.</p>

  <p>The cluttered, ancient room was lit only by dancing flames in the
  fireplace. Two strangers were seated either side the hearth, firelight
  concentrated on them like a theatrical spotlight. One was slender, short. His
  swarthy, sharp face was ferret-like; his mouth a thin, cruel slash.</p>

  <p>The other overflowed his big chair, bulged through its interstices. His
  hands were blobs of unshaped dough at the ends of columnar arms folded across
  a billowing, mountainous abdomen. His tremendous head, absolutely hairless,
  presented a face that was an expanse of blankness dotted by a tiny red mouth
  and pig like eyes almost overwhelmed by waves of yellow-pink flesh. The girl
  thought of the grave worm that had oozed from an empty eye socket and
  shuddered. This man was like that creature of rottenness, magnified...</p>

  <p>A piping, thin voice startled her. "Good evening, young lady," it said.
  The fat man's lips had moved, but it took an instant to realize that so huge
  a body could emit so tenuous a sound. "Pardon me for not rising,
  my&mdash;mass&mdash;must be my excuse." There was a faintly foreign flavor to
  his precise utterance, the merest hint of alien blood. "Get up, Juan, where
  are your manners?" His minute eyes did not move from her as he shrilled the
  command, but the other jerked from his seat like an automaton. Something
  glittered under his unkempt black hair. The last touch of unreality was added
  to the scene as Norma saw it was a gold earring.</p>

  <p>"Good evening?" For the life of her Norma could not have said more than
  the two words, but she contrived the interrogative inflection. Windows
  rattled as the gale battered against the panes, and the downpour was a steady
  drumming. The girl wished herself out in the tempest rather than here in the
  warmth and dryness with these men. There was something inimical about them,
  something deadly.</p>

  <p>She was being answered..."We were driving past and the storm swept down
  on us. Your man was good enough to permit us to take shelter here." The way
  he was looking at her made Norma conscious that her drenched frock was
  clinging revealingly to her figure. She tried to pull it away with numb
  fingers. "Permit me to introduce myself. I am John Smith." He lied, of
  course, and wanted her to know it.</p>

  <p>"I am Norma Lloyd." She felt Ted's presence behind her.</p>

  <p>"And this is Mr. Stone." The fire flared, its light invading a hitherto
  shadowy corner behind Juan, and she saw Prudence there, bolt upright on the
  edge of a chair. There was a misery of fear in the woman's face as she
  twisted at her apron hem. It was evident that she wanted to get away, but
  dared not. Was this the explanation for Silas' strange actions outside? Was
  his wife a hostage for his discretion?</p>

  <p>"I am glad we could offer you protection from the rain. But why are you
  sitting in the dark?" Norma's hand went to a wall switch at her side, clicked
  it on. Garish illumination flooded the room, but it did not dissipate the
  dread that lay there like a pall.</p>

  <p>Ted came past her. His eyes were somber, his smile palpably forced. "You
  were on your way to visit someone in the village, Mr. Smith?" he asked
  suavely.</p>

  <p>Juan scowled, but Smith's countenance was a bland, expressionless mask.
  "No," he wheezed. "No. We were just passing through."</p>

  <p>This, too, could not be true. There was no highway through Hidden Valley's
  twenty mile length. There was only the one entrance, through the notch
  between Oak Mountain and North Hill. The "village" was a general store and
  post office, a feed store and a blacksmith shop. Unless they had mistaken
  their way the man's answer was a lie. And "John Smith" did not look like one
  who would lose his way.</p>

  <p>Ted reached the fire, turned his back to its heat. "I see," he said
  slowly. "I see." His gaze was fixed steadily on Smith's face. "In other
  words, it is none of our business what you are doing here." His jaw firmed
  and his brown eyes were challenging. Juan grunted. Norma saw his hand dart to
  his belt, caught the flash of metal, a knife, and her throat tightened. But
  Smith flashed a warning glance at the man, and his hand dropped away. Then
  the obese stranger looked at Stone. "Exactly," he said blandly. "Exactly." He
  seemed coldly amused.</p>

  <p>Silence, tense and breathless, followed his words. Ted did not move from
  his position before the fire. He seemed to be waiting...</p>

  <p>"Norma! Go upstairs and change." Ted's eyes were demanding. "You'll catch
  your death of cold."</p>

  <p>She didn't want to go. Something was going to happen, and she wanted to be
  there to help. But she could think of no reasonable excuse. "Please go,
  Norma," Ted said firmly. She turned and went out into the hall, her small
  fists clenched.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE WALKING DEAD</h2>

  <p class="first">THE stairwell, rising from the entrance hall, was boxed in.
  But there was a switch at the bottom that turned on a light upstairs. Norma
  clicked it and started up. The house, solidly built as it was, trembled a
  little under the repeated blows of the storm, and she could hear the long,
  eerie <i>whooo</i> of the wind. The creek must be over its banks, she
  thought, and shivered as she recalled the skeleton lying down there in the
  meadow...</p>

  <p>She stopped, halfway up the stairs, and bit her lip. Was that a furtive
  footstep she had heard above? She listened. But the sound did not come again.
  She must have imagined it. There was nothing up there. Nobody. She was cold
  and nervous. A rubdown, fresh clothing, would calm her. She started up again,
  reached the stair head.</p>

  <p>And then, without sound, the lights went out! She was in darkness,
  enveloping, ominous. She turned. There was only firelight glow below through
  the curtains she had left open. The storm...</p>

  <p>A sound whirled her around. Something leaped at her from the darkness,
  something she glimpsed just as a hand went over her mouth and an arm clamped
  around her waist! Hot breath was in her face, a low growl in her ears. Her
  firm little hands snatched at the rough fingers on her lips, tore them away.
  She screamed, "Ted!"</p>

  <p>Then the fingers clamped down again. Now they were forcing her head back,
  were bending her whole body back over the clamping arm. Sweat stench was
  acrid in her nostrils, her spine was cracking.</p>

  <p>Footsteps thudded up the stairs, Ted roared, "Norma! What...?" Norma felt
  herself flung, headlong, away from her snarling attacker. She crashed against
  a wall, slumped to the floor, half-stunned and momentarily paralyzed by the
  impact. But against the dim glimmer she saw Ted hurtling up the stairs, saw a
  silhouetted arm, something clutched in its hand, rise and fall; heard the
  sickening crunch of its weapon against Ted's head. He collapsed, soundlessly.
  A gargantuan shape bent over him. The arm rose again for a finishing
  blow.</p>

  <p>And from somewhere, then, Norma gained strength to catapult from the
  floor, to hurl herself on that dark form. The man staggered under the
  unexpected attack, twisted, snarling. But the girl was swarming over him, a
  furious whirlwind, biting, scratching, and kicking. She was primitive woman
  battling for her mate; she was a tigress protecting her young. A hard fist
  thudded against her, somewhere, but she felt no pain. Her nails ploughed
  through soft flesh; there was the warm, salty taste of blood on her
  tongue.</p>

  <p>Somehow, she realized, she had snatched the club from his hand. Now she
  half raised it to strike. Dodging, the man gathered himself, threw her off,
  wrenched away, and was gone. Norma heard his footsteps thudding away down the
  dark hall. Perhaps the very fierceness and unexpectedness of her attack had
  beaten him&mdash;and yet it seemed more that he had of his own volition
  decided to postpone this&mdash;that he had perhaps another task to perform,
  from which he would return to this&mdash;later. These thoughts Norma did not
  think, yet dimly they registered on her brain as she crawled to the dark,
  unmoving mound that was Ted. Her hand found his head, felt sticky, viscous
  liquid thick on his temple. Light! If only she had light. She whimpered in
  her tight throat. Was he...?</p>

  <p>From below affrighting sound vibrated up to the girl, burbling horrible
  sound. It was a scream, a wailing, agonized scream. It cut short, and there
  was dreadful silence. Then someone moaned down there.</p>

  <p>There was a slight movement in the flaccid body under her hands. Ted
  groaned. Then he was quiet again, and the only sound from him was the soft
  whisper of shallow breathing. He was alive, alive but badly hurt. His torso
  was on the landing but his legs trailed down the steps. He was terribly
  wounded and needed help. If she left him like this and he came to, moved, he
  would tumble down the steep stairs. That might kill him. Norma tugged at him,
  trying to pull him up to the hall floor. But he was too heavy; she could not
  budge him.</p>

  <p>Norma's thoughts were reeling light and darkness. Fear, terror tore at
  her. Up here, somewhere in the dark, was the man who had done this. Below
  were those other men, and something dreadful had happened there. She dared
  not leave Ted. She must get help to move him, hot water to bathe his wound.
  He would die if she didn't do something. If only there was someone to help
  her.</p>

  <p>"Silas," she called, finding her voice at last. "Silas!"</p>

  <p>Silas did not answer. No one answered. The wind howled outside, and
  muffled thunder rumbled, but within the house there was only the terribly
  faint sound of Ted's breathing and a low moaning from the parlor.
  "Silas!"</p>

  <p>Yes! There was another sound. Up here, somewhere back in the shadows,
  there was a stealthy, hissing scrape...A rat? Old boards warping? Or was the
  mysterious attacker creeping back to finish his kill? Norma crouched, tried
  to pierce the darkness with her eyes. She could see nothing. The sound did
  not come again.</p>

  <p>Her fingers groped for and found Ted's wound. It was a gash, a terribly
  deep gash above his left temple, where his hair began. Blood welled from it
  rapidly. She could feel his pulse against the bone, and it was weak,
  dreadfully weak. Downstairs, in the kitchen, there were first aid supplies.
  She must get them. She must get them or Ted would die. If she ran, if she
  went quickly, she could get back before anything more happened to him.</p>

  <p>Norma got to her feet. The moaning had stopped. She threw one more
  terrified glance into the gloom of the upper hallway, and then she was
  running down the stairs...</p>

  <p>She gained the entrance foyer, was through the archway. The men were gone!
  No! One lay on the floor just beyond the hearthstone; the little one with
  earrings. He lay face down in a dark pool that reflected ruby light, and the
  back of his head was bashed in. Norma wondered why he wasn't a skeleton like
  Jeefers, whose skull had also been crushed. She hurried past him. She must
  get back to Ted. She couldn't stop.</p>

  <p>Prudence was in the same chair, but she was bound to it now and there was
  a gag in her mouth. Her frightened eyes begged Norma to release her. But
  Norma rushed on to the door in the side wall that led to the dining room.
  Beyond was the kitchen and the things she must get for Ted. Prudence was tied
  up but she wasn't hurt. Time enough to take care of her later when Ted was
  safe. Ted, dear Ted, who lay up there at the head of the stairs, so terribly
  hurt. She must get back to him, she could stop for nothing.</p>

  <p>She didn't see the dining room or the short, narrow passage into the
  kitchen as she ran through them. She saw only the small closet over the
  kitchen sink where bandages, iodine and cotton were. She snatched them out,
  whirled and was running back. Passageway, dining room, parlor with its corpse
  and its bound woman, were a blur. She was dashing up the stairs. "Ted," she
  whimpered. "I'm coming."</p>

  <p><i>"Ted!"</i> Norma reeled against the wall at the stairhead. He wasn't
  there! She sank to her knees and felt along the floor. Here. He had been
  right here. But he wasn't here any longer. "Ted," she moaned, and stared with
  fearful eyes into the blackness of the upstairs corridor. The prowler had
  come back, had carried him away. He was somewhere back there, somewhere in
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>In the darkness! She must find him; she must have light to find him. And
  there was no light. But there were candles in a chest up in the attic. She
  had put them there herself, and matches, the last time the little powerhouse
  in the village had failed and the lights had gone out.</p>

  <p>It wasn't courage that brought Norma Lloyd to her feet, that took her
  through the blackness of that hall where the prowler lurked, that set her
  climbing the ladder to the attic. She was an automaton, a machine moving
  without conscious will, a robot impelled by some power outside herself. This
  peaceful world of hers was suddenly mad; this quiet house where she had been
  born was suddenly a place of terror, of sudden unexplained attacks, of grisly
  murder. And terror had driven thought from her, had driven fear from her. She
  was beyond all that. She was beyond everything save anxiety, heartrending
  anxiety for the fate of her wounded, vanished lover.</p>

  <p>The musty, dust smell of the attic was in her nostrils. Rain drummed on
  the slanted roof over her, thunder resounded, appallingly loud in this
  confined space. It was pitch-black but she needed no light to find the chest
  she sought. Rough wood rasped her hand. The lid came up, screeching protest.
  The shriek of the rusted hinges hid another sound, a stealthy footfall Norma
  did not hear...She felt for the candles, and their cool roundness greeted
  her fingers in a nest of soft cloth. There were matches here too.</p>

  <p>Norma struck one against the chest. A tiny triangle of flame flared up,
  flickered. A candlewick caught and the darkness retreated. But only a little
  way. It still lurked where piled boxes and trunks offered it refuge. She
  puffed out the match.</p>

  <p>And she went suddenly rigid. For someone was here in the attic! She felt
  eyes on her, heard the hiss of taut breathing. Her scalp tightened and she
  stared at the candle flame.</p>

  <p>The sly scrape of a stealthy step prickled her nape. She forced her gaze
  up from the wavering spark. An impalpable violet flame danced against a
  formless heap of rubbish in a far corner, where the roof-pitch joined the
  floor. Her light scarcely reached the black pile, but it was changing shape.
  Something was coming out from behind the mound, an ungainly shape. It was
  clear now, was moving slowly forward. It was a man...</p>

  <p>He crouched as he moved, and his head was thrust forward from burly,
  gorilla like shoulders. He advanced implacably toward the girl and, gripped
  in a nightmare paralysis, she could not move, could not scream. His face came
  into the candle glow.</p>

  <p>It was chalk-white, that face, save where dark pits marked the
  eye-sockets. Black ooze dripped from its matted hair, zigzagged across one
  bleached, hollow cheek, slid past one corner of a thick lipped mouth twisted
  in agony. Norma stared at the face and horror engulfed her. A soundless
  scream tore her throat.</p>

  <p>The face that was coming slowly, implacably toward her was the face of
  Jeefers! And Jeefers' stripped bones were out there where the storm howled,
  pressed into brown-black ooze.</p>

  <p>He came on, the man who was dead, A the man who should be dead but was
  not. He advanced inexorably toward her. Closer, closer, in an infinitely
  slow, an infinitely threatening progress that held her spellbound. Hot wax
  dripped on her fingers that held the candle, and still she was rigid. Only
  the irises of her eyes moved, widening. She could see <i>his</i> eyes now,
  fathomless dark pools of malevolence.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, now, those eyes seemed to burst into flame. Power of movement
  returned, Norma's hand jerked to thrust the candle into them.</p>

  <p>There was a thud behind her and fingers clutched her wrist&mdash;<i>from
  behind!</i> Jeefers leaped straight at her. She dodged, twisting to the new
  menace&mdash;wrenched away sprawling. The candle dropped, was
  gone&mdash;darkness swept in&mdash;and a muffled jar told her that Jeefers
  and the other had met.</p>

  <p>Norma was on her knees in the dark, and over her, unseen, they were
  fighting. She heard the impact of blows; she heard animal snarlings,
  deep-throated growls. She heard the rip of torn cloth, the confused pounding
  of quick-moving, shifting feet. A choked squeal came from one clamped,
  tortured throat. Trembling, she crawled away, crawled toward the trapdoor
  where stairs began that led down, away from this horror. Behind her a fist
  smacked against flesh. She reached the exit.</p>

  <p>Then she was fleeing; down the ladder, through a long dark hall, down
  interminable stairs. Wind and rain battered against the outer door, but she
  plunged to it, ripped it open. The storm roared in, tore at her. She plunged
  out into it, out of the house of terror, away from its menace. Her feet
  splashed ankle-deep into water where a lawn should be, ten thousand devils of
  the tempest howled about her, pounded at her. But she was in the open. She
  was out of the house. They could not find her here.</p>

  <p>Churning mud sucked at her stumbling feet. She fought the gale, reckless,
  uncaring. Where was she going? Where was there to go? Anywhere but back.
  Lightning tore open the black vault of the sky, filled the valley bowl with
  blue glare. Just ahead something sprawled in the water, the motionless body
  of a man.</p>

  <p>The lightning glare was quickly gone, but Norma was on her knees now; she
  was lifting a limp head out of the flood. The instant's illumination had
  shown her Ted's gray face looking sightlessly up from the storm-made morass.
  She hunched in the mire, drew Ted's head on her wet lap and forgot that the
  tempest was overwhelming her with its downpour.</p>

  <p>The girl's fingers fluttered over clammy cold skin. She moaned. She swayed
  forward, and her lips found his icy ones. Breath brushed her mouth. Not hers.
  <i>His!</i> Faintly, almost imperceptibly, he was breathing!</p>

  <p>With this realization warmth surged back into Norma's chilled veins. She
  tugged at Ted's heavy form, struggled to lift it, to drag it back to the
  house she had just fled in terror! For Ted she would go back&mdash;for warmth
  was there, a fire. Restoratives were there. What else was there did not
  matter now. Ted Stone must have warmth, stimulants, or the dim spark of his
  life would flicker out. Nowhere else was there help for him.</p>

  <p>But she could not move him. She was too weak. Despair, flooded her. Was
  Ted to die because she was a woman, because she had no strength? Was he to
  die here in the storm with shelter, warmth, only fifty feet away? She dug
  heels deep into the mud, tugged mightily. But the mud held its grip. She
  sobbed.</p>

  <p>A nimbus of light was around her. A tall black shape was at her side.
  "What is it, Norma? What are you doing?" Silas Sabin spoke quietly. His
  lantern moved and its luminance revealed Ted's sodden form. "Oh, I see. Is he
  hurt badly?"</p>

  <p>"Help me, Silas," Norma sobbed. "Help me get him inside." It was natural,
  somehow, that the old man should be there at her need. She did not question
  where he had been till now.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Sure thing." Silas didn't like Ted, but he was going to help him
  now. Of course. Silas had always been kind, good. He had always fixed her
  dolls when they were broken. "Here, hold these and I'll carry him in."</p>

  <p>He thrust the lantern into her hand. Something else gleamed in his other
  hand, something cold, metallic. Norma looked down at it and saw that it was a
  revolver. The realization that Silas was armed gave her comfort, seemed for
  an instant to cool her fevered brain through which scattered thoughts ran
  with the swift play of lightning. Yet&mdash;<i>would it do any good to shoot
  a ghost?</i></p>

  <p>Together they got Ted up to Silas' shoulder. It was easy enough for the
  two of them. With the old man leading the way with his burden, they started
  back toward the house where terror lurked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; TWO WHO WERE DOOMED</h2>

  <p class="first">INSIDE the only light was still from the fire. It danced
  redly around Juan's corpse on the floor, danced away as if frightened by his
  stiff figure. But Norma wasn't frightened, she told herself. There was no
  time for that. She had to help Silas take care of Ted. Prudence was
  frightened where she was tied to a chair.</p>

  <p>Her eyes showed that. Funny that Silas hadn't untied her. She must do it
  herself&mdash;as soon as Ted was all right again.</p>

  <p>Sabin put his burden down now. Ted's right arm hung limply down and water
  dripped from his fingers, made a pool on the floor. "I'll take his clothes
  off," the old man grunted. "You get hot water and a clean towel. There's some
  whisky in the kitchen too, in the medicine chest."</p>

  <p>Norma started off. "There ain't nobody out there," Silas called
  reassuringly, "an' you can leave the doors open. I can see you all the way."
  She saw that there was dried blood on his face, and a blue bruise.</p>

  <p>Norma had kept the lantern. Its light glinted yellow from the china closet
  in the dining room. She shoved a shoulder against the swinging door into the
  kitchen passage, fumbled for the foot catch that would hold it open. She
  couldn't find it at first, half-turned as her foot felt around. And then she
  saw that the parlor door was already closed!</p>

  <p>Silas had said not to close it; she must have done so from habit. She ran
  back, got it open. Silas was bending over Ted. His arm was up; the gun in it
  was held by the barrel, and the heavy butt was sweeping down at Ted's head.
  The old man was slugging Ted with his gun!</p>

  <p>Norma screamed. Her arm jerked, the lantern arced through the air. Its
  heavy base struck Sabin's shoulder and he staggered. The girl fairly flew
  across the room. Silas jerked toward her, and his clubbed gun rose to meet
  her. She clawed at his face, but he dodged. He struck at her and missed.
  Norma sprang again.</p>

  <p>Silas jabbed straight out and the gun butt caught her in the chest. She
  reeled backward, trying not to fall. The revolver was reversed in Sabin's
  hand now, its muzzle snouted at her. She struck the wall and saw death
  grimacing at her from the old man's eyes.</p>

  <p><i>"I wouldn't do that, Sabin, if I were you."</i> The thin voice was like
  a knife-edge. Silas twisted to the archway; Norma, clutching at the wall,
  looked too. John Smith bulked just within the curtains. The snout of an
  automatic was almost lost in one huge hand, but it held a rock steady aim
  pointblank at Silas' head. The man's little mouth was pursed, like one
  reproving an unruly child. His tiny eyes were glittering beads. "I think it
  would be quite unwise."</p>

  <p>Norma slid to the floor, half fainting, and looked at the lantern lying on
  its side. The flame had flicked out when she threw it and the chimney was
  dark. It was still hot and was scorching the carpet. Prudence would scold her
  for that...</p>

  <p>Silas was staring at the fat man. He was quivering with anger, was hoarse
  with it. "Point that gun away from me," he husked. "Let me finish the
  job."</p>

  <p>Smith's gigantic, obscene head moved slowly from side to side. "That isn't
  the way to do it."</p>

  <p>"But what can I do? She knows now. She won't keep quiet."</p>

  <p>Yes, Norma knew. She knew the kind old man she had trusted was a murderer.
  She knew he had been going to kill Ted, to shoot her. But why? Why?</p>

  <p>"If you weren't an old fool she'd never have known. Nobody would ever have
  known. We could have kept on indefinitely. But you had to hog the game. You
  wanted it all for yourself. Now you've started something and you don't know
  how to finish. If you keep on you'll smash the whole thing."</p>

  <p>Sabin's gun hand dropped to his side. The anger faded from his leathery
  face, despair replaced it. "It's smashed now."</p>

  <p>"No. If you're ready to give up and do as I say I can straighten it out.
  You can continue and we'll go right on. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>Norma listened, but could make nothing of this strange conversation. She
  knew dimly that it affected her. But her world had collapsed about her,
  physically and mentally she was utterly exhausted. She sat on the floor, her
  back against the wall, and stared straight ahead. Purely by accident she was
  looking at Ted. The gaping wound on his temple, raw and ugly, had stopped
  bleeding. The rain had washed it clean. A little color was seeping back into
  his cheeks.</p>

  <p>Sabin was speaking, slowly, ponderingly. "Maybe you can straighten it out.
  If you want to. But&mdash;Juan?"</p>

  <p>Smith shrugged. It was as if a mountain had heaved. "Juan doesn't bother
  me. He was getting troublesome and I'm glad to be rid of him. Why do you
  think I went out to the washroom, ostensibly, and left him alone? Do you
  think I didn't suspect you were planning something? I gave you your chance,
  and you took it. You confirmed my suspicions and put yourself in my power.
  How would you like to burn in the chair?"</p>

  <p>Silas licked white, dry lips. The revolver thudded from his nerveless
  fingers. "You&mdash;you did that! You let me kill your partner."</p>

  <p>"I hope you believe me. It's important for you. Because your only way out
  of the mess you are in is to do as I tell you. I can get along without you
  but I like the set-up here. I'm willing to go to some trouble to keep it as
  it is. That is your break. But I'll do it only if I can trust you. And I only
  trust a man when he is afraid of me and knows I am smarter than he is."</p>

  <p>"I believe you. God knows I'm afraid of you." It didn't need the old man's
  statement to make that clear...His eyes, his whole cringing attitude, showed
  it. "I'll do anything you say."</p>

  <p>For the first time the vast pink expanse of the man's face showed some
  expression. It was the merest ripple of fat-drowned muscles, but Norma knew
  it was gloating triumph. "All right," he squeaked. "The first thing is to tie
  up the girl. You did a good job on your wife; do as good a one on her."</p>

  <p>So it was Silas who had bound Prudence! Why, Norma wondered dully.</p>

  <p>His hands were almost gentle as he lifted the girl, put her in a chair and
  tied her with binder twine he dug out of his pocket. Too stupefied with fear
  and horror to resist, she let him lash her ankles to the chair's legs, her
  wrists to its arms. He was almost gentle, but the firelight was reflected in
  his bleared old eyes, and what Norma saw in them made her shudder. She
  remembered watching him butcher a calf once, long ago, and that same look had
  been in his eyes. She had run to her room and hidden under the bed. His
  kindness in the long years since had made her forget that, but she recalled
  it now.</p>

  <p>Oh God! It was old Silas who was tying her up with that look in his eyes!
  Old Silas who had been a father to her ever since her own dad died!</p>

  <p>She could still see Ted. The fire threw shadows over him and the way they
  danced made it seem that he was moving. Or had he moved, just a little? His
  face was no longer pale, which was certain. The man in the doorway saw that
  too, the man-mountain who stood there with the gun, still pointing. He spoke
  thinly: "Better make sure of the other one, Sabin."</p>

  <p>Silas crossed to Ted, reaching into his pocket for more twine. Norma came
  alive. "Don't," she tried to yell. "Don't touch him!" But she could make only
  inarticulate noises under the gag Sabin had shoved into her mouth.</p>

  <p>Her eyes shrieked mute protest as the old man worked grimly over the
  wounded, unconscious youth. He jerked him about with vicious enjoyment,
  grinning horribly. Norma threw herself forward, but the heavy chair held her.
  She slumped, staring at the gaunt old man, at the bulking, adipose
  Machiavelli who was watching heavily, without expression.</p>

  <p>That one was the worst. His very lack of emotion made him inhuman,
  terrifying. An almost palpable aura of evil seemed to flow about him, dark
  and hideous. It reached Norma and flowed around her, clammily cold despite
  the warmth of the fire. It was like the emanation from an opened tomb.</p>

  <p>"Very good, my dear Sabin. I do not think either of those will give you
  any more trouble."</p>

  <p>"Trouble! What's the good of all this? Tyin' 'em up ain't helpin' any.
  This guy's supposed to be in court in the morning and he won't be there.
  Someone will be along looking for him by noon."</p>

  <p>"They'll find him. I've been out. The creek's washed away the bridge down
  the road. His car is right there. In the morning it will be in the stream,
  and he will be inside. When he drove away from here last night it was dark
  and his headlights could not pierce the rain. He knew the road and drove fast
  anyway. He didn't see that the bridge was gone before it was too late."</p>

  <p>Unholy joy lit Sabin's face. "That's the ticket," he chuckled. "And Norma
  was with him. That will take care of both of them. You're smart."</p>

  <p>Horror rocked the girl as she shrank in the chair. They were going to kill
  Ted! They were going to kill Ted coldly, dispassionately, and leave his fine
  young body in the broiling, muddy waters. Smith's sourceless voice was
  mocking. "I'm smart and you'd better let me do the thinking. What good is it
  going to do you if the girl is dead?" Silas' expression changed, his jaw
  dropped. "If it is <i>known</i> that she is dead?"</p>

  <p>"But...What then...? She..."</p>

  <p>"We'll attend to her. But not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The fat man's tiny, glittering eyes flicked suddenly to Prudence. She was
  bent forward as far as her lashings would permit, listening avidly. There was
  rage in her face, and determination. Smith looked at Sabin thoughtfully. Then
  he seemed to come to a decision. "Come here," he said. "I'll tell you about
  it outside."</p>

  <p>The curtain dropped behind them. The fire threw lurid light and black,
  flickering shadows across the corpse on the floor. Ted's eyelids fluttered
  open. He groaned and tried to move. His startled eyes found her and
  realization flared into them, helpless horror.</p>

  <p>From the entry a sibilant hissing came, a horrible chuckle.</p>

  <p>There was a long vertical line in the wall alongside the mantle that had
  not been there before. It widened, slowly. Norma heard the soft grate of a
  sliding panel. She saw a hand on the edge of the moving panel, a
  blood-smeared hand. The aperture grew. A resinous knot caught in a blazing
  log, jetted long flame into the room. A crouched dark figure was coming out
  of the wall, its face chalk-white, a thin stream of dried blood streaking
  down from matted hair, touching one corner of thick lips that were
  tight-pressed and grim. The other hand came into view and there was a knife
  in it, a knife that gleamed in the firelight.</p>

  <p>The phantom glided out from the niche where it had appeared, the niche
  Norma did not know existed though she had been born in this house. Its
  progress made no sound on the soft carpeting, but her horror-struck eyes saw
  that the left foot was turned outward; unnaturally, dreadfully. She forced
  herself to look at its arms. Yes, the one in which the knife was clutched was
  shorter than the other. Her last hope, her last hold on reason, died within
  her. The figure did not have Jeefers' face by a chance resemblance. It
  <i>was</i> Jeefers. <i>It was the handyman who was dead, whose skeleton lay
  on the creek bank!</i></p>

  <p>It was at her side. The sunken eyes were alive with strange, crawling
  fires. The knife rose, poised above her. She closed her own eyes and waited
  for the death stroke. Better this, perhaps, than the fate those other two
  were scheming. A small voice within her brain piped a childish prayer. "Our
  Father who art in Heaven..."</p>

  <p>Norma felt a tug at her right wrist, her left. She jerked a hand, and it
  was loose, free. Her eyes flashed open. Jeefers was kneeling, was slashing
  away the twine binding her ankles&mdash;His gory face turned up to her and a
  horrible grin seemed painted across it. He heaved erect, and jerked his head
  toward the secret door. Norma stared at him wide-eyed, uncomprehending. Again
  he motioned to the dark aperture, commandingly.</p>

  <p>The girl twisted to her sweetheart, gaunt-faced on the sofa. She pointed
  to him, and the being of whose reality she was still uncertain nodded. It
  crossed the floor in that awful silent glide and slung Ted to its shoulder.
  It gestured once more to the dark, rectangular hole in the wall. Norma forced
  her prickling legs to move, got to it, passed within. She glimpsed stone
  steps diving steeply into darkness. As she started down there was a grating
  sound behind her and there was no more light.</p>

  <p>A dank, musty smell was in her nostrils, mixed with a pungent odor and a
  heavy, sickeningly sweet aroma. There was no following sound. It seemed that
  she was descending into a tomb, a tomb where a dead man had found the
  semblance of life; a man, dead-alive, who was luring her to his sepulcher for
  some foul purpose. Panic swept upon her like an obscene, giant bat from the
  blackness and the strength went from her limbs. She stopped, groped for
  support against the rough stone wall of the passage.</p>

  <p>From somewhere she got strength to continue. The stairs ended, gave place
  to a level floor. Her heels clicked as she moved forward, not knowing what
  else to do, and somehow the sound told her she was in a confined space. She
  brushed against something unyielding, felt for it, found metal under her
  hands, a geared wheel. It was as dark as the inside of a tar barrel here,
  silent as the grave. Then there was the rasp of cloth against cloth, and the
  soft thud of a lowered body; Ted's. She tried to say something, was reminded
  of the gag in her mouth. She lifted her hands to loosen it.</p>

  <p>And on the instant she felt rough fingers grasp them; pull them swiftly,
  resistlessly, behind her back!</p>

  <p>She struggled, yet almost before it dawned on her what was happening she
  was bound again, hand and foot, was lifted and laid on the unyielding cement
  floor. Some harsh cloth was pushed under her head to serve as a pillow. Then
  the unseen hands left her.</p>

  <p>Here, with her ears close to the ground, she could distinguish the soft,
  sibilant hiss of the phantom's catlike tread. It moved away in what she
  thought must be the direction of the stairs. Then trampling on the wood floor
  above obscured the sound, footsteps that were carpet muffled yet quite
  distinct. She could make out two sets, one much heavier than the other. These
  must be Smith and Silas coming back into the parlor. The sounds stopped
  suddenly, and she pictured vividly the consternation on the faces of the
  unholy pair as they found their victims gone.</p>

  <p>What would happen now? Prudence Sabin was still in the room up there. She
  had seen where they had gone, would she tell? Apparently she was not involved
  in her husband's nefarious actions, had objected to them. Otherwise she would
  not have been bound. Would she keep the secret?</p>

  <p>A piercing vibration answered her question, a scream so high-pitched that
  it penetrated to the enclave where Norma lay. A scream, and then came the
  babbling, thin sound of an old woman's voice; a frightened old woman's voice.
  Norma shuddered. Prudence had not wanted to tell, but they had made her.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl heard the panel grate open. A dim oblong of red light
  appeared directly above her, the reflection of firelight on a low ceiling. A
  crouched black shadow was visible in that oblong; another shadow cut its
  side.</p>

  <p>Then a black arm rose out of the confused mass, an arm at the end of which
  the shadow of a knife showed. Norma saw that for only an instant, as it swept
  back into the mass.</p>

  <p>A gun cracked sharply. Blackness slid back across the ceiling. A burbling,
  agonized scream sounded, and Norma heard the heavy thud of a falling body.
  Then there was silence again, heavy, ominous silence.</p>

  <p>Which had gone home, knife or bullet, which had evoked that scream? The
  girl strained her ears, listening. Then she smiled, bitterly. Whoever won,
  apparently, it would make no difference to her or to Ted. All hands were
  against them, all the ruthless, cruel hands in this storm-isolated house of
  terror.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE TORTURE CHAMBER</h2>

  <p class="first">HEAVY footsteps went slowly across the ceiling. Smith, at
  least, was still alive. But he was retreating. For the sound of his steps
  died away. A door slammed. Then, from a distance, there was a rasping whir of
  an automobile starter, a series of pops, the screech of brakes, and the
  diminishing sound of a departing motor.</p>

  <p>Someone was breathing, stertorously, at the stair-head. A striking match
  ripped the stillness and its tiny light almost blinded her. A candle took the
  flame.</p>

  <p>Jeefers swayed, up there against rough board panels, as he held the
  candle, and his grisly countenance was more fearsome than before for the
  black gash of a bullet that had seared across his pain-tightened brow. He
  started down, step by careful step, and the light descended with him,
  descended into a small, stonewalled room. Its feeble rays illuminated a
  curious machine, all wheels and gears, the nature of which Norma could not
  determine. It showed a wooden closet against one wall, fastened by a huge
  padlock. It reached the floor finally, and showed Ted, still bound and
  gagged, limp and white on gray stone.</p>

  <p>The handyman made his agonized way to Norma's side. He stood above her
  swaying. Then, slowly, gropingly, he set the candle down on a projecting edge
  of the machine. He fumbled inside his torn jacket, produced a flat flask, put
  it to his lips, and drank from it. His gaunt form shuddered. Then he turned,
  and, moving a little more certainly, passed around behind the machine,
  reappeared dragging a decrepit, stained wooden chair.</p>

  <p>He set it down, lifted Norma to it. He groped in a pocket, brought out a
  roll of the same binder twine that Sabin had used. He passed a length of it
  about the girl's waist and fastened it so that she was bound to the chair.
  Then he picked at the knot around her wrists, untied it.</p>

  <p>Norma was placed so that the machine was at her left. At almost the height
  of her shoulders there was a level metal plate of some sort. There was
  another about six inches above this, suspended from a long, threaded rod that
  passed through a heavy cast-iron bracket, and above the bracket a horizontal
  wheel was attached to the top of the worm.</p>

  <p>Grisly horror shuddered through the girl as Jeefers' harsh fingers clamped
  about her left arm and pulled it across the lower plate. He held it there and
  his other hand manipulated the wheel. It revolved, and the upper plate came
  slowly down till Norma's arm was caught between the two, caught so firmly
  that tug as she might she could not extricate it. But the slow turning of the
  wheel stopped there, stopped just short of crushing.</p>

  <p>The man leered at her. Then he glided away, somewhere behind her. Ted was
  behind her too, and she could only stare wide-eyed at a bare stone wall and
  see pictures of horror crawl across it. Jeefers was back. There was a long
  sheet of foolscap in his hand, and a pen. The candlelight caught a drop of
  ink on the nib, and it gleamed greenly. Jeefers put the pen in her right
  hand; instinctively her fingers closed about it. He held the paper where she
  could reach it. Then he spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Sign it," he husked, and his tone was the hoarse, rumbling voice of a
  nightmare. "Sign it, or I'll turn the wheel."</p>

  <p>Norma focused her eyes on the document. Scrawled writing in fresh green
  ink danced across the white paper. But she could make out a date, three days
  before. Words, incredible words: "To Train Jeefers...my house and lands at
  Lloyd Corners in the County of...bounded by...to have and to hold..." It
  was a deed! A deed to the house and farm dad had left her. Her house and
  farm!</p>

  <p>Suddenly she was clear minded. The horrible night began to take on
  meaning. There was something in the house, unknown to her, that was valuable.
  They had been battling over it, Sabin, and Jeefers, and Smith. They had been
  fighting among themselves, but the venom of their combat had involved
  her.</p>

  <p>Her brain raced. Smith could only control the house through Silas. But
  Silas' domination here was almost at an end; in a month she would be married
  to Ted, and it was certain that Stone's first act would be to get rid of the
  old man. From the beginning they had disliked one another. That was why Sabin
  had wanted to kill Ted.</p>

  <p>But Smith's plans had been more devious. If Norma disappeared, vanished
  without trace, the property would be held in the courts. Someone would have
  to take care of it, and who more logical than Sabin? For seven years, until
  she could be declared legally dead, his control would be undisputed. Her skin
  crawled as she realized what it must have been that the fat man had been
  whispering to Sabin out in the entry.</p>

  <p>What was it that these man-wolves ravened to hold? It must be in this
  room, this hidden room.</p>

  <p>Jeefers, working alone, had won. Would win if she signed this deed. But
  she could upset the document. Duress voided any signature. Ted had taught her
  enough law for that. Jeefers must know it too. Of course he did&mdash;<i>and
  if she signed the deed he would not dare leave her and Ted alive!</i></p>

  <p>All this flashed through her mind in a fraction of time. "Sign it,"
  Jeefers husked again. "Sign or I'll twist."</p>

  <p>Norma shook her head. If she signed she would be signing her death
  warrant, and Ted's. Eventually, perhaps, she would be forced to do it. She
  was a woman and could not resist torture. But she would fight. Maybe
  something would happen. Something <i>must</i> happen. God wouldn't let Ted
  die. Nor her. She would fight as long as she could and pray for delivery. She
  shook her head, unspeaking.</p>

  <p>Fury contorted Jeefers' tortured countenance, and his mouth twisted,
  horribly. He got his gnarled hands on the wheel and turned it, slowly. More
  slowly still the upper plate of the press moved down. Its edge bit into
  Norma's skin, and crushing agony screamed in the bones of her forearm. Her
  finger-tips, beyond the press, were swollen with dammed blood.</p>

  <p>"Will you sign?" the man grunted, and his face blurred before Norma's
  burning eyes. She shook her head, and his hands sought the wheel again.</p>

  <p>A throaty bellow exploded behind her. A figure, gaunt and horrible, leaped
  past her and a fist crashed against Jeefers' thick lipped mouth. The room
  whirled dizzily around Norma, nausea retched her, and oblivion engulfed
  her.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"NORMA! Norma dear."</p>

  <p>Her arm hurt. It hurt terribly. And her head. But warm lips were pressed
  against her own. A familiar, dear voice cried in her ears, "Norma!" She
  answered the kiss and her eyes opened. Ted's face wavered in front of her.
  Blood dripped from the reopened wound in his temple. A bruise was darkening
  on his cheek, and his lips were pulped, flecked with red. But his frantic
  eyes devoured her. She reached her good arm out and pulled him close to her.
  For a moment all the horrors of the horrible night were lost in a long
  kiss.</p>

  <p>He drew away. "Norma, dear. Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>She smiled wanly. "I&mdash;I'm all right, dear; just my arm. But what,
  what happened?" Her glance strayed past him. She saw Jeefers' body,
  contorted, prone and motionless on the floor. A dark pool gathered slowly
  near his head.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't as unconscious as I seemed. I came to while Sabin and the fellow
  who called himself Smith were talking. Silas hadn't been very careful how he
  tied me; he probably thought I was out of the picture, and they didn't notice
  that I was working at the cords while I lay there. I had them almost off my
  wrists when Jeefers appeared, but passed out again when he threw me over his
  shoulder, and woke up just as he started his performance with the press. I
  had to move carefully so that he wouldn't notice me, and it took me a little
  time to get free."</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead. Yes. He was pretty badly hurt anyway, and when I jumped him he was
  no match for me, though I'm no prize package myself right now. He got in one
  or two good slugs, but then I tripped him and he hit his head against the
  side of the machine. That finished him."</p>

  <p>"Thank God. Oh, thank God! But Ted, what is the machine. What is it all
  about?"</p>

  <p>"It's a hand printing press, like the one artists use for etchings, only
  larger. There's a copper plate in it, a beautifully executed engraving of
  Uncle Sam's best ten dollar bill."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then they were counterfeiters!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. This was an ideal spot for them to work, isolated, easily guarded.
  All traffic has to come over Oak Mountain and the pass can be watched from
  here in time to clean up any traces. Sabin must have built this hidden room
  and staircase after your father died, must have been making a good thing of
  it for years. No wonder he objected to my hanging around.</p>

  <p>"I see it all now. Smith was the one who started Silas on it, must have
  been the distributor. Then a lot of things came at once. Jeefers must have
  found out about it, and maybe he started blackmailing Silas. I was engaged to
  you; Silas would lose his place here in a month. And some kind of dispute
  sprang up between him and Smith's gang. The storm drove us all in here and he
  started out to kill us all, so he would be left with everything in his hands.
  The others fought back..."</p>

  <p>Everything clicked in place. The lurker on the second floor, the one who
  had seized her from behind in the attic had been Silas. Silas was not in
  sight when she started up the stairs. Jeefers, previously attacked, and left
  up there for dead, had come to in time to fight Sabin and save her. Then he
  had conceived his own scheme for seizing the house and the outfit for making
  bad money. The storm had given them all the opportunity...</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it. But let's get out of here."</p>

  <p>The candle gave them sufficient light to climb the stairs. Ted found the
  catch that released the panel giving access to the parlor. When it opened
  yellow light told them the current was on again. They stepped out...and
  stopped short at what they saw...</p>

  <p>"How do you do?" a thin piping voice sliced across the silence. "I
  couldn't discover how to open that thing, so I've been waiting for someone to
  come up."</p>

  <p>Smith was seated, comfortably, in the fireside chair where Norma had first
  seen him. His hands rested on his trunk like knee, and the little automatic
  snouted at them threateningly.</p>

  <p>Norma froze. "What do <i>you</i> want here?" Ted snapped. "We heard
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go away. Yes, I did that to fool whichever of you might be still alive
  when the proceedings down there finished. I coasted back, and waited."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Two things. First, the plates down there that Juan etched. They are the
  most perfect that have ever been made and in the circumstances cannot be
  replaced. The second is your silence. This little toy will take care of the
  latter and clear the way to the first. You can have two minutes to say your
  farewells..."</p>

  <p>The huge, lascivious bulk of him was a mountain of evil as it overflowed
  the chair. There was no emotion on the blank hugeness of his face, neither
  triumph nor mercy. His tiny eyes flicked over Norma and seemed to strip the
  clothes from her. "Too bad the little lady must die."</p>

  <p>Norma whimpered; white-faced and half fainting, unable longer to hold
  herself together, she slid to the floor. As she lay there in a crumpled heap,
  her hand touched the slumped, bloody body of Silas that lay there. Her
  fingers closed about the handle of Jeefers' knife that was plunged in his
  breast. The feel of it seemed to bring back in a rush her fast-fading
  consciousness. In the knife lay salvation&mdash;for herself and for Ted.
  Seemingly in one motion, she pulled it out and hurled it straight at
  Smith!</p>

  <p>The distance was short, and desperation lent strength and direction to her
  arm. The knife point hit first, hit the counterfeiter's throat and ploughed
  in. The automatic spat but its aim was wild. Ted left his feet in a flying
  lunge, and his fist crashed into the fat, obscene face. But his effort was
  unneeded. Blood burbled from the fat man's lips, and he was a limp mound of
  jelly-like protoplasm in the chair. The gang that had invaded Hidden Valley
  was wiped out at last.</p>

  <p>Outside, with a last rumble of thunder the storm ended. Ted pulled the
  shades up. A clear washed sun peeped over the edge of Oak Mountain, and
  somewhere the crow of a rooster greeted him.</p>

  <p>Norma looked up from Prudence, whose cold hands she had been chafing. Her
  brow was puckered. "But, Ted. Whose skeleton was it that we stumbled over on
  the creek bank?"</p>

  <p>The young man turned to her. "Nothing mysterious about that, dear. I
  thought of it while we were running for the house, but I couldn't have made
  myself heard above the howling of the wind, and afterwards, Lord knows, I had
  no chance to tell you. I was looking over some old records at the county
  office not long ago, and there was one report that rather interested me. It
  told of the search for a man who disappeared twenty years ago, somewhere here
  in Hidden Valley. He was crippled, deformed&mdash;and his name was Elmer
  Jeefers. He must have been Train Jeefers' father."</p>
