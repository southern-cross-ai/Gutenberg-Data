DEAR SIR RODERICK,
You have kindly permitted me to dedicate to you this result of my
investigations respecting the early explorations of Australia.
To none can a book on such a subject be more appropriately offered
than to yourself. To you geographers are pre-eminently indebted for
the promotion of Australian exploration in recent times, while your
ever-memorable scientific anticipation of the discovery of the
Australian gold fields must connect your name inseparably with the
history of a country, whose future greatness can be foreseen,
but cannot be estimated.

I remain,
DEAR SIR RODERICK,
With much respect,
Yours very faithfully,
R. H. MAJOR.

<h3><a name="ch-01"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>When, at a period comparatively recent in the world's history, the
discovery was made that, on the face of the as yet unmeasured ocean,
there existed a western continent which rivalled in extent the world
already known, it became a subject of natural enquiry whether a fact
of such momentous importance could for so many thousands of years
have remained a secret. Nor was the enquiry entirely without
response. Amid the obscurity of the past some faint foreshadowings of
the great reality appeared to be traceable. The poet with his
prophecy, the sage with his mystic lore, and the unlettered seaman
who, with curious eye, had peered into the mysteries of the
far-stretching Atlantic, had each, as it now appeared enunciated a
problem which at length had met with its solution<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>In these later days, when the enquiry has assumed gigantic
proportions, and the facilities of investigation</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Reference is here made, 1stly, to that most
remarkable and often quoted passage from the <i>Medea</i> of
Seneca:<br>
<br>
<i>Venient annis<br>
Saecula seris, quibus Oceanus</i><br>
<br>
2ndly, to the island of Atlantis, described by Plato, in the Timaeus,
as lying in the Atlantic, opposite the Pillars of Hercules, and
exceeding in size the whole of Africa and Asia.<br>
<br>
And 3rdly, to the imaginary island of St. Brandan, seen at intervals
far out in the Atlantic by the inhabitants of the Canary Islands.<br>
<br>
It may not be unacceptable here to mention that there is one passage
among the writings of the ancients far more minute and affirmative in
its description than any of the foregoing, which has been thought by
various learned commentators to refer to America, but which the
editor has not found hitherto quoted, in that light, by any English
author. In a fragment of the works of Theopompus, preserved by
Aelian, is the account of a conversation between Silenus and Midas,
king of Phrygia, in which the former says that Europe, Asia, and
Africa, were lands surrounded by the sea; but that beyond this known
world was another island, of immense extent, of which he gives a
description. The account of this conversation, which is too lengthy
here to give in full, was written three centuries and a half before
the Christian era. Not to trouble the reader with Greek, we give an
extract from the English version by Abraham Fleming, printed in 1576,
in the amusingly quaint but vivid language of the time.<br>
<br>
"THE THIRDE BOOKE OF AELIANUS. PAGE 37.<br>
<br>
&para; Of the familiaritie of Midas the Phrigian, and Selenus, and of
certaine circumstances which he incredibly reported.<br>
<br>
"Theopompus declareth that Midas the Phrygian and Selenus were knit
in familiaritie and acquaintance. This Selenus was the sonne of a
nymphe inferiour to the gods in condition and degree, but superiour
to men concerning mortalytie and death. These twaine mingled
communication of sundrye thinges. At length, in processe of talke,
Selenus tolde Midas of certaine ilandes, named Europia, Asia, and
Libia, which the ocean sea circumscribeth and compasseth round about;
and that without this worlde there is a continent or percell of dry
lande, which in greatnesse (as hee reported) was infinite and
unmeasurable; that it nourished and maintained, by the benefite of
the greene medowes and pasture plots, sundrye bigge and mighty
beastes; that the men which inhabite the same climats exceede the
stature of us twise, and yet the length of there life is not equall
to ours; that there be many and diuers great citties, manyfold orders
and trades of living; that their lawes, statutes, and ordinaunces,
are different, or rather clean contrary to ours. Such and lyke
thinges dyd he rehearce."<br>
<br>
The remainder of this curious conversation, however apparently
fabulous, deserves attention from the thoughtful
reader.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: ii}</u></p>

<p>have been simultaneously increased, much has been done towards
bringing to light the evidence of various ascertained or possible
visitations from the Old World to the New, which had previously
remained unknown. A summary of them has already been laid before the
members of the Hakluyt Society by the editor of the present volume,
in his introduction to the "Select Letters of Columbus", and requires
no repetition here.</p>

<p>Of the future results of that momentous discovery, what human
intelligence can foresee the climax? Already the northern half of
that vast portion of the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: iii}</u></p>

<p>globe is mainly occupied by a section of the Anglo-Saxon family,
earnest and active in the development of its native energies; and
among these, again, are many who look back with eager curiosity to
every yet minuter particular respecting the early history of their
adopted country.</p>

<p>A new field of colonization, second only to that of America, and
constituting, as far as is at present known, the largest island in
our globe, has in far more recent times been opened up by a slow
and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: iv}</u></p>

<p>gradual progress to a branch of the same expansive family. A
future but little inferior in importance may, without much
imaginative speculation, be assigned to them, and from them likewise
may be reasonably expected the most curious inquiry as to the
earliest discoveries by their predecessors of a land so vast in its
dimensions, so important in its characteristics, and yet so little
known or reasoned upon by the numerous generations of mankind that
has passed away before them.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to meet this demand it must be premised, that
while the main object proposed in this volume is to treat of the
early indications of the island now recognised as Australia, anterior
to the time of Captain Cook, it is impossible to deal with the real
or supposed discoveries which may have taken place prior to that
date, without referring at the same time to the discovery of the
adjacent island of New Guinea and of the great southern continent, of
both of which what we now call Australia was in those times regarded
as forming a part. The investigation is one of the most interesting
character in all stages, but beset with doubts and difficulties
arising from a variety of causes.</p>

<p>The entire period up to the time of Dampier, ranging over two
centuries, presents these two phases of obscurity; that in the
sixteenth century (the period of the Portuguese and Spanish
discoveries) there are <i>indications</i> on maps of the great
probability of Australia having been already discovered; while in
the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: v}</u></p>

<p>seventeenth century there is documentary evidence that its coasts
were touched upon or explored by a considerable number of Dutch
voyages but the documents <i>immediately</i> describing these voyages
have not been found.</p>

<p>That, in so far as regards the Portuguese, this obscurity is
mainly due to jealous apprehension lest lands of large extents, and
great importance in the southern seas might fall into the hands of
rival powers to their own displacement or prejudice, may not only be
suspected, but seems to be affirmable from historical evidence.</p>

<p>It is stated by Humboldt (<i>Histoire de la Geographie du Nouveau
Continent</i>, tom. iv, p. 70), upon the authority of the letters of
Angelo Trevigiano, secretary to Domenico Pisani, ambassador from
Venice to Spain, that the kings of Portugal forbad upon pain of death
the exportation of any marine chart which showed the course to
Calicut. We find also in Ramusio (<i>Discorso sopra el libro di
Odoardo Barbosa</i>, and the <i>Sommario delle Indie Orientali</i>,
tom. i, p. 287 b) a similar prohibition implied. He says that these
books "were for many years concealed and not allowed to be published,
for convenient reasons that I must not now describe". He also speaks
of the great difficulty he himself had in procuring a copy, and even
that an imperfect one, from Lisbon. "Tanto possono," he says, "gli
interessi del principe." Again, in tom. iii of the same collection,
in the account of the "Discorso d'un gran Capitano del Mare Francese
del Luogo di Dieppa," etc., now known as the voyage of Jean</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: vi}</u></p>

<p>Parmentier to Sumatra in 1529, and in all probability by his
companion and eulogist, the poet Pierre Crignon, the covetousness and
exclusiveness of the Portuguese are inveighed against. "They seem,"
he says, "to have drunk of the dust of the heart of king Alexander,
for that they seem to think that God made the sea and the land for
them, and that if they could have locked up the sea from Finisterre
to Ireland it would have been done long ago," etc.</p>

<p>Imputations of a similar nature are thrown on the Dutch East India
Company by so well informed a man as Sir William Temple, ambassador
at the Hague in the reign of Charles II, and who is a very high
authority on all matters concerning the republic of the United
Provinces. In his "Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning," he makes
the following curious statement, which we give <i>in extenso</i> as
otherwise bearing upon the subject of which we treat. See vol. iii of
Sir William Temple's <i>Works</i>, p. 457.</p>

<p>"But the defect or negligence [in the progress of discovery since
the invention of the compass] seems yet to have been greater towards
the south, where we know little beyond 35&deg; and that only by the
necessity of doubling the Cape of Good Hope in our East India
voyages: yet a continent has long since been found out within 15&deg;
to the south, about the length of Java, which is marked by the name
of New Holland in the maps, and to what extent none knows, either, to
the south, the east, or</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: vii}</u></p>

<p>the west; yet the learned have the opinion, that there must be a
balance of earth on that side of the line in some proportion to what
there is on the other; and that it cannot be all sea from 30&deg; to
the south pole, since we have found land to above 65&deg;, towards
the north. But our navigators that way have been confined to the
roads of trade, and our discoveries bounded by what we can manage to
a certain degree of gain. <i>And I have heard it said among the
Dutch</i>, that their East India Company have long since forbidden,
and under the greatest penalty any further attempts of discovering
that continent, having already more trade in those parts than they
can turn to account, and fearing some more populous nation of Europe
might make great establishments of trade in some of those unknown
regions, which might ruin or impair what they have already in the
Indies."</p>

<p>Although the statement of so well informed and so impartial man as
Sir William might almost be considered as conclusive, the Dutch have
very naturally been unwilling to abide by this severe judgement. An
indignant remonstrance against the imputation that they secreted and
suppressed the accounts of their early voyages, was published in
August 1824, in vol. ii of <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>, by
Mr. J. van Wijck Roelandszoon, who attributed the origin of this
charge to ignorance of the Dutch language on the part of those who
made it. In vindication of his assertions he referred to the
publication, in 1618, of Linschoten's voyages, both to the North</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: viii}</u></p>

<p>and the East Indies, also Schouten and Lemaire's "Circumnavigation
of the Globe" in 1615-18, which was published in 1646. He referred to
the fact that the voyages of Van Noort, l'Hermite, and Spilbergen had
also, been published, and stated that, generally speaking, such had
been the case with all the voyages of the Dutch as early as the year
1646, and that their discoveries were exactly laid down in the 1660
edition of the maps of P. Goos.</p>

<p>He furthermore announced (in reply to an invitation which had been
given to the learned men of Holland, to fill up the gaps in their
history which had been complained of), that one of the learned
societies of Holland had offered a prize for a careful essay on the
discoveries of the Dutch mariners.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>In publishing this remonstrance, the editor of the <i>Nouvelles
Annales des Voyages</i> judiciously observed, that if the reproach of
jealousy which applied to the Portuguese, did not apply to the Dutch,
it was at least true that some sort of carelessness had prevented
either the preservation or the publication of a great number of Dutch
narratives, amongst which he quoted those of De Nuyts, Van Vlaming,
etc., to the coasts of New Holland. We must not, however, lose sight
of the fact, that Sir William Temple's charge of want</p>

<blockquote>[*1) With respect to the essay for which the learned
society referred to (the Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen of
Utrecht) had offered a prize, it was published in that society's
<i>Transactions</i> in 1827, under the title of " Bennet and Van
Wijck's Verhandeling over de Nederlandsche Ontdekkingen." The editor,
who has examined this work carefully, can state that it supplies no
information in addition to that which we had already
possessed.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: ix}</u></p>

<p>of liberality is directed, not against the Dutch in general, but
only against the East India Company; and further, that it contains
two different imputations; first, that the Company forbade
exploration; and secondly, that they prohibited the publication of
those already made.</p>

<p>As to the first of these two charges it may have been just. The
commercial spirit of the seventeenth century had a general character
of narrowness, from which the East India Company was not exempt. The
conduct here imputed to them was in accordance with the regular and
wholesale destruction of spices, by which they tried to keep up the
value of this commodity. Too much importance, however, ought not to
be attached even to Sir William's testimony, when, as in the present
case, it stands entirely alone. Every hostile statement with regard
to the Dutch East India Company made in Sir William's time, may be
regarded as at least likely to have been dictated by party spirit.
The directors of the East India Company were so closely connected
with the ruling but unpopular party presided over by the De Witts,
that the enemy of the one was also the enemy of the others, and,
among these enemies were a number of the most eminent men, many of
them distinguished geographers.</p>

<p>As to the second charge, it must be allowed in justice to the
Company, that such secrecy as is here imputed to them is not to be
traced in their general conduct. Commelyn, the compiler of the
celebrated <i>Begin ende Voortgangh</i>, published in 1646, had</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: x}</u></p>

<p>undoubtedly access to the Company's archives, and he discloses
many facts which the Company would seem much more interested to hide
than what meagre knowledge they possessed of Australia; Godfried,
Udemans, Dr. 0. Dapper, Witsen, Valentyn, and besides these a host of
map-makers and geographers, were largely indebted to the Company for
geographical materials. If we may form any judgement from the
dedications we find in books of the period, we must consider their
encouragement of the study of their dominions as almost on a par with
that afforded at the present day by the English East India
Company.</p>

<p>The fact that many accounts of Australian voyages which the
Company possessed were never published, may be accounted for in a
simpler and more honourable manner. The Dutch voyages and travels
that were published were plainly intended for a large circle of
readers, and were got up as cheaply as possible. Thus, though
thousands and thousands of copies were sold, they have all now become
scarce. A voyage which did not contain strange adventures or striking
scenes, had no chance of popularity and so it remained unpublished.
Thus, among other instances, a picturesque account of Japan was
published in, the <i>Begin ende Voortgangh</i>, whilst the extremely
important account of De Vries's voyage to the same part of the world,
which is far richer in geographical materials than in interesting
incidents, has remained in manuscript till recently edited by Captain
Leupe, of the Dutch navy.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xi}</u></p>

<p>It is with pleasure that we indulge the hope that the veil which
has thus hung over those valuable materials is likely, before very
long, to be entirely removed. The archives of the Dutch East India
Company, a yet unsifted mass of thousands of volumes, and myriads of
loose papers, have a short time since been handed over to the State
Archives at the Hague, where the greatest liberality is shown in
allowing access to the treasures they possess. Meanwhile, the editor
of the present volume need hardly plead any excuse for not having
attempted what no foreigner be his stay in Holland ever so long,
could possibly expect to accomplish; and he must leave to those who
will take up this matter after him, the satisfaction of availing
themselves of materials the importance of which he knows, and the
want of which he deeply deplores.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, in the earlier and more indistinct
periods of Australian discovery even when some portions of the vast
island had been already lighted on, it remained a doubt whether New
Guinea and the newly seen lands did not form part of a great southern
continent, in which tradition in the first place and subsequent
discoveries, had already established a belief.</p>

<p>The very existance of the belief in an extensive southern
continent at those early periods presents a twofold cause of doubt.
It engendered <i>at the time</i> the supposition that every island to
the south of what was previously known, and of which the north part
only had been seen, formed a portion of that continent;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xii}</u></p>

<p>while <i>to us</i> who, from this distance of time look back for
evidence, the inaccurate representation of such discoveries on maps,
in or near the longitude of Australia (for longitude could be but
laxly noticed in those days) leaves the doubt whether that continent
may not have been visited at the period thus represented. Hence,
manifestly, it will be requisite to bear well in mind this broadly
accepted belief in the existence of a great southern continent, if we
would form a right judgement respecting those supposed indications of
Australia which are presented on maps of the sixteenth and beginning
of the seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>Among the very early writers, the most striking quotation that the
editor has lighted upon in connection with the southern continent, is
that which occurs in the <i>Astronomicon</i> of Manilius, lib. i,
lin. 234 <i>et seq</i>., where, after a lengthy dissertation, he
says:--</p>

<pre>
"Ex quo colligitur terrarum forma rotunda:
Hanc circum variae gentes hominum atque ferarum,
Aeriaeque colunt volueres. Pars ejus ad aretos
Eminet, <i>Austrinis pars est habitabilis oris</i>,
<i>Sub pedibusque jacet nostris</i>."
</pre>

<p>The latter clause of this sentence, so strikingly applying to the
lands in question, has been quoted as a motto for the title-page of
this volume. The date at which Manilius wrote, though not exactly
ascertained, is supposed, upon the best conclusions to be drawn from
the internal evidence supplied by his poem, to be of the time of
Tiberius.</p>

<p>Aristotle also, in his <i>Meteorologica</i>, lib. ii, cap. 5,
has</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xiii}</u></p>

<p>a passage which, though by no means distinct as the preceding one
speaks of two segments of the <i>habitable</i> globe, one towards the
north, the other, towards the south pole, and which have the form of
a drum. Aratus, Strabo, and Geminus have also handed down a similar
opinion, that the torrid zone was occupied throughout its length by
the ocean, and that the band of sea divided our continent from
another, situated, as they suppose, in the southern hemisphere.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[*]</b></p>

<p>To come down, however, to a later period, the editor is enabled
through the researches of his lamented friend, the late learned and
laborious Vicomte de Santarem, to show from early manuscript maps and
other geographical monuments, how this belief in the existence of a
great southern continent was entertained anterior to the discoveries
of the Portuguese in the Pacific Ocean. In his <i>Essai sur
l'Histoire de la Cosmographie et de la Cartographie du Moyen Age</i>,
vol. i, p. 229, the Vicomte informs us that "Certain cartographers of
the middle ages, still continue to represent the <i>Antichthone</i>
in their maps of the world in accordance with the belief that, beyond
the ocean of Homer, there was an inhabited country, another temperate
region, called the "opposite earth", which it was impossible to
reach, principally on account of the torrid zone.</p>

<p>"The following are the maps of the world which represent this
theory:--</p>

<blockquote>[*1) See Aratus, Phaenom., 537; Strabo, 1. 7, p. 130, and

<p>"The cartographers of the middle ages have admitted that as a
reality which, even to the geographers of antiquity, was merely a
theory."</p>

<p>The earliest <i>assertion</i> of the discovery of a land bearing a
position on early maps analogous to that of Australia has been made
in favour of the Chinese, who have been supposed to have been
acquainted with its coasts long before the period of European
navigation to the east. Thevenot, in his <i>Relations de Divers
Voyages Curieux</i>, part i, Preface: Paris, 1663, says: The southern
land, which now forms a fifth part of the world, has been discovered
at different periods. The Chinese had knowledge of it long ago, for
we see that Marco Polo marks two great islands to the south-east of
Java, which it is probable that he learned from the Chinese." The
statements of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xv}</u></p>

<p>Marco Polo, which we quote from Marsden's translation, run
thus:--</p>

<p>"Upon leaving the island of Java, and steering a course between
south and south-west, seven hundred miles, you fall in with two
islands, the larger of which is named Sondur, and the other Kondur.
Both being uninhabited, it is unnecessary to say more respecting
them. Having run the distance of fifty miles from these islands, in a
south-easterly direction, you reach an extensive and rich province,
that forms a part of the main land, and is named Lochac. It's
inhabitants are idolaters. They have a language peculiar to
themselves, and are governed by their own king, who pays no tribute
to any other, the situation of the country being such as to protect
it from any hostile attack. Were it assailable, the Grand Khan would
not have delayed to bring it under his dominion. In this country
sappan or brazil wood is produced in large quantities. Gold is
abundant to a degree scarcely credible; elephants are found there;
and the objects of the chase, either with dogs or birds, are in
plenty. From hence are exported all those porcelain shells, which,
being carried to other countries, are there circulated for money, as
has been already noticed. Here they cultivate a species of fruit
called berchi, in size about that of a lemon, and having a delicious
flavour. Besides these circumstances there is nothing further that
requires mention, unless it be that the country is wild and
mountainous, and is little frequented by strangers; whose visits the
king discourages, in order that his treasures and other secret
matters of his realm may be as little known to the rest of the world
as possible.</p>

<p>"Departing from Lochac and keeping a southerly course for five
hundred miles, you reach an island named Pentam, the coast of which
is wild and uncultivated, but the woods abound with sweet scented
trees. Between the province of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xvi}</u></p>

<p>Lochac and this island of Pentam, the sea, for a space of sixty
miles, is not more than four fathoms deep, and this obliges those who
navigate it to lift the rudders of their ships, in order that they
may not touch the bottom. After sailing these sixty miles in a
south-easterly direction, and then proceeding thirty miles further,
you arrive at an island, in itself a kingdom, named Malaiur, which is
likewise the name of its city. The people are governed by a king, and
have their own peculiar language. The town is large and well built. A
considerable trade is there carried on in spices and drugs, with
which the place abounds. Nothing else that requires notice presents
itself. Proceeding onwards from thence, we shall now speak of Java
Minor."</p>

<p>That this description does not apply to Australia the reader of
the present day may readily conclude. It has received its explanation
in the judicious notes of Marsden, who shows how, from the
circumstances, it is highly probable that Lochac is intended for some
part of the country of Cambodia, the capital of which was named
Loech, according to the authority of Gasper de Cruz, who visited it
during the reign of Sebastian, king of Portugal. See Purchas, vol.
iii, p. 169. The country of Cambodia, moreover, produces the gold,
the spices, and the elephants which Marco Polo attributes to Lochac.
Pentam is reasonably supposed by Marsden to be Bintam, and the island
and kingdom of Malaiur (Maletur, in the Basle edition of 1532,
included in the Novus Orbis of Grynaeus) to be the kingdom of the
Malays.</p>

<p>In the early <i>engraved</i> maps of the sixteenth century,
however, we see the effects of this description exhibited, in a form
calculated to startle the inquirer</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xvii}</u></p>

<p>respecting the early indications of Australia. On these maps we
find laid down an extensive development of the great Terra Australis
Incognita trending northward to New Guinea; with which, on some of
these maps, it is made to be continuous, while on others it is
divided from it; and on the northernmost portion of this remarkable
delineated land occur the legends: "Beach provincia aurifere",
"Iucach regnum", "Maletur regnum scatens aromatibus", "Vasitissimas
hic esse regiones ex M. Pauli Veneti et Ludovici Vartomanni scriptis
peregrinationibus liquido constat".</p>

<p>We have already explained from Marsden's notes the reasonable
rendering of the name of Lucach or Lochac. The name of Beach, or
rather Boesch, is another form of the same name, which crept into the
Basle edition of Marco Polo in 1532, and was blunderingly repeated by
cartographers; while for Maletur we have the suggestion of the
Burgomaster Witsen, in the <i>Noord en Oost Tartarye</i> fol. 169,
that it is taken from Maleto, on the north side of the island of
Timor, a suggestion rendered null by the fact, apparently unknown to
Witsen, that Maletur, as already stated, was but a misspelling in the
Basle edition for Malaiur. The sea in which, on these early maps,
this remarkable land is made to lie, is called, Mare Lantchidol,
another perplexing piece of misspelling upon which all cartographers
have likewise stumbled, and which finds its explanation in the Malay
words 'Laut Kidol', or 'Chidol' <i>The South Sea</i>. As, however,
this striking protrusion to the northward of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xviii}</u></p>

<p>a portion of the Great Terra Australis Incognita on the early maps
in a position so nearly corresponding with that of Australia, may not
have emanated solely from the description of Marco Polo, the editor
proposes to defer further allusion to these maps until they present
themselves in their due chronological order among the documents and
data of which he will have to speak.</p>

<p>The earliest discovery of Australia to which claim has been laid
by any nation is that of a Frenchman, a native of Honfleur, named
Binot Paulmier de Gonneville, who sailed from that port in June 1503,
on a voyage to the South Seas. After doubling the Cape of Good Hope,
he was assailed by a tempest which drove him on an unknown land, in
which he received the most hospitable reception, and whence, after a
stay of six months, he returned to France, bringing with him the son
of the king of the country. The narrative is given in a judicial
declaration made by him before the French Admiralty, dated the 19th
of June, 1505, and first published in the <i>Memoires touchant
l'Etablissment d'une Mission Chretiennes dans la Terre Australe</i>,
printed at Paris by Cramoisy, 1663, and dedicated to Pope Alexander
VII, by an "ecclesiastque originaires de cette mesme terre." The
author gives his name in no other way than by these initials,
"J.P.D.C., Pretre Indien." This priest, as well as his father and
grandfather, was born in France; but his great grand-father was one
of the Australians, or natives of the southern world, whom Gonneville
had brought into France at</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xix}</u></p>

<p>his return from that country, and whom he afterwards married to
one of his own relations there, he having embraced Christianity. The
author of the account himself being animated by a strong desire of
preaching the gospel in the country of his ancestors, spent his whole
life in endeavouring to prevail on those who had the care of foreign
missions to send him there, and to fulfil the promise the first
French navigator had made, that he should visit that country again.
Unfortunately Gonneville's journals, on his return, fell into the
hands of the English, and were lost. The author, however, collected
his materials from the traditions and loose papers of his own family,
and the judicial declaration above mentioned. This account was to
have been presented to the Pope, but it never was printed till it
fell into the hands of the bookseller Cramoisy. The narrative is to
the effect that some French merchants, being tempted by the success
of the Portuguese under Vasco de Gama, determined upon sending a ship
to the Indies by the same route which he had sailed. The ship was
equipped at Honfleur. "The Sieur de Gonneville, who commanded her,
weighed anchor in the month of June 1503, and doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, where he was assailed by a furious tempest, which made him
lose his route, and abandoned him to the wearisome calm of an unknown
sea". "Not knowing what course to steer, the sight of some birds
coming from the south determined them to sail in that direction in
the hope of finding land. They found what they desired, that is to
say, a great country</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xx}</u></p>

<p>which, in their relations, was named the Southern India, according
to the custom, at that time, of applying indifferently the names of
the Indies to every country newly discovered." They remained six
months at this land; after which the crew of the ship refused to
proceed further, and Gonneville was obliged to return to France. When
near home, he was attacked by an English corsair, and plundered of
every thing; so that his journals and descriptions were entirely
lost. On arriving in port, he made a declaration of all that had
happened in the voyage to the Admiralty, which declaration was dated
July the 19th, 1505, and was signed by the principal officers of the
ship.</p>

<p>In one part of the relation, this great southern land is said to
be not far out of the direct route to the East Indies. The land of
Gonneville has been supposed by some to be in a high southern
latitude, and nearly on the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope; and
Duval and Nolin placed it on their charts to the south-west of the
Cape, in 48&deg; south: The President De Brosses, author of
<i>Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes</i>, Paris, 1756, 2
vols., conjectured that it was south of the Moluccas, and that it
was, in fact, the first discovery of the Terra Australis, since named
New Holland.</p>

<p>Gonneville, however, is represented as carrying on during his stay
a friendly intercourse with the natives, whom he mentions as having
made some advances in civilization. The account is quite incompatible
with the character for treachery and barbarous</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxi}</u></p>

<p>cruelty, which we have received of the natives of North Australia
from all the more recent voyagers.</p>

<p>Let the whole account, says Burney, be reconsidered without
prepossession, and the idea that will immediately and most naturally
occur is that the Southern India discovered by Gonneville was
Madagascar. De Gonneville having doubled (passed round) the Cape, was
by tempests driven into calm latitudes, and so near to this land,
that he was directed thither by the flight of birds. The refusal of
the crew to proceed to Eastern India, would scarcely have happened if
they had been so far advanced to the East as New Holland.</p>

<p>A more reasonable claim than the preceding to the discovery of
Australia in the early part of the sixteenth century, may be advanced
by the Portuguese from the evidence of various MS. maps still extant,
although the attempt made recently to attach the credit of this
discovery to Magalhaens in the famous voyage of the <i>Victoria</i>
round the world in 1520, is, as we shall endeavour to show, perfectly
untenable. The claim of this honour for Spain is thus asserted in the
"Compendio Geografico Estadistico de Portugal y sus posesiones
ultramarinas", by Aldama Ayala, 8 vo, Madrid, 1855, p. 482. "The
Dutch lay claim to the discovery of the continent of Australia in the
seventeenth century, although it was discovered by Fernando
Magalhaens, a Portuguese, by order of the Emperor Charles V, in the
year 1520, as is proved by authentic documents, such as the atlas of
Fernando Vaz Dourado, made in Goa in 1570, on one of the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxii}</u></p>

<p>maps in which is laid down the coast of Australia. The said
magnificent atlas, illuminated to perfection, was formerly preserved
in the Carthusian Library at Evora".</p>

<p>A similar claim was also made for their distinguished countryman,
though the voyage was made in the service of Spain, in an almanack
published at Angra, in the island of Terceira, by the government
press, anno 1832, and composed, it is supposed, by the Viscount Sa'
de Bandeira, the present minister of marine at Lisbon. In the
examination of this subject, the editor has had the advantage of the
assistance of a friend in Lisbon, who, in his research among the
remaining literary wealth of that city, has exhibited an earnestness
and an amount of care and thought but too rarely witnessed in
delegated investigations. The reader will not wonder that the zeal of
a true lover of literature has been thrown into these researches,
when he learns that they have been made by Dr. John Martin, the
well-known author (for it would be wrong to call him the editor) in
days now long gone by, of that most interesting and important work,
"Mariner's Tonga Islands". As will be presently seen, the whole
question of the possibility of the discovery of Australia having been
made by the Portuguese, in the first half of the sixteenth century,
is sufficiently enigmatical to call for a great extent of inquiry,
and the editor's venerable and honoured friend, though now grown old
in the service of science and literature, has entered into the
subject with a cordiality and ardour, commensurate with the puzzling
nature of the subject.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxiii}</u></p>

<p>But first with respect to the claim on behalf of Magalhaens, as
based upon the map of Vaz Dourado. The following are extracts from
Dr. Martin's reports upon the map.</p>

<p>"On inspecting the map and examining the more southern regions, I
found that the island of Timor was the most southern land laid down
in lat. 10&deg; S., which is its true situation, while further to the
south all was blank, excepting certain ornamental devices as far as
about latitude 17&deg; or 18&deg;, which was the lowest margin of the
map. To the west and east the map was bordered by a scale of
latitude, in single degrees; but this map did not occupy the whole
sheet of vellum, for to the right of the eastern scale of latitude
something else was laid down, viz., a line of coast running with a
little southing from west to east, with many rivers and names of
places upon it, and this notice underneath, 'Esta Costa Descubrio
Fernao de Magalhaes naturall portuges pormandado do emperador Carllos
o anno 1520'.</p>

<p>"If the whole sheet is meant to constitute one map and referable
to the same scale of latitude, then the coast in question is not
where New Holland ought to be, being north of Timor and much too far
to the eastward. On turning over to the next sheet (in the atlas)
there is a similar line of coast laid down with precisely the same
notice (above quoted) at the bottom, and evidently a
<i>continuation</i> of the same coast upon the same scale. I send a
list of the names, which I have made out as well as I could, for they
are very small and several letters are not very clear.</p>

<p>"The reasons why I cannot consider this coast as part of New
Holland, are, 1st. It is at least one thousand five hundred miles in
length, and nearly straight as a whole; though indented in its parts;
2ndly. That it is represented to have numerous rivers, which are very
rare in New Holland (on the coast); 3rdly. That it is considerably
distant from its true</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxiv}</u></p>

<p>place to the south of Timor, which in the atlas is laid down
correctly as to latitude, although 4thly. There is plenty of room for
it on the map. I have thought it might be part of the coast of South
America, where Magelhaens was long detained, and that it is put down
as a sort of memorandum of the great extent of coast which he
discovered in the first circumnavigation of the globe. With
indomitable perseverance he pushed his way through the straits that
bear his name into the Pacific, and in this vast ocean he sailed
about for three months and twenty days (says Pigafetta, who
accompanied him and wrote an account of the voyage) without
discovering anything except two small desert islands, until he
arrived at the Phillippines. Had he really discovered so much of the
coast of a great southern continent, Spain, in whose service he was,
might well have boasted of the feat, and Portugal, whose native he
was, might have defended the claims of the man who performed it, and
not let so bold and noble a discovery (for those times) remain so
long in doubt.</p>

<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p>"Now with respect to America: if we examine carefully the list of
names upon this line of coast, we shall find some that have a
resemblance to those on the coast of America, along which Malelhaen
pursued his course. One of these, C. de las Virgines, is found in
some maps just at the entrance of the Straits of Magellan, on the
eastern side. I do not see any name like Fromose<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, but there is the name Gaia Fromosa, in or
near the Straits of Magellan (in the same atlas). In the enclosed
list of names we have also Terra Gigates or Terra Gigantes, and may
not this be the Patagonians?</p>

<blockquote>[*1) This apparently Gallicised Portugese name is here
referred to by Dr. Martin in allusion to its occurrence on certain
early French maps to be treated of hereafter.]</blockquote>

<hr width="30%" align="center">
<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxv}</u></p>

<p>"On a closer and more minute examination of Dourado's map, and
others, I think it may now be made evident that the coast said to
have been discovered by Magelhaens, in 1520, and mistaken by Sa de
Bandeira and others, for part of the coast of New Holland, is no
other than the northern coast of New Guinea.</p>

<p>"Now New Guinea, or part of it, as laid down by Dourado, appears
under the name of Os Papuos, and extends to the eastward as far as
the scale of latitude is marked, but beyond that scale there is about
half an inch of space, and there the coast in question commences, and
runs a long way towards the east, with a little southing, and has
many islands bordering upon it; whether this be either a continuation
or a repetition more extended of Papua, it is much in the same
latitude, and runs in the same direction. Again, on referring to an
old map of Mercator, I found some names upon New Guinea, similar to
those on the coast in question; there I found C. de las Virgines; I.
de los Cresbos; R. de Bolcados; Buen Puerto answering to C. de las
Virgines; I. de los Crespos: Bullcones Puerto Bueno, as found among
the names on the coast in question; but what places the matter still
more beyond doubt is, that the names in both run in the same
consecutive order from west to east, upon several of the islands
which border the main land.</p>

<pre>
Names of Islands as laid down in          Names of Islands as laid down
Dourado's map along the coast             in Mercator's map on the
said to be New Holland, in consecutive    coast of New Guinea, in
order from W. to E.                       consecutive order, W. to E.

Bullcones (is laid down on the main land) Los Bulcones
</pre>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxvi}</u></p>

<p>"Seeing that the coast in question, and that of New Guinea, are in
the same latitude, that they greatly resemble each other in position,
that several names upon them are similar, and that the similar names
follow each other in both cases in the like consecutive order, and
the same direction from west to east, I think we may safely come to
the conclusion that the coast in question is identically that of New
Guinea, and that the assumption of Viscount Sa de Bandeira and others
following him, or whom he has followed, is an error."</p>

<p>From these observations of Dr. Martin, the editor forms the
following conclusions; that the tract laid down on Vaz Dourado's map
as discovered by Magalhaens, is in fact a memorandum or
cartographical side-note of the real discovery by Magalhaens of Terra
del Fuego, and that from its adopted false position on the vellum it
was subsequently applied erroneously to New Guinea by Mercator. But
even if this surmise be incorrect, the only alternative that remains
is that the tract laid down is New Guinea, and clearly not Australia,
as assumed by the claiments to whom we have referred. The editor
submits that this claim is alike untenable from the accounts of
Magalhaen's voyage and from the evidence of the map itself on which
that claim is founded.</p>

<p>But we now pass to a more plausible indication of a discovery of
Australia by the Portuguese in the early part of the sixteenth
century, which ranges between the years 1512 and 1542. It occurs in
similar form on six maps, four of them in England and two in France,
on which, immediately below Java, and separated from that island only
by a narrow</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxvii}</u></p>

<p>strait, is drawn a large country stretching southward to the verge
of several maps. The earliest in all probability, and the most
detailed of these maps, is the one from which we give the annexed
reduction of that portion immediately under consideration. It is a
large chart of the world on a plane scale, on vellum, 8 ft. 2 in. by
3 ft. 10 in., highly ornamented, with figures, etc., and with the
names in French. At the upper corner, on the left side, is a shield
of the arms of France, with the collar of St. Michael; and on the
right, another shield of France with Dauphiny, quarterly. It was
probably executed in the time of Francis I. of France, for his son
the Dauphin, afterwards Henry II. This chart formerly belonged to
Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, after whose death it was taken away by
one of his servants. It was subsequently purchased by Sir Joseph
Banks, Bart., and presented by him to the British Museum in 1790.</p>

<p><b>Java La Grande</b></p>
</center>

<p>The second, in all probability, of these, is contained in an atlas
drawn at Dieppe in 1547, at present in the possession of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, Bart., of Middle Hill, Worcestershire. It contains the
name of Nicholas Vallard of Dieppe. The editor has been unsuccessful
in his efforts to gain a sight of this atlas, or even a fac-simile
lithograph made by Sir Thomas Phillipps of the map supposed to
contain the representation of Australia. Hence he has been compelled
to rely upon the memory of Sir Frederick Madden, who had an
opportunity of examining the atlas some years since, and who
recollects that though</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxviii}</u></p>

<p>it bore the name of Vallard and the date of 1547, it was not made
by him, and that its date, though probably earlier than 1547, could
be shown from internal evidence to be not earlier than 1539, A coat
of arms appears in the margin of the volume, argent, on a saltire,
<i>gules</i>, five besants, a mullet, sable in the fess point. This
may lead a future investigator to the discovery of an earlier
possessor of the map than Vallard, although it should be remarked
that the borders on the margin appear to be of a later date than the
maps themselves. It fell into the possession of Prince Talleyrand at
the beginning of this century, and attracting the attention of the
celebrated geographer M. Barbie du Bocage, drew from him a notice in
the <i>Magasin Encyclopedique, douzieme annee</i>, tom. iv, 107,
which, though lengthy, bears so directly upon the subject of the
present work, that it is proposed in simple justice both to the
writer and the reader presently to give it in full.</p>

<p>The third and fourth of these maps (if our other inferences as to
date be correct) are contained in one volume in the British Museum;
one of them is a detailed map, and the other an almost skeleton map
of the world in hemispheres, with the latitudes and longitudes marked
and the names of 'lytel Java' and the 'londe of Java' laid down on
the great country in question. It is from this latter map that the
annexed extract is given, on the same scale as the original, the
octavo page being sufficiently large to admit the portion required to
be shown. The only point of difference calling for special remark is,
that</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxvix}</u></p>

<p>in the original hemisphere the line representing the eastern coast
does not reach to the bottom of the map, but terminates abruptly in
the same degree of latitude as represented in the copy, though that
degree is here, for convenience sake, made to coincide with the
margin of the map. Indeed the special interest of this particular map
is, that whereas all the others which represent this remarkable
country have the coastline extended indefinitely to the southern
margin; on this both the eastern and western coast lines stop
abruptly at certain points, of which we are able to take cognizance
by the degrees of latitude being shown on the same map. The volume
containing these two important maps bears the date of 1542, and was
made by one Jean Rotz who had in the first instance intended to
dedicate it to the king of France, but afterwards presented it to
king Henry VIII of England. In this dedication to the king, he says
that the maps are made "au plus certain et vray quil ma este possible
de faire, tante par mon experience propre, que par la certaine
experience de mes amys et compagnons navigateurs;" and at the close
he expresses his hope to compose shortly a work in English, which was
to be printed to the great profit and advantage of all the navigators
and seamen of this prosperous kingdom. It is to be regretted that we
do not possess the work here promised, as much light might thereby
have been thrown upon the mystery in which the question before us is
involved. It has been suggested by Malte Brun, that the author was a
Fleming, who came over to</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxx}</u></p>

<p>England with Anne of Cleves in 1540. The idea may have originated
in the form of the name, but would hardly have been maintained had
Malte Brun read Totz's dedication, in which he speaks of the king of
France as having been "mon souverin et naturel signeur." There can be
no doubt, then, that he was a French subject.</p>

<p><b>The Londe of Java</b></p>
</center>

<p>The fifth in date, if we suppose it to have been made early in the
reign of Henry II, is a map given in fac-simile by M. Jomard, in his
<i>Monuments de la Geographie, ou Recueil d'Anciennes Cartes</i> now
in progress, and is described by him as "Mappemonde peinte sur
parchemin par ordre de Henri II, Roi de France."</p>

<p>The sixth is a map in a Portolano at the Depot de la Guerre,
Paris, drawn in 1555 by Guillaume le Testu, a pilot of Grasse, in
Provence, or as others have thought a Norman. Andre Thevet,
cosmographer to Henry II, boasted of having often sailed with him,
and always styles him as "renomme pilote et singulier navigateur."
The map was drawn for Admiral Coligny, to whom it is dedicated and
whose name it bears. The editor has succeeded in procuring a tracing
of that portion which affects the present question, and finds it to
agree with the other maps of the kind in the delineation of the coast
of "la Grande Java."</p>

<p>On the reduced tracing of the most fully detailed of these maps
are inscribed some names of bays and coasts which were noticed in the
first instance by Alexander Dalrymple, the late hydrographer to the
Admiralty and the East India Company,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxi}</u></p>

<p>to bear a resemblance to the names given by Captain Cook to parts
of New Holland which he had himself discovered.</p>

<p>In his memoir concerning the Chagos and adjacent islands, 1786,
p.4, speaking of this map he says:--"The east coast of New Holland as
we name is expressed with some curious circumstances of
correspondence to Captain Cook's MS. What he names:--</p>

<pre>
Bay of Inlets,              is in the MS. called Bay Perdue.
Bay of Isles,               is in the MS. called R. de beaucoup d'Isles.
Where the Endeavour struck, is in the MS. called Coste dangereuse."
</pre>

<p>So that we may say with Solomon, "'There is nothing new under the
sun'".</p>

<p>To the discredit of so well informed and laborious a man as
Dalrymple, to whom, perhaps, next to Hakluyt, this country is the
most largely indebted for its commercial prosperity, this passage was
but an invidious insinuation, intended to disparage the credit of
Captain Cook, of whose appointment to the command of the Endeavour he
was extremely jealous. Dalrymple had earnestly desired the command of
an expedition to discover the great southern continent, the existence
of which he had endeavoured to prove by various philosophical
arguments, which later times have shown to be not without foundation;
and his observation would seem to imply that Cook, who had been so
successful in his discoveries on the coast of New Holland, might have
been led thereto by an acquaintance with this pre-existant map. The
unworthy insinuation met with a sensible refutation, as we are happy
to record, from the pen of a Frenchman,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxii}</u></p>

<p>M. Frederic Metz, in a paper printed at p, 261, vol. 47 of <i>La
Revue, ou Decade Philosophique, Litteraire et Politique</i>, Nov.,
1805. For the sake of clearness, the editor avoids here giving the
whole of M. Metz's paper, in which an attempt is made to disprove
that New Holland was discovered at this time by the Portuguese at
all, but will merely quote those passages which meet Dalrymple's
insinuation. M. Metz says:--</p>

<p>"It had been generally believed that we were indebted to the Dutch
for our acquaintance with this vast country, and that the celebrated
Cook had in his first voyage discovered its eastern coast, which he
named New South Wales, until the discovery was made in the British
Museum of a map upon parchment, presumed to be of the sixteenth
century, on which was observed a large country laid down on the site
occupied by New Holland. On the eastern coast of this country, places
were found with the names 'Cotes des Herbaiges', 'Riviere de beaucoup
d'Iles', 'Cote dangereuse', names which present a great resemblance
to those of 'Botany Bay', 'Bay of Islands' and 'Dangerous Coast',
given by Cook to parts of New South Wales. "The resemblance of these
names struck many persons. Mr. Dalrymple, a man of the greatest
merit, but a personal enemy of Cook, whom he never forgave for having
received, in preference to him, the command of the Endeavour, in the
voyage made to observe the passage of Venus, and especially for
having demolished, beyond a hope of recovery, his theories of the
existence of the southern lands, and of the north-west passage of
America: Mr. Dalrymple, I say, took occasion therefrom to insinuate
in one of his works, that the discovery of the east of New Holland
was due to some navigator of the sixteenth century, and that Cook had
only followed in his track..."</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxiii}</u></p>

<p>"As the the resemblance of the names--this seems to me to prove
exactly the contrary of the conclusions which it has been attempted
to draw from them. If Cook had been acquainted with the maps in
question, and had wished to appropriate to himself the discoveries of
another, will anyone suppose him so short-sighted as to have
preserved for his discoveries the very names which would have exposed
his plagiarism, if ever the sources which he had consulted came to be
known. The 'dangerous coast' was so named because there he found
himself during four hours in imminent danger of shipwreck. We must
suppose, then, that he exposed himself and his crew to an almost
certain death in order to have a plausible excuse for applying a name
similar to that which this coast had already received from the
unknown and anonymous navigator who had previously discovered it.
Moreover, names such as 'Bay of Islands', 'Dangerous coast', are well
known in geography. We find a Bay of Islands in New Holland; and on
the east coast of the island of Borneo there is a 'Cote des
Herbages.'"</p>

<p>The sound sense of this reasoning, apart from all question of
honour on the part of a man of the high character of Captain Cook,
would seem conclusive, yet this similarity of names has, to the
editor's own knowledge, been remarked upon by persons of high
standing and intelligence in this country, though without any
intention of disparaging Captain Cook, as an evidence that this
country was identical with Australia. The similarity of the
expression, 'Cote des Herbages', with the name of Botany Bay, given
to a corresponding part of the coast by Captain Cook, has been
particularly dwelt upon, whereas it ought to be known that this
bay,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxiv}</u></p>

<p>originally called Stingray, but afterwards Botany Bay, was not so
named on account of the fertility of the soil, but from the variety
of plants new to the science of botany which were discovered on a
soil otherwise rather unpromising. It is plain that early navigators
would assign such a designation as 'Cote des Herbages' to a shore
remarkable for its rich growth of grass or other vegetation, rather
than from the appreciation of any curious botanical discovery. Had
the similarity of the names 'Riviere de beaucoup d'Iles' and 'Cote
dangereuse' with Cook's 'Bay of Islands' and the place 'where the
<i>Endeavour</i> struck', names descriptive of unquestionable
realities, been advanced by Dalrymple as evidence of the high
probability that the country represented on the early map was New
Holland, without volunteering an insinuation against the merit of his
rival, we should have accepted the reasonable suggestion with
deference and just acquiescence.</p>

<p>That New Holland was the country thus represented, became an
argument supported by a variety of reasonings by more than one of our
French neighbours. Mr. Coquebert Montbret, in a memoir printed in No.
81 of the <i>Bulletin des Sciences</i>, 1804, quotes Dalrymple's
injurious observation and silently allows it to have its deceptive
effect on the mind of the incautious reader.</p>

<p>The atlas now in the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps, which as
we have stated, is probably next in date to that made for the
Dauphin, fell into the possession of Prince Talleyrand at the
beginning of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxv}</u></p>

<p>this century, and attracting the attention of the celebrated
geographer M. Barbie du Bocage, drew from him the following notice in
the 'Magasin Encyclopedique, douzieme annee', tom. iv, 1807, which,
though lengthy, bears so directly upon the subject of the present
work, that it is here given in full.</p>

<p><i>Extract from the notice of a geographical manuscript belonging
to his Serene Highness the Prince of Benevento</i> (better known as
Prince Talleyrand), <i>read at a public session of the Institute, on
the 3rd of July, 1807, by M. Barbie du Bocage.</i></p>

<p>"This manuscript is an hydrographic atlas, drawn at Dieppe in 1547
by a person of the name of Nicholas Vallard, of Dieppe, representing
the eastern and western coasts of the continent of New Holland. This
atlas is not the only one upon which these coasts are laid down.
There are two in England, which came from France, and which we have
been acquainted with by the English as well as by some Frenchmen. One
of the two, which has been for a considerable time in the library of
the British Museum, was drawn in 1542 by a person of the name of Jean
Rotz or Roty, who had in the first instance drawn it, as he states in
the dedication, for the King of France, but afterwards presented it
to Henry VIII, king of England. The second is a large map on one
single sheet of parchment, made for the Dauphin of France, whose arms
it bears. It was formerly in the library of the Earl of Oxford, where
Sir Joseph Banks was acquainted with it, and thence it passed to the
British Museum, where it is at present. The English pretend that none
of these charts were discovered till after the death of the
celebrated Captain Cook, and that they had no knowledge of them when
this navigator set sail. But their prior existence in well-known
libraries in England may cause this assertion</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxvi}</u></p>

<p>to be doubted. But even if they had made use of them to indicate
to their countryman the countries which he had to visit, it would not
the less follow that the skill the prudence and the resolution with
which Captain Cook conducted his operations must always secure for
him the glory of having made known in detail the countries which had
hitherto been but faintly indicated."</p>

<p>The third manuscript atlas which represents the coasts of New
Holland is that of which we have now to treat. It is a small folio
volume, consisting of fifteen hydrographical charts on vellum, which
has been recently acquired by his serene highness the Prince of
Benevento. This atlas, even by the account of persons who have seen
those which are in England, is the most beautiful of all the works of
the kind, and for this reason deserves the most particular attention.
There has since been discovered in France a fourth which is at
present in the library of the Depot de la Guerre, which was drawn in
1555 by a person named Guillaume le Testu, a pilot, of Grasse, in
Provence, for Admiral Coligny, to whom it is dedicated, and whose
arms it bears.</p>

<p>The English geographers, MM. Dalrymple, Major Rennell, and
Pinkerton; and among the French, MM. Bauache, De la Rochette,
Coquebert de Montbret, and others, recognise on these atlases the
eastern and western coasts of New Holland. These coasts are bounded
by the same latitudes as those indicated on recent maps; and if they
encroach more on longitude it is because, at the time the discovery
was made, there existed but small means of fixing the boundaries in
that respect. The names on all the atlases which we have just quoted
are, for the most part, in Portuguese, some of them in French; that
of 1542 alone, which is in England, has some of the names in bad
English. We must, therefore, come to the conclusion that these
atlases have been copied from Portuguese maps, and consequently that
the discovery of the continent of New Holland belongs to the
Portuguese.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxvii}</u></p>

<p>This is the opinion of MM. Dalrymple, Pinkerton, De la Rochette
and several others; and I do not believe that any good reason can be
alleged in refutation of an opinion so well founded.</p>

<p>All these atlases call this continent "Great Java", in
contradistinction to the Island of Java, which is to the north of it;
yet it is very singular that no mention whatever is made of this
country in the voyages of the time. As, however, I think I have
detected from history the period at which it must have been made, I
shall now endeavour to explain why the Portuguese have kept this
discovery a secret. I shall then fix the period at which I presume it
to have been made, and will show how the knowledge of this country
has been lost even by those who have discovered it.</p>

<p>The most ancient of the atlases which represents the coasts of New
Holland, is that of Rotz or Roty, which is in England, and which
bears the date 1542. At that period the Portuguese were masters of
the Molucca Islands, which they had discovered in 1511, and where
they had established themselves in 1512, and in one of which,
Ternate, they had built a fort in 1522. They must have discovered New
Holland after the Moluccas, and therefore this discovery must be
limited to the period between the years 1512 and 1542.</p>

<p>Now, after 1516 or 1517, Spain began to dispute with Portugal the
possession of the Moluccas, as being situated within the hemisphere
which had been allotted to them by the bull of the pope Alexander VI,
dated the 4th of July, 1493. This pope, in consequence of the
disputes which had arisen between the courts of Lisbon and Toledo,
had arranged that all discoveries which might be made on the globe to
the east of a meridian one hundred leagues west of the Azores and
Cape Verde Islands (which he seemed to think lay under the same
medidian), for the space of 180&deg;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxviii }</u></p>

<p>of longitude, should belong to the Portuguese; and that those to
the westward of the same meridian for the same space should belong to
the Spaniards. This division has since been called the line of
demarcation of Pope Alexander VI. Don John II, however, who was then
king of Portugal, being dissatisfied with this bull, which seemed to
deprive him of considerable possessions in the west, made another
arrangement in the following year with Isabella and Ferdinand of
Spain, by which this line was pushed further west, and definitely
fixed at three hundred and seventy leagues to the westward of the
Cape Verde Islands. This agreement was signed the 4th of June, 1494,
and it was arranged that, in the space of ten months, persons should
be sent out who were well informed in geography, to fix exactly the
places through which this line should pass.</p>

<p>This agreement once entered upon, no more consideration was given
to the sending out of competent persons to the places indicated, and
the two governments continued their discoveries, each on its own
behalf. Under the guidance of Cabral, the Portuguese, on the 9th of
March, 1500, discovered Brazil, which lay in their own hemisphere.
Under the guidance of Vincent Yanez Pinzon, the Spaniards had in the
same or preceding year, sailed along the whole of this coast as far
as the embouchure of the Oronoco. After this time the line, without
further examination, was reckoned to pass by the mouth of the
Maranon, or river of the Amazons, which had been already explored,
and it is in this part that it is found traced on the Spanish maps of
Herrera. The Portuguese, while they took possession of Brazil,
continued their discoveries towards the east, and reached the
Moluccas, where they established themselves, as we have said, in
1512. The proprietorship of the spices which the possession of these
islands gave them, produced such considerable profits that it soon
excited the jealousy of the Spaniards. The latter pretended that the
Moluccas were in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xxxix }</u></p>

<p>the hemisphere which had been allotted to them. This idea was
particularly suggested to them by Magellan, who, being discontented
with the treatment of king Emanuel, in having refused him an increase
of allowance, took refuge about the year 1516 in Spain, and offered
his services to the government of Charles V. Not only did he assert
that the hemisphere belonging to the Spaniards comprised the
Moluccas, but also the islands of Java and Sumatra, and a part of the
Malay peninsula. In fact, from the difficulty which then existed in
determing longitude, the discoveries of the Portuguese appeared to
appropriate more than 180&deg; in this direction, so great was the
amount of space given to them in their maps; nevertheless, if we
examine modern maps we shall see that, measuring from the mouth of
the Maranon, the Moluccas still came within the hemisphere of the
Portuguese.</p>

<p>Cardinal Ximenes, who at that time governed Spain in the absence
of Charles V, at the outset received Magellan very well, and Charles
V. himself afterwards entrusted him with the command of a squadron of
five vessels, which, as we know, sailed from San Lucar on the 20th of
September, 1519, on a western passage, in search of the spice
islands, or Moluccas. Two of the vessels of this fleet arrived on the
8th of November, 1521, at the island of Tidore, after having passed
through the straits since called the Straits of Magellan. That
navigator was now no more; he had been killed in one of the islands
of the archipelago of St. Lazaro, since called the Philippines, and
nearly all his squadron having been destroyed, one vessel only, named
"Victoria", returned to Europe, with eighteen persons, all very sick,
under the guidance of Sebastian del Cano, who landed on the 6th of
September, 1522, at the same port of San Lucar de Barrameda, from
which the fleet had set sail three years before.</p>

<p>Whether it was from policy, or because the currents which</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xl}</u></p>

<p>exist in the Great Pacific Ocean had carried Magellan's fleet
rapidly down to the Philippines and Moluccas, those who returned from
this expedition, always maintained that these latter islands were in
the hemisphere of the Spaniards, who consequently laid claim to
traffic there. They were even on the point of sending out a new
expedition thither, when king John III begged Charles V to have the
question examined by competent persons, and promised to acquiesce in
their decision. The two governments appointed twenty-four, or even a
greater number, both Spaniards and Portuguese, well skilled in
geography and navigation, who from the commencement of March 1524,
met alternately in the two cities of Badajos and Elves, on the
frontiers of the two states. Three months were allowed to them to
decide definitely to whom these islands belonged.</p>

<p>These commissioners, among whom was Sebastian del Cano, who had
brought back the <i>Victoria</i>, consumed at the outset a
considerable time in consulting globes and charts, and in comparing
the journals of pilots. They examined the distance between the
Moluccas and the line of demarcation. They disputed much, and came to
no conclusion. More than two months passed away in this manner; and
they reached the latter part of May, which had been fixed as the term
of the conferences.</p>

<p>The Spanish commissioners then settled the line of demarcation at
three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands as
it had been fixed in 1494; and as, on the basis of the charts which
they had then before them, they made the opposite line, which was to
be at the distance of 180&deg;, pass-through the Malay peninsula,
they included in their own hemisphere not only the Moluccas, but also
the islands of Java and Borneo, part of Sumatra, the coast of China,
and part of the Malay peninsula itself. The Portuguese did not agree
to this limitation, which was too disadvantageous for themselves; on
the contrary,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xli}</u></p>

<p>they went away very discontented, storming, and threatening war,
which gave occasion to the jocose observation of Peter Martyr of
Anghiera, a talented man, at that time the historiographer of the
court of Spain, that the Commissioners, after having well syllogized,
concluded by being unable to decide the question except by cannon
balls.</p>

<p>In spite of the unsuccessful issue of this negotiation, the two
courts did not come to a quarrel; they were at the point of forming
alliances. The question of the marriage of the Infanta Catherine, the
emperor's sister, with king John, which was celebrated in 1525, was
being then entertained. In the following year, 1526, the emperor
espoused, with great pomp, Isabella, king John's sister. Charles V,
however, believing himself in the right, continued to permit his
subjects to carry on commerce with the Spice Islands; and he himself
fitted out fleets to dispute the possession of them with the
Portuguese. Some of these vessels landed at the Moluccas in 1527 and
1528; but, as these expeditions were generally unsuccessful, and as,
moreover, he was in need of money for his coronation in Italy, he
listened to the proposals of king John to purchase his rights to the
islands. He parted with them by a secret treaty, which was signed at
Saragossa the 22nd of April, 1529, for the sum, it is said, of
350,000 golden ducats, against the express wish of his subjects, who
often, but in vain, besought him to retract it. By his refusal, it
was thought that he had received much more. Thenceforth the Spaniards
were not permitted to traffic with the Moluccas.</p>

<p>This termination of the quarrel on the part of Portugal was a
justification of the claims of the Spaniards, and an acknowledgment
in some sort that the Moluccas were in their hemisphere. After such
an arrangement, the Portuguese could not show any discoveries made to
the eastward, or even under the meridian of these islands. The
greatest part of New Holland is more to the east than the
Moluccas;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlii}</u></p>

<p>hence it is to be believed that for this reason the Portuguese
have kept silence respecting their discovery of it.</p>

<p>This discovery, as we have said, must be comprised between the
years 1512 and 1542. There is, however, no mention made of it in the
voyages of the time, which would sufficiently prove that the
Portuguese had suppressed, or at least concealed, the account of it.
But I propose to endeavour to supply this defect from the narrative
of two of their historians.</p>

<p>Castenheda, a Portuguese author, who had been in India, tells us
that in the beginning of July, 1525, the Portuguese of Ternate, one
of the Moluccas, dispatched a vessel to the island of Celebes to
traffic there; that this vessel on its return was driven by violent
winds and currents into an open sea, between the Straits of Magellan
and the Moluccas; that the Portuguese found themselves thrown more
than three hundred leagues out of their route, and were several times
nearly lost. One night their rudder was carried away, and they beat
about till morning, when they discovered an island thirty leagues in
circumference, on which they landed, with thanks to God for affording
them this asylum. The islanders gave them an excellent reception;
they were of a tawny colour, but well made and good looking, both men
and women. The men had long black beards. The Portuguese remained
four months on this island, not only for the purpose of refitting,
but because the winds were contrary for the return to the Moluccas.
At length they departed and reached Ternate on the 20th of January,
1526.</p>

<p>Such is the narrative of Castenheda. The Jesuit Maffei, who has
given us a history of India, has supplied us with less details, but
his account is not less valuable, inasmuch as he gives us the name of
the captain who commanded the ship. He says: Some Portuguese of the
Moluccas, having gone to the islands of the Celebes to seek for gold,
but not having been able to land, were driven by a fearful tempest
upon an</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xliii}</u></p>

<p>island, which is distant therefrom three hundred leagues, when
they went ashore. The inhabitants, who were simple people, received
them very well, and soon became familiar with them. They comprehended
their signs, and even understood a little of the language spoken at
the Moluccas. All the inhabitants were well-looking, both male and
female; they were cheerful, and the men wore beards and long hair.
The existence of this island was previously unknown, but in
consideration of the account given, of it by the captain, whose name
was Gomez de Sequeira, and of the map which he drew of this island,
his name was given to it.</p>

<p>From the details supplied to us by these two authors, it is
evident that the island on which Gomez de Sequeira was thrown was to
the eastward of the Moluccas, because, in returning, the Portuguese
had to sail Westward. Now three hundred Portuguese leagues, starting
from the Moluccas, or the island of Celebes, leads us to within a
trifle of Endeavour Straits; we may therefore conclude that it was
upon one of the rocks in this strait that Gomez de Sequeira lost his
rudder, and that the island on which he landed was one of the
westernmost of those which lie along its western extremity. The
Portuguese did not advance far into this strait, for it is plain that
they met with no obstacle in returning to the Moluccas. I think,
therefore, that the island on which Gomez de Sequeira landed was one
of those which were called Prince of Wales Islands by Captain Cook,
and which are inhabited, because this navigator states that he saw
smoke there. What confirms me in this opinion, is the agreement of
our two authors in stating that the natives of New Holland
[differed?] from those of New Guinea, whose hair and beards are
crisped. This island, therefore, was nearer to New Holland than to
New Guinea, which is, in fact, the case with the Prince of Wales
Islands.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xliv}</u></p>

<p>The Portuguese having discovered in 1525 an island so near as this
to New Holland, we must believe that the discovery of that continent
followed very soon after that of this island. It was at that time
that the controversies between the courts of Portugal and Spain were
at their highest; the Portuguese, therefore, needed to be cautious
respecting their new discoveries; they were obliged to conceal them
carefully. It will not, therefore, be surprising that no mention was
made in their works of the discovery of New Holland.</p>

<p>But, after having shown how much importance the Portuguese must
have attached to the concealment of their discoveries, and having
examined at what period the discovery of New Holland may have been
made, it will be not less interesting to inquire how this discovery
may have become known in France, and afterwards, in England, so early
as 1542. There was nothing at that time to induce the court of
Portugal to disclose their discoveries to the court of France; there
was nothing to bind these two courts in intimate union; on the
contrary, their intercourse had for some time been rather cool. As
proof of this, the king of Portugal had in 1543 married his daughter
Mary to Philip the Infant of Spain, without giving notice thereof to
Francis I, who thereupon showed his vexation in his conduct towards
Francis de Norough, the ambassador of Portugal, who to avoid a
rupture between the two courts, answered with considerable reserve.
We cannot, therefore, presume that the court of Portugal would ever
have frankly communicated its discoveries to the court of France.</p>

<p>For my part, if it is permitted me to offer a conjecture, I think
that this information may have resulted from the faithlessness of Don
Miguel de Sylva, bishop of Viseo, and secretary of La Purite, a
favourite of the king of Portugal, who, according to De la Clede,
left the kingdom about 1542, carrying with him some papers of
importance with which</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlv}</u></p>

<p>the king had entrusted him.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> This
historian adds, that Don John was so indignant at the treachery of
his favourite, that he outlawed him by a public decree, deprived him
of all his benefices, and degraded him from his nobility. He decreed
the same penalties against all his followers, and forbad all his
subjects to hold any intercourse whatever with him, under pain of his
displeasure. The count of Portalegre, the brother of the fugitive was
even confined as a prisoner in the tower of Belem for having written
to him, and kept under strict guard until the Infanta Maria, on the
point of her departure to marry Philip II, the son of the Emperor
Charles V, begged his liberation. The king granted the request, on
the condition that the count should go to Arzilla to fight against
the Moors, and earn by his services the forgiveness of his fault.</p>

<p>The severity which the king Don John exhibited on this occasion
sufficiently shows the value which he attached to the papers which
had been taken away. It is evident that they were of the greatest
importance. They were secret papers; and may they not have been those
which gave information of the discoveries of the Portuguese? Our
atlases, therefore, may have been copied from the stolen documents;
and it only remains for us to discover what has become of the
originals.</p>

<p>Now, although the theories to which these maps</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Since the reading of this memoir at the Institute,
M. Correa da Serra, to whom I had previously read it, has had the
goodness to inform me of some researches which he has made upon this
subject. He discovered that Don Miguel de Sylva left the kingdom of
Portugal in 1542, that he only arrived in Italy in 1543 to receive
the cardinal's hat, and he thinks that he could only have reached
that country by passing through France, where he had formerly
studied, and that he doubtless there left the originals from which
our charts were copied.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlvi}</u></p>

<p>have given rise have been so complacently accepted by successive
geographical writers, the subject has never yet been minutely
investigated by any English writer, nor, indeed, have the foregoing
arguments of the French been ever before brought together into a
focus. The editor, therefore, first proposes to answer the hypothesis
of M. Barbie du Bocage respecting the voyage he adduces of Gomez de
Sequeira, and then, finally, to deal with the general question of the
suggestive evidence of the maps.</p>

<p>With respect to Gomez de Sequeira's voyage, it is certainly
surprising that M. Barbie du Bocage should have contented himself
with referring to Castenheda and Maffei for a slight and loose
description of this voyage, when it was equally competent to him to
have resorted to the more ample description of Barros, the most
distinguished of all the early Portuguese historians, who lived in
the middle of the sixteenth century, and who has devoted a whole
chapter to the minute description of the voyage in question. (See
Dec. 3, liv. x, cap. 5) So full and ample is Barros' narrative that
with a modern map before us, we can track Sequeira's course with a
nicety which, so far as the main question is concerned, is not
interrupted even by the accidents of the storm and the unshipping of
his rudder. Let the reader for a moment consult any modern map of the
Moluccas and the neighbouring islands, and he will find that the
island of the Celebes, to which Sequeira directed his course from
Ternate, presents the northernmost of the three horns of its
oddly-shaped outline at a distance of about sixty leagues from
Ternate.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlvii}</u></p>

<p>This is the distance which Barros states that he had to sail in
order to reach that island. Had he sailed to the nearest of the two
other points his voyage would have been, instead of sixty leagues,
more than twice that distance; whereas the very nearness of the
island was an inducement for the undertaking of the voyage, as the
object was to relieve the immediate necessities of the settlement of
Ternate. Upon landing at the point thus shown to be the northernmost
one, the fact of his having carried with him stuffs for barter being
discovered by the natives, converted the friendly feeling with which
they had at first received him into hostility, as, having heard of
some previous acts of greediness on the part of the Portuguese, they
immediately concluded that the visit was not made in a spirit of
friendship, but from selfish and ulterior motives. Hence Sequeira and
his party were compelled to make their escape in haste, and proceeded
to four or five other small islands in the neighbourhood, at which
they met with a like reception. The map will show these plainly to
the north of the Celebes. Resolving after these rebuffs to return to
Ternate, they encountered a terrific storm, which drove them, to the
best of their calculation, three hundred leagues <i>into an open
sea</i>, with not a single island in sight, <i>but constantly towards
the east</i>. At length one night, they struck upon an island and
unshipped their rudder. They met with a most friendly reception from
the natives, who are described as of a light, rather than a dark,
colour, and clothed. The island is stated to have been large and the
natives</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlviii}</u></p>

<p>pointed to a mountain to the westward in which they said there was
gold. The Portuguese remained in the island four months, until the
monsoon enabled them to return to Ternate.</p>

<p>Now, had Sequeira been driven by the storm towards Endeavour
Strait, as presumed by M. Barbie du Bocage, a glance at the map will
show us that his course would have been south-east instead of east,
and that not through an open sea in which no island could be seen,
but one bestudded with islands. In fact, so definite is the whole
account as given in detail by Barros, that, as we have shown his
course under the driving tempest may be palpably traced in accordance
therewith on modern maps as due east to the north of the Moluccas,
and through an open sea, and is clearly at variance with the
inference of M. Barbie du Bocage, who seems not to have consulted
Barros at all upon the subject. To what island, the reader will ask,
was Sequeira driven? Let the modern map be consulted, and the course
described will bring us to the island Tobi, otherwise known as Lord
North's Island. A course so clearly defined is in itself a very
strong point in the question, even though we may have to show some
discrepancies between the description of the island on which Sequeira
was thrown and that which we have in recent times received of Lord
North's Island. Let the reader, however, in connexion with Barros'
description of the course, take the following remarkable statement,
as quoted in the 6th volume of the <i>Ethnography and Philology of
the United States Exploring Expedition</i>, by H. Hale, in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xlix}</u></p>

<p>which, under the article "Tobi, or Lord North's Island," at p. 78,
the following account is given, and he will perhaps not dissent from
the editor in thinking it possible that this was the island on which
Sequeira was driven.</p>

<p>"Tobi, or Lord North's Island, is situated in about lat. 3&deg; 2'
N., and long. 131&deg; 4' E. It is a small low islet, about three
miles in circumference, with a population of between three and four
hundred souls. Our information concerning it is derived from an
American, by name Horace Holden, who, with eleven companions, after
suffering shipwreck, reached the island in a boat, and was taken
captive by the natives. He was detained by them two years from
December 6th, 1832, to November 27th, 1334, when he made his escape
and returned to America, where he published in a small volume (which
is in the British Museum), an interesting narrative of his adventures
and sufferings, with a description of the island and its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The complexion of the natives, says Holden in his narrative, is a
light copper colour, much lighter than that of the Malays or Pelew
Islanders, which last, however, they resemble in the breadth of their
faces, high cheek bones, and broad flattened noses. Here we observe
what has been before remarked of the Polynesian tribes, that the
lightest complexion is found among those who are nearest the
equator.</p>

<p>"According to the native traditions a personage, by name
"Pita-Ka't" (or Peeter Kart)<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, of
copper colour like themselves,</p>

<blockquote>[*1) This name, from the Dutch form which it bears, might
suggest the idea that the visitor was a Dutchman; but it must be
remembered that the Dutch were not in those seas till the end of the
sixteenth century, and that the Synod of Dort was held in the years
1618 and 1619, which renders the suggestion at the close of the
paragraph as to "the images to represent their divinityl unreasonable
as coming from a native of that country. It is mor probable that,
from the lapse of time, a mistake was made in the repetition of the
name by a savage, and that a Portuguese, and no a Dutchman, suggested
the use of images to represent a divinity.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: l}</u></p>

<p><i>Came, many years ago, from the Island of Ternate, one of the
Moluccas, and gave them their religion and such simple arts as they
possessed.</i> It is probably to him that we are to attribute some
peculiarities in their mode of worship, such as their temple with
rude images to represent their divinity. The natives wear the
Polynesian girdle of bark cloth.</p>

<p>"The houses of the natives are built with small trees and rods and
thatched with leaves. They have two stories, a ground floor and a
loft, which is entered by a hole or scuttle through the horizontal
partition or upper floor.</p>

<p>"For ornament they sometimes wear in their ears, which are always
bored, a folded lead, and around their necks a necklace made with the
shell of the cocoa-nut and a small white sea shell."</p>

<p>With reference to the cruelties detailed in Holden's narrative Mr.
Hale goes on to say:</p>

<p>"It should be mentioned that the release of the four Americans who
survived (two of whom got free a short time after their capture), was
voluntary on the part of the natives, a fact which shows that the
feelings of humanity were not altogether extinct in their hearts.
Indeed, though the sufferings of the captives were very great, it did
not appear that they were worse, relatively to the condition in which
the natives themselves lived, than they would have been on any other
island of the Pacific. Men who were actually dying of starvation,
like the people of Tobi, could not be expected to exercise that
kindness towards others which nature refused to them."</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: li}</u></p>

<p>We have quoted this somewhat long passage respecting Lord North's
Island, as having an incidental interest in connexion with M. Barbie
du Bocage's argument; but whatever may really have been the island on
which Sequeira was driven, it seems clear that it could not have been
in the direction of Endeavour Strait as inferred by that
geographer.</p>

<p>Having thus shown the surmises which have been suggested by
geographers of good repute with respect to the main question of the
discovery of Australia in the early part of the sixteenth century,
and explained, as he hopes satisfactorily, the errors into which they
have fallen in their attempts at explanation, the editor will now lay
before the reader his own reasons for concluding that Australia is
the country which these maps describe.</p>

<p>The first question that will naturally arise is--how far does the
country thus represented, correspond in latitude, longitude, and
outline with the recognised surveys of Australia as delineated in
modern maps? And if the discrepancies exposed by the comparison do
not forbid the supposition that Australia is the country represented
on the early maps, the inquiry will then suggest itself--how, with
any satisfactory show of reason, may these discrepancies be accounted
for? To both these questions, the editor believes that he can give
acceptable answers.</p>

<p>And first as respects latitude. In all of these maps, the latitude
of the north of Java, which is the first certain starting point, is
correct. The south coast of Java, or "the lytil Java", though
separated from</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lii}</u></p>

<p>"Java la Grande," or the "Londe of Java," by a narrow channel, as
shown in the maps here given, has no names which indicate any
pretension to a survey. There is enough proximity between the two to
suggest alike the possibility of a connection or of a separation of
the two countries. In the absence of so many words, the maps show as
plainly as possible that it was as yet an unsettled question. With
this fact, therefore, before us, implying, as it does, both
conscientiousness in the statements on the maps, and the confession
of an imperfect survey of the whole of the coasts supposed to be laid
down, we have no difficulty in giving credence to the pretension that
the great southern land there represented was, with all its errors, a
reality and not a fiction. In all fairness, therefore, we pass the
question of junction between the little and the great Java, as a
point virtually declared to be unsettled, and supposing the latter to
be Australia, test our supposition by inquiring as to the correctness
of the latitude in which the coastline terminates on the western
side. Here again we find exact correctness. In the one (Rotz's map),
the line ceases altogether at 35&deg;, the real south-western point
of Australia, and in the other at the same point all description
ceases, and a meaningless line is drawn to the margin of the map,
implying, that no further exploration had been made. On the eastern
side, we have in every respect greater inaccuracy; but for the
present we deal only with the question of latitude. For the sake of
convenience, our reduction of Rotz's map is made to terminate at</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lii}</u></p>

<p>the point where the eastern coast line of "the Londe of Java
terminates," namely in the sixtieth degree, a parallel far exceeding
in. its southing even the southernmost point of Tasmania, which is in
43&deg; 35'; but if we look to the Dauphin map, we find that about
10&deg; of the southernmost portion of the line is indefinite, and it
must not be forgotten that for the Portuguese, this was the remotest
point for investigation, and consequently, the least likely to be
definite. There is, however, strong reasons for supposing that the
eastern side of Tasmania was included within this coast line.</p>

<p>With respect to longitude, it may be advanced that with all the
discrepancies observable in the maps here presented, there is no
other country but Australia lying between the same parallels, and of
the same extent, between the east coast of Africa and the west coast
of America, and that Australia does in reality lie between the same
meridians as the great mass of the country here laid down. In Rotz's
map we have the longitude reckoned from the Cape Verde islands, the
degrees running eastward from 1 to 360. The extreme western point of
the "Londe of Java" is in about 126&deg; (102 E. from Greenwich),
whereas the westernmost point of Australia is in about 113&deg; E.
from Greenwich. The extreme eastern points of "the Londe of Java" is
in about 207&deg; (or 183&deg; E. from Greenwich). The extreme
western point however is on a peak of huge extent, which is a
manifest blunder or exaggeration. The longitude of the easternmost
side, excluding this</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: liv}</u></p>

<p>peak, is in about 187&deg; (or 163&deg; East from Greenwich),
whereas the easternmost point of Australia is in something less than
154 E. from Greenwich. The difficulty of ascertaining the longitude
in those days is well known, and the discoveries which these maps
represent were, in all probability, made on a variety of occasions,
and had a continuous line given to them on maps, not so much as an
exact, but as an approximate guide to subsequent explorers. It were
hard indeed, therefore, if sufficient concession were not made to the
pioneers of maritime exploration, for the reconciliation of these
comparatively and light discrepancies, when inaccuracies as striking
are observable in surveys made as late as in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>Thus in taking a general survey of the outline of this immense
country, we have this one striking fact presented to us, that the
western side is comprised between exactly the same parallels as the
correspooding side of Australia, allowance being made for the
conjunction of Java, while the eastern side presents the same
characteristic as the eastern side of Australia in being by far the
longest.</p>

<p>We now proceed to a more minute examination of the contour of the
coasts. It is to be observed that on the north of the Great Java,
shown in all these manuscript maps which have met the editor's eye,
occurs the word "Sumbava," a fact which, he thinks has never been
noticed by any writer upon these interesting documents. Here is
another instance of the discovery of the north of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lv}</u></p>

<p>an island of which the south has remained unexplored. The peak of
the great Java, on which this name "Sumbava" is laid down, falls into
the right position of the now well-known island of Sumbava, with the
smaller islands of Bali and Lombok, lying between it and Java, and
with Flores and Timor duly described towards the eastward. The reason
of the south coast of these islands remaining for so long unexplored
may be found in the description of Java by Barros, the Portuguese
historian, who wrote in the middle of the sixteenth century. He
says:</p>

<p>"The natives of Sunda, in dissecting Java, speak of it as
separated by the river Chiamo from the island of Sunda on the west
and on the east by a strait from the island of Bali; as having Madura
on the north, and on the south an undiscovered sea; and they think
that whoever shall proceed beyond these straits, will be hurried away
by strong currents, so as never to be able to return, and for this
reason they never attempt to navigate it, in the same manner as the
Moor on the eastern coast of Africa do not venture to pass the Cape
of Currents. The earliest mention that the editor has noticed of a
passage to the south of Java, is in the account of the "Four
Hollanders' Ships' Voyage, being the First Voyage of the Dutch to the
East Indies." See <i>Oxford Collection of Voyages</i> vol ii, p. 417.
Under date of the 14th March, 1597, it is said: "The wind blew still
south-east, sometimes more southward and sometimes eastward, being
under 14&deg;, and a good sharp gale, holding our course
west-south-west. There we found</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lvi}</u></p>

<p>that Java is not so broad nor stretcheth itself so much southward
as it is set down in the card; for, if it were, we should have passed
clean through the middle of the land." Supposing, then, that the
Portuguese navigators have lighted upon the west coast of Australia,
and have regarded it as a possible extension to the southward of the
already known island of Java; let us proceed to test the correctness
of this supposition by the contour of the coast of the western side.
A single glance of the eye will suffice to detect the general
resemblance. It is probable that the two great indentures are Exmouth
Gulf and Shark Bay, and we may fairly conclude we detect Houtman's
Abrolhos in about their proper parallel of from 28&deg; to 29&deg;
south latitude. To attempt a minute investigation of the whole coast
upon data so indefinite would be of course unreasonable, but on this
western side at least the similarity is sufficient, we think, on
every ground to establish its identity with the west coast of
Australia. On the eastern side the discrepancies are much greater.
Having already spoken of the latitude and longitude, we now speak
merely of the outline of the coast. In the ancient map we see no huge
promontory, terminating in Cape York, but let the reader recall the
suggestion that the visits to these coasts were made on various
occasions, and naturally less frequently to the eastern than to the
western side, and let the result of these considerations be that the
promontory may have been altogether unvisited or ignored, and we
shall have forthwith an explanation of the form of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lvii}</u></p>

<p>the north-east coast line on the early maps. Let a line be drawn
from the southernmost point of the Gulf of Carpentaria to Halifax
Bay, and the form of outline referred to is detected immediately. Nor
is this conjecture without corroboration from the physical features
of the country. On the ancient map we find several rivers laid down
along the north-east coast. If we examine the corresponding coast in
the Gulf of Carpentaria, those rivers are seen to exist; whereas from
Cape York all along the coast of Australia to the twenty-second or
twenty-third degree, there is not even an indication of a river
emptying itself into the sea. The great number of islands and reefs
laid down along the north-east coast of the early maps coincides with
the Great Barrier Reefs, and with the Cumberland and Northumberland
islands, and a host of others which skirt this part of the shores of
Australia. "Coste dangereuse", "Bay perdue", and "R. de beaucoup
d'Isles", are names which we readily concede to be appropriate to
portions of such a coast. The name "Coste des Herbaiges", which we
have already spoken of as having been erroneously supposed by many
geographers to apply to Botany Bay, was probably given to that part
of the coast where the first symptoms of fertility were observed in
passing southward, the more northern portions of the shore being for
the most part dry and barren. That it is an error to connect the name
with Botany Bay has already been shown, at pxxxiv, and the editor
must not fail to state that the unanswerable reason there adduced
was</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lviii}</u></p>

<p>derived from a judicious observation made to him by the late
distinguished Dr. Brown, who not only, as Humboldt has described him
was, "Botanices facile princeps", but himself acquainted with the
locality of which he spoke.</p>

<p>The remainder of the coast southward is too irregularly laid down
both as to latitude and longitude, and consequently as to correctness
of conformation, to admit of any useful conjecture. It must be
supposed from the conscienciousness observable in the delineation of
other parts of the country, that this portion was laid down more
carelessly, or with less opportunity of taking observations. It is by
no means improbable, from the length of this coast line, that "Baye
Neufve" is Bass's Straits; that "Gouffre" is Oyster Bay in Tasmania;
and that the survey really ceased at the south of that island. That
the continuity of the coast forms no ground of objection to this
conjecture may be shown by the fact that on "a general chart
exhibiting the discoveries made by Captain Cook, by Lieut. H.
Roberts", the coast is continuous to the south of Van Dieman's Land,
Bass's Straits being then of course undiscovered.</p>

<p>It may also be fairly presumed that the islands in the extreme
east of our extract from the Dauphin map, represent New Zealand.</p>

<p>If the above reasons have sufficient weight in them to justify the
supposition that the extensive country thus laid down in those early
maps is really Australia, it becomes a question of the highest
interest to ascertain, as nearly as may be, by whom, and at what
date, the discovery of this country was made.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lix}</u></p>

<p>The maps upon which the supposition of the discovery is alone
founded are all in French, and that they are all repetitions, with
slight variations, from one source, is shown by the fact that the
inaccuracies are alike in all of them. But although the maps are in
French, there are, indications of Portuguese in some of the names,
such as "Terre ennegade", a Gallicized form of "Tierra anegada",
i.e., "land under water", or "sunken shoal", "Gracal", and "cap de
Fromose". The question then arises, were the French or the Portuguese
the discoverers? In reply, we present the following statement.</p>

<p>In the year 1529, a voyage was made to Sumatra, by Jean Parmentier
of Dieppe and in this voyage he died. Parmentier was a poet, and a
classical scholar, as well as a navigator and a good hydrographer. He
was accompanied in this voyage by his intimate friend, the poet
Pierre Crignon, who, on his return to France, published, in 1531, the
poems of Parmentier, with a prologue containing his eulogium, in
which he says of him, that he was "le premier Francois qui a
entrepris a estre pilotte pour mener navires a la Terre Amerique
qu'on dit Bresil, et semblablement le premier Francois qui a
descouvert les Indes jusqu'a l'Isle de Taprobane, et, si mort ne
l'eust pas prevenu, je crois qu'il eust ete jusques aux Moluques."
This is a high authority upon this point, coming as it does from a
man of education, and a shipmate and intimate of Parmentier himself.
The French, then, were not in the South Seas beyond Sumatra, before
1529. The date of the earliest of our quoted</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lx}</u></p>

<p>maps is not earlier than 1535, as it contains the discovery of the
St. Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in that year; but even let us suppose
it no earlier than that of Rotz, which bears the date of 1542, and
ask, what voyages of the French in the South Seas do we find between
the years 1529 and 1542? Neither the Abbe Raynal, nor any modern
French writer, nor even antiquaries, who have entered most closely
into the history of early French explorations, as for example, M.
Leon Guerin, the author of the <i>Histoire Maritime de France</i>,
Paris, 1843, 8 vo.; and of <i>Les Navigateurs Francais</i>, 8 vo.,
Paris, 1847, offer the slightest pretension that the French made
voyages to those parts, in the early part or middle of the sixteenth
century. Now we do know from Barros and Galvano that, at the close of
1511, Albuquerque sent from Malacca, Antonio de Breu, and Francisco
Serrano, with three ships to Banda and Malacca. They passed along the
east side of Sumatra to Java, and thence by Madura, Bali, Sumbava,
Solor, etc., to Papua or New Guinea. From thence they went to the
Moluccas and to Amboyna. See <i>Barros</i>, d. 3, 1. 5, c. 6, p. 131,
and <i>Galvano, translated by Hakluyt</i>, p. 378. Here we have the
very islands, forming the northern portion of the Grande Jave, at
this early date; but that which is totally wanting between this and
1529, is the account of the various explorations of the eastern and
western coasts of the vast country described under that name. It is
certain, moreover, that France was at that time too poor, and too
much embroiled in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxi}</u></p>

<p>political anxieties, to busy itself with extensive nautical
explorations. Had she so done, the whole of North America and Brazil
might now have belonged to her. At the same time, however, we know
that the Portuguese had establishments before 1529, in the East
Indian Islands, and the existence of Portuguese names on the
countries of which we speak, as thus delineated on these French maps,
is in itself an acknowledgment of their discovery by the Portuguese,
as assuredly the jealousy implied in the sentence, quoted at p. vi of
this introduction, from Pierre Crignon's Prologue, would not only
have made the French most ready to lay claim to all they could in the
shape of discovery, but would have prevented any gratuitous insertion
of Portuguese names on such remote countries, had they themselves
discovered them.</p>

<p>But, further, as an important part of the argument, the reader
must not overlook that jealousy of the Portuguese, to which allusion
has already been made (p. v), in forbidding the communication of all
hydrographical information respecting their discoveries in these
seas. As regards the surmises of M. Barbie du Bocage respecting the
probable causes of the suppression or concealment of such documents,
his carefulness and ingenuity entitle them to the best consideration;
and if these documents really exist in France, or Rome, or elsewhere,
it is much to be hoped that they may ere long be brought to light.
His Excellency the Count de Lavradio, ambassador from Portugal to the
Court of St. James, has obligingly set</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxii}</u></p>

<p>on foot inquiries at Rome for the purpose of elucidating this
subject, which have not, however, produced any successful result.</p>

<p>But although we have no evidence to show that the French made any
original discoveries in the South Seas in the first half of the
sixteenth century, we have the evidence that they were good
hydrographers. Crignon describes Parmentier as "bon cosmographe et
geographe", and says, "par luy ont este composez plusieurs mapemondes
en globe et en plat, et maintes cartes marines sus les quelles
plusieurs ont havigue seurement". It is dangerous to draw conclusions
from negatives; but it is both legitimate and desireable that we
should give due weight to evidence of high probability when such fall
within our notice. If all the French maps we have quoted are, as has
been shown, derived from one source, since they all contain the same
errors; and if Parmentier, who was a good hydrographer, was the only
French navigator we find mentioned as having gone so far as Sumatra
before the period of the earliest of these maps; and further, if
these maps exhibit Portuguese names laid down in these maps on a
country beyond Parmentier's furthest point of exploration, we think
the inference not unreasonable that Parmentier may have laid down,
from Portuguese maps, the information which has been copied into
those we have quoted, and that the descriptions round the coast,
which are all (as may be plainly seen), with the exception of those
which bear the stamp of Portuguese, convertible into French, have</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxiii}</u></p>

<p>been naturally written by French mapmakers, in that language. We
can but throw out this suggestion for <i>quantum valeat</i>. All
positive evidence, in spite of labourious research, is wanting. The
earliest Portuguese portolani which have met the editor's eye are
those of Joham Freire, of 1546 and of Diego Homem, of 1558. Both
these are silent on the subject. That of Lazaro Luis and of Vas
Dourado, later in the century, both examined by Dr. Martin in Lisbon,
are equally so. But this has been already accounted for. It is true
that, in a mappemonde of the data of 1526, by one Franciscus monachus
ordinis Franciscanorum, copied into the atlas to the <i>Geographic du
Moyen Age</i> of Joachim Lelewel the great Terra Australis, extending
along the south of the globe from Tierra del Fuego, is laid down with
the words "Is nobis detecta existet", and "haec pars ore nondum
cognita"; but this is plainly nothing more than a fanciful extension
of Magellan's discovery of the north coast of Tierra del Fuego,
combined with the old supposition of the existence of a great
southern continent.</p>

<p>A similar remark occurs in the manuscript portolano of Ioan
Martinez, of Messina, of the date of 1567, in the British Museum; and
in the fifth map of the portolano of the same hydrographer, of the
date of 1578, is laid down "Meridional discoperta novamente", with no
names on it, and only showing the north part. The extent of what is
seen is twice as long as Java Major, which seems here to be</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxiv}</u></p>

<p>Sumatra. It is observable that Petan and Maletur, here occurring
on or near the Terra Australis of other maps of about this date,
occur here, but close under Java Minor, which is a long way to the
west of the "Meridional discoperta novamente".</p>

<p>In 1526 the Portuguese commander, Don Jorge de Meneses, in his
passage from Malacca to the Moluccas, was carried by currents and,
through his want of information respecting the route, to the north
coast of Papua, which we now know as New Guinea; and in the following
year we find Don Alvaro de Saavedra, a Spaniard, and kinsman of the
great Cortes, despatched from New Spain to the Moluccas, and also
lighting on New Guinea, where he passed a month; but nowhere in the
allusions to these voyages do we find reference to the great southern
land, which is land drawn with so much detail under the name of "La
Grande Jave".</p>

<p>Our surmises, therefore, lead us to regard it as highly probable
that Australia was discovered by the Portuguese between the years
1511 and 1529, and, almost a demonstrable certainty, that it was
discovered before the year 1542.</p>

<p>A notion may be formed of the knowledge possessed by the Spaniards
in the middle of the sixteenth century, on the part of the world on
which we treat, from the following extract from a work entitled, "El
libro de las costumbres de todas las gentes del mundo y de las
Indias". Translated and compiled by the Bachelor Francisco Themara
Antwerp, 1556:--"Thirty leagues from Java the Less is Gatigara,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxv}</u></p>

<p>19&deg; the other side of the equinoctial towards the south. Of
the lands beyond this point nothing is known, for navigation has not
been extended further, and it is impossible to proceed by land on
account of the numerous lakes and lofty mountains in those parts. It
is even said that there is the site of the Terrestrial Paradise".
Although this was not originally written in Spanish, but was
translated from Johannes Bohemus it would scarcely have been given
forth to the Spaniards had better information on the subject existed
among that people.</p>

<p>It has already been stated in this Introduction, that in, the
early engraved maps of the sixteenth century, there occur apparent
indications of Australia, with names and sentences, descriptive of
the country so represented, derived from the narrative of Marco Polo,
with an intimation that some of these representations may not have
emanated solely from that narrative. The earliest of these occurs on
a mappemonde in the third volume of the polyglot bible of Arias
Montanus, and the indication of Australia there given is the more
striking that it stands unconnected with any other land whatever, and
bears no kind of description. It is simply a line indicating the
north part of an unexplored land, exactly in the position of the
north of Australia, distinctly implying an imperfect discovery, but
not copied from, or bearing any resemblance to any indication of the
kind in any previous map with which the editor is acquainted.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxvi}</u></p>

<p>In Thevet's <i>Cosmographie Universelle</i>, Paris, 1575, is a map
with Taprobane, La Grand Jave, Petite Jave, Partie de la Terre
Australe, and in tom. i, liv. 12, the following passage:</p>

<p>"L'art et pratique du navigage est le plus penible et dangerex de
toutes les sciences, que oncques les hommes ayent inventees, veu que
l'homme s'expose a la mercy des abysmes de ce grand ocean, qui
environne et abbreuve toute la terre. Davatage, avec ceste Esquille
lon peult visiter presque toute ce que le monde continent en sa
rotondite, soit vers la mer glaciale, ou les deux poles, et terre
Australe, qui n'est, encor comme ie croy descouverte mais selon mon
opinion d'aussi grande estendue que l'Asie ou l'Afrique, et laquelle
un iour sera; recherchee par le moyen de ce petit instrument
navigatoire, quelque long voyage qui y peust estre."</p>

<p>In Dalrymple's <i>Hist. Coll. of Voyages in the South Pacific
Ocean</i>, Juan Fernandez is said to have discovered the southern
continent. Burney, who speaks of his doscovery of the southern
continent (vol. i, p. 300), refers to the memorial of Juan Luis Arias
for the description. See the first article in the present
collection.</p>

<p>It is needless here to repeat the names and sentences already
described as given on early engraved maps from Marco Polo, but it
will be well to notice such peculiarities as distinguish these maps
from those in manuscript, which we have already been speaking of as
probably representing Australia under the name of La Grande Jave.
Such notice is the more interesting as the date of these engraved</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxvii}</u></p>

<p>maps is intermediate between that of the manuscript documents and
the period of the authenticated discovery of Australia. In the 1587
edition of Ortelius is a map entitled "Typus Orbis Terrarum", in
which <i>New Guinea is made an island</i>, with the words "Nova
Guinea quae an sit insula aut pars continentis Australis incertum".
On the Terra Australis, here brought up far more to the north than
elsewhere, and separated from New Guinea only by a strait, are the
words, "Hanc continentem Australem non nulli Magellanicam regionem ab
ejus inventore nuncupant." While the sentence shows how indefinite
was the idea of the extent of Australia towards the south, we think
that the entire delineation, which brings the great Terra Australis
so far northward in this longitude into connexion with New Guinea,
goes far to show that Australia had really been discovered.</p>

<p>In various editions of Mercator occur copies of a map entitled
"Orbis Terrae Compendiosa descriptio quam ex magna universali Gerardi
Mercatoris Rumoldus Mercator fieri curabat anno 1587", in which
similar indications are given to those in the map of Ortelius just
described.</p>

<p>In the map of Peter Plancius, given in the English edition of the
voyages of Linschoten, 1598, similar indications of Australia occur,
but leaving the question of the insular character of New Guinea
doubtful.</p>

<p>In the <i>Speculum Orbis</i> of C. de Judaeis, Antwerp, 1592, is a
map entitled "Brasilia et Peruvia", on which occurs "Chaesdia seu
Australis Terra quam</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxviii}</u></p>

<p>nautarum vulgus Tierra di Fuego vacant, alii Psittacorum Terram".
In the map of Asia, in the same Volume, a tract is laid down which,
by comparison with Ortelius' map of the Pacific Ocean, is plainly New
Guinea; and on both these maps, on the west coast of said tract, are
the words "Tierra baixa", which seems to tally with "Baie Basse", at
about the corresponding point on the manuscript maps, and is
confirmatory of the conclusion which the editor had formed. In the
same volume is a map of the Antartic hemisphere, in which the Terra
Australis incognita is brought high up to the north in the longitude
of Australia. On that part of it opposite the Cape of Good Hope is
the following legend: "Lusitani bonae spei legentes capitis
promontorium hanc terram austrum versus extare viderunt, sed nondum
imploravere", a significant sentence if allowance be made for the
difficulty at that time of reckoning the longitude.</p>

<p>In the map to illustrate the voyages of Drake and Cavendish by
Jodocus Hondius, of which a fac-simile was given in <i>The World
Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake</i>, printed for our Socity, New
Guinea is made a complete island, without a word to throw a doubt on
the correctness of the representation; while the Terra Australis
which is separated from New Guinea, only by a strait, has an outline
remarkably similar to that of the Gulf of Carpentaria. These
indications give to this map an especial interest, and the more so
that it is shown to be earlier than the passage of Torres through
Torres' Straits in 1606, by its bearing</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxix}</u></p>

<p>the arms of Queen Elizabeth, before the unicorn of Scotland had
displaced the dragon of England.</p>

<p>In the article "Terra Australis", in Cornelius Wytfliet's
<i>Descriptionis Ptolemaicae Augmentum</i>, Louvain, 1598, we find
the following passage:--</p>

<p>"The 'Australis Terra' is the most southern of all lands, and is
separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its shores are hitherto
but little known, since after one voyage and another, that route has
been deserted, and seldom is the country visited unless when sailors
are driven there by storms. The 'Australis Terra' begins at two or
three degrees from the equator, and is maintained by some to be of so
great an extent, that if it were thoroughly explored, it would be
regarded as a fifth part of the world."</p>

<p>The above sifnificant statement was printed, it will be
remembered, before any discovery of Australia of which we have an
authentic account.</p>

<p>But while examining these indications of a discovery of Australia
in the sixteenth century, it will be asked what explorations had been
made by the Spaniards in that part of the world in the course of that
century. From the period of the voyage of Don Alvaro de Saavedra to
the Moluccas in 1527, already alluded to, we neet with no such active
spirit of exploration on the part of the Spaniards in the South Seas.
Embarrassed by his political position, and with an exhausted
treasury, the emperor, in 1529, definitely renounced his pretensions
to the Moluccas for a sum of money, although he retained his claim to
the islands discovered by his subjects to the east of the line of
demarcation now confined to</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxx}</u></p>

<p>the Portuguese. In 1542 an unsuccessful attempt to form a
settlement in the Philippine Islands was made by Ruy de Villalobos,
but its failure having been attributed to mismanagement, a new
expedition in 1564 was despatched with the like object under Miguel
Lopez de Legaspi, which was completely successful, and a Spanish
colony was established at Zebu. It is not impossible that this
settlement gave rise to voyages of discovery about this time by the
Spaniards, of which no accounts have been published. In 1567, Alvaro
de Mendana sailed from Callao on a voyage of discovery in which he
discovered the Solomon Islands and several others. There are great
discrepancies in the different relations of this voyage. In 1595 he
made a second voyage from Peru, in which he discovered the Marquesas,
and the group afterwards named by Carteret, Queen Charlotte's
Islands. The object of this expedition was to found a colony on the
Solomon Islands, which he had discovered in his previous voyage, but
from the incorrectness of his reckoning he was unable to find them.
In the island of Santa Cruz he attempted to establish a colony, but
without success, and in this island he died. In this second voyage he
had for his chief pilot Pedro Fernandez Quiros, who may be regarded
as the last of the distinguished mariners of Spain, and whose name
claims special notice in a work treating of the early indications of
Australia, although he himself never saw the shores of that great
continental island.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<blockquote>[*1) For the account of this voyage see a letter from
Quiros to Don Antonio de Morga, cap. vi, p. 29, of de Morga's
<i>Sucesos en las Islas Filipinas</i>, Mexico, 1609, 4to.; and
Figueroa's <i>Hechos de Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, quarto Marques
de Canete</i>, Madrid, 1613, 4to., 1. 6, p. 238.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lvxxi}</u></p>

<p>The discovery of the island of Santa Cruz suggested to the mind of
Quiros that the great southern continent was at length discovered,
and in two memoirs addressed by him to Don L. de Velasco, viceroy of
Peru, we meet with the first detailed argument upon this great
geographical question, which, though he himself was not destined to
demonstrate it by an actual discovery, may nevertheless be said to
have been indirectly brought to a solution through his
instrumentality. It is true that it is difficult in dealing with
these vague surmises respecting the existence of a southern continent
to draw distinctions between Australia itself and the great continent
discovered in the present century, some twenty or thirty degrees to
the south of that vast island. It has been already stated, that
Dalrymple, nearly two centuries later, earnestly advocated the same
cause as De Quiros had done, and speaking, of that navigator he says:
"The <i>discovery</i> of the southern continent, <i>whenever</i> and
<i>whomsoever</i> it may be completely effected, is in <i>justice</i>
due to this <i>immortal</i> name." It should be premised that there
are, in fact, three points of ambiguity in connexion with the name of
that navigator, which it is well at once to state, as they might
mislead the judgment of the superficial reader of the history of
navigation of that period as to his connexion with the discovery of
Australia.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxii}</u></p>

<p>In the first place, though generally reputed to be a Spaniard, he
is described by Nicholas Antonio, the author of the <i>Bibliotheca
Hispana</i>, himself a Spaniard, and not unwilling, it may be
supposed to claim so distinguished a navigator for his countryman, as
"Lusitanus. Eborensis, ut aiunt Lusitani", (a Portuguese, stated by
the Portuguese to be a native of Evora), and the style of his
writings bears out the supposition. Secondly, Antonio de Ulloa, in
his <i>Resumen</i>, p. 119, quotes from an account of the voyage of
Quiros said to be given in the <i>Historia de la Religion Serafica of
Diego de Cordova</i>, (a work which the editor has not met with) the
discovery of a large island in <i>twenty-eight degrees</i> south
latitude, which latitude is further south than Quiros or his
companions are otherwise known to have made in any voyage. Thirdly,
the printed memoirs of Quiros bear the title of Terra Australis
Incognita, while the southern Tierra Austral, discovered by Quiros
himself, and surnamed by him "del Espiritu Santo", is none other than
the "New Hebrides", of the maps of the present day.</p>

<p>At the same time, to both Quiros and Dalrymple we are indirectly
indebted for the earliest designation which attaches in any sense to
the modern nomenclature connected with Australia, viz., for the name
of Torres Straits. That Quiros, whether by birth a Portuguese or a
Spaniard, was in the Spanish service, cannot be doubted, The viceroy
of Peru had warmly entertained his projects, but looked upon its
execution as beyond the limits of his own power</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxiii}</u></p>

<p>to put into operation. He therefore urged to Quiros to lay his
case before the Spanish monarch at Madrid, and furnished him with
letters to strengthen his application. Whether Philip III was more
influenced by the arguments of De Quiros, as to the discovery of a
southern continent, or rather by the desire to explore the route
between Spain and America by the east, in the hope of discovering
wealthy islands between New Guinea and China, we need not pause to
question. It is possible that both these motives had their weight,
for Quiros was despatched to Peru with full orders for the carrying
out of his plans, addressed to the Viceroy, the Count de Monterey;
and he was amply equipped with two well-armed vessels and a corvette,
with which he sailed from Callao on the 21st of December, 1605. Luis
Vaez de Torres was commander of the <i>Almirante</i> or second ship,
in this expedition. The voyage was looked upon as cne of very great
importance; and Torquemada, in his account of it in the "Monarquia
Indiana", says the ships were the strongest and best armed which had
been seen in those seas. The object was to make a settlement at the
island of Santa Cruz, and from thence to search for the Tierra
Austral, or southern continent.</p>

<p>After the discovery of several islands, Quiros came to a land
which he named Australia del Espiritu Santo, supposing it to be part
of the great southern continent. At midnight on the 11th of June,
1606, while the three ships were lying at anchor in the bay which
they had named San Felipe and Santiago,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxiv}</u></p>

<p>Quiros, for reasons which are not known, and without giving any
signal or notice, was separated from the other two ships.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the separation, Torres found that the Australia
del Espititu Santo was an island, and then continued his course
westward in pursuance of the exploration. In about the month of
August, 1606 he fell in with a coast in 11&frac12;&deg; south lat.,
which he calls the beginning of New Guinea; apparently the
south-eastern part of the land afterwards named Louisiade by M. de
Bougainville, and now known to be a chain of islands. As he could not
pass to windward of this land, Torres bore away along its south side,
and himself gives the following account of his subsequent course. "We
went along three hundred leagues of coast, as I have mentioned, and
diminished the latitude 2&frac12;&deg;, which brought us into 9&deg;.
From hence we fell in with a bank of from three to nine fathoms;
which extends along the coast above one hundred and eighty leagues.
We went over it, along the coast, to 7&frac12;&deg; south latitude;
and the end of it is in 5&deg;. We could not go further on for the
many shoals and great currents, so we were obliged to sail
south-West, in that depth, to 11&deg; south lat. There is all over it
an archipelago of islands without number, by which we passed; and at
the end of the eleventh degree the bank became shoaler. Here were
very large islands, and there appeared more to the southward were
inhabited by black people, very corpulent and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxv}</u></p>

<p>naked. Their arms were lances, arrows, and clubs of stone ill
fashioned. We could not get any of their arms. We caught in all this
land, twenty persons of different nations, that with them we might be
able to make a better account to Your Majesty. They give much notice
of other people, although as yet they do not make themselves well
understood. We were upon this bank two months at the end of which
time we found ourselves in twenty-five fathoms and 5&deg; south
latitude, and ten leagues from the coast; and having gone four
hundred and eighty leagues here, the coast goes to the north-east. I
did not search it, for the bank became very shallow. So we stood to
the north."</p>

<p>The very large islands seen by Torres in the 11th degree of south
latitude are evidently the hills of Cape-York; and the two months of
intricate navigation, the passage through the strait that separates
Australia from New Guinea. A copy of this letter of Torres was
fortunately lodged in the archives of Manilla; and it was not until
that city was taken, in 1762, by the English, that the document was
discovered by Dalrymple, who paid a fitting tribute to the memory of
this distinguished Spanish navigator, by giving to this dangerous
passage the name of Torres' Straits, which it has ever since
retained. The editor has striven in vain to learn into whose hands
Dalrymple's copy of this letter has fallen. He has been compelled,
therefore, to reprint it from Dalrymple's translation, supplied to
Admiral Burney, as inserted at the end of vol. ii of his
<i>Discoveries and Voyages in the South Seas</i>.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxvi}</u></p>

<p>De Quiros himself reached Mexico on the 3rd of October, 1606, nine
months from his departure from Callao. Strongly imbued with a sense
of importance of his discoveries, he addressed various memoirs to
Philip III, advocating the desirableness of further explorations in
these unknown regions; but, after years on unavailing perseverance,
he died at Panama in 1614, leaving behind him a name which for merit,
though not for success, was second only to that of Columbus, and with
him expired the naval heroism of Spain. "Reasoning", as Dalrymple
says, "from principles of science and deep reflection, he asserted
the <i>existence</i> of a southern continent and devoted with
unwearied though condemned diligence, the remainder of his life to
the prosecution of this sublime conception." In the first document
printed in this collection, which is from the hand of the Fray Juan
Luis Arias, is given an account of his earnest advocacy of the
resuscitation of Spanish enterprise in the southern seas, and
especially with reference to the great southern continent.</p>

<p>But while the glory of Spanish naval enterprise was thus on the
wane, the very nation which Spain had bruised and persecuted was to
supplant her in the career of adventure and prosperity. The war of
independence had aroused the energies of those provinces of the
Netherlands which had freed themselves from the Spanish yoke; while
the cruelties perpetrated in those provinces which the Spaniards had
succeeded in again subduing, drove an almost incredible number of
families into exile. The majority of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxvii}</u></p>

<p>these settled in the northern provinces, and thus brought into
them a prodigious influx of activity. Among these emigrants were a
number of enterprising merchants, chiefly from Antwerp,--a town which
had for many years enjoyed a most considerable, though indirect,
share in the trans-Atlantic trade of Spain and Portugal, and was well
acquainted with its immense advantages. These men were naturally
animated by the bitter hatred of exiles, enhanced by difference of
faith and the memory of many wrongs. The idea that arose among them
was, to deprive Spain of her trans-Atlantic commerce, and thus to
cripple her resources, and strengthen those of the Protestants, and
by this means eventually to force the southern provinces of the
Netherlands from their oppressors. This idea, at first vaguely
entertained by a few, became general when the Spaniards forbed Dutch
vessels to carry on any traffic with Spain. This traffic had existed
in spite of the wars, and had furnished the Dutch with the principal
means of carrying it on.</p>

<p>Being thus violently thrust out of their share in trans-Atlantic
commerce, the Dutch determined to gain it back with interest.
Geography and hydrography now became the subjects of earnest study
and instruction; and the period was distinguished by the appearance
of such men as Ortelius, Mercator, Plancius, De Bry, Hulsius,
Cluverius, etc., whom we are now bound to regard as the fathers of
modern geography. Among these the most earnest in turning the
resources of science into a weapon against the oppressors</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxviii}</u></p>

<p>of his country, was Peter Plancius, a Calvinist clergyman, who
opened a nautical and geographical school at Amsterdam for the
express purpose of teaching his countrymen how to find a way to
India, and the other sources whence Spain derived her strength. We do
not here dwell on their efforts to find a northern route to the east.
Their knowledge of the direct route to that wealthy portion of the
world had become greatly increased by the appearance of Jan Huyghen
van Linschoten's great work. (Amst., 1595-96.) Linschoten had, for
fourteen years, lived in the Portuguese possessions in the East, and
had there collected a vast amount of information. The Dutch East
India Company was established in 1602; and in 1606 we find a vessel
from Holland making the first <i>authenticated</i> discovery of that
great south land which in our own time has been designated--at the
suggestion of that worthy navigator, Matthew Flinders, to whom we are
so largely indebted for our knowledge of the hydrography of that
country--by the distinct and appropriate name of Australia.</p>

<p>Of the discoveries made by the Dutch on the coast of Australia,
ancestors of a hundred years ago, and even the Dutch themselves knew
but little. That which was known was preserved in the <i>Relations de
divers voyages curieux</i> of Meichisedech Thevenot (Paris, 1663-72,
fol.); in the <i>Noord en Oost Tartarye</i> of Nicolas Witsen,
(Amst., 1692-1705, fol.); in Valentyn's <i>Oud en Nieuw Oost
Indien</i> (Amst., 1724-26, fol.); and in the <i>Inleidning tot de
algemeen Geographie</i></p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxix}</u></p>

<p>of Nicolas Struyk (Amst., 1740, 4to.). We have, however, since
gained a variety of information through a document which fell into
the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, and was published by Alexander
Dalrymple, at that time hydrographer to the Admiralty and the East
India Company, in his collection concerning Papua. This curious and
interesting document is a copy of the instructions to Commodore Abel
Jansz Tasman for his second voyage of discovery. That distinguished
commander had already, in 1642, discovered not only the island now
named after him, Tasmania (but more generally known as Van Dieman's
Land, in compliment to the then governor of the Dutch East India
Company at Batavia), but New Zealand also; and, passing around the
east side of Australia, but without seeing it, sailed on his return
voyage along the northern shores of New Guinea. In January 1644 he
was despatched on his second voyage; and his instructions, signed by
the Governor-General Antonio Van Diemen, and the members of the
council, are prefaced by a recital, in chronological order, of the
previous discoveries of the Dutch. The document is reprinted in the
present volume.</p>

<p>From this recital, combined with a passage from Saris, given in
Purchas, Vol. i, p, 385, we learn that, "On the 18th of November,
1605, the Dutch yacht the <i>Duyfhen</i> (the Dove), was despatched
from Bantam to explore the islands of New Guinea, and that she sailed
along what was thought to be the west side of that country, to
19&frac34;&deg; of south latitude." This extensive country was found,
for the greatest part, desert;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxx}</u></p>

<p>but in some places inhabited by wild, cruel black savages, by whom
some of the crew were murdered; for which reason they could not learn
anything of the land or waters, as had been desired of them; and from
want of provisions, and other necessities, they were obliged to leave
the discovery unfinished. The furthest point of the land, in their
maps, was called Cape Keer Weer, or "Turn Again". As Flinders
observes, "the course of the <i>Duyfhen</i> from New Guinea was
southward, along the islands on the west side of Torres Strait, to
that part of Terra Australis a little to the west and south of Cape
York. But all those lands were thought to be connected, and to form
the west coast of Guinea". Thus, without being conscious of it the
commander of the <i>Duyfhen</i> made the first <i>authenticated</i>
discovery of any part of the great south land about the month of
March 1606; for it appears that he had returned to Banda in or before
the beginnirg of June of that year.</p>

<p>The second expedition mentioned in the Dutch recital for the
discovery of the great south land, was undertaken in a yacht in the
year 1617, by order of the Fiscal d'Edel, with little success and the
journals and remarks were not to be found; but various ships outward
bound from Holland to the East Indies, in the course of the years
1616, 1618, 1619, and 1622, made discoveries on the west coast of the
great unknown south land, from 35&deg; to 22&deg; south latitude, and
among them the ship <i>Eendragt</i> (the Concord) commanded by Dirk
Hartog, Hertoge, or Hartighs, of Amsterdam, fell in with land in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxi}</u></p>

<p>about 25&deg; south, which afterwards received its name from this
ship. The president, De Brosses, has fallen into the error of
describing Dirk Hartog as a native of Eendragt, adding that this
coast has preserved the name of the vessel, and that of the country
of its commander. The Dutch recital which mentions the voyage of the
<i>Eendragt</i>, does not give Hartog's name, but we learn it from a
MS. chart by Hessel Gerritz, of Amsterdam, 1627, referred to by
Dalrymple in his collection concerning Papua, note, page 6. An
important part of Hartog's discovery was Dirk Hartog's Roads, at the
entrance of the sound, afterwards called by Dampier, Shark's Bay, in
25&deg;; and on Dirk Hartog's island, one of the islands forming the
road, he left a tin plate, bearing the following inscription: <i>Anno
1616 den 25sten October is hier vangecomen het schip de Endracht van
Amsterdam, den Oppercoopmen Gilles Mibais van Amsterdam, den 27sten.
dito t' Zeijl gegaen na Bantam, den Ondercoopman Jan Stoyn,
Opperstiermann Pieter Dockes van Bil Anno 1616.</i> Of which the
following is a translation: <i>On the 25th of October, 1616, arrived
here the ship Endraght, of Amsterdam; the first merchant, Gilles
Mibais Van Luyck; Captain Dirck Hartog, of Amsterdam; the 27th ditto
set sail for Bantam; undermerchant, Jan Stoyn; upper steersman,
Pieter Dockes, from Bil. Anno 1616.</i></p>

<p>In 1697, this plate was found by Wilhelm Van Vlaming, Captain of
the <i>Geelvink</i>, of whose voyage we shall have to speak in due
course, and was</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxii}</u></p>

<p>replaced by another on which the inscription was copied, and the
following new inscription added:</p>

<p>In the account of the voyage of discovery made to the south by the
corvettes <i>Geographe</i> and <i>Naturaliste</i>,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxiii}</u></p>

<p>in the years 1800, 1802, 1803, and 1804, published by F. Peron,
Vol i, chap. 10, p. 193, we find, that in the month of July 1801,
Captain Hamelin of the <i>Naturaliste</i>, resolved on sailing to the
extremity of Shark's Bay; but he first dispatched three men to Dirck
Hartog's island, for the purpose of signalizing the <i>Geographe</i>,
in case it should heave in sight at the entrance to the bay. On
returning from Dirck Hartog's island, the botswain brought with them
the plate of tin thus described. It was about six inches in diameter,
and the inscriptions were described as coursely cut. The plate was
found on the north point of the island which was named in consequence
the Cape of the Inscription; it was then half covered with sand,
lying near an oaken post, on which it seemed to have been originally
nailed. Having copied the inscriptions, Captain Hamelin had a new
post made, and sent back the plate to be refixed on the same spot
from which it had been taken; he would have looked upon it as
sacrilege to have kept on board this plate, which, for nearly two
centuries, had been spared by nature, and by those who might have
observed it before him. He himself also placed on the north-east part
of this island a second plate, on which were inscribed the name of
his corvette, and the date of his arrival on those shores. In the
translation given in Peron's work of the earlier of these two
inscriptions, a droll mistake is made by an error in punctuation, as
will be seen by comparing the original inscription, with the
following:</p>

<p>"1616. Le 25 Octobre</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxiv}</u></p>

<p>est arrive ici le naviere 1' Endraght d' Amsterdam: premier
marchand, Gilles Miebais Van Luck; capitaine, Dirck Hartighs
d'Amsterdam; it remit sous voile le 27 du memo mois; Bantum etoit
sous marchand; Janstins premier pilote: Pieter Ecoores Van-Bu...Anne
1616:"</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen, that Bantam, in Java, for which they set
sail, is transformed into the under-merchant, and the person who
really held that post is converted into chief pilot, while poor
Pieter Dockes, whose name, perhaps more feebly scratched at the close
of the inscription, had become obliterated by more than a century's
rough usage, is deprived of the honour of holding any post whatever.
Even this rendering of the inscription is however, highly
interesting, as giving some indication of the degree of obliteration
effected by the weather in this long space of time.</p>

<p>In 1617 appeared a work, the title of which renders some mention
of it in this place necessary. It was entitled <i>Mundus alter et
idem, sive Terra Australis antehac semper incognite longis itineribus
peregrini academici nuperrime lustrata</i>. Hanau, 1617. The book
bearing this delusive title was by Bishop Joseph Hall. It was in
reality an invective against the characteristic vices of various
nations, from which it is said that Swift borrowed the idea of
<i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.</p>

<p>A strange blunder has been made by the Abbe Prevost, tom. ii, p.
201, of his <i>Histoire des Voyages</i>, 4to. ed., and by the
President de Brosses, in his</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxv}</u></p>

<p><i>Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes</i> tom. i, p.
432; and copied by Callender in his unacknowledged translation from
De Brosses, to the effect that in the year 1618, one Zeachen, a
native of Arnheim, discovered the land called Arnheim's Land, and Van
Diemen's Land on the N. coast of Australia in about latitude 14&deg;.
He proceeds to say that Dieman's Land owes its name to Anthony Van
Diemen, at that time General of the Dutch East India Company, who
returned to Europe with vast riches in 1631. The blunder is easily
demonstrable. Zeachen, or as it is also given, Zechaen, is a form of
word plainly irreconcileable with the genius of the Dutch language,
and is an evident misspelling, of Zeehaen, which is the name not of a
man, but of a ship, the <i>Sea-hen</i>.</p>

<p>No such voyage is mentioned in the recital of discoveries which
preface the instructions to Tasman, nor is there any notice of the
north coast of new Holland having been visited by the Dutch in that
year. Moreover Van Diemen, as we learn from the <i>Vies des
Gouverneurs Generaux avec l'abrege de l'histoire des etablissemens
Hollandois</i> by Dubois, was not governor general until January 1st,
1636, and it is observable that on one of the ships employed in
Tasman's voyage in 1642, in which he discovered the island now known
as Tasmania, but to which he, out of compliment, gave the name of the
governor general, Van Diemen, was called the "Zeehaen" from which in
all probability, by some complication of mistakes, the mis-statement
here made has originated.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxvi}</u></p>

<p>The <i>Mauritius</i>, an outward bound ship, appears to have made
some discoveries upon the west coasts, in July, 1618, particularly of
Willem's River, near the north-west cape, but no further particulars
are known.</p>

<p>It would seem that another of the outward bound ships referred to
in the Dutch recital, as visiting the coast of New Holland, was
commanded by Edel, and the land there discovered, which was on the
west coast, was named the land of Edel. From Campbell's editions of
Harris's voyages we learn that this discovery was made in 1619. It
appears from Thevenot's chart, published in 1663, to have extended
from about 29&deg; northward to 26&frac12;, where the land of
Eendragt commences, but in Van Keulen's chart, published near the
close of the century, it is made to extend still more southward, to
32&deg; 20' which Trevenot's chart would attribute rather to the
discovery made three years later (1622) of the ship <i>Leeuwin</i>
(the Lioness).</p>

<p>The great reef lying off the coast of Edel's Land, called
Houtman's Abrolhos, was discovered at the same time. The name was
doubtless given after the Dutch navigator Frederick Houtman, although
we find no trace of his having himself visited this coast. The
Portuguese name Abrolhos, meaning "open your eyes", was given to
dangerous reefs, implying the necessity of a sharp look out.</p>

<p>The name of the commander of the <i>Leeuwin</i> has not yet
appeared in any published document that has met the editor's eye. The
land to which the name of that vessel was given extended from 35&deg;
northward,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxvii}</u></p>

<p>to about 31&deg;; but as we have already stated, in Van Keulen's
and later charts, the northern portion of this tract has been
included in the discovery by Edel.</p>

<p>For the nearer discovery of Eendraght's Land, the Dutch recital
informs us that the governor general, Jan Pietersz Coen, dispatched
in September, 1622, the yachts De Haring and Harewind; but this
voyage was rendered abortive by meeting the ship <i>Mauritius</i>,
and searching after the ship <i>Rotterdam</i>.</p>

<p>In January 1623, the Dutch recital informs us, the yachts
<i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i>, under the command of Jan Carstens,
were despatched from Amboina by order of his Excellency Jan Pietetz
Coen. Carstens, with eight of the <i>Arnhem's</i> crew, was
treacherously murdered by the natives of New Guinea; but the vessels
prosecuted the voyage and discovered "the great islands, Arnhem and
Spult". Arnhem's Land forms the easternmost portion of the north
coast of New Holland, lying to the west of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
In a chart inserted in Valentyn's <i>Beschryvingh van Banda</i>, fo.
36, is laid down the river Spult in Arnhem's Land, in about the
position of Liverpool River, with which, in all probability, it is
identical; and the country in this vicinity is probably what is here
meant by the Spult.</p>

<p>The ships were then "untimely separated", and the Arnhem returned
to Amboina. The <i>Pera</i> persisted, and "sailed along the south
coast of New Guinea to a flat cove situate in 10&deg; south latitude,
and ran along the west coast of this land to Cape Keer Weer; from</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxviii}</u></p>

<p>thence discovered the coast further southwards, as far as 17&deg;,
to Staten River. From this place, what more of the land could be
discerned seemed to stretch westward." The <i>Pera</i> then returned
to Amboina. "In this discovery were found everywhere shallow water
and barren coasts; islands altogether thinly peopled by divers cruel,
poor, and brutal nations, and of very little use to the Dutch East
India Company."</p>

<p>The first discovery of the south coast of New Holland was made in
1627. The Dutch recital says: "In the year 1627, the south coast of
the great south land vas accidently discovered by the ship the
<i>Guide Zeepaard</i>, outward bound from Fatherland, for the space
of a thousand miles." The journal of this voyage seems to have been
lost. The editor has spared no pains, by inquiry in Holland and
Belgium, to trace its existence, but without success; and the only
testimony that we have to the voyage is derived from the above
passage and Dutch charts, which give the name Pieter Nuyts to the
immense tract of country thus discovered. Nuyts is generally supposed
to have commanded the ship; but Flinders judiciously remarks that, on
his arrival at Batavia, he was sent ambassador to Japan, and
afterwards made governor of Formosa. It seems more probable that he
was a civilian--perhaps the company's first merchant on board--rather
than captain of the ship. In estimating the <i>thousand miles</i>
described in the recital, allowance must be doubtless made for
irregularities of the coast, embracing from Cape Leeuwin to St.
Francis and St. Peter's Islands.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: lxxxix}</u></p>

<p>The next discovery upon the western coasts was that of the ship
<i>Vianen</i>, one of the seven which returned to Europe under the
command of the Governor General, Carpenter. In this year, the Dutch
recital informs us that the coast was seen again accidentally, in the
year 1628, on the north side, in the latitude 21&deg; south by the
ship <i>Vianen</i>, homeward bound from India, when they coasted two
hundred miles without gaining any knowledge of this great country;
only observing "a foul and barren shore, green fields, and very wild,
black, barbarous inhabitants."</p>

<p>This was the part called De Witt's Land; but whether the name were
applied by the captain of the <i>Vianen</i> does not appear. The
President De Brosses, whose account, however, is too full of blunders
to follow very implicitly, says, "William de Witt gave his own name
to the country which he saw in 1628 to the north of Remessen's River;
and which Viane, a Dutch captain, had, to his misfortune, discovered
in the month of January in the same year, when he was driven upon
this coast of De Witt, in 21&deg; of latitude, and lost all his
riches". The name of De Witt was subsequently retained on this part
of the coast in all the maps.</p>

<p>In Thevenot's <i>Recueil de divers Voyages curieux</i>, 1663, is
given an account, translated from the Dutch, of the shipwreck of the
<i>Batavia</i>, Captain Francis Pelsart, in the night of June 4,
1629, on the reef still known as Houtman's Abrolhos, lying between
28&deg; and 29&deg; S. lat., on the west coast of Australia. A loose
and incorrect translation of this account, is</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xc}</u></p>

given in vol. i, p. 323, of Harris's <i>Navigantium atque
Intinerantium Bibliotheca</i> (Campbell's edition), but a new
translation is supplied, in its proper chronological order, in the
present volume. At daylight, the shipwrecked sailors saw an island at
about three leagues distance, and still nearer, two islets, to which
the passengers with some of the crew were sent. As no fresh water was
found on these islets, Pelsart put to sea on the 8th of June, in one
of the boats which he had had covered with a deck, and sailed to the
main land for the purpose of seeking water. He found his latitude at
noon to be 28&deg; 13' south. The coast, which bore N. by W., he
estimated to be eight leagues from the place of shipwreck. It was
rocky and barren and about the same height of the coast of Dover. He
essayed to put in at a small sandy bay, but the surf and the
unfavourableness of the weather compelled him to keep off the shore.
He then steered north, but the abruptness of the shore, and the
breakers which e found along the coast, prevented his landing for
several days, till at length on the 14th of June, being then in
24&deg; latitude, he saw some smokes at a distance, and steered
towards them, but the shore was still found to be steep and rocky,
and the sea broke high against it; at length six of his men leaped
overboard, and with great exertion reached the land, the boat
remaining at anchor in twenty-five fathoms. The sailors, while busily
engaged in seeking water, perceived four natives creeping towards
them on their hands and feet; but suddenly, on one of the sailors
appearing on an eminence, they rose up and

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xci}</u></p>

<p>fled, so that those who remained in the boat could see them
distinctly. They were wild, black, and entirely naked.</p>

<p>The search for water was unsuccessful, and the sailors swam back
to the boat, though much bruised by the waves and rocks. They then
again set sail, keeping outside the shoals. On the morning of the
15th, they discovered a cape, off which lay a chain of rocks,
stretching out four miles into the sea, and beyond this, another
reef, close to the shore. Finding here an opening where the water was
smooth, they put into it, but with great risk, as they had but two
feet of water with a stony bottom. Here in the holes of the rocks
they found fresh rain water, of which they collected forty gallons.
There were evident traces of the natives having been there but a
short time before. On the 16th of July, they endeavoured to collect
more water but without success. There were no signs of vegetation on
the sandy level country to be seen beyond, and the ant hills were so
large, that they might have been taken for the horses of the natives.
The quantity of flies was so great, that they could with difficulty
free themselves from them. Eight savages carryng sticks or spears in
their hands, came within musket shot, but fled when the Dutch sailors
moved towards them. When Captain Pelsart found there was no hope of
procuring water he again weighed anchor end got outside of the reef
by a second opening more to the north; for having observed the
latitude to be 22&deg; 17', his intention was to seek for the river
of Jacob Remessens near the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcii}</u></p>

<p>north-west cape, but the wind changing to the north-east, he was
compelled to quit the coast. Being now four hundred miles from the
place of shipwreck, and having barely enough water for their own use,
he determined to make the best of his way back to Batavia for
assistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by a fortunate accident, one of them who had been left
at the Abrolhos chanced to taste the water on two holes, which water
had been supposed to be salt, as it rose and fell with the tide. To
their inexpressible joy it proved to be fit to drink, and afforded
them an unfailing supply. Captain Pelsart afterwards returned to the
Abrolhos in the yacht "Saardam", from Batavia; but finding a shameful
conspiracy on foot, he was compelled to execute some, and two men
were set on shore on the opposite main land. In the instructions
subsequently given to Tasman for his voyage in 1644, he was directed
"to inquire at the continent thereabouts after two Dutch men, who,
having forfeited their lives, were put on shore by Commodore Pelsart,
if still alive. In such case, you may make your enquiries of them
about the situation of those countries; and if they entreat you to
that purpose, give them passage hither."</p>

<p>Gerrit Tomaz Pool, or Poel, was sent in April this year from
Banda, with the yachts <i>Klyn</i>, <i>Amsterdam</i> and <i>Wezel</i>
upon the same expedition as Carstens; and at the same place on the
coast of New Guinea he met with the same fate. Nevertheless, the
voyage was assiduously continued under the charge</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xciii}</u></p>

<p>of the super cargo, Pieterz Pietersen; and the islands Key and
Arouw visited. By reason of very strong eastwardly winds, they could
not reach the west coast of New Guinea (Carpentaria); but shaping
their course very near south discovered the coast of Arnhem or Van
Diemen's Land in 11&deg; south latitude; so named after the governor
general Van Diemen, who was sent out this year, and sailed along the
shore for one hundred and twenty miles (thirty mijlen), without
seeing any people, but many signs of smoke.</p>

<p>A short account of this voyage is given by Valentyn, in his volume
on <i>Banda</i>, p. 47, a translation of which will be found in the
present volume.</p>

<p>Abel Janszen Tasman, who, in the year 1642, had made the two great
discoveries of south Van Diemen's Land--in these days more correctly
named after himself, Tasmania--and of New Zealand, was again sent out
in 1644, for the express purpose of examining the north and
north-western shores of New Holland. His instructions, of which we
have already repeatedly spoken, say, that "after quitting Point Ture,
or False Cape, situate in 8&deg; on the south coast of New Guinea,
you are to continue eastward along the coast to 9&deg; south
latitude, crossing prudently the cover at that place. Looking about
the <i>high islands or Speults River</i>, with yachts for a harbour,
despatching the tender <i>De Braak</i> for two or three days into the
cove, in order to discover whether, within the great inlet, there be
not to be found an entrance into the South Sea.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xciv}</u></p>

<p>From this place you are to coast along the west coast of New
Guinea, to the furthest discoveries in 17&deg; south latitude,
following the coast further, as it may run west or southward. But it
is to be feared you will meet in these parts with the south-east
trade winds, from which it will be difficult to keep the coast on
board, if stretching to the south-east; but, notwithstanding this,
endeavour, by all means to proceed, that we may be sure whether this
land is divided from the great unknown south continent or not." Thus
it became part of Tasman's duty to explore Torres' Straits, then
unknown, though possibly suspected to exist. That they had been
unconsciously passed through by Torres, in 1606 we have already seen.
Tasman, however, failed, as will be presently shown, in making the
desired exploration, and it was not until 1770 that the separation of
New Holland from New Guinea was established by Captain Cook. In the
remaining portion of his duty, Tasman fully succeeded, viz., in
establishing the continuity of the north-west coast of the land
designated generally "the great known south continent", as far south
as about the twenty-second degree. It is greatly to be regretted that
the account of this interesting voyage has not been published. The
Burgomaster Witsen, in a work on the migrations of the human race,
which appeared in 1705, gives some notes on the inhabitants of New
Guinea and New Holland, in which Tasman is quoted among those from
whom he gained his information; thus showing that Tasman's narrative
was then in existence. M. Van Wyk</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcv}</u></p>

<p>Roelandszoon, in a letter addressed to the editor of the
<i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>, dated 26th July, 1825, states
that many <i>savans du premier ordre</i> had for a long time sought
in vain for the original papers of Abel Tasman. One young, but very
able fellow countryman of his, had even made a voyage for that
express purpose to Batavia, in the hope that they might be found
there, but he unfortunately died shortly after his arrival at that
place. M. Van Wyk continues, "we still live in the hope of receiving
some of these documents." This hope, however, was not realised, and
the efforts of the editor of the present volume, which have been
exerted in influential quarters for the same object, have been
equally unsuccessful. But, although we have to regret the loss or
non-appearance of any detailed account of this most important voyage,
the <i>outline</i> of the coasts visited by Tasman is laid down,
though without any reference to him or his voyage, on several maps
which appeared within a few years after the voyage was performed. The
earliest representation which the editor has found anywhere
mentioned, although in all probability it was preceded by others
published in Holland, was on the mappemonde of Louis Mayerne Turquet,
published in Paris in 1648. It was also represented on a planisphere,
inlaid in the floor of the Groote Zaal, in the Stad-huys at
Amsterdam, a building commenced in 1648. The site adopted for this
remarkable map was peculiar, and scarcely judicious; for though it
gratified the eyes of the enterprising burghers, with the picture of
the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcvi}</u></p>

<p>successful explorations of their countrymen, it exposed the
representation itself to almost unceasing detrition from the soles of
their feet. This outline was also given in the map entitled Mar di
India, in the 1650 edition of Janssen's Atlas in the King's Library
in the British Museum, by J. Klencke, of Amsterdam, presented to King
Charles the Second, on his restoration in 1660, and also in a chart
inserted in Melchisedech Thevenot's <i>Relation de divers voyages
curieux</i>, 1663. From these maps it is apparent that it was from
this voyage that the designation of New Holland was first given to
this great country. In a map by Van Keulen, published at the close of
the seventeenth century, <i>a portion</i> of Tasman's track with the
soundings is given, but this also is without reference to Tasman
himself. It has, however, been the good fortune of the editor of the
present volume to light upon a document which, in the absence of
Tasman's narrative, and his own original chart, viz., an early copy,
perhaps from his own chart, with the tracks of his two voyages
pricked thereon, and the entire soundings of the voyage of 1644 laid
down. It forms Art. 12 in a miscellaneous MS. collection marked 5222
in the department of MSS. in the British Museum. It bears no name or
date, but is written on exactly the same kind of paper, with the same
ink, and by the same hand, as one by Captain Thomas Bowrey, in the
same volume, done at Fort St. George in 1687. It is observable, that
in the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcvii}</u></p>

<p>preface to a work by Captain Bowrey, on the Malay language, he
says, that in 1688, he embarked at Fort St. George, as a passenger
for England, having been nineteen years in the East Indies,
continually engaged in navigation and trading in those countries, in
Sumatra, Borneo, Bantam and Java. The two-fold blunder, both as to
fact and date, contained in the sentence inserted in the middle of
the chart, "This large land of New Guinea was first discovered <i>to
joyne to ye south land</i> by ye Yot Lemmen as by this chart Francois
Jacobus Vis. Pilot Major Anno 1643" is self-evidently an independent
subsequent insertion, probably by Bowrey himself, and therefore by no
means impugns the inference that the chart is otherwise a genuine
copy. The soundings verify the track, and show that Tasman regarded
the first point of his instructions as to the exploration of the
"great inlet", either as of less importance or of greater danger than
the subsequent portion, as to establishing the continuity of the
lands on the north and north-west coasts of "the great known southern
continent."</p>

<p>This large land of New Guinea was first discovered to joyne to ye

Pilot Major Anno 1643</p>
</center>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the map of Klencke, already referred
to, leaves the passage towards Torres Strait open, while in the map
here given it is closed. The missing narrative of Tasman alone could
explain this discrepancy, or show us the amount of authenticity to be
ascribed to either of these maps; but it appears to the editor, that
the track laid down with the soundings, gives to the map here given
the claim to preference, while the very depth of the imaginary</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcviii}</u></p>

<p>bight here drawn, instead of the strait, throws it out of the line
of exploration in the voyage whose track is described. From the notes
of the Burgomaster Witsen (1705), we derive the only fragment of an
account of this most important voyage. From thence we gain the
earliest information respecting the inhabitants. The translation is
given by Dalrymple in his volume on <i>Papua</i>. It is as follows:
"In latitude 13&deg;, 8' south, Longitude 146&deg;, 18' (probably
about 129&frac12;&deg; east of Greenwich), the coast is barren. The
people are bad and wicked, shooting at the Dutch with arrows, without
provocation, when they were coming on shore. It is here very
populous."</p>

<p>"In 14&deg;, 58' south, longitude 138&deg;, 59' (about 125&deg;
east) the people are savage, and go naked: none can understand them.
In 16&deg;, 10' south, the people swam on board of a Dutch ship, and
when they received a present of a piece of linen, they laid it upon
their head in token of gratitude. Everywhere thereabouts all the
people are malicious. They use arrows and bows, of such length that
one end rests on the ground when shooting. They have also hazegayes
and kalawayes, and attacked the Dutch, but did not know the execution
of the guns.</p>

<p>"In Hollandia Nova (a term which seems to imply that the
previously named places were not supposed by Witsen to be included
under the name of New Holland) in 17&deg;, 12' south, (longitude
121&deg; or 122&deg; east), Tasman found</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: xcix}</u></p>

<p>naked black people, with curly hair: malicious and cruel, using
for arms bows and arrows, hazegayes and kalawayes. They once came to
the number of fifty, double armed, dividing themselves into two
parties intending to have surprised the Dutch, who had landed
twenty-five men; but the firing of the guns frightened them so much
that they took to flight. Their canoes are made of the bark of trees:
their coast is dangerous: there is but little vegetation: the people
have no houses.</p>

<p>"In 19&deg;, 35' S., longitude 134&deg; (about 120&deg;
apparently), the inhabitants are very numerous, and threw stones at
the boats sent by the Dutch to the shore. They made fire and smoke
all along the coast, which it was conjectured they did to give notice
to their neighbours of strangers being upon the coast. They appear to
live very poorly; go naked; eat yams and other roots."</p>

<p>This fragment of description is meagre enough; but it is all that
we can boast of possessing. It is further remarkable that those who
have spoken of the part of the coast visited by Tasman in this
voyage, have led their readers into misconception by attributing the
discovery of the Gulf of Carpentaria to Carpenter, and of the
northern Van Diemen's Land to the governor of that name. So soon
after the voyage as the year 1663, we find Trevenot printing as
follows: "We shall, in due course, give the voyages of Carpenter and
Diemen, to whom is due the principal honour of this discovery. Van
Diemen brought back gold, porcelain, and a thousand other articles
of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: c}</u></p>

<p>wealth; which at first gave rise to the notion that the country
produced all these things; though it has been since ascertained that
what he brought was recovered from the vessel which had been wrecked
on these coasts. The mystery which the Dutch make of the matter, and
the difficulties thrown in the way of publishing what is known about
it, suggest the idea that the country is rich. But why should they
show such jealousy in respect to a country which produces nothing
deserving so distant a journey?" La Neuville also, in his <i>Histoire
de Hollande</i> (Paris, 1703 p. 213), speaking, of Van Diemen, says:
"This latter not only examined the coasts of this great land, but had
two years previously sailed as far as 43&deg; towards the antarctic
pole, and discovered, on the 24th of November 1642, a new country in
the other continent, which now bears the name of Van Diemen's Land."
Here the very details clearly expose the nature of the mistake, since
the maps and the instructions to Tasman show his second voyage to
have been in 1644, and the discovery of Van Diemen's Land in 1642 is
known to be his beyond all dispute. The fact is moreover confirmed by
the identity of the names given to the tracts discovered in these two
voyages, viz, those of the principal members of the council and of
Marie van Diemen, to whom Tasman is supposed to have been
attached.</p>

<p>Prevost, in his <i>Histoire des Voyages</i>, (Paris, 1753, tom.
ii, p. 201), says that Carpentaria was discovered by Carpenter in
1662. We then find De Brosses correcting this statement (p. 433), by
saying, "the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: ci}</u></p>

<p>Abbe Prevost ought not to have stated that, in 1662, Carpentaria
was discovered by Pieter Carpenter, since he was Governor-General of
the Company of the Indies, and returned to Europe in June 1628 with
five vessels richly laden". He then quotes the above passage from
Thevenot, and continues: "Unfortunately Thevenot has not fulfilled
his promise respecting Carpentaria. That learned collector was
engaged in preparing, at the time of his decease, a fifth volume of
his collection, of which some incomplete portions of what he had
already published were found in his cabinet. From amongst these I
have extracted the journal of Captain Tasman, who discovered Van
Diemen's Land. There was, however, nothing respecting the voyage of
Captain Carpenter, nor that of the Governor-General, Van Diemen, even
if he had left one: at least, if the manuscripts of these voyages
were there originally, it is not known what has become of them." De
Brosses concludes by saying that his researches in private
collections and in printed geographical works had been unsuccessful
in procuring further information on the subject. Subsequent
geographers continued to attribute to Carpenter the discovery of
Carpentaria, and many of them to Van Diemen the discovery of the
north Van Diemen's Land. In Dubois' work, <i>Vies des Gouverneurs
Generaux</i>, already quoted, which was compiled in Holland from the
manuscript journals and registers from Batavia, he says expressly, p.
82, in speaking of Carpenter, who was governor between 1623 and 1627,
"Some writers attribute to him personally the honour</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cii}</u></p>

<p>of the discovery of Carpentaria, the southern land lying between
New Guinea and New Holland; but this is without any apparent
foundation, inasmuch as they fix this discovery in the year 1628, in
which year he returned to Holland, on the 12th of June, with five
vessels richly laden, having sailed from Batavia on the 12th of
November of the previous year." It should, moreover, be observed,
that no evidence has been adduced of his having been on the coast at
all, while there is every reason to believe that the exploration of
the Gulf of Carpentaria was not only "acheve", as M. Eyries suggests
(p. 12, art. 1, vol. ii, of <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>), by
Tasman in 1644 but accomplished by that navigator for the first time.
It might then be asked how comes it that Tasman, who had in both his
voyages so largely complimented the governor Van Diemen, by giving
his name and that of his daughter Maria, to whom he was attached, to
various points of his discovery, should finally give the name of
Carpenter to an important gulf and tract of country, when the
governor bearing that name had left Batavia sixteen years before? The
answer is readily given. The Governor and Company of Batavia formed a
local administration under the presidency of the Company of the
Indies of Amsterdam, which latter consisted of seventeen delegates
from the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands. In the year 1623, in
which Carpenter commenced his governorship in the east, an event
occurred in Amboina which threatened to produce a war between Holland
and England. Some English</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: ciii}</u></p>

<p>officials, in concert with some Japanese soldiers, had formed a
conspiracy to kill the Dutch in the island and to gain possession of
the fortress. The conspiracy was discovered, and the governor had the
conspiritors put to death. In England the governor's conduct was
regarded as a piece of heartless cruelty. Mutual recriminations
ensued, and for several years a contest between the two countries was
imminent. After Carpenter's return to Holland in 1628, he was sent
out as one of a deputation to London on this subject, despatched in
the year 1629. He was also appointed president of the Company of the
Indies in Amsterdam, which post he occupied till his death in 1659.
It need, therefore, no longer be subject of surprise that Tasman
should have given the name of Carpenter, the president of the Home
Company of the Indies, to an extensive country and gulf discovered by
him in 1644.</p>

<p>We cannot dismiss our notice of this important voyage, which thus
gave the name of New Holland to the great South Land, without quoting
the remark of Thevenot in the <i>Relation de l'estat present des
Indes</i>, prefixed to the second volume of his <i>Relation de Divers
Voyages Curieux</i>. He says: "The Dutch pretend to have a right to
the southern land which they have discovered...They maintain that the
coasts were never known by the Portuguese or the other nations of
Europe. It is to be noticed that all this extent of country falls
within the line of demarcation of the Dutch <i>East</i> India
Company, if we are to believe their maps, and that</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: civ}</u></p>

<p>this motive of interest has perhaps made them give a false
position to New Zealand, lest it should fall within the line of
demarcation of the Dutch <i>West</i> India Company: for these two
companies are as jealous of each other, as they are of other nations
of Europe. It is to be observed, that although the Portuguese possess
many places in the Indies, they are extremely weak by reason that
their enemies are masters of the seas, and of the traffic which they
themselves formerly possessed."</p>

<p>The observation would seem to imply that Thevenot, a Frenchman,
was not wanting in the belief that these coasts had really been
discovered by the Portuguese before they were visited by the Dutch
while it passes by in silence any thought of a claim thereto on the
part of his own countrymen, a point worth noticing in connexion with
the evidence of the early French manuscript maps of which we have
already so fully treated.</p>

<p>From the voyage of Tasman to the close of the seventeenth century,
it is probable that a considerable number of voyages were made to the
west coasts of New Holland, of which no account has ever been
printed. By the obliging, intelligent assistance of Mr. Frederick
Muller, of Amsterdam, (a rare example of a bookseller who interests
himself not only in obtaining curious early books illustrative of the
history of his country, but in minutely studying that history
himself), the editor has been enabled to procure some printed
documents from the Hague which have never before been printed, and
one which, although</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cv}</u></p>

<p>in print, has become exceedingly scarce, and has never before been
rendered into English.</p>

<p>The earliest of these is an account of the ship <i>De Vergulde
Draeck</i>, on the Southland, and the expedition undertaken both from
Batavia and the Cape of Good Hope in search of survivors, etc., drawn
up and translated from authentic MS. copies of logbooks in the Royal
Archives at the Hague. <i>De Vergulde Draeck</i>, which set sail from
the Texel in October 1655, was wrecked on a reef on the west coast,
in latitude 30&deg; 40', and a hundred and eighteen souls were lost.
The news was brought to Batavia by one of the ship's boats,
sixty-eight of the survivors having remained behind, exerting
themselves to get their boat afloat again, that they might send some
more of their number to Batavia. The Governor General immediately
dispatched the flyboat the <i>Witte Vaclk</i>, and the yacht <i>Goede
Hoop</i>, to the assistance of those men, and also to help in the
rescue of the specie and merchandise lost in the <i>Vergulde
Draeck</i>. This expedition was attended with bad success, as they
reached the coast in the winter time. Similar ill luck attended the
flyboat <i>Vinck</i>, which was directed to touch at New Holland, in
its voyage from the Cape to Batavia in 1657, to search for the
unfortunate men who had been left behind. The company next dispatched
from Batavia two galliots, the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>, and the
<i>Emeloort</i>, on the 1st of January, 1658. These vessels also
returned to Batavia in April of the same year, having each of them
separated, after parting company by the way,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cvi}</u></p>

<p>sailed backwards and fowards again and again and landed parties at
several points along the coast. They had also continually fired
signal guns night and day, without, however, discovering either any
Dutchmen, or the wreck of the vessel. The only things seen were some
few planks and blocks, with a piece of the mast, a taffrail,
fragments of barrels and other objects scattered here and there along
the coast, and supposed to be remnants of the wreck. This account
with a description of the west coast of the South Land by Captain
Samuel Volkersen, of the Pink <i>Waeckende Boey</i>is accompanied by
copies of original charts, showing the coast visited by this vessel
and the <i>Emeloort</i>, never before printed. These documents are
followed by an extract from the Burgomaster Witsen's <i>Noord en Oost
Tartarye</i>, descriptive of the west coast, a portion of which is
plainly derived from the account of Abraham Leeman, the mate of the
<i>Waeckende Boey</i>.</p>

<p>We must not here omit to mention, that in the year 1693, appeared
a work bearing the following title: "Les Adventures de Jaques Sadeur
dans la decouverte et le voyage de la Terre Australe contenant les
coutumes et les moeurs des Australiens, leur religions, leurs
exercises, leurs etudes, leurs guerres, leurs animaux, particuliers a
ce pays et toutes les raretez curieuses qui s'y trouvent. A Paris,
chez Claude Barbin, au Palais, sur le second perron de la Sainte
Chapelle, 1693." In the Vannes edition, p. 3, the author's Christian
name is given as Nicolas. An English translation appeared in the same
year,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cvii}</u></p>

<p>entitled "A new discovery of Terra Incognita Australis, or the
Southern World, by James Sadeur, a Frenchman, who being cast there by
shipwreck, lived thirty-five years in that country, and gives a
particular description of the manners, customs, religion, laws,
studies and wars of those southern people, and of some animals
peculiar to that place, with several other rarities. These memoirs
were thought so curious, that they were kept secret in the closet of
a great minister of state, and never published till now, since his
death. Translated from the French copy printed at Paris by publick
authority, April 8. Imprimatur, Charles Hern, London: Printed for
John Dunton, at the Raven, in the Poulty, 1693." The work is purely
fictitious throughout.</p>

<p>The next Dutch voyage of which we have succeeded in finding an
account, is that of William de Vlamingh, in 1696, which also owed its
origin to the loss of a ship, the <i>Ridderschap van Hollandt</i>.
This vessel had been-missing from the time she had left the Cape of
Good Hope in 1684 or 1685, and it was thought that probably she might
have been wrecked upon the great South Land, and that some of the
crew might, even after this lapse of time, be still living. The
commodore, Willem de Vlaming, who was going out to India with the
<i>Geelvink</i>, <i>Nyptang</i> and <i>Wezel</i>, was, therefore,
ordered to make a search for them. The account of this voyage, which
was printed at Amsterdam in 1701, 4to, is exceedingly scarce; and
after many years enquiry, the editor</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cviii}</u></p>

<p>deemed himself fortunate in procuring through the medium of Mr.
Muller, of Amsterdam, a copy of it, and a translation is here given.
The search of De Vlaming was, however, fruitless, and the two
principal points of interest were the finding of the plate already
described, with the inscription commemorating the arrival and
departure of Dirk Hartog, in 1616, and the discovery of the Swan
River, where the embodiment of the poet's notion of a <i>rara avis in
terris</i> was for the first time encountered, and two of the black
swans were taken alive to Batavia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the shores of New Holland had been visited by a
countryman of our own, the celebrated Dampier. In the buccaneering
expedition in which he made a voyage round the world, he came upon
the north-west coast in 16&deg; 50' due south from a shoal, whose
longitude is now known to be 122&frac14;&deg; east. Running along the
shore N.E. by E. twelve leagues to a bay or opening convenient for
landing, a party was sent ashore to search for water, and surprised
some of the natives, some of whom they tried to induce to help in
filling the water casks, and conveying them to the boat. "But all the
signs we could make", says Dampier, "were to no purpose; for they
stood like statues, staring at one another, and grinning like so many
monkeys. These poor creatures seem not accustomed to carry burdens;
and I believe one of our ship's boys, of ten years old, would carry
as much as one of their men." In his description of the natives, he
agrees with Tasman in their being a "naked black people, with</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cix}</u></p>

<p>curly hair, like that of the negroes in Guinea"; but he mentions
other circumstances which are not mentioned in the note from Tasman.
He describes them as "the most miserable people in the world. The
Hottentots compared with them are gentlemen. They have no houses,
animals, poultry their persons are tall, straight bodied, thin, with
long limbs; they have great heads, round foreheads, and great brows;
their eyelids are always half-closed, to keep the flies out of their
eyes, for they are so troublesome here, that no fanning will keep
them from one's face; so that, from infancy, they never open their
eyes as other people do, and therefore they cannot see far, unless
they hold up their heads as if they were looking at something over
them. They have great bottle noses, full lips, wide mouths; the two
foreteeth of the upper jaw are wanting in all of them; neither have
they any beard. Their hair is short, black and curled, and their
skins coal black, like that of the negroes in Guinea. Their only food
is fish, and they consequently search for them at low water; and they
make little weirs or dams with stones across little coves of the sea.
At one time, our boat being among the islands seeking game, espied a
drove of these people swimming from one island to another, for they
have neither boats, canoes or bark logs." Dampier remained there from
January 5 to March 12, 1688, but is silent as to any dangers upon the
twelve leagues of coast seen by him.</p>

<p>In the year 1699, Great Britain being at peace</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cx}</u></p>

<p>with the other maritime states of Europe, King William ordered an
expedition for the discovery of new countries, and for the
examination of some of those already discovered, particularly New
Holland and New Guinea. Dampier's graphic narrative of his
buccaneering voyages caused the Earl of Pembroke to select him to
conduct the expedition. The <i>Roebuck</i>, a ship belonging to the
royal navy, was equipped for the purpose. After a voyage of six
months, Dampier struck soundings in the night of August 1st, 1699,
upon the northern part of the Abrolhos shoal, in latitude about
27&deg;, 40' S. Next morning he saw the main coast, and ran northward
along it, discovering in 26&deg;, 10', an opening two leagues wide
but full of rocks and foul ground. August 6th, he anchored in Dirk
Hartog's Road, at the entrance of a sound which he named Shark's Bay;
where he remained eight days examining the sound, cutting wood upon
the islands, fishing, etc., and gives a description of what was seen
in his usual circumstantial manner. His description of the kangaroo,
probably the first ever given of that singular animal, is a curious
one. "The land animals we saw here were only a sort of raccoons, but
different from those of the West Indies, chiefly as to their legs;
for they have very short forelegs, but go jumping; and like the
raccoons are very good meat."</p>

<p>Sailing northward along the coast, he found an archipelago
extending twenty leagues in length, which has been more recently
examined by</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxi}</u></p>

<p>Captain King, He anchored in lat. 20&deg;, 21', under one of the
largest of the islands, which he named Rosemary Island. This was near
the southern part of De Witt's Land but besides an error in latitude
of 40', he complains that in Tasman's charts "the shore is laid down
as all along joining in one body or continent, with some openings
like rivers, and not like islands, as really they are."</p>

<p>"By what we saw of them, they must have been a range of islands,
of about twenty leagues in length, stretching from E.N.E. to W.S.W.,
and, for aught I know, as far as to those of Shark's Bay; and to a
considerable breadth also, for we could see nine, or ten leagues in
amongst them, towards the continent or main land of New Holland,
<i>if there be any such thing hereabouts</i>: and by the great tides
I met with awhile afterwards more to the north-east, I had a strong
suspicion that there might be a kind of archipelago of islands; and a
passage, possibly, to the south of New Holland and New Guinea, into
the great South Sea eastward."</p>

<p>Not finding fresh water upon such of the islands as were visited
that day, Captain Dampier quitted his anchorage next morning, and
steered away E.N.E., coasting along as the land lies. He seems to
have kept the land in sight, in the daytime, at the distance of four
to six leagues; but the shore being low, this was too far for him to
be certain whether all was main land which he saw; and what might
have passed in the night was still more doubtful.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxii}</u></p>

<p>August 30th, being in latitude 18&deg;, 21', and the weather fair,
Captain Dampier steered in for the shore; and anchored in eight
fathoms, about three-and-a-half leagues off. "The tide ran very swift
here; so that our nun-buoy would not bear above the water to be seen.
It flows here, as on that part of New Holland I described formerly,
about five fathoms."</p>

<p>He had hitherto seen no inhabitants; but now met with several. The
place at which he had touched in the former voyage was not above
forty or fifty leagues to the north-east of this. "And these were
much the same blinking creatures (here being also abundance of flesh
flies teizing them), and with the same black skins, and hair
frizzled, tall and thin, etc., as those were. But we had not the
opportunity to see whether these, as the former, wanted two of their
fore teeth. One of them who was supposed to be a chief was painted
with a circle of white paste or pigment about his eyes, and a white
streak down his nose, from his forehead to the tip of it. And his
breat, and some part of his arms, were also made white with the same
paint."</p>

<p>Neither bows nor arrows were observed amongst these people: they
used wooden lances, such as Dampier had before seen. He saw no houses
at either place, and believed they had none; but there were several
things like haycocks, standing in the savanah; which "at a distance,
we thought were houses, looking like the Hottentots houses at the
Cape</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxiii}</u></p>

<p>of Good Hope; but we found them to be so many rocks." These rocks
he could not have examined very closely; for there can be little
doubt that they were the ant hills described by Pelsart as being so
large, that they might have been taken for the houses of
Indians.'</p>

<p>The land near the coast is described as equally sandy with the
parts before visited, and producing, amongst its scanty vegetation
nothing for food. No stream of fresh water was seen, nor could any
fit to drink be procured by digging.</p>

<p>Quitting this inhospitable shore, Captain Dampier weighed his
anchor on September 5th, with the intention of seeking water and
refreshments further on to the north-eastward. The shoals obliged him
to keep a considerable distance, from the land, and finally, when
arrived at the latitude of 16&deg;, 9', to give up this project, and
direct his course for Timor.</p>

<p>With the voyage of Dampier terminates the information gained of
the western coasts previously to the present century, which does not
lie within the range of our inquiries.</p>

<p>In 1705 another and last voyage was made by the Dutch for the
discovery of the north coast. The expedition consisted of three
vessels, the <i>Vossenbosch</i>, the <i>Waayer</i> and the <i>Nova
Hollandia</i>. The commander was Martin van Delft. The journals
appear to have been lost. At all events they have not hitherto been
found, but a report to the Governor-General and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxiv}</u></p>

<p>Council of the discoveries and notable occurrences in the
expedition, was drawn from the written journals and verbal recitals
of the officers on their return, by the Councillors Extraordinary,
Hendrick Swaardecroon and Cornelis Chastelijn. This report is given
for the first time in English in the present volume, from which it
appears that the part of the coast visited was carefully explored,
and that the Dutch had intercourse with the natives, a result in
which De Vlaming's expedition had entirely failed. In the
miscellaneous tracts of Nicholas Struyck, printed at Amsterdam, 1753,
is also given an imperfect account of this voyage, as follows: "March
1st, 1705. Three Dutch vessels were sent from Timor with orders to
explore the north coast of New Holland, better than it had before
been done. They carefully examined the coast, sand banks, and reefs.
In their route to it, they did not meet with any land, but only some
rocks above water, in 11&deg; 52' south latitude." (probably, says
Flinders, the south part of the great Sahul Bank, which, according to
Captain Peter Heywood, who saw it in 1801 lies in 11&deg; 40'). "They
saw the west coast of New Holland, four degrees to the eastward of
the east point of Timor. From thence, they continued their route
towards the north, and passed a point, off which lies a bank of sand
above water, in length more than five German miles of fifteen to a
degree. After which they made sail to the east, along the coast of
New Holland; observing everything with care, until they came to a
gulf, the head</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxv}</u></p>

<p>of which they did not quite reach. I (Struyck) have seen a chart
made of these parts."</p>

<p>Flinders remarks upon this account, "What is here called the west,
must have been the north-west coast," and he is right; for in the
report here printed, the country is called "Van Diemen's Land",
lying, as we know, on the north-west coast of New Holland, already in
this introduction frequently referred to in distinction from the
island more generally so known, and now called Tasmania. Flinders
continues: "which the vessels appear to have made somewhat to the
south of the western Cape Van Diemen. The point which they passed was
probably this same cape itself; and in a chart published by Mr.
Dalrymple, August 27th, 1783, from a Dutch manuscript (possibly a
copy of that which Struyck had seen), a shoal of thirty geographic
miles in length, is marked as running off from it, but incorrectly,
according to Mr. M Cluer. The gulf here mentioned was probably a deep
bay in Arnhem's Land; for had it been the Gulf of Carpentaria, some
particular mention of the great change in the direction of the coast
would, doubtless, have been made."</p>

<p>In the year 1718 a Mons. Jean Pierre Purry, of Neufchatel,
published a work entitled, <i>Memoire sur le Pays des Caffres et la
Terre de Nuyts par rapport a l'utilite que la Compagnie des Indes
Orientales en pourroit retirer pour son Commerce</i>, followed by a
second memoir in the same year. These publications were explanatory
of a project he entertained of founding a colony in the land of
Nuyts. The scheme had</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxvi}</u></p>

<p>been submitted to the Governor General, Van Swell, at Batavia, but
was discountenanced. It subsequently met the same fate when laid by
its author before the Directors of the Dutch East India Company at
Amsterdam. M. Purry shortly afterwards brought his proposition before
the West India Company, and it was supposed by some that the voyage
of Roggeween to the South Seas in 1721 was a result of this
application; but it is distinctly stated by Valentyn that it was an
entirely distinct expedition. In 1699 Roggeween's father had
submitted to the West India Company a detailed memoir on the
discovery of the southern land; but the contentions between Holland
and Spain prevented the departure of the fleet destined for the
expedition, and it was forgotten. Roggeween, however, who had
received his father's dying injunctions to prosecute this enterprise,
succeeded at length in gaining the countenance of the directors, and
was himself appointed commander of the three ships which were fitted
out by the company for the expedition. According to Valentyn, the
principal object of this voyage was the search for certain "islands
of gold", supposed to lie in 36&deg; south latitude; but the
professed purpose was distinctly avowed by Roggeween to be directed
to the south lands. Although the expedition resulted in some useful
discoveries, it did not touch the shores of New Holland.</p>

<p>The last document in the collection here printed is a translation
from a little work published in Dutch, in 1857, by Mr. P.A. Leupe,
Captain of Marines in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxvii}</u></p>

<p>the Dutch Navy, "The Houtman's Abrolhos in 1727", detailing the
disasters of which those dangerous shoals had been the cause.</p>

<p>It will be seen that we have been unable to supply any descriptive
account of discoveries on the Eastern coast of Australia. That it was
really discovered, and in all probability by the Portuguese in the
early part of the sixteenth century, we have already endeavoured to
show. During more than two centuries from that period, it was
probably never visited by any European. The honour of exploring that
portion of that great island was reserved for the immortal Cook, who
first saw the coast on April 19th, 1770, but a reference to such well
known explorations certainly does not fall within the scope of
antiquarian investigation. The like may be said of the first visit to
Van Diemen's Land, subsequent to Tasman's discovery in 1642, which
was made by Marion a hundred and thirty years later.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it would be inappropriate to omit the remark that
it is to that most able and distinguished voyager, Matthew Flinders,
to whose valuable work, <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis</i>, the
editor has been greatly indebted for help in his introduction, that
we have to give the credit for the compact and useful name which
Australia now bears. In a note contained in page 111 of his
introduction, he modestly says, "Had I permitted myself any
innovation upon the original term (Terra Australis), it would have
been to convert it into Australia, as being more agreeable to the
ear,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxviii}</u></p>

<p>and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of
the earth".</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It has been the habit, for the most part, of editors of works for
the Hakluyt Society, to endeavour to elucidate their text by
introductions, which have often reached to a considerable length; a
very slight consideration of the nature of the subjects which the
Society professes to deal with, will show the reasonableness, nay,
even the necessity of such introductions. When the attention of a
reader is invited to the narrative of a voyage, however interesting
and curious in itself, which carries him back to a remote period, it
is but reasonable that he should have explained to him the position
which such a narrative, arbitarily selected, holds in the history of
the exploration of the country treated of. To do this satisfactorily
is clearly a task requiring no little labour, and although it may
necessarily involve a somewhat lengthy dissertation, certainly calls
for no apology. Nevertheless, the simple fact of an introduction
bearing at length at all approaching to that of the text itself, as
is the case in the present volume, does, beyond question, at the
first blush, justly require an explanation. All the publications of
our society consist of previously unpublished documents, or are
reprints or translations of narratives of early voyages become
exceedingly rare. But it is evidently a matter of accident to what
length the text may extend, while it is equally evident that the
introductory</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: cxix}</u></p>

<p>matter illustrative of a small amount of text may be of necessity,
longer than that required to illustrate documents of greater extent.
This is strikingly the case with the subject of the present volume.
It has been a matter of good fortune that the editor has been enabled
to bring together even so many documents as are here produced, in
connection with the early discoveries of Australia, while the
enigmatical suggestions of early maps, unaccompanied by any
descriptive matter to be found after diligent research, has
necessitated an inquiry into their merits, which, though lengthy, it
is hoped will not be deemed unnecessary. This so called introduction
in fact, in a great measure consists of matter, which, if supplied by
original documents, would form a component part of the text

<p>The editor cannot close his labours on this most puzzling subject
of the "Early Indications of Australia", without expressing an
earnest hope that further researches may yet result in the production
of documents, as yet undiscovered, which may throw a light upon the
history of the exploration of this interesting country in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and, if possible, solve the
great mystery which still hangs over the origin of the early
manuscript maps so fully treated of, and it is hoped, not without
some advance towards elucidation, in this introduction.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-02"></a>A MEMORIAL ADDRESSED TO HIS CATHOLIC MAJESTY
PHILIP THE THIRD, KING OF SPAIN, BY DR. JUAN LUIS ARIAS, RESPECTING
THE EXPLORATION, COLONIZATION, AND CONVERSION OF THE SOUTHERN
LAND.</h3>

<p>SIRE,--The memorial of the Doctor Juan Luis Arias showeth: That in
consideration of the great advantage which will accrue to the service
of Your Majesty, to the extension of the Catholic Church, and to the
increase of our holy faith, from the conversion of the gentiles of
the southern land, which is the principal obligation to which Your
Majesty and your crown are pledged, he now earnestly begs (great as
have been his former importunities) to solicit Your Majesty's
consideration to that which is here set forth. At the instance of the
fathers of the Seraphic order of St. Francis, and in particular of
the father Fray Juan de Silva, he has composed a treatise dedicated
to his most serene highness the Infant Don Ferdinand<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, from which a judgment may</p>

<blockquote>[*1) In the collective volume in the British Museum which
contains the original of the present memorial, are several memorials
to the king from the Fray Juan de Silva, advocating the same cause on
general religious and political grounds; but the editor has been
unable to find the treatise here referred to as dedicated to the
Infant Don Ferdinand, nor is any mention made of it by Nicolas
Antonio or Leon Pinelo, both of whom speak of the memorials addressed
to the king.]</blockquote>

<p>be formed of the temperature, productions and population of the
southern hemisphere, and every other point desirable to be understood
with respect to its most extensive provinces and kingdoms. He has
done this with a view to its discovery, and the spiritual and
evangelical conquest, and bringing in to our holy faith and Catholic
religion of its numberless inhabitants, who are so long waiting for
this divine and celestial benefit at the hand of Your Majesty. It is
a subject upon which the father Fray Juan de Silva has bestowed the
most serious attention, and for which he is most anxiously
solicitous; for all his order desire to be engaged in this mighty
enterprise, which is one of the greatest that the Catholic Church
ever has, or ever can undertake, and the accomplishment of which it
is the duty of all us her faithful sons to pray should be accelerated
as much as possible. For the English and Dutch heretics, whom the
devil unites for this purpose by every means in his power, most
diligently continue the exploration, discovery, and colonization of
the principal ports of this large part of the world in the Pacific
Ocean, and sow in it the most pernicious poisons of their apostasy
which they put forth with the most pressing anxiety in advance of us,
who should put forth the sovereign light of the gospel. This they are
now perseveringly doing in that great continent in which are the
provinces of Florida, and they will afterwards proceed to do the same
with New Spain, and then with New Mexico, the kingdom of Quivira, the
Californias, and other most extensive provinces. For which purpose,
and for other reasons connected with their machinations against our
kingdom, they have already colonized Virginia. To further the same
object also, they have fortified and colonized Bermuda, and continue
most zealously and rapidly sowing the infernal poison of their
heresy, and infecting with it the millions upon millions of excellent
people who inhabit those regions. From Virginia also they are
advancing most rapidly inland, with the most</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 3}</u></p>

<p>ardent desire to deprive the Catholic Church of the inestimable
treasure of an infinite number of souls; and to found in that land an
empire, in which they will at length possess much better and richer
Indies than our own, and from which position they will be able to
lord it absolutely over all our territories, and over all our
navigation and commerce with the West Indies. This is a most grievous
case for us, and most offensive to our Lord God and His Church, and
this kingdom has reason to dread from so mischievous a state of
things very great injuries from the hands of these enemies, and no
less punishment from the divine indignation for having allowed these
basilisks to locate themselves in such a position; from whence,
before we of the Catholic Church arrive with the preaching of the
gospel with which we are commissioned, they draw to themselves and
infect with the depravity of their apostasy that countless number of
gentiles which inhabit the said provinces, and which cover a greater
surface of land than all Europe.</p>

<p>But as the said tretise of the southern hemisphere has not yet
been put into a form to be communicated, which will soon be done, I
have resolved herein to relate to Your Majesty, although very
briefly, some of its contents; in order, meanwhile, to afford the
necessary information concerning these southern lands, whither it is
proposed to set on foot so great and mighty an undertaking as the
evangelical and spiritual conquest of the said hemisphere.</p>

<p>In order to understand the question, it must be premised that the
whole globe of earth and waters is divided into two equal parts or
halves by the equinoctial line. The northern hemisphere, which
stretches from the equinoctual to the Arctic Pole, contains all which
has been hitherto discovered and peopled in Asia, Europe and the
chief part of Africa. The remaining half, or southern hemisphere,
which reaches from the equinoctial to the Antarctic Pole, comprises
part of what we call America, and the whole of that Austral Land,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 4}</u></p>

<p>the discovery and apostolic conquest of which is now treated of.
Now, if we except this southern hemisphere all that there is of
Africa lying between the equinoctial line and the Cape of Good Hope,
and all that there is of Peru from the parallel of the said
equinoctial line, which passes near Quito, down to the straits of
Magellan, and that small portion of land which lies to the south of
the strait, all the rest of the firm land of the said southern
hemisphere remains to be discovered. Thus of the whole globe, there
is little less than one entire half which remains to be discovered,
and to have the gospel preached in it; and this discovery and
evangelical conquest forms the principal part of the obligation under
which these kingdoms lie for the preaching of the gospel to the
gentiles, in conformity with the agreement made with the Catholic
Church and its head, the supreme pontiffs Alexander VI and Paul
III.</p>

<p>Some one will say, that what has been stated is contradictory to
what the Apostle understands as meant by the Psalmist with reference
to the preaching of the gospel, where he says, "Their sound is gone
out in every land, and their words unto the ends of the world." For
the Apostle, speaking of the conversion of the gentiles, says thus:
"How shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? and how
shall they believe in Him in whom they have not heard? or how shall
they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they
be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that
preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things."
Then shortly after the Apostle sayeth: "But I say, 'Have they not
heard? Yes verily, their sound is gone out into all the earth, and
their words unto the ends of the world." According to which it seems
that it must be affirmed, either that then or now the preaching of
the gospel has already had its course, and its voice gone out
throughout all the world, or that the gospel was to be only preached
for</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 5}</u></p>

<p>the most part in the northern hemisphere and in some very small
part of the aforesaid lands of Africa and Peru in the southern; and
that in the remainder of the world there is no population or
discovered land-surface uncovered by water where there could be
populations or habitations, and thus that the voice of the gospel has
already run its course as far as it can, and that in the rest of the
southern hemisphere there is no provision for it. To all this I
reply, that these words of the Psalmist were a prophecy of the
preaching of the gospel, speaking out of the past into the future,
with the infallible certainty of prophecy. And although the Apostle
in quoting the said passage of the Psalmist, seems to affirm that
already in his time the preaching of the gospel had had its course
throughout the world, it is to be understood that he speaks in the
sense of the aforesaid prophecy; that the preaching of the voice of
the gospel had to run, and not that it had already run throughout the
whole of the globe, since his quotation of the said passage of the
Psalmist was made at so early a period that the gospel was then
preached only in a small part of the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The passage of the Apostle where he so speaks may be also thus
understood: he could not say that the gentiles did not hear the voice
or word of the gospel to their conversion, because already it has
gone forth from the apostolic seminary for the conversion of all the
earth; and in order that it may reach to its boundaries so that no
portion of the gentiles throughout the world should remain to which
it should not reach, and into which it should not penetrate. Moreover
it may be understood in this sense, that he speaks of the gentiles
(after the consummation of the preaching of the gospel) as placed at
the divine tribunal, and as giving to understand that those who would
not be converted should have no remission; and on this point the
Apostle puts the following question: "Haply all have not the word of
the gospel, else if they had heard it would they not have</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 6}</u></p>

<p>embraced it?" and that they had all heard it is a certain thing,
since the sound of the gospel Voice has sounded throughout all the
earth; so that in all these senses this expression of the Apostle may
be understood without opposition in any way to the strictness of its
genuine and literal meaning. And if anyone should say that the
nearest explanation of the passage would be, that the sound of the
preaching of the gospel might reach to the ends of the earth in the
interval that took place between the time when the Apostles Went
forth to preach the gospel, after the Redeemer had gone up to heaven,
and the time when St. Paul said these words,--the answer is, that
although the preaching of the gospel may have travelled far in the
said interval, it did not extend over any great part even of the
northern hemisphere, as is very manifest; and thus the southern
hemisphere still remained, and has remained until now, without the
voice of the gospel being preached or sounded in it, always excepting
those parts of Africa and Peru which are comprehended therein, but
which when its extent is considered, form a very small part of it.
Moreover, the equinoctial line, which is, as it were, the boundary of
the two hemispheres, may be understood to represent the ends of the
earth, to some parts of which the preaching of the gospel might reach
in the said interval. But this is not contradictory to our
proposition, and if due consideration be given to the subject it will
be seen, that Christ our Redeemer has pointed out to us with much
clearness, that this preaching of the gospel in the southern
hemisphere should take place after that in the north; for in giving
charge to His Apostles, and through them to those apostolic men who
should succeed them, that they should preach the gospei, it appears
that He gave them to understand that that charge was principally and
directly given for the northern hemisphere; for He spoke to them in
this manner "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them
also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 7}</u></p>

<p>and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd." Now although some
Greek and Latin doctors have understood that by these two folds the
Redeemer meant, firstly, that of the Jews, who were to be brought
into the Church, and who, from the commencement of the preaching of
the gospel, would continue to be converted; and, secondly, that of
the gentiles which he pointed out thus distinctly because it was to
be the principal fold; yet the said passage is not well explained in
this manner, as time and the progress of gospel preaching have since
shown; and inasmuch as it would follow from the said interpretation
that, in some sense, the Redeemer had committed to the Apostles the
preaching to the Jews only, and, as by original intention, reserved
to Himself the preaching to the gentiles; that was not the case,
since the preaching to all the principal of the gentiles of the
northern hemisphere was divided among the Apostles, and, in fact,
they continued carrying out the injunction. The subsequent election
also of the Apostle who was the chosen vessel for preaching to the
gentiles must be understood in the same manner. Thus our Lord the
Redeemer made a distinction in this passage between the two principal
folds which were to be brought into the pale of the Church. The
first, that of the gentiles of the northern hemisphere, the immediate
preaching to whom was enjoined upon the Apostles; the other, that of
the southern hemisphere, whose conversion to our holy faith He
appears to have reserved to Himself when He says, that they should
take care to bring within the pale of the Church the sheep of the
northern hemisphere, and that He would take upon Himself the charge
of bringing in the others as in His own person, and it is a very
certain fact that that injunction is now in course of being carried
out, from the Franciscan order having gone forth and undertaken the
extension of this great enterprise. For its seraphic and sovereign
chief, the most glorious patriach St. Francis, possessed in his own
person so express</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 8}</u></p>

<p>and true an image of the Redeemer, that it might very well be said
that the fold of the southern hemisphere should be brought in by Him
in person, it being that which that exalted patriach reserved to
himself to bring in to the pale of the Church through the medium of
the faithful sons of his institute and order. Thus it is seen in this
passage in how great esteem the Almighty Lord held this extensive and
precious fold of the southern hemisphere, which His Church hopes for;
since He says that the sheep thereof, as those which are most chosen
and drawn by His hand or by that of His seraphic and sovereign
standard bearer, are to hear His voice with the most singular
affection and devotion, receive His doctrine and faith and be most
faithful to Him, continuing always most constant and firm therein;
not like those of the northern hemisphere, amongst whom there has
been so great a defection and apostasy, so great a number of
provinces of the northern hemisphere having deserted their faith and
apostatized so that the Catholic faith, in the purity in which the
Apostles preached it, may be said to remain only in that little
portion which is governed by the head of the Church and in these
kingdoms of Spain, in which the divine providence by such great means
preserves it as a chosen seminary and as a refined and pure
plantation of religion, from which it should be transplanted to that
southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>And thus the sovereign commission to preach the gospel to the said
southern hemisphere appertained as of a necessity to those kingdoms,
as those which the Redeemer had distinguished and preferred to the
rest, in order that they should attract that hemisphere, which is to
be the most enlightened of the Catholic and faithful fold of His
Church. Whence it follows, that the principal compact and agreement
into which these kingdoms have entered with the Church in undertaking
to preach the gospel, is directed toward the preaching to the
aforesaid southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Some one, however, may say in opposition to the above</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 9}</u></p>

<p>argument that the commission which the Redeemer gave to the
Apostles to preach the gospel should be understood as being general
and therefore applying to both hemispheres, in accordance with what
He said to them before He ascended into heaven: "Go ye into all the
world, and preach the gospel to every creature." As also relates St.
Matthew: "All power is given to me in heaven and earth. Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." The same also is
written by the evangelist St. Luke. The answer to all this is, that
it in no sense contradicts the distinction which has been made
between the two principal folds of the gentiles which had to be taken
from these two hemispheres; for in the passage quoted, Christ our
Redeemer speaks in the persons of the Apostles, with all the
apostolic men and preachers of the gospel who were to succeed them
until the end of the world; but that which he committed to them bore
immediate reference to the northern hemisphere which was that which
they divided amongst themselves and where they preached, for not one
of the Apostles has been understood to have passed to the southern
hemisphere. The words also that the Redeemer added in the
abovementioned passage: "And there shall be one fold and one
shepherd", prove that He there speaks of the fold which was to be
converted from the southern hemisphere; becuase, until that
hemisphere be settled, the preaching of the gospel will not have been
consummated, and consequently the making one fold of the two
hemispheres under one shepherd cannot be verified. This the
conversion and spiritual and evangelical conquest of the southern
hemisphere has remained to be effected by the Apostolic men of this
kingdom.</p>

<p>Moreover, long ago, the Divine Majesty foretold this same thing by
the prophet Obadiah, who says thus "The captivity of Jerusalem which
is in the Bosphorus, shall possess the cities of the south, and
Saviours shall come up on Mount</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 10}</u></p>

<p>Sion to judge the Mount of Esau." And where our Vulgate puts
Bosphorus the Hebrew text says Sepharat, which signifies Spain,
according to the Chaldaic paraphrast and the Sederholan of the
Hebrews and Rabbi Zonathas Abenuciel and many other Hebrews. And it
is with much propriety that, in the place of Spain, our interpreter
has put Bosphorus, for that word signifies the passage of an ox, that
is to say; a strait. Now there are in the Mediterranean three straits
of this name; one is called the Thracian Bosphorus, which is that of
Constantinople, which is the passage from the said Mediterranean to
the Black Sea; another is called the Commerian Bosphorus, which is
the passage from the Black Sea to the Lake Meotis; the third is the
Gaditan Bosphorus, which is the Strait of Gibraltar. When, therefore,
hydrographers speak of the Bosphorus alone without addition, it is
understood to mean the principal one in the Mediterranean, by which
it communicates with the ocean and therefore the prophet Obadiah
meant the same when he said "the captivity of Jerusalem which is in
the Bosphorus," that is to say, which is in Spain. But, as has been
said, our translator has with much propriety and in accordance with
the intention of the prophet, given Bosphorus as the rendering for
the word Sepharat; for although the transmigration of Jerusalem which
was in Spain was to possess the cities of the south, its conquerors
had to go forth principally from that part of Spain which is nearest
to the Bosphorus, or of Gibraltar, as is seen to be the case.</p>

<p>The literal meaning of this prophecy therefore, is that the
transmigration of Jerusalem which was in the Bosphorus, that is to
say, the Spaniards who have beet-the most constant of the faithful
and to whom was transmitted the perseverance of the faith of Abraham
and Jacob, are to possess the cities of the south, that is to say the
southern hemisphere, gaining over it a spiritual and apostolical
conquest by the preaching of the gospel. And then the saviours, who
are</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 11}</u></p>

<p>the preachers of the gospel and who bring salvation to the
gentile, shall come up to Mount Sion to judge the Mount of Esau,
which is as much as to say, they shall ascend to the highest climax
of the sovereign virtues, from whence they shall announce to the
gentiles the true knowledge of their Creator and Redeemer. And thus
they shall judge them by condemning and extirpating their errors, and
reducing them to the purity of our holy faith. After their conversion
also, they shall judge them at the divine tribunal of the sacrament
of penitence. The prophet concludes by saying: "And the kingdom shall
be the Lord's." For when these Catholic kingdoms shall have drawn to
the faith this southern hemisphere and shall have proclaimed and sung
this glorious victory the Redeemer will have made perfect the kingdom
of His Church, which now is defective in the greatest part from not
having accomplished this grand object. Hence it may be gathered how
great a service this will be to the Redeemer, and how blessed will be
the prince of this monarchy who shall undertake and complete it. Thus
it has been seen that the prophet Obadiah prophecied to the letter
the conquest and spiritual possession of the southern hemisphere,
through the medium of the preaching of the gospel by the Spanish
nation, which has preserved in its integrity the faith of the
Redeemer and of His Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Some have asked, as already pointed out, whether the southern
hemisphere be not all water, forming, as it were, a great part of the
ocean, so as to leave but little of the surface of the earth in it
uncovered. The reply to this is, that, according to what we are
taught by sacred writ and by philosophical reasoning, there is
proportionably as great a surface of land uncovered in the southern
hemisphere as in the northern. For the fiat of the Creator, that the
waters should be collected into certain hollows of the earth, in
order that there should remain uncovered the portion that was
necessary for the production of vegetation, as where He says in
Genesis</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 12}</u></p>

<p>the 1st: "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
into one place, and let the dry land appear," supposes this water to
have been created au entire orb, which covered and surrounded the
whole of the earth, in the same manner as we reckon the positions of
the elements; the land the lowest, in the middle of which is the
centre of the whole elementary and celestial machine then the water,
and after that the air and igneous substance or the fire, which
reaches its culmination or convex part in the concave of the
celestial firmament. Then if, when God commanded that the waters
should be gathered together, it was to be understood solely with
reference to the northern hemisphere, the water in the southern
hemisphere would remain as it was, surrounding and covering all, and
the whole sphere of water could not he contained beneath one
spherical surface equidistant to the centre of gravity, which always
seeks to be united with the centre of the whole machine. And thus all
the water of the southern hemisphere would be more remote from the
said centre than that of the other hemisphere, without being
contained in any sinus, and thus would be much higher, and naturally
could not contain itself without flowing towards the other
hemisphere, until it placed itself in equilibrium with the said
centre of gravity; as is plainly gathered from the demonstration of
Archimedes, in his work "De Insidentibus Aquae," and is manifestly
seen in the ebb and flow of the ocean: in which it is observed, that
when the water rises above the surface of equidistance from its
centre of gravity it immediately outflows its ordinary limits until
it finds its level with that surface; so that the gathering together
of the waters was proportional in the two halves of the sphere of
earth and water, gathering itself into certain hollows of the earth,
which also have their means of correspondence between the two
hemispheres. For as the quiet and equilibrium of the parts of the
earth and water with respect to the centre of gravity consist in the
equal</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 13}</u></p>

<p>tendencies of the opposite parts towards the same centre, it
follows that the sinuses or receptacles of water in the one half are
nearly proportioned in their position and other respects to those of
the other. From all which it follows, that in the southern hemisphere
there is an uncovered surface of land correspondent, or nearly so, to
that which has been discovered in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>If any one should say in opposition to the above argument, that
the Psalmist appears to assert that the hemisphere opposite to the
northern was entirely covered with water, when he says: "Who
stretcheth out the earth above the waters, for His mercy endureth for
ever;"--in which the real meaning of the royal prophet would seem to
be, that that half of the earth which is between the equinoctial and
the Arctic pole was that which was peopled, and that, as by a
miracle, all the earth was stretched out above the waters, which
covered the other half as far as the Antarctic pole--the answer is,
that the Psalmist does not intend to say absolutely that the earth is
stretched out above the waters; for that is impossible, since these
two bodies, earth and water, gravitate towards the centre of gravity,
which is that of the mass or sphere of land and water and thus of
necessity the water upon the earth is contained in its hollows; but,
as by an allegory, he said that it might seem to those who inhabit
the one hemisphere, that the land was stretched upon the waters which
extended towards the other hemisphere, as it is our custom in
imagination to think that the antipodes are below those to whom they
are antipodes, it being in conformity to the law of gravitation that
both one and the other are alike uppermost, and the lower part, which
is the centre of gravity, towards which both incline, is common to
all.</p>

<p>And thus, in agreement with this, the same prophet, speaking of
the divine foundation of the earth, says also in another place: "Who
bath founded the earth upon its own stability, that it shall not he
moved for ever;" which was as much as</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 14}</u></p>

<p>to say, that the earth has no other stability or foundation for
its remaining in the position in which it is: but its own stability,
which consists in the equal tendencies of its opposite parts towards
the centre of gravity, a law to which the water also is subjected,
and, as it rests upon the earth, it keeps the same relation to the
centre of gravity; from all which results the aforesaid equalization
of the whole mass of earth and water to that centre, and in this
consists its stability. Hence it follows that the Psalmist, in the
passage first quoted, spoke generally of the two hemispheres; since
the inhabitants of each one might imagine to themselves that all the
earth of that hemisphere was kept in its place by the water contained
in the hollows of the other. The expression that the earth never
shall move at any time, implies that it is naturally impossible that
its centre of gravity should be moved from the centre of the entire
elementary and celestial system, for that would be that gravitation
should ascend or move upwards. Hence the statements of the Psalmist
in no way opposes what has been demonstrated that there is as much
surface of land uncovered and free from water in the southern
hemisphere as there is in the northern.</p>

<p>Also, if we recur to the celestial influences which, in regard to
temperature, affect the earth and water with dryness and cold heat
and moisture, cold and moisture and heat and dryness, and cause some
parts of the earth to be uncovered by water and to be kept dry; while
others remain underwater; these are the influence of the fixed stare
which are vertical to the southern hemisphere and as efficacious as
those of the northern hemisphere for keeping the parts of the said
southern hemisphere dry, uncovered, and habitable, as may be proved
by observing the celestial objects which correspond to each
hemisphere; when it will be seen that, of the forty-eight fixed
stars, four-and-twenty correspond to each hemisphere, and also of the
twelve signs of the zodiac, six belong to each; so that it cannot be
doubted that there is in the southern</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 15}</u></p>

<p>hemisphere at least as great a part of the earth's surface
uncovered as in the north. Now it is consequently manifest that this
part of the earth is as fertile and habitable as the northern
hemisphere, for the south has of necessity the same distribution of
zones as the north; that is to say, half of the torrid zone from the
equinoctial line to the tropic of Capricorn, then the temperate zone
from that to the Antarctic Circle, and then that which lies between
the Antarctic Circle and the Antarctic Pole; and those zones in the
two hemispheres which correspond to each other, have (allowance being
made for the natural motion of the sun through the ecliptic) the
same, or nearly the same temperature excepting such differences as
are caused by certain vertical stars and the various form,
arrangement, and temperament of the land, from which it occurs that
in the hottest part of a zone, there are some spots very temperate
and cool. And thus in those zones which are generally cold, there are
some parts that are milder and very free from the severity of the
cold. And if particular consideration be given to the influences
produced on temperature by the constellations belonging to the
southern hemisphere it will be found that there are lands in it, not
only habitable, but much more so than in the other hemisphere; and it
has been seen by experience, from the discoveries which have been
made in that half of the torrid zone which is south of the equator,
that whereas the ancients considered its heat to be so excessive that
it was utterly uninhabitable, there have been found in it parts as
habitable and of as mild a temperature as in the most temperate and
habitable parts of Spain. This has been shown in the country of the
Baia de Sanfelipe y Santiago, discovered by Captain Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros which is very near to the middle of the southern half of
the torrid zone, where, in the month of May, was found the same
mildness of temperature, the same songs of birds in the twilight, the
same agreeableness and delight in the softness of the air, as is
found in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 16}</u></p>

<p>Spain in the mildest and most refreshing season of spring and
although, in the middle of the time that they were in the bay, the
sun went down about 20&deg; to the north, which, together with the
fifteen or twenty minutes of the latitude of the bay, made their
distance from the sun, which was in the south of the zenith, little
more than twenty-five degrees, and thus fofty-five of southern
altitude; yet was the temperature extremely mild for a situation so
near to the middle of the southern half of the torrid zone. But in
other islands which they discovered in the same southern half of the
torrid zone, when the sun stood in southern signs for January,
February and March, being vertical or very near the vertex or zenith
of those islands, there was not felt greater heat there than in our
summer, no, indeed, did there appear to have been so much on those
occasions when they went on shore for the purpose of taking in
water.</p>

<p>By the same reasoning it is shown, that the land of the southern
hemisphere is greatly stored with metals and rich in precious stones
and pearls, fruits and animals; and from the discoveries and
investigations which have been already made in this southern
hemisphere, there has been found such fertility, so great plenty and
abundance of animals, swine, oxen and other beasts of different kinds
fit for the sustenance of man as has never been seen in our Europe;
also of birds and fishes of different species, and amongst them all,
those which we most value as wholesome and delicate on the shores of
our own ocean; and fruits, some of which we already know, and others
of different kinds, all which may well excite the greatest
admiration, as has been related in detail in the treatise referred to
at the beginning of this memorial.</p>

<p>It must be observed that, although the arguments we have hitherto
advanced refer to the entire southern hemisphere, yet that which we
now propose to have explored, discovered, and evangelically subdued
is that part of the said hemisphere</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 17}</u></p>

<p>which lies in the Pacific Ocean, between the longitude of the
coast of Peru, as far as the Baia de San Felipe y Santiago and the
longitude which remains up to Bachan and Ternate, in which longitude
the following most remarkable discoveries have already been made. The
adelantado Alvaro Mendana de Meyra first discovered New Guadalcanal,
'which is a very large island very near New Guinea; and some have
imagined that what Mendana called New Guadalcanal was part of New
Guinea, but this is of no consequence whatever. New Guinea belongs
also to the southern hemisphere, and was discovered some time before;
and almost all of it has been since discovered on the outside [the
northern side]. It is a country encompassed with water,<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> and according to the greater number of those
who have seen it, is seven hundred leagues in circuit: others make it
much more: we do not give a close calculation here, because what has
been said is sufficient for the intention of this discourse. The rest
will be said in its proper place. The middle of those great islands
are in from thirteen to 14&deg; of south latitude. The adelantado
Mendana afterwards discovered the archipelago of islands which he
called the Islands of Solomon, whereof, great and small, he saw
thirty-three of very fine appearance, the middle of which was,
according to his account, in 11&deg; south latitude. After this he
discovered, in the year 1565, the island of San Christobal not far
from the said archipelago, the middle of which was in from seven</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Dalrymple, in quoting this passage, thinks that the
word "Aislada", here translated according to its general meaning,
"encompassed with water", in this place rather signifies "separated
into islands". This suggstion is, however, entirely arbitrary, and
even in contradiction to the context, which states the supposed
circuit of the island. Even in maps anterior to the voyage of Torres,
as, for example, Hondius's Mappemonde, showing Drake's track round
the world, published in the Hakluyt Society's edition of Drake's
<i>World Encompassed</i>, New Guinea is laid down as an island,
although it is true that in much later maps the point is spoken of as
doubtful. Meanwhile, the editor sees no reason to deviate from the
recognized rendering of the word "Aislada".]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 18}</u></p>

<p>to eight&deg; of south latitude. The island was one hundred and
ten leagues in circuit. Subsequently, in the year '95, the said
adelantado sailed for the last time from Peru, taking with him for
his chief pilot the Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, with the purpose of
colonizing the island of San Christobal, and from thence attempting
the discovery of the southern terra firma. He shortly after
discovered to the east of the said island of San Christobel the
island of Santa Cruz in 10&deg; south latitude. The island was more
than 100 leagues in circuit, very fertile and populous, as, indeed,
appeared all those islands which we have mentioned, and most of them
of very beautiful aspect. In this island of Santa Cruz the adelantado
had such great contentions with his soldiers, that he had some of the
chief of them killed, because he understood that they intended to
mutiny, and a few days after he died. Whereupon, as the admiral of
the fleet had parted company a short time before they had reached the
island, the whole project was frustrated, and Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros took Dona Isabel Garreto, the wife of the adelantado and the
remainder of the fleet to Manilla.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, being at
Valladolid, came to this court to petition for the same discovery,
and was dispatched to the Viceroy of Peru, who was to supply him with
all that was requisite. He sailed from Lima in January of the year
1605, with three Vessels, the "Capitana", the "Almiranta", and one
"Zabra", with Luis Vaez de Torres for his admiral, in order to
colonize the island of Santa Cruz and to follow out the intentions of
the adelantado Mendana. After discovering in this voyage many islands
and islets, he put in at the island of Tuamaco, which is from eight
to nine leagues in circuit, in 10&deg; south latitude, and about one
thousand seven hundred leagues distant from Lima, which is about
eighty leagues to the eastward of the island of Santa Cruz. The
cacique or chief of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 19}</u></p>

<p>Taumaco informed him, as well as he could make himself understood,
that if he sought the coast of the great Terra Firma, he would light
upon it sooner by going to the south than to the island of Santa
Cruz; for in the south there were lands very fertile and populous,
and running down towards a great depth towards the said south. In
consequence of which Pedro Fernandez de Quiros abandoned his idea of
going to colonise the island of Santa Cruz, and sailed southward with
a slight variation to the south-west, discovering many islands and
islets, which were very populous and of pleasant appearance, until in
15&deg; 20' south, he discovered the land of the Baia de San Felipe y
Santiago, which, on the side that he first came upon, ran from east
to west. It appeared to be more than one hundred leagues long; the
country was very populous, and, although the people were dark, they
were very well favoured; there were also many plantations of trees,
and the temperature was so mild that they seemed to be in Paradise;
the air also, was so healthy, that in a few days after they arrived
all the man who were sick recovered. The land produced most
abundantly many kinds of very delicious fruits, as well as animals
and birds in great variety. The bay, also, was no less abundant in
fish of excellent flavour, and of all the kinds which are found on
the coast of the sea in Spain. The Indians ate for bread certain
roots like the batata, either roasted or boiled, which when the
Spaniards tasted they found them better eating and more sustaining
than biscuit.</p>

<p>For certain reasons (they ought to have been very weighty) which
hitherto have not been ascertained with entire certainty, Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros left the Almiranta and the Zabra in the said bay,
and himself sailed with his ship, the Capitana, for Mexico, from
whence he again came to this court to advocate anew the colonization
of that land, and was again sent back to the viceroy of Peru, and
died at Panama on his return voyage to Lima. The admiral Luis</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 20}</u></p>

<p>Vaez de Torres being left in the bay and most disconsolate for the
loss of the Capitana, resolved, with the consent of his companions,
to continue the discovery. Being prevented by stress of the weather
from making the circuit of the land of the Baia, to see whether it
were an island or mainland as they had imagined, and finding himself
in great straits in 21&deg; south, to which high latitude he had
persevered in sailing in about a south-westerly direction from the
fifteen or twenty minutes south in which lay the aforesaid Baia, he
put back to the north-west and north-east up to 14&deg;, in which he
sighted a very extensive coast, which he took for New Guadalcanal;
<i>from thence he sailed westward, having constantly on the right
hand the coast of another very great land which he continued
coasting, according to his own reckoning, more than six hundred
leagues, having it still to the right hand</i><b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> (in which course may be understood to be
comprehended New Guadalcanal and New Guinea). Along the same coast he
discovered a great diversity of islands. The whole country was very
fertile and populous; he continued his voyage on to Bachan and
Ternate, and from thence to Manilla, which was the end of his
discovery.</p>

<p>There was also a pilot named Juan Fernandez, who discovered the
track from Lima to Chili by going to the westward (which till then
had been made with much difficulty as they kept along shore, where
the southerly winds almost constantly prevail): he sailing from the
coast of Chili about the latitude of 40&deg;, little more or less, in
a small ship, with some of his companions, in courses between west
and south-west, and brought in a month's time to what was to the best
of their judgment, a very fertile and agreeable continent, inhabited
by a white and well-proportioned people,</p>

<blockquote>[*1) It is from this sentence that Dalrymple observed the
passage of Torres through these dangerous straits, and consequently
gave to them the name of that navigator.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 21}</u></p>

<p>of our own height, well clad, and of so peaceable and gentle a
disposition that, in every way they could express, they showed the
greatest hospitality, both with respect to the fruits and productions
of their country, which appeared in every respect very rich and
plentiful. But (being overjoyed to have discovered the coast of that
great and so much desired continent) he returned to Chili, intending
to go back properly fitted, and to keep it a secret till they and
their friends could return on the discovery. It was delayed from day
to day till Juan Fernandez died, when with his death, this important
matter fell to the ground.</p>

<p>In regard to this subject it must be observed, that many have
related this discovery of Juan Fernandez in the following manner,
affirming that they had it thus from himself, viz., that going to the
westward from Lima, to discover the track to Chili, waiting their
opportunity and getting off shore (where the winds almost always are
southerly), a certain space of longitude (which he would, at a proper
time declare); and then standing south with little deviation to the
adjoining points, he discovered the said coast of the southern
continent in the latitude (which he would also tell when expedient)
from whence he made his voyage to Chili.</p>

<p>Other relations, very worthy of credit, give this discovery as
before described; but whether it happened in this or the other
manner, or whether there were two different discourses, it is a very
certain fact that he did discover the coast of the southern land; for
it has been thus certified by persons of great credit and authority,
to whom the said Juan Fernandez communicated the account with the
above-mentioned proofs and details of the country and the people thus
discovered: and one of these witnesses, who made a statement thereof
to Your Majesty, as having heard it from the said pilot, and seen the
description he brought of the said coast, was the Maestro del Campo
Cortes, a man as worthy</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 22}</u></p>

<p>of credit as any that is known, and who has been employed in Chili
nearly sixty years.</p>

<p>When Pedro Fernandez de Quiros sailed from the coast of Peru he
followed nearly the same track until he reached the latitude of
26&deg; when his companions and especially his admiral, earnestly
advised him to continue on until he reached 40&deg;, as the most
reasonable means of finding the continent which they had come in
search of. This, for certain considerations he refused, being
apprehensive of unfavourable weather, as he saw that the sun already
began to decline towards the equinoctial; but in this refusal he made
a great mistake.</p>

<p>That which we have above related, is the most noticeable thing
which has hitherto been effected in the shape of discovery the
southern hemisphere in the said longitude in the Pacific; and
although, with the exception of the discovery made by the pilot Juan
Fernandez, no satisfactory examination of the coast of the much
sought for great southern continent has been effected, yet,
doubtless, the aforesaid voyage failed but little of finding it, and
it is either by negligence or by carelessness, and it may be said, by
the acknowledged blunders of some of the adventurers that it has not
yet been discovered for in their explorations they saw very great and
manifest signs of a most extensive continent; and when Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros reached the aforesaid 26&deg; they saw to the
south very extensive and thick banks of clouds in the horizon, and
other well known signs of mainland, and also a little islet, in which
were various kinds of birds of very sweet song, which never sing nor
are found at any great distance from the coast of the mainland. They
discovered afterwards some islands, still very remote from the coast
of Peru and Mexico, which apparently, could not have been peopled but
from the coast of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 23}</u></p>

<p>the southern continent. And in other islands which Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros discovered in the same voyage, long before he discovered
that of Taumaco, he stated that he saw some boys as fair and ruddy as
Flemings, amongst the natives of the islands who were almost swarthy,
and they said by signs that they brought those whites from a more
southern latitude. Nearly the same thing Was met with by the
adelantado Alvaro de Mendana, in some island which he discovered
before he reached San Christobel and Santa Cruz, as in those which he
called the four Marquesas de Mendoza and others in which there were
the same reasons for presuming that they could not have been peopled
from the coasts of Peru and Mexico, but from the southern land; not
only from the distance from those countries, but from the great
difference of the natives from the Indians of Peru and Mexico, and
because when questioned by signs they had no knowledge of any land
towards Mexico or Peru, and all seemed to point towards the
south.</p>

<p>It is of great importance towards the same argument, to take into
consideration the often confirmed indications given by the Indians of
Taumaco of there being a deep and spacious, populous and fertile
continent towards the south. The land also of the Baia de Dan Felipe
y Santiago showed very great signs of its being the coast of the
southern continent, as much by its great extent as by there being
visable from it, looming at a great distance, cordilleras of very
lofty mountains of very agreeable aspect; and by the fact of two
rivers falling into the bay, one as large as the Guadalquiver, and
the other not quite so broad, all signs of a continent Or at least of
a very spacious and deep country approach ing to a continent.</p>

<p>Many specious rivers were also seen to discharge themselves along
the coast which the pilot Juan Fernandez discovered, from which and
from the signs of the natives, and from the people being so white, so
well clad, and in all other</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 24}</u></p>

<p>respects so different from those of Chili and Peru, it was taken
for certain that it was the coast of the southern continent, and
seemed to be far better and richer than that of Peru. Besides all
this, the great number of large islands which, as has been stated,
have been discovered on voyages from the coast of Peru, made with the
object of discovering the southern land, are necessarily the
evidences of the proximity of a very large and not very distant
continent, as we see in the islands of the archipelago of San Lazaro,
nearwhich are the Phillippines, the Moluccas, Amboina, those of
Banda,<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> the Javas, and many others in
their neighbourhood, which are the evidences of the proximity of the
great coast of the continent of Asia; I now allude of India beyond
the Ganges, the kingdoms of Siam and Cambodia, that of the Great
Mogul of China, leaving out what lies more to the westward.</p>

<p>From all which it follows how infallibly certain is the greatness,
populousness, fertility and riches of the southern continent and how
readily, according to what has been above demonstrated, it may be
discovered and subjected to an evangelical and spiritual conquest, by
which may be attracted to our Mother, the Catholic Church, millions
upon millions of most faithful and sincere sons as the result of this
mighty evangelical conquest. And if the vast extent of the southern
continent of which we have been writing, were not such as it has thus
evidently been shown to be, for planting therein the purity of our
holy and Catholic religion, nevertheless we have in that portion of
the southern hemisphere which we have already seen and visited, if we
take into consideration all the above-mentioned islands, more land
than half of Europe, and as rich, populous, and fertile, in which
there is the full harvest of which Christ our Lord and treasure
spoke, to be cultivated by the holy labourers and preachers of His
gospel.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Printed in the original thus, "Bandalaizavas",
probably misprinted for Banda, las Zavas, or Java.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 25}</u></p>

<p>Your Majesty ought to give much consideration to the fact that
Christ our Redeemer and supreme good, when He finished the period of
His first coming, recommended to His Apostles with the greatest
strictness the preaching of His gospel, as the principal means by
which the redemption of the human race, which had cost him so much
was to receive its consummation. For this cause it was the last
charge He gave them, that they might understand that it was the
principal service they had to render Him, and for which He had chosen
them. Immediately after so doing He ascended up to heaven, to give to
His most holy humanity the seat of ineffable glory at the right hand
of His Father, and receive the crown of the sovereign and universal
empire over heaven and earth, as is shown by the evangelist St. Mark
in the passage quoted above: "And He said unto them, Go ye into all
the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth
and is baptised shall be saved:" And after He "had spoken unto them
He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And
they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them."
Thus also should Your Majesty set the eyes of your heart upon the
consummation of the preaching of the gospel in the southern
hemisphere, which this same Lord is now recounting to you with the
crown of the universal empire of the globe in His hand, ready to
place it upon your head, if you value, as it should be valued, this
Divine commission, and execute it with that zeal and devotion that
the charge enjoins. But, if which God forbid, Your Majesty should not
accept this commission, or with-hold the said zeal from the
undertaking, it would doubtless be the greatest disaster that could
happen to this kingdom, and the most certain sign that God is
withdrawing his Hand from us; and even already it seems that this
withdrawal has fallen upon us, in that we are not attempting a task
which applies to us so well, and which so much concerns these
kingdoms</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 26}</u></p>

<p>and all Your Majesty's possessions, and we do not seem to bethink
ourselves that, in neglecting and crushing so great an enterprise,
our most culpable and persevering remissness brings upon us this
grievous and abiding calamity which we shall realize with greater
certainty when we have to repair such great losses, for we shall have
to effect all our conversions amidst great blindness and error.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Your Majesty might not apprehend how that this
proposition is the most important that could be made for the welfare
of your crown, and that its most speedy and faithful execution should
be carried out with the same fervour and zeal as was shown at the
commencement by your most Christian predecessors the Catholic kings,
who frequently declared that, when other means failed, they
themselves would go forth to carry it into effect. By this means your
Majesty will return to find the road which they followed, and by
which they brought their kingdom to so great a height of prosperity,
from which exalted height it has, through the loss of time and
through repeated blunders and hinderances, continued falling, until
we have reached such a point that the most inconsiderable nations of
Europe, whom we formerly held beneath our feet, now look upon us as
an oppressed and afflicted nation and of small account, which is a
horrible fact, and an easily recognizable effect of the divine
indignation for the aforesaid cause, and there is no one who
correctly reasons upon this subject but will come to the same
conclusion.</p>

<p>Let me also invite Your Majesty's attention to the words of the
Apostle in the passage quoted above: "How shall they believe in Him
of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent?" And let
Your Majesty take into account that the Apostle is speaking with Your
Majesty yourself, and with your kingdoms, with reference to this very
point, in as much as the charge has been given for</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 27}</u></p>

<p>preaching to the entire southern hemisphere, and especially to
that which lies in the Pacific Ocean, and without allowing any other
Christian Prince should go or send preachers hither.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> If Your Majesty do not send them, how shall
they have any knowledge of their Redeemer and be converted to Him?
And as the charge was given that these gentiles were to. be
converted, Your Majesty and Your Crown will be principally
responsible for their conversion, for you will be the immediate cause
of that infinite number of gentiles not hearing the word of the
gospel or knowing their Redeemer; for as they should know Him who is
it that, if preachers are riot sent, has the guilt of not sending
them, and not allowing others to send them? May Your Majesty ponder
much upon this matter for it touches nothing less than your salavtion
and the final loss of your crown if we do not perfectly discharge
this most righteous duty, and acquit this most heavy debt to our Lord
and Redeemer, by sending, as speedily as possible to the southern
hemisphere, a sufficient number of preachers of the gospel.</p>

<p>May Your Majesty give no heed to the plausible arguments which
some may perhaps advance with some show of political consideration
that Your Majesty is not in a condition to undertake the conquest of
new kingdoms of such great extent and so far off, but will have
enough to do to keep those which you already have. There will also
not be wanting men learned in the scriptures, who will prove from
them that Your Majesty may disregard the fulfilment of an obligation
so distinct and may withdraw from the contract you have made with the
Redeemer, through the medium of His vicar and the head of His Church.
May Your Majesty</p>

<blockquote>[*1) We presume that the eccentric argument here
advanced, is based upon the inference deduced by the writer at the
commencement of this memorial, from the peculiar use in sacred writ
of the word "Sepharat," rendered in Latin "Bosphorus," the especial
meaning is there discussed. See page 10.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 28}</u></p>

<p>give no heed to this, but abominate it is mischievous to your
greatness, your conscience, and to your crown. For this conquest is
to be a spiritual and evangelical one, and by no means entailing, as
is supposed any considerable expense upon Your Majesty, nor a matter
which can divert you from walking conformably to the dictates of the
Apostle. But rather, in order to secure Your Majesty the restoration
and increase of your royal power to the extent of your desires, may
Your Majesty give the attention of your exalted understanding to the
words of the Apostle to his disciple Timothy, as if he had addressed
them personally to Your Majesty: "For the time will come (please Cod
that it may not be that in which we live) when they who are under an
obligation to follow sound doctrine so important as this, not only do
not receive it, but cannot endure it, heaping up to themselves the
opinions of men with the title of teachers, who thereby only flatter
them and conform to their wishes, turning away their ears from the
truth and changing it into fables." For such are the superficial
arguments of expediency for reasons of state which are advanced in
opposition to the extension of the Catholic Church and the increase
of our holy faith. The Apostle then says, and we may reasonably
understand him as on the present occasion addressing himself to Your
Majesty: "But do thou (whom as sovereign prince of this Catholic
monarchy, and as having made a contract with the King of kings, art
pledged by promise to the completing of the preaching of the gospel),
abominating those who shall propose to thee the contrary, watch day
and night over the fulfilment of this glorious and important
obligation, labour as much as lieth in you that it may be all
possible means be accomplished, do the work of an evangelist; for as
the evangelists wrote the gospel in order that thou mightest cause it
to be preached to the gentiles, do thou after thy manner perform the
same office which they performed in preaching. Placing great value on
the fact</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 29}</u></p>

<p>that the Redeemer would not entrust the charge to any other prince
but to thy illustrious house do thou give all thy strength to the
full and perfect completion of this grand and exalted ministry so
that no gap be left." By so doing Your Majesty will be able to say at
the day of account, that which immediately afterwards is said by the
Apostle:</p>

<p>"Bonum certamen certavi, cursum consummavi, fidem servavi; in
reliquo reposita est mihi corona justitiae, quam reddet mehi Dominus
in illa die justus judex, non solum autem mihi, sed his qui diligunt
adventum ejus." I have fought the good fight gloriously, overcoming
the greater power of Lucifer, liberating from his tyrannical and
abominable servitude so great a number of millions of souls in the
southern hemisphere which would have been lost and would have lost
the Redeemer, who laid upon me the charge of this great and heroic
deed; I have finished most faithfully my course; I have kept His
faith pure in this Catholic seminary of my kingdom, and have
transplanted it with the same purity into the hearts of the infinite
number of gentiles which dwell in that spacious fold; and thus may I
justly hope from the hand of the King Eternal, in the great day of
the universal account, the glorious and blessed crown of
righteousness (which the Apostle hoped for himself) from having
rendered this service, the most acceptable that any king or prince of
the world will have rendered to the Divine Majesty. The same Apostle
goes on to say, afterwards that not only would it be given to him,
but to all those who love the coming of the just Judge, which are
those who hold in such account the fulfilment of their obligations,
and especially of so heavenly a one as this, that they may justly
hope for the reward of that unspeakably glorious crown. Your Majesty
may also entertain a like security of hope that if the present
proposition and prayer be accepted and undertaken with the earnest
promptitude which, as has been shown, is enjoined upon you, there
will be added to your</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 30}</u></p>

<p>present enjoyment of these Catholic kingdoms, and of the other
possessions of your monarchy, every possible exaltation and
aggrandisement, which is the most affectionate desire of Your
Majesty's faithful subjects and servants.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-03"></a>RELATION OF LUIS VAEZ DE TORRES, CONCERNING
THE DISCOVERIES OF QUIROS, AS HIS ALMIRANTE. DATED MANILA, JULY 12,
1607.</h3>

<h4>A TRANSLATION, NEARLY LITERAL, BY ALEXANDER DALRYMPLE, ESQ., FROM
A SPANISH MANUSCRIPT COPY IN HIS POSSESSION.<br>
<br>
(First printed in Burney's <i>Discoveries in the South Sea</i>.Part
2, p. 467. London, 1806. 4to.)</h4>

<p>Being in this city of Manila, at the end of a year and a half of
navigation and making discovery of the lands and seas in the southern
parts; and seeing that the Royal Audience of Manila have not hitherto
thought proper to give me dispatches for completing the voyage as
Your Majesty commanded, and as I was in hopes of being the first to
give yourself a relation of the discover, etc., but being detained
here, and not knowing if, in this city of Manila, I shall receive my
dispatches, I have thought proper to send Your Majesty Fray Juan de
Merlo of the order of San Francisco one of the three religious who
were on board with me, who having been eye-witness, will give a full
relation to Your Majesty. The account from me is the following.</p>

<p>We sailed from Callao, in Peru, December 21st, 1605, with two
ships and a launch, under the command of Captain Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros, and I for his almirante; and without losing company, we stood
W.S.W., and went on this course 800 leagues.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 32}</u></p>

<p>In latitude 26&deg; S., it appeared proper to our commander not to
pass that latitude, because of changes in the weather: on which
account I gave a declaration under my hand that it was not a thing
obvious that we ought to diminish our latitude if the season would
allow, till we got beyond 30&deg;, my opinion had no effect; for from
the said 26&deg; S., we decreased our latitude in a W.N.W. course to
24&frac12;&deg; S. In this situation we found a small low island,
about two leagues long, uninhabited and without anchoring ground.</p>

<p>From hence we sailed W. by N. to 24&deg; S. In this situation we
found another island, uninhabited, and without anchorage. It was
about ten leagues in circumference. We named it San Valerio.</p>

<p>From hence we sailed W. by N. one day and then W.N.W. to
21&frac34;&deg; S., where we found another small low island without
soundings, uninhabited, and divided into pieces.</p>

<p>We passed on in the same course and sailed twenty-five leagues: we
found four islands in a triangle, five or six leagues each; low
uninhabited and without soundings. We named them las Virgines (the
Virgins). Here the variation was north-easterly.</p>

<p>From hence we sailed N.W. to 19&deg; S. In this situation we saw a
small island to the eastward, about three leagues distant. It
appeared like those we had passed. We named it Sta. Polonia.</p>

<p>Diminishing our latitude from hence half a degree we saw a low
island, with a point to the full of palms: it is in 13&frac12;&deg;
S. We arrived at it. It had no anchorage. We saw people on the beach:
the boats went to the shore, and when they reached it, they could not
land on account of the great surf and rocks. The Indians called to
them from the land: two Spaniards swam ashore: these they received
well, throwing their arms upon the ground, and embraced them and
kissed them in the face. On this friendship, a chief</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 33}</u></p>

<p>among them came on board the Capitana to converse, and an old
woman; who were clothed, and other presents were made to them, and
they returned ashore presently for they were in great fear. In return
for these good offices they sent a heap, or locks of hair, and some
bad feathers, and some wrought pearl oyster shells: these were all
their valuables. They were a savage people, mullattoes, and
corpulent: the arms they use are lances, very long and thick. As we
could not land nor get anchoring ground, we passed on steering
W.N.W.</p>

<p>We went in this direction from that island, getting sight of land.
We could not reach it from the first, on account of the wind being
contrary and strong with much rain: it was all of it very low, so as
in parts to be overflowed.</p>

<p>From this place in 16&frac12;&deg; S., we stood N.W. by N. to
10&frac34;&deg; S. In this situation we saw an island, which was
supposed to be that of San Bernardo, because it was in pieces: but it
was not San Bernardo, from what we afterwards saw. We did not find
anchoring ground at it, though the boats went on shore to search for
water, which we were in want of, but could not find any: they only
found some cocoa-nut trees though small. Our commander seeing we
wanted water, agreed that we should go to the island Santa Cruz,
where he had been with the adelantado Alvaro de Mendana, saying we
might there supply ourselves with water and wood, and then he would
determine what was most expedient for Your Majesty's service. The
crew of the <i>Capitana</i> at this time were mutinous, designing to
go directly to Manila: on this account he sent the chief pilot a
prisoner on board my ship, without doing anything further to him or
others, though I strongly importuned him to punish them or give me
leave to punish them; but he did not choose to do it, from whence
succeeded what Your Majesty knows, since they made him turn from the
course (voyage), as will be mentioned, and he has probably said at
Your Majesty's court.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 34}</u></p>

<p>We sailed from the above island W. by N., and found nearly a point
easterly variation. We continued this cource till in full 10&deg; S.
Latitude. In this situation we found a low island of five or six
leagues, overflowed and without soundings: it was inhabited, the
people and arms like those we had left, but their vessels were
different. They came close to the ship, talking to us and taking what
we gave them, begging more, and stealing what was hanging to the
ship, throwing lances, thinking we could do them no harm.</p>

<p>Seeing we could not anchor, on account of the want we were in of
water, our commander ordered me ashore with two boats and fifty men.
As soon as we came to the shore they opposed my entrance, without any
longer keeping peace, which obliged me to skirmish with them. When we
had done them some mischief, three of them came out to make peace
with me, singing, with branches in their hands, and one with a
lighted torch and on his knees. We received them well and embraced
them, and then cloathed them, for they were some of the chiefs; and
asking them for water they did not choose to show it me, making signs
as if they did not understand me. Keeping the three chiefs with me, I
ordered the sergeant, with twelve men, to search for water, and
having fallen in with it the Indians came out on their flank and
attacked them wounding one Spaniard. Seeing their treachery they were
attacked and defeated without other harm whatever. The land being in
my power, I went over the town without finding anything but dried
oysters and fish, and many cocoa-nuts, with which the land was well
provided. We found no birds nor animals except little dogs. They have
many covered embarcations, with which they are accustomed to navigate
to other islands, with latine sails made curiously of mats; and of
the same cloth their women are cloathed with little shifts and
petticoats, and the men only round their waists and hips. From hence
we put off with the boats loaded with water, but by the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 35}</u></p>

<p>great swell we were overset with much risk of our lives, and so we
were obliged to go on with out getting water at this island. We named
it Matanza.</p>

<p>We sailed in this parallel thirty-two days. In all this route we
had very strong currents, and many drifts of wood and snakes, and
many birds, all which were signs of land on both sides of us. We did
not search for it, that we might not leave the latitude of the island
of Santa Cruz, for we always supposed ourselves near it; and with
reason, if it had been where the first voyage when it was discovered
had represented; but it was much further on, as by the account will
be seen. So that about sixty leagues before reaching it, and 1940
from the city of Lima, we found a small island of six leagues very
high, and all round it very good soundings; and other small islands
near it, under shelter of which the ships anchored. I went with the
two boats and fifty men to reconnoitre the people of this island; and
at the distance of a musket shot separate from the island, we found a
town surrounded with a wall, with only one entrance, without a gate.
Being near with the two boats with an intention of investing them as
they did not by signs choose peace, at length their chief came into
the water up to his neck, with a staff in his hand, and without fear
came directly to the boats; where he was very well received, and by
signs which we very well understood, he told me that his people were
in great terror of the muskets, and therefore he entreated us not to
land, and said that they would bring water and wood if we gave them
vessels. I told him that it was necessary to remain five days on
shore to refresh. Seeing he could not do more with me he quieted his
people, who were very uneasy and turbulent, and so it happened that
no hostility was committed on either side. We went into the fort very
safely; and having halted, I made them give up their arms, and made
them bring from their houses their effects, which were not of any
value, and go with them to the island to other</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 36}</u></p>

<p>towns. They thanked me very much: the chief always continued with
me. They then told me the name of the country: all came to me to make
peace, and the chiefs assisted me, making their people get water and
wood and carry it on board the ships. In this we spent six days.</p>

<p>The people of this island are of an agreeable conversation,
understanding us very well, desirous of learning our language and to
teach us theirs. They are great cruizers: they have much beard; they
are great archers and hurlers of darts; the vessels in which they
sail are large, and can go a great way. They informed us of more than
forty islands, great and small, all peopled, naming them by names,
and telling us that they were at war with many of them. They also
gave us intelligence of the island Santa Cruz, and of what had
happened when the adelantado was there.</p>

<p>The people of this island are of ordinary stature: they have
amongst them people white and red, some in colour like those of the
Indies, others woolly-headed blacks and mulattoes. Slavery is in use
amongst them. Their food is yams, fish, cocoa-nuts, and they have
hogs and fowls.</p>

<p>This island is named Taomaco and the name of the chief, Tomai. We
departed from hence with four Indians whom we took, at which they
were not much pleased: and as we here got wood and water, there was
no necessity for us to go to the island Santa Cruz, which, as I have
said, is in this parallel sixty leagues further on.</p>

<p>So we sailed from hence, steering S.S.E. to 12&frac12;&deg; S.
latitude, where we found an island like that of Taomaco, and with the
same kind of people, named Chucupia: there is only one small
anchoring place; and passing in the offing, a small canoe with only
two men came to me to make peace, and presented me some bark of a
tree, which appeared like a very fine handkerchief, four yards long
and three palms wide: on this I parted from them.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 37}</u></p>

<p>From hence we steered south. We had a hard gale of wind from the
north, which obliged us to lye to for two days: at the end of that
time it was thought, as it was winter, that we could not exceed the
latitude of 14&deg; S., in which we were, although my opinion was
always directly contrary, thinking we should reach for the islands
named by the Indians of Taomaco. Wherefore sailing from this place we
steered west, and in one day's sail we discovered a volcano, very
high and large, above three leagues in circuit, full of trees, and of
black people with much beard.</p>

<p>To the westward, and in sight of this volcano, was an island not
very high and pleasant in appearance. There are few anchoring places,
and those very close to the shore: it was very full of black people.
Here we caught two in some canoes, whom we cloathed and gave them
presents, and the next day we put them on shore. In return for this
they shot a flight of arrows at a Spaniard, though in truth it was
not in the same port, but about a musket shot further on. They are,
however, a people that never miss an opportunity of doing
mischief.</p>

<p>In sight of this island and around it are many islands, very high
and large, and to the southward one so large that we stood for it,
naming the island where our man was wounded Santa Maria.</p>

<p>Sailing thence to the southward towards the large island, we
discovered a very large bay, well peopled, and very fertile in yams
and fruits, hogs and fowls. They are all black people and naked. They
fight with bows, darts and clubs. They did not choose to have peace
with us, though we frequently spoke to them and made presents; and
they never, with their goodwill, let us set foot on shore.</p>

<p>This bay is very refreshing, and in it fall many and large rivers.
It is in 15 2/3&deg; S. latitude, and in circuit it is twenty-five
leagues. We named it the bay de San Felipe y Santiago, and the land
del Espiritu Santo.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 38}</u></p>

<p>There we remained fifty days:<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> we
took possession in the name of Your Majesty. From within this bay,
and from the most sheltered part of it, the <i>Capitana</i> departed
at one hour past midnight, without giving any notice to us and
without making any signal. This happened the 11th of June, and
although the next morning we went out to seek for them; and made all
proper efforts, it was not possible for us to find them; for they did
not sail on the proper course, nor with good intention. So I was
obliged to return to the bay, to see if by chance they had returned
thither. And on the same account we remained in this bay 15 days; at
the end of which we took Your Majesty's orders, and held a
consultation with the officers of the frigate. It was determined that
we should fulfil them, although contrary to the inclination of many,
I may say, of the greater part; but my condition was different from
that of Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros.</p>

<p>At length we sailed from this bay, in conformity to the order,
although with intention to sail round this island, but the season and
the strong currents would not allow this, although I ran along a
great part of it. In what I saw, there are very large mountains. It
has many ports, though some of them very small. All of it is well
watered with rivers. We had at this time nothing but bread and water:
it was the height of winter, with sea, wind, and ill will (of his
crew) against us. 'All this did not prevent me from reaching the
mentioned latitude, which I passed one degree, and would have gone
farther if the weather had permitted; for the ship was good. It was
proper to act in this manner, for these are not voyages performed
every day, nor could Your Majesty otherwise be properly informed.
Going into the said latitude on a S.W. course, we had no signs of
land that way.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) This includes the time Torres remained in the bay
after the separation from Quiros.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 39}</u></p>

<p>From hence I stood back to the N.W. to 11&frac12;&deg; S.
latitude: there we fell in with the beginning of New Guinea, the
coast of which runs W. by N. and E. by S. I could not weather the
east point so I coasted along to the westward on the south side.</p>

<p>All this land of New Guinea is peopled with Indians, not very
white, and naked, except their waists, which are covered with a cloth
made of the bark of trees, and much painted. They fight with darts,
targets, and some stone clubs, which are made fine with plumage.
Along the coast are many islands and habitations. All the coast has
many ports, very large, with very large rivers, and many plains.
Without these islands there runs a reef of shoals, and between them
(the shoals) and the main land are the islands. There is a channel
within. In these ports I took possession for Your Majesty.</p>

<p>We went along three hundred leagues of coast as I have mentioned,
and diminished the latitude 2&frac12;&deg;, which brought us into
9&deg;. From hence we fell in with a bank of from three to nine
fathoms, which extends along the coast, above 180 leagues. We went
over it along the coast to 7&frac12;&deg; south latitude, and the end
of it is in 5&deg;. We could go no further on for the many shoals and
great currents, so we were obliged to sail out S.W. in that depth to
11&deg; S. latitude. There is all over it an archipelago of islands
without number, by which we passed, and at the end of the eleventh
degree the bank became shoaler. Here were very large islands, and
there appeared more to the southward: they were inhabited by black
people, very corpulent and naked: their arms were lances, arrows, and
clubs of stone ill-fashioned. We could not get any of their arms. We
caught in all this land twenty persons of different nations, that
with them we might be able to give a better account to Your Majesty.
They give much notice of other people, although as yet they do not
make themselves well understood.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 40}</u></p>

<p>We went upon this bank for two months, at the end of which time we
found ourselves in 25 fathoms and in 5&deg; S. latitude and ten
leagues from the coast. And having gone 480 leagues, here the coast
goes to the N.E. I did not reach it, for the bank became very
shallow. So we stood to the north, and in twenty-five fathoms to
4&deg; latitude, where we fell in with a coast, which likewise lay in
a direction east and west. We did not see the eartern termination,
but from what we understood of it, it joins the other we had left on
account of the bank, the sea being very smooth. This land is peopled
by blacks, different from all the others: they are better adorned:
they use arrows, darts, and large shields and some sticks of bamboo
filled with lime with which, by throwing it out, they blind their
enemies. Finally, we stood to the W.N.W. along the Coast, always
finding this people, for we landed in many places: also in it we took
possession for Your Majesty. In this land also we found iron, china
bells, and other things, by which we knew we were near the Malucas
and so we ran along this coast above 130 leagues, where it comes to a
termination fifty leagues before you reach the Molucas. There is an
infinity of islands to the southward and very large which for the
want of provisions we did not approach, for I doubt if in ten years
could be examined the coasts of all the islands we descried. We
observed the variation in all this land of New Guinea to the Molucas;
and in all of it the variation agrees with the meridian of the
Ladrone Islands and of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>At the termination of this land we found Mahometans, who were
cloathed and had firearms and swords. They sold us fowls, goats,
fruit and some pepper, and biscuit which they called sagoe, which
will keep more than twenty years. The whole they sold us was but
little; for they wanted cloth, and we had not any; for all the things
that had been given us for traffic were carried away by the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 41}</u></p>

<p><i>Capitana</i>, even to tools and medicines, and many other
things which I do not mention, as there is no help for it; but,
without them, God took care of us.</p>

<p>These Moors gave us news of the events at the Malucas, and told us
of Dutch ships though none of them came here although they said that
in all this land there was much gold and other good things, such as
pepper and nutmegs. For hence to the Malucas it is all islands, and
on the south side are many uniting with those of Banda and Amboyna,
where the Dutch carry on a trade. We came to the islands of Bachian,
which are the first Malucas, where we found a <i>Theatine</i>, with
about one hundred Christians in the country of a Mahometan king
friendly to us, who begged me to subdue one of the Ternate islands
inhabited by revolted Mahometans, to whom Don pedro de Acunha had
given pardon in Your Majesty's name, which I had maintained; and I
sent advice to the M. de Campo, Juan de Esquivel, who governed the
islands of Ternate, of my arrival, and demanded if it was expedient
to give this assistance to the king of Bachian, to which he (Juan de
Esquivel) answered that it would be of great service to Your Majesty
if I brought force for that purpose. On this, with forty Spaniards
and four hundred Moors of the king of Bachian, I made war, and in
only four days I defeated them and took the fort, and put the king of
Bachian in possession of it in Your Majesty's name, to whom we
administered the usual oaths, stipulating with him that he should
never go to war against Christians, and that he should ever be a
faithful vassal to Your Majesty. I did not find these people of so
intrepid a spirit as those we had left.</p>

<p>It must be ascribed to the Almighty that, in all these labours and
victories, we lost only one Spaniard. I do not make a relation of
them to Your Majesty, for I hope to give it at large.</p>

<p>The king being put in possession, I departed for Ternate, which
was twelve leagues from this island, where Juan de</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 42}</u></p>

<p>Esquivel was, by whom I was well received; for he had great
scarcity of people, and the nations of Ternate were in rebellion, and
assistance to him was very unexpected in so roundabout a way.</p>

<p>In a few days afterwards arrived succour from Manila, which was
much desired, for half of the people left by Don Pedro de Acunha were
no more, and there was a scarcity of provisions, for, as I said, the
nations of the island were in rebellion; but by the prudence of the
M. de Campo, Juan de Esquivel, he went on putting the affairs of the
island in good order, although he was in want of money.</p>

<p>I left the <i>Patache</i> here and about twenty men, as it was
expedient for the service of Your Majesty. From hence I departed for
the city of Manila, where they gave me so bad a dispatch, as I have
mentioned; and hitherto, which is now two months, they have not given
provisions to the crew; and so I know not when I can sail hence to
give account to Your Majesty.</p>

BATAVIA; COMMENCING JANUARY THE 15TH, 1644, AND ENDING NOVEMBER THE
29TH FOLLOWING.</h3>

<h4>TO BE FOUND FOLIO 39.</h4>

<p>Instructions for the commodore, Captain Abel Jansz Tasman, the
skipper chief-pilot, Franz Jacobsz Visser, and the counsel of the
yachts <i>Limmen</i> and <i>Zeemeuw</i>, and the tender <i>de
Brak</i>, destined for a nearer discovery of New Guinea and the
unknown coasts of the discovered east and south lands, together with
the channels and the islands supposed to be situated between and near
them.</p>

<p>The several successive administrations of India, in order to
enlarge and extend the trade of the Dutch East India company, have
zealously endeavoured to make an early discovery of the great land of
New Guinea and other unknown east and southerly countries, as you
know by several discourses, and maps, journals, and papers
communicated to you. But hitherto with little success, although
several voyages have been undertaken.</p>

<p>1st. By order of the president, John Williamson Verschoor, who at
that time directed the company's trade at Bantam, which was in the
year 1606, with the yacht the <i>Duyfhen</i>, who in their passage
sailed by the islands Key and Aroum, and discovered the south and
west coast of New Guinea for about 220 miles (880) from 5&deg; to
13&frac34;&deg; south latitude: and found this extensive country, for
the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 44}</u></p>

<p>greater part desert, but in some places inhabited by wild, cruel
black savages, by whom some of the crew were murdered; for which
reason they could not learn anything of the land or waters, as had
been desired of them, and by want of provisions and other necessaries
they were obliged to leave the discovery unfinished: the furthest
point of the land was called in their map Cape Keer-Weer<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, situated in 13&frac34;&deg; South.</p>

<p>The second voyage was undertaken with a yacht in the year 1617 by
order of the Fiscal D'Edel, with little success, of which adventures
and discoveries, through the loss of their journals and remarks,
nothing certain is to be found.</p>

<p>From this time the further discoveries of the unknown east and
south countries were postponed until the year 1623 on account of
there being no ships to spare; but in the interim, in the year 1619,
a ship named the <i>Arms of Amsterdam</i>, destined to Banda, drove
past that place and touched at the south coast of New Guinea, where
some of the crew were murdered by the savage inhabitants, wherefore
they acquired no certain knowledge of the country.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, in the years 1616, 1618, 1619 and 1622, the
west coast of this great unknown south land from 35&deg; to 22&deg;
S. latitude was discovered by outward bound ships, and among them by
the ship <i>Endraght</i>; for the nearer discovery of which the
governor-general, Jan Pietersz Coen (of worthy memory) in September,
1622, despatched the yachts <i>De Haring</i> and <i>Harewind</i>; but
this voyage was rendered abortive by meeting the ship
<i>Mauritius</i>, and searching after the ship <i>Rotterdam</i>.</p>

<p>In consequence of which, by order of His excellency, the third
voyage was undertaken in the month of January 1623, with the yachts
<i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i> out of Amboina, under the command of
Jan Carstens; with order to make a nearer friendship with the
inhabitants of the islands Key, Aroum,</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Cape Turn-again]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 45}</u></p>

<p>and Tenimber, and better to discover New Guinea and the south
lands, when an alliance was made with the said islands and south
coast of New Guinea nearer discovered. The skipper, with eight of the
crew of the yacht <i>Arnhem</i>, was treacherously murdered by the
inhabitants; and after a discovery of the great islands Arnhem and
the Spult (by an untimely Separation) this yacht, with very little
success, came back to Amboina.</p>

<p>But the yacht <i>Pera</i>, persisting in the voyage, sailed along
the south coast of New Guinea to a flat cove on this coast, situated
in 10&deg; south latitude, and ran along the west coast of this land
to Cape Keer-Weer, from thence discovered the coast farther southward
as far as 17&deg; South to Staten River (from this place what more of
the land could be discerned seemed to stretch westward) and from
thence returned to Amboina.</p>

<p>In this discovery were found everywhere shallow water and barren
coast; islands altogether thinly peopled by divers cruel, poor, and
brutal nations, and of very little use to the Company. Countries may
be seen on the maps which were made of them.</p>

<p>Through the little success of this third voyage, but mostly
because no ships could be spared, the discovery was again omitted
until 1636, but in the interim, in the year 1627, the south coast of
the great south land was accidentally discovered by the ship <i>Gulde
Zeepard</i>, outward bound from Fatherland<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, for the space of 250 miles (1000) and again
accidentally in the year following, 1628, on the north side in the
latitude of 21&deg; South, by the ship <i>Vianen</i>, homeward bound
from India when they coasted about 50 miles (200) without gaining any
particular knowledge of this great country, only observing a foul and
barren shore, green fields</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The expressive epithet both of the Dutch and Germans
for their native country.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 46}</u></p>

<p>and very wild, black, barbarous inhabitants; all which, by the
loss of the ship <i>Batavia</i> and the cruelties and miseries which
followed from that, if fully proved, and was experienced by the crew
of the yacht <i>Sardam</i>, in their course along this coast.</p>

<p>At last the fourth voyage was undertaken (in our government) in
the month of April 1636 from Banda with the yachts <i>Clyn
Amsterdam</i> and <i>Wesel</i>, under the command of Gerrit Tomasz
Pool for the discovery of the east and south lands; when they first
discovered the coast of New Guinea in 3&frac12;&deg; south latitude,
and coasted about sixty miles (240) to the eastward to 5&deg; South,
when the commodore Pool, with three of the crew (by the barbarous
inhabitants) was murdered at the same place where the skipper of that
yacht <i>Arnhem</i> was killed in the year 1623.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which the voyage was assiduously continued under
the supercargo Pieter Pietersz and, the islands Key and Arnoum
visited by very strong easterly winds, they could not reach the west
coast to New Guinea but, shaping their course very near south,
described the coast of Arnhem or Van Diemen's Land in 11&deg; south
latitude, and sailed along the coast for 30 miles (120) without
seeing any people, but many signs of smoke; when, turning towards the
north, they visited the unknown islands of Timor Laut<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> and the known islands of Tenimber, Kauwer,
etc., but without ever being able to converse with the inhabitants
who were a very timid people when, after three months cruising, they
returned in July to Banda, without (in this voyage) having done or
discovered anything of consequence; which may be seen by the journals
and maps.</p>

<p>After the little success in these voyages nothing further</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The word "laut" means south, but is erroneously
spelt in the original translation "landt." A similar blunder has been
abundantly repeated on the maps of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries in the name of "Laut Chidol," the Southern Sea, there spelt
constantly Lantchidol.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 47}</u></p>

<p>was attempted on discovery to the eastward, but last year (under
your direction) the discovery of the remaining unknown south lands
was assiduously reattempted; and in that remarkable voyage was that
great unknown Staten<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> and Van
Diemen's Land discovered from 35 to 43&deg; south latitude, and at
the same time the (so long wished for) passage to the South Sea, but
it is unnecessary to relate more here as you are perfectly acquainted
with all particulars.</p>

<p>But to obtain a thorough knowledge of these extensive countries,
the discovery whereof has been begun (in consequence of the intention
of the Company and the recommendation of our masters) now only
remains for the future to discover whether New Guinea is one
continent with that great south land, or separated by channels and
islands lying between them; and also whether that New Van Diemen's
Land is the same continent with these two great countries or with one
of them or, if separated from them, what islands may be dispersed
between New Guinea and the unknown south land when, after more
experience and knowledge of all the said known and unknown countries,
we shall be better enabled for further undertakings.</p>

<p>After considering all that is above related and, by our estimate
of the present strength of the Company's naval forces, it is found
that, without prejudice to the ordinary trading and warlike
expeditions, two or three yachts could be spared, it is therefore
resolved in the Council of India to equip the yachts <i>Limmen</i>,
the <i>Zeemeuw</i>, and the <i>Brak</i> for the further discovery of
the east and south lands to furnish them well with all necessaries,
and commit them to your conduct, in confidence that you will with
courage, vigilance, prudence, good order, and the requisite
perseverance, skilfully direct this important voyage in such a manner
as to be capable to give an account on your return fully to our
contentment.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) New Zealand]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 48}</u></p>

<p>1st. You shall early tomorrow morning, after mustering your men,
proceed to sea in company and steer a course to Macassar, Amboina,
and Banda, as the service of the Company shall require, and by
separate instructions you are commanded, by which you are entirely to
regulate your voyage to the above places.</p>

<p>On your arrival at Amboina and Banda you shall plentifully stock
your yachts with water, fuel, and all other necessaries; in the time
you are there the crews are to be supplied with all sorts of fresh
provisions, and well provided for the voyage, for which purpose this
shall be an order to the vice-governors<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> Gerrit Demmer and Cornelis Witzen, to whom
you have to communicate your instructions and demand in writing the
further knowledge they may have of the countries situated to the east
of Banda; and particularly the journal of the commodore Carstens,
which we think may still be found there, and be of some service to
you on the voyage.</p>

<p>But by this we by no means intend you shall spend time
unprofitably, but despatch everything so assiduously that you may
leave Banda in the latter end of February, when the west monsoon had
set in, fixing, with the advice of the council, instructions for the
signals at the beginning of your voyage, in which particularly is to
be inserted by what method the yachts may join, in case (which God
prevent) they by storm or other accidents were separated, upon which
the good success of the intended voyage chiefly depends.</p>

<p>After fulfilling your orders at Amboina and Banda you shall (as is
mentioned) in the latter end of February (or sooner if possible)
undertake in the name of God the voyage you are ordered upon, and
steer your course eastward between and in view of the islands
Tenimber, Key, and</p>

<blockquote>[*) At that time the governor-general, in instructions or
issuing orders, styled all the other governors,
<i>vice-governors</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 49}</u></p>

<p>Aroum, to the point True or False Cape situated in 8&deg; on the
south of New Guinea; from which place you are to continue eastward
along the coast till 9&deg; south latitude, crossing prudently the
cove at that place looking about the high island or Spelut's River
with the yachts for a harbour, and to inspect into the state of the
country; dispatching the tender <i>Brak</i> for two or three days
into the cove in order to discover whether within the great inlet
there is not to be found an entrance into the South Sea which soon
may be determined by the current of the streams. From this place you
are to coast along the west coast of New Guinea to the farthest
discoveries in 170&deg; South latitude, following this coast farther
as it may run west of southward.</p>

<p>But it is to be feared you will meet in these parts with
South-East trade-winds, by which it will be difficult to keep the
coast on board, if stretching to the South-East, but notwithstanding
this endeavour by all means to proceed, by reason that we may be sure
whether this land is divided from the great known south continent or
not, which by the great and slow swell from the South-East may well
be perceived; in which case you shall try (if possible) to run so far
to the South-East as the New Van Diemen's Land, and from thence to
the islands of St. Peter and St. Francois, to learn the situation of
these to the northward, and at the same time to be assured (which is
much wished for) a passage to the South Sea between them and the
known south land, which found (as we presume and hope) you ought,
returning through the discovered passage, to steer along the east
coast of the known south land according to its trending, following
its direction to the westward to De Wit's Land and William's River in
22&deg; south latitude, when the known south land would be entirely
circumnavigated and discovered to be the largest island of the
globe.</p>

<p>But if (as we presume) the land of New Guinea is joined to the
south land and in consequence is one continent, you</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 50}</u></p>

<p>will be enabled by the South-East trade-wind to run along the
north coast from 17 to 22&deg; South, and this entirely to discover
this land from whence (if wind and weather by any means will permit)
you shall steer along the land of De Eendragt to Houtman's Abrolhos,
and come to an anchor at a fit place thereabout; and endeavour to
find a chest containing eight thousand rix dollars that remained in
the wreck of the ship <i>Batavia</i>, a brass half cartow<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*]</b> having fallen on that chest when it foundered
at that place in the year 1629, and which the crew of the yacht
<i>Sardam</i> dragged for in vain. At the same time you shall (if
possible) recover that piece, by this you will render service to the
Company, for which reason be not negligent in the discharge of your
duty.</p>

<p>Likewise inquire at the continent thereabout after two Dutchmen
who, having forfeited their lives, were put on shore by the commodore
Francois Pelsart, if still alive, in which case you may make your
inquiries of them about the situation of these countries, and if they
entreat you to that purpose give them passage hither; on this
occasion you ought to search for a good water and refreshing place
about the 26 or 28&deg; South latitude, which would be a desirable
thing for the outwardbound ships.</p>

<p>But if the late time of the year and the appearance of storms will
not permit you to reach Houtman's Shoal which, after experience, we
leave to yours and the council's own judgment, consider how you have
to sail again from William's River to the east, along the coast of
the south land and from De Wit's Land, by the help of the South-East
trade-wind, to run across very near eastward to complete the
discovery of Arnhem's and Van Diemen's Lands; and to ascertain
perfectly whether these lands are not one and the same island, and
what these places produce; likewise what other islands besides Baly,
Sumbava, and Timor may be situated about the south land.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Or 24-pounder. (Note in Dalrymple.)]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 51}</u></p>

<p>After all this (by the help of God) shall be fortunately
transacted, which we hope can be done before the end of the month of
June (having either reached Houtman's Abrolhos or Van Diemen's Land)
you have to steer your course to the south coast of Java, and along
the coast through the Strait of Sunda to return to Batavia: at which
place we shall expect you in July following attended with good
success.</p>

<p>Of all the lands, countries, islands, capes, points or coves,
inlets, bays, rivers, shoals, reefs, sands, cliffs, rocks, etc.,
which you meet with and pass in this discovery, as well upon the
coast of New Guinea and the south land, as in the Indian Ocean and
inland seas, you are to make accurate maps and circumstantial
descriptions and to draw perfectly the views and from, for which
purpose a draughtsman is to go along with you.</p>

<p>Be particularly careful about longitude and latitude, in what
direction and at what distances all coasts, islands, capes, points,
bays and rivers are situated from one and the other, and what are the
marks by which they may be known, as mountains, hills, trees, or
buildings to be seen thereupon.</p>

<p>Take a thorough survey of the depth of the water near the shore
and of the sunken rocks, the rapid current of the rivers at the
points, how and by what marks they are to be avoided, and if the
bottom is hard, soft, sharp, flat, sloping, or steep, and if they may
be approached or not, by the soundings; upon what marks the best
anchoring places in harbours and bays are to be found, how the inlets
and rivers are to be entered, what winds usually blow in the
different parts; the course of the streams, whether ebb and flood are
regulated by the moon or wind; what alterations of monsoon, rains or
dry weather you experience; and observed farther diligently to remark
and note down (which is the duty of all able pilots) whatever may be
of service in future voyages to the discovered countries.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 52}</u></p>

<p>The time of the year will doubtless not permit, by the shortening
of the days, to lose any time, but carefully and diligently to
proceed; for the above reason it is consequence to discover as much
and in as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless to discover in a proper manner the coasts of the
east, and south land, it will be necessary in good time now and then
to anchor in proper places, always looking for and choosing such bays
and harbours as with the least danger may be entered and left, where
you may lie in safety, and which by accidental winds or for other
reasons you may soon quit.</p>

<p>But be particularly careful, circumspect and prudent in landing
with small craft, because (as above-mentioned) at several times New
Guinea has been found to be inhabited by cruel wild savages and, as
it is uncertain what sort of people the inhabitants of the south
lands are, it may rather be presumed that they are also wild and
barbarous savages than a civilised people, for which reason you ought
always to be upon your guard and well armed; because in all countries
of the globe experience has taught us no savages are to be trusted,
by reason they always suppose people who appear so unexpectedly and
strangely to them are only come to invade their country; all which is
proved in the discovery of America and the Indies, by the surprise
and murdering many careless and unwary discoverers, many times to the
ruin of their voyages.</p>

<p>When you meet and converse with any of these savages behave well
and friendly to them; do not take notice of little affronts or thefts
which they practice upon you, because resentment might create
disgust; but try by all means to engage their affection to you, the
better to learn from them the state of their country, particularly if
any thing for the service of the company may be done there.</p>

<p>You are also to inquire as much as time will permit into</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 53}</u></p>

<p>the productions of their country, the fruits and animals, the
buildings, the shape and faces of the people, their clothing, arms,
morals, manners, food, trade, religion, government, war, and
everything worthy of remark; particularly whether they are peaceable
or malicious.</p>

<p>You are to show the samples of the goods which you carry along
with you, to inquire what materials and goods they possess, and what
is wanted of ours; all which you are closely to observe, well to
annotate, and correctly to describe; for which reason you are to keep
a very circumstantial journal wherein all particulars may be
perfectly inserted, by which upon your return you may give a
satisfactory report to us.</p>

<p>If any country be discovered peopled by a civilised nation (as
apparently will not be the case) you may depend more upon them than
upon the wild savages; try to converse with their governors and
subjects, and to establish an acquaintance; inform them you come
there to trade, show them the goods in proper order; for this purpose
laden on board both the yachts and the tender, amounting to the sum
of 2809 guilders, 17 stivers, and three penningen, of all which the
junior merchants have to keep books in proper order, by which they
(when called upon) may be enabled to give a satisfactory account.</p>

<p>Showing the samples and goods, you and the junior merchants are
carefully to remark what good the strange nations most esteem and to
which they are most inclined; likewise inquire what merchants and
goods they possess, particularly after gold and silver, and whether
these metals are held in great esteem; to keep them ignorant of the
precious value seem not greedily after it; if they offer to barter
for your goods seem not to convert these minerals, but show them
copper, tutenag<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, pewter and lead, as
if these were of more value to us. If you find them inclined to trade
keep the</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Zinc.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 54}</u></p>

<p>goods which they seem most greedy after at so high a value that
none may be sold nor bartered without great profit, likewise take
nothing but what you are convinced will turn out profitable to the
Company, which in trading you will learn. It will be particularly
necessary to bring samples of the most rare things to be found there,
and of all the rest exact account, to see what return from thence can
be made, and for the future may be serviceable.</p>

<p>You are prudently to prevent all insolences and maltreatment of
the ship's crew against the discovered nations, and to take care by
no means to insult them in their houses, gardens, ships, possessions,
nor women, etc. Likewise not to carry away any inhabitant against
their will, but if a few voluntarily should be inclined to go along
with you then you are permitted to bring them to this place.</p>

<p>We have here expressed in general our intentions respecting a
voyage you are to undertake but, as upon all that may occur no
precise orders can be given, we leave the rest to your zeal,
vigilance and good conduct, likewise to the council's prudent
dispositions, in a full hope and confidence you will in this
expedition be so vigilant as to succeed to the service of the
Company, when we will not be backward to recompense your endeavours
as you may merit; for if in this voyage are discovered any countries,
islands or passages profitable to the Company we promise you by this
to reward the conductors and well-behaving ships' crew with such
premiums as we shall find their good service to have merited, upon
which you all may depend. Likewise you are to fix a competent premium
to those who first shall perceive an unknown country, island, shoal,
rock, or dangerous foul ground, in order to avoid as much as possible
all misfortunes.</p>

<p>To prevent any other European nation from reaping (perhaps) the
fruits of our labour and expenses in these discoveries you are
everywhere to take possession, in the name</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 55}</u></p>

<p>and by the orders of the Dutch East India Company, of the
countries and islands you may arrive at not inhabited by savages; to
put up some signs, for instance, plant trees, sow some fruit trees,
erect a stone or post, and to cut or carve in them the arms of the
Netherlands or of the Company, and in what year and at what time such
a land was discovered and taken in possession, declaring further in
intention by the first opportunity to send people thither from hence,
and to establish a colony to secure the property near to us.</p>

<p>But if it happens (which is not unlikely) that you discover some
countries or islands that may have a polished government you are to
endeavour with its chiefs or governors (in the name as above) to make
contract upon the most advantageous terms you possibly can obtain,
including a resignation (if they are inclined to do such) or
permission to frequent the place exclusive of all other nations; or
other advantages for the Company; all which you must note down
circumstantially in your journals, expressing the names and qualities
of those whom you shall have treated, to serve the Company when it
may be wanted.</p>

<p>In order this dangerous voyage, according to these instructions
and our good intentions, may be well regulated and finished, good
order kept among the crew, right and justice administered conformable
to the general articles; and everything (which upon so dangerous and
long a voyage may happen to be required) be done and transacted to
the greatest service of the Company; we appoint by this the
Honourable Abel Jansz Tasman commodore of the three yachts and the
crew which sail with them; we authorise him to hoist the pendant on
board the yacht <i>Limmen</i>, to assemble the council, and whereof
he is to be constantly president: command in consequence the
officers, soldiers and sailors (nobody excepted) appointed upon the
yachts <i>Limmen</i>, <i>De Zeemeuw</i>, and <i>De Brak</i>, to
acknowledge and obey</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 56}</u></p>

<p>him as their chief and commander; to support him by good advice
and assiduity, to the forwarding of the voyage and the ordered
discovery of the unknown countries, as is the duty of vigilant and
faithful servants, in such a manner as, upon return, everyone may be
able to answer.</p>

<pre>
The council of the three yachts shall consist of the following persons:--

The commodore           Abel Jansz Tasman    Constantly President
The skipper chief pilot Francois Jacobs,     of the Limmen
The skipper             Dirk Cornelisz Haan) of the Zeemeuw
Supercargo              Isaac Gissmans     )
The skipper             Jasper Jansz Koops   of the Brak.

Cornelis Robol          First mate           of the Brak
The junior merchant     Anthony Blauw        as councillor or secretary

</pre>

<p>By this council shall all occurring business towards forwarding
the voyage, fulfilling our orders, and administering of justice, be
concluded upon and transacted: if it so happen there is an equal
number of votes the commodore is to have two votes; but in cases of
navigation and discovery of countries the second mates shall also
assist with advising votes, all which the commodore shall collect,
and determine by the majority of the concluding votes, taking care to
have all resolutions instantly truly registered and strictly complied
with the service of the Company.</p>

<p>In the council of each particular yacht the junior merchant or
bookkeeper and high boatswains shall be called as directed in the
orders of our masters.</p>

<p>If the commodore Tasman (which God forbid) should decease such a
person shall succeed him as in our sealed act is nominated, which in
every respect conformable to this instruction in manner his
predecessor commanded, and (as is right) he shall be obeyed.</p>

John's son; Cornelisz, Cornelius's son, etc.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 57}</u></p>

<p>The yachts are manned with 111 persons, and amongst them one
officer and 16 soldiers. Namely:</p>

<pre>
In the Limmen:  45 sailors, 11 soldiers; in all 56 persons.
In the Zeemeuw: 35 sailors,  6 soldiers; in all 41 persons.
In the Brak:    14 sailors,  0 soldiers; in all 14 persons.
                -------------------------------------------
                94 sailors, 17 soldiers: total 111 persons.
</pre>

<p>All well provided with all necessary ammunition, tools, and
utensils, and for eight months plentifully victualled. Manage
everything well and orderly, take notice you see the ordinary portion
of two meat and two pork days, and a quarter of vinegar, a half
quarter of sweet oil per week, and a half quarter of arrack per day
regularly distributed. Each yacht carries a leaguer and 120 quarts of
strong arrack (the Brak is provided from the <i>Zeemeuw</i>) which
must be carefully distributed in the cold climate for the health of
the people. Notwithstanding you are plentifully stocked with
waterbuts manage particularly fresh water and fuel to prevent wanting
it; as you would then be obliged to search after it, to the retarding
of your voyage, or return without success, to your shame and the
great detriment of the Company, which has been at great expense in
equipping these yachts; and for these reasons, by industry and
prudence, ought to be prevented from suffering.</p>

<p>We give then no further instruction and leave to your and the
council's good conduct and advice what you will have more to do upon
this voyage; only recommending seriously in all emergencies to use
such prudence as may keep the Company's valuable ships and people out
of all dangers as much as can be done. For the better to answer this
purpose we do not approve the commodore much to leave shipboard, but
to stay in the yacht, unless (with advice of the council) the
Company's service may require the contrary in order to avoid the
object being neglected by any unforeseen misfortune in this important
voyage.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 58}</u></p>

<p>To conclude this instruction we wish you the protection and
blessings of Omnipotence, which we pray to inspire you with manly
courage for the intended discoveries, and after finishing to return
in safety, to the expanding of His glory, reputation to the mother
country, the service of the Company, our contentment, and to your own
everlasting honour.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-05"></a>THE VOYAGE AND SHIPWRECK OF CAPTAIN FRANCIS
PELSART, IN THE BATAVIA, ON THE COAST OF NEW HOLLAND, AND HIS
SUCCEEDING ADVENTURES.</h3>

<p>The Directors of the East India Company, encouraged by the
successful return of the five ships of General Carpenter richly laden
caused eleven vessels to be equipped the very same year 1628, for the
same voyage: amongst which, there was one ship called the
<i>Batavia</i>, commanded by Captain Francis Pelsart. He sailed from
the Texel on the 28th of October, 1628; and as it would be tedious to
the reader to give him a long account of a passage so well known as
that to the Cape of Good Hope, I shall pass over in silence that
portion of his journal, and content myself with observing, that on
the 4th of June in the following year, 1629, this vessel the
<i>Batavia</i> being separated from the fleet in a storm, was driven
on some rocks which lie in the latitude of 28&deg; south, and which
are called by the Dutch the Abrolhos of Frederick Houtman. Captain
Pelsart, who was sick in bed when this accident happened, perceived
at once that his ship had struck. It was night indeed; but the moon
shone very brightly, and the weather was fair. He immediately ran
upon deck, and found that all the sails were set; their course was
north-east by north; and the sea appeared covered with a white froth
as far as the eye could reach. He summoned the master, and charged
him with the loss of the ship; who excused himself by saying, he had
taken all the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 60}</u></p>

<p>care he could; and that, having discerned the froth at a distance,
he asked his shipmate, what he thought of it; who told him, that this
whiteness was occasioned by the rays of the moon. The captain then
asked him what was to be done; and in what part of the world they
were. The master replied, that God only knew that, and that the ship
was on an unknown reef. They sounded, and found eighteen feet of
water abaft, and much less foreward. They immediately agreed to throw
their cannon overboard, in hopes that, when the ship was lightened
she might be brought to float again. They dropped an anchor, however;
but meanwhile there arose a storm of wind and rain, which soon
convinced them of the danger they were in; for, being surrounded with
rocks and shoals, the ship was perpetually striking.</p>

<p>They then resolved to cut away the mainmast, which they did, but
this increased the shock; for though they cut the mast close by the
board, they could not get it clear, because it was much entangled
with the rigging. They could see no land, except an island, which, as
far as they could judge, was at about the distance of three leagues,
and two smaller islands, or rather rocks, which lay nearer. The
master was sent to examine them. He returned about nine in the
morning, and reported that the sea, at high water did not cover them;
but that the coast was so rocky and full of shoals, that it would be
very difficult to land upon them. They resolved, however, to run the
risk, and to send most of their company on shore, to pacify the
women, children, sick people, and such as were out of their wits with
fear, whose cries and noise served only to disturb them. They put
these on board their shallop and skiff; and about ten o'clock in the
morning, they perceived that their vessel began to break. They
redoubled their exertions to get up their bread upon deck, but they
did not take the same care of the water, not reflecting, in the
extremity of their danger, that</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 61}</u></p>

<p>they might be much distressed for want of it on shore; but what
embarrassed them most was the brutal behaviour of some of the crew
who made themselves so drunk with the wine upon which no check was
now kept that they were able to make only three trips that day, in
which they landed one hundred and eighty persons, twenty barrels of
bread, and some small casks water. The master returned on board
towards evening, and told the captain, that it was of no use to send
more provisions on shore, for the crew only wasted those they had
already. Pelsart then went in the shallop to put things in some
order, and discovered there was no water to be found upon the island.
He endeavoured to return to the ship, in order to bring off a supply,
together with the most valuable part of their cargo; but a storm
suddenly arising, he was forced to return.</p>

<p>The whole of the fifth day of the month was spent in removing the
water, and some of the merchandise, on shore; and afterwards, the
captain in the skiff and the master in the shallop endeavoured to
return to the vessel, but found the sea running so high, that it was
impossible to get on board. In this extremity the carpenter threw
himself out of the ship, and swam to them in order to inform them to
what hardships those left in the vessel were reduced; and he was sent
back, with orders for them to make rafts, by tying the planks
together, and endeavour on these, to reach the shallop and the skiff;
but before this could be done, the weather became so rough, that the
captain was obliged to return, leaving, with the utmost grief, his
lieutenant and seventy men on the very point of perishing on board
the vessel. Those who had reached the little island were not in much
better condition; for, upon taking an account of the water, they
found they had not above eighty pints for forty people; and on the
larger island, where there were one hundred and eighty, the stock was
still less. Those who were on the little island began to murmur, and
to complain of their</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 62}</u></p>

<p>officers, because they did not go in search of water on the
neighbouring islands; and they represented the necessity of this to
Captain Pelsart, who yielded to their remonstrances, but told them
that before he went, he wished to communicate this resolution to the
rest of the people. It was with difficulty that he gained their
consent to this, for the master was afraid that the other party would
keep the captain with them. At length they consented, but not till
the captain had declared, that without the consent of the company on
the large island that he should go in search of water, he would,
rather than leave them, perisn on board his ship. When he got near to
the island, he who commanded the boat told the captain, that if he
had anything to say, he must call out to the people; for that they
would not suffer him to go out of the boat; the captain then
attempted to throw himself overboard, in order to swim to the island;
but he was prevented, and the order was given to pull off from the
shore. Thus he was obliged to return, having first left these words
written on a leaf of a tablet, that he was gone in the skiff to look
for water in the nearest country or islands that he could find.</p>

<p>They first sought along the coasts of the islands and certainly
found water in the holes of the rocks, but the sea had dashed into
it, and rendered it unfit for use; they therefore determined to seek
farther on. They made a deck to their boat, as it would have been
impracticable to navigate those seas in an open vessel. A few more of
the crew joined themselves to the company for the same purpose; and
after the captain had obtained the signatures of his people to that
resolution, they immediately put to sea, having first taken an
observation, by which they found themselves in latitude 28&deg; 13'
south. A short time afterwards, they had sight of the continent,
which appeared, according to their estimation, to lie about sixteen
miles north by west from the place where they had suffered shipwreck.
They found the water</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 63}</u></p>

<p>about twenty-five or thirty fathoms deep; and, as night drew on,
kept out to sea, standing in for the land again after midnight. On
the morning of the 9th (of June) they found themselves according to
their reckoning, about three miles from the shore; this day they made
four or five miles by many tacks, sailing sometimes north, sometimes
west, the coast lying north-quarter-west, the coast appearing low,
naked and excessively rocky, being nearly of the same height as that
near Dover. At last they saw a little creek, with sandy bottom, into
which they were anxious to enter, but upon approaching it, they found
that the sea ran high, and the weather becoming more threatening,
they were obliged to haul off the coast.</p>

<p>On the 10th, they remained in the same parts, tacking first on one
side and then on the other, but the sea being still rough they
determined to abandon their shallop, and even to throw a part of the
bread which remained in the vessel overboard, since it hindered them
from clearing themselves of the water, which the vessel made upon
every side. It rained much that night, and afforded them hopes that
their people who remained upon the islands would derive great relief
therefrom. On the eleventh day, the wind, which was west-south-west,
began to sink, and they steered their course towards the north, for
the sea, which still ran high, obliged them to keep at a distance
from the land.</p>

<p>On the 12th, they made an observation by which they found
themselves in the latitude of 27&deg;. The wind being south-east,
they bordered the coast, but were unable to land on account of its
steepness, there being no creek or low land, in advance of the rocks
as is usually found on sea coasts. From a distance, the country
appeared fertile and full of vegetation. On the 13th, they found
themselves by observation in the latitude of 25&deg; 40'; by which
they discovered that the current had carried them towards the north,
and over against an opening, the coast lying to the north-east.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 64}</u></p>

<p>This day their course lay towards the north, but the coast
presented one continuous rock of red colour, and of an equal height,
without any land in advance and the waves broke against it with such
force that it was impossible for them to land.</p>

<p>The wind blew very fresh on the morning of the 14th but towards
noon it became calm, the latitude being 24&deg;, and the wind at
east, but the tide still carried them farther north than they
desired, for their design was to make a descent as soon as possible;
with which view they sailed slowly along the coast, till, perceiving
smoke at a distance, they rowed towards the spot from whence it
proceeded, hoping to find inhabitants, and consequently water. They
found the coast steep, full of rocks, and the sea very high, which
caused them to lose all hope of effecting a landing. At length, six
of the men, trusting to their skill in swimming, threw themselves
into the sea, and at last, with much trouble and danger they reached
the shore the boat remaining at anchor in twenty-five fathoms of
water. These men passed the entire day in seeking for water; and,
whilst thus employed, they perceived four men, who approached them
upon all-fours; but one of our people advancing towards them on
rising ground, they immediately raised themselves and took to flight,
so that they were distinctly seen by those who were in the skiff.
These people were savages black and quite naked not having so much
even as the covering worn by nearly all other savage people. The
sailors, having no longer any hope of finding water there, swam on
board again, wounded and bruised by the blows which they received
from the waves and rocks.</p>

<p>The anchor being weighed they continued their course along the
shore, in the hopes of finding some spot more adapted for
landing.</p>

<p>On the 15th, in the morning, they discovered a cape, from the
point of which there ran a reef or chain of rocks a mile into the
sea, whilst another reef extended itself along the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 65}</u></p>

<p>coast. As the sea there appeared but little agitated, they
ventured between the rocks, but found that they formed only a
<i>cul-de-sac</i>, and that there was no place for exit. About noon,
they saw another opening, where the sea was smooth, but it appeared
dangerous to attempt it, there being no more than two feet of water
and many stones. In front of the whole length of this coast is a
table of sand one mile in breadth. As soon as they landed they fell
to digging wells in this advanced coast, but the water which they
found there was brackish. At length, they discovered some soft rain
water in the clefts of the rocks, which was a great relief to them,
for they were dying of thirst, having had for some days previously,
little more than half a pint of water apiece. Of this, they collected
during the night that they remained there about twenty gallons. It
was evident that some savages had been there a short time before, as
they found the remains of crayfish and some ashes.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, they resolved to return again to the
shore, in the hopes of being able to collect a greater quantity of
water from the rocks, since there remained no chance of their finding
it elsewhere. But no rain had fallen for some time, for they
discovered no more, and the land which they found beyond the rocks
that skirted the coast held out no promise to them. The country was
flat, without vegetation or trees, with nothing in view but anthills,
and these so large that, from a distance, they were taken to be the
habitations of the Indians. They found there such a wonderful
quantity of flies, that they were compelled to defend themselves from
them. At some distance they perceived eight savages, each of whom
carried a club in his hand; these came up within musket shot, but
when they saw our people advancing to meet them, they took to flight.
At length, finding that there was no longer hope of obtaining water
our people determined about mid-day to leave the coast, and
accordingly departed by another opening in this</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 66}</u></p>

<p>reef, more to the northward. Finding by observation that they were
in 22&deg; 17', they formed the idea of seeking the river of Jacob
Remmessens, but the wind blowing from the north-east, they found they
could no longer follow the coast; when, taking into consideration
that they were distant more than one hundred miles from the place of
shipwreck, and that they had with difficulty found sufficient water
for their subsistance, they resolved to make the best of their way to
Batavia, to inform the governor to their misfortune, and to solicit
assistance for the people they had left in the islands.</p>

<p>On the 17th, they were prevented by fog from taking an observation
at mid-day, but, by their reckoning, they made ten miles upon a wind,
west-north-west; the weather rough with much rain and wind which,
towards mid-day, veered north-east slightly towards the north, their
course lying to the west. The same weather continued the whole of the
19th, so that they were again unable to take an observation; but by
their reckoning they made about seven leagues, their course lying
north-north-east, and the wind being due west.</p>

<p>On the 20th, they found themselves by an observation in 19&deg;
22&frac12; of latitude, having made by reckoning, twenty-two miles,
their course lying northerly, and the wind west south-west, fresh,
with a slight rain.</p>

<p>On the 21st, they reckoned to have made twenty-three miles in a
northerly direction, the wind varying from south-west to southeast,
sometimes fresh, followed by a calm.</p>

<p>An observation on the 22nd showed them to be in latitude 16&deg;
10', which greatly surprised them, as they could not imagine how, in
so short a time, they had been enabled to pass so many degrees; the
current apparently carried them</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 67}</u></p>

<p>strongly towards the north. By their reckoning they were found to
have made twenty-four miles, the course northerly, with a fresh
breeze at times from the southeast. They found it impossible to take
observation upon the 23rd, but by their reckoning, they had made
sixteen miles, their course lying north by west, the wind this day
sometimes veering from east to west, weather variable, rainy and
occasionally calm. In the evening the wind stood at south
south-east.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the weather was dry, fresh, with the wind southeast
by south. About mid-day they found themselves in latitude 13&deg;
10', the course twenty-five miles north by west.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the wind blew from the south-east, the weather dry
and fresh, and the latitude 13&deg; 30'. This day they had advanced
by their reckoning thirty-one miles, north by west, and saw much sea
weed.</p>

<p>The 26th day they were in latitude 9&deg; 56', the wind
south-east, and the weather dry. This day they advanced twenty-four
miles in the same direction.</p>

<p>On the 27th day the wind blew from the south-east, and the weather
being rainy they were unable to take an observation. After mid-day
they saw the land of Java, in latitude 8&deg; according to their
calculations, and distant about four or five miles. They changed
their course to west north-west, hugging the coast until evening,
when they discovered a point beyond which lay an island abounding
with trees. Having made for this point they found, towards dusk, a
bay, into which they entered, following a course towards the north
north-west, and casting anchor in eight fathoms water, with a hard
bottom, they passed the night there.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, they weighed anchor, and rowed towards
shore to look for water for they were reduced to extremity by thirst.
Happily they discovered a spring at which they quenched their thirst
and refilled</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 68}</u></p>

<p>their casks, and towards mid-day resumed their course for
Batavia.</p>

<p>After midnight in the second watch of the 29th, they perceived an
island before them, which they left on their starboard or right side,
and at day-break found themselves near the cove which lies upon the
west side thereof from whence they continued their course towards the
west north-west. By pursuing this route one gives a wide berth to the
shore at the bottom of this cove, but nears it again before the
Trowuen Islands are reached. About mid-day they found themselves in
latitude 6&deg; 48', and that by reckoning they made thirty miles,
the course lying west north-west, about three o'clock in the
afternoon. They passed between these two islands, and saw upon the
more westerly one a great quantity of cocoa-nut trees. About evening
they were still distant one mile from the south point of Java, and at
the third bell of the second watch found themselves exactly between
Java and Prince's Island. On the morning of the thirtieth day they
were near the coast of Prince's Island, and made only two miles that
day. Towards evening a slight breeze sprung up from the land.</p>

<p>The weather moderated on the 1st of July, and at mid-day they were
still full three leagues distant from the island called
Dwaers-inden-wegh<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> the wind being
inconstant. About evening the wind blew from the north-west, so that
they gained the island of which I speak. The night was calm, and they
were constrained to row.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second, being opposite the island called
Toppers-hoetien, they were forced to remain at anchor till nigh
eleven o'clock, expecting the sea breeze; but it rose so slightly
that 'they were compelled to continue rowing, and found by the
evening that they had only advanced two miles. At sunset they
perceived a sail astern opposite to</p>

<blockquote>[*1) "Dwaers-inden-wegh" signifies the island which lies
across the path, i.e. Thwart-the-way Island.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 69}</u></p>

<p>the island Dwaers-inden-wegh, whereupon they reached the coast and
cast anchor there, resolved to await its coming. When the morning
came they boarded this vessel hoping to obtain assistance and arms
for their defence against the Javanese in case they were at war with
the Dutch. They found the vessel accompanied by two others of the
Company, in one of which was Ramburgh, counsellor to the Company.
Pelsart went on board this vessel, and having recounted to him with
grief the accident that had befallen him, sailed with him to
Batavia.</p>

<p>Whilst he is soliciting assistance, I will return to those of the
crew who remained upon the island; but I should first inform you that
the supercargo, named Jerome Cornelis, formerly an apothecary at
Harlem, had conspired with the pilot and others, when off the coast
of Africa, to obtain possession of the ship and to take her to
Dunkirk, or to avail themselves of her for the purposes of piracy.
This supercargo remained upon the wreck ten days after the vessel had
struck, having discovered no means of reaching the shore. He even
passed two days upon the mainmast, which floated, and having from
thence got upon a yard, at length gained the land. In the absence of.
Pelsart he became commander, and deemed this a suitable occasion for
putting his original design into execution, concluding that it would
not be difficult to become master of that which remained of the
wreck, and to surprise the commander when he should arrive with
assistance which he had gone to Batavia to seek and afterwards to
cruise in these seas with his vessel. To accomplish this it was
necessary to get rid of those of the crew who were not of his party;
but before embruing his hands with blood, he caused his accomplices
to sign a species of compact, by which they promised fidelity one to
another. The entire crew was divided between three islands; upon that
of Cornelis, which they had named the graveyard of Batavia, was the
greatest number of men. One of them,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 70}</u></p>

<p>by name Weybehays, had been dispatched to another island to seek
for water, and having discovered some after a search of twenty days,
he made the preconcerted signal by lighting three fires, but in vain,
for they were not seen by the people of cornelis's company, the
conspirators having during that time, murdered those who were not of
their party. Of these they killed thirty or forty; some few saved
themselves on pieces of wood, which they joined together, and going
in search of Weybehays informed him of the horrible massacre that had
taken place Having with him forty-five men he resolved to keep upon
his guard, and to defend himself from these assassins if they should
make an attack upon his company, which, in effect, they designed to
do, and to treat the other party in the same manner; for they feared
lest their company or that which remained upon the third island,
should inform the commander upon his arrival and thus prevent the
execution of their design. They succeeded easily with the party last
mentioned, which was the weakest killing the whole of them excepting
seven children and some women. They hoped to succeed as easily with
Weybehays' company and in the meanwhile broke open the chests of
merchandise which had been saved from the vessel. Jerome Cornelis
caused clothing to be made for his company out of the rich stuffs
which he found therein, choosing to himself a body guard, each of
whom he clothed in scarlet, embroidered with gold and silver.
Regarding the women as part of the spoil, he took one for himself,
and gave one of the daughters of the minister to a principal member
of his party, abandoning the other three for public use; he drew up
also certain rules for the future conduct of his men.</p>

<p>After these horrible proceedings, he caused himself to be elected
captain-general by a document, which he compelled all his companions
to sign. He afterwards sent twenty-two men in two shallops to destroy
the company of Weybehays, but they met with a repulse. Taking with
him thirty-seven</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 71}</u></p>

<p>men he went himself against Weybehays, who received him at the
water's edge as he disembarked, and forced him to retire although he
had no other weapons but, clubs, the ends of which he had armed with
spikes. Finding force unavailing he had recourse to other means. He
proposed a treaty of peace, the chaplain who remained with Weybehays
drawing up the conditions; it was agreed to with this proviso, that:
Weybehays' company should remain unmolested, who, upon their part,
agreed to deliver up a little boat in which one of the sailors had
escaped from the island where Cornelis was located, to that of
Weybehays, receiving in return some stuffs for clothing his people.
During the negotiations Cornelis wrote to certain French soldiers who
belonged to the company, offering to each six thousand pounds to
corrupt them, with the hope that with this assistance he might easily
compass his design. His letters, which were without effect, were
shown to Weybehays, and Cornelis, who was ignorant of their
disclosure, having arrived the next day width three or four others to
find Weybehays and bring him the apparel, the latter caused him to be
attacked, killed two or three of his company, and took Cornelis
himself prisoner. One, by name Wouterlos, who escaped from this rout,
returned the following day to renew the attack, but with little
success.</p>

<p>Pelsart arrived, during these occurrences in the frigate
<i>Sardam</i>; as he approached the wreck he observed smoke from a
distance, rising from one of the islands, a circumstance that
afforded him great consolation, since he perceived by it that his
people were not all dead. He cast anchor, and threw himself
immediately into a skiff with bread and wine, and proceeded to land
in one of the islands. Nearly at the same time a boat came alongside
armed with four men. Weybehays, who was one of the four, ran to him,
informed him of the massacre, and advised him to return as speedily
as possible to his vessel, for that the conspirators designed</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 72}</u></p>

<p>to surprise him--having already murdered twenty-five parsons--and
to attack him with two shallops; adding, that he himself had that
morning been at close quarters with them Pelsart perceived at the
same time the two shallops coming towards him, and had scarcely got
on board his own vessel before they came alongside. He was surprised
to see the people covered with embroidery of gold and silver, and
weapons in their hands, and demanded of them why they approached the
vessel armed. They replied that they would inform him when they came
on board. He commanded them to east their arms into the sea, or
otherwise he would sink them. Finding themselves compelled to submit,
they threw away their weapons, and, being ordered on board, were
immediately placed i irons. One of them named Jan de Bremen, who was
the first examined, confessed that he had put to death, or assisted
in the assassination of twenty-seven persons. The same evening
Weybehays brought his prisoner on board.</p>

<p>On the 18th day of September, the captain and the master-pilot
taking with them ten men of Weybehays' company, passed over in boats
to the island of Cornelis. Those who still remained thereon lost all
courage as soon as they saw them alongside, and allowed themselves,
to be placed in irons. The captain's first care was to make search
for the jewels, which had been distributed here and there. The whole
of these were discovered at the first search, with the exception of a
chain of gold and a ring, the latter of which was afterwards
recovered. The wreck was afterwards visited. The vessel was broken
into a hundred pieces; the keel upon one, aground upon a sandbank,
the forepart of the vessel resting upon a rock, and other pieces
scattered here and there, holding out little hope to Pelsart of
saving any part of the Company's merchandise. The steward informed
him, that about one month previous, upon the only fine day they had
had during their residence there, having gone out fishing</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 73}</u></p>

<p>near the wreck, he had struck against one of the chests filled
with silver with the end of a pike.</p>

<p>On the 19th, they conveyed the other accomplices to the island for
the purpose of examining them.</p>

<p>On the 20th, they sent various necessaries to Weybehays' company,
and brought away water from them; for, after being ten days upon the
island without discovering any, they thought of tasting some which
was in two wells, but which they had believed to be salt, because it
rose and fell with the tide, but they afterwards found it to be good
to drink.</p>

<p>On the 21st, they found the tide very low, and the wind so strong
from the east south-east, that the boat could not go out this
day.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, they again wished to examine the wreck, but the sea
broke upon it so roughly that the swimmers themselves did not venture
to approach it.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the master and pilot approached it at a favourable
moment, and those who remained on shore perceiving that there was
something that they were unable to remove therefrom, sent assistance
to them, the captain going in person, and they found that the men
discovered a chest full of silver. A second chest was afterwards
found, and the two were placed on dry land; but they were unable to
obtain more that day on account of the bad weather, although the
divers of Guzarat assured them they had found six other chests which
they could easily remove.</p>

<p>On the 26th, after they had dined, the weather being fine and the
tide very low, the master set out for the spot where the chests had
been seen and recovered three, placing an anchor and a piece of
artillery to mark the spot where a fourth remained, which after great
endeavours, they found themselves unable to move.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the wind blew very cold from the south.</p>

<p>On the 28th, the wind continued from the same quarter,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 74}</u></p>

<p>and as it did not suffer them to work near the wreck, the captain
assembled a council to advise whether he should bring the prisoners
to trial there, or carry them to Batavia, to be there tried by the
officers of the Company. The great number of them, and the temptation
offered by the great treasures which they had recovered from the
wreck; and with which the frigate was loaded caused the majority to
vote for their immediate trial and execution, which was there and
then carried into effect.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-06"></a>VOYAGE OF GERRIT THOMASZ POOL TO THE SOUTH
LAND.</h3>

<h4>TRANSLATED FROM 'VALENTYN'S "BESCHRYVINGE VAN BANDA," p. 47.</h4>

<p>On the 26th of March, 1636, there arrived two shallops, the
<i>Amsterdam</i> and the <i>Weasel</i>, sent from Amboina, with
orders to Governor Acoley at Banda, to give to the commander of these
ships, Gerard Thomasz Pool, such information concerning the South
Land as might be necessary for him to perform a voyage thither, under
the orders of the honourable Company.</p>

<p>After he had received the desired instructions, and had been
furnished with sufficient provisions and other necessaries, he sailed
with those vessels on the 17th of April.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June following both these vessels returned, and
informed the governor that, having reached the Flat Point in about
4&frac12;&deg; of south latitude on the 18th of April, they had
determined to send some of their people on shore to take a view of
the country. The Commander Pool, desirous to see everything himself,
resolved to be of the party and took with him his steward, Andries
Schiller, a native of Nuremberg. They were scarcely landed, when a
large body of wild Southlanders, who at first appeared friendly, but
acted afterwards in a hostile manner, surrounded them, in so much
that it was not in their power to escape. The Commander Pool
perceiving the danger greater</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 76}</u></p>

<p>than he at first expected, was still in hopes to escape; but he
found himself attacked one of the first and received a blow with a
hazegay, which immediately brought him to the ground. When he
recovered his senses and saw that his steward was still defending
himself, he called out to him that he would do better to try to make
his escape, as otherwise he would not be able to do it for the
savages were coming on in yet greater numbers. He did so, but was
likewise soon knocked down.</p>

<p>The wild Southlanders, perceiving the hanger which the Commander
Pool had in his hand, forced it from him and cut these two men to
pieces, and carried them into the wood; but it never could be
discovered what they did with them, nor what became of the two
sailors who were likewise missing.</p>

<p>The crew could only tell, that these Southlanders have a very
black skin, much like the Caffers of Angola, but with long black hair
on their head, and were much stouter and taller in stature than any
Europeans, and quite naked, with the exception of their middle. They
also reported that one of them, appearing to be a chief, had a rough
skin of some wild beast wrapped round his neck; and that they were
armed partly with hazegays, and a kind of javelins with sharp iron
points; and partly with bows and arrows.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-07"></a>ACCOUNT OF THE WRECK OF THE SHIP "DE VERGULDE
DRAECK" ON THE SOUTHLAND, AND THE EXPEDITIONS UNDERTAKEN,</h3>

<h4>BOTH FROM BATAVIA AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, IN SEARCH OF THE
SURVIVORS AND MONEY AND GOODS WHICH MIGHT BE FOUND ON THE WRECK, AND
OF THE SMALL SUCCESS WHICH ATTENDED THEM.</h4>

<p align="center"><b><i>Drawn up and Translated from Authentic MS.
Copies of the Logbooks in the Royal Archives at the
Hague.</i></b></p>

<p>The ship <i>De Vergulde Draeck</i>, equipped by the Chamber of
Amsterdam, having sailed on the 4th of October, 1655, from Tessel to
East India, with a rich cargo, including 78,600 guilders in cash, in
eight boxes, was wrecked very suddenly on the 28th of April, at
night, at the beginning of the first day-watch, on the coast of the
Southland, on a reef stretching out to sea about one mile and a half,
latitude 30 2/3&deg;. Of one hundred and ninety-three souls only
seventy-five, among whom were the skipper Pieter Aberts and the
under-steersman, reached the shore alive. Nothing was saved from the
ship, which foundered and sunk at once, except a small quantity of
provisions washed on shore by the waves. The news was brought to
Batavia by one of the ship's boats, with the above-mentioned
steersman and six sailors, after beating about for a month, on the
7th of June, with the account that the sixty-eight persons who
remained behind were exerting themselves to get their boat afloat
again, which lay deeply embedded in the sand, that they might send it
also with some of their number to</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 78}</u></p>

<p>Batavia. The General and Council resolved, for the rescue both of
the above-mentioned unfortunate men, and also of the Company's specie
and merchandise, to get ready without delay a quick-sailing fly-boat,
the <i>Witte Valck</i>, provisioned for five months, with some
further supplies for the above-mentioned men at the Southland; as
also some expert divers, with hatchets and other necessary
implements. This they ordered to join company with the yacht the
<i>Goede Hoop</i>, then cruizing in the Straits of Sunda, with
instructions that they should both proceed together without loss of
time from the Straits southwards, as far as 32&deg; to 33&deg;
latitude, or until they met a strong westerly trade-wind, in which
case they would steer towards the coast of the Southland. They were,
moreover, to explore the said coast with particular attention, near
the part where the ship had been wrecked, further than it had been
already known, and to lay it down on a map, with its capes, inlets,
bays, rocks, sands, and shoals.</p>

<p>The <i>Witte Valck</i> set sail on the 8th of June, in order to
join company with the yacht <i>Goede Hoop</i>, in the Sunda Straits.
They sailed out together, but returned without having succeeded in
their object; the former, on the 14th of September and the yacht a
month afterwards, having been forced by a severe storm to part
company on the 18th of July, on their way out. According to the
captain's journals lying at Batavia, they had reached the coast just
in the winter time, during which season the sea is so boisterous
there, that an approach to the coast is a matter of extreme danger.
Thus, as these documents inform us, they were compelled, after
experiencing great danger and exhausting every effort, to put off
from the coast and to return to Batavia, leaving behind them eleven
men of the yacht <i>Hoop</i>, three of them having wandered too far
into the woods and eight having been sent in search of them, but not
one of the number returned. As the boat in which they had rowed to
land was found dashed to pieces on the shore, the whole</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 79}</u></p>

<p>number most probably came to an untimely end. According to the
reports which were made, some men or some signs of the wreck had been
noticed, although the <i>Goede Hoop</i> which had been at the place
where the ship was supposed to have been wrecked, gave a different
statement.</p>

<p>Subsequently the commander at the Cape of Good Hope, according to
instructions sent to him, gave orders in the year 1657 to the
fly-boat <i>Vinck</i> bound thence to Batavia, to touch en passant at
the same place where the above-mentioned disaster had occurred, that
search might be made for the unfortunate men. But his vessel also
having arrived at the unfavourable season; found no means of landing
either with fly-boat or boat, so as to make 'a proper search.
According to its reports, having, on the 8th of June; 1657 during the
daytime, seen signs of land in 29@ 7' south latitude, and the weather
being very favourable, they anchored at night in twenty-five fathoms
water, the bottom being coarse sand mixed with coral. In the morning,
when day dawned, they saw the surf breaking over the reef at, the
foot of which they lay, and on One side of them the Southland,
presenting a low sandy shore, on which their anchor, lifted. They
continued their course along the coast in order to observe the land,
which was still kept in sight the following day. The weather,
however, became so boisterous, and the breakers roiled all along-the
coast with such violence, that they were compelled to put out a
little further to sea, yet, throughout the 10th and 11th of June,
they still followed the coast line in forty or fifty fathoms water.
However, the chance of landing grew gradually less as they proceeded,
for the weather continued stormy with thunder and lightning, so that
it became necessary to get clear of the coast. They allowed their
ship to drive before the wind under bare poles until the 12th, when
they loosened sail a little, the wind shifting between S., S.S.W.,
and S.S.E., and stood out towards Batavia, where they arrived on the
27th.</p>

</center>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, and although, as the statement of the
General and Council shows, the rescue of these men seemed hopeless
since it was evident that they must either have perished from hunger
and misery, or been murdered by the barbarous natives; they resolved
afterwards, as there might be still some hope left, however small, to
despatch, for a third time, two galliots, the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>
and <i>Emeloort</i>, the former with a crew of forty, the latter of
twenty-five men, provisioned for six months. They set sail from
Batavia on the 1st of January, 1658, with distinct orders both as to
how to reach the Southland and as to their conduct during the voyage:
amongst them these, that after passing the Straits of Sunda they
should steer towards the S.W., and as much further south, as the wind
would allow, so as to meet the S.E. trade winds, when they would
proceed at once as far southwards as they could be crowding all sail
until the west winds were encountered, when again they should
immediately steer as much south as east, in that, without loss of
time and before encountering land they might reach the latitude of
32&deg; to 33, when directing their course eastwards, they should
make the attempt to land at the Southland. It was enjoined that every
possible precaution should be used, as the coast in that quarter was
not much known or properly explored. It was added, that their arrival
would be in summer or the most favourable season of the year; with
other matters set forth in the instructions given to them by the
General and Council on the last day of December, 1657. On the 19th of
April they returned to Batavia, having each of them separately, after
parting company by the way, sailed backwards and forwards again and
again, and landed parties at several points along the coast. They had
also continually fired signal guns night and day, without, however,
discovering either any Dutchmen or the wreck of the vessel. The only
things seen were some few planks and blocks, with a piece of the
mast, a taffrail, fragments of barrels, and other</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 81}</u></p>

<p>objects scattered here and there along the coast, and supposed to
be remnants of the wreck. The crew of the Emeloort also saw at
different points five black men of extremely tall stature, without
however daring to land there. Thus of this expedition again the only
result was, that the crew of the <i>Waeckende Boey</i> abandoned a
boat with fourteen of their comrades, including the upper steersman,
and that in a manner but too reckless as it afterwards proved and as
we shall presently show. The boat having been sent to land, and not
returning within twenty-four hours, they concluded that it must have
been dashed against the cliffs and all hands perished; the more so
as, on returning to the same place five days afterwards, and firing
several signal-guns landwards, no men or signs of men were seen. But
from the report of four of their number who afterwards arrived at
Japara by way of Mataram, it appeared that the unfortunate men,
seeing themselves abandoned by their ship and finding no other
resource left, resolved at last to steer for the coast of Java.
Accordingly having repaired their boat, as best they might, with
sealskins, and provided themselves with a little water and seals'
flesh, they set out on the 10th of April and arrived on the 28th of
the same month on the south side of that island. But of their number
at that time eleven only remained, three having perished of thirst on
the way, whilst four others in the first instance, and afterwards
two, who had been made to swim ashore in search of water had not
returned, either from obstinacy or because they were killed by the
natives. On the following day, the boat was dashed to pieces on the
beach by a heavy sea when the above four men, without having met
either with the seven above-mentioned or any other men, took their
way westward along the coast and continued to march for two months in
a very weak and exhausted condition, until they at last met with men
who brought them to Mataram.</p>

<p>Among the number of those who returned was the upper</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 82}</u></p>

<p>steersman, Abraham Leeman van Santwigh. Of the remaining seven
nothing more was heard.</p>

<p>It afterwards appeared from the diaries of the before-mentioned
galliots that, notwithstanding the strong injunctions to that effect
laid down in their instructions, proper care had not been taken by
them to keep together, so as to render assistance to each other in
case of accident and to combine in using the most effectual means for
landing and exploring the coast.</p>

<p>The Fiscal of India was ordered to consult further with the
Council of Justice on the subject, but the General and Council were
of opinion that the unfortunate men from the ship <i>De Draeck</i>
must one and all have perished long ago, since no traces of them had
been discovered throughout the whole length of the coast.
Consequently all thoughts of any further special expeditions were
given up, the more so as the two former ones had proved so
disastrous. Orders, however, were given that any galliot or light
fly-boat should seize any opportunity of touching there in favourable
weather once more on their way from this country, to see if any clue
to the missing men might perchance be found.</p>

<p>The log-books of the galliots were sent over, together with an
extract from that of the fly-boat <i>Elburgh</i>, as far as related
to the Southland, together with the small charts of the coast.</p>

<p>We shall now enter into a few further particulars with a view to
the fuller elucidation of the subject. According to the journal of
Aucke Pietersz Jonck, skipper of the galliot Emeloort, they sighted
land while at a distance of four miles from the shore, on the 8th of
March, at 300 25' south latitude, the south point lying E.S.E., and
the north point N.E. by N. They also saw smoke rising towards the
E.S.E., whereupon they fired three guns and hoisted a large flag on
the mainmast. At night a fire was again seen at N.E. by E.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 83}</u></p>

<p>On the 9th, a fire on shore was again seen and answered with a
signal of three guns and the boat was launched with a crew of nine
hardy men and the steersman, provisioned for eight days; on their
approach the smoke or fire disappeared, whereupon they returned on
board. This fire was at a distance of two miles from the former one.
Nine signal-guns were then fired from the ship, and afterwards three
at night. A light was also hung aloft during the night but no signs
were observed on land.</p>

<p>On the 10th, the boat was again sent ashore and a large fire again
seen on the beach, at the same place as on the previous day upon
which a gun was fired every hour from the ship and a flag hoisted.
About two hours elapsed before the boat could reach the shore. Fires
at four different points were again seen from the ship during the
night, one of which continued burning throughout the night, and
several musket-shots were fired.</p>

<p>The boat's crew related that they had come across three huts, and
had encountered five persons of tall stature and imposing appearance,
who made signs to them to approach; this, however, from distrust of
their intentions, they did not venture to do. On their returning
again to the boat these people followed them down to the beach, but
were afraid to enter the boat. Much brushwood was seen on shore by
this party and in some places crops of growing grain which they set
fire to, also portions of land under cultivation; no fruits, however,
were noticed, but merely a few herbs of an agreeable smell. Further
inland they saw neither fresh water nor trees, but numerous sandy
downs; at night also many fires. After having gone three miles along
the shore as well as inland without meeting any misadventure, they
again proceeded with the ship under sail, but saw no signs of
anything remarkable along the coast from latitude 33&deg; 30' to
30&deg; 25'. There they went again on shore with the same result.
This prolonged investigation proved altogether fruitless</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 84}</u></p>

<p>with regard both to the lost ship and the crew. The natives they
encountered were men of stalwart frame, naked, and very dark-skinned;
they wore a headdress forming a kind of crown, but with no covering
on any part of their bodies except their middle. They then returned,
the crew beginning to suffer very much chiefly from sore eyes. They
left the cliff Tortelduyf on the starboard side. On the 15th of March
they saw many gulls, entirely black, but of small size, and on the
17th, several wag-tails. On the 26th, the point Wynkoopbergen lay to
the W.N.W. of them, distant three miles. They continued to coast
along at a distance of four, five, six or seven miles, and would have
again touched land had the weather permitted.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April they made for the west point of Java, and
there fell in again with the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>, which had lost
its boat and schuyt and fourteen men, and had got some timber from
the <i>Vergulde Draeck</i> at 31&deg; 15' south latitude, without
having perceived anything else.</p>

<p>Further, from the journal of the <i>Waeckende Boey</i> it appears,
that having arrived on the 23rd of February 1658, at 31&deg; 40',
they saw land at a distance of eight miles from them, bore down upon
it and found it to be an island about three miles distant from the
mainland. On the 24th, they came to anchor in seventeen fathoms water
and launched the boat, there being a bar between the ship and the
shore. On the 25th, they still lay at 31&deg; 20'.</p>

<p>On the 26th, on the return of the boat from the shore, the
steersman reported many signs of the lost ship <i>Draeck</i>, but
neither footpaths no any places where traces of human beings had been
left were discovered, notwithstanding they had been in all directions
both inland and along the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 85}</u></p>

<p>coast. They further reported that wood and other objects, portions
of boxes, etc., a barrel, and other things had been found; also a
number of pieces of plank, standing upright in a circle. Having
weighed anchor they sailed along the coast, and on that occasion
their schuyt had capsized and lost.</p>

<p>On the 27th, when about two miles from the coast, latitude 31&deg;
14 minutes, the boat was sent on shore, and returned with the report
that nothing had been observed but a reef about 2/3 (of a mile?) off
the coast seawards.</p>

<p>On the 28th, having arrived at 30&deg; 40', and several fires
having been seen on land, the boat was again sent out. The steersman
reported that nothing had been observed but a great smoke, and that
they had been unable to land with the boat owing to the violence of
the surf. Having descried the <i>Emeloort</i> in the offing, they
returned with her.</p>

<p>March 2nd, at 30&deg; 6', the <i>Emeloort</i> was separated from
them in the night and was lost sight of. On the 5th, they were driven
by stormy weather round the south.</p>

<p>The weather continuing cold and wet, they resolved to serve out
extra rations of rum to each man.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the weather grew grey and cold. They supposed
themselves to be in 31&deg; 47'. The 18th, saw land to the eastward,
being about 31&deg; 49'. At sunset they came to anchor under a
north-easterly point of the island, half a mile from land.</p>

<p>On the 19th, a boat was put off in the direction of the island;
the steersman reported its being well wooded, but that no good
landing place had been met with, the coast being surrounded by rocky
reefs.</p>

<p>Two seals were seen there also one wild cat, and the excrements of
other animals. On the 20th, a boat was sent on shore well-manned; the
following day several signal-guns were fired, and in the evening the
boat returned to the ship bringing with it a piece of the mast of the
<i>Draeck</i>, and again returning to land after taking in a supply
of provisions, brought back a part of the round-top, a block, and
other trifling objects.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, they again sent to shore. At night it blew hard, the
waves running very high. A gun was fired and a</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 86}</u></p>

<p>light hung out as a guide to the boat on its return. They ran
great risk of driving upon the rocks. At midnight, the cable parting,
another anchor was dropped.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the weather being still boisterous, and they
themselves in great distress and nothing seen of the boat, fears were
entertained that it might have capsized or been dashed against the
rocks. They were afterwards compelled to cut their cable and run out
to sea.</p>

<p>On the 27th, they sighted the island again, and ran so near the
coast that they might have been seen by a man on the beach. Several
guns were fired toward the place where the boat had last gone to
land, but neither sign nor sound being observed, it was taken for
certain that they had been lost, and resolved that they should sail
along the coast toward Batavia. The fire was again seen at dusk close
to the sea-line which they supposed to have been lighted by the crew
of the <i>Draeck</i> or the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>, as no such fire
had been seen before. A gun was fired, whereupon another fire close
to the first became visible. But having neither boat nor schuyt, it
was impossible to land and equally so to come to anchor the bottom
being coral-rock.</p>

<p>On the 29th, they found themselves at some distance to the north
of the point where the fire was seen. The coast became more level as
they proceeded, and they sailed along the shore till sunset, when
they again ran further out to sea; in the course of the second watch
they passed the Tortelduyf cliff, the surf breaking on it being
plainly visible.</p>

<p>On the 30th, the weather not permitting them to run close in, they
remained at some distance off shore. On the 31st, they were distant
five miles from the Dirck Hertogs Reede, and on April 10th arrived at
Java.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*]</b></p>

<blockquote>[*) From another extract from these MS. logbooks at the
Hague, which was made at the editor's request, there was an
additional observation of importance which is here omitted. Three
times Captain Jonck speaks of a southern current running along the
coast, which struck his attention in these seas. Among other passages
he speaks of it in these terms: "We had deviated from our course
fifteen minutes to the south, and this we attributed to a southern
current, which we have observed several times on this coast, which is
a strange thing, the [ship?] being drawn by the current in spite of
the wind and the waves." Elsewhere he estimates the force of this
current at ten miles in the twenty-four hours.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 87}</u></p>

<p>From the journal of the above-mentioned Abraham Leeman, steersman
of the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>, it appears that they first sighted the
Southland on the 22nd of Jebruary, 1656, went several times on shore
with the boat, and on one occasion, on the 20th of March, having
again landed, they went inland in a northerly direction and in
searching along the beach found there pieces of plank, lids of boxes,
staves of water-barrels and butter-casks, and other objects of
trifling importance The heat on that day was excessive, so much so
that one of the men fainted. They also found similar planks, staves,
etc., in an enclosure. They then encountered a heavy sea; which
prevented their returning on board their vessel, and were obliged to
sail along the cliffs in the utmost peril. Owing to the dangerous
nature of the coast they were obliged to keep themselves alive by
eating seals' flesh, gulls, etc., and from want of fresh water, they
were compelled to supply its place by sea-water and their own urine.
At last they were compelled to undertake a perilous voyage across the
ocean in their little shallop, and at length reached Batavia by way
of Mataram and Japara.</p>

<p>Moreover the General and Council recount, in their general letter
of the 14th of December, 1658, that the fly-boat <i>Elburg</i>, when
on its way hence, had come upon the Southland in 31&frac12;&deg;
latitude, and had been obliged, on account of wind and the heavy sea,
to anchor about two miles and a half off the coast in twentytwo
fathoms water, not without great danger. Twelve days afterwards they
again got into open sea; and in latitude 33&deg; 14' found a
commodious anchorage</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 88}</u></p>

<p>under a projecting corner of the island in twenty fathoms water.
The skipper, steersman, with the sergeant and six soldiers went
ashore and found three black men round a fire, dressed in skins, like
the native of the Cape of Good Hope. They could not however get to
speak to them. Three small hammers were also found there, with wooden
handles and heads of hard stone fastened to the stem by a sort of
gum-lack, strong enough to break a man's skull. A little further
inland stood some huts but no more men were seen. In several places
they found fresh water, and here and there a great quantity of this
gum. The small hammer brought here was found, when rubbed, to be of
an agreeable odour and of a reddish colour.</p>

<p>Lastly we have to notice that according to certain printed
accounts, the ship <i>Batavia</i>, having sailed hence to Batavia,
ran very unexpectedly, on the 4th of June of the following year, 1659
in the morning hours, latitude 281/3, on the dangerous shoals of the
Abrolhos, commonly called with us Frederick Houtman's Cliffs, and was
wrecked. The crew however reached in safety some small islands which
lay near. No fresh water was found there, but the boat with some men
having left the island, say in 24&deg; latitude, smoke rising and
observed black men on the shore.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-08"></a>DESCRIPTION OF THE WEST COAST OF THE SOUTH
LAND, BY THE CAPTAIN SAMUEL VOLKERSEN, OF THE PINK, "WAECKENDE
BOEY,"</h3>

<h4>WHICH SAILED FROM BATAVIA ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY, 1658, AND
RETURNED ON THE 19TH OF APRIL OF THE SAME YEAR.</h4>

<p align="center"><i>Translated from a Dutch MS. in the Royal
Archives at the Hague.</i></p>

<p>The South Land has on its coasts downs covered with grass and sand
so deep, that, in walking, one's foot is buried ankle-deep and leaves
great traces behind it. At about a league from the shore there runs a
reef of rock on which here and there the sea is seen to break with
great force. In some places there is a depth of from one, one and a
half, to two fathoms, so that a boat can pass after which the depth
becomes greater up to the shore; but it is everywhere a dangerous
coral bottom, on which it is difficult to find holding for an anchor.
There is only one spot about nine leagues to the north of the island
and where three rocks are joined by a reef that shelter is afforded
for a boat, and there one can effect a landing but the ground is
everywhere rocks. Further from the coast there is a raised ground
tolerably level but of a dry and barren aspect, except near the
island, where there is some foliage In nearly 32&deg; south latitude.
there is a large island, nearly three leagues from the continent,
with some rather high mountains, covered</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 90}</u></p>

<p>with wood and thickets which render it difficult to pass across.
It is dangerous to land there on account of the reefs of rock along
the coast; and moreover one sees many rocks between the continent and
this island and also a smaller island somewhat to the south. This
large island to which I have not chosen to give a name myself
thinking it right to leave the choice of name to the
Governor-general, may be seen from the sea at seven or eight leagues
distance on a clear day. I presume that both fresh water and wood
will be found there in abundance, though not without considerable
trouble.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p><i>Two certain signs of the proximity of the west coast of the
South Land.</i></p>

<p>1st. When a variation is perceived in the compass in these
countries to about 11&deg;, it may be taken for certain that the land
is not more than eighteen to twenty leagues distant.</p>

<p>2ndly. When one sees sea-weed floating, soundings will be found in
70, 60, 50, 40, 30 fathoms, or even less.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-09"></a>EXTRACT TRANSLATED FROM BURGOMASTER WITSEN'S
"NOORD EN OOST TARTARYE"</h3>

<h4>FOL., AMST.,1705, p. 163.</h4>

<p>"The north-west part of New Guinea, in 1&frac12;&deg; south
latitude, and beyond it to the south-east, was for the Dutch East
India Company and found almost everywhere to be enriched with very
fine rivers, lakes, bays, etc., but, judging from its outward aspect,
the country itself seems to be barren and uncultivated, being in few
spots either planted or fenced in. In many parts of the interior
there are extremely high mountains, which are seen by sailors at a
great distance at sea as if towering above the clouds. The air is not
very mild, but very often damp and foggy, so much so that most
frequently in the afternoons the land is entirely hidden which has
caused the Dutch east India Company the loss of many ships.</p>

<p>"About the north-western parts the natives are in general lean and
of the middle size, jet black, not unlike the Malabars, but the hair
of the head shorter and somewhat less curly than the Caffres. In the
black pupil of their eyes gleams a certain tint of red, by which may
in some measure be observed that bloodthirsty nature of theirs which
has at different times caused us so much grief, from the loss of
several of our young men whom they have surprised,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 92}</u></p>

<p>murdered, carried into the woods, and then devoured.</p>

<p>"They go entirely naked without the least shame, except their
rajah or petty kings, and their wives, which are not native Papoos
but mostly Ceram-Mestinzoes, and are richly dressed after the mann er
of Ceram. Their weapons are bows of bamboo, with arrows of the same,
to whose ends are fastened sharp pointed fish bones with dangerous
barbs, which when shot into the body cannot be extracted without
great difficulty. They likewise use lances made of certain heavy wild
Penang wood; these they throw at their mark with great accuracy at a
distance of six or seven fathoms. Some living near the shcre use a
certain kind of swords sold to them by the people of Ceram, the hilt
of which is tied to their hand by a rattan.</p>

<p>"Of their manners and religion, nothing else can be said than
that, in many respects, they are more like wild beasts than
reasonable human beings. Their women are delivered in the fields or
roads, or wherever they may happen to be taken in labour. After the
birth they instantly put the infant in a bag in which they carry
their provisions made of beaten bark of a tree. The women of the
better class rub their faces with bruised coals, by which they make
themselves look more like devils incarnate than human creatures;
though it cannot be denied that they seem to possess a law of nature,
a knowledge of the existence of a God, which they show by pointing
with folded hands towards the heavens. For when any one lands at any
place frequented by these people of Ceram, they require of us to
raise our hands as they do: and with a sharp bamboo they cut both
their own arms and those of their visitors. The mutual sucking of the
blood from these wounds constitutes their oath, and implies a promise
to do each other no mischief. Amongst them are found some letters or
characters written with a sort of red chalk on a rock. On this rock
also were still to be seen</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 93}</u></p>

<p>some skulls and the bust of a man looking as if put up as an
ornament, with a shield and other weapons near it, the meaning of all
which may be guessed at but not fixed with certainty.</p>

<p>"Their food consists of roots, tree fruits, herbs etc., but
chiefly fish, caught by them at low water in holes in the bed of the
river, as we, when lying at anchor thereabouts, could distinctly see
by the motion of the thousands of little lights which they used. They
know very little of cooking or drying their food, but generally eat
it raw except pork which they eat when it has been a little smoked
and is less than half roasted.</p>

<p>"In about 8&deg; or 9&deg; south latitude, we found a tall,
terrible, and disgusting race of people whose chiefs have the inside
of the upper lip slit from the nose downwards, the two parts being
kept asunder by what they call a gabbe-gabbe. The two sides of the
nose also are bored through with sasappen, or thin awls, which gives
their voices a frightful and hollow sound, as if coming out of a deep
cellar.</p>

<p>"It is believed that Nova Guinea is divided from Hollandia Nova or
the south land at about the latitude of 10&deg; south. Of the country
further south we have up to the present day no certain information
except that supplied by Abel Tasman, who sailed round the whole land
and the coasts of the Dutch East India Company's possessions And who
testifies to have found trees (beams) in which at intervals footsteps
were cut to climb up by, about seven feet apart, and also with
footsteps in the sand about fourteen or fifteen Dutch inches long,
and every footstep six or six and a half feet from the other. I am
informed by a mate who about thirty ox thirty-four years ago, list
his ship on the most westerly promontory of the south land, that he
with some of the crew reached Batavia in the ship's boat, and was
despatched from thence to the place where he was shipwrecked with
provisions and in order to deliver their shipmates</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 94}</u></p>

<p>they left these; but they found none of then though they saw
impressions of large footsteps.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>"The Ceramers are subjects and likewise allies of the Dutch
Company, and for the most part expert sailors; and by them and none
else is the coast of New Guinea visited. The inhabitants of New
Guinea have for many years suffered from the treachery and murders of
this people who not by force of arms but by cunning have subdued the
Papoos. Under the cloak of friendship they take their women (in which
they are not very choice) for wives and the children thus born, being
very carefully instructed in the Mahomedan faith, are easily able to
control these simple inhabitants of the woods. By this connection
also the Ceramers, having gained the attachment of the women, always
know how to escape the evil intentions which for all that the Papoos
cannot restrain themselves from trying to put in practice against
their visitors.</p>

<p>"The fruits of the country of New Guinea are very few, consisting
chiefly in some few yams, cocoa nuts, betal nuts, and plantain trees,
which are planted here and there, in the neighbourhood of their own
places by the Ceramers. The land does not seem to bring forth any
wild plants; the inhabitants live on leaf zajor<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>, roots trees and herbs, but the bread of the
Moluccas in general called sagou, is not produced here as far as I
could learn. Only one sort of it is brought here by the Ceramers for
their own provision, and also for barter. Fish of all sorts is
everywhere so plentiful along the shore that they may be caught with
the greatest ease in uncommon abundance; but they want nets and other
fishing tackle, though they supply this defect in a masterly manner
by their art in making their fish</p>

<blockquote>[*1) In another place Witsen says this happened in 1658,
and that eighty persons were so left behind, evidently from the crew
of the <i>Waeckende Boey</i>, see ante, p. 81. ]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*2) So in the Dutch. The editor has been unable to
identify this plant.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 95}</u></p>

<p>baskets in which at each spring tide, numbers of fish are caught.
It is not known that any large animals are found here except hogs
which are plentiful; but vermin and in particular snakes, scorpions
and millepedes, are here in great number.</p>

<p>"The woods are filled with a variety of birds, making all day such
uncommon noise that it is really astonishing. They are seldom if ever
shot by the inhabitants, as is sufficiently shown by their uncommon
tameness; for one being shot the other remains sitting next to it.
But our sportsmen must be careful in not entering too far into the
woods for the Papoos imitate the birds very accurately in order to
trepan and murder them, which has happened several times.</p>

<p>"They covet hatchets, cloaths and beads which are bartered for
slaves. When a slave is sold they cut off a lock of his hair,
believing in doing this they shall have more slaves. Those slaves are
either prisoners of war or trepanned in the woods, many of them are
sold in Ternate and thereabouts. At the first they are so greedy in
their eating that they would nearly burst if not checked in their
gluttony.</p>

<p>"The heathens of Nova Guinea and Hollandia Nova believe there is
some divinity in the serpent for which reason they represent them
upon their vessels.</p>

<p>"The following is an extract from a letter written to me from
Amboina, as an account of New Guinea and Hollandia Nova otherwise
called the South Land.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of all New Guinea are a tall, ugly and misshapen
people not so much by nature as choice; for they cut their nostrils
asunder, that you may nearly see into their throats from which it may
be conceived what fine faces those must be after having their
promontories demolished in this manner. They go mostly naked, except
those who live upon the islands who by their intercourse</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 96}</u></p>

<p>with the Ceram Lauers are become a little more polished. Of them
they get some little clothing with which they cover themselves,
though but scantily but on the continent they are a savage barbarous
people who can on no account be trusted. They are addicted to
thieving and murder so that the Ceram Lauers cannot trade with them
except at a distance. They lay their goods down upon the beach being
put up in heaps when the most venturesome among the strange traders
comes forward and makes it understood by gestures and signs how much
he wants for them. Their commerce consists in Tamboxe swords, axes to
cut the trees down, bad cloths, sagoebread, rice, and black sugar;
but the rice and black sugar must be given beforehand to induce them
to trade. No traces of government order or religion are discernible
amongst them. They live together like beasts; those upon the islands
erect houses and a kind of villages, placing their houses commonly
upon posts, raised to a considerable height above the ground. On the
continent they have slight huts covered with leaves like hog-styes;
in them lit indiscriminately men, dogs and hogs, upon the bare sand,
otherwise they lie down in any place where they can but find white
sand. They mourn more for the loss of a dog or hog than for their
mothers. They bury their dead hogs and dogs but not their deceased
relations whom they lay down upon high rocks to decay under the sun
and rain till nothing remains but the white bones, which at length
they bury when they think proper Their food consists chiefly of
fishes with which their seas abound and of yams and plantains. They
have no sagoe trees, neither do they know how to prepare the bread
from it if they had any. Their arms are hasagays, clumsy and long
arrows and also a weapon formed from a sort of blue stone or slate
pointed at both ends, having a hole in the middle, in which a stick
is put for a handle. With this they attack one another in such a
manner that with one stroke</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 97}</u></p>

<p>the skull is crushed to pieces the farther you go to the south the
more savage, tall and ugly the people are, in particular from
Lacca-iha to Oero-goba.</p>

<p>"A certain shallop from Banda, being on the coast which stretches
nearly east from Arou, they found there such large people that one of
our sailors was taken by his sleeve by one of them and shaken like a
little boy; but he was rescued by his shipmates To the south of this
place a great promontory stretches itself to the west called in the
map Cape Falso, and again, to the south of this, is laid down the
shallow bight where it is supposed that Nova Guinea is divided from
the South Land by a strait terminating in the South Sea, though, by
reason of the shallowness our people could not pass it; and thus it
remains uncertain whether this strait goes through or not but in the
old Portuguese maps New Guinea is laid down as an island under the
name of Ceira<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>"I must here remark a circumstance which is but little noticed in
European writings, which is that in some log-books the 'sea between
Banda and the South' Land is called the Milk Sea; the reason for this
is that twice a year the sea thereabouts turns white, and is called
by our people the white water. The so-called <i>little</i> white
water comes first with a dark or new moon, in the latter end of June;
the <i>great</i> or second white water also comes in with a similar
dark moon in August, sooner or later according as the south-east wind
sets in fresh. This wind at that time brings with it in those parts
unsettled rainy weather. By daytime the sea looks natural, but in the
night as white as milk or snow and so bright that it is nearly
impossible to distinguish the water from the sky. At that time it is
dangerous to navigate here in small vessels, the sea making, even in
calm weather, a great swell which from the brightness of the water
cannot be discovered before they reach it. This white water conies
first entirely from the south-east, about</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Clearly a mistake. The word means
Ceram.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 98}</u></p>

<p>where lie the islands of Babba, Tenimmer and Timor Laut, and
perhaps wholly from that great bay made by the South Land and New
Guinea. It continues thus till September, when it is gradually
carried by the wind and currents towards the west, in large broad
stripes passing by Amboina and Boero till about Bouton when it
gradually loses itself; this water keeps itself always distinct from
the sea water as if it were divided by a band, a fact which often
frightens inexperienced sailors at night as they think they are
running suddenly upon a great bank. No one has yet been able to
explain this wonder of nature, nor give cause of this quality of the
water to glitter at night. It is thought most probable that it arises
from sulphurous exhalations from the bottom of the sea, rising in
this rough weather to the surface; for that it is impregnated with
sulphur is shown to be likely by the number of sulphur mountains and
volcanoes found everywhere in the south-eastern islands and which
perhaps exist in great number in the South Land. All this, however,
is as yet uncertain; perhaps the chemists might be able to supply
some explanation upon the subject as they have the art of preparing
waters which give light in the night time.</p>

<p>"It may be here asked, what countries are Lucach, Beach and
Maletur, names inscribed in some of our maps, on some parts of that
country which we call South Land or Hollandia Nova. I reply that
these names are perhaps taken from the uncertain and ambiguous
narratives of voyages by Marcus Paulus and Vertomannus, who, perhaps
being led astray by the relations of others, have taken the large
island of Timor for the South Land; for in Timor the traces of the
word Maletur remain in Maleto, situated near Keylako, on the north
side of Timor. Thus far the abovementioned letter."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-10"></a>ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF CAPTAIN
WILLIAM DAMPIER ON THE COAST OF NEW HOLLAND, IN 1687-88,</h3>

<h4>BEING AN EXTRACT FROM HIS "NEW VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD," PUBLISHED
IN LOND., 1697, 8 vo., pp. 461.</h4>

<p>Being now clear of all the islands, we stood off south, intending
to touch at New Holland, a part of Terra Australia Incognita, to see
what that country would afford us. Indeed, as the winds were, we
could not now keep our intended course (which was first westerly and
then northerly) without going to New Holland, unless we had gone back
again among the islands; but this was not a good time of the year to
be among any islands to the south of the equator unless in a good
harbour.</p>

<p>The 31st day we were in latitude 13&deg; 26', still standing to
the southward, the wind bearing commonly very hard at west and, we
keeping upon it under two courses and our myen, and sometimes a
main-top-sail rift. About ten a clock at night we tackt and so to the
northward for fear of running on a shoal, which is laid down in our
drafts in latitude 13&deg; 50' or thereabouts; it bearing south by
west from the east end of Timor: and so the island bore from us by
our judgments and reckoning. At three a clock we tackt again and
stood S. by W. and S.S.W.</p>

<p>In the morning, assoon as it was day we saw the shoal right ahead;
it lies in 13&deg; 50' by all our reckonings. It is</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 100}</u></p>

<p>a small spit of land just appearing above the water's edge, with
several rocks about it, 8 or 10 feet above high water. It lies in a
triangular form, each side being about a league and a half. We
stemmed right with the middle of it and stood within half a mile of
the rocks and sounded but found no ground. Then we went about and
stood to the north two hours and then tackt and stood to the
southward again, thinking to weather it but could not. So we bore
away on the north side till we came to the east point giving the
rocks a small berth then we trimb'd sharp, and stood to the southward
passing close by it and sounded again but found no ground.</p>

<p>This shoal is laid down in our drafts not above sixteen or twenty
leagues from New Holland; but we did run afterwards sixty leagues due
south before we fell in with it: and I am very confident that no part
of New Holland hereabouts lyes so far northerly by forty leagues as
it is laid down in our drafts. For if New Holland were laid down
true, we must of necessity have been driven near forty leagues to the
westward of our course; but this is very improbable, that the current
should set so strong to the westward, seeing that we had such a
constant westerly wind. I grant that when the monsoon shifts first,
the current does not presently shift, but runs afterwards near a
month; but the monsoon had been shifted at least two months now. But
of the monsoons and other winds, and of the currents, elsewhere, in
their proper place. As to these here, I do rather believe that the
land is not laid down true, than that the current deceived us; for it
was more probable we should have been deceived before we met with the
shoal than afterwards: for on the coast of New Holland we found the
tides keeping their constant course, the flood running N. by E. and
the ebb S. by W.</p>

<p>The 4th day of January, 1688, we fell in with the land of New
Holland, in the latitude of 16&deg; 50', having, as I said</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 101}</u></p>

<p>before, made our course due south from the shoal that we past by
on the 31st day of December. We ran in close by it, and finding no
convenient anchorage, because it lies open to the N W., we ran along
shore to the eastward, steering N.E. by E., for so the land lies. We
steered thus about twelve leagues; and then came to a point of land,
from whence the land trends east and southerly for ten or twelve
leagues: but how afterwards I know not. About three leagues to the
eastward of this point there is a pretty deep bay, with abundance of
islands in it, and a very good place to anchor in or to hale ashore.
About a league to the eastward of that point of anchor January the
5th, 1688, two miles from the shore, in twenty-nine fathoms, good
hard sand and clean ground.</p>

<p>New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is not yet
determined whether it is an island or a main continent; but I am
certain that it joyns neither to Asia, Africa, nor America. This part
of it that we saw is all low even land, with sandy banks against the
sea, only the points are rocky, and so are some of the islands in
this bay.</p>

<p>The land is of a dry sandy soil, destitute of water, except you
make wells; yet producing divers sorts of trees: but the woods are
not thick, nor the trees very big. Most of the trees that we saw are
dragon-trees as wesupposed; and these, too, are the largest of any
where. They are about the bigness of our large apple trees, and about
the same height: and the rind is blackish, and somewhat rough. The
leaves are of a dark colour; the gum distils out of the knots or
cracks that are in the bodies of the trees. We compared it with some
gum dragon, or dragon's blood, that was aboard; and it was of the
same colour and taste. The other sorts of trees were not known by
anyof us. There was pretty long grass growing under the trees, but it
was very thin. We saw no trees that bore fruit or berries.</p>

<p>We saw no sort of animals, nor any track of beast, but</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 102}</u></p>

<p>once, and that seemed to be the tread of a beast as big as a great
mastiff dog. Here are a few small land birds, but none bigger than a
blackbird: and but few sea fowls. Neither is the sea very plentifully
stored with fish, unless you reckon the manatee and turtle as such.
Of these creatures there is plenty, but they are extraordinarily shy,
though the inhabitants cannot trouble them much, having neither boats
nor iron.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this country are the miserablest people in the
world. The Hodmadods of Monomatapa, though a nasty people, yet for
wealth are gentlemen to these; who have no houses and skin garments,
sheep, poultry, and fruits of the earth, ostrich eggs, etc., as the
Hodmadods have; and setting aside their human shape, they differ but
little from brutes. They are tall, straight-bodied and thin, with
small, long limbs. They have great head, round foreheads, and great
brows. Their eye-lids are always half closed, to keep the flies out
of their eyes, they being so troublesome here that no fanning will
keep, them from coming to one's face; and without the assistance of
both hands to keep them off, they will creep into ones nostrils, and
mouth, too, if the lips are not shut very close. So that, from their
infancy, being thus annoyed with these insects, they do never open
their eyes as other people do; and therefore they cannot see far,
unless they hold up their heads as if they were looking at somewhat
over them.</p>

<p>They have great bottle-noses, pretty full lips and wide mouths,
the two fore-teeth of their upper jaw are wanting in all of them, men
and women, old and young: neither have they any beards. They are
long-visaged, and of a very unpleasing aspect, having no one graceful
feature in their faces. Their hair is black, short, and curled, like
that of the negroes; and not long and lank like that common Indians.
The colour of their skins, both of their faces and the rest of their
body, is coal black, like that of the negroes of Guinea.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 103}</u></p>

<p>They have no sort of clothes, but the piece of the rind of a tree
ty'd lyke a girdle about their waists, and a handful of long grass,
or three or four small green boughs, full of leaves, thrust under
their girdle to cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>They have no houses, but lye in the open air without any covering
the earth being their bed and the heaven their canopy. Whether they
cohabit one to one woman, or promiscuously, I know not. But they do
live in companies, twenty or thirty men, women and children together.
Their only food is a small sort of fish, which they get by making
wares of stone across little coves or branches of the sea; every tide
bringing in the little fish, and there leaving them a prey to these
people, who constantly attend there to search at low water. This
small fry I take to be the top of their fishery: they have no
instruments to catch great fish, should they come, and such seldom
stay to be left behind at low water, nor could we catch any fish with
our hooks and lines all the while we lay there. In other places at
low water they seek for cockles, mussels and periwinkles. Of these
shell-fish there are fewer still so that their chiefest dependance is
upon what the sea leaves in their wares, which, be it much or little,
they gather up, and march to the places of their abode. There the old
people, that are not able to stir abroad by reason of their age, and
the tender infants, wait their return; and what Providence has
bestowed on them, they presently broil on the coals and eat it in
common. Sometimes they get as many fish as makes them a plentiful
banquet, and at other times they scarce get everyone a taste; but, be
it little or much that they get, every one has his part, as well the
young and tender as the old and feeble, who are not able to go abroad
as the strong and lusty. When they have eaten they lie down till the
next low water, and then all that are able march out be it night or
day, rain or shine, 'tis all one; they must attend the wares or else
they must fast, for the earth affords them no</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 104}</u></p>

<p>food at all. There is neither herb, root, pulse, nor any sort of
grain for them to eat that we saw; nor any sort of bird or beast that
they can catch, having no instruments where-withal to do so.</p>

<p>I did not perceive that they did worship anything. These poor
creatures have a sort of weapon to defend their ware or fight with
their enemies, if they have any that will interfere with their poor
fishery. They did endeavour with their weapons to frighten us who,
lying ashore, deterr'd them from one of their fishing places. Some of
them had wooden swords, others had a sort of lances. The sword is a
piece of wood shaped somewhat like a cutlass. The lance is a long
strait pole, sharp at one end, and hardened afterwards by heat. I saw
no iron, nor any other sort of metal; therefore it is probable they
use stone hatchets as some Indians in America do described in chapter
iv.</p>

<p>How they get their fire I know not but probably, as Indians do,
out of wood. I have seen the Indians of Bon-Airy do it, and have
myself tryed the experiment. They take a flat piece of wood, that is
pretty soft, and make a small dent in one side of it; then they take
another hard round stick, about the bigness of one's little finger,
and sharpening it at one end like a pencil, they put that sharp end
in the hole or dent of the soft flat piece, and then rubbing or
twirling the hard piece between the palms of their hands, they drill
the soft piece till it smokes, and at last takes fire.</p>

<p>These people speak somewhat through the throat, but we could not
understand one word that they said. We anchored, as I said before,
January the 5th, and seeing men walking on shore, we presently set a
canoe to get some acquaintance with them, for we were in hopes to get
some provisions among them. But the inhabitants, seeing our boat
coming, run away and hid themselves. We searched afterwards three
days, in hopes to find their houses; but</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 105}</u></p>

<p>found none; yet we saw many places where they had made fires. At
last, being out of hopes to find their habitations, we searched no
farther; but left a great many toys ashore, in such places where but
old wells on the sandy bays.</p>

<p>At last we went over to the islands, and there we found a great
many of the natives: I do believe there were forty on one island,
men, women, and children. The men, at our first coming ashore,
threatened us with their lances and swords; but they were frighted by
firing one gun, which we fired purposely to scare them. The island
was so small that they could not hide themselves; but they were much
disordered at our landing, especially the women and children, for we
went directly to their camp. The lustiest of the women, snatching up
their infants ran away howling, and the little children run after
squeaking and bawling, but the men stood still. Some of the women,
and such people as could not go from us, lay still by a fire, making
a doleful noise as if we had been coming to devour them; but when
they saw that we did not intend to harm them they were pretty quiet,
and the rest that fled from us at our first coming returned again.
This, their place of dwelling, was only a fire, with a few boughs
before it, set up on that side the wind was of.</p>

<p>After we had been here a little while the men began to be
familiar, and we clothed some of them, designing to have som e
service of them for it; for we found some wells of water here, and
intended to carry two or three barrels of it aboard. But being
somewhat troublesome to carry to the canoes, we thought to have made
these men to carry it for us, and therefore we gave them some
clothes; to one an old pair of breeches to another a ragged shirt, to
a third a jacket that was scarce worth owning, which yet would have
been very acceptable at some places where we had</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 106}</u></p>

<p>been, and so we thought they might have been with these people. We
put them on them, thinking that this finery would have brought them
heartily to work for us; and our water being filled in small long
barrels, about six gallons in each, which were made purposely to
carry water in, we brought these, our new servants to the wells, and
put a barrel on each of their shoulders for them to carry to the
canoe. But all the signs we could make were to no purpose, for they
stood like statues, without motion, but grinned like so many monkeys,
staring one upon another; for these poor creatures seem not
accustomed to carry burthens, and I believe that one of our ship boys
of ten years old would carry as much as one of them. So we were
forced to carry our water ourselves, and they very fairly put the
clothes off again and laid them down, as if clothes were only to work
in. I. did not perceive that they had any great liking to them at
first, neither did they seem to admire anything that we had.</p>

<p>At another time, our canoe being among these islands seeking for
game, espy'd a drove of these men swimming from one island to
another; for they have no boats, canoes, or bark logs. They took up
four of them and brought them aboard; two of them were middle-aged,
the other two were young men about eighteen or twenty years old. To
these we gave boiled rice, and with it turtle and manatee boiled.
They did greedily devour what we gave them, but took no notice of the
ship or any thing in it, and when they were set on land again they
ran away as fast as they could. At our first coming, before we were
acquainted with them or they with us, a company of them who lived on
the main came just against our ship, and standing on a pretty high
bank, threatened us with their swords and lances by shaking them at
us; at last the captain ordered the drum to be beaten, which was done
of a sudden with much vigour, purposely to scare the poor creatures.
They hearing the noise, ran away as fast as they could drive, and
when they ran</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 107}</u></p>

<p>away in haste they would cry, <i>Gurry, Gurry</i>, speaking deep
in the throat. Those inhabitants also that live on the main would
wander away from us, yet we took several of them. For, as I have
already observed, they had such bad eyes that they could not see us
till we came close to them. We did always give them victuals and let
them go again, but the islanders, after our first time of being among
them, did not stir for us.</p>

<p>When we had been here about a week, we hal'd our ship into a small
sandy cove, at a spring tide, as far as she would float; and at low
water she was left dry, and the sand dry without us near half a mile,
for the sea riseth and falleth here about five fathoms. The flood
runs north by east, and the ebb south by west. All the neep-tides we
lay wholly aground, for the sea did not come near us by about a
hundred yards. We had therefore time enough to clean our ship's
bottom, which we did very well. Most of our men lay ashore in a tent,
where our sails were mending; and our strikers brought home turtle
and manatee every day, which was our constant food.</p>

<p>While we lay here, I did endeavour to persuade our men to go to
some English factory, but was threatened to be turned ashore and left
here for it.</p>

<p>This made me disist, and patiently wait for some more convenient
place and opportunity to leave them than here; which I did hope I
would accomplish in a short time, because they did intend, when they
went from hence, to bear down towards Cape Comorin. In their way
thither they design'd to visit also the Island Cocos, which lieth in
latitude 12&deg; 12' north, by our drafts; hoping there to find of
that fruit, the island having its name from thence.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-11"></a>EXTRACT FROM SLOAN MS. 3236, ENTITLED "THE
ADVENTURES OF WILLIAM DAMPIER, WITH OTHERS [1686-87], WHO LEFT
CAPTAIN SHERPE IN THE SOUTH SEAS,</h3>

<h4>AND TRAVALED BACK OVER LAND THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF DARIEN," pp.
445 to 450.</h4>

<p>(December 1687-88)</p>

<p>We stood away to the southward, intending to see New Holland and
mett nothing worth observing till the first day of December, and then
being in latit. 13&deg; 50', wee were close aboard a showle which wee
lay by for in the night; it lyes S. by W. from the N.W. end of Timore
about seventy leagues. Wee steered to weather it but could not
therefore bore away to the eastward of it; it lyes in a triangle with
many sharp rocks about water, and on the south side is a small spitt
of land.</p>

<p>This showle is laid downe within twenty leagues of New Holland due
south, but wee made our course south, yett run into latitude 16&deg;
55' before wee made land which is forty odd leagues; so that by our
runn, except wee had a current against us which wee did not perceive,
New Holland is laid downe nearer then it should be to those islands
in the south seas by forty leagues.</p>

<p>The fourth day of January 1687-88 wee fell in with the land to New
Holland in latitude 16&deg; 55', the land low and a deepe sandy bay,
but no shelter for us therefore wee runn downe along the shore which
lyes N E. by E. about twelve</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 109}</u></p>

<p>leagues; then wee came to a point with an island by it, but soe
neare the maine that wee could not goe within it a league; to the
westward of this pointe is a showle a league from the maine.</p>

<p>From this pointe the land runs more easterly and makes a deepe bay
with many ilands in it; the sixth day wee came into this bay, and
anchored about foare miles to the eastward of the forementioned
pointe, in eighteen fathome water, a mile from the shoare, good clean
sand.</p>

<p>I drew a drafte of this land and the bay where we road, but at the
Necquebar<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, when we oversett our
prows, I lost it and some others that were not in my book; those that
I had placed in my book were all preserved but all wett.</p>

<p>Wee sent our boate ashoare to speak with the natives but they
would not abide our comeing, soe wee spent three dayes in seekeing
their houses, being in hopes to allure them with toyes to a
comerce.</p>

<p>For wee begun to be scarce of provision and did not questione but
these people could relieve us; but after all our search neare the sea
side and in the country wee found ourselves disapointed,' for the
people of this country have noe houses nor any thing like a house
neither have they any sorte of graine or pulse; fresh they have not
nor any sorte of cattle not soe much as catt or dog, for indeed they
have noe occasion of such creatures unless to eat them, for of that
food which they have they leave no fragments. They have noe sorte of
fowle neither tame nor wild for the latter I saw very few in the
country neither did wee see any kind of wilde beast in the country
but the track of one.</p>

<p>I believe there are not any of the natives in the country farm
from the sea, for they gett their living out of sea without nett or
hooke; but they build wares with stones cross</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Nicobar. The circumstance of their canoe upsetting
off this island, and their books and drafts being all wetted and some
of them lost, is also mentioned in the printed editions of Dampier's
voyage.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 110}</u></p>

<p>the bays, and every low water whether night or day they search
those wares for what the sea hath left behinde, which is all that
they have to depend on for livelyhood; some times they are
bountyfully rewarded for their paines' and at other times providence
seemes to be nigardly, scarce giving them a taste instead of a belly
full.' The fish which they take they carry home to their famelyes
whoe lye behinde a few, boughs stuck up to keep the wind from them.
All that are of age to search those wares goe downe at the time of
low water, leaving only the old sicke weake people and children at
home, who make a fire against the coming of their friends to broyle
their fish, which they soone devoure without salt or bread Their
habitations are neare those wares and remove as occasion serves, for
they are not troubled with household goods or clothes, all that they
weare is only a piece of rind about their wastes, under which they
thrust either a hand full of long grasse or some small boughs before
to cover their privityes.</p>

<p>They are people of good stature but very thin and leane I judge
for want of foode. They are black jett I believe their haires would
be long if it was corned out, but for want of combs it is matted up
like a negroes haire. They have all that I saw, two fore teeth of
their upper jaw wanting both men, women and children.</p>

<p>They swim from one iland to the other or toe and from the maine
and have for armes a lance sharpened at one end and burned in the
fire to harden it, and a sword made with wood, which is sharpe on one
side; these weapons, I judge, are cutt with stone hatchetts, as I
have seene in the West India.</p>

<p>The country is all low land, with sand hills by the sea side;
within it is a wood, but not extraordinary thicke; the chiefest trees
are dragon trees, which are bigger than any other trees in the woods:
wee found neither river, brooke, nor springs, but made wells in the
sand, which aforded as good water, where wee watered our ships.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 111}</u></p>

<p>The first spring after wee came hither wee hall'd our ship into a
sandy bay, where shee lay dry all the neepe tides, for it flows there
right up and downe above five fathome; the flood setts north by east
and the ebb setts S. by W.</p>

<p>There are many turtle and manatoe in this bay, which our strikers
supplyed us with all the time we lay there, and one time they mett
some of the natives swimming from one iland to the other and tooke up
foure of them and brought aboard, whoe tooke noe notice of any thing
that wee had noe more than a bruite would; wee gave them some
victualls, which they greedily devoured, and being sett out of the
ship ran away as fast as their leggs (for the ship was now dry on the
sand) could carry them. Wee mett divers of them on the ilands, for
they could not run from us there, but the women and children would be
frighted at our approach.</p>

<p>Wee tarried here till the twelfth day of February, in which time
wee cleaned our ship, mended our sailes, and filled our water and
when our time drew neare to depart from thence, I motioned goeing to
Fort St. George, or any settlement where the English had noe
fortification, and was threatened to be turned a shoare on New
Holland for it; which made me disist, intending, by God's blessing,
to make my escape the first place I came neare, for wee were now
bound into India for Cape Comorin, if wee could fetch it.</p>

WILLEM DE VLAMINGH TO NEW HOLLAND IN 1696.</h3>

<p align="center"><b><i>Extracted from MS. Documents at the
Hague.</i></b></p>

<p>Of this expedition, which owes its origin to the loss of the ship
<i>De Ridderschap van Hollandt</i>, between the Cape of Good Hope an
Batavia, in the year 1685, reports are to be found in various works,
as in Witsen, Valentijn, the <i>Historische Beschrijving der
Reizen</i>, perhaps also in some others. No coherent account,
however, appears to exist, although we read in the last-mentioned
work that a narrative of the voyage was published in 1701 at
Amsterdam<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>The project originally formed was that the expedition should set
out from Batavia, and the Directors of the Council of the Seventeen
write on this understanding in their dispatch of November 10th, 1695,
to the Governor-General and Council of India; but in the assembly of
December 8th and 10th of that year<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>
that plan was abandoned, and it was</p>

<blockquote>[*1) This exceedingly scarce printed narrative, which had
been zealously sought for by the editor for several years, and had
eluded the search of previous writers, reached his hands at the very
critical moment to admit of its being translated and inserted in its
proper place in the volume, the next in sequence to the present
paper. Although of no great interest except as an original account of
the voyage, it is important to know of what it consists, and it is
the editor's grateful duty to state that it is solely to the zeal,
intelligence, and kindness of Mr. Frederick M&uuml;ller, of
Amsterdam, that he is indebted for the good fortune of procuring the
use of the document.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*2) Appendix I and II.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 113}</u></p>

<p>resolved that "for various reasons" the expedition should be
undertaken from the Cape of Good Hope, under the command of William
de Vlamingh, with orders to land at the islands of Tristan d'Acunha,
on this side of the Cape, and also at the islands of St. Paul and
Amsterdam, to examine and to survey them.</p>

<p>For this purpose three ships were fitted out: the frigate De
<i>Geelvinck</i>, commodore Willem de Vlamingh; the hooker <i>De
Nijptang</i>, Captain Gerrit Collaert; and the galiot
<i>Weseltje</i>, Captain Cornelis de Vlamingh, son of the
commodore.</p>

<p>"On Thursday, the 2nd of May, 1696, at one o'clock in the morning,
the noble Burgomaster Hinlopen sent the Company's boat, having on
board the Commander Barent Fockesz, with orders that we should put to
sea at daybreak." They accordingly weighed anchor, and set sail
northwards towards England.</p>

<p>On the result of this expedition the Governor-General, and then
Council of India report to the Directors of the Council of Seventeen
as follows:--</p>

<p>"For the result of the voyage of the three above-mentioned ships
which, according to the order of the Gentlemen Seventeen of the 10th.
November,1695, and 16th of March, 1696, and according to your
instruction of the 23rd of April of the same year, have prosperously
completed their journey over the islands of Tristan d'Acunha, the
Cape islands of Amsterdam and St. Paulo, and have also arrived here,
both crew and vessels in a tolerably good condition, we shall
principally have to refer you to their journals and notes, together
with their maps and some drawings of those places; all of which, with
the draughtsman himself, the overseer of the infirmary Victor
Victorsz, will reach you by the ship's <i>Lants Welvaren</i>; the
drawings, packed up in one box, consisting of eleven pieces,
viz:--</p>

<pre>
7 of several places on the South Land.
1 of the island Tristan d'Acunha
1 of the island Amsterdam
1 of the island St. Paulo and
1 of the island Mony.
</pre>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 114}</u></p>

<p>"In addition to these we also enclose some big and small chips of
wood brought by Willem de Vlamingh from the before mentioned South
Land, and described in his journal under the 30th and 31st of
December 1696, and 2nd of January 1697, as a kind of scented wood.
Upon this we have not been able to come to any distinct decision; we
have, however, had a portion of it distilled and forward a small
bottle of the oil for your examination by Commander Bichon. Likewise
we send a little box containing shells, fruits, plants, etc.,
gathered on the coast; these specimens, however, are of less
importance and such as are to be found in a better condition
elsewhere in India. So that, generally speaking with respect to the
South Land along which in conformity with their instructions they
have coasted, and to which their accurate observations have been
devoted, nothing has been discovered but a barren, bare, desolate
region; at least along the coast, and so far as they have penetrated
into the interior. Neither have they met with any signs of
habitation, some fires excepted, and a few black naked men, supposed
to have been seen on two or three occasions at a distance, whom
however they could neither come up with nor speak to. Neither again
were any remarkable animals or birds observed, except principally in
the Swan River, a species of black swans three of which they brought
to us alive and should have been sent to Your Nobilities had they not
died one by one shortly after their arrival here. Neither, so far as
we know, have any traces been discovered of the missing ship <i>De
Ridderschap van Holland</i> or of other vessels either there or at
the islands Amsterdam and St. Paul. Consequently in this voyage and
investigation nothing of any importance has been discovered. A
singular memorial was seen by them, On an island situated on or near
the South Land, in 25&deg; latitude</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 115}</u></p>

<p>was found a pole nearly decayed but still standing upright, with a
common middle-sized tin plate, which had been beaten flat and
attached to the pole, and which was still lying near it. On this
plate the following engraved words were still legible:--</p>

<p>"Anno 1616, the 25th of October, arrived here the ship <i>De
Eendraght</i>, from Amsterdam, the upper-merchant Gilles Mibais from
Luijck, Captain Dirck Hartog from Amsterdam; the 27th ditto set sail
for Bantam, under-merchant Jan Hijn, upper-steersman Pieter Dockes
from 5?il. Anno 1616."</p>

<p>This old plate, brought to us by Willem de Vlamingh, we have now
handed over to the commander, in order that he might bring it to Your
Nobilities, and that you look and marvel how it remained through such
a number of years unaffected by air, rain or sun. They erected on the
same spot another pole with a fiat tin plate as a memorial and wrote
on it as to be read in the journals<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>And since we are desirous to afford Your Nobilities all possible
information and satisfaction with respect to this voyage, we have
given permission to its former chief, Captain Willem de Vlamingh the
elder with his upper-steersman Michel Blom to return with the last
return ships, As they have not come back yet from Bengal with their
vessels the <i>Geelvinch</i> and <i>Nijptang</i>, but are expected
daily we shall leave this for the present and refer you for further
information to their own verbal reports.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) "Further: '1697, February 4th. Arrived here the ship
<i>Geelvinck</i>, of Amsterdam: captain commandant, Wilhem van

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 116}</u></p>

<p>We al so found recorded in the notes of the above-mentioned
skipper, Willem de Vlamingh, that on the island of Mony, lying
10&deg; south latitude and 60-70 miles without Sunda Strait, by which
he steered on his way from the South Land hither, trees arc to be
found fit for if ships. No further explanation however being given as
to their abundance or scarcity or the kind of wood--a small niece
only about two spans in length and less than a finger breadth in
thickness, having been brought to us, and the skipper of the
<i>Nijptang</i> and the gezaghebber of the <i>Weseltje</i>, son of
the old Vlamingh, knowing nothing whatever about the subject, we, in
order to settle the point once for all, thought it not unadvisable to
set on foot a further investigation, and accordingly only more
despatched the galiot <i>Weseltje</i> on the 11th of May, in order
that a more minute survey might be taken of the island, adding at the
same time a reinforcement of eight native soldiers, with such
instructions for the steersman Cornelis de Vlamingh, as are to be
found in the letter-book under that date and also under Batavia.
According to the diary of the same steersman from May 12 to June 17
kept in the journey, in which they nearly got wrecked, and owing to
the heavy breakers could nowhere effect a landing, and from the
vessel and boat could not perceive anything else but thick brushwood
and a few small crooked trees, none of which was either straight or
more than three fathoms long; so that no expectation remained of
finding there anything useful.</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX I.</b></p>

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE XVII.</p>

<p><b>Thursday, December 8th, 1695.</b></p>

<p>The Commissioners of the Chamber of Amsterdam have reported, how
the said Chamber, in accordance with and to fulfil what their
Nobilities have by resolution of the 10th of last month have been
ordered to do concerning the sending of a ship to the South Land,' or
the land of d'Eendracht, having examined and also heard and taken the
advice of Commander Hendrich Pronck and Skipper Willem de Vlamingh,
is of opinion; firstly as regards the South Land, that for certain
reasons it should not be undertaken from Batavia, as previously
thought proper, and in favour of which this Assembly has declared
itself by its missive of Nov. 10 last, to the General and Council,
but from the Cape of Good Hope and on the 1st of Oct. next year; that
for this purpose should be equipped and prepared, in order to go to
sea next March, a frigate and two galiots, under command of and
accompanied by the before-mentioned skipper De Vlamingh, with such
instructions as should be deemed necessary, that the said frigate
should be provided with a Greenland shallop--supposed to be better
adapted for putting into harbour and landing than the ordinary
shallops in the use of the Company. Secondly that De Vlamingh should
be directed in his instructions to touch at the islands of St. Paul
and Amsterdam, as lying directly on his track on his way from the
cape to the South Land, to examine their situation and also whether
any traces of the crew of missing vessels especially of the
<i>Ridderschap van Hollandt</i>, are to be found.</p>

<p>After deliberation, the resolution was passed:--</p>

<p>That all the above written shall be further examined by
Commissioners and report to be made of their considerations and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 118}</u></p>

<p>resolutions and for which hereby are requested and commissioned:
from the Chamber Amsterdam, Messrs. Hooft, Geelvinck, Fabritius, and
Velsen; from the Chamber Zeelandt, Messrs. Boddart and Schorer; and
from the other Chambers, those who shall be commissioned by them;
with the addition of Mr. van Spanbrock from the principal
participators.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p><b>APPENDIX II</b></p>

<p>Saturday, December 10th, 1695.</p>

<p>Touching the report of the Commissioners, who in compliance with
the Commissarial resolution of the 8th c. have given due attention to
the subject of the search and inquiry after the ship <i>De
Ridderschap van Hollandt</i> and to the inquiry to be connected
therewith, viz., as to the nature of the South Land and of the
islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam and matters connected therewith,
together with the sending of an expedition thither for the purpose of
the inquiry;--on deliveration and in conformity with the advice of
the above-mentioned Commissioners, it has been resolved and found
good:--that the said voyage shall be undertaken not from Batavia as
has been heretofore thought good and in favour of which this Assembly
had given instructions in its missive to the General and Council from
the 10th of last month, and which is hereby altered in so far--but
from the Cape of Good Hope, and in the beginning of October next;
that for this purpose the Chamber Amsterdam shall equip and get ready
for sea by March next, a suitable frigate, 110-112 feet long, to be
built by the said Chamber and which is to have the name of
<i>Geelvinck</i>, together with two sailing galiots under the command
of and accompanied by the skipper Willem de Vlamingh, provided with
such necessaries' as shall be thought proper.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 119}</u></p>

<p>That furthermore the said De Vlamingh shall, if he can do so
without much loss of time and as it were <i>en passant</i>, touch at
the islands of Tristan d'Acunha, on this side of the Cape in 37'
south latitude to examine them as much as he can and under such
instructions as shall be handed over to him. The Chamber Amsterdam
being hereby once more requested and authorized to arrange and carry
into execution what has been said above with regard to the South Land
and Tristan d'Achuna and to prepare such instructions as shall be
thought proper. Lastly that De Vlamingh shall in his instructions be
ordered to touch on the islands St. Paul and Amsterdam, lying
directly on his track in....&deg; south latitude, and to examine
their situations; also whether any signs of men from wrecked ships
are to be found, especially from the <i>Ridderschap van
Hollandt</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-13"></a>EXTRACT FROM THE JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE MADE TO
THE UNEXPLORED SOUTH LAND, BY ORDER OF OF THE DUTCH EAST INDIA
COMPANY, IN THE YEARS 1696 AND 1697,</h3>

<h4>BY THE HOOKER DE NYPTANG, THE SHIP DE GEELVINK, THE GALIOT DE
WESEL AND THE RETURN TO BATAVIA<br>
 PRINTED AT AMSTERDAM, 1701.</h4>

<p>On the morning of the 29th December (1696) at half-past two
o'clock, we discovered the South Land, to east north-east of us at
from four to five miles distance. We found the country low, the main
coast stretching from south to north. Our people observed a
remarkable fish here, about two feet long, with a round head and a
sort of arms and legs and even something like hands. They found also
several stems of plants. They cast anchor in from fourteen to fifteen
fathoms. At nearly half a league from the island on the south side
that had good holding ground. The wind south-west by south.</p>

<p>On the 30th December we took counsel, and then with our guns on
our arms put the shallop afloat and with the chief pilot I went on
shore to look round the island. We rowed round to the east corner of
the island about a cannon shot distance from the coast, and found
there two fathoms water with muddy bottom, filled with shells, and
occasionally a sandy bottom, Proceeding a little further, we sounded
the little island bearing to the south of us, and the westernmost</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 121}</u></p>

<p>point of the large one bearing north-west of us; and we found five
fathoms, and good and bad bottom by turns. We afterwards sounded
north, the westernmost point bearing N.W. and by W. of us, and the
little island S.W.and had as before five-fathoms. At nearly a gun
shot from the shore we found on the south east coast of the island
seven or eight great rocks, the island being on this side of a rocky
and stony aspect, bearing north-east from us; then we had eight
fathoms both good and bad ground; with here and there a gulf, where
was a straight bank stretching from the coast up to the nearest rock
nearly three quarters of a mile from the coast. Along the east side
there are many capes and gulfs, with white sand, which is found also
round the greater part of the land. It stretches lengthwise from east
to west nearly four leagues, and is about nine leagues in
circumference.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December I again put on shore with our skipper, and
directing my steps into the interior of the island, 1 found several
sorts of herbs, the greater part of which were known to me, and some
of which resembled in smell those of our own country There were also
a variety of trees, and among them one sort the wood of which had an
aromatic odour nearly like that of the Lignum Rhodii. The ground is
covered with little or no soil, but chiefly with white and rocky
sand, in ray opinion little adapted for cultivation. There are very
few birds there and no animals, except a kind of rat as big as a
common cat, whose dung is found in abundance all over the island.
There are also very few seals or fish, except a sort of sardine and
grey rock bream. In the middle of the island, at about half an hour's
distance, we found several basins of excellent water, but brackish,
and six or seven paces further a fountain of fresh water fit to
drink. In returning to shore, the crew found a piece of wood from our
own country, in which the nails still remained. It was probably from
a shipwrecked vessel, and three or four</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 122}</u></p>

<p>leagues from us some smoke was seen to rise at different points of
the main land. The country had the appearance of being higher than it
really is. The coast is like that of Holland.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1697, the crew went to seek for fuel, and
again saw smoke rising at different points on the mainland. They
observed also the flow and ebb; and our sail-master found on the
shore a piece of planed wood about three feet long and a span
broad.</p>

<p>On the 2nd I again went on shore, with out skipper, to examine the
island on the west side, which we found similar to the last. It is to
be avoided for about a league, on account of the great numbers of
rocks along the coast; otherwise it is easily approachable, as from
six to seven leagues from the shore there are soundings at a hundred
fathoms. On the mainland we again saw smoke arising.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, after sunset, we saw a great number of fires burning,
the whole length of the coast on the mainland.</p>

<p>On the 4th, De Vlaming's boat made sail for the mainland. On its
return a council was held with the view of making an expedition to
the shore on the morrow. N.B. Here we have, the headlands
inaccurately indicated.</p>

<p>At sunrise on the morning of the 5th, the resolution which had
been taken was put into execution; and I, in company with the
skipper, pushed off to the mainiand with the boats of the three South
Land Navigators. We mustered, what with soldiers and sailors, and two
of the blacks that we had taken with us at the Cape, eighty-six
strong well armed and equipped. We proceeded eastwards; and after an
hour's march, we came to a hut of a worse description than those of
the Hottentots. Further on was a large basin of brackish water, which
we afterwards found was a river; on the bank of which were several
footsteps of men, and several small pools; in which was, fresh water,
or but slightly brackish. In spite of our repeated searches, however,
we found no men.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 123}</u></p>

<p>Towards evening we determined to pass the night on shore, and
pitched our camp in the wood, in a place where we found a fire which
had been lighted by the inhabitants, but whom, nevertheless, we did
not see. We fed the fire by throwing on wood, and each quarter of an
hour four of our people kept watch.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th at sunrise, we divided ourselves into
three companies, each taking a different route, to try if we could
not, by this means, find some men. After three or four hours we
rejoined each other near the river, without discovering anything
beyond some huts and footsteps. Upon which we betook ourselves to
rest. Meanwhile they brought me the nut of a certain fruit tree,
resembling in form the <i>drioens</i>,<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> having the taste of our large Dutch beans;
and those which were younger were like a walnut. I ate five or six of
them, and drank the water from the small pools; but, after an
interval of about three hours, I and five others who had eaten of
these fruits began to vomit so violently that we were as dead men; so
that it was with the greatest difficulty that I and the crew regained
the shore, and thence in company with the skipper, were put on board
the galliot, leaving the rest on shore.</p>

<p>On the 7th the whole of the crew returned on board with the boats,
bringing with them two young black swans. The mouth of the said river
lies in 31&deg; 46'; and at eleven, nine, and seven gunshots from the
mainland, are five and a half fathoms of water on good bottom.
Between the river and Rottenest Island, which is at nearly five
leagues distance, Captain De Vlaming had the misfortune to break his
cable.</p>

<p>On the 9th, De Vlaming made sail for the mainland.</p>

<p>On the 10th we followed him with the galliot, and cast anchor off
the mainland, in thirteen fathoms. A council was</p>

<blockquote>[*1) This word, which is perhaps misspelt, does not occur
in Nemnick's polyglot <i>Lexicon der
Naturgeschichte</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 124}</u></p>

<p>immediately held, and orders forthwith given to proceed to explore
the river with two of the galliot's boats. The galliot remained in
the neighbourhood before the river, while we went up it with three
boats well supplied with guns and ammunition. We found, at the mouth,
from five to six feet of water. We remained a little time on the
shore, and put ourselves on the alert, not to be surprised by the
natives. After sunset we ascended the river, and overcame the current
with our oars; seeing several fires, but no men. About midnight we
threw out our kedge, as we saw no opening although it was
moonlight.</p>

<p>On the 11th, at break of day, we again ascended the river, and saw
many swans (our boat knocked over nine or ten) some rotganzen, geese,
some divers, etc., also a quantity of fish, which were frisking on
the water. We also heard the song of the nightingale. Here we thought
we saw a crowd of men; but after rowing on shore we found none, but
lighted on a little pool of fresh water, and within it, at the
bottom, a certain herb smelling like thyme; which was, perhaps, put
into it by the inhabitants, to give the water a more agreeable taste,
and make it more wholesome. All around we saw many footsteps of men,
and the impression of a hand on the sand; the marks of the thumb and
fingers shewing plainly that it was quite recently done. Proceeding
further, we found a fire which had been just lighted, and three small
huts, one of which was made with a quantity of bark of a tree known
in India under the name of <i>liplap</i>, which, I think, was
intended for a battery. For want of water, we could not go any
further south, and being nearly high and dry withthe boats in the
sand, we resolved, to return, having already ascended the river six
or seven leagues (some thought it was ten) without having discovered
anything of importance. Towards the evening we again went on shore to
see if, towards midnight, we could take the inhabitants by surprise;
but not having been able to attain our object,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 125}</u></p>

<p>and the moon meanwhile rising, we allowed ourselves to glide
gently along the river.</p>

<p>On the 12th, two hours before sunrise, seeing several fires, I
again went on shore with our chief pilot, some sailors and the two
blacks above mentioned, We observed eight, and around each of them a
heap of branches of trees, but no men. As it was, therefore, evident
that there was no good to be done here, we returned to our vessel,
which we reached about noon. As regards the country, it is sandy, and
in the place where we were had been planted with a good many shrubs,
among which were some quite three and four fathoms (vademen) thick
but bearing no fruit,--in short, full of prickles and thorns. Several
of these yielded a gum nearly like wax, of a brownish red colour. The
men, the birds, the swans, the rotganzen, koopganzen, the geese, the
cockatooes, the parroquets, etc., all fled at the sight of us. The
best of it is that no vermin is found there; but in the day time one
is terribly tormented with the flies.</p>

<p>On the 13th, in the morning before daybreak, we held a council;
and in order to be able to take soundings nearer the coast, the
galliot and two boats made sail at about three o'clock in the morning
watch. We took our course, therefore, along the coast most frequently
N.N.W., sometimes a little north and west. We were in 31&deg; 43'
latitude, and sounded generally at a cannon-shot or a cannon shot and
a half from the coast. Here and there we came to several large rocks,
and had fifteen, twelve, nine, and eight fathoms water. Towards noon
we passed an opening which, might well have been a river; and towards
sunset we again made sail for the coast.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th we again made sail for the coast, and
found the same depth as before but principally fifteen fathoms of
brackish water, being then in 30&deg; and 40' latitude.</p>

<p>On the 15th, after having held a council, we made sail</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 126}</u></p>

<p>along the coast, and found the latitude 30&deg; 17'. In different
places towards the south we saw a great smoke and vapour arising, and
we went with our boats on shore, and we found nearly a league from
the shore, a rock; and a gunshot from thence two fathoms water, and
from that to the coast four, five, six, three, two and a three, five,
eight, five, three, and two fathoms, mostly foul bottom, not adapted
for anchoring; and on the south-west side there are generally
breakers. There two corners extend south and north from the gulf; the
soil dry and sandy, and but little adapted for the habitation of
animals, still less of men. We had nearly proceeded a league and a
half inland, but we saw no men nor fresh water, but several footsteps
of men, and steps like those of a dog and of the cassowary. Nor did
we see any trees, but only briars and thorns. One of our people said
that he had seen a red serpent. Some others said that as soon as we
reached the shore, they saw a yellow dog leaping from the wild
herbage, and throwing itself into the sea, as if to amuse himself
with swimming. What truth there was in these statements, I do not
know. At all events I did not see either of these things myself. At
two o'clock we returned with our chief pilot on board.</p>

<p>On the 16th my companion went with the boats ashore, and marched
onwards with his crew in order for one hour and a half; but returned
on board in the evening without having made any discovery.</p>

<p>On the 17th the boats returned on shore, and directed their course
then more towards the south than they had hitherto done, and brought
on board from an island a quantity of sea-mews. The latitude 30&deg;
42 minutes. Nothing new.</p>

<p>The 20th, returning to the shore, I found nothing but a great
plain very barren; many rocks on the coast; and the depth sixteen,
fourteen, eleven, eight, six, five, three, and two fathoms; the
anchorage difficult.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 127}</u></p>

<p>On the 21st our boat once more went on shore, but without learning
anything new. The latitude was 29&deg; 47'. Along the coast, the wind
south; the course N. and N.N.W. Towards evening we saw breakers
ahead, and sounded twenty-six, twenty, sixteen, and suddenly three
fathoms. We held close on the wind, and immediately got greater
depth. It was a reef, which stretched four or five leagues from the
coast.</p>

<p>On the 22nd I started for the shore with our under-pilot. Being
nearly three leagues from the coast, and sailing along it for some
leagues, we found, close under the shore, ten and nine fathoms; a
steep coast with constant breakers. On landing we found, et two
hundred paces from the shore, a brackish stream, along which we
walked landwards for a quarter of an hour. The middle was rather
deep, and the fish pretty plentiful. We should have followed it
further, but, the time being too short, we returned, and on the road
saw many footprints like those of a dog; but saw no men, nor animals,
nor trees, the country here being twice ac barren as what we had
before seen. Towards evening we returned together on board.</p>

<p>On the 21st (<i>sic</i>) our boat again made sail for the land,
and keeping along the shore, we found that here, in between 28 and
29&deg;, tolerably good anchorage might be found. The land is
tolerably high. Our chief pilot returning on board after dinner,
informed us that he had seen on the shore three or four men, and
several more on the little downs beyond, all quite naked, black, and
of our own height; but that he had not been able to get near them on
account of the current; that afterwards, rowing a little further,
they had landed and found a lake, which extended far into the country
like a river. It was of brackish taste, and though white had a
reddish tinge caused by the bottom, which was of red sand and mud. At
noon we were in latitude 28&deg; 16'; and at five o'clock, after
dinner, we</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 128}</u></p>

<p>anchored in a gulf, in eighteen fathoms water, good holding
ground, sand and mud, at about a cannon's shot from the shore.</p>

<p>On the 25th, early in the morning, I landed with nine of our crew,
our under pilot, together with the commandant of De Vlaming's
soldiers, his Dardewaak, and thirty-one soldiers. On reaching the
shore, we found a good many oysters; we put ourselves in marching
order, but from the fatigue occasioned by the excessive heat, and the
obstructions on the road from brushwood, we were obliged occasionally
to rest ourselves, till we reached the mountains, where we took our
rest. But if the road had been difficult, a greater trouble was yet
in store for us; for finding no fresh water, we thought we should
have fainted with thirst, From this point we could see our vessels,
and wished a thousand times over that we were on board again.
However, the commandant of the soldiers, with two men, went down, and
soon came up to us again, with a look of satisfaction, bringing news
that he had discovered some fresh water, and also a little hut, and
about an hour's distance from our camp, some footsteps, of the length
of eighteen inches; upon which we resolved, although it was beginning
to be dark, to bend our steps in that direction, an effort which,
from the quantity of brushwood and the approach of night, could not
be made without much difficulty. On arriving at the drinking place,
we found a great pool, but the water was slightly brackish. We
encamped there, and having arranged that there should be a soldier
constantly on the watch as sentry, we passed the night there in the
best manner we could.</p>

<p>On the 26th, in the morning before sunrise, we continued our
journey, and shortly reached the aforesaid little hut, which had a
good many egg-shells around it, but the eighteen inch footsteps
changed into ordinary ones. This night also re remained on shore, and
encamped again near the pool.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 129}</u></p>

<p>Although we were divided, we met with no men nor cattle, but
nothing but wild brushwood.</p>

<p>On the 27th, at the point of day, we betook ourselves to the
shore, and thence to our vessels, which we reached near noon: the
crew complained greatly of sore eyes.</p>

<p>On the 28th, having held a council before sunrise, we braced our
sails, and put to sea an hour and a half after dinner, the wind being
S.S.W. quarter W. in latitude, in 27&deg; 50'. Shortly after, we
again steered for the coast N.E., and by N. to N.W. and N.N.W.,
hugging the shore.</p>

<p>The 29th we still kept along the shore, the land high and rocky
latitude 27&deg; 40'.</p>

<p>The 30th the land rather high, until five o'clock in the afternoon
watch, when we cast anchor in an extensive gulf, which probably must
have been that named "Dirk Hartog's Reede."</p>

<p>On the 31st, two boats entered the gulf to explore it, and two
others to go fishing, which brought back in the evening a good
quantity. The same evening the chief pilot reported that they had
been in the gulf, but had seen nothing further to shew whether the
part to the north of the gulf were an island or not. They saw there a
number of turtles.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, early in the morning, our little boat went
to the coast to fish: our chief pilot, 'with De Vlaming's boat again
went into the gulf, and our skipper went on shore to fix up a
commemorative tablet.</p>

<p>On the 2nd, we took three great sharks, one of which had nearly
thirteen little ones, of the size of a large pike. The two captains
(for De Vlaming had also gone on shore) returned on board late in the
evening, having been a good six or seven leagues a way. Our capttain
brought with him a large bird's head and related that he had seen two
nests, made of boughs, which were full three fathoms in
circumference.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 130}</u></p>

<p>On the 3rd, Vlaming's chief pilot returned on board, he reported
that he had explored eighteen leagues, and that it was an island. He
brought with him a tin plate, which in the lapse of time had fallen
from a post to which it had been attached, and on which was cut the
name of the captain, Dirk Hartog, as well as the names of the first
and second merchants, and of the chief pilot of the vessel <i>De
Eendragt</i>, which arrived here in the year 1616, on the 25th
October, and left for Bantam on the 27th of the same month.</p>

<p>On the 4th of February, before daylight, we set sail, steering our
course along the island and at half-past two in the afternoon, we
cast anchor in sixteen fathoms on the N.E. of Dirk Hartog's Reede,
the gulf above mentioned in the latitude of 25&deg; 40'. The two
boats took soundings all along the coast, N.E. and by N.W., but could
not see the country for the fog.</p>

<p>On the 5th, we took five turtles on the island, and having then
held a council, and prepared and provisioned our vessel and that of
De Vlaming, we, that is, our captain, under-pilot, and myself, and De
Vlaming with his Dardewaak and under-master and oarsmen, with
close-reefed sails, the wind being at south and rather high, set
sail, steering along the island, where we landed at nightfall at
nearly four or five leagues distance from our vessels.</p>

<p>On the 6th, still a good deal of wind. This day we made but little
progress and returned on shore at night. We saw a great many turtles,
and in the corner of a rock a very large nest, made like a stork's
nest.</p>

<p>On the 7th, a good wind. In the evening we took a fish of immense
size, of which twenty-four of us partook. It had exactly the natural
taste of the ray. There remained enough for thirty more persons to
feed on. We slept on shore.</p>

<p>The 8th, in the morning, fair weather. We set sail for what the
chief pilot had pointed out to us a river, and up which we proceeded
full three leagues, but found it to be different</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 131}</u></p>

<p>from what it appeared. There were, in fact, two rivers, which, for
some time invisible, afterwards reappeared and formed an island
eastwards, a full half league from the coast, in three, two, and one
feet of water, surrounded on all sides by rocks, and sand, and
stones. We presently returned, being prevented by the drought from
approaching within half a league of the shore. We had a heavy storm,
and received the first rain of the South Land. In the evening we
returned on shore and encamped in a very unpropitious spot, at once
barren and wild.</p>

<p>On the 9th we steered for the mainland, which we reached near
noon. This coast extends with a winding N.E. to N. and S.W. to S. The
coast is steep, the sand of a reddish colour, rocky, dry and
forbidding. In order to get some good water, we made the crew dig
several holes, but the water was so salt that it could not be drunk
without injury to health. We saw several ducks. Sailing, along the
coast, we reached a basin of water, like a river, which gave us great
hope of getting some fresh water. Therefore with the flow we
weathered the cape, and after sailing half-an-hour reached a basin of
round form, but in which we only found salt water. All round it we
dug several holes, but, in spite of all our labour, we could find no
fresh water. This night we spent in the boat and De Vlaming on shore.
Thunder, lightning and rain.</p>

<p>On the 10th of February, after midnight, withthe high tide, we set
sail from the above-mentioned basin of water, and then, as before,
kept along the coast at the distance of three or four leagues. Again
we went ashore, ascended a mountain, saw a valley, and beyond it a
water course. Two men immediately ran in haste to dig, but nowhere
found fresh water, although they saw all about several footprints of
men. Setting sail from hence we returned on board three hours after
sunset and learned that on Friday, the 8th of the month, our vessels
had been compelled by the driving of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 132}</u></p>

<p>the sea to put out a league and a half from the shore, and had
cast anchor in seventeen fathoms; the shallop of the galliot had
upset and the carpenter was drowned, and De Vlaming's boat damaged.
From De Vlaming's vessel two dead men had been cast into the sea on
the same day.</p>

<p>On the 11th, De Vlaming came on board in the morning. Having
passed all the night in a stormy sea, in latitude 25&deg; 22' and
being unable to cast anchor, we were compelled to make sail.</p>

<p>On the 12th we held a council; and before noon made sail, holding
our course toward the north north-east and north along the coast, and
in the evening giving it a wide berth.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th we made sail for the coast, which bore
off us S. and N., and before noon saw a cape and three island two of
which were but small. Turning the cape, we held close on the wind in
a great winding of the coast, on the southward tack, and on various
tacks 17, 15, 12, and 9 to 4 fathoms water. At five o'clock in the
afternoon we made our course W. to S. with a south wind, latitude
24&deg;, 40'. In the evening we cast anchor.</p>

<p>During the 14th we tacked continually all day, and in the evening
cast anchor.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, in weighing anchor our cable would not
hold, but we saved our anchor. We set sail and cast anchor in the
evening.</p>

<p>On the 16th we were tacking till the afternoon, steering towards
the north with a south wind, the shore bearing from us to the west,
but we kept afloat that night.</p>

<p>On the 17th we again neared the coast, which we held close,
sailing smartly with a south wind. The coast stretched south and
north. We were in 24&deg; latitude, and the compass we laid at
5&deg;.</p>

<p>On the 18th, in the morning, we braced our sails and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 133}</u></p>

<p>steered along the coast N.N.W.and N.W.Towards noon we saw breakers
ashore. We were in latitude 22&deg;, 26', and we were tacking the
whole day.</p>

<p>On the 19th, in the morning, we again kept along the coast, the
land more or less steep, but very low toward the south. Our course
N.E. We saw a considerably larger cape, from which a bank stretched
out into the sea. We kept close on the wind which was at S.W., and
found ourselves in latitude 21&deg;, 34'. When we had passed the cape
we came to the end of the coast, and reached the river known as
William's River, and sailing up it, found ground but little suited
for anchoring. We therefore put out for the sea.</p>

<p>On the 20th we tacked towards De Vlaming, and in the evening cast
anchor near him. Latitude 21&deg;, 28'. We held another council.</p>

<p>On the 21st, in the morning, we put to sea towards the N.W.
latitude 21 degrees. Held once more a council. Received from De
Vlaming three half barrels of water. Half-an-hour after sun-rise, our
captain came from on board De Vlaming's vessel, from which five
cannon shot were fired and three from our vessel, as a signal of
farewell to the miserable South Land; and we steered our course
N.N.W., in 135&deg; of longitude from the South Land.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-14"></a>ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF CAPTAIN
WILLIAM DAMPIER ON THE COAST OF NEW HOLLAND IN 1699,</h3>

<h4>BEING AN EXTRACT FROM "A VOYAGE TO NEW HOLLAND, ETC., IN THE YEAR
1699."<br>
<br>
Vol. III, 3rd ed., 1729 pp.75-107.</h4>

<p>Having fair weather and the winds hanging southerly I jog'd on to
the eastward to make the Cape. On the third of June we saw a sail to
leeward of us, showing English colours. I bore away to speak with
her, and found her to be the <i>Antelope</i> of London, commanded by
Captain Hammond, and bound for the Bay of Bengal in the service of
the New-East-India Company. There were many passengers aboard, going
to settle there under Sir Edward Littleton, who was going chief
thither: I went aboard and was known by Sir Edward and Mr. Hedges,
and kindly received and treated by them and the commander; who had
been afraid of us before, though I had sent one of my officers
aboard. They had been in at the Cape, and came from thence the day
before, having stocked themselves with refreshments. They told me
that they were by reckoning 60 miles to the west of the Cape. While I
was aboard them a fine small westerly wind sprang up; therefore I
shortened my stay with them because I did not design to go in to the
Cape. When I took leave I was presented with half a mutton, 12
cabbages, 12 pumpkins, 6 pound of butter, 6 couple</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 135}</u></p>

<p>of stock-fish, and a quantity of parsnips; sending them some
oatmeal which they wanted.</p>

<p>From my first setting out from England I did not design to touch
at the Cape; and that was one reason why I touched at Brazil, that
there I might refresh my men and prepare them for a long run to New
Holland. We had not yet seen the land, but about 2 in the afternoon
we saw the Cape land bearing east at about 16 leagues distance: and,
Captain Hammond being also bound to double the Cape, we jog'd on
together this afternoon and the next day, and had several fair sights
of it; which may lay ahead.</p>

<p>To proceed: having still a westerly wind I jog'd on in company
with the <i>Antelope</i> till Sunday June the 4th, at 4 in the
afternoon, when we parted; they steering away for the East Indies and
I keeping an east-south-east course, the better to make my way for
New Holland: for though New Holland lies north-easterly from the Cape
yet all ships bound towards the coast, or the Straits of Sunda, ought
to keep for a while in the same parallel, or in a latitude between 35
and 40, at least a little to the south of the east, that they may
continue in a variable winds way; and not venture too soon to stand
so far to the north as to be within the verge of the tradewind, which
will put them by their easterly course. The wind increased upon us;
but we had yet sight of the <i>Antelope</i>, and of the land too,
till Tuesday the 6th June: and then we saw also by us an innumerable
company of fowls of divers sorts; so that we looked about to see if
there were not another dead whale, but saw none.</p>

<p>The night before, the sun set in a black cloud, which appeared
just like land, and the clouds above it were gilded of a dark red
colour. And on the Tuesday, as the sun drew near the horizon, the
clouds were gilded very prettily to the eye, though at the same time
my mind dreaded</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 136}</u></p>

<p>the consequences of it. When the sun was now not above 2&deg; high
it entered into a dark smoky-coloured cloud that lay parallel with
the horizon, from whence presently seemed to issue many dusky
blackish beams. The sky was at this time covered with small hard
clouds (as we call such a lie scattering about, not likely to rain)
very thick one by another; and such of them as lay next to the bank
of clouds at the horizon were of a pure gold colour to 3 or 4&deg;
high above the bank. From these to about 10&deg; high they were
redder and very bright; above them they were of a darker colour
still, to about 60 or 70&deg; high, where the clouds began to be of
their common colour. I took the more particular notice of all this
because I have generally observed such coloured clouds to appear
before an approaching storm: and, this being winter here and the time
for bad weather, I expected and provided for a violent blast of wind
by reefing our topsails, and giving a strict charge to my officers to
hand them or take them in if the wind should grow stronger. The wind
was now at west-north-west a very brisk gale. About 12 o'clock at
night we had a pale whitish glare in the north-west which was another
sign, and intimated the storm be near at hand; and, the wind
increasing upon it, we presently handed our topsails, furled the
mainsail, and went away only with our foresail. Before 2 in the
morning it came on very fierce, and we kept right before wind and
sea, the wind still increasing: but the ship was very governable, and
steered incomparably well. At 8 in the morning we settled our
foreyard, lowering it 4 or 5 foot, and we ran very swiftly;
especially when the squalls of rain or hail from a black cloud came
overhead, for then it blew excessive hard. These, though they did not
last long, yet came very thick and fast one after another. The sea
also ran very high; but we running so violently before wind and sea
we shipped little or no water; though a little washed into our</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 137}</u></p>

<p>upper deck ports; and with it a scuttle or cuttlefish was cast up
on the carriage of a gun.</p>

<p>The wind blew extraordinary hard all Wednesday the 7th of June but
abated of its fierceness before night: yet it continued a brisk gale
till about the 16th, and still a moderate one till the 19th day; by
which time we had run about 600 leagues: for the most part of which
time the wind was in some point of the west, namely from the
west-north-west to the south by west. It blew hardest when at west or
between the west and south-west, but after it veered more southerly
the foul weather broke up: this I observed at other times also in
these seas, that when the storms at west veered to the southward they
grew less; and that when the wind came to the east of the south we
had still smaller gales, calms, and fair weather. As for the westerly
winds on that side the Cape, we like them never the worse for being
violent, for they drive us the faster to the eastward; and are
therefore the only winds coveted by those who sail towards such parts
of the East Indies as lie south of the equator; as Timor, Java, and
Sumatra; and by the ships bound for China, or any other that are to
pass through the Straits of Sunda. Those ships having once passed the
Cape keep commonly pretty far southerly, on purpose to meet with
these west winds, which in the winter season of these climates they
soon meet with; for then the winds are generally westerly at the
Cape, and especially to the southward of it: but in their summer
months they get to the southward of 40&deg; usually ere they meet
with the westerly winds. I was not at this time in a higher latitude
than 36&deg; 40', and oftentimes was more northerly, altering my
latitude often as winds and weather required; for in such long runs
it is best to shape one's course according to the winds. And if in
steering to the east we should be obliged to bear a little to the
north or south of it it is no great matter; for it is but sailing 2
or 3 points from the wind, when 'tis</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 137}</u></p>

<p>either northerly or southerly; and this not only eases the ship
from straining but shortens the way more than if a ship was kept
close on a wind, as some men are fond of doing.</p>

<p>On 19th of June we were in latitude 34&deg; 17' south and
longitude from the Cape 39&deg; 24' east, and had small gales and
calms. The winds were at north-east by east and continued in some
part of the east till the 27th day. When it having been some time at
north-north-east it came about at north and then to the west of the
north, and continued in the west-board (between the north-north-west
and south-south-west) till the 4th of July; in which time we ran 782
miles; then the winds came about again to the east, we reckoning
ourselves to be in a meridian 1100 leagues east of the Cape; and,
having fair weather, sounded, but had no ground.</p>

<p>We met with little of remark in this voyage, besides being
accompanied with fowls all the way, especially pintado-birds, and
seeing now and then a whale: but as we drew nigher the coast of New
Holland we saw frequently 3 or 4 whales together. When we were about
90 leagues from the land we began to see seaweeds, all of one sort;
and as we drew nigher the shore we saw them more frequently. At about
30 leagues distance we began to see some scuttle-bones floating on
the water; and drawing still nigher the land we saw greater
quantities of them.</p>

<p>July 25th, being in latitude 26&deg; 14' south and longitude east
from the Cape of Good Hope 85&deg; 52', we saw a large garfish leap 4
times by us, which seemed to be as big as a porpoise. It was now very
fair weather, and the sea was full of a sort of very small grass or
moss, which as it floated in the water seemed to have been some spawn
of fish; and there was among it some small fry. The next day the sea
was full of small round things like pearl, some as big as white peas;
they</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 139}</u></p>

<p>were very clear and transparent, and upon crushing any of them a
drop of water would come forth: the skin that contained the water was
so thin that it was but just discernable. Some weeds swam by us so
that we did not doubt but we should quickly see land. On the 27th
also some weeds swam by us, and the birds that had flown along with
us all the way almost from Brazil now left us, except only 2 or 3
shearwaters. On the 28th we saw many weeds swim by us and some
whales, blowing. On the 29th we had dark cloudy weather with much
thunder, lightning, and violent rains in the morning; but in the
evening it grew fair. We saw this day a scuttle-bone swim by us, and
some of our young men a seal, as it should seem by their description
of its head. I saw also some bonetas, and some skipjacks, a fish
about 8 inches long, broad, and sizable, not much unlike a roach;
which our seamen call so from their leaping about.</p>

<p>The 30th of July, being still nearer the land, we saw abundance of
scuttle-bones and seaweed, more tokens that we were not far from it;
and saw also a sort of fowls, the like of which we had not seen in
the whole voyage, all the other fowls having now left us. These were
as big as lapwings; of a grey colour, black about their eyes, with
red sharp bills, long wings, their tails long and forked like
swallows; and they flew flapping their wings like lapwings. In the
afternoon we met with a rippling tide or current, or the water of
some shoal or overfall; but were past it before we could sound. The
birds last mentioned and this were further signs of land. In the
evening we had fair weather and a small gale at west. At 8 o'clock we
sounded again; but had no ground.</p>

<p>We kept on still to the eastward, with an easy sail looking out
sharp: for by the many signs we had I did expect that we were near
the land. At 12 o'clock in the night I sounded and had 45 fathom,
coarse sand and small</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 140}</u></p>

<p>white shells. I presently clapped on a wind and stood to the
south, with the wind at west, because I thought we were to the south
of a shoal called the Abrolhos (an appellative name for shoals as it
seems to me) which in a chart I had of that coast is laid down in
27&deg; 28' latitude stretching about 7 leagues into the sea. I was
the day before in 27&deg; 38' by reckoning. And afterwards, steering
east by south purposely to avoid it, I thought I must have been to
the south of it: but sounding again at 1 o'clock in the morning
August the first, we had but 25 fathom, coral rocks; and so found the
shoal was to the south of us. We presently tacked again, and stood to
the north, and then soon deepened our water; for at 2 in the morning
we had 26 fathom coral still: at 3 we had 28 coral ground: at 4 we
had 30 fathom, coarse sand, with some coral: at 5 we had 45 fathom,
coarse sand and shells; being now off the shoal, as appeared by the
sand and shells, and by having left the coral. By all this I knew we
had fallen into the north of the shoal, and that it was laid down
wrong in my sea-chart: for I found it lie in about 27&deg; latitude,
and by our run in the next day I found that the outward edge of it,
which I sounded on, lies 16 leagues off shore. When it was day we
steered in east-north-east with a fine brisk gale; but did not see
the land till 9 in the morning, when we saw it from our topmast-head,
and were distant from it about 10 leagues; having then 40 fathom
water, and clean sand. About 3 hours after we saw it on our
quarter-deck, being by judgment about 6 leagues off, and we had then
40 fathom, clean sand. As we ran in this day and the next we took
several sights of it, at different bearings and distances; from which
it appeared as you see. And here I would note once for all that the
latitudes marked in the draughts, or sights here given, are not the
latitude of the land, but of the ship when the sight was taken. This
morning, August the first, as we were standing in, we saw several
large seafowls, like our gannets on the coast of England, flying 3 or
4 together; and a sort of white seamews, but black about the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 141}</u></p>

<p>eyes, and with forked tails. We strove to run in near the shore to
seek for a harbour to refresh us after our tedious voyage; having
made one continued stretch from Brazil hither of about 114&deg;
designing from hence also to begin the discovery I had a mind to make
on New Holland and New Guinea. The land was low, and appeared even,
and as we drew nearer to it, it made(as you see in Table iv, No. 3,
4, 5)<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> with some red and some white
cliffs; these last in latitude 26 10 south, where you will find 54
fathom within 4 miles of the shore.</p>

<p>About the latitude of 26&deg; south we saw an opening, and ran in,
hoping to find a harbour there: but when we came to its mouth, which
was about 2 leagues wide, we saw rocks and foul ground within, and
therefore stood out again: there we had 20 fathom water within 2 mile
of the shore. The land everywhere appeared pretty low, flat and even;
but with steep cliffs to the sea; and when we came near it there were
no trees, shrubs or grass to be seen. The soundings in the latitude
of 26&deg; south, from about 8 or 9 leagues off till you come within
a league of the shore, are generally about 40 fathom; differing but
little, seldom above 3 or 4 fathom. But the lead brings up very
different sorts of sand, some coarse, some fine; and of several
colours, as yellow, white, grey, brown, bluish and reddish.</p>

<p>When I saw there was no harbour here, nor good anchoring, I stood
off to sea again, in the evening of the second of August, fearing a
storm on a lee shore, in a place where there was no shelter, and
desiring at least to have sea-room: for the clouds began to grow
thick in the western board, and the wind was already there, and began
to blow fresh almost upon the shore; which at this place lies along
north-north-west and south-south-east. By 9 o'clock at night we had
got a pretty</p>

<blockquote>[*1) It has not been deemed necessary for the present
purpose to reproduce these plates.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 142}</u></p>

<p>good offing; but, the wind still increasing, I took in my main
topsail, being able to carry no more sail than two courses and the
mizzen.</p>

<p>At 2 in the morning August 3rd, it blew very hard, and the sea was
much raised; so that I furled all my sails but my mainsail. Though
the wind blew so hard we had pretty clear weather till noon: but then
the whole sky was blackened with thick clouds, and we had some rain,
which would last a quarter of an hour at a time, and then it would
blow very fierce while the squalls of rain were over our heads; but
as soon as they were gone the wind was by much abated, the stress of
the storm being over. We sounded several times, but had no ground
till 8 o'clock August the 4th in the evening; and then had 60 fathom
water, coral ground. At 10 we had 56 fathom fine sand. At 12 we had
55 fathom, fine sand, of a pale bluish colour. It was now pretty
moderate weather; yet I made no sail till morning; but then, the wind
veering about to the south-west, I made sail and stood to the north:
and at 11 o'clock the next day August 5 we saw land again, at about
10 leagues distance. This noon we were in latitude 25&deg; 30', and
in the afternoon our cook died, an old man, who had been sick a great
while, being infirm before we came out of England.</p>

<p>The 6th of August in the morning we saw an opening in the land and
we ran into it, and anchored in 7 and a half fathom water, 2 miles
from the shore, clean sand. It was somewhat difficult getting in
here, by reason of many shoals we met with: but I sent my boat
sounding before me. The mouth of this sound, which I called Shark's
Bay, lies in about 25&deg; south latitude, and our reckoning made its
longitude from the Cape of Good Hope to be about 87&deg;; which is
less by 195 leagues than is usually laid down in our common charts,
if our reckoning was right and our glasses</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 143}</u></p>

<p>did not deceive us. As soon as I came to anchor in this bay (of
which I have given a plan) I sent my boat ashore to seek for fresh
water: but in the evening my men returned, having found none. The
next morning I went ashore myself, carrying pickaxes and shovels with
me, to dig for water: and axes to cut wood. We tried in several
places for water but, finding none after several trials, nor in
several miles compass, we left any farther search for it and,
spending the rest of the day in cutting wood, we went aboard at
night.</p>

<p>The land is of an indifferent height, so that it may be seen 9 or
10 leagues off. It appears at a distance very even; but as you come
nigher you find there are many gentle risings, though none steep nor
high. It is all a steep shore against the open sea: but in this bay
or sound we were now in the land is low by the seaside, rising
gradually in within the land. The mould is sand by the seaside,
producing a large sort of samphire, which bears a white flower.
Farther in the mould is reddish, a sort of sand producing some grass,
plants, and shrubs. The grass grows in great tufts as big as a
bushel, here and there a tuft: being intermixed with much heath, much
of the kind we have growing on our commons in England. Of trees or
shrubs here are divers sorts; but none above 10 foot high: their
bodies about 3 foot about, and 5 or 6 foot high before you come to
the branches, which are bushy and composed of small twigs there
spreading abroad, though thick set, and full of leaves; which were
mostly long and narrow. The colour of the leaves was on one side
whitish, and on the other green; and the bark of the trees was
generally of the same colour with the leaves, of a pale green. Some
of these trees were sweet-scented, and reddish within the bark, like
the sassafras, but redder. Most of the trees and shrubs had at this
time either blossoms or berries on them. The blossoms of the
different sort of trees were of several colours, as red, white,
yellow, etc., but mostly blue: and these generally smelt very
sweet</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 144}</u></p>

<p>and fragrant, as did some also of the rest. There were also beside
some plants, herbs, and tall flowers, some very small flowers,
growing on the ground, that were sweet and beautiful, and for the
most part unlike any I had seen elsewhere.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>There were but few land-fowls; we saw none but eagles of the
larger sorts of birds; but 5 or 6 sorts of small birds. The biggest
sort of these were not bigger than larks; some no bigger than wrens,
all singing with great variety of fine shrill notes; and we saw some
of their nests with young ones in them. The water-fowls are ducks
(which had young ones now, this being the beginning of the spring in
these parts) curlews, galdens, crab-catchers, cormorants, gulls,
pelicans; and some waterfowl, such as I have not seen anywhere
besides.</p>

<p>The land animals that we saw here were only a sort of raccoons,
different from those of the West Indies, chiefly as to their legs;
for these have very short forelegs; but go jumping upon them as the
others do (and like them are very good meat) and a sort of guanos, of
the same shape and size with other guanos, described (vol. i, p. 57),
but differing from them in 3 remarkable particulars: for these had a
larger and uglier head, and had no tail: and at the rump, instead of
the tail there, they had a stump of a tail which appeared like
another head; but not really such, being without mouth or eyes: yet
this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end; and,
which may be</p>

<p>reckoned a fourth difference, the legs also seemed all 4 of them
to be forelegs, being all alike in shape and length, and seeming by
the joints and bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently
either head or tail foremost. They were speckled black and yellow
like toads, and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of
crocodiles, plated onto the skin, or stuck into it, as part of the
skin. They are very slow in motion; and when a man comes nigh them
they will stand still and hiss, not endeavouring to get away. Their
livers are also spotted black and yellow: and the body when opened
has a very unsavoury smell. I did never see such ugly creatures
anywhere but here. The iguanas I have observed to be very good meat:
and I have often eaten of them with pleasure; but though I have eaten
of snakes, crocodiles and alligators, and many creatures that look
frightfully enough, and there are but few I should have been afraid
to eat of if pressed by hunger, yet I think my stomach would scarce
have served to venture upon these New Holland iguanas, both the looks
and the smell of them being so offensive<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>The sea fish that we saw here (for here was no river, land, or
pond of fresh water to be seen) are chiefly sharks. There are
abundance of them in this particular sound, and I therefore give it
the name of Shark's Bay. Here are also skates, thornbacks, and other
fish of the ray kind (one sort especially like the sea-devil) and
garfish, bonetas, etc. Of shellfish we got here mussels, periwinkles,
limpets, oysters, both of the pearl kind and also eating-oysters, as
well the common sort as long oysters; beside cockles, etc., the shore
was lined thick with many other sorts of very strange and beautiful
shells, for variety of colour and shape, most finely spotted with
red, black, or yellow, etc., such as I have not seen anywhere but at
this place. I brought away a</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 146}</u></p>

<p>great many of them; but lost all except a very few, and those not
of the best.</p>

<p>There are also some green turtle weighing about 200 pounds. Of
these we caught 2 which the water ebbing had left behind a ledge of
rock, which they could not creep over. These served all my company 2
days; and they were indifferent sweet meat. Of the sharks we caught a
great many which our men eat very savourily. Among them we caught one
which was 11 foot long. The space between its two eyes was 20 inches,
and 18 inches from one corner of his mouth to the other. Its maw was
like a leather sack, very thick, and so tough that a sharp knife
could scarce cut it: in which we found the head and bones of a
hippopotamus; the hairy lips of which were still sound and not
putrefied, and the jaw was also firm, out of which we plucked a great
many teeth, 2 of them 8 inches long and as big as a man's thumb,
small at one end, and a little crooked; the rest not above half so
long. The maw was full of jelly which stank extremely: however I
saved for a while the teeth and the shark's jaw: the flesh of it was
divided among my men; and they took care that no waste should be made
of it.</p>

<p>'Twas the 7th of August when we came into Shark's Bay; in which we
anchored at three several places, and stayed at the first of them (on
the west side of the bay) till the 11th. During which time we
searched about, as I said, for fresh water, digging wells, but to no
purpose. However we cut good store of firewood at this first
anchoring-place; and my company were all here very well refreshed
with raccoons, turtle, shark, and other fish, and some fowls; so that
we were now all much brisker than when we came in hither. Yet still I
was for standing farther into the bay, partly because I had a mind to
increase my stock of fresh water, which was began to be low; and
partly for the sake of discovering this part of the coast. I was
invited to go further, by</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 147}</u></p>

<p>seeing from this anchoring-place all open before me; which
therefore I designed to search before I left the bay. So on the 11th
about noon I steered farther in, with an easy sail because we had but
shallow water: we kept therefore good looking-out for fear of shoals;
sometimes shortening, sometimes deepening the water. About 2 in the
afternoon we saw the land ahead that makes the south of the bay, and
before night we had again shoalings from that shore: and therefore
shortened sail and stood off and on all night under, 2 topsails,
continually sounding, having never more than 10 fathom, and seldom
less than 7. The water deepened and shoaled so very gently that in
heaving the lead 5 or 6 times we should scarce have a foot
difference. When we came into 7 fathom either way we presently went
about. From this south part of the bay we could not see the land from
whence we came in the afternoon: and this land we found to be an
island of 3 or 4 leagues long, as is seen in the plan, but it
appearing barren I did not strive to go nearer it; and the rather
because the winds would not permit us to do it without much trouble,
and at the openings the water was generally shoal. I therefore made
no farther attempts in this south-west and south part of the bay, but
steered away to eastward to see if there was any land that way, for
as yet we had seen none there. On the 12th in the morning we passed
by the north point of that land and were confirmed in the persuasion
of its being an island by seeing an opening to the east of it, as we
had done on the west. Having fair weather, a small gale, and smooth
water, we stood further on in the bay to see what land was on the
east of it. Our soundings at first were 7 fathom, which held so a
great while, but at length it decreased to 6. Then we saw the land
right ahead that in the plan makes the east of the bay. We could not
come near it with the ship, having but shoal water; and it being
dangerous lying there, and the land extraordinary low, very unlikely
to have fresh</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 148}</u></p>

<p>water (though it had a few trees on it, seemingly mangroves) and
much of it probably covered at high-water, I stood out again that
afternoon, deepening the water, and before night anchored in 8
fathom, clean white sand, about the middle of the bay. The next day
we got up our anchor; and that afternoon came to an anchor once more
near 2 islands and a shoal of coral rocks that face the bay. Here I
scrubbed my ship; and, finding it very improbable I should get
anything further here, I made the best of my way out to sea again,
sounding all the way: but, finding by the shallowness of the water
that there was no going out to sea to the east of the two islands
that face the bay, nor between them, I returned to the west entrance,
going out by the same way I came in at, only on the east instead of
the west side of the small shoal to be seen in the plan; in which
channel we had 10, 12, and 13 fathom water, still deepening upon us
till we were out at sea. The day before we came out I sent a boat
ashore to the most northerly of the 2 islands, which is the least of
them, catching many small fish in the meanwhile with hook and line.
The boat's crew returning told me that the isle produces nothing but
a sort of green, short, hard, prickly grass, affording neither wood
nor fresh water; and that a sea broke between the 2 islands, a sign
that the water was shallow. They saw a large turtle and many skates
and thornbacks, but caught none.</p>

<p>It was August the 14th when I sailed out of this bay or sound, the
mouth of which lies, as I said, in 25&deg; 5', designing to coast
along to the north-east till I might commodiously put in at some
other part of New Holland. In passing out we saw 3 water-serpents
swimming about in the sea, of a yellow colour, spotted with dark
brown spots. They were each about 4 foot long, and about the bigness
of a man's wrist, and were the first I saw on this coast, which
abounds with several sorts of them. We had the winds at our first
coming out at north and the land lying north-easterly. We</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 149}</u></p>

<p>plied off and on, getting forward but little till the next day:
when the wind coming at south-south-west and south we began to coast
it along the shore to the northward, keeping at 6 or 7 leagues off
shore; and sounding often, we had between 40 and 46 fathom water,
brown sand with some white shells. This 15th of August we were in
latitude 24&deg; 41'. On the 16th day at noon we were in 23&deg; 22'.
The wind coming at east by north we could not keep the shore aboard,
but were forced to go farther off, and lost sight of the land. Then
sounding we had no ground with 80 fathom line; however the wind
shortly after came about again to the southward, and then we jog'd on
again to the northward and saw many small dolphins and whales, and
abundance of scuttle-shells swimming on the sea; and some
water-snakes every day. The 17th we saw the land again, and took a
sight of it.</p>

<p>The 18th in the afternoon, being 3 or 4 leagues offshore, I saw a
shoal point, stretching from the land into the sea a league or more.
The sea broke high on it; by which I saw plainly there was a shoal
there. I stood farther off and coasted alongshore to about 7 or 8
leagues distance: and at 12 o'clock at night we sounded, and had but
20 fathom hard sand. By this I found I was upon another shoal, and so
presently steered off west half an hour, and had then 40 fathom. At
one in the morning of the 18th day we had 85 fathom: by two we could
find no ground; and then I ventured to steer alongshore again, due
north, which is two points wide of the coast (that lies
north-north-east) for fear of another shoal. I would not be too far
off from the land, being desirous to search into it wherever I should
find an opening or any convenience of searching about for water, etc.
When we were off the shoal point I mentioned where we had but 20
fathom water, we had in the night abundance of whales about the ship,
some ahead, others astern, and some on each side blowing and making a
very dismal noise;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 150}</u></p>

<p>but when we came out again into deeper water they left us. Indeed
the noise that they made by blowing and dashing of the sea with their
tails, making it all of a breach and foam, was very dreadful to us,
like the breach of the waves in very shoal water, or among rocks. The
shoal these whales were upon had depth of water sufficient, no less
than 20 fathom, as I said; and it lies in latitude 22&deg; 22'. The
shore was generally bold all along; we had met with no shoal at sea
since the Abrolho Shoal, when we first fell on the New Holland coast
in the latitude of 28, till yesterday in the afternoon, and this
night.</p>

<p>This morning also when we expected by the chart we had with us to
have been 11 leagues offshore we were but 4; so that either our
charts were faulty, which yet hitherto and afterwards we found true
enough as to the lying of the coast, or else here was a tide unknown
to us that deceived us; though we had found very little of any tide
on this coast hitherto. As to our winds in the coasting thus far, as
we had been within the verge of the general trade (though interrupted
by the storm I mentioned) from the latitude of 28, when we first fell
in with the coast: and by that time we were in the latitude of 25 we
had usually the regular tradewind (which is here south-south-east)
when we were at any distance from shore: but we had often sea and
land-breezes, especially when near shore, and when in Shark's Bay;
and had a particular north-west wind, or storm, that set us in
thither. On this 18th of August we coasted with a brisk gale of the
true tradewind at south-south-east, very fair and clear weather; but,
hauling off in the evening to sea, were next morning out of sight of
land; and the land now trending away north-easterly, and we being to
the northward of it, and the wind also shrinking from the
south-south-east to the east-south-east (that is, from the true
tradewind to the seabreeze, as the land now lay) we could not get in
with the land again yet awhile, so as to see it, though we trimmed
sharp and kept close on a wind. We were this 19th day in latitude</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 151}</u></p>

<p>21&deg; 42'. The 20th we were in latitude 19&deg; 37' and kept
close on a wind to get sight of the land again, but could not yet see
it. We had very fair weather, and though we were so far from the land
as to be out of sight of it, yet we had the sea and land-breezes. In
the night we had the land-breeze at south-south-east, a small gentle
gale; which in the morning about sunrising would shift about
gradually (and withal increasing in strength) till about noon we
should have it at east-south-east, which is the true sea breeze here.
Then it would blow a brisk gale, so that we could scarce carry our
topsails double reefed: and it would continue thus till 3 in the
afternoon, when it would decrease again. The weather was fair all the
while, not a cloud to be seen; but very hazy, especially nigh the
horizon. We sounded several times this 20th day and at first had no
ground; but had afterwards from 52 to 45 fathom, coarse brown sand,
mixed with small brown and white stones, with dints besides in the
tallow.</p>

<p>The 21st day also we had small land breezes in the night and
seabreezes in the day: and as we saw some seasnakes every day, so
this day we saw a great many, of two different sorts or shapes. One
sort was yellow, and about the bigness of a man's wrist, about 4 foot
long, having a flat tail about 4 fingers broad. The other sort was
much smaller and shorter, round and spotted black and yellow. This
day we sounded several times, and had 45 fathom sand. We did not make
the land till noon, and then saw it first from our topmast-head. It
bore south-east by east about 9 leagues distance; and it appeared
like a cape or head of land. The seabreeze this day was not so strong
as the day before, and it veered out more; so that we had a fair wind
to run in with to the shore, and at sunset anchored in 20 fathom,
clean sand, about 5 leagues from the bluff point; which was not a
cape (as it appeared at a great distance) but the easternmost end of
an island, about 5 or 6 leagues in length and 1 in breadth.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 152}</u></p>

<p>There were 3 or 4 rocky islands about a league from us between us
and the bluff point; and we saw many other islands both to the east
and west of it, as far as we could see either way from our
topmast-head: and all within them to the south there was nothing but
islands of a pretty height, that may be seen 8 or 9 leagues off. By
what we saw of them they must have been a range of islands of about
20 leagues in length, stretching from east-north-east to
west-south-west and, for ought I know, as far as to those of Shark's
Bay; and to a considerable breadth also (for we could see 9 or 10
leagues in among them) towards the continent or mainland of New
Holland, if there be any such thing hereabouts: and, by the great
tides I met with a while afterwards, more to the north-east, I had a
strong suspicion that here might be a kind of archipelago of islands
and a passage possibly to the south of New Holland and New Guinea
into the great South Sea eastward; which I had thoughts also of
attempting in my return from New Guinea (had circumstances permitted)
and told my officers so: but I would not attempt it at this time
because we wanted water and could not depend upon finding it there.
This place is in the latitude of 20&deg; 21', but in the chart that I
had of this coast, which was Tasman's, it was laid down in 19&deg;
50', and the shore is laid down as all along joining in one body or
continent, with some openings appearing like rivers; and not like
islands, as really they are. See several sights of it, Table 4
Numbers 8, 9, and 10. This place lies more northerly by 40' than is
laid down in Mr. Tasman's chart: and beside its being made a firm,
continued land, only with some openings like the mouths of rivers, I
found the soundings also different from what the pricked line of his
course shows them, and generally shallower than he makes them; which
inclines me to think that he came not so near the shore as his line
shows, and so had deeper soundings, and could not so well distinguish
the islands. His meridian or difference of longitude from Shark's Bay
agrees well enough with my account,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 153}</u></p>

<p>which is 232 leagues, though we differ in latitude. And to confirm
my conjecture that the line of his course is made too near the shore,
at least not far to the east of this place, the water is there so
shallow that he could not come there so nigh.</p>

<p>But to proceed: in the night we had a small land-breeze, and in
the morning I weighed anchor, designing to run in among the islands,
for they had large channels between them, of a league wide at least,
and some 2 or 3 leagues wide. I sent in my boat before to sound, and
if they found shoal water to return again; but if they found water
enough to go ashore on one of the islands and stay till the ship came
in: where they might in the meantime search for water. So we followed
after with the ship, sounding as we went in, and had 20 fathom, till
within 2 leagues of the bluff head, and then we had shoal water, and
very uncertain soundings: yet we ran in still with an easy sail,
sounding and looking out well, for this was dangerous work. When we
came abreast of the bluff head, and about 2 mile from it, we had but
7 fathom: then we edged away from it, but had no more water; and,
running in a little farther, we had but 4 fathoms; so we anchored
immediately; and yet when we had veered out a third of a cable we had
7 fathom water again; so uncertain was the water. My boat came
immediately aboard, and told me that the island was very rocky and
dry, and they had little hopes of finding water there. I sent them to
sound, and bade them, if they found a channel of 8 or 10 fathom water
to keep on, and we would follow with the ship. We were now about 4
leagues within the outer small rocky islands, but still could see
nothing but islands within us; some 5 or 6 leagues long, others not
above a mile round. The large islands were pretty high; but all
appeared dry and mostly rocky and barren. The rocks looked of a rusty
yellow colour, and therefore I despaired of getting water on any of
them; but was in some</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 153}</u></p>

<p>hopes of finding a channel to run in beyond all these islands,
could I have spent time here, and either get to the main of New
Holland, or find out some other islands that might afford us water
and other refreshments; besides, that among so many islands we might
have found some sort of rich mineral or ambergris, it being a good
latitude for both these. But we had not sailed above a league farther
before our water grew shoaler again, and then we anchored in 6 fathom
hard sand.</p>

<p>We were now on the inner side of the island, on whose outside is
the bluff point. We rode a league from the island and I presently
went ashore, and carried shovels to dig for water, but found none.
There grow here 2 or three sorts of shrubs, one just like rosemary;
and therefore I called this Rosemary Island. It grew in great plenty
here, but had no smell. Some of the other shrubs had blue and yellow
flowers; and we found 2 sorts of grain like beans: the one grew on
bushes; the other on a sort of creeping vine that runs along on the
ground, having very thick broad leaves and the blossom like a bean
blossom, but much larger, and of a deep red colour, looking very
beautiful. We saw here some cormorants, gulls, crab-catchers, etc., a
few small land-birds, and a sort of white parrot, which flew a great
many together. We found some shellfish, namely limpets, periwinkles,
and abundance of small oysters, growing on the rocks, which were very
sweet. In the sea we saw some green-turtle, a pretty many sharks, and
abundance of water-snakes of several sorts and sizes. The stones were
all of rusty colour, and ponderous.</p>

<p>We saw a smoke on an island 3 or 4 leagues off; and here also the
bushes had been burned, but we found no other sign of inhabitants: it
was probable that on the island where the smoke was there were
inhabitants, and fresh water for them. In the evening I went aboard,
and consulted with my officers whether it was best to send thither,
or to</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 155}</u></p>

<p>search among any other of these islands with my boat; or else go
from hence, and coast alongshore with the ship till we could find
some better place than this was to ride in, where we had shoal water
and lay exposed to winds and tides. They all agreed to go from hence;
so I gave orders to weigh in the morning as soon as it should be
light, and to get out with the land breeze.</p>

<p>According, August the 23rd, at 5 in the morning we ran out, having
a pretty fresh land-breeze at south-south-east. By 8 o'clock we were
got out, and very seasonably; for before 9 the seabreeze came on us
very strong, and increasing, we took in our topsails and stood off
under 2 courses and a mizzen, this being as much sail as we could
carry. The sky was clear, there being not one cloud to be seen; but
the horizon appeared very hazy, and the sun at setting the night
before, and this morning at rising, appeared very red. The wind
continued very strong till 12, then it began to abate: I have seldom
met with a stronger breeze. These strong seabreezes lasted thus in
their turns 3 or 4 days. They sprang up with the sunrise; by 9
o'clock they were very strong, and so continued till noon, when they
began to abate; and by sunset there was little wind, or a calm till
the land-breezes came; which we should certainly have in the morning
about 1 or 2 o'clock. The land-breezes were between the
south-south-west and south-south-east. The seabreezes between the
east-north-east and north-north-east. In the night while calm we
fished with hook and line and caught good store of fish, namely,
snapper, bream, old-wives, and dogfish. When these last came we
seldom caught any others; for if they did not drive away the other
fish, yet they would be sure to keep them from taking our hooks, for
they would first have them themselves, biting very greedily. We
caught also a monkfish, of which I brought home the picture.</p>

<p>On the 25th of August we still coasted alongshore, that we might
the better see any opening; kept sounding, and had about 20 fathom
clean sand. The 26th day, being</p>

<p>about 4 leagues offshore, the water began gradually to shoal from
20 to 14 fathom. I was edging in a little towards the land, thinking
to have anchored; but presently after the water decreased almost at
once, till we had but 5 fathom. I durst therefore adventure no
farther, but steered out the same way that we came in; and in a short
time had 10 fathom (being then about 4 leagues and a half from the
shore) and even soundings. I steered away east-north-east coasting
along as the land lies. This day the seabreezes began to be very
moderate again, and we made the best of our way alongshore, only in
the night edging off a little for fear of shoals. Ever since we left
Shark's Bay we had fair clear weather, and so for a great while
still.</p>

<p>The 27th day we had 20 fathom water all night, yet we could not
see land till 1 in the afternoon from our topmast-head. By 3 we could
just discern land from our quarter-deck; we had then 16 fathom. The
wind was at north and we steered east by north, which is but one
point in on the land; yet we decreased our water very fast; for at 4
we had but 9 fathom; the next cast but 7, which frighted us; and we
then tacked instantly and stood off: but in a short time the wind
coming at north-west and west-north-west we tacked again, and steered
north-north-east and then deepened our water again, and had all night
from 15 to 20 fathom.</p>

<p>The 28th day we had between 20 and 40 fathom. We saw no land this
day but saw a great many snakes and some whales. We saw also some
boobies and noddy-birds; and in the night caught one of these last.
It was of another shape and colour than any I had seen before. It had
a small long bill, as all of them have, flat feet like ducks' feet;
its tail forked like a swallow, but longer and broader, and the fork
deeper than that of the swallow, with very long wings; the top or
crown of the head of this noddy was coal-black, having also small
black streaks round about and close to the eyes; and round these
streaks on each side a pretty broad white</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 157}</u></p>

<p>circle. The breast, belly, and underpart of the wings of this
noddy were white; and the back and upper part of its wings of a faint
black or smoke colour. See a picture of this and of the common one,
Birds Figures 5 and 6. Noddies are seen in most places between the
tropics, as well in the East Indies, and on the coast of Brazil, as
in the West Indies. They rest ashore a-nights, and therefore we never
see them far at sea, not above 20 or 30 leagues, unless driven off in
a storm. When they come about a ship they commonly perch in the
night, and will sit still till they are taken by the seamen. They
build on cliffs against the sea, or rocks, as I have said.</p>

<p>The 30th day being in latitude 18&deg; 21' we made the land again,
and saw many great smokes near the shore; and having fair weather and
moderate breezes I steered in towards it. At 4 in the afternoon I
anchored in 8 fathom water, clear sand, about 3 leagues and a half
from the shore. I presently sent my boat to sound nearer in, and they
found 10 fathom about a mile farther in; and from thence still
farther in the water decreased gradually to 9, 8, 7, and 2 mile
distance to 6 fathom. This evening we saw an eclipse of the moon, but
it was abating before the moon appeared to us; for the horizon was
very hazy, so that we could not see the moon till she had been half
an hour above the horizon: and at 2 hours, 22' after sunset, by the
reckoning of our glasses, the eclipse was quite gone, which was not
of many digits. The moon's centre was then 33&deg; 40' high.</p>

<p>The 31st of August betimes in the morning I went ashore with 10 or
11 men to search for water. We went armed with muskets and cutlasses
for our defence, expecting to see people there; and carried also
shovels and pickaxes to dig wells. When we came near the shore we saw
3 tall black naked men on the sandy bay ahead of us: but as we rowed
in they went away. When we were landed I sent the boat with two men
in her to lie a little from the shore at</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 158}</u></p>

<p>an anchor, to prevent being seized; while the rest of us went
after the 3 black men, who were now got on the top of a small hill
about a quarter of a mile from us, with 8 or 9 men more in their
company. They seeing us coming ran away. When we came on the top of
the hill where they first stood we saw a plain savannah, about half a
mile from us, farther in from the sea. There were several things like
haycocks standing in the savannah; which at a distance we thought
were houses, looking just like the Hottentots' houses at the Cape of
Good Hope: but we found them to be so many rocks. We searched about
these for water, but could find none, nor any houses, nor people, for
they were all gone. Then we turned again to the place where we
landed, and there we dug for water.</p>

<p>While we were at work there came nine or 10 of the natives to a
small hill a little way from us, and stood there menacing and
threatening of us, and making a great noise. At last one of them came
towards us, and the rest followed at a distance. I went out to meet
him, and came within 50 yards of him, making to him all the signs of
peace and friendship I could; but then he ran away, neither would
they any of them stay for us to come nigh them; for we tried two or
three times. At last I took two men with me, and went in the
afternoon along by the seaside, purposely to catch one of them, if I
could, of whom I might learn where they got their fresh water. There
were 10 or 12 natives a little way off, who seeing us three going
away from the rest of our men, followed us at a distance. I thought
they would follow us: but there being for a while a sandbank between
us and them, that they could not then see us, we made a halt, and hid
ourselves in a bending of the sandbank. They knew we must be
thereabouts, and being 3 or 4 times our number, thought to seize us.
So they dispersed themselves, some going to the seashore and others
beating about the sandhills.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 159}</u></p>

<p>We knew by what rencounter we had had with them in the morning
that we could easily outrun them; so a nimble young man that was with
me, seeing some of them near, ran towards them; and they for some
time ran away before him. But he soon overtaking them, they faced
about and fought him. He had a cutlass, and they had wooden lances;
with which, being many of them, they were too hard for him. When he
first ran towards them I chased two more that were by the shore; but
fearing how it might be with my young man, I turned back quickly, and
went up to the top of a sandhill, whence I saw him near me, closely
engaged with them. Upon their seeing me, one of them threw a lance at
me, that narrowly missed me. I discharged my gun to scare them but
avoided shooting any of them; till finding the young man in great
danger from them, and myself in some; and that though the gun had a
little frighted them at first, yet they had soon learnt to despise
it, tossing up their hands, and crying pooh, pooh, pooh; and coming
on afresh with a great noise, I thought it high time to charge again,
and shoot one of them, which I did. The rest, seeing him fall, made a
stand again; and my young man took the opportunity to disengage
himself, and come off to me; my other man also was with me, who had
done nothing all this while, having come out unarmed; and I returned
back with my men, designing to attempt the natives no farther, being
very sorry for what had happened already. They took up their wounded
companion; and my young man, who had been struck through the cheek by
one of their lances, was afraid it had been poisoned: but I did not
think that likely. His wound was very painful to him, being made with
a blunt weapon: but he soon recovered of it.</p>

<p>Among the New Hollanders whom we were thus engaged with, there was
one who by his appearance and carriage, as well in the morning as
this afternoon, seemed to be the chief of them, and a kind of prince
or captain among them. He</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 160}</u></p>

<p>was a young brisk man, not very tall, nor so personable as some of
the rest, though more active and courageous: he was painted (which
none of the rest were at all) with a circle of white paste or pigment
(a sort of lime, as we thought) about his eyes, and a white streak
down his nose from his forehead to the tip of it. And his breast and
some part of his arms were also made white with the same paint; not
for beauty or ornament, one would think, but as some wild Indian
warriors are said to do, he seemed thereby to design the looking more
terrible; this his painting adding very much to his natural
deformity; for they all of them have the most unpleasant looks and
the worst features of any people that ever I saw, though I have seen
great variety of savages. These New Hollanders were probably the same
sort of people as those I met with on this coast in my Voyage round
the World; for the place I then touched at was not above 40 or 50
leagues to the north-east of this: and these were much the same
blinking creatures (here being also abundance of the same kind of
flesh-flies teasing them) and with the same black skins, and hair
frizzled, tall and thin, etc., as those were: but we had not the
opportunity to see whether these, as the former, wanted two of their
fore-teeth.</p>

<p>We saw a great many places where they had made fires; and where
there were commonly 3 or 4 boughs stuck up to windward of them; for
the wind (which is the seabreeze) in the daytime blows always one way
with them; and the land breeze is but small. By their fireplaces we
should always find great heaps of fish-shells, of several sorts; and
it is probable that these poor creatures here lived chiefly on the
shellfish, as those I before described did on small fish, which they
caught in wires or holes in the sand at low-water. These gathered
their shellfish on the rocks at low-water; but had no wires (that we
saw) whereby to get any other sorts of fish: as among the former I
saw not any heaps</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 161}</u></p>

<p>of shells as here, though I know they also gathered some
shellfish. The lances also of those were such as these had; however
they being upon an island, with their women and children, and all in
our power, they did not there use them against us, as here on the
continent, where we saw none but some of the men under head, who come
out purposely to observe us. We saw no houses at either place; and I
believe they have none, since the former people on the island had
none, though they had all their families with them.</p>

<p>Upon returning to my men I saw that though they had dug 8 or 9
foot deep yet found no water. So I returned aboard that evening, and
the next day being September 1st I sent my boatswain ashore to dig
deeper, and sent the seine with him to catch fish. While I stayed
aboard I observed the flowing of the tide, which runs very swift
here, so that our nun-buoy would not bear above the water to be seen.
It flows here (as on that part of New Holland I described formerly)
about 5 fathom: and here the flood runs south-east by south till the
last quarter; then it sets right in towards the shore (which lies
here south-south-west and north-north-east) and the ebb runs
north-west by north. When the tides slackened we fished with hook and
line, as we had already done in several places on this coast; on
which in this voyage hitherto we had found but little tides: but by
the height and strength and course of them hereabouts it should seem
that if there be such a passage or strait going through eastward to
the great South Sea, as I said one might suspect, one would expect to
find the mouth of it somewhere between this place and Rosemary
Island, which was the part of New Holland I came last from.</p>

<p>Next morning my men came aboard and brought a rundlet of brackish
water which they got out of another well that they dug in a place a
mile off, and about half as far from the shore; but this water was
not fit to drink. However we all concluded that it would serve to
boil our oatmeal,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 162}</u></p>

<p>for burgoo, whereby we might save the remains of our other water
for drinking, till we should get more; and accordingly the next day
we brought aboard 4 hogsheads of it: but while we were at work about
the well we were sadly pestered with the flies, which were more
troublesome to us than the sun, though it shone clear and strong upon
us all the while, very hot. All this while we saw no more of the
natives, but saw some of the smokes of some of their fires at 2 or 3
miles distance.</p>

<p>The land hereabouts was much like the part of New Holland that I
formerly described, it is low but seemingly barricaded with a long
chain of sandhills to the sea, that lets nothing be seen of what is
farther within land. At high water, the tides rising so high as they
do, the coast shows very low; but when it is low water it seems to be
of an indifferent height. At low-watermark the shore is all rocky, so
that then there is no landing with a boat: but at high water a boat
may come in over those rocks to the sandy bay which runs all along on
this coast. The land by the sea for about 5 or 600 yards is a dry
sandy soil, bearing only shrubs and bushes of divers sorts. Some of
these had them at this time of the year, yellow flowers or blossoms,
some blue, and some white; most of them of a very fragrant smell.
Some had fruit like peascods; in each of which there were just ten
small peas; I opened many of them, and found no more nor less. There
are also here some of that sort of bean which I saw at Rosemary
Island: and another sort of small, red, hard pulse, growing in cods
also, with little black eyes like beans. I know not their names, but
have seen them used often in the East Indies for weighing gold; and
they make the same use of them at Guinea, as I have heard, where the
women also make bracelets with them to wear about their arms. These
grow on bushes; but here are also a fruit like beans growing on a
creeping sort of shrub-like vine. There was great plenty of</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 163}</u></p>

<p>all these sorts of cod-fruit growing on the sandhills by the
seaside, some of them green, some ripe, and some fallen on the
ground: but I could not perceive that any of them had been gathered
by the natives; and might not probably be wholesome food.</p>

<p>The land farther in, that is lower than what borders on the sea,
was so much as we saw of it very plain and even; partly savannahs,
and partly woodland. The savannahs bear a sort of thin coarse grass.
The mould is also a coarser sand than that by the seaside, and in
some places it is clay. Here are a great many rocks in the large
savannah we were in, which are 5 or 6 foot high, and round at top
like a haycock, very remarkable; some red, and some white. The
woodland lies farther in still; where there were divers sorts of
small trees, scarce any three foot in circumference; their bodies 12
or 14 foot high, with a head of small knibs or boughs. By the sides
of the creeks, especially nigh the sea, there grow a few small black
mangrove trees.</p>

<p>There are but few land animals. I saw some lizards; and my men saw
two or three beasts like hungry wolves, lean like so many skeletons,
being nothing but skin and bones: it is probable that it was the foot
of one of those beasts that I mentioned as seen by us in New Holland.
We saw a raccoon or two, and one small speckled snake.</p>

<p>The land-fowls that we saw here were crows (just such as ours in
England) small hawks, and kites; a few of each sort: but here are
plenty of small turtledoves that are plump, fat and very good meat.
Here are 2 or 3 sorts of smaller birds, some as big as larks, some
less; but not many of either sort. The sea-fowl are pelicans,
boobies, noddies, curlews, sea-pies, etc., and but few of these
either.</p>

<p>The sea is plentifully stocked with the largest whales that I ever
saw; but not to compare with the vast ones of the northern seas. We
saw also a great many green-turtle, but caught none; here being no
place to set a turtle-net in;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 164}</u></p>

<p>here being no channel for them, and the tides running so strong.
We saw some sharks, and paracoots; and with hooks and lines we caught
some rock-fish and old-wives. Of shellfish, here were oysters both of
the common kind for eating, and of the pearl kind: and also wilks,
conches, mussels, limpets, periwinkles, etc., and I gathered a few
strange shells; chiefly a sort not large, and thick-set all about
with rays or spikes growing in rows.</p>

<p>And thus having ranged about a considerable time upon this coast
without finding any good fresh water, or any convenient place to
clean the ship, as I had hoped for: and it being moreover the height
of the dry season, and my men growing scorbutic for want of
refreshments, so that I had little encouragement to search further, I
resolved to leave this coast and accordingly in the beginning of
September set sail towards Timor.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-15"></a>A WRITTEN DETAIL OF THE DISCOVERIES AND
NOTICEABLE OCCURRENCES IN THE VOYAGE OF THE FLUYT "VOSSENBOSCH," THE
SLOOP "D'WAIJER," AND THE PATSJALLANG "NOVA HOLLANDIA,"</h3>

<h4>DESPATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ANNO 1705, FROM BATAVIA BY
WAY TIMOR TO NEW HOLLAND; COMPILED AS WELL FROM THE WRITTEN JOURNALS
AS FROM THE VERBAL RECITALS OF THE RETURNED OFFICERS, BY THE COUNCIL
EXTRAORDINARY, HENDRICK SWAARDECRON AND CORNELIS CHASTELIJN,
COMMISSIONED FOR THAT PURPOSE, AND FORMING THEIR REPORT TO. HIS
EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL, JAN VAN HORN AND THE COUNCIL OF
INDIA.</h4>

<p>My Lords.--Before entering into a detail of matters of note
occurring on the abovementioned voyage, it may not perhaps be
superfluous to offer a few preliminary observations, in order to
throw a clearer light upon the subject; briefly these:--that the
above mentioned vessels having, in accordance with the instructions
delivered to the crew by your excellency, on the twentieth of January
of this year, weighed anchor from the port of Batavia on the 23rd of
the same month, heard on their way, at Rembang on the east coast of
Java, how the sloop <i>Doriados</i>, which had been destined for this
voyage instead of the <i>Waijer</i>, had been disabled, but has been
helped on its way by friendly vessels to Timor, and thence to New
Holland.</p>

<p>They arrived on the twelfth of February before Copang, on the
island of Timor, where they were obliged, by bad</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 166}</u></p>

<p>weather, to remain for twenty days, until the second of March. A
month later, namely on the second of April, they explored the
north-west corner of Van Diemen's Land, without having so far
observed anything remarkable on this voyage, except for fifty or
sixty miles straight north and south from this point, the land is
elevated, and along the whole of this coast there was continually
found from fifty to twenty, and fewer fathoms' water; besides, that
on the passage from Timor, the compasses were on the sixth of March
affected by the thunder and lightning to such a degree that the
north-end of the needle pointed due south, and was brought home in
that position.</p>

<p>This point of Van Diemen's land having been thus explored, they
occupied themselves, from the second of April to the twelfth of July,
in visiting the bays, head lands, islands, rivers, etc., to the best
of their ability according to their instructions. But not being
sufficiently provided with fresh provisions for so long a voyage,
many men on board began to suffer and also to die, from severe
sickness, principally fever, acute pains in the head and eyes, and
above all, dropsy so that they were compelled to resolve on
returning, and to direct their course to Banda; the patsjallang
however alone arrived there; the fluit <i>Vossenbosch</i>, and the
sloop <i>Waijer</i>, being forced by unfavourable weather and the
weakness of the crew, to pass that government, and to hold on towards
Macassar, as your nobilities will have already learnt by the papers
from Banda and Macassar. The skipper, upper and under steersman, with
most of the petty officers and sailors of the <i>Vossenbosch</i>
being already dead, and their incomplete journals alone having
reached us, the new maps moreover, made by the direction of the
skipper Martin van Delft, having been improperly detained at
Macassar, we are not at present in a position to forward the same
complete information on the subject, which the arrival of these maps
would have enabled us to give, as they contain</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 167}</u></p>

<p>many new names which could not possibly be found in the limited
compass of the Company's former charts. According to their own
accounts, they have only been able to visit a strip of land of about
sixty miles long, on coast E. and W., including merely a very small
portion of that great bay, which it was recommended to them to sail
over and explore as much as possible.</p>

<p>The daily courses, winds, currents, depths, reefs, soundings,'
variations of the compass, and the like observations, more especially
depending upon the art of the steersman, are to be found in the
above-mentioned journals, and shall here be passed over as out of
place, in a compendious report like the present. We shall here
principally follow the logbook of the skipper Martin van Delft, of
the <i>Vossenbosch</i>, and that of the under steersman Andries
Roseboom of the sloop <i>Waijer</i>, as the journals of the captain
of the patsjalling, Pieter Fredericks of Hamburg, and of the
steersman of the <i>Vossenbosch</i>, notwithstanding their general
usefulness, do not afford any additional information as they merely
describe the same subject.</p>

<p>Besides the journals, some depositions and other papers of the
same kind have reached us, referring to the loss of anchors, ropes
sails the courses and bearings of the ship as recorded on board the
<i>Vossenbosch</i>, none of them however of a nature to call for
further observation here. At the same time we cannot omit to mention
two papers, written by the captain of the patsjallang, and entered in
the register of Banda, under the letters D.E., containing brief notes
of the ship's course, the names of, and dates of departure from, the
places visited during the voyage together with the currents
encountered, which documents could be forwarded to you, if desired,
together with the above-mentioned journals of the skipper of the
<i>Vossenbosch</i>, and the captain of the <i>Waijer</i>, and the new
maps should they arrive here from Macassar, since the maps of the
patsjallang have not been drawn up</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 168}</u></p>

<p>with due regard to the proper soundings, distances and other
requisites, and are, therefore, not to be depended upon.</p>

<p>Continuing our summary of the voyage, we would observe, that from
the commencement of the exploration of Van Diemen's land they noticed
at several points on the strand signs of men such as smoke and the
like. The first inlet within the north point of that land, which was
visited by them and called the Roseboom's Bay, runs dead inland,
throwing out several branches on both sides. No fresh water is found
here. At that time they saw no men, but merely some signs of
inhabitants. However on their leaving the bay, some of the natives
were caught sight of, running away with their children and dogs, as
soon as they perceived our countrymen; and no opportunity was
obtained of getting speech of any of them.</p>

<p>The coast here is level. The names Casuaris and Varckenskoek, were
given to the points E. and W. of this bay; of two other projecting
points on the W. side, which turned out to be islands, one was named
Goede Hoop, and the other Kuijle Eijland; they found on the former of
them a little water, but brackish and in small quantity.</p>

<p>Between these two islands or headlands, some natives were met by
the men on the thirty-first of April, who did not retire, but ran
hastily towards an eminence, or small hill, and with obvious, signs
and gestures attempted to drive them away. No one was able to
understand their language, which, according to the skipper Martin van
Delft, seems to resemble in some respects that of Malabar; but even
this is by no means clear. The colour and stature of these men
appears from the description given to resemble most that of the
Indians of the east; but they go stark naked without any regard to
age or sex, as was constantly observed by our sailors from the
above-mentioned date, until their departure. The only exception to
this rule were the women who had children with them, these alone
wearing a light covering of leaves or</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 169}</u></p>

<p>such-like over their middle. The whole number of these islanders
did not exceed fourteen or fifteen men; seeing that our people could
not be induced by their grimaces, violent gestures, yelling and
florishing of assegais, and all kinds of weapons, to retreat from the
shore, they were imprudent enough to throw some of their assegais, or
rather sharpened sticks at our men, with the intention of wounding
and intimidating them; but their chief, or one who at least appeared
to be so, being hit by a ball from the single musket that was fired
at them in return, the rest began to run quickly away, being very
agile and well made.</p>

<p>The women are tall and slim, with very large mouth and small eyes;
the head of both sexes is curly, like that of the Papuan islanders,
and a yellow or red ointment, prepared from turtle fat, seems to be
used as an ornament. The nature of these tribes is foul and
treacherous, as was apparent at the last moment, when our people were
on the point of departing. Eight islanders attacked and wounded two
sailors, with the hope of seizing upon their clothes, and that after
having conversed with these men for weeks, eaten and drunk with them,
visited them on board and being allowed to examine everything to
their great admiration, after having received presents, and also on
their part regaled our people with fish and crabs. Besides this,
their bad disposition came to light in the case of the man who had
been previously wounded by our party as before mentioned; when he
afterwards was assisted and bandaged, and had every possible
attention shown him by our men, he tore the linen to pieces and threw
it away into a corner; notwithstanding that at other times these
natives appeared particularly greedy after linen, knives, beads, and
such toys.</p>

<p>They however possess nothing which is of value themselves, and
have neither iron nor anything like mineral ore or metal, but only a
stone which is ground and made to serve as a hatchet. They have no
habitations either houses or huts;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 170}</u></p>

<p>and feed on fish, which they catch with harpoons of wood, and also
by means on nets, putting out to sea in small canoes, made of the
bark of trees, which are in themselves so fragile, that it is
necessary to strengthen them with cross-beams.</p>

<p>Some of them had marks on their bodies, apparently cut or carved,
which, as it seemed to our people, were looked upon by them as a kind
of ornament. They eat sparingly and moderately, whereby they grow up
always active and nimble; their diet seems to consist of fish, and a
few roots and vegetables, but no birds or wild animals of any kind
are used as food, for though animal food exists and was found by our
men in abundance, the natives appeared to be indifferent to it.</p>

<p>According to the notes of the captain of the sloop <i>Waijer</i>,
from the 14th of June, about five hundred people with women and
children, were met on one occasion about two miles inland; at night
also they were descried sitting around several fires among the
bushes; nothing however was seen in their possession of any value.
Our men might also easily have taken and brought over to Batavia with
them, two or three of the natives who daily came on board, but the
skipper of the <i>Vossenbosch</i>, following out his instructions to
the letter, would not allow them to be taken without their full
consent, either by falsehood or fraud, and as no-one understood their
language, nothing was to be done in the matter consequently they
remained in their own country.</p>

<p>The country here is for the most part level, and no mountains are
to be seen, except a remarkable eminence, which at a distance has the
appearance of three mountains, as noted in the journal of the
skipper, under date May the 25th. The soil seems productive, if
cultivated, but the whole extent of the coast is bordered by sands or
downs. In no part were any remarkable trees noticed, much less any of
an aromatic and spice kind.</p>

<p>The second bay after the Rooseboom's Bay just described between
Tigers and Wolfs-point, visited by our countrymen,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 170}</u></p>

<p>has the appearance of a wide river, but is salt; as however
nothing remarkable was found there, we shall let the journal of the
skipper, on the date May 12th, speak for itself, it being described
in the account of the commander of the <i>Waijer</i>, under the name
of the Bessia River.</p>

<p>The third inlet visited by the expedition is rather large, its E.
point being named Kaijams, and its W. Oranjes-hoek. The tides flow
here with great force, and the <i>Patsjallang</i> sailed between
eight and ten miles inland, without finding any diminution in the
saltness of the water; as the bottom, and the general aspect still
remain the same, it was supposed by our people, that this inlet runs
right through to the south of New Holland, and not only this, but
also others both E. and W. of the angle of Van Diemen's land.</p>

<p>From this it seems to follow, that the South Land in a great
measure consists of islands,--a supposition not at all improbable
considering how on its south side, from the point called Leeuwin in
the year 1622, to Nuyts-land, discovered in 1627, it is entirely girt
and surrounded by innumerable islands, although these things had
better be left to a more accurate examination of the country, and a
more matured judgment. But there is another consideration in favour
of this supposition, namely, the rude and barbarous character, and
malicious disposition of the above-mentioned islanders, as it has
been frequently remarked, that such serious defects are much more
generally found among islanders than among the inhabitants of
continents. However, be this as it may, we shall only further remark,
that the <i>Patsjallang</i>, owing to the strength of the current,
was not able to proceed, but was obliged to return to the
<i>Vossenbosch</i>, having first discovered within this inlet an
island, five miles in circumference, on which was found very good
drinking water and a tiger was met with; a number of snipes also were
seen on another island, which lay at the entrance of this strait, and
of which</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 172}</u></p>

<p>more is said in the journal of the sloop <i>Waijer</i>, under the
date of the eighteenth and nineteenth of May. The weather here was
observed to become much colder.</p>

<p>The fourth inlet of those visited by the expedition, called Delft
Bay, runs five or six miles inlend, and demands little further notice
than as to its position and depths, both of which are to be found
clearly stated in the journals and maps, also that it is called on
one side of its mouth, Rustenburg, and on the other side in the old
maps, it is known under the name of Maria's land, in which district
the inhabitants were so stupid, that they attempted to tow the
patsjallang, while lying at anchor, with three little canoes, but
seeing that no progress was made, they tried to effect their object
by tugging at the anchor. This also proving ineffectual, they
returned to the shore. Our men employed themselves daily in fishing,
the fish here being plentiful, but of no great size, and attempted to
arrest the increasing sickness on board.</p>

<p>The fifth and last inlet E. visited by our people, is bounded on
one side by the promontory of Lonton, on the other side by the point
of Callemore (names given to them by the crew), although the last
mentioned point may rather he called an island than a promontory,
since the inlet runs round it and again joins the sea. In front of
the point Lonton, also an island was found, called by them Schildpads
island; nothing remarkable is to be recorded of this place, except
that at night, by moonlight, an immense number of black birds, as
large as pigeons, were met by the patsjallang <i>Hollandia Nova</i>,
which flock continued to pass for half an hour; also that the
inhabitants became so much accustomed to our people, that they
assisted them in procuring and carrying water; but afterwards they
could not conceal their malicious disposition, as we have already
narrated.</p>

<p>This last inlet is called Vossenbosch Bay, and also has before the
promontory of Calice a small island, where stands a solitary tree, by
which it may be recognised.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 173}</u></p>

<p>Thus, thinking we have briefly stated the origin, the adventures,
the results and the return of this expedition, so far as they could
be investigated, we shall here conclude.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-16"></a>THE HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS IN 1727, TRANSLATED
FROM A PUBLICATION ENTITLED "DE HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS."<br>
</h3>

<h4>AMSTERDAM, 1857, 8 vo. BY P. A. LEUPE, CAPTAIN OF MARINES IN THE
DUTCH NAVY.</h4>

<p>The ten years which elapsed between 1720 and 1730 were a period
replete with disaster to the East India Company, arising from the
losses they experienced of ships and men, both on their passage out
to India and on their return<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>. Among
the number is the Zeeland ship <i>Zeewyk</i>, which, built in 1725,
sailed from the roads of Rammekens to Batavia, under command of the
skipper Jan Hijns, on the 7th of November, 1726. After peculiar
mishaps the <i>Zeewyk</i> came to anchor on the 22nd of March, 1727,
before the fort of Good Hope in Table Bay, and after taking in fresh
provision there, pursued, on the 9th of June, her voyage on the 21st
of April, 1727, when by the carelessness of the skipper, she was
wrecked on the Houtmans Abrolhos.</p>

<p>By the instructions<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b> for the
sailing in the autumn from the Netherlands to Java, amongst other
things it is also enjoined: "The Cape of Good Hope being doubled, it
is thought good that you sail in an E. Direction between 36&deg; and
39&deg; S. lat., until you have reached a point eight hundred miles
E. of the Cape of Good Hope; that you then</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Appendix V.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*2) Given in the Assembly of the Seventeen, on the 7th
December, 1619.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 177}</u></p>

<p>direct our course as much N. as E., in such a manner that, on
reaching 30 S. lat., you should find yourself about 950 or 1000m.
from the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>"These 950 or 1000 m. from the Cape being attained, it is
advisable--wind and weather permitting--that you bear down upon the
land Eendraght at 27&deg; S. lat., or more to the N., so as to take
thence such a course as will enable you to clear the Tryals Shoals<b
style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, lying about 20&deg; S. lat., without
danger, and to touch at the south coast of Java with ease, in order
to have the weather-gage of the Straits of Sunda, and thus reach
these straits without loss of time. It must be understood that this
is about the time when the east monsoon blows south of the line, and
that the said 900 or 1000 miles E. of the Cape may be reached between
the beginning of March and the end of September. Observe, that the
distance between the Cape and the land of Eendraght is, in reality,
much shorter than the chart shows; and it may happen, by the aid of
currents, that the route may be found even shorter than it really is,
so that the land might be reached in much less time than we are led
to expect. Remember, also, that the land of Eendraght has, south of
27&deg; lat., many perilous sandbanks, and that the soundings are of
sharp rocks. Consequently, extreme caution, and the constant use of
the lead at night and in stormy weather, is indispensably necessary,
as at seven, six, or five miles from the coast the soundings are
found to be one hundred, eighty, or seventy fathoms."</p>

<p>To these "perilous sandbanks and soundings of sharp rocks" belong
also the Frederick Houtman Abrolhos, which, according to Horsburgh<b
style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>, lie at 29&deg; 10' S. lat., and
113&deg; 57' E. long., and upon which many a ship of the company
will</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 178}</u></p>

<p>have perished; since, in addition to the <i>Batavia</i> in 1629,
the <i>Vergulde Draeck</i> in 1656, the <i>Ridderschap van
Holland</i> in 1693, and the <i>Zuysdorp</i> in 1711, two others
occur in the list here subjoined as lost between the Cape of Good
Hope and Batavia.</p>

<p>The Englishmen who visited these sandbanks in 1840 found several
remains of wrecked ships; thus writes Mr. Crawford Pako:<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>"I will relate a few circumstances which were of great interest to
us, as marking the position of ancient voyagers, who two hundred
years before were similarly engaged to ourselves, and undergoing
trial and probation such as we were then exposed to.</p>

<p>"Finding anchorage for our ship at the S.E. part of the southern
group, near to a narrow strip of sand on the edge of the reef, which
was scarcely large enough to be called an island, we found on it some
remains of large timber, evidently a beam of a ship, through it an
iron bolt of considerable dimensions; but corrosion had gone on so
steadily so many years, that the slightest touch reduced it to the
size of small wire. Near this were found various other fragments,
which most probably had been part of the same vessel; but the most
remarkable item was a copper coin of the East India N. Company, a
doit bearing the date 1620 (I think), which was good evidence that
these were some of the remains of commodore Pelsart, in the ship
<i>Batavia</i>. So the anchorage which we occupied was named by us
Batavia Roads, and that particular group Pelsart's Group. On another
island at the west side of the same group we found</p>

<blockquote>[*1) <i>Sic</i> in original. The editor does not find
this name in the English navy. There is, in all probability, a
mistake in the transcript of the word given as Pako. The passage
quoted is stated in a note to have occurred in a letter dated March
31st, 1853, addressed to Captain Wipff of the Dutch navy, then
commanding the corvette <i>Sumatra</i> off Sydney.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 179}</u></p>

<p>many other relics of more recent date, among which another doit,
which was dated 1700, which we concluded marked the position of the
loss of the <i>Zeewijk</i> in 1720. On this island we found a large
number of small glass bottles, about the size and form of a Dutch
cheese, very orderly arranged in rows on the ground; a few very large
glass bottles of similar form; some large brass buckles which had
been gilded, and much of the gilt still existed. Numerous small clay
pipes, which served to solace our crew with the help of tobacco, as
doubtless they had done long ago for former owners. And one brass
gun, about three pounds calibre, with a iron swivel, the iron,
however, was diminished by corrosion to nearly nothing; it had a
moveable chamber for loading it, which was fitted for a square hole,
on the upper part of the gun near the breech. But what was most
remarkable about it was that vermilion paint was still on the muzzle.
The island on which this was found we called Gun Island, and the
passage between the Pelsart Group and the middle one was called
Zeewyk Channel."</p>

<p>I have had the good fortune to find among the papers of the late
East India Company, what was written by the Government of Batavia
about the loss of the ship <i>Zeewijk</i> to the directors at home,
together with a map made by the skipper Jan Steyns, while on these
shoals.</p>

<p>"<i>To the Directors of the Assembly of the Seventeen,
etc.</i></p>

<p>"On the 26th of April a letter<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>
unexpectedly came to hand by the patchialang <i>De Veerman</i>, from
the late skipper and under-merchant of the Zeeland ship
<i>Zeewyk</i>, Jan Steyns and Jan Nibbens, written from the Straits
of Sunda, but without date communicating the fact that this vessel,
after leaving the Cape of Good Hope on the 21st. of April, had been
wrecked, on the 9th of June, on the reef lying before the islands
Frederick Houtman's Abrolhos, situated near</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Appendix I and III.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 180}</u></p>

<p>the Southland, in S. lat. 29&deg;, and otherwise called the
Tortelduyff's Islands. The crew had, in favourable weather, succeeded
in recovering all kinds of necessaries from the wreck, and had
constructed from the fragments of the ship a vessel, on which,
setting out the 22nd of March, they arrived in the above straits on
the 21st of April, numbering eighty-two souls, and bringing with them
the moneys of the Company contained in ten chests to the value of Fl.
315,836:1:8. All this will more clearly appear from the subjoined
copy of the letter (together with a list of the survivors, their
names and rank on board before the wreck), to which we respectfully
refer you, as also to an extract from the resolution passed on that
day. From this will also be seen the care shown by us for the
recovery of the money, in our despatching at once to the distressed
vessel (which was suffering from want of fresh water) the
advocat-fiscal of India, Mr. Jacob Graafland, with two commissioners
from the Council of Justice, assisted by the secretary and usher of
the court, provided with the necessary vessels, together with one
sergeant, two corporals, and twelve privates, and there was also
found a small slip,<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> without
signature, written by the skipper, in which he complains of the
outrageous behaviour of the crew, so that we could not but conclude
that some of the company's chests must have been broken open, and the
contents stolen, as it very frequently happens under such unfortunate
circumstances. Wherefore the above-mentioned commissioners were duly
instructed to take means to prevent the concealment of the company's
moneys. But the precaution proved unnecessary, as they arrived here
happily on the 30th, to the great relief of the company's heavy
losses of money, with the above-mentioned vessel and the ten money
chests, which were found to be complete according to the invoice. In
addition to this was also received a small bag, containing two
hundred and seven pieces of Spanish</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Appendix II.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 181}</u></p>

<p>reals, handed over by the Directors of the Chamber, Middelburg, in
Zeeland, to the officers of this ship, for the purchase of fresh
provisions, which also was saved. Moreover various sums in silver
ducats, as specified in the memorial, a copy of which is subjoined,
were found upon the crew. On that same day, namely, the 30th of
April, the advocat-fiscal was instructed to report to the government
as to whether an action could be brought by it against the pretended
owners, who had fetched that money out of the wreck, the fact of
their having it in their possession being in our opinion a violation
of the law which forbids the export of coined money to private
persons. His answer is to be found in a copy subjoined. But
afterwards he was obliged, as a matter of official duty, to put the
law in force, and an indictment was accordingly issued against the
claimants before the Council of Justice, whose decision is still
pending. We are nevertheless of the opinion that salvage ought to be
allowed to the men who, at no inconsiderable danger to themselves,
brought the money from the wreck. The journals kept on the voyage, as
far as they were saved and brought over, were, in accordance with the
resolution of the 30th of April, handed over to the Equipagemeester,
Coenrad Mels, and a committee of skippers, under the presidence of
the above-mentioned fiscal, as it appeared to us rather doubtful
whether the ship had not been wrecked in an inexcusable manner. And,
indeed, it was subsequently proved by the report of the committee,
that the former skipper, Jan Steyns, had not only run too near the
Southland, contrary to his orders, and in opposition to the protests
of the steersmen, and thereby caused that disaster: but had also
contemplated deceiving the government by altered and falsified
journals, in order to hide as much as possible his indefensible
conduct. Whereupon, on the 17th of August, it was determined to
indict the said Jan Steyns before the Court of Justice, and he has
since been placed under arrest.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<blockquote>[*1) These papers have not been sent over.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 182}</u></p>

<p>"The position of the islands against the most outlying reef of
which the <i>Zeewyk</i> was wrecked, is shown by the accompanying
maps. They lie out of sight of the Southland, and are partly
overgrown with some edible wild plants. On them were found not only
some excavated wells, but also some signs of a Dutch ship, probably
wrecked against the above-mentioned reef, which might have been the
<i>Fortuyn</i> or <i>Aagtekerke</i>, whose crew may have died or
perished at sea on their way hither. This also seems to have been the
fate of the boat of the <i>Zeewyk</i>, which, under the command of
the upper-steersman Pieter Langeweg, with eleven common sailors and
the papers of the Company, had set out for this port shortly after
the wreck of the ship, in order to give information of the mishap and
to ask for assistance. Up to this time nothing has been heard of
it.</p>

<p>"We cannot without painful feelings think of the heavy
misfortunes, from which the Company has been a sufferer during the
last nine or ten years, especially in the loss of many ships and
treasures, which mishaps have to our great concern been considerably
increased in number, not only by the disaster which befell the ship
<i>Luchtenberg</i>, on the Wielingen, on the Zeeland Banks, shortly
after leaving port, as communicated to us by the Directors of several
Chambers, and particularly by the letter from Amsterdam of the 8th of
January; but also by the misfortunes that befell the other ships that
had sailed for this country in company with that ship on the 2nd of
November, 1727, and were obliged to put into several harbours in a
disabled state. Again, by the stranding on the 3rd of July, in Table
Bay, of the ships <i>Middenrack, Stabroeck</i>, and <i>Haarlem</i>,
of which the <i>Middenrack</i> was dashed to pieces and lost all
hands, except the few who were on shore at the time, while the two
others were driven so close on shore that all hope of safety was
abandoned, but succeeded so far as to run their prow aground, whereby
the crew and money were saved, and the remainder</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 183}</u></p>

<p>of the cargo was recovered from the ship undamaged by the sea
water. The cargoes of these two stranded ships together with three
boxes containing amber from the <i>Middenrack</i>, which was washed
ashore, have already been brought over by the ships <i>Meyenberg</i>
and <i>Nieuwvliet</i>, they having, through God's blessing, happily
ridden through this awful storm from the N.W., not without extreme
danger. The ship <i>Hillegonde</i> also lost its rudder and
<i>goodgings</i>, and had to be helped into Saldanha Bay. Thus we
shall not be able to make use of it here for some time to come, any
more than, as we fear, of the ships <i>Berkenrode</i> and
<i>Heenhoven</i>, which had not yet appeared at the Cape on the 18th
of July. This is the more alarming, as the <i>Heenhoven</i>, on the
9th of February, in the north, at about 570 L., parted through stress
of weather from the consorts <i>Meyenberg</i> and <i>Haerbroeck</i>,
in whose company it had left Zeeland on the 24th of January. However
we hope soon to welcome the arrival of the above-mentioned two ships,
under the blessing of the Most High, who also is besought henceforth
to ward off all disasters from the ships and the establishment of the
company, and to make them prosperous in all things; so that the crew
of the outward-bound ships may not be afflicted so severely by
sickness and death, as has been the case of late with several ships,
to such an extent, that it has been necessary to reinforce them one
from the other at the Cape; whereby, since the departure of the ship
<i>Meerlust</i>, in sixteen ships from Holland, only 1375 sailors,
575 soldiers, and 40 artisans, in all 1990 paid servants, including
the sick, have come over."</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX, NO. I.</b></p>

<p>TO HIS EXCELLENCY, AND THE NOBLE COUNCILLORS OF THE NETHERLANDISH
INDIA</p>

<p>We take the liberty of informing you, that, in sailing from the
Cape of Good Hope to Batavia with the company's late ship
<i>Zeewyck</i>, we were wrecked on a reef on the ninth of June, 1727,
at seven o'clock in the evening, in the first watch.</p>

<p>The reef against which the vessel struck, is surrounded by a very
high and heavy surf, and runs in the shape of a half moon. On the
inner side lie many small islands, called Frederick Houtman's
Ambrollossen (Abrolhos), which we gained on the eighteenth of June
and upon which we remained from that day, until we had fetched from
the wreck everything that seemed to us necessary for the preservation
of our life, spars, ropes, timber and provisions. As soon as we had
got these materials on shore, our carpenter at once set to work with
his men, by order of the officers, and by the help of the common
people, to build a vessel, so that we might save our lives, if it
pleased Gad. We called it the <i>Sloepie</i>, that is, the little
sloop, made up from the wreck of the <i>Zeewyck</i>. When it was
ready for sea, we made sail with a south wind and fair weather on the
twenty-sixth of March, having with us the money chests of the
company, as well as provisions for the voyage. We continued to enjoy
favourable weather throughout the voyage, and so arrived by God's
blessing, on the twenty-first of April, 1728, in the Straits of
Sunda, eighty-two souls, of whom, we herewith subjoin a list for the
information of your nobility and council. We beg to wish you and the
council from the bottom of our heart, every prosperity and happiness,
and present respectfully our humble services.</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX II.</b></p>

<p>My High Excellency, together with the Council of the Netherlandish
India, I pray of you most urgently to send me help and assistance
against these robbers of the money and the goods of the wreck
<i>Zeewyk</i>, who have divided the money and goods among themselves.
I am stark naked; they have taken everything from me. 0, my God! They
have behaved like wild beasts to me, and everyone is master. Worse
than beasts do they live; it is impossible that on board a pirate
ship things can be worse than here, because everyone thinks that he
is rich, from the highest to the lowest of my subordinates. They say
among themselves, "Let us drink a glass to your health, ye old
ducats!" I am ill and prostrate from scurvey.</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX III</b></p>

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE DELIBERATION AND RESOLUTIONS IN THE COUNCIL OF
INDIA</p>

<p>Monday, April 26th, 1728.</p>

<p>At five o'clock this afternoon we received a letter by the
patchialang <i>De Veerman</i>, very unexpectedly and fortunately,
from the former skipper and under-merchant of the ship <i>Zeewyk</i>,
bound for these parts, written in the Straits of Sunda, but undated,
reporting the wreck of the ship on the reef lying before the Islands
Frederick Houtman's Abrolhos, near the Southland, at 280 L., on the
9th of June of last year. The crew having afterwards fetched several
necessaries from the wreck, made from the timber a sloop or vessel,
on board of which eighty-two souls have reached these straits,
together with the money taken out by the ship, consisting of three
tuns, according to the double invoice received. But, besides that
letter, there also came to hand a little card, unsigned, apparently
in the handwriting</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 186}</u></p>

<p>of the skipper, in which he complains in unmistakable terms of the
behaviour of the crew so that we cannot but suppose that the money
chests have been broken open, in order that so splendid a booty might
be divided. Therefore, on the motion of the Governor-General, it was
resolved to send out at once to the assistance of the suffering
vessel and crew, who were obliged, in default of fresh water, to put
up with salt water for some time. Accordingly the brigantine <i>De
Hoop</i>, and the sloop <i>De Olyftack</i>, and the patchialangs
<i>De Snip</i> and the before named <i>Veerman</i>, being made ready
by order of his excellency, the advocat-fiscal of India, Mr. Jacob
Graafland, with two commissioners from the Council of Justice,
assisted by the secretary and usher, together with one sergeant, two
corporals, and twelve private soldiers, were dispatched, in order
that the ready money might be secured without delay, as much of it,
that is, as might still be found. Further, a thorough search was to
be made after the remainder, both among the crew and in all the
corners and nooks of the sloop, which has been put together by
them.</p>

<p>This said sloop no other vessels shall be allowed to approach,
with the sole exception of that on board of which the commissioners
are; so that all possibility may be removed from any clandestine
transfer of the stolen booty to another crew, and of the noble
company's being thus injured by a complot of a gang of expert
thieves. The guilty ones shall be seized and subjected to an
exemplary punishment, as a warning to all other evil doers in similar
lamentable and fatal occurrences.</p>

<p>The Trials. About two hundred years have elapsed since the
instructions here mentioned were drawn up, and still</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 187}</u></p>

<p>these cliffs belong to the "doubtfuls." To what is this to be
attributed? Do they in reality not exist at all? The
Governor-General, Antonio Van Diemen, to whom the science of
geography is so deeply indebted did not doubt their existence. He
thus writes to the Governor of Mauritius, Adrian van der Hael, on the
2nd of September, 1643.</p>

<p>"The yacht <i>Cleen Mauritius</i>, has like the former ships bound
for these parts, not seen anything of the Trials. This, however,
proves nothing. Those who could discover those shoals (as they are
usually called) in coming from your country, must be ordered to touch
at the Southland at about 270 S.L., or Dirk Hartog's Reede; they must
then sail as far north as 20&deg;, when they would find themselves
about fifty miles E. of the Trials. They then have to sail W., as
there is no doubt that they lie in 20&deg; S.L."</p>

<p>It may also not be unnecessary to quote in full the following
statement, taken from the "Vertooninge van Eylanden, Custen, Havens,
en Bayen a&deg; 1757, door den E. Capiteyn D. van Schilde en Schipper

his voyage out in the ship t' Vaderland Getrouw, under date July
21st, 1707<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>, about his falling in
with the Trials.</i></p>

<p>In the morning, at seven o'clock, in the day watch, we saw the
littie islands of the Trials' Shoals, at E. by E. well E., about five
miles from us, being three in number, the most southerly of them
running up to a sharp point and hanging over towards the S.E. being
at its top a little rounder than the one in the middle, but lower
than the north one, and a little more pointed. We also saw a high
pointed cliff south of the islands.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we saw the surf breaking E.N.E.&frac12; N.</p>

<p>a short mile from us, and four from the island. We at once turned
away towards the S.W., heaved the lead, and found fifty-seven fathoms
water, with a bottom of fine sand and rocks.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we encountered a storm with rain from the S.W.
and S.S.W. by S. Turned again to the W., ran in that direction till
noon, then put our course N.W.; heaved the lead and found sixty-five
fathoms, bottom as before. Took the bearings of the pointed island,
lying E.N.E., at five and a half to six miles distance from us, and
found the longitude to be 124&deg; 34'; I had calculated it at

corrected my reckonings. Afternoon wind S. and S.S.E., blowing at
top-sail and top-gallant-sail breeze, with fog and drizzle. In the
evening, again heaved the lead, but found no bottom. Shortened sail
in order to heave the lead during the night. First watch, water of a
pale tint. Heaved the lead several times, but no bottom found. Held
on at N.W. to the beginning of the day-watch; steered N.; wind at
night S.S.E. and S.E., top-sail and top-gallant-sail breeze.<b style=

<p>According to a letter in the <i>Nautical Magazine</i> of the year
1843, p. 392, the Trials were also seen by the Dutch ship
<i>Jacobus</i>, captain Louwerens. It is worthy of remark, that this
observer places them in the same longitude, whilst the latitude
differs by about 1&deg;.</p>

<p>The late veteran captain C. Brandligt has assured me that he saw
them; but he could not find the journals by which he wished to prove
the statement to me.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) 1 The Zeeland ship <i>Vaderland Getrouw</i>, sailed
from Rammekens on the 6th of January, 1707, arrived on the 5th of May
at the Cape, left Table Bay on the 31st of the same month, and came
to anchor before Batavia on the 5th of August.--U. S. Nautical
Magazine and Naval Journal, 1856, No. 4.]</blockquote>

<p>"Rocks and shoals in the ocean have been frequently seen and their
true position given, but on further search could not be found. Now,
scientific men may dream, but I am under a strong impression that
they do exist; but, from some unknown causes, the ocean has its rise
and fall, and they are seen at the lowest ebb only."</p>
