  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; THE CROQUET PLAYER INTRODUCES HIMSELF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I have been talking to two very queer individuals and they
  have produced a peculiar disturbance of my mind. It is hardly an exaggeration
  to say that they have infected me and distressed me with some very strange
  and unpleasant ideas. I want to set down what it is they have said to me in
  the first place for my own sake, so as to clear up my thoughts about it. What
  they told me was fantastic and unreasonable but I shall feel surer about that
  if I set it down in writing. Moreover I want to get my story into a shape
  that will enable one or two sympathetic readers to reassure me about the
  purely imaginative quality of what these two men had to say.</p>

  <p>It is a sort of ghost story they unfolded. But it is not an ordinary ghost
  story. It is much more realistic and haunting and disturbing than any
  ordinary ghost story. It is not a story of a haunted house or a haunted
  churchyard or anything so limited. The ghost they told me about was something
  much larger than that, a haunting of a whole countryside, something that
  began as an uneasiness and grew into a fear and became by slow degrees a
  spreading presence. And still it grew&mdash;in size, in power and intensity.
  Until it became a continual overshadowing dread. I do not like this ghost
  that grows and spreads, even though it does so only in the mind. But I had
  better begin at the beginning and tell about this story as far as I can, and
  the manner in which it came to me.</p>

  <p>But first I had better give a few particulars about myself. Of course I
  would rather I did not, but I doubt if you will realize my position without
  it. I am probably one of the best croquet players alive, and that I am not a
  bit ashamed of saying. I am also a first-rate archer. One is neither of these
  things without a considerable amount of discipline and balance in one's make-
  up. Many people, I know, find me a trifle effeminate and ridiculous because I
  make croquet my game; they say as much behind my back and at times they
  betray it to my face, and I admit there have been moments when I have been
  inclined to agree with them. But on the other hand quite a lot of people seem
  to like me, everybody calls me Georgie in an affectionate manner, and on the
  whole I am inclined to like myself. It takes all sorts to make a world and I
  see no sense in pretending to be the human norm when one is not. Regarded
  from a certain angle I am no doubt a soft, but all the same I can keep my
  head and temper at croquet and make a wooden ball perform like a trained
  animal. Even at tennis I can make some of the fiercer sort extremely cross
  and silly. And I can do sleight-of-hand tricks, for which you certainly need
  nerve and complete self-possession, as well as most professionals.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact a lot of these tremendous sporting people, record-
  breakers, gamblers, and so on, are much more akin to me than they like to
  think. There is a lot of sham in their pretension to hairiness and virility.
  At heart they are as tame as I am. They have chosen to be boxed up in games.
  I suppose cricket and hockey and so on are more gladiatorial than my sort of
  sport, aviation and motoring more lethal, and gambling more vexatious, but I
  do not see there is any greater reality in what they do than in what I do.
  Risk is not reality. They are players just as I am a player. They are
  enclosed with me in the same pleasant round of harmless and fruitless
  activities.</p>

  <p>I admit I have had an exceptionally uneventful life. I missed the
  experience of the Great War by a couple of years and my life has always been
  an extremely sheltered and comfortable one. I was brought up by my paternal
  aunt, Miss Frobisher, THE Miss Frobisher of the Barton Chapel Case and the
  Woman's World Humanity Movement, and it is only slowly that I have come to
  realize that my upbringing was&mdash;if I may be paradoxical&mdash;unusually
  banal. I have led a life largely of negatives and avoidances. I have been
  trained to keep calm and civil and not react excitedly to surprises. And
  above all to regard only ordinary decent everyday things seriously.</p>

  <p>My aunt took me over at the age of three when my parents divorced and
  since then she has never let go of me. She is a woman with what, to be frank,
  one might call a natural hostility to sexual facts, and my parents'
  misbehaviour&mdash;those were the days when the papers published full reports
  of divorce cases&mdash;and some of the details of the affair shocked her
  extremely. When I went to school at Harton, she took a house close by and
  entered me as a day-boy, and she did practically the same thing while I was
  at Keeble. Possibly I am naturally just a little inclined to be what the
  Americans call a sissy, and this tendency has been favoured by these
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>I have soft hands and an ineffective will. I prefer not to make important
  decisions. My aunt has trained me to be her constant associate and, with
  displays and declarations on all possible occasions of an immense maternal
  passion for me, she has&mdash;I know it clearly&mdash;made me self-indulgent
  and dependent. Yet I do not blame her very much or resent it very much. It is
  how we two have been made. She has always been rich and free to do as she
  liked, not only with herself but with others, and I have always felt well off
  and secure. Our lives have been easy so far. Like most well-born, well-off
  people, we have taken inferiors for granted, servants for granted, and the
  general good behaviour of the world towards us. I suppose there are still
  hundreds of thousands of people in the world as sure of all the material best
  of life as we are and taking it in the same matter-of-course fashion.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?" we ask. "Where shall we go?" Nobody compels us. We are
  the floating cream of humanity.</p>

  <p>We have a house in Upper Beamish Street, a modest little place in
  Hampshire, and we move about a lot. My aunt, as many people know, is a very
  temperamental woman&mdash;I do not mean temperamental in any unpleasant sense
  &mdash;and sometimes we are as keen as mustard on this Woman's World Humanity
  Movement&mdash;though I have never clearly understood what it is all about
  &mdash;travelling over the world for it&mdash;so far, that is, as there are
  bathrooms en suite, upon which my aunt insists&mdash;"making contacts,"
  usually until there is a difficulty over the committee election or something
  of that sort and my aunt gets disgusted, and then for a year or so we drop
  Woman's World Humanity and go round wiping up the lawns with croquet
  champions or winning tassels with our archery. We are both quite
  extraordinarily good at the long-bow, and my aunt has been painted as Diana
  by Wilmerdings. But croquet is our especial gift. If we did not shrink from
  the publicity and vulgarity of it we could certainly be champions. We also
  play a pretty decent tennis game and our golf might easily be worse, but the
  popular criticism of tennis has been carried to such high levels that we do
  not care to be seen playing, and golf we find mixes us up with all sorts of
  people. Sometimes we just recuperate. Lately we have been recuperating at Les
  Noupets after a rather discouraging conference of the Woman's World Humanity
  Movement at Chicago. (The less said about those American delegates the
  better, but my aunt was fully equal to them.)</p>

  <p>That I think is a quite sufficient explanation of myself and my
  atmosphere. The two club lawns at Les Noupets were excellent, and we found an
  admirable secretary typist who dealt with my aunt's very extensive
  correspondence about the movement and particularly with her libel case
  against Mrs. Glyco-Harriman, taking it all down in shorthand, typing it in
  the afternoon, and bringing it for revision after tea. There were one or two
  sets of niceish people with whom a little light conversation was possible
  without entanglement. Croquet an hour before lunch and perhaps in the
  afternoon again and dinner at eight. We never play bridge until after dinner;
  it is our inflexible rule. So that I had a certain amount of time upon my
  hands while she wrote what would be in the case of anyone without her
  provocation extremely abusive as well as sarcastic letters, which I devoted
  chiefly to a morning's walk up the hill to the Perona springs, where I took
  the waters, rather for fun than with any idea of a cure, and then sat in a
  state of wholesome idleness on the terrace of the Source Hotel removing the
  inky taste by appropriately chosen refreshment. My aunt is inclined to a
  non-alcoholic attitude, but of late years I have found the unobtrusive
  exercise of my private judgment in such matters not only permissible but
  better for both of us. I mean I am a more cheerful companion.</p>

  <p>I think all that gets me fairly well and now with your permission I will
  put myself into the background, so to speak&mdash;or "frame" perhaps is
  better&mdash;and tell you about the first of these two queer men I met on the
  Perona terrace.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; HAUNTING FEAR IN CAINSMARSH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was while I was sitting out on the terrace in the sun,
  nibbling a brioche and consuming a harmless vermouth and seltzer, that I
  first set eyes on Dr. Finchatton. He was two tables away and he was having an
  almost violent quarrel with a number of books he had got from the Les Noupets
  tea shop and lending library. He was opening them one after another, reading
  a few pages, turning them over, muttering, and banging them down on the
  ground with an emphasis that would have distressed the library people
  extremely. He looked up and caught my reproving eye. He stared and then
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Scores of books," he said; "hundreds of books&mdash;and not one worth
  reading! They're all&mdash;OFF it."</p>

  <p>There was something comical and irrational about his disgust that amused
  me. "Then why read them?" I asked. "Reading crowds the memory and prevents
  one thinking."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I want to do. I came over here to stop thinking&mdash;and
  forget. And I can't." His voice, which to begin with was clear and distinct,
  rose to an angry note. "Some of these books bore&mdash;some irritate. Some
  even remind me of just what I am trying to forget."</p>

  <p>Stepping over his heap of condemned volumes he came, glass and carafe in
  hand, and without any invitation from me sat down at the table beside me. He
  looked me in the face with an expression that was at once friendly and
  slightly quizzical. I know my face is&mdash;well, "cherubic"&mdash;for a man
  of thirty-three and it was very evident he appreciated the fact. "Do YOU do
  much thinking?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A fair amount. I solve the Times Crossword Puzzle nearly every day. I
  play a lot of chess&mdash;by correspondence chiefly. And I'm not so bad at
  bridge."</p>

  <p>"I mean real thinking. About things that pursue and worry you and cannot
  be explained."</p>

  <p>"I don't let things worry me," I said.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to be interested in ghosts&mdash;and hauntings?"</p>

  <p>"I'm neutral. I don't believe in ghosts but I don't DIS-believe in them.
  If you follow me. I've never seen a ghost. I think there is a lot to be said
  for spiritualism, quite a lot, in spite of much imposture. I suppose
  immortality has been proved now by that sort of thing, and that is all to the
  good. My aunt Miss Frobisher is quite of that opinion. But I feel that the
  necessary table-rapping and cabinet séances and all that is a job for a
  specialist."</p>

  <p>"But suppose you found there were ghosts all about you?"</p>

  <p>"I never have."</p>

  <p>"And there's nothing&mdash;here for instance&mdash;that makes you feel
  uneasy?"</p>

  <p>"Where?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"THERE," he said and waved a hand at the tranquil sea and the innocent
  sky.</p>

  <p>"Why should there be?"</p>

  <p>"But IS there?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I envy your insensitiveness&mdash;or your imperturbability." He emptied
  his glass and ordered another half-litre of wine. Either out of ignorance or
  preference he was drinking red ordinaire. "YOU don't feel there is anything?
  No danger?"</p>

  <p>"I never saw a more tranquillizing view. Not a cloud."</p>

  <p>"It isn't so with me... I've had some very disturbing experiences. I'm
  still disturbed. Curious! You feel nothing. Maybe it's just the aftermath of
  what has happened."</p>

  <p>"What HAS happened? And what is the aftermath?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to tell you," he said. "It's rather a yarn, you know."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said I.</p>

  <p>And with that much introduction he began to tell me his story. He was
  rather disconnected at first and then he settled down to it. He told it to me
  not as though he particularly wished to tell it to me, but as though he
  wanted very badly to tell it to someone and hear how it sounded. After he had
  got started, I interrupted very little.</p>

  <p>It was indiscreet of me perhaps to let him begin upon me. I knew nothing
  of him. I had to ask him for his name before he named himself. Evidently he
  was queer in some way&mdash;I should have remembered that the big house above
  the town was supposed to be a "Home" for mental cases, a psychotherapeutic
  institution as they call them nowadays, and the discreet thing for me would
  have been to have sheered off there and then upon some excuse before his
  story began.</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing about him to warn me off him. There was nothing
  eccentric in his manner or indeed in his general appearance. He had the jaded
  look of a man who doesn't sleep well, a little dark under the eyes, but apart
  from that he seemed quite all right. He was quietly dressed in the
  Englishman's usual grey; he wore a coloured shirt and an unobtrusive tie. It
  was a little askew but that was nothing. Plenty of men never put on their
  ties straight &mdash;though how they can stand it I can't think. It is so
  easy to get a tie straight. He was decidedly lean and fairly good-looking,
  with what I suppose one would call a sensitive mouth below his short
  moustache. He leant forward most of the time with his arms folded under his
  chest much as a cat folds up its paws. He talked perhaps just a little on the
  emphatic side but he seemed on the watch to control himself. And as I had a
  full hour or more to dispose of, before I went down to Les Noupets again, I
  let him run on, without any attempt to interrupt him or cut him short.</p>

  <p>"At first," he said, "I thought it was the marshes."</p>

  <p>"What marshes?"</p>

  <p>"Cainsmarsh. You have heard of Cainsmarsh?"</p>

  <p>I used to be pretty good at geography at school but I could not recall
  that name. But I did not like to admit my ignorance on the spur of the
  moment. Something about the word seemed familiar. "Marsh" seemed a clue.
  Vague suggestions of fenny country, watery expanses, a louring sky, dank
  black thatch, moored old barges, and the hum of mosquitoes floated across my
  mind.</p>

  <p>"A great district for malaria and rheumatic complaints," he said,
  confirming my impression. "I bought a practice there... Forgive a touch of
  autobiography. I did so partly because it was an exceptionally cheap practice
  and I had to earn a living somehow with my small resources and partly because
  I wanted to leave the hospital and London&mdash;and rest my brain. I went
  there jaded and disappointed. It seemed likely to be an easygoing job. There
  is practically no competition in the marshes, not until you get towards the
  part they call the Island, where the market-town doctors come out in their
  cars. The parishes up towards the hills, such as they are, and out towards
  the saltings are quite beyond their range except for special consultations. I
  had to go into practice with a minor qualification because of the need I was
  under for tranquillizing surroundings... I threw up the prospect of a medical
  degree."</p>

  <p>He paused as though he found a difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Were you ill?" I inquired, to help him out. "Why DID you leave the
  hospital with a minor qualification? Forgive me making a personal remark but
  you don't look the sort of man who muffs exams."</p>

  <p>"I didn't muff exams. In fact I was more than usually ambitious. I worked,
  I think, too hard. And I was active mentally in other directions. I was
  keener on politics than most medical students. And I got very keen on social
  justice and the prevention of war. Very keen on the war question. I had been
  working on gas. Perhaps I DID too much. Perhaps I thought and felt too
  much... Yes... Yes, certainly I felt too much. A time came when the morning
  paper could upset me so as to spoil my work for the day.</p>

  <p>"From the very beginning of my medical education you must know I found
  myself under a strain. I admit that. I didn't like dissection, I didn't like
  the damaged human stuff in the wards. Some of it was pitiful; some of it
  horrified me."</p>

  <p>I agreed with him. "Doctoring has always terrified ME. <i>I</i>couldn't
  stand any of it."</p>

  <p>"But the world must have doctors," he said.</p>

  <p>"It won't have ME for a doctor. I've never seen more than three dead
  people, and they were all lying quietly laid out in bed."</p>

  <p>"But on the road? You come upon dreadful sights."</p>

  <p>"We never travel by road. All sane people are giving it up."</p>

  <p>"You, I see, have avoided the ugly side of life from the first. Well
  &mdash;I didn't. I walked right into it when I chose medicine. I thought of
  the good I could do and I never thought of the harsh red realities I should
  have to face. You avoided. I tried not to avoid and then I ran away. I went
  to that district with the full idea of escape. This, I told myself, will be
  away from any war there is or any bombing. Here I can recover myself. Here, I
  said, there will be nothing except normal cases I can really face and help.
  Cainsmarsh is far from any main roads. There won't be even motor casualties,
  which are often so frightful to encounter. You see my point? It looked as
  good as any possible world for me, and going there in summertime with the
  wild flowers out and a hundred sorts of butterfly about, dragon-flies and an
  abundance of summer birds, let alone a lot of summer visitors, mostly
  houseboat and fishing people with children and their small ailments, there
  didn't seem to be very much wrong with it. I would have laughed if you had
  told me that I had come into a haunted land.</p>

  <p>"I did all I could to protect myself from over-stimulation. I did not have
  a newspaper in the house. I relied on a weekly news summary with no
  illustrations but diagrams. I wouldn't open a book later than Dickens.</p>

  <p>"The native population seemed at first just a trifle stupid and reserved
  but quite kindly. I saw nothing wrong with them to begin with. Old Rawdon,
  the vicar of Cross in Slackness, that landmark church of the levels, told me
  that there was a good deal of furtive drugging because of the ague and that
  he suspected the genuineness of their amiability. I went to pay my respects
  to him as soon as I was able. He was an elderly man and rather deaf and he
  had exchanged to the Cross in Slackness living because of his infirmity. His
  church and vicarage were stranded, so to speak, with one or two cottages on a
  sort of crocodile back of land, and they were overgrown with elm trees. I
  doubt if even as many as a score of people came to his services. He was not
  very communicative, his old bent wife was even less so, he had trouble with
  gallstones and an ulcerated contusion of the ankle, and his chief
  preoccupation seemed to be with the high-church tendencies of his
  fellow-priest, a newly arrived curate at Marsh Havering. Apparently he
  himself was low church and Calvinistic, but at first I could not understand
  the mixture of fear and resentment with which he spoke of the younger man.
  There were no landed gentry in Cainsmarsh, and, except for a veterinary
  surgeon, a few elementary teachers, one or two publicans, and some
  middle-class boarding-house keepers towards Beacon Ness, the population was
  entirely a population of farmers and farm workers. They had no folk-lore, no
  songs, no arts, and no special costume. A more improbable soil for anything
  you could call psychic it would be hard to imagine. And yet you
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He frowned and spoke in measured words, as if he was doing his utmost to
  be explicit and was reasoning against the possible objections I might
  presently make to what he had to tell me.</p>

  <p>"After all ... It is in just such a flat, still atmosphere perhaps
  &mdash;translucent, gentle-coloured&mdash;that things lying below the
  surface, things altogether hidden in more eventful and colourful
  surroundings, creep on our perceptions..."</p>

  <p>He paused, drank a glass of his wine, reflected for a moment, and
  resumed.</p>

  <p>"There can be no disputing the stillness of that district. Sometimes I
  would stop my car on one of the winding dike roads and stand listening before
  I went on again. One would hear the sheep upon the lavender-coloured hills,
  four or five miles away, or the scream of some distant water fowl, like a
  long, harsh scratch of neon light across the silent blue, or the sound of the
  wind and the sea, a dozen miles away at Beacon Ness, like the world breathing
  in its sleep. At night of course there were more noises: dogs howled and
  barked in the distance, corncrakes called, and things rustled in the reeds.
  And yet the nights too could sometimes have a stillness...</p>

  <p>"At first it did not seem to be of any particular significance that the
  traceable consumption of soporifics and opiates by this apparently
  insensitive population was not only quite remarkably high but increasing, nor
  that the proportion of suicides and inexplicable crimes&mdash;inexplicable as
  distinguished from normally motivated offences&mdash;over this part of the
  world was exceptional and apparently rising. Dealing with such a small
  population, however, a murder more or less could upset the percentage
  altogether. Face to face in the daylight there was nothing at all murderous
  in the bearing of these people. They did not look you in the eye&mdash;but
  that may have been their idea of good manners. It just happened that there
  had been no less than three crazy murders of relations and neighbours in
  Cainsmarsh in the past five years, and of two of them the perpetrators were
  still undiscovered. The other was a fratricide. The vicar, when I spoke about
  this, said something about 'degenerate race&mdash;too inbred' and changed the
  subject, as though it was an unpleasant topic of no particular importance for
  him.</p>

  <p>"The first real intimation I had in my own person, of the brooding
  strangeness that hangs over Cainsmarsh, was an attack of insomnia. Hitherto I
  had been a fairly sound sleeper but before I had settled in the Marsh for a
  couple of months my nights began to be troubled. I would wake up in a state
  of profound uneasiness, and without any physiological cause that I could
  trace I fell a prey to evil dreams. They were quite peculiar dreams, like
  none I had ever dreamt before. They were dreams of menace, of being waylaid,
  stalked, and pursued and of furious struggles to defend myself, dreams out of
  which I would wake shouting&mdash;you know those faint shadowy shouts of
  dreamland conflicts&mdash;sweating and trembling in every limb. Some of these
  dreams had so strong a flavour of horror that they would leave me afraid to
  go to sleep again. I would try to read, and whatever I read in the night
  watches an eerie discomfort hung over me.</p>

  <p>"I adopted all the expedients that would naturally occur to a young
  medical man to end these enervating experiences, but without avail. I dieted.
  I exercised. I would get up and dress, go out either on foot or in my car, in
  spite of a strong fear resistance. Fear pursued me out of those dreams. The
  nightmare quality hung about me and could not be shaken off. I was awake and
  still dreaming. Never have I seen such sinister skies as I did on those night
  excursions. I felt such a dread of unfamiliar shadows as I had not known even
  in childhood. There were times on those nocturnal drives when I could have
  shouted aloud for daylight as a man suffocating in a closed chamber might
  shout for air.</p>

  <p>"Very naturally this inability to sleep began presently to undermine my
  daily life. I became nervous and fanciful. I found I was giving way to minor
  hallucinations, rather, I suppose, after the pattern of delirium tremens. But
  with more menace in them. I would turn convulsively under the impression that
  a silent hound was creeping up to attack me from behind, or I would imagine a
  black snake wriggling out from under the valance of an arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"Presently came other symptoms of relaxing mental control. I found myself
  suspecting the Island doctors of a combination against me. The most petty
  incidents, small slights, breaches of etiquette, fancied imputations, had
  been seized upon by my imagination and worked up into the fabric of a
  conspiracy mania. I had to restrain myself from writing foolish letters or
  making challenges and asking questions. Then I began to find something evil
  in the silence or in the gestures of some of my patients. And while I sat by
  their bedsides, I fancied that there were hostile goings-to-and-fro and
  malignant whisperings and conspirings just outside the door.</p>

  <p>"I could not understand what was the matter with me. I searched my mind
  for nervous stresses and I could find none. I had surely left all that behind
  in London. Temperature and so forth remained normal. But clearly there was
  something askew in my adjustment to these new surroundings. Cainsmarsh was
  disappointing my expectations. There was no healing in it for me. I had to
  pull myself together. I had sunk all my little capital in the practice and I
  had to stick it. There was nowhere else for me to go. I had to keep my head
  and grapple with this trouble and beat it before it became too much for
  me.</p>

  <p>"Was it just my own trouble? Was something specially wrong with me or was
  it something wrong with the countryside? Were there other people in the Marsh
  having dreams and fancies like mine, or maybe was this a trouble that came to
  newcomers and passed away? Was it something I should get over? A sort of
  acclimatization. I had to be careful with my inquiries because it is not well
  for a doctor to admit he is out of sorts. I began to watch my patients, my
  old servant, and anyone with whom I came in contact for any betrayal of
  symptoms similar to mine. And I found what I looked for. Beneath the
  superficial stolidity a number of these people were profoundly uneasy. There
  was fear in the Marsh for them as for me. It was an established habitual
  fear. But it was not a definite fear. They feared something unknown. It was a
  sort of fear that might concentrate at any time upon anything whatever and
  transform it into a thing of terror.</p>

  <p>"Let me give you some instances.</p>

  <p>"One evening I found an old lady stiff with dread at a shadow in a corner,
  and when I moved her candle and the shadow moved, she screamed aloud. 'But it
  can't hurt you,' I argued. 'I'm afraid,' she answered, as though that was a
  sufficient answer. And suddenly before I could prevent her she had seized a
  little clock on the night table beside her and flung it at that dark and
  dreadful nothingness, and buried her head under the clothes. I will confess
  that for a moment or so I stood rigid and expectant staring at the broken
  clock in the corner.</p>

  <p>"And one day I saw a farmer who was rabbit shooting pause, stare aghast at
  a fluttering scarecrow, and then, unaware of my presence, suddenly raise his
  gun and blow the poor dangling old rapscallion to bits.</p>

  <p>"There was an unusual terror of the dark. My old servant, I found, would
  not venture out after twilight to the pillar box a hundred yards away. She
  would make every sort of excuse and when she was cornered she refused
  absolutely to go. I had to go myself or leave my letters until the morning.
  Even sweethearting, I learnt, would not tempt the young people abroad after
  sundown.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," he said, "how the perception of the presence of fear
  grew upon me and grew upon me&mdash;how it infected me&mdash;until at last
  the flap of a window blind in the breeze or the fall of a cinder in the
  fireplace would set my nerves aquiver.</p>

  <p>"I could not shake this off; my nights got worse. I determined to have a
  real talk about this queer uneasiness of the mind, with the old vicar. In his
  way, you see, the district was his business, as in my way it was mine. He
  ought to know whatever was to be known. By this time the disorder was getting
  a strong hold upon me. I made up my mind to go to him after a night of
  exceptional horror and dismay. I was indeed already pretty bad...</p>

  <p>"I can recall here and now the unprotected feeling of my drive to him
  across the open marshes. They seemed to me far too open, bare to endless
  dangers. And yet when I came near a clump of trees or bushes it took on the
  quality of an ambush. The normal confidence of a living creature was
  deserting me. I felt not simply exposed to incalculable evils, I felt
  threatened by them. In broad daylight, mind you; in the sunshine. With
  nothing but a few birds in sight...</p>

  <p>"As it happened I caught the old man in a communicative mood. I put my
  questions plainly to him. 'I'm a newcomer in this country,' I said. 'Is there
  something&mdash;something PECULIARLY wrong about it?"</p>

  <p>"He stared at me and scratched his cheek, weighing what he should tell me.
  'Yes,' he said, 'there is.'</p>

  <p>"He led me into his study, listened for a moment as if to make sure that
  everyone was out of earshot, and then closed the door carefully. 'You're
  sensitive,' he said. 'You're getting it sooner than I did.
  Something&mdash;wrong&mdash;wrong and getting worse. Something evil.'</p>

  <p>"I remember those opening words very plainly and his bleary old eyes and
  the bad teeth in his sagging mouth. He came and sat down quite close to me
  with one long bony hand cupping his hairy ear. 'Don't speak too loud,' he
  said. 'If you speak distinctly, I can hear.'</p>

  <p>"He said he was glad to have someone to talk it over with at last. He told
  me how he had hoped to end his days in the Marsh quietly and how gradually
  this shadowy discomfort had come over him, deepening slowly into fear. He
  could never afford another exchange. He too was fixed. It was hard to talk
  about. His wife would never talk to him about it. Before they came to Cross
  in Slackness, they had been the best of friends and gossips. 'Now,' he said,
  'it is pushing us apart. I have to talk to myself. I don't know what's come
  over her.'</p>

  <p>"'What is pushing you apart?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'The Evil.'</p>

  <p>"That was his name for it.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, he said, was being pushed apart. You began to find sinister
  possibilities in the most ordinary relations. Lately he had had a curious
  suspicion of his food&mdash;had fancied a queer taste in it and queer
  feelings after it. 'It makes me fear for my reason,' he said. 'My reason or
  hers.' Yet all the same, it was queer about the food. Why should
  anyone&mdash;? He left it at that. At his first coming the common people had
  seemed simply dull to him. Then he had begun to realize that they were not so
  much dull as reserved and suspicious. You would catch a glance in their eyes
  like a dog that may snap. Even the children, when you came to watch them,
  were furtively defensive. For no reason. For no reason at all. He told me
  that, sitting very close to me, not speaking too loud.</p>

  <p>"He came closer. 'They are cruel to animals,' he told me. 'They beat their
  dogs and horses. Not regularly. By fits.</p>

  <p>"'The children come to school with marks on them,' he said... 'You can't
  get them to say anything... They are afraid.'</p>

  <p>"I asked him if he felt that this thing, whatever it was, was increasing.
  Had it always been there? There was very little recorded history of the
  region. He thought it was increasing. Things had not always been like this. I
  suggested that it may have always been in the atmosphere of the place and
  that we became more aware of it as we fell under the spell.</p>

  <p>"'Maybe. Partly that,' said the old vicar.</p>

  <p>"He gave some broken fragments of a story about a former incumbent. He and
  his wife had been sent to prison for cruelty to a servant girl. Prison! They
  said she told lies and had dirty habits. As an excuse. They wanted to cure
  her, they said. But really they just hated her... Never anything against them
  before they came into the Marsh.</p>

  <p>"'It's always been here,' whispered the old vicar. 'Always. Below the
  surface. An unhappy, wicked spirit that creeps into us all. I pray. I do not
  know what would happen to me if I did not pray. What with the waste of money
  and the rudeness of everybody and the malicious mischief they do me and the
  stone-throwing. Let alone the poison. It is the poisoning hurts me most.'</p>

  <p>"We talked like that in his big shabby, sparely furnished study in the
  broad daylight, like men who cower in a cave.</p>

  <p>"And then he began to talk less sanely. The evil was in the soil, he
  declared, UNDERGROUND. He laid great stress on the word 'underground.' He
  made a downward gesture with his quivering hand. There was something mighty
  and dreadful, buried in Cainsmarsh. Something colossally evil. Broken up.
  Scattered all over the Marsh. 'I think I know what it is,' he whispered
  darkly, but for a time he would not explain.</p>

  <p>"They kept on stirring it up, he said, they would not let it rest.</p>

  <p>"Whom did he mean by THEY? That was difficult. There had been road-
  making, there have been drainage works and now 'those archæologists'! And
  that was not all. There had been a ploughing of old pastures during the war.
  Opening old sores. 'You see over all the place was once a wilderness of
  graves.'</p>

  <p>"'Tumuli?' I questioned.</p>

  <p>"'No,' he insisted. 'Graves&mdash;graves everywhere!' And some of the
  ancient people, he said, were 'petrified.' You found stones of the strangest
  shapes. Abominable shapes. 'They keep on bringing things up,' he said.
  'Things that had better be let alone. Ought to be let alone. Making doubts
  and puzzles &mdash;destroying faith.'</p>

  <p>"At a jump he was denouncing Darwinism and evolution. It was remarkable
  how life-long controversies had interwoven with his Cainsmarsh distresses!
  Had I seen the museum at Eastfolk? he asked.</p>

  <p>"He talked of the great bones exhibited there. But I protested he was
  thinking of the bones of mammoths and dinosaurs and suchlike things. Giants,
  he insisted. Look at what they call implements there! Too big and clumsy for
  any living man to handle. Axes, spears&mdash;nothing but huge weapons for
  killing and killing! 'MURDER STONES' he called them. The murder stones of
  giants.</p>

  <p>"He clenched his bony fist, his quavering voice rose, and real hatred came
  into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing is too bad,' he said, 'for the men who dig up those bones.
  Tearing up dark secrets. Seeming to confute... A grave's a grave and a dead
  man's a dead man, even if he's been dead a million years. Let the evil
  creatures lie! Let them lie! Let their dust lie!' He ceased to be furtively
  confidential; his anger rose and thrust his fear aside. He no longer troubled
  to listen to anything I had to say in reply to him.</p>

  <p>"He was soon launched upon the wildest diatribe. He was transfigured by an
  anger that shook his feeble frame. He had fixed upon the local archæologists
  and naturalists as the chief objective for his tirade, but mixed up with that
  in the oddest and most illogical way was his detestation of the high-church
  practices that had been introduced by the new man at Marsh Havering. Just
  when this Evil was being released and rising like an exhalation from the
  earth, when the one supreme need of the time was religion straight and
  stern&mdash;'STRAIGHT AND STERN,' he repeated and shook his fingers in my
  face&mdash;this man must come with his vestments and images and music and
  mummery!</p>

  <p>"But I will not give you, if I could, an imitation of that poor old wreck
  as he grew fiercer and louder and hoarser. He wanted suppression, he wanted
  persecution of Science, of Rome, of every sort of immorality and immodesty,
  of every sort of creed except his own, persecution, enforced repentance, to
  save us from the Wrath that was coming steadily upon us. 'They turn up the
  soil, they strip things bare, and we breathe the dust of long-dead men.' It
  was as if he was trying to escape from our common marshland obsession by
  sheer screaming violence. 'The doom of Cain!' he shouted. 'The punishment of
  Cain!'</p>

  <p>"'But WHY Cain?' I managed to insert.</p>

  <p>"'He ended his days here,' the old man declared. 'Oh, I know! Is this
  called Cainsmarsh for nothing? He wandered over the face of the earth and at
  last he came here, he and the worst of his sons. They poisoned the earth. Age
  after age of crime and cruelty, and then the Flood buried them under these
  marshes&mdash;and there they ought to be buried for ever.'</p>

  <p>"I tried to argue against this fantasy&mdash;Cainsmarsh is just a
  corruption of Gaynes Marsh, as all the guide books say; it is written Gaynes
  in Domesday Book&mdash;but the old man bore me down. My voice had no chance
  now amidst his croaking assertions. His deafness was a shield against all
  argument. His voice filled the room. He poured out the festering
  accumulations of his brooding solitude. His sentences had the readiness of
  long-matured expression. I guess most of it had been uttered, time and again,
  to the faithful remnant of Cross in Slackness church. He had got the children
  of Cain and the cave men and the mammoths and megatheria and dinosaurs all
  jumbled up in the wildest confusion. It was a storm of preposterous nonsense.
  And yet&mdash;and yet, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dr. Finchatton regarded the bay of Les Noupets in silence for a few
  moments.</p>

  <p>"Out of it all came a suggestion. I doubt if it will seem even remotely
  sane to you&mdash;in this clear air. But it was the suggestion that this
  haunting something was something remote, archaic, bestial..."</p>

  <p>He nodded his head in doubtful confirmation of what he was saying.</p>

  <p>"You see ... It's bad enough to be haunted by Georgian ghosts, Stuart
  ghosts, Elizabethan ghosts, ghosts in armour and ghosts in chains. Yet
  anyhow, one has a sort of fellow-feeling for them. They aren't just spirits
  of cruelty, suspicion, and ape-like malice. But the souls of a tribe of cave
  men might be... Grisly ghosts... What do YOU think?"</p>

  <p>"One may be as possible as the other," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. And yet, if cave men, why not apes? Suppose all our ancestors rose
  against us! Reptiles, fish, amoebæ! The idea was so fantastic that, as I
  drove away from Cross in Slackness, I tried to laugh."</p>

  <p>Dr. Finchatton stopped short and looked at me.</p>

  <p>"I COULDN'T LAUGH," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't think <i>I</i> could have done," I said. "It's a frightful idea.
  I'd rather be haunted by a man than an ape any day."</p>

  <p>"I drove back home more saturated with terror than I came. I was beginning
  to see visions now everywhere. There was an old man bending down in a ditch
  doing something to a fallen sheep and he became a hunched, bent, and
  heavy-jawed savage. I did not dare look to see what he was doing and, when he
  called something to me&mdash;maybe only a good-day-to-you&mdash;I pretended
  not to hear. Whenever a clump of bushes came near the road, my heart sank and
  I slackened pace and, as soon as I was past, I jammed down the
  accelerator.</p>

  <p>"I got drunk, Sir, for the first time in my life that night. You see, it
  was either getting drunk or running away. Maybe I'm still a young doctor, but
  that's my code. A doctor who quits his practice without notice is as bad as a
  sentinel who bolts. So you see, I had to get drunk.</p>

  <p>"Before I went to bed I found I was funking opening the front door to look
  out. So with a convulsive effort I flung it open wide...</p>

  <p>"There crouched the marshes under the moonlight and the long low mists
  seemed to have stayed their drifting at the slam of the door against the
  wall. As if they paused to listen. And over it all was something, a malignant
  presence such as I had never apprehended before.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I stuck to my doorstep. I did not retreat. I attempted even
  a drunken speech.</p>

  <p>"I forget what I said. Maybe I myself went far enough back to the Stone
  Age to make mere inarticulate sounds. But the purport was defiance&mdash;of
  every evil legacy the past has left for man."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; THE SKULL IN THE MUSEUM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At this point in his narrative Dr. Finchatton stopped
  abruptly. "This sounds a crazy story to you?" he said. "Do you want me to go
  on with it?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," I spluttered. "I mean, yes, please. I mean, do PLEASE
  go on. I'm tremendously interested. But sitting here at this table with
  everything bright and clear and definite, there is a certain unreality ... If
  you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> understand you," he said without returning my smile. He looked
  round. "It does seem here as though nothing except vermouth and seltzer and
  lunchtime presently, and things like that, could ever happen any more."</p>

  <p>A look of extreme weariness came over him. "I'm resting," he said. "Yes.
  But sooner or later I shall have to go back to it all. I'd like to go on
  talking about it a bit&mdash;to you. If you don't mind. There's something
  &mdash;if I might say so&mdash;so refreshingly unimaginative about you. Like
  white paper."</p>

  <p>At the time I was quite prepared to go on listening. I was oblivious then
  of the possibility that this story might ever disturb my own slumbers. I keep
  dreams for waking moments but I like them then. Fancies and reveries. I
  welcome them. One dreams then but one feels quite safe. There may be shivers
  in it but no real fear. It is just because they ARE impossible that I like
  impossible stories. Ever since I discovered Edgar Allan Poe in my early
  boyhood I have had a taste for the weird and the eerie, and in spite of my
  aunt's opposition &mdash;she flies into a regular passion at the suggestion
  that anything irregular or unusual can ever occur&mdash;I have&mdash;in an
  unobtrusive way&mdash;indulged it pretty freely. Her imagination, I think,
  was killed long ago, but mine I've made into a domestic pet that I like to
  play with. I do not think it will ever claw me seriously; it's a pussy now
  which knows where to stop. Though I am not so sure of that as I was. But it
  was very pleasant to be there, safe and solid, in the clear Normandy
  sunshine, and hear about those terror-stricken marshes. "Go on, my dear Sir,"
  said I. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Dr. Finchatton, "I put up as much fight as my training and
  quality permitted. Getting drunk and that speech of defiance, even if in fact
  I imagined it rather than made it, did me good. I slept that night, good
  forgetful sleep, for the first time for weeks, and next day rose refreshed to
  reckon with my situation. Trained as I was, it was natural for me to assume
  that this common ailment of fear and fantasy, this sickness of a whole
  region, must be due to some virus in the air or the water or the soil. I made
  a private resolution to drink water only after it had been boiled and eat
  only well-cooked food. But also I was quite open to the idea that something
  less material might be at work. I am no prejudiced materialist. I was quite
  prepared to believe in purely psychic infection&mdash;though not of course in
  these Sons of Cain of the vicar's. I decided next morning that I would
  investigate that high-church curate at Marsh Havering, the Reverend Mortover,
  the object of the vicar's peculiar detestation, and find what HE might have
  to say about it.</p>

  <p>"But I found the young man as mad as his Calvinistic colleague. If the old
  man mixed the trouble up with science and excavations and Romanism, the young
  man blamed the Reformation and made great play with the Puritan witch mania
  of the sixteenth century. Some spiritual control was broken then, he assured
  me with the utmost confidence. Diabolism had returned to the earth. It was
  not the ghost of Cain and his wicked sons that was troubling us, according to
  him; it was diabolical possession. We have to restore the unity of
  Christendom and exorcize these devils.</p>

  <p>"He was a very pale, clean-shaven young man, with a fine clear-cut face,
  burning dark eyes, and high-pitched tenor voice. He made few gestures and he
  kept his thin hands clenched as he talked. If he had been in the Roman
  Catholic Church instead of being just a high Anglican, they would have set
  him to conduct missions. He had just that sort of eloquent intensity. And
  there he sat in his cassock, looking up and away over my shoulder and
  expounding the exorcism of the marshes.</p>

  <p>"As he talked I could see that his head was full of long, slow processions
  winding across the marshes with banners, canopies, vestments, boys chanting,
  censers swinging, priests asperging. I thought of the old vicar peering out
  of his dirty study window and I had a vision of him running out hoarse and
  stumbling, with murder in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"'But,' I told him, 'there will be opposition!' and at that the manner of
  Mr. Mortover changed. He stood up and threw out a stiff hand like an eagle's
  claw. 'It must be overcome!' said he, and in that instant I understood why
  men are killed in Belfast and Liverpool and Spain."</p>

  <p>That was queer. I interrupted. "But, Dr. Finchatton, what have Belfast and
  Liverpool and Spain to do with Cainsmarsh?" I asked.</p>

  <p>That brought him to a stop for a moment. He looked at me with a very
  peculiar expression, something between suspicious scrutiny and obstinacy. "I
  was talking of Cainsmarsh," he said after deliberation.</p>

  <p>"Then what have Belfast and Spain to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I mentioned them, I suppose&mdash;by way of illustration... Let
  me get it! Let me get it! What I was thinking of was fanaticism. Both these
  men, the vicar and the priest, had their convictions&mdash;yes. High and
  noble convictions, no doubt, as they professed them. But what they really
  wanted to do was to fight. They wanted to be at each other's throats. That
  was where the haunting poison of the Marsh came in. It wasn't their beliefs
  that stirred them; it was their fears. He wanted to shout and provoke...</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;so for that matter did I. Why had I bawled and raved at the
  Marsh out of my door over night? And shaken my fist?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me almost as if he expected me to answer.</p>

  <p>"The Greeks had a word for it," he said. "Panic. Endemic panic, that was
  the contagion of the marshes."</p>

  <p>"That may be a name for it," I said. "But how much does that explain?"</p>

  <p>"You realize," said Dr. Finchatton, "that by this time I was in a headlong
  panic against panic. I felt that my time was running short. If I did not do
  something to exorcize it, the spirit of the Marsh would get me&mdash;surely.
  I should break. I should do something violent. I happened to have nothing
  very pressing just then to tie me, and I determined to play hookey from my
  consulting room for half a day and go over to Eastfolk museum. I would have a
  good reassuring look at those mammoth bones, which under the vicar's
  suggestion were beginning to take on far too human a form in my memory, and
  perhaps have a chat with the curator, who, I had heard, was an archæologist
  of considerable ability.</p>

  <p>"I found him a very pleasant little man, with a broad bland bare face and
  spectacles and a sort of watchfulness. He had that sort of watchfulness good
  photographers and portrait painters have, and it was the only thing that was
  not altogether comfortable about him. I caught him looking at me whenever I
  turned away from him...</p>

  <p>"I professed a great interest in the flint implements which are so
  abundant in the low hills above the marshlands and about the series of human
  remains that had been unearthed there. He was an enthusiast and he found me
  intelligent. He embarked upon quite a history of the region. 'It must have
  been inhabited,' I said, 'for thousands of years.'</p>

  <p>"'Hundreds of thousands,' he told me. 'There were Neanderthalers and
  &mdash;But let me show you our special glory!'</p>

  <p>"He led me to a locked glass cupboard in which was a thick louring beetle-
  browed skull, that still seemed to scowl from its empty sockets. Beside it
  was its under jaw. This dirty rusty-brown treasure, he said, was the
  completest specimen of its kind in the world. It was almost unbroken. It had
  already settled a dozen controversies arising out of the fragmentary nature
  of its fellows. There were also a few vertebræ from the neck and a curved
  thigh bone and a lot of smaller fragments in a case close by, but the entire
  fissure in which these remains had been found had not yet been cleaned up,
  because the bones were half dissolved and very brittle and had to be
  extracted very carefully. The fissure was being worked with elaborate care.
  In the end they hoped to get almost an entire skeleton. Two or three very
  primitive and clumsy artifacts had also been found in this same cleft in the
  chalk, down which maybe the brute had slipped and been jammed and covered up.
  The little curator watched me as I surveyed his prize specimen and marked the
  snarling grin of its upper jaw and the shadowy vitality that still lurked in
  the caverns whence its eyes had once glared upon the world.</p>

  <p>"'That might, I suppose, be our ancestor?' I said.</p>

  <p>"'More probable than not.'</p>

  <p>"'That in our blood!' I said.</p>

  <p>"I turned half round and looked at the monster askance and, when I spoke
  again, I spoke as if he also might be listening. I asked a score of
  amateurish questions. There had been countless generations of him and his
  kind, I learnt. His sort had slouched and snarled over the marshes for a
  hundred times the length of all recorded history. In comparison with HIS
  overlordship our later human rule was a thing of yesterday. Millions of these
  brutish lives had come and passed, leaving fragments, implements, stones they
  had chipped or reddened by their fires, bones they had gnawed. Not a pebble
  in the marsh, not an inch of ground, their feet had not pressed or their
  hands gripped a myriad times.</p>

  <p>"'Just something a little bit dreadful about him,' I said, talking
  vacuously while I made up my mind. Then I decided to put a question point-
  blank. I asked the curator had he heard&mdash;had he ever met the idea that
  the Marsh was haunted?</p>

  <p>"The scrutiny in the magnified eyes behind the glasses intensified. He had
  heard something.</p>

  <p>"'WELL?' said I.</p>

  <p>"But he wanted me to speak first. He waited silently, and so I was forced
  to go on. I told him practically all that I have told you. 'The marshes have
  got hold of me,' I said. 'And if I do not do something about it, they will
  drive me mad. I can't stand them and I have to stand them. Tell me why it is
  one dreams there so dismally, why one is haunted by fear in the daylight and
  horrible fears in the night?'</p>

  <p>"'You're not the first who has come to me with that question,' he said,
  still watching me.</p>

  <p>"'And you can tell me,' I said, 'what it is?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' he said.</p>

  <p>"He was a careful man with his words as well as a watchful one with his
  eyes. He explained he went into the marsh to excavate and so he saw something
  of the people. 'They don't like these excavations,' he said. 'I have never
  heard of so much distrust of digging in any other part of the world. Maybe it
  is a strong local superstition. Maybe fear is contagious. They certainly
  fear. And I think they fear more today than they used to do. It is often very
  hard now to get permission to dig on private land.'</p>

  <p>"I could see he was not telling me all he had in mind. He seemed to be
  saying things to me experimentally, as if he was trying out his ideas on me.
  He remarked that he never slept in the marsh even in the daytime. At times
  when he was sifting earth he would stop to listen, and resume sifting, and
  then stop still again. 'Nothing to hear,' he said, 'and yet one gets strung
  up like that.'</p>

  <p>"He came to a pause. I saw him looking very hard and with a peculiar
  expression at the cave man's skull against the wall between us.</p>

  <p>"'You don't think an ugly beast like that could really leave a ghost?' I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"'It's left its bones,' he said. 'Do you think it had anything you could
  call a spirit? Something that might still be urgent to hurt and torment and
  frighten? Something profoundly suspicious and easily angered?'</p>

  <p>"It was my turn to stare at him.</p>

  <p>"'You do not really believe that. You are suggesting that to me. For some
  purpose.'</p>

  <p>"He laughed, still with a steady eye on me. 'If so, I have failed,' he
  said. 'But I did want to suggest it to you. If we can make a ghost of this
  fear of yours&mdash;well, ghosts can be laid. If we make a fever of it, fever
  can be cured. But while this remains merely panic fear and a smouldering
  rage, what can we do about it?'</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you,' said I, 'to try and pull me together in that fashion,
  truss my mind, so to speak, for exorcism. It isn't so easy as that.'</p>

  <p>"And then," said Dr. Finchatton, "he switched off that hypnotic
  bespectacled stare of his and began to talk to me more frankly.</p>

  <p>"What he said was rather metaphysical," Dr. Finchatton said, "and I am not
  much of a metaphysician. It was queer theoretical stuff and yet, in a way, it
  had a sort of air of explanation. I will try and tell it you as well as I
  can. The expression he used was that we were breaking the frame of our
  present &mdash;the Frame of our Present?"</p>

  <p>Dr Finchatton looked at me enquiringly. I remained judicial. I had not the
  remotest idea what the frame of our present might be. "Go on," I said.</p>

  <p>"He stood with his profile to me, no longer watching me, looking out of
  the window and saying what was in his mind. 'A century or so ago,' he said,
  'men lived in the present far more than they do now. Their past went back
  four or five thousand years, their future hardly went as far; they lived for
  NOW. And what they called the eternities. They knew nothing of the remote
  real past. They cared nothing for the real future. THAT'&mdash;and he nodded
  at the cave-man's skull, 'just wasn't there. All that was buried and
  forgotten and out of life. We lived in a magic sphere and we felt taken care
  of and safe. And now in the last century or so, we have broken that. We have
  poked into the past, unearthing age after age and we peer more and more
  forward into the future. And that's what's the matter with us.'</p>

  <p>"'In the marsh?' said I.</p>

  <p>"'Everywhere. Your vicar and priest know that by instinct though they
  don't know how to express it&mdash;or anyhow they don't express it as you and
  I do. Sometimes it's nearer the surface in the marsh&mdash;but its
  everywhere. We have broken the frame of the present, and the past, the long
  black past of fear and hate that our grandfathers never knew of, never
  suspected, is pouring back upon us. And the future opens like a gulf to
  swallow us up. The animal fears again and the animal rages again and the old
  faiths no longer restrain it. The cave-man, the ancestral ape, the ancestral
  brute have returned. So it is. I can assure you I am talking realities to
  you. It is going on now everywhere. You have been in the marsh. You have felt
  them in the marsh, but I tell you these resurrected savageries are breathing
  now and thrusting everywhere. The world is full of menace&mdash;not only
  here.' He stopped short and his spectacles flashed as he looked at me and
  then stared again out of the window.</p>

  <p>"'But,' said I, 'this is all very fine and mystical but how does it help
  me? What am I to do?'</p>

  <p>"He said this was a mental thing and it had to be fought out in the
  mind.</p>

  <p>"'I have to go back to the marsh this evening.'</p>

  <p>"He went on saying that the frame of the present was shattered and could
  never be restored. I had to open out&mdash;'open out', he said&mdash;and
  enlarge my mind to a vaster world where the cave-man was as present as the
  daily paper and a thousand years ahead was on the doorstep. 'That is all very
  well,' I said, 'but what does it mean? What am <i>I</i> to do now? I am
  asking you; what am <i>I</i> to do now?'</p>

  <p>"His regard came back to me. 'Fight it out if you can,' he said. 'Go back.
  You won't escape by running away. Go back and have one more round with
  whatever you choose to fancy it, the Evil, the Fear, the Ghost of Cain or
  THAT fellow's ghost&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"He paused and we both looked round at the clumsy skull as though we felt
  it might have something to say in the matter.</p>

  <p>"'Broaden your mind to the new scale,' he resumed, rather more
  confidentially. 'Face it if you can. And then if you still find you are
  slipping, you must try to get help. You should go off to London and have a
  definite treatment. The man you should see is Norbert, of&mdash;I think it is
  391 Harley Street, but I can get that for you. He has been one of the first
  men to realize this spreading miasma of the mind of which you are suffering
  and devise some sort of treatment for it. To tell you the truth, he has
  helped me. Though his methods are rough and strange. I had some slight touch
  of your trouble, and as I happened to know about him I called him in. And
  early. He flies over to Les Noupets once or twice a week. There's a clinic
  over there...'</p>

  <p>"So much for the curator of the Eastfolk museum. For the time he pulled me
  together. His modern scientific lingo was something I could understand. I
  felt that I was no longer being hunted darkly and strangely and beyond any
  possibility of help; I was just an experimentalist facing a disagreeable and
  risky but by no means impossible challenge.</p>

  <p>"But I had no luck in that last round with the ghosts of the cave-men,"
  said Dr Finchatton. "I went back while it was still daylight. At the very
  outset before I reached my house I came upon something dreadful. It was a dog
  that had been beaten to death. Yes; beaten to death! You may think that in
  this world where so many terrible things are happening a cruelly ill-treated
  dog was no great matter. It was to me.</p>

  <p>"I saw it lying among the nettles by the roadside. I thought some motorist
  must have run over it and thrown it aside. I got down to look at it and make
  sure that it was dead. It wasn't simply dead; it was battered to a pulp. With
  some blunt heavy instrument. There couldn't have been a whole bone left in
  it. Somebody must have rained blows upon it, a frantic whirlwind of
  blows.</p>

  <p>"For a medical man I know I am over-sensitive. At any rate I went on
  through the sunshine in a state of horror, at nature, at the deep fountains
  of cruelty in the human make-up. What frantic outburst had destroyed that
  poor brute? And then I had hardly been back in my house ten minutes when
  another shock arrived. This again may seem a small matter to you. To me it
  was overwhelming. A breathless messenger came on a bicycle from the vicarage
  of Cross in Slackness. He was so scared that for some moments I could not
  understand what he was telling me, and then I realized that old Rawdon had
  set upon his poor old wife and done his best to kill her. He had knocked her
  down and beaten her. 'The poor old lady!' gasped the boy. 'You better come
  soon. We got him tied up in the outhouse and she's on the bed upstairs scared
  to death &mdash;too frightened to speak. He's raving something frightful.
  Frightful. Says she tried to poison him... The language! ...'</p>

  <p>"I brought out my car again and went over. I managed what I could to make
  the poor old thing comfortable; he hadn't hurt her so much as I feared, a few
  bruises but no bones broken, and it was chiefly shock and amazement she
  suffered from; and presently two policemen came and carried off old Rawdon to
  the police station at Holdingham. I wouldn't go down to see him. She spoke
  just a word or two as she lay there. 'Edward!' she muttered and then in
  amazement 'Oh EDWARD!' And then sharply with a note of terror 'EDWARD!' and a
  weak scream. I gave her a sleeping-draught and arranged for a woman to stay
  the night with her and then I went back to my own place.</p>

  <p>"So long as I was actively employed I kept going, but as soon as I got
  home I found myself slumping. I could eat nothing. I drank a lot of whisky
  and instead of going to bed I fell asleep in an arm-chair by the fire. I
  awoke in terror and found the fire nearly out. I went to bed and when at last
  I got to sleep the dreams closed in on me and I sat up again starkly awake. I
  got up and put on an old dressing-gown and went downstairs and made up the
  fire, determined to keep awake at any cost. But I dozed there and then went
  back to bed. And so between the bed and the fireside I dragged through the
  night. My dreams were all a mix-up of the poor scared old lady, the almost as
  pitiful old man, the ideas the museum custodian had put in my head and,
  brooding over it all, that infernal palaeolithic skull.</p>

  <p>"More and more did the threat of that primordial Adamite dominate me. I
  could not banish that eyeless stare and that triumphant grin from my mind,
  sleeping or waking. Waking I saw it as it was in the museum, as if it was a
  living presence that had set us a riddle and was amused to hear our
  inadequate attempts at a solution. Sleeping I saw it released from all
  rational proportions. It became gigantic. It became as vast as a cliff, a
  mountainous skull in which the orbits and hollows of the jaw were huge caves.
  He had an effect&mdash;it is hard to convey these dream effects&mdash;as if
  he was continually rising and yet he was always towering there. In the
  foreground I saw his innumerable descendants, swarming like ants, swarms of
  human beings hurrying to and fro, making helpless gestures of submission or
  deference, resisting an overpowering impulse to throw themselves under his
  all-devouring shadow. Presently these swarms began to fall into lines and
  columns, were clad in uniforms, formed up and began marching and trotting
  towards the black shadows under those worn and rust-stained teeth. From which
  darkness there presently oozed something&mdash;something winding and
  trickling, and something that manifestly tasted very agreeably to him.
  Blood."</p>

  <p>And then Finchatton said a queer thing. "Little children killed by air-
  raids in the street."</p>

  <p>I made no comment. I remained quietly attentive. It was an "aside", as
  actors used to say. He took up his story where he had left it.</p>

  <p>"Morning," he resumed after an introspective pause, "found me frantic at
  the telephone. At great pains and what I am afraid will prove ruinous expense
  to me, I managed to secure a locum-tenens and forthwith I bolted off to
  London, gripping my sanity so to speak with both hands, to see this man
  Norbert. And it is Norbert who has sent me here... Norbert you know is a very
  extraordinary man. He was not at all what I had expected."</p>

  <p>Dr Finchatton stopped short. He looked at me. "That's all."</p>

  <p>I nodded silently.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"In a day or so, perhaps, I shall begin to think something about it. At
  present I don't know what to say. It's incredible and yet&mdash;you almost
  make me believe it. I mean I don't think it really happened&mdash;I wouldn't
  go so far as that&mdash;but I believe it happened to you."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I'm glad to be able to talk to a man like you. It's what Norbert
  wants me to do. He wants me to familiarize myself with what has just happened
  to me, just in the spirit in which you have taken it, so as to be able to
  distinguish between the realities of my experience, the realities of life, he
  calls them, and the fears and fancies and dreams I have wrapped about them.
  His idea is that I ought to see things UNFEELINGLY. Because after
  all&mdash;what do you think?" He looked at me very earnestly.</p>

  <p>"How much of what I have been telling you is actual concrete happening and
  how much&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;mental reaction? Old Rawdon
  attacking his wife&mdash;that was real. That broken-up dog was real...
  Norbert's idea, you know, is that I should talk it quietly over with anyone
  who &mdash;who seems reasonably balanced and not too worried about the past
  or the future. So as to get these facts as facts and not as dreads and
  horrors. He wants to bring me back so to speak to what he calls a rational
  insensitiveness, rational insensitiveness, that's his formula, and so get a
  firmer foothold for &mdash;whatever I have to do next."</p>

  <p>He gulped down his wine. "It's very good of you to have listened to me,"
  he said, and then as a shadow fell across the terrace before us: "HULLO!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; THE INTOLERABLE PSYCHIATRIST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I disliked the shadow of Dr Norbert even before I looked up
  and saw him. He was and he meant to be an overwhelming sort of man, and
  though I am indolent, self-indulgent and unenterprising I can be as obstinate
  as a whole team of mules. I braced myself for opposition to whatever he
  wanted or had to say before he opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>He was not at all the sort of person I should have expected a
  psychotherapeutist to be. A psychotherapeutist I think ought to have calm
  eyes and a reassuring manner&mdash;and a certain general neatness of
  self-control. He ought to look fresh and healthy and this fellow was
  distinctly cadaverous. He was large and expansive and untidy with lots of
  undisciplined black hair and thick eyebrows, and his large dark and flashing
  eyes either rolled about in his more voluble moments or came to a focus in a
  dramatic pause and glared at you &mdash;not a steady look but a glare that
  pushed at your face and was supported by an immense frown. His features were
  uniformly large, and he had the loose mouth of an orator and a voice of
  remarkable amplitude. He wore an old-fashioned upstanding white collar and a
  loose black bow tie very much under one ear. It was as if he had dressed
  himself once for all in some remote pre-war fashion and never changed it
  since. He looked much more like an actor on vacation than a
  psychotherapeutist. He made me think of the old Punch pictures of the Grand
  Old Man, or Henry Irving or Thomas Carlyle. A more unsuitable figure to
  interrupt a couple of decent-looking modern Englishmen sitting over their
  apéritifs on the terrace of the Perona Source Hotel it would be hard to
  imagine.</p>

  <p>But there he was, entirely unlike anything I could have foreseen, the
  great Dr Norbert, Finchatton's mental healer, hands on hips, looking down on
  me in his most impressive manner. Finchatton had described him as unexpected,
  but the last thing I should have expected was anything so large, so oracular
  and so antique.</p>

  <p>"I have been watching you from above," he said as though he was God
  Almighty. "I didn't want to interrupt while Finchatton was telling his tale.
  But now I perceive you have got through with it and I pounce."</p>

  <p>Finchatton looked at me with a sort of silent entreaty to bear with
  Norbert's extraordinary manner and hear him out.</p>

  <p>"You've heard his story?" Norbert demanded of me.</p>

  <p>His manner did nothing to veil the fact that he was the psychotherapeutist
  and Finchatton was his "case". "He told you about how the cave-man dawned
  upon his mind? He talked about that terror in Cainsmarsh. Good! And the
  growing realization of evil? Well,&mdash;how have you reacted to that? What
  do you, with your manifestly very normal mind, make of it?"</p>

  <p>He thrust his great face, all interrogation, some inches towards me. "Tell
  me in your own words," he said, and waited like a teacher examining a
  child.</p>

  <p>"Dr Finchatton," said I, "has been relating some very extraordinary
  things. Yes. But I should have to think them over a lot before I could pass
  judgment upon them."</p>

  <p>Norbert made the grimace of a teacher dealing with a stupid child.</p>

  <p>"But <i>I</i> want your reactions now. Before you think."</p>

  <p>"You MAY want," said I to myself. "I can't," I said aloud.</p>

  <p>"But it will be of very great importance to Dr Finchatton for you to tell
  me now. Never mind why."</p>

  <p>Suddenly I heard a clock striking. "Good heavens!" I cried, standing up
  and throwing a ten-franc note to the hovering waiter. "I shall keep my aunt
  waiting for lunch! That will NEVER do."</p>

  <p>"But you CAN'T leave this business like this!" said Norbert, featuring an
  incredulous amazement. "You can't. It's your duty to a fellow-creature in
  trouble to hear this case out and help to rationalize it. You MUST help us."
  Glare. "Positively I CAN'T release you."</p>

  <p>I turned to Finchatton. "If Dr Finchatton," I said, "would like to talk
  about it some more ..."</p>

  <p>"Of course he wants to talk to you some more."</p>

  <p>I kept my eyes on Finchatton, who nodded with an intensified appeal.</p>

  <p>"I'll come again," I said. "Tomorrow. About this time. But I can't stay
  now... It's impossible."</p>

  <p>I went down the winding road at something between a walk and a trot
  &mdash;really concerned to be so late, because you know my aunt is simply
  awful if anyone keeps her waiting for lunch. I was already doubtful about the
  promise I had given and a little angry at having been forced to make it. It
  was as if I had admitted some preposterous claim upon my attention and had
  bought myself off.</p>

  <p>I turned my head and saw the two men among those above me, side by side,
  Norbert overshadowing Finchatton.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," I called&mdash;though I suppose I was well out of earshot.</p>

  <p>Norbert made a large gesture.</p>

  <p>Now I did not want in the least to see this Dr Norbert any more. I had
  indeed conceived a violent antipathy for him. I did not like his "You-and-
  Finchatton-are-rabbits-and-now-I-am-going-to-dissect-you" style. I did not
  like his large enveloping voice nor the way his brow and purpose seemed to
  overhang the rest of him. And I detest angular commanding gestures made with
  arms that are much too long. But on the other hand I had taken a real liking
  to Dr Finchatton and developed a very lively interest in his story. I thought
  he had told it very vividly. I wish I could convey the conviction of his
  manner in this transcript. Directly I got away from him I began to think of
  questions I might have asked him and to want to see him again. I regarded
  Norbert as a nuisance who had just butted in upon an interesting tale. I
  dismissed Norbert from my mind and went on thinking of Finchatton.</p>

  <p>There was something about this story of a magic marshland into which a man
  might go sane and confident, admiring the butterflies and the flowers, and
  out of which presently he would come running again frantic with fear and
  rage, that had seized hold upon my imagination very strongly. And the way in
  which that evil old skull, that ancestral skull, lurking unseen at first in
  the background, had slowly become visible&mdash;! It was like something being
  lit up behind a transparency. It was an explanation that was itself an
  enigma. And now, degree by degree, those bare jaws were being clad and
  covered until a phantom lip framed the grinning teeth, and there were dark
  aggressive bloodshot eyes below the beetling brows. The caveman was becoming
  more and more plainly a living presence as the story germinated in my
  mind.</p>

  <p>It was a face at last and not a skull that watched me out of that dream
  story. It was absurd, but indeed it seemed to be watching me. It watched me
  all that evening and it mopped and mowed in the night. It made me inattentive
  so that in the afternoon my combinations at croquet were unusually
  shortsighted and poor, and in the evening I offended my aunt deeply by
  failing to play up to my usual form. She was against me, but as she reckoned
  on my playing up to my usual form, she was surprised and perplexed by the
  things I did and put quite off her game, so that she and her partner lost
  heavily. But I scarcely heeded her reproaches and I undressed slowly, my mind
  full of that distant marshland so mysteriously accursed, so monstrously
  overshadowed now by that brutish revenant. I sat for quite a long time
  thinking it over before I went to bed.</p>

  <p>Next day I got up to the Perona Source Hotel rather late. I had meant to
  be early. I would have taken a tram but an AGENT explained they were not
  running. There had been a lightning strike organized by the Communists and
  there had been a fight at the depot in which several people had been injured.
  'One must be firm these days,' said the agent. Consequently I had to walk the
  whole way. And it was bad luck I thought, to find Dr Norbert stretching out
  his long legs under a table umbrella on the terrace and no signs of Dr
  Finchatton. Norbert motioned for me to join him and I sat down on a green
  chair beside his table. I did so reluctantly. I wanted to make it plain that
  it was Finchatton I wanted to see. I wanted more of the story and I did not
  want any mental probing, judgment dissection, earnest invasion of my private
  thoughts by this pretentious individual.</p>

  <p>"Where's your friend?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He cannot come down today. It is just as well."</p>

  <p>"I thought he had arranged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"HE thought he had arranged&mdash;. But he was prevented. As I say, it is
  just as well."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that."</p>

  <p>"From MY point of view. I want very much to get a common-sense outside
  view of this story that fills his mind. I want it for my own sake as well as
  his."</p>

  <p>"But how can you expect me to contribute?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;for one simple thing; do you know any part of the world called
  Cainsmarsh?"</p>

  <p>He turned round to look at me as he might have looked at an animal he had
  just given an injection.</p>

  <p>"I imagined it was somewhere in fenland."</p>

  <p>"There is no such district in the world."</p>

  <p>"It is a pseudonym?"</p>

  <p>"It is a myth."</p>

  <p>He surveyed me for a moment and then decided that for the present I was
  not worth watching. He put his two long hands palm to palm in front of him
  and spoke with great deliberation staring out to sea. "Our friend," he said,
  "WAS a doctor near Ely. Everything he told you was true and everything he
  told you was a lie. He is troubled beyond reason by certain things and the
  only way in which he can express them even to himself is by a fable."</p>

  <p>"But some of these things&mdash;really happened?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. There WAS a case of gross cruelty to a dog. There WAS a poor old
  drunken parson who beat his wife. Things of that sort are happening all over
  the world every day. They are in the nature of things. If you cannot accept
  things like that, sir, YOU CANNOT LIVE. And Finchatton really went to the
  Tressider Museum at Ely, and Cunningham, the custodian, had the sense to spot
  his condition and send him on to me. But the mischief was already done to him
  before he went into the marsh. He's told you practically everything&mdash;but
  as though he showed it through bottle glass that distorted it all. And the
  reason why he has made it all up into that story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dr Norbert turned upon me, putting his arms akimbo and glaring at my face.
  He spoke with slow deliberation, as if he was speaking in capital letters,
  "&mdash;is because the realities that are overwhelming him are so monstrous
  and frightful that he has to transform them into this fairy tale about old
  skulls and silences in butterfly land, in the hope of getting them down to
  the dimensions of an hallucination and so presently expelling them from his
  thoughts."</p>

  <p>The expression of his face made me uncomfortable. I turned and beckoned
  the waiter for another vermouth in order to recover my composure. "And what,"
  I asked offhandedly, "may those more terrible realities be?"</p>

  <p>"Do you never read a daily newspaper?" asked Dr Norbert.</p>

  <p>"Not very intently. Most of the stuff seems to me to be either pompous or
  wilfully disagreeable. But I do The Times Cross-Word Puzzle nearly every day.
  And I read most of the tennis and croquet stuff and so on. Have I missed
  much?"</p>

  <p>"You've missed the things that have made Finchatton mad."</p>

  <p>"Mad?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't he repeat my phrase?&mdash;endemic panic? A contagion in our
  atmosphere. A sickness in the very grounds of our lives, breaking out here
  and there and filling men's minds with a paralysing, irrational fear?"</p>

  <p>"He did use that expression."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. And it is what I am dealing with here. It is what even I am
  only beginning to realize. A new Plague&mdash;of the soul. A distress of the
  mind that has long lurked in odd corners of the mind, an endemic disorder,
  rising suddenly and spreading into a world epidemic. The story our friend put
  away into a sort of fairyland fenland is really the story of thousands of
  people today&mdash;and it will be the story of hundreds of thousands
  tomorrow. You are untroubled. As yet... Maybe you are immune... It is most
  important to me just now in my study of this increasing malaise that I should
  realize the reaction of an uninfected mind."</p>

  <p>"I've never been good soil for out-of-the-way ideas," I said. "Still I
  don't want to take any risks. You don't think that presently I too shall
  begin to be frightened of the dark and scared in the open, and see ancestral
  apes and savages looming up over the world?"</p>

  <p>He put his big hand across the table and pressed my arm for a moment. "If
  you do," he said, glaring portentously, "have courage."</p>

  <p>It flashed into my mind abruptly that this man was really as mad or madder
  than Finchatton. I put the question to him pat.</p>

  <p>"Dr Norbert, have YOU by any chance&mdash;got infected?"</p>

  <p>The glare became intensified. He lifted up his face so to speak and then
  brought it down like a hammer on the word.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He spoke with such emphasis that my face was bedewed.</p>

  <p>"I was an early case," he said. "I had to deal with myself. There was
  nobody to help me. I had to study myself. I have been through it all, sir.
  And crawled out on the other side. A salted man, immunized. At the price of a
  monstrous struggle..."</p>

  <p>And with that he launched out upon the most astonishing dissertation I
  have ever heard. He made a little pause before the discourse came. What he
  had to say couldn't be said very well from a lounge chair. Presently he was
  sitting up and gripping his chair with both hands. Then he stood up and
  talked and walked about the terrace in front of me&mdash;no longer talking so
  much as orating. I have a fairly retentive memory but it would be impossible
  for me now to give you a full report of all the strange tissue of assertion
  and arguments he poured forth. Some of his phrases and terms of thought I
  will quote. Finchatton's story had sounded like fantasy. This had no quality
  of fantasy about it at all. It began like pseudo-science and philosophy, but
  gradually it became more and more a booming, disconcerting exhortation. We
  were to take hold of life&mdash;GRIP it. Some of his ideas Finchatton had
  already handed on to me. I recognized the phrases. There was that about
  'breaking the Frame of the Present'.</p>

  <p>"But what does that MEAN?" I said almost irritably.</p>

  <p>"Animals," he said, "live wholly in the present. They are framed in
  immediate things. So are really unsophisticated people. Israeli, Sands,
  Murphy, a crowd of people have been working on that." He rattled off a score
  of names but these are all that I remember. "But we men, we have been probing
  and piercing into the past and future. We have been multiplying memories,
  histories, traditions, we have filled ourselves with forebodings and
  plannings and apprehensions. And so our worlds have become overwhelmingly
  vast for us, terrific, appalling. Things that had seemed forgotten for ever
  have suddenly come back into the very present of our consciousness."</p>

  <p>"In other words," said I, trying to keep him moored to current realities,
  "we have found out about the cave-man."</p>

  <p>"Found out about him!" he shouted. "We live in his presence. He has never
  died. He is anything but dead. Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He came close and tapped my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Only he was shut off from us and hidden. For a long time. And now
  we see him here face to face and his grin derides us. Man is still what he
  was. Invincibly bestial, envious, malicious, greedy. Man, sir, unmasked and
  disillusioned is the same fearing, snarling, fighting beast he was a hundred
  thousand years ago. These are no metaphors, sir. What I tell you is the
  monstrous reality. The brute has been marking time and dreaming of a progress
  it has failed to make. Any archaeologist will tell you as much; modern man
  has no better skull, no better brain. Just a cave-man, more or less trained.
  There has been no real change, no real escape. Civilization, progress, all
  THAT, we are discovering, was a delusion. Nothing was secured. Nothing. For a
  time man built himself in, into his neat little PRESENT world of Gods and
  Providences, rainbow promises and so forth. It was artificial, it was
  artistic, fictitious. We are only beginning to realize HOW artificial. Now it
  is breaking down, Mr Frobisher. It is breaking down all about us and we seem
  unable to prevent it. We SEEM... No escape appears. No, sir. Civilization so
  far has been a feeble, inadaptable falsity. And now it is found out; Fate has
  been too much for it. A stunning realization, sir! And when sensitive,
  unprepared men like our poor friend Finchatton become aware of it, they show
  themselves too weak to face it. They refuse to face a world so grim and great
  as this world really is. They take refuge in stories of hauntings and
  personal madness&mdash;in the hope of some sort of exorcism, something they
  think will be a cure... There is no such cure. There is no such way now of
  dressing up these facts and putting them aside.</p>

  <p>"So, sir, they have to be faced," he roared. "They have to be faced." He
  seemed to be addressing himself not simply to me but to some large public
  meeting. His vast gestures ignored me. "The time when men could be put in
  blinkers to save them from seeing too much is past. Past for ever! There can
  be no more religions of reassurance. No churches of 'There&mdash;there!' THAT
  sort of thing is at an end."</p>

  <p>"And then?" said I very quietly. Because the louder he shouted, the more
  coldly resistant I became.</p>

  <p>He sat down and gripped my arm again. He became persuasively confidential.
  From bawling, his voice sank to a deep heavy undertone. "Madness, sir, from
  the mental side, is poor Nature's answer to overwhelming fact. It is flight.
  And today all over the world, INTELLECTUAL MEN ARE GOING MAD! They are
  dithering, because they realize that the fight against this cave-man who is
  over us, who is in us, who is indeed US, is going against these imaginary
  selves. The world is no longer safe for anything. It was sheer delusion that
  we had Him under. Him! The pursuing brute who never desists."</p>

  <p>By a movement that I hoped seemed inadvertent, I freed my arm from his
  clutch. I had an absurd feeling that I was like that wedding guest who was
  gripped by the Ancient Mariner. "But then," I said, putting my hands in my
  pockets and leaning back so as to be out of reach of any fresh attempt to
  grab me; "What do you think you are doing with Finchatton? What do you think
  has to be done?"</p>

  <p>Dr Norbert waved his arms about and then stood up. "I tell you, sir," he
  said, shouting down at me as though I was a score of yards off, "in the end
  he has to do what we all have to do. Face the facts! Face the facts, sir! Go
  through with it. Survive if you can and perish if you can't. Do as I have
  done and shape your mind to a new scale. Only giants can save the world from
  complete relapse and so we&mdash;we who care for civilization&mdash;have to
  become giants. We have to bind a harder, stronger civilization like steel
  about the world. We have to make such a mental effort as the stars have never
  witnessed yet. Arise, O mind of Man!" (He called me that!) "Or be for ever
  defeated."</p>

  <p>I wanted to say I preferred to be defeated without making any fuss about
  it, but he gave me no chance to say that.</p>

  <p>For now indeed he was fairly raving. There was even a touch of froth on
  his lips. He paced up and down and talked on and on, in a fine frenzy.</p>

  <p>I suppose from first to last throughout the ages decent people of my sort
  have had to listen to this kind of thing, but it seemed to me beyond all
  reason that I should have to listen to it on the terrace of the Source Hotel
  at Perona above Les Noupets on a lovely morning in this year of grace
  nineteen hundred and thirty-six. He was striding up and down now like a
  Hebrew prophet. It may look all right as a part of history, this sort of
  rhetoric, this epoch-making and all that, but in real life it is hoarse and
  outrageous. It's damned bad manners&mdash;to be plain about it. I ceased to
  mark or remember half the things he said.</p>

  <p>There was no answering it. One could as soon swim up the falls of
  Niagara.</p>

  <p>He made it more and more plain that he was exhorting me. Me personally. I
  never had such a ballyragging. He was warning me to brace my mind to escape
  from the Wrath to Come. He called it that&mdash;'Wrath to Come'. He made me
  think of Peter the Hermit raging through the quiet cities of eleventh-century
  Christendom and starting all that trouble about the Crusades. He made me
  think of Savonarola and John Knox and all the disturbing people who have
  rushed shouting across history&mdash;leaving it very much as they found it,
  telling people to give up their lives, go to their tents, O Israel, take up
  arms, storm the Tuileries, smash the Winter Palace, and a score of such
  outrageous things. At little old Les Noupets, mind you.</p>

  <p>He reeled off a list of atrocities, murders and horrors all over the
  world. I suppose there IS a rather unusual amount of massacre and torture
  going on nowadays. I suppose the outlook IS pretty black. I suppose there may
  be frightful wars, air raids and pogroms ahead of us. But what am <i>I</i> to
  do about it? What was the good of bow-wow-wowing at me? The intensity of his
  manner could not hide the fact that he had no certitude even in his own mind,
  that at best he was struggling with only the blank shadows of ideas. Whenever
  I tried to get in an enquiring word, he would raise his voice and boom over
  me. "I tell you!" he would roar up.</p>

  <p>But that was just what he didn't do&mdash;and apparently couldn't do.</p>

  <p>"In a little while," he said, "there will be no ease, no security, no
  comfort any more." (Thank Heaven! he did not say I was 'living on the brink
  of a volcano'.) "There will be no choice before a human being but to be
  either a driven animal or a stern devotee to that true civilization, that
  disciplined civilization, that has never yet been achieved. Victim or
  Vigilante. And that, my friend, means you! I say it to YOU! YOU!" And he
  pointed a lean forefinger.</p>

  <p>As there was no one else present&mdash;for the waiter had gone inside
  &mdash;there was no reason whatever for that 'you' and that pointing finger.
  Just want of proportion...</p>

  <p>Yet&mdash;. It is a most unpleasant thing to admit but these two men HAVE
  in a sort of way hypnotized me after all, and put something of this anxiety
  and something of this haunting of theirs upon me. I try and get them in a
  proper perspective by writing down this story, but the mere writing of it
  makes me realize how much I can't detach myself. I can no more get rid of it
  by telling it to you than Finchatton could get rid of it by telling it to me.
  I did not know that one could be hypnotized in this fashion, by people just
  sitting about or talking to you. I thought you had to sit still and give
  yourself up to hypnotism or else there was nothing doing. But now I find I
  don't sleep as well as I used to do, I catch myself anxious about world
  affairs, I read evil things between the lines in the newspapers, and usually
  very faintly but sometimes quite plainly I see, behind the transparent front
  of things, that cave-man face... How was it Finchatton put
  it?&mdash;"continually rising and yet always towering up there". And I have
  to admit I am not so even-tempered as I was in conversation. The other day I
  even contradicted my aunt with some asperity, to our mutual astonishment. And
  I snapped at a waiter...</p>

  <p>I did not realize the seriousness of this business until I had this scene
  with Norbert. That was what made me so restive and after I broke away from
  him I took care to see no more of him or Finchatton. Yet all the same the
  mischief had been started in me and it grows. In those two brief mornings, I
  got myself infected, fool that I was to listen to them! and now the infection
  is working in me.</p>

  <p>I resent the whole business. What is the good of putting this horror of
  Cainsmarsh upon a man and not telling him exactly what to do about it? I DO
  realize that our present world is going to pieces. I quite see that we are
  still under the sway of the cave-man and that he is staging a tremendous
  come-back. I am surprised I didn't see all that before. Already I have dreams
  about that giant skull, quite unpleasant dreams. But what is the good of
  talking about them? If I told my aunt any of this, she would say I was off my
  head. What can a fellow like me do about it all?</p>

  <p>Study it up&mdash;enlarge my mind to a new scale? Become "giant-minded"?
  WHAT a phrase! Build up a new civilization of steel and power in the place of
  the one that is collapsing? ... Me? ... Look at my bringing up? Is it IN
  me?</p>

  <p>It is too much to expect of our sort of people.</p>

  <p>I'm ready to fall in with anything that seems promising. I'm all for
  peace, order, social justice, service and all that. But if I'm to THINK! If
  I'm to find out what to do with myself!</p>

  <p>That's too much.</p>

  <p>I made my break-away from Norbert's flooding eloquence that morning with
  some considerable difficulty. I stood up. "I must be going," I said. "I have
  to play croquet with my aunt at half-past twelve."</p>

  <p>"But what does croquet matter," he cried in that intolerable voice of his,
  "if your world is falling in ruins about you?"</p>

  <p>He made a move almost as though he would impede my retreat. He just wanted
  to go on being apocalyptic. But I had had enough of this apocalyptic
  stuff.</p>

  <p>I looked him in the face, firmly but politely. I said, "I don't care. The
  world MAY be going to pieces. The Stone Age may be returning. This may, as
  you say, be the sunset of civilization. I'm sorry, but I can't help it this
  morning. I have other engagements. All the same&mdash;laws of the Medes and
  Persians&mdash;I am going to play croquet with my aunt at half-past twelve
  today."</p>
