<h1>THE NOSE</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Nikolai Gogol</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>I</h2>

<p>ON 25 March an unusually strange event occurred in St. Petersburg.
For that morning Barber Ivan Yakovlevitch, a dweller on the
Vozkresensky Prospekt (his name is lost now--it no longer figures on a
signboard bearing a portrait of a gentleman with a soaped cheek, and
the words: "Also, Blood Let Here")--for that morning Barber Ivan
Yakovlevitch awoke early, and caught the smell of newly baked bread.
Raising himself a little, he perceived his wife (a most respectable
dame, and one especially fond of coffee) to be just in the act of
drawing newly baked rolls from the oven.</p>

<p>"Prascovia Osipovna," he said, "I would rather not have any coffee
for breakfast, but, instead, a hot roll and an onion,"--the truth being
that he wanted both but knew it to be useless to ask for two things at
once, as Prascovia Osipovna did not fancy such tricks.</p>

<p>"Oh, the fool shall have his bread," the dame reflected. "So much
the better for me then, as I shall be able to drink a second lot of
coffee."</p>

<p>And duly she threw on to the table a roll.</p>

<p>Ivan Yakovlevitch donned a jacket over his shirt for politeness'
sake, and, seating himself at the table, poured out salt, got a couple
of onions ready, took a knife into his hand, assumed an air of
importance, and cut the roll asunder. Then he glanced into the roll's
middle. To his intense surprise he saw something glimmering there. He
probed it cautiously with the knife--then poked at it with a
finger.</p>

<p>"Quite solid it is!" he muttered. "What in the world is it likely to
be?"</p>

<p>He thrust in, this time, all his fingers, and pulled forth--a nose!
His hands dropped to his sides for a moment. Then he rubbed his eyes
hard. Then again he probed the thing. A nose! Sheerly a nose! Yes, and
one familiar to him, somehow! Oh, horror spread upon his feature! Yet
that horror was a trifle compared with his spouse's overmastering
wrath.</p>

<p>"You brute!" she shouted frantically. "Where have you cut off that
nose? You villain, you! You drunkard! Why, I'll go and report you to
the police myself. The brigand, you! Three customers have told me
already about your pulling at their noses as you shaved them till they
could hardly stand it."</p>

<p>But Ivan Yakovlevitch was neither alive nor dead. This was the more
the case because, sure enough, he had recognised the nose. It was the
nose of Collegiate Assessor Kovalev--no less: it was the nose of a
gentleman whom he was accustomed to shave twice weekly, on each
Wednesday and each Sunday!</p>

<p>"Stop, Prascovia Osipovna!" at length he said. "I'll wrap the thing
in a clout, and lay it aside awhile, and take it away altogether
later."</p>

<p>"But I won't hear of such a thing being done! As if I'm going to
have a cut-off nose kicking about my room! Oh, you old stick! Maybe you
can just strop a razor still; but soon you'll be no good at all for the
rest of your work. You loafer, you wastrel, you bungler, you blockhead!
Aye, I'll tell the police of you. Take it away, then. Take it away.
Take it anywhere you like. Oh, that I'd never caught the smell of
it!"</p>

<p>Ivan Yakovlevitch was dumbfounded. He thought and thought, but did
not know what to think.</p>

<p>"The devil knows how it's happened," he said, scratching one ear.
"You see, I don't know for certain whether I came home drunk last night
or not. But certainly things look as though something out of the way
happened then, for bread comes of baking, and a nose of something else
altogether. Oh, I just can't make it out."</p>

<p>So he sat silent. At the thought that the police might find the nose
at his place, and arrest him, he felt frantic. Yes, already he could
see the red collar with the smart silver braiding--the sword! He
shuddered from head to foot.</p>

<p>But at last he got out, and donned waistcoat and shoes, wrapped the
nose in a clout, and departed amid Prascovia Osipovna's forcible
objurgations.</p>

<p>His one idea was to rid himself of the nose, and return quietly
home--to do so either by throwing the nose into the gutter in front of
the gates or by just letting it drop anywhere. Yet, unfortunately, he
kept meeting friends, and they kept saying to him: "Where are you off
to?" or "Whom have you arranged to shave at this early hour?" until
seizure of a fitting moment became impossible. Once, true, he did
succeed in dropping the thing, but no sooner had he done so than a
constable pointed at him with his truncheon, and shouted: "Pick it up
again! You've lost something," and he perforce had to take the nose
into his possession once more, and stuff it into a pocket. Meanwhile
his desperation grew in proportion as more and more booths and shops
opened for business, and more and more people appeared in the
street.</p>

<p>At last he decided that he would go to the Isaakievsky Bridge, and
throw the thing, if he could, into the Neva. But here let me confess my
fault in not having said more about Ivan Yakovlevitch himself, a man
estimable in more respects than one.</p>

<p>Like every decent Russian tradesman, Ivan Yakovlevitch was a
terrible tippler. Daily he shaved the chins of others, but always his
own was unshorn, and his jacket (he never wore a top-coat)
piebald--black, thickly studded with greyish, brownish-yellowish
stains--and shiny of collar, and adorned with three pendent tufts of
thread instead of buttons. But, with that, Ivan Yakovlevitch was a
great cynic. Whenever Collegiate Assessor Kovalev was being shaved, and
said to him, according to custom: "Ivan Yakovlevitch, your hands do
smell!" he would retort: "But why should they smell?" and, when the
Collegiate Assessor had replied: "Really I do not know, brother, but at
all events they do," take a pinch of snuff, and soap the Collegiate
Assessor upon cheek, and under nose, and behind ears, and around chin
at his good will and pleasure.</p>

<p>So the worthy citizen stood on the Isaakievsky Bridge, and looked
about him. Then, leaning over the parapet, he feigned to be trying to
see if any fish were passing underneath. Then gently he cast forth the
nose.</p>

<p>At once ten puds-weight seemed to have been lifted from his
shoulders. Actually he smiled! But, instead of departing, next, to
shave the chins of chinovniki, he bethought him of making for a certain
establishment inscribed "Meals and Tea," that he might get there a
glassful of punch.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sighted a constable standing at the end of the bridge, a
constable of smart appearance, with long whiskers, a three-cornered
hat, and a sword complete. Oh, Ivan Yakovlevitch could have fainted!
Then the constable, beckoning with a finger, cried:</p>

<p>"Nay, my good man. Come here."</p>

<p>Ivan Yaklovlevitch, knowing the proprieties, pulled off his cap at
quite a distance away, advanced quickly, and said:</p>

<p>"I wish your Excellency the best of health."</p>

<p>"No, no! None of that `your Excellency,' brother. Come and tell me
what you have been doing on the bridge."</p>

<p>"Before God, sir, I was crossing it on my way to some customers when
I peeped to see if there were any fish jumping."</p>

<p>"You lie, brother! You lie! You won't get out of it like that. Be so
good as to answer me truthfully."</p>

<p>"Oh, twice a week in future I'll shave you for nothing. Aye, or even
three times a week."</p>

<p>"No, no, friend. That is rubbish. Already I've got three barbers for
the purpose, and all of them account it an honour. Now, tell me, I ask
again, what you have just been doing?"</p>

<p>This made Ivan Yakovlevitch blanch, and----</p>

<p>Further events here become enshrouded in mist. What happened after
that is unknown to all men.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>COLLEGIATE ASSESSOR KOVALEV also awoke early that morning. And when
he had done so he made the "B-r-rh!" with his lips which he always did
when he had been asleep--he himself could not have said why. Then he
stretched himself, had handed to him a small mirror from the table near
by, and set himself to inspect a pimple which had broken out on his
nose the night before. But, to his unbounded astonishment, there was
only a flat patch on his face where the nose should have been! Greatly
alarmed, he called for water, washed, and rubbed his eyes hard with the
towel. Yes, the nose indeed was gone! He prodded the spot with a
hand-pinched himself to make sure that he was not still asleep. But no;
he was not still sleeping. Then he leapt from the bed, and shook
himself. No nose had he on him still! Finally, he bade his clothes be
handed him, and set forth for the office of the Police Commissioner at
his utmost speed.</p>

<p>Here let me add something which may enable the reader to perceive
just what the Collegiate Assessor was like. Of course, it goes without
saying that Collegiate Assessors who acquire the title with the help of
academic diplomas cannot be compared with Collegiate Assessors who
become Collegiate Assessors through service in the Caucasus, for the
two species are wholly distinct, they are----Stay, though. Russia is so
strange a country that, let one but say anything about any one
Collegiate Assessor, and the rest, from Riga to Kamchatka, at once
apply the remark to themselves--for all titles and all ranks it means
the same thing. Now, Kovalev was a "Caucasian" Collegiate Assessor, and
had, as yet, borne the title for two years only. Hence, unable ever to
forget it, he sought the more to give himself dignity and weight by
calling himself, in addition to "Collegiate Assessor," "Major."</p>

<p>"Look here, good woman," once he said to a shirts' vendor whom he
met in the street, "come and see me at my home. I have my flat in
Sadovaia Street. Ask merely, `Is this where Major Kovalev lives?'
Anyone will show you." Or, on meeting fashionable ladies, he would say:
"My dear madam, ask for Major Kovalev's flat." So we too will call the
Collegiate Assessor "Major."</p>

<p>Major Kovalev had a habit of daily promenading the Nevsky Prospekt
in an extremely clean and well-starched shirt and collar, and in
whiskers of the sort still observable on provincial surveyors,
architects, regimental doctors, other officials, and all men who have
round, red cheeks, and play a good hand at "Boston." Such whiskers run
across the exact centre of the cheek--then head straight for the nose.
Again, Major Kovalev always had on him a quantity of seals, both of
seals engraved with coats of arms, and of seals inscribed "Wednesday,"
"Thursday," "Monday," and the rest. And, finally, Major Kovalev had
come to live in St. Petersburg because of necessity. That is to say, he
had come to live in St. Petersburg because he wished to obtain a post
befitting his new title--whether a Vice-Governorship or, failing that,
an Administratorship in a leading department. Nor was Major Kovalev
altogether set against marriage. Merely he required that his bride
should possess not less than two hundred thousand rubles in capital.
The reader, therefore, can now judge how the Major was situated when he
perceived that instead of a not unpresentable nose there was figuring
on his face an extremely uncouth, and perfectly smooth and uniform
patch.</p>

<p>Ill luck prescribed, that morning, that not a cab was visible
throughout the street's whole length; so, huddling himself up in his
cloak, and covering his face with a handkerchief (to make things look
as though his nose were bleeding), he had to start upon his way on foot
only.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this is only imagination?" he reflected. Presently he
turned aside towards a restaurant (for he wished yet again to get a
sight of himself in a mirror). "The nose can't have removed itself of
sheer idiocy."</p>

<p>Luckily no customers were present in the restaurant--merely some
waiters were sweeping out the rooms, and rearranging the chairs, and
others, sleepy-eyed fellows, were setting forth trayfuls of hot
pastries. On chairs and tables last night's newspapers, coffee-stained,
were strewn.</p>

<p>"Thank God that no one is here!" the Major reflected. "Now I can
look at myself again."</p>

<p>He approached a mirror in some trepidation, and peeped therein. Then
he spat.</p>

<p>"The devil only knows what this vileness means!" he muttered. "If
even there had been something to take the nose's place! But, as it is,
there's nothing there at all."</p>

<p>He bit his lips with vexation, and hurried out of the restaurant.
No; as he went along he must look at no one, and smile at no one. Then
he halted as though riveted to earth. For in front of the doors of a
mansion he saw occur a phenomenon of which, simply, no explanation was
possible. Before that mansion there stopped a carriage. And then a door
of the carriage opened, and there leapt thence, huddling himself up, a
uniformed gentleman, and that uniformed gentleman ran headlong up the
mansion's entrance-steps, and disappeared within. And oh, Kovalev's
horror and astonishment to perceive that the gentleman was none other
than--his own nose! The unlooked-for spectacle made everything swim
before his eyes. Scarcely, for a moment, could he even stand. Then,
deciding that at all costs he must await the gentleman's return to the
carriage, he remained where he was, shaking as though with fever. Sure
enough, the Nose did return, two minutes later. It was clad in a
gold-braided, high-collared uniform, buckskin breeches, and cockaded
hat. And slung beside it there was a sword, and from the cockade on the
hat it could be inferred that the Nose was purporting to pass for a
State Councillor. It seemed now to be going to pay another visit
somewhere. At all events it glanced about it, and then, shouting to the
coachman, "Drive up here," re-entered the vehicle, and set forth.</p>

<p>Poor Kovalev felt almost demented. The astounding event left him
utterly at a loss. For how could the nose which had been on his face
but yesterday, and able then neither to drive nor to walk
independently, now be going about in uniform?--He started in pursuit of
the carriage, which, luckily, did not go far, and soon halted before
the Gostiny Dvor.[*]</p>

<p>[* Formerly the "Whiteley's" of St. Petersburg.]</p>

<p>Kovalev too hastened to the building, pushed through the line of old
beggar-women with bandaged faces and apertures for eyes whom he had so
often scorned, and entered. Only a few customers were present, but
Kovalev felt so upset that for a while he could decide upon no course
of action save to scan every corner in the gentleman's pursuit. At last
he sighted him again, standing before a counter, and, with face hidden
altogether behind the uniform's stand-up collar, inspecting with
absorbed attention some wares.</p>

<p>"How, even so, am I to approach it?" Kovalev reflected. "Everything
about it, uniform, hat, and all, seems to show that it is a State
Councillor now. Only the devil knows what is to be done!"</p>

<p>He started to cough in the Nose's vicinity, but the Nose did not
change its position for a single moment.</p>

<p>"My good sir," at length Kovalev said, compelling himself to
boldness, "my good sir, I----"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" And the Nose did then turn round.</p>

<p>"My good sir, I am in a difficulty. Yet somehow, I think, I think,
that--well, I think that you ought to know your proper place better.
All at once, you see, I find you--_where_? Do you not feel as I do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I cannot apprehend your meaning. Pray explain
further."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how, I should like to know?" Kovalev thought to himself.
Then, again taking courage, he went: on:</p>

<p>"I am, you see--well, in point of fact, you see, I am a Major. Hence
you will realise how unbecoming it is for me to have to walk about
without a nose. Of course, a peddler of oranges on the Vozkresensky
Bridge could sit there noseless well enough, but I myself am hoping
soon to receive a----Hm, yes. Also, I have amongst my acquaintances
several ladies of good houses (Madame Chektareva, wife of the State
Councillor, for example), and you may judge for yourself what that
alone signifies. Good sir"--Major Kovalev gave his shoulders a
shrug--"I do not know whether you yourself (pardon me) consider conduct
of this sort to be altogether in accordance with the rules of duty and
honour, but at least you can understand that----"</p>

<p>"I understand nothing at all," the Nose broke in. "Explain yourself
more satisfactorily."</p>

<p>"Good sir," Kovalev went on with a heightened sense of dignity, "the
one who is at a loss to understand the other is I. But at least the
immediate point should be plain, unless you are determined to have it
otherwise. Merely--you are my own nose."</p>

<p>The Nose regarded the Major, and contracted its brows a little.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you speak in error," was its reply. "I am just
myself--myself separately. And in any case there cannot ever have
existed a close relation between us, for, judging from the buttons of
your undress uniform, your service is being performed in another
department than my own."</p>

<p>And the Nose definitely turned away.</p>

<p>Kovalev stood dumbfounded. What to do, even what to think, he had
not a notion.</p>

<p>Presently the agreeable swish of ladies' dresses began to be heard.
Yes, an elderly, lace-bedecked dame was approaching, and, with her, a
slender maiden in a white frock which outlined delightfully a trim
figure, and, above it, a straw hat of a lightness as of pastry. Behind
them there came, stopping every now and then to open a snuffbox, a
tall, whiskered beau in quite a twelve-fold collar.</p>

<p>Kovalev moved a little nearer, pulled up the collar of his shirt,
straightened the seals on his gold watch-chain, smiled, and directed
special attention towards the slender lady as, swaying like a floweret
in spring, she kept raising to her brows a little white hand with
fingers almost of transparency. And Kovalev's smiles became broader
still when peeping from under the hat he saw there to be an alabaster,
rounded little chin, and part of a cheek flushed like an early rose.
But all at once he recoiled as though scorched, for all at once he had
remembered that he had not a nose on him, but nothing at all. So, with
tears forcing themselves upwards, he wheeled about to tell the
uniformed gentleman that he, the uniformed gentleman, was no State
Councillor, but an impostor and a knave and a villain and the Major's
own nose. But the Nose, behold, was gone! That very moment had it
driven away to, presumably, pay another visit.</p>

<p>This drove Kovalev to the last pitch of desperation. He went back to
the mansion, and stationed himself under its portico, in the hope that,
by peering hither and thither, hither and thither, he might once more
see the Nose appear. But, well though he remembered the Nose's cockaded
hat and gold-braided uniform, he had failed at the time to note also
its cloak, the colour of its horses, the make of its carriage, the look
of the lackey seated behind, and the pattern of the lackey's livery.
Besides, so many carriages were moving swiftly up and down the street
that it would have been impossible to note them all, and equally so to
have stopped any one of them. Meanwhile, as the day was fine and sunny,
the Prospekt was thronged with pedestrians also--a whole kaleidoscopic
stream of ladies was flowing along the pavements, from Police
Headquarters to the Anitchkin Bridge. There one could descry an Aulic
Councillor whom Kovalev knew well. A gentleman he was whom Kovalev
always addressed as "Lieutenant-Colonel," and especially in the
presence of others. And there there went Yaryzhkin, Chief Clerk to the
Senate, a crony who always rendered forfeit at "Boston" on playing an
eight. And, lastly, a like "Major" with Kovalev, a like "Major" with an
Assessorship acquired through Caucasian service, started to beckon to
Kovalev with a finger!</p>

<p>"The devil take him!" was Kovalev's muttered comment. "Hi, cabman!
Drive to the Police Commissioner's direct."</p>

<p>But just when he was entering the drozhki he added:</p>

<p>"No. Go by Ivanovskaia Street."</p>

<p>"Is the Commissioner in?" he asked on crossing the threshold.</p>

<p>"He is not," was the doorkeeper's reply. "He's gone this very
moment."</p>

<p>"There's luck for you!"</p>

<p>"Aye," the doorkeeper went on. "Only just a moment ago he was off.
If you'd been a bare half-minute sooner you'd have found him at home,
maybe."</p>

<p>Still holding the handkerchief to his face, Kovalev returned to the
cab, and cried wildly:</p>

<p>"Drive on!"</p>

<p>"Where to, though?" the cabman inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, straight ahead!"</p>

<p>"'Straight ahead'? But the street divides here. To right, or to
left?"</p>

<p>The question caused Kovalov to pause and recollect himself. In his
situation he ought to make his next step an application to the Board of
Discipline--not because the Board was directly connected with the
police, but because its dispositions would be executed more speedily
than in other departments. To seek satisfaction of the the actual
department in which the Nose had declared itself to be serving would be
sheerly unwise, since from the Nose's very replies it was clear that it
was the sort of individual who held nothing sacred, and, in that event,
might lie as unconscionably as it had lied in asserting itself never to
have figured in its proprietor's company. Kovalev, therefore, decided
to seek the Board of Discipline. But just as he was on the point of
being driven thither there occurred to him the thought that the
impostor and knave who had behaved so shamelessly during the late
encounter might even now be using the time to get out of the city, and
that in that case all further pursuit of the rogue would become vain,
or at all events last for, God preserve us! a full month. So at last,
left only to the guidance of Providence, the Major resolved to make for
a newspaper office, and publish a circumstantial description of the
Nose in such good time that anyone meeting with the truant might at
once be able either to restore it to him or to give information as to
its whereabouts. So he not only directed the cabman to the newspaper
office, but, all the way thither, prodded him in the back, and shouted:
"Hurry up, you rascal! Hurry up, you rogue!" whilst the cabman
intermittently responded: "Aye, barin," and nodded, and plucked at the
reins of a steed as shaggy as a spaniel.</p>

<p>The moment that the drozhki halted Kovalev dashed, breathless, into
a small reception-office. There, seated at a table, a grey-headed clerk
in ancient jacket and pair of spectacles was, with pen tucked between
lips, counting sums received in copper.</p>

<p>"Who here takes the advertisements?" Kovalev exclaimed as he
entered. "A-ah! Good day to you."</p>

<p>"And my respects," the grey-headed clerk replied, raising his eyes
for an instant, and then lowering them again to the spread out copper
heaps.</p>

<p>"I want you to publish----"</p>

<p>"Pardon--one moment." And the clerk with one hand committed to paper
a figure, and with a finger of the other hand shifted two accounts
markers. Standing beside him with an advertisement in his hands, a
footman in a laced coat, and sufficiently smart to seem to be in
service in an aristocratic mansion, now thought well to display some
knowingness.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said to the clerk, "I do assure you that the puppy is not
worth eight grivni even. At all events _I_ wouldn't give that much for
it. Yet the countess loves it--yes, just loves it, by God! Anyone
wanting it of her will have to pay a hundred rubles. Well, to tell the
truth between you and me, people's tastes differ. Of course, if one's a
sportsman one keeps a setter or a spaniel. And in that case don't you
spare five hundred rubles, or even give a thousand, if the dog is a
good one."</p>

<p>The worthy clerk listened with gravity, yet none the less
accomplished a calculation of the number of letters in the
advertisement brought. On either side there was a group of charwomen,
shop assistants, doorkeepers, and the like. All had similar
advertisements in their hands, with one of the documents to notify that
a coachman of good character was about to be disengaged, and another
one to advertise a koliaska imported from Paris in 1814, and only
slightly used since, and another one a maid-servant of nineteen
experienced in laundry work, but prepared also for other jobs, and
another one a sound drozhki save that a spring was lacking, and another
one a grey-dappled, spirited horse of the age of seventeen, and another
one some turnip and radish seed just received from London, and another
one a country house with every amenity, stabling for two horses, and
sufficient space for the laying out of a fine birch or spruce
plantation, and another one some second-hand footwear, with, added, an
invitation to attend the daily auction sale from eight o'clock to
three. The room where the company thus stood gathered together was
small, and its atmosphere confined; but this closeness, of course,
Collegiate Assessor Kovalev never perceived, for, in addition to his
face being muffled in a handkerchief, his nose was gone, and God only
knew its present habitat!</p>

<p>"My dear sir," at last he said impatiently, "allow me to ask you
something: it is a pressing matter."</p>

<p>"One moment, one moment! Two rubles, forty-three kopeks. Yes,
presently. Sixty rubles, four kopeks."</p>

<p>With which the clerk threw the two advertisements concerned towards
the group of charwomen and the rest, and turned to Kovalev.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Your pardon," replied Kovalev, "but fraud and knavery has been
done. I still cannot understand the affair, but wish to announce that
anyone returning me the rascal shall receive an adequate reward."</p>

<p>"Your name, if you would be so good?"</p>

<p>"No, no. What can my name matter? I cannot tell it you. I know many
acquaintances such as Madame Chektareva (wife of the State Councillor)
and Pelagea Grigorievna Podtochina (wife of the Staff-Officer), and,
the Lord preserve us, they would learn of the affair at once. So say
just `a Collegiate Assessor,' or, better, `a gentleman ranking as
Major.'"</p>

<p>"Has a household serf of yours absconded, then?"</p>

<p>"A household serf of mine? As though even a household serf would
perpetrate such a crime as the present one! No, indeed! It is my nose
that has absconded from me."</p>

<p>"Gospodin Nossov, Gospoding Nossov? Indeed a strange name, that![*]
Then has this Gospodin Nossov robbed you of some money?"</p>

<p>[* Nose is _noss_ in Russian, and Gospodin equivalent to the English
"Mr."]</p>

<p>"I said nose, not Nossov. You are making a mistake. There has
disappeared, goodness knows whither, my nose, my own actual nose.
Presumably it is trying to make a fool of me."</p>

<p>"But how could it so disappear? The matter has something about it
which I do not fully understand."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you the exact how. The point is that now the nose is
driving about the city, and giving itself out for a State Councillor
--wherefore I beg you to announce that anyone apprehending any such
nose ought at once, in the shortest possible space of time, to return
it to myself. Surely you can judge what it is for me meanwhile to be
lacking such a conspicuous portion of my frame? For a nose is not like
a toe which one can keep inside a boot, and hide the absence of if it
is not there. Besides, every Thurdsay I am due to call upon Madame
Chektareva (wife of the State Councillor): whilst Pelagea Grigorievna
Podtochina (wife of the Staff-Officer, mother of a pretty daughter)
also is one of my closest acquaintances. So, again, judge for yourself
how I am situated at present. In such a condition as this I could not
possibly present myself before the ladies named."</p>

<p>Upon that the clerk became thoughtful: the fact was clear from his
tightly compressed lips alone.</p>

<p>"No," he said at length. "Insert such an announcement I cannot."</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, you see, it might injure the paper's reputation. Imagine
if everyone were to start proclaiming a disappearance of his nose!
People would begin to say that, that--well, that we printed absurdities
and false tales."</p>

<p>"But how is this matter a false tale? Nothing of the sort has it got
about _it_."</p>

<p>"You think not; but only last week a similar case occurred. One day
a chinovnik brought us an advertisement as you have done. The cost
would have been only two rubles, seventy-three kopeks, for all that it
seemed to signify was the running away of a poodle. Yet what was it, do
you think, in reality? Why, the thing turned out to be a libel, and the
`poodle' in question a cashier--of what department precisely I do not
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, but here am I advertising not about a poodle, but about my own
nose, which, surely, is, for all intents and purposes, myself?"</p>

<p>"All the same, I cannot insert the advertisement."</p>

<p>"Even when actually I have lost my own nose!"</p>

<p>"The fact that your nose is gone is a matter for a doctor. There are
doctors, I have heard, who can fit one out with any sort of nose one
likes. I take it that by nature you are a wag, and like playing jokes
in public."</p>

<p>"That is not so. I swear it as God is holy. In fact, as things have
gone so far, I will let you see for yourself."</p>

<p>"Why trouble?" Here the clerk took some snuff before adding with,
nevertheless, a certain movement of curiosity: "However, if it really
won't trouble you at all, a sight of the spot would gratify me."</p>

<p>The Collegiate Assessor removed the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Strange indeed! Very strange indeed!" the clerk exclaimed. "And the
patch is as uniform as a newly fried pancake, almost unbelievably
uniform."</p>

<p>"So you will dispute what I say no longer? Then surely you cannot
but put the announcement into print. I shall be extremely grateful to
you, and glad that the present occasion has given me such a pleasure as
the making of your acquaintance"--whence it will be seen that for once
the Major had decided to climb down.</p>

<p>"To print what you want is nothing much," the clerk replied. "Yet
frankly I cannot see how you are going to benefit from the step. I
would suggest, rather, that you commission a skilled writer to compose
an article describing this as a rare product of nature, and have the
article published in _The Northern Bee_" (here the clerk took more
snuff), "either for the instruction of our young" (the clerk wiped his
nose for a finish) "or as a matter of general interest."</p>

<p>This again depressed the Collegiate Assessor: and even though, on
his eyes happening to fall upon a copy of the newspaper, and reach the
column assigned to theatrical news, and encounter the name of a
beautiful actress, so that he almost broke into a smile, and a hand
began to finger a pocket for a Treasury note (since he held that only
stalls were seats befitting Majors and so forth)--although all this was
so, there again recurred to him the thought of the nose, and everything
again became spoilt.</p>

<p>Even the clerk seemed touched with the awkwardness of Kovalev's
plight, and wishful to lighten with a few sympathetic words the
Collegiate Assessor's depression.</p>

<p>"I am sorry indeed that this has befallen," he said. "Should you
care for a pinch of this? Snuff can dissipate both headache and low
spirits. Nay, it is good for haemorrhoids as well."</p>

<p>And he proffered his box-deftly, as he did so, folding back
underneath it the lid depicting a lady in a hat.</p>

<p>Kovalev lost his last shred of patience at the thoughtless act, and
said heatedly:</p>

<p>"How you can think fit thus to jest I cannot imagine. For surely you
perceive me no longer to be in possession of a means of sniffing? Oh,
you and your snuff can go to hell! Even the sight of it is more than I
can bear. I should say the same even if you were offering me, not
wretched birch bark, but real rappee."</p>

<p>Greatly incensed, he rushed out of the office, and made for the ward
police inspector's residence. Unfortunately he arrived at the very
moment when the inspector, after a yawn and a stretch, was reflecting:
"Now for two hours' sleep!" In short, the Collegiate Assessor's visit
chanced to be exceedingly ill-timed. Incidentally, the inspector,
though a great patron of manufacturers and the arts, preferred still
more a Treasury note.</p>

<p>"That's the thing!" he frequently would say. "It's a thing which
can't be beaten anywhere, for it wants nothing at all to eat, and it
takes up very little room, and it fits easily to the pocket, and it
doesn't break in pieces if it happens to be dropped."</p>

<p>So the inspector received Kovalev very drily, and intimated that
just after dinner was not the best moment for beginning an
inquiry--nature had ordained that one should rest after food (which
showed the Collegiate Assessor that at least the inspector had some
knowledge of sages' old saws), and that in any case no one would
purloin the nose of a _really_ respectable man.</p>

<p>Yes, the inspector gave it Kovalev between the eyes. And as it
should be added that Kovalev was extremely sensitive where his title or
his dignity was concerned (though he readily pardoned anything said
against himself personally, and even held, with regard to stage plays,
that, whilst Staff-Officers should not be assailed, officers of lesser
rank might be referred to), the police inspector's reception so took
him aback that, in a dignified way, and with hands set apart a little,
he nodded, remarked: "After your insulting observations there is
nothing which I wish to add," and betook himself away again.</p>

<p>He reached home scarcely hearing his own footsteps. Dusk had fallen,
and, after the unsuccessful questings, his flat looked truly dreary. As
he entered the hall he perceived Ivan, his valet, to be lying on his
back on the stained old leathern divan, and spitting at the ceiling
with not a little skill as regards successively hitting the same spot.
The man's coolness rearoused Kovalev's ire, and, smacking him over the
head with his hat, he shouted:</p>

<p>"You utter pig! You do nothing but play the fool." Leaping up, Ivan
hastened to take his master's cloak.</p>

<p>The tired and despondent Major then sought his sitting-room, threw
himself into an easy-chair, sighed, and said to himself:</p>

<p>"My God, my God! why has this misfortune come upon me? Even loss of
hands or feet would have been better, for a man without a nose is the
devil knows what--a bird, but not a bird, a citizen, but not a citizen,
a thing just to be thrown out of window. It would have been better,
too, to have had my nose cut off in action, or in a duel, or through my
own act: whereas here is the nose gone with nothing to show for
it--uselessly--for not a groat's profit!--No, though," he added after
thought, "it's not likely that the nose is gone for good: it's not
likely at all. And quite probably I am dreaming all this, or am
fuddled. It may be that when I came home yesterday I drank the vodka
with which I rub my chin after shaving instead of water--snatched up
the stuff because that fool Ivan was not there to receive me."</p>

<p>So he sought to ascertain whether he might not be drunk by pinching
himself till he fairly yelled. Then, certain, because of the pain, that
he was acting and living in waking life, he approached the mirror with
diffidence, and once more scanned himself with a sort of inward hope
that the nose might by this time be showing as restored. But the result
was merely that he recoiled and muttered:</p>

<p>"What an absurd spectacle still!"</p>

<p>Ah, it all passed his understanding! If only a button, or a silver
spoon, or a watch, or some such article were gone, rather than that
anything had disappeared like this--for no reason, and in his very
flat! Eventually, having once more reviewed the circumstances, he
reached the final conclusion that he should most nearly hit the truth
in supposing Madame Podtochina (wife of the Staff-Officer, of
course--the lady who wanted him to become her daughter's husband) to
have been the prime agent in the affair. True, he had always liked
dangling in the daughter's wake, but also he had always fought shy of
really coming down to business. Even when the Staff-Officer's lady had
said point blank that she desired him to become her son-in-law he had
put her off with his compliments, and replied that the daughter was
still too young, and himself due yet to perform five years service, and
aged only forty-two. Yes, the truth must be that out of revenge the
Staff-Officer's wife had resolved to ruin him, and hired a band of
witches for the purpose, seeing that the nose could not conceivably
have been cut off--no one had entered his private room lately, and,
after being shaved by Ivan Yakovlevitch on the Wednesday, he had the
nose intact, he knew and remembered well, throughout both the rest of
the Wednesday and the day following. Also, if the nose had been cut
off, pain would have resulted, and also a wound, and the place could
not have healed so quickly, and become of the uniformity of a
pancake.</p>

<p>Next, the Major made his plans. Either he would sue the
Staff-Officer's lady in legal form or he would pay her a surprise
visit, and catch her in a trap. Then the foregoing reflections were cut
short by a glimmer showing through the chink of the door--a sign that
Ivan had just lit a candle in the hall: and presently Ivan himself
appeared, carrying the candle in front of him, and throwing the room
into such clear radiance that Kovalev had hastily to snatch up the
handkerchief again, and once more cover the place where the nose had
been but yesterday, lest the stupid fellow should be led to stand
gaping at the monstrosity on his master's features.</p>

<p>Ivan had just returned to his cupboard when an unfamiliar voice in
the hall inquired:</p>

<p>"Is this where Collegiate Assessor Kovalev lives?"</p>

<p>"It is," Kovalev shouted, leaping to his feet, and flinging wide the
door. "Come in, will you?"</p>

<p>Upon which there entered a police-officer of smart exterior, with
whiskers neither light nor dark, and cheeks nicely plump. As a matter
of fact, he was the police-officer whom Ivan Yakovlevitch had met at
the end of the Isaakievsky Bridge.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but have you lost your
nose?"</p>

<p>"I have--just so."</p>

<p>"Then the nose is found."</p>

<p>"What?" For a moment or two joy deprived Major Kovalev of further
speech. All that he could do was to stand staring, open-eyed, at the
officer's plump lips and cheeks, and at the tremulant beams which the
candlelight kept throwing over them. "Then how did it come about?"</p>

<p>"Well, by the merest chance the nose was found beside a roadway.
Already it had entered a stage-coach, and was about to leave for Riga
with a passport made out in the name of a certain chinovnik. And,
curiously enough, I myself, at first, took it to be a gentleman.
Luckily, though, I had my eyeglasses on me. Soon, therefore, I
perceived the `gentleman' to be no more than a nose. Such is my
shortness of sight, you know, that even now, though I see you standing
there before me, and see that you have a face, I cannot distinguish on
that face the nose, the chin, or anything else. My mother-in-law (my
wife's mother) too cannot easily distinguish details."</p>

<p>Kovalev felt almost beside himself.</p>

<p>"Where is the nose now?" cried he. "Where, I ask? Let me go to it at
once."</p>

<p>"Do not trouble, sir. Knowing how greatly you stand in need of it, I
have it with me. It is a curious fact, too, that the chief agent in the
affair has been a rascal of a barber who lives on the Vozkresensky
Prospekt, and now is sitting at the police station. For long past I had
suspected him of drunkenness and theft, and only three days ago he took
away from a shop a button-card. Well, you will find your nose to be as
before."</p>

<p>And the officer delved into a pocket, and drew thence the nose,
wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the nose all right!" Kovalev shouted. "It's the nose
precisely! Will you join me in a cup of tea?"</p>

<p>"I should have accounted it indeed a pleasure if I had been able,
but, unfortunately, I have to go straight on to the penitentiary.
Provisions, sir, have risen greatly in price. And living with me I have
not only my family, but my mother-in-law (my wife's mother). Yet the
eldest of my children gives me much hope. He is a clever lad. The only
thing is that I have not the means for his proper education."</p>

<p>When the officer was gone the Collegiate Assessor sat plunged in
vagueness, plunged in inability to see or to feel, so greatly was he
upset with joy. Only after a while did he with care take the thus
recovered nose in cupped hands, and again examine it attentively.</p>

<p>"It, undoubtedly. It, precisely," he said at length. "Yes, and it
even has on it the pimple to the left which broke out on me
yesterday."</p>

<p>Sheerly he laughed in his delight.</p>

<p>But nothing lasts long in this world. Even joy grows less lively the
next moment. And a moment later, again, it weakens further. And at last
it remerges insensibly with the normal mood, even as the ripple from a
pebble's impact becomes remerged with the smooth surface of the water
at large. So Kovalev relapsed into thought again. For by now he had
realised that even yet the affair was not wholly ended, seeing that,
though retrieved, the nose needed to be re-stuck.</p>

<p>"What if it should fail so to stick!"</p>

<p>The bare question thus posed turned the Major pale.</p>

<p>Feeling, somehow, very nervous, he drew the mirror closer to him,
lest he should fit the nose awry. His hands were trembling as gently,
very carefully he lifted the nose in place. But, oh, horrors, it would
not _remain_ in place! He held it to his lips, warmed it with his
breath, and again lifted it to the patch between his cheeks--only to
find, as before, that it would not retain its position.</p>

<p>"Come, come, fool!" said he. "Stop where you are, I tell you."</p>

<p>But the nose, obstinately wooden, fell upon the table with a strange
sound as of a cork, whilst the Major's face became convulsed.</p>

<p>"Surely it is not too large now?" he reflected in terror. Yet as
often as he raised it towards its proper position the new attempt
proved as vain as the last.</p>

<p>Loudly he shouted for Ivan, and sent for a doctor who occupied a
flat (a better one than the Major's) on the first floor. The doctor was
a fine-looking man with splendid, coal-black whiskers. Possessed of a
healthy, comely wife, he ate some raw apples every morning, and kept
his mouth extraordinarily clean--rinsed it out, each morning, for
three-quarters of an hour, and polished its teeth with five different
sorts of brushes. At once he answered Kovalev's summons, and, after
asking how long ago the calamity had happened, tilted the Major's chin,
and rapped the vacant site with a thumb until at last the Major
wrenched his head away, and, in doing so, struck it sharply against the
wall behind. This, the doctor said, was nothing; and after advising him
to stand a little farther from the wall, and bidding him incline his
head to the right, he once more rapped the vacant patch before, after
bidding him incline his head to the left, dealing him, with a "Hm!"
such a thumb-dig as left the Major standing like a horse which is
having its teeth examined.</p>

<p>The doctor, that done, shook his head.</p>

<p>"The thing is not feasible," he pronounced. "You had better remain
as you are rather than go farther and fare worse. Of course, I _could_
stick it on again--I could do that for you in a moment; but at the same
time I would assure you that your plight will only become worse as the
result."</p>

<p>"Never mind," Kovalev replied. "Stick it on again, pray. How can I
continue without a nose? Besides, things could not possibly be worse
than they are now. At present they are the devil himself. Where can I
show this caricature of a face? My circle of acquaintances is a large
one: this very night I am due in two houses, for I know a great many
people like Madame Chektareva (wife of the State Councillor), Madame
Podtochina (wife of the Staff-Officer), and others. Of course, though,
I shall have nothing further to do with Madame Podtochina (except
through the police) after her present proceedings. Yes," persuasively
he went on, "I beg of you to do me the favour requested. Surely there
are means of doing it permanently? Stick it on in any sort of a
fashion--at all events so that it will hold fast, even if not
becomingly. And then, when risky moments occur, I might even support it
gently with my hand, and likewise dance no more--anything to avoid
fresh injury through an unguarded movement. For the rest, you may feel
assured that I shall show you my gratitude for this visit so far as
ever my means will permit."</p>

<p>"Believe me," the doctor replied, neither too loudly nor too softly,
but just with incisiveness and magnetic "when I say that I never attend
patients for money. To do that would be contrary alike to my rules and
to my art. When I accept a fee for a visit I accept it only lest I
offend through a refusal. Again I say--this time on my honour, as you
will not believe my plain word--that, though I could easily re-affix
your nose, the proceeding would make things worse, far worse, for you.
It would be better for you to trust merely to the action of nature.
Wash often in cold water, and I assure you that you will be as healthy
without a nose as with one. This nose here I should advise you to put
into a jar of spirit: or, better still, to steep in two tablespoonfuls
of stale vodka and strong vinegar. Then you will be able to get a good
sum for it. Indeed, I myself will take the thing if you consider it of
no value."</p>

<p>"No, no!" shouted the distracted Major. "Not on any account will I
sell it. I would rather it were lost again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon." And the doctor bowed. "My only idea had
been to serve you. What is it you want? Well, you have seen me do what
I could."</p>

<p>And majestically he withdrew. Kovalev, meanwhile, had never once
looked at his face. In his distraction he had noticed nothing beyond a
pair of snowy cuffs projecting from black sleeves.</p>

<p>He decided, next, that, before lodging a plea next day, he would
write and request the Staff-Officer's lady to restore him his nose
without publicity. His letter ran as follows:</p>

<p>DEAR MADAME ALEXANDRA GRIGORIEVNA, I am at a loss to understand your
strange conduct. At least, however, you may rest assured that you will
benefit nothing by it, and that it will in no way further force me to
marry your daughter. Believe me, I am now aware of all the
circumstances connected with my nose, and know that you alone have been
the prime agent in them. The nose's sudden disappearance, its
subsequent gaddings about, its masqueradings as, firstly, a chinovnik
and, secondly, itself--all these have come of witchcraft practised
either by you or by adepts in pursuits of a refinement equal to your
own. This being so, I consider it my duty herewith to warn you that if
the nose should not this very day reassume its correct position, I
shall be forced to have resort to the law's protection and defence.
With all respect, I have the honour to remain your very humble servant,
PLATON KOVALEV.</p>

<p>"MY DEAR SIR," wrote the lady in return, "your letter has greatly
surprised me, and I will say frankly that I had not expected it, and
least of all its unjust reproaches. I assure you that I have never at
any time allowed the chinovnik whom you mention to enter my
house--either masquerading or as himself. True, I have received calls
from Philip Ivanovitch Potanchikov, who, as you know, is seeking my
daughter's hand, and, besides, is a man steady and upright, as well as
learned; but never, even so, have I given him reason to hope. You
speak, too, of a nose. If that means that I seem to you to have desired
to leave you with a nose and nothing else, that is to say, to return
you a direct refusal of my daughter's hand, I am astonished at your
words, for, as you cannot but be aware, my inclination is quite
otherwise. So now, if still you wish for a formal betrothal to my
daughter, I will readily, I do assure you, satisfy your desire, which
all along has been, in the most lively manner, my own also. In hopes of
that, I remain yours sincerely, ALEXANDRA PODTOCHINA.</p>

<p>"No, no!" Kovalev exclaimed, after reading the missive. "She, at
least, is not guilty. Oh, certainly not! No one who had committed such
a crime could write such a letter." The Collegiate Assessor was the
more expert in such matters because more than once he had been sent to
the Caucasus to institute prosecutions. "Then by what sequence of
chances has the affair happened? Only the devil could say!"</p>

<p>His hands fell in bewilderment.</p>

<p>It had not been long before news of the strange occurrence had
spread through the capital. And, of course, it received additions with
the progress of time. Everyone's mind was, at that period, bent upon
the marvellous. Recently experiments with the action of magnetism had
occupied public attention, and the history of the dancing chairs of
Koniushennaia Street also was fresh. So no one could wonder when it
began to be said that the nose of Collegiate Assessor Kovalev could be
seen promenading the Nevski Prospekt at three o'clock, or when a crowd
of curious sightseers gathered there. Next, someone declared that the
nose, rather, could be beheld at Junker's store, and the throng which
surged thither became so massed as to necessitate a summons to the
police. Meanwhile a speculator of highly respectable aspect and
whiskers who sold stale cakes at the entrance to a theatre knocked
together some stout wooden benches, and invited the curious to stand
upon them for eighty kopeks each; whilst a retired colonel who came out
early to see the show, and penetrated the crowd only with great
difficulty, was disgusted when in the window of the store he beheld,
not a nose, but merely an ordinary woollen waistcoat flanked by the
selfsame lithograph of a girl pulling up a stocking, whilst a dandy
with cutaway waistcoat and receding chin peeped at her from behind a
tree, which had hung there for ten years past.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" irritably he exclaimed. "How come people so to excite
themselves about stupid, improbable reports?"</p>

<p>Next, word had it that the nose was walking, not on the Nevski
Prospekt, but in the Taurida Park, and, in fact, had been in the habit
of doing so for a long while past, so that even in the days when
Khozrev Mirza had lived near there he had been greatly astonished at
the freak of nature. This led students to repair thither from the
College of Medicine, and a certain eminent, respected lady to write and
ask the Warden of the Park to show her children the phenomenon, and, if
possible, add to the demonstration a lesson of edifying and instructive
tenor.</p>

<p>Naturally, these events greatly pleased also gentlemen who
frequented routs, since those gentlemen wished to entertain the ladies,
and their resources had become exhausted. Only a few solid, worthy
persons deprecated it all. One such person even said, in his disgust,
that comprehend how foolish inventions of the sort could circulate in
such an enlightened age he could not--that, in fact, he was surprised
that the Government had not turned its attention to the matter. From
which utterance it will be seen that the person in question was one of
those who would have dragged the Government into anything on earth,
including even their daily quarrels with their wives.</p>

<p>Next----</p>

<p>But again events here become enshrouded in mist. What happened after
that is unknown to all men.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>FARCE really does occur in this world, and, sometimes, farce
altogether without an element of probability. Thus, the nose which
lately had gone about as a State Councillor, and stirred all the city,
suddenly reoccupied its proper place (between the two cheeks of Major
Kovalev) as though nothing at all had happened. The date was 7 April,
and when, that morning, the major awoke as usual, and, as usual, threw
a despairing glance at the mirror, he this time, beheld before him,
what?--why, the nose again! Instantly he took hold of it. Yes, the
nose, the nose precisely! "Aha!" he shouted, and, in his joy, might
have executed a trepak about the room in bare feet had not Ivan's entry
suddenly checked him. Then he had himself furnished with materials for
washing, washed, and glanced at the mirror again. Oh, the nose was
there still! So next he rubbed it vigorously with the towel. Ah, still
it was there, the same as ever!</p>

<p>"Look, Ivan," he said. "Surely there is a pimple on my nose?" But
meanwhile he was thinking: "What if he should reply: `You are wrong,
sir. Not only is there not a pimple to be seen, but not even a
nose'?"</p>

<p>However, all that Ivan said was:</p>

<p>"Not a pimple, sir, that isn't. The nose is clear all over."</p>

<p>"Good!" the Major reflected, and snapped his fingers. At the same
moment Barber Ivan Yakovlevitch peeped round the door. He did so as
timidly as a cat which has just been whipped for stealing cream.</p>

<p>"Tell me first whether your hands are clean?" the Major cried.</p>

<p>"They are, sir."</p>

<p>"You lie, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"By God, sir, I do not!"</p>

<p>"Then go carefully."</p>

<p>As soon as Kovalev had seated himself in position Ivan Yakovlevitch
vested him in a sheet, and plied brush upon chin and a portion of a
cheek until they looked like the blanc mange served on tradesmen's
namedays.</p>

<p>"Ah, you!" Here Ivan Yakovlevitch glanced at the nose. Then he bent
his head askew, and contemplated the nose from a position on the flank.
"It looks right enough," finally he commented, but eyed the member for
quite a little while longer before carefully, so gently as almost to
pass the imagination, he lifted two fingers towards it, in order to
grasp its tip--such always being his procedure.</p>

<p>"Come, come! Do mind!" came in a shout from Kovalev. Ivan
Yakovlevitch let fall his hands, and stood disconcerted, dismayed as he
had never been before. But at last he started scratching the razor
lightly under the chin, and, despite the unhandiness and difficulty of
shaving in that quarter without also grasping the organ of smell,
contrived, with the aid of a thumb planted firmly upon the cheek and
the lower gum, to overcome all obstacles, and bring the shave to a
finish.</p>

<p>Everything thus ready, Kovalev dressed, called a cab, and set out
for the restaurant. He had not crossed the threshold before he shouted:
"Waiter! A cup of chocolate!" Then he sought a mirror, and looked at
himself. The nose was still in place! He turned round in cheerful mood,
and, with eves contracted slightly, bestowed a bold, satirical scrutiny
upon two military men, one of the noses on whom was no larger than a
waistcoat button. Next, he sought the chancery of the department where
he was agitating to obtain a Vice-Governorship (or, failing that, an
Administratorship), and, whilst passing through the reception
vestibule, again surveyed himself in a mirror. As much in place as ever
the nose was!</p>

<p>Next, he went to call upon a brother Collegiate Assessor, a brother
"Major." This colleague of his was a great satirist, but Kovalev always
met his quarrelsome remarks merely with: "Ah, you! I know you, and know
what a wag you are."</p>

<p>Whilst proceeding thither he reflected:</p>

<p>"At least, if the Major doesn't burst into laughter on seeing me, I
shall know for certain that all is in order again."</p>

<p>And this turned out to be so, for the colleague said nothing at all
on the subject.</p>

<p>"Splendid, damn it all!" was Kovalev's inward comment.</p>

<p>In the street, on leaving the colleague's, he met Madame Podtochina,
and also Madame Podtochina's daughter. Bowing to them, he was received
with nothing but joyous exclamations. Clearly all had been fancy, no
harm had been done. So not only did he talk quite a while to the
ladies, but he took special care, as he did so, to produce his
snuffbox, and deliberately plug his nose at both entrances. Meanwhile
inwardly he said:</p>

<p>"There now, good ladies! There now, you couple of hens! I'm not
going to marry the daughter, though. All this is just--_par amour_,
allow me."</p>

<p>And from that time onwards Major Kovalev gadded about the same as
before. He walked on the Nevski Prospekt, and he visited theatres, and
he showed himself everywhere. And always the nose accompanied him the
same as before, and evinced no signs of again purposing a departure.
Great was his good humour, replete was he with smiles, intent was he
upon pursuit of fair ladies. Once, it was noted, he even halted before
a counter of the Gostini Dvor, and there purchased the riband of an
order. Why precisely he did so is not known, for of no order was he a
knight.</p>

<p>To think of such an affair happening in this our vast empire's
northern capital! Yet general opinion decided that the affair had about
it much of the improbable. Leaving out of the question the nose's
strange, unnatural removal, and its subsequent appearance as a State
Councillor, how came Kovalev not to know that one ought not to
advertise for a nose through a newspaper? Not that I say this because I
consider newspaper charges for announcements excessive. No, that is
nothing, and I do not belong to the number of the mean. I say it
because such a proceeding would have been _gauche_, derogatory, not the
thing. And how came the nose into the baked roll? And what of Ivan
Yakovlevitch? Oh, I cannot understand these points--absolutely I
cannot. And the strangest, most unintelligible fact of all is that
authors actually can select such occurrences for their subject! I
confess this too to pass my comprehension, to----But no; I will say
just that I do not understand it. In the first place, a course of the
sort never benefits the country. And in the second place--in the second
place, a course of the sort never benefits anything at all. I cannot
divine the use of it.</p>

<p>Yet, even considering these things; even conceding this, that, and
the other (for where are not incongruities found at times?) there may
have, after all, been something in the affair. For no matter what folk
say to the contrary, such affairs do happen in this world--rarely of
course, yet none the less really.</p>
