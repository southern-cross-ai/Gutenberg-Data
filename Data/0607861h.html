</h2>

<p class="first">"STRIKE in the nails, soldiers, and let our guest
see the reality of our good Roman justice!"</p>

<p>The speaker wrapped his purple cloak closer about his powerful
frame and settled back into his official chair, much as he might
have settled back in his seat at the Circus Maximus to enjoy the
clash of gladiatorial swords. Realization of power colored his
every move. Whetted pride was necessary to Roman satisfaction, and
Titus Sulla was justly proud; for he was military governor of
Eboracum and answerable only to the emperor of Rome. He was a
strongly built man of medium height, with the hawk-like features of
the pure-bred Roman. Now a mocking smile curved his full lips,
increasing the arrogance of his haughty aspect. Distinctly military
in appearance, he wore the golden-scaled corselet and chased
breastplate of his rank, with the short stabbing sword at his belt,
and he held on his knee the silvered helmet with its plumed crest.
Behind him stood a clump of impassive soldiers with shield and
spear&mdash;blond titans from the Rhineland.</p>

<p>Before him was taking place the scene which apparently gave him
so much real gratification&mdash;a scene common enough wherever
stretched the far-flung boundaries of Rome. A rude cross lay flat
upon the barren earth and on it was bound a man&mdash;half-naked,
wild of aspect with his corded limbs, glaring eyes and shock of
tangled hair. His executioners were Roman soldiers, and with heavy
hammers they prepared to pin the victim's hands and feet to the
wood with iron spikes.</p>

<p>Only a small group of men watched this ghastly scene, in the
dread place of execution beyond the city walls: the governor and
his watchful guards; a few young Roman officers; the man to whom
Sulla had referred as "guest" and who stood like a bronze image,
unspeaking. Beside the gleaming splendor of the Roman, the quiet
garb of this man seemed drab, almost somber.</p>

<p>He was dark, but he did not resemble the Latins around him.
There was about him none of the warm, almost Oriental sensuality of
the Mediterranean which colored their features. The blond
barbarians behind Sulla's chair were less unlike the man in facial
outline than were the Romans. Not his were the full curving red
lips, nor the rich waving locks suggestive of the Greek. Nor was
his dark complexion the rich olive of the south; rather it was the
bleak darkness of the north. The whole aspect of the man vaguely
suggested the shadowed mists, the gloom, the cold and the icy winds
of the naked northern lands. Even his black eyes were savagely
cold, like black fires burning through fathoms of ice.</p>

<p>His height was only medium but there was something about him
which transcended mere physical bulk&mdash;a certain fierce innate
vitality, comparable only to that of a wolf or a panther. In every
line of his supple, compact body, as well as in his coarse straight
hair and thin lips, this was evident&mdash;in the hawk-like set of
the head on the corded neck, in the broad square shoulders, in the
deep chest, the lean loins, the narrow feet. Built with the savage
economy of a panther, he was an image of dynamic potentialities,
pent in with iron self-control.</p>

<p>At his feet crouched one like him in complexion&mdash;but there
the resemblance ended. This other was a stunted giant, with gnarly
limbs, thick body, a low sloping brow and an expression of dull
ferocity, now clearly mixed with fear. If the man on the cross
resembled, in a tribal way, the man Titus Sulla called guest, he
far more resembled the stunted crouching giant.</p>

<p>"Well, Partha Mac Othna," said the governor with studied
effrontery, "when you return to your tribe, you will have a tale to
tell of the justice of Rome, who rules the south."</p>

<p>"I will have a tale," answered the other in a voice which
betrayed no emotion, just as his dark face, schooled to immobility,
showed no evidence of the maelstrom in his soul.</p>

<p>"Justice to all under the rule of Rome," said Sulla. "<i>Pax
Romana!</i> Reward for virtue, punishment for wrong!" He laughed
inwardly at his own black hypocrisy, then continued: "You see,
emissary of Pictland, how swiftly Rome punishes the
transgressor."</p>

<p>"I see," answered the Pict in a voice which strongly-curbed
anger made deep with menace, "that the subject of a foreign king is
dealt with as though he were a Roman slave."</p>

<p>"He has been tried and condemned in an unbiased court," retorted
Sulla.</p>

<p>"Aye! And the accuser was a Roman, the witnesses Roman, the
judge Roman! He committed murder? In a moment of fury he struck
down a Roman merchant who cheated, tricked and robbed him, and to
injury added insult&mdash;aye, and a blow! Is his king but a dog,
that Rome crucifies his subjects at will, condemned by Roman
courts? Is his king too weak or foolish to do justice, were he
informed and formal charges brought against the offender?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sulla cynically, "you may inform Bran Mak Morn
yourself. Rome, my friend, makes no account of her actions to
barbarian kings. When savages come among us, let them act with
discretion or suffer the consequences."</p>

<p>The Pict shut his iron jaws with a snap that told Sulla further
badgering would elicit no reply. The Roman made a gesture to the
executioners. One of them seized a spike and placing it against the
thick wrist of the victim, smote heavily. The iron point sank deep
through the flesh, crunching against the bones. The lips of the man
on the cross writhed, though no moan escaped him. As a trapped wolf
fights against his cage, the bound victim instinctively wrenched
and struggled. The veins swelled in his temples, sweat beaded his
low forehead, the muscles in arms and legs writhed and knotted. The
hammers fell in inexorable strokes, driving the cruel points deeper
and deeper, through wrists and ankles; blood flowed in a black
river over the hands that held the spikes, staining the wood of the
cross, and the splintering of bones was distinctly heard. Yet the
sufferer made no outcry, though his blackened lips writhed back
until the gums were visible, and his shaggy head jerked
involuntarily from side to side.</p>

<p>The man called Partha Mac Othna stood like an iron image, eyes
burning from an inscrutable face, his whole body hard as iron from
the tension of his control. At his feet crouched his misshapen
servant, hiding his face from the grim sight, his arms locked about
his master's knees. Those arms gripped like steel and under his
breath the fellow mumbled ceaselessly as if in invocation.</p>

<p>The last stroke fell; the cords were cut from arm and leg, so
that the man would hang supported by the nails alone. He had ceased
his struggling that only twisted the spikes in his agonizing
wounds. His bright black eyes, unglazed, had not left the face of
the man called Partha Mac Othna; in them lingered a desperate
shadow of hope. Now the soldiers lifted the cross and set the end
of it in the hole prepared, stamped the dirt about it to hold it
erect.</p>

<p>The Pict hung in midair, suspended by the nails in his flesh,
but still no sound escaped his lips. His eyes still hung on the
somber face of the emissary, but the shadow of hope was fading.</p>

<p>"He'll live for days!" said Sulla cheerfully. "These Picts are
harder than cats to kill! I'll keep a guard of ten soldiers
watching night and day to see that no one takes him down before he
dies. Ho, there, Valerius, in honor of our esteemed neighbor, King
Bran Mak Morn, give him a cup of wine!"</p>

<p>With a laugh the young officer came forward, holding a brimming
wine cup, and rising on his toes, lifted it to the parched lips of
the sufferer. In the black eyes flared a red wave of unquenchable
hatred; writhing his head aside to avoid even touching the cup, he
spat full into the young Roman's eyes. With a curse Valerius dashed
the cup to the ground, and before any could halt him, wrenched out
his sword and sheathed it in the man's body.</p>

<p>Sulla rose with an imperious exclamation of anger; the man
called Partha Mac Othna had started violently, but he bit his lip
and said nothing. Valerius seemed somewhat surprized at him as he
sullenly cleansed his sword. The act had been instinctive,
following the insult to Roman pride, the one thing unbearable.</p>

<p>"Give up your sword, young sir!" exclaimed Sulla. "Centurion
Publius, place him under arrest. A few days in a cell with stale
bread and water will teach you to curb your patrician pride in
matters dealing with the will of the empire. What, you young fool,
do you not realize that you could not have made the dog a more
kindly gift? Who would not rather desire a quick death on the sword
than the slow agony on the cross? Take him away. And you,
centurion, see that guards remain at the cross so that the body is
not cut down until the ravens pick bare the bones. Partha Mac
Othna, I go to a banquet at the house of Demetrius&mdash;will you
not accompany me?"</p>

<p>The emissary shook his head, his eyes fixed on the limp form
which sagged on the black-stained cross. He made no reply. Sulla
smiled sardonically, then rose and strode away, followed by his
secretary who bore the gilded chair ceremoniously, and by the
stolid soldiers, with whom walked Valerius, head sunken.</p>

<p>The man called Partha Mac Othna flung a wide fold of his cloak
about his shoulder, halted a moment to gaze at the grim cross with
its burden, darkly etched against the crimson sky, where the clouds
of night were gathering. Then he stalked away, followed by his
silent servant.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="worms2" name=
"worms2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN an inner chamber of Eboracum, the man called
Partha Mac Othna paced tigerishly to and fro. His sandaled feet
made no sound on the marble tiles.</p>

<p>"Grom!" he turned to the gnarled servant. "Well I know why you
held my knees so tightly&mdash;why you muttered aid of the
Moon-Woman&mdash;you feared I would lose my self-control and make a
mad attempt to succor that poor wretch. By the gods, I believe that
was what the dog Roman wishedhis iron-cased watchdogs watched me
narrowly, I know, and his baiting was harder to bear than
ordinarily.</p>

<p>"Gods black and white, dark and light!" He shook his clenched
fists above his head in the black gust of his passion. "That I
should stand by and see a man of mine butchered on a Roman
cross&mdash;without justice and with no more trial than that farce!
Black gods of R'lyeh, even you would I invoke to the ruin and
destruction of those butchers! I swear by the Nameless Ones, men
shall die howling for that deed, and Rome shall cry out as a woman
in the dark who treads upon an adder!"</p>

<p>"He knew you, master," said Grom.</p>

<p>The other dropped his head and covered his eyes with a gesture
of savage pain.</p>

<p>"His eyes will haunt me when I lie dying. Aye, he knew me, and
almost until the last, I read in his eyes the hope that I might aid
him. Gods and devils, is Rome to butcher my people beneath my very
eyes? Then I am not king but dog!"</p>

<p>"Not so loud, in the name of all the gods!" exclaimed Grom in
affright. "Did these Romans suspect you were Bran Mak Morn, they
would nail you on a cross beside that other."</p>

<p>"They will know it ere long," grimly answered the king. "Too
long I have lingered here in the guise of an emissary, spying upon
mine enemies. They have thought to play with me, these Romans,
masking their contempt and scorn only under polished satire. Rome
is courteous to barbarian ambassadors, they give us fine houses to
live in, offer us slaves, pander to our lusts with women and gold
and wine and games, but all the while they laugh at us; their very
courtesy is an insult, and sometimes&mdash;as today&mdash;their
contempt discards all veneer. Bah! I've seen through their
baitings&mdash;have remained imperturbably serene and swallowed
their studied insults. But this&mdash;by the fiends of Hell, this
is beyond human endurance! My people look to me; if I fail
them&mdash;if I fail even one&mdash;even the lowest of my people,
who will aid them? To whom shall they turn? By the gods, I'll
answer the gibes of these Roman dogs with black shaft and trenchant
steel!"</p>

<p>"And the chief with the plumes?" Grom meant the governor and his
gutturals thrummed with the blood-lust. "He dies?" He flicked out a
length of steel.</p>

<p>Bran scowled. "Easier said than done. He dies&mdash;but how may
I reach him? By day his German guards keep at his back; by night
they stand at door and window. He has many enemies, Romans as well
as barbarians. Many a Briton would gladly slit his throat."</p>

<p>Grom seized Bran's garment, stammering as fierce eagerness broke
the bonds of his inarticulate nature.</p>

<p>"Let me go, master! My life is worth nothing. I will cut him
down in the midst of his warriors!"</p>

<p>Bran smiled fiercely and clapped his hand on the stunted giant's
shoulder with a force that would have felled a lesser man.</p>

<p>"Nay, old war-dog, I have too much need of thee! You shall not
throw your life away uselessly. Sulla would read the intent in your
eyes, besides, and the javelins of his Teutons would be through you
ere you could reach him. Not by the dagger in the dark will we
strike this Roman, not by the venom in the cup nor the shaft from
the ambush."</p>

<p>The king turned and paced the floor a moment, his head bent in
thought. Slowly his eyes grew murky with a thought so fearful he
did not speak it aloud to the waiting warrior.</p>

<p>"I have become somewhat familiar with the maze of Roman politics
during my stay in this accursed waste of mud and marble," said he.
"During a war on the Wall, Titus Sulla, as governor of this
province, is supposed to hasten thither with his centuries. But
this Sulla does not do; he is no coward, but the bravest avoid
certain things&mdash;to each man, however bold, his own particular
fear. So he sends in his place Caius Camillus, who in times of
peace patrols the fens of the west, lest the Britons break over the
border. And Sulla takes his place in the Tower of Trajan. Ha!"</p>

<p>He whirled and gripped Grom with steely fingers.</p>

<p>"Grom, take the red stallion and ride north! Let no grass grow
under the stallion's hoofs! Ride to Cormac na Connacht and tell him
to sweep the frontier with sword and torch! Let his wild Gaels
feast their fill of slaughter. After a time I will be with him. But
for a time I have affairs in the west."</p>

<p>Grom's black eyes gleamed and he made a passionate gesture with
his crooked hand&mdash;an instinctive move of savagery.</p>

<p>Bran drew a heavy bronze seal from beneath his tunic.</p>

<p>"This is my safe-conduct as an emissary to Roman courts," he
said grimly. "It will open all gates between this house and
Baal-dor. If any official questions you too
closely&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>Lifting the lid of an iron-bound chest, Bran took out a small,
heavy leather bag which he gave into the hands of the warrior.</p>

<p>"When all keys fail at a gate," said he, "try a golden key. Go
now!"</p>

<p>There were no ceremonious farewells between the barbarian king
and his barbarian vassal. Grom flung up his arm in a gesture of
salute; then turning, he hurried out.</p>

<p>Bran stepped to a barred window and gazed out into the moonlit
streets.</p>

<p>"Wait until the moon sets," he muttered grimly. "Then I'll take
the road to&mdash;Hell! But before I go I have a debt to pay."</p>

<p>The stealthy clink of a hoof on the flags reached him.</p>

<p>"With the safe-conduct and gold, not even Rome can hold a
Pictish reaver," muttered the king. "Now I'll sleep until the moon
sets."</p>

<p>With a snarl at the marble frieze-work and fluted columns, as
symbols of Rome, he flung himself down on a couch, from which he
had long since impatiently torn the cushions and silk stuffs, as
too soft for his hard body. Hate and the black passion of vengeance
seethed in him, yet he went instantly to sleep. The first lesson he
had learned in his bitter hard life was to snatch sleep any time he
could, like a wolf that snatches sleep on the hunting trail.
Generally his slumber was as light and dreamless as a panther's,
but tonight it was otherwise.</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>He sank into fleecy gray fathoms of slumber and in a timeless,
misty realm of shadows he met the tall, lean, white-bearded figure
of old Gonar, the priest of the Moon, high counselor to the king.
And Bran stood aghast, for Gonar's face was white as driven snow
and he shook as with ague. Well might Bran stand appalled, for in
all the years of his life he had never before seen Gonar the Wise
show any sign of fear.</p>

<p>"What now, old one?" asked the king. "Goes all well in
Baal-dor?"</p>

<p>"All is well in Baal-dor where my body lies sleeping," answered
old Gonar. "Across the void I have come to battle with you for your
soul. King, are you mad, this thought you have thought in your
brain?"</p>

<p>"Gonar," answered Bran somberly, "this day I stood still and
watched a man of mine die on the cross of Rome. What his name or
his rank, I do not know. I do not care. He might have been a
faithful unknown warrior of mine, he might have been an outlaw. I
only know that he was mine; the first scents he knew were the
scents of the heather; the first light he saw was the sunrise on
the Pictish hills. He belonged to me, not to Rome. If punishment
was just, then none but me should have dealt it. If he were to be
tried, none but me should have been his judge. The same blood
flowed in our veins; the same fire maddened our brains; in infancy
we listened to the same old tales, and in youth we sang the same
old songs. He was bound to my heartstrings, as every man and every
woman and every child of Pictland is bound. It was mine to protect
him; now it is mine to avenge him."</p>

<p>"But in the name of the gods, Bran," expostulated the wizard,
"take your vengeance in another way! Return to the
heather&mdash;mass your warriorsjoin with Cormac and his Gaels, and
spread a sea of blood and flame the length of the great Wall!"</p>

<p>"All that I will do," grimly answered Bran. "But
<i>now</i>&mdash;now&mdash;I will have a vengeance such as no Roman
ever dreamed of! Ha, what do they know of the mysteries of this
ancient isle, which sheltered strange life long before Rome rose
from the marshes of the Tiber?"</p>

<p>"Bran, there are weapons too foul to use, even against
Rome!"</p>

<p>Bran barked short and sharp as a jackal.</p>

<p>"Ha! There are no weapons I would not use against Rome! My back
is at the wall. By the blood of the fiends, has Rome fought me
fair? Bah! I am a barbarian king with a wolfskin mantle and an iron
crown, fighting with my handful of bows and broken pikes against
the queen of the world. What have I? The heather hills, the wattle
huts, the spears of my shock-headed tribesmen! And I fight
Rome&mdash;with her armored legions, her broad fertile plains and
rich seas&mdash;her mountains and her rivers and her gleaming
citiesher wealth, her steel, her gold, her mastery and her wrath.
By steel and fire I will fight her&mdash;and by subtlety and
treachery&mdash;by the thorn in the foot, the adder in the path,
the venom in the cup, the dagger in the dark; aye," his voice sank
somberly, "and by the worms of the earth!"</p>

<p>"But it is madness!" cried Gonar. "You will perish in the
attempt you planyou will go down to Hell and you will not return!
What of your people then?"</p>

<p>"If I can not serve them I had better die," growled the
king.</p>

<p>"But you can not even reach the beings you seek," cried Gonar.
"For untold centuries they have dwelt apart. There is no door by
which you can come to them. Long ago they severed the bonds that
bound them to the world we know."</p>

<p>"Long ago," answered Bran somberly, "you told me that nothing in
the universe was separated from the stream of Life&mdash;a saying
the truth of which I have often seen evident. No race, no form of
life but is close-knit somehow, by some manner, to the rest of Life
and the world. Somewhere there is a thin link connecting
<i>those</i> I seek to the world I know. Somewhere there is a Door.
And somewhere among the bleak fens of the west I will find it."</p>

<p>Stark horror flooded Gonar's eyes and he gave back crying, "Woe!
Woe! Woe! to Pictdom! Woe to the unborn kingdom! Woe, black woe to
the sons of men! Woe, woe, woe, woe!"</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>Bran awoke to a shadowed room and the starlight on the
window-bars. The moon had sunk from sight though its glow was still
faint above the house tops. Memory of his dream shook him and he
swore beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Rising, he flung off cloak and mantle, donning a light shirt of
black mesh-mail, and girding on sword and dirk. Going again to the
iron-bound chest he lifted several compact bags and emptied the
clinking contents into the leathern pouch at his girdle. Then
wrapping his wide cloak about him, he silently left the house. No
servants there were to spy on him&mdash;he had impatiently refused
the offer of slaves which it was Rome's policy to furnish her
barbarian emissaries. Gnarled Grom had attended to all Bran's
simple needs.</p>

<p>The stables fronted on the courtyard. A moment's groping in the
dark and he placed his hand over a great stallion's nose, checking
the nicker of recognition. Working without a light he swiftly
bridled and saddled the great brute, and went through the courtyard
into a shadowy side street, leading him. The moon was setting, the
border of floating shadows widening along the western wall. Silence
lay on the marble palaces and mud hovels of Eboracum under the cold
stars.</p>

<p>Bran touched the pouch at his girdle, which was heavy with
minted gold that bore the stamp of Rome. He had come to Eboracum
posing as an emissary of Pictdom, to act the spy. But being a
barbarian, he had not been able to play his part in aloof formality
and sedate dignity. He retained a crowded memory of wild feasts
where wine flowed in fountains; of white-bosomed Roman women, who,
sated with civilized lovers, looked with something more than favor
on a virile barbarian; of gladiatorial games; and of other games
where dice clicked and spun and tall stacks of gold changed hands.
He had drunk deeply and gambled recklessly, after the manner of
barbarians, and he had had a remarkable run of luck, due possibly
to the indifference with which he won or lost. Gold to the Pict was
so much dust, flowing through his fingers. In his land there was no
need of it. But he had learned its power in the boundaries of
civilization.</p>

<p>Almost under the shadow of the northwestern wall he saw ahead of
him loom the great watchtower which was connected with and reared
above the outer wall. One corner of the castle-like fortress,
farthest from the wall, served as a dungeon. Bran left his horse
standing in a dark alley, with the reins hanging on the ground, and
stole like a prowling wolf into the shadows of the fortress.</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>The young officer Valerius was awakened from a light, unquiet
sleep by a stealthy sound at the barred window. He sat up, cursing
softly under his breath as the faint starlight which etched the
window-bars fell across the bare stone floor and reminded him of
his disgrace. Well, in a few days, he ruminated, he'd be well out
of it; Sulla would not be too harsh on a man with such high
connections; then let any man or woman gibe at him! Damn that
insolent Pict! But wait, he thought suddenly, remembering: what of
the sound which had roused him?</p>

<p>"Hsssst!" it was a voice from the window.</p>

<p>Why so much secrecy? It could hardly be a foe&mdash;yet, why
should it be a friend? Valerius rose and crossed his cell, coming
close to the window. Outside all was dim in the starlight and he
made out but a shadowy form close to the window.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he leaned close against the bars, straining his
eyes into the gloom.</p>

<p>His answer was a snarl of wolfish laughter, a long flicker of
steel in the starlight. Valerius reeled away from the window and
crashed to the floor, clutching his throat, gurgling horribly as he
tried to scream. Blood gushed through his fingers, forming about
his twitching body a pool that reflected the dim starlight dully
and redly.</p>

<p>Outside Bran glided away like a shadow, without pausing to peer
into the cell. In another minute the guards would round the corner
on their regular routine. Even now he heard the measured tramp of
their iron-clad feet. Before they came in sight he had vanished and
they clumped stolidly by the cell-window with no intimation of the
corpse that lay on the floor within.</p>

<p>Bran rode to the small gate in the western wall, unchallenged by
the sleepy watch. What fear of foreign invasion in
Eboracum?&mdash;and certain well organized thieves and
women-stealers made it profitable for the watchmen not to be too
vigilant. But the single guardsman at the western gate&mdash;his
fellows lay drunk in a nearby brothel&mdash;lifted his spear and
bawled for Bran to halt and give an account of himself. Silently
the Pict reined closer. Masked in the dark cloak, he seemed dim and
indistinct to the Roman, who was only aware of the glitter of his
cold eyes in the gloom. But Bran held up his hand against the
starlight and the soldier caught the gleam of gold; in the other
hand he saw a long sheen of steel. The soldier understood, and he
did not hesitate between the choice of a golden bribe or a battle
to the death with this unknown rider who was apparently a barbarian
of some sort. With a grunt he lowered his spear and swung the gate
open. Bran rode through, casting a handful of coins to the Roman.
They fell about his feet in a golden shower, clinking against the
flags. He bent in greedy haste to retrieve them and Bran Mak Morn
rode westward like a flying ghost in the night.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="worms3" name=

</h2>

<p class="first">INTO the dim fens of the west came Bran Mak Morn.
A cold wind breathed across the gloomy waste and against the gray
sky a few herons flapped heavily. The long reeds and marsh-grass
waved in broken undulations and out across the desolation of the
wastes a few still meres reflected the dull light. Here and there
rose curiously regular hillocks above the general levels, and gaunt
against the somber sky Bran saw a marching line of upright
monoliths&mdash;menhirs, reared by what nameless hands?</p>

<p>A faint blue line to the west lay the foothills that beyond the
horizon grew to the wild mountains of Wales where dwelt still wild
Celtic tribesfierce blue-eyed men that knew not the yoke of Rome. A
row of well-garrisoned watchtowers held them in check. Even now,
far away across the moors, Bran glimpsed the unassailable keep men
called the Tower of Trajan.</p>

<p>These barren wastes seemed the dreary accomplishment of
desolation, yet human life was not utterly lacking. Bran met the
silent men of the fen, reticent, dark of eye and hair, speaking a
strange mixed tongue whose long-blended elements had forgotten
their pristine separate sources. Bran recognized a certain kinship
in these people to himself, but he looked on them with the scorn of
a pure-blooded patrician for men of mixed strains.</p>

<p>Not that the common people of Caledonia were altogether
pure-blooded; they got their stocky bodies and massive limbs from a
primitive Teutonic race which had found its way into the northern
tip of the isle even before the Celtic conquest of Britain was
completed, and had been absorbed by the Picts. But the chiefs of
Bran's folk had kept their blood from foreign taint since the
beginnings of time, and he himself was a pure-bred Pict of the Old
Race. But these fenmen, overrun repeatedly by British, Gaelic and
Roman conquerors, had assimilated blood of each, and in the process
almost forgotten their original language and lineage.</p>

<p>For Bran came of a race that was very old, which had spread over
western Europe in one vast Dark Empire, before the coming of the
Aryans, when the ancestors of the Celts, the Hellenes and the
Germans were one primal people, before the days of tribal
splitting-off and westward drift.</p>

<p>Only in Caledonia, Bran brooded, had his people resisted the
flood of Aryan conquest. He had heard of a Pictish people called
Basques, who in the crags of the Pyrenees called themselves an
unconquered race; but he knew that they had paid tribute for
centuries to the ancestors of the Gaels, before these Celtic
conquerors abandoned their mountain-realm and set sail for Ireland.
Only the Picts of Caledonia had remained free, and they had been
scattered into small feuding tribes&mdash;he was the first
acknowledged king in five hundred years&mdash;the beginning of a
new dynasty&mdash;no, a revival of an ancient dynasty under a new
name. In the very teeth of Rome he dreamed his dreams of
empire.</p>

<p>He wandered through the fens, seeking a Door. Of his quest he
said nothing to the dark-eyed fenmen. They told him news that
drifted from mouth to moutha tale of war in the north, the skirl of
war-pipes along the winding Wall, of gathering-fires in the
heather, of flame and smoke and rapine and the glutting of Gaelic
swords in the crimson sea of slaughter. The eagles of the legions
were moving northward and the ancient road resounded to the
measured tramp of the iron-clad feet. And Bran, in the fens of the
west, laughed, well pleased.</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>In Eboracum, Titus Sulla gave secret word to seek out the
Pictish emissary with the Gaelic name who had been under suspicion,
and who had vanished the night young Valerius was found dead in his
cell with his throat ripped out. Sulla felt that this sudden
bursting flame of war on the Wall was connected closely with his
execution of a condemned Pictish criminal, and he set his spy
system to work, though he felt sure that Partha Mac Othna was by
this time far beyond his reach. He prepared to march from Eboracum,
but he did not accompany the considerable force of legionaries
which he sent north. Sulla was a brave man, but each man has his
own dread, and Sulla's was Cormac na Connacht, the black-haired
prince of the Gaels, who had sworn to cut out the governor's heart
and eat it raw. So Sulla rode with his ever-present bodyguard,
westward, where lay the Tower of Trajan with its warlike commander,
Caius Camillus, who enjoyed nothing more than taking his superior's
place when the red waves of war washed at the foot of the Wall.
Devious politics, but the legate of Rome seldom visited this far
isle, and what of his wealth and intrigues, Titus Sulla was the
highest power in Britain.</p>

<p>And Bran, knowing all this, patiently waited his coming, in the
deserted hut in which he had taken up his abode.</p>

<p>One gray evening he strode on foot across the moors, a stark
figure, blackly etched against the dim crimson fire of the sunset.
He felt the incredible antiquity of the slumbering land, as he
walked like the last man on the day after the end of the world. Yet
at last he saw a token of human life&mdash;a drab hut of wattle and
mud, set in the reedy breast of the fen.</p>

<p>A woman greeted him from the open door and Bran's somber eyes
narrowed with a dark suspicion. The woman was not old, yet the evil
wisdom of ages was in her eyes; her garments were ragged and
scanty, her black locks tangled and unkempt, lending her an aspect
of wildness well in keeping with her grim surroundings. Her red
lips laughed but there was no mirth in her laughter, only a hint of
mockery, and under the lips her teeth showed sharp and pointed like
fangs.</p>

<p>"Enter, master," said she, "if you do not fear to share the roof
of the witch-woman of Dagon-moor!"</p>

<p>Bran entered silently and sat him down on a broken bench while
the woman busied herself with the scanty meal cooking over an open
fire on the squalid hearth. He studied her lithe, almost serpentine
motions, the ears which were almost pointed, the yellow eyes which
slanted curiously.</p>

<p>"What do you seek in the fens, my lord?" she asked, turning
toward him with a supple twist of her whole body.</p>

<p>"I seek a Door," he answered, chin resting on his fist. "I have
a song to sing to the worms of the earth!"</p>

<p>She started upright, a jar falling from her hands to shatter on
the hearth.</p>

<p>"This is an ill saying, even spoken in chance," she
stammered.</p>

<p>"I speak not by chance but by intent," he answered.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I know not what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well you know," he returned. "Aye, you know well! My race is
very oldthey reigned in Britain before the nations of the Celts and
the Hellenes were born out of the womb of peoples. But my people
were not first in Britain. By the mottles on your skin, by the
slanting of your eyes, by the taint in your veins, I speak with
full knowledge and meaning."</p>

<p>Awhile she stood silent, her lips smiling but her face
inscrutable.</p>

<p>"Man, are you mad," she asked, "that in your madness you come
seeking that from which strong men fled screaming in old
times?"</p>

<p>"I seek a vengeance," he answered, "that can be accomplished
only by Them I seek."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You have listened to a bird singing; you have dreamed empty
dreams."</p>

<p>"I have heard a viper hiss," he growled, "and I do not dream.
Enough of this weaving of words. I came seeking a link between two
worlds; I have found it."</p>

<p>"I need lie to you no more, man of the North," answered the
woman. "They you seek still dwell beneath the sleeping hills. They
have drawn <i>apart</i>, farther and farther from the world you
know."</p>

<p>"But they still steal forth in the night to grip women straying
on the moors," said he, his gaze on her slanted eyes. She laughed
wickedly.</p>

<p>"What would you of me?"</p>

<p>"That you bring me to Them."</p>

<p>She flung back her head with a scornful laugh. His left hand
locked like iron in the breast of her scanty garment and his right
closed on his hilt. She laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Strike and be damned, my northern wolf! Do you think that such
life as mine is so sweet that I would cling to it as a babe to the
breast?"</p>

<p>His hand fell away.</p>

<p>"You are right. Threats are foolish. I will buy your aid."</p>

<p>"How?" the laughing voice hummed with mockery.</p>

<p>Bran opened his pouch and poured into his cupped palm a stream
of gold.</p>

<p>"More wealth than the men of the fen ever dreamed of."</p>

<p>Again she laughed. "What is this rusty metal to me? Save it for
some white-breasted Roman woman who will play the traitor for
you!"</p>

<p>"Name me a price!" he urged. "The head of an enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the blood in my veins, with its heritage of ancient hate,
who is mine enemy but thee?" she laughed and springing, struck
catlike. But her dagger splintered on the mail beneath his cloak
and he flung her off with a loathsome flit of his wrist which
tossed her sprawling across her grass-strewn bunk. Lying there she
laughed up at him.</p>

<p>"I will name you a price, then, my wolf, and it may be in days
to come you will curse the armor that broke Atla's dagger!" She
rose and came close to him, her disquietingly long hands fastened
fiercely into his cloak. "I will tell you, Black Bran, king of
Caledon! Oh, I knew you when you came into my hut with your black
hair and your cold eyes! I will lead you to the doors of Hell if
you wish&mdash;and the price shall be the kisses of a king!</p>

<p>"What of my blasted and bitter life, I, whom mortal men loathe
and fear? I have not known the love of men, the clasp of a strong
arm, the sting of human kisses, I, Atla, the were-woman of the
moors! What have I known but the lone winds of the fens, the dreary
fire of cold sunsets, the whispering of the marsh
grasses?&mdash;the faces that blink up at me in the waters of the
meres, the foot-pad of night&mdash;things in the gloom, the glimmer
of red eyes, the grisly murmur of nameless beings in the night!</p>

<p>"I am half-human, at least! Have I not known sorrow and yearning
and crying wistfulness, and the drear ache of loneliness? Give to
me, kinggive me your fierce kisses and your hurtful barbarian's
embrace. Then in the long drear years to come I shall not utterly
eat out my heart in vain envy of the white-bosomed women of men;
for I shall have a memory few of them can boast&mdash;the kisses of
a king! One night of love, oh king, and I will guide you to the
gates of Hell!"</p>

<p>Bran eyed her somberly; he reached forth and gripped her arm in
his iron fingers. An involuntary shudder shook him at the feel of
her sleek skin. He nodded slowly and drawing her close to him,
forced his head down to meet her lifted lips.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="worms4" name=
"worms4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE cold gray mists of dawn wrapped King Bran like
a clammy cloak. He turned to the woman whose slanted eyes gleamed
in the gray gloom.</p>

<p>"Make good your part of the contract," he said roughly. "I
sought a link between worlds, and in you I found it. I seek the one
thing sacred to Them. It shall be the Key opening the Door that
lies unseen between me and Them. Tell me how I can reach it."</p>

<p>"I will," the red lips smiled terribly. "Go to the mound men
call Dagon's Barrow. Draw aside the stone that blocks the entrance
and go under the dome of the mound. The floor of the chamber is
made of seven great stones, six grouped about the seventh. Lift out
the center stone&mdash;and you will see!"</p>

<p>"Will I find the Black Stone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dagon's Barrow is the Door to the Black Stone," she answered,
"if you dare follow the Road."</p>

<p>"Will the symbol be well guarded?" He unconsciously loosened his
blade in its sheath. The red lips curled mockingly.</p>

<p>"If you meet any on the Road you will die as no mortal man has
died for long centuries. The Stone is not guarded, as men guard
their treasures. Why should They guard what man has never sought?
Perhaps They will be near, perhaps not. It is a chance you must
take, if you wish the Stone. Beware, king of Pictdom! Remember it
was your folk who, so long ago, cut the thread that bound Them to
human life. They were almost human then&mdash;they overspread the
land and knew the sunlight. Now they have drawn apart. They know
not the sunlight and they shun the light of the moon. Even the
starlight they hate. Far, far apart have they drawn, who might have
been men in time, but for the spears of your ancestors."</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>The sky was overcast with misty gray, through which the sun
shone coldly yellow when Bran came to Dagon's Barrow, a round
hillock overgrown with rank grass of a curious fungoid appearance.
On the eastern side of the mound showed the entrance of a crudely
built stone tunnel which evidently penetrated the barrow. One great
stone blocked the entrance to the tomb. Bran laid hold of the sharp
edges and exerted all his strength. It held fast. He drew his sword
and worked the blade between the blocking stone and the sill. Using
the sword as a lever, he worked carefully, and managed to loosen
the great stone and wrench it out. A foul charnel house scent
flowed out of the aperture and the dim sunlight seemed less to
illuminate the cavern-like opening than to be fouled by the rank
darkness which clung there.</p>

<p>Sword in hand, ready for he knew not what, Bran groped his way
into the tunnel, which was long and narrow, built up of heavy
joined stones, and was too low for him to stand erect. Either his
eyes became somewhat accustomed to the gloom, or the darkness was,
after all, somewhat lightened by the sunlight filtering in through
the entrance. At any rate he came into a round low chamber and was
able to make out its general dome-like outline. Here, no doubt, in
old times, had reposed the bones of him for whom the stones of the
tomb had been joined and the earth heaped high above them; but now
of those bones no vestige remained on the stone floor. And bending
close and straining his eyes, Bran made out the strange,
startlingly regular pattern of that floor: six well-cut slabs
clustered about a seventh, six-sided stone.</p>

<p>He drove his sword-point into a crack and pried carefully. The
edge of the central stone tilted slightly upward. A little work and
he lifted it out and leaned it against the curving wall. Straining
his eyes downward he saw only the gaping blackness of a dark well,
with small, worn steps that led downward and out of sight. He did
not hesitate. Though the skin between his shoulders crawled
curiously, he swung himself into the abyss and felt the clinging
blackness swallow him.</p>

<p>Groping downward, he felt his feet slip and stumble on steps too
small for human feet. With one hand pressed hard against the side
of the well he steadied himself, fearing a fall into unknown and
unlighted depths. The steps were cut into solid rock, yet they were
greatly worn away. The farther he progressed, the less like steps
they became, mere bumps of worn stone. Then the direction of the
shaft changed sharply. It still led down, but at a shallow slant
down which he could walk, elbows braced against the hollowed sides,
head bent low beneath the curved roof. The steps had ceased
altogether and the stone felt slimy to the touch, like a serpent's
lair. What beings, Bran wondered, had slithered up and down this
slanting shaft, for how many centuries?</p>

<p>The tunnel narrowed until Bran found it rather difficult to
shove through. He lay on his back and pushed himself along with his
hands, feet first. Still he knew he was sinking deeper and deeper
into the very guts of the earth; how far below the surface he was,
he dared not contemplate. Then ahead a faint witch-fire gleam
tinged the abysmal blackness. He grinned savagely and without
mirth. If They he sought came suddenly upon him, how could he fight
in that narrow shaft? But he had put the thought of personal fear
behind him when he began this hellish quest. He crawled on,
thoughtless of all else but his goal.</p>

<p>And he came at last into a vast space where he could stand
upright. He could not see the roof of the place, but he got an
impression of dizzying vastness. The blackness pressed in on all
sides and behind him he could see the entrance to the shaft from
which he had just emerged&mdash;a black well in the darkness. But
in front of him a strange grisly radiance glowed about a grim altar
built of human skulls. The source of that light he could not
determine, but on the altar lay a sullen night-black
object&mdash;the Black Stone!</p>

<p>Bran wasted no time in giving thanks that the guardians of the
grim relic were nowhere near. He caught up the Stone, and gripping
it under his left arm, crawled into the shaft. When a man turns his
back on peril its clammy menace looms more grisly than when he
advances upon it. So Bran, crawling back up the nighted shaft with
his grisly prize, felt the darkness turn on him and slink behind
him, grinning with dripping fangs. Clammy sweat beaded his flesh
and he hastened to the best of his ability, ears strained for some
stealthy sound to betray that fell shapes were at his heels. Strong
shudders shook him, despite himself, and the short hair on his neck
prickled as if a cold wind blew at his back.</p>

<p>When he reached the first of the tiny steps he felt as if he had
attained to the outer boundaries of the mortal world. Up them he
went, stumbling and slipping, and with a deep gasp of relief, came
out into the tomb, whose spectral grayness seemed like the blaze of
noon in comparison to the stygian depths he had just traversed. He
replaced the central stone and strode into the light of the outer
day, and never was the cold yellow light of the sun more grateful,
as it dispelled the shadows of black-winged nightmares of fear and
madness that seemed to have ridden him up out of the black deeps.
He shoved the great blocking stone back into place, and picking up
the cloak he had left at the mouth of the tomb, he wrapped it about
the Black Stone and hurried away, a strong revulsion and loathing
shaking his soul and lending wings to his strides.</p>

<p>A gray silence brooded over the land. It was desolate as the
blind side of the moon, yet Bran felt the potentialities of
life&mdash;under his feet, in the brown earth&mdash;sleeping, but
how soon to waken, and in what horrific fashion?</p>

<p>He came through the tall masking reeds to the still deep men
called Dagon's Mere. No slightest ripple ruffled the cold blue
water to give evidence of the grisly monster legend said dwelt
beneath. Bran closely scanned the breathless landscape. He saw no
hint of life, human or unhuman. He sought the instincts of his
savage soul to know if any unseen eyes fixed their lethal gaze upon
him, and found no response. He was alone as if he were the last man
alive on earth.</p>

<p>Swiftly he unwrapped the Black Stone, and as it lay in his hands
like a solid sullen block of darkness, he did not seek to learn the
secret of its material nor scan the cryptic characters carved
thereon. Weighing it in his hands and calculating the distance, he
flung it far out, so that it fell almost exactly in the middle of
the lake. A sullen splash and the waters closed over it. There was
a moment of shimmering flashes on the bosom of the lake; then the
blue surface stretched placid and unrippled again.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="worms5" name=
"worms5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE were-woman turned swiftly as Bran approached
her door. Her slant eyes widened.</p>

<p>"You! And alive! And sane!"</p>

<p>"I have been into Hell and I have returned," he growled. "What
is more, I have that which I sought."</p>

<p>"The Black Stone?" she cried. "You really dared steal it? Where
is it?"</p>

<p>"No matter; but last night my stallion screamed in his stall and
I heard something crunch beneath his thundering hoofs which was not
the wall of the stable&mdash;and there was blood on his hoofs when
I came to see, and blood on the floor of the stall. And I have
heard stealthy sounds in the night, and noises beneath my dirt
floor, as if worms burrowed deep in the earth. They know I have
stolen their Stone. Have you betrayed me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I keep your secret; they do not need my word to know you. The
farther they have retreated from the world of men, the greater have
grown their powers in other uncanny ways. Some dawn your hut will
stand empty and if men dare investigate they will find
nothing&mdash;except crumbling bits of earth on the dirt
floor."</p>

<p>Bran smiled terribly.</p>

<p>"I have not planned and toiled thus far to fall prey to the
talons of vermin. If They strike me down in the night, They will
never know what became of their idol&mdash;or whatever it be to
Them. I would speak with Them."</p>

<p>"Dare you come with me and meet them in the night?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Thunder of all gods!" he snarled. "Who are you to ask me if I
dare? Lead me to Them and let me bargain for a vengeance this
night. The hour of retribution draws nigh. This day I saw silvered
helmets and bright shields gleam across the fens&mdash;the new
commander has arrived at the Tower of Trajan and Caius Camillus has
marched to the Wall."</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>That night the king went across the dark desolation of the moors
with the silent were-woman. The night was thick and still as if the
land lay in ancient slumber. The stars blinked vaguely, mere points
of red struggling through the unbreathing gloom. Their gleam was
dimmer than the glitter in the eyes of the woman who glided beside
the king. Strange thoughts shook Bran, vague, titanic, primeval.
Tonight ancestral linkings with these slumbering fens stirred in
his soul and troubled him with the phantasmal, eon-veiled shapes of
monstrous dreams. The vast age of his race was borne upon him;
where now he walked an outlaw and an alien, dark-eyed kings in
whose mold he was cast had reigned in old times. The Celtic and
Roman invaders were as strangers to this ancient isle beside his
people. Yet his race likewise had been invaders, and there was an
older race than his&mdash;a race whose beginnings lay lost and
hidden back beyond the dark oblivion of antiquity.</p>

<p>Ahead of them loomed a low range of hills, which formed the
easternmost extremity of those straying chains which far away
climbed at last to the mountains of Wales. The woman led the way up
what might have been a sheep-path, and halted before a wide black
gaping cave.</p>

<p>"A door to those you seek, oh king!" her laughter rang hateful
in the gloom. "Dare ye enter?"</p>

<p>His fingers closed in her tangled locks and he shook her
viciously.</p>

<p>"Ask me but once more if I dare," he grated, "and your head and
shoulders part company! Lead on."</p>

<p>Her laughter was like sweet deadly venom. They passed into the
cave and Bran struck flint and steel. The flicker of the tinder
showed him a wide dusty cavern, on the roof of which hung clusters
of bats. Lighting a torch, he lifted it and scanned the shadowy
recesses, seeing nothing but dust and emptiness.</p>

<p>"Where are They?" he growled.</p>

<p>She beckoned him to the back of the cave and leaned against the
rough wall, as if casually. But the king's keen eyes caught the
motion of her hand pressing hard against a projecting ledge. He
recoiled as a round black well gaped suddenly at his feet. Again
her laughter slashed him like a keen silver knife. He held the
torch to the opening and again saw small worn steps leading
down.</p>

<p>"They do not need those steps," said Atla. "Once they did,
before your people drove them into the darkness. But you will need
them."</p>

<p>She thrust the torch into a niche above the well; it shed a
faint red light into the darkness below. She gestured into the well
and Bran loosened his sword and stepped into the shaft. As he went
down into the mystery of the darkness, the light was blotted out
above him, and he thought for an instant Atla had covered the
opening again. Then he realized that she was descending after
him.</p>

<p>The descent was not a long one. Abruptly Bran felt his feet on a
solid floor. Atla swung down beside him and stood in the dim circle
of light that drifted down the shaft. Bran could not see the limits
of the place into which he had come.</p>

<p>"Many caves in these hills," said Atla, her voice sounding small
and strangely brittle in the vastness, "are but doors to greater
caves which lie beneath, even as a man's words and deeds are but
small indications of the dark caverns of murky thought lying behind
and beneath."</p>

<p>And now Bran was aware of movement in the gloom. The darkness
was filled with stealthy noises not like those made by any human
foot. Abruptly sparks began to flash and float in the blackness,
like flickering fireflies. Closer they came until they girdled him
in a wide half-moon. And beyond the ring gleamed other sparks, a
solid sea of them, fading away in the gloom until the farthest were
mere tiny pin-points of light. And Bran knew they were the slanted
eyes of the beings who had come upon him in such numbers that his
brain reeled at the contemplation&mdash;and at the vastness of the
cavern.</p>

<p>Now that he faced his ancient foes, Bran knew no fear. He felt
the waves of terrible menace emanating from them, the grisly hate,
the inhuman threat to body, mind and soul. More than a member of a
less ancient race, he realized the horror of his position, but he
did not fear, though he confronted the ultimate Horror of the
dreams and legends of his race. His blood raced fiercely but it was
with the hot excitement of the hazard, not the drive of terror.</p>

<p>"They know you have the Stone, oh king," said Atla, and though
he knew she feared, though he felt her physical efforts to control
her trembling limbs, there was no quiver of fright in her voice.
"You are in deadly peril; they know your breed of old&mdash;oh,
they remember the days when their ancestors were men! I can not
save you; both of us will die as no human has died for ten
centuries. Speak to them, if you will; they can understand your
speech, though you may not understand theirs. But it will avail
not&mdash;you are human&mdash;and a Pict."</p>

<p>Bran laughed and the closing ring of fire shrank back at the
savagery in his laughter. Drawing his sword with a soul-chilling
rasp of steel, he set his back against what he hoped was a solid
stone wall. Facing the glittering eyes with his sword gripped in
his right hand and his dirk in his left, he laughed as a
blood-hungry wolf snarls.</p>

<p>"Aye," he growled, "I am a Pict, a son of those warriors who
drove your brutish ancestors before them like chaff before the
storm!&mdash;who flooded the land with your blood and heaped high
your skulls for a sacrifice to the Moon-Woman! You who fled of old
before my race, dare ye now snarl at your master? Roll on me like a
flood now, if ye dare! Before your viper fangs drink my life I will
reap your multitudes like ripened barley&mdash;of your severed
heads will I build a tower and of your mangled corpses will I rear
up a wall! Dogs of the dark, vermin of Hell, worms of the earth,
rush in and try my steel! When Death finds me in this dark cavern,
your living will howl for the scores of your dead and your Black
Stone will be lost to you foreverfor only I know where it is hidden
and not all the tortures of all the Hells can wring the secret from
my lips!"</p>

<p>Then followed a tense silence; Bran faced the fire-lit darkness,
tensed like a wolf at bay, waiting the charge; at his side the
woman cowered, her eyes ablaze. Then from the silent ring that
hovered beyond the dim torchlight rose a vague abhorrent murmur.
Bran, prepared as he was for anything, started. Gods, was
<i>that</i> the speech of creatures which had once been called
men?</p>

<p>Atla straightened, listening intently. From her lips came the
same hideous soft sibilances, and Bran, though he had already known
the grisly secret of her being, knew that never again could he
touch her save with soul-shaken loathing.</p>

<p>She turned to him, a strange smile curving her red lips dimly in
the ghostly light.</p>

<p>"They fear you, oh king! By the black secrets of R'lyeh, who are
you that Hell itself quails before you? Not your steel, but the
stark ferocity of your soul has driven unused fear into their
strange minds. They will buy back the Black Stone at any
price."</p>

<p>"Good," Bran sheathed his weapons. "They shall promise not to
molest you because of your aid of me. And," his voice hummed like
the purr of a hunting tiger, "they shall deliver into my hands
Titus Sulla, governor of Eboracum, now commanding the Tower of
Trajan. This They can do&mdash;how, I know not. But I know that in
the old days, when my people warred with these Children of the
Night, babes disappeared from guarded huts and none saw the
stealers come or go. Do They understand?"</p>

<p>Again rose the low frightful sounds and Bran, who feared not
their wrath, shuddered at their voices.</p>

<p>"They understand," said Atla. "Bring the Black Stone to Dagon's
Ring tomorrow night when the earth is veiled with the blackness
that foreruns the dawn. Lay the Stone on the altar. There They will
bring Titus Sulla to you. Trust Them; They have not interfered in
human affairs for many centuries, but They will keep their
word."</p>

<p>Bran nodded and turning, climbed up the stair with Atla close
behind him. At the top he turned and looked down once more. As far
as he could see floated a glittering ocean of slanted yellow eyes
upturned. But the owners of those eyes kept carefully beyond the
dim circle of torchlight and of their bodies he could see nothing.
Their low hissing speech floated up to him and he shuddered as his
imagination visualized, not a throng of biped creatures, but a
swarming, swaying myriad of serpents, gazing up at him with their
glittering unwinking eyes.</p>

<p>He swung into the upper cave and Atla thrust the blocking stone
back in place. It fitted into the entrance of the well with uncanny
precision; Bran was unable to discern any crack in the apparently
solid floor of the cavern. Atla made a motion to extinguish the
torch, but the king stayed her.</p>

<p>"Keep it so until we are out of the cave," he grunted. "We might
tread on an adder in the dark."</p>

<p>Atla's sweetly hateful laughter rose maddeningly in the
flickering gloom.</p>

</h2>

<p class="first">IT was not long before sunset when Bran came again
to the reed-grown marge of Dagon's Mere. Casting cloak and
sword-belt on the ground, he stripped himself of his short leathern
breeches. Then gripping his naked dirk in his teeth, he went into
the water with the smooth ease of a diving seal. Swimming strongly,
he gained the center of the small lake, and turning, drove himself
downward.</p>

<p>The mere was deeper than he had thought. It seemed he would
never reach the bottom, and when he did, his groping hands failed
to find what he sought. A roaring in his ears warned him and he
swam to the surface.</p>

<p>Gulping deep of the refreshing air, he dived again, and again
his quest was fruitless. A third time he sought the depth, and this
time his groping hands met a familiar object in the silt of the
bottom. Grasping it, he swam up to the surface.</p>

<p>The Stone was not particularly bulky, but it was heavy. He swam
leisurely, and suddenly was aware of a curious stir in the waters
about him which was not caused by his own exertions. Thrusting his
face below the surface, he tried to pierce the blue depths with his
eyes and thought to see a dim gigantic shadow hovering there.</p>

<p>He swam faster, not frightened, but wary. His feet struck the
shallows and he waded up on the shelving shore. Looking back he saw
the waters swirl and subside. He shook his head, swearing. He had
discounted the ancient legend which made Dagon's Mere the lair of a
nameless water-monster, but now he had a feeling as if his escape
had been narrow. The time-worn myths of the ancient land were
taking form and coming to life before his eyes. What primeval shape
lurked below the surface of that treacherous mere, Bran could not
guess, but he felt that the fenmen had good reason for shunning the
spot, after all.</p>

<p>Bran donned his garments, mounted the black stallion and rode
across the fens in the desolate crimson of the sunset's afterglow,
with the Black Stone wrapped in his cloak. He rode, not to his hut,
but to the west, in the direction of the Tower of Trajan and the
Ring of Dagon. As he covered the miles that lay between, the red
stars winked out. Midnight passed him in the moonless night and
still Bran rode on. His heart was hot for his meeting with Titus
Sulla. Atla had gloated over the anticipation of watching the Roman
writhe under torture, but no such thought was in the Pict's mind.
The governor should have his chance with weapons&mdash;with Bran's
own sword he should face the Pictish king's dirk, and live or die
according to his prowess. And though Sulla was famed throughout the
provinces as a swordsman, Bran felt no doubt as to the outcome.</p>

<p>Dagon's Ring lay some distance from the Tower&mdash;a sullen
circle of tall gaunt stones planted upright, with a rough-hewn
stone altar in the center. The Romans looked on these menhirs with
aversion; they thought the Druids had reared them; but the Celts
supposed Bran's people, the Picts, had planted them&mdash;and Bran
well knew what hands reared those grim monoliths in lost ages,
though for what reasons, he but dimly guessed.</p>

<p>The king did not ride straight to the Ring. He was consumed with
curiosity as to how his grim allies intended carrying out their
promise. That They could snatch Titus Sulla from the very midst of
his men, he felt sure, and he believed he knew how They would do
it. He felt the gnawings of a strange misgiving, as if he had
tampered with powers of unknown breadth and depth, and had loosed
forces which he could not control. Each time he remembered that
reptilian murmur, those slanted eyes of the night before, a cold
breath passed over him. They had been abhorrent enough when his
people drove Them into the caverns under the hills, ages ago; what
had long centuries of retrogression made of them? In their nighted,
subterranean life, had They retained any of the attributes of
humanity at all?</p>

<p>Some instinct prompted him to ride toward the Tower. He knew he
was near; but for the thick darkness he could have plainly seen its
stark outline tusking the horizon. Even now he should be able to
make it out dimly. An obscure, shuddersome premonition shook him
and he spurred the stallion into swift canter.</p>

<p>And suddenly Bran staggered in his saddle as from a physical
impact, so stunning was the surprize of what met his gaze. The
impregnable Tower of Trajan was no more! Bran's astounded gaze
rested on a gigantic pile of ruinsof shattered stone and crumbled
granite, from which jutted the jagged and splintered ends of broken
beams. At one corner of the tumbled heap one tower rose out of the
waste of crumpled masonry, and it leaned drunkenly as if its
foundations had been half cut away.</p>

<p>Bran dismounted and walked forward, dazed by bewilderment. The
moat was filled in places by fallen stones and broken pieces of
mortared wall. He crossed over and came among the ruins. Where, he
knew, only a few hours before the flags had resounded to the
martial tramp of iron-clad feet, and the walls had echoed to the
clang of shields and the blast of the loud-throated trumpets, a
horrific silence reigned.</p>

<p>Almost under Bran's feet, a broken shape writhed and groaned.
The king bent down to the legionary who lay in a sticky red pool of
his own blood. A single glance showed the Pict that the man,
horribly crushed and shattered, was dying.</p>

<p>Lifting the bloody head, Bran placed his flask to the pulped
lips and the Roman instinctively drank deep, gulping through
splintered teeth. In the dim starlight Bran saw his glazed eyes
roll.</p>

<p>"The walls fell," muttered the dying man. "They crashed down
like the skies falling on the day of doom. Ah Jove, the skies
rained shards of granite and hailstones of marble!"</p>

<p>"I have felt no earthquake shock," Bran scowled, puzzled.</p>

<p>"It was no earthquake," muttered the Roman. "Before last dawn it
began, the faint dim scratching and clawing far below the earth. We
of the guard heard it&mdash;like rats burrowing, or like worms
hollowing out the earth. Titus laughed at us, but all day long we
heard it. Then at midnight the Tower quivered and seemed to
settle&mdash;as if the foundations were being dug away&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shudder shook Bran Mak Morn. The worms of the earth! Thousands
of vermin digging like moles far below the castle, burrowing away
the foundationsgods, the land must be honeycombed with tunnels and
caverns&mdash;these creatures were even less human than he had
thought&mdash;what ghastly shapes of darkness had he invoked to his
aid?</p>

<p>"What of Titus Sulla?" he asked, again holding the flask to the
legionary's lips; in that moment the dying Roman seemed to him
almost like a brother.</p>

<p>"Even as the Tower shuddered we heard a fearful scream from the
governor's chamber," muttered the soldier. "We rushed
there&mdash;as we broke down the door we heard his
shrieks&mdash;they seemed to recede&mdash;<i>into the bowels of the
earth!</i> We rushed in; the chamber was empty. His bloodstained
sword lay on the floor; in the stone flags of the floor a black
hole gaped.
Then&mdash;the&mdash;towers&mdash;reeled&mdash;the&mdash;roof&mdash;broke;&mdash;through&mdash;a&mdash;storm&mdash;of&mdash;crashing&mdash;walls&mdash;I&mdash;crawled&mdash;"</p>

<p>A strong convulsion shook the broken figure.</p>

<p>"Lay me down, friend," whispered the Roman. "I die."</p>

<p>He had ceased to breathe before Bran could comply. The Pict
rose, mechanically cleansing his hands. He hastened from the spot,
and as he galloped over the darkened fens, the weight of the
accursed Black Stone under his cloak was as the weight of a foul
nightmare on a mortal breast.</p>

<p>As he approached the Ring, he saw an eery glow within, so that
the gaunt stones stood etched like the ribs of a skeleton in which
a witch-fire burns. The stallion snorted and reared as Bran tied
him to one of the menhirs. Carrying the Stone he strode into the
grisly circle and saw Atla standing beside the altar, one hand on
her hip, her sinuous body swaying in a serpentine manner. The altar
glowed all over with ghastly light and Bran knew someone, probably
Atla, had rubbed it with phosphorus from some dank swamp or
quagmire.</p>

<p>He strode forward and whipping his cloak from about the Stone,
flung the accursed thing on to the altar.</p>

<p>"I have fulfilled my part of the contract," he growled.</p>

<p>"And They, theirs," she retorted. "Look!&mdash;They come!"</p>

<p>He wheeled, his hand instinctively dropping to his sword.
Outside the Ring the great stallion screamed savagely and reared
against his tether. The night wind moaned through the waving grass
and an abhorrent soft hissing mingled with it. Between the menhirs
flowed a dark tide of shadows, unstable and chaotic. The Ring
filled with glittering eyes which hovered beyond the dim illusive
circle of illumination cast by the phosphorescent altar. Somewhere
in the darkness a human voice tittered and gibbered idiotically.
Bran stiffened, the shadows of a horror clawing at his soul.</p>

<p>He strained his eyes, trying to make out the shapes of those who
ringed him. But he glimpsed only billowing masses of shadow which
heaved and writhed and squirmed with almost fluid consistency.</p>

<p>"Let them make good their bargain!" he exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>"Then see, oh king!" cried Atla in a voice of piercing
mockery.</p>

<p>There was a stir, a seething in the writhing shadows, and from
the darkness crept, like a four-legged animal, a human shape that
fell down and groveled at Bran's feet and writhed and mowed, and
lifting a death's-head, howled like a dying dog. In the ghastly
light, Bran, soul-shaken, saw the blank glassy eyes, the bloodless
features, the loose, writhing, froth-covered lips of sheer
lunacy&mdash;gods, was this Titus Sulla, the proud lord of life and
death in Eboracum's proud city?</p>

<p>Bran bared his sword.</p>

<p>"I had thought to give this stroke in vengeance," he said
somberly. "I give it in mercy&mdash;<i>Vale Caesar!</i>"</p>

<p>The steel flashed in the eery light and Sulla's head rolled to
the foot of the glowing altar, where it lay staring up at the
shadowed sky.</p>

<p>"They harmed him not!" Atla's hateful laugh slashed the sick
silence. "It was what he saw and came to know that broke his brain!
Like all his heavy-footed race, he knew nothing of the secrets of
this ancient land. This night he has been dragged through the
deepest pits of Hell, where even you might have blenched!"</p>

<p>"Well for the Romans that they know not the secrets of this
accursed land!" Bran roared, maddened, "with its monster-haunted
meres, its foul witch-women, and its lost caverns and subterranean
realms where spawn in the darkness shapes of Hell!"</p>

<p>"Are they more foul than a mortal who seeks their aid?" cried
Atla with a shriek of fearful mirth. "Give them their Black
Stone!"</p>

<p>A cataclysmic loathing shook Bran's soul with red fury.</p>

<p>"Aye, take your cursed Stone!" he roared, snatching it from the
altar and dashing it among the shadows with such savagery that
bones snapped under its impact. A hurried babel of grisly tongues
rose and the shadows heaved in turmoil. One segment of the mass
detached itself for an instant and Bran cried out in fierce
revulsion, though he caught only a fleeting glimpse of the thing,
had only a brief impression of a broad strangely flattened head,
pendulous writhing lips that bared curved pointed fangs, and a
hideously misshapen, dwarfish body that
seemed&mdash;<i>mottled</i>&mdash;all set off by those unwinking
reptilian eyes. Gods!&mdash;the myths had prepared him for horror
in human aspect, horror induced by bestial visage and stunted
deformity&mdash;but this was the horror of nightmare and the
night.</p>

<p>"Go back to Hell and take your idol with you!" he yelled,
brandishing his clenched fists to the skies, as the thick shadows
receded, flowing back and away from him like the foul waters of
some black flood. "Your ancestors were men, though strange and
monstrous&mdash;but gods, ye have become in ghastly fact what my
people called ye in scorn!</p>

<p>"Worms of the earth, back into your holes and burrows! Ye foul
the air and leave on the clean earth the slime of the serpents ye
have become! Gonar was right&mdash;there are shapes too foul to use
even against Rome!"</p>

<p>He sprang from the Ring as a man flees the touch of a coiling
snake, and tore the stallion free. At his elbow Atla was shrieking
with fearful laughter, all human attributes dropped from her like a
cloak in the night.</p>

<p>"King of Pictland!" she cried, "King of fools! Do you blench at
so small a thing? Stay and let me show you real fruits of the pits!
Ha! ha! ha! Run, fool, run! But you are stained with the
taint&mdash;you have called them forth and they will remember! And
in their own time they will come to you again!"</p>

<p>He yelled a wordless curse and struck her savagely in the mouth
with his open hand. She staggered, blood starting from her lips,
but her fiendish laughter only rose higher.</p>

<p>Bran leaped into the saddle, wild for the clean heather and the
cold blue hills of the north where he could plunge his sword into
clean slaughter and his sickened soul into the red maelstrom of
battle, and forget the horror which lurked below the fens of the
west. He gave the frantic stallion the rein, and rode through the
night like a hunted ghost, until the hellish laughter of the
howling were-woman died out in the darkness behind.</p>
