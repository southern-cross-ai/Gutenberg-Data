  <h2><a id="book1"
     name="book1">BOOK ONE</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch101"
     name="ch101">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PIETRO waved his hand with a grand gesture. He leaned
against the rampart
  and pointed downwards. Many years spent in his profession as semi-mendicant
  guide had imbued him with a sense of possession in the treasures which he
  displayed.</p>

  <p>"Approach and behold, Signor and Signorina," he invited the two young
  people who were his temporary victims. "The parapet is strong. One may lean
  against it."</p>

  <p>"My God, what a climb!" the young man exclaimed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"But what a view!" his sister murmured.</p>

  <p>They were on the summit of the hill of Pellini. A few hundred feet below
  was the ancient hill town from which they had climbed, and all around them,
  like a sea in the fading light, one of the plains of central Italy; a hardly
  tilled land, sparse of vegetation but full of colour&mdash;a land of vineyard
  and olive trees; brown meadowland on which thin cattle were feeding. Pietro
  pointed to a shoulder of the hill immediately below them, on the far edge of
  which was a long grey-stone building&mdash;a building obviously
  ecclesiastical in character, approached by a long cypress-bordered drive, and
  with a familiar cross on the steep mound behind.</p>

  <p>"From this point, gracious Signorina and Signor," Pietro continued, "you
  may behold one of the most magnificent views in central Italy. If you will
  move to where I am standing and look down, you see first of all the famous
  Monastery of St. Joseph&mdash;a building which has been occupied without
  interruption by monks of the same order since fourteen hundred and
  seventy-two. Beyond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl interrupted him with a little gesture. She was a tourist, but she
  was not fond of guides.</p>

  <p>"No more historical facts, please," she begged. "I just want to look at
  the view."</p>

  <p>"Regular gas bag, this fellow," her brother grumbled, lighting a
  cigarette. "I had enough of him down in the town."</p>

  <p>The girl leaned the tips of her fingers upon the top of the rampart. She
  was tall and very beautiful. The slight air of listlessness which detracted
  occasionally from the charm of her expression had completely vanished. She
  was gazing out towards the horizon with a look of soft content in her clear
  brown eyes. Her lips were parted. She was still rather breathless.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see such colouring, Eustace?" she exclaimed. "Look at the
  saffron light behind the olive trees there, the blue mist in the distance,
  and those fingers of purple cloud!"</p>

  <p>Her brother gazed complacently around.</p>

  <p>"Jolly fine building that monastery, too," he remarked. "Seems in a bit
  better repair than most of them. I bet there are trout in that stream," he
  added, leaning a little farther over to watch the clear torrent below.</p>

  <p>Pietro, who had been inclined to sulk, recovered himself. After all, they
  were of the nobility and very wealthy&mdash;this beautiful young woman and
  her brother.</p>

  <p>He had overheard their chauffeur's conversation in the courtyard of the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"I tell you all about these things, gracious lady and Signor, if you letta
  me," he reminded them gently. "The Hill of Calvary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl interrupted him again, more firmly than ever this time.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," she insisted. "If we want to know anything, we will ask
  questions. Listen!"</p>

  <p>From behind the grey walls below there stole upwards the most marvellously
  blended music in the world&mdash; the music of men's voices singing to the
  strains of a great organ. The melody rose and fell and died away. The girl
  listened, entranced.</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens that women haven't voices like that," she exclaimed. "I
  might be tempted to enter a nunnery."</p>

  <p>"You letta me speak, and I tell you something interesting," Pietro
  proposed.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead then," the young man assented.</p>

  <p>"Twice a year," Pietro confided, "novices are admitted to the monastery.
  The night before they spend in prayer&mdash;here, upon this rampart."</p>

  <p>"Why here?" the girl enquired.</p>

  <p>"This is the boundary of the town," Pietro explained. "Beyond the wall,
  all the land that you can see belongs to the monastery. The novice, he prays
  here upon the borderland. At sunrise the monks come up by that winding path
  and fetch him. They open that gate in the wall there and he passes through.
  Tonight is one of the nights."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that there will be novices praying here to-night?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Francis will come from the city below," Pietro announced. "He has been
  long making up his mind, but they say that he will come."</p>

  <p>"And who is Francis?"</p>

  <p>"He is an orphan. His mother had a little villa in the bend of the hills.
  Now she is dead and Francis has come to live in the city. They say that his
  father was English."</p>

  <p>The girl listened for a moment and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Here come the rest of them!" she exclaimed. "Sir Stephen and mother
  between them are driving me crazy with their passion for dates and
  archaeology. Let's climb up to the top of the hill, Eustace."</p>

  <p>Her brother shook his head. He had the air of an athlete but he was
  scarcely in the best of condition. His cheeks were puffy and his forehead was
  damp.</p>

  <p>"Not another yard, Monica," he declared. "I'm not in form for these Alpine
  feats. I shall go back to the town and see if I can find an interesting cafe.
  There's a promising one just outside the garage. You can come down with the
  others."</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" she scoffed. "You desert a view like this for sweet vermouth and
  a pair of black eyes! I saw her looking at you over the muslin blinds. A
  happy adventure to you! I'm off!"</p>

  <p>She turned to follow a footpath on the opposite side of the road. Her
  brother sauntered towards the little group who had just appeared around the
  bend: an elderly gentleman of severely aristocratic appearance, a
  comfortable-looking lady, very much out of breath, and a middle-aged,
  fussy-looking man in a grey Norfolk coat and knickerbockers, grey worsted
  stockings and thick shoes. Each of the newcomers was true to type. The
  gentleman who affected the costume of a hardy pedestrian was Sir Stephen
  Dobelle, head of the firm of Dobelle, Miles &amp; Dobelle, solicitors of
  Lincoln's Inn, and his two companions were Henry, eighth Duke of Chatfield
  and Susan his wife. Pietro hastened towards them, hat in hand.</p>

  <p>"The noble lady has done well to give herself the fatigue of climbing," he
  declared. "From the ramparts here is the most extensive view of middle Italy.
  On the right behold the Monastery of St. Joseph. Note well the Calvary
  behind. It has been called the most beautiful in the world."</p>

  <p>The Duchess leaned against one of the buttresses and fanned herself
  vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me about the view, my good man, for a few minutes!" she
  exclaimed. "I'm terribly out of breath! Henry, I shall have to let a doctor
  examine my heart directly we get back."</p>

  <p>"It would be as well, my dear," he conceded.</p>

  <p>The two men walked to the edge of the ramparts and gazed downwards.</p>

  <p>"The fellow's right! It's a damned fine view," Sir Stephen announced.</p>

  <p>"Quite a panorama," the Duke acquiesced graciously. "By the bye, Dobelle,"
  he went on, after a moment's pause, "I have been wondering why the name of
  this place seemed so familiar. Wasn't it round in these
  parts&mdash;er&mdash;er"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Sir Stephen interrupted. "It was somewhere in this locality
  that your brother, the late i Duke, sought romance and grew olives with a
  beautiful Italian lady. I had letters from him often bearing this
  postmark."</p>

  <p>"One feels almost an intruder to have blundered upon the spot," the Duke
  murmured.</p>

  <p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The lady died a short time before your brother," he observed. "There was
  some small property here, I believe, but we thought.it best in the interests
  of the family to make no enquiries. The estate could spare it."</p>

  <p>The Duchess had risen from her stony seat and came towards them.</p>

  <p>"I must get away from this man," she declared. "Can't some one stop him?
  He is boring me to death."</p>

  <p>"Dear Duchess, you cannot stop him," Sir Stephen rejoined. "It's the only
  way an Italian ever works ? with his tongue. He's paid to tell us all about
  this place, and he'll do it whether we listen or not."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see why I should be the only victim," she complained.</p>

  <p>The word offended Pietro&mdash;or perhaps he thought simulated offence the
  easiest way to the pocket of these wealthy English.</p>

  <p>"Victim!" he repeated. "The signora is unkind. You not like me tell you
  about the place?"</p>

  <p>"Your services in leading us to this spot were appreciated and will be
  remunerated," Sir Stephen promised. "Now that we are here, however, your job
  is finished."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Pietro replied with dignity. "I say no more. I would have
  spoken of Francis. You shall not hear of him."</p>

  <p>The Duchess turned away.</p>

  <p>"I feel that Francis would be the last straw," she confessed. "Give me
  your arm, Henry. I have had enough of sight-seeing. I think that I shall rest
  for an hour or so before dinner. By the bye, where is Monica?"</p>

  <p>"On the rocks, there," Sir Stephen answered, pointing upwards, "scrambling
  about like a young goat. I'll wait for her."</p>

  <p>"Don't let her stay too long," her mother enjoined. "There's quite a cold
  wind already, and it will be dark in half an hour. Call to her if she doesn't
  come down."</p>

  <p>"I will.&mdash;Here, Pietro!"</p>

  <p>Pietro, who had started to follow his retreating patrons, retraced his
  steps. The lawyer waited until the other two were out of earshot.</p>

  <p>"What about this Francis?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"He come here to-night to pray," the guide confided. "At dawn the door
  there will open and he will pass down the path."</p>

  <p>"To the monastery?"</p>

  <p>"To the life that is death."</p>

  <p>His questioner scratched his chin meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Pietro," he enquired, "why did you think that we should be
  interested in Francis?"</p>

  <p>Pietro shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, " Francis is English like you, and," pointing after
  the descending figures, "tall like him."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>Pietro shrugged his shoulders once more. He was impatient to follow his
  patrons.</p>

  <p>"What more should there be, Signor?"</p>

  <p>He slunk off. The lawyer turned round and gazed thoughtfully across the
  plain. It was curious that a breakdown to one of the cars should have delayed
  them at this particular place. Once or twice during the last few years he had
  half decided to make some enquiries&mdash; and yet, what was the use? From
  the fact that his late client had left behind him no instructions, it became
  manifest what his wishes were. And yet in the lawyer's mind there had always
  been that slight feeling of uneasiness. He brooded upon the matter until he
  was suddenly conscious that there were dark patches of semi-obscurity
  hovering over the landscape, that shadows seemed to be crawling down from the
  hills, and that above him a star had appeared. He looked up to the rocks to
  call for Lady Monica and found a young man standing a few feet away, gazing
  at him enquiringly&mdash;a young man, tall and slight, with black hair,
  unusual features and scowling expression. Sir Stephen stared at him, entirely
  bereft of words. The coming of this intruder was without a doubt a shock.</p>

  <p>"It is late for sight-seers," the latter pointed out coldly. "You had
  better descend or you may lose your way."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen recovered himself.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me your name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The question is impertinent but I will answer it if it will rid me of
  your presence sooner. My name is Francis and I came here to be alone."</p>

  <p>"Your other name?"</p>

  <p>"I have none."</p>

  <p>"But you are English," his questioner persisted. "You must have another
  name."</p>

  <p>The scowl on the other's face deepened into passion. His eyes&mdash;cold
  grey eyes they were&mdash;flashed.</p>

  <p>"I am not English," he declared.</p>

  <p>"But my dear fellow"</p>

  <p>"You are making yourself very offensive," the young man interrupted. "I
  beg that you will leave me alone. This night is not my own."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen had recovered his composure. To him the occasion had become a
  serious one.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he pointed out, "if what they tell me is true, this is
  the last night you can call your own. I wish to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"Say what you have to say, and go then," was the curt admonition.</p>

  <p>"I wish to speak to you of your father," the lawyer announced. "You see, I
  know quite well who you are. I knew your father when he was your age."</p>

  <p>To a casual observer the anger seemed to have passed from the young man's
  face. His expression had become tense and drawn. There was still, however,
  the fever in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I should advise you," he said, " to hold your peace. You have reminded me
  that I am still of the earth&mdash;a layman and free to do as I will. If I
  thought that you were a friend of my father, do you know what I should be
  tempted to do?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"To throw you over the ramparts. You see that corner. There is a sheer
  fall of three hundred feet there."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen was no coward. He remained absolutely unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Is that the spirit which you are going to take with you down there?" he
  asked, pointing to the monastery.</p>

  <p>"It is the spirit which was born with me," was the measured reply. "I seek
  refuge there because if I remain outside those walls I shall commit a
  crime."</p>

  <p>The lawyer had lost all his mannerisms. He was a kind-hearted man and he
  was deeply interested.</p>

  <p>"Francis," he said, "if what I suspect is true, you are one of those
  unfortunate children of the world who have been wronged by their parents. But
  remember they are not always to be blamed."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the young man asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"There were reasons at least why your father should have hesitated to
  marry a peasant girl."</p>

  <p>"My mother was not a peasant girl. She was noble, although her father
  tilled his own land. In England you make nobles of the richest of your
  shopkeepers and men of commerce.&mdash;You see that I am controlling myself,
  but if you continue to talk to me in this strain please come a little farther
  away from the edge of the rampart."</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid," Sir Stephen assured him. "We have met by accident and I
  am going to say what I feel that it is my duty to say to you. Why you were
  left poor and unrecognised I do not know, but at least I can promise you that
  it was never your father's intention. Every man expects to be able to send a
  message or add a codicil to his will on his deathbed. Your father died in the
  hunting field, without a moment's warning. I know what his wish would have
  been and I am here to carry it into effect, if possible. Give up the idea of
  this living death. His relatives shall see that you are well provided for. I
  pledge my word to it."</p>

  <p>The young man closed his eyes. He remained silent for a few moments. When
  he opened them his voice shook a little.</p>

  <p>"This is not hesitation," he explained. "I am obliged to pray for your
  sake. Every word you say makes the blood hot in my veins and sets my hand
  twitching for a weapon. My fingers should wither before they touched a penny
  of charity from my father's people."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen was disturbed. He felt that he was making no headway; that he
  was a poor advocate. His case was surely a good one, and yet in this young
  man's presence his brain seemed clouded.</p>

  <p>"Francis," he went on, "your father was weak sometimes. He was never
  wicked. I was his lawyer, his executor&mdash;I might almost say, his
  confidential friend. I am perfectly certain that if he had lived you would
  have found yourself committed to my care. Cannot you accept the situation in
  that way? It is a terrible thing for a young man like you to cut yourself off
  from life. You know what you will find&mdash;down there."</p>

  <p>"Peace," was the gloomy reply.</p>

  <p>"Peace at your age!" Sir Stephen scoffed. "You are too young to make up
  your mind on such a subject. Give the world at least a trial. You can trust
  me."</p>

  <p>"I trust no one of your speech. Let me show you this."</p>

  <p>He drew from the loose pocket of his coat a fifteenth-century weapon in a
  quaint metal sheath, which he slowly displayed&mdash;a very ugly line of
  quivering blue steel.</p>

  <p>"I've seen hundreds of them in the curio shops," the lawyer remarked.
  "Very interesting, but why carry it about with you?"</p>

  <p>"I bought it," the young man confided, "to plunge it into the heart of the
  first person who ever spoke to me of my father in friendly fashion."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen was a little annoyed. The young man's speech seemed to him to
  have introduced a needless tone of melodrama into an already sufficiently
  difficult situation. He pushed the dagger on one side impatiently.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he protested, "this is the language of the past. You
  must have some common sense somewhere. I want you to bring it into our
  conversation."</p>

  <p>"Past or present, it is the only tongue I speak," was the steady reply.
  "If you choose to make a murderer of me you can do so. Then it will be I who
  will take that three hundred feet drop from the ramparts. I can assure you
  that I am quite indifferent." Sir Stephen had a great deal more to say, but
  he remained dumb. He was a man of instincts, notwithstanding his legal
  training, and he suddenly realised that this strange young man was in deadly
  earnest. He even saw the twitch of his fingers, read the growing purpose in
  his brain. He turned away.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said. "You are making a great mistake."</p>

  <p>Francis made no reply. He stood listening for some time to the reluctantly
  retreating footsteps. Then he fell on his knees with his arms folded upon the
  rampart wall. Below, the harsh tinkling of a bell was summoning the
  brown-robed toilers from their work on the land.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch102"
     name="ch102">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONICA, descending the rocks with light and graceful
footsteps, broke off
  in her song and peered downwards. Pietro stood in the road.</p>

  <p>"The gracious signorina should hurry with me to the hotel," he enjoined.
  "The signor who promised to wait for her forgot. He sent me here. Behold, I
  have run all the way."</p>

  <p>Monica reached the road with a final spring.</p>

  <p>"Why should one hurry, Pietro?" she asked carelessly. "This twilight is
  gorgeous. I have been watching the lights come out on the plain." "It is not
  safe to be here at this hour," the guide assured her, looking nervously
  around.</p>

  <p>"Not safe?" she repeated, wonderingly. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"There are thieves who dwell in the hills above, ? thieves who come out
  only in the darkness."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" Monica scoffed. "I'm not afraid of thieves. Hurry on down if
  you're afraid, Pietro. I want to watch these lights from the ramparts. Every
  moment a new one flashes out; a little point of fire being pushed through a
  purple cloak. Goodness gracious! Who's that?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to where the figure of Francis was dimly visible. Pietro
  crossed himself fervently.</p>

  <p>"Behold the Englishman," he whispered. "It is his night of prayer and
  fasting. At dawn they will open the gates of the monastery to him. He will be
  a holy man."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that he is English?" Monica queried.</p>

  <p>"His father was English. His mother was the daughter of a vine grower in
  the valley.&mdash;Signorina," he went on, "I beseech you to hurry. It is not
  well to be here."</p>

  <p>Monica found the situation, as well as the environment, interesting.</p>

  <p>"An Englishman," she repeated. "Pietro, I think I will speak to him. He
  must be mad to think of burying himself for life&mdash;a young man, too."
  Pietro was genuinely shocked. These English might be wealthy but they were
  without sentiment&mdash;worse, they were sacrilegious.</p>

  <p>"Signorina," he urged, "you must not disturb him at his prayers."</p>

  <p>Monica laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Why not? He will have plenty of time to pray later on. I believe you are
  thinking of those thieves all the time, Pietro. Go on, if you're afraid. I
  will catch you up presently."</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid, but there are most certainly thieves in the
  neighbourhood," he mumbled. "I will take a glass of vermouth at the corner
  cafe. It is almost within sight. The signorina will not delay."</p>

  <p>He hurried off. Monica glanced after him for a moment contemptuously. Then
  she moved under the shelter of a little clump of olive trees. At first she
  contented herself with gazing at the panorama below. Then she began to hum to
  herself, finally to sing. The light of mischief crept into her eyes. Her
  voice was not powerful but she knew how to make it thrilling. She sang of
  love&mdash;love, pagan, but beautiful. At the further end of the rampart, out
  of sight now, in the gathering darkness, the young man prayed.</p>

  <p>Monica broke off in her song, disturbed by the sound of shuffling
  footsteps. She stared at the two men who had apparently appeared out of
  nowhere. She found the contemplation entirely unpleasant. They were dirty,
  distinctly of villainous appearance, and they smelled horribly of garlic.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>They had apparently no time to explain. Her hands were already seized. She
  felt rude fingers at the fastening of her pearl necklace.</p>

  <p>"Help!" she cried.</p>

  <p>The monosyllable was all that was permitted to her. It was enough,
  however. She was still struggling against the supreme indignity of the brown
  fingers holding together her lips, when help came. She had a sudden vision of
  one of her assailants rolling over and over in the dust&mdash;she heard the
  thud of bone against flesh as the other staggered backwards, with his hands
  to his face. There was the glimmer of steel; then a yell of agony as her
  rescuer seized the robber's wrist. A moment later a gleam of light flashed in
  the pool of darkness as the dagger was thrown over the rampart. The two men
  were crawling up the rocks like rats.</p>

  <p>"Have they taken anything?" Francis asked quickly. Monica felt her neck
  and wrists.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," she replied. "Please don't follow them. I should hate to
  be left here alone."</p>

  <p>The young man drew back a step or two.</p>

  <p>"There is no longer any occasion for fear," he assured her. "You had
  better return at once to your hotel."</p>

  <p>Monica looked doubtfully along the road. It seemed to have grown darker
  during the last few minutes.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't walk down with me, could you?" she suggested with a smile
  which would have turned the heads of a great many young men who were
  bemoaning her absence in London.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>It was a curt, distinctly a rude monosyllable. Monica, however, ignored
  its implied reproof.</p>

  <p>"Why not? My father would like so much to thank you, and it is dark, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I have&mdash;occupation here," he replied. "Pietro is awaiting you at the
  bend of the road. You will be quite safe thus far."</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the edge of the rampart.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if I stay here," she said, "Pietro will come."</p>

  <p>"It is time that you returned to your friends," he declared coldly. "You
  may not know it, but you are breaking the unwritten law of the place. These
  few yards are consecrate to me and my purpose."</p>

  <p>Monica nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that," she admitted. "There's plenty of time,
  though, isn't there? I should like to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Signorina, I have nothing to say," he rejoined, a little wearily. "My
  conversations with my fellow creatures are passed. I beg you to leave
  me."</p>

  <p>Monica pointed downwards to where the outline of the monastery was now
  scarcely distinguishable.</p>

  <p>"Is it true that you are going there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he assented. "Your presence here interferes with my
  devotions. These are my last hours before peace comes."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that you will find peace there?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"I hope. No one can do more."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him steadfastly as one seeking for understanding.</p>

  <p>"But why do you seek peace?" she demanded. "You, a young man whose life
  lies all before you? Peace is the last goal of those who have fought and
  suffered, those for whom the end is at hand."</p>

  <p>"Signorina," he urged, "I beg that you will leave me."</p>

  <p>She took a cigarette from her little gold case, tapped it against the
  stone and coolly lit it. He watched her with displeased but fascinated
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I disobey," she told him, "it is because I feel kindly towards you.
  You have shown that you are brave. You are a man. You are not like those
  shadowy abstractions down there&mdash;ghostlike creatures, with water in
  their veins for blood and a palsy upon their limbs. Surely it is a sin for
  one young and vigorous like you to desert before the trumpet call is
  sounded."</p>

  <p>"Signorina, you speak with great ignorance," he as* sured her. "What do
  you know of my life and sufferings? I have lived for twenty-two years. Look
  at me. Is there no sorrow in my face?"</p>

  <p>"You look as though you had had trouble," she admitted. "But trouble at
  your age should pass. You are English and you have done me a great service.
  My father would wish, I am sure, to thank you. Between us we might be able to
  suggest a more reasonable vocation for you."</p>

  <p>"Signorina," he protested, "I do not wish to leave this place. I do not
  wish to walk for one yard by your side. I do not wish to meet your father.
  The time passes, and it passes ill for me. I beg that you will go."</p>

  <p>"You're terribly obstinate," Monica sighed.</p>

  <p>"I seem obstinate," he retorted, "because it pleases you to argue with me
  when you know nothing of my life or motive. I take orders to save myself from
  sin, but if it pleases you to know it, know this&mdash;that I shall carry
  down that path with me into my cell a passion which lives, and will live with
  me day and night; a passion which in this world has turned my life into a
  burning fever. It will take all the prayers of my empty days, all the
  holiness I can possibly find there, to cool the lust of anger which is in my
  heart."</p>

  <p>"You have suffered some great wrong?" she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Another has suffered it," he answered. "I am her son."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she acknowledged gently. "Believe me, I am very sorry for
  you indeed, and yet&mdash;listen. What happiness will you gain down there,
  brooding, praying and wrestling with shadows? Have you never thought of the
  joy of life?"</p>

  <p>"Joy?" he repeated doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she demanded. "Joy is the heritage of youth. Didn't you hear me
  singing to you just now?"</p>

  <p>"I heard a song," he replied harshly. "It disturbed my prayers."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward. In the purple twilight her face seemed more
  than ever beautiful and alluring. There was a promise of passion in her
  compelling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe that you will hear the echoes of that song down there
  behind those grey walls as long as you are young and strong?" she persisted.
  "Do you think that you can close your ears to it? Why should you? It isn't a
  sin to be happy."</p>

  <p>"Where in this world should I find happiness?" he asked bitterly.</p>

  <p>She moved closer towards him. There was indeed something almost siren-like
  in her expression, half pleading, half mocking, yet with a foundation of
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>"From one of us," she whispered. "We were born to bring it to you. Why not
  come out into the world and seek the most wonderful thing in life?"</p>

  <p>"The most wonderful thing in life?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Love," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Pagan love," he retorted fiercely. "I think that the devil must have
  brought you here to-night, of all nights."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly. Was it possible that victory was coming her way, after
  all?</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that it was a very comfortable Rolls-Royce. Something
  went wrong with the magneto of my brother's two-seater so we had to spend the
  night here. Are you glad?"</p>

  <p>"No," he declared fiercely.</p>

  <p>"You should be. And I am not in the least a pagan. If I were, I should not
  be so sorry for those poor men down there who fancy that they can reach
  holiness by flying from temptation. I didn't think that sane people even
  considered such a thing nowadays." He looked moodily downwards.</p>

  <p>"I go there," he told her, "for a different reason. I go there because if
  I live in the world I shall commit murder."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not your business," he answered coolly.</p>

  <p>Monica learned then how much noise Pietro could make when he was no longer
  afraid. He came rushing up the hill, followed by two Italian policemen. He
  waved a thick stick in his hand and his ejaculations were bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>"The signorina is safe, then?" he cried. "Oh, how I have rushed to her
  aid. Which way did the thieves go?"</p>

  <p>Monica looked at him with distaste.</p>

  <p>"I really did not notice. All I know is that they would have had my
  jewellery if it had not been for this young gentleman."</p>

  <p>"The scoundrels!" Pietro exclaimed. "Down there, whilst I was waiting, I
  fancied that I heard a cry. I rushed to where these two policemen were
  stationed. We tore up the hill."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Monica remarked sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Since you are here, however, you can wait and escort me back."</p>

  <p>She moved nearer to Francis. He had fallen once more on his knees and was
  murmuring a prayer to himself.</p>

  <p>"Please listen to me," she begged.</p>

  <p>He remained like a statue. His eyes were fast closed, the words came
  breathlessly from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>He took no notice. The policemen, talking together angrily, pushed Pietro
  towards her. They made the sign of the cross.</p>

  <p>"Gracious Signorina," the latter remonstrated. "He is now a man apart. He
  should not be disturbed."</p>

  <p>"It is very sad," Monica murmured.</p>

  <p>"Come away, Signorina," Pietro insisted. "My companions here, who helped
  to rescue you, will interfere if you do not. He must be left to himself. All
  through the night he stays like that. It is the custom of centuries."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"With the dawn the gates of the monastery are opened. The fathers
  themselves will come and fetch him. The devout will watch from the city
  walls."</p>

  <p>Monica turned sadly away.</p>

  <p>"It is a great tragedy," she sighed.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch103"
     name="ch103">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONICA was conscious, during those few hours spent at the
quaint little
  Italian hill town, of a curious feeling of isolation, of removal from any
  form of sympathetic contact with any one of her companions. She seemed
  suddenly to be breathing a different atmosphere, to be almost passionately
  anxious to escape from the humdrum conversation of the table, from the
  tourist-like proclivities of her mother who insisted upon buying picture
  postcards, and her father and Sir Stephen who wandered out to find a decent
  cafe. Dinner itself was a curious meal, served in a large, chilly-looking
  apartment, with a stone floor and bare walls. There was a long table in the
  middle of the room at which were gathered a sprinkling of tradespeople,
  commercial travellers, and wine growers. Monica and her party occupied one of
  the side tables, of which there were several. Next to them three priests ate
  with garrulous content; farther on were two or three Americans, and in the
  corner an artist and his wife. As the meal progressed the smell of the food
  and the heat of the closed stove became almost insufferable, and, as soon as
  she could, Monica made her escape into the little courtyard, with its queer
  pieces of statuary and cracked tiles. Up above was a wonderful pool of deep
  blue sky, with an amazing setting of stars, and in the middle of the square
  was an orange tree, whose fragrance made the stagnant air almost faint. On
  the other side of the wall was a row of dark cypress trees&mdash;black
  pencils against the clear sky. Monica lit a cigarette and sat upon a stone
  seat. Presently Eustace came out and joined her.</p>

  <p>"The car's all right," he announced. "We're going to start at nine
  o'clock. Let's stroll round and have a look at the place."</p>

  <p>Monica followed him gladly enough out into the street. Again she felt that
  curious sense of isolation which had crept over her at dinner time. Every
  shutter was closed. The city with its narrow streets and tall grey-stone
  houses was like a city of the dead. Even Eustace seemed a creature from
  another world.</p>

  <p>"Rummy old place to be stranded at," he observed. "Might have been worse,
  though. The beds are all right, and the dinner wasn't bad."</p>

  <p>"How about the lady at the cafe?" she enquired. Eustace groaned.</p>

  <p>"Terrible!" he admitted. "These foreign places are all the same. They
  promise you no end and give you nothing. She was fat, had yellow teeth and
  couldn't speak a word of English. Think I shall turn in early. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder what's become of the people?" she speculated. "They can't go to
  bed so early as this."</p>

  <p>"Making merry behind closed doors and blinds, I expect," he remarked. "You
  can see light through the chinks of many of these shutters. There's music
  going on at some of the places, too. Jolly inhospitable, I call it."</p>

  <p>Monica stopped short. On their left was a narrow passageway with a
  descending flight of stone steps&mdash;a passageway which seemed like a gash
  cloven through the mass of incongruous grey-stone buildings. At the far end
  was a strange little segment of panorama&mdash;a glimpse of the lights, few
  and far between, in the valley below. It seemed as though from the end of the
  passage one stepped off into a pool of space.</p>

  <p>"That must lead to the city wall, Eustace. Let's go," she suggested.</p>

  <p>He followed her lazily. The way was longer than it seemed, unlit and
  gloomy. At the end, however, they were rewarded. They ascended a few
  unexpected and remarkably steep steps and were on the ramparts.</p>

  <p>"It's like leaning over the side of an airship," Monica declared.</p>

  <p>"It makes me giddy," Eustace grumbled.</p>

  <p>"If only there were a moon," she sighed, looking doubtfully into the great
  gulf below.</p>

  <p>Where vision was denied her, however, sound intervened. From the quaint
  little cathedral which they had visited earlier in the day came the sound of
  the chiming of the hour, of a musical peal of time-mellowed bells. The notes
  had scarcely died away when, from farther off, came the harsh clanging of the
  monastery bell. Monica leaned forward eagerly. There were a few faint lights
  burning there. Above must be the hill. Was he still praying, she wondered,
  the solitary figure she had left battling with his misery? What were his
  thoughts? Had he really faith enough to believe that salvation in this world
  at any rate could come from the inertia of life? To what heights had he
  raised himself during these hours? Men had told her that the sound of her
  voice and the sight of her were hard things to forget. She had willed that he
  should find it so. Had she succeeded&mdash;ever so little?</p>

  <p>"Let's be moving," Eustace suggested, yawning. They made their way back
  through the slumbering city. Monica found a sleepy woman to show her to her
  room&mdash;a large, strangely empty apartment, into whose further recesses
  the fluttering illumination of the solitary candle could scarcely penetrate.
  The walls were of light-coloured but ancient wood, pierced here and there
  with worm-holes. In the far corner was a small shrine, a roughly executed
  wooden image of the Virgin. Monica gazed at it for some moments thoughtfully.
  The sight of it seemed somehow to complete her unsettlement. She lay down at
  last and tried to sleep. For an hour or so, perhaps, she dosed. Then she was
  as wide awake as though it were midday. The room was in pitch darkness, but
  through the open window opposite she could see the glimmering of a single
  street lamp. She stretched out her hand and lit the candle. By degrees the
  various objects in the room began to assume their natural shapes. As she lay
  there, the sense of isolation seemed to come back to her with renewed
  conviction. She felt as though, without warning, she had arrived at a break
  in her life&mdash;a break as abrupt and complete as the fall from that little
  flight of stone steps in the town into the sleeping gulf below. She seemed to
  look back a long distance, even to recent events. Her presentation at Court,
  her first ball, her life of easy luxury, almost splendour, punctuated by one
  or two very one-sided love affairs. There was no man in her life of whom she
  found herself even able to think. The larger, more vital problems of
  existence had scarcely even presented themselves to her. They loomed up
  suddenly in that silent hour&mdash;problems of life and death, of right-doing
  and wrong-doing. She had no past but there was a future, which seemed to her
  at that moment almost menacing. Was life meant to be taken seriously&mdash;
  as anything but a game? If so, not only she but every one of her kind was
  walking in the darkness. Beyond that light which she could see from her
  pillow, somewhere a little higher up, Francis must still be praying on the
  ramparts. His was a madman's device to escape the problems of life, but a
  sense of the mistaken spirituality of it suddenly seized her. This poor fool
  had something which she had missed&mdash;saw greater things in his narrow
  dreams than had ever come to her. She loved luxury, fine clothing, beautiful
  surroundings, and easy ways. What had she as a corrective? she, or the
  others? Nothing? Four o'clock chimed from the Cathedral bells. Already the
  darkness outside was less intense. Suddenly, as it seemed to her, without
  volition, certainly without any attempt at making up her mind, she sprang out
  of bed and began to dress. It was the first time in her life that she had
  ever risen in such a way, but she accepted it entirely as a matter of course.
  She twisted her thick coils of brown hair into their place with nervous
  fingers. Without knowing why, she felt that she was in a hurry. She stole
  down the stone stairs on tiptoe, tried one door after another, until she
  found one unlocked, then stole into the street. She had almost to grope her
  way out of the town. As she began to climb, however, she found the darkness
  had gone. A new twilight seemed to envelop her&mdash;a twilight of grey and
  silver. Birds were singing in all the trees. Eastwards there was a lightening
  in the sky&mdash;the dawn even of colour. A finger of faint pink grew wider
  as she watched. She hastened on. A peasant's cart met her on its way into the
  town, full of vegetables and country produce. The man in charge raised
  himself from his recumbent position to gaze at her in amazement as she passed
  by. There was a line of green now underneath the pink and a thin clear shaft
  of saffron beneath that. She quickened her pace. This was the dawn coming.
  She feared that she might be too late ? for what? . . . Everything seemed as
  she had left it when she reached the little lone fragment of the ramparts.
  The young man was still on his knees, recumbent, a shapeless mass with his
  black cloak around him. She moved swiftly to his side and stood there for a
  moment. The murmur of words ceased from his lips. He looked up&mdash;saw her
  and struggled to his feet. There were lines under his eyes. His night's vigil
  seemed to have aged him.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"All through the night," she told him, "I have lain sleepless. I could not
  get you out of my thoughts. I felt that I must speak to you once more before
  it was too late."</p>

  <p>"Why should you think of me?" he demanded. "We are strangers."</p>

  <p>"No two people in this world are strangers," she pleaded. "We are fellow
  creatures following a common way. I have done nothing but think since I left
  you. Last night I spoke too lightly. I reasoned foolishly. This
  morning&mdash;listen&mdash;I am as serious as you."</p>

  <p>"You spoke to me of love and the joys of living," he muttered. "I want
  none of them."</p>

  <p>"I was wrong," she admitted. "It is not for the sake of pleasure alone
  that I want you to turn your back upon that gate. I am very ignorant and I
  know that I am the wrong person to plead with you, but you know, they say
  sometimes that children see the light where their elders fail. I want to
  remind you that every human being is born into the world with a purpose. He
  has his battle to fight in life, his work to accomplish, his place to take
  amongst his fellows. Life down there is an abstraction and a shadow. There is
  nothing noble about it. You avoid evil but you reject the good. I would have
  you take up the burden of your life, whatever it may be, and live it in the
  sight of all men. That is how one may reach holiness."</p>

  <p>She ceased, breathless. Her thoughts travelled so swiftly that time seemed
  to stand still. It was the most serious moment she had ever experienced. She
  felt her heart beating madly. He himself was moved in some way. His face was
  upturned. His eyes still avoided her, but his lips were quivering. Eastwards
  the sky now had become a bank of glory. She sought for words, passionately
  conscious of his hesitation. Then the silence in the valley below was broken.
  As though a door had been opened and a flood of melody released, there came
  to them the roll of an organ, the far-off sound of men's voices chanting a
  prayer. There was a change in the young man's face. He listened intently. His
  lips moved to the music. Somehow or other she found her breath again. Words
  came to her.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she pleaded, "that is the music to help your footsteps when you
  pass across the borderline from life to death. It isn't meant for the solace
  of those whose work is undone. Listen, I am not tempting you. I am not
  begging you to turn away from that gate to seek the easier ways of pleasure
  and idleness. I ask you&mdash;I implore you&mdash;to Come and do a man's work
  in the world and earn the peace which comes with accomplishment. The path you
  choose now is the path of cowards. The music to which you listen is a
  narcotic for the soul."</p>

  <p>Still he made no answer. The music drew nearer and nearer. The monks were
  ascending the hill. Behind, a little line of peasants' carts were passing.
  The men and women crossed themselves as they looked towards Francis and
  scowled at Monica. None of them lingered, however. All the time Francis
  watched the gate. There was terror in his eyes&mdash;terror and frantic hope.
  The first shaft of quivering sunlight stole down upon his suddenly aged face.
  Monica realised that with the passing of the night his lips were sealed. She
  spoke again but this time hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"Francis, can't you forget that I am a woman? It isn't my voice that calls
  you. It isn't my arm that would draw you away. It's duty, Francis. There is
  no life for a man beyond that gate."</p>

  <p>The voices now seemed to be close at hand, on the other side of the wall.
  The chant ended in a little burst of solemn but glorious melody. Slowly the
  iron gate was opened by some unseen hand. The voices died away. There was a
  deep silence. Francis, with a gesture which might almost have been of
  despair, turned towards the open portal. Once more she cried out. This time
  her voice was more natural and more human.</p>

  <p>"Francis, turn round!" she implored. "If you won't stay for duty's sake,
  stay for mine. Francis!"</p>

  <p>He came to a standstill. He was still a yard from the gates. Monica tried
  to call out once more, but there was a sob in her throat. The singing
  recommenced, softly at first, as though from the throats of boys. Her eyes
  were blurred with tears. She dashed them away. In that moment Francis had
  disappeared. The gate was closed. Once more the chant swelled in
  volume&mdash;louder and louder and more triumphant it grew. As Monica
  listened her face hardened. She moved forward to the edge of the ramparts and
  looked downwards. She watched the little procession of monks threading their
  way down the precipitous path, Francis walking alone, behind. She watched
  them, dry-eyed, but with a surge of curious emotion, unanalysable even by
  herself. Only she knew that some vital possibility seemed to have dropped out
  of her life, that she had stepped back, a little bruised and scarred, from an
  experience which was still inexplicable to her, to the ways of a life which,
  in a sense, would never seem the same again.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch104"
     name="ch104">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SO far as a nobleman of ancient lineage, excellent breeding
and sufficient
  understanding could be said to be a snob, Henry Duke of Chatfield was a snob
  as regards his own relations and the relations of his family with Royalty. He
  spent a very pleasant few minutes in his study one fine April morning some
  three years after his tour amongst the hill towns of Italy, turning over the
  pages of the Toiler and studying photographs of his daughter Monica attended
  by an obviously devoted princeling. There had been paragraphs in the daily
  papers too, hints in various society columns. The whole thing was exceedingly
  flattering. Monica could scarcely have chosen a more fortunate moment for her
  descent upon him.</p>

  <p>"Busy, Dad, or can I have a word with you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Never too busy, my dear, to see you," he assured her, rising and resting
  his hand upon the back of a chair. "You are riding this morning, I see," he
  added with a glance at her habit.</p>

  <p>She nodded, threw herself into the easy-chair, crossed her legs and lit a
  cigarette. In any one else the attitude and action taken in conjunction would
  have seemed a little risky. Lady Monica, however, was fast establishing a law
  of her own.</p>

  <p>"Dad," she said, "I'm awfully sorry, but I want some money."</p>

  <p>In a way this was rather a shock. Eighty thousand a year with four large
  houses to keep up, tenants to propitiate, and an extravagant son, is by no
  means an enormous income. The Duke, however, was a philosopher, and he was
  intensely proud of his daughter.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, if you want it, you must have it," he replied. "Clothes, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Clothes and gambling," she admitted coolly. "One must amuse oneself."</p>

  <p>He winced.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that the gambling is worth while," he remarked. "I know it
  can't be avoided now and then, and personally I see no harm in it, although
  it doesn't happen to be one of my vices. I'd leave it out as much as I could,
  though. An unmarried girl can't possibly compete with the people she may run
  up against."</p>

  <p>Monica assented languidly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I just play when I feel like it. I'd prefer to dance, only all the
  men worth spending an hour or two with dance so badly. A thousand will do,
  Dad. My allowance will be due next month, won't it?"</p>

  <p>The Duke produced his cheque-book with some reluctance. He made out the
  cheque, however, and passed it across.</p>

  <p>"There you are, my dear," he said. "Make it last as long as you can. Whom
  are you riding with this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I forget," she confessed. "Some young man is calling for me
  presently."</p>

  <p>He stood looking down at her. Amongst those human weaknesses which he
  permitted to disturb the prim regularity of his life, was a distinct
  affection for his daughter.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that you're looking well, Monica," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Entirely a mental indisposition," she assured him. "I'm bored."</p>

  <p>"That's queer," he reflected. "Why?"</p>

  <p>She made no immediate reply. He shrugged his shoulders as he returned to
  his seat.</p>

  <p>"Every paper I pick up," he continued, "tells me that you are the most
  popular young woman in society. You take the lead wherever you go. You dabble
  in philanthropy, in sport, even in politics. There isn't a paper that doesn't
  proclaim you the reigning beauty amongst the younger set. I really can't see
  how you find time to be bored."</p>

  <p>"Nor can I," she admitted. "But I am."</p>

  <p>"You've tried most things," he went on. "There would appear to be only one
  new experience left for you in life."</p>

  <p>"Marriage, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. She sat with her face to the window and with
  the full warmth of the spring sunshine around her. Her father's heart glowed
  with pride. In all the forty-seven oil paintings of his female ancestry in
  Chatfield House and Chatfield Castle there was no woman whose beauty could
  compare with hers.</p>

  <p>"Marriage is, I am afraid, where I come to grief," she confessed. "I can't
  face it, Dad."</p>

  <p>"That's strange," he murmured. "You seem, if I may say so, a perfectly
  normal person."</p>

  <p>"I think I am on every other subject," she assented. "I've started no end
  of new crazes. I'm supposed to be absolutely up to date in most things. But,
  between you and me, Dad, I'm hopelessly old-fashioned about marriage. I've
  tried to consider it in connection with several of the men who've asked me,
  and it seems like a hideous impropriety. I've been reading Jane Austen and I
  know exactly why. There must be a right man and I haven't met him."</p>

  <p>The Duke coughed. It seemed a delicate matter to discuss even with one's
  own daughter.</p>

  <p>"Your sex, my dear," he observed, "is generally capable of great
  adaptability in this matter. If a man presents himself who is in every way
  desirable, it is astonishing how soon the average young woman can discover
  the existence for him of that remarkable feeling which the novelists are
  accustomed to call love."</p>

  <p>"I know, Dad," Monica agreed, "but I'm not an average young woman. I know,
  because I've tried. I let a young man kiss me last night, to see if that
  would help things along. Absolutely horrible, the sensation! I was very
  disappointed and very rude about it. Besides rubbing all the carmine off my
  lips!"</p>

  <p>The Duke sighed. He guessed at the identity of the young man.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," he said, "your mother and I are in no hurry to lose you.
  There are certain connections which would gratify us very much. But that, I
  think, you know. You must take your own time, however. You realise, of
  course, that spinsterhood is a most impossible condition?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"It sha'n't be as bad as that, Dad, I promise you."</p>

  <p>The butler knocked at the door and entered, announcing the arrival of
  Monica's illustrious escort. She rose to her feet, gathered up her skirt,
  threw a kiss at her father and left the room. Her mother joined him and they
  stood at the window watching her start.</p>

  <p>"How much did Monica want this time?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"A thousand," was the gloomy reply. "I had to give it to her, of course.
  All the same, I wish she'd marry. Won't you sit down, my dear?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess seated herself in Monica's vacated chair.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't stay," she declared. "I've a great many things to do. Mrs.
  Marsham has just brought me the books. They're more than ever this month.
  You'll have to pay in something extra to the housekeeping account."</p>

  <p>"Damn the housekeeping account!" the Duke exclaimed testily.</p>

  <p>"People must be paid," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well, overdraw then," he advised. "Monica's cleared me out for a week or
  so. Upon my word, I wish she'd marry."</p>

  <p>"I can't think why she doesn't," the Duchess complained. "Most unnatural,
  I call it."</p>

  <p>"I have just had some conversation with her upon the subject," he
  confided. "I must confess that she surprised me very much. I should never
  have considered Monica a sentimentalist."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," her mother reflected, " whether you have noticed any change in
  Monica since our tour abroad three years ago."</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I have particularly," he confessed. "What sort of
  change?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess hesitated.</p>

  <p>"A very difficult change to put into words. It was when she returned to
  England or during the next season, perhaps, that she attained her greatest
  success. She seemed to have developed gifts which surprised me&mdash;an
  amazing capacity for leading people, for doing the most daring things in an
  entirely irreproachable manner,&mdash;and yet she appeared to have lost
  something. I don't know how to express it, Henry, but I always fancy that
  there has been a certain hardness about her since that time. She is far more
  indifferent, for instance, as to the feelings of her admirers."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about hardness," the Duke objected; "she was talking what,
  in any one else, would have seemed sentimental twaddle just before you came
  in."</p>

  <p>"I know," his wife sighed. "I only hope that when her Prince Charming does
  come along, he won't be an opera singer or a professional cricketer!
  Underneath her coldness Monica has the most amazing temperament."</p>

  <p>"Let us," the Duke suggested, "not meet trouble halfway. I see," he added,
  looking out of the window, "that Sir Stephen is here. He has asked for an
  interview this morning."</p>

  <p>"I hope none of the tenants are going to be troublesome," she remarked, as
  she rose to her feet. He looked for a moment almost severe.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, " they can be as troublesome as they like. I wouldn't
  even discuss the matter of another shilling off their rents. What Eustace and
  I are talking about is cutting the entail and selling the Yorkshire property.
  There is no house. It doesn't go with the other land. And wherever there
  isn't a house the tenants give trouble."</p>

  <p>"A little ready money would be a wonderful thing," the Duchess confessed,
  as she moved towards the door. &mdash;"How do you do, Sir Stephen," she went
  on, meeting him on the threshold. "Stay and have some luncheon with us, if
  you're not in a hurry this morning. You can take Henry for a little walk in
  the Park first. I tell him he'll lose his figure if he doesn't take more
  exercise."</p>

  <p>"You're very kind, Duchess," the lawyer replied. "I'm afraid I shall have
  to go on to the City this morning."</p>

  <p>"Well, any time you like. We're generally in for luncheon. Henry prefers
  to dine out but to lunch in. It's his nap afterwards he thinks about."</p>

  <p>She departed, closing the door behind her. The Duke invited his visitor to
  take an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, Dobelle," he declared. "Your coming has probably saved
  me a journey down into the City. I wanted to talk to you about our
  proposition&mdash; selling the Yorkshire property, you know. Eustace is all
  for it."</p>

  <p>"I think you'll have to put the idea out of your mind," was the grave
  reply. "I&mdash;the fact is, Duke, I am afraid I am bringing you very bad
  news."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you are! Don't tell me that my Norfolk people are expecting
  another reduction. It simply can't be done."</p>

  <p>"My business is far more serious," the lawyer pronounced. "Can you bear a
  shock?"</p>

  <p>The Duke was more perplexed than alarmed. He could think of no possible
  impending calamity.</p>

  <p>"Out with it!" he enjoined.</p>

  <p>"The Yorkshire estates are not yours to dispose of&mdash;or the Norfolk
  ones, or any of the Chatfield property. Francis married that Italian girl in
  Rome and had a son. The son is living at the present moment."</p>

  <p>The Duke gripped the sides of his chair. The situation was too big for
  him. He failed to grasp it.</p>

  <p>"A son! Francis married!" he exclaimed. "Ridiculous! Why, if that were
  true, Dobelle, the young man would be Duke of Chatfield!"</p>

  <p>"He is," the lawyer affirmed solemnly.</p>

  <p>"And what am I?" the Duke gasped.</p>

  <p>"Just what you were before, Lord Henry Wobury, uncle of the Duke, and I
  regret to say, without any settled income."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the bewildered man exclaimed. "We're disinherited
  then!"</p>

  <p>"I regret to say that such is the case," the lawyer assented.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch105"
     name="ch105">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the whole, Lord Henry bore the blow well. He rang the
bell for a pint
  of champagne, most of which he was compelled to drink himself, as the lawyer
  deprecated any form of alcoholic refreshment before lunch time. Then he asked
  a great many questions.</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly how you discovered this?"</p>

  <p>"It was during a spring cleaning at the office," Sir Stephen explained.
  "In destroying a lot of worthless papers belonging to the late Duke, we came
  across several packets of paid cheques returned from the bank. One of these
  was made out to the chaplain of the English Church in Rome. Pinned to it was
  a letter, promising attendance for the purpose of performing some ceremony at
  a certain hour. I did not wish to disturb you unnecessarily so I said nothing
  about it, but went out to Rome myself. The marriage was in the register and
  there was also a record of the christening of a boy. I subsequently visited
  Pellini and had an interview with the Superior of the monastery and with the
  young man, Francis."</p>

  <p>"I always knew there was something wrong about that infernal place," Lord
  Henry groaned. "Susan was saying only this morning that Monica hasn't been
  the same girl since we got back from there."</p>

  <p>"I had the utmost difficulty with the young man," Sir Stephen continued
  thoughtfully. "At first he absolutely refused to listen to me. Eventually,
  however, he handed over a box of papers left by his mother. They contained a
  copy of the marriage certificate, birth certificate, and additional evidence
  which I can only assure you is overwhelming. Even then I found the young
  man's attitude extraordinary. He seemed to take the slightest possible
  interest in the fact that his father and mother had been legally married, and
  the realisation of his own position left him absolutely unmoved."</p>

  <p>"He had better stay where he is then," Lord Henry commented.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what at first he proposed to do. However, I pointed out
  to him where his duty lay and I also pointed out the fact that, whether he
  returned or not, the estates would have to be administered in his name.
  Finally the Father Superior got hold of him, and very quickly ended the
  matter. A Roman Catholic Peer of England was too great an asset to be
  disregarded. The young man has practically received orders to quit. A special
  dispensation signed by the Pope will release him from his vows before many
  months have passed. I have promised then to go over and fetch him."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a fellow is he?" Lord Henry enquired.</p>

  <p>"The image of his father in appearance," Sir Stephen confided. "I
  recognized him directly I saw him on the ramparts at Pellini, the night we
  were there, but I hadn't, of course, the faintest idea that there had ever
  been any marriage. I talked to him as his late father's friend. I must admit
  that I came away feeling that he was better in the monastery than out of
  it."</p>

  <p>"What about his disposition&mdash;towards us, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"That will undergo a change, without a doubt, under these altered
  circumstances. I should imagine that his mother was an unhappy
  woman&mdash;very much neglected by your brother, who we know was not a
  particularly&mdash; er&mdash;considerate person. The young man has been
  brought up in the belief&mdash;or, of course, he may have imbibed it
  himself&mdash;that both she and he were deeply wronged. He has a violent
  disposition&mdash;some of his mother's Italian blood in him, I should
  think,&mdash;and he seems to have nourished almost a hatred against his
  father and his father's family. That, however, will I am sure be modified if
  it does not altogether disappear under existing circumstances."</p>

  <p>"A pleasant lookout for us," Lord Henry observed gloomily.</p>

  <p>"You may rely upon it," Sir Stephen promised, "that every scrap of
  influence I possess will be used to make this young man take a sane view of
  the situation."</p>

  <p>"And supposing he doesn't, how do we stand?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen frowned.</p>

  <p>"You wish me to be quite frank?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"You would be penniless. You will remember that your late brother made you
  an allowance of some four thousand a year. That, however, was purely
  voluntary. The Chatfield estates have neither jointures nor settlements.
  Everything has always been voluntary. Shall I go on?"</p>

  <p>"If there is anything worse to be said, pray don't omit it," Lord Henry
  enjoined bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I am speaking now from an entirely legal point of view," Sir Stephen
  continued. "The income from the estates which you have drawn and spent
  constitutes a debt to the new owner. Furthermore, you have realised on
  certain outlying portions of the property and spent the money. This also is a
  debt. I need hardly say," he went on, "that I shall urge upon this young man
  as strongly as possible that it is his duty to make you an adequate allowance
  and that any restitution of what has been spent under a misapprehension is
  quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"In plain words, we are paupers!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is the long and short of it," the lawyer agreed. "It is
  a terribly unfortunate situation. I need scarcely say that you have my most
  profound sympathy, both you and your family. It is particularly hard, too,
  upon the younger people."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do until this young man arrives?" Lord Henry demanded.</p>

  <p>"Go on just as you are," the lawyer advised. "I was coming to that
  directly. Nothing is to be disturbed until he arrives."</p>

  <p>"I hope to God he won't hurry, then!" Lord Henry exclaimed fervently.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen took his leave, after a few more words of sympathy. His
  distinguished client sat for several minutes in his chair without moving. His
  thoughts were chaotic. He was utterly unable to realise this thing which had
  happened. Presently he rose to his feet and made his way out into the hall.
  Attentive servants ministered at once to his wants. A silk hat and a tall
  grey hat were presented for his choice; gloves and a stick were pressed into
  his hand. He passed down the broad steps, between the stately pillars of the
  great house, on to the pavement, and took his usual leisurely stroll into the
  Park. Here he selected a chair in a remote position and sat gazing at the
  crowd. There was something symbolic in the ostracism which he had voluntarily
  embraced. He was no longer one of them. He was an outsider, a looker-on at
  the pleasant little game of life at which for so many years he had dealt the
  cards, cut and shuffled and dealt again. He saw his friends pass in the
  distance without greeting them, imagined their amazement when they heard the
  news, the thrill of interest, the careless word of sympathy, the swift
  forgetfulness. He was one of the first noblemen of his country. He had played
  his part conventionally, if without marked distinction. He had gambled a
  little, dissipated a little, dabbled in philanthropy, taken a grave but not
  overzealous interest in politics. He had few friends, scarcely a single
  enemy. He had liked to consider himself one of the old order, had presented a
  stiff front to the great stream of invaders, unless some personal and
  immediate good was to be had by extending the hand of patronage. He saw the
  truth very clearly that morning, and he knew quite well that it would be
  possible for him to slip out of his place without being missed for even
  twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>But Monica! That was where the rub came in. Selfish he might be to the
  core as regarded himself ? even as regarded his wife and Eustace&mdash;but
  when it came to Monica he was a different man. It was not only his pride in
  her: there was something underneath that&mdash;something less
  personal&mdash;something of real affection. The first great pang which this
  strange news had brought him was when he had thought of his daughter, had
  seen her drop out of the life which seemed now to revolve around her, had
  imagined others taking her place, her admirers dissipated, her name left out
  of the papers, her pictures from the illustrated Press. What on earth was to
  become of a girl like Monica without money? He brooded so long about her that
  it was only towards the end of the morning that he began to think about
  himself. By that time realisation was at work. He grew older as he sat upon
  his seat and looked beyond the Park into the future. After all, it had been a
  fine thing to be a Duke, to be master of those wonderful houses, to sit at
  the head of the table in the banqueting hall at Chatfield Castle, to receive
  the homage of his tenants and the smaller country gentry, to be allowed place
  in the hunting field, place in the House of Lords, place even in the anteroom
  of palaces. After fifteen years these things had become part of his
  existence. To live on, dethroned, stripped of his consequence, oppressed all
  the time by the burden of an inadequate income ? why, the very idea was a
  nightmare! There were luxuries which had become second nature to him,
  obligations, the non-fulfilment of which would be a humiliation. He shivered
  as the thoughts formed themselves more coherently in his brain. It was a new
  form of misery, this&mdash;something unheard of in the experience of any
  man&mdash;to have walked for all these years amongst the elect and now to
  slip back into the lower places. At the best, what had he to hope for? A few
  thousands a year, a Kensington residence, three or four servants, perhaps a
  cheap butler, cold mutton for luncheon, the made-up dishes of a second-rate
  cook for dinner. He reminded himself of sundry half-hearted excursions into
  the works of various philosophers, and in a crude sort of way he took his
  life to pieces and looked at it. It was the same from every point of view.
  There had been no motive in it anywhere, except to follow the daily
  curriculum of pleasure. Books had never attracted him; of art or science he
  knew nothing. Racing, shooting, and hunting&mdash;yes, under the most
  luxurious conditions possible. A flutter at cards or roulette and, by all
  means, now and then, an occasional Bohemian supper party&mdash;an expensive
  amusement and never to be talked about. Was there anything he could take with
  him&mdash;to Kensington? The question answered itself. At fifty-nine years of
  age, it was not possible to create a new world and fill it with new
  pleasures.&mdash;He abandoned his reflections at last and turned slowly
  homewards, feeling an older and a stricken man for that hour in the Park
  alone with his thoughts. It seemed to him that every one must notice the
  change. A Bishop whom he met at the gate gave him fresh food for
  reflection.</p>

  <p>"I hope, my dear Duke," that dignitary said, " that we shall see you in
  the House of Lords this afternoon. Lord Mountavon's bill for the
  redistribution of stipends in various dioceses is one that deserves your most
  serious attention."</p>

  <p>"I shall most certainly be there," Lord Henry promised gravely.</p>

  <p>He passed on his way with a grim smile. What was the penalty, he wondered,
  for having voted something like a hundred and fifty times in the House of
  Lords, without being a member of that august body. A fine, probably. There
  were so many unrepealed statutes of former days that perhaps imprisonment
  might follow. He ran into a celebrated judge at Stanhope Gate and
  condescendingly stopped him.</p>

  <p>"James," he asked, "do you know the penalty for voting in the House of
  Lords when you are not a member?"</p>

  <p>"Something on the Tower Hill with a chopper, I should imagine," was the
  light-hearted reply.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry went on his way, smiling. As he entered the house he saw some
  horses being led away and heard a male voice with Monica's in her own little
  sitting room. He entered the library, closed the door and took down the
  telephone&mdash;an instrument which he cordially detested and seldom used. In
  due course he reached the ear of Sir Stephen Dobelle.</p>

  <p>"Chatfield speaking, Sir Stephen."</p>

  <p>"Quite so."</p>

  <p>"Respecting the news which you sprung upon me this morning, I understood
  you to say that nothing need be changed for two or three months."</p>

  <p>"For two months, at least, probably three, possibly four."</p>

  <p>"No one else knows?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul."</p>

  <p>"Then I propose," Lord Henry continued, " to leave my family in ignorance,
  for say six weeks."</p>

  <p>There was a short hesitation.</p>

  <p>"If you think it wise," was the doubtful assent.</p>

  <p>"I can't see that it makes the least difference," Lord Henry declared.
  "They may just as well have another six weeks' happiness. You have no
  objection?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not."</p>

  <p>Lord Henry hung up the telephone and went up to luncheon. His guests found
  him in a most genial and pleasant mood.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch106"
     name="ch106">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE crowning event of a very brilliant season was, without
a doubt, the
  dinner party followed by a dance given by the reputed Duchess of Chatfield
  one night about two months later. Royalty, both foreign and domestic, graced
  both functions. Never was there a more wonderful gathering of beautiful women
  and distinguished men. Chatfield House had always been a favourite resort of
  the diplomatic set, and every Embassy seemed to have sent its quota of
  brilliantly uniformed and picturesquely attired guests. Lord Henry, occupied
  for hours in purely formal duties, found time now and then to watch his
  amazing daughter and join in the general tribute of admiration which she
  excited. Comparative strangers, as well as her own intimates, were raving
  about her. Her dress of white satin, although it was the creation of a great
  artist, was simplicity itself. She wore no ornament save the single rope of
  pearls which was one of the heirlooms of the family. Her hair was arranged
  without any trace of the coiffeur's art. It was Monica herself who was so
  amazing. The slight listlessness of a few months ago seemed to have passed.
  She had a smile for every one, a sparkling word, a laugh, an irresistible
  glance for each of her friends. She danced tirelessly with whoever asked her,
  showing no favour even to the most august of her partners. She had her
  moments, perhaps, but they were frankly taken. Once she was away from the
  ballroom for nearly half an hour and when she returned, without the partner
  who had escorted her, there was a transitory seriousness in her expression.
  It went, however, with her first dance. Even Eustace, who was not as a rule
  enthusiastic as to her charms, sought her out to offer his meed of
  appreciation.</p>

  <p>"Monica, you look ripping to-night," he declared. "There's a great gamble
  going on as to how many offers of marriage you've had within the last three
  hours."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I never advertise my scalps, Eustace," she confided.</p>

  <p>"One poor chap I know of has got it in the neck," Eustace remarked. "I saw
  him making for home and Mother as I crossed the hall. By the bye, has Dad
  asked you to come into the library when it's all over?"</p>

  <p>Monica nodded.</p>

  <p>"It sounds portentous, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds as though he wanted to get at us for something," Eustace agreed.
  "I expect we are squeezing him a bit between us."</p>

  <p>Monica shrugged her shoulders. A touch of recklessness had momentarily
  hardened her face.</p>

  <p>"If one lives, one must spend," she observed. "In any case, Eustace, I
  don't think it can be about money. This dinner and dance are more extravagant
  than anything we've done this season, and they're entirely his affair. My
  guess is that he's going to let Chatfield. I must go. There's a poor man
  waiting for me to dance with him."</p>

  <p>Towards three o'clock, the host found the ceremonial side of his duties
  over. Various august personages had departed. He looked about for a companion
  with whom to invade the buffet and discovered Sir Stephen standing in a
  corner, looking on with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"Watching me spend the other chap's money, eh?" Lord Henry observed with
  good-humoured sarcasm. "Never mind! Come and have a glass of the other
  fellow's wine. It's good. I can promise you that."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen accepted the invitation, but his demeanour was still
  gloomy.</p>

  <p>"I cannot pretend that I altogether approve of your entertainment, Lord
  Henry, wonderful though it has been," he declared.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, how illogical!" his host remonstrated. "Everything was to
  go on as before until your precious monk put in his appearance. Those were
  your own words. We always give one dinner and dance during the season. If I
  entertain at all, I must entertain as the Duke of Chatfield should. Now drink
  that Pommery. Nineteen hundred and four, every bottle of it. I thought you'd
  consider this rather a sporting wind-up."</p>

  <p>"A lawyer has often to forget that he is a sportsman," Sir Stephen
  rejoined drily.</p>

  <p>"Well, it isn't your show, anyway," Lord Henry reminded him. "When do you
  start for Italy?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You haven't heard from the young man?"</p>

  <p>"Not a line. I had a message from the Father Superior to say that the
  dispensation had arrived and that I should be welcome at the monastery next
  week."</p>

  <p>Lord Henry saw ghosts for a moment but he thrust them from him.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he announced.</p>

  <p>"I'm slipping away myself, in a moment," Sir Stephen confided. "I've had
  very little conversation with the young man as yet, as you know, but you may
  rely upon it&mdash;er&mdash;Lord Henry&mdash;that I shall do my best to make
  him see the situation reasonably. The only fear I have is that he nourishes
  some secret grudge against the family which he may be disposed to visit upon
  you all."</p>

  <p>"Hang it!" Lord Henry protested. "A chap who's lived in a monastery and
  who ought to be brimming over with religion, generosity,
  forgive-your-enemies, and that sort of thing. What's the good of burying
  yourself in one of those places if it doesn't make a holy man of you?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the lawyer agreed. "All I can say is that I hope he's changed
  since he went in. We shall find you down at Chatfield, sha'n't we?"</p>

  <p>"We're leaving for there next week," Lord Henry replied. "A pleasant
  journey to you."</p>

  <p>It was four o'clock before the last guest had left. Lord Henry made his
  way into the library. Supper had been prepared on a round table there and a
  magnum of champagne reposed in an ice-pail. A couple of servants were
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Open the wine and you can go," Lord Henry directed.</p>

  <p>They obeyed promptly. Presently Lady Susan came yawning in, followed by
  Eustace and Monica.</p>

  <p>"My dear Henry!" his wife protested. "Do you see the hour? It's very nice
  and thoughtful of you and all that, but what can you have to say that won't
  keep till the morning?"</p>

  <p>He smiled and held a chair for her. Then he filled the glasses with
  wine.</p>

  <p>"Monica and Eustace," he said, "I hope you've enjoyed the evening."</p>

  <p>"It has been wonderful, Dad," the former assured him. "I've enjoyed my own
  party better than any I've been to this year."</p>

  <p>"Ripping good show!" Eustace declared enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Still no news for us, Monica?" her father enquired.</p>

  <p>"Still no news, Dad," she answered. "It was touch and go to-night, but I
  wasn't quite desperate enough, thank heaven."</p>

  <p>They were seated in easy-chairs around the table. Lord Henry played with
  the stem of his wine-glass.</p>

  <p>"I have some news for you," he announced.</p>

  <p>"News?" Lady Susan repeated.</p>

  <p>"Good or bad?" Monica asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Bad," he answered.</p>

  <p>Eustace refilled his glass. They all three looked at their host.</p>

  <p>"Some money bother," Lady Susan concluded with a yawn.</p>

  <p>"He's going to let Chatfield," Monica thought.</p>

  <p>"He wants me to help him cut an entail," Eustace decided. "Hope I get
  something out of it."</p>

  <p>"My news is very bad indeed," Lord Henry pronounced. "We have been living
  for the last fifteen years in a fool's paradise, in another man's houses,
  spending another man's money. It appears that my brother Francis&mdash;your
  uncle, Monica&mdash;was married in Italy to the young woman with whom we knew
  that he had formed some connection. A son was born, whom, by a strange
  coincidence, Dobelle encountered on the night of his novitiate at Pellini.
  That son is the Duke of Chatfield. Dobelle leaves for Italy to-morrow to
  bring him home."</p>

  <p>The glass slipped from Eustace's fingers and went crashing on to the
  floor. Monica said not a word. Her hands were clasped in front of her; her
  eyes were gazing fixedly through the wall of the room. Lady Susan was no
  longer an ordinary-looking woman, inclined to corpulency. She rose from her
  place, came over to her husband, and laid her hand affectionately upon his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My dear Henry," she said. "This is bad for all of us, but it is cruel for
  you. I am very, very sorry."</p>

  <p>"I have seen him too," Monica murmured.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch107"
     name="ch107">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE momentous day had arrived. Lord Henry was standing upon
the hearthrug
  in the library at Chatfield Castle. Eustace was staring moodily out of the
  great curved window across the park. Lady Susan, very comfortable in her
  easy-chair, was busy knitting.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't be so damned industrious, Susan," her husband
  complained irritably. "It gets on my nerves to see you working away there as
  though nothing had happened or was likely to happen." She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Better accustom yourself to it, Henry. I may be doing it for a living
  next week."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>"The fellow can't be such a cur as to leave us alone altogether," Eustace
  declared, turning away from the window. "He is certain to make us suitable
  allowances."</p>

  <p>Lord Henry grunted.</p>

  <p>"Suitable allowances!" he repeated. "What can the son of an Italian
  farmer's daughter, who has spent the last three years in a monastery, know of
  suitable allowances to people in our position?"</p>

  <p>"He is also the son of your brother Francis," Lady Susan reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Francis was a crazy nincompoop or we shouldn't have been in this mess,"
  her husband grumbled.</p>

  <p>"I can't think what the fellow's got his knife into us all for," Eustace
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that he has, my dear?" his mother asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, if not, what does old Dobelle mean by saying in his letter to Dad
  this morning that we must be prepared to find him somewhat bitter?"</p>

  <p>"We couldn't help Francis keeping his marriage a secret," Lord Henry
  pointed out peevishly.</p>

  <p>"No one seems to have even known that there was a son," Eustace
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"And no one would have known," his father sighed, "if we hadn't taken old
  Dobelle with us on that accursed motor tour through Italy."</p>

  <p>"Even then, if he hadn't gone ferreting around, nothing need have
  happened," Eustace groaned. "This fellow would have stayed in the monastery
  all his life and no one would ever have heard of him."</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen did what I suppose he thought was his duty," Lady Susan
  observed, knitting steadily.</p>

  <p>"Duty!" her son exclaimed. "Meddlesome old ass! What about his duty to us?
  He's our family lawyer, isn't he? Look at the plight he's brought us to! And
  then he writes that we must be prepared to find him somewhat bitter! Seems to
  me we're the people who ought to feel bitter."</p>

  <p>"It's easy to be conscientious when it's the other chap who suffers," Lord
  Henry declared. "All the same, I don't think we ought to blame Dobelle."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," Eustace assented. "In any case we shall have to keep
  friends with him. He'll have more influence with this interloper than any
  one, I should think."</p>

  <p>"After all, you know, he isn't an interloper," Lady Susan remarked,
  holding up her work to the light. "We're the interlopers."</p>

  <p>"My dear Susan!" her husband protested.</p>

  <p>"Haven't we been living in his houses and spending his income for the last
  fifteen years?"</p>

  <p>"His income!" Lord Henry repeated.</p>

  <p>"His houses!" Eustace muttered.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul, Susan!" the former expostulated irritably. "I never
  heard such nonsense in my life."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's the truth," she rejoined equably. "And I should say that if
  you wanted to drive me to my little shop in Bond Street, you'll continue to
  ignore it as you are doing now. Do you suppose this young man won't resent
  all these years he's spent as a pauper, when he might have been Duke of
  Chatfield with eighty thousand a year?"</p>

  <p>"To hear you talk, Mother," Eustace grumbled, "one would imagine that you
  sympathised with him."</p>

  <p>"So I do, up to a certain point," Lady Susan agreed. "Anyhow, he's
  Francis's son, properly married and vouched for."</p>

  <p>"And Duke of Chatfield, damn him!" Eustace exclaimed. "He'll probably turn
  this place into a monastery, wear parson's kit and make a laughingstock of us
  all."</p>

  <p>The door was opened. They all looked quickly up. Monica entered, in her
  country riding habit, still a little breathless.</p>

  <p>"Any news of his Grace?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Should be here any moment now," Eustace replied, turning back to the
  window. "If you gallop that bay so hard, you'll come a 'purler' some day,
  Monica. This side of the park is full of rabbit holes.&mdash;No sign of him
  yet."</p>

  <p>"They were stopping the express at the junction," Lord Henry announced,
  glancing at his watch. "If the train's punctual he should be here in ten
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Monica threw her whip on to the couch, established herself in an
  easy-chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Genial reception he'll have, from the look of you all!" she observed.</p>

  <p>"I trust we shall receive him with dignity," her father rejoined coldly.
  "On the other hand, any affectation of pleasure would be ridiculous."</p>

  <p>Eustace suddenly became very much in earnest.</p>

  <p>"I call Monica's attitude in this matter simply callous," he declared.
  "You don't seem to realise what it means, Sis. Do you know that we haven't a
  house between us?"</p>

  <p>"Not a roof to sleep under," Lord Henry pointed out impressively.</p>

  <p>"And every shilling the estate produces is in entail," Eustace continued.
  "There are a few silly titles, but not a bob for any other member of the
  family except the titular head."</p>

  <p>"Not only that," Lord Henry went on, " but strictly speaking we owe this
  fellow about a million for money spent during the last fifteen years."</p>

  <p>Monica knocked the ash from her cigarette.</p>

  <p>"It does seem rather a mess," she acknowledged. "I think I shall have to
  put things straight for you by marrying him."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's rather curious silence. Her mother, for the first
  time, ceased to knit. Her father seemed engrossed in agreeable contemplation.
  Eustace scratched his chin and looked at his sister thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"No harm in being civil to the fellow anyhow, Monica," he suggested.
  "You're a damned good-looking girl. He might do a lot worse."</p>

  <p>"What a courtier this brother of mine is becoming," Monica observed
  ironically.</p>

  <p>"There is a little romance in the background already, isn't there?" her
  father enquired.</p>

  <p>"Rather!" Monica assented. "He drove off a couple of fierce-looking
  thieves who tried to rob me on the ramparts of Pellini."</p>

  <p>"The night I deserted," Eustace remarked.</p>

  <p>Monica nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, though," she confessed, "that he didn't show the least
  desire to improve upon the occasion. I got quite worked up trying to make a
  natural human being of him. He certainly looked at me once with an odd sort
  of glitter in his eyes," she went on ruminatively. "I sang him a little song
  about roses and passion in the midst of his prayers."</p>

  <p>"I expect," Lady Susan sighed, still knitting very fast, "that we shall
  find him a confirmed celibate."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Mummie. Keep cheerful!" Monica enjoined. "Don't mind my
  shattered hopes!"</p>

  <p>"Well, here's the car, anyhow," Eustace announced, turning away from the
  window. "We shall soon know what's in store for us. Buck up, everybody!"</p>

  <p>Monica rose to her feet and strolled across the room to an old-fashioned
  mirror.</p>

  <p>"The question is," she propounded, gazing at her reflection steadfastly,
  "whether, in the interests of the family, do I look my best in a habit, or do
  you think that I should make a greater impression in one of those fluffy
  negligee things with plenty of silk stockings showing. I've got one of the
  most improper creations you ever saw upstairs&mdash;all creation and no
  material."</p>

  <p>"I'm for the habit," Eustace declared. "You can treat him to the other
  sort of thing at dinner time. You look ripping as you are and besides, you
  haven't time to change. We need your moral support."</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps as well," Lord Henry said solemnly, "that every member of
  the family should be present when this young man arrives."</p>

  <p>They heard the car stop and the sound of footsteps in the hall. It was a
  moment full of peculiar significance to every one of them.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly damnable situation this!" Eustace exclaimed, walking restlessly
  back and forth.</p>

  <p>"Hideous!" his father agreed.</p>

  <p>"It will be all over in a few minutes," Lady Susan reminded them
  soothingly.</p>

  <p>"So like a dentist's antechamber," Monica murmured, retreating a little
  into the shadows.</p>

  <p>In due course the door was opened, and Johnson, the sixty-four-year-old
  butler, made his dread announcement with all the solemnity the occasion
  warranted.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen Dobelle&mdash;The Duke of Chatfield, your lordship."</p>

  <p>"Damn the fellow!" the ex-Duke muttered.</p>

  <p>"Filthy taste!" Eustace echoed.</p>

  <p>They all stood with their eyes fixed upon the door. Sir Stephen came
  bustling in, his deportment more volatile even than usual. Behind him came a
  tall, whitefaced young man, with high forehead, deep-set eyes, and fine,
  firmly set mouth. He was ill-dressed in a dark suit of foreign cut. He showed
  no signs of nervousness, interest, or courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Here we are, you see," Sir Stephen exclaimed. "A few minutes late.
  Nothing to speak of. My fault entirely, the announcement," he added, looking
  behind to be sure that Johnson had left the room. "Thought it best to get it
  over and done with. Chatfield, this is your uncle, Lord Henry Wobury, and
  your aunt, Lady Susan, and your cousins Monica and Eustace."</p>

  <p>With the exception of Monica, they all advanced a step or two towards him.
  Francis, without change of countenance, bowed very slightly to each. He
  seemed not to notice the outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>"We cannot pretend&mdash;er "&mdash;Lord Henry began&mdash;" er&mdash;that
  we are unfeignedly glad to see you, Francis, but at the same time as a
  relative and the eldest member of our House, I see no reason why we should
  not shake hands."</p>

  <p>The newcomer made no movement in response. There was an amazing aloofness
  about his bearing and his expression.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me, all of you," he begged calmly. "My life for the last
  few years has been one of complete isolation. In the monastery we did not
  shake hands. I have not yet acquired the habit."</p>

  <p>Monica came deliberately from the more secluded portion of the room. She
  held out her hand tentatively. Her lips parted in a faint smile. Her eyes
  looked into his.</p>

  <p>"You won't refuse me, will you, Cousin Francis? We are old friends and I
  have seen you use your hands in my service."</p>

  <p>He remained unmoved, frigid, almost discourteously unresponsive.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me for the present," he apologised stiffly. "Lay customs
  will no doubt come more easily to me in time."</p>

  <p>Monica indulged in a little grimace but she did not flinch.</p>

  <p>"If I had had my way," she reminded him, "you would have become accustomed
  to them by this time. I did my best to keep you out of the monastery. You
  remember?"</p>

  <p>Her voice had softened. To the others it seemed a magnificent piece of
  acting. Eustace, for instance, had never admired his sister more. There was
  not, however, even a flicker of change in the expression of the young man on
  whom she smiled.</p>

  <p>"I remember now that you talked to me on the ramparts on my probationary
  night," he admitted. "As soon as I had passed through the gates it was my
  duty to forget&mdash;and I forgot."</p>

  <p>"Even me?" Monica asked, with a ravishing note of appeal in her tone and a
  faint uplifting of the eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Even you," he answered deliberately.</p>

  <p>Monica remained where she stood for a moment, without speech or movement.
  Francis had the air of one waiting patiently in case she might have more to
  say. With a little shrug of the shoulders she abandoned the duel and, turning
  away, sank into an easy-chair. She had the feeling that she had offered
  herself as champion for the family and been worsted.</p>

  <p>"This dear cousin of ours has not come back to pay us compliments," she
  remarked, with some bitterness. "I think I liked you better, Francis, on the
  ramparts of Pellini."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen found it time to intervene.</p>

  <p>"Every allowance should be made, my dear Lady Monica," he insisted, "by
  all of you, for any slight peculiarity of outlook on the part of your cousin.
  You must remember that for the last few years he has been an absolute
  recluse. I was amazed when on my last visit to the monastery the daily
  routine was explained to me."</p>

  <p>Johnson made his noiseless reappearance, followed by a footman carrying a
  tea equipage. Even so obvious an interruption was a relief to every one.</p>

  <p>"You suffered many privations, I fear," Lord Henry remarked
  courteously.</p>

  <p>"Beastly grind that getting up at daybreak must have been," Eustace
  sympathised.</p>

  <p>"I can't think who did your mending," his mother reflected.</p>

  <p>"And washing," Monica added softly.</p>

  <p>"The life, I am sure, would not have appealed to any of you," Francis
  admitted in a tone which sounded almost harsh. "It was one, however, which I
  deliberately chose, and which I was for many reasons loath to abandon."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen nodded.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary how hard I found it to persuade him," he confided.</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause. The tea was set out. Johnson and his satellite
  left the room.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come and sit by me, Francis?" Lady Susan invited, making room
  by her side.</p>

  <p>He accepted the vacant seat with a slight bow.</p>

  <p>"I'm very proud of my tea," Lady Susan babbled on. "Orange Pekoe, selected
  leaves. I carry a small chest of it with me whenever I go on the continent
  nowadays. I remember quite well that at Pellini it was very much worse than
  at any other place. Terribly wishy-washy stuff I expect they gave you at the
  monastery."</p>

  <p>"We learnt there, I think, to forget our palates," he replied. "Whilst we
  are upon the subject, may I make a general request," he added, after a
  moment's pause. "You none of you, not even Sir Stephen, understand the
  conditions of life imposed upon and enjoyed by us in the place from which I
  have come. May I beg that in our future conversations it be not alluded
  to."</p>

  <p>"A very reasonable request," Lord Henry acquiesced. "It shall be as you
  wish."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, of course, Francis," his aunt agreed. "But I am sure
  that it was wishy-washy."</p>

  <p>"What a martinet you are," Monica sighed. "I was looking forward to
  hearing all sorts of thrilling details."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that you would have been disappointed," Francis replied.
  "My life at St. Joseph's was very simple and very rigorous. There could be
  nothing about its routine of interest to the general public."</p>

  <p>"So that's that," Monica whispered, with a little yawn, to her brother who
  was leaning over her chair.</p>

  <p>"Swallowed a ramrod," he murmured. "Let me take your cup."</p>

  <p>Lord Henry still pursued the path of duty. Francis had evidently no
  intention of originating any conversation.</p>

  <p>"It is early days, I suppose, Francis, to ask you what you think of
  England?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to live in it," was the quiet rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"You found London, no doubt, rather&mdash;er&mdash;depressing?"</p>

  <p>"Dead out of season, you must remember," Eustace put in. "Nothing doing
  after Goodwood. Flat as ditch water!"</p>

  <p>"I saw very little of London," Francis said patiently. "We arrived there
  late last night and it rained this morning."</p>

  <p>"But this place?" Monica asked. "Surely you must love this place?"</p>

  <p>"It seems very beautiful," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"The parts which you have not seen are more beautiful still," she told
  him. "I love the park, of course, and the trees are wonderful, but people
  come from all over England to see the castle. The keep is quite historical,
  and then there is the banqueting hall, the terraces on the south side and the
  sunken gardens. Really, I almost wish I were you, Francis," she went on
  reflectively. "You are going to see all these things for the first time and
  know that they belong to you. You couldn't appear a little more interested,
  could you?"</p>

  <p>Again her eyes challenged his smile. He looked across at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"If my attitude seems disappointing," he said, "I can only ask you to
  remember that I come from a life where emotion of any sort was a rare
  visitant."</p>

  <p>"Just so, just so!" Sir Stephen intervened. "You'll get over that. You'll
  relax a lot presently."</p>

  <p>"Rather!" Eustace exclaimed. "By Jove, I'd give something to be you,
  Cousin Francis! It's a pretty good world, you know, for a young fellow of
  your age with eighty thousand a year. What a lot you have to look forward
  to."</p>

  <p>"I may find the collection of new interests a matter of some difficulty,"
  Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not you," his uncle declared cheerfully. "That'll come all right. My
  dear," he added, turning to his wife, "if we have all finished, the servants
  might remove your tea equipage. I shall venture to ring the bell. It will be
  a great relief to us all to have our ? er&mdash;business conversation
  with&mdash;er&mdash;Francis."</p>

  <p>Lady Susan laid down her knitting and rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"While they are taking these things away, Francis," she said, " I must
  show you the view from the window here. We are very proud of the
  park&mdash;or rather we have been. There are no finer oaks in the kingdom
  than the Chatfield oaks."</p>

  <p>She walked to the window, and for the first time Francis unbent a little
  as he leaned to her side. Lord Henry buttonholed the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Seems a trifle unapproachable, eh?" he remarked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Inscrutable," Sir Stephen confessed.</p>

  <p>"Have you been able to form any idea at all as to his intentions?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. He has all the figures. I saw him studying them on the way
  down. He is a very difficult person to get to talk when he doesn't want
  to."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we are going to find him a very difficult person, anyhow,"
  Lord Henry sighed.</p>

  <p>The servants had left the room. Lord Henry cleared his throat. His wife,
  who recognised the signal, turned away from the window. Francis followed her
  lead. The long-expected moment had arrived.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch108"
     name="ch108">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I THINK, Francis," Lord Henry began, "that the time has
arrived for a few
  words of explanation as to the future."</p>

  <p>"Our future," Eustace interpolated.</p>

  <p>"Our mundane future," Monica murmured.</p>

  <p>"We find ourselves," their father continued, with a glance of disapproval
  at the interrupters, "in what I may term a unique position. A few months ago
  I, as the head of the house, was in receipt of an income of something like
  eighty thousand pounds a year. I have allowed Eustace five thousand pounds a
  year, my wife and daughter two thousand a year each, and the remainder of the
  income was absorbed in keeping up with due dignity this estate&mdash;the home
  of our family, Francis, for nearly seven hundred years&mdash;Chatfield House
  in London and Chatfield Lodge in Inverness. You are not in a position, of
  course, Francis, to realise what money means or what can be done with it, but
  I can assure you that the whole income from the estates has been spent by me
  in the manner indicated since my accession to the title. I am not saying a
  word against your father or your father's memory. He was considerate to us
  during his lifetime, for, as you may be aware, he made us a very reasonable
  allowance. That he should have placed us in this abominable dilemma, however,
  is, to say the least of it, inconsiderate. We are in the position, I gather,
  of having spent about a million of your money and of finding ourselves
  suddenly without a roof to our heads or a penny to bless ourselves with."</p>

  <p>"Not to speak of a few debts," Eustace groaned.</p>

  <p>Monica, from the depths of her easy-chair, intervened unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"There is just one other point of view, isn't there, Father? We have been
  having a jolly good time for four years with Francis's money, whilst he
  probably hasn't had a penny to bless himself with."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't our fault," Eustace declared.</p>

  <p>"It certainly wasn't his," Monica rejoined drily.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. The attention of every one present was
  focussed upon Francis. He stood with his back to the window, listening to
  them each in turn, his face the face of a sphinx. His continued silence began
  to create a feeling of uneasiness amongst the little circle. Sir Stephen
  judged that the time had come for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"If I may be allowed to intervene for a moment," he begged, clearing his
  throat vigorously, "I must confess that I have found his Grace somewhat
  uncommunicative as to his intentions, but I have taken the liberty of
  pointing out that the present situation is a little hard upon
  the&mdash;er&mdash;members of the family now present."</p>

  <p>"Damned hard!" Eustace exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Most unprecedented!" Lord Henry ventured. "A situation, I may say,
  without any precedent whatsoever."</p>

  <p>"I have taken the liberty of suggesting," Sir Stephen continued, "that a
  lenient view might be taken of the liability which you have unconsciously
  incurred, and that some sort of an allowance, such as was made by the late
  Duke, might be&mdash;er&mdash;revived under present conditions. The allowance
  made by your late father," he went on, turning to Francis, "was four thousand
  a year and the free use of the Dower House&mdash;the residence which we
  passed upon entering the park. There were also certain privileges regarding
  domestic service, gardeners, etc., which I need not enumerate."</p>

  <p>"We had the use of the dairy farm," Lady Susan said, looking up from her
  knitting.</p>

  <p>"And all the outlying shooting," Eustace put in.</p>

  <p>"Saddle horses, too, were at our disposal," Lord Henry remarked.</p>

  <p>Again they all looked anxiously at the silent figure in their midst. This
  prolonged silence was beginning to get on their nerves. Lord Henry made a
  direct appeal to him.</p>

  <p>"You will understand, I am sure, my dear Francis," he pointed out, " that
  our anxiety is great. It would perhaps be in order if you would acquaint us
  with your views."</p>

  <p>For the first time since the conference had commenced, the young man
  spoke, and the sound of his voice, hard and unsympathetic though it was, came
  as a relief to them all.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me for five minutes," he said, "I will discuss the
  matter with Sir Stephen, who shall acquaint you with my proposition. Sir
  Stephen, will you kindly accompany me out on the terrace?"</p>

  <p>Lord Henry was much disturbed at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow!" he protested. "This is your own room, your own house.
  Let us all leave you for a short time. Let us leave you here with Sir
  Stephen. You can send for us when you are prepared to make&mdash;
  er&mdash;any statement. Susan, my dear&mdash;Monica ? Eustace."</p>

  <p>"Stop, please," Francis interrupted, with a quick gesture. "I shall be
  glad of the air. Sir Stephen and I will walk upon the terrace. I see that
  these window* open."</p>

  <p>"Just as you please, of course," his uncle conceded. "You must notice the
  view, Francis, while you are there. A very wonderful view, every one
  considers it. We shall await your return here."</p>

  <p>The two men stepped out on to the terrace. Lord Henry closed the window
  after them. The family exchanged rather doubtful glances.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what he means to do for the mendicants?" Monica observed.</p>

  <p>"Can't say," Eustace rejoined gloomily. a I don't like the look of the
  fellow at all."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that, Eustace," his mother remonstrated, looking at him
  over her spectacles, and letting her knitting for a moment subside into her
  lap. "You must bear in mind that his life for the last few years must have
  been a frightful thing. Those poor monks never get enough to eat, and their
  amusements are naturally limited. I don't suppose they're even allowed out to
  go to a picture palace."</p>

  <p>"I remember that place we went over near Florence," Eustace reflected. "An
  old chap with a red beard read to them out of a prayer book while they ate
  their skilly, and afterwards they went to bed singing a hymn. Gad, if I were
  this fellow, I'd set things humming a bit!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he's not like you," Monica remarked drily. "He's bred in
  holiness and learned in self-restraint. From what I've seen of him, I should
  think that self-restraint is his strong point."</p>

  <p>"What I'm afraid of," her father declared, "is that he may want to use all
  the income founding some sort of a religious institution over here."</p>

  <p>"At the worst," Lady Susan sighed, " I can always take that little shop in
  Bond Street."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I could always get a job driving motor cars," Eustace suggested
  doubtfully. "Worst of it is, these Johnnies all want a premium nowadays
  before they'll even take you into their showrooms."</p>

  <p>"I must be good for something," Monica ruminated. "I don't know what. Wear
  dresses for Adele, perhaps. Or ride hunters for Haslock and get commission on
  the sales."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, if it comes to that," Lord Henry acknowledged drearily, "I
  could sell wines on commission. For my friends' sakes, I hope it
  won't!&mdash;Hullo! This looks bad. Dobelle coming back alone!"</p>

  <p>"Francis isn't going to face us," Eustace muttered.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen stepped through the high glass window and fastened it
  carefully behind him.</p>

  <p>"Where is our young relative?" Lord Henry asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"He has gone to his room for a time," the lawyer announced. "Let me put
  you all out of your anxiety. His suggestions for your welfare are
  marvellously generous&mdash;marvellously! I congratulate you all."</p>

  <p>"Generous! Good!" Lord Henry exclaimed in a tone of immense relief.</p>

  <p>"Fine fellow! Get on with it," Eustace begged.</p>

  <p>"Generous!" Monica murmured doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"The young man appears to take the broadest possible view of the
  situation," Sir Stephen confided. "He has, I must confess, completely
  surprised me. I fancied him entirely indifferent to any claims that society
  might have upon the House of Chatfield. I was altogether mistaken. He
  realises that for some time at any rate he himself will be unable to do
  anything to uphold the prestige of the family. He leaves that matter
  therefore in your hands. And he leaves you&mdash;well&mdash;very generous
  means with which to accomplish that end."</p>

  <p>"Generous! To what extent?" Lord Henry asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He proposes to allow you twenty thousand a year, in order that you may be
  able to keep up an establishment in town, with the free use of the Dower
  House here."</p>

  <p>"The man's a prince," Lord Henry declared with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Gad, he's a ripper," Eustace cried.</p>

  <p>"After all, I shall not need to open my little shop," Lady Susan
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it," Monica said simply.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" her brother demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm perfectly certain that he hates every one of us."</p>

  <p>"What an absurdity, Monica!" her father exclaimed severely.</p>

  <p>"Silly rot! Why should he?" Eustace scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Let us go and find him at once," Lord Henry suggested. "We should be
  prompt in expressing our gratitude."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen held out an admonishing hand.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he insisted. "There are two quite unimportant conditions attached
  to his generosity, although I must admit that they are strange ones. The
  first is that you all leave the Castle to-night."</p>

  <p>"To-night?" Lord Henry repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Why, we couldn't get packed," Lady Susan protested.</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't be able to wear my frills," Monica complained.</p>

  <p>"I beg of you to take this young man's whim seriously," Sir Stephen said.
  "He wishes to spend his first night here alone. There is no hardship whatever
  involved in the matter. The Dower House is probably prepared to receive you,
  according to my advice, or there are sufficient automobiles in the garage to
  take you up to town, if you prefer it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that it isn't a jolly good idea," Eustace declared. "We
  should all have felt rather poops with him sitting at the head of the
  table."</p>

  <p>"I might get up in time for Betty's dance to-night," Monica ruminated.</p>

  <p>"The young man must no doubt feel somewhat of an interloper," her father
  reflected. "His condition indicates a certain amount of proper feeling on his
  part. In any case we must see him for a moment or two and express our
  thanks."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Sir Stephen enjoined. "That is the second condition. He insists
  upon it that you refrain absolutely from any expression of gratitude."</p>

  <p>"Hateful young man!" Monica exclaimed. "He's too proud to be thanked, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"If I were you," the lawyer advised, "I would accept his conditions
  blindly for the moment. I must confess that I myself cannot follow the
  workings of his mind, but we must all remember that we have to do with a very
  exceptional personage who has lived a very exceptional life. I haven't the
  least doubt that as time progresses you will find him a very desirable and
  friendly head of the house."</p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with Sir Stephen," Lord Henry pronounced. "My dear
  Susan, Monica and Eustace," he went on, bowing to them each in turn, " I
  think that if we cannot express our gratitude to Francis, we can at least
  congratulate ourselves. The Dower House is a very comfortable little
  place&mdash;very comfortable, indeed&mdash;and the use of that with twenty
  thousand a year is a very princely arrangement. We must set about looking for
  a house in town at once."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we ought to feel grateful," Monica acknowledged. "I don't a
  bit."</p>

  <p>"And why not?" her father enquired.</p>

  <p>"For one thing, I don't like to be made to feel like a pauper," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd a jolly sight rather be made to feel like one than be one," her
  brother declared fervently. Sir Stephen glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Might I suggest," he ventured, "that you show some anxiety to fall in
  with our young host's whims? He will expect on his return to find you at
  least preparing to depart."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, quite right!" Lord Henry approved. "Now, who's for London
  and who's for the Dower House? The least we can do is to study this young
  man's wishes."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I'm so keen about that dance," Monica pondered. "It
  would be rather a scramble to get up to-night, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Dobelle?" Lord Henry enquired.</p>

  <p>"I think I'd better stay here," was the somewhat gloomy reply. "The young
  man wasn't in the least pressing about it but there is a great deal to be
  arranged."</p>

  <p>"Then I propose that we others all remain at the Dower House for
  to-night," Lord Henry suggested. "We can talk over our new prospects, and if
  Dobelle has anything more to say to us he can look in before he leaves
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I'm agreeable," Eustace assented. "I'd rather like to go over the old
  place."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen held open the door. They all passed out. On the further side
  of the great hall, Francis was standing, gazing up at one of the pictures. At
  the sound of their approach he turned away and, without looking round,
  disappeared into one of the distant rooms.</p>

  <p>"Quaint," Monica murmured, " but after all he made the rules."</p>

  <p>"And we're going to keep them," her father declared. "We'll be out of the
  house in a quarter of an hour, Dobelle."</p>

  <p>"Let us all carry our own bags and walk across the park," Monica
  suggested, with fine sarcasm. "What a film picture! 'Dispossessed!' The
  gloomy young Duke might be standing upon the terrace, watching us."</p>

  <p>"I shall certainly not walk," Lady Susan protested. "The grass will be
  much too wet after that last shower."</p>

  <p>Monica made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"We might draw you in a Bath chair to supply the last note of pathos."</p>

  <p>"I'm much too fat for a Bath chair," her mother objected.</p>

  <p>They had reached the first turn of the staircase. Monica turned round and
  waved her hand to Sir Stephen.</p>

  <p>"We're talking nonsense to hide our real feelings," she explained.
  "Eustace has gone to order a car and a cart for the luggage. It will make a
  more modern picture after all.&mdash;Sir Stephen!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica."</p>

  <p>She was leaning over the heavy oak banisters, looking downward.</p>

  <p>"Have you any influence with the film companies? Because if the twenty
  thousand a year doesn't pan out, I've decided upon my future vocation."</p>

  <p>"Financially," the lawyer began, with a warning gesture ?</p>

  <p>"And I hope you'll enjoy your tte--tte dinner with our benefactor," she
  concluded.</p>

  <p>She was suddenly conscious of the dark figure standing on the other side
  of the hall. Their eyes met for a moment. She kissed her hand lightly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Cousin Francis!" she called out. "We shall all be gone in ten
  minutes."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch109"
     name="ch109">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT EIGHT o'clock precisely Francis, Duke of Chatfield, left
his room and,
  descending the broad staircase which led into the hall, found Johnson
  awaiting him there and Sir Stephen a little in the background.</p>

  <p>"Dinner is served, your Grace, in the banqueting hall," the former
  announced, "if you will be so kind as to follow me."</p>

  <p>"We become sometimes the slaves of our dependents," Sir Stephen murmured,
  as he walked by his host's side. "Johnson is more than an ordinary servant
  here. He is the Master of Ceremonies. He has his own idea of what is right
  and wrong. I suggested dinner in the smaller dining room to-night but he
  would have none of it. I think that his idea is to impress you."</p>

  <p>If indeed that was Johnson's idea he was doomed to disappointment. Francis
  took his seat in the great high-backed oak chair at the head of the table
  which might easily have seated sixty people, without any sign of
  superabundant interest. He glanced around at the huge room and up at the
  vaulted ceiling almost indifferently. There was nothing in his manner to
  indicate his realisation of the fact that he was in one of the most
  magnificent dining rooms in England.</p>

  <p>"I have ventured to order the usual wines to be served," Sir Stephen
  announced a little dubiously. "You will find your cellars remarkably well
  stocked."</p>

  <p>Francis, to his companion's great relief, sipped his sherry and expressed
  his grave approval of the wine.</p>

  <p>"We made our own at Pellini," he observed, "but I do not think that we
  were very successful. The grapes in that district are rather hard."</p>

  <p>"Chatfield has always been famous for its wines," Sir Stephen confided.
  "Johnson is giving us some port afterwards which I think you will approve.
  I'm delighted to find that amongst the somewhat strict tenets of your late
  order abstention from wine is not practised."</p>

  <p>"In Italy, I believe," Francis replied, "everybody drinks wine, just as
  they eat fruit and smoke tobacco. These things are all good and are all
  allowed."</p>

  <p>An admirable dinner was served and partaken of almost in silence by the
  two men. Johnson, in supreme charge, remained all the time behind Francis's
  chair. There were other servants flitting about. Conversation of an intimate
  nature was impossible and minor subjects of discussion were hard to find.
  With the placing of great bowls of fruit upon the table, and the decanters of
  port and madeira, conditions, however, were altered. Even Johnson slipped
  away into the shadows. The two men were practically alone. It was Sir Stephen
  who directed the conversation into more intimate channels.</p>

  <p>"I'm not at all sure, Duke," he remarked, " that you did not do a very
  wise thing when you insisted upon this measure of solitude for your first
  evening here. I hope you will believe that as an old friend and adviser of
  the family I consider it a great privilege to be your companion on this
  occasion."</p>

  <p>"You are very good," was the murmured reply.</p>

  <p>"It is a romantic, almost an overpowering situation," the lawyer
  continued. "Here you are, twenty-five or twenty-six years old but as new to
  the world as any lad from Eton. You are practically starting life
  tonight&mdash;starting it too, as the head of one of our most ancient
  families with an immense income and a great name. Wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"Starting it a little late," Francis suggested. "At your age you have
  missed nothing," his companion declared. "You have the world at your
  feet."</p>

  <p>"Have you any suggestions to make with regard to my immediate future?" the
  young man enquired.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I have. That is why I am here."</p>

  <p>"Proceed then, if you please."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen helped himself to wine and adopted an attitude of greater
  ease, leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, you must take your seat in the House of Lords. Lord
  Grantley, Lady Susan's brother, will be proud to be your sponsor. Then I
  should advise your throwing open this place and entertaining. I gather that
  you are already a horseman. You must take lessons in golf and tennis and we
  must get old Amos, the head keeper here, to put you in the way of handling a
  gun. The Chatfield shooting is quite exceptional&mdash;you'll get a day from
  Royalty for certain. You must learn to drive a car too, of course, and we
  must find you a tailor. The suit of dinner clothes which I took the liberty
  of having put in your room, and which I am glad to see that you are wearing,
  I obtained by merely guessing at your measurements. They must be discarded as
  soon as you can be properly supplied."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer toyed with his wine-glass.</p>

  <p>"You must make up your mind on which side your political sympathies lie,"
  he went on. "The Chatfields have always been Tories but there is no reason
  why you shouldn't take a line of your own if it amuses you. In the House of
  Lords it won't make the slightest difference."</p>

  <p>Francis sipped his wine, carefully and appreciatively. His cheeks were
  still as pale as ever but the light in his eyes seemed, if anything, more
  brilliant.</p>

  <p>"You intend me, I perceive, to be a credit to the family," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason why you should not go far," Sir Stephen declared
  portentously. "Your early life and training have of course developed in you
  serious tastes, and you may, just at first, find the world rather an alarming
  place. That will, I am sure, wear off in time. Politics and philanthropy go
  well hand in hand and in these days of universal toleration your religion
  need be no drawback to your progress. There has seldom been a generation
  without a Chatfield in the Cabinet. Neither Lord Henry nor your cousin have
  shown the slightest inclination towards a career. I think I may say without
  offence, that they have not the brains. With you, it is different."</p>

  <p>"Is this flattery?" Francis asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"It is not intended as such," Sir Stephen assured him. "I simply want you
  to get a clear idea as to the possibilities of your future."</p>

  <p>Francis looked down the great length of the room. They were sitting in a
  pool of subdued light. Beyond, there were oases of space. The confines of the
  great apartment were only to be imagined. Even the pictures upon the walls
  passed into indefiniteness.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen," he said, " you are, I understand, the hereditary legal
  adviser of my family, and it is without a doubt owing to your efforts that my
  father's secret marriage in Rome was discovered and that I am here. I owe it
  to you, therefore, that there should be no misunderstanding between us."</p>

  <p>"I have the strongest possible desire," the lawyer declared, "to be not
  only your legal adviser but your friend and mentor in every other way, if you
  will allow me that privilege. There is nothing I should regret so much as the
  shadow of a misunderstanding between us."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Francis rejoined. "Please listen to me now. I have not
  the faintest ambition to add in any way to the glories of my family. I have
  other plans."</p>

  <p>"Plans?" Sir Stephen repeated dubiously. "You only landed in England
  yesterday. What plans can you have made?"</p>

  <p>"They were alive in my brain," Francis assured him coolly, "when the gates
  of the monastery swung open and I came back into the world. Did you ever
  believe that I came joyfully, Sir Stephen?"</p>

  <p>"You certainly didn't seem keen," the lawyer admitted. "Considering
  everything, you took a great deal of persuading."</p>

  <p>"You never persuaded me. Nothing that you said even counted. I have come
  here and assumed my father's name for an altogether different reason. That
  reason does not necessarily make for the honour and glory of the House of
  Chatfield."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen was bewildered. He leaned back in his chair and gazed in
  amazement at the young man who sat, unmoved and sphinxlike, at the head of
  the long table.</p>

  <p>"Are you by any chance a little overwrought?" he asked. "The
  journey&mdash;these new associations"</p>

  <p>"I am quite myself," Francis assured him.</p>

  <p>"It was only an hour or so ago," his guest observed, "that we were
  congratulating ourselves upon your broad-minded outlook. You have treated
  your relatives with the most amazing generosity. If you had chosen to consult
  me, I must confess that in your place I should have made some stipulation
  with regard to Lord Eustace. That young man ought to work. To make it
  possible for him to continue to lead an idle life is by no means an unmixed
  blessing."</p>

  <p>"We will pass over my generosity to these members of my family," Francis
  said, with a faint but bitter smile. "It may be that I have a reason for it.
  As regards that touching little sketch of my probable career, however, you
  can dismiss it wholly from your mind. The present head of the House of
  Chatfield is going to make a figure neither in politics nor philanthropy. I
  do not propose to take my seat in the House of Lords. I do not intend to
  associate myself with any social or religious work. I am going to leave that
  side of life alone for the present."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul! What on earth are you going to do, then?" Sir Stephen
  demanded, his whole expression a study in amazement.</p>

  <p>"They tell me that London is the gayest city in the world," Francis said
  coolly. "It is my desire to test the truth of that statement."</p>

  <p>The lawyer sat for several moments absolutely speechless. When at last he
  did speak, his words sounded inadequate.</p>

  <p>"I am very much surprised," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"For no particular reason, except that I had formed an altogether
  different estimate of your tastes."</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"It is very easy to be mistaken," he said. "I read in the <i>Review</i>
  which you lent me upon the steamer that the easiest way to come into touch
  with modern life is through its follies. It is my intention to test the truth
  of that statement also."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that, under those circumstances," Sir Stephen declared
  stiffly, "I can be of very little use to you. Eustace would make a more
  suitable guide."</p>

  <p>"The idea had already occurred to me," Francis admitted. "I sent word down
  to the Dower House some time ago that I should be glad to see my cousin after
  dinner if convenient."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen rose deliberately to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I sincerely trust, Duke," he said, "that you are not in earnest."</p>

  <p>"I am always in earnest," was the cold reply. Sir Stephen was thoroughly
  upset. He rested his hand for a moment on the young man's shoulder. There was
  nothing left in him of the timeserver. He spoke honestly and naturally.</p>

  <p>"Francis Chatfield," he began, "I am an elderly man, and you are a very
  young one. I have lived in the world and I know it. You have lived out of it
  and you know less of it probably than would be possible for any other man of
  your age. I am going to risk your anger by telling you that I don't like your
  outlook."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Francis murmured.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," the lawyer continued, "and I tell you that it isn't
  natural. At heart you are a serious person. You have principles. The little
  puddle here which they call 'the gay life' has no real attraction for you.
  There is something behind this purpose of yours. What is it?"</p>

  <p>The young man met the steadfast gaze of his would-be mentor without the
  slightest change of countenance. He showed no signs of anger, or even of
  impatience. There was, nevertheless, a dull finality about his words and
  manner.</p>

  <p>"You mean well, Sir Stephen," he said, "and I recognise your right to
  offer me advice. As it happens, however, I do not require it. I intend to
  live my life according to my own ideas. I offer to no man my confidence."</p>

  <p>"You won't even gratify my curiosity?" Sir Stephen persisted.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The great oak door in the distance had been opened, letting in a little
  flood of alien light. Johnson appeared, followed by Eustace.</p>

  <p>"Lord Eustace Wobury is here, your Grace," the butler announced.</p>

  <p>Francis rose to his feet and pointed to a place by his side.</p>

  <p>"Set a chair for his Lordship and bring another wine-glass," he directed.
  "It is very good of you, Eustace, to come across.&mdash;You really mean to
  leave us, Sir Stephen?" he asked, as the lawyer vacated his chair.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me," the latter begged. "I have had a long day, and it
  seems to me that my presence is no longer needed."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch110"
     name="ch110">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EUSTACE took the lawyer's vacated seat a little
diffidently. His whole
  attitude, in fact, was an interrogation mark. His cousin's message had come
  almost as a bombshell.</p>

  <p>"Will you drink port or sherry?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"The port is from the number twelve bin," Johnson ventured deferentially.
  "It was Sir Stephen's suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Port by all means, then," Eustace declared. "These lawyers generally find
  their way to the best."</p>

  <p>He sipped the wine appreciatively, noticing with some lightening of spirit
  that his cousin's glass had also been refilled. The latter waited until
  Johnson had left the room, and the door in the distance was closed.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to look in this evening, Eustace," he began, " because, in
  the course of various conversations, it has become clear to me that Sir
  Stephen has a somewhat mistaken idea as to my plans for the future. He
  appears to have thought that my tastes would naturally run towards social and
  philanthropic works, with a dash perhaps of politics. Nothing of that sort
  interests me at all."</p>

  <p>Eustace was puzzled but remained very much upon his guard.</p>

  <p>"Dry old stick, Sir Stephen!" he commented. "He's always on to me to take
  up what he calls 'a career.' Dash it all, I had six years in the Household
  Brigade! Quite enough that, for any man!"</p>

  <p>"My own tastes lie in other directions," Francis confided. "You could, I
  think, be useful to me." Eustace set down the glass which he had been in the
  act of raising to his lips. He was somewhat mystified.</p>

  <p>"Useful to you?" he repeated. "The spider that spun before the king, what?
  Jolly glad to do anything I can, of course."</p>

  <p>He finished his wine. His host refilled his glass and added a little to
  his own.</p>

  <p>"Glad to find you take a glass of wine, Cousin Francis," Eustace
  declared.</p>

  <p>"We made our own at the monastery," Francis told him. "It was poor stuff,
  though, compared with this. &mdash;It is probable, Eustace," he added after a
  moment's pause, "that you also have formed a wrong opinion of me."</p>

  <p>The young man moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," he murmured. "Coming from a monastery and all that,
  you see&mdash;well, one scarcely knows where one is."</p>

  <p>"You think that I am severe?"</p>

  <p>"Well, those chaps we used to see about in the brown habits&mdash;chaps
  that came and grabbed you the morning that Monica was on the
  ramparts&mdash;seemed a bit on the gloomy side."</p>

  <p>"That was your impression of them, was it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, those I saw wandering about didn't look exactly riotous, you know,"
  Eustace admitted; " didn't any of them look like hitting a bottle and making
  a night of it with the lads, what?"</p>

  <p>"Their opportunities for such recreation were somewhat restricted,"
  Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;just so," Eustace acquiesced, beginning to regain some measure
  of confidence. "Good chappies in their way, no doubt! I dare say they had
  their beanos in the refectory when the Lord High Pooh-Bah was away."</p>

  <p>"We were subjected to a discipline which allowed no latitude whatever,"
  Francis explained. "For that reason I am altogether a stranger to the life at
  which you have hinted. I desire to remain a stranger no longer."</p>

  <p>Eustace gazed at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I am proposing," his cousin said, in a matter-of-fact tone, "that you
  should show me something of the world in which you and other young men of our
  age live."</p>

  <p>"Holy Moses! Are you in earnest?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"May I have another glass of wine?" Eustace begged.</p>

  <p>"You can finish the decanter, if you will," his cousin assured him. "You
  will excuse my falling a little behind. This wine is more powerful than any
  to which I have been accustomed."</p>

  <p>Eustace fortified himself liberally and then continued.</p>

  <p>"Now, they're always telling me at home," he confided, "that I'm a bit of
  an ass. I don't want to put my foot in it, so let's have the aces on the
  table, so to speak. You want to chuck the gloomy stuff and plunge into the
  giddy world, what?"</p>

  <p>"Your phraseology is somewhat strange to me," Francis replied, "but I
  believe that you apprehend my meaning. We will begin at the beginning. I
  shall follow you to town to-morrow and I wish to be taken to the various
  shopkeepers who will provide me with the clothes essential to my
  position."</p>

  <p>"That goes with me, all right," Eustace declared enthusiastically. "I am
  at your service whenever you want me. I don't mind telling you that it will
  give me a leg up with some of my tradespeople who fancy that I don't plump
  down the ready quite fast enough. Good as another year's credit to me!"</p>

  <p>"Then," Francis continued, " I should like to be introduced into the
  society in which you spend your lighter hours&mdash;the society of Bohemia, I
  suppose you would call it."</p>

  <p>"You want to have a look at the fluff, what?" Eustace suggested.</p>

  <p>There was a slight frown of mystification on the other's fine
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Fluff! Skirt! Little dollies from the musical comedy and what not!"
  Eustace explained.</p>

  <p>"Just so," his cousin acquiesced, without changing a muscle.</p>

  <p>"Easy as falling off a log," Eustace assured him. "I'd no idea,
  though&mdash;well, this will be one in the eye for Monica."</p>

  <p>"For Monica?" Francis queried gently.</p>

  <p>"She's sort of got you amongst the saints. Earnest works, and uplift, and
  fish for dinner on Fridays, you know."</p>

  <p>"Your sister is naturally misled by the circumstances of our former
  meeting.&mdash;To continue, it is also my intention to start a racing stable.
  I should like an introduction to a very first-class trainer and the
  opportunity of purchasing some useful young horses for next season."</p>

  <p>"The turf!" Eustace exclaimed in amazement. "You're not going on the
  turf!"</p>

  <p>"That is my idea," Francis admitted. "Racing, I think, will be one of my
  chief amusements."</p>

  <p>"Racing!" Eustace repeated, almost reverently. "It's in the blood. That's
  it! Greatest sport in the world, Cousin Francis! I can introduce you to the
  man who used to train for our grandfather&mdash;won the Derby twice and the
  Cambridgeshire three times. Holy Moses! Why, I offered to bet the governor a
  monkey, just now, that you'd be spending all the family shekels endowing a
  monastery before the year was out."</p>

  <p>"You would have lost your bet," his cousin assured him. "The consecrated
  side of my life is for the present finished and, if you will permit me to say
  so, Eustace, the fewer references made to it, especially in that less
  conventional society to which you will probably introduce me, the better I
  shall be pleased."</p>

  <p>"I see your point," Eustace assented readily. "Mum's the word. I'll pass
  it round amongst the lads and lassies. Meanwhile, the day after to-morrow in
  London, eh?" he added, as Francis rose to his feet. The two young men walked
  down the room together &mdash;Francis nearly a head taller, straight and
  unbending, yet with a certain natural grace of movement; Eustace possessing a
  little too much flesh for his years, but also endowed with a certain amount
  of good looks. They parted in the hall, and Francis, after a moment's
  hesitation, entered the library. He walked to the fireplace and stood for
  several moments looking at the great picture which dominated the room. Then
  he rang the bell. Johnson himself answered it.</p>

  <p>"Johnson," he said, "do you know if Sir Stephen has gone to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen has retired, your Grace," the man announced.</p>

  <p>Francis glanced up at the picture.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can tell me, then," he went on. "Is this a portrait of my
  father?"</p>

  <p>"It is considered a very fine likeness, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"By whom was it painted?"</p>

  <p>"By Herkomer, your Grace."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he said. "Be so good, Johnson, as to bring two of the
  men here with a step-ladder."</p>

  <p>"I beg your Grace's pardon?" the man gasped.</p>

  <p>"Two of the footmen," Francis repeated. "I wish the picture taken
  down."</p>

  <p>"To-night, your Grace?"</p>

  <p>"To-night. I am sorry, Johnson, that I do not seem to have the power to
  make myself readily understood."</p>

  <p>"I beg your Grace's pardon," was the confused reply. "The matter shall be
  attended to."</p>

  <p>He hurried from the room. Francis stood quite still, gazing at the
  portrait. It was indeed a very wonderful picture and a wonderful likeness.
  There was the same high forehead, the shapely head, the deep-set eyes, the
  firm straight mouth, with the little lines at the corners, which might mean
  cynicism or humour or tenderness. The picture of a fine-looking man, proud of
  himself and his great name.</p>

  <p>Johnson reappeared and superintended the task. It took the united efforts
  of all three men to steady the picture on its removal. Francis himself had
  once to step to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"What will your Grace have done with the canvas?" Johnson asked.</p>

  <p>"There are some garrets in the house, I suppose, or a lumber room. Take it
  there."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your Grace."</p>

  <p>The men left the room with their burden. Francis leaned back against the
  table and looked up at the wall. His lips relaxed. The empty space pleased
  him.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch111"
     name="ch111">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS, awake himself before dawn, returned from a long
tramp across the
  park to find a car at the door and Sir Stephen on the point of departure.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to lose you so soon," Francis declared, with some note of
  courtesy in his tone. "I shall pay you a visit in London during the
  week."</p>

  <p>"You will be very welcome," his departing guest assured him. "I am glad to
  have seen you for a moment this morning. On thinking things over, I came to
  the conclusion that I had been a little hasty last night. I had formed
  certain conclusions and it was rather a shock to realise that they were
  ill-founded."</p>

  <p>"Pray do not allude to the matter again," Francis begged.</p>

  <p>"I must say this," Sir Stephen insisted. "I am something of an old fogey,
  of course, but I know as well as any other man that the call of life to a
  person of your years has an appeal of its own. I have been accustomed to
  invest with too much importance the rigour of your early days. It is only
  natural that there should be a reaction, perhaps even a little bitterness.
  Remember that you are young, by all means. I am still convinced that you will
  also remember that you are the head of a great and honourable family."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled enigmatically. He grasped the lawyer's hand, however, and
  wished him Godspeed. Then he allowed himself to be taken in to breakfast,
  served in a very pleasant apartment, with open French windows looking out
  upon the terrace. Johnson produced an overfilled postbag a little
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"There are a great many letters here for your Grace," he announced. "If I
  might make the suggestion, Lord Henry used to have Mr. Moss, our librarian
  here, go through them first. Quite half or three quarters of his
  Grace's&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;his lordship's correspondence consisted
  of circulars or charitable appeals."</p>

  <p>Francis waved the bag on one side.</p>

  <p>"Take it to Mr. Moss," he instructed. "I will see him later in the
  day."</p>

  <p>"Will there be any orders, your Grace, for the garage or the stables?"</p>

  <p>Francis considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"There are saddle horses, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"Let me have one round at eleven o'clock," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace is without riding clothes," Johnson ventured to remind
  him.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," was the brief rejoinder. . . .</p>

  <p>In some respects it was a strange morning&mdash;strange, not so much from
  its incidents as from the ebb and flow of the young Duke's mental attitude
  towards his surroundings. He wandered through the library proper &mdash;an
  immense apartment&mdash;was amazed at the number of books, and talked for a
  short time with the librarian. Then he strolled out of doors, passing in time
  from the more formal grounds to the old-fashioned walled gardens, high up
  behind the castle itself and gently sloped to catch the southern sun. The
  head gardener ventured to pay his respects, but Francis had little to say to
  him. The beauty of the place and of the soft summer morning seemed to stir
  within him a very slight sense of pleasure. He was entirely without any
  instinct of ownership. He tried to realise that whether he desired it or not,
  this great castle, magnificent in its age and dignity, was his; that his, by
  inheritance, were the associations connected with it; that the land upon
  which he trod as far as he could see belonged to him, that these were his
  vassals who watched him furtively from their tasks, or who ventured sometimes
  to address him. This was the jewel of his inheritance, a home where kings had
  sheltered; a home in dignity and treasures second to none in the world. He
  stood looking down upon it all without a glow, without a single thrill. As
  often as his eyes sought to admire, the soft woodland scene faded away and
  the bare Italian hillside, the gloomy, white-plastered villa, with its
  ever-present atmosphere of sadness, took its place. The sense of loneliness
  which had seldom left him in life became even more poignant as he realised
  the beauty by which he was now surrounded. The old monastic argument seemed
  to come back to him with more force than ever? the argument drummed so often
  into his ears&mdash;" Beware of externals. In proportion as you grow to prize
  them so does the flower of the spiritual life languish." Externals were here
  in profusion, although his contemplation of them was almost listless. Yet the
  monastic doctrine missed the point. There was no spirituality along the path
  he designed to tread.</p>

  <p>Nature had made him a fine horseman and notwithstanding the head groom's
  shock at his sombre and unsuitable costume, he watched his new master canter
  away with an expression of approval.</p>

  <p>"The Chatfield seat!" he declared. "Except for his clothes he's as like
  the late Duke as a man could be&mdash;hands and all! We'll be taking the
  hounds again in less than a year," he confided to one of his underlings.</p>

  <p>"For a parson," the latter admitted, "he does sit as he should, for
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Parson!" his superior repeated. "Worse than that, so I've been told. A
  monk, James!"</p>

  <p>"So long as it's no foreign religion he brings along"</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnson suddenly swooping down upon them put an end to the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"It was Sir Stephen's wish," he announced, "that his Grace's brief
  residence in a monastery should be alluded to as little as possible."</p>

  <p>"And I'm willing enough to fall in with it," the head groom agreed as he
  took his departure. "I don't hold with them monasteries nor monks
  either."</p>

  <p>Francis rode aimlessly and without any sense of direction. The beauty of
  the country through which he passed made scant impression upon him. He rode
  along country lanes whose tall hedges were hung with wild roses and
  honeysuckle. Beyond were meadows starred with wild flowers&mdash;meadows with
  deep green herbage, yellow-spangled by the side of the river. The villages
  were clean and prosperous, with thatched roofs and gardens like nosegays. The
  smiling quiet of it all irritated him. He found himself continually comparing
  it with the stony hillside on which he had played as a boy&mdash;comparing
  the rosy-cheeked, healthy-looking country people, stolid and content, with
  the lean, brown-faced workers amongst whom he had grown up. A feeling of
  impatience with his too placid surroundings led him to take a byroad which
  seemed to lead into a barer country. He came upon a heath&mdash;an
  unsuspected strip of moorland&mdash;with great fragments of lichen-covered
  rock, an occasional clump of gorse, and black patches of sun-dried bog land.
  Here he seemed to breathe a new atmosphere. A breeze, which he had scarcely
  felt before, blew in his face, fresh and vigorous. In the far distance was a
  thin streak of blue, which he realised must be the sea. He sat quite still on
  his horse, bare-headed, suddenly thrilled with the warmth of the sun and the
  stinging sweetness of the wind. He seemed to have escaped for a few minutes
  from the cloying atmosphere of an overprosperous neighbourhood. The solitude
  of the place, its emptiness from all signs of human habitation, soothed and
  invigorated him. He rode contentedly on&mdash;a black speck now in the
  untrammelled spaces. He felt a new sense of freedom, a sense of detachment
  from an entirely artificial world.</p>

  <p>Monica laughed as she reined in her horse.</p>

  <p>"Really," she said, "I begin to believe that you are at least an honest
  person. You really do dislike us. I never saw such a woebegone expression in
  my life."</p>

  <p>"Your coming was so entirely unexpected," he explained stiffly.</p>

  <p>"So was the vision of you," she laughed, M riding bare-headed and as black
  as a crow. You certainly do need Eustace to take you to a tailor's. Whatever
  were you saying to him last night? He came back in a perfectly beatific
  state. I don't see why the whole of your amiability should be lavished upon
  my unworthy brother!"</p>

  <p>"What land is this we are upon?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"'Whose,' I suppose you mean," she corrected. "It's yours right enough.
  It's yours all the way down to the sea, where you have, what I believe they
  call, fore-shore rights."</p>

  <p>He moved in his saddle a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"The Chatfield domination ranges far," he remarked.</p>

  <p>She glanced at him over her shoulder. They were walking their horses now,
  side by side.</p>

  <p>"How you hate yourself!" she exclaimed. "And, incidentally, us."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" he answered.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be proud of being the largest land-owner in the county. You
  may have reasons for hating yourself. You may be even a less pleasant person
  than you seem. But why any one in their senses should hate me, I cannot
  imagine. See how I have returned good for evil. I took an interest in you
  from the first."</p>

  <p>"An interest?" he repeated scornfully. "I was an object of curiosity to
  you. It was amusing for you to test your powers upon an Italian peasant
  lad."</p>

  <p>"I never imagined that you were a peasant lad, and I can assure you that I
  was very much in earnest."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"You certainly didn't flatter me," she rejoined. "Not by your actions, at
  any rate. Tell me, after you had decided&mdash;when you heard that gate close
  ? did you never think of me again?"</p>

  <p>"You were the curse of my thoughts for days," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"I'm delighted!" she exclaimed. "You've restored, at any rate, a little of
  my self-respect.&mdash;Round to the right, here. Lucky you have me to show
  you the way home, or you would never find it.&mdash;Now tell me how long the
  curse lasted?"</p>

  <p>"Not long," he replied. "Fortunately, I understood. You were just a
  somewhat sentimental young lady, amazed to see a poor Italian peasant lad
  about to give his body and soul to God, instead of elbowing his way with a
  million of his fellows along the muddy ways of life."</p>

  <p>"Rhetorical but inexact," she scoffed. "They need not be muddy."</p>

  <p>"They can never escape from it," he declared confidently. "Temptation
  itself is ugly. To breathe the same atmosphere as worldly people, lead their
  lives, and jostle shoulders with them brings one down to their level."</p>

  <p>"If you feel like this," she asked, "why did you leave the monastery? You
  seem to hate your possessions, your relatives, and yourself. Why didn't you
  stay where you were?"</p>

  <p>"I have not told you all that I feel," he answered gloomily.</p>

  <p>They had reached a level stretch of the heath. She touched her mare with
  the whip.</p>

  <p>"Come on," she invited. "This is one last chance of a gallop."</p>

  <p>They pulled up in about a mile&mdash;Monica a little breathless. He leaned
  down and opened the gate to which she had pointed&mdash;a gate which led into
  a narrow country lane.</p>

  <p>"Is this the end of the heath?" he asked, almost wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Every scrap of it," she answered. "Besides, we're twelve miles from home,
  and I'm getting hungry. Now, ride quite close to me, please. I want to talk
  to you."</p>

  <p>He obeyed without remark. His habitual impassivity of expression was back
  again. His lips seemed locked and his eyes were looking into vacancy.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that you hare behaved very generously to us all?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think so," he replied.</p>

  <p>"But you won't be thanked?"</p>

  <p>"You shall thank me in the future if you still wish to do so."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"You've gone away again," she complained. "Just as I hoped that you were
  going to be a little human! Are you going to live in the clouds all your
  life, Francis?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You will be very lonely," she warned him. "I am your cousin, and I am a
  very nice girl. Why won't you be friends with me?"</p>

  <p>"If you understood," he told her, "you would not care about my
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"Understood what?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"The sort of person I am."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! Why don't you take me into your confidence a little, as you do
  Eustace? Tell me what manner of life you are going to lead, what you are
  going to do with yourself?"</p>

  <p>"You will find that out soon enough."</p>

  <p>"But I prefer to be told. Why not confide in me as readily as in Eustace?
  I'm much more intelligent."</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica," he began&mdash; ?</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," she interrupted. "You'll have to call me 'Monica'
  sooner or later, whether you want to or not.&mdash;Now then, why won't you
  talk to me about your plans?"</p>

  <p>"Because they are, at present, unformed."</p>

  <p>They reached a stretch of turf across which they cantered&mdash;an
  obviously welcome diversion for Francis.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of it she swung purposely in front of him and, looking
  round, laughed into his steadfast face.</p>

  <p>"You dear solemn cousin!" she exclaimed, as they turned into the lane
  again. "Still, you did think of me in your cell, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"For a time," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Did you like thinking of me&mdash;Francis?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because in that environment to think of you was a sin."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, aren't you glad that you can think of me now without its being a
  sin?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes challenged his. He looked at her coldly.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to think about you," he said. "I do not propose to."</p>

  <p>Her laugh this time was scarcely natural. A slight flush of colour had
  risen to her cheeks. The poise of her chin was suddenly a little haughty.</p>

  <p>"My dear man," she assured him, "if I want you to, you'll have to. I
  haven't quite made up my mind yet whether I want you to or not.&mdash;Here's
  one of your lodges. Go through that gate and steer for that clump of elms in
  the distance, and you'll save a couple of miles. Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>She cantered off, with a wave of the hand. The woman who came out from the
  lodge to open the gate shaded her eyes with her hand for a moment, then
  curtsied low. Francis turned to her with a sudden question.</p>

  <p>"You recognise me?"</p>

  <p>The woman smiled.</p>

  <p>"No one who had ever seen your father could fail to recognise your
  Grace."</p>

  <p>She watched him gallop off across the park, a little disturbed at his
  darkening expression.</p>

  <p>"Queer folk, these foreigners," she ruminated.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch112"
     name="ch112">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"AMAZING!" Eustace declared fervently. "No other word for it!
  Amazing!"</p>

  <p>Francis, from the depths of an easy-chair, raised his eyebrows
  enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Why, the whole thing," Eustace continued, with a little explanatory wave
  of the hand. "This little suite, for instance, which I can't remember that we
  ever used. Why, it looks like a room in a palace! Where did you get those
  tapestries?"</p>

  <p>"Christie's."</p>

  <p>"And the bronzes?"</p>

  <p>"Christie's, too. I was there for several hours on Thursday. I bought that
  small Greuze. There was a great deal of competition for it."</p>

  <p>"I saw your purchase of it in the paper," Eustace observed. "Six thousand
  pounds! A bit stiff, what?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted it," was the indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"A damned good reason, too," Eustace agreed. "You seem to have the knack
  of picking up the right things, Francis."</p>

  <p>"Glad you approve."</p>

  <p>"And as to yourself," the young man went on ? "well, I never saw such a
  change in my life! Six weeks ago, you know, in that ready-made black suit,
  and your hair hanging down over your ears&mdash;well, you were a bit out of
  the picture! And now, my tailor told me this afternoon, Francis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pray don't betray your tailor's confidence," Francis interrupted. "Where
  are you going to take me this evening?"</p>

  <p>Eustace glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take you to see the most dangerous and the most
  talked-about woman in London," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Capital! What time do we start?"</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes. I am going to take you to see Mrs. Felicia Dringe."</p>

  <p>"Lady who dances?"</p>

  <p>Eustace nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see you've heard about her. She was well born but a divorcee. Kicks up
  her heels a bit, and gets excused on the ground of 'temperament.' You'll meet
  a quaint lot there, but they're generally worth while."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a sort of enterprise likely to attract me," Francis
  declared. "If you will ring the bell, we will have the car round. Sure you
  won't try a little more of that brandy before we start?"</p>

  <p>Eustace lounged to the sideboard and helped himself. Francis, from his
  easy- chair, watched him through half-closed eyes. The hand which held the
  bottle was shaking slightly. There were other indications that the young
  man's life during the last few weeks had not been one of strict
  moderation.</p>

  <p>"Played racquets this week?" Francis enquired, soon after they had left
  Chatfield House and taken their places in the car.</p>

  <p>His cousin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I ought to get a bit of exercise," he admitted. "Been too busy looking
  after you!"</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Exercise is rather a fetish, I think," he said. "I seldom take any
  myself."</p>

  <p>"You ride in the park at some unholy hour," Eustace reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Only when the fancy seizes me. I find it rather hard to break myself of
  the habit of early rising."</p>

  <p>"There'll be the shooting coming along directly," Eustace observed.
  "That'll soon put us in form. By the bye, how did you get on at the shooting
  grounds?" "Well enough. I do not think that I shall trouble to go there
  again. I shot snipe sometimes when I was a boy. They were more difficult than
  those black things they call 'clay pigeons.'"</p>

  <p>"You'll find the Chatfield pheasants are teasers," Eustace warned him.
  "Here we are! Before we go in, Francis, you know what you're up against?
  You've asked for this sort of thing, remember."</p>

  <p>"You are absolved from all responsibility," was the calm assurance.</p>

  <p>They turned in at a short avenue and pulled up in front of a long white
  stone house&mdash;a house from no window of which came a single gleam of
  light.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that we have not made a mistake?" Francis asked, a little
  doubtfully, as they mounted the steps. "The place seems uninhabited."</p>

  <p>His cicerone smiled and pointed to where a dozen or more cars were waiting
  on the other side of the avenue. a Felicia has fancies," he said. "Every
  window is heavily curtained, and all the lights have those sort dark shades
  on&mdash;Oriental effect, I suppose."</p>

  <p>The door was opened without a moment's delay. A man-servant relieved them
  of their coats and hats and asked them to follow him. They were ushered into
  a loud, crowded apartment with a buffet table set against the wall and little
  groups of men and women of all ages and conditions sitting and standing
  about. The further end of the room was hung with heavy black curtains.</p>

  <p>"Felicia isn't here," Eustace whispered. "I expect she's getting ready to
  dance. "That's the studio on the other side of those curtains. Now then, who
  shall it be? There's Mrs. Deane, the authoress of twenty or thirty
  novels&mdash;silly woman I call her, but brainy. She's talking to old
  Ponder-Blossom over there&mdash;Sir George Ponder, you know&mdash;great
  sport! Then, just on your left here is Stein, the man who owns all the race
  horses. The woman in the corner"</p>

  <p>"Who is the young lady," Francis interrupted, " who has just got up from
  the table in the corner and who seems to recognise you?"</p>

  <p>"Peggy Layton. Musical comedy. They say she's only twenty-two but she's as
  go-ahead as they make them. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Present me, if you please," Francis begged. Some masonic sign must have
  passed between Eustace and the young lady, for she came smiling over to them.
  She was very daringly dressed, although her simply arranged hair and large
  blue eyes supplied a contrasting touch of the <i>ingenue</i>. She welcomed
  Eustace as an intimate.</p>

  <p>"Like to present my cousin," he said. "The Duke of Chatfield&mdash;Miss
  Peggy Layton. Excuse me one moment. Stein has a horse running to-morrow I
  want to know something about."</p>

  <p>He plunged into the crowd, leaving them alone together. Miss Peggy, it
  appeared, was a little shy. She looked up at her companion almost
  timidly.</p>

  <p>"There is an empty table just behind us," she suggested. "Would you like
  to sit down?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he assented.</p>

  <p>A waiter brought them wine. Miss Peggy gradually regained her
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"We've all been hearing such romantic stories about you," she
  confided.</p>

  <p>"Really," he answered, "I am afraid that I am a very unromantic
  person."</p>

  <p>"You don't look it," she assured him. "But then you have lived in Italy
  all your life, haven't you? How wonderful to live somewhere else. One gets so
  tired of England."</p>

  <p>"You are rather young to be tired of any place." She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am twenty-two, and I feel that I have lived a very long time. London is
  a terribly monotonous place, though, for any one like myself. We are all the
  time meeting the same sort of people&mdash;and expected to behave in much the
  same sort of way. You can't imagine what a relief it is," she added, raising
  her eyes, "to talk, if only for a few minutes, to some one who is
  different."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he warned her, "you will find that the only difference
  between me and these others is that I am a complete stranger here. I am
  indeed very ignorant of the things I ought to know about."</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," she remarked, " to think that you have never been in
  England before. I suppose it would sound stupid to ask how you like it?"</p>

  <p>"So far," he confessed, "I am a little lonely."</p>

  <p>A very attractive smile parted her lips.</p>

  <p>"So you came here to lose your heart to Felicia."</p>

  <p>"Is she so very beautiful?"</p>

  <p>Miss Peggy made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"If she were only beautiful one might sometimes compete," she sighed. "She
  is terribly fascinating, though. Nearly every man she talks to for five
  minutes is in love with her. She has a most unfair monopoly."</p>

  <p>"Shall I be the exception then?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you're strong enough to resist."</p>

  <p>"I am gaining strength every moment," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"To resist any one else."</p>

  <p>She laughed. She had the trick of soft laughter, which in common with most
  other men he found attractive.</p>

  <p>"You say these things as though you were reciting them from a copy book,"
  she declared. "Has Eustace written you out a few sentences to speak when you
  are introduced to a young lady?"</p>

  <p>"Eustace hasn't gone so far as that," he replied. "At the same time, I
  admit my inexperience. If I am to have lessons from any one may I not have
  them from you?"</p>

  <p>She studied him appraisingly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she decided, "that you would be a refractory pupil.
  However, I like you. Shall we dance together later on?"</p>

  <p>"I have never danced in my life," he told her. "I want to learn."</p>

  <p>"Shall I teach you?"</p>

  <p>"You would do me a great kindness."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean it? You would have to come to my flat."</p>

  <p>"That will make the lesson more delightful," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"It will cost you an awful lot of money," she warned him. "Don't look so
  embarrassed, please. I forgot you didn't know about my little undertaking. We
  have a charitable fund for actresses out of work and I give dancing lessons
  for it."</p>

  <p>"I am sure that is very kind of you," he said. "Could I buy out the other
  pupils?"</p>

  <p>"I think you might if you tried. I haven't made a great success of it so
  far. When would you like to begin?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, if I may."</p>

  <p>"At my flat, twenty Gifford Street, at four o'clock. Unless you like to
  call at one o'clock and take me out to lunch first? You will find me in the
  telephone book if you forget the address."</p>

  <p>"I shall forget nothing," he promised.</p>

  <p>She touched him on the arm.</p>

  <p>"Look," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Without knowing exactly why, he rose slowly to his feet. The black
  curtains had been parted on either side a few inches, and were being held in
  their place by fingers of ivory whiteness. A woman's face stole into
  evidence&mdash;white as marble against the black hangings, cameo-like in its
  stillness, save for the soft curve of geranium scarlet lips. Her
  eyes&mdash;grey, indifferent eyes, heavily fringed&mdash;swept over the
  little company, until they rested upon Francis. Then the curtains were drawn
  finally asunder and a slim woman in a dress of dead black, unusual in
  appearance, but in her strange way beautiful, came into the room. She
  beckoned to Eustace.</p>

  <p>"Please bring your cousin to me," she directed. "You know, of course, that
  I am very angry with you. Fancy leaving him alone with such a harpy as Peggy
  on his first evening here."</p>

  <p>"Case of love at first sight," Eustace declared. "Couldn't interfere, upon
  my word. Francis, let me present you to your hostess. The Duke of Chatfield ?
  Mrs. Felicia Dringe."</p>

  <p>Francis held her very beautiful fingers for a moment, and the grey eyes
  looked into his. She was curiously silent in those few seconds. He had time
  to realise to his surprise that though her face was heavily powdered, the
  colour of her lips was entirely natural. He realised something else too, and
  for a moment his eyes looked over her head. When he looked down again, the
  inscrutable smile had returned.</p>

  <p>"Your cousin is not in the least like your description," she said to
  Eustace. "I have come to tell you all," she went on, "that I have decided not
  to dance this evening. You can go into the studio and amuse yourselves."</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of protests, of which Felicia took not the slightest
  notice.</p>

  <p>"I may change my mind later on," she admitted, replying to a handsome
  grey- haired man who had just arrived, wearing a long row of decorations. "I
  have no desire to dance at present, and when I feel like that it is
  useless."</p>

  <p>The light suddenly flared out in the studio behind. The music from some
  hidden place commenced, and the crowd drifted on to the floor. Francis
  remained by his hostess's side, although for the moment she seemed to have
  forgotten him.</p>

  <p>"May I ask you a question?" he begged, as soon as the new arrivals whom
  she was greeting had passed on.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"When you looked through the curtain&mdash;were you not meaning to
  dance?"</p>

  <p>"A person of perceptions," she observed, a little drily. "You shall be
  rewarded with the truth. Yes, I did."</p>

  <p>"Why did you change your mind?"</p>

  <p>"I never have a reason for anything. All that I know is that I lost the
  desire. If it comes again, I shall turn all those people out, whisper for a
  moment to my musician&mdash;but to-night I do not think that the desire will
  come. You are disappointed?"</p>

  <p>"Very," he admitted. "I came to see you dance."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You came to make my acquaintance," she insisted. "If I dance you will go
  away with confused impressions. To-night, you shall meet me, the woman. How
  do you like me so far?"</p>

  <p>"I have no feeling but one of wonderment," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are so different from every one else," was his rather lame
  rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"You think that I am a <i>poseur</i>, of course."</p>

  <p>"Are you not?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"Externally. No more. Take my appearance, for instance. I have some powder
  on my cheeks because I was thinking of an Egyptian dance but I do not use
  cosmetics. I saw you studying my mouth. Why did you look away suddenly?"</p>

  <p>For a single moment Francis was at a loss. She watched him struggling for
  a reply.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why you looked away," she went on. "You are instinctively
  a very moral person. You come absolutely fresh into life and you see things.
  I think that you realised what few people do, that mine is the wickedest
  mouth in the world. Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"With the exception of your tribute to my character, I think you are," he
  agreed. "There is a picture in the public gallery at Pellini by an unknown
  artist of a woman with a mouth like yours."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did not refer to 'Mona Lisa'," she said thankfully. "So many
  people do. And yet, if you were to study our two mouths, you would see that
  hers is the mouth of a saint compared to mine.&mdash;You have just come from
  a monastery, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I have. Do you mind very much if we do not refer to it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not! I suppose you realise, though, that it will make you very
  attractive to the young women of the Peggy Layton type."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely see why it should," he answered a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>"You are going to be difficult," she sighed. "Why did Eustace bring you to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Out of kindness of heart, I should imagine."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he wanted me to educate you," she reflected. "Tell me what sort
  of a life you are going to lead."</p>

  <p>"Just the life of other young men."</p>

  <p>"You don't look in the least like other young men."</p>

  <p>"Eustace is going to mould me," he confided.</p>

  <p>"Eustace!" she repeated scornfully. "If you are to be moulded at all into
  the worldly type, it will have to be done by a woman. I wonder whether it
  would amuse me?"</p>

  <p>"I scarcely think that you could take Eustace's place," he regretted.
  "There is the turf, for instance &mdash;I am thinking of racing&mdash;you
  couldn't help me there. Then I have some idea of owning a theatre."</p>

  <p>"These are only the externals," she pointed out a little impatiently. "To
  tell you the truth, I am surprised that you think them worth while. I'm
  almost inclined to wonder whether you do."</p>

  <p>"These things are expected of me," he observed.</p>

  <p>"You could live differently if you chose. There is a great empty space in
  the world of politics, for instance. You might easily become a leader of
  thought. You could set a new note for the young men of your generation; they
  are all very futile. These things seem to belong to you. They would not amuse
  me, but then I am a pagan. You are not. Why do yon wish to become one? You
  are not following your instincts."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how you know what my instincts are."</p>

  <p>"I am really rather psychic," she assured him. "Curiously enough, you
  attract me. I should like to be your mentor. It would not be good for you,
  but it would amuse me."</p>

  <p>"I offer myself your ready pupil," he declared. "You and Eustace shall
  complete my education. You will find me very plastic."</p>

  <p>She looked at him pensively for a moment. Then she turned away.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," she invited. "I want to show you my books."</p>

  <p>He followed her through the room now crowded once more and out into the
  hall. He noticed a trick she had of walking past her guests as though she
  scarcely saw them&mdash;a trick which seemed to be a habit of hers, for no
  one stopped them, although there were several new arrivals. She led him
  across the hall and down a passage lit by hanging lights, at the end of which
  she paused.</p>

  <p>"This is a room which very few people have seen," she said, opening a door
  and ushering him in. "What do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>He looked around curiously. It was a square apartment of no great size,
  with black and white walls, a white carpet and black curtains, a huge divan
  of black satin, and great easy-chairs, also black with orange cushions. There
  were bookcases in every possible corner, a table strewn with magazines and
  reviews, on which stood a jade reading lamp. A faint odour of Turkish tobacco
  hung about the place, mingled with some other perfume&mdash;a perfume which
  he somehow resented. The lighting was obscured by heavy coloured shades.</p>

  <p>"Do you like my room?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is unusual," he replied.</p>

  <p>She stood before him, her arms hanging down by her sides, her eyes raised
  to his. Against the background of black curtains she reminded him momentarily
  of her first appearance. Her face and arms again seemed unnaturally white,
  the scarlet of her lips dominant. And more than ever there was the question
  in her eyes, the faint ironical challenge with which she had first taken note
  of him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>For all his inexperience he realised instinctively that it was the eternal
  challenge with which he was confronted; the invitation, to which refusal is
  unknown. A wave of elemental puritanism suddenly swept away the spirit of
  tolerance which he had courted. He hated the slow ticking of the Chinese
  clock with its mystic figures, the enervating perfume, the yawning black
  divan with its orange cushions; more than ever he hated the scarlet mockery
  of her mouth, the eyes which read him, the virginal straightness of her still
  body with its enigmatic invitation.&mdash;The situation dissolved almost as
  suddenly as it had come into being. She was still standing there, but it was
  only the husk of things that remained.</p>

  <p>"Tell me why you came?" she asked, as she led the way to the door. "What
  do you do in this <i>galre</i>? Is it curiosity?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What is it then?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"I should like," he confided, "to know you well enough to be able to
  answer that question."</p>

  <p>"You shall have the opportunity," she promised. "Which is a good deal for
  me to say under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>She led him back to the studio by a way which avoided the reception room.
  They stood upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Will you dance?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I cannot."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. Then she laid her fingers upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Let us go and sit down somewhere," she said. "I am tired&mdash;I want
  some wine."</p>

  <p>They crossed the floor into the reception room. Francis was conscious of a
  great surprise. Amongst the little group of newly arrived guests was
  Monica.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch113"
     name="ch113">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"'THE Rake's Progress!'" Monica laughed, as she sank on to
a divan in a
  corner of the studio and made room for Francis by her side. "I had no idea we
  should find you here."</p>

  <p>"I am even more surprised to see you," he replied.</p>

  <p>"<i>Touch</i>," she admitted. "I was at school with Felicia, you know, and
  though she tries one rather high I've always kept in touch with her. Bobby
  and Edna were crazy to see her dance, so I brought them on after dinner. Do
  you know that you haven't been to see me all the week, Cousin Francis?"</p>

  <p>"I have been very much occupied," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," she rejoined coolly. "Buying polo ponies, hacks, clothes,
  lunching at restaurants, patronising musical comedy!"</p>

  <p>"These things are a necessary part of the life I intend to lead."</p>

  <p>"You will be bored to death in six months," she warned him. "I should make
  a far better mentor for you than Eustace. There is really nothing so inane in
  the world as the gay life according to his interpretation of it."</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid that the adventure may cost you something of your
  self-respect?" she ventured.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"After a life of discipline I may find the reaction attractive."</p>

  <p>"I do not think you will," she declared. "Licence itself does not, I am
  sure, attract you. If it did, I might point out that society can offer you
  precisely the same thing."</p>

  <p>"Through more difficult channels," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she acknowledged. "The fact remains, however, that I am very
  worried about you, Francis. I am terribly afraid that for some unknown reason
  you are going to make a false start in life. There are so many more wonderful
  things for you than stirring up the muddy places."</p>

  <p>"As for instance?"</p>

  <p>"You should mix with decent people and marry."</p>

  <p>"I shall never marry," he replied, "and the decent people I have met are
  mostly dull."</p>

  <p>"A celibate?"</p>

  <p>"From conviction."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could speak for a few minutes to the young man whom I met on the
  ramparts at Pellini."</p>

  <p>"I am here."</p>

  <p>"You are different," she assured him sadly. "You were a headstrong boy
  then, but you were at least natural. To-day you&mdash;frighten me. There is
  something sinister about your outlook&mdash;your cold craving for
  dissipation. I should like so much to see you different, Francis. You
  wouldn't like to shake hands with me, would you, and be real
  friends?&mdash;to let me try to show you what I think would be a more
  pleasing way through life?"</p>

  <p>"My plans are made," he declared harshly.</p>

  <p>"But why persevere in them," she protested. "You will find no happiness at
  the end of the road."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" he demanded. "There's plenty of the brute in us
  all."</p>

  <p>"There is very little of the brute in you, Francis," she remonstrated,
  "but there is something which I don't understand. There is something which
  you keep entirely to yourself, which not even Eustace knows. Am I not
  right?"</p>

  <p>"You are wrong! My life is exactly like any other young man's and I am
  going to live it the same way." She leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Felicia is going to dance, after all."</p>

  <p>The music had suddenly stopped and the dancers had left the floor. The
  lights went down, until the place seemed filled with shadows. Every one had
  crowded on to the divans and chairs around the walls, and the popping of
  corks and babble of conversation in the rooms beyond had ceased. The silence
  itself was impressive. Then, from some hidden place, a new order of music
  began&mdash;music monotonous at first but without the banality of the Orient,
  music sad one moment and wistfully passionate the next, so low that they had
  almost to lean forward in their places and hold their breath to hear it.
  Felicia was dancing even before they knew that she had entered the room. She
  danced in the black gown she had worn all the evening, her eyes always far
  away, her face a gleam of white. She danced with feet which seemed never
  raised; which seemed never to leave the floor. Now and then in her pauses she
  appeared to lean upon the air without support or the need of it. Only once
  did she lift her arms. Save for that single gesture, when they flashed up
  above her head, she might have been limbless&mdash;the dark shadow of a
  woman, driven by some irresistible force up and down and across the room to
  the bidding of the music. Now and then she was absolutely motionless, as
  though listening for the faint mystical throbbing of the violin. Then she
  caught it again and glided off. When at last it died away, complete darkness
  fell upon the room for a moment. Then every light in the place flashed out.
  Felicia had disappeared. The friends whom Monica had brought, a Captain
  Halston and his sister, rejoined her, and Francis was introduced.</p>

  <p>"It isn't dancing at all," Edna Halston declared. "It's the spirit of
  motion, linked up with a new idea in music. It was sweet of you to bring us,
  Monica. It's like nothing else I've ever seen in life."</p>

  <p>"For my part," Eustace confided, "I like to see what's doing! Front row of
  the stalls, with the limelight well on and Peggy Layton leading the chorus,
  are more in my line."</p>

  <p>"You're a very crude person sometimes, Eustace," his sister sighed. "I
  feel very ignorant about it, because frankly I don't understand what Felicia
  meant. Perhaps we weren't intended to understand. It was very wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," Eustace persisted doggedly. "If I watch a woman
  dance I like to see her legs. Felicia was just like a little bit of black
  cloud being blown about to the music. Freakish, I call it!" Another Felicia
  was suddenly amongst them. She had changed her gown for an amazing one of
  apple green. Her black hair had been rearranged, and she wore a Russian
  headdress. To Francis she seemed like a stranger.</p>

  <p>"I apologise!" she exclaimed. "To-night I know that my dancing was vague.
  There was something I tried to express and which continually eluded me. ?
  What is it Lord Eustace complains of?&mdash;that he could not see my legs!
  They are there, I promise you, but in dancing, why should they be shown? They
  are there to carry the body. To-night I danced to an idea of my own. I can
  dance otherwise when I choose."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell us what you were trying to express," Monica begged.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," Felicia answered, shaking her head. "I will tell you this
  much, though," she added, turning for the first time to Francis, "my dance
  was dedicated to your cousin.&mdash;Now you must all come and have some
  supper."</p>

  <p>Monica held out her hand regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Our manners are disgraceful," she confessed. "We have seen what we came
  to see and we must go. We are on our way to the Drummonds' dance. What about
  you, Eustace? Why don't you both come with us?" Eustace shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not our sort of show," he declared. "We have other plans."</p>

  <p>Monica sighed as she looked for a moment half appealingly at Francis. He
  listened to Eustace's excuses without comment.</p>

  <p>"It seems a pity," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Felicia resumed possession of Francis after Monica and her friends had
  departed. She led him into another reception room where supper was being
  served at small tables, selected one in a distant corner, and called
  impatiently for some champagne.</p>

  <p>"I am weary," she confessed. "Dancing for you, my new friend, is
  exhausting."</p>

  <p>"I do not under stand your art," he said simply. "I have seen no dancing
  except that of the Italian peasant girls."</p>

  <p>"Dancing is not meant to be understood," she told him. "It is meant to be
  felt."</p>

  <p>"That is why dancing to you is exhausting?" "And why I failed. It was, of
  course, hopeless." A servant brought wine and filled their glasses. She
  raised hers and looked at him for a moment. Then she drank slowly but
  thirstily.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you think me very stupid," he observed.</p>

  <p>"You are stupid, of course," she assented candidly, "but I do not
  complain. There is a great deal in you which interests me. There is a very
  large part of yourself which you do not know, a very great deal which is as
  yet unawakened.&mdash;And I am curious too. You have brought with you
  here&mdash;here, of all places, to the world of Peggy Layton and a million
  other Peggy Laytons, and me, and a few others like me perhaps&mdash;a
  quaintly exotic note of spirituality. I wonder how long it will last? And I
  wonder many other things. I wonder whether it is really spirituality, or
  habit, and what that thing in your life is of which you speak to no one."</p>

  <p>He looked across at her earnestly.</p>

  <p>"How do you know, or perhaps imagine, these things?"</p>

  <p>"You have heard what they call me," she answered, "'The Soothsayer.' I am
  a prophetess of Rosicrucian lore. I am also a woman and very hungry. Please
  give me some of that chicken salad, and tell me whether it is true that you
  are going to have dancing lessons from Peggy Layton?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," he admitted. "It appears that she gives lessons for
  charity."</p>

  <p>Felicia smiled.</p>

  <p>"You know where charity begins?" she observed drily. "I think I would
  rather give you those lessons myself."</p>

  <p>"It would be like one of the great masters teaching a schoolboy to mix his
  colours. Besides, I could not dance with you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>He evaded the question.</p>

  <p>"I am too clumsy," he replied. "I should tread upon your feet, which
  Eustace complained that he could not see."</p>

  <p>"Eustace!" she repeated, smiling. "What a strangely assorted pair you
  are!"</p>

  <p>"Eustace is my cousin," Francis reminded her. "He happens, too, to be the
  only young man of my age I know in London."</p>

  <p>"Admirably parried," she confessed. "And now tell me, please, why do you
  not wish to dance with me?"</p>

  <p>Francis for the first time broke through the reserve which sat so
  naturally upon him. He had realised within the last few hours that one phase
  of his attitude towards life must be modified.</p>

  <p>"Because," he announced, "I have certain plans in the world and certain
  intentions. You happen to be the only person I have met who might divert me
  from them."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little back in her chair. She had the air of laughter, but,
  as a matter of fact she did nothing more than smile&mdash;the same very
  slight, inscrutable smile.</p>

  <p>"How old are you, dear serious man?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five."</p>

  <p>"I thought that it must be so," she replied. "Nothing but extreme youth
  could justify such optimism. Every one starts life with principles and
  intentions. No one perseveres. You have a stronger character than most.
  Therefore, you will suffer more when you give up persevering. That is
  all."</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed for a moment. She leaned over and touched his hand. There
  was something of half-humorous appeal in her expression.</p>

  <p>"We are becoming too serious," she went on. "Some day you shall tell me
  all about your principles and this terrible secret in the
  background.&mdash;And you will let me help Miss Peggy Lay ton teach you to
  dance? You're not afraid?"</p>

  <p>He was himself again. He was even able to admire her very beautiful
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he confessed, "but of course I shall accept your
  offer."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch114"
     name="ch114">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS came in from an early morning ride a week or so
later to find Sir
  Stephen ringing the bell at Chatfield House.</p>

  <p>"An early caller," the former remarked. "You'll stay and have some
  breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. London hasn't broken you of your early rising habits, I
  see."</p>

  <p>"I ride at eight every morning," Francis announced, "sometimes earlier.
  We'll have breakfast at once, if you like, and I'll change afterwards. See to
  it, Johnson, will you? Come this way, Sir Stephen."</p>

  <p>The lawyer gave up his hat and followed his host into the morning room.
  The breakfast table was drawn up towards the open windows which overlooked
  the park. Francis pointed to an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he invited. "Breakfast will be in directly. You wanted to see
  me about something or other, I expect."</p>

  <p>"In a way, yes," Sir Stephen admitted, with some hesitation. "First of
  all, may I be sure of one thing? Will you recognise the principle which
  exists here between a client and a lawyer&mdash;especially a family
  lawyer&mdash;that the latter may say anything without being guilty of
  impertinence?"</p>

  <p>"I will recognise that principle willingly," Francis promised.</p>

  <p>"Then I want to tell you that you are spending a great deal of money," Sir
  Stephen said.</p>

  <p>"Am I?" was the indifferent reply. "Of course, it's all new to me."</p>

  <p>"Lord Henry himself was by no means a careful person," Sir Stephen
  continued, "and I had to realise several securities to bring your bank
  account into shape when you took over. You had a reasonable balance then. But
  they tell me that you have drawn cheques to the value of forty thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"Quite possible," Francis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Your bankers make no complaint nor are they likely to. Besides being a
  great landowner, you possess considerable properties, the deeds of which are
  lodged with them. But I feel it my duty to point out to you that on an income
  of eighty thousand a year, reduced to sixty thousand by your allowance to the
  family, and in the face of present taxation, you can scarcely afford to spend
  forty thousand pounds in less than two months."</p>

  <p>Johnson entered, followed by a footman. Silver dishes with tea and coffee
  pots were placed upon the electric heaters. Francis waved the men away.</p>

  <p>"We will wait upon ourselves," he directed. "Now then, Sir Stephen, tea or
  coffee? Help yourself to anything you fancy under those covers."</p>

  <p>"Tea, please. Thanks, I'll look after myself.? Now, what about it?" the
  lawyer added a few minutes later.</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I dare say I've spent forty thousand pounds. Never
  having had forty thousand farthings to spend before, it is even possible that
  I may have been extravagant. The worst of it is that it seems to me that I
  shall be drawing a great many more cheques within the course of the next few
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Sir Stephen exclaimed. "You're not serious?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Francis assured him, carefully preparing his tea. "I'm going
  to look at some yearlings tomorrow afternoon, and I might easily spend five
  or ten thousand pounds. One can't start a racing stable for nothing. Then
  there are a few bronzes to be sold on Thursday that I rather fancy. And
  there's a small Perugino offered privately. You ought to see it, Sir Stephen.
  There were half a dozen, as you know, in the gallery at Pellini, but to my
  mind they did not touch this one."</p>

  <p>"This is all very well," Sir Stephen declared, "but I must speak to you
  plainly, Duke. You have a very fine income, but you can't afford everything
  you happen to fancy."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," Francis agreed. "What about these properties you spoke
  of?"</p>

  <p>"Sound railway stock, Consols, War Loan&mdash;all trustee's stock&mdash;to
  the tune of nearly six hundred thousand pounds. Your father was by no means
  an extravagant man. The estates prospered very much more during his regime
  than with Lord Henry." "Six hundred thousand pounds," Francis repeated.
  "Capital! Well, sell out a hundred thousand. That'll do to be going on
  with."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen was aghast.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir!" he exclaimed, suddenly laying down his knife and fork. "My
  dear Duke! Forgive me. You can't possibly be in earnest. Sell out capital!
  It's unheard of."</p>

  <p>Francis appeared puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Why unheard of?" he demanded. "There's six hundred thousand pounds to
  play with, isn't there, besides the income from the land, which I take it
  must bring in nearly sixty thousand a year? It's my money, isn't it?&mdash;my
  money to spend or to leave alone, whichever I choose?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is your money," was the dignified admission. "But there is
  another way of looking at it. There are certain responsibilities appertaining
  to your position. You are the head of the House of Chatfield. It is your
  money to spend, discreetly and honourably, with due recognition of your
  obligations. Spend the interest, if you will, but the capital!&mdash;the
  capital belongs to Chatfield."</p>

  <p>"No trust or anything, is there?"</p>

  <p>"There is no legal trust."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to prevent my doing what I like with my own money?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the world."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better sell out that hundred thousand pounds' worth during the
  day," Francis directed, equably.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen abandoned his breakfast. He rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace," he said formally, "I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary that you should?" was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>"But what do you want with money like that? You haven't been gambling or
  anything, have you? There hasn't been time yet."</p>

  <p>Francis helped himself to more tea.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen," he observed, "you are disturbing yourself a great deal
  about a trifle."</p>

  <p>"A trifle!" the lawyer gasped.</p>

  <p>"A hundred thousand pounds is only a trifle, when you have another five
  behind and the income from the Chatfield Estates."</p>

  <p>"But the property needs keeping up. Besides, there are the taxes."</p>

  <p>"Why do you worry?" Francis asked. "I don't."</p>

  <p>"If you go on like this, what is to become of your successor?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that that interests me."</p>

  <p>"But you will marry. You may have a son."</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"In any case, there are plenty of male heirs," the lawyer declared.</p>

  <p>"No need for me to provide for them," Francis remarked indifferently. "In
  any case, I don't mean to. One hundred thousand pounds into the bank within
  the next few days, if you please, Sir Stephen. I shouldn't wonder if that
  Perugino didn't fetch between six and seven thousand pounds&mdash;a
  masterpiece, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen resumed his place. He did not, however, attempt to finish his
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Three months ago," he reflected, " you were in the monastery."</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't remind me of that, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"It was I who brought you away," Sir Stephen persisted.</p>

  <p>"You will probably live to be sorry for it. However, it's too late now.
  I'm here, established, ninth Duke of Chatfield, and five hundred thousand
  pounds more to spend before we begin to talk of mortgages."</p>

  <p>"Mortgages!" the lawyer gasped. "A mortgage on Chatfield land!"</p>

  <p>"It will very likely come to that," Francis declared. "You can't imagine,
  Sir Stephen," he went on, crossing his legs, lighting a cigarette, and
  passing the box across to the lawyer, "how amusing it is to spend a little
  money after a lifetime of privations. My father, the late Duke, allowed my
  mother, the late Duchess, five hundred pounds a year. Out of that she had to
  pay for my schooling, to keep two servants, and make extra provision for my
  father's entertainment when he honoured us with a brief visit. I remember
  that I had the equivalent of a shilling a week for pocket money. It was less
  than most of the boys at the school got. I was sometimes quite
  unpopular."</p>

  <p>"The allowance was absurdly inadequate," Sir Stephen admitted. "I cannot
  pretend that I was ignorant of it, because the sum was paid through my firm,
  but you must allow me to point out that there was no idea in the office, nor
  had I the slightest idea myself, that your father and mother were
  married."</p>

  <p>"I see," Francis murmured, softly. "That, of course, made the difference.
  However, my father knew, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"The behaviour of the late Duke is inexplicable," Sir Stephen confessed
  stiffly. "He had the name everywhere of being parsimonious, but the allowance
  to your mother, under the circumstances was, I admit, disgraceful."</p>

  <p>"His nondisclosure of the fact of his marriage might also be termed a
  little inconsiderate," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"It was criminal. In justice to the late Duke, however, you must remember
  that he died as the result of an accident&mdash;not a moment for reflection
  or for final arrangements of any sort."</p>

  <p>"It is a question whether an act of justice, an act of common decency,
  should be left to one's deathbed."</p>

  <p>"A great many men have committed the same mistake," Sir Stephen
  declared.</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, " this conversation was not of my choosing. I was
  only trying to explain to you, Sir Stephen, that my present extravagance
  might possibly be due to my penurious youth. It would be a terrible thing if
  the status of the future Dukes of Chatfield were in any way affected by this
  reactionary impulse on my part. If that should come to pass, I hope they will
  remember my justification."</p>

  <p>"You speak as though you yourself were not a Duke of Chatfield," the
  lawyer reminded him.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," Francis confided, " I much prefer my mother's
  family. Of herself I could not speak to you, but her father, my grandfather,
  a charming old gentleman, an aristocrat, although a pauper; and his brother,
  the Count of Magressa&mdash;alas, his income was less even than ours, but he
  too was a delightful person. I've had the great happiness of sending ten
  thousand pounds to be distributed between my cousins. It is a little offering
  which I shall probably often repeat. Are you going, Sir Stephen? You won't
  forget, will you? A hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I am going to consult with Lord Henry."</p>

  <p>"I should advise you to do nothing so foolish," was Francis's grim
  rejoinder. "You cannot say that I am out of my mind. You cannot say that I
  have not the right to do what I choose with my own money. You cannot deny the
  fact that so long as you remain legal adviser to the head of the House of
  Chatfield, it is not within your rights to discuss his actions with any one,
  not even a member of the family. If you choose to disclose our conversation,
  the alternative will doubtless present itself to you."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen looked suddenly older. As the two men stood up, Francis seemed
  to tower over him; tall, with powerful shoulders, lean limbs, and strength
  everywhere predominant.</p>

  <p>"The hundred thousand pounds shall be paid in at once," the lawyer
  promised. "I beg your Grace will not take offence at anything I have said. I
  am a little upset." Francis rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure, Sir Stephen," he said, " that your discretion will come
  to your aid."</p>

  <p>Francis bathed and changed, lit a cigarette and descended to the library.
  Mr. Moss, the librarian from Chatfield, was there and begged for a few
  moments' conversation. He was a small man with nervous manners, an
  archeologist and bookworm, who was content with a ridiculously small salary
  for the sake of living amongst the books he loved.</p>

  <p>"If your Grace will forgive me," he said, introducing a sheaf of papers,
  "these are the various charitable appeals from hospitals and kindred
  institutions which have arrived during the last six weeks. In cases where
  subscriptions have been given before, I have entered the amount in
  pencil&mdash;the County Hospital, I see, for instance, has had five hundred a
  year for the last fifteen years."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred a year!" Francis repeated. "A very interesting
  sum&mdash;especially this morning. What do they all amount to, Moss?"</p>

  <p>"Two thousand six hundred pounds, your Grace, on the same basis as before.
  There are several pensions, however, which I think you would wish to grant,
  to be added."</p>

  <p>"Pensions?"</p>

  <p>"To old servants of the Chatfield estates. Would you wish me to make out
  the cheques, your Grace, and present them to you for signature?"</p>

  <p>Francis laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss was a little surprised. "I beg your Grace's pardon," he murmured.
  "What am I to do with them?"</p>

  <p>"Just whatever you like," Francis told him. "Personally, I should suggest
  the wastebasket."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss blinked a good many times behind his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Does your Grace desire the lists revised?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"No, destroyed," was the uncompromising reply.</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss was silent. His hands were trembling. He was a nervous man, and
  the situation distressed him.</p>

  <p>"You see," Francis confided, "I have come to the conclusion that my family
  have been exceedingly extravagant in matters of charity. The amount they're
  given away is preposterous. Five hundred a year for one hospital! Five
  hundred pounds is a great deal of money, Mr. Moss."</p>

  <p>The librarian remained speechless. It occurred to him at that moment that
  his own salary was three hundred a year, that he had never saved a penny,
  that he had a wife and daughter to support, and a boy to educate.</p>

  <p>"I am not a great believer in charity at any time," his patron continued,
  " and I am told that the administration of most hospitals is terribly bad.
  You can destroy all those memoranda, Mr. Moss. It is not my intention to give
  anything away in charity for the present."</p>

  <p>"There is a cottage hospital at Chatfield," Mr. Moss began hesitatingly, ?
  "I remember it," Francis interrupted. "A very picturesque place."</p>

  <p>"It was practically endowed by the late Duke," the librarian ventured.</p>

  <p>"I don't like cottage hospitals," Francis declared. "Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"There is the Convalescent Home for Consumptives, also on the Chatfield
  Estate."</p>

  <p>"Consumptives should not be kept alive. They never recover. Destroy it
  with the rest. By the bye, Mr. Moss."</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"What is your own salary?"</p>

  <p>"Three hundred a year."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Moss," Francis asked, "can you keep a secret?"</p>

  <p>"I am not considered a talkative person or addicted to gossip, your
  Grace," was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>"From to-day, it shall be four hundred. But, if you tell a soul, I shall
  ask you to leave."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss closed his eyes for a moment of supreme thankfulness.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged," he said. "The increase will be very welcome.
  Should your Grace care for me to hold over these applications for a few days
  in case you should change your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest chance of it," Francis declared. "You can do what you
  like with them, but don't let me see them again."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace can rely upon my discretion in the matter as far as possible,"
  Mr. Moss promised. "Of course, there are bound to be comments, and, I fear,
  unpleasant gossip."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Francis remonstrated, "I do not require your discretion
  in this matter. Let it be publicly known that the Duke of Chatfield considers
  that his family have been ridiculously extravagant in their subscriptions to
  charity. They have shown too large a spirit of generosity. For that reason I
  discontinue everything. Five hundred a year to a hospital indeed!"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Johnson announced Lord Eustace Wobury, and
  Mr. Moss retired to his den to deal with this new problem.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch115"
     name="ch115">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EUSTACE was as usual carefully groomed, but his eyes were
red and his
  manner nervous. He was followed into the room almost immediately by a footman
  carrying on a tray a bottle of brandy, a syphon and a glass.</p>

  <p>"Hope you don't mind, old chap," the newcomer declared, helping himself
  with shaking hand. "Fact of it is, I had a rotten night last night. Hell of a
  time altogether!"</p>

  <p>"Lose your money?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Lost a packet," Eustace groaned. "Couldn't hold a card after you left.
  None of us did any good. Felicia was furious because you went off without
  saying good-by and she must have dropped a thousand."</p>

  <p>"I must try the game again some time. It seems to amuse all you people. It
  rather bored me."</p>

  <p>"Bored you! And you won five hundred in three coups."</p>

  <p>"I cannot see that that of itself makes for amusement or boredom," Francis
  observed.</p>

  <p>Eustace drained his tumbler and set it down empty.</p>

  <p>"You're a queer fish, Francis," he declared. "You seem to want to
  advertise yourself as a <i>rou</i>, but you make a dashed poor show at it.
  You play high at <i>chemie</i> and it seems to bore you equally to win or to
  lose. You order wine and drinks and half the time you don't touch them. You
  encourage these women, particularly Felicia and Peggy, and both of them come
  to me with the same complaint&mdash;they don't know where they stand with
  you. Peggy is showing every one the pearl necklace you gave her and every one
  knows that you've given Felicia the lease of her house. But what's it all
  mean? They don't understand you, either of them. Nor do I. Why, damn it, you
  play at having a good time and you don't have it!"</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"We all have different ways of amusing ourselves," he said. "You seem
  wound up this morning, Eustace. Anything more to say?"</p>

  <p>Eustace took an aspirin from his pocket and swallowed it.</p>

  <p>"Let's toddle round the park once or twice," he suggested. "I want some
  fresh air. If we find it too hot we can sit under the trees."</p>

  <p>Francis acquiesced, but his companion had soon had enough of walking. They
  sat in the back row of a line of chairs and the latter continued to unburden
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm one of those chaps," he explained, "who when they've got anything on
  their mind, like to get rid of it. You're a clever fellow in your way, you
  know, Francis&mdash;Art, Latin, and all that sort of tosh&mdash;but there are
  several things you don't seem to size up quite rightly over here. My fault, I
  dare say, as I'm supposed to be showing you the game."</p>

  <p>"In what respects," Francis asked, "have I earned your disapproval?"</p>

  <p>Eustace groaned.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that, old chap, with my head aching like hell. Of course,
  I know you've made a hit wherever I've taken you, and all the girls are crazy
  about you, but you must remember we've confined our attentions to Bohemia,
  and there's a sort of etiquette about the thing that I ought to have
  explained to you. Just to give you an example, you took Peggy Layton to the
  Ritz for luncheon the other day."</p>

  <p>"It was she who selected the restaurant," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Just so, but if you hadn't been a greenhorn she wouldn't have cheeked it.
  The Milan or Mario's are the places for Peggy. It isn't the thing for you to
  advertise yourself at the Ritz with a musical comedy actress. It puts your
  friends in an unfair position. Jolly bad form, you know. Then you actually
  sat in the front row of the stalls with her the other night at the Hilarity.
  That's all wrong."</p>

  <p>"What should I have done?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you must take her, go in a box and sit behind the curtain.
  People can see you then or not, as they choose. Then, if I were you, I
  wouldn't be going to Mario's for lunch all the time. It's all very well to
  patronise those sort of people but you don't need to associate with them. The
  grillroom at Mario's isn't exactly the place for the Duke of Chatfield to
  hang out all the time. You don't mind all this, old chap?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Francis assured him. "I am deriving great enjoyment
  from your conversation."</p>

  <p>Eustace looked at him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got to point these things out to you, you know. The governor
  was on to me about it yesterday. Seems to think you've lost your head a bit
  with these gay ladies and supper parties and what not. You won't take your
  seat in the House and you won't come and dine to meet the clan. You won't
  even return calls. There are heaps of relatives clamouring to grasp you by
  the hand, and you won't even shed a pasteboard on them."</p>

  <p>"As a duke I fear that I am somewhat of a failure," Francis sighed.</p>

  <p>"Now don't take it like that, old chap," Eustace begged. "I tell them it
  will be all right in a few weeks and that you'll trot out and face the music.
  Hard luck if you can't have a bit of a fling after all you've gone
  through."</p>

  <p>"Do your best for me, Eustace," his cousin enjoined. "I may change at any
  moment. By the bye, does all that you were saying about Miss Peggy Layton
  refer to Mrs. Dringe, too?"</p>

  <p>Eustace, who was sitting hunched up on his chair, pushed his immaculately
  brushed silk hat a little further back on his head and scratched his chin. It
  was an attitude which with him betokened profound deliberation.</p>

  <p>"That's rather a nice point, Francis," he confided. "You see, Felicia
  started from the right stable although she didn't run the course. You can't
  place Felicia. At the same time, if you were to ask my advice, I should say,
  why advertise your little affair with her? It wouldn't matter so much for me,
  but even though we're the same age you're the Duke, you know&mdash;one of
  those fellows with what they call a stake in the country and an example to
  set and the rest of it. In any case, where's the trouble? Felicia hates
  restaurants. You can dine with her as often as you like. You can smuggle her
  into Chatfield House for a little <i>diner  deux</i>. You've no idea how
  cleverly those things can be arranged if you've the right people about
  you.&mdash;Hullo, here's Monica! Frankly, I can't face her this morning, old
  chap. Make my excuses. Say I had to see a man about a horse. That ass
  Halston's certain to have told her of last night."</p>

  <p>He disappeared hastily. Monica looked after his retreating figure.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that means misbehaviour," she observed, as Francis rose to
  greet her.</p>

  <p>"Eustace has gone to see a man about a horse," the latter informed
  her.</p>

  <p>Monica made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Will you walk with me or shall I sit down with you?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down with me," he begged. "If we walk, people are always stopping
  you, and then you introduce me and I don't know what to say and I might as
  well be with anybody."</p>

  <p>"Do you care whom you're with, then?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," he assured her. "I like being with you. I feel that one of
  the penalties for this wild life into which I have plunged is that I shall
  probably see less of you."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. I enjoy hearing about it. I am told that you lunch every
  day at Mario's grillroom. Is it really amusing? Why don't you take me?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Monica," he said, "if Eustace heard you say that, his hair would
  stand on end. I have had a lecture from him already this morning. Don't you
  understand that there are different sets of places for different people. For
  instance, you may"</p>

  <p>"Oh, be quiet," she ordered. "I don't want Eustace at second hand poured
  out upon me. The funny thing about Eustace is that though he's a terrible
  little rip he's also frightfully conventional. Take me to lunch at Mario's
  grill, Francis."</p>

  <p>"I dare not face your brother's wrath," he confessed. "Furthermore, I am
  engaged to lunch with Felicia Dringe."</p>

  <p>"Cat!" Monica exclaimed. "Well, tell me all about it, Francis. Tell me how
  you're liking late hours and stuffy rooms and jazz music and wiping a girl's
  lips before you kiss her, and that horrible feeling in the morning when
  you've drunk too much champagne."</p>

  <p>"A wonderful life," he declared.</p>

  <p>"It seems to agree with you. You look very fit. Were you riding this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock. After which I had Sir Stephen for breakfast and a
  severe lecture."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards Eustace," she murmured. "They are leading you a life!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you scold me for not coming to your dinner parties, and for
  mixing with the wrong sets of people?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It isn't because I don't care," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you?" he persisted. "Every other member of your family
  tries to say a good word in season to me when I come across them. You hear of
  my doings and you smile. You don't approve."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't approve and I don't understand," she admitted after a
  moment's hesitation; " and as I don't understand I don't meddle. I think I
  understand this much, though," she went on, "which the others don't. You have
  a very much stronger character and a stronger will than any of them.
  Everything that they could say you know beforehand. So what is the use of any
  one's trying to influence you?"</p>

  <p>"Monica," he said suddenly, "I wish you weren't a Chatfield."</p>

  <p>"You don't like being my cousin?"</p>

  <p>"I think I like it better than being Duke of Chatfield," he confided.</p>

  <p>"You pay me a great compliment! Now, as I have spared you all advice or
  lecturing, I am going to ask you a question. Are you enjoying life?"</p>

  <p>"I am doing what I wish to do."</p>

  <p>"That is not an answer to my question. Are you enjoying life?"</p>

  <p>He was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I don't think, since I was a child," he reflected, "that I have ever set
  out to enjoy anything."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have," she assented softly. "You have lived as you are
  living now, for duty&mdash;or for something else. I wish I understood."</p>

  <p>"You speak of pleasure," he said. "Well, I will be frank. I find pleasure
  difficult. One way of securing at least an hour or two&mdash;a mad idea, of
  course"</p>

  <p>"Explain at once, please," she begged, as he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What I should really enjoy," he went on, "would be to fetch you in the
  car at half-past seven to-morrow morning and to drive down to
  Chatfield&mdash;we could be there at half-past ten&mdash;then to ride over
  that heath where I found you the day after I arrived, have our lunch
  somewhere down by the sea, get back to the castle and rest for a time under
  the trees and motor back to London, just as it is getting cool."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"You would really like that?"</p>

  <p>"I should," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"I should like it too," she admitted- "But, Francis," she went on, after a
  moment's indecision, "you know I'm tolerant enough. I listen to what people
  say and it makes no difference, but I have my little vein of quixotism too,
  or sentiment, or whatever you like to call it. I should love to spend with
  you just the day you have described, but I have to ask you something first.
  Just a word."</p>

  <p>There were humour and understanding in his eyes, as he met her questioning
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I have wiped no one's lips," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Felicia's are natural."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet with a little sigh of content.</p>

  <p>"It will be a wonderful day," she declared enthusiastically. "I shall
  bring a linen riding habit and the lunch."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch116"
     name="ch116">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALL traces of luncheon had been removed from the polished
oak table with
  its fine lace mats and single bowl of roses. A dish of peaches, a decanter of
  wine and a small coffee equipage were the aftermath of the feast. Felicia
  leaned back in her chair, a cigarette already between her provoking lips.</p>

  <p>"Some day you must take me to this Italy of yours," she said lazily. "I
  have been to Rome as a tourist, and to Florence on a duty visit&mdash;my
  mother lived there for years. Somehow or other I never imbibed any
  atmosphere. I was always with the wrong people or doing the wrong thing."</p>

  <p>"Unless one is careful, in London especially," Francis remarked, "it seems
  to me very easy to spend a lot of time with the wrong people."</p>

  <p>"Do you like being with me, Francis?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do I not prove it?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that you do. Do you realise that I had to ask you to lunch
  four times before you came&mdash; you who pride yourself on having no
  engagements?"</p>

  <p>He knocked the ash of his cigarette on to his plate and made no
  remark.</p>

  <p>"You drop in about midnight often," she went on.</p>

  <p>"You give me the advertisement of your presence here freely. You have even
  taken me to lunch or dine in public places once or twice. When I ask you to
  come here alone you are more difficult. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he answered after a moment's hesitation, "I have very little to
  offer in the way of entertainment. I have lived alone for so long that I am
  rather a dull fellow. Perhaps I shall pick up more confidence later on."</p>

  <p>"With me?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell."</p>

  <p>"You find Miss Peggy Layton easier?"</p>

  <p>"Much," he admitted.</p>

  <p>Her delicately arched blue-black eyebrows seemed to grow closer
  together.</p>

  <p>"I am told that you are her very good friend. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"In the sense you mean it, it is untrue," he answered. She drew a little
  breath. Something tense seemed to pass from her face. Her eyes were full of
  unspeakable things.</p>

  <p>"Why do you let people believe it?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Can I stop it?"</p>

  <p>"You permit yourself to be seen with her."</p>

  <p>"It sometimes amuses me."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe it," she said. "There can be nothing between you and the
  Peggy Laytons of the world. She could never be even an amusing plaything for
  you. That is where you puzzle me sometimes. You affect a banality you do not
  possess. You're a cryptic person, Francis."</p>

  <p>"No one could call you obvious," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"All the same, people believe that I am. All London is saying
  to-day&mdash;all London that is interested&mdash;that Felicia Dringe is
  trying everything she knows in life to secure her new admirer. They remember
  that I took you into my little sanctum where so few men have
  penetrated&mdash;did you see the leers and the smiles when we came back? They
  know that you gave me the wonderful jade necklace every one wanted. They see
  your car turn in at these gates and they have only one thought: 'I have got
  you. How long shall I be able to keep you?' As a matter of fact, you have
  never kissed me yet, Francis, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"You have been so near my lips many times," she went on reflectively. "No
  man has been so near before without losing or pretending to lose his head.
  You are not so very far away now, are you, Francis?"</p>

  <p>He smiled&mdash;an irritating smile to her, for she could not fathom the
  thought which lay at the back of it.</p>

  <p>"Further, I think, than I have ever been," he answered. "Certainly further
  than I was when you showed me your black-and-white sanctum."</p>

  <p>She rose abruptly to her feet and moved around the room, plucked a
  drooping rose from a bowl, glanced at herself in a mirror, wound up a small
  French clock. She moved with light and languorous grace; her walk was like
  the walk of no other woman. Her black hair was brushed smoothly back from her
  forehead, although it drooped a little over her ears. Her grey eyes were
  framed with faint purple lines. Her dress of grey velvet seemed to hang
  straight from her shoulders save for a restraining girdle. Except for the
  flaming scarlet of her lips she still preserved that impression of almost
  mystic colourlessness which he had first associated with her. Presently she
  came back and stood by his side, her hand resting on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, please," she begged. "I am nervous to-day. To make you a
  confession I must tell you that I was very foolish last night. I went to one
  of these silly gambling parties and I not only lost a great deal of money but
  I sat up very late. No one else but you would have seen me before evening. I
  am sure I'm not fit to look at."</p>

  <p>"You had better let me go away," he suggested. "Then you can rest."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," she replied quickly, "if you leave me just now I shall
  be disturbed for the rest of the day. Come into my little room. I will show
  you the sketches that Frenchman has just done of me."</p>

  <p>"I have ordered my car," he told her, "for three o'clock. I am going on to
  Lord's for an hour."</p>

  <p>"Your car can wait," she rejoined brusquely. "When I am ready to let you
  go, I shall tell you."</p>

  <p>He followed her into the jasmine-scented room, with its cool twilight and
  general air of repose. She played strange soft music to him,&mdash;music
  which puzzled him even as her dancing had done; which seemed indeed in some
  manner reminiscent of it. Always her fingers seemed to be reaching for
  something beyond; always the half-wistful, half-plaintive note predominated.
  It was music which was in a way tantalising. Francis found himself listening
  eagerly, even though with a certain dread, for the note of passion and
  accomplishment, always threatened yet never reached. When she left off, it
  was with a little crash, which seemed like an avowal of despair.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether you understand my dancing, my music&mdash;me?" she
  speculated. "I don't think you do."</p>

  <p>"I understand that you give me a great deal of pleasure," he said.</p>

  <p>"Does it satisfy you?" she asked swiftly.</p>

  <p>He was spared a difficult reply by the silent entrance of Felicia's maid.
  Her mistress turned to her in cold anger. The woman entered into a voluble
  explanation in smothered French. Finally Felicia dismissed her with a curt
  nod.</p>

  <p>"From Parnassus to the most sordid thing on earth&mdash; a baccarat debt!"
  she exclaimed bitterly. "There is a man here who refuses to go&mdash;a man to
  whom I lost money last night. I was foolish enough to tell him to come here
  to-day. Will you excuse me for five minutes? I will not be longer."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he asked, "is this&mdash;inconvenient?"</p>

  <p>"It is not your affair," she answered.</p>

  <p>"May I not be allowed to make it mine?" he begged. "Let me see this man
  and arrange with him. Our friendship should carry us thus far."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What an obvious situation," she declared contemptuously. "I ask you to
  lunch. I spend an hour trying to make myself look attractive. I give you many
  openings for polite speeches. I make music for you. And behold, my creditor
  arrives. It is all so obvious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You are not quite yourself, Felicia, when you talk like that," he
  reproved her. "I will see this man. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the room opposite," she said. "His name is Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>She turned back to the piano. Her head was bent. She reminded him for a
  moment of a crushed, exotic flower.</p>

  <p>"Don't come back," she begged&mdash;"&mdash;unless you want to very
  much."</p>

  <p>Francis crossed the hall and opened the door of the reception room
  opposite. A burly, clean-shaven man, very carefully dressed, with a round
  face, hooked nose, piercing eyes and a humorous mouth, was standing at a
  table examining some journals.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ambrosius," Francis began.</p>

  <p>The man looked up and dropped the magazine which he was holding in his
  hand. He staggered back for a moment and gripped at the mantelpiece. He stood
  there breathing heavily during the brief silence that followed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ambrosius," Francis repeated. "Brother Ambrose!"</p>

  <p>The man pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"I'm not denying it," he said defiantly. "I'm not denying anything. I
  robbed the monastery. I broke my vows, and I am here, enjoying life very
  much, and with every intention of going on enjoying it. You're in the same
  box."</p>

  <p>"I am not," was the stern reply. "I was granted a dispensation by the
  Pope."</p>

  <p>"Because you turned out to be an English nobleman," Ambrosius retorted.
  "Anyhow, you came away when you had the chance. I had to come away. I was a
  man. I had no wish to be a monk. The life was driving me mad."</p>

  <p>"You took the final vows," Francis reminded him. "I never did."</p>

  <p>"In a moment of terror," the other acknowledged. "I believed that I had
  killed a man in a quarrel at Orvieto. I fled to the monastery for refuge.
  Then I heard that he had recovered. I stood it for three years&mdash;I don't
  know how. There was blood in my veins, not water. I loved women and wine and
  life. The sight of the women working in the fields used to make a madman of
  me. One day I could bear it no longer. If I had not escaped I should have
  gone mad."</p>

  <p>"You robbed the monastery."</p>

  <p>"It was no good coming away empty-handed. I've returned the money with
  interest."</p>

  <p>Francis walked to the window and back again. There was another car outside
  beside his own&mdash;also a Rolls-Royce.</p>

  <p>"Are you the Mr. Ambrosius of whom I have heard?" he asked,&mdash;"a Greek
  millionaire?"</p>

  <p>"I am the man," Ambrosius admitted. "It is an exaggeration to call me a
  millionaire, but I am a rich man. My father died last year and left me his
  business. He was a money-lender in Sackville Street&mdash;a Greek who married
  a wealthy English Jewess. The business now belongs to me."</p>

  <p>Francis remained silent. The sight of this man was a shock to him.</p>

  <p>"I made a great deal of money," the latter went on nervously. "People in
  society have taken me up. If you're going to tell this story about
  me&mdash;well, I shall have to go back to the money-lending and nothing but
  the money-lending. I returned the money, Francis. You yourself came away when
  you had the chance."</p>

  <p>"What is your business here?"</p>

  <p>Ambrosius smiled meaningly&mdash;a cunning, unpleasant smile.</p>

  <p>"I might ask you the same question," he ventured, significantly.</p>

  <p>Francis clenched his fist and stepped forward. Ambrosius shrunk away.</p>

  <p>"You dog!" he muttered. "Don't dare to speak to me as though I were a
  partner in your foibles. Now, answer my question."</p>

  <p>"The lady of this house," Ambrosius explained, "lost a thousand pounds to
  me at baccarat last night. She couldn't pay and she told me to come here this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Get back into your car," Francis directed, "and drive to Chatfield House.
  Wait till I can see you. I will arrange Mrs. Dringe's indebtedness. I will
  also speak to you about other things."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ambrosius picked up his glossy silk hat.</p>

  <p>"I shall be there," he promised.</p>

  <p>Francis walked with him to the hall and watched his departure. Afterwards
  he lingered for a moment, hesitating. From where he stood he could hear
  Felicia still playing softly to herself&mdash;still with that note of
  interrogation in her music; a question, perhaps, or an appeal, although it
  seemed to have gained a more definite note; a sadder, more connected strain.
  He moved softly back into the recesses of the hall, found his hat and stick
  and stepped into his own car just as the parlourmaid came hurrying up.</p>

  <p>"Make my excuses to your mistress," he said, leaning from the window.
  "Tell her that everything is arranged as she desired."</p>

  <p>"Madame is still alone, your Grace," the maid ventured.</p>

  <p>The music ceased. Francis heard the sound of the opening of a door. He sat
  back in his corner. The car had started.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch117"
     name="ch117">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE saddle horses were already waiting upon the circular
sweep in front of
  the castle when the long grey car came racing across the park. Mrs. Morrison,
  the housekeeper, was in the hall, with a maid behind her ready to wait upon
  Monica. There was an unnecessary breakfast prepared, sandwich tins and flasks
  upon the hall table, and everywhere a great deal of pleased gossip. "The Duke
  and Lady Monica down alone from town!" To the simple minds of most of these
  people the affair was already arranged. Monica, perhaps, appreciated the
  situation, or rather the imaginary situation, better than her companion, and
  she was silent for some time after they had started on their ride. Francis
  too was silent but for very different reasons. He was riding bareheaded; the
  wind swept through his black hair, bringing light into hi eyes, and colour
  to his cheeks. The complex expression, the sense of an unnatural restraint,
  which puzzled many close observers, seemed to have left him. He was taking
  his joy of the sun and the breeze which freshened as they neared the open
  spaces.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she asked presently, "was Eustace with you last night?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My feet were off the treadmill for an hour or two," he replied. "I dined
  at home alone with some books which Moss sent up for me, and I went to bed
  early, with a disconnected telephone."</p>

  <p>"You see Eustace most nights, though," she persisted. "Do you realise that
  he is drinking more than is good for him and spending a great deal of
  money?"</p>

  <p>"I am scarcely his guardian, am I?" Francis replied. "Eustace lives, I
  suppose, according to his tastes."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, I think, Francis," she went on gravely, "that you are being
  too kind to us&mdash;allowing us too much money, I mean. I am quite sure that
  we are all spending too much&mdash;myself included."</p>

  <p>"Why spoil such a beautiful morning with sordid reflections?" he
  complained.</p>

  <p>"You are right," she agreed. "I warn you that I am going to talk to you
  seriously later. Just now let us forget."</p>

  <p>They climbed on to the heath, where the wind from the sea came in little
  gusts, where the air was gorse-scented, the wild thyme grew in clumps, the
  turf beneath their horses' feet was light and spongy. From the distance came
  the sound of reaping machines, where the harvest had commenced. In front of
  them was the blue line of the sea.</p>

  <p>"We are carnal creatures," Monica declared. "In the midst of all this
  beauty I keep on remembering that I am hungry."</p>

  <p>"There is a watch tower on the beach," he pointed out, "with a barn
  attached. I thought if we could get the horses inside we could find a
  comfortable place somewhere near."</p>

  <p>"I have picnicked there quite often," she told him. "We have to bear to
  the right a little and cross the marsh."</p>

  <p>They passed a strip of meadowland, thick with buttercups and marsh
  marigolds, with a great clump of brilliant poppies at its sandy end. The
  marsh land on to which they emerged was riddled with narrow tidal streams,
  several of which they crossed. They came out on a sandy bluff and dismounted.
  Francis led the horses to the barn and secured them. Afterwards they found a
  shady corner&mdash;a sandy oasis with a patch of wild lavender at their feet
  and the sea only a dozen yards away. They spread out the lunch.</p>

  <p>"And to think," Monica exclaimed, with a sigh of infinite content, "that I
  am supposed to be lunching at Claridge's with an elderly aunt and two
  cousins, going to a picture gallery afterwards and winding up with a tea
  dance. We waste a lot of time doing silly things, Francis."</p>

  <p>"You have been doing them longer than I have, Monica," he ventured.</p>

  <p>"A girl has to," she answered. "A man can always get away. My life is
  comprehensible to a certain extent. I am hoping to find a man I like well
  enough to marry who will ask me to marry him. You don't have to stand in the
  market."</p>

  <p>"Must you be married?" he asked lazily.</p>

  <p>"Of course I must, you idiot! Is there anything more appalling in the
  world than a spinster. I am not risking it, anyhow!"</p>

  <p>"You have plenty of suitors, they tell me," he remarked, pouring out some
  wine from the thermos flask.</p>

  <p>"I have more than my share," she admitted. "Some day or other I shall give
  one the fright of his life by accepting him. Just at present I am too worried
  to think about myself."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"We're all spending far too much money. We're getting into debt and
  altogether it's very ignominious. Eustace loves racing and musical comedy
  young ladies. I adore clothes, and how Dad spends money I don't know, but he
  does spend it."</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen considers me extravagant," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Yours is the one life I don't understand in the least," she confessed.
  "The money, I suppose, doesn't matter to you, but you spend yourself, which
  is much more important. And I cannot understand what you are getting out of
  it. You're an enigma to me. I think I'm rather afraid of you."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind passing me another hard-boiled egg," he asked, "and the brown
  bread and butter?"</p>

  <p>She handed him the packet in silence. Above them a lark was singing.
  Almost at their feet the splash of the waves fell and died away. In the
  background they could still just catch the hum of the reaping machines.</p>

  <p>"Somehow or other," he said a little dreamily, "I feel that this is one of
  those days when one pauses in life. I wish there were more of them."</p>

  <p>"You are your own master," she reminded him. "You're not like the rest of
  us poor slaves, obliged to stay in town. Why don't you come down here?"</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"It's your own fault if you have few friends," she pointed out. "You have
  not returned a single call. You have refused innumerable offers of friendship
  and invitations. You have a score of relatives now in London who have never
  met you."</p>

  <p>"They'll lose the desire before long," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Very probably," she assented. "You have made a deliberate choice, you
  know, Francis, of an unworthy life. That is Dad's favourite speech about you.
  He always trots it out after we have asked you to dinner and you have
  refused. Let's forget about London, Francis. Talk to me about Italy and
  pictures." He half closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The most beautiful picture in the gallery at Pellini," he said&mdash;"the
  picture I oftenest think about ? reminds me of you."</p>

  <p>Monica settled herself more comfortably.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she begged. "Tell me some more."</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when they rode homeward. Upon the outskirts
  of the park they passed a roadside cottage. A child in an invalid chair was
  lying back amongst the hollyhocks, looking out a little wistfully. Monica
  pulled in her horse.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Amy Green?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the girl murmured shyly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's Amy, my lady," her mother, who had stepped out of the cottage,
  added. "They sent her home yesterday."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Monica demanded. "I heard she was getting on so nicely."</p>

  <p>The woman looked hesitatingly at Francis.</p>

  <p>"We had word yesterday from the Board, my lady, that they couldn't keep
  Amy any longer," the woman explained. "It seems the subscriptions have gone
  down."</p>

  <p>"Subscriptions?" Monica repeated. "I haven't heard anything of that."</p>

  <p>"It seems, my lady, that his Grace sent word that he couldn't go on with
  the five hundred a year he's been giving. They are obliged to close half the
  beds."</p>

  <p>"Absurd!" Monica exclaimed. "Francis, do you hear that? I am sure, Mrs.
  Green," she added, "that there has been some mistake."</p>

  <p>"We should be very glad to hear it, my lady," the woman replied
  doubtfully. "Amy was getting on so nicely. I'm afraid, though, that it's
  right. Mr. Humphries, the steward, was along yesterday and he said that his
  Grace has stopped all charitable subscriptions."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this all means, Francis?" Monica demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he answered coldly. "I'm sorry for the child."</p>

  <p>He touched his horse with the whip. Monica leaned from her saddle.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Green," she promised, "Amy shall be back at the hospital within a
  week. I will see to it. Do you want to go back, Amy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lady," the child murmured.</p>

  <p>"It might be the saving of her life, the doctor says," the woman declared
  wistfully.</p>

  <p>"She shall go back," Monica promised once more.</p>

  <p>She cantered on to Francis's side. He was waiting at the entrance gate
  which the portress was holding open.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she began&mdash; ? "This is where we gallop, isn't it?" he
  interrupted her.</p>

  <p>He was waiting to help her from her horse when she reached the castle.</p>

  <p>"I should suggest you have tea first," he said, " and then change. I see
  they have set the table under the cedar tree on the other side."</p>

  <p>She followed him almost in silence. They descended the terrace steps on to
  the smooth greensward, from which the lawns sloped to the lower flower
  gardens. Half a dozen handsome peacocks were strutting about. In the wood
  which bordered the gardens a thrush was singing. Monica made the tea in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Is this true, Francis?" she asked him presently.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," he answered.</p>

  <p>She said no more, but the joy of the day seemed to have passed. She was
  suddenly pale and tired. She ate and drank listlessly. As soon as she had
  finished, she rose.</p>

  <p>"I will have a bath and change," she said. "If we start in an hour's time,
  will that do?"</p>

  <p>"It will get us into London at nine o'clock," he replied. "Any time will
  do for me."</p>

  <p>He watched her cross the lawn and climb the steps of the terrace, the
  charm of her slim, girlish figure revealed to its fullest extent by her linen
  riding habit. She walked sadly, though, and he could almost have fancied that
  there were tears in her eyes as she passed along the terrace, her face a
  little averted. She was carrying her hat and whip in her hand, and the sun
  which was playing on the mullioned windows of the western floor caught the
  gold in her hair and flamed for a moment around her face. She disappeared
  without a backward glance.</p>

  <p>In the car they were silent for some time. When at last he spoke, his tone
  was harsh and unpleasing.</p>

  <p>"Monica," he said, "this friendship of ours is absurd. It must come to an
  end."</p>

  <p>"What have I done, Francis?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"You done? Nothing," he declared. "But can't you see what I am? I have no
  desire to live creditably and honourably and well. That woman spoke the
  truth. I have ordered the whole of my subscriptions to charity to be
  discontinued. I need the money for other purposes."</p>

  <p>"It is your affair," she sighed. "I have not blamed you. I can get the
  child back into the hospital."</p>

  <p>"You have not blamed me," he repeated, "but I know what you are
  thinking."</p>

  <p>"That you cannot know, Francis. There are some things about you which I do
  not understand. There are things about your behaviour which are amazing to
  me. But however hard I try, I cannot believe that you have not some reason
  for what you do. I am sorry if you are really going to shut me out of your
  life."</p>

  <p>"There is no place for you in it," he pronounced.</p>

  <p>She watched him covertly. The longer she watched, the more contented she
  became.</p>

  <p>"You really mind a little?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I mind," he answered, almost roughly. "I mind a great deal. I like
  you, Monica. If you knew what sort of a being I was&mdash;well, you would
  hate the thought that you were here by my side. You will know some day and
  then you will feel like that. That's why we can't be friends."</p>

  <p>"There is just one thing I should like to know. Why can you be friends
  with Eustace and not with me?"</p>

  <p>"That's a different matter. Eustace is a man."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you said you liked me, Francis," she confessed, resting her
  hand upon his. "I would like you very much indeed if only you would be
  reasonable. I have loved being with you to-day, and it's quite a test, isn't
  it?&mdash;very nearly twelve hours."</p>

  <p>He suddenly caught hold of her hand, drew it through his arm and held it
  in his own strong brown fingers. She gave a little start. Her eyes
  glowed.</p>

  <p>"Francis!" she exclaimed softly.</p>

  <p>A new feeling had seized him. For a moment the passion of his life was
  forgotten. They were passing through a pine wood, from the dying sunlight
  into the scented dusk.</p>

  <p>"Monica," he said hoarsely, "&mdash;you know what I told you. It was true.
  This is just for this moment, for this hour."</p>

  <p>She turned her lips to his. Her arm passed around to his other
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am like you," she whispered, as she clung to him, "if it is
  only for this minute, only for this hour, I want you to take&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her lips were closed by his; his arms enfolded her. They passed out of the
  wood into the long stretch of lonely road. There was a single star in the sky
  and the twilight stealing upon them.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch118"
     name="ch118">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS, on the following morning, received another early
caller. Mr.
  Ambrosius was announced and shown into the room just as he was finishing
  breakfast. He nodded and pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"You have breakfasted?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Two hours ago."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"I see that we have both preserved the good habit of early rising," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I was restless last night," Ambrosius confessed. "I want to know what
  you're going to do."</p>

  <p>"On my own terms," Francis replied, "I am going to hold my tongue."</p>

  <p>A muttered exclamation of thankfulness escaped from his visitor's lips.
  Francis rose to his feet and remained standing for the rest of the
  interview.</p>

  <p>"Ambrosius," he said, "I know quite well that you are a graceless
  scoundrel. There were some of your doings at Pellini to which we have not
  alluded. There was no necessity for us to allude to them, but I was one of
  those who knew."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I was unsuited for the life," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"You appear with the help of your father's fortune," Francis continued,
  "to have thrust your way into some sort of society here. It is not my affair.
  I am content to meet you as a stranger. I owe nothing to the people whom you
  may deceive. In return, there is a way in which you can be useful to me."</p>

  <p>"Nothing I can do in the world," the man began eagerly&mdash; ? "You're a
  money-lender&mdash;or rather you have a money-lender's business," Francis
  proceeded. "I shall send you some friends of mine&mdash;relatives. I want you
  to let them have what money they ask for on better terms than any one else
  would. I want you to encourage them to borrow. I will be security."</p>

  <p>"That's very simple," Ambrosius declared. "I'll charge them half my usual
  rates with pleasure. Any friend of yours"</p>

  <p>"You need not quote from your circular," Francis interrupted. "The two
  people for whom I wish to make borrowing easy are my uncle, Lord Henry
  Wobury, and my cousin, Eustace Wobury. You will take their notes of hand for
  all the money you advance, and you will look upon those notes as belonging to
  me. I shall pay you for them."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius was a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"They haven't got anything, you know, except what you allow them."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>Ambrosius grinned.</p>

  <p>"The governor kept tabs on everybody. His books are the most wonderful
  record. He's got every member of the aristocracy who's ever borrowed a penny
  or likely to borrow sized up there with his prospects and particulars about
  his property."</p>

  <p>"The fact that they have nothing," Francis pointed out, "need not stand in
  your way. I will sign any form of security you suggest, but I want the notes
  to be always where I can lay my hand upon them. That is perfectly well
  understood between us?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Now, with regard to Mrs. Dringe's debt?"</p>

  <p>Ambrosius reflected for a moment. His bright black eyes searched in vain
  his companion's expressionless face.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth," he admitted, "I wasn't going to be too hard
  upon the lady. She's not my taste exactly, but they tell me she's quite the
  vogue in town and I want to be asked to her studio. I think if she could have
  seen me the other day, we could have come to some arrangement," he wound up,
  with a smile which was almost a leer.</p>

  <p>Francis drew a cheque-book from his pocket and seated himself at a writing
  table.</p>

  <p>"What was the amount of Mrs. Dringe's debt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>He wrote out a cheque and handed it over.</p>

  <p>"It is my intention to make use of you, Ambrosius," he said, "but there is
  no reason why I should not tell you that some day or other you will be
  horsewhipped. Take that cheque now and go."</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," Ambrosius mumbled&mdash; ? "And go," Francis repeated,
  grimly, pointing to the door.</p>

  <p>Francis bathed, changed his clothes and descended to the library, where he
  found Mr. Moss awaiting him. The librarian was in a state of nerves. He was
  not yet used to his good fortune, and he was more afraid of his present
  employer than he had been of any one during the whole of his life. Francis
  took note of the anxious gleam in his eyes and the tremble in his voice as he
  wished him good morning.</p>

  <p>"You got my message, Mr. Moss?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Grace," the little man answered. "I trust that nothing is
  wrong. You found the library at Chatfield in good order?"</p>

  <p>"As I expected to," Francis replied gravely. "You seem disturbed."</p>

  <p>"I am of a nervous temperament, your Grace," Mr. Moss confessed. "I have
  been in the service of your house for a great many years and I have lost
  touch with outside affairs. I heard it rumoured that your Grace was thinking
  of closing Chatfield."</p>

  <p>There was an unaccustomed note in Francis's tone; a note which was
  certainly not present when he talked to his friends or relatives.</p>

  <p>"You need be under no apprehension as to your own future, Mr. Moss," he
  said kindly. "I appreciate your services and as time goes on I hope to make
  more use of them in the library."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace is very kind," Mr. Moss murmured, with a little sigh of
  relief. "I must admit that I have had apprehensions."</p>

  <p>"Banish them," Francis enjoined. "Your salary, subject to a small yearly
  increase, will only cease with a pension. I sent for you on a confidential
  matter, Mr. Moss. You have during the last few weeks undertaken secretarial
  work for me. I need some one in whom I can repose entire confidence; who will
  ask no questions and exhibit no curiosity. Will you be that person?"</p>

  <p>"I shall esteem it an honour," Mr. Moss declared fervently.</p>

  <p>"I gave you a list a few days ago of charities to be cancelled."</p>

  <p>"The letters have all been written, your Grace, and dispatched."</p>

  <p>"Good! I wish you during the day to make out a cheque for the full amount
  of those charities and present it to me for signature. You will then approach
  a solicitor&mdash;a stranger to me and known only by repute to you. You will
  hand him over the money and you will give him instructions to write to each
  of the charities and say that a client who desires to remain anonymous wishes
  to make up to them for the amount they have lost by the Duke of Chatfield's
  withdrawal."</p>

  <p>"To make it up? With your own money, your Grace?"</p>

  <p>"You and I," Francis said, " are the only two who will know that, Mr.
  Moss."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"The cottage hospital at Chatfield is to be specially written to," Francis
  continued, "and any patient of theirs who has been sent away is to be
  immediately re-admitted. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"I am extending to you, Mr. Moss," Francis concluded, "a confidence which
  I have offered to no one in this country. I trust you to respect it in the
  spirit as well as the letter."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace can rely on me," Mr. Moss assured him earnestly.</p>

  <p>Francis drew a catalogue from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"To pass on to an entirely different matter, there is a sale at Christie's
  to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>"The Rappelli manuscripts," Mr. Moss exclaimed eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Francis agreed. "You will attend it and purchase on my behalf
  the three manuscripts I have marked."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss's weak little red eyes glittered behind his spectacles as he took
  the catalogue.</p>

  <p>"Those are the three most valuable, your Grace," he pointed out, in a tone
  of deep respect.</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"Two of them I have examined years ago in Florence," he declared. "The
  third, I think, has been in England for some time. You will secure them, Mr.
  Moss, at any price."</p>

  <p>"I shall have the greatest pleasure in adding them to your Grace's
  collection," the librarian declared ecstatically. "And with regard to the
  other matter, your Grace can rely upon my entire discretion."</p>

  <p>Eustace made his accustomed appearance at Chatfield House shortly before
  midday. He found Francis examining some manuscripts which Mr. Moss had
  produced for his inspection.</p>

  <p>"I say, old chap, Monica wants to see you," Eustace announced.</p>

  <p>Francis laid down the manuscript which he was studying.</p>

  <p>"Is she here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Talking to old Madam Griswold in the halL She's terribly mysterious this
  morning. She wants to see you for five minutes alone. Afterwards I've a word
  for your private ear."</p>

  <p>"Please bring your sister in," Francis invited. He sat quite still during
  Eustace's momentary absence. He had not anticipated seeing her again so soon.
  The thought of her near presence was a joy, although he shrank from the
  meeting. He had full faith in her pride but he was suddenly conscious of the
  meanness of relying upon it.</p>

  <p>Monica entered alone, closing the door behind her. Her eyes met his quite
  frankly, although for a moment there seemed to be an unaccustomed shyness in
  her manner. Otherwise there was not the slightest suggestion of memory.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'm a terrible nuisance," she said, seating herself in the
  chair which he held for her. "You'll think I'm a worse one before I've
  finished. I've come to ask a great favour."</p>

  <p>He stood before her very still and grave. She waved him away.</p>

  <p>"Go and sit down, please," she begged. ** You look so alarming there I
  shall never find courage to make my request.&mdash;That's right. I'd love to
  have a picture of you, seated before your desk like that, with those grubby
  manuscripts in front of you. 'The intellectual Duke', it might be called. I
  suppose you are clever, Francis, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Amazingly!" he assured her. "I have just transported Mr. Moss into the
  seventh heaven of delight. I am by way of being a Latin scholar, you see, and
  I can read my own manuscripts."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not going to be afraid of you," she declared, "any more afraid
  than I am. Now for my favour, Francis. Eustace is waiting about outside like
  a caged tiger."</p>

  <p>"Please go on."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to ask you, Francis, to alter in any vital degree the life
  which you seem to have planned for yourself. You can pursue your apparent
  ambition to be the uncrowned king of Bohemia. I do not wish to interfere with
  the tenor of your life in any way. Please understand that. But I want you to
  make one concession."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to meet your relatives just once, and all those people who
  wear us to death with questionings and wonderings and clamourings. You can be
  as rude to them as you like. You can leave early if you want to and give a
  supper party at Mario's afterwards, but please sit at the table with them and
  let us cease to be the intermediaries."</p>

  <p>"Is this your wish or your father's?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Entirely mine," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Any night you please next week I am at your disposal. In return I have a
  favour to ask you."</p>

  <p>"A much easier matter that," she remarked, with a smile of relief.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said, "that there has always been a tenants' dinner and
  general rejoicings when a new head of the house has come to Chatfield. I may
  decide to shut the castle up very soon, but in the meantime I desire to give
  that tenants' dinner and ball. Will you all come and help me?"</p>

  <p>"That is no favour," Monica replied, promptly. "I will answer for the
  whole family. We will support you."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet, and moving to the door before he could reach it or
  stop her, departed, leaving behind only a memory of a very beautiful young
  woman, cool and sweet and dainty in her summer clothes, with the light of
  remembrance veiled in her eyes. Francis remained motionless for a moment,
  gazing at the door through which she had passed, and which he had been too
  late to reach. Eustace, entering a little abruptly, was staggered at his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"I say, old chap!" he exclaimed, "Monica hasn't been dropping any
  bombshell, has she? You look scared to death."</p>

  <p>A very ordinary world, after all, with a very ordinary young man
  confronting him. Francis turned back to his desk and lit a cigarette
  savagely.</p>

  <p>"No, I promised to do something I hate doing, that's all," he confided.
  "Don't tell Monica so, though. I shall go through with it all right."</p>

  <p>"You're coming to the family feast?" Eustace cried in some excitement.</p>

  <p>"I've promised," was the grim reply.</p>

  <p>"Good for you. It will buck the governor up tremendously. So you were down
  at Chatfield yesterday?</p>

  <p>"Your sister and I were down there together."</p>

  <p>"So I heard. Monica must have broken half a dozen engagements. Telephone
  was going for her all day long, and Bobby Halston was furious."</p>

  <p>"We had a very pleasant day," Francis said calmly.</p>

  <p>"More than I had. I went down to Newmarket and got it in the neck. I
  wonder&mdash;I hate to ask you, Francis, but I don't know what to do about
  it&mdash;I wonder whether you could lend me a few thou, just to tide over
  till Goodwood?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say I can help you somehow or other," was the equable reply. "It's
  the ready money that's the nuisance just now. I didn't find a large amount of
  cash floating about, you know, when I came into possession."</p>

  <p>"Any way you can suggest," Eustace declared anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know a chap named Ambrosius?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him about&mdash;met him once or twice on the race course,"
  Eustace assented. "They say he's a money-lender&mdash;fairly rolling in it.
  But what's the use of him to me? He wouldn't lend me anything on my note of
  hand. I've no prospects."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But he'd lend you money on very good terms if I guaranteed
  it."</p>

  <p>"Of course he would," Eustace assented enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Very well. You can go to him and say that I will guarantee up to five
  thousand pounds. I'll sign anything he sends along to that effect."</p>

  <p>Eustace sought for his cousin's hand but did not discover it. He slapped
  him instead on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You're a brick, Francis!" he exclaimed. "Gad! That's a load off my mind.
  I'll hop along and try and catch Ambrosius before luncheon time. I know where
  he hangs out, somewhere in Sackville Street."</p>

  <p>"Number fourteen," Francis announced. "Give him my compliments and tell
  him to use you well." Eustace, with his hand upon the door handle, came back
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"I say, Francis," he asked curiously, " where did you come across
  Ambrosius?"</p>

  <p>"Does that matter?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Only there's a lot of talk about the fellow. Everybody
  knew the old man, but nobody knew he had a son. It doesn't matter, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"I met him in Italy," Francis admitted. "I do not know a great deal of him
  but I think I can promise you this: if ever you should require a little
  assistance you will find him easier to deal with than most of them."</p>

  <p>"That's good enough for me," Eustace declared. "Forgive my running off,
  Francis. See you later perhaps. I shall drop into Mario's for lunch."</p>

  <p>Francis made no reply. He watched Eustace leave the room, listened to the
  closing of the door behind him. Then he turned back to the manuscripts which
  he had been studying.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch119"
     name="ch119">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SEPARATED from her knitting, no one was better able to play
the <i>grande
  dame</i> than Susan, ex-Duchess of Chatfield. Her husband was also capable of
  rising to an occasion, and Lady Monica possessed gifts which, as many people,
  including a few journalists, were never tired of saying, would some day make
  her one of the most brilliant of London hostesses. The dinner party to
  Francis, therefore, although its composition was difficult, was a complete
  success. Francis himself, though taciturn and reserved, was dignified and
  always courteous. His appearance and manners were obviously a complete
  surprise to those of his relatives who had heard the scandalous tales of his
  doings. The impression he made was universally favourable. He even accepted
  the invitation of Susan's brother, Lord Grantley, to act as his sponsor in
  the House of Lords, although he was careful to avoid fixing any exact
  date.</p>

  <p>"I must say, my dear Chatfield," the latter remarked on wishing him good
  night, "that I am delighted to hear of you at Christie's. You have bought
  several masterpieces lately, I understand, and I must congratulate you
  particularly upon the acquisition of those Rappelli manuscripts, which I
  understand that your librarian secured."</p>

  <p>"They were almost a necessity," Francis replied. "I noticed a very serious
  gap in our fourteenth-century possessions."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally," Lord Grantley observed, "I heard also that your Latin is
  wonderful. It is a great thing to have a scholar as the head of the House of
  Chatfield, an admirable corrective to any little tendency ? er&mdash;towards
  that levity of manners which is so fashionable nowadays."</p>

  <p>It was the only reference to his reputed propensities and Francis let it
  go with a smile. He did his duty to the end, remaining with his host until
  the last of the guests had departed. Lord Henry was unable to conceal his
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"My dear Francis," he said, "I do not wish to bore you, but I feel that I
  must express my complete satisfaction at your demeanour and general
  deportment this evening. It was a most auspicious introduction to your
  family. I can assure you that they are all most interested and
  gratified."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad," Francis rejoined quietly. "They seemed very worthy
  people, most of them, with whom I am not likely to be brought very much into
  contact, but if my meeting them has been any satisfaction to you and Lady
  Susan I am very glad I came."</p>

  <p>"That's capital," his uncle declared. "Capital! And as regards that little
  scheme of yours for an entertainment down at Chatfield, you can count upon us
  all. The tenants missed their ball last Christmas&mdash;we were away on the
  Riviera. So a little celebration for them will be all the more
  opportune."</p>

  <p>"You will understand," Francis warned him, "that there may be some guests
  whom you would not expect to meet in London."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, quite so!" Lord Henry acquiesced. "Not too much of that, my
  boy, before your aunt," he added in an undertone, drawing him on one side.
  "It'll be all right when the time comes. And by the bye, if you are really
  going to strike a Bohemian note, there's a little friend of mine&mdash;widow
  of a brother officer in the Yeomanry&mdash;charming little woman, but not
  exactly <i>persona grata</i> with the general run, you know."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," Francis said. "Mrs. Lois Greening, you mean,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>Lord Henry was discomposed.</p>

  <p>"How in the mischief did you guess whom I meant?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you leaving her house in John Street one day, and you were dining
  with her at Mario's another evening."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, quite possible, quite possible! The poor little woman's very
  lonely most of the time. And before you go, don't forget to look in and see
  Monica. She's downstairs somewhere: as many rooms as a rabbit warren in this
  house, but none of them big enough to swing a cat in."</p>

  <p>"Francis can spare himself the trouble, for I am here," a voice from
  behind interposed.</p>

  <p>Monica, who had changed her dress, had just sailed into the room. She was
  wearing a gown of smoke-coloured chiffon, and, contrary to her usual custom,
  a diamond star in her hair. Her maid was standing behind with a lace wrap in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"I've decided to go to the Herington's ball for an hour," she explained.
  "Ada Herington has been telephoning&mdash;says she's afraid they're short of
  girls. Would you drop me, Francis, if it isn't out of your way? It's only
  just in Park Lane."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Are you going alone, my dear?" her father asked.</p>

  <p>"I should if I wanted to," she told him. "It's no use having a reputation
  for doing daring things, unless you live up to it sometimes, and chaperons
  are rather out of date. As a matter of fact, though, Aunt Millicent is
  waiting for me there. If I'm not hurrying you, Francis, I think I ought to
  go."</p>

  <p>He handed her into the car and she sank into the further corner with a
  rustle of silks and laces. She gave a little sigh as they glided off.</p>

  <p>"What slaves we are," she murmured. "I really don't want to go to this
  silly ball at all. One gets into the way of it and then one goes on
  feverishly, always hoping that something will happen, and nothing ever
  does."</p>

  <p>"It probably will some day," he remarked tritely.</p>

  <p>"Less likely than ever now," she sighed.</p>

  <p>He moved uneasily in his place.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to say that," she continued. "I was breaking an unspoken
  compact, wasn't I? However, consider it unsaid. I want to thank you for
  tonight, Francis. I know that you came against your will; I know that for
  some mysterious reason or other, coming went all against the grain with you.
  It really won't make very much difference to you in the future, though, and
  if you knew what it saves me at home, I'm sure you'd be glad."</p>

  <p>"It was a small thing to do at your request," he said.</p>

  <p>They drew up in front of Herington House. "You wouldn't like to come in
  with me for an hour, I suppose?" she asked, somewhat wistfully. "You needn't
  dance or anything. Lady Herington is such a dear and it would make her so
  happy."</p>

  <p>"I'll come if you like," he acquiesced a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>The listlessness suddenly left her face. She smiled at him
  brilliantly.</p>

  <p>"Why, you dear thing!" she exclaimed. "How perfectly delightful! We won't
  wait for Aunt Millicent. We'll go in together and take the place by storm.
  You needn't dance, you know. There are lots of sitting-out places."</p>

  <p>"I'm not at all sure that I sha'n't want to dance," he told her. "I've had
  lessons."</p>

  <p>She indulged in a grimace.</p>

  <p>"There are scandalous stories about those lessons of yours," she remarked.
  "A hundred guineas for charity and a pearl necklace for the tip. A good many
  people would like to give you dancing lessons, Francis.&mdash;That's Lady
  Herington at the top of the stairs. Isn't she a dear? Watch her face when I
  present you."</p>

  <p>Lady Herington was without doubt overjoyed at being Francis's first
  hostess, but she was too tactful to be more than quietly cordial. They passed
  on together to the ballroom.</p>

  <p>"You're really going to dance?" Monica asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"If you'll put up with me."</p>

  <p>Francis had been well taught and there was no one on or off the stage who
  danced better than Monica. After the third dance together she led him to a
  seat. She was still clutching his arm.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure that I shall ever let you go," she laughed. "I don't
  even hate Peggy Layton any more. She taught you wonderfully. But then, after
  all, you couldn't have needed any teaching. You have such an ear for music
  and you are so strong and light on your feet. Francis, shall you ever forgive
  me? I can't help it. We're being surrounded."</p>

  <p>Francis on the whole carried himself well in a difficult situation. News
  as to the identity of this unexpected visitor flashed through the ballroom
  like wild fire, and every one trooped up to his corner. In less than a
  quarter of an hour, he knew scores of the young people in London. The elders
  were beginning to hurry up when Monica rescued him.</p>

  <p>"Dance once with Lady Betty," she begged him, "then once more with me, and
  you shall be a free lance to come or go as you will."</p>

  <p>"If Lady Betty will honour me," he said a little stiffly. "I fear that I
  am a very indifferent performer."</p>

  <p>"But you dance wonderfully," his new partner declared after the first
  turn. "Fancy Monica keeping you to herself like this. Girls are so selfish
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica is a great friend of yours?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"She is my second cousin," the girl replied. "So are you, only we'd almost
  despaired of ever seeing you in the flesh. Only last week I was told by three
  different people that you spent ten hours a day in a London monastery, that
  you had bought the Hilarity Theatre and were going on the stage, and that you
  were engaged to marry Felicia Dringe."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" he asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, all I'm going to tell you," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he confessed, "that I'm going to be a great disappointment
  to everybody."</p>

  <p>"You aren't to me," she assured him. "I'm quite certain you're not to
  Monica. You both looked frightfully pleased with each other when you left off
  dancing."</p>

  <p>"I only learned three weeks ago," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we've heard all about that too," she rejoined drily. "I don't
  suppose you've had experience enough yet to judge, but there isn't a girl on
  the stage who can dance like Monica and there isn't one half so good-looking.
  They've offered her a fortune to go on the films but she hates the stage and
  everything connected with it."</p>

  <p>"You are a very good friend of Lady Monica's," he observed.</p>

  <p>"So is any one who gets the chance," she answered. "You see, I'm bringing
  you back again as promised. I'm feeling very unselfish, though."</p>

  <p>There were a few more introductions, and then Monica claimed him. They
  danced together twice and certainly nothing connected with Lady Herington's
  ball attracted more interest than the unexpected appearance and the very
  attractive personality of this much discussed young man. They were followed
  all round the room by a buzz of whispered conversation. When at last they
  reached the door, Monica announced his release.</p>

  <p>"You have been perfectly sweet, Francis," she declared. "You can't imagine
  how much pleasure this has given me. Now, hurry off, please, before you are
  bored. There's Aunt Millicent in the corner, wondering what has become of me.
  You needn't say goodby to anybody. Just slip out and condole with yourself
  upon your dismal failure."</p>

  <p>"Failure?" he repeated dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you made up your mind to be the black sheep of the family?" she
  asked. "The one really unpopular Chatfield? Well, you've started very
  badly."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch120"
     name="ch120">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT a bore!" Monica exclaimed a few nights later at
Claridge's, as,
  after having excelled themselves in the rendering of a particularly
  intriguing waltz, the orchestra suddenly played "God Save the King."</p>

  <p>"We've only had an hour's dancing," Lady Betty complained. "Those stupid
  people would sit so long after dinner."</p>

  <p>Captain Halston, who had been Monica's partner, had a suggestion to
  make.</p>

  <p>"Let's all go on to a club," he proposed. "We could go to Mario's. That's
  quite decent. Everybody goes nowadays. What do you say, Monica?"</p>

  <p>Monica's assent in the ordinary way would have been the readiest. On this
  occasion, however, she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need mind, Monica," another of her companions
  intervened. "I was there a few nights ago with a party. As long as we're all
  together, I think it would be ripping."</p>

  <p>"Say the word and I'll go and telephone," Halston declared. "Let me see,
  how many will there be of us? Eight at least. Who's on?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of agreement. Monica alone still looked doubtful. Of
  course it was absurd, but the presentiment was there all the same. Mario's
  was supposed to be one of Francis's haunts, and she was intensely conscious
  of the fact that she would very much dislike a meeting with him there.</p>

  <p>"You'll come, Lady Monica," Halston begged. "The party wouldn't be
  anything without you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll come, of course, if all you others want to," Monica
  assented.</p>

  <p>Captain Halston hurried off to telephone and the young people fetched
  their wraps. He returned with a smiling face.</p>

  <p>"We're in luck," he announced. "It's a gala night at Mario's. Some
  Johnny's giving a big supper there. First night at the Hilarity, you know.
  They've got an extension till three-thirty. Every table's taken, but they're
  putting one in for us. It'll be all ready when we get there."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who's giving the party?" Monica asked, drawing her wrap a
  little closer around her. "Mario didn't say. You'll come in my car, won't
  you, Monica? Let's see. Franks has a car, and Judy&mdash;heaps of room for
  all of us."</p>

  <p>They started off, a party of eight eventually; Lady Monica and her escort,
  Captain Halston, Edna Halston, his sister, with Commander Perry, a young man
  up in town on three days' leave from Portsmouth, and determined to avoid
  going to bed if possible, Lady Betty and Sir George Durham, a youthful
  baronet who had just left Oxford and was studying for the Diplomatic Service,
  Judy Franks and her brother, a very popular couple, the twin children of a
  famous soldier-politician. They were a distinguished little party and Mario
  himself met them at the entrance to the restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, my lady. Good evening, gentlemen," he said, bowing. "Your
  table is all arranged, Captain Halston. We are having a great night here. I
  have been turning people away for the last hour."</p>

  <p>Inside the room the orchestra was playing a popular fox trot. The floor
  was crowded. There was a distinct atmosphere of boisterous merry-making.</p>

  <p>"Whose party is it?" Monica asked, as she prepared to follow Mario.</p>

  <p>"The Duke of Chatfield's, my lady," was the confidential reply. "A very
  excellent patron. He has engaged the whole of the tables on the right-hand
  side of the room."</p>

  <p>Monica was conscious of a sudden sense of revulsion. She would have given
  anything at that moment to be able to walk out of the place. It was too late,
  however, for Mario was already piloting them round the fringe of the maze of
  dancers, and exactly opposite to them, at the arc-shaped table against the
  wall, generally spoken of as the "Royal Box," Francis was seated, surrounded
  by a little crowd of stars in the musical-comedy world. On his right was
  Peggy Layton; on his left a French <i>danseuse</i>. Eustace was there. He
  frowned as soon as he recognised his sister.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Monica said, as she took her place, "Eustace will be furious
  with me. He always says that it is playing it low-down to come to these sort
  of places. He doesn't bring his little lot to Claridge's, he says, and we
  ought not to come here. I do feel rather horrid about it."</p>

  <p>Lady Betty sighed likewise, as she looked across the room.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too bad, Monica," she exclaimed. "It's Francis who's giving the
  party and he might have been with us. I invited him&mdash;wrote the nicest
  possible note. What do we do about it?"</p>

  <p>"If I catch Francis's eye I shall nod and wave my hand," Monica said.
  "When one comes to these places, it's the least one can do. We have to
  pretend that we don't see who he's with."</p>

  <p>"We'll all have to keep tabs on our young men," Judy Franks observed. "The
  whole of the musical-comedy stage seems to be here&mdash;and jolly nice they
  look, some of them. I think Peggy Layton's the prettiest girl I ever saw in
  my life."</p>

  <p>"So apparently does his Grace, the Duke of Chatfield," Lady Betty
  murmured, with a little grimace. "Let's dance while Bobby orders the
  supper."</p>

  <p>"Fancy being able to order champagne at one o'clock in the morning!"
  Commander Perry exclaimed. "The country's coming to its senses after all.
  Lady Monica, may I have this one?"</p>

  <p>Their small party soon settled down. Once it seemed to Monica that she
  caught Francis's eye and she looked over her partner's shoulder prepared to
  smile and wave her hand. His expression, however, was perfectly blank. He
  looked through her with stern disregard.</p>

  <p>"A fine-looking fellow, your new cousin," Perry remarked. "He doesn't look
  as though he were enjoying himself very much, though, does he? There's Peggy
  hard at him one side and Mademoiselle Cleo the other side, and half a dozen
  of them waiting to cut in, and I haven't seen him smile yet. He looks a great
  deal too much of the <i>grand seigneur</i> for this place."</p>

  <p>Somehow or other her companion's words were grateful to Monica.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," she confided, "I cannot imagine why he does it. I
  honestly don't believe he enjoys it, and he seems to have so much
  appreciation for other things. Yet they say he spends half his time here and
  at similar places, and the latest <i>canard</i> is that he's going to buy the
  lease of a theatre for Miss Layton."</p>

  <p>Monica found it rather crowded for dancing and they finished after a turn
  or two. Eustace came over presently and exchanged a few words with them. "I
  don't think it's quite playing the game," he told Monica in an undertone.
  "You people have got places enough of your own. A club like this wasn't meant
  for one's sisters. It's damned uncomfortable for every one."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," Monica replied. "I couldn't very well break up the party, though.
  Every one wanted to come."</p>

  <p>"Francis was getting quite human before you arrived," Eustace grumbled.
  "Now he's gone like a,cold saint&mdash;courteous to every one and as frigid
  as the north pole. You've spoilt the whole show." Monica laughed softly.
  Notwithstanding Eustace's disapproval, she was conscious of an absurd sense
  of satisfaction at his words.</p>

  <p>"Francis is such a peculiar chap," her brother concluded, as he turned
  away. "You can never tell how he's going to take things. After that day you
  and he had lunch together down at Chatfield and his dining at Curzon Street
  and going on with you to the Herington's, he really seemed as though he were
  going to&mdash;er ? play the game. Seeing you here is just as likely as not
  to put his back up."</p>

  <p>"My dear Eustace," Monica protested, "do you imagine for a moment that I
  should have come if I had known about this party of yours? I wouldn't have
  dreamed of coming. I know that it isn't your fault, but although I don't
  think that there is a more broad-minded person than I am in London, I'm just
  old-fashioned enough to hate to see a Duke of Chatfield dancing with musical
  comedy at Mario's. I think the young men of the Victorian epoch managed their
  peccadilloes much more gracefully than you do."</p>

  <p>"Got it in the neck," Eustace confided to the rest of them, as he took his
  departure. "I still say the boot's on the other leg. You people ought to
  stick to your own haunts."</p>

  <p>"Eustace seemed jolly bad-tempered about it," Edna Halston observed, " but
  honestly I don't see what they have to complain about. I'm sure we're most
  tactful. There are two young men at that table I know exceedingly
  well&mdash;one of them sat out for two dances with me last night and I even
  let him hold my hand, and there he sits flirting shamelessly with that
  fascinating little Clara Framlin. I pretend not to see him, and I sha'n't
  take the slightest notice of it when we meet again. So long as we don't visit
  it on them, I don't see what they have to complain of."</p>

  <p>"It's their consciences," Lady Betty declared.</p>

  <p>"Men haven't any," Judy Franks sighed. "There's Gilbert Transome over
  there. We begged him to come to-night and he assured us that he was going out
  of town."</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to dance again," Monica announced. "For some reason or
  other, there isn't such a crush just now. Bobby, you are my chosen partner
  for a waltz. Come along."</p>

  <p>They stood up together and paused, suddenly conscious of a disturbance in
  front of Francis's table. A burly man, whose evening clothes were in some
  disorder, had pushed his way through the crowded room and was leaning over
  Francis towards Peggy Layton. Halston frowned as he recognised him.</p>

  <p>"That's Burton. Used to be in my regiment," he whispered to Monica. "A bad
  lot, I am afraid, and a quarrelsome fellow. He's Peggy Layton's husband They
  separated some time ago."</p>

  <p>Monica felt the colour leave her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I do hope there isn't going to be trouble!" she exclaimed. "Can't you do
  something, Bobby?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's rather difficult to interfere," he pointed out. "However, I'll
  see."</p>

  <p>He moved a little nearer. Burton was talking angrily to Peggy, who was
  distinctly terrified. Mario came hurrying up and touched Burton on the
  shoulder, but he thrust him on one side.</p>

  <p>"I'm a member of this Club and I've a perfect right to come in," he
  insisted. "I want my wife. Are you ready to come along with me?"</p>

  <p>"You know I'm not," Peggy answered. "I don't want to have anything to do
  with you."</p>

  <p>He looked at her wickedly.</p>

  <p>"If you think I'm going to have you knocking about town with any fellow
  who chooses to ask you to supper, you're wrong," he went on truculently.
  "Come along with me and talk it over, or there'll be trouble here."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't move a yard with you," Peggy Layton declared. "Can't some one
  get help or something?" Francis rose slowly to his feet. He was as tall as
  the intruder, but he seemed slimmer than ever in his well-tailored clothes.
  Burton's dinner coat was crumpled, his shirt protruded and his black tie had
  wandered out of its place.</p>

  <p>"I do not know who you are, sir," Francis said, "but you are making
  yourself offensive to one of my guests. I must ask you to withdraw."</p>

  <p>"Withdraw be damned!" was the angry reply. "I don't know who you are
  either, and don't want to. This lady is my wife, and I shall talk to her just
  as long as it pleases me."</p>

  <p>Francis looked coldly past him.</p>

  <p>"Mario," he directed, "this person must be removed."</p>

  <p>Mario, who was a small man, hesitated. He touched Burton once more upon
  the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"If you do not come away quietly, sir," he warned him, " I must send for
  the police."</p>

  <p>Burton laughed hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Who cares for your police?" he jeered. "The police can't come between a
  man and his wife. Now then, Peggy."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward and grabbed at her wrist. Without actually striking him,
  Francis held him away from the table. Burton's heavy face was suddenly full
  of an unholy satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"So that's your game, is it?" he exclaimed. "Take that!"</p>

  <p>He aimed a blow at Francis which the latter easily avoided.</p>

  <p>"You had better go," Francis advised. "Mario has sent for assistance, and
  I shall not in any case permit you to interfere with any of my guests."</p>

  <p>"You won't permit, you!"</p>

  <p>He rushed at Francis whose right arm went out like a piston rod. For a
  moment Burton staggered. Then he collapsed upon the floor. There was a little
  murmur from the spectators; a scream from Peggy Layton. Francis, after a
  glance at the fallen man, resumed his seat. Two commissionaires came hurrying
  up the room. Still only half-conscious, Burton was hustled away. The music
  recommenced. A few of the people&mdash;Monica amongst them&mdash;danced. When
  the music stopped, however, she turned to her escort.</p>

  <p>"I think I should like to go home," she announced. "I'm inclined to agree
  with Eustace. I do not think that this is the place for us."</p>

  <p>"A scene like this might have happened anywhere," Halston pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Somehow, it doesn't seem to me that it would have mattered so much
  anywhere else."</p>

  <p>"Don't break up the party," Lady Betty begged.</p>

  <p>"Everybody else is going on as usual," Halston urged.</p>

  <p>Monica shrugged her shoulders. She was leaning back in her chair, fanning
  herself, still unnaturally pale but with a curious glitter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit outside for a minute, then," she said to Halston. "I can't
  bear the atmosphere here."</p>

  <p>They passed together across the crowded floor and out into the little
  entrance hall. There was a settee at the further end upon which Monica
  subsided.</p>

  <p>"If you would really rather go home," her companion suggested, "I might
  take you now and come back again."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone for a few minutes, please."</p>

  <p>A police inspector was standing just inside the entrance door, talking to
  Mario. After a time the latter unwillingly turned away and entered the
  restaurant, reappearing in a few minutes, followed by Francis. The police
  inspector stepped forward and saluted, asked a few questions, the answers to
  which he took down in his pocketbook and withdrew. Francis would have passed
  Monica and Halston without notice, but the former sprang suddenly to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Francis!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He paused at once and bowed. There was something indicative of strain in
  the attitude of both of them as they stood facing one another. Monica's tone
  was unusually cold.</p>

  <p>"Francis, I wish to speak to you for a moment," she said. "Will you walk
  upstairs with me to the balcony?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he assented coldly. "You will remember, however, that I have
  guests."</p>

  <p>"We have all been made aware of that," she answered. "I shall not keep you
  for more than a minute. Wait for me, Bobby," she added, looking over her
  shoulder towards Halston.</p>

  <p>The corner of the balcony which they entered was almost deserted. Monica
  suddenly turned to her companion. Her mood seemed to have changed; her tone
  was almost soft; the angry light had left her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she remonstrated, "must you do these things?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he replied, "that I was somewhat the victim of
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Such things mean little to you, I know," she went on, "but do you realise
  what it means to us who have been proud of the name to find the head of the
  House of Chatfield entertaining the lighter half of the stage at a night
  club, dancing publicly with these young women and becoming the central figure
  in a disreputable brawl?"</p>

  <p>"I fear that I am something of an individualist," he answered stiffly. "I
  live the life I prefer, to please myself. The claims of my family, I admit,
  have not much weight. " "If I believed you, Francis," she said, "I suppose
  that would be the end of it&mdash;but I don't; I don't believe you enjoy
  being with this class of people. I don't believe you enjoy brawling with a
  drunkard in public. I believe you have all the finer feelings we should love
  you to have, and for some reason or other you crush them down and turn a
  false front to the world. Francis, can no one help you? Must you go on like
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I live the life I choose," was the doggedly persistent reply.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is only half the truth," she declared, "and you know it. I didn't
  mean to speak to you again about this. If you knew how hard it was! And we
  are all pensioners on your bounty too, which makes it worse! If you were
  different, I shouldn't mind, but you aren't yourself with these people. You
  are not of their world. You try to force yourself into it, but you can't.
  Francis, I want nothing for myself&mdash;not even your
  kindness&mdash;nothing, even for my family? j but don't waste your life. I'm
  not pleading with you because it hurts me personally to see you with these
  people, but because it is unjust to yourself, unworthy of you. I haven't a
  scrap of orthodox religion in me, Francis, but I do believe in the parable of
  the talents: the gifts entrusted to us are to be made the best of j and not
  the worst."</p>

  <p>Monica was her old self again; tender, human, with a note even of
  affection in her tone. Francis, save for one faint trembling of the lips,
  seemed to have drawn even further aloof.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he said," but you have a wrong conception of my
  character. The life which I lead pleases me. I have no intention of altering
  it."</p>

  <p>"I am to give you up, then, as an insoluble enigma?" she asked
  wistfully.</p>

  <p>"No enigma at all," he answered. "Just an ugly fact."</p>

  <p>She turned away, a little crushed by a sense of failure, and descended the
  stairs alone to where Halston was waiting for her. They entered the
  restaurant and began to dance with scarcely a word. Up in the balcony Francis
  stood like a graven image, looking down upon the scene. His own table was by
  far the most uproarious. Eustace had taken his place and Peggy Layton,
  recovered from her fright, was leaning over him, rocking with laughter at a
  story which he had just been telling. Their table was littered with empty
  bottles and cigar ash. One young man with ruffled hair was lounging back in
  his place, his arm through his companion's. From where he stood he could hear
  Peggy's shrieks of laughter, and for a single moment he shrank back. A wave
  of mental nausea nearly drove him from the place. Then he recovered himself.
  A few minutes later he resumed his seat at the head of the table, an urbane
  if a somewhat silent host.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch121"
     name="ch121">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHATFIELD Castle, on the night finally fixed upon for the
celebrations,
  was ablaze with light from floor to ceiling. There were fairy lamps along the
  terrace and in the courtyard; the garage, stables and coach house were
  packed, and far down the avenue were ranged an amazing collection of farmers'
  carts, bicycles, char-a-bancs and motor cars of every description. Francis,
  Duke of Chatfield, was at home to the whole of his tenants and their friends
  and there was scarcely a farmer within thirty miles who was not partaking of
  his hospitality. It was hospitality absolutely without restrictions. Every
  room in the castle was thrown open. Amos, the head keeper, bent but vigorous
  at seventy, and Mr. Grimes, a farmer, and his brother-in-law, had found their
  way by Francis's special invitation into the great library, where, as in
  almost every other room, a plentiful supply of wines, cigars and refreshments
  of every description were set out upon an improvised sideboard. The two men
  were exchanging confidences.</p>

  <p>"If one might make so bold now, Mr. Amos," his companion began, "you being
  a man of the world and a close observer of all sorts, what be the conclusions
  you've arrived at concerning the present Dook?"</p>

  <p>"The Squire," Amos corrected doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Squire if you maun call him so," Grimes conceded, "though Dook he is,
  which is a higher title."</p>

  <p>"I'm agin you there. Mr. Grimes," Amos insisted, "but on a night like
  this, when all is festivity and agreeableness, I'm not for holding out agin
  any man's views. The master I serve is the 'Squire' to me, and 'Squire' he
  maun be whether he be Marquis or Dook or any other title. And if you want my
  opinion of the present 'un, seeing as I'm sitting here drinking his champagne
  wine and smoking his cigars, and remembering the way he killed them
  partridges this afternoon&mdash;him who didn't know what a partridge drive
  was till the present saison&mdash;why, I say he's all right, Mr. Grimes. He's
  all that a gentleman should be."</p>

  <p>"He's liberal-handed for sure," Grimes admitted, "but he's ways about him
  that surely do puzzle one."</p>

  <p>"It is a family that's not without their weaknesses, Mr. Grimes," Amos
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Surely that be so," the farmer agreed. "They do say up in London that
  he's the biggest spender of any Chatfield since the days of King George the
  third. I'm not like you, Mr. Amos, what's only been here for a matter of
  thirty years or so. I was born and bred here&mdash;sixty-two years have I
  lived at Chatfield&mdash;but such spending I never did see nor never shall
  again. Six hundred there were sat down to-night and one hundred of the gentry
  in the banqueting hall, and Mr. Johnson, he told me himself, that the same
  champagne was served to every one. Why, that ballroom has never been half
  full before, that I've seen, but to-night there's no moving in it."</p>

  <p>"The Squire, he do be open-handed for sure," Amos acquiesced. "They say in
  London too that with his new four-in-hand, the racing stable he's starting,
  the young ladies he takes a fancy to and suchlike luxuries, he do make the
  money fly."</p>

  <p>"And him brought up in a convent, as folks do say," Grimes
  sighed&mdash;"leastways a monastery, which is the same thing&mdash;only for
  men,"</p>

  <p>"Powerful religious he maun be," Amos muttered.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that he ain't got rid of it," Grimes declared. "It be the
  same with all of us. When I was a little lad I was licked for to go to church
  and Sunday school. It kind of cured me for such diversions later on."</p>

  <p>Francis and Monica entered through the open French windows. The two men
  rose at once to their feet but Francis waved them back into their places.</p>

  <p>"Please don't disturb yourselves," he begged "Lady Monica and I are only
  passing through."</p>

  <p>"Amos, you're in disgrace," Monica told him. "You've a partner down in the
  ballroom looking everywhere for you."</p>

  <p>The gamekeeper rose once more to his feet, suddenly
  conscience-stricken.</p>

  <p>"That would be Mrs. Foules, for sure," he confided, "and I thank your
  ladyship for reminding me. Mrs. Foules do be a hot-tempered lady and I'm not
  wishing to give her cause of offence."</p>

  <p>"You're being looked after all right, I hope," Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Never better, your Grace," Grimes replied fervently. "Begging your
  Grace's pardon and Lady Monica's, I'll watch Mr. Amos on the floor."</p>

  <p>The two men hastened off. Francis glanced around the room which was now
  empty.</p>

  <p>"Why not rest here for a few minutes, Monica?" he suggested. "You must be
  tired."</p>

  <p>She sank into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Sheer laziness," she confessed. "As a matter of fact, I don't think I
  ever felt less tired."</p>

  <p>"You've been doing your duty nobly," he said, sitting down opposite
  her.</p>

  <p>"Some of those dances were rather terrible," she admitted with a smile.
  "Especially the one-step with Mr. Smiles the blacksmith. That last waltz,
  though, made me feel quite young again. You really dance beautifully,
  Francis. It is amazing that you should have only just learnt."</p>

  <p>"I am flattered," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, how does it seem to you to play the great landowner?" she asked.
  "Your ideas of entertaining are certainly princely."</p>

  <p>"These things are not done on a small scale, I suppose," he replied
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that you do seems to be done on a small scale, especially in
  London. You are bringing the grey hairs into Sir Stephen's head."</p>

  <p>"I have some years of parsimony to make up for," he observed drily.</p>

  <p>Monica was silent for a few moments. She was looking at the empty space
  above the chimney piece from which the picture of the late Duke had been
  removed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's no concern of mine, I suppose," she admitted, "especially as I
  and my family profit by your bountiful ideas."</p>

  <p>Francis frowned.</p>

  <p>"The various allowances of which you and your family are in receipt," he
  said stiffly, "are natural charges upon the estate. They come not from me but
  from the head of the house. There is nothing personal about them at all. I
  don't like them alluded to even by you, Monica."</p>

  <p>She relapsed again into thoughtfulness.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that I had quite a wonderful offer of marriage last week,"
  she confided.</p>

  <p>"Halston?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry him?"</p>

  <p>"Because, although he's a dear fellow, he bores me to death. Only one
  thing makes me hesitate even for a second."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?"</p>

  <p>"I should no longer be a pensioner of yours."</p>

  <p>"The word is ill-chosen," he replied harshly. "You are a Chatfield and an
  infinitesimal share of the Chatfield money comes to you automatically."</p>

  <p>"One can't argue about the matter," she said. "I know how I feel. But,
  Francis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I decided not long ago," she continued, "that I would never speak to you
  on any serious subject again. If it were for my own sake I would not even
  now. But, do you know, I am more worried than ever about Eustace."</p>

  <p>"About Eustace? Why, what is wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"You are too kind to him," she declared, "too good and generous
  altogether. Eustace is rather a weak young man and you treat him so
  wonderfully that he doesn't quite know where he is. You encourage him to live
  just as though his income were the same as yours. That isn't good for him,
  Francis."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" he observed indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I know just what Dad is allowing him, and he must be
  spending heaps more. He can only do it by getting into debt&mdash;yours or
  somebody else's. Eustace, I'm afraid, so long as he finds money easy to get
  hold of, is one of those people who will go on spending without thinking. It
  would be ever so much better for him if he had to work."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you would find your views very popular with him."</p>

  <p>"I dare say not, but it's the truth all the same. Then I think you're far
  too easy with Dad. I'm absolutely certain that he spends more than your very
  generous allowance. You seem to encourage both of them to think that the
  Chatfield coffers are theirs to dig into whenever they please."</p>

  <p>"How long have you been saving up this scolding for me?" Francis
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't consider it a scolding, please," she begged, "or I shall feel
  ashamed of myself. It's all because you're so generous and
  kind&mdash;Heavens! I'm engaged for this dance, and to Mr. Beldane, too, the
  chief tenant. Don't bother to come with me, Francis. I shall find him all
  right."</p>

  <p>She hurried away. Francis closed the door after her and strolled back to
  his place. The echo of her last few words seemed to be drumming against his
  ears. A queer generosity, his! He stood gazing at that empty space on the
  wall with darkening face. The sound of approaching voices came almost as a
  relief. He turned away and stepped out on to the terrace, just as Lady Susan
  entered on Amos's arm, with Lord Henry and Sir Stephen following.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think we've all done our duty pretty well," the latter observed.
  "A quiet whisky and soda and a rubber of bridge would be about the thing
  now."</p>

  <p>Amos conducted Lady Susan to a seat and bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I am greatly obliged to your ladyship for the honour," he said.</p>

  <p>Lady Susan smiled and brought out her knitting. "Great fun, wasn't it,
  Amos? If your left knee didn't creak so much and I were a stone or two
  lighter, we should be a wonderful pair. Don't forget your dance with Lady
  Monica."</p>

  <p>"I'll be keeping her in view, my lady," Amos replied as he left the
  room.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen helped himself to a drink and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, these are very wonderful festivities," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful indeed," Lord Henry assented. "How that young man," he went on
  earnestly, "brought up as he was, has learnt what I may call the higher arts
  of extravagance, I cannot imagine!"</p>

  <p>"It is in the blood," Lady Susan sighed without looking up from her
  knitting.</p>

  <p>"There have been spendthrift Chatfields, of course," Sir Stephen
  continued, with a note of gravity in his tone, "as there have been with most
  of our great families, but this present young man shows signs of outstripping
  any of the records of your house. I have already felt it my duty to comment
  on his rate of expenditure."</p>

  <p>"How did he take it?" Lord Henry asked.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell. He just laughed."</p>

  <p>"He's an enigma, this young relative of ours," his uncle mused. "A
  complete enigma! Here's Ambrosius," he went on, as the door opened and
  Ambrosius and Monica appeared. Will you make us up for a rubber of bridge,
  Mr. Ambrosius?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged but I would rather not," he said. "Bridge is not a
  favourite game of mine, and our host has asked me to try and get up a table
  of poker."</p>

  <p>"I hate poker," Monica exclaimed. "I hope Eustace won't play."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I cannot agree with you, Lady Monica," Ambrosius
  observed. "Poker is, in my estimation, the finest of all card games. There is
  scope for imagination, courage, memory and <i>sang froid</i>."</p>

  <p>"It is also a game in which the longest purse must win," Sir Stephen
  commented drily.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of voices upon the terrace and presently Francis and
  Felicia Dringe entered. Felicia, contrary to her usual custom, was wearing
  the costume almost of a professional dancer; a black shawl twisted around her
  body and a red rose in her hair. Monica watched her entrance with cold
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"How's the poker table getting on, Ambrosius?" Francis enquired. "Mrs.
  Dringe wants to play. Halston and Lady Betty are coming and Lord Eustace.
  That makes five with yourself. Is that enough?"</p>

  <p>"Five is a very good number," Ambrosius assented. Lady Susan replaced the
  knitting in her bag.</p>

  <p>"I think, my dear," she said to her husband, "that as Francis would
  doubtless be glad of a few minutes' rest, it would be as well if we were to
  return to the ballroom. The people all appreciate it so much more if some of
  the family are present."</p>

  <p>"You are very considerate," Francis observed, as he opened the door.</p>

  <p>Monica drew him on one side, as he turned to rejoin the others.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she begged, "I wish you'd keep Eustace out of the poker
  table."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"He loses his head so," she explained. "And he scarcely ever wins. I know
  he's been having a bad time lately. He simply cannot afford to lose any
  more." Francis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"They will only play a small game," he assured her. "Besides, how can I
  keep him out? He is a guest and he asked particularly for a game."</p>

  <p>"I hate to seem a spoilsport," Monica said doubtfully, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off abruptly as Eustace came hurriedly in. He was mopping his
  forehead and he helped himself at once to whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"I'm not too late, am I?" he asked. "I've been running round fat Mrs.
  Grimes in the lancers. Tophole fellow that new second footman of yours,
  Francis. He did set the pace, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"You're sure you want to play, Eustace?" his host enquired. "I can easily
  find another to make up the table."</p>

  <p>"Want to!" Eustace exclaimed, setting down his glass and lighting a
  cigarette. "I've been looking forward to it all the evening. What's it going
  to be, Ambrosius?"</p>

  <p>"A pound, three pounds, five pounds ante. Anything you like. What do you
  say, Lady Betty?" he asked, as she entered the room with Halston.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't let's gamble," she begged. "A sovereign ante's quite
  enough."</p>

  <p>"And five-pound rises?" Ambrosius suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, just let's double," Lady Betty proposed.</p>

  <p>"Those five-pound rises from you rich men come expensive every time."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius smiled covertly as he apportioned out the chips.</p>

  <p>"Just as you like," he agreed. "Here are twenty pounds' worth for
  everybody."</p>

  <p>They all took their places at the table. Francis seated himself by
  Monica's side on the couch.</p>

  <p>"Well, as long as Eustace must play," his sister observed, " I'm glad he's
  got a moderate game."</p>

  <p>"Moderate?" Francis repeated doubtfully. "I know very little about poker,
  but I should have thought under certain circumstances that the doubling game
  was more dangerous than any other."</p>

  <p>"Not unless two colossal hands get against each other," Monica rejoined.
  "I don't think there's any one there would go in for fireworks unless Eustace
  lost his head."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ambrosius, they tell me, is a very fine gambler," Francis
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"A fine gambler very seldom bets high on one hand. Francis, I'm sorry you
  had Felicia down here."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She smiled at him with uplifted eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual reason, I suppose. It isn't my business, I know, but she is
  a little blatant the way she runs after you."</p>

  <p>"She's very good-natured. She danced three times for the tenantry this
  evening."</p>

  <p>"I never doubted her good nature," Monica remarked drily. "All the same, I
  do wish that you weren't quite so friendly with her."</p>

  <p>"I find her an amusing companion," Francis observed. "There are so many
  places it is difficult for a man to visit alone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose, if you must have a companion of that sort, she's as good
  as any other. It is queer what mistakes one may make, Francis. I remember
  that first day I saw you in England when you came here, I thought that the
  best thing that could happen to you would be to mix with other young men of
  your own age, like Eustace, and live their life for a time. And now I am
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you have been through it all and it doesn't seem to have altered
  you," she explained, rather hesitatingly. "You have leaned over the flames
  but the furnace of life doesn't seem to have warmed even the tips of your
  fingers. You might just as well have remained that absorbed and rather
  attractive creature whom I remember on the ramparts at Pellini."</p>

  <p>"In other words, I'm a disappointment."</p>

  <p>"A shocking disappointment," she confessed. "You sow your wild oats too
  deliberately. You pour all the time the bitters of cynicism into the wine of
  living. I believe that I would rather after all that you had done as we
  feared and founded that monastery."</p>

  <p>Eustace, who was momentarily out of the game, came over towards them.</p>

  <p>"You two seem to be having a heart-to-heart talk," he observed.</p>

  <p>"How is it going, Eustace?" his sister enquired, regarding him a trifle
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"So, so! A nice quiet game. I've won about thirty pounds up to now."</p>

  <p>"Who's the loser?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>"May he continue to be!" Monica prayed.</p>

  <p>Francis looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like Mr. Ambrosius?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any feeling about him either way," she replied. "Ought I to
  have?"</p>

  <p>"Good fellow, Ambrosius," Eustace declared. "Jolly useful too, at
  times."</p>

  <p>"Are you in, Eustace?" some one asked from the table.</p>

  <p>He returned to his place. Monica and Francis rose and strolled over to
  watch a hand. Ambrosius looked at his cards and then glanced round the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Let me see," he murmured. "Every one in for two pounds, eh? I will make
  it four to play."</p>

  <p>"I make it eight," Eustace said when it came to his turn.</p>

  <p>Lady Betty studied her cards.</p>

  <p>"What a nuisance," she complained. "I'll have to come in, though."</p>

  <p>"Sixteen to play," Ambrosius announced.</p>

  <p>"I'm in," Felicia assented.</p>

  <p>"I'm not," Halston declared, throwing his cards into the middle of the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-two to play," from Eustace.</p>

  <p>Lady Betty sighed and threw in her cards.</p>

  <p>"You are a pig, Eustace," she exclaimed. "I had a beautiful pair."</p>

  <p>"I fear that I must make it sixty-four," Ambrosius observed.</p>

  <p>Felicia also abandoned her hand.</p>

  <p>"Beyond me," she sighed. "All the same, I hate being bluffed out."</p>

  <p>"There is no bluff about this," Eustace assured her. "I am making it a
  hundred and twenty-eight."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and twenty-eight pounds without drawing cards is quite a large
  amount," Ambrosius declared. "I must raise you again, Lord Eustace, but I
  shall not go to the limit. Two hundred pounds to play."</p>

  <p>"Four hundred," Eustace retorted.</p>

  <p>Lady Monica touched her host on the arm. She looked at him appealingly,
  but he only shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We can't interfere," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred," Ambrosius announced.</p>

  <p>Eustace looked at his cards once more, laid them down again and puffed
  vigorously at his cigar.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds to play!"</p>

  <p>Ambrosius shrugged his shoulders and bowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"It is enough," he confessed. "How many cards, Lord Eustace?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius laid down the pack which he had been holding, looked through his
  own cards again, carefully selected one and threw it into the middle. Then he
  drew the one to which he was entitled from the top of the pack, and, without
  looking at it, placed it on the table face downward, a little distance away
  from his remaining four cards.</p>

  <p>"Your bet, Lord Eustace," he reminded his antagonist.</p>

  <p>"I make it two thousand pounds," Eustace proclaimed, with a quiver in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>Ambrosius made a wry face. He tapped his hidden card for a moment with his
  forefinger as though about to look at it, but changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"I shall raise you one thousand, making it three thousand."</p>

  <p>Eustace hesitated for a moment. Of the two men, he was by far the most
  agitated. Greed and hope shone out of his face. Even his fingers
  twitched.</p>

  <p>"I'll follow your example," he declared. "I'll raise you a thousand only.
  I make it four thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius stroked his chin. He had the air of a man placed in a humorous
  predicament.</p>

  <p>"As I am in some slight uncertainty as to my fifth card, Lord Eustace," he
  decided finally, "I will see you at four thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Eustace threw his hand triumphantly upon the table.</p>

  <p>"We apparently both have fours," he exclaimed. "Mine are aces."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius contemplated the four aces and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid in any case," he confessed, "that I am beaten. For some
  reason or other, I felt like a little gamble. But see how tempting," he
  added, throwing his cards, one by one, upon the table. "I was dealt the two,
  three, four, five of spades. Your ace of spades reduces my chances. The six
  of spades is the only card that can save me. It is almost too much to hope
  for."</p>

  <p>His fingers toyed with the fifth card, lifted it, and threw it face
  upwards upon the table. There was a moment's intense silence; then a chorus
  of exclamations.</p>

  <p>The card was the six of spades.</p>

  <p>"A most amazing draw," Ambrosius admitted, leaning back in his chair. "A
  small royal flush."</p>

  <p>Eustace sat for a moment speechless. The life seemed to die out of him. He
  stared at the fateful card with absolutely unseeing eyes. Then the murmurs of
  commiseration seemed to madden him. He sprang to his feet and struck the
  table with his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>"It's a swindle!" he shouted. "I ought to have known better than to have
  played with a damned Greek!"</p>

  <p>There was another silence almost as pregnant with sensation as the first.
  Then Ambrosius rose slowly to his feet. He presented almost a dignified
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Lord Eustace," he said, "you forget yourself."</p>

  <p>Eustace turned wildly to the onlookers.</p>

  <p>"You all saw!" he exclaimed. "You heard the betting. He must have known
  the next card. I tell you that he must have known. Who in the world would go
  up to a thousand pounds without drawing a card, on the two, three, four, five
  of a suit alone. The thing's ridiculous. What do you say, Halston?"</p>

  <p>"I say that you're making an ass of yourself," Halston replied coldly. "I
  have known men go to a great deal of money on a double-ended straight flush.
  Certainly I am not surprised that Mr. Ambrosius found it worth a thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>Eustace glared at him.</p>

  <p>"All right, then," he continued violently, "if he was lunatic enough to do
  that, what about the betting afterwards? He never even looked at his fifth
  card. He went up to four thousand pounds and he never even looked to see
  whether he was backing a worthless hand. He must have known what that fifth
  card was."</p>

  <p>The onlookers were beginning to recover from their stupor.</p>

  <p>"I was sitting next Mr. Ambrosius," Felicia announced. "I saw him deal. I
  saw him afterwards announce that he was going to take one card, and take the
  top card in its due turn."</p>

  <p>"And I shuffled the cards," Halston observed drily.</p>

  <p>"My methods at poker may not appeal to you, Lord Eustace," Ambrosius said,
  "but they are my own, and if I choose to risk a few thousand pounds on the
  turn of a card it is my affair. It happens that I can afford to do so."</p>

  <p>"There has been enough of this," Francis intervened. "Eustace, you are in
  the wrong. You had better admit it and offer your apologies to Mr.
  Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>Eustace sat with folded arms, breathing heavily, speechless. Mr. Ambrosius
  calmly collected the chips from the players and redeemed them with money.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what I said, Eustace?" his cousin persisted.</p>

  <p>"Four aces pat, and lose on them!" Eustace mumbled. "Was there ever such
  foul luck?"</p>

  <p>"The fortune or the ill fortune of the game is another affair," Francis
  said curtly. "I require you to apologise to my guest, Mr. Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>Eustace staggered to his feet. His fists were both clenched tightly. He
  looked around as though for sympathy, and found only disdain.</p>

  <p>"Your cousin is quite right, Eustace," Halston declared. "It was a
  magnificent gamble on the part of Mr. Ambrosius. I doubt whether any one else
  whom I know would have had the pluck. He brought it off. Your accusations are
  simply ridiculous."</p>

  <p>The young man, confronted with an entire lack of sympathy, had no longer
  any alternative. He drew himself up and faced the music.</p>

  <p>"I apologise, Mr. Ambrosius," he said. "It was a maddening thing to lose
  with my hand and your draw. I hope you will remember that in excuse for
  anything which I may have said. I am sorry I lost my temper."</p>

  <p>"I accept your apology with pleasure, Lord Eustace," Ambrosius replied.
  "The incident shall be forgotten. As regards the bet, we will call it off. It
  was, after all, only a game between friends."</p>

  <p>That is quite impossible," Francis interposed sternly.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Eustace echoed without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Ambrosius rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am quite at your disposal," he announced. "Pay me then when it suits
  your convenience. You will excuse me, however, from continuing with the
  game."</p>

  <p>The little company drifted towards the door. Francis laid his hand upon
  Ambrosius's arm.</p>

  <p>"I will follow you all directly," he promised, turning to the others. "I
  want to have just a word with our friend here."</p>

  <p>They trooped out. In a few moments the two men were alone. Francis closed
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Ambrosius," he began, "listen to me. You know perfectly well what my
  wishes are with regard to Lord Eustace."</p>

  <p>"I know what I understood them to be," was the cool reply. "I was to win
  as much money as I could from him."</p>

  <p>"In addition to which," Francis went on, " you were to make it as easy as
  possible for him to borrow from you and as difficult as possible to
  repay."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, I have never suggested any actual act of knavery. If I
  believed that you were capable of such under my roof and under such
  conditions, our connection would be at an end. Was there any truth in Lord
  Eustace's charge?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," Ambrosius protested suavely. "How was it possible? You
  saw the play of the cards. I took what seemed to be a great risk, but what
  did it matter if I had lost? The young man already owes me money from which I
  could have deducted it, and every week he will lose more at my <i>chemie</i>
  parties."</p>

  <p>"You did not manipulate the cards, then, in any way?" Francis
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Ambrosius assured him.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it. Remember my instructions with regard to that young
  man and his father still hold good. What I wish brought about, however, must
  be brought about my own way. They must always have their chance if they are
  men enough to take it. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Without wishing in the least to interrupt this conversation," Felicia
  observed, looking in from the terrace window, "do you know, my dear host,
  that you haven't danced with me once?"</p>

  <p>"Give me the pleasure now," Francis begged. "It is quite time I went back
  into the ballroom. Follow us as soon as you feel disposed, Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>They left the room. Ambrosius watched their departure with imperturbable
  face. After a moment's pause he went to the sideboard, helped himself to a
  whisky and soda, and carried it back to the card table. Then he lit a
  cigarette and took up a pack of cards.</p>

  <p>"The king of clubs," he said to himself. He took what seemed to be the top
  card and threw it on the table. It was the king of clubs.</p>

  <p>"The two of hearts."</p>

  <p>He repeated the performance. The card which apparently came from the top
  of the pack was the two of hearts.</p>

  <p>"The six of spades."</p>

  <p>Again he held a card for a moment in the air, then threw it on to the
  table. It was the six of spades. He looked up to the ceiling and smiled
  blandly.</p>

  <p>"So easy!" he murmured.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch201"
     name="ch201">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SIR Stephen sipped his wine and set down the glass
reverently.</p>

  <p>"The 'seventy'!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I'm still not a judge of port," Francis confessed. "Johnson
  knew that you were coming and I left it to him."</p>

  <p>"Johnson," the lawyer declared, " is a man of sound judgment."</p>

  <p>The two men were dining alone at Chatfield House. Ten empty chairs were
  ranged around the long table in somewhat ghostly fashion. The lights were
  thrown upon the table only, for it was a warm June evening and the windows
  were opened out upon the square.</p>

  <p>"It is ten months to-day," Sir Stephen reflected, "since you celebrated
  your home-coming at Chatfield Castle."</p>

  <p>"Time flies," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Especially time which is crowded with incident," his companion ventured.
  "Your life during those ten months has been very full of incident."</p>

  <p>"I have made up for the lost years a little."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it almost time," Sir Stephen suggested gravely, " that you called a
  halt?"</p>

  <p>"Is this the beginning of my lecture?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen finished the contents of his glass and refilled it with a
  steady hand.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace," he reminded his host, "it is at your request that the few
  words I have to say are said at your own board and not at my office.
  Nevertheless I should not be doing my duty if they remained unsaid."</p>

  <p>"This, I presume," Francis remarked, "is a continuation of the lecture
  which you commenced early one morning many months ago. Well, go ahead, Sir
  Stephen. I quite realise that it is your duty to remonstrate with me. I shall
  take another glass of port to fortify myself and listen in all due
  humility."</p>

  <p>"When you succeeded to the property," the lawyer said, "the income from
  the land, the quarries, mines and suchlike, produced a sum of something like
  fifty thousand a year. Added to this there were funds, judiciously invested,
  amounting to between six and seven hundred thousand pounds. There was no
  mortgage upon the lands, and, in justice to your predecessors, I will say
  this, not even Lord Henry, during his period of control, at any time ever
  suggested the realisation of even a part of these investments. They were
  looked upon by him and his predecessors as funds belonging to no one
  personally but to the family, providing the necessary income for keeping up
  the position of one of England's great houses. Lord Henry was a very
  extravagant man. Nevertheless, somehow or other he avoided ever touching that
  money."</p>

  <p>"Very praiseworthy of him, I'm sure," Francis murmured.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace," Sir Stephen continued sternly, "the present condition of the
  finances of the House of Chatfield is deplorable. It seems to me to spell
  nothing less than ruin. Technically speaking, you are within your rights in
  dispersing these funds and destroying the solid foundation upon which your
  house stands. As a matter of family honour, I venture to say to you that you
  are committing a sin."</p>

  <p>Francis's lips curled in a smile of faint amusement. In the subdued light
  his face looked longer and paler than ever. Dissipation, if the prevalent
  rumours concerning him were true, had certainly not impaired his physique. He
  had still the lean, hard features of a man of careful life. His mouth was
  firm; his eyes brilliant.</p>

  <p>"What," he asked, "is the extent of my enormity? I find figures so
  difficult to carry in my mind."</p>

  <p>"In twelve months," the lawyer said, "you have spent, in addition to the
  whole income accruing to you, three hundred thousand pounds of the capital
  invested for the good of the house."</p>

  <p>"Not bad for one year. You must remember, however, that a hundred thousand
  went to found that Roman Catholic College."</p>

  <p>"That," Sir Stephen admitted, "was a contingency that we were prepared to
  face. The ugly fact remains that during twelve months you have spent three
  hundred and fifty thousand pounds and, if you will forgive my pointing it
  out, there are no signs at present of any diminution in your
  expenditure."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must be trying to strike an average," Francis observed. "You
  see, I lived for a great many years with two or three lira a week for pocket
  money &mdash;when it could be spared. I remember," he went on reminiscently,
  "quite well the time when I had positively no clothes. My father, in the
  course of one of his short visits, had left behind a few articles of attire.
  They were cut down for me, rather, I remember, to the amusement of my
  companions&mdash;the sons of the local innkeeper and general merchant.
  Perhaps that is what makes me rather extravagant at my tailor's
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"These things are trifles," Sir Stephen declared irritably.</p>

  <p>"Trifles sometimes have a significance," Francis rejoined. "They point the
  way, you know. Still, proceed, please. I am here to listen to all that you
  have to say."</p>

  <p>"I and my father before me," the lawyer went on, "and his uncle before
  that, have been the financial guardians of the House of Chatfield. That is
  why I have to speak to you in such very plain words. If you go on as you have
  been going, you will bring ruin upon the house and every one connected with
  your family. Why indulge, your Grace, in such reckless extravagance? Your
  income, although henceforth it will be reduced, is still an excellent one.
  Life is full of attractions for young men of your position, which do not
  necessarily involve the expenditure of these colossal sums of money. You
  have, they tell me, a natural aptitude for all sports; you can shoot, fish,
  hunt"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Francis interrupted. "I forgot to mention it before. I have
  decided to buy a yacht."</p>

  <p>"My God!" the lawyer exclaimed, setting down the decanter with which he
  had been about to refill his glass. "A yacht!"</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am very fond of the sea," he explained. "I thoroughly enjoyed that
  little voyage over from Calais. A beautifully fitted-up steam yacht of one's
  own would be, I think, a most desirable acquisition."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea," Sir Stephen asked solemnly, "of the initial cost of a
  yacht, or of the cost of running it?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," Francis replied, carelessly vague. "I know that Lord
  Mountavon wants to sell his. Somewhere about thirty thousand pounds is all he
  wants for it."</p>

  <p>"You are at the present moment," Sir Stephen announced, keeping calm with
  an effort, "overdrawn at the bank, notwithstanding your inroads into capital,
  to the extent of something like fourteen thousand pounds. May I ask how you
  propose to pay thirty thousand pounds for a yacht?"</p>

  <p>Francis finished his single glass of port and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You still have some of what you call the 'funds'," he observed. "You have
  only spent about half of them. Have another glass of wine, Sir Stephen." The
  lawyer had forgotten all about the "seventy" port. He pushed the decanter
  away from him.</p>

  <p>"I sought this interview with you," he said, "to try and point out the
  enormity of your realising these sums of money, collected by your ancestors
  for the sole purpose of augmenting the income of your house. I came here to
  protest against your having touched the principal of these for any purpose
  whatever. You have listened to what I have had to say and you now tell me
  that you propose to make a still further encroachment upon those funds to
  provide yourself with yet another form of luxury."</p>

  <p>"I gather that you disapprove of my contemplated purchase," Francis
  sighed.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen rose to his feet. A certain sense of dignity had come to his
  aid.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace," he observed coldly, "does not, I see, intend to discuss
  seriously the matter which brought me here."</p>

  <p>Francis also rose. There was a sudden smile upon his lips, entirely alien
  to the Chatfield family. He laid his hand upon his guest's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My dear Sir Stephen," he begged, " forgive me. I know so well that you
  are doing what you conceive to be your duty as an honourable man. I will
  consider all that you have said, but I will not discuss it further. As for
  the yacht&mdash;well, we will let that stand over for the present. One more
  glass of wine, Sir Stephen. See, I will throw away my cigarette and join you.
  Afterwards you shall go as soon as you like. I have another visitor arriving
  to whom you and most of my relatives seem to have taken a great dislike."</p>

  <p>The lawyer found himself back in his place. Francis himself filled his
  glass&mdash;an altered Francis; a suave and courteous host, talking to him as
  they sipped the smooth, velvety wine, with its wonderful bouquet, of the
  crudeness of Italian vintages, listening with interest to Sir Stephen's
  account of the laying down of the port for the Chatfield cellars during the
  last hundred years. There was another atmosphere in the room. When the lawyer
  stood up to take his leave half an hour later he felt that he had been
  charmingly entertained according to the best traditions of the house he
  worshipped. It was not until he sat in his taxi on his way to the club, that
  he realised the complete failure of his mission.</p>

  <p>Francis remained alone at the head of that ghostly table. There were some
  faint signs of the departing day in the hushed sounds outside: taxis were
  less frequent, a sedate gloom was settling down upon the square; the single
  light on the dining table seemed to burn more clearly. He sat in his
  high-backed chair, struggling with a somewhat confused state of thought.
  There were moments when the world which lay behind &mdash;the white-washed
  villa on the hillside with its straight grove of cypresses, its untidy
  garden, its poverty-stricken air, the brooding monastery below, the details
  of his daily life, sordid yet lightened by flashes of indomitable
  enthusiasm&mdash;seemed like a dream world in which all the
  participants&mdash;himself included&mdash;were puppets. And then these nearer
  days&mdash;the man who had sat at his table a few minutes ago, Lady Monica,
  beautiful as ever but with that faint question always in her eyes, living a
  life in its way as impetuous and ungoverned as his own, Ambrosius, Felicia
  Dringe, the whole crowd of them. Perhaps it was they who were unreal, they
  who were the puppets, himself who dreamed.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Johnson's quiet voice behind him brought him suddenly back to the
  present.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Dringe has called to see your Grace," he announced. "I have shown
  her into the library."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded and, rising to his feet, crossed the hall and entered the
  library. Felicia had thrown herself into one of the great easy-chairs. She
  had turned out the light above her head, and for the moment her outline was
  lost. Her white arms and bosom gleamed like separate fragments of marble; her
  eyes, too, shone as he moved towards her. He raised her fingers to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear Felicia," he murmured, "you have come at a wonderful time. My
  lawyer, in the garb of a prophet of woe, has been dining with me. You will
  have some coffee?"</p>

  <p>He rang the bell&mdash;needlessly, for Johnson was already arranging a
  coffee equipage at Felicia's side. Another man entered with liqueurs. In a
  further corner of the room, underneath a green lamp, Mr. Moss was at work.
  Felicia waved her hand impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Send everyone away, please, Francis," she begged. "I want to talk to
  you."</p>

  <p>Francis dismissed the servants and crossed the room to where Mr. Moss was
  seated. He stood for a moment with his hand upon the librarian's shoulder,
  looking down at his work.</p>

  <p>"Capital, Moss!" he pronounced. "You won't forget, though, to enter the
  Arsella manuscript as reputed. Personally, I think it is a fifteenth-century
  copy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss's weak mouth was suddenly tightened.</p>

  <p>"I should like an opportunity of discussing this matter with your Grace,"
  he said. "I take the liberty of holding a contrary opinion."</p>

  <p>"We will have it out again to-morrow," Francis promised. "In the meantime
  do you mind giving us half an hour? It seems too bad to turn you out, but
  this is the coolest room in the house. Take a walk round the square or drive
  round the park. You spend too much time huddled up at that desk."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss rose reluctantly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Will an hour be sufficient, your Grace?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ample," Francis assured him. . . .</p>

  <p>"You propose to get rid of me quickly, then," Felicia observed, as Francis
  rejoined her.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I happened to remember," he explained, " that you are dancing at eleven
  o'clock to-night before the great ones of the world. You are on the way there
  now, I suppose."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," she admitted. "I didn't think you'd remember."</p>

  <p>"The new car pleases you?"</p>

  <p>"The new car is wonderful," she answered without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Money?" he enquired lightly. "I am at your service."</p>

  <p>She sprang suddenly from the depths of her chair; a slim, quivering
  figure, her beautiful lips distorted for a moment with the passion which
  blazed also from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Money!" she cried. "Francis, I hate the day that I let you settle with
  Mr. Ambrosius for me. I hate the day I first made you pay those bills. It was
  disgraceful! I am humiliated!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Felicia!" he protested.</p>

  <p>The only reason for her silence seemed to be an absolute lack of all
  powers of speech. She stood before him, rapidly clenching and unclenching her
  hands. There were no tears in her eyes but the faint lines underneath seemed
  to grow darker. Her bosom was rising and falling with volcanic quickness.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she said, after a time. "I meant to come here quite quietly,
  just to say a few words to you and ask you a single question. I know you hate
  melodrama. Believe me, this isn't anything of the sort. So many people in
  this world have spoken of my temperament&mdash;well&mdash;you see I really
  did lose my self-control for a moment. I am quite calm now. Please sit down
  at my side."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her. She rested her hand upon his shoulder and leaned towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she asked, "will you kiss me?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a faintly protesting smile.</p>

  <p>"Felicia," he reminded her warningly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know," she rejoined. "It's outside the bargain. I am quite
  aware of that. Well, I've come to tell you that I've had enough of the
  bargain."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Is it to continue? Is there any hope, any chance of a change?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, no," he replied.</p>

  <p>She struggled with herself; apparently in vain, for her head sank into her
  clasped hands, her shoulders shook. Francis rose to his feet and stood
  moodily a few yards off.</p>

  <p>"Our bargain was a perfectly simple one," he said coldly. "I cannot see
  what cause of complaint you have against me."</p>

  <p>She grew very still and cold. Her hands left the front of her face and
  fell into her lap with a little gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"You are right," she admitted. "I have no cause of complaint against you.
  It is simply that you have humiliated me more than I have ever been
  humiliated in my life. I deserve it, I suppose. I looked upon our bargain as
  ridiculous, but I never dreamed that you meant to keep it. I was even
  conceited enough to believe," she added, "that there was no man living who
  would have kept it."</p>

  <p>"You are taking a distorted view of this matter," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Am I?" she answered. "Very well, I will run no risk of making a mistake.
  You have paid all my bills; you have given me the pearls I am wearing, the
  motor car which brought me to the door and anything else that it has entered
  into my head to ask for. I have waited for some sign from you, and waited in
  vain. Is there anything you desire from me in return?"</p>

  <p>"Your society. That was the bargain."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>She unclasped her necklace and tossed the pearls upon the table. From the
  door she looked back at him.</p>

  <p>"The car shall be at your garage to-morrow," she promised. "The money I
  cannot repay you&mdash;you have lost that. Never mind! I have lost something,
  too. Francis!"</p>

  <p>She suddenly weakened. Her arms crept out towards him. He seemed to
  stiffen visibly.</p>

  <p>"Felicia," he told her gravely, "I cannot alter the terms of our bargain.
  You will make me very unhappy, though, if you leave me with these," he added,
  taking the necklace into his hand.</p>

  <p>She looked at it for a moment with distended eyes. Then she began to
  laugh, not altogether pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I am squeamish," she said, "and I am not supposed to be
  moral, but I feel like the righteous heroine of the melodrama when I think of
  wearing your pearls. They burn my neck, Francis&mdash; gewgaws of shame, you
  know, and that sort of thing. Keep them until you have learned one little
  secret about women. They take greedily, perhaps; they love also to give."</p>

  <p>The door was pushed gently open from the outside. Eustace made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed, looking from one to the other. "Not interrupting
  anything, am I? Not putting my foot in it, as usual?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Felicia assured him drily. "A most tactful entrance, I
  should call it. You can see me to my car if you will&mdash;mine, at least,
  until tomorrow. Good night, Francis!"</p>

  <p>"Good night, Felicia!"</p>

  <p>Eustace performed his duties and returned hastily to the library. Francis
  was still standing where he had left him.</p>

  <p>"Frightfully sorry if I butted in or anything," he apologised. "You told
  me to come along, you know, and remind you of Peggy's supper party to-night.
  The whole crowd are going. Nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"You are coming to the party?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't forgotten about Ascot to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. The cars will be here at half-past nine."</p>

  <p>"Good old Francis!" Eustace murmured. "Gad! I believe that's the
  'thirty-eight' brandy. Mind if I have a glass?"</p>

  <p>"Finish the bottle if you like."</p>

  <p>"What's that in your hand?" Eustace asked, as the lamplight flashed on the
  clasps of the necklace. Francis shrugged his shoulders and slipped it into
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"A birthday present for Peggy, perhaps," he answered.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch202"
     name="ch202">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONICA, in a gown of biscuit-coloured muslin, which she had
brought home
  from Paris only the week before, was wandering restlessly about the library
  at Chatfield House. In a distant corner she came upon Mr. Moss, seated at a
  small desk, busy cataloguing.</p>

  <p>"Why, good morning, Mr. Moss!" she exclaimed. "Still here, then?"</p>

  <p>"Still here, your ladyship," the librarian replied, "and very much busier
  than I used to be."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him curiously; a dried up, passionless-looking creature,
  unchanged, it seemed to her, since she was old enough to remember his
  existence.</p>

  <p>"Busier?" she repeated. "What are you doing? Making out a fresh
  catalogue?" Mr. Moss smiled.</p>

  <p>"His Grace is an enthusiastic collector," he confided. "Our
  fourteenth-century manuscripts now are almost unique. Then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does the Duke really take an interest in these things?" she interrupted
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>So far as Mr. Moss was capable of exhibiting any emotion whatever, he
  showed surprise at her question.</p>

  <p>"His Grace is quite a scholar," he said. "His modern Latin is far superior
  to my own and his judgment at least as good."</p>

  <p>"How on earth he finds time for it, I can't imagine," Monica observed.</p>

  <p>"His Grace sits up late and rises early."</p>

  <p>She looked across at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Does he?" she remarked. "Well, he's not particularly early this morning.
  He asked us to be here at half-past nine punctually. We're all going down to
  Ascot together."</p>

  <p>"His Grace is generally very punctual."</p>

  <p>Monica strolled back again towards the lower end of the room where Sir
  Stephen and Lady Betty were seated.</p>

  <p>"We haven't come on the wrong day or anything, have we?" she speculated.
  "It's a quarter to ten already, and Johnson seemed scarcely to know what to
  do with, us when we arrived. I am going to ring the bell and ask him how long
  my beloved cousin means to keep us waiting."</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and pressed the button. Johnson entered almost at once.
  He was obviously ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"You told his Grace that we were waiting, I suppose, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated for a moment. Then he told the truth.</p>

  <p>"It is very unfortunate, my lady," he confessed, "but I do not know where
  to find his Grace."</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's that?" Sir Stephen interposed. "Not know where to find him!
  What do you mean, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>"His Grace did not return last night, Sir Stephen."</p>

  <p>"Not return?" Monica repeated.</p>

  <p>"Not return?" Sir Stephen echoed. "The devil! Do you mean to say that he
  is not in the house now?"</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him since eleven o'clock last night, sir," Johnson
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"And you have heard nothing from him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, sir."</p>

  <p>"Where was he going?" Monica enquired.</p>

  <p>"He didn't say, my lady. I heard him talking with Lord Eustace about a
  supper party given by the Hilarity Company at Mario's restaurant.&mdash;Ah,
  kindly excuse me for a moment, your ladyship."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell was ringing. Johnson took up the receiver and listened
  with some agitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Yes," he said. "Sir Stephen is here now, your Grace, also Lady
  Monica and Lady Betty. I will tell him at once, your Grace."</p>

  <p>He laid down the receiver, and stood for a minute looking ruefully
  around.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Sir Stephen demanded. "Any news?"</p>

  <p>"It was his Grace speaking, sir," Johnson acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Well? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"At Vine Street Police Court, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good God! What's he doing there?" Sir Stephen groaned.</p>

  <p>"I gathered, sir, that he has spent the night in custody," Johnson
  replied. "He said that I was to fetch you at once and beg you to rush round.
  His case is just coming on and he might be requiring bail."</p>

  <p>"His case?" Sir Stephen gasped.</p>

  <p>"Bail?" Monica cried.</p>

  <p>"His Grace was not very coherent," Johnson confessed. "I gathered that he
  had been in some trouble with a policeman last night."</p>

  <p>The lawyer snatched up his hat and stick.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "I'll take one of the cars and hurry
  around at once. You girls had better wait here. Don't breathe a word of this
  to any one. We may be able to hush the thing up. Trouble with a policeman!
  The Duke of Chatfield!"</p>

  <p>He hurried out, followed by Johnson. Lady Betty leaned back in her chair
  and laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember saying, Monica&mdash;down at Chatfield, when Francis gave
  his great fete to the tenantry&mdash; that you believed he was a saint at
  heart? What about it now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," Monica admitted. "I can't imagine Francis being
  mixed up in any sort of a vulgar brawl."</p>

  <p>"Can't you?" Lady Betty observed drily. "I am not at all sure, Monica,
  that we any of us understand that young man. He's fair game for all the
  second-class journalists now. Do you ever see the <i>London Post</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they get to know things, those people," Lady Betty continued. "Only
  last week they asked, under the heading 'Things we want to know', whether a
  certain young nobleman who has recently added lustre to Bohemian society is
  seriously contemplating a return to the monastery, and whether, if he does go
  back, the young ladies from the Hilarity Theatre will take the veil?"</p>

  <p>"You don't pay any attention to the trash you see in those sort of papers,
  do you?" Monica asked scornfully.</p>

  <p>"There's generally some truth in them," Lady Betty replied. "Even Rupert
  grins when I mention his name. Besides, I see him myself driving little Peggy
  Layton, or one of those girls, two or three mornings a week in the park. I
  don't think he need be quite so brazen about it. As to Felicia
  Dringe&mdash;well, she seems to have deserted every one of her other admirers
  and devoted herself to him!"</p>

  <p>Monica had turned a little pale.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Are you by way of being in love with him, Monica?" her friend
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd!" was the irritable reply. "He's only barely civil to any
  of us, and he deliberately avoids me. I don't see him once a month."</p>

  <p>"You seem to take his peccadilloes very much to heart," Lady Betty
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," Monica retorted. ** After all, he's the head of the
  family. I hate to think of these women running after him. I wish he'd chuck
  them all and marry some one decent."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't that affect you people financially?"</p>

  <p>"We couldn't be worse off," Monica replied bitterly. "He makes quite a
  handsome allowance to the family and we spend twice as much. We're on the
  road to ruin, anyhow. If 'Laughing Sally' doesn't win today I, personally,
  shall come the most complete and utter cropper any human being could
  imagine."</p>

  <p>"What an idiot you are, Monica!" Lady Betty yawned. "Why do you bet at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," Monica explained, "I have a reputation to keep up. I am
  supposed to be the smartest and the wickedest unmarried girl in London and I
  have to do all these things. Then I have been having the foulest luck. Do you
  know that I lost over seventeen hundred pounds at <i>chemin de fer</i> last
  Thursday?"</p>

  <p>"Wherever do you play for such stakes?" Lady Betty asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, at some miserable little place in Sackville Street that Mr. Ambrosius
  took Eustace and me to over a year ago. The maddening part of it is that
  every one else seems to win."</p>

  <p>"No one can win in the long run at those places."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," Monica assented. "Yet one must do something. I'm tired of
  being made love to by men I don't care a snap of my finger about, and the men
  who do amuse one&mdash;well, they expect a good deal nowadays."</p>

  <p>"What about Mr. Ambrosius? He follows you everywhere like a shadow, and
  they say that he's a multimillionaire."</p>

  <p>Monica smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's always Mr. Ambrosius," she admitted. "I think I should go
  off my head, though, if he ever suggested such a thing. It would be like
  entering for the divorce stakes before one was married. What on earth"</p>

  <p>She broke off in her speech. The door was suddenly opened and Francis
  entered, followed by Johnson. He stopped short as he recognised his two
  visitors. They both stared at him in amazement. He was still in evening
  clothes; his trousers and coat were covered with mud, the silk muffler which
  he was in the act of unwinding disclosed the fact that he had no tie and that
  his shirt was stained and crumpled. He was paler even than usual, but his
  eyes were almost fiercely bright.</p>

  <p>"I was trying to tell your Grace that the young ladies were here," Johnson
  began.</p>

  <p>"Entirely my fault," Francis acknowledged. "I wanted to speak to Moss.
  Monica, Lady Betty, I offer you both my apologies."</p>

  <p>"Pray don't trouble," Monica begged coolly, looking at him from head to
  foot. "I wouldn't have missed this for anything. Can we have an unexpurgated
  account of the proceedings which led to your&mdash;somewhat deplorable
  condition?"</p>

  <p>"It is all owing to the unreasonable policemen of this country," he
  complained. "In Italy if you kick a policeman he apologises. If you kick him
  twice he runs away. The policeman who annoyed me early this morning did not
  run away. I'm inclined to wish that he had."</p>

  <p>"Abandoning the subject for a moment," Lady Betty intervened; " has it
  occurred to you that you promised to motor us down to Ascot this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"The cars are at the door now," he replied. "If you will excuse me for a
  quarter of an hour I shall be at your service. I promise you we shall be
  there in plenty of time. Have I your permission"</p>

  <p>"Yes, hurry!" Monica interrupted.</p>

  <p>He left the room with a little bow of farewell. The two girls exchanged
  glances.</p>

  <p>"'The Rake's Progress'," Lady Betty remarked. "He's doing pretty well at
  it."</p>

  <p>"And yet he puzzles me," Monica confessed. "Dissipation generally leaves
  some trace behind. He stood there in that morning sunlight, disreputable,
  battered, unclean, and yet somehow or other he looked more of a saint than
  ever."</p>

  <p>"After all I am beginning to wonder whether you are not in love with this
  good-for-nothing cousin of yours," Lady Betty observed.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I hate him," Monica announced.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can't understand him."</p>

  <p>Her friend leaned back in her chair and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Men are all pretty well the same. The only difference
  between them is that some are more blatant than others."</p>

  <p>Monica shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Men are not all the same," she insisted. "Francis is unlike any one I
  ever met before. There is something sinister about his
  misdeeds&mdash;something which seems to me almost deliberate about his
  dissipations. One could fancy that he had a serious reason for steeping
  himself in every form of excess&mdash;for indulging in exploits like this
  one."</p>

  <p>"Just seeing life, my dear," Lady Betty declared.</p>

  <p>"I hope he won't be long."</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly opened. Sir Stephen reappeared.</p>

  <p>"Has he got back?" he asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes ago," Monica replied. "He's changing now. Tell us about
  it."</p>

  <p>"A most disreputable affair," he groaned. "It appears that the police
  arrested one of a party of roisterers coming out of a flat in the West End at
  three o'clock this morning. Francis interfered and promised to take the
  offender home. The policeman, however, refused to let him go and Francis
  knocked him down."</p>

  <p>"Knocked him down?" Lady Betty repeated.</p>

  <p>"And two or three others as well. They say it took five of them to get him
  to Vine Street. He was fined ten pounds and the magistrate's remarks were
  most caustic. The midday papers will be out before we get on the Course."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a beautiful scrap," Monica remarked coolly.</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen frowned.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lady Monica," he expostulated, "it was a most disgraceful affair.
  The worst of it is that nothing we can do will keep the case out of the
  papers. You will see the name of the Duke of Chatfield on all the placards
  to-night. It is all very well to take these things lightly, but there is a
  terrible side to it all. This young man is bringing dishonour upon a great
  family. He seems to be doing it, too, deliberately."</p>

  <p>Monica was silent for a moment. She had the air of one brought suddenly
  face to face with an unexpected truth. She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Deliberately!" she repeated. "Sir Stephen, I believe that you are right.
  I believe that I am beginning to understand.&mdash;Heavens, is this
  Eustace?"</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch203"
     name="ch203">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HULLO, everybody!" Eustace exclaimed weakly, after a
somewhat furtive
  entrance. "What's wrong, eh? You are all looking pretty solemn." From the
  depths of their easy-chairs, Monica, Lady Betty and Sir Stephen eyed the
  newcomer in silence. Eustace laid his silk hat and glasses upon the table,
  yawned and rang the bell. He was dressed with great care but his eyes were
  redder than ever and his complexion unusually pasty.</p>

  <p>"Do you know about Francis?" Monica asked him sternly.</p>

  <p>"Know about him?" Eustace groaned. "I was there."</p>

  <p>Johnson appeared in answer to the ring. Eustace turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Get me a brandy and soda and half a dozen aspirins, if his Grace has
  any," he ordered. "If not, send round to the chemist's."</p>

  <p>Johnson bowed and withdrew. Sir Stephen waited until the door was
  closed.</p>

  <p>"How did Francis get led into this?" he demanded severely.</p>

  <p>"Get led into it?" Eustace repeated, with a note of indignation in his
  tone. "Well, that beats the band! Fancy leading Francis anywhere. Why, when
  he gets going, there isn't one of us could touch him."</p>

  <p>"But surely he's not quarrelsome as a rule?" Monica asked.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't stop to quarrel," Eustace replied. "One would think that he
  had been brought up in a prize-fighting academy. The very sight of a
  policeman after dinner seems to affect him like a red rag does a bull. It was
  a terrible mix-up, but the way he bowled them over last night was a
  dream."</p>

  <p>"Disgusting!" Sir Stephen exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Johnson reappeared with a salver and Eustace helped himself liberally.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven for that!" he sighed, as he set down the tumbler empty. "Has
  his Grace had any breakfast, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord," the man answered. "He has only been home a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"Better leave the brandy and soda on the sideboard." "Certainly, your
  lordship. His Grace, however, never takes anything in the morning."</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I had taken a little less last night," Eustace lamented,
  holding his head. "I've had three aspirins already."</p>

  <p>The door was quietly opened and Francis entered. He was looking his usual
  self and was dressed with the greatest precision. Eustace surveyed him in
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "How do you do it, old chap? You
  look&mdash;my God, you look as though you had gone to bed at eleven o'clock
  last night and had a cold bath this morning!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've had the cold bath, all right," Francis admitted, smiling.</p>

  <p>"But you can't have had any breakfast," Monica remonstrated.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast!" he replied. a I had a cup of coffee in my bath. Why this
  interest in my diet?"</p>

  <p>"A young man who has been out all night," Monica began severely&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, nothing of the sort," Francis interrupted. "I had a good three
  hours' sleep in a most comfortable cell."</p>

  <p>"There's some brandy and soda on the sideboard," Eustace pointed out. "I
  told Johnson to leave it in case you felt like some."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, but I never touch it. If you're all ready, we will start at once.
  If Lady Betty and Sir Stephen and Eustace will take the first car, you and I
  will follow them, Monica."</p>

  <p>They moved down the hall together. Monica laid her hand upon her cousin's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she said, impulsively, "I am glad we're going together. I want
  just one serious word with you."</p>

  <p>"No lectures," he insisted. "I can't stand any more. I've had a terrible
  twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," she assured him. "I'm far too wrapped up in my own
  affairs to worry about your peccadilloes. It's about 'Laughing Sally'. You
  really think she's certain to win?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as that."</p>

  <p>"But you have declared to win with her?" she reminded him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've declared to win with her," he admitted, readily. "There are
  other good horses in the race, though."</p>

  <p>"I can't see that there is one to touch her," Monica exclaimed, "if she's
  fit. Your second string, 'Grey Lady', is the only dark horse."</p>

  <p>"'Grey Lady' is a very useful animal," Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"But you have declared to win with 'Laughing Sally'," Monica reminded him
  again with increased? anxiety. "There isn't anything wrong with the mare, is
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I know of. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for no particular reason, except that Eustace and every one I've met
  lately seems to think there's a sort of uneasy feeling about with regard to
  the race. Captain Halston told me yesterday that he was completely mystified.
  'Laughing Sally' on paper ought to be at two to one. As a matter of fact you
  can get sevens anywhere. And 'Grey Lady', who ought to be at a hundred to one
  after your declaration, keeps creeping up in the betting."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so interested?" he asked. "Have you been having a little
  flutter?"</p>

  <p>"A little flutter!" Monica rejoined. "I have backed 'Laughing Sally' for
  all I have in the world."</p>

  <p>He glanced into her face. There was the shadow of a desperate look there
  which he had noticed once or twice lately.</p>

  <p>"Monica, if I were you," he began&mdash; ? She suddenly clutched at his
  arm. They were standing beneath the great portico of Chatfield House,
  watching the first car, which was on the point of starting. A powerful
  two-seater had just arrived and a small man in a long coat had descended and
  was making his way towards them.</p>

  <p>"It's Sidney Platt, your jockey," she pointed out breathlessly. "Do see
  what he wants."</p>

  <p>"If you will get into the car I will follow you directly," Francis
  suggested.&mdash;" What are you doing here, Platt," he went on, turning away.
  "Surely you ought to be down on the Course?"</p>

  <p>"I am on my way down now, your Grace," the jockey answered. "I shall be
  there in plenty of time. I took the liberty of calling in here for a private
  word in case I didn't see your Grace before the race."</p>

  <p>"No bad news from the stables, I hope?" Monica asked, leaning out of the
  car.</p>

  <p>"No bad news at all, my lady," was the some what dubious reply. "If I
  could speak to your Grace entirely in private."</p>

  <p>"Follow me, then," Francis directed. He turned round and led the way into
  a small waiting room just inside the hall.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" he demanded, as soon as he had closed the door.</p>

  <p>"I want my riding instructions from your Grace's own lips," the man said.
  "I see that you have declared to win with 'Laughing Sally'."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that what we decided six weeks ago?" Francis replied. "You
  remember the result of the trial."</p>

  <p>"Things have changed since then, your Grace," the jockey declared
  earnestly. "What's wrong with 'Laughing Sally' there isn't a vet in the
  country could tell you. The mare seems all right, but she's lost her pace.
  'Grey Lady' will win by streets, your Grace, if I ride her all out. I'll hold
  her back all I can, but it'll be a tough job."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand," Francis asked, after a moment's pause, "that you
  believe you could win with 'Grey Lady' if you tried?"</p>

  <p>"It's a dead cert, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"Then, if you can win, do so," Francis directed. "You know my
  offer&mdash;whoever wins, riding one of my horses, gets a thousand pounds.
  You can back 'Grey Lady' for a hundred pounds on my account, if you think
  you've a chance."</p>

  <p>There was a gleam of cupidity in the jockey's eyes. He was still
  perturbed, however.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace will forgive my pointing out," he said, "that there may be
  some trouble with the stewards and with the public if 'Grey Lady' should win.
  She stands at a hundred to one after your declaration and I don't think the
  public have backed her for a shilling."</p>

  <p>"The public are in the same box as I am, then," Francis replied, with a
  little shrug of the shoulders. "I have not a penny myself on the race."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace has not backed 'Laughing Sally'?"</p>

  <p>"Nor 'Grey Lady'," Francis assured him, "although I don't quite see what
  business it is of yours."</p>

  <p>"I beg your Grace's pardon. I take it then, finally, I am to ride 'Grey
  Lady' to win if I can."</p>

  <p>"By all means."</p>

  <p>"If it comes off," the jockey said, "I shall swear that the mare bolted
  with me. I may do something with her bit. Your Grace fully realises, though,"
  he added, pausing with his hand upon the door, "that if you declare to win
  with one horse and win with another, there will be trouble."</p>

  <p>"I shall welcome it," Francis assured him.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" Monica enquired, as he rejoined her and they started off.</p>

  <p>"Nothing special."</p>

  <p>"'Laughing Sally's' all right, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Platt doesn't know much about her. He's riding 'Grey Lady'."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>She subsided into her corner. They bowled smoothly along through
  Hammersmith, on to Brentford, and at last out into the open country. Monica
  leaned lazily forward, examining the little trifles of tortoise-shell and
  gilt in the case opposite to her. She drew out a memorandum book and looked
  at it. Suddenly her eyes flashed. She held it towards him.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" she asked coldly. "'F.D.' Whose initials are
  these?"</p>

  <p>"Felicia Dringe's, I suppose," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You dare to tell me that we are driving in her car?"</p>

  <p>He took up the tube and spoke to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"It seems," he explained to Monica, "that this is a car which Felicia
  returned to me last night. I gave it to her, it is true, but it is no longer
  hers. I am exceedingly sorry that I brought it out. You see, I have two
  others, exactly the same model, and those were the two cars I ordered for
  to-day. This one being identically the same, I suppose my head man didn't
  think that it mattered. I offer you my apologies."</p>

  <p>She leaned over, took the cluster of little articles, one by one from
  their places, and threw them into the hedge which they were passing. He
  watched her with an amused smile. She turned round and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Now I feel better," she confessed. "Kindly tell me what this means. Have
  you quarrelled with Felicia?"</p>

  <p>"Our friendship appears to have come to an end," he acknowledged. "You
  could scarcely call it a quarrel."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean to say that she actually returned you the car you had given
  her?"</p>

  <p>"She did, also a few other trifles."</p>

  <p>Monica sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is amazing," she declared. "I always thought Felicia was rather a
  greedy woman. She must have been very fond of you.&mdash;Oh, Francis,
  Francis," she pleaded, "why don't you turn over a new leaf and behave
  nicely?"</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him, and he was suddenly conscious of a surge of that
  feeling for which Felicia had prayed in vain. The memory of that drive home
  from Chatfield Castle thrilled him. Monica's eyes seemed to be growing larger
  and softer; her delightful mouth was already quivering.</p>

  <p>"Francis, why don't you behave like the dear you really are?" she
  begged.</p>

  <p>They shot forward to pass another car. Lord Henry, pompous and dignified,
  with the Chatfield look upon his face at which Monica so often laughed, waved
  his hand genially. Lady Susan leaned forward and smiled. The sight of the two
  together was obviously pleasing to them. Francis laughed heartily as they
  took their place once more in the middle of the road.</p>

  <p>"Why that unpleasant sound?" Monica asked ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of your father's face," he replied, "when he takes up the
  evening papers and reads that the Duke of Chatfield has been fined ten pounds
  and costs at Vine Street Police Station. 'Disorderly conduct and assault upon
  the police' they called it. They generously waived the matter of
  drunkenness." ?</p>

  <p>She snatched her hand away from his.</p>

  <p>"What a brute you are, Francis!" she exclaimed.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch204"
     name="ch204">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS, who had watched the race from the rails, found
himself a few
  moments afterwards in the midst of a wildly shouting and gesticulating crowd.
  The whole thing seemed unreal&mdash;a sudden picture flashed across the brain
  and withdrawn: "Grey Lady ", her jockey reeling in his saddle, bent forward
  over her neck, three lengths ahead; the dramatic silence; the roar of
  disappointed voices. He made his way to a table at the back of the grand
  stand, ordered some strawberries from an officious waiter and prepared for
  the storm. Eustace, wandering aimlessly about, was the first to discover him.
  He came hurrying up, swinging his race glasses, his hat on the back of his
  head, his face ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Francis!" he exclaimed. "You know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," his cousin assented. "Have some strawberries."</p>

  <p>"Damn the strawberries," Eustace rejoined heartily. "Do you realise what
  has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. 'Grey Lady' has won by some two or three lengths. 'Laughing
  Sally' finished in the ruck, I should think. Platt was lucky to sit the
  mare&mdash; lost her bit or something, didn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," Eustace groaned. "It's all very well for you to sit there
  eating strawberries, Francis, but do you realise that I am ruined? There'll
  be the devil to pay over the whole business. You declare to win with
  'Laughing Sally'. We all back her, and 'Grey Lady' makes her look like a cab
  horse."</p>

  <p>"Most unfortunate," Francis murmured. "I can assure you that in the only
  trial I've seen between them, 'Grey Lady' was hopelessly beaten."</p>

  <p>"Look here, old chap," Eustace asked huskily, "as between pals&mdash;and I
  shall need a pal before the week's out&mdash;how much did you back 'Grey
  Lady' for?"</p>

  <p>"Not a penny."</p>

  <p>"You mean to tell me that you were on 'Laughing Sally'?"</p>

  <p>"I have no bet on the race," Francis declared.</p>

  <p>"You didn't back either of your own horses?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? Betting amuses the public; it doesn't amuse me. The racing
  is the only thing I care for."</p>

  <p>"But how on earth can you make a racing stable pay without betting?"
  Eustace demanded incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I don't try," Francis admitted. "I find that mine costs me a great deal
  of money."</p>

  <p>Eustace took off his hat and mopped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old chap," he said, "I'm not blaming you for what's happened
  to-day, although I warn you that there are many who will&mdash;still, it was
  your geegee who upset the applecart. Do you think that you could possibly
  help me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" Francis enquired. "I do not bet myself. Why should you?
  Besides, I make your father a very good allowance."</p>

  <p>"I know, and I'm jolly grateful and all that. But, Francis, this race has
  absolutely done me in the eye ? laid me out flat. I must touch at least a
  couple of thou before Monday."</p>

  <p>"I'm short of ready money myself," was the frank acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder at it, the way you live. Still, you can raise it all
  right. If you don't help me, Francis, I shall be in Queer Street&mdash;the
  colonies and a pickax, or a monkey and barrel organ in Piccadilly. You don't
  need to part with a copper&mdash;a word to Ambrosius will do the trick."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Francis acquiesced. "I'll telephone to him directly I get
  back."</p>

  <p>Eustace drew a long breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"My God, you're a brick!" he declared. "I sha'n't forget it, I can promise
  you. Here's the governor and old Laveringham bearing down on us. I'm off. See
  you later!"</p>

  <p>Lord Henry and his companion, who were engaged in earnest conversation,
  paused a few yards from where Francis was still seated. The former was, for
  him, almost agitated.</p>

  <p>"You've never met Chatfield, have you?" he asked. "Come and have a word
  with him quietly about this little matter."</p>

  <p>Lord Laveringham shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think," he decided, "that I had better not meet the young man for the
  present. As a member of the Jockey Club, I may have to do so in another
  capacity before many hours are past."</p>

  <p>"But my dear Laveringham," his companion began&mdash;</p>

  <p>Laveringham made his escape. Lord Henry approached his nephew with gloomy
  countenance and portentous manner.</p>

  <p>"I see you're indulging in a little reflection, Francis," he observed
  solemnly. "A most extraordinary race!"</p>

  <p>"I thought it rather a good one," Francis replied. "I never could have
  believed that I possessed a horse in my stable with such action as 'Grey
  Lady' showed during the last few strides. Seems to me she went better doing
  the wild prairie stunt!"</p>

  <p>Lord Henry glanced cautiously around.</p>

  <p>"It seems an odd thing to say, Francis, but I hope that you're not a heavy
  winner over the race."</p>

  <p>"A winner! I had no bet at all."</p>

  <p>His uncle stared at the young man for a moment in blank astonishment.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "Come back to the box, there's a good
  fellow. I want to talk to you quietly. There are too many people moving about
  here."</p>

  <p>Francis rose to his feet and they made their way towards the Stand. The
  owner of "Grey Lady" was recognised by one or two of the promenaders and the
  tone of their remarks was distinctly unfriendly. Once a slight hiss was
  heard. Lord Henry tightened his grasp upon his nephew's arm.</p>

  <p>"You must expect to find yourself unpopular, Francis," he warned him.</p>

  <p>"I must bear with the fact," was the dry response. "I thought that the
  essence of racing as a sport was that the best horse should win."</p>

  <p>They found the box empty, a fact which seemed to afford Lord Henry some
  relief. He carefully closed the door.</p>

  <p>"It appears likely, Francis," he said, " that we shall be alone for a few
  minutes. Let me take the opportunity of warning you that there will probably
  be a great deal of ill-feeling about this contretemps."</p>

  <p>Francis sank into a comfortable wicker chair and accepted the glass of
  wine which his uncle poured out, although he showed no signs of drinking its
  contents.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry, on the other hand, refilled the glass which he had promptly
  emptied.</p>

  <p>"Let us exchange a few plain words," he suggested, seating himself
  opposite to his nephew and drawing his chair back so as to be out of sight of
  the crowds below. "You see, my dear fellow, you are already a great surprise
  to the world. You were, if you will forgive my saying so, rather an austere
  person when: you came over here to&mdash;er&mdash;to assume your rightful
  position. People were expecting very different things of you. You have
  certainly surprised them and us."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"I am your elder by a generation," his uncle went on, "and your father's
  brother, and I may therefore speak to you frankly. You have earned the
  reputation of being a libertine, a gambler, and a spendthrift. You are openly
  seen with women of doubtful reputation in places which men of our order
  prefer, as a rule, to keep for their own womenkind. Last night, or rather
  early this morning, you made a disgraceful appearance in the police court,
  and nine tenths of the people we see passing back and forth below, who are
  not talking about this miserable racing fiasco, are probably talking about
  the fight between the 'Duke and the Policeman'."</p>

  <p>"A very good fight, too, if the fellow hadn't been so slow," Francis
  commented, with a reminiscent smile.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, but that sort of thing is altogether out of date," Lord Henry
  said stiffly. "In the time of the late Georges a greater latitude was shown
  as regards these affairs. To-day I am bound to tell you that they are
  considered bad form."</p>

  <p>"I appear to be in disgrace all round," Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"You are and you deserve to be," his uncle replied, with the courage
  engendered by that second glass of champagne. "These are days when it has
  become a shibboleth to keep up appearances. You can be the biggest blackguard
  imaginable provided you don't force the knowledge of your iniquities upon the
  world. If you do, you must take the consequences."</p>

  <p>"You interest me exceedingly," the delinquent assured him suavely.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry frowned. His manner had attained almost to dignity.</p>

  <p>"Interest you!" he repeated with some heat. "That was scarcely my
  intention. This is not the place for a serious discussion of a lengthy
  nature, but all the same I cannot refrain from telling you, in connection
  with this latest episode, that your deportment is bringing shame and
  dishonour upon an ancient name."</p>

  <p>"The name of Chatfield!" Francis murmured interrogatively. "By the
  bye&mdash;forgive me if I am wrong &mdash;but is it not true that you are a
  director of the Comet Assurance Company?"</p>

  <p>"I fail to see the relevance of your enquiry," Lord Henry rejoined, a
  little taken aback, "but it is unfortunately a fact. I was deceived by the
  nature of the operations carried on by that concern."</p>

  <p>"And Hoppner's Private Banking Company?"</p>

  <p>"I was positively forced upon the Board," Lord Henry declared uneasily. "A
  considerable number of the shareholders, however, have acquitted the
  directors of all responsibility."</p>

  <p>"Then there was the Leadenhall Cold Storage Company?"</p>

  <p>"You are remarkably well informed," Lord Henry observed, with a frown. "I
  will grant at once that I have not been well advised in my commercial
  activities. At the same time, I might remind you that I was introduced to
  each one of these disastrous affairs by your friend and protege, Mr.
  Ambrosius."</p>

  <p>"In any case you will admit that your commercial activities, as you call
  them, have not added any particular lustre to the name of Chatfield," Francis
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"I, at any rate, have kept the name out of the police court," his uncle
  reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you were a little nearer the Old Bailey," Francis ventured to
  suggest.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Even our relationship, Francis," he protested with anger, "is
  insufficient warrant for such insinuations."</p>

  <p>"My dear uncle, I am attempting no insinuations. I am dealing in plain
  facts. You will scarcely deny that you have been director of a great many
  companies whose sole intention has been to fleece the public. I have not
  heard that even after the nature of their operations was discovered, you
  returned the money which you had received as director's fees."</p>

  <p>"Such a course would be most unusual," was the irritable rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Francis smiled inscrutably.</p>

  <p>"Really! Well, I will not dispute such matters with you. In return, I
  suggest that you view my occasional appearances in the police court with
  greater equanimity. Perhaps"&mdash;</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly opened. Monica entered, with Ambrosius hovering in
  the background.</p>

  <p>"Here's the villain of the play drinking champagne while his victims
  discuss suicide!" she exclaimed lightly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that you are disappointed, Monica," Francis remarked, rising
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, quite pleased! It is always a joy to meet an entirely new
  situation, isn't it? I am like half a dozen other of your friends who are
  going about thirsting for your blood&mdash;broke to the world. You'd better
  go and look for Mummie, Dad," she went on, turning to her father, " and take
  Mr. Ambrosius with you. I want to talk to Francis."</p>

  <p>The two men left the box together, Francis watching their departure with a
  faint smile of amusement. Monica took her father's chair.</p>

  <p>"Quite a relief to find you here," she confided. "I imagined the multitude
  seeking to tear you limb from limb."</p>

  <p>"So did your father, apparently. He found me sitting on the lawn and
  insisted on my taking cover. May I give you some wine?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, thanks, unless you have a little prussic acid about,"
  Monica replied bitterly.</p>

  <p>"As bad as that?"</p>

  <p>"As bad as that."</p>

  <p>"You're a little out of date, you know," he reminded her. "Veronal is the
  popular refuge."</p>

  <p>"Beast!" she exclaimed. "I really believe you are the hardest person I
  ever knew."</p>

  <p>"My bringing up, perhaps," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Do you admire me, Francis?" she asked, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I think that you are very beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! I'm much more than that. I Have what all these other women try to
  copy; what the <i>Tatler</i>, when it published my last photograph, called
  'the psychic influence of unanalysable attraction'."</p>

  <p>"I agree with the <i>Tatler</i>."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't I attract you?"</p>

  <p>"I have never said that you do not."</p>

  <p>"You prove it. You prefer long-legged women who dance like spiders and who
  think that they are artists because they prefer zigzags to curves. It isn't
  wholesome, you know, Francis."</p>

  <p>"Please go on."</p>

  <p>"I don't object to your penchant for the little musical-comedy ladies
  nearly so much," she continued, "only I don't think they look any nicer in
  your Rolls-Royce than I should, and I can't think that they'd be much more
  amusing. One must tire of shibboleth and honey."</p>

  <p>"I shall never dare to ask you to drive with me now," he sighed. "Your
  father has just been explaining to me what a particularly black sheep I am.
  After to-day I should think that his opinions would probably be reflected by
  a great many other people."</p>

  <p>Monica leaned forward for a moment to look at the numbers for the next
  race. Then she settled herself once more comfortably in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she assented, "if it amuses you to go about getting drunk,
  knocking policemen down, spending the night in police cells and winning races
  with the wrong horses, you must expect it in time to affect your popularity.
  On the other hand, you probably don't care what people think of you. What you
  are aiming at in life, heaven only knows! I often stop to wonder. As a rake,
  you always seem to me rather a poseur."</p>

  <p>"You are very astute, dear cousin."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I sit here bandying words with you, Francis," she said.
  "I really have something very serious to say."</p>

  <p>He sat quite still, waiting. She leaned forward confidentially.</p>

  <p>"Francis!"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. She gave a little gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Just as I had summoned up all my courage!" she exclaimed, throwing
  herself back in her chair.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch205"
     name="ch205">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A SMALL crowd of people trooped into the box, amongst them
Lady Betty, her
  brother Lord Rupert Bremner, Captain Halston and his sister. Conversation for
  the first few moments lacked spontaneity. It was hard to speak of the day's
  tragedy with Francis present. Lady Betty ventured to sympathise with him.</p>

  <p>"We are all so very sorry for you," she said. "I'm afraid you're terribly
  disappointed."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I am," Francis replied. "It was at least a very unusual
  race. I couldn't see very well, but they told me that Platt could do nothing
  else but hang on, and couldn't have stopped 'Grey Lady' if he'd wanted
  to."</p>

  <p>"'Unusual' is a very good word for the race," Captain Halston remarked a
  little coldly. "Dashed unpleasant thing to have your second string win ?
  especially under the circumstances.&mdash;Monica, you gave us the slip in the
  most barefaced way in the paddock. We've been looking for you
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>"I was seized upon by the omnipotent Mr. Ambrosius," she declared. "What a
  power wealth is! We're all afraid to be rude to him because he's a
  millionaire. He held up his finger and I came meekly along to look for
  strawberries which I didn't want, just because a stroke of his pen would make
  me a rich woman."</p>

  <p>"Insufferable bounder!" Halston muttered, accepting a glass of wine, which
  Eustace was pouring out. "I can't imagine why you're so civil to him."</p>

  <p>"My dear man," Monica confided, "any one with money possesses an
  extraordinary fascination for me. I don't suppose he'd give me a sovereign if
  I asked for it, except for value received, but the mere thought that he could
  sit down and write me a cheque for every penny I owe in the world without
  being any the poorer for it endows him with a sort of unholy attraction. I
  find myself shivering with excitement when he speaks to me. I can see his
  pudgy fingers gripping a gold fountain pen. One can't be rude to such a
  man."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea that I shall be some day," Halston confessed gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I sympathise with Monica," Lady Betty declared. "To even think of being
  rude to a millionaire is to show yourself entirely out of sympathy with the
  spirit of the times."</p>

  <p>"I didn't see anything of you in the Paddock, Chatfield," Lord Rupert
  observed. "Have you had Platt's report yet?"</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to have gone round," he said. "I rather thought Molden,
  my trainer, would have turned up."</p>

  <p>"They're off!" Eustace exclaimed suddenly.</p>

  <p>Every one watched the race a little languidly. The favourite had just
  cantered past the winning post, ten lengths ahead of the next horse, when
  there was a knock at the door. A messenger entered.</p>

  <p>"Is the Duke of Chatfield here?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"He is," Francis answered, rising to his feet. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Lord Laveringham's compliments and he would be glad if your Grace would
  step into the stewards' room for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>There was an ominous silence. Francis stretched out his hand for his hat.
  Lord Henry bustled in.</p>

  <p>"My dear Francis!" he exclaimed fussily. "I have just left Laveringham. It
  is as I feared. The stewards wish to see you."</p>

  <p>"I have this moment received a message from them," Francis told him.</p>

  <p>"If my support is of any assistance, you can count upon it," Lord Henry
  declared. "This matter touches the honour of our house. If you wish it I will
  accompany you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I'd rather go alone," Francis replied. "I don't know exactly what
  is likely to happen to me, but if I'm allowed to, I'll come back here."</p>

  <p>He passed out, to all appearance entirely unconcerned. His uncle looked
  around with a little groan.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible! Really terrible!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Monica asked. "Francis has done nothing dishonourable."</p>

  <p>"He declared to win with the wrong horse," Captain Halston pointed out,
  "and that isn't a very popular proceeding either with the stewards or the
  public."</p>

  <p>"You can never make a moral certainty of any race," Monica argued.
  "Besides, it was obvious that Platt couldn't have stopped 'Grey Lady',
  however much he'd tried."</p>

  <p>"My dear, you know very little about it," her father intervened testily.
  "We must remember, though, that whatever happens it is our duty to stick to
  Francis."</p>

  <p>"Naturally&mdash;as we all live on his bounty," Monica assented under her
  breath.</p>

  <p>"A most improper way of describing the situation," Lord Henry protested.
  "Francis only makes those allowances to his next of kin which are usual and
  decent. In return for them, however, I admit that it is our duty to give him
  our countenance. That is why I offered to accompany him to the stewards'
  room."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen knocked at the door and entered.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard the news?" he demanded. "I understand that Chatfield is up
  before the stewards."</p>

  <p>"They sent here for him," Lord Henry acquiesced gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to any of you people that Francis didn't back 'Grey Lady'
  for a penny?" Monica asked.</p>

  <p>Lord Rupert scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"So I understand," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"He told me so," Eustace declared.</p>

  <p>"Pretty hard thing to prove," was Halston's dry comment.</p>

  <p>The door was opened cautiously and Mr. Ambrosius entered.</p>

  <p>"I hope I am not in the way," he said. "I was deeply concerned to hear
  that the Duke had been sent for by the stewards."</p>

  <p>"My nephew has certainly been sent for," Lord Henry acknowledged stiffly.
  "We trust, however, that nothing will come of it."</p>

  <p>"There's the devil of a lot of feeling about," Halston observed. "They say
  that the bookies have snaffled a cool million out of the British public.
  There wasn't a bob on 'Grey Lady', naturally. That is, if Chatfield really
  didn't back her."</p>

  <p>"You're not suggesting that Francis told you a falsehood, I hope?" Monica
  asked, with an angry gleam in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Halston replied hastily. "On the other hand, it will be
  rather difficult to make people understand the situation."</p>

  <p>"I am an ignoramus in racing matters," Sir Stephen confessed, "but the
  whole affair seems most unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"Deplorable!" Lord Henry sighed. "I certainly never imagined that the head
  of our house, that any Chatfield, would ever be called upon to explain the
  running of one of his horses."</p>

  <p>"I can't see that Francis is to blame at all," Monica persisted. "He
  declared to win according to his trainer's reports. I don't see what else he
  could have done."</p>

  <p>"There are all sorts of rumours flying about," Halston ventured.</p>

  <p>Lord Rupert nodded.</p>

  <p>"One chap I saw just now in the paddock," he confided, "was telling every
  one for a fact that there had been two or three later trials of which no
  notice whatever was taken."</p>

  <p>"This is a very terrible day!" Lord Henry muttered. "It started badly. The
  sight of that early edition was like a nightmare."</p>

  <p>"What price the Sunday papers!" Eustace enquired dismally.</p>

  <p>"And to think that this young man was torn from what is called a 'Holy
  Life' to assume the position of head of our house." his father groaned.</p>

  <p>The door was opened a little abruptly and Francis reentered. He appeared
  still entirely unruffled and met their enquiring gazes with a faintly
  enigmatic smile.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Lord Henry exclaimed eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Did they lay it across you?" Eustace demanded breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Tell us about it at once, Francis," Monica enjoined.</p>

  <p>Francis took a cigarette from the box upon the table and lit it.</p>

  <p>"Well, there isn't much to tell," he said. "I felt rather like an errant
  member of the congregation of some Scotch kirk."</p>

  <p>"What did they decide?" his uncle asked.</p>

  <p>"They didn't seem able to come to any decision," was the indifferent
  reply. "They seemed thunderstruck when I told them that I hadn't backed 'Grey
  Lady' for a penny&mdash;that I had never, in fact, made a bet in my life.
  They asked me a lot of questions about later trials, but I told them I hadn't
  been to Newmarket for two months. The Marquis didn't say so, but it was
  obvious that he didn't believe me."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, tell us their verdict," Lord Henry begged
  feverishly.</p>

  <p>"Well, they whispered together for about five minutes and then they told
  me very stiffly that a further investigation of the matter would be
  necessary. Pending the result of this enquiry, they suggested that I abandon
  racing as a form of recreation."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's breathless silence. Eustace was the only one who
  dared put the thing into words.</p>

  <p>"Warned off, by God!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"A Chatfield!" his father moaned.</p>

  <p>Francis had moved to the front of the box with the intention of speaking
  to Monica. Suddenly a significant sound from below attracted his attention.
  He stopped short and looked down. A little crowd of people had gathered at
  the back of the seats and there was an ominous chorus of hissing.</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about my unpopularity," he observed. "I think, perhaps,
  I'd better relieve you of my company."</p>

  <p>He turned away. Monica rose promptly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Let us all go home," she suggested. "We know just where the cars are and
  I certainly don't want any more racing to-day."</p>

  <p>"Not such a bad idea," Eustace agreed.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer," Francis objected, "to find my way back alone. I will
  leave the cars."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort," Monica declared, laying her hand upon
  his arm. "I came with you and I am going back with you."</p>

  <p>They trooped out on to the corridor. A little posse of policemen were
  lined up there. The sergeant saluted Lord Henry.</p>

  <p>"We've instructions to escort your party, my lord," he announced. "There's
  an ugly crowd hanging around the gates."</p>

  <p>For the first time Francis showed signs of real feeling. He freed himself
  from Monica's restraining arm.</p>

  <p>"Please allow me to find my own way out," he begged. "I am perfectly well
  able to take care of myself and there is not the slightest necessity to
  involve you others in any annoyance."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly. The light of battle was in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Touched at last, my imperturbable cousin!" she exclaimed. "Nothing would
  induce me to desert you. If there's any fun going, I mean to see it. I
  suggest, though, that our escort spreads out a little. To march on either
  side is simply to draw attention to us."</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship is quite right," the sergeant agreed. "We'll keep in the
  background as much as possible."</p>

  <p>After all nothing happened. Monica dawdled down the path and stood outside
  the gate talking unconcernedly to Francis whilst the car with a policeman on
  the box to ensure its rapid progress was brought round. At the last moment
  Lord Henry and Eustace joined them. She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I hoped I was going to have the black sheep of the family to myself," she
  complained. "Must you two really come?"</p>

  <p>The car started off just as a crowd of loiterers discovered the identity
  of its occupants. There were a few shouts. The police stopped one man who
  seemed inclined to follow it.</p>

  <p>"I think," Lord Henry declared, leaning back in his place, " that since we
  are here, we will remain."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch206"
     name="ch206">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS had appropriated to his own use, and furnished in
bachelor
  fashion, a very pleasant suite upon the first floor of Chatfield House, a
  little cut off from the main part of the building. He made his way there
  immediately upon his return from Ascot, ordered a whisky and soda from his
  valet and rang the bell for Mr. Moss. The librarian appeared after a few
  minutes' delay.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Moss?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace was quite right," Mr. Moss admitted. "I have consulted all the
  authorities and I have been round to the British Museum to see Mr. Terrett,
  who is our greatest authority about Rappelli. The manuscript which is being
  offered to-morrow is without doubt a copy. I am exceedingly glad that your
  Grace pointed out the variations in the text. I am afraid that I myself
  should have accepted it as genuine."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're convinced," he said. "Did you bring up the engagement
  book?"</p>

  <p>"I did, your Grace."</p>

  <p>"I know I'm supposed to be dining at Storeham House," Francis continued,
  "but wait a moment&mdash;have you any idea, Mr. Moss, what it means to be
  'warned off the turf?"</p>

  <p>"I believe, your Grace, that it implies dishonesty in the running of
  horses."</p>

  <p>"Just as I imagined," Francis acknowledged. "I have been 'warned off the
  turf', Mr. Moss, by the stewards at Ascot to-day, and I spent last night in a
  police cell."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, your Grace!" Mr. Moss remarked equably. "I was not aware of
  that."</p>

  <p>"I was subsequently fined ten pounds and costs. I sent for you, Mr. Moss,
  to ask your advice. Under the circumstances, do you think I had better dine
  at Storeham House? I understand that Royalty will be present."</p>

  <p>The librarian considered the matter for a moment gravely.</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances, your Grace, I should not attend the dinner. With
  your permission, I will send a note of excuse."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Francis assented, with an air of relief. "I shall dine up here
  alone. You might let me have the Florentine Missal to look through and also
  the 'Abelard and Heloise' that Sotherby's sent round. By the bye, do you
  happen to have seen the evening papers?"</p>

  <p>"I never read the papers, your Grace," Mr. Moss confessed.</p>

  <p>"A pity! They're full of me this evening."</p>

  <p>"I shall perhaps read one going home in the Tube. There is nothing else I
  can send up from the library?"</p>

  <p>"Send me a copy of Walter Pater's 'Renaissance'," Francis
  directed&mdash;"the vellum-bound edition you were showing me the other day.
  That's all, I think. Good night, Moss."</p>

  <p>"I wish your Grace good night," Mr. Moss replied.</p>

  <p>Francis bathed and changed in very leisurely fashion. Afterwards he dined
  in the small salon of his suite&mdash;a very frugal meal, with which he drank
  water and one glass of port afterwards. Coffee was served to him in the den
  adjoining; a very perfect little bachelor's room, hung with tapestries which
  he had bought himself at Christie's, and furnished with a certain sedate
  medievalism which gave an ascetic atmosphere to a room which was still
  entirely comfortable. He was engrossed in studying the crabbed text of his
  Florentine Missal when Sir Stephen Dobelle was announced. Francis laid down
  the volume with reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Sir Stephen," he invited. "I hardly expected to see any of you
  race-goers this evening."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely hoped to find you at home," was the lawyer's admission, as he
  seated himself in the chair to which Francis pointed.</p>

  <p>"I am here as a matter of policy," the latter confided. "I was engaged to
  dine at Storeham House, but Mr. Moss thought that I had better not go."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Moss was without doubt right," Sir Stephen pronounced gravely.</p>

  <p>"No coffee?" Francis continued. "You'll find cigars on the table at your
  right, also liqueurs and a little light literature if you have a fancy for
  it. You will discover all you don't know about me if you will just glance
  through those papers. I think it is in the top one there that I am described
  as 'the latest degenerate of an aristocracy which a more robust proletariat
  would have conducted to the guillotine a century ago'."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Sir Stephen replied, lighting his cigar and ignoring the pile
  of journals to which his host had pointed, "the newspapers won't tell me what
  I want to know about you."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly what the hell you're after."</p>

  <p>Francis raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Very strong language for a family lawyer!"</p>

  <p>"There is no language strong enough to express my feelings. May I speak to
  you plainly for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I can see you mean to whether I give you permission or not. Go ahead,
  then!"</p>

  <p>"Francis, Duke of Chatfield," Sir Stephen began solemnly, " I am
  responsible for digging you out of that monastery and bringing you back to
  England. I claim the right to ask a few plain questions."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I admit the right," Francis replied, "but ask
  them."</p>

  <p>"I have finished remonstrating with you as regards your extravagance. The
  course you are pursuing is a wicked and a selfish one, but if you choose to
  destroy the financial resources of your family, neither I nor any one else
  can stop you."</p>

  <p>"Your acknowledgment of that fact is so much to the good," Francis
  murmured. "Pray continue."</p>

  <p>"I have an even more serious charge to bring against you," the lawyer went
  on. "You start by treating the members of your family"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My family!" Francis interrupted, flinching.</p>

  <p>"Your family without a doubt," Sir Stephen insisted firmly. "You start by
  treating them, as I was about to say, with absurd generosity. You have
  actually encouraged them, individually and as a family, to live far beyond
  their means. They must owe you or some one large sums of money. On the other
  hand, you absolutely refuse to sign the quittance absolving them from
  responsibility for the money of yours spent during their occupancy of
  Chatfield."</p>

  <p>"So far," Francis acknowledged, "I find your conversation interesting.
  Your survey of the situation is luminous and exact. Pray continue."</p>

  <p>"With your permission I intend to do so. You deliberately affect tastes
  which I do not believe that you possess. You pose as a dissipated <i>rou</i>
  and I believe that at heart you're an ascetic. The whole business of last
  night was a pantomime. I do not believe that you were drunk at all. You are a
  very skillful boxer, they tell me, but I do not believe that you found the
  slightest pleasure in assaulting that policeman."</p>

  <p>"You're entirely wrong," Francis assured him. "The fellow had ginger hair
  and I hate a policeman with ginger hair."</p>

  <p>"Then as regards the fiasco of to-day," Sir Stephen continued. "I honestly
  believe that you had studied the whole situation, worked it out so as to keep
  within the letter of the law, and brought it to a climax, solely for the sake
  of some malicious pleasure you found in seeing the members of your family
  lose their money, and bringing the name you bear into ill-repute. What is the
  ultimate end of it all? What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means," Francis confessed, "that you are beginning to bore me. Just a
  little prolix, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen rose to his feet and helped himself to a whisky and soda. He
  set it down by his side and leaned over towards his host.</p>

  <p>"I will endeavour to be more direct," he said. "I charge you with
  preserving a malicious and destructive attitude towards every member of your
  family with whom you have been brought into contact. You have discouraged
  Eustace from taking up any work, and looked on tolerantly, even approvingly,
  when you knew quite well he has been gambling far beyond his means. You
  introduced Mr. Ambrosius to your uncle and you never said a word to stop his
  joining the Board of those rotten companies which Mr. Ambrosius pretended to
  finance. You have carefully encouraged Lady Monica in her extravagance, and
  at the same time you are doing your best in every direction and in every
  manner to bring into contempt and disrepute the name you bear. Just what does
  it mean? There's nothing prolix about that question. Give me a plain
  answer."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" Francis asked coolly. "You are not my guardian. I am
  responsible to no one."</p>

  <p>"I am not your guardian," Sir Stephen admitted, "but you are here to-day
  instead of in the monastery at Pellini entirely through my efforts."</p>

  <p>Francis reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You have a certain claim," he acknowledged. "I will answer your question
  on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Condition? Well?"</p>

  <p>"Secrecy until I give the word."</p>

  <p>"I consent," Sir Stephen declared. "The cards should be on the table
  between you and me at any rate."</p>

  <p>There was a curious change in Francis's demeanour. His somewhat cynical
  aloofness had been obviously a mood. He rose to his feet and moved restlessly
  about the room. His eyes were filled with slowly burning fires. He had become
  more human, though. His tone, when he spoke, was more natural.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, coming to a sudden standstill before his visitor's
  chair. "I want to condense. I could talk for hours. I want to put it all into
  minutes. I will go back to when I begin to remember&mdash;I was living in a
  villa, cut off from the world&mdash;a small, plainly furnished habitation,
  with a woman who was an angel&mdash;my mother&mdash;also cut off from the
  world. She was young, she was beautiful, she was fond of pleasure, of life
  and of gaiety, of music, and the sight of beautiful things. None of these
  natural diversions fell to her lot. She was guarded as though she were in
  prison. Every now and then, generally arriving by night, skulking in the
  gardens for a few days, unwilling even to accompany my mother to the little
  town near which we lived, terrified of any chance recognition, came a dour,
  drab man&mdash;my father. Granted that he spared my mother the one wrong you
  and the world at first believed, he made her life a living hell. For the sake
  of his family, his accursed name, he hid her out of the sunshine, he kept her
  hidden, she died hidden. She was sweet and beautiful, and, although she was
  poor, she was of as gentle a race as his. But the ogre of his great family
  stalked by his side, and for the sake of it he murdered my mother, body and
  soul. I heard her plead. I saw her despair. I saw her die. There is, thank
  God, more of her blood than his in my veins&mdash;the passionate, Italian,
  justice-loving blood &mdash;and since the day when I followed her coffin to
  the graveyard I have lived but with one thought&mdash;to pay back upon his
  own people some part of the misery he heaped upon her. I was like a mad being
  with that great overmastering longing. Then, at Confession, I had to part
  with the truth. There was one escape and they forced it upon me. They saved
  me from being an ordinary murderer&mdash;I am grateful to them for that. I
  took the vows. Then you came. You think that I should have come to this
  hateful country and borne this hateful name for any purpose save one? I
  loathe the place, I loathe my surroundings, I loathe the life I lead. But all
  the time things march to my purpose. Now you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," Sir Stephen said gravely.</p>

  <p>Francis threw himself back in his chair. He had the air of a man from whom
  something vital had escaped. He seemed weary, yet still filled with
  smouldering excitement.</p>

  <p>"I'll try and be as frank with you as you have been with me," his
  companion promised. "Your father was a selfish pig. Others found it out
  besides you. He treated your mother disgracefully. Well, he's dead."</p>

  <p>"He's dead, but the others aren't."</p>

  <p>"The others have no place in the show."</p>

  <p>"Haven't they?" Francis questioned drily. "There's a marble monument over
  my father's grave. There you may find all his quarterings, all the proud
  boastings of his titles, his long list of names. In life he was obsessed with
  the pride of race. In death he perpetuated it. Well, it's his name I am
  besmirching. If he doesn't know it and can't feel it, I'm sorry&mdash;but I
  believe he can and does."</p>

  <p>"It amounts to this, then," Sir Stephen summed up, "you're planning the
  ruin of the House of Chatfield."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Francis acquiesced. "And I don't think you will stop me."</p>

  <p>"I should not try," was the grave assurance.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because you will fail," Sir Stephen declared so earnestly that there was
  a tremor, almost a passion in his tone. "Because I believe that all great
  names &mdash;everything that is meant to endure&mdash;possess a soul. You can
  drag the name of the family&mdash;your own, by the bye&mdash;from the police
  court to the criminal court, from the criminal court to the gallows, if you
  will. You may bring disgrace and ruin upon every present member of the
  family, and even then you will have done nothing. There are many more
  Chatfields living. Another will take the name, purified maybe with suffering.
  The next generation of the family will atone for everything. Long after you
  and I are gone, there will be Chatfields moving through the pages of history,
  living down the memory of one degenerate generation. You are following a poor
  will-o'-the-wisp for a young man."</p>

  <p>There was for the moment a new expression in Francis's face&mdash;an
  expression almost of fear. His visitor's words were ominous; instinct with a
  certain ugly truth. It was one generation alone which he could strike&mdash;a
  flick of the whip against a block of granite. Sir Stephen, like a wise man,
  made no effort to press his advantage. He rose instead to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You will do me the justice to observe," he said, "that I have made no
  sort of appeal to you. I will only venture upon a word now. You will do no
  good to any one living or dead by travelling along your present path. Give it
  up. The past is finished&mdash;these people are responsible for nothing. Be a
  normal man. Marry. Take to yourself some of the happiness which your mother
  missed. Believe me that would please her most."</p>

  <p>"The honey of happiness would turn to gall in my heart," Francis declared
  bitterly. "You mean well, Sir Stephen. You're an honest man."</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven that I could make you a sensible one."</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head. His finger was upon the bell.</p>

  <p>"We have reached an anticlimax. You have inveigled me into making the
  situation clear. Nothing that you could say to me or I to you would make any
  difference."</p>

  <p>Sir Stephen moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You have qualities," he remarked quietly. "I shall live in hopes that you
  may come to regard this matter in its true light."</p>

  <p>Francis threw himself into his chair.</p>

  <p>"Tell Mr. Moss, if he is still there, to bring me round the Rappelli
  manuscripts himself," he directed the servant who was showing Sir Stephen
  out.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch207"
     name="ch207">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. MOSS, who presently appeared, was very voluble
concerning his new
  treasures. It was soon apparent to him, however, that his patron, although
  interested, was not giving him his undivided attention. It was in a measure a
  relief to both of them when Johnson announced another visitor.</p>

  <p>"You can show Mr. Ambrosius up," Francis directed. "I am afraid we shall
  have to postpone our discussion, Mr. Moss."</p>

  <p>The librarian took the hint and withdrew. Ambrosius entered a few moments
  later, flushed with wine, and with a curious gleam in his oriental eyes. He
  had been dining at a sporting club of which he was a member and there was
  further entertainment in store for him later on. He accepted the chair to
  which Francis pointed and a cigar. In his somewhat exuberant state he was
  inclined to be loquacious. He had lost that awe of Francis which kept him as
  a rule almost tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>"Keeping quiet to-night, eh?" he remarked, with a glance at his host's
  white tie and waistcoat. "Very likely you are right. Nothing else will be
  talked about in London to-night but the race. If the money was on," he added,
  with a cunning little gleam in his eyes, "it was a wonderful affair."</p>

  <p>Francis regarded him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I sent for you, Ambrosius," he said, " on a matter of business."</p>

  <p>"That is quite all right," Ambrosius assented. "I simply ventured on a
  very ordinary piece of gossip. It is not as though we were altogether
  strangers," he concluded, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"You will do well to forget the fact," Francis enjoined, " or I may
  remember it to your disadvantage." Ambrosius was disposed to be sulky.
  Francis took no notice, however, of his lowering brows.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Lord Eustace?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"The young man was in my rooms waiting for me when I got back from the
  races."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I agreed to let him have five thousand pounds on his note of hand,
  payable on demand."</p>

  <p>"Good. You have his acceptance?"</p>

  <p>"In my safe."</p>

  <p>"That makes how much that Lord Eustace owes you?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-two thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"And Lord Henry?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-seven thousand. I have your undertaking guaranteeing the payment
  of both amounts."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Francis admitted. "You will receive instructions from me as
  to the course of action I propose to pursue in a few days. Have you&mdash;by
  the bye&mdash;been approached by any other member of the family?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. What am I to do about Lady Monica if she comes?"</p>

  <p>"Does she owe anything?"</p>

  <p>"She owes a few thousands for <i>chemie</i>," Ambrosius announced. "I told
  them to give her credit as you desired. She has paid a portion of her losses,
  however. It's the future I'm thinking of. I happen to know that she backed
  'Laughing Sally' heavily."</p>

  <p>Francis was silent for several moments. Suddenly he came to a
  decision.</p>

  <p>"You can let Lady Monica have such money as she requires," he said, "on
  this occasion only. Persuade her to borrow enough to pay what she owes at
  your gambling hall, or whatever you call it, and to clear herself with her
  bookmaker. Send me her acceptance as soon as you get it, but what I am going
  to tell you about Lord Eustace and Lord Henry does not apply to her, you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, certainly."</p>

  <p>"On Monday morning," Francis continued, "you are to go to a
  solicitor&mdash;one of your own kidney, for choice&mdash;and issue a writ
  against Lord Henry and Lord Eustace for the total amount of their
  acceptances."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius removed the cigar from his mouth and stared at his host for a
  moment in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I say," he exclaimed, "isn't this a little bit rough? They imagine
  naturally that I will give them some notice before calling in loans like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Never mind what they imagine. The notes are all payable on demand. You
  find unexpectedly that you need the money."</p>

  <p>"But a writ!" Ambrosius protested. "Without any notice, either! It is
  scandalous treatment! How can I excuse myself to them?"</p>

  <p>"I do not admit that an excuse is necessary," was the cold reply, "but if
  it were, you have one. Did not both Lord Henry and Lord Eustace, when you
  questioned them as to their means, tell you that the twenty thousand a year
  upon which they subsist came from a Trust Fund?"</p>

  <p>"That's true enough," Ambrosius confessed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't," Francis said. "It is a voluntary allowance upon my
  part. They haven't five hundred a year between them. That, of course, doesn't
  matter to you, as I am guaranteeing your advance and you probably knew their
  exact position. You can quote the fact that you have been deceived, however,
  as an excuse for your harsh action."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius was without a doubt bewildered. He could make nothing of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>"What's it all mean?" he demanded. "You don't want to make your cousin and
  uncle bankrupt, surely? You knew they couldn't pay."</p>

  <p>Francis stared at his visitor with uplifted eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Your comprehension of this transaction is not necessary," he declared.
  "It remains only for you to do as you are told."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius threw away his cigar. It was not his custom to display his
  feelings but he was very angry indeed.</p>

  <p>"I shall need the acceptances," he explained, "before I can issue the
  writs."</p>

  <p>"I will fetch them for you," Francis replied. "Pray look at the evening
  paper or help yourself to a whisky and soda. I shall have to get the keys
  from Mr. Moss."</p>

  <p>He left the room. Ambrosius rose slowly to his feet and stared through the
  door after him. He was a man of many passions, none of which he had ever
  resisted. A new one had come to him within the last few minutes. His
  irritation against Francis had blazed into hatred. He clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ambrosius!"</p>

  <p>He swung round. It was a woman's voice, a familiar voice, too. Lady Monica
  had crossed the threshold from the small dining room and was gazing at him in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" she asked. "And where is my cousin?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ambrosius slowly recovered himself.</p>

  <p>"His Grace was here a minute ago," he answered. "He left me to fetch some
  papers. He will be back shortly. I&mdash;I had no idea there was any one else
  here."</p>

  <p>Monica subsided carelessly into the easy-chair which Francis had vacated.
  Her opera cloak fell back. She toyed with her necklace absently.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see my cousin for a moment or two," she explained, "so I took
  advantage of my knowledge of the house to come up quietly. There is a private
  staircase from the suite to the hall."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>Monica looked at him for a moment and he regretted his monosyllable. He
  also came to the conclusion that Lady Monica was the most beautiful woman he
  had ever seen in his life.</p>

  <p>"A bad race for you, Lady Monica, I am afraid," he observed
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Ruinous!" she admitted.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the closed door and lowered his voice. He had had some
  experience of women, even of Lady Monica's station in life, who needed
  money.</p>

  <p>"If any assistance on my part would be acceptable," he ventured, "I should
  like to remind you of what you already know."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?"</p>

  <p>"That I am your very devoted admirer."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with cold curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that just a little impertinent?"</p>

  <p>He flushed, but he was a very emotional person and far too much under the
  spell of her beauty to resent the careless contempt of her words.</p>

  <p>"I assure you that I did not mean it to be so," he declared. "My desire is
  to be of service to you."</p>

  <p>He made no movement. She fancied that she detected a note of additional
  respect in his tone. Her manner became slightly less frigid.</p>

  <p>"It is a coincidence that I should have met you here, Mr. Ambrosius. Only
  an hour ago Eustace was telling me of your wonderful generosity to him."</p>

  <p>"I do not call it generosity to lend money to a friend," he replied. "Your
  brother will return it some day. Besides, I make no secret of the fact that I
  am a money-lender by profession, as my father was before me. He made a great
  fortune by it. Luckily for me: I am able to choose my clients or leave the
  business alone altogether if I prefer it."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would like to lend me five thousand pounds?" Monica asked
  calmly.</p>

  <p>Ambrosius affected more surprise than he really felt.</p>

  <p>"You?" he exclaimed. "Well, that is rather a different matter."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Your brother and father will certainly pay me back some day," he
  explained, " and in any case I am getting a 'quid pro quo.' Your brother has
  put me up for one of his clubs and your father has asked me to dine. You see,
  I am perfectly frank with you&mdash;I am that sort. Now as regards you, Lady
  Monica, have you any prospect of being able to pay me back?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever unless I should marry a rich man," she admitted. "I suppose
  you'd get it some day."</p>

  <p>"That's just a little vague, isn't it?" he pointed out. "You're not even
  engaged, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest sign of it," she acknowledged. "Matrimonially, I am
  afraid I am not a success. Young men mostly seem terrified of me and the
  middle-aged ones, this season at any rate, are all running after
  flappers."</p>

  <p>Ambrosius, worthy descendant of a long line of money-getters, was a
  hard-headed man where business was concerned. He inherited to the fullest
  extent, however, the weakness of his race. He was tete-a-tete with the most
  beautiful and the most desirable woman he had ever known. His eyes devoured
  her long bare arms with their shapely beauty, her alabaster skin, the curve
  of her mouth about which the most famous of French artists had raved, the
  almost insolent grace of her slim body. He felt himself carried away.</p>

  <p>"You can have five thousand, or fifty thousand, or five hundred thousand
  pounds&mdash;on terms."</p>

  <p>"What terms?"</p>

  <p>"Marriage," he muttered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>There was a faint contraction of her eyebrows. She looked at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Marriage? Whose marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Yours."</p>

  <p>"To whom?"</p>

  <p>"To me."</p>

  <p>She threw herself back in her chair and laughed uncontrollably. He watched
  her as though mesmerised. She was at least, he decided, not angry.</p>

  <p>"The idea seems to appeal to your sense of humour," he ventured.</p>

  <p>"It certainly does," she admitted.</p>

  <p>He drew a step nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica," he begged, "why don't you think of it? I know I'm a good
  bit older than you, but after all I'm only forty-five and I haven't burnt the
  candle at both ends like most of these young fellows. Mr. Ambrosius of London
  may not be a very important person, but my grandfather was a well-known Greek
  statesman&mdash;he, or my father or I could have bought a title at any moment
  if we'd thought it worth while. I prefer the one I have&mdash;the one most
  people give me&mdash;Mr. Ambrosius, millionaire."</p>

  <p>Monica wiped her eyes and sat up in her chair.</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," she said. "It sounds most attractive. Are you really a
  millionaire?"</p>

  <p>"I can prove it any minute you like," he declared. "I'll settle half a
  million upon you&mdash;cash. Lady Monica&mdash;Monica!"</p>

  <p>He leaned towards her. His hand rested upon her bare shoulder. She sprang
  up with a little cry of anger.</p>

  <p>"How dare you touch me?" she cried. "You beast!"</p>

  <p>She held her arm tightly where he had touched it. He shrank back before
  the fury of her eyes. Then at the same moment they were both conscious of the
  fact that Francis had opened the door and was standing upon the threshold,
  looking in.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch208"
     name="ch208">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FRANCIS closed the door behind him and advanced into the
room. It was
  Monica who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Don't look so horrified, Francis," she begged. "I will explain my coming
  presently. Ask that person to leave, will you," she went on, pointing to
  Ambrosius. "He has annoyed me."</p>

  <p>Francis rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean, Ambrosius?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I ventured to ask Lady Monica to marry me, that's all," was the unsteady
  reply.</p>

  <p>Monica laughed softly with her eyes fixed upon her cousin.</p>

  <p>"To marry him!" she repeated ironically.</p>

  <p>"In any case," Francis said, throwing open the door, "you perceive that
  your attentions are distasteful to Lady Monica. Perhaps you had better leave
  us."</p>

  <p>"I shall certainly go," Ambrosius acquiesced, with a significant glance at
  the clock. "It would be a pity to disturb your <i>tte--tte</i>."</p>

  <p>Neither Francis nor Monica moved. A servant made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Show this gentleman out," Francis directed. Ambrosius went without a
  backward glance. The door was closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"What an insufferable person!" Monica exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"In his place, I find that he has his uses," Francis rejoined coldly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a question in her eyes to which he failed to
  respond.</p>

  <p>I suppose you're shocked with me for coming to your house at this time of
  night," she said. "I can't help it. I had to come and I am here. It isn't
  your reputation which is being imperilled, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Please sit down," Francis begged.</p>

  <p>"May I?" Monica asked, returning to her easy-chair. "Do you know that that
  brute actually touched me. If you hadn't come in, I believe that he would
  have tried to kiss me!"</p>

  <p>"You are looking beautiful enough, Monica, to turn the head of a stronger
  man than Ambrosius," Francis observed, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>Monica's whole expression suddenly softened. Her eyes shone with
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"A compliment from you, Francis!" she exclaimed. "Do you really think that
  I look nice? This gown is supposed to be quite wonderful. Madame declared
  that I was the only woman in London who could wear it and still appear
  respectable."</p>

  <p>The cloak slipped from her shoulders and she stood up for a moment. To
  Francis's untutored eyes the gown seemed nothing but a little mist of
  smoke-coloured material. Yet he, too, was conscious of the daring outline;
  the hand of the artist which had disclosed what at the same time it
  concealed.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen you look more beautiful," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think so to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why to-night?" he asked, looking down at her.</p>

  <p>She pointed to the light which hung over the table.</p>

  <p>"Turn that out, will you?" she begged. "It shines in my eyes, and although
  I am pretty hardened, I am going to say something which will make me feel
  horribly ashamed."</p>

  <p>Francis obeyed her in silence. There was only one heavily shaded lamp
  burning. In the obscurity the beauty of her profile was almost bewildering;
  her eyes, which held his, were curiously bright. He felt his self-possession
  at peril.</p>

  <p>"You know the time?" he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about me," she confided. "They all think that I am at
  Lady Panner's dance, and they won't expect me home until three o'clock. ? Can
  you guess what I have come for?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I want five thousand pounds," she said slowly. "Will you give it to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I might," he answered, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"When I found Mr. Ambrosius here," she went on, "I tried to borrow it from
  him&mdash;after all, he is a money-lender."</p>

  <p>"And he refused?"</p>

  <p>"Worse," she confessed. "He asked me to marry him."</p>

  <p>Francis's eyes flashed for a moment. He crushed down the feeling of anger,
  however.</p>

  <p>"I am very ignorant of such matters," he observed quietly, "but isn't it
  quite a common thing nowadays for girls to marry for money?"</p>

  <p>"Some girls, yes," she assented.</p>

  <p>"There was a young girl of nineteen," he continued, "whom I met at your
  mother's reception the other evening. She seemed to be scarcely out of the
  school-room. Didn't some one tell me that she was married to a stockbroker of
  sixty, or something like that?"</p>

  <p>"Quite true&mdash;a most repulsive person, too."</p>

  <p>"And Lady Herington's daughter"</p>

  <p>"You need not go on," she interrupted. "There are a great many young women
  who sell their bodies for the badge of respectability represented by a
  marriage certificate and the luxury it brings. It is a common bargain
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"You can bear with very plain speaking?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Truth never offends."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she said in a low tone, "there are people who would
  consider the truth immodest. I don't. I shall tell you just what I feel about
  it. I would consider myself, body and soul, cleaner and more honest to give
  myself to the man for whom I was able to feel&mdash;love or passion, or
  whatever you may like to call it&mdash;than to marry a man I felt nothing for
  and pretend to give him all that a woman has to give."</p>

  <p>"I see," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I must have that five thousand pounds, Francis," she went on. "Mr.
  Ambrosius offered it to me if I would marry him, and I felt outraged. I felt
  as though some one had torn the clothes from my back. I ask you to give it to
  me, Francis, because I am afraid of nothing."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the room was suddenly stifling. It had been in the open
  air when last he had felt that wave of tumultuous feeling, with their car
  gliding through the pine-scented forest, and the twilight stealing upon them.
  What a struggle it had been to forget! And now&mdash;it was back again,
  stronger than himself, stronger than his consecrated life. He sank on his
  knee, and the cling of her arms around his neck seemed the sweetest thing his
  seared life had ever known. Their lips met.</p>

  <p>"Monica!" he cried.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly with her face against his.</p>

  <p>"You don't really hate me, you know," she whispered happily. "You pretend
  to, but you don't."</p>

  <p>"God knows I don't!" he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>He drew away a moment or two later, tenderly and without haste. Monica
  covered her face with her hands. She was too full of emotion for any sense of
  triumph; too happy in those few seconds to ask herself where this might lead.
  She heard Francis cross the room and seat himself at the writing table. She
  heard the scratching of his pen.</p>

  <p>"Where are you, Francis?" she called softly, without moving her hands.</p>

  <p>"I am writing a cheque," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Bother the cheque! Come back to me! Come back at once or I shall be
  miserable."</p>

  <p>"One minute," he begged.</p>

  <p>He finished his task, rose and brought the cheque across the room. He
  pressed it into her reluctant fingers. She held out her arms.</p>

  <p>"Francis, after all, I am ashamed," she confessed.</p>

  <p>"You are sorry you came?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered passionately. "I am glad ? glad of everything. Kiss
  me!"</p>

  <p>She opened her arms. Once more his world of self-renunciation fell from
  beneath his feet. He felt her clasped fingers around him&mdash;felt her slip
  so easily and sweetly into his embrace&mdash;a torrent of
  words&mdash;incoherent, mad words&mdash;rushed to his lips. He was scarcely
  conscious of the soft opening of the door. It was she who first looked round.
  In the half-light she could dimly discern the figure of a woman standing upon
  the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Francis! Why are you sitting in the darkness? I'm not late, am
  I?"</p>

  <p>The figure at the door felt for the switch and the room was suddenly
  flooded with light. Peggy Layton&mdash;in a bizarre opera cloak and with
  jewels flashing in her hair&mdash;was suddenly revealed. She stared before
  her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon!" she exclaimed. "I suppose I ought not to have come up
  without being announced. I'm very sorry."</p>

  <p>No one said a word. Monica rose slowly to her feet and folded her opera
  cloak around her shoulders. Francis, with an absolutely mechanical gesture,
  would have helped her, but she stepped quickly back. Suddenly she saw a
  crumpled-up piece of paper on the floor&mdash;the cheque. She stooped, picked
  it up and tore it into four pieces.</p>

  <p>"I'm frightfully sorry," Peggy Layton declared. "You were expecting me,
  though, weren't you, Francis? And you told me to come up whenever I
  liked."</p>

  <p>Monica moved towards the door. The newcomer stood on one side. Francis
  took a step forward. Then Monica spoke for the first time. She scarcely
  recognised her own voice. To Francis each word was horrible.</p>

  <p>"Be so good," she begged, " as to allow me to leave here alone. I know my
  way perfectly."</p>

  <p>She passed out. Francis stood, staring with fixed eyes at the door which
  she had closed behind her, white and motionless, filled with the horror of a
  sudden and terrible realisation. Peggy Layton, with a little shrug of her
  shoulders, tossed her cloak on the back of a chair and helped herself to a
  cigarette from the table. She had been afraid of Francis always and she was
  more than ever afraid of him now, but she had no idea of showing it.</p>

  <p>"I'm beastly sorry, Francis," she said. "I'm sure no one downstairs knew
  that Lady Monica was here. She must have come up the other way. You'll be
  able to explain it and make everything all right."</p>

  <p>Her words tortured him. She moved towards the chair where Monica had been
  sitting. He stopped her with a sharp exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Don't sit there," he insisted almost fiercely. She permitted herself a
  little grimace.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I'm ready to do whatever you want me to, only let's be
  reasonable."</p>

  <p>"What I want you to do," he declared, "is to go."</p>

  <p>"To go?" she repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"At once, please," he insisted. "I don't want you to stay in this
  room."</p>

  <p>"Because she has been here, I suppose!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Peggy Layton picked up her cloak and wrapped it around her. Her
  self-respect had received its last blow.</p>

  <p>"If I go," she threatened, " I shall never come back again. You know what
  that means."</p>

  <p>"It is my wish," he answered. "You have served your purpose. You have made
  people believe what I wanted them to believe. You have done it just a little
  too well. Forgive me if I am discourteous. I beg you to go now."</p>

  <p>He held the door open for her. She laughed up at him, a coquette to the
  end.</p>

  <p>"I can't be angry with you, Francis," she confessed. "I have played your
  game and you've more than kept your word. I'm sorry if I've upset
  things&mdash;but I haven't really."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>He seemed to breathe more freely now that she had crossed the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>"You two," she pointed out, "you belong to the same world. You'll tell her
  the truth and she'll know that it is the truth. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He closed the door after her, and stepped back into the enchanted
  room.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch209"
     name="ch209">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE more Lord Henry stood upon the hearthrug of the
library at Chatfield
  Castle, Lady Susan sat in an easy-chair knitting, and Eustace, with his hands
  in his pockets, stared through the great window out across the park. This
  time, however, they were visitors, summoned to the interview which they had
  requested with the head of the house. Francis, as yet, had not made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd put that damned knitting away, Susan," Lord Henry remarked
  irritably. "It gets on my nerves to see you working away there as though
  nothing had happened or was likely to happen."</p>

  <p>"Better accustom yourself to it, Henry," his wife rejoined calmly. "There
  seems to be more chance than ever now that I may be doing it for a living
  next week."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! I wonder where the devil Francis is!" "Rotten bad form to keep
  us waiting like this," Eustace grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Francis is in the oak room talking to Sir Stephen," Lady Susan confided.
  "I saw them through the window as we passed."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he'll see us," Lord Henry ruminated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'll see us right enough," Eustace muttered. "The only question is
  whether his seeing us will do us any good. We got it pretty straight from Sir
  Stephen, you know. He doesn't believe you'll be able to touch Francis for a
  sixpence."</p>

  <p>"I must confess that I am looking forward to the interview with some
  apprehension," Lord Henry admitted.</p>

  <p>"I can't think how we all drifted into such an infernal mess," Eustace
  remarked gloomily.</p>

  <p>"When this is all over," his mother sighed, " I don't think you'll scoff
  quite so much at my little shop in Bond Street. Thank goodness, silk jumpers
  are coming in again."</p>

  <p>"After all," Lord Henry pointed out, " the fellow is head of the family,
  although he's made such a hash of things. He can't see us both in the
  bankruptcy court. &mdash;I wish Monica wouldn't wander off like this. Somehow
  I feel that she understands him better than any of us."</p>

  <p>"There was a time," Lady Susan reflected, "when I felt quite sure that
  Monica would be the means of bringing us into closer touch with this strange
  young man."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can give up the idea once and for all," Eustace said dismally.
  "She can't even bear to hear his name mentioned. She's pretending now that
  she wants to talk to Mr. Moss, just to keep out of the way."</p>

  <p>"When does Monica leave us?" her father enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not for another ten days or so," Lady Susan replied. "She is joining
  Grace at Mentone."</p>

  <p>"I take off my hat to Monica," Eustace declared, with a note of genuine
  admiration in his tone. "If any one had told me that it was possible to touch
  Aunt Grace for a cool five thou I should have thought that he was a raving
  lunatic. Why, I remember down at Cowes two years ago, I wanted a pony to pay
  my hotel bill, and she was quite stuffy about it."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," his mother reminded him, a that Monica is practically
  going to take charge of her aunt. She is spending the whole of the winter at
  Mentone with her, then taking her to Marienbad."</p>

  <p>"She'll have paid a pretty stiff price for her five thou before she's
  finished if she has to cart Aunt Grace about for the rest of her life,"
  Eustace observed, turning away from the window. "Well, we shall soon be out
  of our agony now. They're coming along the terrace."</p>

  <p>Lady Susan glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"The same time and the same month as when Francis paid us his first
  visit."</p>

  <p>"And a rotten time we've had of it ever since!" Eustace groaned. "On the
  whole, I think Francis has only himself to thank for the mess we're in. He
  kept on making it as easy as possible for us to get more money. Whoever could
  have guessed, though, that this fellow Ambrosius would have turned out such a
  blackguard? Monica's fault, that, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I attach no blame whatever to your sister," Lord Henry declared. "Any
  idea of a union between her and Mr. Ambrosius would have been most repugnant
  to me."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," Eustace grumbled, "but I don't see why she need
  have offended him."</p>

  <p>"That sort of person takes offence so easily," his mother sighed. "Just
  think how careful we always have to be at the tenants' yearly festivities.
  Only last Christmas Mr. Grimes, the butcher, left in a huff, because I forgot
  one of his dances."</p>

  <p>"I remember that," Lord Henry said. "Impertinent fellow sent in his bill
  the next week!&mdash;How are you, Francis? How are you, Sir Stephen?" he
  added, as the two men stepped in through the terrace window. We're here in
  good time, you see."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded to the two men and, crossing the room, raised his aunt's
  fingers to his lips. Then he looked around with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Monica is well, I trust?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody ever knows when there is anything the matter with Monica," Lady
  Susan replied. "She seems very tired. You know, I suppose, that she is going
  to spend the winter with her aunt."</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing."</p>

  <p>"My sister is Monica's godmother," Lady Susan continued. "She has recently
  come to Monica's assistance in some financial embarrassments, and in return I
  think the dear child is going to devote some time to her."</p>

  <p>"And God help her!" Eustace exclaimed fervently.</p>

  <p>"I cannot remember, Francis," his aunt observed, "whether you ever met my
  sister Grace. She is, I am afraid, rather a trying person."</p>

  <p>"I once had that pleasure," he admitted. "I gathered that she was an
  invalid."</p>

  <p>"An invalid of the Bath-cum-Cheltenham-cum-Carlsbad type," Eustace
  explained. "Too fat to live and too frightened to die. She is attended
  already by three chows, a vinegary-faced companion and a sort of John Brown
  major-domo to whom she'll probably leave all her spare cash. There's no doubt
  about it, Monica's paying a thousand per cent. for her money."</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause. Lord Henry cleared his throat portentously.</p>

  <p>"We must offer you our congratulations, Francis," he declared. "I see that
  the stewards have very wisely taken a reasonable view of 'Grey Lady's'
  success."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," Francis admitted drily. "I believe, though, that half
  the people who frequent race courses still believe that I am a sharper."</p>

  <p>His uncle frowned.</p>

  <p>"I am convinced that you are mistaken. Whenever a Chatfield has owned a
  racing stable the horses have been run first for sport and secondly for the
  public. Your grandfather's first Derby was the most popular win of his
  generation."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am the first of the family who has ever been 'warned off',"
  Francis observed. Lord Henry shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Oblige me, nephew, by not making use of such extreme phrases." he begged.
  "The hint you received from the stewards to await their decision does not
  amount to anything so drastic."</p>

  <p>Francis turned away from the window with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>"My stay here is a very short one," he remarked. "It would gratify me to
  see Monica."</p>

  <p>"By all means, by all means," Lord Henry acquiesced, ringing the bell.
  "She came up with us, but I think she is talking to Mr. Moss. Very good
  you've been to that fellow, Francis.&mdash;Parkins, ask Lady Monica to step
  this way," he added to the servant who had answered his summons.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Moss is an excellent librarian," Francis said coldly. "I like so far
  as possible to treat people according to their deserts."</p>

  <p>"Just so," his uncle agreed nervously. "I think, Sir Stephen," he added,
  turning to the lawyer who was talking to Lady Susan, "that it would be as
  well to explain to Francis the exact reason why we have asked for this
  interview."</p>

  <p>"As briefly as possible, if you please," the latter enjoined.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Lord Henry acceded. "It has become
  necessary&mdash;er&mdash;to lay certain facts before you ? facts which, I am
  sure, that for the honour of the house you will consider seriously."</p>

  <p>Francis seated himself in a high-backed chair a little away from the
  general circle.</p>

  <p>"Let me hear them," he begged.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stephen will explain our position," Lord Henry murmured.</p>

  <p>"The affair lies in a nutshell," the lawyer pronounced, rising to his feet
  and standing by Lord Henry's side on the hearthrug. "Lord Henry and Lord
  Eustace are both in serious financial trouble. They have consulted me and
  announced their desire to lay the position before you. As legal adviser to
  the family they have asked me to put you in possession of certain facts."</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to listen," Francis announced in a colourless tone.</p>

  <p>"Lord Henry has been indiscreet in his expenditures, and your Cousin
  Eustace has been backing the wrong horses," Sir Stephen continued.
  "Notwithstanding your generous allowance, they both needed to borrow money.
  They were introduced&mdash;I think by you, in the first place&mdash;to Mr.
  Ambrosius, whose very extraordinary behaviour has placed them in their
  present grave position."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary behaviour?" Francis repeated questioningly.</p>

  <p>"I think that even you will admit that to be a mild term. Mr. Ambrosius,
  apparently anxious to stand well with the various members of your family,
  seems to have almost encouraged your uncle and your cousin here to borrow
  money, asking for no security and lending it on note of hand only. No time
  for repayment was fixed, so no default has really occurred. Yet, last week he
  seems to have taken the most extraordinary action. He has issued writs
  against both of them for the whole amount of their indebtedness. This action
  of his is presumably due to some imagined slight offered him by one of the
  family."</p>

  <p>"What are the amounts concerned?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"I must confess that they are reprehensibly heavy," Sir Stephen admitted.
  "Lord Henry here appears to owe the man twenty-seven thousand pounds and
  Eustace about thirty-two thousand."</p>

  <p>"I thought that 'Laughing Sally' was a cert," Eustace declared ruefully.
  "I was on at nine to one, too."</p>

  <p>"Your own indebtedness seems rather large, Lord Henry," Francis observed.
  "You don't bet, do you?"</p>

  <p>"The amount of my own indebtedness has been a constant source of amazement
  to me, I must confess," his uncle admitted. "I fear that I must be somewhat
  extravagant. The cost of maintaining two establishments also in these days is
  considerable."</p>

  <p>"To which two do you refer?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry for a moment was speechless. Fortunately Lady Susan
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"The Dower House here, which you have been kind enough to let us consider
  as our country home and the house we have rented in Charles Street&mdash;two
  very large establishments, Francis, although your allowances have been most
  generous. I can assure you that the books for some months have made my heart
  ache. The price of bacon alone"</p>

  <p>"I do not think that Lord Henry's twenty-seven thousand pounds has gone in
  bacon," Francis interrupted.</p>

  <p>Lord Henry frowned covertly at his nephew.</p>

  <p>"I must retrench&mdash;I certainly will retrench," he promised. "In
  particular there is one little extravagance I undertake to abandon."</p>

  <p>"You refer," Francis began&mdash; ? "Dad means the two cars," Eustace
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. As a matter of fact, I think that we ought to try and do at
  present without a car at all. One can hire in London so easily nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Was Francis referring to motor cars?" Lady Susan asked, looking at them
  over her spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Of course, my dear, of course," her husband assured her.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you hear him say so?" Eustace demanded.</p>

  <p>The door was quietly opened and Monica entered. Francis gripped the sides
  of his chair for a moment before he rose. It was their first meeting since
  the night of that amazing medley of passion and tragedy in his rooms at
  Chatfield House. There was no change in her expression, scarcely any in her
  demeanour. She nodded indifferently to Francis and settled herself
  comfortably in an easy- chair.</p>

  <p>"How are you, dear Cousin?" she murmured. "Why am I summoned to this
  family conclave?"</p>

  <p>"At my wish," Francis rejoined a little harshly. "Your father and brother
  have sent for me to tell me of their difficulties. It is my desire that you
  should hear my reply to them."</p>

  <p>"How very mysterious!" she exclaimed. "I scarcely see, though, why I
  should be dragged into it."</p>

  <p>"Every member of this family is concerned in what I have to say," Francis
  assured her.</p>

  <p>"The family," his uncle reminded him, "of which you happen to be the
  head."</p>

  <p>"Nominally," Francis admitted. "I am now going to tell you all why I
  yielded to Sir Stephen's persuasions and came back from Pellini to live this
  life of tawdriness and shams and call myself Duke of Chatfield. I came back
  for one reason and with one intention&mdash;to bring as much disgrace,
  dishonour, and infamy as I could upon the House of Chatfield."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Everyone except Sir Stephen showed signs of
  amazement. The fall of Lady Susan's knitting was in its way almost
  dramatic.</p>

  <p>"I knew there was something queer about the fellow," Eustace muttered half
  to himself.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this rather like fouling your own nest?" the lawyer asked coldly.
  "You cannot escape from the fact that you yourself are the head of the
  family."</p>

  <p>"The titular head; no more, I can assure you," Francis declared. "I ask
  you all&mdash;have I, during the period of my residence in England, behaved
  in any way as though I were proud of my name and position? Think! I have been
  dragged into a police court in the early morning, muddy and dishevelled, and
  fined the maximum amount and costs for taking part in what was described as a
  drunken brawl. I have set every sporting paper in the country casting
  aspersions upon my honesty. I have been seen at public places with
  disreputable people. I have encouraged you all to continue in your little
  vicious circles. You were not deep enough in the mire when I made my first
  appearance here. That is why I made your allowances unnecessarily large. I
  wanted you where you are now. Ambrosius, your philanthropic money-lender,
  millionaire though he may be, was my puppet, luring you on to borrow at my
  orders. You have sent for me to tell me that there are writs out against you
  for every penny you've ever had from him. You might have spared yourselves
  the trouble. Those writs were issued, not in a fit of pique as you imagine,
  but at my orders. In a fortnight's time you, Lord Henry, and you, Eustace,
  will be in the bankruptcy court. From to-day I stop your allowances. Sir
  Stephen will pay to Lady Susan two thousand, and to Lady Monica, a thousand a
  year. To you men not a penny. You must either work, or become pensioners upon
  your womenfolk."</p>

  <p>Whatever they had expected or feared this was more terrible both in the
  substance and the telling. A sort of frozen horror seemed to settle upon the
  little company. Monica was the only one who showed no signs of
  discomposure.</p>

  <p>"After all," she admitted, " I am glad that you sent for me&mdash;dear
  Cousin Francis. This sidelight upon your somewhat elusive personality is, to
  say the least of it, interesting. I don't suppose you need me to tell you
  that I decline to touch a penny of your money."</p>

  <p>"So do I," Lady Susan declared firmly. "I shall start my little shop in
  Bond Street."</p>

  <p>Monica rose to her feet in leisurely fashion and came to the hearthrug,
  facing Francis. She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"This interesting but rather melodramatic scene," she said, "takes me back
  to the evening when we first met upon the ramparts of Pellini. You spoke then
  with a somewhat virulent eloquence of your hatred for some one or
  other&mdash;our family, I suppose. What wrong have you suffered from us? You
  were spared the obvious one&mdash;unfortunately, as it would seem."</p>

  <p>"Do you really wish to know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am extremely curious," she assured him.</p>

  <p>Francis followed Monica's example and also rose to his feet. His action
  seemed less one of courtesy than a desire to accept the challenge which she
  had thrust upon him. His eyes were lit with sombre fires.</p>

  <p>"You will no doubt," he said, "discover more melodrama still in the story
  I propose to tell. You will also, however, hear truth."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch210"
     name="ch210">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOUR of the people in the great library hung with obvious
absorption upon
  the words of the young man who had at last thrown concealment aside. Monica
  alone listened with a sort of contemptuous toleration. As for Francis
  himself, the note of passion which had trembled in his tone a few minutes
  before had gone. He had become the leisurely narrator of a page of family
  history.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-seven years ago," he began, "Francis William, seventh Duke of
  Chatfield, travelled in Italy in becoming state: a painter, a dilettante,
  something of an archeologist, something of a man of fashion. At Pellini he
  met my grandfather and his daughter, my mother. My grandfather was the sole
  remaining member of the family of Pellini&mdash;a family as noble at least as
  the race of Chatfield. His daughter, my mother, was beautiful, well-educated,
  and had indeed made her bow at the Court of her Queen. But they were poor,
  these two, miserably poor. They lived on the last of their small farms. Their
  little pressing of wine, their olives and their figs were almost all they had
  to subsist upon. It was an easy conquest for Francis, Duke of Chatfield.
  Without a doubt my mother loved him or she would never have
  consented&mdash;but I anticipate. My grandfather died. My mother was left
  alone in the world. She disappeared with Francis Chatfield. They apparently
  went to Rome and were married there. No one heard of their marriage. My
  father, although he must have known what was in the minds of every one, seems
  to have taken particularly good care to have breathed no word of the ceremony
  to a living soul. Presently he brought his wife back to a small villa near
  Pellini where he established her. There I was born. There, through the years,
  he visited her stealthily and furtively. She had no friends. The world took
  her at the valuation which my father's ghastly selfishness imposed upon her.
  There she lived and there she died, without a single one of the compensations
  to which, as Duchess of Chatfield, she was entitled. My father spent,
  perhaps, two months of the year with her, sometimes less. She prayed to be
  taken to England. He always made excuses. She prayed to be introduced to his
  family, to be given her proper position. He evaded her with some falsehoods
  as to her religion. So she grew older and tired through sheer loneliness. The
  women of those southern races need love more even than you cold English
  people. She withered for the lack of it and died. My father was not present
  even at the funeral. He faded from that day out of my life. There was a
  little money&mdash;enough to educate me at the common schools&mdash;and a
  condition that I should never come to England until I was sent for. That is
  how Francis William, seventh Duke of Chatfield, treated the woman whom he
  married. That is how he fulfilled his deathbed trust to that poor worn-out
  Italian aristocrat. That is the tender consideration he showed to me, his
  son; leaving me to be brought up nameless, to watch the tragedy of my
  mother's waning days.&mdash;Things are, I hope, a little clearer to you all
  now."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Lord Henry said gloomily, "he married your mother."</p>

  <p>"And why?" Francis demanded. "Because he was a man so spoiled that
  existence was impossible to him unless he had his own way, and she would
  become his on no other terms. And listen to this: I would rather a thousand
  times that he had brought me into the world a bastard and given my mother the
  love for lack of which she faded and died, than that he should have gone
  through that cold little ceremony which made me Duke of Chatfield and her a
  weary, neglected saint. Can you realise the smallness of the man? He resented
  the price he paid for her; brooded over it until his love grew cold and her
  heart was broken."</p>

  <p>"There is at least one thing to be remembered," Sir Stephen urged. "Your
  father went out one morning a strong man and was brought home at night with a
  broken neck. We have no right to assume that he did not mean at some time or
  another to send for you and disclose his secret."</p>

  <p>Francis turned towards the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"You were his confidential adviser, were you not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever tell you that he was married?"</p>

  <p>"He did not," Sir Stephen admitted reluctantly. Francis shrugged his
  shoulders and turned away.</p>

  <p>"He had plenty of time," he said. "A good many years, if you come to
  reckon them up."</p>

  <p>"Francis," Lord Henry pleaded, "this is a terrible story but I am an old
  man. Bankruptcy would kill me."</p>

  <p>"It would make it impossible for me to get a job," Eustace groaned.</p>

  <p>Francis looked at them both, unmoved.</p>

  <p>"What do your lives or your futures matter to me?" he demanded coldly. "My
  mother died at twenty-nine. She, who should be sitting in that chair," he
  added, pointing to where Lady Susan's forgotten knitting lay at her feet,
  "Duchess of Chatfield, an honour to her name, as she most certainly would
  have been. What do I care what becomes of the whole brood of you?
  Interlopers! Selfish, fawning parasites, glutted with luxury, without a
  thought in your minds except how to amuse yourselves until to-morrow! She
  died in a cheap villa, on a bare hillside, without enough money to buy the
  flowers for the garden she loved, with a few books, a few pictures, a little
  music, a sunset now and then to watch. She lived beautifully and she died of
  a broken heart, because of the foul selfishness and pig-headed pride of
  Francis William, seventh Duke of Chatfield."</p>

  <p>His almost unnatural composure had for the moment deserted him. His voice
  shook, his eyes blazed. He moved to the bell and rang it, motioning with his
  hand towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Now, for the second time," he continued, "and this time for
  ever&mdash;out, all of you!&mdash;out of my house! Find your way where you
  will, how you will, but out! Leave this room! Leave me alone&mdash;or
  anything may happen!"</p>

  <p>Lord Henry was almost a man again. He assisted his wife to rise.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he enjoined, "we must do as this young man says. Eustace, come
  with us. After all, others have had to face worse things. The workhouse is
  better than the guillotine."</p>

  <p>Lady Susan patted her husband's hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, dear," she begged. "My little shop will see us all
  through."</p>

  <p>They left the room. It was almost a dignified departure. Francis waited
  until the door was closed. Then he turned to Monica, who, some time
  previously, had sunk into the chair which she seemed now indisposed to
  leave.</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica," he began.</p>

  <p>"Dear Cousin Francis," she replied mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I thought that I had made my wishes clear."</p>

  <p>"So few of us know what is good for us," she sighed. "It seems to me that
  you have been alone a great deal too much already."</p>

  <p>"I desire to talk to Sir Stephen," he told her stiffly. "Go on, then! I
  sha'n't interfere."</p>

  <p>"Our conversation will be private."</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't listen," she promised.</p>

  <p>The lawyer intervened with some diffidence.</p>

  <p>"Lady Monica, may I say just one word? Whatever you may think of your
  cousin's attitude, and however much you may resent it, the fact remains that
  he is master here."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I can only answer you," Sir Stephen rejoined, "by saying that my sole
  object in waiting is to place my resignation in his Grace's hands. I have no
  desire to administer further the affairs of the house."</p>

  <p>"Because I mete out justice!" Francis protested scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Justice before a self-appointed tribunal and pronounced by a self-
  appointed judge," Sir Stephen declared vigorously. "No sane man would approve
  of your attitude."</p>

  <p>Monica rose deliberately to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you what I think?" she asked. "That was really what I stayed
  behind for."</p>

  <p>"If you choose," he replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"I think," she pronounced, speaking without anger, and with a slow
  tantalising smile, "that you are an intolerant, melodramatic figure of
  misery, vindictive and idiotic, simply because those years in your cell have
  warped all sense of proportion in your mind. Fate has made it possible for
  you to deal out suffering with a liberal hand. As soon as you have done it,
  you will repent. I really cannot be very angry with you. You are of the stuff
  monks are made of&mdash;not men. Good-by, dear Cousin Francis. You see you
  are going to have your way. I am leaving you. Good-by, Francis!"</p>

  <p>She moved lightly across the room, looking back from the threshold with a
  little wave of the hand. They were all gone now. His moment of triumph was
  over. As she passed down the hall, Monica was singing a bar or two of the
  song with which she had first tormented him at Pellini.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch211"
     name="ch211">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONICA, on the morning of her twice-deferred departure for
Mentone,
  suddenly yielded to an unaccountable impulse. She dressed for her journey an
  hour or two before it was necessary and walked swiftly across to the great
  empty house at the corner of Grosvenor Square. She was admitted with very
  little delay. Johnson himself came hurrying from the back regions to greet
  her.</p>

  <p>"Any news of his Grace, my lady?" he enquired anxiously.</p>

  <p>Monica shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We have heard nothing," she said. For a single moment she felt her errand
  difficult. Johnson stood before her in an attitude of deferential
  interest.</p>

  <p>"I had a fancy," she explained, "before I left England, to have a look at
  the tapestries in the room which his Grace kept for himself."</p>

  <p>"If you will allow me, my lady," Johnson answered, turning around.</p>

  <p>She followed him to the suite cut off from the rest of the house, followed
  him along the darkened hallway and corridors, through silent rooms covered
  with brown holland. The suite itself, however, seemed to have been kept in
  preparation for immediate occupancy. It was almost a shock to her to find how
  everything had been left exactly as she remembered it. There was the little
  dining room with its plain cream-coloured walls and fine oak furniture, the
  study beyond, which she entered with beating heart, where the tapestries hung
  and where there still remained faint evidences of masculine occupation. She
  looked around her, amazed at the poignancy of the memories which swept into
  her mind. The room was extraordinarily reminiscent of its owner. There were
  one or two priceless tapestries, a few delightful bronzes, a couple of water
  colours, a strange "Old Master." There was the chair where she had sat, the
  curtain which Peggy Layton had lifted at her entrance. Idiocy! There was an
  atmosphere still lingering here which, from the first, should have stifled
  all her resentment; an atmosphere almost of austerity, of simple and
  selective elegance in the hangings and appointments of the room, its
  carefully chosen and priceless ornaments.</p>

  <p>"I should like to look into his Grace's bedchamber," Monica remarked. "It
  opens out from here, does it not?"</p>

  <p>Johnson bowed in silence and threw open another door. A little exclamation
  of surprise broke from Monica's lips as she crossed the threshold. There was
  a plain bedstead, a very beautifully carved shrine upon the wall, two
  exquisite masterpieces of the Virgin, one a reputed, the other a genuine
  Perugino, and nothing else, except the wardrobes let into the walls. The
  floor was uncarpeted, the walls plainly distempered. It was the bedchamber of
  an anchorite, except for the strange beauty of the two paintings, the
  beautiful carving of the shrine, before which she noticed with some surprise
  a bowl of fresh flowers. She pointed to them. Johnson coughed, a little
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"His Grace used to arrange these himself, my lady," he explained. "Somehow
  or other, since he has been away, with the idea that he might return at any
  moment, I have taken the liberty."</p>

  <p>Monica stepped back into the study. She sank into the chair in which she
  had sat so short a time ago and fancied that heaven itself was descending to
  her. Almost, again, she could imagine that the atmosphere of the room was
  filled with the thrilling and wonderful music to which she had listened
  during those few minutes for the first time in life.</p>

  <p>"You miss your master, Johnson?" she asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Any one who had been privileged to know his Grace intimately, my lady,"
  the man replied, "would miss him."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with suddenly moistened eyes.</p>

  <p>"There are a great many people in the world, Johnson," she sighed, " who
  speak ill of his Grace."</p>

  <p>"Those are the people who did not know him, my lady," was the confident
  reply.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand.</p>

  <p>"You can go," she said. "I shall be down in a few minutes. I had an hour
  to spare and I had a fancy to look at these tapestries again." Johnson
  lingered upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship cannot tell us," he enquired wistfully, "if there is any
  news of his Grace&mdash;any likelihood of his return?"</p>

  <p>"We have heard nothing," Monica replied. "It seems rather unlikely."</p>

  <p>She was left alone for a time. Her eyes were fixed upon the tapestries
  which were, indeed, very priceless and very wonderful, but she saw nothing of
  them. She saw instead the outline of a dark figure at the desk opposite. She
  heard the scratching of a pen. Once again she felt that strange compelling
  conviction that victory was almost within her grasp. The glory of the world
  had come so near, swept away by a single moment of banality; a moment over
  which she knew in her heart that she should have triumphed. In his absence
  the truth seemed so much easier to comprehend. She realised so completely how
  far he had remained above the weaknesses he had made use of. His enmity, his
  cruelty, his unscrupulousness seemed all of a sudden pitiful; by sheer will
  he had carried them with him to the climax, only to abandon them like
  pestilence when the hour had struck. What she had missed!</p>

  <p>"I beg your ladyship's pardon."</p>

  <p>She looked round, summoned back into the world which for a moment she had
  forgotten. Mr. Moss, untidy, blinking nervously behind his spectacles, was
  standing in an apologetic attitude just inside the door.</p>

  <p>"I beg your ladyship's pardon," he repeated. "I ventured to intrude to ask
  if there was any news of his Grace."</p>

  <p>"None that I know of," was Monica's regretful reply. Mr. Moss's
  disappointment was manifest. She looked at him kindly.</p>

  <p>"You are not under any apprehension, I hope, as to your position, Mr.
  Moss?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no, your ladyship," he assured her. "His Grace has arranged for
  me to remain here during my lifetime, and for a pension when I choose to
  retire. Johnson has been treated in the same way. It is not for ourselves
  that we think; it is that we desire to see his Grace back again."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Monica saw the little man with new eyes. He had become a human
  being.</p>

  <p>"You found my cousin a kind master?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Moss's voice shook.</p>

  <p>"His Grace was the most sympathetic employer and the most wonderful
  scholar with whom I have ever been privileged to converse, my lady," he
  declared. "He was kindness itself. And I would undertake to say," he went on,
  his voice becoming stronger, almost truculent, "that there is not a man in
  London to-day whose knowledge of modern Latin exceeds his Grace's."</p>

  <p>Monica rose abruptly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I wish he were back again, Mr. Moss," she confessed. "I am afraid he was
  not very happy here. I don't think any of us quite understood."</p>

  <p>She made her escape somehow. She had looked upon this visit with some
  self-disdain as a pandering to sentiment, to a weakness of which she was half
  ashamed.</p>

  <p>She came away with a strangely altered outlook. Her glimpse of Francis's
  rooms, their faint atmosphere of austere beauty, the worship of Mr. Moss and
  his servant had shaken her. She turned into the park, anxious for a few
  minutes' solitude. Felicia Dringe passed by, side by side with Mr. Ambrosius
  in a very wonderful Rolls-Royce. They both looked at her tentatively.
  Monica's eyes travelled through them and beyond. There was a sob in her
  throat as she realised how her feet had clung to the earth; how little she
  had understood. The rain was coming down, the chairs were all turned on end,
  the walks were deserted. She stood for a short time under the trees,
  listening to the pattering on the leaves overhead. The people who came and
  vanished into the grey mist were like ghosts.</p>

  <p>Yet her imagination triumphed. She saw the place as it had always seemed
  to her&mdash;the playground of idle moments, the rendezvous for countless
  assignations, the scene of numberless small flirtations, one of the coloured
  pages of the passing day. Then, suddenly, she knew that nothing in the past
  counted at all except this memory; that nothing in the future would ever
  count &mdash;unless She glanced at her watch. Her train left at eleven
  o'clock for Calais. The spirit of adventure thrilled her pulses. There might
  yet be time &mdash;and life, after all, held but one supreme joy!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a id="ch212"
     name="ch212">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONICA never forgot that midnight ride across the plain
from Florence, the
  paling of the moon and the hour of gloom before the dawn, when the lights of
  Pellini seemed mingled with the stars and the whole country shapeless and
  blurred. A curious uneasiness had seized her in Florence, where she had
  purposed to spend the night, and had driven her out on to the final stage of
  her journey&mdash;an uneasiness which grew almost into panic as, with the
  coming of dawn, the country spread itself out before her, the houses and
  trees took to themselves shape, and as they panted round the hairpin corners
  of the hill of Pellini the harsh clanging of the monastery bell broke the
  stillness of the dawn. She had a feeling that after all she would be too
  late; that once more the door in the wall would have opened and closed before
  she reached the ramparts. With the last ascent, however, her fears vanished.
  A man was kneeling, very much in the same position that she had first seen
  Francis. The monastery doors were closed. The organ was silent. The
  procession of the monks had not yet been formed.</p>

  <p>She stopped the car at the last bend and continued her journey on foot. As
  she approached him, the kneeling man rose to his feet. He stared at Monica as
  though she were something unreal, at the car whose engine was still throbbing
  and back again at Monica. She, for her part, was confused. The worshipper was
  a stranger to her&mdash;a peasant, apparently, from his worn clothes and
  scanty linen. He muttered something which she failed to understand. Then she
  remembered the action of the country people who had passed Francis at his
  devotions. She made the sign of the cross, bent her head, and retreated to
  the car. The man returned to his devotions.</p>

  <p>At Pellini she ordered breakfast at the hotel and sent for the landlord.
  In reply to her questions he became at once eloquent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, signorina," he told her, "the <i>Inglese</i> returned here
  but recently. There has been much talk about him. He has been the hero of a
  great romance. News came, signorina, whilst he was in the monastery with
  those others, that he had inherited the estates of an English nobleman. They
  say that he was loath to go, but he went. For many months he
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"But he has returned you say?" Monica asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt, signorina," the man assured her. "Only last week he
  returned. He is at the villa where he lived when a boy with his mother, on
  the road to Ejjecio&mdash;a matter of four kilometres, perhaps. If the
  signorina desires to visit him she will permit that I speak to her chauffeur?
  He shall be directed."</p>

  <p>For the first time Monica's courage failed her for a moment as she drove
  up a little avenue of cypresses at the end of which stood the plain,
  bald-looking villa which had been pointed out to her. The avenue itself was
  in shocking condition; the whole place unkempt and uncared for. The garden,
  visible as soon as they reached the end of the drive, had run absolutely
  wild. The windows were all curtainless; the grounds beyond had a deserted and
  miserable appearance. The only attractive feature about it was a small
  terrace round which a wisteria shrub and a few roses had twined themselves.
  At the further end of this oasis Francis was seated&mdash;or rather had been
  seated&mdash;breakfasting. He came towards her like a man wakened out of a
  dream, unsteady on his feet, large-eyed with wonder, his whole being
  tremulous with the dawn of a beatific amazement.</p>

  <p>"Monica!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Here I am," she replied, stepping from the car. "What a journey! And
  couldn't you borrow a steam roller for your avenue? I'm shaken to bits."</p>

  <p>He still looked at her as though she were something unreal.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come here?" he demanded. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that sound a little inhospitable," she protested, "or is it my
  fancy? I'm on my way to Mentone&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>"But what do you want?" he repeated gravely. "Is there anything I
  forgot?"</p>

  <p>"You forgot me!"</p>

  <p>He ignored her amazing reply and her almost maddening smile. He
  disappeared for a moment through the cracked French glass window and brought
  out a chair. She motioned him to take it to the other end of the terrace
  where he had been breakfasting.</p>

  <p>"I'll sit with you," she said. "What delicious oranges!"</p>

  <p>He continued to question her, although with a curious note of
  impersonality.</p>

  <p>"What did I forget?" he ruminated. "I destroyed all the promissory notes.
  I reinstated the allowances. I left the fullest instructions and authority
  with Sir Stephen. I thought I had finished with everything that could ever
  remind me of those terrible months."</p>

  <p>"You were magnificent!" Monica declared, taking an orange from the dish
  and peeling it absently. "Magnificent in your folly, in your anger, and in
  your reparation, but, as I said before, you forgot me!"</p>

  <p>"Have you come here to torture me?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My dear Cousin Francis, no," she assured him. "I've come to breakfast.
  Could we have another omelet, and I like my coffee a little stronger."</p>

  <p>He seemed about to speak, but changed his mind. Once more he disappeared
  through the window and this time he was absent for several minutes. When he
  returned he found Monica comfortably established, with her hat hanging from
  the rail of the balcony.</p>

  <p>"The old woman who looks after me," he announced, "will do her best.
  Monica, you must tell me why you've come."</p>

  <p>"My dear man," she replied, holding out her hands to him, " isn't it
  perfectly obvious? I've come to stay."</p>

  <p>"To stay?" he repeated. "You&mdash;with me ? here!"</p>

  <p>"That was rather my idea," she admitted. "Don't look so terrified,
  Francis. We can get married or something, can't we&mdash;only, after
  breakfast&mdash;I insist upon it that we have breakfast first. I can smell
  the omelet."</p>

  <p>She felt the grip of his hands upon her shoulders; his eyes were
  questioning her fiercely.</p>

  <p>"This is the second time I've come to you," she reminded him. "You drove
  me away before&mdash;or rather that horrid little cat of a Peggy Layton did.
  You won't drive me away this time, Francis?"</p>

  <p>His arms were closing around her. Belief was coming to him.</p>

  <p>"Because you mustn't ever drive me away, please," she went on. "It's a
  terrible thing to say without being asked, Francis, isn't it&mdash;but I love
  you, dear! I have never loved any one else. I never could love any one else.
  May I stay?"</p>

  <p>"May you stay!" he faltered passionately. "You!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Later in the day, as they passed the monastery on their way to Florence,
  she told him of the penitent she had surprised that morning. He smiled at her
  fears.</p>

  <p>"I never had any idea of going back there," he declared. "What I was going
  to do with myself, I can't imagine&mdash;certainly not that. I expect, when
  it was too late, I should have started round Europe, hat in hand, in search
  of you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would have been better if I had waited," she suggested
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What a horrible idea," he laughed. "Besides," he went on, a moment or two
  later, " if you had waited, I should have missed the most wonderful moment of
  my life."</p>

  <p>"And I, the best omelet," she murmured.</p>

  <p>The monastery bell began to clang as they reached the plain. They both
  looked backwards. Francis shivered. She passed her arm through his.</p>

  <p>"Don't think of it, dear," she begged. "Life is going to be anything but
  an abstraction for you in the future."</p>

  <p>"I know it," he replied. "I've got to go back and live down the memory of
  that horrible predecessor of mine&mdash;that dissipated fellow who won races
  with the wrong horses and took young ladies to the wrong restaurants. I've a
  lot to live down, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"Quite easy," she assured him&mdash;"with me to help!"</p>
