  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">1. CONGRATULATIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The old gentleman with the resplendently starched cuffs
  moved into the room. In the kindly half light of the long, low apartment he
  stood poised like an ancient ramrod, worn and polished from long years of
  campaigning. About his person clung a pleasantly subtle suggestion of good
  soap and even better cigars. An expensive and thoroughly masculine smell.</p>

  <p>With meticulous care he began to remove his gloves, releasing each
  imprisoned finger as if the action were an independent and definitely
  unrelated operation, requiring individual attention.</p>

  <p>It was rather impressive, the way he took off his gloves&mdash;that is, if
  one's nerves and patience were in good working condition. But the woman
  sitting in one corner of the huge divan had never been heavily endowed with
  patience, and at present her nerves were not so good. They were very bad
  nerves indeed.</p>

  <p>"If you don't take those gloves off," she said, "I'll drag them off with
  my own two hands. Your fingers aren't made of china. Why do you wear them,
  anyway? They make me feel like sweating."</p>

  <p>"Give full rein to your animal impulses," suggested the old gentleman in a
  calm, deep voice. "You might lose a few superfluous pounds hither and
  yon."</p>

  <p>Imperturbably he returned his attention to his gloves. He took them off as
  if he were really fond of them. And he was fond of his gloves. Always he had
  been like that, a creature whose nature was so ebullient with affection that
  it was generous enough to include even inanimate objects&mdash;all the good
  things of life. Now, at the age of sixty, he still loved the world, although
  he had learned to regard its creatures with affectionate contempt not
  untinged with that inner loneliness that comes from utter
  disillusionment.</p>

  <p>He had loved a lot, and to no good end, so far as he could see, had this
  old gentleman.</p>

  <p>With a slight pat of approval he placed the gloves on a rangy grand piano
  sprawling in the shadows like one of the less unneighborly monsters of the
  prehistoric past. Then from under his right arm he took a package and placed
  it neatly beside the gloves. This he also patted, but with a somewhat
  ironical gesture. Having attended to these little details with fitting
  solemnity and obviously to his entire satisfaction, he bent two remarkably
  bright and penetrating eyes upon the woman who sat watching him with an
  expression of brooding animosity on her faded but still good-looking face.
  Noiselessly he moved over the heavy carpet, bent with easy gallantry, and
  lifting one of the woman's fleshy hands, kissed it quite impersonally, as if
  it were little better than a fish. Furiously she snatched her hand away. He
  made little effort to retain it&mdash;no more than one would to retain a fish
  unless one were grim about it.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, my antiquated trull," he said with unruffled good-
  nature.</p>

  <p>The antiquated trull&mdash;a gamely preserved woman in the unreconciled
  fifties&mdash;answered with restrained passion.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me a trull, you crumbling ruin," she told him. "What do you
  think a body can do at my age?"</p>

  <p>The old gentleman gave an unnecessarily refined cough of admonition.</p>

  <p>"My inquiry," he explained with exasperating patience "had no anatomical
  significance. Let's skip your body for the moment and totter up to a slightly
  higher level, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could skip my body," complained the woman "These days I can
  scarcely drag the thing about."</p>

  <p>"That's pitiful," replied the old gentleman unemotionally. "It's your
  appetite, my dear. You eat like a wolf. It's surprising. But to get away from
  that for a moment, I might suggest that you're supposed to have also a mind
  not to mention a bit of a soul knocking about within that gnarled exterior of
  yours."</p>

  <p>"All I have are corns," said the woman, gloomily surveying her feet. "Toes
  full of corns. They keep me busy cutting them."</p>

  <p>"You disgust me," replied the old gentleman. "Honestly you do&mdash;
  actually disgust me."</p>

  <p>"Rex Pebble," the woman told him, "don't stand there like an old
  hypocrite. For twenty-five years I've been trying to disgust you without the
  least success. I'm too tired now to try any more."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," Mr. Pebble reminiscently observed. "At times
  you've been fairly disgusting, my dear. I might even say, revolting."</p>

  <p>"But not to you," retorted the woman. "You were born demoralized."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble selected a long cigarette from a box on a low table, then
  lighted the slender tube as if from afar he were watching himself perform the
  act with profound admiration.</p>

  <p>"Birth," he observed through a scarf of smoke, "is a demoralizing
  transition. Much more so than death, which has at least the dignity of
  something definitely accomplished. Birth&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it always
  strikes me as being so tentative and squirmy."</p>

  <p>"You do love to hear yourself talk," said the woman. "Especially when you
  know it annoys me."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Mr. Pebble complacently. "If you don't care to talk, Spray,
  my old decrepit, what do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>"What did I ever want to do?" she demanded. Mr. Pebble started
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"Let's not go into that," he said with some haste. "You appall me. This is
  becoming most difficult. At our time of life we should sublimate sex into an
  anticipation of an air-cooled existence on wings."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" snapped the woman called Spray. "I'd turn in my wings without
  a qualm for one good shot of sex."</p>

  <p>"How debasing," said Mr. Pebble. "Unadmirable in the extreme. You, Spray,
  are about the most unreconciled old voluptuary it has ever been my misfortune
  to encounter."</p>

  <p>"You're just a string of long words," Spray retorted. "And that's all
  there is to you. There's nothing else left. Not," she added regretfully,
  "that it would do me any good if there was."</p>

  <p>"Really," objected Mr. Pebble, "I shouldn't be allowed to listen to this
  sort of thing. It's far too low for me. My natural elasticity of spirit
  becomes rigid in your presence."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five years ago &mdash;" began Spray.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me," said Mr. Pebble. "I called this evening especially to
  offer you my congratulations."</p>

  <p>"For what?" asked Spray in surprise. "For God's sake, don't tell me I'm
  another year older."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Pebble. "It's not as bad as that. Tonight is the twenty-
  fifth anniversary of your first seduction. I'm rather sentimental about such
  things. For a quarter of a century now you have had the honor of being my
  mistress."</p>

  <p>"What's honor without pleasure?" Spray demanded bluntly.</p>

  <p>"That's a very difficult question to answer honestly," Mr. Pebble
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"I'm your mistress in name only," went on Spray, her eyes clouding. "I've
  outlived my usefulness." She paused and smiled maliciously at the man. "How
  do you know," she asked, "I was first seduced by you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied Mr. Pebble. "Knowing you as I do, I think it highly
  improbable. But, if you don't mind, allow me to retain at least one harmless
  illusion. I'm an old man, you know."</p>

  <p>The woman looked up at him thoughtfully. He was tall, slim, and straight,
  and faultlessly groomed. About him there seemed to linger still something of
  the insinuating, care-free, insatiable young devil she had known and loved in
  her way. But his face was lined now; his fine hair was white, and his eyes,
  though keen and alert, gazed down at her from a lonely height as if from
  another world. This much she could understand, for she too was lonely now
  that her fires were spent. Swiftly and regret. fully she traveled back
  through time, and yet a little proudly. This man had loved her and kept her,
  and although she had failed him more than he would ever know&mdash;at least,
  she hoped so&mdash;she was glad to remember he had never done a deliberately
  unkind or dishonest act so far as she was concerned. The years washed about
  her, and memories drifted among them. Perhaps not admirable memories, but
  happy ones. And there were some she refused to admit even to herself, for
  women are made that way. She had been a fair, ripe figure of a girl, and she
  had not wasted much time. This man still meant more to her than any man who
  had ever come into her life, although she still regretted a certain young
  doctor who had been so stupidly decent her charms had left him cold. What a
  fool that young doctor had been. She had liked him the better for it. Her
  face softened as she held up a hand to the man standing above her.</p>

  <p>"You are an old man," she said, her voice taking on a richer quality. "A
  distinguished old devil of a man. Sit down. You make my corns ache."</p>

  <p>"To relieve those corns of yours," said Mr. Pebble, sinking into the divan
  beside her, "I would grovel on the floor. Gladly would I grovel."</p>

  <p>"And gladly would I let you if it would do any good," she told him. "But
  nothing helps corns, really. When you grow old your feet grow tired all over.
  They ache and make you mean."</p>

  <p>"I know," he said sympathetically. "I am not without my twinges and
  disconcerting cracks. There is no sense in crying out against nature, yet I
  fiercely resent my aged body and its lost powers. The mental tranquillity
  that comes with age may have its compensations, but one has to be damnably
  philosophical to attain them. It grows tiresome at times, being
  philosophical."</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette," said Spray.</p>

  <p>He lighted her cigarette, and for a moment the woman leaned back, puffing
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she said at last."About what?" asked Rex Pebble.</p>

  <p>"About my first official seduction," Spray replied.</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I might," she told him, "if you'd just give me a start."</p>

  <p>"It was quite all right," began Mr. Pebble. "As a matter of fact, it was
  hardly a proper seduction at all."</p>

  <p>"Are any seductions proper?" she wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Mr. Pebble, "but some are highly salutary&mdash;greatly to
  be desired, you know. What I mean to say is that both of us knew exactly what
  we were doing."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I didn't think I was flying a kite," Spray observed innocently.
  "First impressions are so important in such affairs."</p>

  <p>"As I remember it," went on Mr. Pebble, "you seemed to be quite favorably
  impressed. I hope you don't think I'm bragging."</p>

  <p>"A sensible pride in achievement is perfectly permissible," said the
  woman. "Especially at your age. It's all you have left to brag about."</p>

  <p>"You depress me," said Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Go on with that seduction," Spray reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Then don't interrupt," Mr. Pebble objected. "And stop making me feel my
  years. It was a glorious night, as I recall it. Such a night as this. There
  was something a little mad about it&mdash;something that made important
  things, such as honor and loyalty, seem quite remote and futile. I had been
  married to Sue about three months at the time."</p>

  <p>"That's a long time for a man to remain faithful," observed the woman.</p>

  <p>"Sue never gave me a chance to get started," replied Mr. Pebble without
  rancor. "The little devil was up to her tricks six weeks after we were
  married. As a matter of fact, I don't know to this day whether I'm the father
  of my daughter or not. Neither does Sue. It doesn't really matter. She's a
  decent sort, anyway, and, thank God, she doesn't take after either of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Then her father must have been a nice man," said Spray. "He couldn't have
  been you."</p>

  <p>"I've about come to that conclusion myself," Mr. Pebble admitted
  judicially. "He must have been much too good for Sue. Probably didn't even
  know she was married. I like to think so, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"You haven't much of an opinion of either of us, I suppose?" Spray
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not much," agreed Mr. Pebble, "but that doesn't keep me from liking you
  both&mdash;I might even go so far as to say, loving you both."</p>

  <p>"Even knowing we've both been unfaithful?" Spray asked softly.</p>

  <p>For a moment Rex Pebble stared unseeingly into space, then passed a hand
  across his eyes as if to brush away an unpleasant vision.</p>

  <p>"Even knowing that," he replied. "It isn't sinning that counts so much as
  the concealment of the sin. You, Spray, and Sue, have been fairly honest with
  me in so far as your natures would permit. As for me, I have scarcely had the
  time or inclination to be unfaithful, what with two healthy women at my
  disposal. You know, the flesh is the frailest of our possessions, and yet we
  expect it to be the strongest. I'm inclined to believe that too much idealism
  leads to the cruelest sort of bigotry. Where was I?"</p>

  <p>"I was in a fair way of being seduced," said Spray, "and you seemed to
  think it was a nice night for it."</p>

  <p>"It was," said Mr. Pebble. "Couldn't have been better. You were singing at
  some Egyptian-looking cafe then, and showing as much as the law allowed. Very
  good stuff it was, too&mdash;song and all. I admired your voice as well as
  your body."</p>

  <p>"How about my brains?" asked Spray.</p>

  <p>"There was very little about your brains," said Mr.Pebble. "You didn't
  need any. But to continue. I was exceedingly low in my mind that evening and
  was finding it difficult to get drunk. So I gave up the attempt and solaced
  myself in you instead, which was much wiser."</p>

  <p>"I remember now," said Spray. "You drove me to your home and introduced me
  to Sue, then you borrowed some of her things for me, and we went for a cruise
  on Long Island Sound. She was very sweet about it."</p>

  <p>"There was a reason for that," observed Mr. Pebble with a faint grin. "She
  had a boy friend almost suffocating in the cellar. I nearly packed his
  trousers by mistake."</p>

  <p>"Edifying, we were," said Spray, "the three of us, weren't we?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," admitted Mr. Pebble, "but at least we had both the good
  taste and the good sense not to waste the evening in noisy melodrama. Sue
  told me later she had spent a very pleasant week-end. She was pointed about
  it. You may never have realized it, Spray, but it was you who kept my
  marriage with Sue from going on the rocks. You actually held us together. It
  was only after I had provided you with a home that she felt inclined to
  provide me with one."</p>

  <p>"Glad to have been of help," said Spray. "And so I was seduced."</p>

  <p>"And so you were seduced," agreed Mr. Pebble. "You were even good enough
  to return my wife's nightgown."</p>

  <p>"It was a lovely, daring bit of stuff," Spray observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Pebble almost sadly. "She would never wear it for me."</p>

  <p>"So you got another girl to wear it for you," said Spray.</p>

  <p>"It seemed the most reasonable thing to do," said Mr. Pebble. He paused
  and took a small square box from his pocket. "And," he added, presenting the
  box to the woman, "if you don't mind, I am going to ask you to wear this,
  also."</p>

  <p>Spray opened the box and gazed down into the flickering fires of a black
  opal. The glowing beauty of the jewel was transmuted to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"When the sun went down behind the green islands in the Sound the sky
  looked a lot like that," she said. "Cool fire and disturbing beauty&mdash;
  beauty that almost hurts. Thanks, Rex, I'll wear it." She took his hand in
  both of hers and held it against her cheek. "But I'd much rather be able to
  wear that nightgown for you again," she added.</p>

  <p>"Still harping on the same old subject," said Mr. Pebble, fastidiously
  brushing some powder from the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"It's been more than a subject to me," she retorted. "It's been a
  career."</p>

  <p>"How awful," observed Mr. Pebble, rising and walking over to the piano.
  "Why don't you call it a hobby?" "Hobby, hell!" declared Spray. "It's been a
  craze." Mr. Pebble looked pained.</p>

  <p>"Let's try to forget everything you've said," he suggested, "and start
  afresh. It would be more fragrant. Here's a present Sue sent you."</p>

  <p>He took the package from the piano and carried it to the divan. Spray
  opened the package and read aloud the card enclosed.</p>

  <p><i>"To Spray Summers,"</i> she read, <i>"my husband's mistress, from Sue
  Pebble, your patron's wife. Congratulations!"</i></p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble took the card and looked at it, a faint smile edging his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Right to the point," he remarked. "No unnecessary words. Rather sporting,
  I'd say."</p>

  <p>A cry of animal ferocity broke in upon his observations. Spray was
  confronting him with a large pair of carpet slippers in her hands. Mr. Pebble
  needed only one glance to feel convinced that they were the worst-looking
  pair of slippers he had ever seen. His wife must have searched with fanatical
  zeal to find a gift so devastatingly humiliating. He admired her for her
  perseverance but lamented her shocking taste. He lamented it all the more
  when he received the slippers with sudden violence in the pit of his stomach.
  For a moment Mr. Pebble was forced to abandon his impressive poise. The sheer
  fury behind Spray's arm did much to make up for the softness of the slippers.
  With a dull, businesslike thud they struck the stomach of Mr. Pebble, and
  with a look of utter astonishment he promptly doubled up, his hand pressed to
  the assaulted spot. However, this undignified posture was of short duration.
  Summoning to his aid the traditional pride and courage of a long line of
  Pebbles, he immediately snapped erect and stood regarding the raging woman
  with a calm and imperious eye.</p>

  <p>"I would rather receive an honest kick in the seat of my trousers," he
  said with stoical self-control, "than have one treacherously hurled at me
  from afar."</p>

  <p>"Well, you just show me the seat of your pants," said Spray, "and you'll
  get a kick there, too."</p>

  <p>"Madam," replied Mr. Pebble, "why should I show you the seat of my
  trousers? That would be literally asking for it. In your present mood it
  would be more than a foolhardy gesture of defiance, not to say a grotesque
  one. It would be actually dangerous, even if your feet are the Bull Run of
  chiropody."</p>

  <p>This remark did nothing to restore tranquillity to the heaving bosom of
  Spray Summers. If anything, it heaved all the more. She snatched up the
  slippers and prepared for a second assault.</p>

  <p>"If you throw those slippers at me again," Mr. Pebble told her in level
  tones, "I'll be forced to step on your corns&mdash;all of them."</p>

  <p>Spray's right arm halted in its swing. The threat had proved effective.
  The very thought of such retaliation sent twinges of pain through her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"You deliberately helped your wife to insult she said. "I'll never forgive
  you for this. Look at them. Look at those slippers."</p>

  <p>With a tragic gesture she thrust out the slippers for his inspection.
  Unflinchingly he looked at the horrid things, but was unsuccessful in
  repressing a smile. Although they shocked his esthetic sense, they immensely
  appealed to his sense of humor.</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous," he said. "I knew nothing about those slippers.
  What's wrong with them, anyway? For a woman with feet like yours I should
  think they would be ideal."</p>

  <p>Spray choked over this one.</p>

  <p>"I'm humiliated," she said bitterly. "Humiliated. Do you know what I'm
  going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I never know," declared Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to buy a Mother Hubbard&mdash;a horrid flannel one&mdash; and
  sent it to that wife of yours on her next birthday. And you are going to take
  it to her for me. Don't forget that."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I won't," replied Mr. Pebble a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Wonder who she thinks she is!" went on his mistress. "I'm every day as
  young as she is, if not younger. I am younger. I know it. Five or ten years
  younger."</p>

  <p>Realizing the impossibility of trying to reason with a woman who made such
  extravagant statements, Mr. Pebble, in spite of years of experience, did the
  worst thing he could have done. He agreed with her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you must be right," he said placatingly. "I should say nearer
  ten."</p>

  <p>"To hell with you," blazed Spray. "You chattering old monkey. To hell with
  you, I say. What are you trying to do, treat me like a child?"</p>

  <p>"If you keep on lopping the years off your age," Mr. Pebble assured her,
  "you'll soon be a babe in arms." "I wish I were," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"In whose arms?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Not in those brittle pipe stems of yours," she answered. "I want to be in
  my mother's arms."</p>

  <p>"Funny thing," casually observed Mr. Pebble, "but I can never picture you
  as ever having had a mother."</p>

  <p>"I never had one," said Spray.</p>

  <p>"Then why do you want to be in her arms?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you got to be in somebody's arms when you're a mere babe, don't
  you?" she demanded. "Any fool would know that, even an old one."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," replied Mr. Pebble. "You could be in a basket or a
  cradle or a shoe box or even an ash can, for that matter."</p>

  <p>"Could I?" sneered Spray. "Well, I wasn't that sort of baby. I was always
  in my mother's arms."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you said just now you did not have any mother," objected
  Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Will you stop trying to pin me down?" Spray cried fiercely. "I simply
  meant that we did not carry on long conversations."</p>

  <p>"About what?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>She started to answer, then stopped with an expression of frustration.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" she said at last. "If we never had any long
  conversations, how do you expect me to tell you what we didn't talk
  about?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," Mr. Pebble replied rather hopelessly. "I don't even know what
  we are talking about."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said Spray. "You've got me completely baffled. Why don't
  you go home?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to give me anything to eat?" Mr. Pebble demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where Nokashima is. Haven't seen him for days."</p>

  <p>"Is that wretched heathen drunk again?"</p>

  <p>"He's always either drunk or telephoning," Spray complained. "Often he's
  both drunk and telephoning. Then he's just too bad. Also, he suffers from
  hallucinations. Why don't you take him home to live with you? Whenever I
  discharge him he simply eats a box of rice and goes to bed. Then he covers
  his head with the blankets and gibbers back at me in a weird, muffled voice.
  It's worse than talking to a ghost."</p>

  <p>"I should say so," said Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>At this moment a strange couple entered the room. It consisted of a
  bloodhound who could not smell and a Japanese houseboy who could scarcely
  walk.</p>

  <p>The bloodhound's name was Mr. Henry, and no one knew why.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, madam," said the more loquacious of these two animals in a
  slightly blurred voice. "I was shot in leg by baroness while crossing
  Fourteenth Street."</p>

  <p>"That explains everything," exclaimed Spray Summers with a hopeless waving
  of arms. "What did I tell you? Hallucinations! I might be able to stand a
  crazy Jap or a drunken Jap, but certainly not the two rolled into one. You
  talk to him, Rex Pebble&mdash;that is, if you want any dinner."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry lowered himself thoughtfully to the carpet. Once seated he
  pretended he was smelling something by making his nose quiver. The dog was
  living a lie. Yet it was a harmless form of deception, for a bloodhound who
  had lost his sense of smell must do something to overcome his inferiority
  complex.</p>

  <p>Deprived of the support of his companion, Nokashima clung to the back of a
  chair and stood looking with guilty eyes at the tall, menacing figure of Mr.
  Pebble.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">2. NOKASHIMA AND THE BLOODHOUND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rex Pebble had lived far too long and had been told far too
  many lies to take anyone at his or her own word. The most obvious statement
  was suspect to him. On the other hand, he had lived quite long enough to know
  that almost anything was possible, especially when it happened on Fourteenth
  Street.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he did not immediately call Nokashima a liar and a drunkard,
  although he knew the servant was congenitally both. It was just barely
  possible that some passing baroness had encountered the dissolute Jap on
  Fourteenth Street and taken a pot shot at him. Knowing the little man as he
  did, it struck Mr. Pebble as the most reasonable thing for a baroness to do
  to Nokashima. Probably the woman had once employed him and become, as a
  consequence, slightly deranged. Mr. Pebble could well understand that.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he greeted Mr. Henry, the non-smelling bloodhound, with a
  casual nod, then bore down on the wavering Nokashima, whose expression of
  quiet was immediately replaced by one of protective stupidity.</p>

  <p>"Nocka," said Mr. Pebble with friendly incredulity, "do you mean to stand
  there swaying before me and to tell me to my face that you've actually been
  shot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, boss," replied Nocka with stolid conviction. "I been shot all right.
  Through and through. Also," he added, so that there might be no
  misunderstanding, "up and down."</p>

  <p>"Literally riddled," murmured Mr. Pebble. "Sure you're not just half shot,
  Nokashima?"</p>

  <p>"That too," agreed the Jap, visibly brightening. "Half shot&mdash;all
  shot. Leg of the worst. There are holes in it."</p>

  <p>"But why a baroness, Nocka?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Titled ladies like me," Nocka explained.</p>

  <p>"So they shoot you out of sheer affection," said Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"That's right, boss," replied Nocka. "They shoot me up.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather they shot you down," observed Mr. Pebble, "and out. However,
  one can't have everything. Any blood?"</p>

  <p>"No, boss," said Nocka. "Just holes. Blood all gone." "Do you mean to tell
  me you're bloodless, Nocka?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," vouchsafed the servant. "I am without blood."</p>

  <p>"How do you keep on living?" asked Mr. Pebble, interested in the Jap's
  mental processes.</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Nocka simply. "I am dying. Soon I will be good and
  dead."</p>

  <p>"You may be dead," remarked Mr. Pebble, "but I very much doubt if you'll
  be much good."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll be all right, boss," said Nocka encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you take that view of it," observed Mr. Pebble. "Of course,
  after you're dead we can't keep you on here. What do you want us to do with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Put me in jug," said Nocka, "and send me home as token."</p>

  <p>"What sort of jug, Nocka?" Mr. Pebble wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"An ash jug," declared the Jap. "I want to be burned all up."</p>

  <p>"Nothing would give me more joy," put in Spray Summers. "If I had my way
  I'd set fire to you right now."</p>

  <p>"Only after I am all dead," said Nokashima firmly. "I burn then."</p>

  <p>"You'll burn in hell," Spray assured him, "you black-hearted heathen."</p>

  <p>"Don't scold at me, madam," Nocka said quite seriously, "or I'll become
  nervous breakdown."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried Spray bitterly. "I like that. You'll become a nervous
  breakdown. Why, you've made me a gibbering idiot. Go on and die, sottish
  little ape."</p>

  <p>"Soon," said the sottish little ape. "But no words, madam."</p>

  <p>"No," retorted Spray. "Just cheers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble decided that this sort of thing would arrive at no good
  end.</p>

  <p>"Nocka," he said, shifting his attack, "how old are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am of no years," replied the Jap surprisingly. "I am all things to all
  men."</p>

  <p>"You're a pain in the neck to me," cut in Spray Summers. "And elsewhere,"
  she added with characteristic abandon.</p>

  <p>"Show me those holes in your leg," Mr. Pebble demanded rather hastily.</p>

  <p>"What holes, boss?" asked the servant.</p>

  <p>"What holes?" Mr. Pebble repeated. "Didn't you tell me a baroness shot
  your leg full of holes?"</p>

  <p>"You thought I did," said Nokashima, now in his most baffling stride.</p>

  <p>A groan of mental anguish escaped Spray Summers' lips.</p>

  <p>"He can throw you every time," she told Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"The horrid little beetle plays jujitsu with the English language."</p>

  <p>"Are there no holes at all in your leg?" Mr. Pebble asked a trifle
  wearily.</p>

  <p>"In which leg?" was the cautious answer.</p>

  <p>"In any leg," replied Mr. Pebble, who was rapidly losing control.</p>

  <p>"In some legs, yes," declared Nocka.</p>

  <p>"But not in yours?" insisted Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"All gone," replied the Jap. "I am weak from the loss of holes."</p>

  <p>By this time Spray was laughing comfortably on the divan.</p>

  <p>"My god," she said, "how you two can talk. I don't know which is the most
  unintelligent. The heathen is weak from the loss of holes, is he? Well, I've
  got a gun upstairs. Shall I get it and make him strong with holes?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to make him nonexistent with holes," grated Mr. Pebble. "I'd
  like to make him just one hole in space."</p>

  <p>"Like baroness," suggested Nokashima. "Cocktail, boss?"</p>

  <p>The servant's question was timed to the exact second. Mr. Pebble checked
  his mounting wrath and struggled back once more to his poise.</p>

  <p>"By all means," he said. "That is the best way out of everything. Are you
  able also to cook dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Shake first, then cook," replied the Jap. "We must all be hungry."</p>

  <p>"Go on and shake your head off," Spray flung after him as Nokashima left
  the room, Mr. Henry acting in the double capacity of guide and support.</p>

  <p>When Nocka returned with the frosted shaker all sense of guilt appeared to
  have departed from his soul. His eyes had lost their expression of protective
  stupidity. They were now alert and gleaming. He even walked with Mr. Henry as
  an equal.</p>

  <p>"He must have made a good one," Spray observed. "How are the cocktails,
  Nocka?"</p>

  <p>"I am all recovered, madam," replied the Japanese. "I have no years at
  all."</p>

  <p>"I feel somewhat younger myself," remarked Mr. Pebble after he had emptied
  his glass. "That was an honest cocktail mixed by dishonest hands, which goes
  to show that through evil great good can accrue. How are your wounds,
  Nocka?"</p>

  <p>"I have no holes either," the small man replied proudly.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't brag about that," commented Spray Summers.</p>

  <p>"I suggest we avoid the subject," interposed Mr. Pebble. "These cocktails
  are actually buoyant, Spray. Have another."</p>

  <p>Spray did. Then she offered the slippers to the non-smelling bloodhound.
  Realizing what was expected of him, Mr. Henry came over to the divan and went
  through the elaborate pretense of sniffing them.</p>

  <p>"Too bad he can't smell," Spray observed sadly. "If he could, the scent of
  these slippers would so infuriate him he'd tear the things to pieces."</p>

  <p>"I wonder why that dog can't smell?" Mr. Pebble wondered without much
  interest.</p>

  <p>"He does smell at times," replied Spray, "but never with his nose. I think
  his mother dallied with a Pekingese."</p>

  <p>'"You can cram more unsavory suggestions in the smallest space," protested
  Mr. Pebble, "of any woman I know."</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry," put in Nokashima, "him must have smell something very
  shocking when small babe of pup. It stultify his nose."</p>

  <p>"Nothing should be too shocking for a bloodhound to smell," remarked Spray
  Summers. "That's their sole purpose in life&mdash;to take it on the nose, so
  to speak."</p>

  <p>"Not when babe of pup," said Nocka. "When smell is too awful young nose
  declines to play part. It withers like delicate flower beneath blast of
  sun."</p>

  <p>"That's the way I like to have things put," declared Mr. Pebble, pouring
  himself another drink. "Fine poetic frenzy evoked by a dog's nose."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've lived with that dog and that Jap for five long years," said
  Spray, "and I defy William Shakespeare to do as much and retain one whiff of
  poetry in his soul."</p>

  <p>She too poured herself another cocktail, and looked defiantly about her.
  Mr. Henry, as if sensing his defective part was under discussion, put an end
  to a trying situation by taking the slippers in his mouth and stalking from
  the room. With a quick bow Nokashima followed the dog.</p>

  <p>"Exit three unsightly objects," said Spray with satisfaction, "but of the
  three those slippers are the worst."</p>

  <p>"Sue can think up some dirty tricks," observed Mr. Pebble. "She has a
  perverted sense of humor."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind an occasional dirty trick," replied Spray. "I've pulled a
  few myself in my time, but those slippers were wicked. It's the first time in
  twenty-five years she has ever got the better of me."</p>

  <p>"Wish I could say the same," responded Mr. Pebble. "She's got the better
  of me more than once&mdash;both of you have."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," said Spray. "You haven't been so desperately treated,
  considering the chances you took. You've had more than most men&mdash;two
  lovely homes with a lovely woman in each. In addition, you've had the
  privilege of bringing up another man's daughter and of making a home for your
  nephew. What more could you ask?"</p>

  <p>"I've had more than enough," was Mr. Pebble's enigmatic rejoinder. "Lots
  more."</p>

  <p>"How is Kippie, by the way?" Spray wanted to know. "Haven't seen him for
  some time."</p>

  <p>"He's growing more divertingly worthless every day," said Mr. Pebble.
  "He's twenty-six now, and in the three years since he left college he hasn't
  earned an honest dime. As a matter of fact, he's virtually ruined that
  advertising agency of mine."</p>

  <p>"If he ruins only advertising agencies," remarked Spray, "no great harm
  will be done. Does he stop there?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," said Mr. Pebble. "The other morning I took one of the cars
  out for an early spin and found myself sitting on a pair of so-called step-
  ins." He paused and sighed a little wistfully. "Women's undergarments have
  taken vast strides since our day. There's nothing to them at all now except
  speed. They're very nice."</p>

  <p>"I wear all the latest things," said Spray Summers. "For all the good it
  does me."</p>

  <p>"Or me," added Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>He rose and, taking up the shaker, went in search of Nokashima. In the
  kitchen he discovered the Japanese engaged in an odd ceremony. With the
  slippers in one hand and a large steak in the other he was endeavoring to
  instruct Mr. Henry in the fine art of smelling. From the tense attitude of
  the bloodhound's rump Mr. Pebble could see that the dog was taking the
  situation seriously.</p>

  <p>"Sniff hard, Mist' Henry," Nokashima was saying. "Which smell more better,
  steak or slips? Take good sniff now." Here the little man first passed the
  steak across the dog's nose and then did the same with the slippers. "Which
  you like," he demanded, "nice steak or delightful slips?" Apparently Mr.
  Henry had little preference, or perhaps both steak and slippers were equally
  revolting to him. With a puzzled expression in his limpid eyes he looked
  adoringly up at the Jap. "Ha!" cried Nokashima, refusing to be discouraged.
  "Hard to make up mind, eh? Both so good. Take deep whiff now, then wag for
  favorite."</p>

  <p>Once more the steak and slippers were offered to the dog's nose. The sight
  was too much for Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," he exclaimed. "I wouldn't do that. Don't let him smell the
  steak."</p>

  <p>Nokashima glanced up with innocent concentration. "Mist' Henry," he said
  somewhat sadly, "him can't smell steak, I don't fancy."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't fancy him getting his great nose all over it," Mr. Pebble
  protested.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry's nose is all right outside," explained the Jap. "Inside not
  so good."</p>

  <p>"Nokashima," said Mr. Pebble severely, "I'm not out here to argue with you
  about the relative merits of the inside and outside of Mr. Henry's nose. No
  side of that hound's nose belongs on a steak. I don't even care to discuss
  it. It's not fitting for animals to smell people's food."</p>

  <p>"He can't smell anybody's food," replied Nocka with increasing sadness.
  "Not even his own food."</p>

  <p>"Whether or not that dog can smell his own food is a matter of
  indifference to me," said Mr. Pebble. "That's his hard luck, but I'll be
  damned if I'm going to allow him even to try to smell mine."</p>

  <p>"I let him smell my food," said Nokashima gently.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if he eats your food," replied Mr. Pebble. "You keep that
  dog's nose in one place and that steak in another."</p>

  <p>"Where's good place for dog's nose?" the little man wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Mr. Pebble, a little mystified.</p>

  <p>"Where I keep Mist' Henry's nose?" replied the Japanese.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why either of us should be concerned where Mr. Henry keeps
  his nose," declared Mr. Pebble, "so long as he keeps it entirely to himself.
  Furthermore, I'm getting fed up with Mr. Henry's nose."</p>

  <p>"You feed on dog's nose, boss?" asked Nokashima, with an expression of
  horror on his wrinkled face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" exclaimed Mr. Pebble. "Don't be a fool, Nokashima. I never ate
  a dog's nose in my life."</p>

  <p>"That's nice," said Nocka approvingly. "That's very good. Tough on dog to
  feed on nose. I take care of Mist' Henry's nose if you not eat."</p>

  <p>"I don't have to promise you not to eat that blood-hound's nose," retorted
  Mr. Pebble. "More for my sake than his, I wouldn't touch his nose. I have a
  nose of my own."</p>

  <p>"And you eat that?" asked Nokashima, now thoroughly interested.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," snapped Mr. Pebble. "Are you deliberately trying to
  infuriate me?"</p>

  <p>"That's nice," said the Jap. "That's very good."</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me it's nice that I don't eat my own nose?" demanded Mr.
  Pebble, his consumption of cocktails having made him a little childish.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so?" asked the guileless servant.</p>

  <p>"I don't even have to think about it," replied Mr. Pebble. "How can a man
  eat his own nose?"</p>

  <p>"With his teeth," said Nokashima quite reasonably, and Mr. Pebble was
  undone.</p>

  <p>He began to tremble so violently that the few remaining ice cubes in the
  shaker tinkled pleasantly against its sides. The sound automatically
  attracted Nokashima's attention.</p>

  <p>"More cocktails, boss?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Once more the servant's question had been happily timed.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, yes," gasped Mr. Pebble. "Don't say anything more to me.
  Just make the cocktails, then bring them in. That's all. Just make them and
  bring them in. No more talk about my nose, or that dog's nose, or of any nose
  in all the world. Understand that. Just make them and bring them in. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>Still mumbling to himself about what Nokashima should and should not do,
  Mr. Pebble tottered from the room and sank wearily down on the divan beside
  his mistress.</p>

  <p>"What kept you?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Mr. Pebble, "that Nokashima was put on this earth just to
  torture my soul. He has noses on the brain."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" asked Spray. "How on earth can a person have a nose on
  the brain, even such an original type as Nokashima?"</p>

  <p>"Are you starting in, too ?" demanded Mr. Pebble. "Or is it a plot to
  drive me mad?"</p>

  <p>Before Spray could answer, the small man entered triumphantly. He was
  carrying a fresh shaker of cocktails.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry knows difference now," he announced, happily. "He can smell
  like regular dog."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" asked Mr. Pebble, intrigued in spite of his
  determination never again to discuss any subject with this mad Oriental.</p>

  <p>"I taught him," said Nocka proudly.</p>

  <p>"Still I don't understand," pursued Mr. Pebble. "He ate steak all up,"
  said Nokashima.</p>

  <p>Both Spray and Mr. Pebble gazed in blank astonishment at the Japanese
  servant. This was indeed a stunning piece of information.</p>

  <p>"What?" said Mr. Pebble after a dazed silence. "He ate steak all up?"</p>

  <p>"Every bit," replied Nocka in a pleased voice. "All. But not these."</p>

  <p>He set the shaker on the table and produced the slippers from his pocket.
  These he extended to Spray. With a choking sound, she covered her face with
  her hands.</p>

  <p>"Take them away," she moaned.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble was too stunned to speak. His poise was shot full of holes.
  With fascinated eyes he watched the Japanese pour two cocktails. What manner
  of man could this be? Mr. Pebble wondered vaguely. Why did God permit the
  little man to live? Perhaps there was no God. Perhaps life was just one long
  dirty trick.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry knows difference now all right," continued Nokashima
  cheerfully. "He crunch into steak with great enjoyment, but not slips.
  They're not so good."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">3. BAGGAGE CHECKS OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Neither Mr. Pebble nor his mistress felt in the least
  inclined to discuss any subject with Nokashima. Time passed in brooding
  silence which Rex Pebble devoted to the restoration of his cherished poise
  through the consumption of numerous cocktails. Feeling considerably
  fortified, he rose at last, and placed a friendly arm round the happy little
  servant's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"How can you bring yourself to touch the vile body of that misbegotten
  little monstrosity?" Spray Summers demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh well," said Mr. Pebble, none too definitely, then added, for lack of
  anything more adequate to say, another "Oh well."</p>

  <p>"Our dinner has gone to the dog," Spray continued bitterly, "and you more
  than shake the hand of the telephoning drunkard who fed it to him. You
  actually caress the withered marmoset."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mr. Pebble with alcoholic tolerance, "but you still have
  your slippers, and you must admit the marmoset can shake a two-fisted
  cocktail."</p>

  <p>"Get out of my sight, you soiled camels!" the irascible woman exclaimed,
  "and take these damn slippers with you. Mr. Henry might like them for a
  little goûter, the dirty dog."</p>

  <p>This time it was the rear of Mr. Pebble that received the slippers instead
  of the stomach. He accepted them there with unflinching heroism, thanking his
  lucky stars he had been fortunate enough to escape a frontal attack.</p>

  <p>"You should join a major league," he tossed back over his shoulder.
  "Remarkable control."</p>

  <p>Gently but firmly he propelled Nokashima from the room.</p>

  <p>"Madam no like Mist' Henry to eat steak all up?" the small Jap inquired
  when safely out of earshot.</p>

  <p>"Not all up, Nocka," Mr. Pebble explained. "She's funny that way. Madam
  likes it better to eat her own steak. I'll telephone for another one."</p>

  <p>"Let me telephone, boss," said Nokashima quickly. "I get a steak of most
  rarefied succulence plenty quick."</p>

  <p>Remembering the servant's passion for the telephone, Mr. Pebble interposed
  no objection, feeling that as long as the Japanese was having such a
  thoroughly good time he might as well make a night of it. Accordingly, he
  abandoned Nokashima to the telephone, then quit the kitchen and the house by
  a side door. It would be just as well, he reflected, to let Spray simmer for
  a while.</p>

  <p>Blending the fragrance of moist herbage with the scent of cocktails, Rex
  Pebble bore his sixty years along an uneven brick wall that led to a walled
  garden at the back of the house. And the moment he entered this quiet place
  the summer twilight claimed him. It was a spacious garden with fine turf
  pierced by the trunks of trees, and it sloped gently to the brow of a hill
  which lay without the walls, thus giving the spot a fair, broad view of the
  valley below and the villages nestling in it. A long green pool, now glowing
  in the sunset, dreamed tranquilly within the garden and all day long
  reflected the changing moods of the sky. In the middle of the pool the statue
  of a naiad stood lightly poised on the surface of the water. A border of
  flagstones circled the pool, converging at the steps of a little white
  pavilion which stood partly hidden among the trees. This small but
  luxuriously appointed structure had been built essentially for privacy, which
  was just as well, for it had been the scene of full many a revel in those
  days when sixty years were an inconceivable distance off to Rex Pebble. He
  gazed at the pavilion now, then certain memories forced him politely to avert
  his eyes. They rested on the statue of the naiad, and Mr. Pebble seated
  himself on a bench beside the pool the better to contemplate this wild nude
  figure.</p>

  <p>For many years Rex Pebble had been contemplating this naiad, and for many
  years the naiad had been contemplating him with the same provocative smile on
  her half-parted lips. He had given her the name of Baggage because he was
  fully convinced she was both saucy and promiscuous. And he liked her the
  better for it, although in his heart he chided her gently for her folly.</p>

  <p>Baggage was a lush figure of a wench, the creation of vanished hands that
  either had known women too well or else had been deprived of them entirely.
  Certainly the stone had been caressed with desire and fashioned with a hungry
  ruthlessness that had left it a brazen challenge to the eyes of man. Yet
  there was something refreshingly honest and direct in Baggage's lack of
  modesty. Her seeming depravity sprang not so much from weakness or
  viciousness as from an ordered philosophy of existence&mdash;a desire to
  share with others the good things of life of which she herself was one of the
  best. If endowed with life Baggage would never be one of those women who
  tearfully proclaim, "I didn't mean to do it." Not Baggage. She would say
  instead, "Sure I did it, and if you don't watch out I'll go and do it again."
  Also, one would always know where to find Baggage. One would only have to
  look for the nearest man, and if there were two men, no doubt the other one
  would be waiting for her as patiently as possible.</p>

  <p>These unedifying reflections upon the probable character of Baggage passed
  through Mr. Pebble's mind as his eyes dwelt on the lithe, lovely lines of the
  full-blown figure.</p>

  <p>He had found Baggage in a storage warehouse. She had been sold in default
  of payment for her keep. Yet even the dusty mantle gathered from her long
  incarceration had failed to rob her body of its wild pagan grace. Mr. Pebble
  had an eye that automatically discounted the outer draperies of women in
  favor of what lay beneath. He had bought her on the spot.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like a sheet about her?" the man had asked when Baggage had
  been deposited in the back of the open motor.</p>

  <p>"I might," Mr. Pebble had told the man. In fact, I'm sure I would, but I
  doubt if the lady would like it."</p>

  <p>Leaving the man a little shocked, Mr. Pebble had driven off with Baggage.
  Later he had presented her to his mistress. Since then she had become a part
  of the establishment, like Nokashima and the bloodhound, Mr. Henry.</p>

  <p>With a slight start Mr. Pebble raised his snow-white head, then shrugged
  his shoulders as if remonstrating with himself. Had those cocktails made him
  drowsy, and had his thoughts gone straying into the realms of pure fancy?
  Surely he had imagined he had seen the tawny, voluptuous form of Baggage step
  down from her little pedestal and come gliding towards him across the path of
  the slanting sun now flickering on the still waters of the pool. Surely he
  had imagined this, and yet&mdash;Mr. Pebble half rose from the bench and
  looked at the spot where the statue had been but where it was no more.</p>

  <p>"My god!" he muttered. "Did the poor girl fall in? This is indeed a night
  of catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, old man," said a low voice beside him. "I didn't fall in the
  pool. I have come to pay you a long deferred visit."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble resumed his seat. Quite calmly he accepted the situation.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Baggage," he said. "I'm afraid you've come too late. I'm an old
  man now, as you have just reminded me."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the beautiful figure beside him, then savored as if on the
  tip of his tongue the full bitterness of his years. There was something so
  imperatively urgent in the sleek young body of the girl sitting so close to
  him on the bench, Mr. Pebble felt that a just God should do a little
  something about it. Either the cocktails or the animal magnetism of his
  companion was making him a bit dizzy. His old, tired heart was thumping
  dangerously against his vest. What was it the doctor had told him about that
  heart&mdash;no excitement? That was it, no excitement. How absurd. If the
  doctor himself were here he would be fit to be tied. In fact, he would have
  to be tied if only for the sake of propriety. The low voice was speaking
  again. "You were too busy when you were young to pay any attention to me,"
  said Baggage. "What were you always doing in that little pavilion down
  there?"</p>

  <p>"You know all the answers," Mr. Pebble told her. "Hadn't you better let me
  get you some clothes?"</p>

  <p>"And you know me better than that," said the girl, with a mocking laugh.
  "I never wore a stitch of clothes in my life. Why should I begin now?"</p>

  <p>"Well, times are not what they were, my child," Mr. Pebble answered
  feebly. "Women wear clothes nowadays&mdash;not much of them, I'll admit, but
  still they wear a few."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were young again," said the girl, fixing Mr. Pebble with a
  pair of wickedly disturbing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how I do," muttered Mr. Pebble. "Don't look at me like that. It won't
  do you a bit of good, and it's upsetting me terribly. After all, I did you a
  good turn once. What's the idea now? Why are you trying to torment me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm jealous," replied Baggage, "jealous of the youth you've lost. I want
  you back again."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Baggage," Rex Pebble said earnestly. "Nobody wants to get back
  more passionately than I do, but you can see for yourself, my child, it just
  can't be done. There's no going back for me. I'm an old man now, with a heart
  too weak to hold its memories."</p>

  <p>"Your memories would overtax the strongest heart," she told him; then
  asked curiously, "Has all desire vanished from your body?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear," responded Mr. Pebble a little sadly, "but not from my
  brain. That's what makes it so difficult to look upon you as you deserve
  &mdash;to estimate you dispassionately for what you are."</p>

  <p>"And what am I?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"A saucy, impertinent young wanton with a single-track mind," he told her;
  then added reflectively, "Not that the track doesn't run through diverting
  pastures."</p>

  <p>"You've said it, old man," replied Baggage commonly. "I need a spot of
  diversion."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you won't find any here," said Rex Pebble, "unless you'd like
  to have me try to improve your morals."</p>

  <p>"How can one improve what never existed?" Baggage wanted to know. "I never
  had any morals. That's why I've always remained an essentially honest
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right at that," observed Mr. Pebble. "Human beings are
  cluttered up with morals altogether too early in life. A wise providence
  should wait until our bodies are too old and weak to resent them&mdash;to get
  our backs up, so to speak."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean, get our backs up?" Baggage asked in a puzzled voice. She
  paused, then smiled delightedly. "Ah," she said, "I think I see. What an odd
  way to put it.".</p>

  <p>"You don't see at all," declared Mr. Pebble, "but you're quite right about
  having no morals. You remind me of my mistress."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed the girl. "That old &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you please," Mr. Pebble hastily interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Baggage impatiently. "I'd remind you of all women if
  you only really knew them. At heart we're not nearly so refined as you men
  try to make us, and we know a lot of words, too."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know!" replied Mr. Pebble. "Not only do you know a lot of words,
  but you also love to use them. My life has not been overburdened by too many
  refined women."</p>

  <p>"Then you should know a lot of bad words I've missed," the girl said
  hopefully. "Tell me some."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble looked really affronted.</p>

  <p>"You'd better talk with my mistress," he replied a little coldly, "or
  better still, with my wife."</p>

  <p>"I won't have any dealings with either of those hags," Baggage retorted.
  "They had all the youth of you. What have I got? Nothing but an old
  horrid."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you join the army?" Mr. Pebble ungallantly suggested. "You
  should be able to get plenty of action there."</p>

  <p>"I've had my heart set on you for years," said Baggage. "I hate to let you
  escape me."</p>

  <p>She cuddled up closer to him on the bench and put a cool arm round his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Heaven protect me," muttered Mr. Pebble. "If that woman of mine called
  Spray finds us together like this there'll be no escaping her."</p>

  <p>"I hope she does," said Baggage. "I'd love to annoy her."</p>

  <p>"I feared as much," said Mr. Pebble. "She is annoyed enough already."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" asked the girl, burrowing her small nose into his neck just
  behind his ear. "You smell awfully clean. Why don't you take your clothes
  off?"</p>

  <p>With a startled ejaculation Mr. Pebble broke the girl's strangle hold and
  slid along the bench to momentary safety.</p>

  <p>"You can think of the damnedest things," he complained. "Let me point out
  this to you: I am a clean old man, and you are a vile young woman. We have
  nothing at all in common."</p>

  <p>"I want to bite your ear," said the girl. "That is always a good way to
  start."</p>

  <p>"Keep your teeth to yourself," Mr. Pebble retorted. "What are you thinking
  of starting, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Something in the nature of a seduction," said Baggage. "That is, if
  you'll stop flitting about like some nervous old bird."</p>

  <p>"I am a nervous old bird," replied Rex Pebble. "A very nervous old bird,
  indeed. Why can't you talk and be reasonable instead of mauling me about? You
  have even less consideration for a body than a professional wrestler."</p>

  <p>"Then consider my body for a moment," said Baggage.</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take it back to your pedestal, where it belongs?" asked Mr.
  Pebble.</p>

  <p>"My body belongs with yours," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"Then it virtually belongs in the grave," said Mr. Pebble. "I'm going to
  fall down dead if this keeps up." "Let's fall down together," Baggage
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"By God!" cried Rex Pebble. "If I were twenty years younger, or even ten
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" broke in the girl. "Go on. What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"None of your damn business," said Mr. Pebble. "I'd teach you a
  lesson."</p>

  <p>"How do you know you could?" Baggage challenged.</p>

  <p>"By all that's holy," exclaimed Rex Pebble, now thoroughly aroused, "I
  will teach you a lesson if it's my last act in life."</p>

  <p>He rose quickly from the bench, and ripping off his coat and vest in one
  ruthless movement, tossed them to the flags.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!" cried the undismayed Baggage encouragingly. "Stick out your legs
  and I'll drag your pants off."</p>

  <p>The hard-boiled ardor of the girl was too much for Rex Pebble. With a
  sudden revulsion of feeling he sank back on the bench.</p>

  <p>"What a suggestion!" he muttered. "What a picture! Me with my legs stuck
  out and you dragging off my trousers. What do you think this is, a game?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," replied Baggage. "You can keep your shoes on. I don't mind."</p>

  <p>"I'd look crisp with my shoes on," observed Mr. Pebble. "Not to mention my
  socks and supporters."</p>

  <p>"Who's going to worry about your feet?" demanded Baggage. "Snap off those
  pants."</p>

  <p>"Snap them off?" repeated Mr. Pebble. "Oh, my word. Everything is all off.
  I am definitely beyond seduction."</p>

  <p>"You're no such thing," cried the girl, flinging herself upon him and
  dragging out his shirt tails.</p>

  <p>Once more the famous Pebble courage asserted itself. No woman was going to
  drag out his shirt tails. That was going too far. He rose from the bench and
  seized the girl by the shoulders. Mistaking his intentions she abandoned his
  shirt tails to the light summer breeze, and threw her arms round his neck.
  For a moment they struggled perilously on the edge of the pool, then Baggage
  with a low laugh wriggled from his grasp and sprang lightly away.</p>

  <p>"Pist! She uttered in a piercing whisper. "Look behind you!"</p>

  <p>The water of the pool parted smoothly as the even smoother body split its
  surface. Like a flash of silver Baggage streaked through the green depths,
  then dwindled and disappeared. Where had she gone? Rex Pebble wondered. Had
  the whole episode been a figment of his disordered imagination? Or had
  Nokashima mixed some curious Oriental dream-stuff in the cocktails? From
  cocktails to shirt tails was not a wide leap in thought. Mr. Pebble took the
  leap. His shirt tails were out. They were playing havoc with the Pebble
  poise. That was not a question of imagination. It was grim reality. And
  equally real was the fact that Baggage, in the flesh, had dragged those same
  shirt tails from their tender concealment. An impulsive wench.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble realized with a pang of regret that he could not stand there
  forever gazing into the pool for a last glimpse of that swift silver body.
  Baggage had withdrawn from life as remarkably as she had appeared. He hated
  to turn about and face his mistress. Nevertheless, it would have to be done,
  or she would do it herself by force. He sighed, and without any unnecessary
  ostentation, collected his shirt tails and tucked them out of sight. It was
  not a neat job, but at least he felt less like a flag. Then slowly he turned
  his back on the pool and faced about to meet Spray Summers who, in spite of
  her feet, was bearing down upon him like a ship under full sail. Mr. Pebble
  noted with relief that the good lady appeared to be far more astonished than
  angry.</p>

  <p>"A pretty way to be carrying on at your time of life," she announced, a
  trifle winded from the unaccustomed speed of her progress. "Tell me without
  even attempting to lie, you senile atrocity, just who was that naked trollop
  you were trying to assault before you chucked her into the pool."</p>

  <p>"You've got your facts in reverse," said Mr. Pebble. "In the first place,
  the trollop was trying to assault me, and in the second place, she chucked
  herself in the pool the moment she saw you."</p>

  <p>"Then why doesn't she come up," demanded Spray, "so I could give her a
  piece of my mind? Perhaps she's drowning. I hope so."</p>

  <p>"It was Baggage," said Mr. Pebble. "But she's gone now. Look, Spray. The
  pedestal is vacant!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">4. JUST A DIP AT TWILIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Spray Summers looked with large eyes at the pedestal upon
  which the wench Baggage had once stood so gracefully poised, then she sniffed
  with all the righteous indignation of the most moral woman in the world.</p>

  <p>"Good riddance of bad rubbish," she said. "What was she doing?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I could find out," replied Mr. Pebble, "she was trying to drag
  my trousers off."</p>

  <p>"What for?" demanded Spray.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" asked Mr. Pebble innocently.</p>

  <p>"Who should know better than you?" snapped the woman. "If a man started in
  to drag off my pants I'd ask as a matter of interest exactly what he was
  after."</p>

  <p>"I was a little afraid of the answer," said Rex Pebble.</p>

  <p>"You needn't have been," observed Spray, witheringly. "She must simply
  have wanted a pair of pants. That's the most you could offer the hussy."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that quite enough?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Empty pants never meant much in my young life," said Spray, dropping
  wearily to the bench. "From the way that woman was tugging at you it looked
  to me as if she was after a great deal more than your pants."</p>

  <p>"It would look that way to you," remarked Rex Pebble. "Aren't you the
  least bit interested in the disappearance of the statue?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Spray, passing a hand across her eyes. "Odd
  happenings seem to be the natural order of events this evening&mdash;such as
  Mr. Henry eating the steak and Sue sending me slippers and you fighting with
  a naked woman for possession of your pants. I feel a little odd myself. It
  might be the cocktails, but I haven't felt like this for years."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble took her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"I know how it is," he said. "Almost anything might happen. But," he added
  with a shrug, "nothing ever does. We just sit here growing older like a pair
  of spectators waiting after the curtain has dropped. There's nothing more to
  see and no place new to go, yet here we sit, you with your tired feet and me
  with my bad heart."</p>

  <p>"You were wrestling with a naked woman only a minute ago," said Spray.
  "Isn't that enough for one evening?</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mr. Pebble decidedly, "it is not."</p>

  <p>"How about that precious soul of yours?" asked Spray Summers. "What's
  become of that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it never clicked," said Rex Pebble. "Just a string of long
  words. Certainly, I don't care for you with my soul, because now that you're
  old I think you're pretty awful."</p>

  <p>"And I think you should be chloroformed," retorted Spray. "You sit there
  brooding over the past like an old buzzard on a dead cow."</p>

  <p>"Prettily turned," said Mr. Pebble. "And quite right, too, but one can't
  wrestle with a nude girl, even at my age, without feeling somewhat
  aroused."</p>

  <p>"It would only make me feel tired," observed Spray.</p>

  <p>"Obviously," said Mr. Pebble, "but you're not a man, and I am."</p>

  <p>"You're merely the crumbling ruins of a man," said Spray, pressing the
  hand that was holding hers, "but I like you just the same. You're still so
  much of a fool."</p>

  <p>"But you don't care for me with your soul?" continued Mr. Pebble. "Don't
  tell me that."</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "That sort of talk has always been 'way above my head. I
  don't understand it. If I were a young girl and I came upon you here, I know
  jolly well I wouldn't fall in love with a white-haired man of sixty, no
  matter if I was fairly bursting with soul. I just couldn't do it. And now I'm
  an old woman I don't love you for what you are so much as for what you were
  &mdash;what we were together."</p>

  <p>"That's it," said Rex Pebble. "That's it exactly. I keep calling on you
  and listening to your banalities not for what you are now, but because of old
  associations, for the things we've done and seen together, the good times
  we've had and the bad ones we've shared. Like the memory of a dead child, the
  past holds us together."</p>

  <p>"Beautifully but depressingly put," murmured Spray. "The past is the only
  child I've ever had."</p>

  <p>"He was a lusty little devil," said Mr. Pebble. "I wish we had him
  back."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Spray sadly. "He was a very amusing child and always up to
  mischief." Cupping her mouth in her hands, she turned her head toward the
  house and shouted, "Nokashima, you heathen! We want cocktails!"</p>

  <p>"If he isn't singing aloud to Mr. Henry," said Rex Pebble, "as is his
  custom, it's barely possible he may have heard you."</p>

  <p>As if by magic Nokashima appeared, hurrying busily across the grass. On a
  tray he was carrying the silver shaker and two long-stemmed glasses.</p>

  <p>"That's a real pretty sight," remarked Spray, growing a little esthetic at
  the prospect of a drink. "The white jacket, you know, and the silver shaker
  and the green grass and all. Only the man is vile."</p>

  <p>Collecting a red metal table on the way, the little servant deftly placed
  it before them; then, with a clever flourish, he deposited the tray on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"I had drink all mixed," he announced with satisfaction. "Nice evening,
  madam, for drink. Wine go good with dinner."</p>

  <p>"Damn me if I know how you're still able to walk," said Spray, "let alone
  to think, but for this service, Nocka, I freely forgive you the steak."</p>

  <p>Nokashima giggled his pleasure, gave several quick, ducking little bows,
  and was about to withdraw when his eyes chanced to stray across the pool. For
  a moment he stood staring with foolish astonishment at the vacant pedestal,
  then looked inquiringly from his mistress to Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Naked lady all gone?" he asked in a hushed voice. "She no more be with us
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, Nocka," said Mr. Pebble. "The naked lady seems to have
  taken flight."</p>

  <p>"Too bad," said the Japanese sorrowfully. "She pretty good, I thought. She
  very nice." Once more he was about to turn away, and once more he stopped as
  if remembering some trivial incident, "I saw naked lady on next lawn," he
  announced quite casually. "She look like our one only this naked lady all
  flesh and no stone."</p>

  <p>"What was she doing on the next lawn?" asked Spray Summers, always alert
  for a little scandal.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she just attack chauffeur," explained the Jap indifferently.
  "Chauffeur called Alfred. Naked lady very determined. She get Alfred down
  right on grass &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pretty," interrupted Spray sardonically. "And only next door. Go on,
  Nocka."</p>

  <p>"Then Alfred spring up," said Nokashima, "with big howl but no pants. Just
  drawers for Alfred."</p>

  <p>"The poor chap seems to have escaped not entirely without honor," observed
  Mr. Pebble, "although it was just drawers for him. Were they long, Nokashima,
  those drawers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, boss, with bags," said the Jap. "Quite funny."</p>

  <p>"She may have been naked," put in Spray, hoping to cast a feeble beam of
  morality into the darkly unmoral jungle of her little servant's mind, "but
  she was far from being a lady. She actually attempted to take off Mr.
  Pebble's pants."</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," agreed Nocka sociably. "I saw that, too. Very active
  occasion. She pretty good."</p>

  <p>"Nocka," put in Spray severely, "you can take yourself off without any
  more personal observations, or I'll chuck you out on your ear."</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," murmured the small man, with one of his quick bows.</p>

  <p>This time, when Nocka withdrew he made no attempt to turn back. He had
  read correctly the danger signals sparking in the eyes of madam.</p>

  <p>"That naked lady doesn't seem to be having much luck," observed Mr.
  Pebble, looking with a faint grin after the retreating figure of the little
  Jap.</p>

  <p>"She's making progress," replied Spray. "She succeeded in getting your
  shirt tails out and the chauffeur's pants off. Anything may happen when her
  technique improves. Still, I contend her methods are too disconcerting. They
  tend to make the subject forget the object of the assault."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Rex Pebble. "A man is accustomed to take the initiative
  in such affairs."</p>

  <p>"But they don't take it often enough," replied Spray Summers. "There
  should be an open season for unmarried women over a certain age."</p>

  <p>"From the little I've been able to observe of the modern young woman,"
  said Mr. Pebble, "assault seems no longer necessary. I have an idea there
  should be a closed season for men."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry about that," replied Spray. "Your season is
  closed for good."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Pebble regretfully. "My hunting days are done."</p>

  <p>"And I am no longer hunted," added Spray. "All I am is an old abandoned
  quarry whose feet have been run ragged."</p>

  <p>"I tell you' what let's do," said Mr. Pebble, seized by a sudden impulse.
  "Let's strip off our clothes and take a dip in the pool."</p>

  <p>"Are you craftily trying to get me to help you look for that naked lady?"
  demanded Spray Summers. "We haven't been in the pool for years. The shock
  might kill us."</p>

  <p>"What if it does kill us?" replied Mr. Pebble, now reckless from many
  cocktails. "It would be as good a way to go out as any. My heart is ready to
  call it a day at the slightest provocation. Let's take a chance. The cool
  water might soothe your tired feet."</p>

  <p>This last possibility did much to break down the woman's resistance, which
  at best had never been strong.</p>

  <p>"Give me another cocktail," she said, "and I might consider it, although I
  think the idea is perfectly mad." She accepted the proffered glass and
  polished off its contents with professional celerity. As the potently
  stimulating concoction was assimilated into her system the idea lost some of
  its madness and her mood became more yielding. "Your suggestion has its
  points," she resumed, breaking the short silence. "It might be fun at that.
  We'll take our last swim, and if we do die it will save us a lot of time and
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"You always were a game kid," said Mr. Pebble approvingly. "Especially
  where foolishness was concerned. Come on, let's strip."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to be foolish again," replied Spray. "And this certainly seems
  foolish to me."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later two mother-naked figures were standing on the edge of
  the pool. Had Nokashima been watching&mdash;as he probably was&mdash;he would
  have found the occasion highly diverting. The years had added flesh to Spray
  Summers' body and removed it from Mr. Pebble's. Of the two it was the man
  whose figure appeared the more youthful. Spray was fat and flaccid, given to
  sagging here and there and bulging in various places. When she had finished
  with her body she had shamefully let it down, and now it was taking its
  revenge. Rex Pebble still remained as straight and slim as a boy, but a great
  deal more knobby.</p>

  <p>"I hate you," declared Spray Summers, regarding him enviously. "You remain
  the same from year to year while all I do is get fatter and more jellified.
  It isn't fair. I hate my body."</p>

  <p>"See that scar," said Mr. Pebble, pointing to a long white line on his
  right leg. "I got that twenty years ago when you pushed me into the
  fireplace. The andirons did it. It doesn't seem all that time ago, does
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Spray. "Look at this one." She lifted her left foot and
  displayed a wicked scar. "That came from stepping on a broken glass during
  one of my less responsible moments. It seems only yesterday. I can even
  recall the doctor's face and how I accused him of not knowing his business.
  That was a wild party."</p>

  <p>"Just a couple of old battlers," said Rex Pebble with a grin. "Weather-
  beaten and dishonorably scarred."</p>

  <p>"I've got some on my head," replied Spray Summers.</p>

  <p>"I was always knocking it against things that refused to budge."</p>

  <p>"You were terribly unfortunate that way," agreed Mr. Pebble reminiscently.
  "Always being patched, or stitched, or turning blue in places."</p>

  <p>"I bruised so easily," replied Spray, "and you could never learn to keep
  your great hands to yourself."</p>

  <p>"In those unregenerate days," said Mr. Pebble, "your body attracted my
  great hands like a magnet."</p>

  <p>"Excuse please," a voice broke in behind them. "I catch sight of unfrocked
  bodies, so I bring towels."</p>

  <p>With admirable presence of mind Spray Summers and Mr. Pebble snatched the
  towels from the Japanese and draped them about themselves to the best
  advantage. "You think of everything, don't you?" said Spray, in an evil
  voice. "If I wasn't so busy hiding my person I'd like to break your
  neck!"</p>

  <p>"I not think of this," declared Nokashima. "This occasion too much for me.
  When I see boss and madam without stitch, I think naked lady come back and
  take clothes. I bring towels so not catch cold."</p>

  <p>"I'm the only naked lady around here," said Spray Summers tartly. "Who's
  this person?"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said a tall elderly gentleman, emerging from a clump
  of bushes. "I really wasn't going to make my presence known under the
  circumstances, but seeing you don't seem to mind &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" demanded Mr. Pebble. "I mind a lot."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing in those bushes?" Spray Summers put in. "Do you
  happen to be a Peeping Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it," replied the stranger. "I was merely trying to spare your
  feelings, but as I said, seeing you don't seem to mind &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do wish you'd stop telling us we don't seem to mind," Spray interrupted
  impatiently. "If it wasn't for this towel I'd be groveling on my face in an
  agony of embarrassment."</p>

  <p>"Will you be so good as to state your business," said Mr. Pebble, "and
  then clear out? This isn't a permanent exhibition, you know."</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly," replied the gentleman politely. "An off moment, so to
  speak. It occurred to me in passing that you might be interested in some old
  and rare."</p>

  <p>"Are you the man with the steak?" asked Spray Summers, out of a clear
  sky.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said the old gentleman. "Where does steak come
  in?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it does," replied Spray. "I just thought you might be
  trying to interest us in some old and rare steak. Mr. Henry ate ours all
  up."</p>

  <p>"That was too bad of Mr. Henry," said the old gentleman with vague
  insincerity, looking reprovingly at Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I didn't eat the steak," Mr. Pebble told him. "Mr. Henry is a bloodhound.
  That's a dog. Just who and what are you?"</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Nokashima. "Fifi, she come, too."</p>

  <p>The group turned and watched the excited approach of Spray Summers'
  dangerously pretty French maid. What with her high-heeled shoes, her
  undulating hips, and the mincing steps she took, the girl was literally
  tripping across the grass.</p>

  <p>"My word," observed the purveyor of old and rare. "This begins to look
  more and more like a musical comedy."</p>

  <p>"All we need is a chorus of neighbors," said Mr. Pebble bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Madam!" exclaimed Fifi. "What can one do? This is an affair of love.
  Privacy is most important at such times. These men are not amiable thus to
  delay your pleasure."</p>

  <p>"My God," breathed Mr. Pebble. "Are all women indecent? This maid of yours
  has put us on the spot."</p>

  <p>"A thousand pardons!" cried the elderly gentleman. "I had no idea I was
  interrupting a &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" shouted Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"It's quite all right, Fifi," said her mistress. "We can control
  ourselves. But I don't know what's come over everybody. Nokashima wants to
  keep us from catching cold; you want us to do something altogether different
  and better; this man keeps mouthing about old and rare, and we want to go
  swimming. Everything's all mixed up. Why don't you take them away and stop
  trying to memorize every joint in Mr. Pebble's enfeebled body?"</p>

  <p>"Some are not present," said Fifi.</p>

  <p>"That's just too bad," flung back Rex Pebble. "They're present but
  concealed."</p>

  <p>"My word," murmured the Old and Rare. "This is better than a musical
  comedy. It's more like a burlesque."</p>

  <p>"That monsieur I will take away," declared Fifi, "but not the unclean
  Japanese. He made a lewd suggestion a little while ago, then with a grip
  incroyable in one so small followed it up with a pinch." Here Fifi patted
  herself with a gentle but unabashed hand. "And, madam, I bruise so easily.
  There will be a spot on that place there."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Spray sympathetically. "I sometimes wonder if that isn't
  why we are built so large. You know&mdash;just to have room for the pinches
  of unclean men. And the more unclean they are the more pinches we get."</p>

  <p>"A small pinch, yes," replied Fifi. "One can understand&mdash;one can even
  enjoy. That is a friendly thing and to be expected. But that man there, he
  has the fingers of steel. His clutch is like a trap. He makes me push a great
  cry even when Madam entertains."</p>

  <p>"The wicked little beast," said Spray. "It seems to be a habit with
  him."</p>

  <p>"It is, madam," replied Fifi, elevating her round tragic eyes. "It is a
  mania&mdash;a depravity. Pinch, pinch, pinch, all the time it's pinch. I get
  no rest, and sit down only with groans of distress. The small man with the
  talons, he is making my life miserable. I grow old from his fingers."</p>

  <p>"If I not pinch," put in Nokashima, "Fifi get glum. Then she flaunt it and
  get it in way of work. I pinch and Fifi curse, then start sing so happily
  about la-la-la.. Who is this la-la-la?"</p>

  <p>"Not now, Nokashima," protested Mr. Pebble. "We will go into la-la-la
  later. Everything will be explained, including the technique of pinching
  evil-thinking French maids."</p>

  <p>"I pinch baroness," replied Nocka. "She not cry. She giggle like
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Then shoots your leg full of holes," put in Spray Summers.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried Fifi, completely forgetting herself. "So the depraved one not
  content with mine also pinches those of others. He is a dirty cow and his
  mother never said no to a sailor. Upon the occasion of his next attempt, me,
  I will bite off his fingers."</p>

  <p>With a flip toss of her pretty head Fifi, the fair product of France,
  swayed gracefully across the lawn, her flexible torso keeping rhythm with her
  emotions. Nokashima looked after her undecidedly, quite obviously disturbed
  by some inner conflict.</p>

  <p>"Why should my mother say no to a sailor?" he asked</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble. "That girl not know my mother. She crazy."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Nocka," said Mr. Pebble. "I don't understand her either.
  There's no reason in the world why your mother should have said no to a
  sailor. There's no reason why your mother should have talked to a sailor at
  all."</p>

  <p>"I go find out," replied Nokashima.</p>

  <p>With an extra quick duck of his head the little Jap spell across the grass
  and overtook the French maid. Hurling the mangled remains of the English
  language at each other they disappeared from view behind the garden gate,
  from the other side of which Fifi promptly pushed a great cry.</p>

  <p>"He's at it again," said Spray Summers darkly.</p>

  <p>"At what?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to show you?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You're showing the world already," he answered briskly, then addressed
  himself to the elderly gentleman. "They're all gone except you," he said.
  "When are you going?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as we've settled this little business of the old and rare,"
  replied the gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Listen, mister," said Spray Summers. "I'm old, but I'm not so rare. If
  you don't clear out pronto I'm going to get tough as hell."</p>

  <p>"You are," replied the elderly gentleman, but whether it was a question or
  a simple statement of fact neither Spray nor Mr. Pebble could decide.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you dignify this discussion," Mr. Pebble suggested rather
  hopelessly, "by giving yourself some sort of name?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven strike me pink!" the old gentleman exclaimed. "I entirely forgot
  my letter. I have one, you know, but so much has been going on&mdash;what I
  mean to say is, I already feel a part of the family."</p>

  <p>"Then don't," said Spray crudely.</p>

  <p>The letter he gave to Mr. Pebble read as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter"><i>Dear Rex:<br>
  <br>
  The individual who hands you this note seems to enjoy being known as Major
  Lynnhaven Jaffey. I doubt if he remembers his real name, having had occasion
  to change it so often. He has been everything from a soldier of fortune to a
  high-class swindler. I know he's a first-rate forger because he raised a
  check on me quite successfully.<br>
  <br>
  However, he's a diverting rogue, and in view of his unique qualifications I
  thought he might be ideally fitted for the advertising profession. I am sure
  you will have much in common. He is all yours if the police don't get him
  first.<br>
  <br>
  Most cordially,<br>
  <br>
  Tom Pierce.</i></p>

  <p>"That's very nice," said Mr. Pebble with a false laugh when he had
  finished reading the letter. "He speaks quite highly of you, Major
  Jaffey."</p>

  <p>"He should," replied the Major enigmatically. "Now if you would care to
  give me a small check for a few items I should &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Skillfully make it a large one," Mr. Pebble finished for him. "Don't go
  on. I know all about it, Major. Why don't you toddle back to the house and
  call aloud for a long drink? We'll talk the matter over later."</p>

  <p>For a fleeting moment the Major permitted himself to look slightly
  distressed; then the bland smile returned to his not unhandsome face.</p>

  <p>"A thousand thanks," he replied. "A small drop of something would not be
  entirely unwelcome." Here he bowed gallantly to Spray Summers. "In the
  meantime," he continued, "I hope you enjoy your swim or whatever it was you
  were about to do."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and strode across the lawn, which was just as well
  for all concerned, because Spray had it on the tip of her tongue to call the
  Major a big bum. Instead, she contented herself by sitting down on the flags
  and dipping her feet in the water. Rex Pebble sat down beside.</p>

  <p>"That old man," she observed, "has a very bad mind."</p>

  <p>"According to Tom's letter," said Mr. Pebble, "he's a very bad old man all
  over. I like bad old men."</p>

  <p>"You should," commented Spray. "That's why you're so fond of yourself.
  What an odd sort of evening it's been. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if a
  couple of lions came bounding across the lawn and tearfully pleaded to be
  allowed to listen to Little Orphan Annie."</p>

  <p>With the utmost conservatism Mr. Pebble lowered himself into the pool
  until he was standing on the bottom waist high in water. Turning to Spray he
  was surprised to see her examining her foot with an expression of profound
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What's up now?" he inquired. "Feel any better?"</p>

  <p>"Look at them!" Spray cried, holding out her feet to him. "And take a look
  at those legs. They couldn't be prettier if they belonged to a girl of
  twenty."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble looked at the proffered legs and even went so far as to feel
  them.</p>

  <p>"They look swell," he admitted, "and they feel even better. What's
  happened to them?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied the delighted Spray. "It just happened. Maybe it's
  the water. If it is, you should be fixed up fine by now. Are you?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Come here a second," said Spray.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," replied Mr. Pebble. "I don't like the look in your
  eyes."</p>

  <p>He turned his back to his mistress, peered eagerly down in the water, then
  took a quick jump. With an incoherent cry of exultation he flung himself on
  his face and began to swim the crawl with the vigor of a man far younger than
  his sixty years. Spray watched him with growing astonishment as his long arms
  cleft the water; then, breathing a silent prayer, she slipped into the pool.
  The moment the water closed over her head a feeling of buoyant happiness
  flooded through her. The blood in her veins grew strong with life, and
  weariness fled from her eyes. When Rex Pebble swam back to her from the other
  end of the pool he found a beautiful young woman looking down at him from the
  flags, a woman he had not seen for years save when memory had evoked her
  vision from the past.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!" cried the woman. "Get out of that water quick, or you'll drop
  below the age of puberty."</p>

  <p>"That would never do," said Mr. Pebble, springing from the pool.</p>

  <p>It was a fine figure of a man who took the woman in his arms.</p>

  <p>"What a kiss!" murmured Spray. "What a kiss. Do you remember how! Tell me,
  Rex, is my face burning? How old do you think I look?"</p>

  <p>"Not a day over twenty-five," he declared. "Has anything happened to
  me?"</p>

  <p>Spray inspected the length of the long, lean body, hesitated a brief
  moment, then politely averted her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I should say it has," she announced decidedly. "Why, Rex Pebble, I
  haven't seen you like that for years." She paused for a moment, then added
  demurely, "I mean your white hair is all gone. You might be thirty-five, but
  I doubt it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble looked both proud and embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I say," he said, "what do you think has happened to us?"</p>

  <p>"Darned if I know," replied Spray, eagerly examining various points of
  interest about her body. "I haven't had time to think. With a figure like
  mine I doubt if I ever will."</p>

  <p>"I put it down to Baggage," said Mr. Pebble. "The contact of her body has
  fired this pool with vitality."</p>

  <p>"Make it your business to see that her contact is confined to the pool,"
  Spray Summers warned him, then added with a mocking smile, "Mr. Pebble, don't
  you think we are wasting a lot of time?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>Once more he took her in his arms and held her there for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Thank God," murmured Spray piously, "it's quite dark now."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Pebble, "it covers a multitude of sins."</p>

  <p>"I could stand a multitude of sins," said Spray. "You see, I've been born
  again, and I have no sins left."</p>

  <p>"Something should be done about that," said Rex Pebble, "or you'll fall
  into the error of self-righteousness. I wonder if the door to the pavilion is
  locked?"</p>

  <p>"If it is you can break it down," replied Spray. "What does a small door
  mean in our young lives?"</p>

  <p>"It might mean quite a lot," observed Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>As they walked down the path in the direction of the pavilion Spray began
  to laugh softly to herself.</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" Mr. Pebble wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"This," replied Spray, "is just about going to burn Sue up."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">5. ALARUMS AND INCURSIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Quiet had returned to the garden The grass and bushes were
  powdered with silver dust. Moonlight and starlight sifted through the air. A
  pale unearthly radiance lay over all things save where the tracery of trees
  tossed weirdly beautiful tapestries across the close-cut lawn. In a near-by
  bush a fastidious wing fluttered impatiently with a little drumming sound,
  momentarily ruffling the silence which was lulled again to tranquillity by
  the subdued chirps of drowsing birds. Far below in the dark oblivion slashed
  by the winding valley the lights of the little villages winked vaingloriously
  back at the stars. Like an urgent summons from a lost world the rhythmic
  thrumming of a train rose on the still air, and the pain-edged voice of its
  whistle filled the night with a restless loneliness. Then silence again and
  enchantment, as the stars cast coins in the pool.</p>

  <p>And into this silvery silence two white figures emerged from the small
  pavilion and mingled with the night. The silence was rudely shattered by the
  vulgar sound of a hand slapping bare flesh. No chance now for enchantment.
  They were back again, those two mortals, and with them they had brought a
  lusty love of life.</p>

  <p>"Well, Dame Quickly," exclaimed Mr. Pebble with unwonted commonness as he
  briskly whacked his mistress on the flank, "there's life in the old mare yet
  &mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>,"Ouch!" protested Dame Quickly. "Can't you ever learn when it's time to
  let a lady alone? What a way for a man to act."</p>

  <p>"You should consider your self flattered," responded Rex Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Flattened would be more like it," observed Spray Summers.</p>

  <p>"You're upset," said Mr. Pebble with unruffled urbanity. "Listen, Spray, I
  can scarcely realize we're young again."</p>

  <p>"If you can't realize that," Spray retorted with unnecessary significance,
  "I can't think of any new way to make the fact clear."</p>

  <p>"Let's turn to athletics," Mr. Pebble hastily suggested. "Come on old
  darling, I'll race you to the other end of the pool."</p>

  <p>"I will if you give me half a chance," Spray told him. "No monkey business
  in the water."</p>

  <p>For a moment they stood poised on the edge of the pool; then, like two
  living spears, cleanly sheathed themselves in its star-plunged depths. Behind
  them a trail of sparkling drops fell and twinkled in the moon-light. By the
  time the swimmers had reached the far end of the pool two years had been
  subtracted from their respective ages. And when Spray's gleaming body slipped
  sinuously from the water she stood revealed in the silvery light a beautiful
  girl of twenty-three. Although her figure was full blown and luxurious with
  all the approved pneumatic features, still it carried the speed and lithe,
  sleek grace of a soft-footed cat of the jungle. An instinctive temptress was
  Spray, as are most women, which is just as well for the good of the species.
  Long lashes, wet from the pool, half veiled her large, dark eyes which were
  very wicked and charming. Her full lips, a trifle slack, were parted in an
  indolent smile. Hers was the fascination of youth made dangerous by a world
  of experience. There were two small ears, a short, selfish nose, and a
  wilderness of copper-colored hair, now matted to her head and spangled with
  drops of water.</p>

  <p>The man who stood beside her was no mean companion, although it would
  never have occurred to an artist to single him out for a model for an epic
  advertisement of drawers, cigarettes, or motorcars. Ten years the senior of
  his mistress, he had an attractively knit body, long of limb and loosely
  jointed. And his muscles were not of the knobbily obtrusive variety, being of
  the sinewy pattern that told of a flowing continuity of endurance rather than
  brute strength. Yet in spite of his youthful appearance some traces of the
  man of sixty still lingered in his face. Unlike the more volatile Spray, he
  had not lightly cast aside the disillusioning knowledge of a past which had
  now so strangely become the future. His clear blue eyes were as wise and
  defensively skeptical as they had been, and the deep lines that cleft his
  cheeks gave an odd effect of maturity. His hair was rather silly, sandy
  colored and too finely spun. It did much to destroy the natural dignity of
  the man's expression. Beneath the eyes the cheek bones were harshly
  prominent, and the skin that slanted down to the chin had a firm, hungry
  leanness. His long thin face bore a stamp of distinction, a patrician type,
  the strong, aquiline nose made somewhat less formidable by the mouth beneath
  it, with the slow smiling lips a little bitter yet wholly pleasure-loving. It
  was a difficult face to read, so marked was it with conflicting
  characteristics&mdash;the face of a man who could scale the loftiest heights
  or else take a tremendous tumble down them with an equal thoroughness of
  purpose. One thing was fairly certain, Rex Pebble would never stand still in
  the same place long.</p>

  <p>"You know," remarked the girl, lazily flexing her body, "if we keep
  fooling round this pool we'll be getting childish next."</p>

  <p>"Even that," observed Mr. Pebble, "would be preferable to senile
  decay."</p>

  <p>"I like us just as we are," declared Spray, "with a few cocktails tossed
  in just for good measure. Are there any left?"</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble tested the shaker, then filled two glasses and extended one to
  Spray.</p>

  <p>"Here's to that lush nymph, Baggage," he said, flooding his drink with
  moonlight, "a fair, virile wench with a bountiful disposition."</p>

  <p>"You better lay off that supersexed wanton," Spray Summers warned him. "No
  one yet has ever accused me of being stingy. Furthermore, there's your old
  wife to be considered. What are you going to do about her?"</p>

  <p>"Great guns!" exclaimed Mr. Pebble, suddenly concerned. "My wife! What is
  she going to do about me? is a lot more like it. I'll still carry on, of
  course. There's such a thing as loyalty. A chap can't very decently abandon a
  legitimately old wife simply because he happens to have suddenly grown
  backwards."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she'll die soon," said Spray consolingly. "It's almost time she
  did."</p>

  <p>"God!" ejaculated Mr. Pebble in a shocked voice. "What a thing to suggest!
  Would you like to have me murder her, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Not immediately," she replied calmly. "I want my revenge first. When she
  sees me all dolled up in the latest and most youthful styles she'll probably
  be glad to die."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't rub it in too much," Rex Pebble told her.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about me," said Spray. "You have quite enough to worry about
  as it is. There's your business connections, for example. Do you think people
  are going to believe you when you tell them you're Rex Pebble?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care how passionate a woman may be," Mr. Pebble declared in a
  disgusted voice, "the practical side of her nature is sure to crop out at the
  wrong moment." Thoughtfully he sipped his cocktail, then resumed:
  "Indubitably there are going to be no end of embarrassing complications, but
  on this happy occasion I steadfastly refuse to anticipate them. Trouble can
  find its way about without my assistance."</p>

  <p>"Here comes a compact little chunk of it now," observed Spray Summers,
  hastily snatching up a towel. "That runt of a heathen is running as if his
  heart would break, if he had one. Wonder what's taken possession now of his
  undeveloped mind?"</p>

  <p>In a condition of mental and physical demoralization, Nokashima arrested
  his mad progress and stood scrutinizing the two nude figures, his small,
  rapidly blinking eyes generating hopeless bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"This night," he announced at last, "the nakedest I recall. No clothes for
  anybody. Maybe I take off mine too."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Pebble hastily. "Don't do that. Someone must stay
  dressed."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps yes," agreed the little Jap. "You see two other naked bodies
  knocking about? Old naked bodies&mdash;not so good."</p>

  <p>"The parchment-faced little ape," muttered Spray Summers. "I like his
  nerve."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Nocka," said Rex Pebble. "Those old bodies you referred to so
  offensively are new again. Here they are, standing right before you. Don't
  you recognize our voices?"</p>

  <p>Nokashima received this startling information with truly admirable self-
  control.</p>

  <p>"How nice," he said approvingly. "Hot stuff now."</p>

  <p>"Just what does he mean by that?" inquired Spray. "Is there no bottom to
  his depravity?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask him to elaborate," replied Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Voices just same," continued the grinning servant, "but bodies quite
  different. Very rapid improvement. Boss look similar to young nephew, Mist'
  Kippie. Madam some wow. Look like naked lady. Madam have every-thing. Pretty
  good, I, think."</p>

  <p>"Only pretty good," put in Spray tartly. "They don't come any better. I'm
  the swellest-looking naked lady you ever clapped an eye on, you squat myopic
  dreg."</p>

  <p>"Madam look like naked lady on next lawn," declared the myopic dreg as if
  he had not heard. "You know, boss&mdash;pants snatcher."</p>

  <p>The little man's eyes were not as myopic as Spray had told him. She did
  look remarkably like the nymph, Baggage. Her half-parted lips had the same
  provocative smile, and her body the same brazen challenge.</p>

  <p>"You do look a lot like Baggage," remarked Mr. Pebble, regarding her
  curiously. "I knew there was something just a little different about you.
  Every now and then I've had a feeling she was looking out at me through your
  eyes. I hope it isn't a case of atavism. If she has merged her peculiar
  talents and disposition with yours there won't be a pair of trousers left in
  the countryside."</p>

  <p>"How come you and Madam so much younger, boss?" Nokashima wanted to know.
  "Big surprise to me. Head take spin. Very strange thing, this. Very
  strange."</p>

  <p>"It is," agreed Mr. Pebble. "And it has to do with magic. Some day, Nocka,
  I'll tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>"Magic," repeated the Japanese. "You believe magic, boss?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's no way of getting around it," replied Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I know man who got around magic," declared Nokashima. "He Japanese fella,
  too."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" asked Spray Summers, interested in spite of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"By squeeze," replied the servant.</p>

  <p>"What did he squeeze?" demanded Rex Pebble, then hastily added, "Think
  well before you answer."</p>

  <p>"Well," vouchsafed Nocka, his eyes growing even more animated, "this man I
  know meet fox once. Fox suddenly turn into beautiful naked lady. By and by
  man and lady go sleep. When man wake up fox sleep on pillow beside him. Man
  nudge fox. 'Where my beautiful naked lady?' he ask. 'I that beautiful naked
  lady,' declare fox, much amused. 'Maybe yes to another fox,' say man all
  excited, 'but you great disappointment to me.' Here man squeeze down own
  throat of fox. Fox turn into big snake. 'Goodness gracious,' says man, 'this
  get worse and worse. This quite impossible now.' He keep on with squeeze, and
  snake turn into little flea. 'What idea?' demand man. 'Little flea not help
  matters any. Only small strand of patience remain.' Flea only giggle with
  rage-provoking mirth. 'You do that on other side of face,' grit man, and with
  both hands squeeze down on neck of little flea."</p>

  <p>"How in God's name," demanded Spray in a thoroughly exasperated voice,
  "could that friend of yours squeeze down with both hands on the neck of a
  little flea? A flea hasn't got any neck to speak of&mdash;not even a big one.
  You're just telling us a long string of tiresome lies. How did it turn
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Well," resumed Nokashima, drawing a deep breath, "flea make great moan
  and groan, then utter piercing scream and turn into lobster, and lobster turn
  into sheep. 'Getting close,' say man, 'but not quite.' He squeeze some more,
  and sheep turn into naked lady. 'Hullo,' say man. 'Where you been?' 'I been
  in trouble,' say naked lady, very hoarse. 'No more choke now, if please.' So
  man take hand from throat of naked lady and place elsewhere. Naked lady
  giggle just like flea. 'Suppose I turn into angry tiger?' she ask. 'If do,'
  say man, 'you have to hurry like hell.'"</p>

  <p>"He did?" said Spray, now deeply interested. "And what did the naked lady
  do?"</p>

  <p>"She not turn into angry tiger," replied Nokashima. "She give up."</p>

  <p>"It was about time she did," declared Spray. "Just imagine, going through
  all that for no earthly reason. She should have given up in the first place.
  The man must have been frantic."</p>

  <p>"That man my cousin," the small servant concluded proudly. "He quite fond
  of magic."</p>

  <p>"He had every reason to be," said Mr. Pebble. "I'm quite fond of magic
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me," Spray Summers unamiably demanded of the
  little yellow man, "if you came streaking across that lawn like a bat out of
  hell for the express purpose of telling us a long, lying, and very dirty
  story about fleas, foxes, and naked ladies, not to mention your lecherous
  cousin?"</p>

  <p>Nokashima's expression underwent a sudden and startling change. His
  features were twisted into lines of consternation.</p>

  <p>"Goodness gracious!" he exclaimed. "So sorry, madam. Bad business back at
  house. We are all very deep in trouble."</p>

  <p>"I knew it," declared Spray in tones of deep conviction. "I knew it from
  the moment he opened his lying mouth. That old and rare major has either
  walked off with all the silver or else set fire to the house. Which is it,
  Nocka?"</p>

  <p>"You quite right, madam," said the servant, gazing with surprise upon his
  mistress. "House on fire all right, but not like you say."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Rex Pebble quickly knotting the towel round
  his waist. "Speak up, you graven image."</p>

  <p>"It was steak," spoke up the graven image obediently.</p>

  <p>"I see it all now," said Spray with suppressed fury. "The steak got loose
  and went dashing about setting fire to the house. It's all very clear." She
  was silent a moment, then suddenly shouted at the startled Jap, "Be quick,
  weazened little liar of a man, what did the steak do this time?"</p>

  <p>"Oh well," said Nokashima, a little sadly. "You know how it is, madam.
  Steak catch fire and burn oven up and oven catch fire and burn room up and
  room &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know how it is," cried Spray in a wild voice. "And room catch fire and
  burn house up. We could play this game indefinitely. Come on, Rex, let's run
  like hell."</p>

  <p>Following the example Mr. Pebble had set with his towel, Spray raced
  across the lawn, the sketchily draped Mr. Pebble at her heels, and the
  weazened little liar of a man, thoughtfully carrying the cocktail shaker,
  making scrambling noises in the rear while idly toying with the idea of
  suicide.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the three of them burst into the kitchen, which was
  filled with smoke and overflowing with firemen. Water applied with
  indiscriminate generosity composed the third and most disturbing element save
  one. That element was Fifi, the French maid. She was pushing both cries and
  firemen about with impartial zeal.</p>

  <p>"Malheureuse!" she was lamenting as the group arrived. "This is conduct of
  the most furious. Madam will be decomposed. Allez-vous en, soiled cows! Vien
  vite."</p>

  <p>"What kind of lingo is that broad gargling?" a fire-man was asking his
  chief when the voice of Spray Summers cut through the smoke and
  confusion.</p>

  <p>"Nocka, you rat!" she cried. "What have you done with that steak? I'm
  going to have my dinner if I have to eat it on the lawn."</p>

  <p>"Too crisp, madam," protested Nokashima. "Steak start all the
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Then fill that shaker," she snapped. "I'll drink my damn dinner. Where
  did all these silly-looking men come from? Tell them to clear out."</p>

  <p>Fifi gave a small shriek that sounded more pleased than embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"There are two nudes!" she exclaimed. "Regardez-la."</p>

  <p>"Say, Chief," demanded the inquisitive fireman, "what kind of a house is
  this anyway? A sporting house?"</p>

  <p>"You ask too many questions," retorted the chief. "Do you know where the
  fire is? I can't find a flame."</p>

  <p>Upon the entrance of Spray and Mr. Pebble the business of fighting fire
  had been brought to a sudden and complete stop. The firemen were now standing
  about, their expressions registering emotions running from profound
  disapproval to open admiration, according to the characters of their
  individual owners.</p>

  <p>"Say, sister," a voice sang out, "have you been playing strip poker?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, lady," another voice called, "you're a big girl now. Why don't
  you hide your shame?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, buddy," a third voice inquired. "Who do you think you are&mdash;
  Strangler Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him for me," said another, "his cute little towel isn't on
  straight."</p>

  <p>Nervously clutching his sole claim to decency, Mr. Pebble turned to
  confront his tormentors, then the hopelessness of the situation overcame
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nokashima," he said wearily. "Are those cocktails finished yet?"</p>

  <p>"Gord amighty!" observed a fireman in an awed voice. "With the house
  burning down around them all those two seem to care about is eating and
  drinking and carrying on foolish. I can't figure these society birds
  out."</p>

  <p>"I could carry on foolish myself," contributed a brother-in-arms,
  regarding Spray Summers with unconcealed admiration. "That dame is making me
  downright silly."</p>

  <p>At this point the chief decided it was high time to intervene.</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," he said, stepping up to Spray. "You'd better run upstairs and
  put on some clothes. My men can't keep their minds on their work with you
  sticking around. I'm sort of slipping myself."</p>

  <p>Spray laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"What about the fire?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We're looking for that now," said the chief, scratching his sorely
  perplexed head. "There's got to be a fire somewhere, what with all this
  smoke, but damn me if I can find a single flame."</p>

  <p>An anguished cry burst from Mr. Pebble, and the assembled firemen broke
  out into a chorus of coarse laughter. Spray turned quickly and looked at her
  companion in nudity, then added her voice to the chorus. Mr. Pebble's towel
  lay uselessly at his feet. Furiously he wheeled about and confronted the
  small French maid. This one, after a rapid survey, raised her wild eyes to
  heaven.</p>

  <p>"This," she said in a voice choked with emotion, "is far more than I
  asked. M'sieu is too impulsive. We are not alone."</p>

  <p>"Why did you take my towel off?" demanded Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to fix him," exclaimed the maid. "It, as you say in your
  language."</p>

  <p>The laughter of the firemen increased in volume. "It?" repeated Mr.
  Pebble, in a shocked whisper. "It? Just what do you mean, Fifi?"</p>

  <p>"That!" cried Fifi, pointing, and Mr. Pebble shrank back from the
  unabashed finger. "The towel, m'sieu. Me, I want to fix that towel. It was
  about to descend."</p>

  <p>Here she stooped suddenly and deftly flipped the towel. round Mr. Pebble's
  waist.</p>

  <p>"Here! Here!" he exclaimed, seizing the towel with both hands. "Don't do
  that, Fifi. I can manage it." Thinking Mr. Pebble was endeavoring to toss the
  towel aside, Fifi struggled all the harder.</p>

  <p>"But M'sieu should wear at least a little something," she protested.
  "These firemen, they have no appreciation."</p>

  <p>"Take your hands away from that body," Spray Summers broke in angrily as
  she strode across the room. "Your appreciation is altogether too
  personal."</p>

  <p>But the little French maid was not to be so easily turned from her
  purpose. Not recognizing her rejuvenated mistress, she clung gamely to her
  end of the towel while Spray snatched the other from Rex Pebble's nerveless
  grasp. Once more he was bereft of adornment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," he protested, dancing agilely after the hotly contested towel
  in the vain hope of obtaining some small degree of protection from it. "Can't
  you two women settle this matter amicably? Why not give me the towel? I'm
  still quite old enough to know what to do with it, and," he added earnestly,
  "I want to do it very badly."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, M'sieu has sufficient age," said Fifi. "I could see that at a
  glance."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that, Rex?" cried Spray. "This product of the Parisian
  boulevards has been giving you the once over."</p>

  <p>"So has everyone else," said Rex Pebble in a hopeless voice. "Where the
  hell is Nokashima? Hey, Nocka, bring me a tablecloth or anything else that's
  handy. I'd be glad to get even a doily."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a great deal of china falling crashingly to the
  floor. This was almost immediately followed by the lurching entrance of the
  Japanese, negligently trailing a tablecloth. It was plain to see that the
  little man was far gone in drink.</p>

  <p>"Here is, boss," he announced thickly. "I snatch off table plenty
  quick."</p>

  <p>"So we heard," said Mr. Pebble dryly as he took the tablecloth and draped
  it round his body in a sketchy imitation of a Roman toga.</p>

  <p>"That right, boss," said Nokashima approvingly. "All things concealed from
  prying eye now. You look so nice. Just like long-dead statue."</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Spray, in trying to gain possession of Mr. Pebble's
  abandoned towel, stood in imminent peril of losing her own. Preferring to
  retain her dignity rather than to win a hollow victory, she suddenly
  relinquished her hold on the towel, with the result that Fifi was sent
  hurtling through space into the arms of the little Jap, who clung to her for
  a moment, then carried her with him to the floor from which she promptly
  began to push a series of frantic cries.</p>

  <p>Upon this scene of utter confusion a third nude figure entered and stood
  peering down with polite interest on the two struggling bodies. This third
  nude figure was also draped in a large bath towel. And the figure, such as it
  was, belonged to Major Lynnhaven Jaffey.</p>

  <p>"I was taking a bit of a shower," he explained to the room in general,
  "when, hearing a great commotion, I thought that possibly something might be
  wrong. Apparently there is."</p>

  <p>"Everything is wrong," replied Spray Summers. "Every damn thing."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the Major suavely. "This has all the ear-marks of a very low
  stag party. How I enjoyed them in my youth&mdash;the lower the better. I hope
  I'm not interrupting the entertainment."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Mr. Pebble assured him. "Nothing seems to be able to
  interrupt this entertainment. And in the meantime the house is afire."</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" exclaimed the Major, nervously fingering his towel. "My
  old and rare will burn."</p>

  <p>"Your old and rare what?" demanded the chief in an uncompromising tone of
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said the Major firmly. "Never mind. I must protect my old
  and rare."</p>

  <p>And with this he quickly departed,</p>

  <p>"Damn me," said the chief, greatly puzzled, "if I can see why his old and
  rare should burn any faster than the rest of him. This is the craziest house
  I've ever been in. What's wrong with all you people, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I've got it, Chief," declared the inquisitive fireman. "We've been lured
  to a nudist colony."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah?" cried Spray Summers in a nasty voice. "I wish someone would
  lure you to a graveyard! I'm getting sick of this. Come on, Rex, let's go
  upstairs." At the door she paused and looked back at the little Jap upon
  whose deflated chest Fifi was now sitting. "Nokashima," said Spray severely,
  "stop pinching that French trollop and snap to it with those cocktails. This
  smoke has made me thirsty."</p>

  <p>"I not pinch French trollop," said Nocka, in a weak voice. "She sitting on
  it, madam, and me, too."</p>

  <p>"Let the little drunkard up, Fifi," continued Spray.</p>

  <p>"And give those dull-looking firemen something to drink. It might sharpen
  their wits a bit."</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Fifi, looking curiously at the woman standing in the
  doorway, "who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm your mistress," replied Spray coolly. "I've had my face lifted and
  everything else, too."</p>

  <p>"And the M'sieu," asked the maid, "is he a new one, madam, or is he the
  old?"</p>

  <p>"He is the old," answered Spray. "And was he lifted, too?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely out of himself," said Spray, "but remember this, Fifi, just what
  was lifted should be no concern of yours."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">6. THE MAJOR'S OLD AND RARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Henry, the non-smeller, felt nervously exhausted. By
  awkward leaps and bounds he was rapidly becoming a mental case. These leaps
  and bounds had carried him to the comparative seclusion of the front hall
  closet. Here he lay and considered the demolishment of his comfortable
  routine. The trying events of the evening had shot it full of holes. Mr.
  Henry seriously doubted if he would ever have the heart or the strength to
  reestablish it again.</p>

  <p>From street corners the dog had hitherto been fearsomely impressed by fire
  engines and had vaguely wondered what devil's work they were about, but until
  to-night he had never had any dealings with the rough-and-ready gentlemen who
  clung to these moving vehicles on their terrific dashes through the streets.
  This one experience had been more than enough for Mr. Henry. Being a dog of
  delicate sensibilities, he had formed the lowest opinion of the swarm of
  heavy-handed ruffians that had so ruthlessly invaded the privacy of his home.
  The vast quantities of water they had brought with them, together with the
  alarming appearance of so much smoke, had forced the animal to retreat with
  streaming eyes and a wet hide to his present place of safety.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Pebble and his mistress discovered Mr. Henry on their way
  upstairs. For a moment they stopped to consider the fitfully trembling
  bloodhound; then Spray's lips slowly curved in scornful lines.</p>

  <p>"Look at the recumbent coward," she said. "Look at him." She waved a hand
  disparagingly at the dog. "He lets the house burn down. He lets us all die in
  agony. He says, 'To hell with all that so long as I am safe and undisturbed.'
  And there he plops his great body down in that closet and reclines in a half
  swoon. If there ever was a pansy bloodhound that dog is it."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily a pansy, Spray." Mr. Pebble spoke up in defense of the
  dog. "That's a pretty hard term to apply to a bloodhound. Only a short time
  ago I would have swooned with the greatest relief in the nearest closet at
  hand. The poor beast is a little fastidious about firemen, perhaps. Can't say
  as I blame him for that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I blame him for everything," retorted Spray. "If he hadn't eaten up
  our steak there wouldn't have been any fire, and if there hadn't been any
  fire there wouldn't have been any firemen. The dog deliberately got us into
  this jam. He couldn't have done any worse had he gone rushing through the
  streets screaming, 'Fire!' at the top of his lungs."</p>

  <p>"You're beginning to talk like Nokashima," Rex Pebble warned her gently.
  "Don't do it, for my sake. I'm not even convinced there is a fire."</p>

  <p>"Then you're just as dumb as those firemen," she retorted. "Never sure of
  anything. I suppose you'd have me believe there isn't a fire raging somewhere
  in this house? Don't be an ass. We're actually trembling on the brink of a
  volcano. It's terrific. And there that foolish sissy soul-fully luxuriates in
  the clutch of abject fear. No wonder he hasn't any girl friends. The poor
  mutt hasn't stayed away from this house a single night in his life. Does he
  expect us to carry him out in our arms? I'd like to torch-murder the
  beast."</p>

  <p>"You're a little unfair to Mr. Henry," said Rex Pebble mildly. "I hope you
  wouldn't like the dog to become a debauched bloodhound. He's bashful about
  his nose, perhaps. I should imagine a smell-less nose would be a terrible
  handicap to a dog in his relations with the opposite sex. You must know what
  a high value a dog places on his nose."</p>

  <p>"I neither know nor care what a dog places on his nose," she replied. "I'd
  like to place a price on that dog's head. I have my own nose to worry about,
  and it's fairly gushing out smoke. And another thing, Mr. Henry isn't
  atrophied in all his parts. He must be alive somewhere. Even if I were deaf,
  dumb, and blind I'd still find my man, believe me."</p>

  <p>"I do, Spray," Mr. Pebble said with great sincerity. "I don't doubt it for
  a moment. You'd even find your men, but you shouldn't judge a clean-living
  bloodhound by your low standards."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry did not at all relish the situation in which he found himself
  placed. He strongly objected to having himself discussed by persons he
  believed to be perfect strangers. Unable to recognize his old friends by
  their respective smells, he could find no traces in their radically altered
  bodies to give him a clue to their real identities. One thing alone remained
  familiar, and that was the sound of their voices. But this strange
  phenomenon, instead of comforting the dog, disturbed him all the more. How
  could these apparently new bodies make noises exactly like the old ones?
  Furthermore, these strangers had succeeded in ascertaining his name. That
  looked bad. They were doubtless up to some mischief&mdash;probably trying to
  snatch him for ransom. Unwilling to give any cause for offense, he wagged a
  deprecating tail, twisted his back to his audience, and lay still, hoping
  against hope that his little yellow boy friend would stagger to his
  rescue.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Henry's so lazy with his tail," Rex Pebble remarked sadly as he
  slowly mounted the stairs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble maintained a suite of rooms in his mistress's establishment.
  When things got too hot for him at his own home he frequently found it
  expedient thither to repair in search of mental tranquillity as well as
  bodily safety. Inasmuch as neither of these conditions lasted very long in
  the company of either woman, he was forced to do considerable traveling
  between the two houses. Mr. Pebble could not remember ever having been so
  fortunate as to find both of the ladies agreeably disposed towards him at one
  and the same time. Not infrequently in his endeavors to escape conflict he
  found himself leaping from the frying pan into the fire, both ladies being in
  their most hellish moods. In compensation he comforted himself with the
  thought that if Socrates achieved self-discipline by putting up with
  Xanthippe, he himself, by living with two shrews, might in the due course of
  time become twice as good as a philosopher&mdash;that is, if he did not crack
  under the strain. For the sake of convenience no less than cleanliness he
  found it helpful to maintain in each establishment a duplicate wardrobe and
  set of toilet accessories.</p>

  <p>In the upper hall he took leave of his mistress and made his way to his
  own quarters. Here, for the good of his soul and the appeasement of his
  disgruntled poise, he poured himself a stiff drink and polished it off at a
  gulp. When both poise and soul were feeling somewhat bucked up, it occurred
  to him he might as well take a shower to dash off some of the wear and tear
  sustained by too long confinement in the smoke-filled kitchen. When this
  little matter had been safely put behind him, it again occurred to Mr. Pebble
  that it would be even a better idea to take still another drink for the
  purpose of keeping his soul and his poise in the pink of condition to which
  the first drink had jerked them.</p>

  <p>It was while he was thus conscientiously employed that the sound of
  strange voices attracted his attention to the bedroom occupied by his
  mistress. Had that good lady been inhabiting the body she had possessed
  previous to her immersion in the pool, it would have mattered very little to
  Mr. Pebble if she had chosen to entertain the entire Marine Corps in her
  bedroom, but in her present rejuvenated condition he decided that such
  liberties smacked a trifle of immorality and were greatly to be deplored.</p>

  <p>Tossing his soul and his poise to the four winds, but still retaining
  possession of his glass, Rex Pebble padded softly across the hall and bent an
  attentive ear to his mistress's door, sipping thoughtfully the while. It
  should be said for Rex Pebble that he was blissfully unconscious of the
  damning fact he was seriously involving himself in the low practice of
  eavesdropping. To make matters even, however, it should also be stated that
  had he been aware of the nature of his occupation it would have made very
  little difference to him. He had lived too long with two women not to know
  that the game was played without any rules. It was catch as catch can always.
  The great hother and pother which nice people felt themselves called upon to
  make about eavesdropping did not trouble Rex Pebble at all. While admitting
  the fact that the eaves-dropper seldom heard anything good about himself,
  experience had proved that he frequently gleaned some in-valuable sidelights
  about others. To him it was the logical and intelligent thing to do,
  especially when dealing with such an unreliable character as his
  self-dramatizing mistress. Therefore, with a placid conscience Rex Pebble
  addressed his lips to his drink and his ear to the door and eavesdropped for
  all he was worth. From the other side of the door Spray Summers' voice came
  to him in cold, dispassionate tones.</p>

  <p>"For the second time," she was saying, "I ask you, Major Jaffey, to
  explain your remarkable conduct. What do you mean by taking a shower in a
  lady's bathroom?"</p>

  <p>"I was told the house was on fire, madam," explained the apologetic voice
  of Major Jaffey, "so I thought I'd be less inflammable if I kept myself
  wet."</p>

  <p>"If that was your brilliant idea," continued Spray, "why didn't you carry
  it out in Mr. Pebble's bathroom?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to bother him with my old and rare,"</p>

  <p>said the Major, as one who explains everything.</p>

  <p>"And what, may I ask," she demanded, "have I ever done to make you think
  your old and rare would be warmly welcomed here?"</p>

  <p>"It's still in tip-top condition," Major Jaffey replied hopefully. "I have
  it right with me."</p>

  <p>"You have it with you," repeated Spray in a startled voice. "Quite
  naturally you would have. Where else could you keep it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I sometimes forget it," the Major casually informed her. "Leave it
  knocking about, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to understand all this," she declared, "and I'm afraid I
  should not be enlightened."</p>

  <p>"But, madam," protested the Major, "it's very interesting, I assure you.
  You couldn't help being delighted."</p>

  <p>"The mere thought of it even is revolting," she retorted. "What sort of a
  proposal are you trying to make, anyway?"</p>

  <p>On the other side of the door Mr. Pebble's ear hinged forward in its
  anxiety to catch the Major's answer.</p>

  <p>"I would welcome an opportunity," he told her, "to exhibit it to you and
  Mr. Pebble."</p>

  <p>"Major," Spray Summers told the man, more in sorrow than in wrath, "I
  don't know why you haven't been run in long before this. Mr. Pebble is not
  the kind of man to be interested in your old and rare. He might be a bad man,
  but he's not morbid." She hesitated a moment, then added, "However, if it
  will make you feel any better I might take a little peek myself just to show
  you I'm broad-minded."</p>

  <p>"What a woman!" Rex Pebble inwardly exclaimed. "Neither age nor youth
  teaches her any better."</p>

  <p>"It's all wrapped up," said Major Jaffey, proudly. "No one can accuse me
  of not taking the best of care of it."</p>

  <p>"Who would even think of it, I'd like to know?" retorted Spray Summers.
  "It seems to be the only thing in the world you give a tinker's damn
  about."</p>

  <p>"It keeps the wolf from the door," observed the Major cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Does it?" replied the woman. "What a remarkable statement to make. I
  can't see the slightest connection between wolves and your old and rare."</p>

  <p>"Madam," responded the Major, "I was speaking merely figuratively."</p>

  <p>"Major," Spray said wearily, "I don't give a damn how you were speaking.
  Either produce this old and rare of which you seem so inordinately proud, or
  else have the grace to take it away. I want to put on some clothes."</p>

  <p>"Very well, dear lady," said the Major. "I won't be half a minute."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble, on the other side of the door, was in a small flutter of
  excitement. He wanted to be in on this. His curiosity was only natural. He
  had heard too much about the Major's highly vaunted old and rare not to be
  interested on his own behalf. It must be something extra special, he
  reflected, as he removed his ear from the door and placed an eye to the
  keyhole. His vision was disappointingly limited. All he could see were small
  sections of two towels. Making the best of a trying situation he riveted his
  gaze on one of these and waited breathlessly. At last this remarkable old and
  rare was about to be revealed. But unfortunately it never was&mdash;that is,
  not on on this occasion. The three actors involved in this unedifying little
  drama were doomed to disappointment by the unexpected arrival of a fourth. A
  small protesting shriek from Spray greeted his arrival.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean," Rex Pebble heard her demand, "by crawling in my
  window? Can't you see I'm nearly undressed?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, lady," said a bored voice. "Hope you don't think I'm blind.
  Nearly's not the word. You damn well are undressed. Why don't you put
  something on?"</p>

  <p>"I've been much too busy," said the lady haughtily.</p>

  <p>"So I see, lady," said the fireman, "but you'll have to cut all this funny
  business out for awhile. The house is on fire."</p>

  <p>"This part of it isn't," objected Spray. "What are you doing up here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for the fire, lady," the voice explained patiently. "The boys
  downstairs are sick and tired of looking for it. And they're drinking
  something fierce. Say, lady, is that old bird your father or just a
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"What's that to you?" snapped Spray.</p>

  <p>"Not a thing, lady," replied the fireman. "Not a thing. I was just
  wondering what he was to you."</p>

  <p>"That, also, is none of your business," Spray retorted, "but if you must
  know, the gentleman was just about to show me his old and rare."</p>

  <p>"No shame," muttered Mr. Pebble sorrowfully. "No shame at all. Just a
  gregarious old moll."</p>

  <p>"What was he going to show you, lady?" asked the fireman in an awed voice.
  "His old and rare, did you say? And you're telling me? Fire or no fire, I
  guess I'll go away."</p>

  <p>"I didn't suggest it," Spray replied defensively, "but the man seems to be
  frantic to have someone look at his old and rare."</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't be a party to this sort of thing," said the fireman. "I'm
  going to clear out."</p>

  <p>"Don't go," said the Major politely. "Perhaps I could interest you. I make
  my living by it, you know."</p>

  <p>"Not off guys like me you don't," proclaimed the fire-man with some show
  of heat. "We've got old and rares of our own. Why should I look at yours? Is
  there anything funny about it&mdash;you know&mdash;anything strange?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I can hardly say," replied the Major in a professional voice,
  "until I've looked yours over."</p>

  <p>"You'll never get the chance to do that," said the fire-man stubbornly,
  "not unless you throw me down and hold me, the two of you."</p>

  <p>"We could hardly bring ourselves to do that," declared the Major. "I
  merely thought you might be interested in comparing items, that's all."</p>

  <p>"That's too much," retorted the fireman. "You have some paralyzing
  thoughts, mister."</p>

  <p>"I'm getting sick and tired of all this talk," broke in Spray Summers.
  "Why don't you both toddle off with your old rares? They're no novelty in my
  young life. Here I come peacefully and decently into my own room to put on
  some clothes, and what do I find? I ask you that. What do I find? One man
  taking a shower and another one crawling in my window, and both of them
  trying to show me their old and rares. What chance has a poor girl got,
  anyway? I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that shrimp Nokashima came crawling
  out from under the bed."</p>

  <p>"Listen, lady," put in the fireman in an injured voice, "I didn't climb up
  this ladder for the express purpose of showing you my old and rare. You've
  got me all wrong. I'm not like that, lady. I generally have to know a person
  a long time before I even think of such a thing. I know how to act. It's the
  old bird that started all this, him and his precious old and rare. What's he
  got to be so proud about, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I can't tell you," Spray declared, "but he does seem to be just
  mad about it. That's all he's had on his mind since the moment I first set
  eyes on him."</p>

  <p>"How they do run on," Rex Pebble mused, looking into his empty glass. "I
  wonder what it's all about?"</p>

  <p>He was not long in learning. Major Lynnhaven Jaffey had been wondering the
  same thing himself. He now decided to take definite steps to bring the
  situation to a head.</p>

  <p>"Aren't either of you fond of reading?" he asked, "because, if you're not,
  I might just as well call the whole thing off."</p>

  <p>"Sure I'm fond of reading," retorted Spray, "but what has that to do with
  your old and rare?"</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," suggested the fireman, seized by a sudden inspiration, "maybe
  the old guy is tattooed. That might explain everything."</p>

  <p>"Will you please keep still!" cried Spray.</p>

  <p>The suggestion of the fireman had so intrigued Mr. Pebble that he actually
  tried to worm his eye through the key-hole. Perhaps, after all, the man had
  hit upon the explanation of the Major's quaint obsession.</p>

  <p>"I confess I am quite unable to follow this conversation," that gentleman
  announced in distant tones, "but I am referring to my collection of old and
  rare books. I have some exceptionally fine items, I assure you."</p>

  <p>For a moment dead silence followed this revelation; then Spray Summers
  rallied her scattered faculties and made as women will&mdash;a courageous
  effort to save her own face at the expense of someone else's.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said a little flatly. "Why, of course. For goodness sake, Major,
  old boy, what did you think I was talking about? Address your remarks to this
  dumb fireman. He's balled everything all up. But don't be too severe with
  him, Major. He doesn't know any better. You know how firemen are. They are
  born with low instincts&mdash;all of them."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" retorted the fireman. "Trying to make me the goat, are you?
  Well, it won't wash. I had nothing to do with this old and rare party to
  begin with. And if you'd like to know the truth you're about the rummiest
  couple I've run into since I've been on the force. There you stand, the two
  of you, with only a pair of towels for protection, and acting as high and
  mighty as if you were clad in blinking ermine."</p>

  <p>"What's a blinking ermine?" asked Spray, hoping to change the subject.</p>

  <p>"Aw, it's some sort of a skin, muttered the fireman sulkily. "You should
  know, lady. They get it off animals&mdash;some sort of animals."</p>

  <p>"Who do?" Major Jaffey wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Does," corrected Spray.</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" exclaimed the fireman. "The guys what go after the
  blinking ermine, I suppose. Don't ask me, lady. I'm just a dumb fireman with
  low instincts like you said."</p>

  <p>"You're all of that," replied Spray, "but I have to ask you questions.
  What makes these ermine blink?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me alone!" cried the fireman peevishly. "I can't stand any more.
  Maybe the blinking ermine blink because they don't know any better. Maybe
  they blink because their eyes get all watery from looking out for trappers.
  There might be a hundred reasons, and," he concluded in a hoarse voice,
  "maybe they don't blink at all. This house is burning up, and there you stand
  trying to get me to tell you bedtime stories about cute little blinking
  ermine. To hell with ermine, I say!"</p>

  <p>"And that's about the only sensible thing you have said," Spray told him
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Madam," declared the Major, "this fireman deserves to be pitied. It's
  plain to see he's in a state of nerves. He might even be a little mad. Not
  dangerous, you know, but still scarcely responsible. I have long believed
  that all firemen eventually become a trifle mental&mdash;like nurses and
  doctors and dentists; also butchers and judges."</p>

  <p>Horrid, gasping noises from the window put an end to the Major's
  observations.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" mouthed the enraged fireman, and this was followed by a sound not
  unlike a long drawn out, "o-o-o,h."</p>

  <p>Neither noise the man made was very pretty to hear. "Just wait till I get
  my hands on the old guy," he continued more coherently. "I'm going to tear
  his naked body to bits."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, my good man," said the Major, not unkindly; then, turning to
  Spray, he politely inquired, "Shall I show you my old and rare now, madam? I
  took the liberty of tucking the bundle in the bathroom where it would be
  quite safe."</p>

  <p>"Then you also took the liberty of tucking your body under the shower,"
  she commented caustically, "where it would be quite safe. Go on and produce
  your old and rare, even if it is an anticlimax."</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," said the fireman plaintively, as soon as the Major had left
  the room, "I'm getting awful tired standing out here on this ladder. Can I
  come in now and adjust my nozzle?"</p>

  <p>"Adjust your what?" gasped Spray a little hysterically, swinging quickly
  about. "You don't know what you're saying. You must be delirious."</p>

  <p>"My nozzle, lady," went on the fireman in a dull, patient voice. "My
  nozzle needs fixing."</p>

  <p>"Be still!" Spray scolded. "Don't go on about it. You're as confiding as a
  boy of five." She looked at the fireman rebukingly; then her heart softened
  at the sight of his worried face. "Oh, all right," she continued in a
  hopeless voice. "It's all too much for a single mind to bear. Come on in if
  you have to, but you've got to wait until the Major gets out of the bathroom.
  What with you and your nozzle, as you so childishly call it, and that one
  with his blooming old and rare, I'm beginning to think I'm going a little mad
  myself."</p>

  <p>And so was Rex Pebble. Unable to stand the suspense any longer, he flung
  open the door and strode majestically into the room. He was just in time to
  see the fireman entering through the window, laboriously dragging after him a
  length of hose with a gleaming nozzle.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Spray, looking at the hose. "Oh dear, how stupid of me. I
  didn't understand."</p>

  <p>"And I still don't," said Mr. Pebble. "What goes on in here?"</p>

  <p>"Gord!" muttered the fireman, gazing at Rex Pebble with round, wondering
  eyes. "Another old and rare. Don't anybody ever wear any clothes at all in
  this joint?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">7. EXIT ON HOOK AND LADDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Why should we wear clothes?" demanded Rex Pebble with an
  ill-advised swish of his toga as he stalked across the room. "this lady and
  myself have been born again. we have nothing to conceal."</p>

  <p>"You've got enough and more," retorted the fireman. "I wouldn't go round
  like that in my own home."</p>

  <p>"Fireman," replied Mr. Pebble, "yours is a mistrustful nature or a very
  bad home. At the moment, I can't say which. You should learn to forget your
  body&mdash;to dismiss it, so to speak."</p>

  <p>"If I had a body like his," put in Spray, "I'd be only too glad to forget
  it. I'd chuck it through the window."</p>

  <p>"What's so awful about my body, lady?" the man asked in hurt tones.</p>

  <p>"Almost everything," declared Spray. "It's overdressed, to start with.
  You've got on a funny hat, and you've got on a funny coat, and your rubber
  boots are a fair scream. I don't know for certain, but I'd lay attractive
  odds you're wearing long drawers as well&mdash;red ones."</p>

  <p>"I am," admitted the fireman. "I always wear 'em, but they are not
  red."</p>

  <p>"As I thought," replied Spray. "They're not red, but he always wears them.
  That means he sleeps in the things, and probably in his shirt, also. Tell him
  to go away."</p>

  <p>"But, lady," protested the fireman, "us boys just naturally have to sleep
  in our underwear."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't sleep naturally in your underwear," said Spray. "Don't try
  to do it in this house."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleeping, lady."</p>

  <p>"You might as well be," she told him, "for all the good you're doing."</p>

  <p>"But, lady," began the fireman, then hopelessly abandoned all thought of
  speaking sensibly with anyone connected with this surprising establishment.
  "You've got me all confused," he finished moodily. "I can't seem to be able
  to think straight any more."</p>

  <p>"Fireman," said Mr. Pebble, "sit down and tell us your story from the
  beginning. Take off your hat and coat and forget dull routine for a space.
  And please endeavor to stop bickering with that woman. You should have better
  sense."</p>

  <p>"But this house is burning up somewhere," the fireman protested.</p>

  <p>"But not here," replied Mr. Pebble calmly, "and we are all that matter.
  Anyway, fireman, if this house does burn down, I'll set fire to another one
  and let you put it out. Nokashima will do it for me."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the voice of Major Jaffey as the man himself staggered
  from the bathroom with a large bundle in his arms. "Ha! How jolly everyone
  looks. Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Will you stop making that foolish noise?" said Spray. "You talk like a
  radio announcer for little children."</p>

  <p>"Forgive my enthusiasm, madam," apologized the Major. "I always get that
  way when exhibiting my old and rare."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble groaned.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would add 'books'," he said, "when you refer to that bundle,
  Major. Although I know what's in it now, the shock still remains."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," agreed the Major readily enough, then paused and looked
  closely at Rex Pebble and his mistress. "Tell me," he continued, "are you the
  same couple I had the privilege of meeting near the pool? You seem so very
  much younger now, but, of course, I may be wrong. The light was failing then,
  and my eyes are not what they used to be. Also, owing to the circumstances, I
  imagine you must have been under a considerable strain at the moment."</p>

  <p>"You can attribute your error to all three factors," replied Mr. Pebble,
  "although I will admit I haven't felt so young in years."</p>

  <p>"I felt that way myself," remarked Spray, "before I got involved with
  these two idiots. They have aged me terribly."</p>

  <p>"Considering your abundant beauty," replied the Major with questionable
  gallantry as he ran his eyes over the woman, "you are lucky you did not get
  yourself even more deeply involved. Had I been a few years younger
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say it and I'll knock your block off," said Spray. "I've stood enough
  from you and your old and rare. Break out your items. Have you any real bad
  books in that bundle?"</p>

  <p>"That's all I have," replied the Major proudly. "Frankly, I don't see how
  any one person could have written some of them. They seem more like a
  compilation&mdash;the dregs of the ages, you know. I've a few that are so
  exceptionally vile they have to be printed in Latin."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't show us any of those," Spray told him. "I'm a patriotic
  woman, and I don't like foreign dirt. It must be made in America."</p>

  <p>"Your country is quite capable of it," the Major assured her generously.
  "But most American women are still a little fanciful about pornography and
  husbands."</p>

  <p>"Pornography and husbands," Spray interrupted, "mean exactly the same
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Which is as it should be," replied the Major, "but as I was saying, my
  lady clients&mdash;they constitute the majority&mdash;seem to fall more
  readily for both men and books bearing foreign titles."</p>

  <p>"They're more depraved," observed Spray, "and all women need a dash of
  depravity to round out their natures. Men are depraved always. Women only in
  spots."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the fireman unexpectedly, "you never seem to be able to get
  out of your spot."</p>

  <p>"Hit him with something," said the lady composedly.</p>

  <p>"I think I've been insulted, although it doesn't hurt any."</p>

  <p>A perfunctory knock on the door heralded the arrival of Nokashima,
  carrying a tall shaker full of fresh cocktails and two glasses.</p>

  <p>"Get two more glasses, Nocka," Spray commanded. "I'm celebrating this fire
  with the dregs of society. It's a regular slumming party."</p>

  <p>"Very good, madam," grinned the little yellow man. "I go get. One glass
  for brute of fire fella, other for Old and Rare." At the mere mention of the
  name Nokashima seemed to become irresistibly amused. He indulged in several
  inane giggles, then rapidly blinked his eyes. "Very funny name, that," he
  commented. "Always good for small giggle. Old and Rare. What is this old and
  rare he all time talk about? I fairly stream with mirth. Such elderly
  gentleman to go on so. Old, yes, but rare&mdash;I not think that, boss. What
  you think? Maybe I know. Maybe I not. I keep mouth shut. Not laughing matter,
  all this old and rare."</p>

  <p>"You neither keep your mouth shut," Spray retorted scoldingly, "nor do you
  refrain from laughing. That's all you've been doing since you tainted the air
  with your presence&mdash;giggling and gibbering like an hysterical high-
  school girl with a case of yellow jaundice. Get out of here and fetch those
  glasses."</p>

  <p>"I get," replied Nokashima. "I get, madam, plenty quick. I know man once
  with old and rare. He Japanese fella, too."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Pebble firmly but sympathetically. "No, Nocka. Not that
  one. You can tell it to Fifi after you've brought those glasses."</p>

  <p>Nokashima was always at his highest efficiency when ministering to
  people's thirst, including his own. He was both generous and broad-minded
  about it. Something in his simple nature was soothed and filled with joy by
  having dealings with either a bottle or a cocktail shaker. He would never
  have lasted long in a bone-dry family. The quick little patter of his feet
  had hardly died away before he was back again with the glasses.</p>

  <p>"Fire fellas all good and drunk," he announced as he filled the four
  glasses. "All wet, too. Unable to find small blaze they put themselves out
  with roars and drinks. Lots of fun down there. Fifi very busy with love and
  fury. I participate, madam, with tentatively. That right, boss?"</p>

  <p>"Almost, Nocka," replied Mr. Pebble. "We'll take that up later. Is there
  still any smoke doing?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty of all that," declared Nocka. "All come from oven where steak
  still smolder. They not look into that. Shall I suggest, madam?"</p>

  <p>"No," Spray told him. "I wouldn't go so far as that. They might think you
  officious. Firemen don't like to be told anything. Just let them romp around
  in their own oafish way. Perhaps they will go to sleep."</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the door, and a fireman partially blinded by either
  smoke or liquor staggered into the room.</p>

  <p>"Chief sends his compliments, lady," he said in a dazed voice. "He wants
  to know if we can set fire to your house in a couple of places&mdash;just
  little ones, you know. You see, lady, we've got to have some sort of a fire
  to give us boys an excuse for having stayed away so long. Can we?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," replied Spray generously. "Go right ahead. Lend us your hook and
  ladder?"</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," replied the fireman with a big-hearted wave of his hand.
  "But don't hurt it. It's a good old hook and ladder. Hal, there, will help
  you. He swings a mean rear wheel."</p>

  <p>"I do that," replied Hal modestly. "Glad to bear a hand." He paused and
  grinned at the other fireman, then added, "These are real nice people after
  you get to know them."</p>

  <p>"That's mighty nice of you," Rex Pebble told the fireman. "It's a funny
  thing, but I've never been on a hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>"You'll like it," said the Chief's emissary simply. "The corners are just
  great. They'll like the corners, won't they, Hal?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Hal. "They'll like the corners."</p>

  <p>"May I be the bell ringer?" asked Spray Summers. "I never rang the bell on
  a hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>"Go right ahead, lady," said the first fireman. "You can ring the bell
  just as much as you please. There's a siren, too."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that dandy!" said Spray. "Empty that shaker, Nocka, and fill it up
  again. Listen, Hal, will you lend me your hat and coat?"</p>

  <p>"Guess I better had," replied Hal, thoughtfully surveying the woman. "You
  don't seem to be willing to wear anything else."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll drive," Mr. Pebble decided, "and the Major can hang on."</p>

  <p>Nokashima giggled at this as if amused by some inner vision.</p>

  <p>"Tough riding for Old and Rare," he said, "but what matter? All in fun. I
  come along with bottles."</p>

  <p>"Must I go?" asked Major Jaffey. "I too have never been on a hook and
  ladder, and I'm not sure that I yearn to acquire the habit at my time of
  life."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've got to come," Spray assured him. "Our hook-and-ladder party
  wouldn't be complete without you, Major."</p>

  <p>The Major sighed resignedly, then retired to the bath-room from which he
  presently emerged attired in a pair of trousers.</p>

  <p>Several shakers later the five members of the improvised fire company, now
  no longer in their right minds, clung to the long vehicle for better support
  and peered unintelligently at its various mysterious parts.</p>

  <p>"It's a wicked-looking thing," observed the Major skeptically. "Which is
  the front end of it, do you suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Here wheel," exclaimed Nokashima. "Maybe that front end. I not sure.
  Maybe is, though."</p>

  <p>"There are two wheels," declared Rex Pebble. "Two good excellent wheels.
  Both different. I'm looking for the front one."</p>

  <p>"There's the front one," said Hal, the fireman. "That's your wheel. I'll
  take the back wheel and twist it clean off."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't do that," objected Major Jaffey. "We might need the thing for
  corners."</p>

  <p>"There are not going to be any corners," said Rex Pebble. "I'm going to
  cut right through them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you take the front wheel and I'll take the back wheel," Spray sang in
  a high, plaintive voice, "and I'll be in wee bits before you."</p>

  <p>"Don't," protested the Major, shivering in spite of him-self. "When your
  voice issues from under that helmet it sounds like a wind blowing from a
  cave. That's a very sad song. I have Scotch blood in my veins."</p>

  <p>"And I have Japanese," Nokashima informed them. "Might not have too much
  of that very long. Where I stand, boss?"</p>

  <p>"Stand on the running board," commanded Mr. Pebble, "so you'll be able to
  run back and forth with the bottles. I want some Scotch whisky in my veins.
  Pass me a bottle." He drank deeply, then surveyed his crew with a kindling
  eye. "A strange gathering," he murmured, "to be seen anywhere, but especially
  on a hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble had spoken no more than what was true.</p>

  <p>For the first time in her life Spray Summers had allowed her personality
  to become completely submerged, although much of the rest of her was fully
  exposed. In place of the towel she wore the fireman's rubber coat, only the
  top button of which was in service. Her head, nose, and eyes were hidden from
  view within the helmet. Her legs and feet were bare save for the unhelpful
  addition of a pair of high-heeled mules.</p>

  <p>"They ought to cut windows in these diving bells," she complained as she
  groped her way round the hook and ladder. "It's like playing with a
  prehistoric animal in the pitch dark. I'm not going to see much life in this
  darned thing."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take it off?" asked Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"I refuse," she retorted. "It must stay on. This helmet disguises my
  sex."</p>

  <p>Major Jaffey laughed mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you think so," he said.</p>

  <p>"Listen, lady," put in Hal, the fireman, "I don't like to say anything,
  seeing as how you all have been so nice to me, but if you're going happily
  about thinking your sex is disguised, someone's going to get an awful shock.
  That helmet just hides your head, and there's lots more to you than that. Why
  don't you button my coat? I always do."</p>

  <p>"You button your mouth," said Spray. "I'm not going to suffocate for
  anybody. And, anyway, what's the great difference between us? You're naked
  from the waist up, and I'm naked from the waist down. It's a tie. And look at
  Gaius Cassius, there. He's just an animated tablecloth."</p>

  <p>It was true. Rex Pebble was stalking about in the darkness very much in
  the manner of the last of the Romans. His feet were encased in a pair of
  soft-soled slippers. Major Lynnhaven Jaffey was dressed in the same fashion
  as the fireman, being content with a pair of trousers. The little yellow man
  was the best dressed member of the party. He was fully clad, and his white
  mess jacket gave a nautical touch to the outfit. However, it must be said
  that it would have been difficult to find five persons who looked less
  qualified to take a hook and ladder out for a spin.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Pebble was saying to no one in particular, "it certainly is a
  bang-up hook and ladder. Never looked at one close before."</p>

  <p>"Bang-up is an unfortunate term," replied Major Jaffey. "I greatly fear
  it's going to look even banger-up before this night is over."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," Mr. Pebble assured him. "Have no fear at all. This is
  going to be a runaway. I could drive the thing in my sleep. Come here with
  that pail, Nocka. I want a drink."</p>

  <p>"We all want a drink, Nocka," said Spray. "We'll make it a stirrup
  cup."</p>

  <p>The little yellow man set down his pail while the party gathered round it
  and selected bottles at random. Stars from a naked sky winked at their
  libations. It was a clear, still night. Occasionally a snatch of song or a
  burst of coarse laughter drifted from the house. Once the French maid, Fifi,
  was heard to push a perfunctory scream, after which the burst of laughter
  was, if anything, even coarser. The street was deserted. What few neighbors
  had been attracted to the spot by the noise of the fire apparatus had
  returned to their respective homes, their fond expectations unrealized. Few
  things are more disappointing to the normally constituted man or woman than a
  fire that fails to come off, especially when the fire belongs to someone
  else. Taking all things into consideration, Rex Pebble could not have chosen
  a better night for a hook-and-ladder ride.</p>

  <p>"To your places, everyone," he commanded. "Hal, you know this hook and
  ladder very much better than we do, help them to climb aboard. Nokashima,
  look alert with that bucket of bottles, and when anyone calls, scramble to
  him with a drink. I suspect he'll need it."</p>

  <p>"Also she," commented Spray.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful if the members of that oddly assorted group actually
  believed they were going through with the mad enterprise up to the moment Rex
  Pebble set the hook and ladder in motion with a violent and ominous
  lurch.</p>

  <p>"It's a runaway," he called back over his shoulder. "I could drive this
  boat with my eyes shut."</p>

  <p>"Hope not do," muttered Nokashima. "If boat run away already, what will be
  later? Mere scamper along, I fear, don't you, boss?"</p>

  <p>"I fear nothing," Mr. Pebble shouted.</p>

  <p>"So do I," sang out Spray. "Lend an ear to this one." Like a soul in
  torment the scream of the siren split through the night.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that," protested the Major, who appeared at the moment to be
  chinning himself on a ladder. "It sounds so ostentatious. Why not glide
  smoothly along so we can all enjoy the scenery?"</p>

  <p>"This crazy hook and ladder doesn't know any better," Mr. Pebble explained
  between lurches. "It seems to have only one speed, and that's high, like
  myself. Haven't found the foot brake yet."</p>

  <p>"Well, hurry up and find it," shouted the firemen, his face streaming with
  perspiration. "If we don't brake together we'll damn well break apart."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a quotation to me," Rex Pebble observed above the racket.
  "Oh, here's the brake. Hold tight, everyone."</p>

  <p>For an awful moment the hook and ladder seemed to be of at least two minds
  about what to do with itself. The front wheels came to a sudden stop while
  the rear ones appeared to be determined to continue forward to see what was
  going on up there. The middle section, after a passionate attempt to buck,
  compromised by slewing sidewise, thus giving to the hook and ladder the
  appearance of a sprawling Z. Mr. Pebble, looking back over his shoulder,
  found himself sitting almost face to face with the fireman in the rear
  seat.</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Mr. Pebble. "How did you get here? I've been
  under the impression there were yards and yards of sheer ladder between
  us."</p>

  <p>"God!" grated the fireman. "What a thing to do! I'm disgusted."</p>

  <p>"Mist' Old and Rare," proclaimed Nokashima, "seem to be disgust also. Hear
  funny noises he make."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," ejaculated Rex Pebble, regarding the dangling body of Major
  Jaffey. "The poor chap. I think we've jerked him into a suicide. He's
  actually strangling to death between two ladders. Hurry, Nocka, and unhook
  his chin. I can't stand those noises."</p>

  <p>"He not make them long," said the little yellow man. "All up soon with Old
  and Rare."</p>

  <p>Giggling callously to himself at the prospect of the Major's approaching
  strangulation, Nokashima wormed his way through a jungle of ladders and laid
  hands on the dangling body. And that was literally what the Major had
  succeeded in doing with his body. In some strange way he had contrived to get
  his neck wedged between two ladders. The rest of the man was swinging free.
  Now, it does not improve a dangling body to be burdened with additional
  weight. The little yellow man burdened the Major's with his, or to put it
  clearly, he added his body to the Major's and clung on. Even in his agony an
  expression of sheer astonishment flickered in the old gentleman's bulging
  eyes before horror once more filled them.</p>

  <p>"Come down," panted Nokashima. "You hear up above? Boss say not dangle. He
  not like whiffling noise. Squeeze hard through."</p>

  <p>Every instinct in the Major's body cried out to have words with this
  maniacal Japanese, but those instincts were set at naught by his rapidly
  closing throat. Rex Pebble had climbed down from his lofty seat and now stood
  watching the efforts of the little servant with deep absorption. He was
  joined by Spray and the fireman.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong now?" she wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"The Major's dangling," Mr. Pebble told her briefly. "I can't drive a
  dangling body through the streets."</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't that little Jap try to push the body up?" demanded the
  fireman. "He's swinging from the poor guy's legs just like they were a couple
  of ropes. That's not going to help his neck any."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the neck is beyond redemption," Mr. Pebble observed. "However,
  there's no harm trying. Hey, Nocka! Stop playing Tarzan with the Major's legs
  and try to push him up. See if you can keep his head on. He'll be no good
  without it."</p>

  <p>Nokashima reversed his tactics and pushed with all his might.</p>

  <p>"You hear up there?" he grunted. "You hear what boss say? Push hard up.
  Altogether push." The Japanese took his own injunction so seriously that the
  Major's long body doubled up like a jackknife. This greatly perplexed
  Nokashima. "Can't squeeze shoulders through now, boss. What say I do&mdash;
  let body hang?"</p>

  <p>"Spread the ladders," cried Hal, the fireman. "Here, let me at him."</p>

  <p>He clawed his way through the ladders and quickly released the Major. That
  gentleman dropped to the street and refused to budge until he had been
  resuscitated by several drinks, after which he called Nokashima every vile
  name he could drag from the darkened recesses of his memory. This served only
  to amuse the little yellow man.</p>

  <p>"Major better dead than live," he observed. "He make bad sounds either
  way."</p>

  <p>"Is that so, you dope-fed flea?" growled the Major, seating himself on the
  curb. "Who did you think you were, anyway, the man on the flying trapeze? One
  would think my neck was a length of molasses candy, the way you wobbled it
  about."</p>

  <p>"Let's try to forget all about it," Rex Pebble suggested, seating himself
  by the Major. "Sit down, everybody, and we'll have a bit of a drink before we
  try another spin."</p>

  <p>It was while they were thus peacefully engaged that they became aware of a
  person behind them. Turning defensively, they confronted the presence. It
  turned out to be a hatless gentleman in evening clothes and a flushed
  face.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said the well-dressed gentleman with childlike directness. "Give
  me some of that drink. I'm thirsty."</p>

  <p>"Why should we give you some of this drink?" asked Spray Summers. "We're
  thirsty, too."</p>

  <p>"But you've got such an awful lot of it," explained the man. "And I
  haven't any."</p>

  <p>"We like a lot of it," Spray retorted.</p>

  <p>"So do I," agreed the man. "Give me just a little sip."</p>

  <p>"Give him a little sip," Mr. Pebble said, then addressed himself to the
  stranger. "Have you got a fire any-where that needs a little putting
  out?"</p>

  <p>"I've got one inside me," said the man, "but nothing can put that
  out."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," said Mr. Pebble. "I mean a real one. We've got a
  hook and ladder we could use if you only had a fire."</p>

  <p>"I've got a house," replied the man thoughtfully. "It would make a good
  fire. It's so big. But you might burn my family up. You don't want to do
  that, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Not especially," said Rex Pebble. "We'll put your family out also."</p>

  <p>"You mean, after it's caught fire?"</p>

  <p>"Any old time," declared Mr. Pebble. "If and when your family catches
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Why not put my family out first?" asked the gentleman.</p>

  <p>"We might wake somebody up," said Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"That's right," agreed the gentleman, now thoroughly convinced. "We'll put
  them out after. Let's have some more drink, then we'll set fire to my house
  and family. Sure you can put them out?"</p>

  <p>"No," declared Spray promptly. "We never put out any fires. My house is on
  fire right now, but we can't find out where."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's your family," suggested the man.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Spray. "I don't think you're right. I haven't any
  family."</p>

  <p>"Then it's burning elsewhere," commented Mr. Pebble.</p>

  <p>"You never lose a chance, do you?" sneered the woman. "When I was a babe
  in arms I had a swell family."</p>

  <p>"All right, sweetheart," said Mr. Pebble, hastily. "All right. Let's not
  start that again."</p>

  <p>"I've put out lots of fires," Hal announced boastfully as he removed a
  bottle from his lips. "I've put out entire cities."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," put in Major Jaffey, "but what we need now is
  someone who knows how to build a fire."</p>

  <p>"I know how to make fire," said Nokashima, "but I not know how to put it
  out. I break down in nerves."</p>

  <p>"I can build 'em," bragged the fireman, "and I can put 'em out. Come on,
  show me this house."</p>

  <p>Together the little party followed Hal across a smooth lawn in the
  direction of a magnificent residence.</p>

  <p>"We'll set it afire in the back," he whispered, "because if we started it
  in the front someone might notice it before it had time to do any good."</p>

  <p>"It's not going to do my family any good, no matter where you set it on
  fire," observed the gentleman. My name is Gibbs. What's yours? I'd like to
  know the name of the people I'm setting my house on fire with&mdash;it seems
  less impersonal that way."</p>

  <p>"That man's name is Major Jaffey," Spray said with great presence of mind.
  "He'll do for the bunch of us. We're all Jaffeys except the opium eater, and
  he isn't human. The Major's our drunken father."</p>

  <p>"He dresses you sort of funny," remarked Mr. Gibbs. "Haven't you enough
  clothes to go round?"</p>

  <p>"Around what?" asked Spray.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," replied Mr. Gibbs. "Don't mention it. Sorry I spoke.
  What a lovely night for a fire. Thought you had no family."</p>

  <p>"I don't count them," Spray told him.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tonight," said the man. "Not even if I tried, but I won't ever
  forget them."</p>

  <p>This sort of conversation was enough to get them without mishap to the
  back of the house. Here they busied themselves collecting papers and bits of
  wood which, under the direction of Hal, the two-way fireman, they piled up in
  a corner of the back veranda.</p>

  <p>"That should be enough to burn my house up," observed Mr. Gibbs, "not to
  mention my family."</p>

  <p>The Major produced a box of matches, and soon the fire was merrily
  burning. Mr. Gibbs considered the blaze for a moment, then disgustedly
  snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"There's been a mistake," he announced. "We've set fire to the wrong
  house. This one isn't mine."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know your own home?" demanded Rex Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," explained Mr. Gibbs, "I live in the front of mine. Rarely
  get round to the back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said Mr. Pebble. "That does make things different. What shall
  we do now?"</p>

  <p>"We might put this fire out," replied Mr. Gibbs, "and then go over to my
  place. It's just next door. Or we might burn them both down. What do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Major Jaffey, "that it's high time we were shoving off. It
  wouldn't look well for us to be seen setting fire to the house of perfect
  strangers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know these people," declared Mr. Gibbs. "They are good friends of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"You mean," put in Spray, "they were good friends of yours. I agree with
  Daddy for a change. Let's clear out."</p>

  <p>"Wait a sec," said Mr. Gibbs. "I'd better let these people know their
  house is burning up, or they might burn up with it."</p>

  <p>With this he started shouting in a loud voice and kept it up until a
  window flew open and a bald head was thrust out into the night. Mr. Pebble
  and his companions crept shyly out of sight behind some bushes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, Gibbs," said the owner of the bald head. "Drunk as usual.
  What have you done this time&mdash;set fire to my house?"</p>

  <p>"My mistake, Charlie," replied Gibbs. "I thought this house was mine.
  Sorry."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Charlie, looking down at the blaze. "This isn't your house.
  Yours is next door. I've been living here for quite some time."</p>

  <p>"Sure you have, Charlie," laughed Mr. Gibbs. "As if I didn't know
  that."</p>

  <p>"But you didn't know it," said Charlie. "You just admitted you
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"Not in the dark," explained Mr. Gibbs, "but now that it's burning down I
  recognize it distinctly. This is your house, Charlie, and I set fire to it.
  How am I ever going to make it up to you? Shall I set mine on fire,
  Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Charlie generously. "Don't do anything rash. Let me set it
  on fire for you."</p>

  <p>"That's fair, Charlie," said Mr. Gibbs with every indication of sincere
  gratitude. "That's what I call meeting me more than halfway. But hadn't you
  better wake your folks up first? A spark might blow in, you know, and ignite
  one of them."</p>

  <p>"I hope a spark ignites them all," declared Charlie with surprising
  ferocity. "If it did, I might be able to enjoy a little peace at home."</p>

  <p>"But not if your home burns down," Mr. Gibbs re-minded him. "Not then,
  Charlie, because if your house burns down you won't have any home in which to
  enjoy your peace."</p>

  <p>"That's well taken," said Charlie. "I'll be right down to help you put out
  this fire; then we'll see how your house burns."</p>

  <p>Charlie's bald head was withdrawn from the night, and in a surprisingly
  short time the man appeared on the back veranda.</p>

  <p>"It's a good fire," commented Mr. Gibbs modestly.</p>

  <p>"Much too good for this house," replied Charlie. "A fire like that
  deserves far better material&mdash;something more institutional and centrally
  located. What's bad for fires?"</p>

  <p>"Water," suggested Mr. Gibbs.</p>

  <p>"I know," said the other impatiently, "but that's so old-fashioned.
  Couldn't we think up a new way?"</p>

  <p>"You know something," said Mr. Pebble in a low voice to Spray. "The way
  they go on is almost making me sober. We've been listening to a conversation
  either between two exceedingly courteous lunatics or else two quietly
  plastered gentlemen with a quaint sense of fun."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they're drunk and insane too," suggested Spray. "These
  thoroughbred families can throw off some rare progeny every now and then.
  Let's clear out of this. We're really quite harmless compared with them."</p>

  <p>But before they crept away through the shadows the members of the party
  were privileged to catch a last snatch of conversation between the two
  gentlemen.</p>

  <p>"It entirely slipped my mind," Mr. Gibbs was saying. "Only a short time
  ago I invited a number of half-naked persons to take part in this fire. They
  had a dandy hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad," was Charlie's sympathetic reply.</p>

  <p>"They must have gone to some other house. I've had a swell hook and ladder
  up in the attic for years. Got it on my seventh birthday. Only trouble is,
  two wheels are missing and it hasn't any ladders."</p>

  <p>"And anyway," said Mr. Gibbs, "it wouldn't be quite large enough. This
  fire's getting taller all the time."</p>

  <p>"They do," observed Charlie wisely, "until they go out."</p>

  <p>"That tears it!" exclaimed Spray. "Let's hurry. Those two men are as mad
  as a couple of hatters."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pebble never did learn what the two gentlemen did with their fire. The
  amazing events of that evening and of many subsequent ones fully occupied his
  mind. In later years, however, he occasionally found himself wondering
  whether Mr. Gibbs and his friend Charlie were really as mad as they seemed or
  were merely passing the time away in idle banter. Probably he could have
  found out had he cared to, but it was one of those piquant little problems he
  preferred to leave unsolved. As it was, Rex Pebble learned far too many of
  the truths of life to make it a going concern. However, he succeeded in
  disguising this knowledge to himself as well as to others&mdash;that is, most
  of the time he did.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">8. THE LOWER HALF'S A LADY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It has been almost definitely established that no one hook
  and ladder ever succeeded in making more of a nuisance of itself than did the
  one so casually borrowed by Rex Pebble and his party.</p>

  <p>After its departure from the slightly burning residence of Charlie, the
  various stages of its progress were reported more or less hysterically by
  outraged property owners of the surrounding community telephoning in to
  police headquarters.</p>

  <p>The eccentric behavior of the hook and ladder could be attributed to
  several causes, all of which militated against the safety and best interests
  of those riding upon it as well as those innocent citizens who were so
  unfortunate as to have anything at all to do with it. Unfamiliarity with the
  operation of the attenuated vehicle was one of the main causes. Another one
  could be reasonably said to be the artificially stimulated condition of the
  members of its crew. A steady flow of gratuitous and irresponsible advice
  added to the general confusion, but by far the most influential factor was
  the preoccupied state of Rex Pebble's mind.</p>

  <p>His thoughts still lingered with those two strange beings, Charlie and Mr.
  Gibbs. He was considerably puzzled by their philosophically discursive
  reactions to a deliberate act of incendiarism, which even at that moment was
  threatening the safety of one of their homes. Mingled with his doubts and
  speculations was a definite element of envy. Never before had Mr. Pebble
  encountered anyone outside of an institution whose conduct had been more
  calmly and consistently unbalanced than his own when once he had set his mind
  on it. If possible, he decided, those two gentlemen were even madder than
  Nokashima, and to Rex Pebble's way of thinking such a triumph of madness was
  well-nigh inconceivable. Therefore, with all these thoughts racing through
  his mind, there is small wonder that he drove the machine through the streets
  of that thriving surburban community with the capricious abandon of an
  enterprising child playing in a crowded room with an overgrown toy.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Sergeant," a voice said over the telephone about ten minutes after
  the Pebble party had taken leave of Charlie and Mr. Gibbs, "a hook and ladder
  has just driven through my dog house."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" muttered the somnolent policeman. "This isn't a dog house. It's
  worse. This is a police station."</p>

  <p>"I know," came the patient reply. "This isn't a dog talking. I'm an owner,
  and I'm talking for my dog. A hook and ladder has just driven through his
  house."</p>

  <p>"What's the dog doing now?" asked the sergeant, realizing something was
  expected of him.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" demanded the voice. "But if you must know, the damn fool
  is sitting on the boards, and they're all full of nails."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you whistle?" suggested the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Why should I whistle?" asked the voice. "I don't feel like
  whistling."</p>

  <p>"I mean," said the officer heavily, "why don't you whistle to the
  dog?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," replied the voice, "I see. Wait a moment." A shrill noise offended
  the sergeant's ears. "He won't come," the voice resumed in tones of
  discouragement. "Not a budge out of him. He looks sore as hell."</p>

  <p>"He'll budge all right," said the officer, knowledgeably, "if he sits on
  one of those nails."</p>

  <p>"Say, officer," continued the voice, "let's waive the dog for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Don't see what good that's going to do," grumbled the sergeant. "It
  certainly won't help the dog any to go waving him about. He'd hate it more
  than sitting on a nail."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean to wave the dog like a flag," protested the voice. "I mean,
  let's drop the dog."</p>

  <p>"If you want to drop your dog," said the sergeant impatiently, "go right
  ahead and do it, but damn me if I'm going to help you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to help me drop my dog," said the voice wearily. "I
  don't want you to do anything. Just hang up quietly and try to forget the
  whole unpleasant incident. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>A vicious banging of the telephone on the other end of the line emphasized
  to the sergeant the speaker's desire to have nothing more to do with him. He
  was still puzzled some minutes later when the telephone rang again.</p>

  <p>"Officer," cried an excited voice, "there's a hook and ladder full of
  murderers on my lawn."</p>

  <p>"Funny place for a lot of murderers to be," commented the officer. "What
  are they doing on a hook and ladder?"</p>

  <p>"It's what they are doing on my lawn that's burning me up," said the
  voice. "They're shouting and singing and flinging themselves about. You
  should see them."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see them," the sergeant answered truthfully. "But somehow
  that doesn't seem to be the way murderers are supposed to act."</p>

  <p>"How are they supposed to act?" asked the voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," the sergeant hedged. "Different ways, but they don't
  shout and sing and fling themselves about. Not murderers."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they do after they've committed a pretty good murder," replied the
  voice. "Might make them sort of happy like."</p>

  <p>"Murderers are never happy," said the sergeant, who had never seen one.
  "They slink along carrying blunt instruments."</p>

  <p>"How awful of them," replied the voice admiringly. "Would you mind telling
  me if you happen to be a murderer?"</p>

  <p>"I would be one, if you were here," snapped the exasperated policeman.</p>

  <p>"You talk just like a murderer," went on the voice. "I mean, you seem to
  be so thoroughly familiar with their nasty ways&mdash;just how they walk and
  what they carry. It's wonderful. How about the murderers on my lawn? Do you
  want to come up and give them a little talk? I want to go to sleep."</p>

  <p>"No!" shouted the sergeant. "Go out and throw yourself into their midst. I
  hope they cut you to ribbons."</p>

  <p>"But, officer," objected the voice, "how could they, with a blunt
  instrument?"</p>

  <p>This time it was the sergeant who viciously snapped down the earpiece.
  Before he had time even to think about cooling off, the bell once more
  chattered irritably in his flushed face. Seizing the telephone round the neck
  as if he were going to throttle it, he shoved the receiver against his ear
  with such force that he cursed bitterly into the mouthpiece.</p>

  <p>"Damn it to hell!" he said.</p>

  <p>"No," a timid voice faltered. "I don't want any of that. I want the police
  station."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the officer, "this is the police station. You're talking to
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say," remarked the lady, "it doesn't talk like a police
  station. I mean to say, a police station shouldn't talk like that. Are you
  very busy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," replied the sergeant with ponderous sarcasm. "Do you want
  me to come up and see you some time? Or would you rather bring your tatting
  down here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see you at any time," declared the voice decidedly. "I
  want to see a gentleman. A face just looked in at my window."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, a face looked in at your window?" demanded the officer.
  "Didn't it have any body?"</p>

  <p>"Not at first it didn't," said the lady. "It was just a face, and it had
  queer little slanty eyes, and skin like an old, dried orange."</p>

  <p>"What did it see?" asked the sergeant, growing interested.</p>

  <p>"It saw me," said the lady. "And it spoke."</p>

  <p>"It did?" replied the officer. "What did it say, lady?"</p>

  <p>"Must I tell?" faltered the voice. "Must I?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," snapped the sergeant. "That's important."</p>

  <p>"Well, officer," said the lady slowly, "this slanty-eyed little face said
  in the strangest voice, 'Night keep up all naked. This pretty good stuff.'
  That's what it said, officer."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you pull the shade down?" asked the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"I was too busy crouching," replied the lady. "I got all scroggled
  up."</p>

  <p>"You got all what, lady?" asked the sergeant in a shocked voice. "That
  sounds bad."</p>

  <p>"Well, it wasn't any laughing matter," said the lady, "but it wasn't as
  bad as that. I got all scroggled up, you know&mdash;bent double and
  everything. And the face just giggled. 'He-he-he,' it went, just like
  that."</p>

  <p>"Don't do it any more, lady," pleaded the sergeant. "It sounded awful at
  this end."</p>

  <p>"It sounded even worse here," said the lady. "I'm way up on the sixth
  floor."</p>

  <p>"I see it all, lady," replied the officer. "Don't worry your head any
  more. It must have been a bird. No one man is twelve stories high."</p>

  <p>"No, officer," stated the lady most emphatically, "I know that. No one man
  is twelve stories high in his bare feet, but this man was standing on a
  ladder. I saw his body."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he even dressed?" asked the officer in a hoarse voice. "You really
  saw his body?"</p>

  <p>"You're getting all mixed up," complained the lady.</p>

  <p>"I was the one who wasn't dressed, but the man was. He had on pants and a
  white jacket."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," breathed the sergeant. "Are you dressed now,
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know for?" the voice asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Not for fun," replied the officer. "Suppose I send some of the boys
  along?"</p>

  <p>"No," declared the voice, "don't send any boys. I want this handled by
  men."</p>

  <p>The sergeant almost choked.</p>

  <p>"What do you want handled by men?" he whispered over the wire.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" the voice demanded snappily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, lady," he replied helplessly, "but please don't say
  anything you wouldn't like used as evidence. Let's get back to your story.
  What happened next?"</p>

  <p>"Well," the voice replied, "nothing much happened. I just stood there
  scroggling&mdash;bent double, you know&mdash;and those slanty eyes in that
  yellow face kept blinking at me like two jumping beans. 'You should see
  boss,' he said. 'Boss plenty naked, too. Only tablecloth. But he not have
  pain in belly. I go get.' Then &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have you a pain in your belly, madam?" asked the sergeant, growing a
  little tired. "I mean stomach," he added hastily.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the voice quite cheerfully, "but that funny little yellow
  face made the same mistake, too. I'm all right."</p>

  <p>"Good," said the sergeant, wishing the woman was in convulsions. "If you
  don't mind, will you please finish your story? I might have a murder or
  something at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't have a murder, sergeant," admonished the woman. "Try counting
  up to one hundred. Well, as I was saying, the yellow face disappeared, and
  before I had time to snatch a robe another one popped up in its place."</p>

  <p>"Another yellow face?" gasped the officer. "Sure it wasn't the same one
  back?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the back of the same yellow face?" came the voice.</p>

  <p>"No, no, lady," said the officer, "I don't mean that. God!" he cried out
  in an exasperated aside, "this woman is worse than Gracie Allen."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," retorted the woman. "I've heard her too, and she's ever so
  much worse than I am."</p>

  <p>"All right, lady," agreed the sergeant. "Tell me the end of your
  story?"</p>

  <p>"This new face was much better than the yellow one," the voice resumed. "A
  great improvement. In fact, it was a real nice face. Splendid eyes. I could
  feel myself getting red."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean, lady?" asked the officer, hopelessly confused. "Where
  were you turning red?"</p>

  <p>"All over," said the lady.</p>

  <p>"All over?" the man slowly repeated. "Oh, I think I see. You were
  blushing, eh? Well, that was quite a blush, lady. Lots of ground to cover.
  Between yellow faces and red bodies I don't know where I'm standing. Kindly
  state only the important facts."</p>

  <p>"This new face spoke English," the woman continued. "'Do you want to be
  saved?' it asked. 'What for?' I asked right back. 'I'm not so bad.' 'I should
  say not,' replied the face, but I wasn't having any of that, so I said, 'And
  furthermore, mister, this is no time and place to start preaching sermons to
  a lady.' 'No harm in asking,' he answered, 'but if I stay here much longer
  I'll be needing a little saving myself.' What do you think he meant by that,
  officer?"</p>

  <p>"He probably wanted to strangle you to death," grated the officer,
  momentarily losing control of himself. "Sorry, lady. Is that face still
  there?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the voice sadly, "but I don't think it wanted to strangle me.
  It didn't look like the face of a murderer. It isn't here any more, and when
  I looked out the window I saw a naked man in a towel chasing a hook and
  ladder down the street. I saw everything distinctly. The little man in the
  white jacket and yellow face was driving like mad. I couldn't have driven
  worse myself. And that's all I know, officer. Will you send some of your men
  around? I'm all upset."</p>

  <p>"Me, too, lady," shrilled the sergeant, a maniacal light in his eyes.
  "I'll send around the firing squad."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better send that hook and ladder smack back with it," said the
  voice of the woman. "To put out the fire, you know."</p>

  <p>Slowly and with the utmost care the sergeant lowered the receiver on its
  hook. He was too consumed with brute passion, too straining with evil intent,
  to trust himself to express his emotions either in word or deed.</p>

  <p>The next time the telephone rang he turned the call over to a sleepy-eyed
  rookie.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Pat!" called the sergeant with hypocritical heartiness. "Snap out of
  that chair and I'll give you a chance to take a call. It's a good thing to
  get the hang of. There's a knack in it."</p>

  <p>Feeling as highly favored as his sluggard wits would over allow to him,
  the heavy-footed young son of Erin lumbered over to the telephone and made
  his hands into fists virtually all over it.</p>

  <p>"Fine, Chief," he said gratefully. "This will do me good." Thrusting his
  mouth into the transmitter he began to do himself good at the top of his
  lungs. "Hello! Hello!" said Pat excitedly. "This is Murphy of the police
  force talking. Who are you?" A sudden pause. "Oh," he began again. "It's a
  drunken hook and ladder, did you say?" Another pause while Pat more deeply
  entrenched his ear. Then, "Hold the line, mister." Turning to the sergeant,
  Pat tried to impart his information. "It seems, Chief," he said, "that this
  guy has been dodging either a drunken hook and ladder or a hook and ladder
  driven by drunkards or maniacs escaped from the asylum. What shall I tell
  him?"</p>

  <p>"That hook and ladder is going to drive me into my grave!" groaned the
  sergeant.</p>

  <p>"That's what it's nearly done to this man," said Pat. "He says he can't
  keep up dodging it much longer. He's fair exhausted from being pursued by the
  hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>"Ask him where it is," commanded the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Where is this hook and ladder?" Pat asked over the wire, then waited to
  be told. "Hang on," he said, and again turned to his superior. "I thought
  this was going to do me good," he complained, "but damned if I believe it
  will. Do all people go crazy when they telephone to us?"</p>

  <p>"This is no time for idle questions," said the sergeant tartly. "I don't
  care whether or not it does you any good. That damn telephone has almost
  ruined me already. Where did the guy say it was?"</p>

  <p>"He said it was all over," Pat replied. "Sometimes here and sometimes
  there. It sort of appears from all directions, then goes bounding in pursuit
  of him, no less."</p>

  <p>"That guy must be drunk himself," muttered the sergeant. "A hook and
  ladder can't appear from all directions. Ask him if he is."</p>

  <p>"Are you drunk, mister?" asked Pat of the man at the other end of the
  wire, then quickly removed the receiver from his ear. Even the sergeant,
  standing several feet away, could hear the incoherent protests tumbling from
  the mouth of the telephone. "He says he isn't, Chief," said Pat at last. "He
  seems to be sure about it. He says he is a public-spirited citizen, and
  unless something is done about that hook and ladder he is going to report the
  entire force. Do you want to talk to him? I'm dead certain this isn't going
  to do me any good at all."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid to talk to the man?" demanded the sergeant. "You started
  the conversation, go on and finish it."</p>

  <p>"What shall I say now?"</p>

  <p>"Ask him where he is&mdash;if he won't tell us where that hook and ladder
  is," replied the chief. "String him along somehow. Maybe he'll forget about
  it or the thing will go away."</p>

  <p>"A bounding hook and ladder filled with maniacs would be a hard thing to
  forget," commented Pat, looking with distaste at the telephone. "All right,
  Chief. I'll take another chance." Once more he hid as much of his mouth as
  possible in the telephone and shouted what he hoped would be soothing words
  to the infuriated citizen at the other end. "Don't be like that, mister,"
  said Pat. "We didn't mean it. The chief was just having some fun." Pause.
  "Oh, you're glad to know the chief is enjoying himself." Here Pat turned to
  the sergeant. "The guy says he's glad you're having a good time," he told his
  superior. "Says he wishes you were down there where he is."</p>

  <p>"I heard! I heard!" cried the sergeant irritably. "Leave my name out of
  it. Ask him where he is."</p>

  <p>After Pat had complied with this request he listened for a long time to
  the voice at the other end of the wire, an expression of profound
  astonishment on his face.</p>

  <p>"What!" the sergeant heard him exclaim. "There's a woman on the hook and
  ladder? Yeah? Oh, half fireman and half woman, you say. Now, mister, how can
  that be? Hold on! I'm not calling you a liar. Sure, I know. Certainly. You
  can tell half of a woman when you see one. I never saw one that way. Of
  course, you're no baby. You could tell even less of a woman than that. Wait a
  minute. The chief ought to hear this." With wide blue eyes Pat stared his
  incredulity at the sergeant. "Golly," he said, "something's funny somewhere.
  I'm almost afraid to tell you what that guy told me. Shall I?"</p>

  <p>"Go on!" cried the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Pat in a hushed voice, "he says there's a thing scrambling
  around that hook and ladder that's half fireman and half lady, and he claims
  the men are maniacs.</p>

  <p>"Ask him which half is which," said the chief in a dead voice.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I should?" asked Pat a little slyly. "I should think either
  half of a woman or a fireman scrambling over a hook and ladder would be
  enough to upset anybody. And when it comes to a half of each crawling after
  one another&mdash;my eye! I don't like to think about it."</p>

  <p>"Go on and do as I say," said the chief. "It's important."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Pat.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got sense enough to know that there's a lot of difference
  between the two halves of a woman?"</p>

  <p>"I know there is," replied Pat, "but I don't see what good either half is
  going to do us now. Whatever half it is, the other one's a fireman, and
  that's not so good."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to get at?" the sergeant demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," Pat hastened to assure him. "I certainly don't want to
  get at that monster, no matter which half is which. Let's hang up,
  Chief."</p>

  <p>"Go on and ask that question," commanded the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Listen, mister," said Pat diffidently. "The chief wants to know which
  half of the thing is which, a woman or a fireman?" As he listened his face
  grew pink. Finally he put his hand over the mouthpiece and addressed himself
  to the impatient sergeant. "It's the bottom half," said Pat in a hushed
  voice.</p>

  <p>"The bottom half is which?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"The bottom half is all lady," replied Pat. "Think of it, Chief, think of
  it. And on top there's a fireman. What a sight that must be!"</p>

  <p>"It's as I thought," muttered the sergeant. "No wonder those men are
  maniacs. Did he say where this hook and ladder was?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere around Main and Spruce," replied Pat, "It's playing all
  about."</p>

  <p>"Hey, boys!" the sergeant shouted with sudden decision in his voice.
  "Murphy, O'Brien, Samuels, and Schmidt, line up, the four of you." When the
  boys, languidly buttoning their tunics, were standing in front of the desk,
  the sergeant snapped out his instructions. "There's a wild hook and ladder
  raising hell all over this town. God only knows what it will do next. Go down
  to Main and Spruce and pick up the trail and &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you want us to shadow the thing?" Officer Samuels asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" exploded the sergeant. "I want you to arrest that hook
  and ladder and drag back here either dead or alive. And everybody on it," he
  added.</p>

  <p>"What about the half and half ?" inquired Pat. "Shall we treat the thing
  as a lady or a fireman?"</p>

  <p>"That depends upon which half gives you the most trouble," replied the
  chief.</p>

  <p>"I don't like any part of the unholy body," answered Pat.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to like it," the sergeant retorted, "Policemen ain't
  supposed to fall all over the people they arrest."</p>

  <p>"Gord!" ejaculated Pat. "I wouldn't fall all over that thing if my life
  depended on it"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a thing is it?" asked Officer O'Brien.</p>

  <p>"It's a thing," Pat Murphy explained, that's one half fireman and another
  half woman."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" said O'Brien. "Who do you you think you're kidding? Which half is
  a woman?"</p>

  <p>"The bottom half," said Pat.</p>

  <p>"And how far up does it go?" asked Schmidt.</p>

  <p>"That's none of your business," put in the Chief. "You clear out of here
  and bring both halves back."</p>

  <p>"Divs on the south end," said Samuels as the policemen filed from the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome to both ends of it," Pat Murphy told him.</p>

  <p>The telephone tinkled merrily. Before he settled back in his chair the
  sergeant gently removed the receiver and placed it on the desk. Then he
  lighted a fat, black cigar and sighed a long pull of smoke into the still
  air. He had done his duty. Now he would rest and relax. He was still doing
  this when the head of the Fire Department strode in.</p>

  <p>"I've lost my hook and ladder," he announced.</p>

  <p>"You have?" said the sergeant mildly. "Well, that's just too bad. Every
  member of the community has found that hook and ladder with the exception of
  yourself. And," he added with swelling bitterness, "if you ever get the damn
  thing back, I hope to God you'll never let it out of your sight again. I'm
  dog tired of your hook and ladder."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"Listen," replied the sergeant. "Have you a number on your force that's
  half fireman and half woman?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," said the owner of the lost hook
  and ladder. "Have you gone crazy?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied the sergeant quietly. "Stark, staring mad. Listen some
  more, Commissioner."</p>

  <p>Then the sergeant told him all. And when he had finished, the Commissioner
  was just human enough to want. to know which half was which.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were going to ask that question," the sergeant replied
  sorrowfully. "Commissioner, the lower half's a lady."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">9. CROWN'S COSMOPOLITAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, Mr. Pebble and party were steadfastly trying to
  mind their own business with a discouraging lack of success. For once in a
  blue moon the telephone reports of eyewitnesses had been substantially
  accurate, if a trifle irrelevant. One might even say those reports had been
  misleadingly conservative. No mention had been made of the incident of the
  demolished hothouse or of the mutilated ninth green on the local golf course.
  Also, several twisted lamp posts seem to have passed unnoticed. The desperate
  struggle caused by Nokashima inadvertently starting the hook and ladder
  during the temporary absence of Rex Pebble never became public knowledge,
  although it was long remembered by those directly concerned. Hal, the only
  professional present, was by far the most unhappy. He was firmly convinced he
  had lost not only his livelihood but also the need of having one, inasmuch as
  he would soon be losing his life as well. Nokashima's rendition of "The Last
  Round-up" in pidgin English went a long way toward making everything less
  pleasant. The Pebble party was now enjoying a brief breathing spell in a
  dimly lighted alley situated in the heart of the town. On their right rose
  the sheer walls of a large and enterprising department store. Throughout the
  surrounding countryside Crown's Cosmopolitan was jointly famous. No finer
  store existed outside of a large city. On the left of the little group the
  smooth, windowless side of a bank building offered scant hospitality. The end
  of the alley was uncompromisingly blocked by a formidable brick barrier. In
  other words, Rex Pebble and his companions would find themselves in a pretty
  kettle of fish should their present whereabouts be discovered by Pat Murphy
  and the rest of the boys. However, for a moment or so their peace remained
  undisturbed.</p>

  <p>"It's pleasant here," Mr. Pebble observed. "A good place to stretch one's
  legs before hurtling forth on another spin."</p>

  <p>My legs stretched from ear to ear already," Nokashima declared. "That seat
  too high for short Japanese body to attend pedals. Feet dangle on way."</p>

  <p>"And if you try to monkey with the hook and ladder a second short Japanese
  body will be dangling at yellow end of a rope."</p>

  <p>"Speaking of necks," remarked Major Jaffey, gently fingering his own,
  "mine has not settled back to its former position since that short Japanese
  body in question dangled on the end of my legs."</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette, Major," said Spray Summers, "I'm dying for a
  smoke."</p>

  <p>Courteously the Major passed a package of cigarettes among the members of
  the party. Soon five small red sparks were glowing in the darkness. It was
  these indications of life that first attracted the attention of the squad of
  searching policemen.</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Pat in a piercing whisper. "I'll bet they're down there. Be
  careful of an ambush."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" asked Hal in a low voice. "Somebody's betting we're
  down here."</p>

  <p>"Then he wins," commented Rex Pebble. "We are."</p>

  <p>"Not if I know it," flung back Hal. "They're cops, and they're after us.
  Nothing would please them more than to run in a fireman."</p>

  <p>"How to get out?" soliloquized Nokashima in the manner of a Nipponese
  Hamlet. "That plenty vital question."</p>

  <p>"We're not going to get out," said Rex Pebble. "We're going to get up and
  in. Bear a hand there, Hal. We'll raise a couple of ladders and escape
  through the Cosmopolitan. My wife has a charge account there."</p>

  <p>"So have I," observed Spray Summers, "but any judge in his sober senses
  would think it an odd time to be seized with a sudden desire to make use of
  it."</p>

  <p>Disregarding this somewhat depressing observation, the four men busied
  themselves setting up the ladders.</p>

  <p>"Major," commanded Rex Pebble, "you and Hal go up first. Something seems
  to tell me that you are not without experience in the art of breaking and
  entering. Hal makes a regular business of it. Look lively, both of you. I
  hear the unmistakable sounds of flat feet flapping at our rear."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to flop mine against theirs," grumbled Spray. "What have we
  done? Nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," replied Rex Pebble, "but we've done it so damn
  thoroughly that it will be more than enough to lock us up for life if we
  trust entirely in our innocence."</p>

  <p>"When I go, boss?" Nokashima asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You can nip up at any old time," Mr. Pebble told him. "You're doing me no
  good here."</p>

  <p>And that was exactly what Nokashima did. He nipped up the ladder with the
  agility of a monkey, which he closely resembled.</p>

  <p>"Pist!" came the signal from somewhere in the darkness above their heads.
  "Pist! Pist!"</p>

  <p>"What is it!" asked Mr. Pebble, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p>"Pist!" was all he got for his trouble. "Pist! Hey, pist!
  Pis-s-s-t-t!"</p>

  <p>"Stop it!" exclaimed Spray Summers. "Of all the asinine noises to make.
  And he keeps on doing it. Always makes me think of bum actors in long cloaks
  ducking in and out of the wings. Pist, up there yourself!"</p>

  <p>Nokashima, who had been making no noise at all, evidently believing that
  something was expected of him, ducked his head over his shoulder and peered
  down into the darkness of the alley.</p>

  <p>"Pist, madam!" he offered politely. "Am hell bent on escape. Pist!
  Pist!"</p>

  <p>"Please stop pisting," shouted Rex Pebble. "There's no time for all that.
  It makes us nervous."</p>

  <p>"Holy saints, will you listen to them?" Pat Murphy said to his brother
  officers. "It's lunatics they are. And it only makes the other two nervous.
  I'd get sore as hell."</p>

  <p>Nokashima had disappeared into the blackness of an open window, and Spray
  and Rex Pebble were two thirds the way up by the time Pat and his boys had
  reached the foot of the ladders.</p>

  <p>"Begord, it's true!" explained Pat, looking up at Spray. "It's half
  fireman and half lady."</p>

  <p>"That lower half ain't no fireman," declared Officer Samuels with deep
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"Well, it ain't no lady, either," put in the one called Schmidt. "Even in
  these-days a lady wears a little something."</p>

  <p>"Hey, you in the helmet," shouted Murphy. "Stay where you are. I see
  everything."</p>

  <p>As unconventional as Spray was, this gratuitous information made her feel
  decidedly uncomfortable. Clutching the awkward rubber coat around her, she
  took a quick, strained glance below.</p>

  <p>"If you were a gentleman you'd bow your head," she called down, "and look
  at your ugly feet."</p>

  <p>"And if you were a lady you'd take a pike at something else," retorted
  Pat. "What sort of a thing do you</p>

  <p>happen to be, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you were seeing everything," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," said Officer Samuels. "It's still too dark."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Spray cuttingly, "you should have seen enough from where
  you're standing."</p>

  <p>"I've seen almost too much," admitted Pat Murphy.</p>

  <p>"One can't get enough of a good thing," Spray replied coolly, edging up a
  few more rungs. "That's what I always say."</p>

  <p>"Will you come down, whatever you are?" demanded Pat Murphy.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't," cried Spray. "Will you go away?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come up there and lay hands on you," the exasperated policeman
  shouted.</p>

  <p>"What a man!" she said to Mr. Pebble, perched semi-recumbent on the other
  ladder; then called tauntingly to the men below her, "Is that a threat or a
  promise?"</p>

  <p>"You know," put in Mr. Pebble, "I'm finding it increasingly difficult to
  retain my poise. This ladder sways like a camel's back."</p>

  <p>"I'm finding it damn near impossible to keep my modesty," she retorted,
  "and climb the thing at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Why trouble about modesty now?" he inquired. "After all, it's merely a
  matter of one's point of view." "That's just what I'm worrying about," said
  Spray. "Those coppers down there have the wrong point of view."</p>

  <p>"Pist!" sounded suddenly in the darkness only a few feet away. "Pist!"</p>

  <p>"He's at it again," grumbled Spray. "Will you tell me whether that noise
  is intended to repel or attract? I can't get the idea."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the excitement has driven the Major mad," suggested Mr. Pebble,
  "and he thinks he's playing snake."</p>

  <p>"I wish he'd stop playing it in my ears," she complained. "I'll never get
  up this ladder with all these interruptions."</p>

  <p>"Look out, madam," Nokashima called excitedly from a window. "Officers
  make grade. Snatch at behind."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the startled Spray. "The horrid things! There is no time to
  stand on any further ceremony. Hurry</p>

  <p>up, Rex." Hastily she scrambled up to the window, then added as an
  afterthought as she pulled herself through, "And no matter what those rude
  policemen snatch at, Nokashima, you should endeavor to select your words with
  a little more delicacy. I don't know which is the more objectionable, to be
  snatched at or to be told where."</p>

  <p>"Madam," replied Nokashima pedantically, "there are two behinds. One is
  thing, other is place. I refer to latter."</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," came the earnest but subdued voice of Hal, the renegade
  fireman, "you and that dopey laundryman are going to talk us all into jail if
  you don't dry up."</p>

  <p>"I not wet yet," Nokashima announced proudly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, little Fu Manchu," the fireman retorted. "Those flatties are
  about to chuck their dogs right in those windows. You'd better hide while you
  can."</p>

  <p>"If dogs of flatties smell no better than Mist' Henry," replied the Jap
  complacently, "we remain in obscurity to end of days."</p>

  <p>"Pardon the interruption," spoke up Major Jaffey in a calm, informative
  voice, "but from a brief investigation of our whereabouts I should say we are
  now in the furniture department. There is also a suggestion of toys at the
  far end. It's a jolly place for hiding. God only knows where we'll be
  cuter."</p>

  <p>"Fine!" exclaimed Spray. "Lead me to a bed."</p>

  <p>"Hot invitation, that," observed the voice of Nokashima. "Who you ask,
  madam?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody hit that Jap," said Spray. "He's gone bad on our hands."</p>

  <p>"Am on hands and upper joint of legs," the loquacious little yellow man
  informed them. "Like missionary fella, I progress amid encircling gloom."</p>

  <p>"What's that!" exclaimed Spray as a violent commotion broke out near the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Flatties chucking in dogs," hazarded Nokashima,</p>

  <p>"Dogs not amused, nor this wormlike son of honorable house. In silence I
  seek a huddle."</p>

  <p>From the moment the little yellow man set forth to seek a huddle that
  floor of Crown's Cosmopolitan became the center of dark confusion,
  occasionally relieved by the flashing of electric torches, the flame of a
  match and the momentary switching on of overhead lights. Cries of
  consternation echoed through the vast department. There were the sounds of
  running feet, of pursuing grunts, of painful collisions with unseen objects,
  of unexpected giggles and scattered conversation. There were shouts of
  surprise and mortification and some of mortal fear. It was no floor at all
  for nervous people, yet every person on it was more or less that way. It is
  almost safe to say that no group of frenzied bargain hunters on sales day
  ever conducted themselves on that floor as unbecomingly as did the police and
  the Pebble party.</p>

  <p>The opening signal of distress came from Spray Summers, who had
  thoughtlessly concealed herself in the first bed she could find. Her fool's
  paradise was suddenly and rudely shattered by the frantic arrival of two
  unknown figures caroming off her body from two different directions. They
  were received with a grunt of anguish which was the best the lady could offer
  at the moment. Painfully she reached out her left hand and felt a small
  semi-human face; then her fingers slipped down to the fabric of a starched
  jacket.</p>

  <p>"Not that, madam," Nokashima whispered tragically. "Not that! If do I push
  loud cries like Fifi."</p>

  <p>"You snake in the grass," gritted Spray. "Do you realize you're in bed
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Realization almost stupefying," breathed the little servant. "I feel just
  like it"</p>

  <p>"You do?" Spray whispered. "Take this, then, and tell me what you feel
  like."</p>

  <p>"Hardly can," gasped Nokashima, taking what Spray had given him in the pit
  of his stomach. "I feel like small cherry blossom beneath foot of great
  giant."</p>

  <p>"This is no time to be talking about cherries," retorted Spray.</p>

  <p>"Cherries my dish," the little man informed her. "I go mad for
  cherries."</p>

  <p>"You've gone mad without them," Spray told him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," he admitted. "That why I go mad."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, small ounce of vileness, what a liberty you've
  taken?"</p>

  <p>"If not take some liberty here," declared Nocka, "I lose all liberty to
  dogs of flatties. Where are flatties' dogs, madam? I hear no sniff-sniff nor
  patter of bounding feet."</p>

  <p>"One can't hear anything above the roar of those policemen," replied
  Spray. "Do you happen to know who belongs to this other body beside me?"</p>

  <p>"Only vague surmise," admitted Nokashima. "Madam may have caught cowardly
  flattie. Squeeze down on neck. Maybe he turn to fox."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be in bed with a fox," declared Spray. "You're bad
  enough."</p>

  <p>"If I turn into fox," mused Nokashima, "I lure dogs on pursuit of untamed
  goose, then I go home and. offer myself to nose of Mist' Henry. If he no
  smell, my broom droop with deep despond."</p>

  <p>"Not broom," Spray corrected. "You mean your brush."</p>

  <p>"Is that what I have, madam, if I turn to fox? Brush on the end of me. How
  nice."</p>

  <p>"How awful," murmured Spray Summers. "Please be quiet, snake in the
  grass."</p>

  <p>"One more thing done," the little servant pleaded. "I not snake in grass,
  madam. I not even so funny as fox. Just small little Japanese feller in bed
  with lady and unknown body, and contorted with alarm."</p>

  <p>"I'm not altogether easy in my mind myself."</p>

  <p>"Why not tentatively finger opposite body?" the yellow one inquired.
  "Maybe encounter familiar object."</p>

  <p>In spite of herself, Spray laughed.</p>

  <p>"What a fool you are, Nocka," she said, then turned to the other object
  behind her. "Who are you?" she demanded sharply. "Speak up!"</p>

  <p>"Pist!" came so suddenly and explosively from the unknown body on her
  right that she jumped almost a foot from the bed. While she was up Nokashima
  frantically burrowed under her. When she settled back she felt very much like
  a person who had unexpectedly sat on a cat.</p>

  <p>"Pist!" once more popped irritably from the man beside her. "Pist!"</p>

  <p>"Unidentified must have been restraining those for long time," observed
  Nokashima in a muffled voice. "Your body, madam, is mutilating too many of my
  parts."</p>

  <p>"And this body over here has got me completely baffled," replied Spray. "I
  don't know how to open a conversation with it if it keeps on making those
  noises."</p>

  <p>"Pist!" uttered the body.</p>

  <p>"Will you stop doing that!" cried Spray, blindly cuffing the body in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>The pist was promptly turned to a grunt.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," expostulated the voice of Major Jaffey. "Never do that
  again. As it is, I doubt if it will be necessary. You should have better
  sense."</p>

  <p>At this moment a light flashed blindingly in the eyes of the three
  occupants of the bed, and the voice of Pat Murphy cried loudly, "Here they
  are, boys! I've got 'em!"</p>

  <p>From all parts of the floor heavy feet came crashing towards the center of
  attraction. The bodies on either side of Spray Summers were galvanized into
  desperate action as they melted into the darkness, their eager feet adding to
  the general din and confusion. Cursing all Japanese and majors from the
  bottom of her heart, Spray remained behind, struggling in the grasp of Pat
  Murphy. That lusty limb of the law unceremoniously dragged the furious woman
  from the bed, dropping his torch in so doing, then, with no definite object
  in mind, hurtled her along the floor.</p>

  <p>"Say, Pat!" shouted a voice. "Where are you now, man? Is the lower half a
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't been able to find hide nor hair of a fireman yet," Pat called
  back. "It seems to be all lady."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't look any farther," Spray protested. "You're here to do your
  duty, not to amuse yourself."</p>

  <p>"If you'd only tell me whether you're a lady or not," the policeman
  panted. "I might know what to do with you."</p>

  <p>"And what would that be, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Don't exactly know," said Pat, "but I wouldn't handle you so rough,
  maybe."</p>

  <p>A body collided violently with the woman as a fresh pair of hands took
  hold of her.</p>

  <p>"I'm with you, Pat," said the newcomer. "Which half do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Will you two men stop trying arbitrarily to divide me," protested Spray.
  "I'm one continuous body, and if there's any fireman about me I have yet to
  find it out."</p>

  <p>"You mean, you're all lady?" breathed Pat.</p>

  <p>"From head to toe," said Spray.</p>

  <p>"The sergeant said you were some fireman, lady," said the other voice in
  disappointed tones.</p>

  <p>"Well, you tell the sergeant," she retorted, "that I'm not going to switch
  my body about just to please him. Where are we going, anyway? Are we just
  taking a walk in the dark?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know, lady," Pat Murphy replied. "Haven't had time to think.
  Hey, boys!" he shouted suddenly."Round up the rest of the gang. We've got one
  of them. Dig the others out."</p>

  <p>From somewhere in the darkness came the quavering notes of "The Last
  Round-up." Nocka was at it again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where I've hidden myself," a voice complained, "much less
  where the rest of 'em are."</p>

  <p>"Holy Saints!" breathed Pat. "What an awful sound! It's like a ghost
  wailing for its lost soul."</p>

  <p>Spray felt herself suddenly seized from the rear and plucked from the
  grasp of her two astonished captors. She was dragged through an aperture, and
  a door slammed behind her.</p>

  <p>"Who's got me now?" she inquired pessimistically. "Not that it makes much
  difference."</p>

  <p>"You're in the model home," whispered the voice of Rex Pebble. "This is
  the bathroom."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," said Spray. "How is it under the shower?"</p>

  <p>"A bit stuffy," replied Rex Pebble, "but at least it's quiet and
  exclusive. You're a public scandal." -</p>

  <p>"I'd be all of that," she admitted, "if I had a public."</p>

  <p>"I say, old darling," asked Mr. Pebble conversationally from the shower,
  "doesn't this strike you as being rather an odd way to be spending the first
  night of our new lives?"</p>

  <p>"It does. It does," she assured him. "It's one hell of a quaint way to be
  spending the first night of a new life or an old one. But we don't seem to
  learn any better."</p>

  <p>"And," observed Mr. Pebble, "if those policemen have their way with us
  we'll be spending the last night of our new lives locked in the arms of the
  law."</p>

  <p>"I've been locked in those arms already," said Spray.</p>

  <p>"And you'd be locked in them still," Rex Pebble assured her, "had I known
  what use you were going to make of your freedom."</p>

  <p>While this reunion of souls was progressing, Nokashima, that prince of
  Japanese house boys, had found his way by nervous fit after frantic start
  into the toy department, which was situated at the rear of the floor. Here it
  was his momentary bad luck to encounter the papier-maché head of an
  exceedingly dashing-looking lion, glorying in a pair of great malevolent eyes
  and a mane of tremendous vitality. It was a trying moment for the already
  hard-pushed little man. Although darkness saved him from savoring the full
  horror of the object con-fronting him, those parts of it which his groping
  hands had felt were more than enough to convince him he was standing unarmed
  in the presence of a deadly peril&mdash;possibly one of those dogs of the
  flatties, a strong, silent dog. Fortunately for himself as well as for others
  the little yellow man was too overcome by his emotions to push even so much
  as a squawk. Too terrified either to retreat or to advance, he remained
  static in the darkness, shuddering in all his Oriental limbs.</p>

  <p>However, as time passed and no overtures of a hostile nature were
  manifested by the deadly peril, the inordinate curiosity which had made
  Nocka's life one continuous calamity reasserted itself to such an extent that
  before the lapse of many minutes he was cheek and jowl with this effigy of
  the king of the jungle. At last, with some vaguely formulated plan in his
  peculiar little mind, he slipped the head of the lion over his own and went
  circulating aimlessly through the darkness to discover what fate held in
  store for him in his radically altered appearance.</p>

  <p>A short time later Officer Pat Murphy was indelicate enough to switch a
  light on the retreat occupied by Mr. Pebble and his mistress. Officer Pat
  Murphy was thereby a very much startled policeman.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked, for lack of anything better to say.</p>

  <p>"A bathroom," replied Spray, springing up. "What does it look like to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," he answered chidingly, when he had recovered a little from
  the shock of discovery, "you can think of the damnedest things to do when
  you're being chased by the cops. First you go to bed, then you find a
  bathroom. Haven't you got any better sense? This isn't a private home."</p>

  <p>"It's the only private home I've got at the moment," the lady responded.
  "Be so good as to respect its privacy."</p>

  <p>"The devil I will," said Pat. "I'm going to run you in.</p>

  <p>"On what charge, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"On any one of fifty. You and your boy friends too. If I tell the judge
  what I just saw he'll put you away for good."</p>

  <p>"Don't be childish, Pat," replied Spray. "How would you tell the judge
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I'd whisper it to him," said Pat meanly. "In his ear, I would."</p>

  <p>"Oh," retorted Spray, sparring for time. "Not in his eyes, like most
  people."</p>

  <p>"Nobody whispers in other people's eyes," said Pat. "Don't be funny. Come
  on and snap out of this."</p>

  <p>"I like it here," she told him.</p>

  <p>"You certainly made yourself at home," he retorted. "Do you want me to put
  the bracelets on?"</p>

  <p>"Do I have to look pretty to see the judge?"</p>

  <p>"If he sees you the way you are, he's going to look awful," Pat assured
  her. "It might kill the old man." "Then you will be charged with murder," she
  said, "for showing me to the poor old man. Go away now and look for some of
  the boys."</p>

  <p>"I will not," said Pat. "This is the nuttiest place to try to find anyone
  in. What did you want to come up here for?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to go shopping," she answered.</p>

  <p>"You sure do need some clothes," he admitted. "All you've got on is a
  coat, and that isn't yours."</p>

  <p>"How about fixing me up nice for the judge?" suggested Spray. "Slip
  downstairs and grab off a nice dress and a pair of passionate panties." -
  -</p>

  <p>"Lady, you're bad," said Pat. "You shouldn't use such words. You're after
  asking me to compound a felony."</p>

  <p>"You'll be compounding another one if you don't get me some clothes," she
  threatened. "I'm going to take the coat off."</p>

  <p>"Don't, lady," Pat pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Off comes the coat!" cried Spray.</p>

  <p>"Button it up," he urged her. "What will the boys think if they find us
  together like this?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think they'll think?"</p>

  <p>"You know," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I do not," retorted Spray. "I haven't an evil mind. And if I can make
  myself heard above the din the boys are making, I'm going to scream for help.
  Off comes the coat."</p>

  <p>For the salvation of his own soul Pat Murphy sprang through the door and
  began to wrestle with the apparently furious woman. Unseen to the combatants,
  Rex Pebble thrust a curious head through the curtains and peered at the
  active scene, then hurriedly withdrew. To retain his poise he grasped the
  nearest tap, and a vicious deluge of icy water descended on his naked spine.
  A long, shuddering cry issued from the shower. The wrestlers immediately
  released each other and stood regarding the curtain with startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Pat gasped. "It sounded like a poor soul being murdered in
  cold blood."</p>

  <p>"Cold blood it is," complained the shower wetly. "The damn fools didn't
  have to make their confounded shower so all-fired realistic."</p>

  <p>"Turn on the hot," suggested Spray, "and I'll come on in with you. I'm
  getting sick of this dumb policeman."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do that," admonished Murphy in a shocked voice. "You've gone
  far enough, lady. Who's the guy in the shower?"</p>

  <p>"I'm the guy in the shower," the curtains announced. "And you're a gone
  cop. Stand where you are."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Pat.</p>

  <p>"I've got you covered," said the shower.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd cover this lady," the officer answered moodily.</p>

  <p>"Never mind the lady," snapped the shower. "You back out of this
  room."</p>

  <p>At this moment a scream bearing all the earmarks of sincere distress came
  simultaneously from Spray and Pat Murphy. Popping his head through the
  curtains Rex Pebble made a scream of his own. Completely unstrung by this
  reception, Nokashima began to scream too, which made him all the worse. Three
  hurtling bodies bounded over his speedily flattened figure and became wedged
  in the door of the bathroom.</p>

  <p>"Let me outta here!" gasped Murphy. "Holy Saint Patrick, the baleful eyes
  of the beast! Did you see them?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" chattered Spray. "It might understand English."</p>

  <p>"That monster's so awful," declared Pat, "it doesn't understand
  itself."</p>

  <p>"If you two want to stand here and discuss the thing to its face," said
  Rex Pebble, "I don't want to be included. Give me a chance to run."</p>

  <p>"Give me the strength," muttered Spray.</p>

  <p>From all points of the floor lights were flashing on and off, and excited
  voices were bellowing through the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Have you got one, Pat?" a colleague called out.</p>

  <p>"I haven't," he shouted, "but one has almost got me. And what a one it
  is!"</p>

  <p>"You mean the half fireman and half lady?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Pat. "It's half monster and half man. And it's all bad."</p>

  <p>"Then don't arrest it," urged the voice.</p>

  <p>"Arrest it!" cried Pat hysterically. "I'm trying to leave it miles behind.
  The baleful eyes of the beast. Let me through, the both of you."</p>

  <p>As the deadlock was broken, Nokashima, bereft of his lion's head, rose
  from the floor and, still screaming at the top of his lungs, dashed after the
  retreating figures. The fireman known as Hal, on his way to no place in
  particular, spied the abandoned head lying in the light of the bathroom, and
  promptly placing it over his own, ran after Nokashima. Pat Murphy, looking
  back over his shoulder, caught a horrified glimpse of the oncoming
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Begod!" he cried in amazement. "It's grown twice its size."</p>

  <p>Nokashima, far too busy to realize his loss, followed the policeman's
  example, then turned his screams into speech.</p>

  <p>"Dog of flattie," he told an uninterested world, "is fox of evil
  magic."</p>

  <p>"Fox, me eye!" breathed Pat. "Take another look, you runt."</p>

  <p>"Not need another look," Nocka assured him. "Didn't enjoy last. Wait till
  it turns to serpent. Then watch out."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that," Pat scolded, "or I'll lock you up for baiting an
  officer."</p>

  <p>"Please you do," replied Nokashima. "Lock me up from beast of monster when
  sure it not turn to beautiful naked lady. I know Japanese fella &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" gasped Spray. "Would you tell dirty stories in the very jaws of
  death?"</p>

  <p>"Not in jaws," murmured Nokashima. "I want but small how-do-you-do with
  jaws."</p>

  <p>"It will soon be good-bye," said Spray.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the overhead lights flashed up in all parts of the floor. Hal,
  who was passing a mirror at the moment, caught a glimpse of his unamiable
  reflection and jumped two feet from the ground, uttering hoarse cries the
  while.</p>

  <p>"I'm worse than I expected," he mouthed hollowly. "I'm even scared of
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Listen, he admits it," said Spray. "The damned thing's talking to
  itself."</p>

  <p>"It's better than having it screaming at us," observed the philosophical
  Mr. Pebble, clinging to his dripping tablecloth. "Any fair-minded monster
  with eyes in its head would have to admit it isn't a hot number. That thing
  would be silly as hell if it considered itself a bathing beauty."</p>

  <p>"Your sarcasm is about as labored as my legs," retorted Spray. "Heavens!
  What's that?"</p>

  <p>It was the sound of several revolvers all talking at once. From various
  parts of the room excited policemen were taking pot shots at the fleeing
  monster. In self-defense Hal removed the lion's head from his and hurled it
  well before him. Cries of horror and stupefaction broke from all beholders of
  this ghastly act save Nokashima. That one was giggling knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Very funny business, this," he managed to get out. "I fairly stream with
  mirth."</p>

  <p>Spray blinked, then closed her lovely eyes, although running at full
  speed. "I wish it would chuck its legs away next," she wheezed; "then we
  might be able to give ours a bit of a rest."</p>

  <p>"Never a dull moment," said Rex Pebble. "We got our youth and strength
  back just in time to become physical wrecks."</p>

  <p>"Rex," cried Spray suddenly, "it's got me!" So saying she catapulted
  through the air, rolled over several times, then came to rest with Hal's
  helmet miraculously on her head and the lion's on her left foot. "Rex! Rex!"
  she sobbed. "The monster's swallowed my foot with his neck. Please do
  something about it."</p>

  <p>"What do you want him to swallow it with?" Rex Pebble asked reasonably
  enough.</p>

  <p>"I don't want him to swallow my foot at all," she complained rather
  pathetically, "especially since I've lost my corns. Come here and take it
  away."</p>

  <p>Here she waved one slim, lion-capped leg aloft in a frantic effort to
  dislodge it. A carefully concealed police-man thrust his head from behind a
  pillar just in time to witness this odd spectacle.</p>

  <p>"Hey, boys!" he shouted, quickly withdrawing his head. "It's one half
  fireman now, and the other half's a wild beast. And both ends are peering at
  each other."</p>

  <p>The boys received this devastating bit of news in stunned silence.
  Presently a timid voice spoke up.</p>

  <p>"Which half of the thing is wild beast?" it wanted to be told.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied the policeman behind the pillar. "Both halves are
  heads and a lot of mouth."</p>

  <p>"And what's become of that lower half of a lady?" the voice continued.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know that either," said the policeman. "I'm out of luck
  entirely."</p>

  <p>"Why not take a shot at the wild beast?" suggested the voice. "That is, if
  you're sure no part of it is the lower half of a lady."</p>

  <p>This suggestion paralyzed Spray. She strove so hard to get her leg as far
  away from the rest of her body as possible that she was lying on the back of
  her neck. A shot rang out, and the lion's head became merely a matter of
  record, its fragments flying through the air. They flew no faster than Spray.
  With one bound she was clear of the floor, and with another she was climbing
  up Rex Pebble's back.</p>

  <p>"That ends all hope of poise," he bitterly observed. "What are we going to
  do with each other?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she retorted wearily, "but I've been a half of this and a
  half of that for so long I might just as well pretend I'm a part of you. Run
  away somewhere and hide us. My foot still tingles."</p>

  <p>"This way!" suddenly bellowed the parade-ground voice of Major Jaffey.
  "This way for the fire party. An exit. It is here!"</p>

  <p>Although the good Major had not the vaguest idea as to what new dangers
  the exit led, he rightly assumed they could be no worse than those already
  confronting them. With the Pebble party at his heels, he dashed down several
  flights of stairs and at last emerged into the main floor of Crown's
  Cosmopolitan. Here, protected once more by darkness, the old business of
  hiding began all over again.</p>

  <p>"Grab whatever clothes you can find and put them on," ordered the Major.
  "Thus we will be disguised for a later flight. If you insist on being honest
  we can charge them to Mrs. Pebble. Her husband will explain later."</p>

  <p>"In detail," came the caustic voice of Rex Pebble through the darkness.
  "My wife will enjoy it."</p>

  <p>For some minutes the darkness of the main floor was filled with the
  stealthy yet industrious sound of searching feet. Rex Pebble fortunately
  encountered the figure of a gentleman in evening clothes. This he promptly
  stripped of all garments and transferred them to his own person. He was
  completely attired in every detail, including a top hat. No sooner had he
  finished his toilet than he felt a pair of hands furtively investigating his
  body. Mr. Pebble froze in his tracks and tried to emulate the position of the
  figure he had just denuded. Suddenly his hat was deftly whisked from his
  head. Mr. Pebble made no remonstrance. The next minute one of his feet was
  lifted from the floor and the pump flipped from it. This happened to the
  other foot, and still Mr. Pebble made no demur. But when his trousers were
  firmly seized and neatly slipped down his legs he thought it was high time to
  take a little interest in himself.</p>

  <p>"Whoever you are," he said in his most formal tones, "be so good as to put
  those trousers back where you found them. Also the shoes and hat."</p>

  <p>"All right, boss," came the depressed voice of Nokashima. "You must look
  so nice. Not first time I undress you. He! He! Where I put pants?"</p>

  <p>"Where I usually wear them, Nocka," replied Rex Pebble patiently. "On the
  legs and middle section." When the little servant had finished redressing
  him, Mr. Pebble patted him affectionately on the shoulder. "Sorry to have
  disappointed you. Better luck next time. Go find an outfit of your own."</p>

  <p>"I go, boss," replied Nokashima. "I array myself like baron. All very
  fine."</p>

  <p>But like many whose hearts are overflowing with the best intentions,
  Nokashima soon became discouraged and finally desperate. This unsettled state
  of mind led to another contretemps.</p>

  <p>Spray Summers, who had got herself into something rather good in the line
  of an evening gown, was at first a little flattered when she felt masculine
  hands laid upon her. However, she remained motionless and silent until she
  had assured herself that the hands were on friendly business. When her
  step-ins were seized and zipped from their place of repose she did not scream
  as would have some women, but merely satisfied her emotions by giving the
  unseen gentleman a playful little push. What was her surprise when she
  received a push back of such vigor that the breath was nearly knocked from
  her body. Staggering back, she rallied her forces, shook her head like a
  dazed boxer, then gamely returned to the assault. No matter how friendly his
  intentions, this man must be taught a lesson. His advances had been
  satisfactorily direct. Those step-ins had been handled with the deftness of
  an expert. But the man's idea of playfulness was altogether too rough. He
  needed a little polishing to make him entirely acceptable. She would be
  forced to show the fellow that there was a right way and a wrong way to
  everything. In such affairs technique meant much to a lady. There was nothing
  to be gained in crippling a woman one intended to amuse later on. Therefore,
  when this time Spray Summers unleashed a blow in the darkness, she did so
  with a will. The flat of her swiftly traveling hand forcibly encountered a
  closely cropped head. There was a sudden gasp, the sound of a body operating
  out of control, then an alarming crash of glass as a show case was definitely
  and permanently put out of business. Spray smiled grimly but not for long. If
  he returned to her after that one, she reflected, he would be a determined
  chap indeed. And return he did, but in no soliciting mood. Spray felt herself
  grasped firmly round the knees, lifted from the floor, then violently
  deposited thereon. For a moment or so she sat moodily where she had landed
  and rubbed the spot of contact. Then she sighed. This last attack of her
  unseen admirer was sufficiently ruthless to convince her that no matter how
  agreeable he ultimately intended to be, he was certainly making a shambles of
  things at the present moment. In short, the ends failed to justify the means.
  The wear and tear was too terrific.</p>

  <p>Heaving herself to her hands and knees, she was about to crawl from the
  field, using the better part of valor for an excuse, when she was seized from
  behind and the slippers&mdash;a size too large&mdash;dragged from her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"What the hell!" she muttered, twisting her head back over her shoulder.
  "I say there, are you still playing, or are you mad at me?"</p>

  <p>"Not each," came back the answer. "Striving to retain life in small body.
  Also to disguise same beneath alien garments."</p>

  <p>Spray was appalled. The cool effrontery of this imp from some Japanese
  hell made her momentarily speech-less.</p>

  <p>"Will you stop trying to disguise yourself beneath my garments?" she
  demanded at last. "Give me back my shoes and pants. You deliberately stole
  them from me."</p>

  <p>"Not steal, madam," said Nokashima. "All charged up. Very sorry. Every
  figure I attempt to uncover turns into angry being. 'Go 'way, vile Jap,' all
  say. Night of vast frustration. Here things, madam. Want me to slip on?"</p>

  <p>"You slip on through the darkness," replied Spray. "And don't come near me
  for years."</p>

  <p>"As I thought," said Nocka, sorrowfully. "Once more driven round about.
  Don't angry, madam. Maybe I suicide in own blood. Not sure, though. Maybe
  dogs of flatties mangle first. Where are dogs of flatties? I not see
  one."</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble to look for them," advised Spray a little more kindly.
  "They'll find us soon enough."</p>

  <p>Nocka suddenly giggled.</p>

  <p>"I thought you dog of flattie," he told her. "Fight grimly for life."</p>

  <p>"Dogs don't wear pants, Nocka," she informed him.</p>

  <p>"Dogs of flatties might," he argued. "How I know? Dogs of flatties adopt
  confusing disguise, maybe. I not surprise if do. What a romp we had. I almost
  repose in glass casket like famous Russian redman."</p>

  <p>"Are you still drunk, Nokashima?"</p>

  <p>"A mere pushover," replied Nocka. "I suspend, madam."</p>

  <p>"I wish you could find a drink." Spray's voice sounded wistful.</p>

  <p>"Wish could," said Nocka. "No disgrace in valiant endeavor. I worm in
  search, teeteringly. Excuse please, madam."</p>

  <p>Spray listened to his quiet departure for a few minutes, then she no
  longer had to strain her ears. A great rumpus somewhere out in the black void
  apprised her of the fact that the little yellow man had once more established
  contact with an angry being.</p>

  <p>"Take your hands off me, whoever you are," she heard Hal, the fireman,
  declaiming. "Neither man nor beast is going to handle me that way."</p>

  <p>Seemingly the small creature was out of luck again. Feeling a little sorry
  for him and a lot more for herself, Spray rose slowly from the floor and
  rearranged her dress and things.</p>

  <p>While she was thus engaged, several lights flooded on in various parts of
  the store. The darkness was decimated. She glanced quickly around, then froze
  in her tracks. Other than the invading policemen there seemed to be no sign
  of life. This was due to the fact that, like herself, each member of the
  Pebble party stood poised in a position of suspended animation. Major Jaffey
  was modishly attired in a checked cap and light raglan. Hal, the fire-man,
  looking like an example of what the well dressed man was not wearing, had
  rigged himself up in a cross between a yachting outfit and a riding costume,
  retaining the worst features of each. Of Nokashima there was no sign.</p>

  <p>"They're hiding on us," said Pat Murphy in a low voice. "Spread out and
  comb the floor."</p>

  <p>Looking tremendously impressive in his evening clothes, Mr. Pebble stepped
  forward and confronted Officer Murphy.</p>

  <p>"Murphy," he said severely, "I would like to know just what you and your
  men mean by making a play-ground of this store? I am chairman of the board of
  directors and have a perfect right to be here. I was telephoned to during a
  party I was giving and forced to hurry right down. If you haven't a
  satisfactory explanation, I'm afraid things are going to go very badly with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir," said Murphy. "We were looking for a thing that was half
  fireman and half lady. One of the halves turned to a wild beast right before
  our eyes."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Murphy," said Rex Pebble regretfully. "When your buttons are
  popping off, just think of what you've been telling me."</p>

  <p>"But this store was full of robbers and things," Pat desperately assured
  Mr. Pebble. "Ask any of the boys. We saw 'em and we heard 'em. Look, sir,
  that case is smashed a bit."</p>

  <p>"True," admitted Rex Pebble. "I want to be fair and reasonable. We heard
  that disturbance. Perhaps robbers are in the store. If so, it is your duty to
  apprehend them. In the meantime have one of your men open a door and let us
  out."</p>

  <p>With a stately stride Rex Pebble walked to the nearest door, a policeman
  preceding him. To the surprise and consternation of Pat Murphy and his
  brother officers the figures of a woman and two men suddenly came to life and
  followed their leader. Well in the rear glided the most surprising of all the
  figures. It was the stiff, lifeless form of a store model clad in the costume
  of a maid. This model had two pairs of feet, only one pair of which was
  moving.</p>

  <p>"Look," cried Pat, pointing. "Look, for the love of God! It moves and it's
  not alive."</p>

  <p>Major Jaffey, with great presence of mind, lifted the strange object in
  his arms and bore it to the door.</p>

  <p>"It's the lady's maid," he explained over his shoulder. "The poor girl's
  scared stiff."</p>

  <p>When the Pebble party was a safe distance from the store, the Major set
  his burden down, and the small body of the little yellow man was extracted
  with some difficulty, owing to the fact that various parts of him had become
  wedged within the hollow shell of his temporarily adopted habitation.</p>

  <p>"Unable to disrobe one similar to Fifi in time," Nokashima explained
  blinkingly. "I attack from under. Amazed at own brilliance. What say,
  boss?"</p>

  <p>"Ask that diminutive Japanese maniac to say as little as possible to me
  for at least ten minutes," Rex Pebble said to Spray. "I will need all of that
  time to rehabilitate my poise. We are now going home&mdash;to my home, for a
  change."</p>

  <p>"Look what I apprehend," announced Nocka, producing the lion's head from
  some recess within the shell of his recent disguise. "I bring home to Mist'
  Henry, and he bound with alarm."</p>

  <p>Without a word Rex Pebble turned on his heel and led the way through the
  night.</p>

  <p>Later that same night Officer Pat Murphy encountered the abandoned model
  of the maid leaning dejectedly against a wall. It was only after questioning
  it closely for some minutes that he discovered the object was not alive.</p>

  <p>"I knew all along," he said to the fading stars, "there was some monkey
  business going on."</p>

  <p>But when he gave his report to the sergeant he made no mention of his
  discovery. Things were bad enough to explain as they were, without adding
  another mystery to the list.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">10. A WALK THROUGH TOWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Never mind about my excitable nature," remarked Spray
  Summers, as they turned into a particularly quiet and deserted street. "I
  never would have believed that being bottled up in a department store with so
  many men could make me so nervous, but I feel like jumping at every shadow.
  Can't we keep off these side streets? I expect to meet Frankenstein or
  Dracula any minute."</p>

  <p>"After our recent experiences," said the Major gravely, "side streets are
  the thing for us. It was just about here, only one block down on the main
  thoroughfare, that we made that corner on two wheels."</p>

  <p>The night was black. Black as ink. Black as pitch. Black as Egypt. Any one
  of the stand-by comparisons would have done, but the truth is that this
  particular alley looked like nothing so much as the inside of a stovepipe or
  a coal cellar in the dark. You felt as though something might be living in
  it, beyond eyesight, sneaking along, maybe tap-tapping with an invisible
  cane.</p>

  <p>"Where are the stars?" asked Hal, the fireman, sleepily and
  innocently.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't anybody told you?" returned Spray with kindly venom. "We're not
  using them since the Light and Gas Code was signed. They're on a strike. Wish
  they'd do some picketing, though," added the woman, shivering, as an
  afterthought. Rex Pebble, in the lead of the group, stepped into a doorway to
  light a cigarette. It seemed a shame to run the risk of having their trail
  again picked up by the police just for the sake of one little light. He
  opened a packet of matches and struck one. Nothing happened. He struck
  another match head, and this one, just as his companions caught up, ignited.
  Rex stepped out from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"My God," screamed Spray at the top of her none too delicate lungs, "the
  place is alive with men!" She clutched the arm of Hal, who, stumbling along
  in his weariness, suddenly leaped forward like a fire horse at the sound of
  the bell. From the rear Hal tackled Major Lynnhaven Jaffey, who in turn
  whirled upon Nokashima. Spray Summers, seeing herself deserted, flung her
  lissom young form harshly against Rex Pebble.</p>

  <p>"It's I!" cried Rex, pushing her away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah?" retorted the woman. "Well, plenty of women have gone wrong
  from believing men who said it's I in the dark." Spray landed a swift slap on
  Rex's right cheek, while Hal, the Major, and Nokashima, after banging one
  another around, recovered their wits sufficiently to rush to her defense.
  They all landed upon Rex full force. The poor fellow was sinking under their
  combined weight when Spray discovered their mistake.</p>

  <p>"It's Rex!" she cried, and her friends, believing her to be hailing Rex's
  approach as a new champion, flattened the unfortunate man on the sidewalk.
  "I've got him," said Nokashima glibly, sitting on his boss's neck at the
  uncomfortable point where Adam's apple is the Gibraltar between Atlantic of
  body and Mediterranean of head.</p>

  <p>"So I see," whispered a weak voice from beneath the human pile. "Now that
  you've had your fun, let me up, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Very fresh for masher," returned Nocka, practically jumping up and down.
  "Teach good lesson."</p>

  <p>"You let him up this minute, you wizened yellow idiot," said Spray. "Do
  you realize who you're sitting on?"</p>

  <p>"Formal introduction not necessary," returned the Japanese,, who was
  proudly taking credit for the entire triumph of the onslaught. "Only that
  madam attacked."</p>

  <p>"We do not care, my dear girl," said Major Jaffey with' great heroism and
  formality, "who the fellow is, so long as we have saved you from dishonor and
  disgrace."</p>

  <p>"Let him up, Major," commented Spray. "You're too late. You should have
  met us in a dark street twenty years ago. That's my fate you have glued to
  the sidewalk there."</p>

  <p>"Your fate?" inquired the Major, raising his eyebrows and looking round
  for Rex. "I was under the impression that I had been out with your fate all
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Out with him and on top of him," returned Spray; "only, when you're
  through using his reconditioned chassis as a mattress, I think I'll wrap it
  up and take it home with me. In other words, gentlemen, you're sitting on Rex
  Pebble."</p>

  <p>Three shadowy figures sprang up in the darkness, out-lined faintly in the
  pale wash of light that drifted through the street from the lamp on the
  corner. A fourth shadowy figure rose and seemed to creak as it rose. It also
  seemed to stretch its arms and legs, and from it issued a deep and satisfying
  groan.</p>

  <p>"A good job," commented Rex. "I've never been so thoroughly mistaken for a
  gang of stick-up artists in my life. Something to add to my experience."
  While his three assailants continued to pour regrets and apologies upon him,
  Rex Pebble took Spray Summers' arm, and again the group moved down the
  street.</p>

  <p>"First think we meet strange men and beat up," apologized Nokashima; "now
  only hope do not meet strange dogs or animals." He brandished his spoil, the
  lion's head. "May prove turning point in Mist' Henry's life. Very likely to
  arouse primitive passions. Either Mist' Henry overcome with superiority of
  imitation over nature, inspired to help self, or slink off coward-like."
  Nocka was genuinely worried. It was vital that Mr. Henry take to the lion's
  head.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that bloody beast&mdash;I mean that bloodless beast," Spray
  spoke out of the blackness; "just let's get home before we massacre each
  other. Let me hold your arm too, Major. I don't feel too easy yet."</p>

  <p>Spray Summers suited the prophecy to the moment, for, just then, from the
  dark triangle of a small doorway stepped a figure. The only thing visible
  about it was a white handkerchief across its face. The Pebble party felt its
  presence rather than saw it. They stopped short, arm in arm, with Nokashima
  in the rear pressing close against Major Jaffey and Hal.</p>

  <p>"Stick 'em up!" said a voice, "or I'll fill your bellies full of lead!"
  Ten hands shot into the air.</p>

  <p>"Now turn around and walk Indian file in front of me," continued the
  voice. There was a peculiar note of hesitancy in the command. The voice
  seemed somehow to question its own judgment. It wavered. "Is that right,
  Joe?" it inquired of an unseen presence in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Yes and no," returned the presence. "Of course, you've got to vary your
  technique with the personalities concerned. However, I can't really sense
  these personalities, let alone see them. It's hardly a fair trial."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble felt that it was time to put in a word. "Are you predicting
  anything about a trial, or is that just part of your course in
  technique?"</p>

  <p>"Just part of the course," said the presence in the doorway, which was
  male. "We're just a couple of young fellers working our way through school,
  and we're on the second story now, won't you help us out?" The presence
  seemed to be struggling with an old instinct for salesmanship, just as the
  actual robber appeared to be mentally thumbing the index of a book of
  directions on how to commit a robbery.</p>

  <p>"Sure, glad to accommodate," answered Rex Pebble, "especially if you'll
  give us a receipt and let us go on home."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said the first voice, quite shocked. "We can't let you go home
  alone. First we'll take your clothes&mdash;just come along now, strip them
  off&mdash;and then we'll be very glad to see you home."</p>

  <p>"You'll see more than my home if you take these clothes off," remarked
  Spray, as she started to slip off her dress, "because I only had time to grab
  something for the outside. I'm practically nude inside, you know."</p>

  <p>Both voices were silent. They seemed to be considering. What was the
  proper thing for a robber to do now? The romantic thing was to let the woman
  keep her clothes, reform yourself, and then marry her, but that seemed a
  little harsh for a young gentleman gangster just starting out.</p>

  <p>Spray sensed the embarrassment that hung over the scene. "Oh, come now,"
  she said, "we didn't mean to hurt your feelings. You're far too sensitive as
  it is. I just don't see how you could use clothes like mine in your
  business."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you'd better keep your clothes on. We want to keep this
  hold-up clean. No sex. It's against the Union now, anyhow." The fellow stuck
  a torch into Spray Summers' face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's lovely," said the somewhat cold presence who came forward from
  his director's stand in the door-way. They both were engrossed; they spoke as
  though none of their victims could hear. "I could use that in my
  business."</p>

  <p>"Look out now," said No. 1. "I may not know as much as you do about
  technique, but I can tell about some other things. You can't have love and a
  career, you know."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think I am&mdash;Hitler?" inquired No. 2 icily. "I'm afraid
  that I'll just have to ask you to stick to your work. I think we might just
  try taking that dress off."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble realized that things were coming to a crisis. No. 2 was
  evidently a man of social grace, highly susceptible to feminine charm if,
  without even seeing Spray's face, he wished to take her dress off. Something
  had to be done quickly. Rex felt his adversary's weakness.</p>

  <p>"You fellows might be interested in a little party we're throwing up at
  our place," he suggested. "It seems like an awful bad night in your
  line."</p>

  <p>"Matter of fact, couldn't be worse," said No. 2 sociably. <i>"I</i> never
  would have gone out at all if it hadn't been for <i>him."</i> It appeared
  that he was pointing with scorn at his companion. "They didn't think he was
  getting along at all, and it was just my luck to have him come into my class.
  I always say that if you stay in a school as long as three years without
  progress, you'll never get out."</p>

  <p>"Have you been in three years?" asked Spray Summers, following Rex's lead
  in hoping to keep the talk impersonal.</p>

  <p>"In three years?" replied No. 1 viciously. "What does she mean, in three
  years?"</p>

  <p>"Now, don't go getting on your high horse," warned No. 2, "because that's
  one of the main things that holds you back. She doesn't mean any offense. She
  merely means, have you been in <i>school</i> three years."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said No. 1 with evident relief, "oh, that, sure. It isn't the work
  so much that holds me back as the social life. School is so much social life,
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Which is all the more reason for you to come along and join us. When we
  left the house there was half a fire department and a French maid at
  play."</p>

  <p>"See there," remarked No. 2, who apparently, after looking forward to a
  dull evening, saw things beginning to pick up. "What you ought to do is to
  get out and meet some of the customers."</p>

  <p>"Can't mix business and play," No. 1 was murmuring stubbornly when
  Nokashima broke in with admirable tact.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," suggested the little man, whose knowing smile could not be seen
  in the deep night that surrounded them, "young men like nightcap?" No. 2
  appeared to be utterly overwhelmed with this idea. He abandoned all attempt
  at a professional manner and frankly tugged at his companion's sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Listen, pal," said Joe pleadingly, "these ain't the regular kind you'll
  find yourself sticking up. They're decent. They're worth meeting. Come to
  think of it, you ought to get used to finding your way around homes of
  hospitable people. It's knowledge that will come in handy some day. Go to the
  bathroom. Find how it lets out of the bed-room. Pardon me, folks," Joe
  interrupted himself, "I gotta tell him some of these things so's to sell him
  on the idea of coming along with us. It's the inside layout that counts. You
  got the approach. You can handle a ladder. I've seen you work: you're slick
  as a cat, you go through a place like greased lightning. The fellas all like
  to work with you. But what good does all this do you if you don't know the
  build-up of these places inside? Not often you get a chance like this. Come
  on, pal, I can't quit on you, but I want to go."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Rex Pebble, who would have been dubious about the
  whole proposition except for the fact that No. 1 could not be persuaded to
  lower his pistol, which was pointed directly at Rex, or so he imagined. "Why
  not settle the argument? You come along with us, Joe, and let your friend
  here bring up the tail end. He can keep on aiming his pistol at the last one
  in the line."</p>

  <p>No sooner had Rex got the words out of his mouth than there was a mad
  scramble in the street, everyone striving to get first into line, with Major
  Lynnhaven Jaffey in the natural process of evolution coming out last, No. 1's
  unhesitating gun poked between his shoulder blades. The line proceeded up the
  street.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's mighty funny to me," persisted No. 1 as the party moved along,
  "and I can't see why I should be still sticking you up when you're all on the
  move and on your way home, but I guess I know my duty when I see it. Get
  along there," he commanded the Major roughly.</p>

  <p>"Could you possibly lower that thing just a bit?" inquired the Major,
  "because, while I may be an old man and not particularly interested in life,
  it tickles me when it bobs up and down. You might as well put it away,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"What kind of drinks have you got?" asked Joe, coming to the point in a
  business-like manner. "Somebody remarked something about a nightcap. What's
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's a drink we give you before we put you to bed," answered Spray
  Summers, who had begun to wonder how these latest two additions to the party
  were going to fit into the group that might already be celebrating something
  or other at her house when they got home.</p>

  <p>"Bed?" Joe packed a wealth of meaning into one small word. "Did you hear
  that, Elmer? Bed."</p>

  <p>Rex, Spray, Hal, Nokashima, and Major Jaffey were swinging along in
  lockstep now, much more as though they were on their way to the workhouse
  than to Spray's comfortable home. .</p>

  <p>"Why so surprised?" asked Spray. "Don't you boys ever go to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," admitted Joe. "But everything does seem pretty upset tonight.
  Not more than an hour ago I was back there"&mdash;he indicated somewhere
  behind them with a jerk of the thumb&mdash;"watching Elmer clean up his tool
  for the evening, and now here I am going home to bed with my prospects. I
  guess I'll never be a success. I think I must have an inferiority complex.
  Just ask me somewhere, and I'm a pushover."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll be all right when you get some of our drinks under your
  belt," Rex assured him. "I could use one myself. How long have you been in
  this game?" he asked the sociable young man who had directed the
  stick-up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, say three years, off and on," returned Joe. "Long enough to get the
  feel of the thing. But I don't like it. I always wanted to be a banker."</p>

  <p>"Well, now," spoke up Major Lynnhaven Jaffey, with interest, "just how
  much would you be interested in putting up, should the right opportunity
  present itself? I think I know of something most attractive to a chap of your
  background and bearing."</p>

  <p>"Major, Major," warned Spray Summers, "remember he's only a boy."</p>

  <p>"I could round up five or six thousand pretty easy," answered Joe, who in
  order to make the Major hear him had to raise his voice quite a bit. It was a
  strange procession. But it was making time, owing to the relentless pace set
  by Joe in the hopes that they could shake his accomplice or tire him out.
  "Five or six thousand, did you hear me?"</p>

  <p>"That would do nicely," called back Major Jaffey, "this particular
  institution is out in Arkansas, near Pine Bluff."</p>

  <p>"Neat," commented Spray. "An institution, is it?"</p>

  <p>"What would five or six thousand get me?" asked Joe. "I want a white-
  collar job."</p>

  <p>"Well, just look at me, my boy," admonished the Major. "You can hardly see
  me at the moment, but we'll remedy that later. I am a tall, distinguished,
  well-dressed man of sixty, and attribute my success solely to one thing: I
  never let anything worry me. You just let me have that five or six thousand,
  and neither of us will worry about anything."</p>

  <p>"Could I stand behind a cage and pass out books?" asked Joe eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I think you're confusing banks and public libraries," remarked Spray,
  "but you can do one thing for <i>me."</i></p>

  <p>"What's that, lady?"</p>

  <p>"Just sell your boy friend on the idea of dropping that gun. The Major,
  though a friend of mine, is pretty thin, and I've just been thinking that if
  your friend should shoot him, the bullet would probably push its way through
  him, on up here to me. And I don't want to die&mdash;not tonight."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Elmer." Joe adopted a new tack. "If you'll put the gat away, I'll
  let you hold 'em up on the front steps of their own house when we get there.
  Think of what that would read like in the papers. I'll even have a flashlight
  picture made. Elmer Browne, snapped sticking up prominent West End residents.
  We might even get a spread in the society section. How's that?"</p>

  <p>"How often," replied Elmer with ponderous dignity, "do I have to tell you
  that I take this profession seriously. If I stick somebody up, he stays stuck
  up, society section or not, even if I have to follow him home."</p>

  <p>"That's it," cut in Spray, "we want to give you a break. We want you to
  have a fresh start right at our home. You're all tired out holding that gun.
  You'll feel a lot more like making a snappy hold-up if you'll just put it
  down for a while."</p>

  <p>"And meet some nice girls," invited Rex.</p>

  <p>"And have potent drink," added Nokashima.</p>

  <p>"And take that damned pistol out of my shoulder blades," said the
  Major.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," Elmer capitulated reluctantly. "But remember, when we get
  there?"</p>

  <p>"When we get there," promised Rex.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of there," suggested Spray Summers, her ear cocked in the
  direction in which they were walking, "I suspect that I hear music."</p>

  <p>From the direction of the Summers ménage there issued a medley of sound.
  It was as though a Negro band in collision with a load of milk cans were
  playing Gershwin. Somebody was evidently beating on a dish pan, and somebody
  else had manufactured a home-made comb cornet. The air was not easy to
  identify, as the singers themselves seemed uncertain, but one thing was sure,
  that Fifi, patriotic to the core, imagined herself to be leading in the less
  mentionable verses of "Mademoiselle from Armentières."</p>

  <p>"How nice," said Rex Pebble. "I think the Fire Department must have
  arranged a housewarming."</p>

  <p>"Well, if they did," Spray came back, "I hope they left some of my
  extinguisher in the cellar. It sounds as though they must have drunk it all
  up."</p>

  <p>"Do you take home gangs every night?" put in Elmer doubtfully, his fingers
  slipping over the handle of his pistol.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said Spray; "these were just some fellows from the Fire
  Department who stopped in some hours ago to help extinguish a blaze. I think
  they stayed to entertain the maid, or vice versa. You'll like them. They're
  awfully jolly people&mdash;in for anything, at the drop of a hat."</p>

  <p>"The drop of a fireman's hat is very important." Major Lynnhaven Jaffey
  cleared his throat and called ahead, "Don't forget, old man, that when we
  arrive at our host's I would like a few quiet words with you. A banker never
  forgets."</p>

  <p>Turning from the side street abruptly brought the Pebble party suddenly
  before a small gate in the wall of Spray Summers' garden. Rex, as first in
  line, had been guiding the footsteps of that intrepid brigand Joe, a willing
  victim of victimized hospitality. There was a tiny ship's lamp alight above
  the gate, and in the diffused yellow glow from this the party drew up. Elmer,
  a tanned-face, black-eyed, sullen young man, regarded the company with
  distrust, wagging his head at Joe. Joe, on the other hand, wore an alert
  expression on his blond countenance. He turned a quizzical expression upon
  each face in turn. "Well," he said, "you're not a bad lot of yeggs at all.
  Who's the old codger?"</p>

  <p>"That's your prospective banking associate, of whom you speak so
  flippantly," Rex Pebble informed him. "And be sure to lock the cash drawer
  nights," advised Spray.</p>

  <p>"My friends here are being jocose with me," laughed the Major. "We'll just
  step inside and discuss the matter." The Major opened the little gate and
  stepped in. At once he stuck an astonished face back. "What's going in here?"
  he queried. "They've broken windows and knocked down doors."</p>

  <p>"Still looking for a fire," said Spray disconsolately, "that's where our
  taxes go."</p>

  <p>"Should think Mademoiselle Fifi provide plenty fire for boys," put in
  Nokashima.</p>

  <p>"Well, you just go in and tell them to come out, Spray dear," suggested
  Mr. Pebble. "Tell them it's time to go home, that the chief wants them. And
  you might add that they'd better hurry, as we're arranging a little stick-up
  party on the front lawn."</p>

  <p>"I will not," retorted the woman. "It's as much your house as it is mine.
  I'm damned if I'm going to get mixed up with any more municipal branches. I
  started out with the Fire Department, got in bed with the police, invited
  gangsters home, and now you want me to start all over. I may not be the same
  as I was this morning, but I know when my dogs are tired, even if I am
  restored to my youth, and they are tired now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'd better go in and fetch you the slippers Sue sent you for the
  anniversary of your seduction?" Rex insinuated, a teasing little smile
  curving his handsome mouth.</p>

  <p>"You leave that hussy of a wife of yours out of this," in a tone that rang
  through the night air. Both Elmer and Joe looked shocked. It was plain to see
  that they felt that if the trend in robbery was towards the gentlemanly
  frisk, this was not the sort of company for them to be out with. From the
  house, however, came an inquiring voice that drew the attention of the
  company.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" it called in a deep bass.</p>

  <p>"A friend," returned Spray Summers. "In fact, I'm the mistress of this
  house."</p>

  <p>"Mistress?" questioned the voice. "Well, then, come on in," it continued
  with a show of determination.</p>

  <p>"No, you come on out," returned the woman. "Let's play out in the
  yard."</p>

  <p>"If you're really the mistress of this house, I'll give you a drink. I bet
  you'd like a drink, too. You must have been away a long time, because I've
  been here for hours and hours and hours, and I can't remember ever seeing
  you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you were young when I left this house. But don't let that worry you.
  I'll bet you know your way about now. Come on out and bring your
  friends."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any friends. They've all deserted me. I'm all alone in the
  world. They're all out in the kitchen with Fifi, singing dirty songs."</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you out in the kitchen with Fifi?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't know the words."</p>

  <p>"That won't make any difference," called Spray. "Come on out; we want you
  for witness at a shooting."</p>

  <p>"A shooting?" The word hung poised on air.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and then we'll sing afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but are you sure that <i>I'll</i> sing afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Well, what difference will it make? You can't sing now."</p>

  <p>"That's right," agreed the voice. "You sound like a mighty sensible woman.
  I may be mad, but I think I'll take you up on that. Tell you what, I'll come
  out on one condition."</p>

  <p>The Pebble party held its breath. Elmer was beginning to finger his
  pistol. It seemed like a shame to let the lad grow restive and really spoil
  things. Besides, he looked like an awfully good shot. Joe wore an
  apprehensive look, as though his period of influence with the hothead were
  rapidly drawing to an ending. Then there was the matter of ridding the house
  of firemen. This would take considerable strategy. A great deal depended on
  the answer of that unseen voice in the window.</p>

  <p>"We'll do 'most anything to please <i>you."</i> Spray Summers chose her
  words with care, as became the feat of dealing with a distant drunken
  fireman.</p>

  <p>"I'll come down and I'll witness your shooting&mdash;or my shooting, if
  you must&mdash;but you've got to have a drink with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that. That's easy." A sigh broke over the whole band, from the Major
  to Nokashima. "Hurry up, now, come on down and bring that drink. There're
  eight of us."</p>

  <p><i>"Eight</i> of you? What is this&mdash;a shooting gallery? Wait till I
  go where I started to go up here on the second floor hours and hours and
  hours ago." The voice trailed off like the Cheshire cat's head.</p>

  <p>"What happens when he <i>does</i> come down?" demanded Elmer. "You told me
  when we got to the house we'd have the stick-up."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," returned Rex, "but the idea is that you must accept of our
  hospitality first. One drink. One drink to a good haul and a better shot if
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"That's fair," urged Joe, who in the soft light of the ship's lamp above
  the little garden gate was taking a keen interest in Spray Summers' lissom
  young form, and in those deep, burning brown eyes whose sparkle was
  heightened by her recent debate. Suddenly, while Elmer argued with himself, a
  hand was thrust through the gate, extending a quart bottle of liquid.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the bass voice, "I'll be out in a minute. Don't you lose
  this, now, because it's all I've got, and you're all the friends I've
  got."</p>

  <p>Nokashima took the bottle from the hand. Tut-tutting over it, the little
  yellow man bemoaned the lack of a cocktail shaker and equipment. "Gurgles
  from bottle grow tiresome," he murmured. "Anxious restore proper order to
  madam's bar. If any bar left." He gazed with rue toward the gate, when a
  bright idea seemed to attack him.</p>

  <p>"Here, take," said Nokashima to his boss, handing him the bottle and at
  the same time donning himself the phony lion's head which he had lugged along
  as a trophy for Mr. Henry. "Scare burning daylights out of Fire
  Department."</p>

  <p>Evidently the fireman with the conversational bass had returned to the
  house for glasses, for at this moment, as Nokashima poked his lion's head
  inside the gate, there was a crash as of many small glass objects dropped at
  once and a heavy pounding of feet on the lawn. "God help me!" the words
  tumbled through the night air, "if it isn't a menagerie." A door slammed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">11. THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When the last sad sounds of the fleeing fireman had died on
  the night &mdash;or very early morning&mdash;air, Rex Pebble and his retinue
  still stood in front of the little garden gate of his mistress Spray Summers'
  house, wondering what next to do. A hold-up had to be arranged for the two
  mystified gentlemen gangsters who had accompanied the party home only on
  being promised that they might have their stick-up on the front lawn. That
  is, Elmer seemed adamant; Joe had really only come for the fun.</p>

  <p>The party sadly lacked leadership. Its motives were many. Fascism was in
  urgent demand. Spray Summers' chief desire was to get home, and not far
  distant in her thoughts was a bed. Rex Pebble, to a not surprising degree,
  held similar notions, that is, if amended with a few last drinks. Major
  Lynnhaven Jaffey, after searching half the world around, suspected that at
  length he had found the ideal angel for his pet bank, in Joe the Brigand.
  Hal, a little ashamed of being away so long, rather hated to face his
  compatriot brothers-at-hose, though this dread was alleviated by the sounds
  of merriment that issued from the house. Nokashima, of the whole band, had
  the least complicated ideas: with a bottle of liquor in his hands, there was
  only one thing that really remained to be done, and that was to shake it up
  skillfully into tempting cocktails. Nokashima should have been house man to
  Jove, or Bacchus's bell boy: nothing delighted him so much as to relieve
  suffering mankind by the simple magic of alcohol.</p>

  <p>Nokashima now addressed his mistress. "Early bird catch cocktail," the
  fellow put his thought axiomatically. "I go make same&mdash;providing
  sufficient glasses left in honorable establishment." Nocka vanished through
  the gate.</p>

  <p>"You never have to worry about what to do next with that young Oriental
  around," breathed Spray with a sigh of relief and anticipation. "Shall we
  join the firemen?"</p>

  <p>From Elmer there was a silence that, unseen, was a scowl. "I want to know
  &mdash;" began that young man.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we know," returned Rex Pebble patiently. "But you can't start till
  you get inside. That's the first principle of burglaring. Haven't you even
  taught him that, Joe? You're a heck of a professor."</p>

  <p>"He's persistent, Chief," replied Joe blithely. "Per-severance always
  wins. I'll bet you'll let him stick you up yet. Me for that nightgown that
  somebody mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Nightcap," corrected Spray. "Remember, this is a nice house, and no
  monkey business."</p>

  <p>Spray Summers, as hostess after her own peculiar fashion, led the way
  through the gate and down a pebble path to the veranda door. Off to the left
  of the party as they moved down the drive, the waters of the garden pool
  whispered in a slow night breeze. Their whisper was a dare to secret
  rendezvous, to something precious that few people would have suspected, for
  all the fresh lush summer loveliness of the garden and the clear deep beauty
  of the water. Spray Summers took Rex Pebble's hand in hers, in the dark. It
  was the first time they had been near the magic spot, the curious, kindly
  fountain of youth, since new strength and years came back to them. An evening
  had slipped by swiftly, on wings of adventure, and now, within the almost
  sacred precincts of the house again, Spray felt stirred as she had not in
  years. "We'll get rid of them all soon," she whispered. "If we don't, we'll
  let Elmer shoot them," Rex answered, pressing her hand tightly.</p>

  <p>From within the house came continued noises of gayety and high joviality.
  "How shall we get them out?" asked Major Jaffey. "I'd like a quiet spot for a
  business conference."</p>

  <p>"I must say, Major," declared Spray, "that you choose the damnedest
  moments for your multicolored activities that I ever heard of. First you
  appear out of the bushes minus clothes, stay with us all evening, appear to
  be on the verge of spending the night, and now you want me to drive out my
  favorite firemen so that you may have a conference in the house. Of all the
  brass." Spray laughed. "I think the best thing is just to spread ourselves
  here while we await Nokashima. Besides, the fire laddies may join us
  themselves at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Can't you take it off?" asked Rex of Elmer, who was struggling to sit
  down on the stone terrace without entangling himself in his pistol.</p>

  <p>"Never have yet," said Elmer doggedly.</p>

  <p>"I should think it might be pretty uncomfortable at times," said Spray
  Summers with an evil look. "I can think of a couple of times, at least."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he takes it off sometimes," Joe defended his true-blood comrade. "I
  think I know what you mean. Yes." Joe was subtle if not delicate.</p>

  <p>A crystal tinkle of ice in tall glasses unmistakably heralded the approach
  of Nokashima, the tireless, the all-faithful. The drinks were long and cool
  and potent. From the first sip there was a deceptive charm to them, a
  suggestion that if you like me, don't hesitate to drink me, because I'm
  perfectly harmless, just a little drink trying to get along. They were
  matchless for good taste and for kick, the kind of thing one's palate
  remembers with the first fresh taste of surprise, in spite of what may follow
  after.</p>

  <p>Nokashima had switched on a wall light on the veranda before departing
  again for the house, and in the glow of this Elmer seemed gingerly to be
  sipping at his glass. It was plain that he wanted it but hated to give in.
  "Go on, old man," urged Major Jaffey, whose glass was half empty and who
  feared that one slow drinker might slow up the tempo of the party. "Dive in
  &mdash;it won't hurt you. I hear that a good drink now and again improves
  marksmanship."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," coaxed Joe, equally well along, "lift it up like this and take a
  great big swallow, like a man." Joe tossed off the remainder of his
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Elmer with more determination than grace, "I'm a sport. I
  guess I can take it. Down the barrel!" He tilted his glass and drained it,
  wiping his mouth on his sleeve with a gusty <i>"Whew!"</i></p>

  <p>"So that's that," whispered Spray to Rex. "You can just hand me that
  gun."</p>

  <p>From the house Nokashima came trotting with great excitement. "Mist' Henry
  delighted with head of lion," he announced proudly. "Expect great comedy when
  exhibit self to visiting firemen."</p>

  <p>"The breaks seem to be coming our way," commented Rex Pebble. "Here,
  Nocka, fill up these gentlemen's glasses." Nocka, still trembling with
  excitement over the amazing courage of Mr. Henry, the smell-less bloodhound,
  poured gurglingly from a tall pitcher with frosted sides. Elmer, less
  scowling, reclined against a pillar of the stone porch, and Joe, blissful as
  a cherub, opened a quiet financial harangue with Major Jaffey.</p>

  <p>"I think," Spray Summers' voice was low in her lover's ear, "that you and
  I might sneak out for a little anniversary. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"You bet!" responded Rex. "Look here, Nocka," he addressed the diminutive
  servant, suppose you take the responsibility of removing those raving hyenas
  in there before the police arrive. Will you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Great pleasure, boss," grinned the Japanese. "Solicit help from Mist' Hal
  and others and make quick work of fire chasers. You beat it." Nokashima's
  vocabulary strained at no gnats for delicacy of expression. Elmer was staring
  thoughtfully into the cool green depths of his glass as Rex and Spray stole
  away in the dark toward the pool. His eyes were large and full of wonder.
  drink</p>

  <p>Nokashima first helped himself to a generous drink and then clapped his
  hands sharply, like a miniature Eastern potentate summoning his slave. "Hi,
  Mist' Henry, hi!" he called. A creature crept out of the shadows, its tail
  drooping, and lifting large sorrowful eyes. He came up to Nokashima,
  plastering his small yellow hand with a bright red tongue of just about the
  same size.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what's the matter with that dog?" asked Hal, the fireman,
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Have suspicions but not plenty evidence for statement," said Nokashima.
  "However, Mist' Henry potentially very fine dog."</p>

  <p>"That's just it," remarked Hal, "and that's exactly where I disagree. I
  don't think he's potentially anything. That is to say, I don't think he's got
  any potentials at all."</p>

  <p>Nokashima sighed with the air of one who is reluctant to accept the truth.
  "If Mist' Henry only develop interest in other bloodhounds," he moaned.
  "Apparently very much one-dog dog. No interest in anyone but me."</p>

  <p>"What did he do with the lion's head?" asked Hal. "Did he chew it up?"</p>

  <p>"No," returned Nokashima more brightly. "Mist' Henry apparently very fond
  of mask. Must have known lion in this or former existence."</p>

  <p>"Here's an idea," proposed Hal. "This dog has some kind of complex. You
  know. I could spell it for you, but it doesn't matter. It's something he
  lacks and keeps thinking about all the time. Like not being able to smell. I
  wouldn't go around with my tail like that if I couldn't smell. We got to show
  Mr. Henry how to be a poker face."</p>

  <p>"That easy," agreed Nokashima eagerly. "Let Mr. Henry wear lion's head for
  some time, get to thinking self lion, maybe roar, certainly sniff, give
  nostrils work-out."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Hal, "but that ain't all." Hal cupped one hand over
  Nokashima's right ear and whispered, "This guy Elmer, he's like Mr. Henry. He
  wants to shoot somebody just to show how big he is. Suppose we get Mr. Henry
  and Elmer to get my pals out. That would be teaming 'em up!" Hal laughed
  softly. He was immensely pleased with his own idea.</p>

  <p>"Gland idea," exclaimed Nokashima enthusiastically. "Combine good and bad
  points of situation. Great aid Mist' Henry and Mist' Elmer; big bounce for
  visiting firemen."</p>

  <p>"I think that idea could be celebrated with a few more drinks, then," said
  Hal, quick to lose no quarter, or cocktail. "Or is there any left?"</p>

  <p>"Always plenty in shakers of Summers house," returned the small fellow
  hospitably. "If no, can go out quickly for more." Nokashima poured liberally
  from the seemingly inexhaustible pitcher that served in place of the silver
  shakers now greatly in demand by the convention of heroes in the kitchen. In
  pouring, he did not spare Elmer, the reluctant drinker who had by this time
  become completely won over to the charms of blood-cheering alcohol and lay
  semiprone against the stone pillar, lost apparently in contemplation of some
  gigantic pilfery.</p>

  <p>On nimble feet Nokashima sped into the house, pitcher in hand, returning
  in a split second with a fresh supply of drinks and the ferocious phony
  lion's head. Mr. Henry, as averred by his faithful friend the Japanese, may
  not have definitely feared the thing, but he certainly displayed no great
  affection for it. Nokashima placed the head on the veranda and urged the
  bloodhound to examine it. With slow, slouching, cautious steps, the lanky
  creature moved round it, drinking in its every repulsive feature with his
  sad, distrustful eyes, and making now and again a pathetic attempt to
  resuscitate his long-lost sense of smell, if such a sense had ever indeed
  thrilled those ponderous nostrils. Mr. Henry turned regretfully to the
  Japanese; he appeared in effect to shake his head. You may have imagined that
  I cared for it, his look seemed to say, and I don't want to disappoint you,
  but heaven knows I can't see why I should have anything whatever to do with
  it. What's it for?</p>

  <p>"Tsch, tsch!" muttered the Oriental, chagrined. "Mist' Henry exhibit no
  distress, but also show no great pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I could hardly say he seemed thrilled," said Hal scathingly. "It's what
  we say about some of the fire horses, there are more plugs than the iron ones
  on the corner. Try putting it on him."</p>

  <p>Nokashima adjusted the grinning lion's head over Mr. Henry's drooping
  visage. Nothing happened. The figure stood still, a ridiculous blend of lion
  and bloodhound, the face looking pleased as Punch, the shaggy knees and legs
  of the brute sagging under its weather-beaten, bone-ridged body. The face
  swung slowly from side to side in a grotesque combination of radiant and
  dismal regard. Take it off, said Mr. Henry, it's no use. I can't smell, I
  have no emotions, as a bloodhound I'm a total wash-out. Nokashima seemed on
  the point of tears. Carefully and tenderly as though he were lifting back the
  shroud of a dear one recently passed away, he removed the lion's mask from
  the drooping bloodhound's shoulders. Mr. Henry had not changed his
  expression; he half stood, half sat, gazing at his proxy master with
  disconsolate incompetence.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Hal, the fireman, "have a drink." He proffered his glass, out
  of sympathy and understanding, to the dog.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea," commented Joe, who, in his absorption with the
  unexpected delights of alcohol so freely dispensed, was beginning to tire of
  Major Lynnhaven Jaffey's steady quiet drone of sales talk on the merits of
  the proposed banking scheme. "And while you're at it, you might give me one
  &mdash;that is, if you can spare it from the cur."</p>

  <p>"Him no cur," defended Nokashima, generously filling Joe's extended glass.
  "Him bloodhound of noble blood greatly afflicted with multitude of sorrows of
  life. No blame for Mist' Henry. Suppose honorable stick-up man unable to
  stick up?"</p>

  <p>"That's Elmer," admitted Joe readily. "Look at him. Dozing. Not doing a
  damned thing. Not even trying to get the lay of the land. I mean that in a
  clean way. Give him a drink too. Let Hal feed the hound a drink and I'll feed
  Elmer one." With none too gentle hands, Joe pried open Elmer's mouth and
  poured a glass of drink into it. Elmer gave no signs of feeling, other than a
  half absent-minded air of gratitude.</p>

  <p>Hal, too, was quick to take Mr. Henry in hand. "Here," said the young
  fireman, "drink this." Mr. Henry sidled over and obediently opened his
  cavernous jaws. The dog wrapped his great tongue around the glass&mdash;in
  fact, so recklessly that Hal clung to the stem with alarm lest he swallow
  glass and all.</p>

  <p>"First time Mist' Henry ever take drink," murmured Nokashima, shaking his
  head as though his sense of morals, whatever they were in their obscure
  Oriental way, had been violated. If it was the first time the dog had taken
  to drink, however, he did not give indication of his inexperience. He lapped
  up the liquid and seemed to call for another round. "My God!" exclaimed Hal,
  examining the glass. "It's a good thing you didn't offer him the bottle. If
  you ask me, I think Mr. Henry's a silent drinker. Let's see what he'll do
  with another one. That one just wet his whistle."</p>

  <p>"Beware drunken bloodhound," warned Nokashima. "Very much alarmed
  consequences Mist' Henry's heavy drink. Never can tell what happen." Hal
  ignored this sage advice. "Rats!" he said, "another drink will do the dog
  good. I think I'll have one with him. Here's to you, Henry, old boy, old
  boy," toasted his companion. The dog responded with what was the nearest
  approach to a smile of joy that anyone remembered to have seen written on his
  features. He gave a cross between a wheeze and a snort, ending in a low,
  melodious howl that brought Elmer's eyes open with a start, cut short the
  Major's monologue and caused a sharp, sudden quiet within the Spray Summers
  ménage. With Mr. Henry's long last note lingering in the air, there was
  dramatic silence for a moment. The hubbub resumed, filling the dark,
  sweet-smelling garden and the veranda with a low buzz that might have been
  made by a ladies' aid society drinking spiked punch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry, licking his lips monstrously, downed his second highball. Eyes
  focused on the creature. Stretching both front legs luxuriously, he wagged
  his head foolishly from side to side and glanced coyly at Hal, his
  benefactor, then at Nokashima, his future source of supply. With a new grace
  the dog ambled over to the Japanese and gazed into the depths of the silver
  pitcher in his hand. "No, no, Mist' Henry," remonstrated Nokashima, throwing
  Hal a reproachful look. "Now see, Mist' Henry practically confirmed drunkard.
  His fate in your hands now." The small yellow man appeared to waive all
  responsibility for the bloodhound, to wash his hands of the whole affair.
  "You put Mist' Henry to bed," he said to Hal.</p>

  <p>"Leave him alone," returned that young man. "I think he's getting on fine.
  That's what's the matter with the brute. You've been sissifying him. What if
  he can't smell? He can drink, can't he? A dog's got to have some kind of
  fun."</p>

  <p>But it was at this point that Mr. Henry really became alarming in
  behavior. With the pitcher upright in Nokashima's hand, it seemed impossible
  to get a drop of liquid out. The dog realized this and made a sudden lunge
  which landed Nokashima, amazed beyond words, in a sitting position on the
  lawn. The pitcher was now on the ground. Mr. Henry tentatively put forth one
  paw to tilt it over. With admirable dispatch Nokashima recovered his bearing.
  He snatched the pitcher off the ground, stubbornly folding his arms about it.
  Mr. Henry seemed to consider, then, with great deliberation, as though he
  wished to injure no one, but was equally determined to have his way, the
  bloodhound laid a ponderous paw on either of the little man's shoulders and
  pressed him to the earth. Just to make his intentions clear, that he bore no
  ill feeling, he swiped his great red tongue twice across the man's face and,
  standing on Nocka's chest, sank his mouth into the pitcher. There was a deep
  gulping sound, like the noise of an old-fashioned cistern when the bucket
  reaches the surface and begins to imbibe water for its return voyage.</p>

  <p>Hal rose hastily and rushed to Nokashima's aid. He was too late. The man
  was not hurt, though stunned. Mr. Henry, having cleaned up the pitcher,
  calmly moved off Nocka's chest and began, first lumberingly, then with a sort
  of childish gayety, to cavort about the lawn. Not since he was a pup, if even
  then, had the bloodhound appeared so full of pep. He tore off apparently in
  pursuit of imaginary bones that had been pitched to him, cutting great
  circles about the lawn and then lunging into the circle of light like a
  locomotive out of a tunnel. With a tremendous bound he leaped across the
  huddled figures of Major Lynnhaven Jaffey and Joe, who were practically
  embracing one another in their panic. Elmer rubbed his eyes as the bounding
  creature stopped long enough to place a thick alcoholic tongue on his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"Great Fujiyama!" exclaimed Nokashima, giving way to his tallest
  expletive. "Mist' Henry mad with drink. How will ever explain to boss unusual
  behavior of pet?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need to worry about that," said Hal as he dodged an
  affectionate forward pass. "Mr. Henry's not anybody's pet now. The world's
  Mr. Henry's pet."</p>

  <p>What to do with a stewed bloodhound? Nokashima called and wheedled. It was
  no use. The creature knew the pitcher was empty, and that was that. Elmer was
  the first member of the party to suffer from serious attack.</p>

  <p>Some instinct&mdash;could it have been a reviving sense of smell?
  &mdash;led the beast to rush the stick-up artist, languishing on the veranda,
  and, pinning him down, to lap up what remained of drink in his glass. It was
  some time before the print of importunate claws smoothed out of Elmer's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Joe!" sang out the attacked one. "You not only stop me from my
  work, but you get me into a dog-fight. What did he do to me, sting me or bite
  me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry sprang happily here and there, racing off into the shadows of
  the garden, only to tear back in search of companions. He would whirl first
  up to one, then to another, until Hal, realizing his desire, timidly ran away
  with the dog. When they emerged a second later from the dark, Hal was limping
  in apparent agony. "He plays too rough," the fireman complained. "I never met
  such a dog. Whose bloodhound is he, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"Mist' Rex' bloodhound," returned Nokashima, "and he going to be plenty
  sore when he sees condition of pet. Heaven knows what Miss Spray say!"</p>

  <p>"The thing to worry about is what we'll do," said Hal, a victim, "because
  this has got to stop. He's a regular lion." Hal stopped short. "Say, that's
  an idea," he exclaimed, "why not put the lion's head on Mr. Henry now? Hell's
  bells, what a lion he'd make!"</p>

  <p>Nokashima was in a quandary. He didn't want to take Mr. Henry indoors in
  this shameful condition, nor did he wish to call for help. The suggestion was
  not a bad one. It would cut off Mr. Henry's sight, and there was no telling
  what might happen. It couldn't be worse than having a mad dog at large on the
  premises. "Here, Mist' Henry, hi, come, nice bloodhound," lured the deceptive
  Japanese, pretending to produce a flask from his pocket. Mr. Henry slowed up
  in a whirling circle, bewildered with doubt. He didn't really know whether he
  should have another drink or not. Enough was enough; he had lost all sense of
  inferiority, and he was certainly the center of attention, if not of alarm.
  Mr. Henry's life long ambition had been to be a catastrophe, and this seemed
  his big chance&mdash;only if he didn't get too tight. One li'l' drink. The
  dog hesitated. He moved cautiously to Nokashima's side.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, from behind, the lion's head was clapped over his shoulders. Mr.
  Henry emitted a long, soul-rending protest that again brought complete
  blanketing silence to the house and its environs. No heart could have heard
  that anguished howl in the night without missing a beat.</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry had put his whole being into it, a magnificent, ravishing cry of
  outraged merriment, but it did not produce results. The lion's head stayed
  on. Fortunately for Mr. Henry, though he could not see, he could breathe
  through the lion's nostrils. He snorted and uttered a second howl. There was
  silence. Mr. Henry felt a grey surge of disgust sweep over him. What bad
  sports humans were! Here they go and get a bloodhound tight and then they
  wouldn't play. It wasn't fair. Everything began to seem muddled and confused;
  Mr. Henry's canine values were completely upset. He felt like running right
  out of the garden gate and never coming back. By gosh, thought Mr. Henry, he
  would&mdash;and forthwith he started at a gallop in the direction of what he
  imagined must be the gate.</p>

  <p>In all fairness to his human playmates, or drunken associates, it must be
  said that Mr. Henry was properly warned. As the hound leaped off into the
  darkness, it is possible that Nokashima, spiritually psychic to the demands
  of inebriated characters, canine or human, may have guessed his intention.
  That is, to make off with himself, out into the great wide world, where no
  bloodhound is obliged to drink white man's liquor and not have white man's
  fun.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," shouted the house man to the rapidly retreating figure. "If
  wish long sprint in woods, do not head for fountain."</p>

  <p>"God knows what that crazy mutt will do next," complained Hal, rubbing his
  thigh. "He certainly stepped all over me."</p>

  <p>"What you expect?" demanded the Japanese man curtly. "You kennel snatcher!
  Go feed nice dog all gin&mdash;best Tom Collins Nokashima made in three
  summers&mdash;and expect him to behave as in Book of Etiquette. I only uneasy
  about Mist' Henry's whereabouts now."</p>

  <p>"The dog has had three drinks or more," put in Major Jaffey. The confusion
  had been a great break for Joe, for in the midst of the clamor he had been
  able to remove himself somewhat from the Major's wave length and no longer
  had drilled into him comparative bank earnings for the last ten years. "I've
  only had four, and I'm not nearly so well behaved. If I had my youth back
  again, I'd scamper around the yard and do somersaults myself."</p>

  <p>At this moment there was a loud splash. It was the sort of sound that
  could only be made by the unexpected contact of a whirling object with a
  large expanse of water. The splash was quickly followed by a loud and
  terrible howl.</p>

  <p>"Something dreadfully wrong now," remarked Nokashima with fatalistic
  philosophy. "No ordinary dive. That accident of two bodies&mdash;water and
  other body."</p>

  <p>"Could that poor hound have jumped into the &mdash;" Joe left his question
  unanswered. It was quite clear what had happened: Mr. Henry had taken the
  wrong direction. He had headed straight into the garden pool.</p>

  <p>"The poor brute," commiserated Major Jaffey. "I do hope that he has not
  drowned himself."</p>

  <p>"Poor brute more likely drowned if stayed in present company than in
  pool," commented Nokashima dryly. "Other people's liquor flow freely."</p>

  <p>"That was a crack," interposed Joe, "which I have no idea of hearing.
  Consider it erased, rubbed out. Wiped off."</p>

  <p>From the direction of the pool came another howl, this howl curiously less
  distinct. There were no further splashings. Nokashima and Hal were collecting
  themselves with an idea of stopping this bloodhound suicide, if that was his
  idea, when an object emerged from the darkness that would have stopped a
  magician in Baghdad. Half lion, half pup, it pranced up, wagging its stubby
  tail and begging for affection.</p>

  <p>"You can't tell me," said Joe rubbing his eyes, "that bloodhounds breed
  that fast. And even if I believed that, I wouldn't believe they'd be born
  with fake lions' heads on. What a nightmare!" Joe hid his eyes.</p>

  <p>The joyous malformation, which seemed utterly delighted with life, was
  undoubtedly the old Mr. Henry, now become a new Mr. Henry. His small sleek
  backsides wiggled mischievously, and his tail stood up as pert and emphatic
  as an exclamation point. His body was thin, like a colt's, but there was
  youth in it, and a careless abandon that was completely new to Mr. Henry.</p>

  <p>"Only one thing do now," said Nokashima, as the first to recover his wits,
  "and that, use Mist' Henry to help scare away firemen."</p>

  <p>"I want to be in on this." Hal rose and followed Nokashima, who was
  leading Mr. Henry toward the house. "I've always felt some of the fellows
  needed stirring up, and now I want to see how they'll take it."</p>

  <p>"Bring Elmer," Major Jaffey instructed Joe, "because we want to let him
  see how a real stick-up is staged, and after that, if there's anything left,
  we'll let him play with that pistol of his." Joe, practically shouldering
  Elmer, staggered in the rear of the procession.</p>

  <p>To firemen, absent from the station for hours in search of a blaze that
  never appeared, and lured away from the gentle art of fire-fighting by such
  odd-pursuits as blotting up a few drinks and playing around with a French
  maid, the sudden sight of a Japanese face is not calculated to improve public
  confidence. And if, in addition to all these things, the face be accompanied
  by a bounding half-dog, half-lion affair, the effect is likely to be quite
  upsetting. Such was the combined effect of Nokashima and Mr. Henry when
  Elmer, pressing jealously to the fore, produced his gun and brandished it in
  the doorway. The place was cleared instantly. There were several hurried
  words of protest, but for the most part the kitchen and the premises were
  clean-swept of firemen.</p>

  <p>"Holy mackerel!" whispered the station lieutenant, "if that isn't Hal with
  them!"</p>

  <p>"The house is screwy, Lieutenant," advised another, who helped to lead in
  the disorderly retreat of the department. "I've known that ever since that
  girl Fifi got started."</p>

  <p>"Got started what?" Even in his haste the lieutenant could not suppress
  his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Oh, surprising a fellow with pretty intimate business now and then,
  especially as a fellow goes to sit down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that," said the lieutenant. "Come on, we'll never get away if we
  start to talk about the monkey business of this house, including that
  gal."</p>

  <p>"What have we been drinking?" asked one fellow in consternation, as he
  peered from his hiding place behind the large electric stove. "I thought
  there was something wrong about getting this whole joint free, including the
  French one."</p>

  <p>"That was wrong to begin with," whispered the lieutenant, who crouched
  beside the man. "What is the creature? I seem to remember having seen the Jap
  before."</p>

  <p>"I'd say it's half and half," was the answer. "Half beast and half pet.
  That is, if it's real."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry, filled with drink and the glamour of youth, roped about the
  kitchen, practically dragging Nokashima after him. Fifi, still preoccupied
  with the cocktail shaker, over which, in the absence of Nokashima, she had
  been mistress, had not noticed the uproar. Firemen are apt to do anything,
  Fifi had learned, and they seemed always ready to start off at the sound of a
  gong. Something came nosing at her back. "Go 'way," said the girl. "Now, now,
  go 'way." She reached behind her, intending to slap the playful fireman, when
  her hand encountered something new and strange. It was somewhat bearded, it
  had an unusually large mouth, even for a fireman. Fifi raised her hand a bit.
  No fireman that she knew had such heavy brows. There was a loud sniff, a
  sniff like a dog. Fifi thought with scorn of Mr. Henry and his lack of
  smelling ability; at least, if the house was beset with firemen, there
  weren't any dogs around. The girl helped herself to a small drink and looked
  around, charitably intending to give the playful fellow a taste of her
  highball.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mon Dieu!" the cry rang throughout the building. Rex Pebble and Spray
  Summers, blissfully resting beside the pool, heard it and started for the
  house. They could hardly believe it, but it seemed that something was either
  happening or about to happen which they had never imagined possible with a
  Frenchwoman.</p>

  <p>"Take eet away," cried the girl. "Eet is hor-ri-ble. You feelthy man!" she
  screeched at Nokashima. Mr. Henry was delighted with this show of attention.
  He bounded about the prostrate girl, quite out of control, and in touching
  the corners of the room, caused the heroes of many fires to cower in their
  hiding places. For the first time in her experience Fifi willingly embraced a
  Japanese. With a quick motion she grabbed the little man and clung to him in
  terror.</p>

  <p>Rex and Spray at this moment appeared in the door-way. The room was a
  wreck. Glasses graced the floor, over which Mr. Henry tore in ecstasy, tail
  waggling, lion's head tossing. Fifi hid her eyes on Nokashima's shoulder.</p>

  <p>There was hardly a sign of a fireman, except for stray helmets here and
  there, and a coat or two piled on the stove.</p>

  <p>With amazement the mistress of the house gazed on the scene of recent
  revelry, and at the creature which romped about the room.</p>

  <p>"If I didn't recognize the symptoms," said Spray, "I wouldn't know what it
  was."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry paused for a second to whiff generously at his mistress's feet.
  It was a new sensation for the creature. He drew enormous breaths and smelled
  rapturously. It was as though a man long blind for the first time beheld the
  sunlight. Mr. Henry, restored to puppydom, had regained his sense of smell.
  And he meant to use it.</p>

  <p>"Well, he seems to be shaking a mean nostril at your feet," said Rex. "You
  lose your corns, and Mr. Henry regains his smell. That's fair."</p>

  <p>"Let's forget my corns," retorted Spray, "and see what can be done to
  clear up this bacchanale. Here, Henry old fellow," she said, picking up a
  fireman's helmet, "smell this out."</p>

  <p>The bloodhound took an eager whiff and reeled off. From corners firemen
  emerged.</p>

  <p>"Not that I don't want to be hospitable," called Spray as they poured
  forth into the night, "but it's time all good firemen got to bed."</p>

  <p>"Is this Elmer's cue?" inquired Joe enthusiastically from the doorway.
  "Can he hold up the Fire Department? He's rarin' to go."</p>

  <p>Nokashima, pushing the weeping Fifi away, hastened after the exiting
  firemen. "That our idea, madam," he said over his shoulder. "Mist' Elmer
  devote pistol to fleeing figures."</p>

  <p>Elmer leered in the doorway, a face in the night. In trembling fingers he
  held a revolver. "Can I now?" he asked. "Can I let 'em have it?"</p>

  <p>"I think that would be a very fitting climax to the party," remarked Rex
  Pebble. "Yes, let 'em have it." Elmer whirled about unsteadily. There were
  loud reports on the night air, and in the distance much shouting of
  unmentionable words.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry like March," philosophized Nokashima, "come in like lamb, go
  out like lion." For mingled with Elmer's shots was a clamor like the far-off
  baying of the hounds in a posse pursuit of escaping convicts.</p>

  <p>Spray Summers calmly, with hands on slim, alluring hips, surveyed the
  scene of hilarity. It was anything but a house beautiful, but it never lacked
  for excitement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">12. SUE TURNS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sue Pebble was Rex Pebble's wife. She had been that for
  twenty-one years. Obdurately, determinedly, Rex Pebble's wife. There had been
  times, in those years, when Sue's patience had been strained to the breaking
  point, but she never gave up. Start a thing, you must finish it, was Sue's
  philosophy, even if in name only. She liked being Mrs. Rex Pebble, she liked
  the house she lived in, she was not blind to her husband's faults, and best
  of all, she was not blind to her own. Mrs. Pebble liked her fun and could
  take it. Though her heart line may have somewhat resembled the twisting
  course of the Snake River during the years of her marriage with Rex, she had
  at least pursued a tangent of tacit honesty, and she had made Rex a good
  home.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pebble glanced about the spacious, well-appointed living room.
  Violently addicted to change in a great many different things, perhaps her
  best expression of this attitude had been in the quick adoption and equally
  rapid scrapping of various modes of house furnishings. This room, like Mrs.
  Pebble's emotions, had gone through regimes of horsehair, mission, antique,
  and Colonial. The room was now modern. It was hard but not harsh, with its
  pleasing tubular curves of gleaming metal and its soft, downy corduroy
  upholstery. Mrs. Pebble looked about her with evident satisfaction, while in
  a small mirror that she held in her hand she proceeded to make up her race.
  There was some contrast here. There were few modern lines in Sue Pebble's
  face. Sue had reached fifty-five years of age, and despite her often frantic
  efforts to deceive, on close observation she looked it.</p>

  <p>For instance, there was her hair. It was blond. It had been blond
  originally, but it was a white blond now. If Sue had not developed so
  watertight a system for regular visits to her hairdresser's her hair would
  probably have showed more white than blond. As it was, she out-Harlowed
  Harlow. And the mouth. There was a certain tense, fierce expression about it,
  as though Sue Pebble hardly dared laugh out loud for fear something might
  crack or chip. She wore a high collar that flared around the upper reaches of
  her throat. Her lips were carefully outlined with sharp bright scarlet. Sue
  spent a great many hours a day in the huntress's passionate pursuit of
  beauty.</p>

  <p>It was with no pleasure that she gazed into the little mirror. Damn it,
  thought Sue, you can do wonders with your figure, but what can you do with
  your face? Considering everything, her face was about the best it could be,
  but it was not exactly satisfactory from any standpoint.</p>

  <p>With pent-up resentment, Sue Pebble thought of her husband. Rex was older
  than she, but he carried his years with a great deal more ease and grace. He
  was a distinguished old devil, she thought, and he certainly didn't deserve
  the break the years were giving him. These considerations led inevitably to a
  question that always lay smoldering, not to say blazing cheerily, in Sue's
  mind. How did that woman Spray Summers, the hussy, keep her hold on Rex
  Pebble? Sue thought of Spray with very little envy, so she imagined, but with
  an amazing amount of curious respect. Simply out of professional regard, she
  was constantly pricked with amazement at this phenomenon. There had been
  quite a few men in Sue Pebble's married life, but, drat them, she thought,
  they had always folded their tents and silently stolen away. Spray was only a
  few years younger than Sue, yet she held a firm grip on the woman's husband.
  What in heaven's name, Sue wondered, did they do all the time&mdash;all those
  long evenings on which, with the poorest excuses, Rex Pebble stole away to be
  with his mistress?</p>

  <p>Sue's questions and her little game of make-up were suddenly interrupted
  by the sound of the doorbell. Pretty late, she considered, as she rose to go
  to the door, but one could never tell what doorbells at late hours might
  produce.</p>

  <p>It was just Kippie, Rex Pebble's twenty-three-year-old nephew, who looked
  so much like his uncle at the same age that Sue almost started with surprise
  every time she saw the boy.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want at this hour?" the woman demanded. "You know very
  well where your uncle is!"</p>

  <p>"I don't," lied Kippie glibly, "and besides, might I not sometimes wish to
  see my charming aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Stop it, stop it," said Sue glumly. "I can't listen to any such words as
  those after the inventory I've just been giving myself."</p>

  <p>"What, scoring up your lines again, you old witch?" said the young devil.
  "You ought to go out with me some time. I'll bet I could add a few curves of
  surprise to your collection."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, you couldn't," retorted Sue. "You look too darned much like your
  uncle to add a thing to my experience. I could keep one jump ahead of you in
  anything you did."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that sounds very nice," said Kippie, "but I'll give you
  credit for the best sort of meaning. By the way, what do you mean, I should
  know where Rex, that old fox, is at this hour?"</p>

  <p>"It's the children's hour, isn't it?" demanded Sue Pebble. "And besides
  that, it's an occasion. Twenty years ago tonight my husband seduced his
  lifelong mistress. You can imagine with what misgivings I sit alone at home.
  I'm glad you came: we might have some fun."</p>

  <p>Kippie's young face, so disturbingly handsome to the woman, was puckered
  with doubt.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't care what the occasion is," he remarked with a curious note
  of concern, "but I've got to see the old codger. Something's up on the
  market. We might be wiped out. You know, stranded at the bread line."</p>

  <p>Sue Pebble's nose showed that she had caught the scent. Only one thing
  could give her quite the look of quiet determination that was printed on her
  features. She rose from her chair and started toward the telephone. "I know
  the number," she said. "In crises, whenever I've had to get that man in a
  hurry, I've imitated everything from a Negro maid to a taxi driver. I only
  hope I don't get that slant-eyed Japanese master of lies on the phone, as I
  did one night."</p>

  <p>"Here," said Kippie, catching up with her and detaining her. "Don't do
  that. Phoning won't do any good. I've got to talk with Uncle Rex in person.
  This is serious."</p>

  <p>"Well," returned Sue, "what did you come here for?"</p>

  <p>Kippie ran his fingers through glossy brown hair. "The truth is," he said,
  "I saw the light as I drove past, and I just wondered what you were doing. I
  thought you might be in for a little adventure."</p>

  <p>"Adventure?" inquired Sue, pricking up her ears. "Precisely what kind of
  adventure? Are there men involved?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got to see Uncle Rex, and we know where he is, and this is
  sort of an anniversary"&mdash;Kippie told the story in one breath&mdash; "and
  I thought it might be a lot of fun just to drop by and pay our respects
  &mdash;that is, your respects."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned," said his aunt. "I think that calls for a drink."
  She started for the pantry. "And I don't know but that I'll take you up on
  that," her words floated back from the door.</p>

  <p>So it was that several shakers later Sue Pebble, accompanied by a young
  man strangely resembling the youthful Rex Pebble, set forth for the home of
  Spray Summers. The ride, due to their condition of heightened gayety, was a
  fairly hilarious one, over a course that wove perilously around corners and
  through red lights that continued to blink their reproach at the fast
  retreating car.</p>

  <p>"So this is the love nest?" said Sue Pebble as they drew up with a shriek
  of brakes in front of the house with the garden and the pool in which her
  enterprising husband had installed his mistress. "I think they ought to have
  Japanese lanterns out, or flags in front, or a band playing." She added, "How
  do you suppose they're celebrating?"</p>

  <p>"I'm too young to answer that one, Auntie," said Kippie, "but I can use my
  imagination, or should I?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," answered Sue. "I see lights, and I think I hear music. There
  must be other guests. I hope I shan't have the pleasure of meeting his other
  wives calling on my husband's mistress, or is that too confusing?"</p>

  <p>"The morals of this family would tax the English language," said Kippie,
  "and I haven't even begun to tell you about mine."</p>

  <p>"Take it from one who knows," advised his aunt, "and stay single. Rex has
  been going along for years under the false impression that three can live as
  cheaply as one."</p>

  <p>"All I hope is," Kippie said wistfully, "that they have as good liquor as
  the old girl had the last time I was here."</p>

  <p>"Am I the other old girl when not present?" asked his aunt sternly.</p>

  <p>"Nope," answered Kippie blithely, "I just call you old soak and let it go
  at that."</p>

  <p>The woman and her youthful escort stole quietly through the little garden
  gate that so lately had been the scene of a near hold-up and an impromptu
  cocktail party. The gravel of the walk crunched under their feet as they
  neared the door. "Shall we ring," inquired Rex Pebble's wife, "or just break
  in? I seem to lack the proper etiquette for calling on the mistress of one's
  husband, particularly on the anniversary of her seduction. I daresay I won't
  be any more welcome for the anniversary present I sent, either." Sue tittered
  with mirth. "Bedroom slippers&mdash;for her corns. Best wishes from Sue
  Pebble."</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Kippie, who was familiar with the house. "Let's just slip
  in the side door." They entered a reception hall, from which a stairway ran
  up to the second floor. It was dark and smelled strongly of whisky and burned
  clothing. There was a faint whiff of dog about the place, also. "There's been
  a party," observed the young man, "and someone got burned."</p>

  <p>"I hope it was that wench," returned Sue Pebble uncharitably. "I can
  hardly wait to see her in her bedroom slippers, sitting by the fire."</p>

  <p>"They're upstairs," remarked Kippie. "Let's go on up."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool. I may be the man's wife, but I know when I'm not
  wanted."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come on, we'll surprise them."</p>

  <p>"I should think so."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like to be surprised?"</p>

  <p>"I have been. That's why I'm a wife in name only."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Kippie, taking Sue Pebble's hand and urging her up the
  stairs, "turn about's fair play."</p>

  <p>They tiptoed up the stairs in a spirit of jovial fun, hoping that the
  upper floor would yield the highballs of which it seemed to smell so
  generously. Suddenly a door was thrust open and a small dark form padded
  toward them along the dimly lit hall. At its heels followed a creature of
  jagged outline, which appeared to be a misfit head on a very gay animal body
  of four legs and a joyously wagging tail. Still in the rear were two figures
  with locked arms. The leader of this miniature parade bore what was
  unmistakably a cocktail shaker. The figure hesitated; so did the procession.
  A light switched on.</p>

  <p>"Hi!" Nokashima greeted the newcomers. "Unaccustomed to receive guests on
  upper story, but this pleasant surprise. How do, Mist' Kippie." The years had
  only added to Nokashima's stolid Eastern philosophy. If people wished to keep
  coming to call all night, that was too bad but unavoidable; and if they
  wished to insinuate themselves into the more intimate apartments of the
  house, they might hold themselves responsible for shock, not him.</p>

  <p>"I think, in view of your perpetual rudeness and deceit over the
  telephone," said Sue, advancing on the diminutive figure, "that you may just
  pass over that shaker."</p>

  <p>Nokashima clung to the object. "Very special property, this," he returned.
  "Never allow out of personal hands."</p>

  <p>"I'll get personal with your hands," cried Sue, snatching the shaker.
  "That's right, Auntie," cheered Kippie, "let her have it, Nocka. I think Mrs.
  Pebble should be given the run of the house."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, my good woman!" remonstrated Major Jaffey, stepping forward,
  "and who may you be?" A slight tussle over the shaker seemed imminent.</p>

  <p>"I might ask the same of you," returned the woman, "if I didn't think it
  would be wasting good breath. I haven't the slightest idea who you are, but I
  would suggest that you just pick up your feet and carry them on downstairs.
  I'm going to have a good big highball and then take a look around for my
  husband. I want to congratulate him."</p>

  <p>Major Jaffey was visibly taken back. So were Rex Pebble and Spray Summers,
  who stood only a few feet distant from Sue Pebble, just on the inside of a
  studio door. Spray called the room a studio: it was where she kept a choice
  assortment of spirits, vinous and alcoholic.</p>

  <p>"In that case," the Major was humbled, "I suppose I'll just breeze along
  downstairs. Coming, Hal?" The fireman and the Major pressed past Mrs. Pebble
  somewhat fearfully, while Nokashima hurried off for glasses.</p>

  <p>"Back in a minute, Auntie," said Kippie. "I think I'll see that we get the
  proper size of highball. They're a little backward sometimes around
  here."</p>

  <p>Sue seemed torn between a desire to investigate the home of her husband's
  mistress and an appetite for the contents of the shaker. She reached for the
  nearest door-knob and turned it slightly. Rex Pebble and Spray Summers, on
  the other side of the door, hastily retreated. "I think I'd better go and see
  what I can do about her," whispered Rex.</p>

  <p>"Get rid of the old hag as soon as you can," returned Spray. "What poor
  taste to come at this hour!" Spray drew her lace gown about her lovely young
  form. "I wish she could have come with the milkman."</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised that she didn't," said Rex knowingly.</p>

  <p>Spray stood back of the door, and Rex slipped into the hall. The man was
  quite unprepared for the reception that greeted him.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" remarked Sue Pebble sharply. "No tricks, now. Quit jumping in and
  out of doors."</p>

  <p>"I'm not jumping in and out of doors," the woman's husband answered in an
  astonished voice. He was astonished both at her remark and at the apparent
  calm with which she greeted him. Rex had been ready to weather a tempest of
  wrath.</p>

  <p>"Well, what did you go in there for"&mdash;Sue pointed to the door through
  which Kippie had vanished&mdash;"and then come out here? Don't think I've had
  that many."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't put it past you," answered Rex, both vexed and mystified at
  his wife's behavior.</p>

  <p>"Something's come over you since you came in this house, young man,"
  remarked Sue Pebble sternly, "and I just want to warn you not to get fresh.
  You brought me here, it was your idea&mdash;be a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I never said a word about your coming here. In fact, I hoped you never
  would come here," said Rex.</p>

  <p>"Look here, this has gone far enough. Did you or didn't you suggest that
  we come to see that hussy, Spray Summers?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't. What makes you think I did?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more nor less than my ears," snapped Sue. "You may think I'm
  older than you, but I'm not deaf."</p>

  <p>"I have no reason whatever to think that you're deaf. But I could show you
  a thing or two."</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at?" asked Sue acidly. "I'm beginning to think that
  I'm loose with a madman. After all the things that I've done for you, that
  you should lure me to this evil place and then begin to play practical jokes
  on me." Sue Pebble was approaching the point of tears. Looking at this
  attractive young male, she could only think of her husband as she had first
  met him, and it was a pleasurably poignant memory.</p>

  <p>"In addition to jumping in and out of doors," Sue reproached, "you have to
  go around without any clothes on. Whose pajamas are those?"</p>

  <p>A light of realization began to dawn in Rex Pebble's eyes. So Sue thought
  he was Kippie. For the first time during the whole adventurous evening he
  could see himself in someone else's eyes, as he must really look, though
  Spray's point of view, it must be admitted, was a bit colored by prejudice
  and emotion.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Rex in a kindly tone, "I think there's a mistake been
  made. Come with me into the bedroom." Rex started toward a door across the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"That would make two mistakes," Sue's voice was tart, "and I want to tell
  you that, broad-minded as I am, I'll brook no incest, even by marriage."</p>

  <p>"Come in here and I'll tell you a secret," coaxed Rex.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," returned Sue, "and I think the quicker you stop this
  foolishness, young man, the better it will be for you. Just wait till I find
  your uncle, or did he put you up to this?"</p>

  <p>Something slipped a cog in Rex Pebble's mind. He was overwhelmed with
  mirth at the oddity of the situation. Rex laughed loudly. "He certainly did,
  the old devil," he exclaimed, snatching Sue off her feet and bearing her
  through the bedroom door. There were screams in the hall which the closing
  door muffled.</p>

  <p>Young Kippie, from where he stood matching glasses with Nokashima, heard
  the screams and came running into the hall. Spray Summers heard them too and
  also rushed into the hall. The two bumped into each other, then stopped in
  surprise. Before him Kippie saw a lovely creature in a thin lace gown, ready
  for bed. His eyes swept her; he was moved to speech.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," remarked the young man, "this is a pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I think you're getting too accustomed to things," said the young woman.
  "What did the old hag say?" "What old hag?" asked the puzzled Kippie.</p>

  <p>"Sue, you fool, your wife," said Spray Summers.</p>

  <p>"I have no wife," Kippie returned. Then, after glancing up and down the
  lovely, appealing figure, he said abruptly, "I want to come in with you. May
  I?"</p>

  <p>"What for?" snapped back Spray. "Are you mad or am I?"</p>

  <p>"Just for fun," answered the very forward young-man. "Oh, that." A pause.
  "Come on in." Spray's graceful hand stretched toward him.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, if you please," said the voice of Rex Pebble, issuing from
  the opposite bedroom door.</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" said Spray, staring at Rex and realizing her mistake. "I
  thought he was you. How careless of me. I'll have to watch my step. You look
  so much alike."</p>

  <p>"Hold on," said the disappointed Kippie. "I thought I was myself, but
  apparently I'm that guy. Who are we, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not," answered Spray, "he's your darling uncle Rex, and I
  am the mistress known as Spray. A miracle has given us back our youth, and we
  are preparing to make the best of it."</p>

  <p>"No, you're not, hussy," Sue Pebble chimed in, appearing behind her
  husband in the doorway. "If I have to tear his body limb from limb, I'll get
  the secret of this rejuvenation out of him, and use it myself." The woman
  threw Rex Pebble a fierce look. "Then I'll make the best of it!"</p>

  <p>"You may have the secret, my dear," said the woman's husband, "if I can
  give it to you. I'm beginning to think it's more of a curse than a blessing.
  Particularly to be sane and yet young. The two don't mix."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they don't, don't they?" interrupted Spray Summers hotly. "Well,
  fancy that! Only two minutes ago you were standing on the other side of that
  door&mdash;a <i>bedroom</i> door&mdash;suggesting things to me that I hadn't
  considered for years, and now here you are&mdash;telling your wife &mdash;the
  old cow&mdash;that you're cursed with youth. It wasn't youth you were cursed
  with two minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Well, if he wasn't cursed with youth, just what was he cursed with?"
  inquired Sue Pebble. Her tone had that icy cordiality which women hold in
  reserve for their most bitterly detested rivals. "Just what <i>was</i> he
  cursed with?"</p>

  <p>"For my part," said Spray, raising her voice, "I wouldn't say that he was
  <i>cursed</i> with anything. But whatever it was, it was something you
  haven't known about for a long, long time."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know everything that goes on in our home?" Sue shot back at
  her rival.</p>

  <p>"I certainly know everything that does not go on in your home. And I do
  know what goes on in my home."</p>

  <p>"Make up your minds, girls," Kippie cut in genially. "Decide between you
  where something does go on. It's important."</p>

  <p>"You keep your trap shut, you young whipper-snapper," Sue hissed. "I'll
  thank you to keep out of what you've gotten me into. As for you, Rex Pebble,"
  the woman flung at him, "I should think you'd be ashamed to go around jazzing
  up your body like that! You should be content to grow old gracefully."</p>

  <p>"Like whom?" Spray's quiet young voice bit into the controversy.</p>

  <p>"Like me," Sue snapped back. "I've had my fun and I don't go around like a
  chameleon, changing colors all the time."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you put that red on your lips, either, or were just
  threatening to tear Rex Pebble limb from limb unless you could discover the
  secret of youth?"</p>

  <p>"Since I've seen how young blood goes to old heads, I've learned a
  lesson." Sue spat out the words, but they deceived no one. With wonder and
  envy she looked upon Spray's body that glowed with beauty and vitality. There
  they stood, elderly blonde and young brunette, Rex Pebble's public and
  private life, his lost world and his world regained, while the man gazed from
  one to the other in silent bewilderment. Never could there have been a
  greater contrast between two women, yet their behavior was strikingly alike.
  Both wanted the man and were ready to do battle for him, even to his chagrin
  and embarrassment. Rex glanced at Kippie. Surprise and a little horror were
  written on the young man's face.</p>

  <p>"Listen," Rex whispered. "Let's skip the tournament and get a drink." The
  two stole away downstairs, Nokashima following in awed silence. A few minutes
  later they were comfortably ensconced in the kitchen, scene of late
  merriment, all thoughts of the battle lost to mind. Hal and the Major toasted
  the new arrivals.</p>

  <p>Upstairs Spray Summers had the parting shot as she prepared to retire into
  her bedroom and close the door temporarily upon this disconcerting woman.</p>

  <p>"Incidentally," Spray remarked, "you might just drop that cocktail shaker.
  No wonder some people get such queer ideas in their heads. I'm sorry for
  anyone who can't take his drinks." The door closed none too gently.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you later," promised Sue Pebble between clenched teeth, "and
  when I do, you won't know me, even if I have to cut my hair."</p>

  <p>For the second time that evening Sue was on the verge of tears. It was all
  so bewildering, and she felt so left out of things. What was the secret? How
  had they done it? Did she have a chance in the world of catching up with this
  curious parade of youth? Sue felt very sorry for herself. It was
  extraordinary, too, how possessive she had become about Rex. She was
  wondering at the whole state of affairs and, in desperation, considering a
  drink out of the shaker which she still held when a soft hand slipped its
  fingers into hers.</p>

  <p>"I heard the whole thing, my dear," murmured a pleasant feminine voice,
  "and I don't blame you a bit. For fifteen years I was shut up in stone and
  never had a chance. It's terrible."</p>

  <p>Sue Pebble turned and stared. The girl beside her was young and beautiful
  in a classic, glowing sort of way. She had long hair, wound about her head,
  and she moved with a flowing rhythm that was unlike anything Sue had ever
  seen. However, Sue winced at the expression "shut up in stone."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me," she admonished, "that you've been shut up in a tomb and
  have just come to life. I couldn't stand it. Too many awful things have been
  happening around here."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting, if you ask me," said Baggage, the garden piece. "That
  is, if you like firemen. It just happened that I brought one upstairs with
  me. He wasn't run out with the rest. He's gone to sleep in there." She
  indicated a door.</p>

  <p>"Of course, nothing that you say makes the slightest sense to me,"
  remarked Sue, "but then I'm getting used to that. I don't understand about
  the fireman or the stone or anything," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," suggested this unusual girl, "and I'll tell you a story
  that will curl your hair. Besides, if you're a good listener I'll give you a
  secret you'd very much like to know." Baggage led the way downstairs and out
  into the garden, meanwhile telling the tale of her sudden overpowering
  impulse to leap into the glorious pool, and its consequences.</p>

  <p>They drew near the pool. Sue stared with envious fascination at the calm
  water, gently ruffled by the breeze.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be as young as that other bi&mdash; I mean wench&mdash;
  you see your husband told me not to say 'bitch'&mdash;why, just swim across
  the pool, and you'll have it."</p>

  <p>"Have what?" Sue inquired.</p>

  <p>"It," repeated Baggage. "Isn't that what you were wishing for just now?
  Youth, beauty, sex appeal, or what have you these days. Anyway, you'll be
  like the other one in there." This she said with a wave of her slim white
  hand toward the house.</p>

  <p>Sue was skeptical but interested. Between the lines of the girl's story,
  which recounted so many years of gazing wistfully out at men from a cold
  beautiful stone face, and of watching the playful antics of couples on this
  very lawn, she could read genuine longing and convincing desire. She was
  inclined to believe the fantastic tale, if for no other reason than that the
  creature seemed to tell it out of such a wistful sort of memory.</p>

  <p>"Why are you telling me this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The gods only know, perhaps," said Baggage. "But I think I'm jealous.
  And, anyway, you're his wife, and it will even things up a bit if you both
  are young together. Not only even things up, but make them much livelier, and
  I love excitement!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was what was in the shaker, but whatever it was, or is, I'm
  diving in that pool," said Mrs. Pebble. "The only thing I can get is a cold
  in the head and my clothes wet, if your recipe doesn't work, and if it does
  &mdash;well&mdash;let the fireworks fly!"</p>

  <p>So saying, Sue Pebble, who had not swum with such enthusiasm in years,
  plunged into the silvery water. For a moment she stood poised, as though
  experiencing a new sensation. A delighted smile began to spread over her
  features, which even in the dusky light of the garden appeared magically to
  take on new attractions. The woman dipped her head beneath the surface and
  came up beaming.</p>

  <p>"Something's happening," she shouted with joy, as with new life and vigor
  she began to streak across the pool. An inscrutable Mona Lisa expression grew
  on the lips of Baggage. For soon, on the other side of the pool, stood a girl
  who, even in the wet baggy clothes of a middle-aged woman, was a creature of
  infinite blond beauty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">13. MAN INTO CHILD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The new and lovely edition of Sue, Mrs. Rex Pebble, stood
  beside the magic pool, rinsing her soaked garments and regretting not a whit
  the miraculous plunge that had caused her to ruin one of her favorite gowns.
  Sue ran admiring hands over her hips. They were beautifully rounded, svelte
  but well filled, the kind of hips that make cotton look like silk and $17.75
  resemble a straight $75. No more lying awake nights planning how to infuse
  youth into her clothes; no more anguished early mornings of strenuous
  exercise, or evenings of denying herself the fatal sweets that add
  weight.</p>

  <p>"Look," called Sue Pebble in a voice so musical that it surprised herself,
  "did you ever see anything neater?"</p>

  <p>She indicated her bust with a proud gesture.</p>

  <p>"Very good," commented Baggage across the water,</p>

  <p>"but I think I'm pretty neat myself." The girl abruptly lifted her skirts,
  revealing ankles and limbs of graceful beauty. They were, however, somewhat
  on the classical mold, while Sue Pebble's rejuvenated form was nothing more
  nor less than the lusciously appealing, smoothly curved figure of a girl in
  the deceptive neighborhood of twenty.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," returned Sue; "You ought to be beautiful. You've been in this
  pool all your life."</p>

  <p>"A hell of a lot of good it did me," came back the sharp answer. "I'd like
  to know what fun the Venus de Milo ever had. All that ever happened to her
  was to have her block knocked off." Baggage, out of bitter experience, was
  deeply scornful of the ways of art.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, my dear," said Sue, in the voice of half-abstraction which a
  beautiful woman uses while she is engaged in examining her figure, "whether
  you have ever looked at the Venus closely enough?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've been chipped myself," said Baggage, "but that's just by
  curiosity-seekers, people you'd meet in any museum. It's no more damaging
  than riding in a taxi&mdash;I should say less so, on the whole. What I mean
  is, there I was locked up in stone for fifteen years, watching everyone else
  have fun, while some of them actually used to laugh at me."</p>

  <p>"They did?" inquired Sue, but her tone revealed only perfunctory interest.
  Sue preened here and there, removing wet garments from time to time to get as
  much look at her new-found loveliness as she possibly could.</p>

  <p>She began to wish desperately for a full-length mirror.</p>

  <p>"They used to snicker and say, 'Wonder what that old gal would do if she
  could get down off her pedestal?'"</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, wasn't that just what you were thinking yourself?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly was," answered Baggage, "but it was the way they used to say
  it that burned me up. Of course, my clothes were old-fashioned, but, after
  all, you can't keep up with the styles if no one will send a sculptor around.
  Besides, those men do have the most awfully phooey ideas. A sash here and a
  bow there, and they call it class. Personally, I think clothes are heaven's
  greatest gift to man. I'd rather tantalize any day than give away the whole
  show the first time I see a man."</p>

  <p>This bit of philosophy seemed to give Mrs. Pebble pause. She shook out her
  tousled golden curls and a strange light came into her china-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Sue, "you start me to thinking. I believe I'll actually
  have to borrow some of that brazen hussy's clothes."</p>

  <p>"Borrow them?" mocked Baggage. "I've been changing dresses every two hours
  since I jumped off that rock." She pointed with distaste to the plinth that
  stood in the center of the pool, lonely and deserted without the adornment of
  her classical beauty. "When I get through with a dress, I just touch a match
  to it. I've always wanted clothes to burn."</p>

  <p>"How do you get them?" inquired Sue. "Do you know where the clothes closet
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Do I?" asked Baggage. "That's where I parked that red-hot fire-eater I
  was out with when I first met you in the hall. He's lying under a blanket and
  two or three old suitcases and some shoes. I thought I'd cover him up so
  nobody'd take him away till I saw whether I could use him again."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the poor fellow? Is he ill? Was he overcome?"</p>

  <p>"He's just tired," returned Baggage. I thought he needed a good nap, so I
  just handed him a little poke in the nose."</p>

  <p>"I see that I can learn things from you," remarked Sue Pebble, walking
  around the edge of the pool toward Baggage, who stood nearest the house.
  "Just now I can't think of anything that would give me greater satisfaction
  than a small theft from Miss Spray Summers' wardrobe. I hate that woman
  cordially."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," answered the girl. "And I do too. She's so damned confident.
  No woman ought to be as confident of a damned man as she is of your husband.
  And she has been for years."</p>

  <p>"You're telling me," said Sue. "Personally, I don't give a hang much one
  way or another, but I hate to see the bi&mdash; wench have such smooth
  sailing."</p>

  <p>"The nights I've stood out there and watched them," Baggage's words seemed
  torn out of a searing memory. "At least you would have thought they'd have
  the decency to keep from in front of me. But no, sir, they seemed proud as
  pie about it. They hadn't been out in the garden much of late, though."</p>

  <p>"You liked my husband, didn't you?" asked Sue Pebble, drawing close to
  Baggage.</p>

  <p>"You mean, I <i>like</i> your husband, responded the girl with
  determination, "but I don't seem able to get near him with that woman
  around."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Sue, "we're both out after the same scalp. You've helped me a
  lot, and now I'm going to do something for you. Just come this way and show
  me that clothes closet."</p>

  <p>"We want to be careful not to wake up Bill," Baggage observed, "because if
  we did he'd probably raise a heck of a squawk and the whole house would come
  running."</p>

  <p>At the precise moment that these two eye-filling figures were moving
  across the Summers' lawn toward the house, Rex Pebble, inside, reached a
  decision. He was in no cheerful mood. To have a mistress restored to her
  pristine beauty and an elderly wife dropped on your hands in a rage of
  jealousy, perhaps quite justified, is something to add iron-gray hairs to the
  head. This was one situation in which Rex, an inventor of sorts, could think
  of nothing to relieve the tension of the situation. And on top of this here
  was young Kippie telling him the most monstrous kind of ill luck at the
  office. It appeared that the Rex Pebble fortune was on the eve of being
  rubbed out. It was horrible to think what both Sue and Spray would have to
  say, after all these years, in a jam like that. Rex's new-young brows were
  furrowed with care.</p>

  <p>The group on the whole was a congenial one. There was Major Jaffey, who
  since the dramatic departure of Joe, his banking prospect, with Elmer, had no
  one but Rex to whom he could confide his world-shaking ideas. There was Hal,
  the faithful fireman, who had stayed on after his fellows had gone.
  Nokashima, feeling the call for food, was busily preparing a steak on the
  capable-looking electric stove, at the same time feeding Mr. Henry from a
  baby's bottle. Mr. Henry had doffed his ferocious king of the jungle
  headdress and was now nothing more or less than a playful bloodhound puppy,
  who frisked about the kitchen, exhilarated by his brand-new sense of smell.
  There was plenty to smell in that room. Steak, highballs, toasting bread, and
  the various alluring scents of Spray, Sue, and Fifi, not to mention Baggage,
  who had passed to and fro through the place.</p>

  <p>"I could make a suggestion or two," Kippie was saying, "only I'm afraid of
  getting my head snapped off."</p>

  <p>His uncle turned on the youth, though actually to an outsider it would
  have looked as though one youth were turning viciously on another.</p>

  <p>"None of your funny ideas," said Rex Pebble, shaking a vigorous forefinger
  in an elderly way that was quite incongruous with his dapper appearance. "I
  suppose you don't think it's enough to have imported your dear aunt into this
  madhouse? That idea ought to last you for about a month."</p>

  <p>"But this is a dandy thought, Uncle Rex," explained Kippie. "I wish you'd
  give me a chance to tell you about it. It's about an invention."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeah?" Rex's tone was bitter. I suppose you want me to start a nudist
  colony or a health-giving springs resort founded on that blasted pool."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," returned Kippie. "All I'd like to see you do is get back the
  blueprint of the mouse trap that fellow got away from you."</p>

  <p>"Rats!" said Rex appropriately. "I hoped I'd forgotten that. There may
  have been money in it, but I was gypped, and the fellow got away with the
  plans, and that's that." He dismissed the subject.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you get it back if you could sell it and save us on margin?"
  Young Kippie's tone was sly.</p>

  <p>"Nocka, when you're through torturing that piece of meat," Mr. Pebble
  addressed his small servant, "I think it would be a good idea to open up a
  bottle of brandy for Mr. Kippie. I can't think of anything but brandy and
  women that will keep him quiet, and of these two, drink is the lesser
  evil."</p>

  <p>"O.K., O.K.!" Kippie was quick to jump at whatever came his way, "but if I
  ever get a chance myself, I'm going to get that mouse trap back, and the
  world will beat a path to my door."</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to need mouse traps to get the world to my door." Rex
  glanced around the room, which seemed wilted in its state of disarray. No one
  had bothered to pick up the glasses of the late firemen's ball. In fact, the
  only difference in the room was that other glasses had been added by the more
  recent inhabitants.</p>

  <p>"Down, Mist' Henry, down!" Nokashima pushed the eager bloodhound away from
  the sizzling skillet and hastened to produce the bottle of brandy. It was old
  and mellow, and it had the look of belonging in an inn in Normandy on a cold
  midnight, when the innkeeper, maids, and attendants gathered round the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"What's Spray doing?" inquired Kippie eagerly. "I thought she liked brandy
  too."</p>

  <p>"She does, you young hound," responded his uncle, "which is all the more
  reason for you to confine your thoughts to yourself. I'd hate to think of
  letting you loose with Spray Summers in her present state. As though I hadn't
  enough troubles. Did you ever think, young man, that you ought to get married
  and settle down?"</p>

  <p>"What brings that up?" asked Kippie. "You got married, but I never noticed
  that you settled down. The fact is, I suspect there's been a lot more going
  on around here tonight than anyone knows."</p>

  <p>"We haven't been around here much tonight," Major Jaffey defended his
  host. "We've been out riding and all sorts of things."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Hal, "you'd be surprised if you knew all the places we've
  been and the things we've done."</p>

  <p>Kippie preferred the main line of discourse. He accepted a brandy from
  Nokashima, who passed drinks to the others as well.</p>

  <p>"Suppose, then," the young man countered, "if you want me to settle down,
  that I ask you for Spray Summers' hand?"</p>

  <p>"That would be a hell of a note," rejoined his uncle.</p>

  <p>"Seems perfectly proper to me. She's a lifelong acquaintance of yours,
  sort of a friend of the family, as it were. You could give her away."</p>

  <p>"How could she tell us apart?" parried the older man.</p>

  <p>"There're ways&mdash;we're not twins."</p>

  <p>"You don't know that."</p>

  <p>"I hope we're not. You could just as well be your own nephew. That would
  make you completely backwards."</p>

  <p>"I am now, but what I want to know is, why should you think you'd like to
  marry Spray Summers?"</p>

  <p>"Because she's a nice girl."</p>

  <p>"I can see that everything's different," objected Rex. "That was certainly
  never the reason I was attracted to her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, she's changed."</p>

  <p>"She couldn't change that much. Besides, I have reason to believe
  differently."</p>

  <p>"Supposing I were to get older, could I marry her then?"</p>

  <p>"Not without my consent."</p>

  <p>"But if you're where you were twenty years ago, you don't know whether I
  have your consent or not. You aren't yourself. You're what you used to
  be."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble saw that it was time to put a stop to this harangue. "I can see
  that you're where you be, and apparently always will be&mdash;standing beside
  a bottle. Don't try confuse me any more than I am. That is, unless you can
  relieve my mind of that overdraft account."</p>

  <p>"That's the great disadvantage, remarked Kippie sagely, "that you grow
  backwards in everything but difficulties. Maybe you can find a pool that
  turns bonds into gold."</p>

  <p>"Give Mr. Kippie some hot food, Nokashima," instructed the young man's
  uncle, "and let's see if we can't stop the flow of his thoughts. I'm going
  out for some air."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble strode out onto the veranda. It was queer, he thought, that
  one's necessities should be so insatiable. Here, by a gentle miracle of a
  prankish and beneficent stone figure, the one person dearest to him in the
  world was restored to her youth and the ripe physical beauty that had caught
  him up in passion in his younger years, and yet he wasn't satisfied. First
  there was in his mind the vision of Sue Pebble, his wife, as she looked at
  the lovely Spray with jealous envy in her eyes. Sue had not been a bad wife
  to him, in spite of her frequent flirtations and her stormy temperament.
  Certainly Rex had lived for more than twenty years in the same house with
  Sue, and that was something he had not done with Spray, for all her charm. It
  worked both ways. Seeing Spray in the evenings, when women are able by
  artificial charms and the conspiracy of nature to appear most glamorous, had
  added to her attractions, kept them perennially stirring to the man. Seeing
  Sue in the daylight, with the white glaring atmosphere of practicality about
  her, had taken away from her feminine appeal and had added to her reassuring
  stability. He felt sorry for Sue that she should be so unfortunately placed
  in the all too penetrating spotlight of everyday life. She had been robbed of
  a part of her woman's heritage. Rex Pebble felt on the point of tears. He
  felt sorry for himself too. For here, with Spray restored to him, and
  himself, too, young again, and with a new feeling toward Sue, the unhappy
  business of money had shown its ugly head.</p>

  <p>It was at moments like this, when the world seemed pitch black and without
  point, that Nokashima seldom failed to appear to comfort his boss. The
  Japanese appeared now.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Kippie and Mist' Henry fed and bottled," he announced. "Good idea
  catch breath of air on lawn. Just hear noise in upper story also&mdash;feel
  safer outdoors."</p>

  <p>"You're right," agreed Rex Pebble, "I was afraid of that. It's much safer
  outdoors. What are they doing?" Rex glanced toward the upper floors of his
  mistress's home. Something very queer was going on. Lights were flashing here
  and there, as though someone were running from room to room, switching them
  on and off. "Is somebody playing tag?" asked Rex.</p>

  <p>"Sounds as of great whoopee. Loud manly answered screams. Have idea Miss
  Baggage on loose," answered the wise little man. "Also Miss Spray and
  honorable wife up to old tricks."</p>

  <p>"You mean they're having an argument over, me?"</p>

  <p>"Cannot tell subject, but quite plenty redhot, boss. It appear much hair-
  pulling."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I'll just take a little pull at that bottle you so
  thoughtfully brought along, my good fellow," said Rex, relieving Nokashima of
  his pet. "This is good stuff, indoors or out, with wife or mistress, at home
  or abroad." Rex, who had not indulged deeply during the entire adventurous
  evening, took a long drag and smacked his lips. "We ought to think of a nice
  game ourselves," he suggested. "You and I ought to get together and play
  something. We never have."</p>

  <p>"What shall it be, boss?" asked Nokashima, whose chief charm, perhaps, was
  the complete readiness with which he embraced any new suggestion of adventure
  or diversion. "Leapfrog?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I might hurt you," said Rex, "and then again you might hurt
  me. I don't trust that jujitsu."</p>

  <p>"Me no jujitsu artist," Nokashima declared, "just humble Japanese fellow
  anxious to play. Suppose call Mist' Henry. He always ready to play, too."</p>

  <p>"O.K.!" said Rex Pebble, "get the hound. One bloodhound more or less can't
  hurt." Rex chased his first brandy with another quick one. The tempo and
  warmth of his s blood was pleasantly speedy. "Here, Nocka, let's see you toss
  one off. That's the first requirement for a really good game of any
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Here goes!" Nocka held up the brandy bottle. A shiver raced over his
  small, sturdy frame. "Hot stuff that. Make plenty warm belly. Very
  comforting. Hi, Mist' Henry," the man called in his peculiar way, ending in a
  low, tempting whistle that could not have been duplicated by another human
  being. His mouth was large and usually fixed in an irrepressible grin that
  produced in the whistle a quality of escaping steam, which wound up in a
  surprisingly sharp note of command. A racing figure hesitated uncertainly
  just outside the door to the veranda, while a screen door slammed shut.</p>

  <p>"Mist' Henry very smart dog, even when honorable battery recharged. Not
  silly. Very sensible bloodhound with new acquired smell."</p>

  <p>"Let's hide from him," proposed Rex boyishly. "I think I can get behind
  that tree."</p>

  <p>Let it be said for Rex that he tried to get behind the tree. The trouble
  was' that the tree would not get in front of Rex. It wobbled and wavered and
  behaved in a fashion totally unprecedented in Rex's memory. Mr. Henry,
  entering gayly into the spirit of the chase, was dangerously near, seeming to
  prefer the scent of Rex to Nokashima's more obvious smell, lurking beside the
  stone veranda steps. Rex Pebble helped himself to a short choke of brandy
  before attempting again to cope with the tree. Hoping to appease the thing
  and make an ally of it, he offered the tree a swallow of brandy in a low
  tone. The tree continued to dance but refused to accept the man's
  hospitality. Wherewith Rex dashed a small slosh of brandy against its trunk
  and silently christened it the Sally Rand. "Stop it, Sally," whispered the
  husky male voice, "you make me dizzy, and how can you expect me to find
  coverage in a game of hide-and-seek behind such a whirling dervish?"</p>

  <p>The tree was utterly obstinate. It would not hold still. Rex grew quickly
  disgusted, as Mr. Henry appeared to get hotter and hotter on the scent. The
  man lunged from behind the tree and sought the protection of some near-by
  bushes. These two were addicted to the dance, but in a much smoother, more
  classic sort of way. They held hands gracefully and loped about like the
  figures of a Greek frieze. It was not so hard to conceal oneself behind them
  or in them. The bushes, however, did have very sticky fingers, and they kept
  pricking Rex here and there most irritatingly. "Behave," growled the man
  fiercely, "or I'll not give you a drop of brandy, not a single little drop. I
  won't even baptize you, and how you'd like to go all your life unbaptized?
  Just imagine, no name, no nothing. By the way, are you all sisters, or am I
  seeing more of one family than there really is? To think that I've been in
  and out of here all these years and never knew what charming neighbors we
  had."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry, dashing up and enthusiastically licking Mr. Pebble's hands and
  face, cut short this monologue, while Nokashima stepped forth rather
  unsteadily from hiding and suggested that another game would not be
  amiss.</p>

  <p>"You it," he told Rex.</p>

  <p>"Don't be cryptic," replied his playmate. "I it&mdash;what do you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just that&mdash;you it."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any verbs?" Rex interrogated sharply. "Can't explain," said
  Nokashima thickly. "You tell him, Mist' Henry. Tell him he it."</p>

  <p>"Stop it!" commanded Mr. Pebble. "This is the worst language I have ever
  heard. I'm surprised at you. You could curse me out with words like that, and
  I wouldn't know the difference. What are your antecedents?"</p>

  <p>"Got no ant'cedents, however, nevertheless," said Nocka. "Very simple. We
  play game now."</p>

  <p>"Not till I get it straight. Explain it this way: Suppose there were four
  of us playing?"</p>

  <p>"Me tell him tell them tell you you it."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" exploded Rex. "You're either a genius or rapidly descending
  into the moronic stage. Do you always go after the pronouns when you have
  drinks, Nocka?"</p>

  <p>"If good-looking," admitted Nokashima, "especially fond just plain she. No
  it. Lady them best of all."</p>

  <p>Rex sighed heavily. More and more it seemed useless to try to understand;
  yet the man evidently had something in his mind. "Well, supposing I consent,
  what do we do next?"</p>

  <p>"Absorb small drink," said Nokashima quickly, his eyes gleaming. "Very
  intoxicating evening. Stimulating to all concerned. Most enjoyable part of
  evening now in progress for unspeakable Japanese man. Great fun at games."
  Nokashima interrupted his flow of bouquets long enough to take a good firm
  hold on the brandy and pour a fiery trickle down his throat. "Hot dog, let's
  go!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"What shall we play now, you insatiable Oriental athlete?" asked Rex
  Pebble of the diminutive man, who danced round him in glee, rubbing his
  stomach happily with both hands.</p>

  <p>"Now we skip steps," said Nocka.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Nocka, I know," answered Rex sympathetically, "I've skipped steps
  too, but I never tried it as a pastime. However, nothing ventured, nothing
  learned." He followed Nokashima to the steps.</p>

  <p>"Oh, infinite more humor, boss, to skip steps. I begin," and with a
  pleased expression in his tiny eyes Nokashima flew up and down the steps on
  nimble feet, skipping to the tune of a very weird chant that only Nocka, and
  maybe God, knew.</p>

  <p>To Rex Pebble this demonstration of the crazy little fellow was the last
  straw. He felt himself slipping, his poise seemed to have vanished, and with
  a last effort he pulled himself together to call for a drink. As always, the
  magic word brought Nokashima to his senses and his shaker, in this case a
  brandy bottle.</p>

  <p>"Watch me," said Rex, standing on the top step of four, "with a running
  start I bet I can stop before I get to the water. Wait, though," the man
  added, "suppose you go get a watch and we'll time each other. We'll have
  races. Mr. Henry can hold the watch."</p>

  <p>"O.K.," said Nocka agreeably. I go get timepiece." Nokashima hurried on
  unsteady legs into the house. Left alone, Rex Pebble felt the gayety of the
  games slipping away from him. His forehead was warm and moist. Instead of
  four steps there seemed to be eight, instead of one tree there seemed to be
  two. It was nice, anyway, he calculated, that things worked out so evenly.
  Just double of everything. That was fine. He wondered if there were two
  bottles of brandy instead of one, and indeed there were. Not only two
  bottles, but just twice the amount of brandy as in the one bottle. Rex began
  to speculate as to how this other bottle of brandy might taste. Would it be
  different, or would it taste the same, and if he drank out of the one, would
  it reduce the amount in the other? It waa a charming speculation that left
  room for a great many discoveries. If there were one Spray Summers now, that
  would mean two&mdash;only the disadvantage would be that his wife, Sue
  Pebble, also would be multiplied by two. Which would mean that the fight
  between the two women would be twice as fierce and, also, alas, if Rex's
  overdraft were now $25,000, under the present system of computation, that
  would mean a deficit of $50,000.</p>

  <p>It was all very distressing. Rex began to feel that he couldn't stand it.
  If under normal conditions it would take Nokashima two minutes to find a
  watch, this would mean four minutes before he could return and the happy
  games be resumed. Rex began greatly to feel the need of water on his
  forehead. He decided to take a chance on reducing the amount of brandy, which
  was now double, and lifting the two bottles with both hands, drank with both
  mouths.</p>

  <p>Well, at least it was consoling to think that he had four legs to walk on.
  This happy thought produced a decision. Rex looked toward the inviting waters
  of the pool. A little dip would do him good, he thought. On all four legs he
  began to gallop to the edge. His forefeet were over the side and touching the
  water before he remembered that there was something strange and magic about
  this small body of water, something that had brought him new youth and vigor
  and that might very likely handle him roughly if indulged in too liberally.
  It was too late, however, to stop. He plunged into the gratefully cooling
  waters and waited curiously to see what might happen.</p>

  <p>What did happen was most shocking. A contracting sensation overtook the
  man, shook his frame with short spasms as though he were being pushed bodily
  into a hot-water bottle that was too tight for him. He underwent a brief
  siege of choking, his eyes blurred as though with fever.</p>

  <p>With rapidly diminishing strength Rex beat back the water. He tried breast
  and crawl strokes and then a general sort of floundering, but it was easy to
  perceive that something very unusual was taking place within him. Either he
  was losing his strength altogether to some unknown inner tax of power, or
  else, perhaps, the magic pool was busy doing its stuff again. Rex Pebble
  began to grow alarmed. With the greatest difficulty he managed to keep his
  head above the surface of the water. He raised his voice to call Nokashima,
  but nothing happened. Rex had yelled, and he had heard nothing. He cleared
  his throat and took a fresh start.</p>

  <p>"Nokashima," he screamed, and as though from afar, strange and unfamiliar
  as the voice of a babe, he caught a minute sound: <i>Nokashima!</i> Rex was
  very quiet. This was terrible. He couldn't make a sound. Suppose he should
  drown? But the water couldn't be that deep; no one could possibly drown in
  Spray Summers' handsomely landscaped garden pool. A man would have to be an
  utter fool, holding his head under, to do that. Rex looked down at the
  glistening surface.</p>

  <p>What he observed, floating like jelly beneath the silver surface, was
  something to startle a city editor. This time Rex could not believe his eyes.
  The brandy was no good. Too bad to spoil a nice evening this way; it had
  started out so glamorously, so memorably, and now here he was, whisky and
  highballs and gin and brandy, imagining the oddest things about his own silly
  body reflected in a garden pool. Rex summoned his courage and endeavored to
  take a realistic view of the whole matter. He glanced down into the water,
  and what he saw this time made him start in amazement and chagrin. Eyes may
  be bad reporters the first time you send them out, but the second, they have
  to tell the truth; and the truth was cruel. Rex Pebble put all the lung
  command into one mighty screech for Nokashima. Across the lawn came the
  piercing cry of an infant. There was no doubt of the horrifying truth; Rex
  Pebble ducked his head under water. It popped up again in shame and
  mortification. Where only a few moments before had been the whipcord,
  vigorous, handsome form of a young man was now the sprawling body of a baby.
  "Oh, my God!" murmured the strange infant, then howled aloud again for its
  faithful Japanese follower.</p>

  <p>Nokashima, hastening on nimble but uncertain feet into the garden with a
  watch for the impending races, was bewildered at the disappearance of his
  employer. There was not a sign of the man in sight. No bottle, no coat, no
  trace of him anywhere. Even Mr. Henry had vanished. Nocka unsteadily beat
  around the bushes, and then, remembering Rex's penchant for hiding behind
  trees, began to startle imaginary playmates by dodging around and crying
  <i>hi!</i> wherever he went. Anyone watching the fellow would have thought
  him utterly stark, raving mad. Liquor has its novel effects, but the game
  which Nokashima seemed to be playing with himself was gone about in a spirit
  of absolutely logical insanity.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, no tree yielded Rex Pebble. Nocka grew uneasy. What could
  boss have done with self? He cogitated. Nocka felt sure the master had been
  having a very fine time when he had left only a few minutes before, and it
  was totally out of keeping with his character for him entirely to abandon an
  object while in his cups. Nocka counted off on his fingers various
  improbabilities: Rex had not run away; he had not hidden playfully anywhere
  on the lawn; he certainly had not gone indoors, for Nocka had just come from
  the house through the only door that opened onto the veranda. The Japanese
  was genuinely disturbed and puzzled.</p>

  <p>Then he heard the cry. It was a baby's importunate yell to be tended to,
  and at first Nocka imagined that the long-awaited heir had at last arrived
  next door. The little fellow was feeling rather fine, and he felt glad that
  the anxious parents had finally been blessed. Complacently he went on to
  enumerate the possibilities of the whereabouts of his boss.</p>

  <p>The baby cried again. There's really very little to consider deeply about
  a baby's cry unless it comes late at night and keeps one awake, or unless one
  is the father of the infant and has to walk the floor with it. Nokashima,
  however, pricked up his ears sharply the second time he heard this particular
  baby cry. It was not the tone exactly that electrified his small Oriental
  being: it was what the baby said. Nocka was standing fairly near the water
  from which the cry seemed to emanate; he could not have been mistaken.</p>

  <p>"Goddamn it, you dopey Jap," said the high falsetto, speaking, however, in
  crisp, careful enunciation, "come here this minute and drag me out of this
  pool before I shrivel up to nothing. Quick, I tell you&mdash;I'm on my
  way!"</p>

  <p>Nokashima had seen a lot of queer things in his life, but now he was
  dumbfounded. Horror rendered him speechless. He dreaded to turn his eyes to
  the pool because of the sight which he was sure would greet him. And it
  did.</p>

  <p>For there, struggling and breasting the surface as best it could, was a
  babe of perhaps one year old, greatly impeded by long trousers, a dress
  shirt, and a tuxedo coat.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the mind of Rex Pebble through the voice of the babe-in-
  arms, "don't stand there all night. That is, unless you want to lose the best
  boss you ever had. I'll be subtracted to zero if you don't hurry. I think I
  must be down to about one year now. Only a year left to go, and I'm going
  backward fast."</p>

  <p>The startled house man recovered sufficiently to rush to his employer's
  rescue. With tender care he reached down and lifted the squirming form from
  the water. Nokashima felt an almost fatherly pride as he cupped the infant in
  his arms. Life had its compensations. He had never dreamed that he would hold
  Rex Pebble in this fashion. The quaint fellow began to croon what he imagined
  was a lullaby as he started toward the house, rocking his impromptu cradle
  back and forth to the melody. It wasn't hard for Nokashima to rock, not in
  his condition.</p>

  <p>"Stop that!" remarked the baby harshly. "Don't you think it's bad enough
  to have to endure this final mortification, without being sung to? Get me a
  brandy-and-soda, and make it snappy!"</p>

  <p>Seldom had Nokashima heard such commands from the sweet mouth of a new-
  born. Seldom, either, had he observed so ludicrous a costume as Rex Pebble
  wore, the long trousers drooping and dripping far beyond the tender pink toes
  they concealed.</p>

  <p>With a curious mixture of feelings and a very unsteady walk, the little
  yellow man crossed the lawn with his new charge to the home of Rex Pebble's
  mistress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">14. OF HUMAN BADINAGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Sue Pebble, accompanied by that lush garden piece,
  Baggage, emerged freshly trim and twenty from the wonder-working waters, she
  made straight for Spray Summers' home with the evil intent of lifting a new
  gown to take the place of the one which she carried, dripping, on her arm.
  Sue was attired solely in step-ins, and a sweet sight she was, too. The
  garment fitted her appealing form like a pair of mittens, showing off its
  lovely contours to the best and most dangerous advantage, depending upon the
  point of view.</p>

  <p>"Here," directed Baggage, "we'll just slip in the bar and have a little
  snifter to celebrate before we go on upstairs."</p>

  <p>At first Sue was reluctant to enter the kitchen-bar, not because the men
  of the house were collected there, but because, before she took another step,
  she had a vain desire to observe her new build in a full-length mirror. The
  idea of a highball, none the less, overcame her pulsing vanity, and Sue went
  into the room with Baggage.</p>

  <p>Kippie, Major Jaffey, and Hal sat in the kitchen, steeping themselves in
  the beneficent fumes of alcohol. Kippie had had quite a few. Robbed of the
  brandy bottle which Nokashima had carried out into the garden, he had laid
  siege to the cellar and from it taken a choice array of old Irish whiskies.
  Kippie knew the secret of Spray Summers' cellar, which was that, because of
  Sue Pebble's scruples, Rex did most of his really professional drinking away
  from home. Kippie was so-high with his Irish whiskies-and-waters, and was
  holding forth with great gusto on the vices and virtues of blondes versus
  brunettes when Sue and Baggage entered.</p>

  <p>The three men, lifting their eyes through a haze, stared at the newcomers.
  Sue Pebble, clad in step-ins, showed not the slightest embarrassment.
  Temporarily Sue had lost sight of the magic of her transformation.</p>

  <p>"Which one of you men would like to lend a girl a drink?" demanded
  Baggage. "You seem to be pretty well stocked."</p>

  <p>"Both inside and outside," admitted the handsome young Kippie, "but not
  too much so to know a pretty girl when we see one, eh, fellows?" The Major
  and Hal murmured hearty approval.</p>

  <p>"Well, I like that," remarked Baggage, since all eyes seemed to center on
  the charming Mrs. Pebble. "No accounting for tastes. However, you may pass
  that bottle around, and we'll toast your good taste." Baggage was a
  generous-hearted girl.</p>

  <p>There was a general clinking of glasses.</p>

  <p>From Sue's arm hung the dripping clothes which she had just taken off.</p>

  <p>"Have you been immersed in a lake or something, madam?" asked the Major,
  by way of opening a conversation.</p>

  <p>"I'll say I have," smiled back Sue, "and what an immersion it was, old
  son."</p>

  <p>"Major Lynnhaven Jaffey, at your service, madam." This with a dignified
  bow.</p>

  <p>"I'll be calling on you, probably," said Sue.</p>

  <p>"I'm usually in bed by eleven," returned the Major, misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>"You're one up on me, Uncle Jaffey," said Mrs. Pebble, "but you do look
  like an exceptionally decent sort."</p>

  <p>At the moment Hal, the fireman, who out of the entire household had
  probably made the steadiest, least spectacular alcoholic progress throughout
  the evening, broke in, gazing at Sue earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Say, lady," inquired Hal, "is this guy really your uncle?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have no uncle," Sue replied. "I did have, but he's dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead?"</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>"Your uncle is quite dead, lady?"</p>

  <p>"He should be. He was a fine fellow."</p>

  <p>"You seem to take his passing rather calmly." Hal shook his head
  sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"He didn't pass. He was murdered." Sue looked intently at Hal.</p>

  <p>"Don't look at me like that, lady. I didn't murder your uncle. Did I?"
  asked the anxious Hal.</p>

  <p>"How could you murder my uncle?" calculated the lovely Mrs. Pebble,
  drinking.</p>

  <p>"Offhand I can think of five different ways to murder people. I've been
  considering them for years," said Hal.</p>

  <p>Kippie, through his bewildered point of view, had been trying to make
  something of this hit-and-run conversation. Apparently there was nothing to
  be made, only a vague doubt assailed him. He glanced sharply at the wet
  garments hanging on Sue's arm. Surely somewhere he had seen those clothes
  before. There was something very familiar about them which he couldn't quite
  place.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of murder," Kippie tried a shot in the dark, "where did you get
  those clothes?"</p>

  <p>"They're my clothes," returned Sue defensively. "I bought them&mdash; that
  is, my husband bought them for me."</p>

  <p>"Who are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know who I am."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I ought to, but I don't, and that's what's worrying me. You're
  pretty, I like you, I could be very fond of you, but I don't know you."
  Kippie shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I know somebody you know," said Sue Pebble teasingly. "Maybe I know
  an aunt of yours or something."</p>

  <p>So that was it! A small charge of recognition went off in young Kippie's
  head. The woman had his aunt Sue's clothes. A murderess! She had done away
  with his aunt and taken her clothes.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Kippie agreed cautiously, "maybe I might have an aunt or
  something. By the way, when did you see my aunt last?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," responded Mrs. Pebble coyly, "I haven't really seen her since I put
  on these step-ins."</p>

  <p><i>Aha&mdash;check!</i> flashed through Kippie's mind.</p>

  <p>"How was she?" asked the woman's nephew shrewdly. "I had a hard time with
  her, but I finally got her to agree to do as I said."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I told her it was time she passed on."</p>

  <p>The foul, heartless cruelty of it! Kippie thrilled to the scent of violent
  death. He almost whistled for Mr. Henry, the bloodhound, then considered how
  much more a hero he would be if the whole discovery of the deed devolved upon
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you care for my aunt?" asked Kippie craftily. "Why did you tell
  her it was time she passed on?"</p>

  <p>"For one thing," answered Sue Pebble enigmatically, "her batteries needed
  recharging. Then there were other things wrong with her&mdash;her husband,
  for instance."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that that's off the point," cut in Sue Pebble's self-
  appointed cross-examiner, helping himself to another whisky-and-soda and
  blinking at his aunt through heavy-lidded eyes. "I asked if you had no
  emotional feeling toward my aunt, no affection for her."</p>

  <p>"But I am on the point," protested Sue. "I say that the worst thing wrong
  with her was her husband. He was an old fossil."</p>

  <p><i>"Was</i> an old fossil?" inquired the young man sharply, wondering
  dimly when it was he had last seen his uncle. He looked around the room. No
  Rex Pebble in sight. He tried to find his way back in memory through a tangle
  of uplifted glasses to the last time he had seen the man. Very darkly, as
  though from a great distance, he seemed to catch a glimpse of Rex Pebble
  leaving this room with a bottle of brandy under his arm and some most
  disturbing ideas in his head&mdash;something about an overdraft. That was it!
  Kippie had brought the news from the office himself. And Rex had gone off
  into the garden in a distressed state of mind. It was very evident that this
  beautiful creature in step-ins, who sat beside him gracefully tossing off
  liquors and enjoying herself, was a first-class criminal character, fit for
  the line-up.</p>

  <p>"If you ask me," confided Sue Pebble, "I think your uncle was an awful
  fool to marry that woman in the first place. Imagine being cooped up in a
  house for twenty years with a person like that."</p>

  <p>The crassness of the woman, talking about the person, or perhaps the two
  people, with whom she had done away, shocked Kippie to the core of his
  soul.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think my uncle and my aunt got along well?" asked the young
  man.</p>

  <p>Sue Pebble was enjoying herself to the fullest. To be young again and
  unrecognized and on her own. Besides, this handsome Kippie was a
  distressingly accurate replica of her own Rex when she had first married him.
  Sue smoothed her golden curls with a graceful hand.</p>

  <p>"They got on well enough for a couple of old dodos," she returned, "but I
  can't see why you're so interested in old people and the past."</p>

  <p>"I'm interested in justice," flashed the young man. "I won't see innocent
  people foully murdered and not lift a voice in protest."</p>

  <p>"So you think I'm the murderess, do you? Well, I want you to know that
  your uncle had just as much to do with killing his wife as I did. Besides, if
  the truth were known, there's a brazen challenge who lives around here named
  Spray Summers, that had as much to do with it as anyone."</p>

  <p>Things were moving entirely too fast for Kippie. He was delighted to
  uncover one murder, but a widespread net of crime was more than he could
  comprehend. It smacked too much of mass production.</p>

  <p>Kippie's one-man investigation of the foul deeds which he suspected had
  been going on outside, on Spray Summers' lawn, was destined to get away from
  him. At this moment Spray Summers herself came into the bar. Her dark beauty
  was contrasted sharply with the blond loveliness of Sue Pebble. The women
  stared at one another, held rigid by a long bond of fascination. Spray
  Summers had seen Mrs. Pebble years before, when the woman was Rex Pebble's
  lovely young wife, and she could not forget that memory. With a jealous pang
  she realized that Sue, too, had discovered the secret of the pool. She coolly
  sized up the appealing girlish figure in the cream-colored pants. What would
  Rex think? Spray wondered. But Rex Pebble's nephew was not to be detoured
  from his criminal exposures. In Spray he sensed an ally.</p>

  <p>"This is the murderess of your husband," he calmly introduced Mrs. Pebble.
  "I suspect that she may have got rid of the old lady too."</p>

  <p>"I think she did," commented Spray thoughtfully. "She got rid of the old
  lady all right, and I distinctly remember hearing her say that she would also
  tear Rex Pebble limb from limb if he didn't give her the secret of youth that
  he had. Why, the poor man's probably lying all over the garden this very
  minute in small bits. Let's go and see."</p>

  <p>"No, wait," Kippie directed. "We want to hear her whole confession."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you must know, I fell in love with a younger man."</p>

  <p>"What," said Kippie, greatly surprised, "I don't see how you could have
  fallen in love with a younger man. That is, without falling in love with a
  man who was too young."</p>

  <p>Baggage, who had been preoccupied with Hal, having a penchant for firemen,
  interrupted. "Well, say a man about your age," she hazarded to Kippie. "I
  understand what she means. I think you're just about right. I could use you."
  Baggage advanced upon the young man; there was meaning in her eyes. But Major
  Jaffey, interested in the outcome of the inquest, detained her with a hand on
  her arm. "Won't you sit here, my dear?" he suggested,offering a knee. Such
  offers come with disconcerting infrequency in the life of a girl like
  Baggage. Like a drowning man, in a flash she recalled her years in stone. No
  one had ever offered her a knee. She sat down abruptly, but her mind was
  still on young Kippie, so tantalizingly like the Rex Pebble she had watched
  grow out of magnetic young manhood into distinguished though dapper age.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," continued Sue Pebble, "and I shan't burden you with
  it here, but, in short, this young chap was my husband's nephew."</p>

  <p>Kippie whistled between his teeth. Things were moving around in a whirling
  circle. Kippie took a drink.</p>

  <p>"Come clean, my dear," said Spray Summers icily to her rival as Kippie's
  expression grew darker and more bewildered.</p>

  <p>"This, Kippie dear, is your charming Aunt Sue. But I still believe she may
  have murdered her husband for the secret of youth she was raving about."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Sue sweetly, ignoring Kippie's chagrined amazement,
  "where is that dirty, low-down husband of mine? He's not in the garden, I
  assure you. I generally imagine that you have him in tow when he's missing,
  my love, but I see that something or somebody else must have got the lock and
  key tonight. If you'll pardon me, I think I'll just go in search of some dry
  clothes." Sue Pebble swept from the room, a fuming Spray after her.</p>

  <p>"God, this is too much for one fireman to bear! It would take more than a
  seven-alarm fire to make me feel this bad," said Hal, dropping his head on
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"Quite more thrilling than any of my adventures have ever been," murmured
  Major Jaffey from beneath the lissom weight of Baggage. "One does not know
  what to expect next."</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing I'm not a mind-reader, Grandpop," said Baggage
  impudently. "I've always had the idea that this was the way to start things."
  Baggage bounced up and down on the old gentleman's knee.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you mean by things," remarked the Major, "but the
  drift of your inference is very bad indeed. You should keep such ideas to
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Not after fifteen years on a marble column, I shouldn't. I have every
  intention of telling the world exactly what I expect to do. Even if I get
  disappointed," added the girl bravely.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's always the danger of trial and error," the Major told her
  sagely, "but I should imagine you would bat a fairly high percentage."</p>

  <p>"Take that one," said Baggage pointing at Kippie. "I think I'll drag him
  out into the garden with me. For years I watched his uncle and this Summers
  woman behave in the most scandalous way in the night on the lawn. This one's
  a pretty good imitation of the original. I believe we should get along
  swell." The girl slid off Major Jaffey's lap and approached Kippie with
  determination.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," she commanded.</p>

  <p>"What for?" inquired the befuddled youth.</p>

  <p>"That you should ask!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

  <p>"It's better to ask first and get things clearly understood. I may be
  risking a lot."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so old-fashioned. Come right out with it. I can't imagine what
  your generation is coming to if it gets so inoculated with decency that it
  has to hedge like that."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go," said Kippie stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Something's wrong with you, then, or else you're not Rex Pebble's nephew.
  He never said that to anyone."</p>

  <p>"It's certainly time someone in this family called a halt."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to lower my womanhood," stated Baggage, "to stand here all
  night arguing about a little detail. You come with me or I'll scream. I'll
  scream so bloody loud they'll hear me at the police station, and then
  wouldn't you be ashamed? Imagine what you'd have to tell the officers when
  they came. Denied a little girl, just feature that&mdash;what the coppers
  would say!"</p>

  <p>"I think you're disgusting&mdash;you're too plain spoken. Can't you veil a
  few things?"</p>

  <p>"Veil them?" Baggage glanced down at herself with evident astonishment. "I
  believe in solid cloth and no veils. I'm darned sick and tired of veils. You
  would be too if you'd caught cold as many nights from draughty wrappings as I
  have. Yes, sir, I believe in good honest whole cloth, or the human hide.
  There's only two ways to tempt, by sleight of hand or by slight of eye."</p>

  <p>Here the girl gave way to her emotions. "Come on, now, and listen to my
  story. I was the one that put your uncle and the Summers creature and Sue
  Pebble up to their tricks. I'm the cause of this whole evening. If I hadn't
  slipped off the pedestal, Rex Pebble would never have regained his youth, but
  I admit that if I'd thought I could have found you here, I'd have stayed down
  there in the garden and waited."</p>

  <p>There was a loud infantile wail from the direction of the upper floor.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up," said Baggage, "they're in the second generation upstairs."
  Kippie let his dark, fiery young eyes wander over the appealing girl. He
  debated. There was too much going on to go out, and yet...</p>

  <p>"Hurry," urged Baggage, "I think we're on the point of something."</p>

  <p>"I think we are," answered Kippie, taking her arm and moving toward the
  door. "I think they're bringing a baby downstairs."</p>

  <p>They were bringing a baby downstairs. The child was Rex Pebble, who
  screamed and protested above the din made by the two women and by Nokashima.
  The devoted little man still clung to his charge, in spite of frantic
  snatches at the poor manhandled body of Mr. Pebble. Across the man's loins,
  in lieu of diapers, Nokashima had rigged up a heavy towel and a large safety
  pin of such a size as to make it look more like an instrument of combat than
  a method of holding on one's clothing. Both Rex's hands and feet were in a
  perpetual wriggle, while he screwed fists into his eyes, bawling at the top
  of his high falsetto voice. On either side Sue Pebble and Spray Summers
  besieged the harassed Nokashima.</p>

  <p>"You let me have that thing this minute," shouted Sue. "He would play a
  trick like this on me just when I get in form. Give the brat to me, you
  slant-eyed Fu Manchu, and I'll do something about it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," said Spray harshly. "Give it to me. It's in pain. It needs
  bicarbonate of soda."</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous," cried Mrs. Pebble. "Give a baby bicarbonate of soda!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a baby," Spray retorted. "It's a full-grown man."</p>

  <p>"I don't dispute you there," said the wife. "You have plenty of basis for
  your statement, I daresay. But it's not a full-grown man at this moment. Not
  unless this deceptive Oriental is a magician with bath towels."</p>

  <p>"It's ill, just the same," Spray Summers contended loudly, above Rex
  Pebble's long-continuous wailing. "It does need soda or ginger or catnip or
  something."</p>

  <p>"Catnip, indeed!" screamed the baby. "You get me a whisky-and-soda. How
  long do I have to yell for one simple little thing? Isn't it bad enough to be
  in this condition without having you two women pulling me about like a
  fishing worm?"</p>

  <p>"Worm, ha, that's good!" cried Sue. "Worm, that you are. Do you realize
  that I'm a young woman, hale and hearty, and that here you maliciously have
  yourself changed by a supersexed wanton into a mere babe-in-arms?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I'm not finding it an experience to treasure in memory," said
  Rex bitterly, "but the least you could do would be to get me that drink."</p>

  <p>To Hal and Major Jaffey, who had silently watched so much go on in this
  particular room that evening, this was the last straw. At first Jaffey was
  inclined to dismiss the whole affair as a practical joke, but by the time Rex
  Pebble had begun to call for drinks in so realistic a fashion, the Major
  began to feel that anything was possible. He took a very cautious look around
  the room just to be sure nobody was about to surprise him with a magic
  baptism. To Hal, whose mouth was fixed in a permanent sort of gape, he
  whispered, "Look here, old man, I don't think we'd better drink any of the
  water around this place. As for bathing, I wouldn't be caught near a
  bath-tub."</p>

  <p>Suddenly twisting himself in Nokashima's cuddling arms, with the Jap tut-
  tutting over him, Rex spied his two male friends. "Major," cried the infant
  in arms, "well, for the love of Pete, am I glad to see you?" The baby's face
  beamed. "And accompanied by bottle and glasses." Rex reached a tiny chubby
  hand of pink crinkled flesh toward the Major. "Gimme one, old scout, will
  you?" pleaded the child.</p>

  <p>Major Jaffey pretended not to notice that he had been addressed. Indeed,
  he wondered whether he had been addressed. It was perfectly possible still
  that these two madwomen and the willing Japanese had conspired to take
  advantage of his and Hal's somewhat credulous condition.</p>

  <p>"All right, all right!" screamed the baby to whom Nokashima clung with
  difficulty. "Just wait till I get out of this diaper. Just wait till I get my
  strength back. I'll beat you two eggs up so you won't know each other. Is
  this gratitude? I take you in and give you a big evening, and then what
  happens? You make out as though you didn't know me, just because I happen to
  have shrunk and have to wear a bath towel around my middle." Res tugged at
  the safety pin with his small pink fists.</p>

  <p>"Boss best to leave honorable towel around loins. Very draughty, also
  likely to shock ladies present."</p>

  <p>"You too, Nocka?" cried Rex Pebble. "Going back on me, making fun of me?
  After all the years I've known these two women," it was a strain to
  distinguish just what the tiny, thin voice was saying, "that I should give
  either of them a shock. You make me laugh!"</p>

  <p>"Great shock possible from disappointment," murmured Nocka, adjusting his
  charge's pseudo-diapers. "Nokashima somewhat surprised himself."</p>

  <p>"Keep your surprises to yourself, you Japanese limb of Satan," remarked
  Sue Pebble, "and let me have my husband. I'll fix him!"</p>

  <p>Spray took up the battle cry. "He wants milk," she said, "hot milk."</p>

  <p>"What gave you the maternity complex?" the baby asked acidly. "I never
  noticed you going round trying to feed babies hot milk or catnip. You were
  much more likely to be feeding hot babies whisky."</p>

  <p>"May I take a close look at the little fellow?" asked Major Jaffey
  unsteadily, hoping to detect a fraud.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," answered Sue Pebble. "It's no treat. We aren't going to
  put him in a side show. That's the trouble. He's a perfectly ordinary
  baby."</p>

  <p>"My old friend Rex, at his age," observed Major Jaffey, "really should
  prove something a little unusual." "If he is, it's escaped us," snapped
  Sue.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Spray sweetly, "that if you just let me have the child for
  a few minutes, I can work wonders with him."</p>

  <p>"I lent him to you for twenty years," said the man's wife, "and I quite
  agree that you've worked wonders with him. Next time I lend anyone a husband,
  I'm going to have him insured."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble was addressing the Major fiercely between beautiful little
  white baby teeth, "You get me a drink, you pop-eyed, evil-minded old wreck,
  or I'll batter your face to a pulp when I get back my years," he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>The Major, however, was literal-minded. "I should think, Rex," he chided,
  "that you would learn to get what you want by being a little gentleman and
  behaving yourself. You can't bully people, remember, because it's going to be
  years and years before you grow up into a big strong man again."</p>

  <p>"Just for old times' sake," begged the baby, "hand me a small finger. It
  won't hurt me. I'm still myself."</p>

  <p>"Beg honorable pardon," interrupted Nokashima in the interests of truth,
  "but that no strictly so. Nokashima already forced change bath towel twice.
  Hard on laundry. Mr. Pebble not man he used to be."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Spray Summers, with compassion in her
  lovely dark eyes. "We'll let the child have some sherry. That will be all
  right for him. It's in the cellar. We'll all have some. I like sherry late at
  night. Remember, Rexie?" the young woman asked, with a curiously knowing
  look.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the baby, gritting its teeth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">15. ALL IN A NIGHT'S WORK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The idea of giving poor little Rex Pebble a drink of sherry
  was a charitable one, to begin with, but in execution the scheme took on a
  slight tinge of manhandling. Spray Summers had suggested the wine with the
  best of intentions, out of genuine sympathy for this man whom she loved, now
  so pathetically reduced to the shape and the figure of a babe-in-arms.</p>

  <p>But it had been a long time since Spray Summers had been to her cellar.
  Rex himself was in the habit of getting up what was required in drink, or
  else Nokashima would go scuttling down the steep, tortuous steps into those
  regions. Spray didn't realize how dark the place was until she led the party
  of wine seekers thither. It smelled musty and sweet, as indeed it might, in
  view of the rows of shelves so amply stocked with choice liquids of all
  kinds, including a fine wine supply.</p>

  <p>"Ooh! how dark!" squealed Spray. "I can't see a thing."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to see that I can make out," responded Sue Pebble
  suspiciously. "You aren't now conspiring to lure me down into this imitation
  afterlife and bump me off, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I clutter up a perfectly good cellar with extra bodies?"
  inquired Spray Summers. "If I were going to dispose of you, I think I'd find
  a pleasanter place to do so. Out of the way, something quiet and retiring, to
  match the corpse."</p>

  <p>"It is dark," admitted Major Jaffey, who was experiencing some difficulty
  in locating each next step. "I just don't think I can find a thing around
  here."</p>

  <p>"Now, Major," warned Spray, "remember, we're all going to behave down here
  in this nice dark place."</p>

  <p>Spray led the parade, followed by Sue, then Hal, who was muttering
  incoherently to himself about the absurdity of going down into cellars in the
  pitch black of night. After that came Major Jaffey and Nokashima bearing Rex
  Pebble.</p>

  <p>"Stop being so silly," screamed the baby, "just take me back upstairs and
  give me a drink of whisky. That's all I want."</p>

  <p>"No, you must have wine," said Sue; "it will be good for you. This is the
  first time I ever had a chance to have a hand in regulating your diet, and I
  think I'll just be pretty firm about it."</p>

  <p>"Look here, after all," remarked Major Jaffey, "I can't see why the whole
  bloody lot of us should be diving down into this hole. We could send one
  person down and get the stuff."</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad idea," agreed Sue. "Let's just sit down here nice and
  cozy in the dark and have a little drink on the steps while we're waiting for
  Nokashima to come back. I'll hold Rex."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I hardly think so," said Spray. "This is my house, and I'll hold
  him." Both women made a snatch for the man-child, one in the dark clutching a
  small leg, while the other grabbed a hand; both tugged.</p>

  <p>"Let go of me," screamed the infant. "What do you think I am&mdash;a mere
  thing, a mama-doll ?"</p>

  <p>"Best leave honorable boss alone," suggested Nokashima timidly as he held
  on to Rex with the idea of protecting him from the overzealous wife and
  mistress. Sue and Spray, however, continued to grab at the man until he piped
  at the top of his tiny voice:</p>

  <p>"Goddamn it, leave me alone!"</p>

  <p>Hal, the fireman, sensed the tensity of the situation. "Hold on," he said,
  "let's think of some way we could all share Mr. Pebble."</p>

  <p>The baby groaned.</p>

  <p>"No, best I hold master," objected Nocka. "Have seen ladies loose with
  babies. Impossible to predict what happen to this one should fall into
  clutches."</p>

  <p>Both women laughed sneeringly, but Hal pursued his idea. "Why not tie a
  string to his safety pin and lower him down to find the bottle himself ?"</p>

  <p>It seemed a little hard on the child, but since it was practically
  impossible for any member of the party to regard Rex in any other than an
  adult light, the thought was considered a good one. Of course, the baby might
  bang his nose, or he might bump into a large healthy rodent, or Nokashima
  might even let go of the string, by mistake. Human bodies seemed so
  comparatively easy to obtain that evening that no one except Rex Pebble took
  these hazards as serious.</p>

  <p>"If I ever get back to where I was," breathed Rex Pebble, "I'll fix you
  two women."</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat or a promise, you shrunken shadow of a husband?"
  inquired the man's wife.</p>

  <p>Nokashima took a firm stance and began to lower the body, hand over fist,
  into the deep well of darkness. Hal held the Japanese around the waist, while
  Major Jaffey clung to Hal. It was a little ridiculous, as Rex Pebble, since
  his magic reducing swim, could have been held by one little finger. However,
  the men above him panted and held to each other in desperation, as though
  they were letting a grand piano over a cliff. The baby screamed. "Ouch!" it
  cried, "you're banging me against the stairway. Keep clear to the right.
  Ouch! Look out for that stone wall. You hit me behind."</p>

  <p>"Watch your grammar!" called Sue Pebble sharply. "You sound like an
  Irishman."</p>

  <p>"You'll find the bottle over by the coke bin," instructed Spray Summers
  sweetly. "You may have to look around a little, but it's there all right.
  Only don't get the wrong one. There's some absinthe around there
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>There was no sound from Rex.</p>

  <p>"When you're ready to come up, just tug on the string," called Hal,
  originator of the idea. Hal had read about pearl diving. The weakest and
  least professional part of their equipment, he had pointed out, was the
  string. No diver would go down unless he was sure that his rope was strong
  enough to withstand pressure. Hal had just happened to find this string
  around a packing case. It wasn't awfully strong.</p>

  <p>"I hope he comes back sometime," murmured Spray, "I think there're a lot
  of things I could still do for him. Things that make you sad when you think
  of them," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"I should think they would make you sad," remarked Mrs. Pebble, "but
  considering his present state I think that you did quite a bit for him!
  What's the little fella doing now?"</p>

  <p>There was silence from the depths of the cellar. Everyone's ear was
  cocked, but nothing happened. No tug came on the rope; no sound was heard.
  "Drop the string a little farther, Nocka," said the Major. "Perhaps that will
  bring him to."</p>

  <p>"It ought to bring him to something," added Hal. "He must be at the bottom
  by now."</p>

  <p>"Well," suggested the Major, "I think we ought to give a little toast to
  Mr. Pebble's expedition. To the Rex Pebble Research Foundation!" The bottle
  was passed.</p>

  <p>As the party sat huddled on the basement stairs waiting for news from
  below, there was a great clatter above in the bar and the kitchen. Evidently
  Baggage had returned with her latest catch, young Kippie. Sounds indicated,
  however, that there was a third person accompanying the couple, and that this
  person was being most unwillingly dragged around.</p>

  <p>"It's no time of night to go about telling fortunes," remonstrated an
  elderly female voice, "and I can't understand how you could find that many
  people up at this hour to have their fortunes told them, anyhow. Just give me
  that drink you mentioned, and I think I'll be going along."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, you won't," cut in Baggage. "There're a lot of things these
  particular people ought to be told, and you're going to do it. Besides, the
  way we happened up with you is anything but creditable to your character.
  Suppose I were to tell?"</p>

  <p>The party on the steps listened in tense silence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," interrupted Kippie heatedly. "I never would have imagined that even
  a fortune teller could be so base."</p>

  <p>"I can't see anything wrong with what I did: it's what you were doing that
  was so shameless," protested the strange woman's voice.</p>

  <p>"Answer me this," demanded Baggage, "and we'll call it quits: would you
  have known we were in that hedge if you hadn't been psychic?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," returned the voice, "I can only say that even a medium
  uses her ears."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Baggage, "however it was, I'm expecting you to help us
  out. We're lucky to have you around. Come, Kippie, my pet, I think we'll just
  let Alma do her stuff. Where are my friends now?"</p>

  <p>On the floor above the group there came the sounds of the tap-tapping of a
  cane. "Holy Christmas," murmured Hal, "she's got a witch after us!"</p>

  <p>The tapping wavered in apparent uncertainty as to direction for a moment,
  then headed straight for the head of the stairs. "I should say they are
  somewhere in this neighborhood," wheezed Alma. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I can't see what they'd be doing in there," Baggage speculated, "but you
  may be right. There's no telling what these people are likely to do. What are
  you doing to find them?"</p>

  <p>"I'm following a mystic call for help," returned Alma. "It seems to come
  from the lips of a babe. This child seems to have fallen into bad company.
  The words it uses are anything but polite."</p>

  <p>"Is this babe a gentleman or a lady?" inquired Baggage. "I know a couple
  of babes here, but both of them use that kind of language."</p>

  <p>"Neither a gentleman nor a lady," snapped the woman, "as far as I can
  tell. It seems to be making a terrific effort to do something."</p>

  <p>"That must be Uncle Rex trying to get away from Sue and Spray," guessed
  Kippie.</p>

  <p>"Well, open the door. They can't be up to any good if they're all down
  there in the dark," returned Baggage. "Let's see what they're doing."</p>

  <p>"Aha," sneered Alma the medium, "who's being curious now?"</p>

  <p>The door to the stairway was opened, dropping a plane of bright electric
  light across the men and women on the steps. Faces flashed around guiltily.
  Hal and the Major grinned sheepishly, standing close around Nokashima's
  bent-over body, hoping to conceal the little man and his nefarious
  operations.</p>

  <p>"So!" Baggage packed a wealth of meaning into the word.</p>

  <p>"How long has this been going on?" inquired Kippie. "And where is my dear
  harassed uncle Rex?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's hanging around," Sue Pebble informed the girl, with some degree
  of truth.</p>

  <p>"Who's that," countered Major Jaffey, "that you have with you?"</p>

  <p>Baggage was not to be thrown off the track. "It's a fortune teller and
  character reader," she said, "and I want you all, including Rex Pebble, to
  come up here right now and have your characters read."</p>

  <p>"You flatter us," Spray Summers said sweetly. "Do you read between the
  lines?"</p>

  <p>"I tell everything I see, the whole story," said Alma the medium, with
  professional pride.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what," proposed Major Jaffey, "if she tells everything she sees
  and she can see without light, why not have her sit down right here and talk
  to us in the dark? That won't be any hardship on her, and it may save us a
  lot of blushes." There was no tug on the string from the Pebble infant. The
  whole party was beginning to undergo distinct misgivings as to Rex's
  whereabouts and condition. Supposing the poor creature had bashed in its head
  on the hard cement floor or strained its baby figure by the band around its
  middle? Any one of many horrible things might have overcome that small,
  bawling, protesting wine seeker in the dark of the underground place.</p>

  <p>"All right," Baggage conceded dubiously, "I guess we can do that. How
  about it, Alma?"</p>

  <p>"O.K. by me," responded the medium blithely. "All I need is a hand to look
  at, and a crack of light from the door here"&mdash;she seated herself
  &mdash;"will fix that." Baggage and Kippie joined the band on the stairs.
  "Who's first?" asked Alma.</p>

  <p>This threw the company into considerable confusion. Spray maintained that
  Sue, as the wife of Rex Pebble, should be first. Sue, on the other hand,
  declared that Spray Summers, as the mistress of the house, should be first.
  Alma spied Nokashima.</p>

  <p>"Bring him here," she commanded.</p>

  <p>Major Jaffey, of those in on the secret about little Rex Pebble, was the
  first to use his wits. "Oh, he's permanent," the Major said. "You can't move
  him. He has to stay there. Anyway, he'd be too hard to read."</p>

  <p>"I could read that fellow myself," remarked Baggage. "Come, come, there're
  a lot of fortunes to be done here tonight."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't do him," Alma objected in a hurt tone, "but I can, and I
  like 'em hard. Give me your hand, fella."</p>

  <p>Nokashima extended his left hand, with the right still clinging to the
  rope that held Rex Pebble. "No, the other," said Alma. "Don't be dumb." With
  the agility of Orientals, Nocka switched hands without letting go of the
  rope, on which there now came a violent tug.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Alma. "Are you afraid? That's the way with
  guilty minds." The hag bent inscrutably over the hand. It was wrinkled and
  tiny and difficult to see, but to the fortune-telling mind it contained a
  secret of great import. Alma started up in alarm. "He has something to do
  with a baby, something to do with that baby I was telling you about." She
  addressed Baggage. "There's some mighty funny business going on here."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," said Baggage, "but that's not news. Now, get your mind
  off babies and tell us what you see."</p>

  <p>Alma, however, was insistent in her messages of alarm. On the rope from
  Rex came heavier and heavier tugs of warning. Nocka found it hard to keep the
  rope in his fingers. He tried to slip it to Major Jaffey, but Alma
  intercepted him.</p>

  <p>"Stop twitching," she commanded. "Do you do that all the time? You
  Japanese have too much jujitsu in your blood." She scrutinized the hand. "I
  see blackness and a bottle and a baby and a rope."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like the difference between a hanging and a cocktail party,"
  said Baggage. The girl was growing impatient; there was a great deal to be
  done. Somehow, in the last few hours, she had begun to have her doubts as to
  whether or not mortals were ever happy. Give them youth, restore their
  physical attractions, smooth out their wrinkles, their memories, and what
  happened? What use did they make of their happiness, of this good fortune?
  Baggage remembered all her years on the marble column, the days of boredom
  and the nights of yearning. She thought of Rex Pebble and the graceful, manly
  form she had watched change with the years into the lines of age,
  distinguished though it was. There was a great deal, she felt, that she could
  tell human beings about their lives, and she longed for the opportunity to do
  so. Baggage had a growing feeling that, with an apparently incompetent medium
  in charge, she should take over the works and reveal what was on her
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the girl roughly to Alma. "Stop jabbering about babies, and
  I'll tell you a few things." She grabbed Nocka's hand. So excited was the
  little man with these rapid developments that he almost dropped the rope.</p>

  <p>"Excuse, madam," he murmured, "but greatly disturbed in mind. Impossible
  to have fortune told. You miss fortune."</p>

  <p>"I think I'm beginning to understand that you're all hiding something from
  me. Which hand shall I take?" Baggage grasped Nocka firmly around the waist
  and wrested the rope from him. "So," she said. "Maybe the old girl wasn't so
  wrong after all. Whose body is on the end of the string?"</p>

  <p>"That's what we've been disagreeing about," Major Jaffey informed her as
  she hauled the rope up hand over fist. The whole party looked aghast,
  watching with horror for the sight that should meet their eyes when Baggage
  drew in the last few feet of rope.</p>

  <p>The sight was deplorable but altogether different from what might have
  been expected. Rex Pebble held a bottle in one hand while with the other he
  swung his makeshift elevator from side to side. He was singing to himself.
  The voice was small, but it was hearty. The song was something about a French
  girl who had three lovers and what happened when they all went to war. Its
  tone was lewd, but Mr. Pebble, in his infantile way, seemed to find it highly
  amusing.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said the baby, interrupting his song. "So this is Baggage. Well,
  well, well! Where've you been since I dropped out of the picture? Have a
  drink, anybody?" Rex had gotten into the whisky section. His small, sweet
  mouth put forth a large, offensive breath. "If you won't give me a drink, I
  guess I'll just have to go around cellars grubbing for myself."</p>

  <p>Both Sue and Spray reached for the child as his body drew alongside the
  stairs. "Hi, there, Sue old girl," he sang out. "Been thinking about you.
  Business is better. I've got something big coming up."</p>

  <p>"That," remarked Sue, "would be news to me. Give him to me," she demanded.
  "I'm his wife."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'm his mistress, and this is our anniversary," complained Spray
  Summers.</p>

  <p>The women struggled to get at the baby. To Baggage, observing the pathetic
  situation of Rex Pebble, this was a crowning blow. For years she had
  worshiped the idea of the man. Had it not been for him, she would never have
  dived off the pedestal. Then he had been restored to youth; but so had Spray,
  dashing into the water in angry jealousy, and so had Sue, because Baggage
  her. self, out of pity and jealousy, had helped her. Baggage looked at
  Kippie. He was young and handsome, and he looked amazingly like the young Rex
  at whom she had gazed longingly for so many hours from her classic
  imprisonment, but there was something of Rex that the youth lacked. Baggage
  grew thoughtful. What was that escaped quality? Was it that she had grown
  used to Rex, had watched him so long that without the gestures he had
  acquired with time Kippie seemed lacking somehow? And was it that no one else
  in the world, however attractive he might be, or how near a replica of the
  original, could bear for her the same charm?</p>

  <p>Nokashima had rescued Rex Pebble from his two wrangling women, but they
  continued to fight for possession of him. The rest of the party looked on in
  awed silence. Things seemed to be drawing to a dramatic climax. Rex Pebble's
  face was a study in changing emotions; something magic and curious seemed to
  be working in it.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Baggage suddenly to the astonished Alma, "give me your hand
  and I'll tell you a thing or two."</p>

  <p>"I see two women fighting over a man," Baggage broadcast. "One woman has
  loved him a long time but never quite enough. The other has loved him a long
  time also, but too much. I see that their struggles over him have put lines
  into his face, because, even if they were given eternal youth, human beings
  would always fight over each other and make themselves old. I see that the
  longer they fight the older they grow before their time. I also see that
  something very strange is happening to a baby named Rex Pebble."</p>

  <p>As indeed it was. For, as the women argued, Rex grew older with each
  sentence, and the older he grew the tighter his home-made diapers fit
  him.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, shut up," said Rex, "or you'll have me busting this
  bath towel." He was almost full-grown now, and the towel stretched around him
  like the skin on a very fat pig.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you need," suggested Baggage, pushing the full-grown
  man off her lap. "Come with me," she said.</p>

  <p>"I think I can see that, for all your charity, you're still up to your old
  tricks," remarked Spray, who had not lost her grip.</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble, in splitting bath towel, sped up the steps, followed by the
  whole pack of guests and relations. He felt somehow gayer and more elated
  than during the whole evening, for the world had taken on a surety of beauty
  that he had not known before. After all that had happened, things seemed
  rather beautiful in the ways in which they best belonged. That is to say,
  being a distinguished old man would never seem quite so much a hardship
  again, he considered, provided one had a certain amount of wisdom not to wish
  for too much, and a lusty, unvarying sense of the ridiculous. He looked
  behind him as he sped, completely naked now, because the towel, unable longer
  to stand the strain, had burst asunder. Baggage was running almost as fast as
  he, and she was catching up. At his heels leaped the gay bloodhound puppy,
  Mr. Henry. After that came Spray and Sue, two beautiful, bounding figures of
  blonde and brunette youth, shouting wisecracks at one another as they sped.
  Then came Nokashima as fast as his short legs would carry him, Hal, and the
  Major. Alma, the old crone, lagged by the house, smirking and cursing.</p>

  <p>Rex wondered about his two women. The magic of the pool had given him a
  new light on them both, and the evening had been a curious kind of beautiful
  adventure, unique in the world. Sparkling satisfaction of the senses was all
  right, but he wouldn't care now if it came to a sudden end. For there was
  Spray Summers, a delightful, incurable wanton&mdash;Habeas Corpus was her
  middle name&mdash;and Sue Pebble, a strangely faithful and harshly helpful
  wife, both of whom loved him, and both of whom he loved.</p>

  <p>Baggage was the unattainable. When it came to running, he couldn't even
  keep up with her. She sped past him now, shedding her clothing as she
  ran.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Nurmi," she called, and her voice seemed almost to vanish in
  distance as she passed. "I'll race you to the pool."</p>

  <p>Rex Pebble exerted his last ounce of effort, with Sue and Spray hot after
  him. He wondered what the water would mean to them this time. It was clear to
  see where Baggage was headed: straight for the empty pedestal. If that was
  what the girl was going to do, what would he and Sue and Spray Summers do?
  The magic of the evening had not failed. Rex was not uneasy. Whatever might
  happen now, he was practically sure that it would be fun.</p>

  AS THORNE SMITH SAW IT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">
  Without so much as turning a hair I freely admit that I am one of
  America's greatest realists. And I'm not at all sure that this calm statement
  of facts does not take in all other nations, including the Scandinavian.</p>

  <p>Like life itself my stories have no point and get absolutely nowhere. And
  like life they are a little mad and purposeless. They resemble those people
  who watch with placid concentration a steam shovel digging a large hole in
  the ground. They are almost as purposeless as a dignified commuter shaking an
  impotent fist after a train he has just missed. They are like the man who
  dashes madly through traffic only to linger aimlessly on the opposite corner
  watching a fountain pen being demonstrated in a shop window.</p>

  <p>Quite casually I wander into my plot, poke around with my characters for a
  while, then amble off, leaving no moral proved and no reader improved.</p>

  <p>The more I think about it the more am I convinced that I'm a trifle
  cosmic. My books are as blindly unreasonable as nature. They have no more
  justification than a tiresomely high mountain or a garrulous and untidy
  volcano. Unlike the great idealists and romancers who insist on a beginning
  and a middle and an ending for their stories mine possess none of these
  definite parts. You can open them at any page. It does not matter at all. You
  will be equally mystified if not revolted. I am myself."</p>
