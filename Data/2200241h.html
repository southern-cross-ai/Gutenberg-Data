<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>The Preposterous Princess
(story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Smart Set</i>, August 1915</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Princess who was adorably
beautiful. She was so beautiful that all the Rotary Film Companies
in the world fell over each other trying to get a snapshot of her
ankles as she walked across Grosvenor Square. For, of course, she
lived in Grosvenor Square and kept five butlers, eleven maids and
fifteen expensive little dogs. She was so beautiful that, when she
came to London, three leading musical comedy ladies committed
suicide, and a fourth broke off an engagement to an earl and
married a boy she was fond of&mdash;just in sheer panic. By the
time she was twenty she had received four hundred thousand, nine
hundred and thirty-six offers of marriage.</p>

<p>Practically every unmarried male who saw her photograph wrote
and proposed. They came in vanloads from America, China, Japan,
India and the colonies. She was so beautiful that people looked at
her in the street and then fainted right away. She was so beautiful
that savage tribes in Central Africa fought over the torn remains
of a photograph of her in the illustrated weeklies. Editors of
daily papers bartered their principles, politicians went into
exile, artists went in sane, duels by the thousand took place every
day between men of note who quarrelled at the mention of her name.
By which you will gather that she was an exceptionally beautiful
woman.</p>

<p>One day a young man named Kismet Ug, an assistant in a dry-goods
store at Golgotha, Michigan, who had saved up a few hundred dollars
to do Europe, was passing through Grosvenor Square on his way to
the Wallace Collection, when he beheld the Princess walking across
the Square, followed by her fifteen dogs.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he murmured through a plug of chewing-gum, that he was
thoughtfully removing from one cheek to another, "this is the real
goods at last!"</p>

<p>He was a small, flat-faced boy with a yellow rubber face and a
large chin and a flat grey hat. He followed her to the house and
watched her go in, followed by her canine retinue. Then he stood by
the area railings and leaned his chin on the iron bars and
expectorated meditatively into the area. He stood there chewing for
five hours and then the Princess came out and got into an electric
brougham.</p>

<p>As she walked across the pavement he stepped forward and took
off his hat. It was the first time he had done such an act of
degrading obeisance, but he felt the cause merited it. However, the
Princess did not notice him, and he only succeeded in treading on
one of the dogs. For four days he stood there, repeating this
action. Every time the Princess came out he went up and took off
his hat, but the Princess did not see him.</p>

<p>On the fourth day a Georgian-looking gentleman in knee breeches
came out of the house and advised him to clear off "as he was being
watched." As he refused to do this the guards were called and he
was taken off to the guardhouse, where they fell on him and beat
him.</p>

<p>For fourteen days he lay in a dungeon without light or food. On
the fifteenth day he was back again hanging on the railing in
Grosvenor Square. When the Princess came out it was raining. She
glanced at the sky on the way to her brougham.</p>

<p>Before she had time to look down again, Ug had taken off his
coat and thrown it down for her to walk across. She walked round it
and got into her car and drove off. In the evening the guards came
again and fell on him again and beat him, and this time he was
thrown into a dungeon for thirty days. On the thirty-first day he
was back again in his position in the Square.</p>

<p>He had a wonderful chin. But the Princess was gone. He bribed
the postman and found that she had gone to the South of France, and
by this time Kismet Ug had no money. But time was urgent, so he
managed to bring off the "Spanish Prisoner" swindle on an innocent
old retired colonel and to relieve him of two hundred pounds and
then he went to seek his Princess. He found her at Mentone, staying
in a wonderful old chateau.</p>

<p>He stood outside the gate and bowed to the ground when she came
out. She was accompanied by a Finance Minister and two Generals and
she did not see him. But he waited there for three days. And then
the French Police fell on him and he was condemned to death as a
spy, but the day before he was to be shot, the wife of the head of
a Ruling State, who was visiting that part, gave birth to twins,
and to celebrate the event the Government granted amnesty to all
political offenders. He was released and returned to the chateau of
the Princess.</p>

<p>He waited there for thirty-six hours without seeing the
Princess. But one of the Generals had noticed him and he sent a
small platoon of his men and they seized him in the dark and threw
him into the sea. He was picked up by a Spanish vegetable boat and
taken to Algeciras, living all the time on beetroot and raw fish.
He was thrashed every night by the captain and made to do all the
roughest work. At Algeciras they took all his money from him and
threw him ashore. He worked his way through Spain assisting at a
travelling circus and at length reached France. He walked the
length of the Pyrenees living on acorns and moss and eventually
reached the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>He got a job in the dock of Marseilles and by going without food
for three days saved enough money to get to Mentone. When he
arrived there the Princess had gone. She had returned to London. He
bought a picture post card of her and set out for England, placing
it next to his heart. By borrowing a little money and playing
poker, at which he was singularly proficient, he eventually made
through to London and turned up at his railing in Grosvenor Square.
After waiting only two hours and a half she came out accompanied by
the king of some Near Eastern State, two Viscounts and a Scotch
architect, who had inherited a fortune. He went up and took off his
hat and the Scotch architect stabbed him in the wind with his
umbrella, taking him for a rate collector. He was carried in an
ambulance to a hospital, where he remained for three weeks. On the
day he came out he returned to his position, for he had a wonderful
chin.</p>

<p>This went on for three years and then, one day, the Princess
noticed him. He had tracked her down at the country seat of a Duke,
but there he made himself so importunate that the Duke had
instructed his gamekeepers to shoot him by mistake for a poacher.
But one morning the Princess was going for a walk by the lake with
her dogs (there were now forty-seven), when one of them, a Pekinese
that she called "Casserole," started foaming at the mouth and
running round in circles. This was Ug's opportunity. Since he first
met the Princess he had been studying Dog. He had Friedbergor and
Fruhner's Veterinary Pathology at his finger-tips. He sprang out
from behind a statue of Pan, where he had been hiding, and seizing
"Casserole" he injected a small tube behind the dog's ear and
"Casserole" became herself again. Several friends of the Duke
rushed up and would have torn him to pieces, but the Princess held
up her hand. "Stay," she said. "Spare him!" So they led him up to
the house, where the Duke, who was also a Justice of the Peace,
gave him two months in the third division for "loitering with
intent." But again the Princess intervened. "Listen!" she said, and
her voice was the most glorious music he had ever heard, "Listen! I
don't know who this horrid little man is, but he seems to be clever
at Dog. I will have him in my kennels." So Ug was released and
placed under the third dog-groom in the service of the Princess and
this was the golden hour of his life. For a year he saw the
Princess every day. And he became so proficient at boning pheasants
for the Pekinese and teaching the chows to do tricks that he was
made head groom, and on several occasions the Princess spoke to him
personally. But the passion of his life was consuming him. One day
he had just performed a very delicate and highly successful
operation on a Lhassa terrier called "Boco." The Princess came into
the Dogs' operating theatre, where Ug was manicuring his nails, and
thanked him with tears in her voice. Then Ug let himself go. He
knelt down and poured out his love. The full tide of his pent-up
passion poured forth in silver speech, hyphenated by the virile
vernacular of Golgotha. It was tremendous. The Princess had never
heard anything like it. She rang a bell and summoned her retinue of
princes, politicians, editors and financiers who were waiting in a
long queue in the hall to propose. They all trooped into the Dogs'
operating theatre. "Now!" said the Princess, touching Ug on the
shoulders, "do that again. It was beautiful." Ug turned round and
glanced at the sneering cortege of worshippers and his heart
quailed within him, but the touch of the Princess on his shoulder
fired his blood. Setting his chin, he started once more to declare
his passion in no uncertain terms. His eyes flashed and his bosom
heaved as he flung the fine flowers of his rhetoric among the
contemptuous followers. He piled Pelion on Ossa in lavish praise of
the Princess. He tore the stars from their firmament in vaunting
his ambitions. He was Caesar, Napoleon, John Stuart Mill in one. He
was immense.</p>

<p>A newspaper magnate, who was present, offered him the editorship
of any one of six hundred newspapers that he controlled. A Bishop
who had come all the way from Madagascar to propose to the Princess
went straight back that afternoon. Two Dukes took to drugs, and a
Japanese plenipotentiary hanged himself in the kennel next door.
The Princess was delighted. She raised his salary and sent him
fruit from her own table. Whenever an especially distinguished
crowd of visitors arrived they were taken out to the Dogs'
operating theatre to hear Ug propose. In time Ug became restless.
It was glorious, but not what he meant. One day he heard her tell
an ambassador that she would love to have a pergola of onyx and an
arcade with figures of the Muses carved in rock crystal, but she
simply couldn't <i>afford</i> it! This was at her country seat. The
remark gave Ug food for thought. The next day he went to her and
said: "Princess, may I give you a pergola of onyx, and an arcade
with figures of the Muses carved in rock crystal?" The Princess
clapped her hands and said: "Oh, yes, that would be beautiful!" The
thought also occurred to her that it would be a good way to get rid
of him, as the proposals were beginning to pall, and a troop of
Chinese fencers had turned up and were voted a more amusing
entertainment. So Ug left her and went away to find a pergola of
onyx, and an arcade with figures of the Muses carved in rock
crystal, and he found that onyx and rock crystal were the most
expensive materials in the world, and to carve figures full size
would cost millions of pounds. So he crossed the ocean and went to
Golgotha. Now, Golgotha is a place where no one lives; it is right
out beyond everywhere. It is a vast miasma of corrugated zinc and
high chimneys, and things crawl to and fro and stoke and rivet. Ug
got there and entered a rubber works. He stayed there for four
years. By working six teen hours a day and gradually ousting people
above him he eventually became the manager. He saved all his salary
and bought stock. He studied stock during the night, also rock
crystal. He returned a millionaire and went back to the Princess.
She was away from her country seat. He bribed the factotum to let
him have control of the garden while she was away. He engaged the
finest sculptors of the day and made the pergola of onyx and the
arcade of Muses in rock crystal.</p>

<p>At length the Princess returned. He hid behind a statue as she
drove up the drive. He saw her lean forward in her car and say to
the King of &mdash;&mdash;, who was riding with her, "Whatever are
all these horrid glass figures doing here?"</p>

<p>"These are the Muses carved in the rock-crystal, Princess," said
Ug, springing forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm tired of rock-crystal," said the Princess, and the
King of &mdash;&mdash;, who was a very big man and a fine polo
player, muttered, "Disgusting!" and getting out of the car he threw
all the Muses into the lake.</p>

<p>Ug stood there chewing and meditating and looking at the lake
all day, but toward nightfall the Princess, taking compassion on
him, sent for him to come and see her. "Of course," she said, when
he arrived, "I think it was very sweet of you to take all that
trouble, but I simply can't bear rock-crystal now&mdash;nobody has
it. But still I'm very sorry. If you like you can go and have some
supper in the servants' hall." Ug thanked her and retired, for he
really wanted his supper. But the next day he went to her and said:
"Princess, I'm sorry about that rock-crystal; of course I wasn't to
know you'd have gone off of it. I suppose it's natural. You are the
real goods. Tell me, what can I do for you? I have the stuff."</p>

<p>The Princess liked to hear people talk like that, so she said:
"Ah, I knew you were a clever little man. It's emeralds I'm
interested in now, emeralds and amethysts."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have the finest emeralds in the world," said Ug.
"If I bring these, will you&mdash;" He couldn't finish the
sentence, because the Princess was looking at him out of the corner
of her eyes, and it took his breath away.</p>

<p>"If you bring me these," said the Princess, "I will be very kind
to you," and she dismissed him.</p>

<p>Ug went back to Golgotha and realised all his remaining stock,
but he found that emeralds cost much more than he had, so he set to
work again, and he floated several companies and sold a railway
that didn't exist, and then started buying emeralds. In a year's
time his agents were all over the world buying emeralds and
amethysts for the Princess. At length he had all the best emeralds
and amethysts in the world and he drove up to her house in the
country with seven van-loads full. When the Princess saw the
emeralds and the amethysts, she said, "Oh, dear me, what a
lot!"</p>

<p>"They are yours," said Ug.</p>

<p>"But, you see," said the Princess, "I only wanted emeralds and
amethysts because the Duchess of K. had emeralds and amethysts and
I wanted better ones than hers; but now she doesn't seem to have
any. No one seems to have any; they are not worn!"</p>

<p>"I see," said Ug; "I've overdone it a bit." So he drove the
van-loads of precious stones to the village and gave them to the
village children, and they made wonderful grottos with them, and
there they remain to this day. But the Princess invited him to stop
to tea and Ug felt that all his efforts were justified. He sat in a
room packed with notabilities and watched them pass cake to the
Princess, for he was in too great a state of emotionalism to take
any part in the proceedings. But he felt he was making headway, and
the Princess even introduced him to the assistant secretary of the
Burmese Legation. She said, "This is Mr. Ug, who cured Boco." It
was wonderful; Ug was in his Seventh Heaven.</p>

<p>Before he was dismissed the Princess called him into the
library. "I am sorry about those emeralds," she said.</p>

<p>"It's <i>so</i> trying&mdash;the way people change, I mean."</p>

<p>"Let me try again," said Ug doggedly. "Anything in the world you
mention I will get for you."</p>

<p>The Princess signed, and then she said: "I am having a new
ceiling to my music-room. It would be lovely if I could have some
original ceiling paintings by Paul Veronese."</p>

<p>"If I bring you these&mdash;" said Ug, tentatively.</p>

<p>"If you bring me these&mdash;" said the Princess, and tears
sprang to her eyes and she held out her hand to him to kiss.</p>

<p>Three days later Ug was in Rome interviewing the Italian
Ministry. Much to his surprise he found that the Veronese ceiling
paintings in the Ducal Palace at Venice were not for sale.
Moreover, he learned that there was a law prohibiting the export of
Works of Art. Ug immediately set to work. By means of enormous
bribes he got numbers of the Opposition on his side who committed
themselves to get this law rescinded.</p>

<p>For four months he went up and down the country with his
confederates, bribing and cajoling. In the Spring, the Government
was overthrown, and the first law the new party passed was that
permitting the export of Works of Art. This led to Revolution. Thou
sands were killed in the streets of Rome and Milan. Foreign Powers
intervened. But on the night when the law was once more reinstated,
Ug smuggled the paintings out of the Ducal Pal ace and onto a
specially chartered steamer. In twelve days they were delivered at
the country house of the Princess. She was not there. She had gone
to Paris. Ug deposited the paintings in the basement (where they re
main to this day). In Paris the Princess received him with open
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Ug," she said, "I have been wanting you. Where have you
been?" Ug told her with all modesty. But the Princess seemed to
have lost interest in Art, she was full of a new idea.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ug," she said, "I want you to buy me Paris!"</p>

<p>"Paris!" said Ug.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, and her expression was devastating.</p>

<p>"If I buy you Paris," said Ug desperately, "will you marry
me?"</p>

<p>The Princess seemed very moved. She could hardly speak.</p>

<p>"Paris is a big thing," urged Ug; "it means big money. I will
have to go back to Golgotha and get a move on things."</p>

<p>"I will marry no one else or consent to marry anyone else till
you have bought me Paris," said the Princess ambiguously.</p>

<p>Ug left her presence inspired. He went right back to Golgotha.
He built new workshops and factories. He dealt in more stock. He
opened offices in Chicago, New York and Boston. He lay awake every
night scheming and plotting. He got railway concessions from
Foreign Powers and turned them into Companies and sold them. He
made a corner in ice-water and made the people pay a dollar a
pitcher for it. He floated bogus companies and sold things to
himself and bought them again and sold them again. He controlled
pig iron, mushrooms, blankets, jute, and nogger-pumps. Even then it
took him two years to raise sufficient capital to buy Paris. He
bought it lying in a bed at New York with telephones, electric
batteries, and wireless instalments fitted up all around him. When
the contract was completed he cabled to the Princess:</p>

<p>"Paris is yours, will you marry me?" Then he fell back on the
cushions and waited four months in breathless suspense.</p>

<p>In the meantime the machinery of his affairs worked of its own
accord. Vast masses of Capital accumulated and large staffs were
employed in all the Capitals giving away wash-houses, libraries and
swimming baths as rapidly as they could. Ug lay in bed, vitalised
by injections of strychnine and high-voltage electric batteries. At
the end of four months a cable arrived from the Princess.</p>

<p>"Wedding Delhi eighteenth Durbar rajahs and elephants."</p>

<p>The amazing ambiguity of this message, the uncertainty as to
whether it meant that she would marry him or someone else, whether
he was to arrange the Durbar and buy the elephants, or whether it
meant that she was going to marry a rajah or an elephant and was
merely inviting him to it&mdash;whether she meant the 18th of this
month or the next (if she meant this month it meant starting at
once and travelling a thousand miles a day for three weeks), put
him into such a fever that it brought on heart collapse and he
died.</p>

<p>When Ug arrived in Heaven, he was led before the Celestial
Tribunal and they asked him his name.</p>

<p>"Kismet Ug," he answered. At the mention of that name the
members of the Tribunal started and an official stepped forward and
said:</p>

<p>"Are we to understand that you are <i>the</i> Kismet Ug who gave
away all those wash-houses and libraries to towns all over the
world?"</p>

<p>"The same," said Ug.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the official, and he returned to the group.
There was a whispered consultation, then the official came forward
again and said:</p>

<p>"Kismet Ug, come with me!" They led him up and up through realms
of light and the official said:</p>

<p>"Kismet Ug, a special Paradise has been prepared for you.
Behold! Every thing has been thought of that your heart could
desire," and he pointed to a wonderful room where were lounges of
luxurious comfort and all around the walls golden cases filled with
cigars that Ug's experienced eye guessed would fetch at least nine
or ten dollars apiece on Broadway.</p>

<p>"This is dandy," said Ug.</p>

<p>"But this is not all," said the official, "follow me," and they
passed through wonderful corridors where the strains of Heavenly
music were wafted, and the official pointed to a diaphanous
curtain.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "all this is waiting for you, Kismet Ug, you
have only to lift the curtain and joy is ever present and Eternal
Beauty awaits you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ug, "and so it darn well can."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said the Celestial Authority.</p>

<p>"What I mean," answered Ug, "is, that she's missed her chance!"
and elbowing his way past the Powers of Heaven, he returned to the
smoke-room.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>To-morrow You Will be King
(story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, Oct 1916</p>

<p>To-morrow you will be king.</p>

<p>This is the best and most highly paid job that I give out. You
will have an enormous salary, and you will be able to buy anything
you like to eat or drink, but you must wear the clothes that I give
you. There will be several hundred suits, and you must wear them on
occasions as I dictate. You must always be thinking of ME and my
CONSTITUTION (spelled in very large capitals), and you must not
have any ideas of your own. You may think, but you must not express
your thoughts. You must not have any likes or dislikes, any
prejudices, any bias, or any political thought.</p>

<p>"Above all, you must not marry whom you like. I will find you a
wife. You see, I was once a slave, as you will be to-morrow, and I
like to keep you, although you are expensive to me, because you
remind me of that time; or, rather, you bring home to me how I have
developed, how I have become free, and I like to feel this power
that I, a People (with a very large P), may even keep one slave
myself, may even be a tyrant when the mood comes over me. For I
rejoice in you, and as you pass me in the street I will take off my
hat and bow to you, and when you deign to acknowledge me, I will
cheer and cry, 'God save the King!'</p>

<p>"To-morrow and every day after I shall introduce you to hundreds
and hundreds of people. You will not find them interesting, in fact
you will find them mostly tedious and dull, but you must remember
them all&mdash;all their names and faces and many facts concerning
them, so that in after years, if you meet one of them, you must be
ready to say, 'Ah, Mr. Brown, how is your youngest son getting on
in Nicaragua?' You must be very careful to remember that it
<i>is</i> the youngest son and that it <i>is</i> Nicaragua. If you
ask how his eldest son is getting on in Fiji, and his eldest son is
dead and had not even been to Fiji, you will estrange Brown, and I
value Brown very highly. He supports the exchequer of one of my
greatest parties. I shall expect this of you. It is what I am
pleased to call 'tact.' If you meet others, and you look into their
eyes, and they seem sympathetic to you, you must not treat them
with more cordiality than those to whom you take an aversion.</p>

<p>"You must worship in the church established by my prelates, and
considered best for you, and you must be strict in your
observances. Every day there will be many papers for you to sign,
but fortunately for you, you need not read them, for you must sign
them in any case. And when you open my house of government you must
read a speech. This speech will be written for you by some one you
won't know, and will be printed in bold type, so that it will not
be difficult to read.</p>

<p>"This holds good with every public act of yours. I try to make
it as easy for you as possible, so that you have no personal worry
or responsibility. You must not even refer to yourself as I; you
must say 'we.' This does not mean that there is more than one of
you, but it gives you emphasis, and lends point to the phrase, 'Le
roi est mort. Vive le roi!'</p>

<p>"You may have relaxation,&mdash;that is to say, you may have
change of scene and to a certain extent change of
society,&mdash;but you must never deviate by a hair's-breadth from
these restrictions that I have laid down. Into my life you will
bring color, history, pageantry, and a sense of form. For these
things I am prepared to pay you well and to stand by you.</p>

<p>"When your day is finished and you say your prayers and retire
to bed, in the silent watches of the night you may have whatever
thoughts you like. Of course I should prefer you to think of ME and
my CONSTITUTION, but I shall not exact that from you, provided your
thoughts do not color your actions of the preceding day. Now go,
sire, for to-morrow you will be king."</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Solemn Looking Blokes (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, Dec 1917<br>
<i>The Golden Book Magazine</i> #59, November 1929</p>

<p>At midday on August 15 I stood on the pavement in Cockspur
Street and watched the first contingent of American troops pass
through London.</p>

<p>I had been attracted thither by the lure of a public "show," by
the blare of a band, and by a subconscious desire to pay tribute in
my small way to a great people. It was a good day for London,
intermittently bright, with great scurrying masses of cumuli
overhead, and a characteristic threat of rain, which fortunately
held off. Cockspur Street, as you know, is a turning off Trafalgar
Square, and I chose it because the crowd was less dense there than
in the square itself. By getting behind a group of shortish people
and by standing on tiptoe I caught a fleeting view of the faces of
nearly every one of the passing soldiers.</p>

<p>London is schooled to shows of this kind. The people gather and
wait patiently on the line of route. And then some genial policemen
appear and mother the people back into some sort of line, an action
performed with little fuss or trouble. Then mounted police appear,
headed by some fat official in a cockade hat and with many ribbons
on his chest. And some one in the crowd calls out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Percy! Mind you don't fall off yer 'orse!"</p>

<p>Then the hearers laugh and begin to be on good terms with
themselves, for they know that the "show" is coming. Then follows
the inevitable band, and we begin to cheer.</p>

<p>It is very easy and natural for a London crowd to cheer. I have
heard Kaiser William II cheered in the streets of London! We always
cheer our guests, and we love a band and a "show" almost as much as
our republican friends across the channel. I have seen royal
funerals and weddings, processions in honor of visiting presidents
and kings, the return of victorious generals, processions of
Canadian, Australian, Indian, French, and Italian troops and bands.
I wouldn't miss these things for worlds. They give color to our
social life and accent to our every-day emotions. It is, moreover,
peculiarly interesting to observe national traits on a march: the
French, with their exuberant &eacute;lan, throwing kisses to the
women as they pass; our own Tommies, who have surprised the world
with their gaiety, and keep up a constant ragging intercourse with
the crowd and cannot cease from singing; the Indians, who pass like
a splendidly carved frieze; the Canadians, who move with a free and
independent swing and grin in a friendly way; the Scotch, who carry
it off better than any one. But I had never seen American troops,
and I was anxious to see how they behaved. I said to myself, "The
American is volatile and impressionable, like a child." I had met
Americans who within an hour's acquaintance had told me their
life-story, given me their views on religion, politics, and art,
and invited me to go out to Iowa or Wisconsin or California and
spend the summer with them. Moreover, the American above all things
is emotional and&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;sentimental. It would
therefore be extremely interesting to see how he came through this
ordeal.</p>

<p>The first band passed, and the people were waving flags and
handkerchiefs from the windows. We could hear the cheers go up from
the great throng in the square. And there at last, sure enough, was
Old Glory, with its silken tassels floating in the London breeze,
carried by a solemn giant, with another on each side. And then they
came, marching in fours, with their rifles at the slope, the
vanguard of Uncle Sam's army. And we in Cockspur Street raised a
mighty cheer. They were solemn, bronzed men, loose of limb, hard,
and strong, with a curious set expression of purpose about
them.</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>And they looked neither to the right nor the left; nor did they
look up or smile or apparently take any notice of the cheers we
raised. We strained forward to see their faces, and we cried out to
them our welcome.&nbsp;Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</p>

<p>They were not all tall; some were short and wiry. Some of the
officers were rather elderly and wore horn spectacles. But they did
not look at us or raise a smile of response. They held themselves
very erect, but their eyes were cast down or fixed upon the back of
the man in front of them. There came an interval, and another band,
and then Old Glory once more, and we cheered the flag even more
than the men. Fully a thousand men passed in this solemn
procession, not one of them smiling or looking up. It became almost
disconcerting. It was a thing we were not used to. A fellow-cockney
near me murmured:</p>

<p>"They 're solemn-looking blokes, ain't they?"</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>The band blared forth once more, a drum-and-fife corps with a
vibrant thrill behind it. We strained forward more eagerly to see
the faces of our friends from the New World. We loved it best when
the sound of the band had died away and the only music was the
steady throb of those friendly boots upon our London streets. And
still they did not smile. I had a brief moment of some vague
apprehension, as though something could not be quite right. Some
such wave, I think, was passing through the crowd. What did it
mean?</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>The cheers died away for a few moments in an exhausted
diminuendo. Among those people, racked by three years of strain and
suffering, there probably was not one who had not lost some one
dear to them. Even the best nerves have their limitation of
endurance. Suddenly the ready voice of a woman from the pavement
called out:</p>

<p>"God bless you, Sammy!"</p>

<p>And then we cheered again in a different key, and I noticed a
boy in the ranks throw back his head and look up. On his face was
that expression we see only on the faces of those who know the
finer sensibilities&mdash;a fierce, exultant joy that is very near
akin to tears. And gradually I became aware that on the faces of
these grim men was written an emotion almost too deep for
expression.</p>

<p>As they passed it was easy to detect their ethnological
heritage. There was the Anglo-Saxon type, perhaps predominant; the
Celt; the Slav; the Latin; and in many cases definitely the Teuton:
and yet there was not one of them that had not something else, who
was not pre-eminently a good "United States-man." It was as though
upon the anvil of the New World all the troubles of the Old, after
being passed through a white-hot furnace, had been forged into
something clear and splendid. And they were hurrying on to get this
accomplished. For once and all the matter must be settled.</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>There was a slight congestion, and the body of men near me
halted and marked time. A diminutive officer with a pointed beard
was walking alone. A woman in the crowd leaned forward and waved an
American flag in his face. He saluted, made some kindly remark, and
then passed on.</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>The world must be made safe for democracy.</p>

<p>And I thought inevitably of the story of the Titan myth, of
Prometheus, the first real democrat, who held out against the gods
because they despised humanity. And they nailed him to a rock, and
cut off his eyelids, and a vulture fed upon his entrails.</p>

<p>But Prometheus held on, his line of reasoning being:</p>

<p>"After Uranus came Cronus. After Cronus came Zeus. After Zeus
will come other gods."</p>

<p>It is the finest epic in human life, and all the great teachers
and reformers who came after told the same story&mdash;Christ,
Vishnu, Confucius, Mohammed, Luther, Shakespere. The fundamental
basis of their teaching was love and faith in humanity. And
whenever humanity is threatened, the fires which Prometheus stole
from the gods will burn more brightly in the heart of man, and they
will come from all quarters of the world.</p>

<p class="poem">He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of
wrath are stored;<br>
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible, swift
sword.</p>

<p>There is no quarter, no mercy, to the enemies of humanity, This
is no longer a war; it is a crusade. And as I stood on the flags of
Cockspur Street I think I understood the silence of those grim men.
They seemed to epitomise not merely a nation, not merely a flag,
but the unbreakable sanctity of human rights and human life. And I
knew that whatever might happen, whatever the powers of darkness
might devise, whatever cunning schemes or diabolical plans, or
whatever temporary successes they might attain, they would
ultimately go down into the dust before "the fateful lightning."
"After Zeus will come other gods."</p>

<p><i>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</i>
</p>

<p>Nothing could live and endure against that steady and
irresistible progression. And we know how you can do things,
America. We have seen your workshops, your factories, and your
engines of peace. And we have seen those young men of yours at the
Olympic Games, with their loose, supple limbs, their square, strong
faces. When the Spartans, lightly clad, but girt for war, ran
across the hills to Athens and, finding the Persian hosts defeated,
laughed, congratulated the Athenians, and ran back
again&mdash;since those days there never were such runners, such
athletes, as these boys of yours from Yale and Harvard, Princeton
and Cornell.</p>

<p>And so on that day, if we cheered the flag more than we cheered
the men, it was because the flag was the symbol of the men's
hearts, which were too charged with the fires of Prometheus to
trust themselves expression.</p>

<p>At least that is how it appeared to me on that forenoon in
Cockspur Street, and I know that later in the day, when I met a
casual friend, and he addressed me with the usual formula of the
day:</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>I was able to say:</p>

<p>"Yes, the best news in the world."</p>

<p>And when he replied:</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>I could say with all sincerity:</p>

<p>"I have seen a portent. The world is safe for democracy."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>The Chinese Philosopher and the
European War (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, Jan 1917</p>

<p>It may seem a remarkable fact that in the World War in which
nearly all nations are engaged, the oldest, wisest, and greatest
nation is not only not participating, but is apparently looked upon
as a negligible quantity by the belligerent powers. Surely no
greater tribute could be paid to the wisdom and the greatness of
the Chinese.</p>

<p>Some one has said that "No man was ever so wise as some Chinamen
look." But will not these cataclysmal European happenings
demonstrate a denial of this statement? Will they not prove that
some one is as wise as some Chinamen look, and that person the
Chinaman? In his rock garden near Peking the Chinese philosopher
sits fanning himself. His mind communes with the spirits of his
ancestors, and meditates upon the unforgetable wisdom of the Lord
Confucius.</p>

<p>He recalls how a few idle centuries ago the continuity of these
peaceful meditations was disturbed by the sudden arrival of
restless infidels on his shores. Even now he can see their
strained, feverish faces. To the trained eye they differed from one
another; they spoke different languages, wore different clothes,
had different casts of countenance, but to the all-seeing eye they
were fundamentally the same. They preached the same
doctrine&mdash;a doctrine they labeled "progress, civilization."
They professed several mushroom faiths, the dominant one being
called "Christianity," concerning which they differed profoundly,
and split up into many subdivisions. The Chinese philosopher
recalls the faces of their emissaries who came to him and said:</p>

<p>"Wake! You must advance, you must bestir yourself!" He can
almost recall the tones of mild remonstrance of his own voice.</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"To progress. To become civilized, to enter into the great world
competition."</p>

<p>They hardly stayed to listen to the serene philosophy which his
master would have inspired him to instill into them if they had
stayed to listen, they were in so restless a hurry. They said:</p>

<p>"If you do not do this, we will destroy you."</p>

<p>They were off again to struggle with one another for good
positions on his shores, there to carry on their strange and
unaccountable practices of buying and selling, and distributing
soul-destroying spirits to the undisciplined, and to erect tin
temples to their&nbsp;parvenu Gods. He saw their fussy gunboats on
his rivers destroying human life.</p>

<p>Some there were who were disturbed by these actions, and came to
him and said:</p>

<p>"What shall we do concerning this? Shall China stretch forth her
hand?"</p>

<p>And he had answered:</p>

<p>"China is linked to the sun and moon by immemorial ties. Look
into your heart, my children, and read the words of the
All-Wise."</p>

<p>And then, as the centuries rolled by, he observed that it was
not China they destroyed; it was one another. The wind bells tinkle
under the eaves of the pagoda. Soon in all her glory the sun will
be setting. A messenger enters and kneels in low obeisance.</p>

<p>"Excellency, the Western World is at war. Already ten million
men have fallen by the sword."</p>

<p>"Ai-e-e!" He draws the wind through his teeth with a whistling
inflection. "What Western World is this?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"They who enunciate the doctrine of progress, civilization,
culture, O Excellency!"</p>

<p>"Ai-e-e!"</p>

<p>He meditates upon this for some time. He harbors no feelings of
animosity against these people who had threatened to destroy him;
only his heart is filled with a strange, pitying misgiving that
there should be so much lack of culture, so little appreciation of
the value of inner progress, and so exaggerated a sense of the
value of outer progress.</p>

<p>Wood-pigeons are cooing in their cot above the temple, and the
sound, mingling with the low chanting of a priest, tends to
emphasize the tranquility of the evening. Ten million men! It is
very sad, very deplorable; but he banishes these melancholy
thoughts, for he knows that his mind must be occupied with far more
important matters. It is the hour when, in strict accordance with
immemorial precepts, he must look into his own soul.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Mr. Van Heel of Virginia
(story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Strand Magazine</i>, January 1918</p>

<p>Old Jamesson was something of a character. The position he held
in the firm of Quinson and Beelswright, the famous decorators and
furnishers, was unique. It was a known thing that in the eyes of
the directors old Jamesson could do no wrong, or, in any case, he
could do no radical wrong. All his eccentricities and peccadilloes
were easily forgiven. The man had a certain florid force of
character, and he was moreover one of the best judges of antique
furniture and porcelain in London, and no mean critic of what is
called Fine Art. He was a large man with puffy red cheeks and grey
curls, and he wore check trousers, white spats, and a
tortoiseshell-rimmed monocle. His manners were not always
irreproachable. He took snuff, ate and drank prodigiously, had many
little affectations, a quick and tempestuous temper, no sense of
humour, but a heart of gold. He was a great favourite of Mr. Hugh
Quinson's, the managing director of the firm, who understood him
entirely, and who would in expansive moments pat him on the back
and call him "Johnny." He had been with the firm for nearly twenty
years, and for nine years of that period he had been in charge of
the antique department, and it was only by exercising the greatest
tact that Mr. Quinson had been able to ultimately remove him from
that position to one of being a head salesman and sub-manager. The
trouble with old Jamesson in the antique department was that,
although he was an excellent buyer, he seemed to resent having to
sell these rare and beautiful objects he had been at such pains to
collect. He liked to walk about among them and touch them with his
fat fingers, and breathe heavily upon their cloistered beauty. If a
customer showed a disposition to buy one of his favourite pieces,
he would instantly depreciate it, and he had, moreover, a native
instinct for candour that was not strictly in accordance with the
canons of the commercial side of antique dealing. He would
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it looks a fine piece, but only one leg is genuine,
the rest is copied."</p>

<p>Or he would shake his head and remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, madam, I don't agree with you. The upper part of this
cabinet is fair, but the lower part is quite wrong in style."</p>

<p>Things are not said like that in the antique trade, and so he
was gradually relieved of the responsibility of this position, and
was only allowed to confine himself to the control of more frankly
modern things. The change, though equally remunerative to old
Jamesson, and far more remunerative to the firm, cannot be said to
have produced in the former any elevated sense of satisfaction. Of
course, the work was easy enough. He knew the furnishing trade
inside and out, as he explained to everyone, but the modern aspect
of it bored him. He left all the details of the jobs he had in hand
to his assistant, Shenton. This Shenton was also a source of
boredom to him, but at the same time an invaluable young man. He
had a thin, cadaverous face, a restless eye, and a very retentive
memory. He was always on the make, and conducted goodness knows how
many businesses in his spare time. His chief hobby in life seemed
to be to "get someone by the short hairs." He was always scheming
and planning, and, though old Jamesson despised him, and was bored
by him, he realized his merits, and was at times even a little
afraid of him.</p>

<p>On a certain morning in June old Jamesson was sent for by Mr.
Quinson, who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, Johnny, here is an inquiry you might attend to. It is from
an American named Justus Theodore Van Heel. He has bought Gilling's
Manor, at Wayneshurst, fifteen miles down the line in Surrey. He
wants it done up. I have looked him up in our secret reference
list. He is all right. His money is in real estate and gilt-edged
securities. Give him any credit he wants."</p>

<p>The prospect of interviewing an American millionaire did not
raise the spirits of Mr. Jamesson very considerably, and if it had
been a dull day he would probably have sent Shenton off on this
expedition; but the day was brilliantly fine, and he was not very
busy, so he decided to go himself.</p>

<p>He met Mr. Van Heel on the lawn of Gilling's Manor. He was a
small, sallow-faced man, with white hair and keen grey eyes. He was
quick in his movements, but, in Jamesson's opinion, curiously
reserved for an American. He was extremely courteous, and, indeed,
gave the impression of a host ministering to a guest rather than a
client dealing with a tradesman. He took Jamesson over the house
and explained his requirements, and asked him his opinion upon
every point. It was a charming Queen Anne building in a fair state
of repair, although it had not been lived in for some years. His
demands were quite simple. He was apparently going to live there
alone, but the size of the mansion would necessitate certain
renovations, and of the ten bedrooms all except three were to be
put in order, For the rest, he wanted everything kept much as it
was.</p>

<p>On the way upstairs he murmured: "I have a few pieces of old
furniture," and Jamesson's interest quickened perceptibly.</p>

<p>One packing-case had arrived, and was lying on the floor on the
first landing. The lid had been removed, and a pot was standing on
the floor and a small statuette on a side-table. As they passed,
Jamesson stooped and passed his fingers over the glaze several
times. Then he muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Genuine Ming."</p>

<p>He then looked closely at the statuette, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tanagra."</p>

<p>The American looked at his visitor with one of his quick
glances, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know something about&mdash;works of art, Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Jamesson. Yes, I know a little."</p>

<p>They passed on in silence, each feeling a little more drawn
towards the other. Mr. Van Heel said, at last:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall hope you will do me the favour of giving me your
opinion upon all my other goods when they arrive."</p>

<p>"It will be a great pleasure," Jamesson panted, following
heavily in the wake of his more nimble companion.</p>

<p>When they had been all over the house, Mr. Van Heel led him into
the garden. On the east side of the house the ground was level for
about a hundred yards, and then ended in an abrupt embankment. This
embankment, which extended for some distance, was probably the
normal elevation of the land, but at some time the ground below had
been levelled, and had been converted into a lawn and fruit garden.
Mr. Van Heel, for some reason or other, seemed a little agitated.
He coughed, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to come this way?"</p>

<p>When they arrived at the embankment, he pointed to it, and
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have the idea to make a squash-racket court here."</p>

<p>It would not have been surprising if old Jamesson had expressed
astonishment at this request, but he had been in the furnishing
trade for over thirty-five years, and he knew that it was not his
business to be surprised at any suggestion made by a client,
particularly a wealthy one.</p>

<p>He said: "Yes, sir. Do you wish it cut out of the
embankment?"</p>

<p>The American's idea was quite simple. It was to be as it were
sunk into the embankment, with concrete walls and a concrete base,
a small gallery upstairs netted in, a flat skylight, and two
powerful arc lights giving almost the effect of daylight, so that
his guests could, if they liked, play after dinner or in the winter
when it got dark early.</p>

<p>Jamesson listened to Mr. Van Heel's instructions, and took down
one or two notes in his pocket-book, and came to a mental decision
that this would be a very good job for Shenton to see through. He
mildly wondered once or twice at such an elderly gentleman as Mr.
Van Heel requiring a squash-racket court, and being so keen and
determined about all the details; he also wondered why he should
insist on its being built so far away from the house when there was
an excellent site for it in a yard which adjoined the servants'
quarters. But he did not give the matter much attention at the
time. His mind was more occupied with the Ming pot on the staircase
and the Tanagra statuette. The hour was also approaching when he
was in the habit of having a long and refreshing drink, and he knew
he had nearly a two-miles' walk to the station.</p>

<p>When they arrived back at the house, however, all his
apprehensions on this score were set at rest, for Mr. Van Heel
immediately led into the dining-room, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must allow me to offer you a little refreshment before your
journey."</p>

<p>A bumper glass of Jamesson's favourite beverage was set before
him, and a cigar the like of which he had never imagined existed
found its way between his teeth. He observed that his host only
drank Vichy water. He was a peculiarly mild and gentle little man.
Jamesson had never met an American who talked so little. He was no
great talker himself, and the silences would have been almost
embarrassing but for the fact that he felt strangely drawn towards
this unusual client. When it became time for Jamesson to go, Mr.
Van Heel stood up, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My automobile is here. It will take you to the station.
Perhaps, Mr. Jamesson, you will do me the favour of meeting me at
my flat in town, when we can discuss the disposition of the various
pieces of furniture. I have some Franois premier work which may
interest you."</p>

<p>This was a job after Jamesson's own heart, and he readily
assented, and returned to town in better spirits than he had been
for some time. He handed the instructions to Shenton, with the
remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, get out an estimate for this lot."</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday Jamesson met Mr. Van Heel by
appointment at a flat in Westminster, and he spent a most
entrancing day. He arrived there at twelve and stayed till a
quarter to six. The two men lunched on whisky and sandwiches. In
the whole course of his career Jamesson had never come across such
a fine private collection of old furniture, paintings, and
<i>objets d'art</i>. Mr. Van Heel became garrulous. It was
obviously the hobby of his life, the one thing he was really
interested in. Jamesson responded with warmth. He had met a kindred
spirit. It was a glorious time. He had never met anyone before with
such a sympathetic passion for old "pieces." So interested did they
become in discussing their antiquity, their beauty, their
proportions, the slightly doubtful authenticity of certain
sections, that they quite forgot the original idea of the visit,
which was to determine where the different pieces were to be placed
in Gillings Manor. Consequently a further visit had to be arranged.
When Jamesson arrived home that night he felt that a new light had
come into his life. A kindred spirit. He was very cheerful. He
lived with his wife, two daughters, and a son and rather ugly house
in Kensington. It was a pleasant innocuous m&eacute;nage, where all
sorts of allowances were made for "the eccentricity of papa." But
when "papa" was in a good temper, the general standard of happiness
and comfort was equal perhaps to that of any other middle-class
family in the neighbourhood. On this particular evening, when his
wife commented on his buoyant frame of mind, he
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I met a very charming man in business to-day, my dear, very
charming indeed."</p>

<p>During the ensuing month Jamesson went about his work with a
kind of stolid zest. He did not hurry or behave with any outward
sign of excitement, but he worked quietly and well. He would
sometimes hum an unrecognizable tune under his breath, and he
showed a disposition to be kind to everyone, and even tolerant to
Shenton. The work at Gilling's Manor proceeded, and he met Mr. Van
Heel three or four times in town and twice in the country. It could
not be said that they became friends, but they became peculiarly
sympathetic on the one theme. Jamesson was conscious that Van Heel
had taken to him. He liked to have him to talk to and to listen to;
but he was also conscious that there was an unbridgeable reserve
between the American and himself. He noted that if the discussion
threatened to develop beyond the bounds of this subject which
absorbed them, Mr. Van Heel drew Back. He did not seem disposed to
talk about himself or his life or his thoughts. And Jamesson,
realizing this, respected the other man's mental attitude, and made
a point of also avoiding the personal equation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the wells of their mutual interest were
inexhaustible. They went to Christie's together, and Mr. Van Heel
bought a Diaz at Jamesson's suggestion. And they went to the South
Kensington Museum and the National Gallery, and even poked about
among antique shops in Soho. They talked Spode and Worcester,
cloisonn&eacute;, Limoges, Heppelwhite, Chinese lacquer, Daubigny,
the French transition period, Della Robbia, the quinquecentists,
everything that really matters in this life. Jamesson found a
revived interest in the society of his newly-found
acquaintance.</p>

<p>It was not till the renovations at Gilling's Manor had been
nearly completed that a sudden intrusion came to disturb this
pleasant intimacy. It happened one evening in September. Jamesson
had been working late, and he had adjourned to the bar of the Green
Turtle to enjoy a well-merited tankard of ale before returning
home, when Shenton came into the bar. He was looking strangely
excited. He had apparently been drinking. His upper lip quivered,
and his eyes had a restless, furtive expression. He came straight
over to Jamesson and leered at him.</p>

<p>Jamesson blinked at his assistant, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Shenton nervously licked the end of a cigarette, and called for
some whisky. He was very mysterious. He nodded and winked, and
glanced apprehensively round the bar. He had been staying down at
Wayneshurst for a few days, superintending the Gilling's Manor job,
and had just returned. Jamesson got impatient at these antics, and
he said, irritably:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the job going all right?"</p>

<p>Shenton nodded, and then leaned a little closer. Suddenly he
whispered thickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, who is this 'ere Van Heel? What do you know about 'im,
eh?"</p>

<p>Jamesson bridled somewhat, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you mean, 'What do I know about 'im'? He's all right,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>Shenton loomed with things of tremendous importance. He winked
again, and drained his glass. Then he pulled Jamesson by the
coat-sleeve a little farther away from a group of men talking
earnestly about ratting. And suddenly he made a series of most
surprising suggestions to Jamesson. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Van</i> Heel? <i>Von</i> Heel, I should say!" Then he leaned
forward and whispered: "'Ere, what's an old man like that want a
squash-racket court for? What about the concrete foundations as a
base for a big howitzer, eh? What about Wayneshurst? Fifteen miles
from South London, eh? A big gun from there could raze Kensington,
Streatham, and Brixton to the ground in half an hour, eh? What's 'e
want these 'ere powerful arc lights for at night, throwing a light
straight up at the sky from the top of an embankment? What sort of
name is Van Heel? What nationality would you call 'im, eh?"</p>

<p>An expression of surprise and disgust came over Jamesson's face.
He exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Heel is a gentleman; one of the best!"</p>

<p>Shenton leered, and called for another whisky.</p>

<p>"Well, you can guess what <i>I</i> think, and I'm on 'is
track."</p>

<p>As Jamesson looked at his assistant at that moment, he realized
for the first time that he had the thin pointed face of a
sleuth-hound. He hated the man. It was abominable. He would not
hear a word of such nonsense. He muttered, angrily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rubbish! Go and hold your silly head under a tap!"</p>

<p>But Shenton was quite unperturbed by this insult. He was too
full of importance, and whisky. He had found his right
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>. A 'tec! He had indeed been dwelling upon this
idea for some time, and coming up in the train he had visualized
his own portrait on the front page of the <i>Daily Photo.</i> "Mr.
James Shenton, the smart young furniture salesman, whose clever
dispositions in the first place led to the discovery." Phew! it was
going to be exciting. Recognition, fame, and a fat cheque from some
official quarter, and then to the deuce with the furnishing trade!
Jamesson could read something of these vivid anticipations on the
face of his assistant, and his only desire was to escape from him.
And he did so by deliberately turning his back on him and walking
out of the bar.</p>

<p>But he spent a restless night. Of course, the suggestions were
absurd, preposterous! He would have none of them. A man like' Mr.
Van Heel, who loved Limoges enamels, and could tell the date of any
piece of furniture at a glance, a spy! There was nothing of the spy
about him, except his reserve. Yes, certainly he was very reserved
about his private life. But so were many others. The squash-racket
court was peculiar but not unreasonable. And the arc lights that
made the court like daylight? Well, if people wanted to play the
silly game at night, they must see. There was nothing in this. Of
course, as Shenton said, the position was peculiarly good
for&mdash;what he hinted at. It was at the crest of a long,
gently-rising slope. It commanded South London. But this was merely
coincidence. The name? Well, a name meant nothing. At its worst it
was only Dutch. He would dismiss the whole thing from his mind. And
he would take Shenton away from this job and see it through
himself.</p>

<p>But in this latter resolution he reckoned without his host.
Shenton was prepared for this, and he was rather too clever for
him. He had all the details at his finger-ends, and when Jamesson
tried to take it up, he soon got into a muddle. In disgust, he
handed it back to Shenton again, and told him "to get on with it,
and not have quite so much of the Sherlock Holmes."</p>

<p>Shenton accepted this gibe without a word, and soon made it his
business to go down to Wayneshurst again and stay the night. In the
meantime Jamesson once more went out with Mr. Van Heel, and they
visited more exhibitions and sales together. He thought the
American seemed a little more nervous and abstracted than usual,
but perhaps this was only his imagination. "The squash-racket court
was completed before the rest of the work. Shenton then stayed down
there for several nights at the local inn. It is difficult to know
what might have been the outcome of what he called his
"dispositions," if the old tag, "<i>in vino veritas</i>," had not
exerted its influence on his behaviour. For he came up to town one
evening a little "the worse for wear," as Someone described him in
the bar of the Green Turtle, and in the excitement of his mood he
blabbed his scheme into the ear of Jamesson.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night," he said, "I'm going to get Mr. Herr von Heel
by the short 'airs. I'm going to fix him all right."</p>

<p>And then he explained that for the last week, every night after
dinner, Mr. Van Heel had crept out to the squash-racket court and
shut himself in for about half an hour, and had then returned to
the house. Shenton could not see what took place there, for a dark
green blind was drawn over the skylight, but he could see that the
powerful lights were on inside. But now the astute salesman had
arranged a little device of his own. The framework of the skylight
was supported by a double brick wall, but Shenton, with his own
hands, had loosened one of the outer bricks at the back of the
ventilator. To-morrow night he was going to lie in wait for Mr. Van
Heel. He would lie on his face on the top of the embankment and
remove the brick before Mr. Van Heel came, and then when he entered
the court, Shenton would be able to observe him comfortably through
the ventilator without being seen himself. He was consumed with his
brilliant cunning, and simply could not keep his excitement to
himself. Jamesson scowled blackly, but made no comment.</p>

<p>But to Shenton's disgust, on the following day he was just
sitting down to an early chop and a whisky and soda in the Bull
Inn, at Wayneshurst, when the big man came in. Shenton started and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halloa! what are you here for?"</p>

<p>Jamesson replied casually:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just down for a change of scenery. I'm going out for a
stroll with you after you've finished making a beast of
yourself."</p>

<p>Shenton was very annoyed. He cursed his alcoholic mood of the
previous evening which had led him into blabbing the truth. He
didn't want anyone else in this. This was <i>his</i> show. He'd
done all the work and made all the "dispositions." He didn't fancy
having Jamesson's photograph alongside his own in all the
illustrated weeklies. He wanted all the glory to himself. It was
most unfair. And he said as much; but Jamesson was adamant. Shenton
could not see how he was to prevent his heavily-built senior from
accompanying him, for nothing apparently but physical force could
stop him, and Shenton had it not. He sulked, and tried to lie, but
Jamesson stolidly smoked a pipe and waited.</p>

<p>After Shenton's meal they started out together in silence. It
was a dark October night and inclined to rain. They walked the two
miles to Gilling's Manor without exchanging comments, and
approached the embankment from the back. Shenton soon found the
shallow brick wall which enclosed the framework of the skylight. He
felt along it with his hand, and his teeth were chattering
unaccountably. Jamesson felt cold and wretched but determined. He
detested spying; it was no business of his what Mr. Van Heel did in
his own racket-court. But he had come to see that Shenton didn't
make a fool of himself, and he meant to hang on to him at all
costs.</p>

<p>Shenton produced a screwdriver and a narrow strip of steel and
the brick came away quite easily. And then they waited. A few dim
lights in the house, away among the trees, showed that activity, of
Some sort was in progress. A dog barked and then became silent.</p>

<p>They seemed to wait an interminable time, but at length Shenton
muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's coming."</p>

<p>They saw a dark figure come quietly up the gravel path that had
been cut up to the court. It moved quickly and deliberately, and
soon they heard a key turn in the outer door which was of wood, and
then the door slammed, There was a narrow vestibule between the
outer door and the door of the court, which was of iron and fitted
flush to the walls. In a few seconds they heard the iron door open,
and then the court was flooded with light. The two salesmen had to
have their faces unpleasantly close together to obtain any view at
all, and for some minutes they believed they were not going to see
anything. They could just observe the top of Mr. Van Heel's head as
he moved about in the court. But at last he produced a long deal
board and placed it against the wall. Then he unrolled something
and pinned it up on the board. They could see the object very
distinctly, but they could only see the back of Van Heel's head,
and then he sat down and they could not see him at all.</p>

<p>Now, when these two watchers observed this thing pinned upon the
board it produced in them two very diverse emotions. In Shenton it
produced a feeling of utter disappointment and disgust. To Jamesson
it was the most amazing moment of his life. To Shenton it was just
a portrait of a girl painted in oils, but to Jamesson it was
something which sent his heart beating Violently against his ribs,
for he recognized it at once. It was nothing less than the famous
"Santa Maria" by Leonardo da Vinci, which had five years previously
been cut out of its frame in the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts in
Paris, and had never been heard of since. Van Heel! His friend Van
Heel had stolen it!</p>

<p>Jamesson was glad of the darkness. He drew back and wiped his
brow. He heard Shenton mutter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a dirty wash-out!"</p>

<p>Jamesson managed to pull himself together sufficiently to
whisper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've made a blankety fool of yourself. Let's get back."</p>

<p>But Shenton insisted on remaining. He wanted to see what his
intended victim meant to do. He could not believe that an oil
painting alone could be the motive for these nocturnal visits. He
could not be robbed so easily of his bombs and flashlight signals.
And so they both continued peeping through the grille. But so far
as they could see, Mr. Van Heel did nothing but sit there and gaze
at the portrait.</p>

<p>It was most disappointing. At the end of about twenty minutes
the lights went out, the doors banged, and they heard the American
returning along the gravel path to the house.</p>

<p>The two men stood up, and Shenton became sulkily abusive. He
cursed the silly sentimental old fool who had gone to all this
trouble "to look at the portrait of some girl he had been in love
with." He became violently insulting to Jamesson, but that
gentleman was hardly listening to him. He was very much consumed
with his own internal fires. He wanted to get away from Shenton and
think this thing out. At the inn he said good night abruptly and
went up to his room. But it was many hours before Jamesson found
his well-earned sleep. He lay there racked by the contemplation of
this preposterous crime. It was incredible, amazing, and
yet&mdash;it was a crime he could appreciate and even sympathize
with. He had heard the "Santa Maria" appraised at the value of
twenty thousand pounds. Mr. Van Heel was a very rich man. He had
not stolen it for its money value. He would not in any case be able
to sell it. Why had he taken it? How had he Managed it? Ought
Jamesson to give him away? These questions kept revolving
restlessly through his brain. Jamesson was a simple-minded man. His
sins were always placed jauntily in the shop window. He had a
reputation for candour and straight dealing, but he was not
necessarily matter-of-fact. The romance of the furnishing trade was
a favourite theme of his. And on that still night there occurred to
him that in all his career he had never encountered quite such a
romantic experience as this, no episode which so dovetailed with
his own peculiar sensuous aspirations.</p>

<p>It was tremendous! How the man must love Art. Fancy risking his
whole life and reputation to acquire a picture so that he might
secretly call it his very own. Imagine the fierce moods of
exultation he would enjoy as he stole into the private chamber
night after night and gloated over the beauty of the thing he had
torn from the vulgar gaze of the public.</p>

<p>What a risk the man must have run! What a passion it must have
been that stirred him to this desperate action. And so&mdash;the
squash-racket court with its concrete floors and its windowless
walls, the powerful arc lights that made the room at night "like
daylight!"</p>

<p>And that fool Shenton! The great bulk of Jamesson shook the bed
with laughter when he thought of his discomfited assistant. Thank
God he hadn't recognized the work. He wouldn't know one painting
from another, the chicken-headed tyke!</p>

<p>Jamesson returned to town next day, but he became restless and
abstracted in his work. He could not determine his own course of
action. The affair obsessed him. And he desired passionately to
share his secret knowledge with someone. At last he acted in a
manner that was characteristic of him. He wrote to Mr. Van Heel and
asked for an appointment in town. He went to the flat in
Westminster, and when he was alone with his client he said quietly,
but deliberately:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen your 'Santa Maria.'"</p>

<p>The effect of this remark was electrical. He saw the little
American start from his chair, his face change colour, and his hand
automatically slip towards a hip-pocket. Jamesson proceeded in
level tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have no intention of betraying your&mdash;secret."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel stood wildly gazing at him, his breath coming
quickly, and his thin hands clutching the table for support. He
made a curious choking noise in his throat, and then swayed and
sank back to the chair and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Jamesson, feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed, looked down at
his hat, and then proceeded to take out and fill his pipe. The
American did not speak. At length Jamesson managed to say,
thickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must apologize for intruding. My assistant&mdash;an
interfering young devil, but he knows nothing. You must not be
disturbed. It is a matter which concerns no one but yourself. I
should not dream&mdash;perhaps I can understand."</p>

<p>But still Mr. Van Heel was silent. At last he rose and walked
unsteadily to the fireplace. With his back to Jamesson, he said in
a low, clear voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Jamesson, you have been very considerate to me. I
appreciate your kindness. I am very&mdash;I cannot express myself
for the moment."</p>

<p>Then he paused and added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you will return this afternoon at five o'clock, I will try
to let you understand better. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jamesson stood up and bowed heavily. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will agree to come back at five o'clock, and I do not hold
you to any explanation. As I have said, I pledge myself to entire
secrecy in the matter, but I must make one stipulation."</p>

<p>"What is that?" answered the American, without turning.</p>

<p>"That you hand me that revolver from your hip-pocket."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel started and turned, and Jamesson thought he
detected a tear on the brink of his eyes. Slowly he drew out his
revolver and placed it on the table. Jamesson picked it up and
added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And that you promise not to do anything&mdash;foolish till I
return."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel paused, and then bowed his head, and Jamesson
withdrew.</p>

<p>When he returned at five o'clock, Mr. Van Heel was alone in the
flat. It was a cold, bleak day, and the streets were already
lighted. A bright fire was burning in the drawing-room, and his
host led him thither.</p>

<p>"Please sit down," he said.</p>

<p>He seemed to have aged since the morning, but his face had a
calm, resigned expression. He took a seat facing the fire, with his
profile towards Jamesson. He started speaking immediately, as
though anxious to relieve himself of some terrible strain.</p>

<p>"You have been very sympathetic to me, Mr. Jamesson, and I am
entirely in your hands. I do not deny that I have the picture you
mention. I can only tell you my story, and trust to your generosity
of heart to treat me as leniently as you think fit. I will be as
brief as possible. I come of an old Southern family from Virginia.
We were raised on most strictly puritanic&mdash;exclusive lines. It
was even a great source of annoyance to my parents that I took an
interest in Art. I had known my wife since we were children. She
also came of an old family, the Lowrys, who were if anything more
exclusive than ourselves. In fact, we saw very few other families
in our State. It was a sort of understood thing&mdash;the Van Heels
and the Lowrys had been connected for generations. We were married
at twenty-five. We were very happy. We had one daughter, the
darling of our lives. Her name was Anna. We lavished on her all our
love and care and wealth. We built up splendid dreams for her. She
was the most beautiful thing that ever danced in the sun. She had
all our Southern pride, but something of the free-moving,
independent <i>nuance</i> of the North. We enjoyed nearly twenty
years of unalloyed family happiness, and then suddenly one day our
daughter announced that she had fallen in love with a young
sailor&mdash;an ordinary seaman working before the mast in a
coastal steamer. I need hardly say that my wife and I protested. We
forbade her to see him, or him to enter our house. But the affair
went on. She saw him secretly, and my wife was furious. There was
one terrible interview. We all lost our tempers. My daughter walked
out of the house and&mdash;I have not seen her since."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel paused and pressed his handkerchief against his
brow. Then he continued more slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For years we believed she would return. In the first flush of
anger we destroyed all her portraits and photographs. Then we
repented. I wrote to her, but either she did not get the letter, or
she was too proud to answer. We heard that she had married the
sailor, and had gone to sea, but we heard nothing more. Three years
went by, and we became disconsolate, and at length my wife died in
my arms."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel again paused, and buried his face in his hands, and
spoke drearily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I travelled after that. I visited various ports, hoping to meet
her. Then I came across to Europe and wandered about England, and
Italy, and France. I sank into a low, maudlin state, and I believe
to a certain extent my mind became unhinged. I was in Paris one
day, and I drifted into the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts. Looking
at paintings was the only interest I had in life. Suddenly I came
face to face with the 'Santa Maria' of Leonardos. The thing was
amazing. Apart from being such a beautiful work, it was incredibly
like my daughter Anna! It had her same proud smile, the same queer
way of peering at you, even the hair and the colour of the eyes
were the same. I gazed at it breathlessly. It was the only thing in
the world which recalled her. I had no other record. Every day for
weeks I went to the Acad&eacute;mie and gazed at this wonderful
portrait. I was not happy away from it. The knowledge that it was
there seemed to keep me sane. At last the thing became an
obsession. I could think of nothing else. I determined to steal
it."</p>

<p>Jamesson leaned forward.</p>

<p>"How did you manage that?" he asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel sighed.</p>

<p>"They say, Mr. Jamesson," he answered, "that money can
accomplish anything. I certainly spent a good deal of money
acquiring the 'Santa Maria.' And I do not propose to bore you with
all the details of it. In fact, I have forgotten many of them
myself. I can only say that I ran no risks at all on the score of
expense. It involved buying a confectionery business in the Rue
d'Abernon, which, as you know, runs at the back of the
Acad&eacute;mie. I employed two gentlemen of adventurous
disposition. One came from Texas, the other was a Frenchman. You
may remember that at the time of the robbery two attendants were
found asphyxiated in Gallery VII., and the picture was cut neatly
out of the frame, while an entrance had apparently been cut through
a shutter and a window and had been effected from the iron
fire-escape emergency staircase. These things are apparently
astonishingly simple if you take enough pains and trouble. My
friend from Texas threw a lariat from our roof on to the flagstaff
of the Acad&eacute;mie at three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of twenty-five yards or so. It was then an
affair of rope-ladders and rubber piping. The Frenchman was a
chemist&mdash;a charming person, with anarchical tendencies: but a
kind heart. From a series of large cylinders in the top room of the
confectionery business in the Rue d'Abernon we pumped quantities of
a very penetrating but quite innocuous gas through the ventilators
of five galleries in the Acad&eacute;mie. We knew that these
galleries were separated from the rest of the building at night by
iron fireproof doors, but we could not, of course, be sure in which
one the attendants might be at the time. So we gassed them all. The
result was entirely successful. The two men were found sleeping
peacefully in Gallery VII., although I might add that a pack of
cards was found between them and also a bottle of beer. M. Touquet
was even thoughtful enough to remove these incriminating objects
before we left, after we had cut the picture from its frame. We did
not want the men to get into trouble. I was amazed at the
simplicity and success of the whole scheme. I paid M. Touquet and
Len Pollard ten thousand dollars each. Pollard is now running a big
ranch in Arizona and is the father of five splendid children, and
Touquet, I believe, is in Russia, 'working politically,' he tells
me.</p>

<p>"I left Paris soon afterwards and came to England, smuggling the
picture through the false bottom of a trunk. It has been a source
of endless comfort to me, my one connecting link with those I
loved. But I have always been haunted by the fear of discovery. In
hotels nothing is sacred. And even in a private house there are
always Servants. Rooms have to be cleaned out. I did not want to
arouse suspicion. It was one day in the Royal Automobile Club here
that the idea of a squash-racket court occurred to me. I thought
that anything to do with sport would probably not arouse suspicion
in this country. And the court has no windows, and I am undisturbed
at night. I keep the picture in the locker which you made for
rackets and balls, and of which no one has the key but myself. That
is all my story. I do not attempt to extenuate my crime, for crime
it undoubtedly is, and I place myself entirely at your disposal. My
only plea is my unhappiness. I am
unhappy&mdash;unhappy&mdash;unhappy."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to express the exact effect that this
amazing story had upon Jamesson. He could not reconcile the
opposing motives of pride and sentimentality which had prompted the
Southern States man to act in the way he had. He was to a certain
extent disappointed. It shattered his dream of that splendid sin
which appealed to him far more&mdash;the sin of a man whose passion
for Art was so great that he had fallen in love with the thing
itself&mdash;had risked his life for it. Jamesson could not for the
moment concentrate. His slow-moving mind became only conscious of
the fact that he was in the presence of a fellow-being who was
suffering intensely. He fumbled with his hat, and could only keep
repeating: "Please do not disturb yourself. It is understandable. I
shall not betray you."</p>

<p>He did not know how he escaped from the presence of Mr. Van
Heel. He went about his work for days as though in a dream.
Everyone found him distracted and apt to be quarrelsome, and at
home "the eccentricity of papa" became a nuisance to all his
family. The job at Gilling's Manor was completed, and the account
sent in and paid for by return of post.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, several months later before any further
development took place. And then one Friday he received a
telegram:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you come down and see me to-morrow? Car will call for you
at three.&mdash;VAN HEEL."</p>

<p>It was a clear April day when Jamesson once more alighted at the
front porch of Gilling's Manor. On either side of the porch two
beds of crimson tulips struck a note of gaiety. The lawn was rolled
and cut and in good condition. There was indeed about the whole
establishment an air of brightness that did not seem to
characterize it before. As he was about to enter the hall a girl in
a white frock, carrying a basket and a pair of garden scissors,
came singing out of the house. She looked at Jamesson and smiled
and passed on, and the large salesman stood there spellbound. The
girl appeared to him the reincarnation of the "Santa Maria."</p>

<p>He had not time to recover from his astonishment when he found
himself ushered into the white-panelled library. Mr. Van Heel,
looking years younger and with his face flushed with some innate
excitement, sprang to his feet and shook his hand. At the same-time
he cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Jamesson, I'm very pleased to see you. Allow me to
introduce you to my son-in-law, Captain David Stoddard."</p>

<p>A tall, good-looking man with iron-grey hair rose from his seat
and shook Jamesson's hand. He was in the uniform of a United States
naval officer. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Jamesson, I'm pleased to meet you."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been telling my son-in-law all about you, Mr. Jamesson.
And I propose that we three go and have  game of
squash-rackets."'</p>

<p>And he laughed gaily.</p>

<p>The three of them strolled out into the garden and up towards
the embankment.</p>

<p>When they entered the court, Mr. Van Heel locked the door on the
inside and opened the locker. He produced the painting and pinned
it on the board.</p>

<p>"Now!" he said.</p>

<p>Captain Stoddard looked at it and remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gee! It's certainly like her, though it's not very
flattering."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Heel laughed, and Jamesson blew his nose violently. Then
the owner of the house said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Jamesson, I've made a full confession of my crime to my
son-in-law, as I did to you. We are the only three men who know the
truth about the 'Santa Maria.' You were good enough to say you
would preserve my secret, and my son-in-law, with a generosity
which I do not deserve, has also forgiven me and promises to keep
silent. There only remains now the disposition of the picture,
which I no longer require. I cannot take it back and I cannot
destroy it. I therefore propose to ask you to take it and to do
with it whatever you think fit, and please do not think I wish to
be patronizing if I ask you to accept this little present as a
recognition of your trouble and the kindness of heart you showed me
in peculiarly trying circumstances."</p>

<p>And he handed the astonished Jamesson a cheque for five hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>On the lawn outside they met Anna, with her basket full of
flowers. She smiled and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you three been doing?"</p>

<p>"We've been playing squash-rackets, dear."</p>

<p>"You don't look very hot," she remarked, and then her cheeks
dimpled roguishly as she added, "I believe you keep a canteen in
that funny little house."</p>

<p>Jamesson returned to town by train. Between his teeth he
thoughtfully chewed a cigar which cost sixpence. On the rack above
him was a cylindrical-shaped brown paper parcel containing an
object which he had reason to believe was worth twenty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>"The furnishing trade is a very romantic business," he kept
thinking to himself.</p>

<p>When he arrived home, he told his wife that he had some letters
to write, so he went up to a little room at the top of the house,
which he called his den. Then he unwrapped the brown-paper parcel
and gazed lovingly at the picture. And strange moods and
temptations came to him. How romantic that would be! For one man to
have secretly this&mdash;perhaps the finest work of art in the
world&mdash;to creep up every night alone and revel in its
absorbing beauty! Not to steal it for its gain, or even for its
sentiment, but for joy in the thing itself! Jamesson sighed and
lighted his pipe. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. He sat there
a long time looking at the picture. At last he packed it up again
and locked it in a cupboard and went to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning he was up earlier than usual. He wrote out a
label in Roman lettering:&mdash;</p>

<p>AU PATRON,<br>
ACAD&Eacute;MIE DES BEAUX ARTS,<br>
PARIS.</p>

<p>He was no French scholar, and he felt a little uncertain about
the "patron," but he knew the owner of an hotel was a patron, so
why not an academy? In any case the Acad&eacute;mie officials would
get it.</p>

<p>Then he strolled out at his usual time and went to an obscure
post-office where he was not known.</p>

<p>"Will you register this, please?" he said, to the girl.</p>

<p>He was handed the receipt and sighed and went out into the
street. He hummed to himself a passage of a phrase that was meant
to be an excerpt from an Italian opera.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Quinson and Beelswright's he found Shenton
standing in his office with his hat and coat on. |</p>

<p>"I'm through with this hole," said the assistant.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Jamesson.</p>

<p>"I'm fed up. D' you understand?" Shenton exclaimed, somewhat
hysterically. "I've sent in my resignation to the boss and I'm
going. This place is dull&mdash;dull&mdash;dull! It may be all
right for old buffers like you, but it's not romantic enough for
me. I'm off to Australia. Nothing ever happens here. It's simply
killing me."</p>

<p>Jamesson blew out his cheeks.</p>

<p>"I see," he said.</p>

<p>"They can have my next week's salary," continued Shenton. "I'm
going now." And he held out his hand. Jamesson took it.</p>

<p>"So you're going to Australia?" He raised his eyebrows and
thought ponderously. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you're right. Australia ought to be just the
place for a bright boy like you."</p>

<p>He fumbled with his pocket-book, and suddenly produced two
five-pound notes.</p>

<p>"Don't think I bear you any animosity, Shenton," he said. "Here
is a little something towards your expenses. Perhaps you'll think
considerately of me at times."</p>

<p>He gazed heavily at a small pile of letters on his desk.</p>

<p>"They say," he remarked, "that a rolling stone gathers no moss.
Well, I suppose that's true, but we all have to roll a bit to find
the right sort of moss that suits us. But when you find the moss,
Shenton, freeze on to it. Do one thing decently well. It pays in
the end."</p>

<p>He hung up his hat and coat.</p>

<p>"If you take my advice," he added, "you'll avoid the detective
business. Stick to trade. Even trade has its romance if you only
look for it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>The Return (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, Apr 1918<br>
<i>Land and Water</i>, Mar 7 and Mar 14 1918</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, in the first place, to explain that I am, or
rather was, a librarian at the suburban library of Chadstow Heath.
When I first received this important appointment my salary was
eighty pounds a year, but after six years' assiduous application to
my duties it was advanced to one hundred and twenty pounds a year.
I am married and have two children, and we lived in Gentian Villa,
which is convenient to the library and barely ten minutes' walk
from the heath itself. This may not represent to you a condition of
material prosperity, but I would venture to point out that all
these matters are entirely comparative. To a successful sugar
broker or a popular comedian I must appear in the light of a
pauper. To my own family I have always appeared to be something of
a plutocrat. For you must know that I owe my education and whatever
advancement I may have made to my own efforts at a national school,
and the privileges of continuation classes. My father was a small
greengrocer, and his family, which was a very large one and
peculiarly prolific, has in no instance except my own risen above
the social standard that he set for us. I hope this statement of
mine will not sound priggish. It is simply a very bald assertion of
truth. All my relatives are dear good people; it is simply that
they do not, and never have, taken any interest in what is called
education. My brother Albert is a greengrocer, as our father was,
and he has seven children. Richard is in a leather-seller's shop.
He earns more money than I did, but he has eleven children.
Christopher is a packer at the Chadstow Heath Emporium. God has
blessed him with three small offspring. Will is unmarried, and I
couldn't tell you quite what he does. He is something of a black
sheep. My sister Nancy is married&mdash;alas! unhappily&mdash;to a
worthless traveler in cheap jewelry. She has two children. Laura is
the wife of an elderly Baptist who keeps a tobacco kiosk on
Meadway. She is childless. Louie, my favorite sister, is not
married, but she has a child. But her tragedy does not concern this
story.</p>

<p>In fact, the details of the entities neither of myself nor of my
brothers and sisters are of very great importance in what I want to
tell you, beyond the fact that they will give you a clue to the
amazing flutter among us that accompanied the appearance of our
Uncle Herbert when he arrived from Africa. The truth is that I
believe that every one of us had entirely forgotten all about him.
Albert and I had a vague recollection of having heard our father
refer to a delicate young brother who bolted to South Africa when
he was a young man, and had not been heard of since.</p>

<p>But, lo and behold! he turned up one evening suddenly at Gentian
Villa when my sister Louie and her child were paying us a visit. At
first I thought he was some impostor, and I was almost on the point
of warning my wife to keep an eye on the silver butter-dish and the
fish-knives which we always displayed with a certain amount of
pride on our dining-room sideboard.</p>

<p>He was a little, wizened old man with a bald head and small
beady eyes. He had a way of sucking in his lips and continually
nodding his head. He was somewhat shabbily dressed except for a
heavy gold watch and chain. He appeared to be intensely anxious to
be friendly with us all. He got the names and addresses of the
whole family from me, and stated that he was going to settle down
and live somewhere in London.</p>

<p>When one had got over his nervy, fussy way of behaving, there
was something about the little man that was rather lovable. He
stayed a couple of hours and promised to call again the next day.
We laughed about him after he had gone, and, as relatives will,
discussed his possible financial position. We little dreamed of the
surprising difference Uncle Herbert was going to make to us
all.</p>

<p>He called on all the family in rotation, and wherever he went he
took little presents and made himself extremely affable and
friendly. He told us that he had bought a house and was having it
"done up a bit." And then, to our surprise, we discovered that he
had bought "Silversands," which, as you know, is one of the largest
houses on Chadstow Heath. It is, as Albert remarked, "more like a
palace," a vast red-brick structure standing in its own grounds,
which are surrounded by a high wall.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the day when we were all, including the
children, invited to go and spend the afternoon and evening. We
wandered about the house and garden spellbound, doubting how to
behave, and being made to feel continually self-conscious by the
presence of some half-dozen servants. It would be idle to pretend
that the house was decorated in the best of taste. It was lavish in
every sense of the word. The keynote was an almost exuberant
gaiety. It was nearly all white woodwork or crimson mahogany, with
brilliant floral coverings. Masses of naturalistic flowers rose at
you from the carpet and the walls. And the electric lights! I've
never in my life seen so many brackets and electroliers. I do not
believe there was a cubic foot of space in the house that was not
brightly illuminated. And in this gay setting Uncle Herbert became
the embodiment of hospitality itself, about among us, shaking
hands, patting the heads of the children, passing trays of rich
cakes and sandwiches. The younger children were sent home early in
the evening, laden with toys, and we elders stayed on to supper.
And, heavens! what a supper it was! The table was covered with
lobster salads and cold turkey and chicken and ham and everything
one could think of. On the side-table were rows of bottles of beer
and claret and stout and whisky, and as if a concession to the
social status of his guests, uncle dismissed the servants, and we
waited on ourselves. The little man sat at the head of the table
and blinked and nodded and winked at us, and he kept on
repeating:</p>

<p>"Now, boys and girls, enjoy yourselves. Albert, cut a bit o'
fowl for Nancy. 'Erbert, my boy, pass the 'am to yer aunt."</p>

<p>Uncle was the life and soul of the party, and it need hardly be
said that we soon melted to his mood. I observed that he himself
ate very little and did not drink at all. For an oldish man, whose
digestion was probably not what it had been, this was not a very
remarkable phenomenon. I should probably not have commented upon it
but for the fact that it was the first personal trait of my uncle
that arrested my attention, and that, in conjunction with more
peculiar characteristics, caused me to keep a closer watch upon him
in the days that followed. For this supper-party was but the
nucleus of a series of supper-parties. It was given out that
"Silversands" was an open house. We were all welcome at any time.
Uncle was never so happy as when the house was full of laughing
children, or when his large circle of relatives chattered round the
groaning board and ate and drank the prodigal delicacies he
supplied. Not only were we welcome, but any friends we cared to
take were welcome also. I have known thirty-three of us to sit down
to supper there on a Sunday evening. On these occasions all the
house was lighted up, and, in fact, I have no recollection of going
there when every electric light and fitting was not fulfilling its
utmost function.</p>

<p>Apart from abstemiousness, the characteristic of uncle which
immediately gripped my attention was what I will call
abstraction.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a very noticeable characteristic. He had a way
of suddenly shrinking within himself and apparently being oblivious
to his surroundings. He would make some gay remark and then
suddenly stop and stare into space, and if you spoke to him, he
would not answer for some moments.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity was that he would never speak of Africa or
of his own affairs. He had a convenient deafness that assailed him
at awkward moments. He seemed to be in a frenzy of anxiety to be
always surrounded by his own family and the ubiquitous electric
lights. When the house was quite in order I do not think he went
out at all except into the garden.</p>

<p>He was scrupulously impartial in his treatment of us all; in
fact he had a restless, impersonal way of distributing his favors
as though he were less interested in us as individual persons as
anxious to surround himself with a loving and sympathetic
atmosphere. Nevertheless,&mdash;and it may quite possibly have been
an illusion,&mdash;I always felt that he leaned a little more
toward me than toward the others, perhaps because I was called
after him. He always called me "'Erb, boy," and there were times
when he seemed instinctively to draw me apart as though he wanted
to hide behind me. Realizing his disinclination to indulge in
personal explanation, I respected the peculiarity and talked of
impersonal things or remained silent.</p>

<p>It was, I think, Albert who was the most worried by uncle's odd
tricks. I remember he came to me one night in the smoking-room
after a particularly riotous supper-party, and he said:</p>

<p>"I say, 'Erbert,"&mdash;all my family call me
'Erbert,&mdash;"what I'd like to know is, what is uncle staring at
all the time?"</p>

<p>I knew quite well what he meant, but I pretended not to, and
Albert continued:</p>

<p>"Of course it's all right. It's no business of ours, but it's a
very rum thing. He laughs and talks and suddenly he leaves off and
then he stares&mdash;and stares&mdash;and stares into space."</p>

<p>I mumbled something about uncle's age and his memory wandering,
but Albert was not to be satisfied and he whispered:</p>

<p>"How do you think the old boy made his money? Why don't he never
say anything about it?"</p>

<p>I could offer no satisfactory explanation, and we dropped the
subject. But a month or so later our interests were all set more
vividly agog by uncle's behavior, for he suddenly expressed his
determination not merely to entertain us as usual, but to help us
in a more substantial way. He bought and stocked a new shop for
Albert, He set Richard up in business and gave Christopher a
partnership in it. He paid Will's passage out to Canada and gave
him two hundred pounds to start on. (I believe Will had already
been trying to borrow money from him, with what result I do not
know.) He offered me some light secretarial work to do for him in
my spare time, for which he agreed to pay me sixty pounds a year.
As for the girls, he bought them a life annuity bringing them in
fifty pounds a year.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that this new development created considerable
joy and sensation in our family, and our interest in and respect
for Uncle Herbert became intense. I felt very keen to start on my
"light secretarial duties," and at the back of my mind was the
thought that now I should have an opportunity to get some little
insight into uncle's affairs. But in this I was disappointed. He
only asked me to go on two evenings a week, and then it was to help
check certain expenses in connection with the household, and also
to begin collecting a library for him. I made no further progress
of an intimate nature. The next step of progression in this
direction, indeed, was made by Albert, somewhat under cover of the
old adage, <i>in vino Veritas</i>. For on the night after Albert's
new shop was opened we all supped at uncle's, and Albert, I'm
afraid, got a little drunk. He was, in any case, very excited and
garrulous, and he and Christopher and I met in the smoking-room
late in the evening, and Albert was very mysterious. I would like
to reproduce what he said in his own words. He shut the door
carefully and tiptoed across the room.</p>

<p>"Look here, boys," he said. "The old man beats me. There's
something about all this I don't like."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," I remarked. "What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>Albert walked restlessly up and down the room; then he said:</p>

<p>"I've been watching all the evening. He gets worse. I begin to
feel frightened by him at moments. To-night when they were all
fooling about, I happened to stroll through the conservatory, and
suddenly I comes across uncle. He was sitting all alone, his elbows
on his knees, staring into space. ''Ullo, Uncle!' I says. He starts
and trembles like, and then he says, ''Ullo, Albert, my boy!' I
says, 'You feeling all right. Uncle?' and he splutters about and
says: 'Yes, yes, I'm all right. 'Ow do yer think your business will
go, Albert?' he says. I felt in a queer sort of defiant
mood&mdash;I'd had nearly half a bottle of port&mdash;and suddenly
I says straight out, 'What sort of place is Africa, Uncle?' His
little eyes blazed at me for a moment, and I thought he was going
to lose his temper. Then he stops, and gives a sort of whimper, and
sinks down again on his knees. He made a funny noise as if he was
goin' to cry. Then he says in that husky voice: 'Efrica? Efrica?
Oh, Efrica's a funny place, Albert. It's big&mdash;' He stretched
out his little arms, and sat there as though he was dreamin'. Then
he continues, 'In the cities it's struggle and struggle and
struggle, one man 'gainst another, no mercy, no quarter.' And
suddenly he caught hold of my arm and he says, 'You can't help it,
can yer, Albert, if one man gets on, and another man goes under?' I
didn't know what to say, and he seems to shrink away from me, and
he stops and he stares and stares and stares, and then he says in a
kind of whisper: 'Then you get out on the plains&mdash;and it's all
silent&mdash;and you 're away up in the karoo, and there's just the
great stone slabs&mdash;and nothing but yer solitude and yer
thoughts and the moon above. And it is all so still&mdash;' Then he
stops again, and suddenly raises his little arm and points. Christ!
for all the world as though he was pointin' at somethin' 'appenin'
out there on the karoo!"</p>

<p>Christopher rose from his seat and walked to the window. He was
pale.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Albert," he said. "What does it matter? Ain't
'e done you all right? Ain't 'e set you up in the
green-grocery?"</p>

<p>Albert looked wildly round, and licked the end of a cigarette
which had gone out.</p>

<p>"I don't see that there's anything we can do," I remarked
unconvincingly.</p>

<p>Albert wiped his brow.</p>

<p>"No," he argued; "it ain't our business. It's only that
sometimes I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish his remark, and we three brothers looked at
one another furtively.</p>

<p>And then began one of those curious telepathic experiences that
play so great a part in the lives of all of us. I have complained
that none of my brothers or sisters showed any leaning toward
education or mental advancement of any sort, but I have not perhaps
insisted that despite this it was one of our boasts that we were an
honest family. Even Will, despite his recklessness and certain
vicious traits, had always played the game. Albert and Richard and
Christopher had been perilously poor, but I do not believe that
they would have ever acted in a deliberately dishonest or mean
fashion. I don't think I would myself, although I had had perhaps
rather less temptation. And despite our variety of disposition and
trade, we were a fairly united family. We understood one
another.</p>

<p>The advent of Uncle Herbert and his peculiar behavior reacted
upon us unfavorably. With the accession of this unexpected wealth
and security we became suspicious of one another. Moreover, when we
brothers met together after the evening I have just described, we
looked at one another half knowingly, and the slogan, "It ain't no
business of mine," became charged with the acid of mutual
recrimination. As far as possible we avoided any intimate
discussion, and kept the conversation on a detached plane. We were
riotously merry, unduly affectionate, and, according to all the
rules of the game, undeniably guilty.</p>

<p>What was uncle staring at? I would sometimes wake up in the
night and begin feverishly visualizing all sorts of strange and
untoward episodes. What were these haunting fears at the back of
his mind? Why was he so silent on the primal facts of his position?
I knew that in their individual ways all my brothers and sisters
were undergoing a similar period of trial. I could tell by their
eyes.</p>

<p>The naked truth kept jogging our elbows, that this money from
which we were benefiting, that brought us SO much pleasure and
comfort, had been acquired in some dishonest way or even over the
corpse of some tragic episode.</p>

<p>He spent nearly all his time in the garden, dividing it into
little circles and oblongs and triangles of geranium-beds, and at
the bottom he had a rock garden, and fruit trees on the south wall.
He seemed to know a lot about it.</p>

<p>In the winter he stayed indoors, and became frailer and more
pathetic in his manner, and more dependent upon our society. It is
difficult to know how much he followed the effects of his
liberality. He developed a manner of asking one excitedly all about
one's affairs and then not listening to the reply. If he had
observed things closely he would have noted that in nearly every
case his patronage had had unfortunate results. Richard and
Christopher quarreled and dissolved their partnership. Albert's
business failed. Nancy's husband threw up his work and led a
frankly depraved life on the strength of his wife's settled income.
An adventurer named Ben Cotton married my sister Louie, obviously
because she had a little money. Laura quarreled with her husband,
the Baptist, and on the strength of her new independence left him,
and the poor man hanged himself a few months later.</p>

<p>To all these stories of misadventure and trouble Uncle Herbert
listened with a great show of profuse sympathy, but it was patent
that their real significance did not get through to him. He always
acted lavishly and impulsively. He set Albert up in business again.
He started both Christopher and Richard independently. He gave the
girls more money, and sent a preposterous wreath to the Baptist's
funeral. He did not seem to mind what he did for us, provided we
continued to laugh and jest round his generous board.</p>

<p>It is curious that this cataclysm in our lives affected Albert
more than any of us. Perhaps because he was in his way more
temperamental. He began to lose a grip on his business and to
drink.</p>

<p>He came to me one night in a very excited state. It appeared
that on the previous evening he had come home late and had been
drinking. One of the children annoyed him, a boy named Andrew, and
Albert had struck him on the head harder that he had meant to.
There had very nearly been a tragedy. His wife had been very upset
and threatened to leave him.</p>

<p>Albert cried in a maudlin fashion, and said he was very unhappy.
He wished Uncle Herbert had never turned up. Then he recalled the
night in the conservatory, when Uncle Herbert had talked about
Africa.</p>

<p>"I believe there was dirty work," said Albert. "I believe he did
some one down. He killed him out there on the karoo and robbed him
of his money."</p>

<p>"It ain't no business of ours." The phrase came to my mind, but
I did not use it. I was worried myself. I suggested that we should
have a family meeting and discuss the best thing to do, and Albert
agreed. But the meeting itself nearly ended in another tragedy.
Albert dominated it. He said we must all go to uncle and say to him
straight out:</p>

<p>"Look here, this is all very well, but you've got to tell us how
you made your money."</p>

<p>And Christopher replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say. And then he'll cut up rusty, and tell us all
to go to hell, and go away. And then where will we be?"</p>

<p>Louie and I agreed with Albert, but all the rest backed
Christopher, and the discussion became acrimonious and at times
dangerous. We broke up without coming to any decision, but with
Albert asserting vehemently that he was going the next day on his
own responsibility to settle the matter. He and Christopher nearly
came to blows.</p>

<p>We were never in a position to do more than speculate upon what
the result of that interview would have been, because it never took
place. In the morning we heard that uncle was dead. He had died the
previous evening while receiving a visitor, suddenly, of heart
failure, at the very time when we were arguing about him.</p>

<p>When we went round to the house, the servants told us that an
elderly gentleman had called about nine o'clock the night before.
He gave the name of Josh. He looked like a seaman of some sort.
Uncle Herbert had appeared dazed when he heard the name. He told
them in a faint voice to show the stranger in. They were alone less
than five minutes, when the stranger came out, and called them into
the hall.</p>

<p>"Something queer has happened," was all he said.</p>

<p>They found uncle lying in a huddled heap by the Chesterfield. A
doctor was sent for, but he was dead. During the excitement of the
shock Mr. Josh disappeared and had not been seen since. But later
in the afternoon he called and said that if there was to be any
inquest, he was willing to come and give evidence. He left an
address.</p>

<p>Of course there was a post-mortem, and I need hardly say that
all our interest was concentrated on this mysterious visitor. He
was a tall, elderly man with a gray pointed beard, a sallow
complexion, and a face on which the marks of a hard and bitter life
of struggle had left their traces.</p>

<p>The case was very simple and uneventful. The doctor said that
death was due to heart-failure, possibly caused by some sudden
shock. The heart in any case was in a bad state. The servants gave
evidence of the master's general disposition and of the visit of
the stranger. When Mr. Josh was called, he spoke in a loud, rather
raspish voice, like a man calling into the wind. He simply stated
that he was an old friend of Mr. Herbert Read's. He had known him
for nearly twenty-five years in South Africa. Happening to be in
London, he looked him up in a telephone directory, and paid him an
unexpected visit. They had spoken for a few moments, and Mr. Read
had appeared very pleased and excited at meeting him again. Then
suddenly he had put up his hands and fallen forward. That was all.
The coroner thanked him for his evidence, and a verdict of "Death
from natural causes" was brought in.</p>

<p>When the case was over, I approached Mr. Josh and asked him if
he would come back to the house with us. He nodded in a nonchalant
manner and followed me out. On the way back I made vain attempts to
draw him out, but he was as uncommunicative as Uncle Herbert
himself. He merely repeated what he had said at the inquest. We had
lunch, and a curiously constrained meal it was, all of us speaking
in little self-conscious whispers, with the exception of Albert,
who didn't speak at all, and Mr. Josh, who occasionally shouted
"Yes," or "No, thank you," in a loud voice.</p>

<p>At three o'clock Uncle Herbert's lawyer arrived, and we were all
called into the drawing-room for the reading of the will. I asked
Mr. Josh to wait for us, and he said he would. It need hardly be
said that we were all in a great state of trepidation. I really
believe that both Albert and I would have been relieved if it were
proved that uncle had died bankrupt. If we did indulge in this
unaccountable <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> we were quickly
doomed to disappointment. The lawyer, speaking in a dry,
unimpressive voice, announced that "as far as he could for the
moment determine," Herbert Read had left between sixty-five and
seventy thousand pounds. Thirty thousand of this was bequeathed to
various charitable institutions in South Africa, and the residue of
the estate was to be divided equally between his nephews and
nieces. I shall never forget the varied expressions on the faces of
my brothers and sisters when each one realized that he or she was
to inherit between four and five thousand pounds. We gasped and
said nothing, though I remember Christopher, when the reading was
finished, mumbling something to the lawyer. I think he asked him if
he'd like a drink. I know the lawyer merely glared at him, coughed,
and said nothing.</p>

<p>When he had taken his departure in a frigidly ceremonious
manner, we all seemed too numbed to become garrulous. It was a dull
day, and a fine rain was driving against the window-panes. We sat
about smoking and looking at one another and occasionally
whispering in strained voices. We might have been a collection of
people waiting their turn on the guillotine rather than a united
family who had just inherited a fortune. Mr. Josh had gone out for
a stroll during the reading of the will, and we were all strangely
anxious to see him. He appeared to be our last link that might bind
the chain of our earthly prospects to a reasonable stake.</p>

<p>He returned about five o'clock and strolled carelessly into the
room, nodding at us in a casual and indifferent manner as he seated
himself.</p>

<p>We gave him some tea, and he lighted a cheroot. And then each of
us in turn made our effort to draw him out. We began casually; then
we put leading questions and tried to follow them up quickly. But
Mr. Josh was apparently not to be drawn. He evidently disliked us
or was bored with us and made no attempt to illuminate the dark
shadows of our doubts. Perhaps he rather enjoyed the game. The room
began to get dark, and we slunk back into the gloom and gradually
subsided into silence. We sat there watching the stranger; the red
glow of his cheroot seemed the only vital thing.</p>

<p>It was Albert, as usual, who broke the spell. He suddenly got up
and walked to the window; then he turned and cried out:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about all you. But I know about myself. I'm
not going to touch a penny of this damned money."</p>

<p>I was sitting quite near our visitor, and in the half-light I
saw a strange look come into his eye. It was as though for the
first time something interested him. He started, and I said as
quickly as I could:</p>

<p>"Why not, Albert?"</p>

<p>"Because the money's not clean," he shouted into the room.</p>

<p>I don't know how it was that none of the others took this up.
But we all sat there looking at the stranger. It was as though we
waited breathlessly upon a verdict that he alone could give. He
looked round at us, and carefully flicking the end of his cheroot,
he obliged us with this epigram:</p>

<p>"No money is clean. It passes through too many hands."</p>

<p>We waited for more, but nothing came. Then Albert bore down on
him with a tempestuous movement.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "I don't know anything about you. But you
knew Uncle 'Erbert for twenty-five years. For God's sake, tell us
how he made his money."</p>

<p>The stranger looked at him, and blew smoke between his teeth;
then he said slowly:</p>

<p>"<i>Made</i> his money? Your uncle never made more than two or
three hundred a year in his life."</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew it!" exclaimed Albert.</p>

<p>Whether it was the result of my brother's forceful manner or
whether it was the atmosphere of suspense that urged him to it, I
do not know. But certain it is that at that point our visitor sank
back languidly in his chair and spoke:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I know."</p>

<p>We none of us moved, but we leaned forward and watched him as he
proceeded:</p>

<p>"In the spring of eighteen-forty-five," he began, "two young men
set out from England to seek their fortunes in South Africa. Their
names were Jules Lynneker and Karl Banstow. They were of the same
age, and were filled with the wildest hopes and dreams. They were,
moreover, devoted to each other, and their only difference was one
of temperament. Lynneker was essentially a dreamer and something of
a poet, with a great gift of imagination. Banstow was a
hard-headed, hard-working man of affairs. Now in this case, which
do you think would be the successful one? You would naturally put
your money on Banstow. And you would be wrong every time. For a
year or two they worked together, and then Banstow was offered an
overseer's job in a tin-mine. They continued to live together, but
their work separated them. Lynneker was employed on an ostrich
farm. The ostrich farm was a huge success, but the tin-mine
failed."</p>

<p>That seemed to make the beginning of their divergence. Whatever
Lynneker touched, succeeded; whatever Banstow touched, failed.</p>

<p>"Lynneker was a careless, easy-going person, but he had a native
genius. He could control men. Men loved him and followed him and
would do anything he told them. He was casual in his details. He
dreamed in millions and had the unique faculty of spotting the
right man for a job. There was something about the man, a curious
mesmeric fascination, a breadth&mdash;" Mr. Josh paused, and
knocked the ash of his cheroot into a tray. Then he continued:
"Banstow worked like a slave. He sat up half the night scheming and
plotting. He was infallible in his calculations and then&mdash;he
just missed. He didn't inspire any one. He misjudged men, and men
didn't believe in him. As the years went on, and Lynneker became
more and more successful, and Banstow made no progress, the thing
began to get on Banstow's nerves. He quarreled with his friend, and
they became rivals. The injustice of it all infuriated Banstow. He
worked, and Lynneker lazed and dreamed and yet won every time. They
went into the diamond-mining industry, and Lynneker began amassing
a great fortune in a careless, haphazard way. Again Banstow failed.
In ten years' time Lynneker was an immensely rich man, and Banstow
was a bankrupt clerk in a labor bureau. Then one day in a mood of
sullen resentment he hatched a diabolical plot against Lynneker. He
bribed some Kafirs, and tried to get Lynneker convicted of illicit
diamond-buying. By the merest fluke the plot was discovered, and it
was Banstow who was convicted. He was sentenced to seven years'
imprisonment. He served his term in full. In the meantime Lynneker
became a bigger man in Africa. He lived in Johannesburg and owned
great blocks of offices. But he always remained a dreamer.
Sometimes he would ride out at night into the karoo. They say he
dreamed of a united Africa. I don't know. He certainly wrote poetry
in the intervals of amassing money. Two weeks after Banstow was
released from prison Lynneker's body was found out in the karoo,
with a bullet through his heart. He had ridden out alone one night,
and as he hadn't returned, they sent out a search-party and found
him the next day. Banstow was suspected, but apparently he had
escaped. Nothing more was seen of him."</p>

<p>The stranger paused and then languidly lighted another cheroot.
The interval seemed so indefinite that at last Albert said:</p>

<p>"Where does Uncle Herbert come in?"</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Herbert was a cipher," replied our visitor. "He was
merely one of the people who came under the influence of Lynneker.
As a matter of fact, I believe he was one of the worst cases. He
worshiped Lynneker. Lynneker was the obsession of his life. He
acted as secretary for him for his vast charitable concerns. And
when Lynneker was found dead, he nearly went off his head. He
howled like a terrier who has lost his master." He glanced round at
us, and in the dim light I thought I detected a sneer of
contempt.</p>

<p>"Lynneker died a millionaire," he proceeded, "and among other
legacies he left your uncle certain blocks of mining shares which
were probably worth about forty or fifty thousand pounds. That's
how he made his money."</p>

<p>There was a gasp of relief round the room, and Albert wiped his
brow.</p>

<p>"Then the money was straight enough, after all," he said
huskily.</p>

<p>The chilling voice of the stranger came through the
darkness:</p>

<p>"As straight as any money can be."</p>

<p>Richard stood up and moved to the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Why the hell couldn't he tell us about this before, then? Why
was he so secret?"</p>

<p>"Herbert Read had no nerves. The thing broke him up. Banstow had
also been a friend of his at one time, and he was convinced that
Banstow had killed his master. He had periods of melancholia. The
doctors told him that unless he went away for a change and tried to
get it out of his head, he would be in an asylum in a few months.
And so I suppose he came over here. But his heart was still
affected, and when I gave him the news I did last week, the shock
finished him."</p>

<p>We all started.</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"That Banstow was innocent. I was able to show him a certificate
from the master of the <i>Birmingham</i>, proving that on the night
of the murder Banstow was a steerage-passenger on board his ship,
seventy-three miles east-northeast of the Azores. Lynneker was
probably shot by some vagrant thief. Certainly his watch and all
his money were missing."</p>

<p>We all peered at the man hidden in the recesses of the
easy-chair, and Albert said:</p>

<p>"How was it <i>you</i> had this information?"</p>

<p>The figure crossed its legs, and the voice replied
languidly:</p>

<p>"I was interested. I happen to be Karl Banstow!"</p>

<p>Albert groped past me on tiptoe, muttering:</p>

<p>"In God's name, where is the electric-light switch?"</p>

<p>It is a curious fact regarding these telepathic processes I have
hinted at in this chronicle of our uncle's return that from the day
when it was demonstrated that the money we had inherited was to all
intents and purposes clean, our own little affairs seemed to take
their cue from this consciousness. Certain it is that since that
time everything seems to have prospered for us. You should see
Albert's shops, particularly the one on the Broadway, where he is
still not too proud to serve himself. As for myself, as I am now in
a position to lead the indolent life of a scribe in this little
manor-house up in the Cotswolds, and as this position is due
entirely to the generosity of Uncle Herbert, it seems only right
and proper that I should begin my literary career by recounting the
story of his return.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Tuez! Tuez! (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, November 1918<br>
<i>The Century Magazine</i>, December 1918</p>

<p>They only who build on Ideas, build for
Eternity.&mdash;<i>Emerson</i></p>

<p>It is many years now since I knew you, Anna. We used to meet on
certain fine mornings in the gardens of the Tuileries. I don't
think we had ever been introduced, but we were great friends. I was
quite a man already; nearly sixteen, in fact. I don't know how old
you were, Anna, you were always such a baffling mixture of
motherliness and sheer infancy. I remember you now in your plaid
frock, with your pigtail tied with a large black bow, your chubby
face, and your shining eyes. Life was simply a tremendous business
to you. You used to arrive encumbered by two brothers, a bull-dog,
a nurse with a real baby, a toy pram with two unreal babies, one
plain, the other colored, a large kite, some colored picture-books,
and occasionally a father. Once in the gardens you would shake off
these encumbrances, or, if you did not entirely shake them off, you
dominated them. Your vitality was irresistible, your laughter
contagious, your immediate power over men and women, and even small
boys, a thing not to be denied. And there were so many important
things to be done in the gardens, and all to be done quickly,
tempestuously, and at the same time. Action, invention, romance
tumbled over one another in the terrific fulfilment of those
crowded hours.</p>

<p>I was your slave from the first, Anna. You told me frankly all
about yourself as we sat upon the grass under the chestnut-trees.
You told me all about your brothers and your nurse and your
bull-dog and your kite and your father and the two dolls, Iris and
Daphne (I am sure you remember Daphne, the colored one), and about
your home in Connecticut, embellishing it with vivid stories about
a mule and a colored gardener, and Aunt Alice and Uncle Ted and
popcorn and a dandy canoe you and your brothers had upon the lake
at home, where you played redskins and cow-boys. I was breathless
under the spell of these epic adventures. Sometimes I was allowed
to release the slack as you ran with the kite. In more favored
moments I was allowed to run with the kite myself. So great was
your power over me that I even humbled my manly pride by making a
patchwork quilt for Daphne, that the colored darling should sleep
peacefully in the shade while we sought more stirring adventures in
the remote parts of the gardens.</p>

<p>It was in connection with this that the great and tragic episode
occurred. I am writing this after all these years in the hope that
you may remember it. In one corner of the gardens a group of small
and rather dirty boys used to congregate. One of their favorite
amusements was to bring an old egg-box stuffed with straw, which
served as a cage wherein were kept some half-dozen white mice. The
boys would set this on the ground and then release the mice and
play with them. They would sometimes let the whole lot go for a
considerable distance, and then would follow a round-up. I
recollect how intensely interested you were in the white mice, but
you always looked upon the "round-up" with some misgiving. The boys
would shriek, and chivvy the mice until the wretched things were in
a perfect state of panic. One day you felt it incumbent upon you to
address them on the subject, and you told them they ought not to do
it, and that it was very cruel to frighten dumb creatures. The boys
were quite surprised and cowed by your outburst for the moment; but
I fear that that devilish streak of cruelty and perversity which
lurks in the breast of nearly every small boy was only whipped to a
finer point of reaction by your tirade, for on the following day I
have the idea that they were lying in wait for us. In any case,
when we approached there was such a yelling and shouting and
rushing hither and thither that all the <i>Apaches</i> from the
Paris prisons might have been let loose. I observed your face light
up with a sudden passion, and you rushed forward into the group,
calling out:</p>

<p>"<i>Arrtez!</i>"</p>

<p>You singled out the biggest boy, who was leaping backward and
forward over a mouse, and clutched the tail of his coat. And then
the tragedy happened. Coming down before he intended to, he brought
his heel right down on to the hind quarters of the mouse. It was
not a moment for sweet reasonableness. You, with tears of passion
in your eyes, screamed:</p>

<p>"You little devil!"</p>

<p>You managed to seize a handful of his face, and push him over
backward. And the boy jumped up and kicked your shins. In truly
heroic fashion I knocked the boy down again and held him there (I
suppose I must remind you that I was much bigger than he was). And
then the other boys collected, and the pandemonium became
indescribable. One of them pulled your hair, but you soon dealt
satisfactorily with him, and they all talked and gesticulated at
once. Fortunately, the majority of them were more immediately
concerned with rounding up the other mice, which by this time had
got a long way off. And your attention was concentrated on the
wounded mouse. You looked at it with horror. It was obviously past
recall. Both its back legs were broken and its body crushed. It was
dying. You wrung your hands.</p>

<p>"Kill it!" you said to me, peremptorily.</p>

<p>And then came to me one of those weak moments which I suppose we
are all prone to, and which we ever afterward regret. I blinked at
the mouse hopelessly, but I simply couldn't bring myself to kill
it. You looked at the other boys and stamped your feet.</p>

<p>"<i>Tuez</i><i>! tuez!</i>" you exclaimed.</p>

<p>But the big boy, whom by this time I had let go, merely broke
out into a torrent of incomprehensible argot, and the others were
still busy catching the other mice. I observed you glance
desperately around. Suddenly you picked up a piece of board that
had come off the egg-box. Your face was white and set. Your
movements were deliberate and tense. You knelt on the grass above
the mouse, and the idea occurred to me, ridiculously perhaps, that
at that moment you looked like Joan of Arc kneeling at prayer, her
head bent over her sword. And then you killed the mouse. You killed
it <i>thoroughly</i>.</p>

<p>You arose without a word, and your face was still pale and set,
and you strode away across the grass. I followed you, and the boys
followed me, talking volubly. At length, I remember, I gave them a
franc. I salved my conscience with the reflection that a white
mouse must have a monetary value, and that we might have been
indirectly responsible for its loss. If we had not interfered it
would probably have had a longer and more harassed existence. In
any case, the boys left us apparently satisfied.</p>

<p>When we were out of sight of them, you suddenly sat down on the
grass and cried. And you cried and cried and cried. And, like the
booby I was, all I could say was:</p>

<p>"Anna, don't cry! Anna! Anna!"</p>

<p>After a time you sat up and wiped your eyes.</p>

<p>"It's all right," you said. Then you got up, and we walked on. I
felt curiously self-conscious and ashamed. I was aware of not
having played so glorious a part in the morning's proceedings as I
should have liked; moreover, I felt that you had gone beyond me.
You had proved yourself a more competent, a more advanced being. I
had disappointed you, and you might never again give me your
complete confidence.</p>

<p>However, at the exit to the gardens, where we met nurse, you
were quite yourself again. Do you remember all this, Anna? You told
nurse that you had had "a dandy time." And when we parted you gave
me the old smile, and with a malicious twinkle you added, "Mornin',
Mr. Hayseed!"</p>

<p>I know all about that, Anna. I am slow-going and old-fashioned.
When I find the world tumbling to pieces I am paralyzed by it, and
I yearn for you with your impulse and your genius of youth. The
years have come and gone since I saw you. I even doubt whether you
would remember me, but I am sure you would remember the incident of
the white mice. In these days the gardens of the Tuileries
themselves seem shut to me forever, and the world is peopled with
querulous old men. Old dynasties tremble and crumble up. Political
intrigues reap the fruit of their own sowing. Everything becomes
more involved and more difficult. Secret treaties are forged by the
few, and quite reasonably repudiated by the many. The old make the
laws, and the young pay the price. And how splendidly, how loyally,
they do it! And it is always that&mdash;the old in their secret
chambers, scheming, controlling, and shaking their heads, and the
young dying unquestioningly out in the open field, believing. For
the young always believe, and the old always doubt.</p>

<p>And if in these days, Anna, I am driven to think of you, it is
for a very definite reason. It concerns you and it concerns your
country. The Old World is rocking in a death-grip. Everything is
thrown into the crucible of hate. The horror of these days is borne
only because there lurks in the heart of man a subconscious belief
that the horror is to prove a solution; that all the troubles of
old days, that all differences and antagonisms, are to vanish. The
sword of Damocles will be indeed a myth. If I think of you so
intently it is because I am perplexed and worried, and I long for
the sound of a young voice again. Let me tell you, for I know that
you will understand. I have listened to them all these sages of the
Eastern World. And they are very wise and knowing, very cunning and
very circumspect; but when it comes to the great thing, the thing
which touches all our hearts, they shake their heads.</p>

<p>"No," they say lugubriously. "There always have been wars and
there always will be wars."</p>

<p>And when I argue with them, they are so recondite, so full of
worldly wisdom. And they quote this act and that act and multiply
historical precedents. They speak ponderously of "our national
responsibilities," "our ancient rights and privileges"; they crush
me with their weight of logic. From across the water I hear the
thunder of the guns and the reiteration of the ominous phrases,
"The German god," "The German sword." "The German peace." And
nearer at home I am further depressed by the arguments of our
sages.</p>

<p>"What?" they say, "a league of the nations! An idle term! How
could such a thing be worked? Should every nation elect an equal
number of delegates? Is the British Empire and all that it entails,
embodying a population of four hundred million souls, to be on a
par with, let us say, the sovereign state of Bogota, which has a
million souls and mostly poets!"</p>

<p>And the politicians' contempt for poets is driven home by that
contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p>"There would be no way," they say, "of regulating or controlling
such a league. Why, some quite backward states might outvote the
British, the French, and the United States! There always have been
wars and there always will be wars." I remember it was in such a
state of bewilderment as this, and it was in another garden not
very far from where I live, that on an evening just as the sun was
going down I thought of you again. I had read for the first time
some words by a man who will one day be very dear to all the world.
He is the President of your country. I was distressed and troubled.
The problems and anxieties of national life seemed more and more
involved and insoluble, the men in power more rigid and inflexible;
and suddenly, as I read the words of President Wilson, I realized
that here at last was a man who stood apart from his fellows.
Amidst the bitter recrimination of national antagonisms, clear-cut
through the chopped logic of the politician, he at least seemed to
see things clearly with the eyes of a child. While the others were
shouting of "The German god" or of "their national aspirations," he
suddenly appeared in the due order of things and spoke quite simply
of men and ideas. If he spoke of his country at all, it was only as
a medium for the advancement of men, for the freedom of their
ideas, for the liberty of their thought. One felt at once that one
was in the presence of something big and fundamental, without
malice, without ulterior motive, without political intrigue or
imperial ambition. And when I read his words, I thought of you, and
I thought of America as I shall always think of her, as of a child
with shining eyes, disturbed in the pursuit of splendid dreams,
quick to grasp realities, quick to act, and quick to forgive. And
when the terrible business of killing the mouse has got to be done,
it will be done quickly, relentlessly, thoroughly, and though one
may weep for the sheer horror of it, the day will come when the
tears will be wiped away, and one may smile again in the
recognition of the fact that there was no alternative.</p>

<p>And the Old World is waiting for you, for it will not believe,
and it knows that you will believe, for you alone have the
masterful genius of youth, unaware of perils and difficulties, but
with eyes set upon the clear horizon you have set out to reach. And
in these days, amidst the maelstrom of conflicting opinion of these
wise men of the Eastern World, all who love humanity, all who
believe in its ultimate destiny toward a better order of society,
are driven to turn their eyes more and more to the west. For the
turn of the Western World has come, a world where everything is
more fluid and free, where everything is possible and hopeful; in
short, the world of youth. It was a Western philosopher, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, who said:</p>

<p class="letter">Society is an illusion to the young citizen. It
lies before him in rigid repose, with certain names, men, and
institutions rooted like oak-trees in the centre, round which all
arrange themselves the best they can. But the old statesman knows
that Society is fluid; there are no such roots and centres; but any
particle may suddenly become the centre of the movement, and compel
the system to gyrate round it.</p>

<p>Emerson may say "the old statesman," but he is essentially the
old statesman of the Western World; that is to say, he speaks with
the authority of youth. And in these days how terribly we want to
believe this, that "some particle may become the center of the
movement," that some new hope, some free and novel expression of
human ideas, may compel "the whole system to gyrate round it." And
that is why we turn with breathless expectancy to the Western
World, for it is from there that this new star should rise, guiding
the stumbling feet of men to the manger where a new birth will
prove to them the salvation of their wavering beliefs. Some little
thing may fire this sudden spark; the words of a President, the
mood of a congress, an article in a newspaper, some grim material
necessity producing a climax of horror, the rise of a
world-preacher, the tears of a woman. Whatever it is, it will come,
this little point round which the ultimate solutions will revolve.
And there is no one I would rather have as a leader in these days
than this President of yours; for he reminds me of you, Anna, when
you ran with flashing eyes among the boys, and when you knelt there
looking like Joan of Arc, and calling out:</p>

<p>"<i>Tuez! tuez!</i>"</p>

<p>And forever after one will weep at the terror of that memory;
but the heart is uplifted, and the soul of man made stronger and
freer.</p>

<p>Many who play an important part in my life come and go, and I
see them no more. And you are one of them, Anna. And in these days
I like to think of you. I like to think of you married and
surrounded by many fine and "real" children. Perhaps you have sons
in France and Flanders, and in that case my heart goes out to you.
I know what a mother you will be, and I know that, whatever
happens, you will be fine and splendid, strong and courageous, "a
mother of men," doing your best, believing in the best, the
equipoise of your faith untouched by trouble or anxiety. And on the
day when the sun once more looks down serenely on those fair fields
now stricken with the horrors of war, I can see those eyes of yours
shining with a thankfulness and a wistful pity almost too great to
bear, and I can almost hear that mellow voice as you look up at me
maliciously, saying "Mornin', Mr. Hayseed!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Mrs. Huggins's Hun (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, Jan 1919<br>
<i>The Strand Magazine</i>, February, 1919</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins's manifestation of antipathy to her prospective
son-in-law was a thing to be seen to be believed. She bridled at
the sight of him. She lashed him with her tongue on every
conceivable occasion. She snubbed, derided, buffeted him. She could
find no virtue in his appearance, manners, or character. She hated
him with consuming wrath, and did not hesitate to flaunt her
animadversion in his face or in the face of her friends or of her
daughter Maggie. Maggie was Mrs. Muggins's only child, and Mrs.
Huggins was a widow running a boarding-house in Camden Town. Maggie
was her ewe-lamb, the light of her existence, whose simple,
unsophisticated character had been suddenly, within two months,
entirely demoralized by the advent of this meteoric youth. Quentin
Livermore had appeared from the blue, when Mrs. Huggins was very
distracted at her unlet rooms, and had applied for her first floor,
for which he offered a good price. He was a weak-faced, flashy,
old-young man, anything between thirty and forty. He dressed
gorgeously, lived sumptuously, and was employed in some government
department. He was in the house less than twenty-four hours when he
began to make love to Maggie, and it was the change in Maggie which
particularly annoyed Mrs. Huggins. Maggie was a stenographer in a
local store, earning good money, and a simple, natural girl; but
when Mr. Livermore appeared on the scene, she began to speak with
an affected lisp, to wear fal-lals and gew-gaws, and to do her hair
in strange bangs and buns. In a few days they were going out for
strolls together after supper. In a fortnight he was taking her to
theaters and cinemas. In six weeks they were to all intents and
purposes engaged. At least, they said they were engaged. Mrs.
Huggins said they were not. In fact, she told her friend Mrs.
O'Neil, in-the private bar of the Staff of Life, that she would
"see that slobberin' shark damned" before he should go off with her
Mag.</p>

<p>But on the morning when this story begins Mrs. Huggins was in a
very perturbed state. It was a pleasant June morning, and she had
finished her housework. She sat down to enjoy a well-merited glass
of stout and to review the situation. Maggie had gone away for a
few days' holiday, to stay with some cousins in Essex, and the
evening before she had left there had been a terrible rumpus.
Maggie had come home with her hair <i>bobbed</i>, looking like some
wretched office-boy. After Mrs. Huggins had vented her opinion upon
this contemptible metamorphosis and had cried a little, she went
out, and, returning late in the evening, found her Maggie lolling
on a couch in Mr. Livermore's room, smoking cigarettes and drinking
port wine! It was a climax in every sense, and to add to her
misfortune the Bean family, who occupied the third and a part of
the fourth floor, suddenly left to go and live at Mendon, near the
aeroplane works, where they were nearly all employed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins had now no lodgers except the insufferable Mr.
Livermore. It would be impossible to keep up her refined
establishment on the twenty-five shillings a week that Livermore
paid her without breaking into her hard-earned savings. But this
fact did not disturb Mrs. Huggins so much as the difficulty of
furthering a more ambitious project, which was nothing less than to
get rid of Mr. Livermore while Maggie was away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins blew the froth off the stout, took a long draft,
wiped her mouth on her apron, and then continued to ponder upon the
problem. No light came to her, and she was about to repeat the
operation when she was disturbed by the clatter of a four-wheeled
cab driving up to the front door. She looked up through the kitchen
window and beheld a strange sight. The cab was laden with a most
peculiar collection of trunks and boxes, and, standing by the front
doorstep, was a fat man holding a cage with a canary in one hand
and a violin-case in the other.</p>

<p>"Ah, a new lodger at last!" thought Mrs. Huggins, and she
slipped off her apron and hurried up-stairs. When she opened the
front door, she noticed that the fat man had thick spectacles, a
Homburg hat much too small for his head, and a tuft of yellow beard
between two of his innumerable chins. He put down the canary and
removed his hat.</p>

<p>"Have I the honor to speak to the honored Mrs. Huggins?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huggins is my name," answered that lady.</p>

<p>"Ah, so? May I a word with you?" He walked deliberately into the
hall and once more set down the canary and the violin. He then
produced a sheaf of papers.</p>

<p>"I have been recommended. May I have the pleasure of your
hospitality for some time?"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> some rooms to let," replied Mrs. Huggins,
evasively.</p>

<p>He bowed, and blew his nose.</p>

<p>"I must eggsplain in ze first place, goot lady, I am a
Sherman."</p>

<p>There was a perceptible pause while the two eyed each other;
then Mrs. Huggins said explosively:</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't take no dirty 'Uns in my 'ouse."</p>

<p>It might perhaps be mentioned at this point that the speech of
Mrs. Huggins was always characterized by directness and force. The
Hun bowed once more and replied:</p>

<p>"The matter is already at your disposition, good lady. I state
my case. If you gan gonsider it, I gan assure you that all my
papers are in order. The London poliss officers know me. I report
to zem. I have my passports, my permits. Everything in order. I pay
you vell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins blinked at the German and blinked at the cab. The
cab looked somewhat imposing, with its large trunks, and the
German's face was eminently homely and kind. Her eye wandered from
it to the canary, and then along the wall to the hall stand, and
came to a stop at Livermore's felt hat. She equivocated.</p>

<p>"What sort of rooms do you want?" she said.</p>

<p>At this compromise of tone the Hun assumed the arbitrariness of
his race. He put his things down on the hall chairs and became
voluble and convincing. He was a watch- and clock-maker. His
business in Hackney had been destroyed by fire. He had been offered
an excellent position at a colleague's in Camden Town, the said
colleague being sick and in urgent need of help. He was simple in
his requirements; a bed, a breakfast, occasionally a supper. His
name was Schmidt, Karl Schmidt. He was willing to pay three pounds
a week for the rooms, payment in advance. He had endless
"regommendations." Mrs. Huggins found herself following him up and
down stairs, helping him in with trunks, and listening
abstractedly. In a vague way she took to the Hun, and her mind was
active with a scheme to use him for her own ends. All the trunks
were installed in the third-floor rooms, and she observed him take
out an old string purse and say to the cabman:</p>

<p>"Now have we all the paggages installed. So."</p>

<p>He paid the cabman, came into the hall, and shut the door. He
walked ponderously up-stairs, humming to himself. Mrs. Huggins
heard him busy with bunches of keys, opening and shutting trunks
and putting things away in drawers. The whole thing had happened so
suddenly that Mrs. Huggins still could not decide her course of
action. She went down-stairs and put some potatoes on to boil.
After a time she heard the Hun coming heavily down to the hall
again. She went up to meet him. He waved three one-pound
treasury-notes in the air and placed them on the hall-table.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huggins," he said, "please to be goot enough to allow me
to present you with zese. I shall be very gomfortable here. It is
all satisfactory. I go now to my colleague in pizness. Then I go to
eggsplain to the poliss. It is all in order. Yes. I shall not be
returnable since zis evening, perhaps eight o'gloch, perhaps nine
o'gloch. In any vay, I gom back before ten o'gloch. Oh, yes, before
ten o'gloch." He laughed boisterously, bowed, and went out. Mrs.
Huggins stared at the door, then went to the window and watched him
cross the street.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm demned!" she muttered to herself, and fingered the
three crisp treasury-notes in her hand. She went up to his room and
touched all his trunks and small effects. Most of his things were
locked up. She said, "Cheep! cheep!" to the canary three times, and
then went down-stairs and had her dinner.</p>

<p>And that afternoon Mrs. Huggins became very busy. In apron, and
with bare arms and a broom, she worked as she had not worked for
months. The details may be spared, but the principal effect must be
observed that by six-thirty that evening all Herr Fritz's luggage
and effects had been installed in the <i>first-floor</i> room, and
all Mr. Quentin Livermore's property had been piled up in a heap in
the hall!</p>

<p>We shall also take the liberty of passing over the details of
the interview which took place between Mrs. Huggins and Mr.
Livermore when he came in at seven o'clock that evening on his way
to change his clothes and go down West to dine. It need only be
said that the accumulated antipathy of their two months'
intercourse reached a climax. There may have been faults on both
sides, but Mrs. Huggins was in one of her most masterful moods, and
she was, moreover, armed with a brush. Mr. Livermore had only a
cane and his superciliousness. He was, indeed, rather frightened,
and his sneering comments on her personal appearance had little
sting. His ultimate decision to leave at once and go over to Mrs.
Hayward's, so that he would still be where Maggie would find him,
and where, in any case, it was tolerably clean, and the landlady
knew how to cook, was the only shaft which told at all, for Mrs.
Hayward and Mrs. Huggins were notorious rivals. In the end a cab
was secured, and by eight o'clock the triumphant Mrs. Huggins had
slammed the door on her hated lodger, with a final threat that "if
she saw 'im going about with 'er gal she'd bang 'im over the chops
with a broom."</p>

<p>So excited and exhilarated was Mrs. Huggins by her victory that
when he had gone, she felt it incumbent upon her to dash down to
the Staff of Life for ten minutes to get a glass of beer and to
unburden herself to Mrs. O'Neil. Not finding her friend there, she
had two glasses of beer and hurried back. On arriving at the corner
of her street she had another surprise. A taxi was standing outside
her door, and a short gentleman with a dark mustache and pointed
beard was banging on her door and looking up at the windows.</p>

<p>"Gawd's truth! What is it now?" muttered Mrs. Huggins, hurrying
up.</p>

<p>On approaching the stranger, he turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled very charmingly and made an elaborate
bow.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "so at last I have the pleasure of
addressing the charming Madame Huggins! Madame, my compliments. May
I address you on a professional mattare?"</p>

<p>He slipped a visiting-card into her hand on which was printed,
"M. Jules de la Roche, 29B rue Dormi, Paris."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins stared at the card and opened her front door.</p>

<p>"O my Gawd!" was all that occurred to her to remark. The
Frenchman&mdash;for so he apparently was&mdash;bowed again, and
followed her into the hall.</p>

<p>"You must pardon my precipitate manners," he said. "I am very
pressed. I am in London on business connected with the French Red
Cross. I have a peculiar dislike to hotels, and a lady I met in the
train was kind enough to refer me to your charming <i>pension</i>.
I shall owe you a thousand thanks if you will be kind enough to
allow me to enjoy your hospitality if only for a few days, or
perhaps weeks. Whatever you can do&mdash;" He waved his arms and
looked quickly, almost beseechingly, round the little hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins wiped her mouth on her apron, and stared at the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a rum go!" she remarked I at last. "I've got a
German on the first floor, a nice, quiet feller. And now you 're a
Frenchy! Now, look here; if I take you in, I'm not goin' to 'ave
any fightin' goin' on. D' you understand that?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman gave her one of his quick glances and laughed.</p>

<p>"My dear madame," he exclaimed, "what ees eet to me? I am of
entirely a gentle disposition, and if your friend is of gentle
disposition, vy should we quarrel?"</p>

<p>"'E's no <i>friend</i> of mine," interjected Mrs. Huggins. "'E's
a 'Un, but 'e's a lodger. I don't make friends of my lodgers, but I
treats 'em fair. If I do the fair and square thing by <i>them</i>,
I expect 'em to do the fair and square by <i>me</i>; but I won't
'ave the place turned into a bear-garden by a lot of
foreigners."</p>

<p>M. de la Roche threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"An admirable sentiment, <i>ch&egrave;re madame</i>. Then it is
settled. I take my effects immediately to&mdash;vich floor did you
mention?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mention no floor," replied Mrs. Huggins, "but if you
like to leave it at that, I dessay I can fix you up on the third,
and the terms will be three pounds a week."</p>

<p>The face of Mrs. Huggins was perfectly straight when she
demanded this extortionate sum, neither did it show any evidence of
surprise when the Frenchman quite avidly agreed, and immediately
paid her three pounds down in advance. He seemed a gay and
companionable gentleman. He had only one valise, which he ran
up-stairs with. He paid the cabman a sum which seemed to leave that
gentleman so speechless he could not even express his thanks. He
chatted to Mrs. Huggins merrily about the weather, the war, the
food problems, the difficulties of running a lodging-house. He was
intensely sympathetic about various minor ailments of which Mrs.
Huggins was a victim. He listened attentively to the history of
various former lodgers, but beyond eliciting the fact that the
German occupied the first floor, he showed no particular interest
in his fellow-lodger. He explained that he had considerable
correspondence to attend to that evening, so he did not purpose to
go out; but if Mrs. Huggins could scramble him a couple of eggs on
toast and make him a cup of tea, he would be eternally
grateful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins was a good cook. It was a matter she took a keen
personal delight in. She would neglect her housework in order to
produce some savory trifle for a pet lodger. On this occasion she
surprised M. de la Roche by serving him with a large ham omelet and
an apple tart.</p>

<p>"After yer long journey, you'll want a bite of somethin'," she
explained.</p>

<p>Any apprehensions she entertained that her house was to be
turned into a beer-garden by a lot of quarrelsome foreigners were
early dissipated. At half-past nine that evening Herr Schmidt came
in and went up to his room. Ten minutes later M. Jules de la Roche,
coming down-stairs, beheld the canary in its cage on a chair
outside Herr Fritz's door.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, le petit bossu</i>!" he remarked.</p>

<p>The door was ajar, and Herr Fritz stepped out.</p>

<p>"<i>Bonsoir, monsieur</i>," he said in his deep-chested voice.
"Are you interested in canaries?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman bowed a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"My sympathies always go out to the caged, monsieur," he
replied. "But what a pretty fellow! Am I right in suggesting that
he is of the Belgian species?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the German. "Although they vas somet'ing
similiar, zis is ze Scottish."</p>

<p>"Pardon," replied the Frenchman. "I ought to have known. I have
lived at Terceira, in the Azores, where one hears canaries singing
in the open all day. Eet ees entrancing."</p>

<p>"Gom inzide," said Herr Schmidt and sighed, "and let us talk. I
am lonely."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins overheard this conversation from the hall beneath,
and she smiled contentedly. It was a triumph, a bolt from the blue.
She had ousted the wretched Livermore, and like manna from heaven
these two gentle, simple foreigners, who were willing to pay
through the neck, had dropped right into her lap. Her conscience
mildly smote her that she had demanded so much from Herr Schmidt,
but a rapid mental calculation had decided that he must pay at
least double as a penalty for being a Hun, but at the same time it
wouldn't be fair to him to take another lodger for less. She had
been, in any case, prepared to bargain, and to reduce considerably
her terms, and had been quite nonplussed at not being called upon
to do so. So far, so good; but the difficulty of detaching the
wretched Livermore from her Maggie still remained to be
accomplished, for Maggie was to return the day after to-morrow, and
Livermore would be sure to be always hanging about the street.</p>

<p>In the meantime the conversation between the two foreigners
up-stairs never flagged. They became extremely friendly. The violin
case laid the foundation for an intimate chat on technic,
personality. Bach, nationality. From these easily devolved
discussions on politics, religion, and hence, inevitably, "this
regrettable war." Each man was patently sensitive of the other's
feelings. They talked of everything in the abstract, and avoided as
far as possible the personal equation. They found each other
extremely interesting, but there arrived a point when each was
aware that the other was fencing. Herr Schmidt produced a bottle of
whisky and a syphon of soda, but he could not persuade M. de la
Roche to partake of more than one glass. It was nearly twelve
o'clock when the Frenchman suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Herr Schmidt, I have had a most entrancing
evening. I suggest that you dine vif me to-morrow evening. I have
made de happy discovery dat our good Mrs. Huggins is a most
excellent chef. Why should ve two lonely bachelors not share our
meal?"</p>

<p>"I gannot gonzidder anyt'ing more delightful," replied Herr
Schmidt. "Only I insist that you dine vif me in my room. I glaim
preeminence as ze first-floor lodger." He laughed boisterously, and
after further mildly disputing the matter, it was arranged
accordingly.</p>

<p>The dinner which Herr Schmidt prevailed upon Mrs. Huggins to
supply the following evening in honor of his friend M. de la Roche
was of such a nature that not only had the like never been served
in Mrs. Huggins's household, but probably never before in the whole
environment of Camden Town. In the first place, there were oysters
and grape-fruit, soup, a baked bream, a roast fowl and several
vegetables; a lemon-curd tart, Welsh rarebit, and grapes, the whole
mellowed with the exhilarating complement of Italian vermuth,
sparkling Moselle, and a very old brandy, to say nothing of coffee,
cigars, and the dazzling conversation of the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>The preparation of these alluring delicacies occupied Mrs.
Huggins nearly the whole of the day&mdash;a day which was marred
only by a regrettable scuffle in the early morning. It happened at
about half-past eight. Mrs. Huggins was at work in the kitchen when
she heard a commotion going on up in the hall. Hurrying up-stairs,
she found M. de la Roche arguing with Quentin Livermore. The
Frenchman turned to her.</p>

<p>"Who is dis man, madam? I know him not. He comes into the house
unbidden."</p>

<p>And Livermore cut in:</p>

<p>"I've come to collect my letters. You 're not going to keep my
letters from me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins seized her broom and cried out:</p>

<p>"You get out, you dirty thief and blackmailer!"</p>

<p>She experienced no difficulty in routing Mr. Livermore and
sending him flying up the street, and after his departure she told
the whole story to M. de la Roche, who kept on repeating:</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> how shocking! <i>Quel perfide</i>! What a
villain!" He was almost in tears.</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed quietly. Both the gentlemen went out
soon after breakfast. Herr Schmidt did not return till seven-thirty
in the evening, in time for the dinner. M. de la Roche came in at
five o'clock, and persuaded Mrs. Huggins to go to the nearest
haberdasher's and obtain two clean shirts for him, as, owing to his
imperfect knowledge of the English tongue, he was unable to obtain
the sort he required. She returned in half an hour, and M. de la
Roche thanked her profusely. At eight o'clock precisely he
presented himself in Herr Schmidt's room, wearing an ill-fitting
evening dress peculiar to Frenchmen. Herr Schmidt was also in
evening dress of an ill-fitting kind peculiar to Germans. They
bowed, and shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>"I am indeed fortunate," remarked Herr Schmidt, "in a city so
desolate as London, and in a quarter so <i>traurig</i> as zis, to
find zo sympathetic and charming a fellow-lodger."</p>

<p>"<i>Tout au contraire</i>," replied the Frenchman. "The good
fortune is exclusively to me. Ah, this London! was there ever a
city so <i>abaiss&eacute;</i>, so <i>triste</i>?"</p>

<p>"Never, never," retorted Herr Schmidt.</p>

<p>"Now, let me offer you a glass of goot vermuth, and then ve vill
these excellent oysters circumscribe while ze goot Frau Huggins
prepares ze soup."</p>

<p>The two men sat down, and toasted each other solemnly.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you haf gonsiderably traveled, frient?" remarked Herr
Schmidt as he disposed of his second dozen oysters.</p>

<p>"I would not venture to address myself as a traveler," replied
M. de la Roche. "True, I have lived in the Azores, and I am at home
in Egypt, Morocco, Spain, France, and Italy. But a traveler,
<i>parbleu!</i> it means something more than that. And you, Herr
Schmidt, have you adventured far?"</p>

<p>"No; ze fatherland&mdash;pardon me speaking of ze fatherland in
zese delicate times&mdash;ze fatherland has occupied me for most a
long vile, and zen zis dear Engeland, vich I love almost as much
as, it occupies me too already. For ze rest, a little Dutchman, a
little Svede, a little of the sea; I am a citizen of ze vide, vide
vorld, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ees eet not curious," remarked M. de la Roche as Mrs. Huggins
brought in the soup; "eet appears mostly that you visit countries I
have not visit, and I visit countries you not visit. Strange!"</p>

<p>"So it happens most nearly alvays. Now I vish much to go to
America. And you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, America! Yes, most interesting."</p>

<p>"You do not go to America?"</p>

<p>The German looked at the Frenchman with his mild eyes, and M. de
la Roche shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no; I don't like." he rejoined. "It does not call to me.
Interesting, yes, <i>tr&egrave; int&eacute;ressant</i>; but to me
too <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>. Life to me must be romance. Romance
first, romance second, romance all de time."</p>

<p>"Efen in Camden Town?" queried Herr Schmidt, slicing the bream
down the center. Then he laughed. "Well, after all, vy not? It is
to be found, your romance, even in material zings. I lofe material
zings, and I find zem romantic. It is a figure of ze mind. Allow me
to offer you zome of zis sparkling vine, if it does not to trink a
German vine you disgust."</p>

<p>"I am a Cat'olic," replied M. de la Roche, "bot' in my religion
and in appreciation of goot t'ings. To your goot healt', Herr
Schmidt, and happy days ven peace shall come."</p>

<p>"Happy days!" solemnly replied the German. "May the vorld vonce
more to reason gom!"</p>

<p>The wine flowed freely. The fowl was done to a nicety. The
conversation never flagged. Mrs. Huggins enjoyed the dinner almost
as much as her two lodgers. They were the softest things she had
ever encountered in her professional career. Visions of a bounteous
time despite the war floated before her mind's eye. She even
decided that she would treat them fairly and squarely. She would
not take advantage of their innocence; but there would be a steady
accumulation of "things left over," which were her natural
perquisites. She was indeed surveying the remnants of the very
solid fowl, as it reclined on a dish in the hall, and was mentally
performing the skilful operation of "trimming it up" without
altering the general effect of the mass, when she heard Herr
Schmidt's door open and shut, and he came down the stairs quietly.
In the hall he produced a large timepiece from his
waistcoat-pocket, and resting one hand commandingly on her
shoulder, he said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huggins, in seven minutes precisely two shentlemens vill
gall to visit me. Ask no questions. Show them straight up to my
room, open ze door, and say, 'Mr. Skinner and Mr. Trout.' Then
close ze door and retire till I gall you vonce more again."</p>

<p>He gave her no opportunity to reply to these instructions, but
returned to his room. As the door opened she heard him crying
out:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, dear Monsieur de la Roche. You must try von of my
Contadinos. I gan really regommend them. I brought zem myself from
Amsterdam the year pefore zis distressful var."</p>

<p>"A thousand t'anks, my dear Herr Schmidt. It is a luxury I
seldom allow myself dese days."</p>

<p>The gentle flow of these suave pleasantries reached their
appointed crisis. Each man lay back in an easy-chair, with the
divine Contadino between his teeth. On the table stood the little
glasses filled with the old brandy.</p>

<p>"Life may be very pleasant and grassifying in the midst of
vickedness and sin," murmured Herr Schmidt.</p>

<p>"<i>C'est tr&eacute;s vrai</i>," replied M. de la Roche. "It
does not do even to t'ink of dese t'ings all de time."</p>

<p>"Friendship is vat I value beyond all else, M. de la Roche, to
your goot healt'!"</p>

<p>As each man raised the little glass, the door opened, and Mrs.
Huggins announced:</p>

<p>"Mr. Trinner and Mr. Snout."</p>

<p>Two stolid-looking gentlemen entered, and Mrs. Huggins
retired.</p>

<p>Herr Schmidt removed the cigar from his mouth and said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," and then without changing his
position, and in a voice without any trace of German accent, he
addressed M. de la Roche as follows:</p>

<p>"Ephraim Hyems, I have the honor to arrest you on an
extraordinary warrant issued by the United States Government for
embezzlement in connection with the Pennsylvania Small Arms Trust,
and moreover with an attempt to convey certain information to an
enemy agent in this country, under Article 36 of the Defense of the
Realm Act."</p>

<p>The Frenchman leaned forward, and clutching the arms of the
chair, he gave vent to a very un-Frenchified expression. He
said:</p>

<p>"Gee-whiz!"</p>

<p>"It hardly required that native vernacular to convince me that
you were not a Frenchman. As a matter of fact, I have lived for
many years in Paris, and if I may say so without giving offense,
Monsieur de la Roche, your French never convinced me at all."</p>

<p>The pseudo-Frenchman sat here apparently dazed. At length he
said:</p>

<p>"Professionally speaking, Herr Schmidt, it is regrettable that
our roles were not reversed. It is true that I know little French,
but I happen to have spent some years in Germany. I studied
medicine at Leipsic. Your German is appalling. It would not deceive
a London policeman. In this present case I am fully prepared to
throw up my arms and to cry 'Kamerad!' only I would ask you, as a
last request, whether you or your assistants would kindly extract
my pocket-book from my breast-pocket, and examine my card and any
other papers you or they may find. And, finally, whether you will
allow me to finish this glass of very excellent brandy."</p>

<p>Herr Schmidt bowed.</p>

<p>"Trout," he said, "turn out all his pockets and hand me his
pocket-book. In the meantime the gentleman can enjoy his last
plunge of dissipation."</p>

<p>The solemn-looking sub-inspector did as he was told, and handed
Herr Schmidt the pocket-book. That gentleman turned it over slowly
and drew out a card. When his eyes alighted on it, his face
expressed sudden amazement, and then he threw back his head and
laughed explosively.</p>

<p>"Cyrus G. Vines!" he exclaimed. "Cyrus G. Vines of the New York
police! It's quite true we've been expecting Mr. Cyrus G. Vines for
some time on this Hyems case. Holy Christopher! and are you really
Cyrus G. Vines? Well, I'm damned! Also, I'm glad, if it's true. We
shall require a little more evidence on that count. But in the
meantime will you kindly explain your presence in Mrs. Huggins's
house in Camden Town?"</p>

<p>Mr. Vines grinned. There was no longer any of the Frenchman
about him. In fact, he carefully removed the little tuft of beard
and mustache of the conventional stage Gaul. He puffed at his cigar
and said:</p>

<p>"Unless my calculations are at fault, you will be Inspector
Hartrigg. It is quite true my duty was to report right away to
Scotland Yard. But it happens I'm a young man. Inspector, and I
have ambitions to make good. I arrived at Liverpool last Friday;
the boat was thirty hours ahead of time. I just thought I'd buzz
around for a day or two on my own and see whether I couldn't get
the case a bit straighter to hand over. I got wise that this Hyems
galoot was boarding on the first floor of this shanty. I tracked
him here and found him disguised as a Hun! Do you take me?"</p>

<p>The "Hun" pulled at the little tuft of beard between his chins,
and twirled his genuine mustache.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a nice go!" he said. "Between us we have missed
the quarry. I confess I only traced him to this house. I didn't
know which floor. But when I discovered that there was only one
other lodger, and he a Frenchman, the case seemed obvious."</p>

<p>"Say, Inspector," interjected the American, "what was your idea
of this German stunt?"</p>

<p>"Hyems has been further suspected of dealing with a German
agent, as I have told you. I thought a nice friendly German might
draw him out. That is all. It is quite true I don't know German
well, although I spent a long time in France. Now, tell me what was
your idea of the French stunt, Vines?"</p>

<p>"A Frenchman enjoys certain prerogatives," Vines smilingly
replied. "He can be talkative, inquiring, sympathetic. He can even
make inquiries concerning 'things of the heart' without giving
offense. Now, Mrs. Huggins is a very charming and sympathetic
woman, and she has a daughter, I believe, although I've never had
the pleasure of meeting her."</p>

<p>"That's true. But how does this affect Hyems?"</p>

<p>The "Frenchman" rose and said:</p>

<p>"Inspector, I understand that I am technically under arrest. But
you have already granted me two favors while in that condition, and
I am bold enough to appeal for a third. It is that you all three
should accompany me to my room on the third floor and observe the
devastating effect of love."</p>

<p>The four men trooped up-stairs, and Vines threw open the door of
his bedroom. On his bed lay Mr. Livermore, neatly gagged and
bound.</p>

<p>"This is our friend Hyems," remarked Vines. "We will remove the
gag. I put it there because I didn't want our dinner disturbed by
any fuss or excitement."</p>

<p>He removed the gag and said:</p>

<p>"How are you, Hyems?"</p>

<p>The wild-eyed man on the bed was in a state of collapse. He
glanced at the other four men and closed his eyes, muttering:</p>

<p>"Go on. It's a do."</p>

<p>Inspector Hartrigg looked at the man carefully. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"My God! you 're right. That's Hyems. Skinner and Trout, stay
with this man for a few minutes. He's under arrest, remember, I'll
call you in a few minutes. Vines, come down to my room again. There
are one or two points I'd like to clear up."</p>

<p>"Herr Schmidt" and "M. de la Roche" returned to the room below
and surveyed the scene of their repast, and then both laughed.</p>

<p>"Come, a little more of this excellent brandy. Monsieur de la
Roche, and then tell me how you accomplished your capture."</p>

<p>They filled their glasses once more.</p>

<p>"It all came fairly easy," explained Vines, "when I had once
ingratiated myself with Mrs. Huggins. She's a daisy, that woman.
She was full of this story about Livermore and her Maggie; but it
was not till this morning, when the mail came, that I got wise on
the real trend of things. Wherever I am, I always like to be right
there when the mail's delivered. There's information of all sorts
to be picked up even from the outside. This morning there was a
long envelop franked and sealed, addressed to 'Herr Schmidt.' I was
just crazy to open that communication, and I was just on the point
of securing it when Mrs. Huggins came fussing into the hall. I
retired to my room again for about fifteen minutes. When I got back
to the hall the long envelop addressed to you had vanished, and a
stranger was fingering the mail. I called for Mrs. Huggins. When
she came, she soon put the stranger to flight with a broom and her
tongue. I was a very sympathetic Frenchman, and then it was she
told me the whole story of Mr. Livermore and her Maggie. While she
was speaking, the whole truth came to me in a flash. I realized
that Livermore was Hyems, but I was darned if I could place you.
The capture was dead easy. In the hurried removal of Livermore's
things last night, our good landlady had overlooked one or two
trifles. She had apparently dumped some on that old chest at the
top of the kitchen stairs. I found there a small box in which I
discovered several notes and <i>billets doux</i> signed by 'M.' I
am no mug at faking calligraphy. That afternoon I despatched a note
to Mr. Livermore in the handwriting of M.</p>

<p class="letter">"'Do come at five-thirty. Mother will be out.
Tremendously important. M.'</p>

<p>"I underlined 'tremendously important' four times. It was one of
the lady's minor characteristics. At five-thirty Mrs. Huggins was
very considerately buying me a couple of shirts in the High Street.
I was alone in the house. I let Mr. Livermore in. The rest was just
dead easy&mdash;as easy as skinning a rabbit."</p>

<p>"Herr Fritz" laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, Vines," he said, "I congratulate you. It was a smart
piece of work. I feel convinced you are destined to 'make good.' It
looks as though our friend would even now be free if he hadn't been
so enterprising as to rob the mail this morning and steal his own
warrant of arrest."</p>

<p>"Ah, so that's what it was."</p>

<p>"I notified Chief Inspector Shapples yesterday that I had my man
under observation, but when I left the Yard the warrant was not
complete. The whole thing seemed so simple that he said he'd post
it to me, which is quite an irregular proceeding, but one we
occasionally indulge in. When it did not come this morning I judged
that you had stolen it, and so I obtained a new one to-day. I must
say, in fairness to our service, that you have been watched and
followed all day and that you would have found it somewhat
difficult to make an escape. I did not arrest you before because I
did not wish to miss our little dinner this evening, and I also
wanted to glean some information about other parties who are still
at large. I thought you were fencing very skilfully, and, if you
will allow me to say so, I am glad now that I was quite on the
wrong tack."</p>

<p>"Inspector," replied the American, "I have not enjoyed such a
dinner for a very, very long time, and I'm real glad to have made
your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"After this success I hope the authorities will permit you to
assist me in unraveling other little troubles in connection with
the case before you return to New York. Here's to your good health
and prosperity!"</p>

<p>"And yours. Inspector, to say nothing of Mrs. Huggins! My, isn't
she a peach!"</p>

<p>"You know, dearie," said Mrs. Huggins, three weeks later, in the
private bar of the Staff of Life, to her friend Mrs. O'Neil, "it's
a very rum thing about gals. There's my Mag, now. Lord! how she
took on when this 'ere case came up. She was going to do this,
that, and the other; but when they reely took 'im away, she calmed
down like the lamb she is. And now she's already walking out with
Sandy Waters, as nice a young feller as you could wish to meet.
He's a soldier, you know, an officer; 'e's got all these 'ere
stripes on 'is arm. A quartermaster, that's what 'e is; gets 'is
perks all over the place. Gets quite a good livin', and when 'e
goes, she gets 'er maintenance and a bob a day what 'e allots 'er
like, to say nothin' of seven and six for the first child, six
shillings for the second, three and six for the third, and three
bob apiece for the rest; that is, if the war lasts long enough.
They 're as sweet on each other as a couple of gumdrops in a glass
bottle."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil blew the froth off the stout.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful' interestin' case," she said, "what wif all
this spyin' and cheatin' and stealin'. Lord! what a narrer escape
you 'ad, Mrs. 'Uggins! 'Im comin', too, and stealin' the postman's
letters in the mornin'. What a villain!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Huggins coughed, and cleared her throat. Then she looked
thoughtfully across her glass and said:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, dearie, it's rather funny about that part. Of
course, you know, it's nothing departmental to the case, as they
say, or I might 'ave spoken out in court about it; but as a matter
of fact, 'e never pinched that letter at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil looked aghast, and Mrs. Huggins winked
mysteriously.</p>

<p>"No. You see," she whispered, "it was like this 'ere. I was very
rushed that mornin', what with the to-do of Mr. Smith's dinner, and
that, and I couldn't get the b'iler to go. I never take no
noospapers now. There's nothin' in 'em except about this bloomin'
war. I takes my 'Reynold's' on Sunday, but as fire-paper that don't
last long. Lately I've taken to usin' these 'ere circulars what
come from the sales, you know&mdash;spring goods, white sales, and
so on. I never looks at 'em. I simply rips 'em open and shoves 'em
into the b'iler fire. On that mornin', being 'ard-pressed as it
were, I runs up into the 'all, and seein' circulars there, I cops
'old of 'em and runs down to the scullery. I rips 'em open and
shoves 'em in. It was not till I got the b'iler goin' that I
realized that one of the circulars 'ad a great red sealin'-wax blob
on the envelop, and it was all official-like. It was too late then,
but I thinks to myself: 'I burnt somethin' I didn't ought to then.
That was a summons or somethin'.' Soon after that I 'eard the
rumpus up-stairs."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Mrs. O'Neil. "You run a risk there,
Annie."</p>

<p>"As I say," repeated Mrs. Huggins, "it wasn't departmental to
the case. There was enough proved against 'im to 'ang 'im in this
country and quarter 'im in America without draggin' in a silly old
envelop like that."</p>

<p>"Well, I 'ope your Mag'll be 'appy," said Mrs. O'Neil, wiping
her mouth.</p>

<p>"My Mag'll be all right. Don't <i>you</i> worry," replied Mrs.
Huggins.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>The Genie of the Dingle*
(story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>Hutchinson's Story Magazine</i>, Sep 1919</p>

<p class="cp">[* <i>dingle</i>: A small wooded valley; a dell.]</p>

<p>It simply would not come right. David Stroud sat back in his
chair and stared out of the window, with all the sheets of
manuscript scattered on the table in front of him. Thus he had sat
for nearly three hours, without once putting his pen to the paper.
He knew that the main idea for the book was a good one, and there
was a kind of second theme a little below the surface which
intrigued him, but things would not, somehow, dovetail. He stared
from the window to the fireplace; he bit his nails (a very bad
habit); he lighted a cigarette and walked up and down the room. It
was a meagrely furnished room, with a bedroom adjoining, the two
comprising his lodgings in an obscure house in West Kensington.</p>

<p>David was young&mdash;barely twenty-three&mdash;and he had come
to London from the cathedral town of Norwich, with the usual
determination to set the big city by the ears. His father had been
an organist and music-teacher, and on his death had left a small
sum of money to be divided between David and his sister Hilda. It
brought them in about eighty pounds a year each, but Hilda had
since married a fairly prosperons young doctor and continued to
live at Norwich. The mother had died when they were both quite
young. David, consequently, was alone in London except for several
chance acquaintances. Loneliness has its compensations as well as
its bleak disadvantages. He did not entirely regret his loneliness.
To a man who is going to set London by the ears, write the big
novel, the world-disturbing play, a large amount of loneliness is
essential.</p>

<p>He had been in London a year, and had had one or two short
stories accepted and had done a little hack journalism, but the big
novel was still in a very embryonic stage, and on this morning,
after two hours' abortive thinking, he suddenly became intensely
alive to his loneliness. It was June and pale sunlight was
streaming through the windows. Somewhere the world must be very
beautiful.</p>

<p>"I know what it is: I'm stale." he thought.</p>

<p>He contemplated a walk in the park&mdash;his usual
recreation&mdash;but decided that this would hardly meet the case.
It was change he wanted: something definite and magical at the same
time. He thought for a long time, and then went and borrowed an old
Cassells' time-table from his landlady. He knew nothing about the
country near London, but he reckoned that one would have to travel
for at least an hour to escape from bricks and mortar. At last he
pitched on a place called Moblesham-by-the-Mill. He liked the name.
It was on a side line not far from Guildford. The fare was cheap,
and it would be somewhere near the Surrey Downs. It would
serve.</p>

<p>Rather apathetically he boarded a motor-bus to Waterloo and took
his ticket. The train journey wearied him, and when he arrived at a
station where he had to change, he hesitated whether he should not
return. He had a premonition of failure. The people in the train
irritated him; the interminable suburbs gave him no hope.</p>

<p>Even when he arrived at Moblesham-by-the-Mill he was doomed to
disappointment. It was a plain, villa-y little town, with an ugly
main street, a large brewery, and innumerable tin chapels. There
was no mill and and no evidence of there ever having been a mill.
It was nearly midday when he arrived there, and he walked
listlessly into an inn and ordered some bread and cheese and some
shandy-gaff. Having negotiated this modest lunch he started out to
walk. The road led for nearly a mile between high hedges with
fields on either side, and then began to slope upwards. His legs
ached; the prospect of a climb depressed him. Coming to a fork in
the road, he chose the narrower road which still led upwards. After
a time the country opened out more, and he sat on a gate and smoked
a a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I'm in rotten condition," he thought. The cigarette had no
attractions for him, and he wanted to lie down and sleep. So
insistent was this desire that he decided that he must make a
determined effort to counter it. He threw away the cigarette and
began to walk briskly. He selected a narrow lane which led through
a copse of young larch trees. His choice was influenced largely by
the fact that the lane was steeper than the road, and he wanted to
do what he didn't feel inclined to. He urged himself forward. The
air was becoming very fresh and sweet and the birds were singing
gaily. He began to think about his book, but nothing happened; the
same old ideas still jumbled against each other. He crossed a
common and caught a glimpse of blue distances; he was certainly up
in the Surrey hills. An old man passed and touched his hat. David
jerked out:</p>

<p>"Oh, how do yon do?" in the tight voice of a man who has been
too long confined to city life.</p>

<p>He passed a farm where a team of large sleek horses were just
returning to the fields in charge of an old carter and a boy. David
sighed, and rested once more against the farm-gate. He was in bad
condition. And yet there was something a little soothing in all
this.</p>

<p>He went on. Suddenly the lane forked again. This time he took
the lower turning, because it seemed the more deserted, better
attuned to his melancholy mood. He had not progressed more than
four hundred yards when he came to the dingle.</p>

<p>It nestled in the hollow of a disused chalk-pit. It was wild and
overgrown with shrubs, gorse, and delicate birch trees. He
instinctively plunged into it. The soil was sandy; fresh young
green leaves tickled his face and hair, brambles caught at his
trousers. He came to the carcase of an old fallen tree partially
covered with moss and lichen. He chose a part of the stem where the
bark had peeled away, and sat down.</p>

<p>It was extraordinarily quiet and remote. He had never felt so
cut off from the world. Bees droned around him in the gorse, the
little sounds of birds and living things unfamiliar to him soothed
his senses. The sun, streaming through the leaves, made bewildering
patterns. Martins swung in semicircles at the top of the pit.</p>

<p>It was..somehow, cosy. He sat with his elbows dug into his knees
and his hands holding his head, and examined the activities of some
red ants darting in and out from beneath the bark of the tree he
sat on. He had an uncomfortable feeling that the ants would get on
to his trousers or his coat, and crawl all over him. He edged
farther away, and looked around him igain. He felt like a small boy
scenting adventure, but slightly nervous of the unknown. In this
arabesque of sunlight and foliage it was difficult to detach
things. It was the kind of place that a small boy could imagine the
eyes of a tiger, or a rattlesnake, or even&mdash;a Red Indian! He
would like to be a small boy again, playing at Red Indians with his
sister Hilda in the garden at Norwich. His mother's slim figure in
the doorway...</p>

<p>"Why should the father-confessor himself not be the lover, his
secret hidden behind his dark cowl? Why should he not tell the
story?"</p>

<p>Strange! but as David sat there blinking in the sunlight he
could almost swear that a voice whispered this into his ear! What
did it mean? The father-confessor? Why, yes, of course there was a
father-confessor in the story...It had not occurred to him. He was
not thinking of his book, but suddenly he began to think very
rapidly. The whole thing unfolded itself before his mind's eye. On
those lines the story would be much more manageable. The various
themes began to coordinate. His pulses were throbbing at an
unaccustomed rate. He could see it all. The main idea became simple
and dignified, inevitable. Everything took its place. His fingers
itched to set it down; but he had not even a note-book.</p>

<p>He sat there till the sun began to set, and no one disturbed
him. He glowed with a quiet contentment, feeling himself the medium
of expression of forces greater than himself. Then, when the light
began to fade, he rose up and shook himself.</p>

<p>"Queer," he thought, "that it should have come like that! Of
course it was nonsense my fancying I heard the voice. I'm
ridiculously run down; I must do this more often."</p>

<p>He walked quickly down the hill, humming to himself. When he
arrived home he snatched a hasty meal, and then he sat down to
write. He wrote all night.</p>

<p>He slept till the afternoon, and awoke still tingling with the
sense of new-found power. Thoughts came easily, and had only to be
set down. For nearly three weeks he worked at pressure. The story
made astounding progress.</p>

<p>And then another day came when the feeling of emptiness and
lassitude assailed him. He struggled through the day, restless,
feverish, and discontented. He wanted to go on, but his brain
seemed disinclined to work. On the other hand, in his anxiety to
get the book finished, he resented having to waste a day in the
country. When night came he realised that he had accomplished
nothing. He slept badly and rose at dawn.</p>

<p>"I must go for another tramp." he thought. He caught the
earliest train and went to Epsom. He walked up to the Downs. A
light breeze was building up a splendid architectural arrangement
of clouds. It was a glorious day. He walked, and walked, and
walked. Sometimes rested and began to think of his book, but no
ideas came.</p>

<p>"It will come as before, quite suddenly," he determined. "I feel
better, anyway. It's foolish not to do this more often."</p>

<p>He walked till the evening, occasionally lying down by clumps of
bushes, leaning on stiles and gates, humming, and&mdash;trying to
think. When it became time to go he felt his limbs quivering with
exhaustion, but no progress had been made with his work. He
returned home disgruntled and crestfallen.</p>

<p>The next dav he found himself in no better case. He idled the
day away, the issue of the book becoming more confused. At the end
of the week he made another desperate sortie on to the fields and
lanes. Still without result.</p>

<p>It was not till the following Wednesday that he decided that he
would once more go back to the dingle. It was a grey day, but
tolerably warm. He took the train to Moblesham-by-the-Mill, and
started out to find the dingle. He had some difficulty in doing
this, as he had made no note of the roads and turnings which he had
taken on the previous occasion. He wandered afar, came back, and at
length recognised the little lane which skirted the chalk-pit.</p>

<p>The dingle had lost its wild pattern of bewildering sunlight and
shadow. It was in a benign mood. The air was tender and caressing.
The young trees nodded in a companionable manner. A rabbit darted
from a hole in the sand, stared at him with almost friendly eyes,
and then scampered away among the bracken. He felt that he wanted
to laugh. He sat on the fallen tree and began to think of amusing
incidents of his boyhood. All his present troubles were forgotten.
And then, suddenly, something seemed to whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>"The fisherman goes from the east side of the river to the west,
from the west to the east. Is it only fish he carries in his
basket?"</p>

<p>He started. What was this strange intrusion? What fisherman?
What basket? What river? What did it all mean? His mind reverted
instantly to the book. Fisherman? There was no fisherman in the
book, but...yes, of course, the character of Fra Lomberto...It
would be possible...the analogy was obvious. Clearly and swiftly
his mind began to work. The ill-assorted arrangements of ideas fell
into a proper perspective. He visualised the working-up, the
development of character and plot, the climax, the slackening, and
the easy passage to a surprising finish. The whole thing was
complete and finished in his mind.</p>

<p>David gazed around him, surprised, delighted and mystified. He
peered into the bushes ans mounds of sand as though expecting some
elf with gossamer wings to spring before him, playing upon a reed.
He trembled with a kind of exultation. He did not believe in
spirits or elves. But&mdash;there <i>must</i> something about the
dingle!</p>

<p>He put his hands to his head and staggered to the lane. Of
course it was absurd! It had just so happened. Ideas came to one at
odd and unexpected moments, and they had happened to come on the
two occasions when he had visited the dingle.</p>

<p>He hurried down the hill and caught his train.</p>

<p>For over a month he worked uninterruptedly. The book was
finished and despatched to a publisher who had shown an interest in
his work. But it was not published for six months. In the meantime
he was at work on other things: a play, some poems and essays, and
another novel. It was not till late in the autumn that he became
convinced that&mdash;for him in any case&mdash;<i>there was a genie
of the dingle!</i></p>

<p>For he tried the experiment again and again, and it never
appeared to fail. Directly his creative power became stagnant he
took the train to Moblesham and sought his dingle. Sometimes the
little whispers of the leaves were slower in their delivery of the
revelation than at other times, but they never utterly disappointed
him. On occasions the illumination would not come till he was
returning from the dingle, or even till he went to bed that
night.</p>

<p>One day he tried the experiment of writing in the dingle. He
took a writing-pad and fountain-pen, but the result was not
successful. Ideas came, but not the facility to set them down. He
was distracted by the sunlight and the movement. It did not appear
to be within the covenant of the high gods who presided over this
enchanted spot. It was essentially a place for inspiration, for
adjustment, but not for the deliberate prosecution of a
routine.</p>

<p>In the winter, when the book was published, it happened to catch
the eye of a luminary in a little office off the Strand, who
foresaw the glories of a personal scoop in discovering a young and
unknown writer. He let himself go in a weekly journal devoted to
such things, and became maudlin over it in a large club in St.
James's. It had no great sale, but it attained a <i>succs
d'estime</i>. Other works were published and commented upon.</p>

<p>Even in the winter he visited the dingle. When the trees were
bare and there were great squidgy pools of water, he would still go
and plunge about, humming to himself, laughing gaily, feeling
virile and joyous. And the little voice was always eloquent. He
began to know every mound and tree and shrub in the dingle, and he
watched their growth and colour and peculiarity.</p>

<p>David was not a mystic. He tried to explain the whole thing to
himself.</p>

<p>"There's just something about this place that's sympathetic. The
walk is good for me. By the time I get here I am feeling well. They
are not really voices I hear. Only I like it; it's very beautiful,
extraordinarily quiet and remote, and then the&mdash;combination of
things stimulates me. That's all to it. But it's very queer."</p>

<p>It was two years later that David met the genie face to face. He
was becoming a successful man, already recognised as being more
than "promising." "This young author is going to count," announced
the Delphic oracle of the literary world. He had moved to more
commodious rooms and had even bought an upright piano, on which he
groped his way to vague satisfactions.</p>

<p>One day late in June he was sitting in the dingle, musing upon
the strange influence it had exercised upon his fate. The dingle
was in its wild, patterned mood, the sunlight dancing through the
leaves. He was staring idly at the quivering appearance of a
stunted almond tree, and thinking how difficult it was in this
effect to separate one tone from another, when suddenly he became
uncomfortably aware that eyes were watching him through the
pattern.</p>

<p>He stood up, and instantly a branch quivered vertically and the
genie sprang lightly to the ground near his feet. She had bright,
Puck-like eyes, and an oval, elfish face framed in a mass of dark
brown hair, a dark green fustian kind of tunic and brown-stockinged
legs. She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! I'm awfully sorry!"</p>

<p>David stared at her foolishly, and re-echoed:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry!"</p>

<p>It was obvious that each felt that they were prying into the
privacy of the other's life.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you till just now," remarked the genie.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was only just sitting there," answered David limply.</p>

<p>"It's very jolly here." said the genie.</p>

<p>"Do you live here?" murmured the mystified young man.</p>

<p>Then the surprising visitor from the spirit-world laughed and
shook her shining hair, and in the process displayed a line of
small and perfect teeth.</p>

<p>"I do, pretty nearly," she answered. "I live down the road at
that red house. It's called 'Clonbeggan' for some reason or other.
I haven't any brothers or sisters, and I come here nearly every
day. My father's a doctor, and he's always busy; and my mother's in
London."</p>

<p>She sat on her haunches on the sand, with her legs crossed,
facing him. David stared at her as though still doubtful of her
reality. She was just a girl, perhaps sixteen or seventeen, the
daughter of a country doctor. At least, that was what she said. But
what was real and what imaginary in the dingle? He said
huskily:</p>

<p>"You say you come here often?"</p>

<p>"I've been here nearly every day years and years and years."</p>

<p>"Strange that I have never seen you!"</p>

<p>"Why do you come to the dingle?"</p>

<p>David started. He felt curiously alarmed and self-conscious. He
looked down at his hands and coughed. Then, leaning towards her, he
said:</p>

<p>"Do you ask why I come? I'm a writer an author. I come to the
dingle because&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and suddenly she leapt to her feet and clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>"Oh. I know! I know!" she said. "How lovely!"</p>

<p>And shaking her roguish curls at him, she darted away through
the trees.</p>

<p>David stretched out his arms and called after her; then realised
that he was behaving rather ridiculously, and sat down. After all,
it was quite simple. A lonely little girl living not far away. She
here to play. But why had he not seen her before? Had she been
watching him? What did she mean when she said "I know!"? And, above
all, would he see her again?</p>

<p>He returned home, thinking of his work and the elfin child. Her
visit had been so brief and her movements so quick he not had the
opportunity to study her as he wanted to. But she was very
beautiful, very vital&mdash;a goddess worthy of the dingle. He was
in an inspired mood the next day, and he began what proved to be
his most successful work, an allegory called <i>The Chalk
Pit</i>.</p>

<p>He visited the dingle three times before he saw his genie again.
And then, one day, she slithered between the branches of the almond
tree and threw herself on the ground by his feet. He gave an
exclamation, and she said:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>He put out his hand, but without touching her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh! it is you. I've been looking for you."</p>

<p>"I've seen you twice."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you speak to me?"</p>

<p>"You were working."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I could tell by your face."</p>

<p>"You queer child! Tell me your name." "Stella."</p>

<p>"I love the name of Stella."</p>

<p>"Read me something you've written."</p>

<p>"Alas! I've nothing here."</p>

<p>"Tell me a story, then."</p>

<p>David blinked at the sunshine, real and imaginary. He smiled,
and wondered, and worshipped. Then suddenly he began to tell her
the story which he had not yet written, <i>The Chalk Pit</i>. He
pieced it together, watching the joy and sorrow and sympathy
flicker across her sensitive face. And when he had finished it she
was crying and he said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Stella."</p>

<p>She did not look at him, but she replied:</p>

<p>"No. I like to cry. It's very beautiful."</p>

<p>And suddenly she snatched his hand and kissed it, and walked
away through the trees.</p>

<p>After that she seemed bolder. Nearly every time he visited the
dingle she came she came to meet him, and he found the place more
inspiring and fruitful of ideas than ever. Before the end of the
summer he called on her father, Dr. Parsons, a rotund, red-faced
little man, quite unlike his daughter. He was courteous, but
somewhat pre-occupied. He sat forward, leaning on his knees, and
asked David a few questions about his professional life. He
listened to the replies without giving the impression that they had
sunk in. A dog-cart was waiting to take him on his rounds. He rose
at the end of ten minutes and pressed David's hand, and
murmured:</p>

<p>"Very delighted...any time," and he waved his hand vaguely
towards the fireplace.</p>

<p>David heard afterwards from the villagers that Dr. Parsons' wife
was a very beautiful Roumanian lady. But there had been some great
trouble. They no longer lived together. She was in London or Paris,
and she never visited her husband or child.</p>

<p>And in time David went beyond the dingle. He went for walks with
Stella, and sat in her garden under the walnut tree, and told her
of his ambitions, and his life, and his sister, and his work, and
the people he met in the social life which was gradually enveloping
him.</p>

<p>For three years this strange friendship grew and quickened, and
David was then referred to as "this brilliant young author," and
his sister, Hilda, in her placid home at Norwich, blushed with
pride, and wealthy people sought him out and publishers began to
jostle each other for his wares. And David was dazzled. He was
accomplishing what he had set out to accomplish, and all within the
space of five years. He began to adore flattery, and adulation was
food and wine to him.</p>

<p>There was only one disconcerting element in this joyous scheme.
He encountered it on the lawn of Dr. Parsons' house. It came in the
person of Ephraim Barnes. Ephraim Barnes was a young, keen-faced
man of Semitic origin. He was a successful builder and contractor,
who drove about the country in his own car. Being cured of a bad
attack of sciatica by Dr. Parsons, he had visited him, and there,
of course, met Stella. Stella showed him no special attention, but
Ephraim was persistent, keen, and thorough. And suddenly David
realised that he was jealous. Finding him there on three successive
occasions, he took his dingle-maiden to task.</p>

<p>"Stella, are you fond of this man?"</p>

<p>"No. David."</p>

<p>"Not a bit?"</p>

<p>"Not a scrap. He bores me."</p>

<p>"You would never marry him Stella?"</p>

<p>Stella peeped at him coyly, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! how foolishly you talk!"</p>

<p>On his way home David suddenly thought:</p>

<p>"Good God! I'm in love with that girl!"</p>

<p>And he began to reason with tumself. To be a "brilliant young
author" and to have arrived are two very different things. David
was by no means well off. He lived above his income. He found
fashionable house-parties far more expensive than expensive hotels.
He ached to buy antique furniture, pictures, to have a beautiful
house; and he could sec no prospect of attaining anything so
fantastic. His palate for success had been whetted, but the banquet
had not begun. What was he to do? He had seen the distressing
results of some of his friends marrying when they were not in a
position to. They went down the sink; they prostituted their art in
the sordid struggle; they became hemmed in by babies, domestic
troubles, and insistent material demands. They soon ceased to
count. And yet&mdash;Stella! Her eyes followed him through the dim
shadows of the night. She was an obsession, an angel, a nymph, his
genie of the dingle.</p>

<p>Ho hesitated, and did nothing. He visited her home and the
dingle, and he drew inspiration from both. He fumed with jealousy
at the sight of the unspeakable Ephraim. But the summer passed, and
the winter, and the position remained the same.</p>

<p>And in the following spring he met Laura van Steyn. He met her
at a house-party at the Frankinstein-Possets, the Bond Street
picture-dealers. She was tall, fair, rather distinguished-looking,
very emotional, and gorgeously apparelled. She was a widow, three
years older than David, and enormously wealthy. Her husband had
been an American canned-fruit magnate. There was nothing of the
canned fruit about Laura. She was passionately devoted to art and
artists; she devoted her life to helping and flattering young
painters, and musicians, and writers. She did not spare herself
with regard to David. She took lum aside under a pergola darkened
by clusters of blood-red roses, and told him, more by the heaving
of her bosom and her breathless intonation than by what she said,
that he stood on the threshold of being what George Meredith,
Thomas Hardy, and others had tried to be. And David drank it in,
and realised that here was a divinity. Little diamonds sparkled at
her throat, a gold bag hung by a wondrous antique chain nestled
between the folds of silk upon her lap. Her skin was incredibly
fair, and there was a watchful beauty about her eyes, as though she
were the high-priestess guarding the sacerdotal offerings of all
that was more priceless and forbidden in human life.</p>

<p>David walked with her, and as he had nothing else to flatter, he
flattered her beauty and her intelligence. Before the house-party
broke up she invited him to visit her in town. Alas! poor
Stella.</p>

<p>Followed then a year of doubt, contrition, and dazzling
dreams.</p>

<p>On the eve of the day when he married Laura, she said:</p>

<p>"My darling, you shall be the greatest writer in the world.
Everything shall be arranged for you. In London you shall have the
walnut-panelled room overlooking the park, as your study; and at
Fobbiesham we will build a bungalow hidden right away in the woods,
where not a soul shall disturb you. But change, change, is the
great thing to a creative artist. I understand the artist soul. We
will travel."</p>

<p>"You shall have beautiful rooms to work in at Naples, Florence,
Venice, and Sicily. Always a change, fresh experiences, fresh
people. We will go to Egypt and Algeria, India and China. We will
build a world of beauty around us, collecting as we go, adding to
it, studying, finding more and more in each other. Kiss me,
David."</p>

<p>They stayed two months at Naples in a villa overlooking the bay.
David had a large study furnished with Franois Premier furniture
and Persian rugs, and a writing-desk reputed to have been the
property of Racine. And for six hours a day he sat there, staring
at blank sheets of paper or reading over the things he had written
last year. Sometimes he would start up and look out of the window
at the bay, and other times he would bury his face in his hands and
dream&mdash;of Stella and the dingle.</p>

<p>He would visualise the last time he had visited her, her
laughing, innocent eyes, the chain of marigolds she had made and
crowned him with, her babbling excitement over the things they were
going to do together; and, O God! he had never told her! His
courage had failed him. He was a coward, and he could not think.
Thoughts were going round and round and jumbling each other, and
there was no genie to set them right!</p>

<p>He plunged into social dissipations. He bought experiences to
which he had been previously a stranger, and he could do nothing
with them. He told his wife he could not work on his honeymoon, and
she was enchanted.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry, <i>mon brave</i>," she said; and they went
to Sicily.</p>

<p>They travelled from Sicily to Algiers, from Algiers to Cairo;
then down the Nile as far as Fashoda, back from Fashoda to Cairo;
crossed to Genoa, visited Florence, Sienna, and Venice. They stayed
at Venice for two months, in the hope that David would settle down
to work. By this time he had realised that his wife was shallow and
superficial, all her enthusiasms were froth bubbling on the stream.
She was always flying off at a tangent, being carried away by some
new mood or fashion, discovering some new genius. She became
irrirated that David did not produce new and interesting work. She
tired a little of him, and he found her dull, and their days were
filled with great emptiness.</p>

<p>In Venice he did no work, and one day he told her about the
dingle. She listened apathetically, and did not seem to understand.
When he had finished, she said:</p>

<p>"How peculiar! Now, my dear, we will go to Bonhghera. My sister
has a villa up in the hils and she has written and offered to lend
it to me. Venice is too distracting. At Bordighera it is quiet, and
oh, so restful! There you will feel constrained to work, my
love."</p>

<p>They crossed the peninsula and took up their abode at the Villa
Gasparri at Bordighera. It was indeed a glorious spot, nestling in
the hills, a garden overflowing with clematis, passion-flowers, and
roses, and an avenue of cypresses pointing to the sea. For some
days David enjoyed the garden, and he sat at the open window of his
study, biting the end of his pen. And then the mood of remorse and
dissatisfaction again assailed him. He wandered aimlessly about the
country, and spoke bitterly. Laura sought other company, and had no
difficulty in finding it along this gay and alluring coast. She
left him to his own devices. One night at dinner he made another
reference to the dingle, and she turned on him and said
bitingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, that dingle! Why do you always talk of that dingle?"</p>

<p>And David pushed his plate away and walked out of the room and
out of the villa. He walked bareheaded up into the hills. His heart
overflowed with angry and disturbed feelings. He strode along
quickly, and his breath came in little stabs between his nostrils.
At length he returned and went straight into the salon, where Laura
was arranging masses of blue delphinium in a tall vase. Without any
preliminary explanation he bore down on her.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why." he almost shouted. "In every man's life
there is a dingle. Do you understand what I mean? A dingle, a
dingle, a dingle! Some place that is just his and no other's. It's
the environment he must have, or he's no good. You can't explain
it; he can't explain it. It's what his soul demands, and nothing
else will serve. It may be a room in a slum, a side-chapel in a
cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a set of conditions, the touch
of a friend's hands&mdash;almost anything it may be, but it must be
just that. Nothing else is any good to him. One has to be loyal to
one's dingle, or...one is finished!"</p>

<p>He picked up an embroidered mat from a side table, and scrunched
it in his hands.</p>

<p>"I've not been true...I've deserted my dingle, and I'm lost!" He
buried his face in his hands. "O God! we can't help it: we're made
like that!"</p>

<p>By the door Laura turned. Her lips were white. She said quite
calmly:</p>

<p>"You fool!"</p>

<p>Five days later David Stroud arrived in London. He stayed the
night at his old rooms in West Kensington. His face was drawn and
thin, and dark rings encircled his eyes, but there was a buoyancy
and hope about his bearing.</p>

<p>In the morning he awoke refreshed. He caught an early train to
Moblesham-by-the-Mill. It was April, and little clusters of
primroses peeped at him from the hedges. His heart was beating
rapidly. Stella! Would she be in the dingle? Was she still there?
Did she think of him? Would she understand? Could he ever get back
to the old position?</p>

<p>At the turning where the lane forked he was disturbed to find a
large red-brick house. He muttered curses on the activities of
speculating builders, and plunged down the lane. He had not
advanced two hundred yards when he suddenly stopped. He felt he was
going to swoon. He staggered to a gate and supported himself. Beads
of perspiration streamed down his face.</p>

<p>"It's finished," he said hoarsely. "Everything is finished!"</p>

<p>An iron gallery crossed the road. Great chimneys and cranes
stood out against the sky. A wooden fence shut off what once had
been the dingle. Above the top of it he could see a wilderness of
corrugated iron and white chalk, smoke and corruption. A
steam-navvy was puffing noisily, figures were coming and going,
whilst standing out insolently at an angle to the road was a large
slate-coloured board, on which was painted:</p>

<p>"Ephraim Barnes &amp; Co., Lime and Cement Merchants."</p>

<p>David clung to the gate. He had ditficulty in getting his
breath. An old woman who came hobbling down the lane stopped and
said:</p>

<p>"Are you sick, mister? Is anything awry?"</p>

<p>He shook himself nervously and jerked out:</p>

<p>"No, no, thank you; it's all right."</p>

<p>"It's muggy for the time of year," remarked the old lady.</p>

<p>David was struggling to keep himself in hand. He controlled his
voice as be replied:</p>

<p>"Yes. Can you tell me, madam, who lives at the red-brick house
at the corner?"</p>

<p>She turned her old face in the direction he was looking, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Ay, Mr. Barnes 'isself and 'is family lives there."</p>

<p>"Oh! Could you tell me...whom did Mr. Barnes marry?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Barnes? Oo&mdash;e married old Dr. Parsons' daughter."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;she&mdash;still&mdash;there?"</p>

<p>"Ay. she do that. She's expecting a child, they say. She's a
hard woman, though."</p>

<p>Hard! Stella!</p>

<p>"How do you mean, she's hard?"</p>

<p>"Eh, they doan't like 'er about these parts. She's too quiet,
sullen, bitter-like. She never talks to us cottage-folk, nor to no
one else, they say. They say her made her good man make them
lime-works in the dingle. Some whimsey or other. She's very
queer-like. They say it's payin' though, hand over fist. 'E makes a
lot of money, do Mr. Barnes."</p>

<p>"It's finished...it's all finished!" gasped David.</p>

<p>"Pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>"It's all right. I beg your pardon. Thank you very much."</p>

<p>The strange young man lowered his head and walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head. "Drink, perhaps," she murmured. "A
pleasant looking young man, too."</p>

<p>But David was only speaking the truth. It was finished. So
relentless are the gods who preside over these mysterious comings
and goings that if you look through Mudie's or any publisher's
trade-catalogue, you will find that no work by David Stroud has
ever been published since <i>The Chalk Pit</i> attained so
conspicuous a success.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">A Grave Responsibility</a>
(story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Strand Magazine</i>, August 1919</p>

<p>Old Ben Tilbury yawned and knocked his pipe out against the bars
of the stove. He had a capacious tea, and felt at ease with the
world. His wife sat opposite stitching some white linen garment.
His daughter Mildred was kneeling on the floor, and by the light of
a candle, to assist the uncertain glow of the paraffin lamp, was
cutting out a skirt from a paper pattern.</p>

<p>These dressmaking activities always produced in him&mdash;as far
as was possible in such a stolid nature&mdash;a mild feeling of
irritation. Such a lot of fuss and talk! A restless, finicky job,
dressmaking! He himself was a gardener, a man who dwelt in broad
issues. He planted in the autumn for the spring, in the spring for
the summer, slowly, methodically, reverently. It was big, noble
work. Dressmaking? Why, what you made in the autumn was out of
date, finished, in the spring!</p>

<p>He yawned again.</p>

<p>His wife remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Them gals of Mrs. Skinner's was over this afternoon. They want
to take Willie and Agnes to the treat at Betterleigh. I don't know,
I'm sure. They only went to one a week come Friday. What be your
moind about it, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" answered her husband. He was not listening very
attentively. As a matter of fact, he was cogitating the attractions
of a glass of ale and a chat with old Sam Bannerman at the Bunch of
Grapes. It was Saturday evening, and old Sam would be there, and
probably Sid Potton and Johnny Curtis. The conversation would be
worth while. They would talk about the land and the weather, and
dogs, and tobacco, and ratting, and other manly subjects.</p>

<p>He blew down his pipe and said, very slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! I doan't know. Might be all roight."</p>

<p>His wife added something about the frocks the Skinner girls were
wearing, and after a few minutes Ben stood up and stretched
himself. He walked to the cottage door and took down his cloth
cap.</p>

<p>"O-er," he drawled, "I remember I must take that insurance money
over to Carter's at Tringham."</p>

<p>"Don't be late, Ben," his wife called out as he raised the
latch.</p>

<p>"Oo-ay!"</p>

<p>It was a fine, calm night as he ambled down the village street.
He felt a quiet glow of contentment pervade him. A hard day's work
in the open air, a good meal, and then the prospect of a glass of
ale and a pipe, mellowed with an interesting talk about
ratting&mdash;what more could any reasonable man demand?</p>

<p>He passed the time of night with several acquaintances, and was
just turning the corner that led to the Bunch of Grapes when he ran
right into an individual who started at the sight of him and
gripped his arm, at the same time remarking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was looking for you."</p>

<p>It took Ben some seconds to recognize this gentleman in the fur
coat; and then he realized that it was his employer's secretary. He
had no great love for his employer. His name was Ephraim
Pendlebury-Leyfus. He had inherited an enormous fortune from his
father, who had made: it out of some patent medicine. Mr. and Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus were newfangled, bumptious upstarts of people who
were always driving about in motor-cars, and took no interest in
gardening. Fortunately for Ben, he never came in contact with them.
They paid him well and appointed him head-gardener, and he had
three assistants. He was allowed to do as he liked. It was a large
and well-appointed estate. Neither had he much regard for the
secretary, Mr. Smythe, a fussy, overdressed, patent-leather-booty
person, but still&mdash;one had to be polite. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good evenin', Mr. Smythe!"</p>

<p>And then he observed for the first time that Mr. Smythe was in a
state of frenzied agitation. His lips were quivering, and the
pupils of his eyes were dilated. He said, breathlessly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come. Get into this car. Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus wants to see you
at once."</p>

<p>"Wants to see I! At this toime o' noight!" The
delicately-planned scheme of his vegetable beds flashed through his
mind. What can a gardener do in the dark, on a Saturday night of
all nights?</p>

<p>But the other seemed in no mood for explanations. He gasped
something about being quick.</p>

<p>It was very important. A large car was panting against the hedge
just down the road. The lights of the Bunch of Grapes winked at him
enticingly.</p>

<p>"Well, I doan't know," he said. "I doant reckon to&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he found himself being bustled along. He got reluctantly
into the car and the door snapped to. The secretary wound the thing
up and jumped into the front seat, and they were off.</p>

<p>It was barely a mile to Cottersley Park, where the
Pendlebury-Leyfuses lived, and the drive could not have occupied
five minutes, but it gave Ben an opportunity for reflection. It was
a closed car, so he could not converse with the secretary. Having
dismissed the gardening idea, he wondered whether it was anything
to do with his pay. But no, he had only been paid that morning. Had
something been stolen and they were going to accuse him? Perhaps
Mr. P.-L. wanted him to go to Scotland, where he had another large
estate? He had once mentioned the subject. But Ben had no intention
of falling in with any wild ideas like that. Born and bred in
Cambridgeshire, and he meant to die there.</p>

<p>The car swung through the lodge gates, up the avenue of elms,
then took a broad circular sweep and came to a stop by the front
door. It had given him very little time for thinking, but coming up
the drive he remembered that yesterday there had arrived a party of
dark-skinned people, tremendous swells he understood. One was a
kind of emperor of a foreign country. There had been a great to-do.
The Pendlebury-Leyfuses loved to entertain anyone like that. But
still they would be hardly likely to want to see the gardener.
Eating and drinking was more their mark.</p>

<p>He found himself ushered into the oak-panelled library, where a
fire was glowing in the grate. As he crossed the hall he had heard
the hum of conversation and the chink of glass in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>"Everything seems all right," he thought.</p>

<p>In less than two minutes the door opened and Mr. and Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus both entered. They were in evening dress, and he
observed the same air of feverish anxiety about them which had
characterized Mr. Smythe. Mrs. Pendlebury-Leyfus was so agitated
that she shook hands with him, and her husband said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit down, Tilbury."</p>

<p>He darted about the room as though he were looking for
something. Then he came to a halt by the fireplace, and his wife
sank back into an easy chair and sniffed at a bottle of
smelling-salts. She was a large, florid woman, dressed in pink.
Diamonds glittered from unexpected portions of her anatomy. She
kept swaying backwards and forwards, the jewels on her fingers
flashing as she waved the bottle of scent in front of her
heavilv-powdered face.</p>

<p>"You're a painted-up-looking cow!" thought Ben, but out loud he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What might you be wantin' me for, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus stretched his legs wide apart and looked
down at his white waistcoat. Then he coughed and cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"We've had a terrible upset here, Tilbury, and we want you to
help us out of it."</p>

<p>Having said this, he looked at his wife as though for
encouragement. The lady still being occupied with the scent-bottle,
he came boldly to the point. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We want you to dig a grave at once at the bottom of the
vegetable garden."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>It was almost a shout which escaped the head-gardener. Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Pray be calm," he said. "I will explain it all to you. We have
had the honour of a visit from His Highness the Ameer of
Barochistan and his suite. Unfortunately, last night there was a
deplorable&mdash;er&mdash;accident. His Highness comes from a
country which, as you may imagine, has a rather different moral
code to ours. Things are quite different. He is all-powerful, an
autocrat. It appears that last night one of his servants angered
him by some carelessness, and in a misguided moment His Highness
struck the servant with a metal pipe. Unfortunately, the servant
died...do you understand?"</p>

<p>Ben was on his feet, his cloth cap gripped firmly in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Look-ee here, Mr. Leyfus," he proclaimed, in a stentorian
voice, "I'll have nowt to do wi' this. I'm a gardener. I'll do a
honest day's work with any man on the country-side, but you won't
get me assistin' of a lot of black people to murder each
other."</p>

<p>Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus frowned and twirled his small waxed
moustache. Then he spoke like a father addressing a small
child.</p>

<p>"That isn't exactly the position, Tilbury. It's much more
involved than that. You see, in his own country it isn't a crime.
There would be no question of that."</p>

<p>"Murderin' is murderin', wherever it's done!"'</p>

<p>"It was in any case only an accident, a most unfortunate
accident. And the public scandal must not be faced. You can have no
idea what the political results might be. Barochistan is a very
important and powerful State on the borders of India. If His
Highness were to be involved and disgraced in our courts it might
lead to war. Think of this, Tilbury; by doing as you are asked, by
just digging this grave, you may save England from war!"</p>

<p>"Only a little one. It needn't be very deep," said Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus, who spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"I tell 'ee I'll have nowt to do wi' 't. It's most irregler.
It's a case for the police. But if they want to hush it up they
must do their own buryin'. It's not my place. I'm a God-fearin'
man."</p>

<p>"The reason we have called on you is obvious. The dug-up soil of
the vegetable garden is the most suitable and least likely to
attract notice. But if our friends had done it themselves it is
more than probable that you or your assistants would have quickly
discovered it. It is important for you to select a likely spot and
to arrange matters so that none of the gardeners have occasion to
dig anywhere near it in the future. You must cover the spot with
tomato frames or something. If you will do this I will give you
fifty pounds, and raise your salary another fifty pounds a
year."</p>

<p>Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus said this very clearly and deliberately,
and his wife leant forward, flashing her large rings, almost as
though she were about to tear them off her fingers and hand them to
him.</p>

<p>Ben stood there gripping his cap. The horrid little visions of
what could be done with fifty pounds danced before his eyes. But he
managed to thrust them back. He turned round and spat in the fire.
Then he pulled himself up and repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. I'll have nowt to do wi' it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Tilbury," pleaded the lady. "Think of your
country!"'</p>

<p>Ben shrugged his shoulders, and Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus said,
sharply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, then. We must go and report the matter to the
Ameer."</p>

<p>He walked to the door, and the three of them trooped out into
the hall.</p>

<p>It was a vast hall with crowds of doors and recesses and old
furniture. Ben was anxious to find the way out, but a little
uncertain of his sense of direction. He found himself by the open
door of the dining-room, and his host said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Tilbury. Come in."</p>

<p>It was very difficult to avoid doing so. He peered into the
room. A large mahogany table gleamed under the diffused light of
several standard lamps. There were silver bowls of fruit, nuts, and
sweets, decanters of winc, and diminutive glasses filled with some
bright green liquid. The secretary stood fidgeting by the
fireplace. Three dusky gentlemen, one in evening dress, the other
two in turbans and curious coloured wrappings, were seated round
the table sipping their wine and talking in low voices. Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus walked in and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is my gardener I spoke of. He refuses to do
what we ask."</p>

<p>Ben stood just inside the door. The three Orientals stood up and
bowed very solemnly. The one in evening dress immediately whispered
to the other two in some queer lingo. He was apparently the
interpreter. It was easy for Ben to decide which was the Ameer. He
was the biggest of the three. He had a fat, puffy face and a bright
green turban with a star in the centre.</p>

<p>"He looks a disagreeable-lookin' swine," thought Ben. "Just the
sort to murder a servant and then hush it up."</p>

<p>The interpreter was a thin, cadaverous-looking individual. He
rubbed his hands together in a cringing sort of way as he talked to
the Ameer. Then he nodded several times and, leaning with onc hand
on the table, he said, in a smooth, staccato voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Highness say if the man-gardener do his bidding he give him
a lakh of rupees and the order of the Three Flamingos.'</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus. "Do you hear that,
Tilbury? He'll give you a lakh of rupees. A fortune! An absolute
fortune!"</p>

<p>Then he bobbed three times very quickly in the direction of the
Ameer and muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very kind! Very kind indeed, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Ben sturdily shook his head at the room.</p>

<p>"No-a!" he said. "I wo-an't do it."</p>

<p>The interpreter was biting his nails, and whispering again to
the Ameer. Ben turned and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now I'll be gettin' back."</p>

<p>The interpreter exclaimed in a high-pitched Voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait, wait! Let us discuss some more. Will not the man occupy
himself with some little refreshment while we further consider what
may be done?"</p>

<p>Ben thought of the good beer waiting him at the Bunch of Grapes.
The sight of these foreign drinks nauseated him. Besides, who would
trust this crowd? How could he know that the drink was not doped?
Nevertheless, a bright idea occurred to him. He stepped up to the
table and took an apple.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" he said. "I'll munch this along the road."</p>

<p>Then he turned his back on the room and faced Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus standing by the door.</p>

<p>"Im surprised at you, sir," he said. "I thowt I was workin' for
a gen'leman. I'm goin' now, and I'd like to know what's to prevent
me lodging a information about these goin's on to the police?"</p>

<p>He looked at the little beady eyes of his employer, and then
became aware of a strange contraction in them. They were looking
past him. At the same time a voice at his back said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only this!"</p>

<p>He turned sharply. Three paces from him stood the oleaginous Mr.
Smythe, covering him with a horrid glittering little barrel. The
room danced before his eyes. He was conscious of a great confusion
of sounds and feelings. Mrs. Pendlebury-Levfus screamed. The
Orientals were whispering excitedly together. Someone at the back
was talking at the same time. It was some time after the event that
he recollected that during this curious strained confusion the
voice of Mrs. Pendlebury-Leyfus said once quite clearly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do be careful. It's so difficult to get a gardener!"'</p>

<p>The whole thing was now on a different planc. It was one thing
to be a man, to stick up for one's rights, to do what one thought
was honest; but quite another thing to throw away one's life when
there were those others depending on one. The vision of the cottage
flashed before his mind. His wife quietly stitching, Mildred
cutting out a skirt on the floor, the two young ones asleep
upstairs; their rooms, their furniture, the bit of garden, the
sweet air of the fields and lanes, the smell of shag, all the
pleasant associations of a satisfying life. Mr. Smythe was
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you be a great fool, Tilbury. It's got to be done, and
you've got to do it, and moreover you've got to keep it quiet.
You've got the choice of a large fortune and an increase in salary,
or alternatively&mdash;we'll be digging a grave for two!"</p>

<p>After all, he hadn't actually got to murder anyone himself. If
the poor fellow had been done in, well, there it was! Someone had
got to bury him. And, of course, a black man wasn't like a nice
clean Christian. It was an affair all among themselves. All he had
to do was to dig. But what about the servants? He would surely be
detected!</p>

<p>Some of these apprehensions were probably apparent on his face,
for Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus said, quite affably:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, there, Tilbury, that's right! Do not let it worry you.
His Highness and suite occupy the Trianon wing on the ground floor
beyond the conservatory. None of our servants have access to it
while His Highness is there. From the door on the east side you are
immediately among the thick shrubs which lead all the way to the
vegetable garden. The night is fairly dark. I have sent Torkins and
Peel downstairs to prepare the billiard-table. Don't forget to be
careful about the spot you choose, so that you will know how to
cover up your tracks later on. Mr. Smythe and one of His Highness's
representatives will accompany you."</p>

<p>Ben stood dubiously by the door twirling his cap.</p>

<p>"It's a nice thing, I must say!" he grumbled.</p>

<p>The Eastern gentlemen were still talking with great volubility.
At length the interpreter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well. His Eminence Khan Shuan will accompany the
man-gardener."</p>

<p>Ben didn't like it at all, but he walked surlily out into the
hall. Two pocket-torches were produced, and the party started. His
Eminence Khan Shuan and Mr. Smythe tip-toed across the hall, but
the hob-nailed boots of Ben seemed to make a deafening noise on the
marble tiles. They entered the long conservatory, dimly lighted,
and then went silently through the door at the end into a corridor
which was the artery of the Trianon wing. It was very dark there,
and there was a faint perfume of some exotic scent. Ben thought he
heard someone moving in the rooms. His heart beat quickly. He felt
almost friendly towards Mr. Smythe, who walked behind him with a
loaded revolver. He was in any case a white blackguard. But these
dark-skinned swine! They might do anything. He wouldn't trust them
at the end of a yard rope. Good Lord! In one of these rooms was one
of them lying murdered!</p>

<p>They kicked against the door at the end, and slipped the
bolt.</p>

<p>"Now, quiet!" whispered Mr. Smythe, huskily.</p>

<p>That was all that was said. They groped their way along the
shrubs, Ben going first and the secretary close on his heels, the
Oriental silently bringing up the rear. They reached the tool-shed
and Ben got out his spade.</p>

<p>And then a curious itchy feeling came to him. A spade was a very
useful implement. A man could do a lot with a spade. A sudden biff
and down would go the armed brigand. Ben felt capable of coping
with the Oriental alone. But then&mdash;well, in that case he would
probably be a murderer himself! Moreover, Mr. Smythe seemed to have
some prevision of this hidden potentiality. He kept well clear. He
covered Ben with the torch from a distance of six or seven yards; a
comfortable distance to fire, but too far to do really useful
spade-work. Also the Oriental swell had an unfortunate habit of
hovering all over the place. You could never be quite certain where
he was.</p>

<p>Ben selected the spot. It was just beyond the vegetable marrows.
The soil was very loose and there was a great pile of manure handy
with which he would be able to temporarily cover up the effect of
his operations. He marked it out and then began to dig. And he dug,
and dug, and dug! By nature, being a good gardener, he had acquired
the genius of doing everything very slowly, but on this occasion he
dug like a mad-man. He made up his mind that he could not escape
his fate, so he decided to get through it as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>In half an hour he had dug quite a nice grave. Not very deep and
not very trim at the edges, but still a useful, workmanlike job.
The manure would cover up the minor deficiencies. Now and then he
would rest for half a minute and spit on his hands. Mr. Smythe was
hovering restlessly a few yards away, but His Excellency Khan Shuan
remained absolutely inert and impassive, holding a torch to reveal
the gardener's handiwork. When it was finished Ben was perspiring
freely. He mopped his brow and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, that's done, and now I'll be off!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" sharply replied Mr. Smythe. "You must come back, and
we must all report the result. They may require you further."</p>

<p>"I'm danged if I'm goin' to have anythin' to do with the
buryin'," quoth the gardener.</p>

<p>Khan Shuan made gestures with his hands, as though he suspected
Ben's intentions, and was prepared to thwart them. Mr. Smythe
nodded, implying that he had the matter well in hand. He
said:&mdash;-</p>

<p>"That's all right, your Excellency. He'll do what he's
told!"</p>

<p>The little revolver once more came vividly to the fore.</p>

<p>"By gosh!" thought Ben. "You wait till I get you alone, you smug
worm!"</p>

<p>"Leave the spade and go ahead!" ordered the man with the
revolver.</p>

<p>Ben growled and did as he was told.</p>

<p>They groped their way back through the shrubs and regained the
corridor. It seemed darker and more unpleasant than ever. Khan
Shuan made signs to the other two to wait. He then vanished through
one of the doors. Ben thought he heard a sound of low wailing or
chanting. Doubtless some of their ridiculous monkey-tricks
performed in honour of the dead. There was a distinct smell of
incense. Khan Shuan kept them waiting nearly five minutes. At last
he reappeared, and noiselessly lead the way back to the white
quarters. When they regained the main hall there was a sound of
singing. They found the rest of the party in the French
drawing-room. A large gramophone was emitting the vibrato of some
fruity Italian tenor. This was obviously done for the benefit of
the servants. To give an air of normality.</p>

<p>The Ameer was seated in a large gilt chair with his hands
crossed over his protruding front. He was just staring at the
gramophone with no expression on his face at all. The interpreter
was leaning forward nervously playing with his fingers. Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus was standing pompously leaning against the grand
piano like a showman. Mrs. Pendlebury-Leyfus was lying back in an
upholstered chair fanning herself, as though entertaining foreign
potentates were the most usual experience of her life.</p>

<p>"Hm! they're a merry-lookin' bunch!" thought Ben. "Give me the
bar-parlour of the Bunch of Grapes any day in the week!"</p>

<p>They all started as the trio entered the room. Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus walked quickly across and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Don't turn off the gramophone," he said. "Let's talk round the
fire."</p>

<p>The Ameer didn't stir. But the others gathered by the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"It's all ready," said Mr. Smythe.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you had better go and&mdash;put it in, you three,"
replied Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus.</p>

<p>"I'll have nowt to do with buryin'," growled Ben.</p>

<p>No one took any notice of him. The interpreter seemed nervous.
He asked one or two questions in English, and one or two in
"Barochistan," or whatever the language was. Khan Shuan appeared to
be very emphatic about something. They went and reported matters to
the Ameer. The doleful potentate nodded slowly, and after some time
he raised his right hand and whispered in the interpreter's ear.
There was more talk, and then the interpreter returned to the
hearth-rug. He bowed jerkily and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir and Lady, His Highness has spoken, This is a delicate
matter wnich concerns the Ho-Bidyeh Soh-Kranto faith. If you will
kindly permit, we will retire and in quite soon a little while
report the dictates of The Master."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course! Charmed," replied Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus,
bowing.</p>

<p>The Barochistan party retired ceremoniously. When they had gone
the watchful Mr. Smythe hovered by the door. Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus
walked up and down the room with his hands behind his back. Ben,
who was becoming indifferent to this social atmosphere, and
somewhat desperate at the confinement, threw himself negligently
into the large settee facing the fire, and crossed his legs. Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus was in the easy chair at right angles to Ben. He
stared at her, and he noticed that her eyes were fascinated by his
boots. She could not look at anything else. The gramophone was
still screaming forth excerpts from Leoncavallo, and suddenly Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus burst out crying. She dabbed her eyes, and
sniffed. Her husband turned and patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" he said. "What is it, my dear?"</p>

<p>"It's a nice thing you've let us in for," she cried,
hysterically, "asking all these black people here. And then they go
murdering their servants and make all this upset! And we have to
put up with it, and have the gardener's hob-nailed boots in the
drawing-room and all that!"</p>

<p>"But I'd like to know," replied Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus,
irritably, "who it was who insisted on having them asked? When the
introduction came, who sent off the telegram almost at once? Who
sent the announcement about the visit to the <i>Morning
Post</i>?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never wanted them to come!"</p>

<p>"Well, for God's sake don't carry on now. We've got to see it
through. They'll be back soon, and if they see you crying it will
put the lid on it."</p>

<p>"I wish they'd go! The dirty black scum!"</p>

<p>The storm lasted some time, and the lady never took her eyes
from Ben's boots, except to cry. The gardener felt quite convinced
that the presence of his boots annoyed her much more than the
murder of the servant. And he felt pleased about this. He stuck
them out and dangled one insultingly across his knee.</p>

<p>It must have been about twenty minutes before the guests
returned, and when they did it was patent that some important
decision had been arrived at. They all looked more solemn and
ceremonious than ever. Khan Shuan and the interpreter ushered the
Ameer to his former seat, where he sat impassively staring at the
gramophone, which had now left off. They then bowed very low to
him, and then to each other. Khan Shuan took a seat a few yards
away by the side of the Ameer, and the interpreter remained
standing. He again bowed to Mr. and Mrs. Pendlebury-Leyfus, and
crossed his arms. Then, speaking very slowly and distinctly, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Honoured sir and lady, His Highness has consulted with the
inner circle of Fuhan-Shi. It is all now plainly written how in the
circumstances one should act. The servant of His Highness who met
with the regrettable accident was a low menial of the seventh grade
of Kali-Tsor. Nevertheless, he was a true believer and follower of
Soh-Kranto faith. And it is written that none must touch the body
of a disciple of The Master without being himself a follower of one
who has been initiated into the mysteries of the Ho-Bidyeh."</p>

<p>"Quite so! Quite so!" jerked out Mr. Pendlebury-Leyfus. "You
mean that your people must bury him themselves, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the interpreter. "Or only partly so. The
position of His Highness, and of His Eminence Khan Shuan, preclude
them from fulfilling this office. Even I, unworthy as I am, am of
the second grade of a Kali-Tsor. There remains, therefore, among
His Highness's personnel only the serving-man Ku Tan."</p>

<p>"Ah! Oh, yes, quite so! What do you propose to do, then?"</p>

<p>"It wil be necessary to initiate the man-gardener into the
mysteries of the Ho-Bidyeh!"</p>

<p>"No! I'm danged if I do!" roared Ben, and he pushed past the
interpreter and made for the door. "I doan't want to know nothin'
about the blamed mysteries!"</p>

<p>The disgusting Mr. Smythe stood guarding the door, and the sight
of him infuriated Ben beyond endurance.</p>

<p>"You!" he cried out. "You shoot and be blistered!"</p>

<p>He took a step forward to his inevitable destruction, when
suddenly he found himself gripped from behind. He caught sight of a
pair of long black hands clutching his chest. Ben, though not so
young as he once was, put up a sturdy fight.</p>

<p>"They mean to kill me," he thought, and determined that they
should pay the full price for it. His arms, legs, mouth, and bullet
head were all brought into violent play. But they were strong,
these Orientals, and they seemed to know something about this kind
of game. One of them gripped him low round the ankles. Another
whipped a silk handkerchief across his mouth. His arms were locked
in some tricky fashion. He was bound up like a fly in a spider's
web. The struggle was over in three or four minutes. Mrs.
Pendlebury-Leyfus started to scream, and her husband yelled
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't scream, you fool!"</p>

<p>Ben's eyes were also bandaged, but he could hear Mr.
Pendlebury-Leyfus calling out to him, nervously:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tilbury! It's only a matter of form! They won't
hurt you if you do what they tell you!"</p>

<p>He wanted to yell out "Form be blowed!" but the bandage
prevented him from doing anything more than growl. He felt himself
lifted up and carried out of the room. They crossed the hall and
entered the corridor of the Eastern quarter. It seemed a long way,
much farther than when he had walked it just previously.</p>

<p>"They mean to bury me in that grave!" he kept thinking. He did
not struggle. He was husbanding his strength for the last great
fight. Suddenly the procession stopped. Evidently Mr. Smythe was
still there, for he heard the interpreter say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Honoured sir, it will not be necessary for us to further detain
you. The room consecrated for the time being to the Holy Faith may
be entered only by the followers of Soh-Kranto, and those about to
be initiated into the mysteries of the Ho-Bidyeh."</p>

<p>Mr. Smythe muttered something and apparently departed. They went
through another door and Ben heard it snap to behind them. He was
alone&mdash;alone with these heathens and believers in the black
arts. He would have given anything to have retained Mr. Smythe and
his sociable little pistol. Alone in a dark and forbidding world.
If he was to die, might he die quickly and directly. He had heard
terrible stories of these black foreigners&mdash;stories of
tortures and lingering agonies.</p>

<p>He was placed in an upright chair with his hands tied behind. He
heard whispering going on, and very faintly the clang of some queer
musical instrument. His nose, his only fully active organ, was
keenly alive to the penetrating incense. Then hands lightly flicked
his head. He felt his eye-bandage being removed. It came away and
he blinked at the full light. For some seconds he could visualize
nothing, and then suddenly an object directly opposite him took
shape, and he wanted to cry out with horror!</p>

<p>Against the dark window curtain was a low couch, and on it was a
body covered with a white sheet. It was the murdered man! This was
the beginning of their disgusting ceremony! In the corner of the
room was a dark figure playing on some metallic toneless
instrument. The Ameer himself was walking to and fro and making
peculiar passes in the direction of the corpse. Behind him was the
man who had removed his bandage.</p>

<p>Ben felt the veins in his temples swelling. He wanted to shout,
but he felt too nerveless even to struggle. He had no idea how long
he sat there transfixed before the amazing climax came upon him. He
could not detach what was real from what was the tissue of his
imagination. He remained for a long time both before and after the
climax in a state of immovability. The truth did not get through to
him. Was it the heat of the room? The peculiar effect of the
incense? The weird chanting? Or some more malevolent narcotic? But
as he saw it the whole situation become inexplicably metamorphosed.
The corpse suddenly sat up and pushed back the sheet and appearcd
to be a young man in a grey suit and a fresh complexion, who
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, confound it, you chaps! I'm fed up with this!"</p>

<p>And the Ameer behaved in a most peculiar way. His heavy mournful
face suddenly seemed to expand into a broad, fat, jovial grin. And
then he threw back his head and laughed. And the interpreter and
His Eminence Khan Shuan seemed to be punching each other in the
ribs, while the revivified corpse was exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't make such a bally row! They'll hear!" But of course all
this couldn't be true. It was some mad dream. The other thing was
true&mdash;the murdered servant, the mystic rites. It couldn't be
true that the dignified Khan Shuan was digging <i>him</i> in the
ribs and calling him "a priceless old thing!" But it certainly
seemed to be true that someone was unbinding his hands and feet. He
shook himself free, still staring incredibly at his captors. There
was a lot of talk and noise, and his slow-moving brain had not yet
grasped the significance of it. But after a time the interpreter
took a chair and sat on the back of it, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's see, old thing, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Ben Tilbury."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ben, allow me to introduce you to Micky O'Burn from
Jesus."</p>

<p>The Ameer came forward and gripped his hand; and, speaking in a
slight Irish brogue, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ben, ye're a rare old sportsman!"</p>

<p>Khan Shuan was introduced as Tiny Winkleson, the young man in
the grey suit as Monty, and the interpreter announced himsclf as
James Mulberry Trimmingham.</p>

<p>"Now that's all square," he added. "We're sorry to have led you
up the garden in every sense, but you see what it is? We've all
come over from Jesus just to put it across these bally snobs, the
Pendlebury-Leyfuses. They're the talk of the county. But Monty has
got to get away to-night. He's playing in a golf tournament
to-morrow. But as he arrived with us and they probably counted us
we thought the best way to get rid of him was to bury him in the
garden. It will also be a pretty little memento for our host. We've
got to stay on till Monday. There's a bet on that we don't get
detected. Now look here, Ben, have you got anything you can shove
in that grave?"</p>

<p>Ben was still eminently solemn. He still had not had time to
adjust his vision to this violent perspective. He scratched his
chin and thought. At last he said:&mdash; "Why, yes! At the back of
shed just up agin the stone wall afore you comes to the ricks is a
litter of dead rats. Mr. Gateshead put down p'ison o' Toosday. I
been meanin' to bury they."</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed the interpreter, and the Ameer cut in
with:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure, that's foine; and, look here, Ben, you've to take that
extra fifty quid. And if any time this blackguard of an employer
tries to come it over ye, just point over here to the vegetable
garden and whisper 'rats'!"</p>

<p>They all laughed and clapped him on the back, and the young man
named Monty slipped on a dark overcoat and a felt hat.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "come on, Ben, we'll step out together. And you
chaps keep the tom-tom stunt going while we perform the holy rites.
I've just got time to catch the 10.17."</p>

<p>The other three shook Ben's hand, and the Ameer said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You needn't come back, Ben. I'll make your apologies and
explain that we've sent you back to your home under a spell of the
Oke-poke, or something. We'll say ye're a real hot Soh-krantic, and
don't you forget to work the rats for all you're worth."</p>

<p>Ben shook hands solemnly, but after further discussion Khan
Shuan and the interpreter also came as far as the grave and helped
inter the rats, leaving the Ameer in all his glory to play the
tom-tom on a biscuit tin. The task was accomplished in comparative
silence. When it was finished and the pile of manure distributed
over the mound, the conspirators again shook hands with Ben, and he
walked slowly off, making his way out of the park by the east gate.
He trudged slowly along, swinging his long arms. After a time he
took the apple out of his pocket and munched it thoughtfully. He
got into the lane by Purvey's meadow and crossed the high road. The
night was still fine and calm. It was just as he was passing the
copse by the outskirts of Walley's Farm, which as you know is
barely a quarter of a mile from the village church, that he
suddenly stopped and threw the apple-core into the hedge. Then he
slapped his leg, and uttered a low "Haw, haw, haw." Then he
gathered breath and repeated the operation in a louder key. He must
have stood three or four minutes. He was unable to go on. His "Haw,
haw, haws" reached to heaven. A car passing along the high-road
heard it, and someone remarked about "these disgusting
villagers&mdash;always drunk!"</p>

<p>The tears ran down his cheeks and his body shook, and still he
laughed. At length he took a large red handkerchief and cleaned
himself up. He lighted his pipe, and his face again resumed its
solemn repose.</p>

<p>It was exactly 10.35 when he entered the cottage. Mildred had
gone to bed and his wife was just preparing to do so. She
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halloa, Ben, you're a bit late. What's it like out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, middlin'!"</p>

<p>He hung his cloth cap up on the peg behind the door. Then he
walked slowly to the fire and relighted his pipe from a red ember.
His wife sat down and yawned. And Ben sat opposite her, and for
several minutes there was silence. At length, looking along the
bowl of his pipe, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's see, what was you sayin' about them Skinner gals?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>George (story)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The New Magazine</i> (UK), September 1920<br>
<i>The Living Age</i>, September 4 1926</p>

<p>There was something essentially Chinese about the appearance of
George as he lay there propped up against the pillows. His large,
flabby face had an expression of complete detachment. His narrowing
eyes regarded me with a fatalistic repose. Observing him I felt
that nothing mattered, nothing ever had mattered, and nothing ever
would matter. And I was angry. Pale sunlight filtered through the
curtains.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "Still in bed! Do you know it's nearly
twelve o'clock?"</p>

<p>An almost inaudible sigh greeted my explosion. George occupied
the <i>maisonnette</i> below me. Some fool of an uncle had left him
a small private income, and he lived alone, attended by an old
housekeeper. He did nothing, absolutely nothing at all, not even
amuse himself; and whenever I went in to see him he was invariably
in bed. There was nothing wrong with his health. It was sheer
laziness. But not laziness of a negative kind, mark you, but the
outcome of a calm and studied policy. I knew this, and it angered
me the more.</p>

<p>"What would happen if the whole world went on like you?" I
snapped.</p>

<p>He sighed again, and then replied in his thin, mellow
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We should have a series of ideal states. There would be no
wars, no crimes, no divorce, no competition, no greed, envy,
hatred, or malice."</p>

<p>"Yes, and no food."</p>

<p>He turned slightly on one side. His accents became mildly
expostulating&mdash;the philosopher fretted by an ignorant
child.</p>

<p>"How unreasonable you are, dear boy. How unthinking! The secret
of life is complete immobility. The tortoise lives four hundred
years; the fox terrier wears itself out in ten. Wild beasts,
fishes, savages, and stockbrokers fight and struggle and eat each
other up. The only place for a cultivated man is bed. In bed he is
supreme&mdash;the arbiter of his soul. His limbs and the vulgar
carcass of his being constructed for purely material functioning
are concealed. His head rules him. He is the autocrat of the
bolster, the gallant of fine linen, the master of complete
relaxation. Believe me, there are a thousand tender attitudes of
repose unknown to people like you. The four corners of a feather
bed are an inexhaustible field of luxurious adventure. I have spent
more than half my life in bed, and even now I have not explored all
the delectable crannies and comforts that it holds for me."</p>

<p>"No," I sneered. "And in the meantime, other people have to work
to keep you there."</p>

<p>"That is not my fault. A well-ordered state should be a vast
caravansary of dormitories. Ninety-nine per cent of these
activities you laud so extravagantly are gross and unnecessary.
People should be made to stay in bed till they have found out
something worth doing. Who wants telephones, and cinemas, and
safety razors? All that civilization has invented are vulgar
luxuries and time-saving devices. And when they have saved the time
they don't know what to do with it. All that is required is bread,
and wine, and fine linen. I, even I, would not object to getting up
for a few hours every week to help to produce these things."</p>

<p>He stroked the three weeks' growth on his chin, and smiled
magnanimously. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"The world has yet to appreciate the real value of passivity. In
a crude form the working classes have begun to scratch the edge of
the surface. They have discovered the strike. Now, observe that the
strike is the most powerful political weapon of the present day. It
can accomplish nearly everything it requires, and yet it is a
condition of immobility. So you see already that immobility may be
more powerful that activity. But this is only the beginning. When
the nations start going to bed and stopping there, then
civilization will take a leap forward. You can do nothing with a
man in bed&mdash;not even knock him down. My ambition is to form a
league of bedfellows. So that if one day some busybody or group of
busybodies says, 'We're going to war with France, or Germany, or
America,' we can reply, 'Very well. Then I'm going to bed.' Then,
after a time, they would have to go to bed too. And they would
eventually succumb to the gentle caresses of these sheets and
eiderdowns. All their evil intentions would melt away. The world
should be ruled, not by Governments or Soviets, but by national
doss-houses."</p>

<p>He yawned, and I pulled up the blind.</p>

<p>"What about the good activities?" I replied.</p>

<p>For a second I thought I had stumped him, or that he was not
going to deign to reply. Then the thin rumble of his voice reached
me from across the sheets:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What you call the good activities can all be performed in bed..
That is to say, they can be substituted by a good immobility. The
activities of man are essentially predatory. He has learned nothing
and forgotten nothing. He is a hunter and slayer, and nothing else
at all. All his activities are diversions of this instinct.
Commerce is war, capital is a sword, labor is a stomach. Progress
means either filling the stomach, or chopping someone else's head
off with the sword. Science is an instrument that speeds up the
execution. Politics is a game of fan-tan. Colonization is
straightforward daylight robbery."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to waste my morning with a fool," I said. "But
what about art, and beauty, and charity, and love?"</p>

<p>"In bed," he mumbled. "All in bed. They are all of them
spiritual things. Bed is the place for them. Was Keats's 'Ode to a
Nightingale' any finer because he got up and wrote it down, and
sent it to a fool of a publisher? Charity! Give a man a bed, and
charity ceases to have any significance. You have given him a
kingdom. There he may weave beauty and romance. Love! What a fool
you are! Is a bed a less suitable place for love than a County
Council tramcar?"</p>

<p>His voice died away above the coverlet. I was about to deliver a
vitriolic tirade against his ridiculous theories, but I did not
know where to begin, and before I had framed a suitable opening the
sound of gentle snoring reached me.</p>

<p>I record this conversation as faithfully as I can recollect,
because it will help you to share with me the sense of extreme
surprise at certain events which followed, two months later. Of
course, George did occasionally get up. Sometimes he went for a
gentle stroll in the afternoon, and he belonged to a club down town
where he would go and dine in the evening. After dinner he would
watch some of the men play billiards, but he invariably returned to
his bed about ten o'clock. He never played any game himself;
neither did he, apparently, write or receive letters. Occasionally
he read in bed, but he never looked at a newspaper or a magazine.
He once said to me that if you read the newspapers you might as
well play golf; and the tremulous shiver of disgust in his voice
when he uttered the word 'golf' is a thing I shall never
forget.</p>

<p>I ask you, then, to imagine my amazement when, two months later,
George shaved himself, got up to breakfast, reached a City office
at nine o'clock, worked all day, and returned at seven in the
evening. You will no doubt have a shrewd idea of the reason, and
you are right. She was the prettiest little thing you can imagine,
with chestnut hair, and a solemn babyish pucker of the lips. She
was as vital as he was turgid. Her name was Maisie Brand. I don't
know how he met her, but Maisie, in addition to being pretty and in
every way attractive, was a practical modern child. George's two
hundred a year might be sufficient to keep him in bed, but it
wasn't going to be enough to run a household on. Maisie had no use
for this bed theory. She was a daughter of sunshine and fresh air,
and frocks and theatres, and social life. If George was to win her
he must get up in the morning.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after the dramatic change I visited him in his
bedroom. He was like a broken man. He groaned when he recognized
me.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll stop in bed all day to-day?" I remarked
jauntily.</p>

<p>"I've got to get up this afternoon," he growled. "I've got to
take her to a concert."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like work?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's torture. Agony. It's awful. Fortunately, I found a fellow
sufferer. He works next to me. We take it in turns to have
twenty-minute naps, while the other keeps watch."</p>

<p>I laughed, and quoted:</p>

<p>"'Custom lies upon us with a weight, heavy as frost and deep
almost as night.'" Then I added venomously:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't any sympathy for you. It serves you right for
the way you've gone on all these years."</p>

<p>I thought he was asleep again, but at last his drowsy accents
proclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a perfect fool you are! You always follow the line of
least resistance."</p>

<p>I laughed outright at that, and exclaimed, "Well, if ever there
was a case of the pot calling the kettle black!"</p>

<p>There was a long interval, during which I seemed to observe a
slow, cumbrous movement in the bed. Doubtless he was exploring.
When he spoke again there was a faint tinge of animation in his
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not capable, I suppose, of realizing the danger of it
all. You fool! Do you think I follow the line of least resistance
in bed? Do you think I haven't often wanted to get up and do all
these ridiculous things you and your kind indulge in? Can't you see
what might happen? Suppose these dormant temptations were
thoroughly aroused! My heavens! It's awful to contemplate. Habit,
you say? Yes, I know. I know quite well the risk I am running. Am I
to sacrifice all the epic romance of this life between the sheets
for the sordid round of petty actions you call life? I was a fool
to get up that day. I had a premonition of danger when I awoke at
dawn. I said to myself, 'George, restrain yourself. Do not be
deceived by the hollow sunlight. Above all things, keep clear of
the park.' But, like a fool, I betrayed my sacred trust. The
premonitions which come to one in bed are always right. I got up.
And now&mdash;By jove! It's too late!"</p>

<p>Smothered sobs seemed to shake the bed.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if you feel like that about it, if you think
more of your bed than of the girl, I should break it off. She won't
be missing much."</p>

<p>He suddenly sat up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don't you dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he sank back on the pillow, and added
dispassionately:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, you see already the instinct of activity. A weak
attitude. I could crush you more successfully with complete
immobility. But these movements are already beginning. They shake
me at every turn. Nothing is secure."</p>

<p>Inwardly chuckling at his discomfiture, I left him.</p>

<p>During the months that followed I did not have opportunities of
studying George to the extent that I should have liked, as my work
carried me to various parts of the country; but what opportunities
I did have I found sufficiently interesting. He certainly improved
in health. A slight color tinged his cheeks. He seemed less puffy
and turgid. His movements were still slow, but they were more
deliberate than of old. His clothes were neat and brushed. The girl
was delightful. She came up and chatted with me, and we became
great friends. She talked to me quite frankly about George. She
laughed about his passion for bed, but declared she meant to knock
all that sort of thing out of him. She was going to wake him up
thoroughly. She said laughingly that she thought it was perfectly
disgusting the way he had been living. I used to try to visualize
George making love to her, but somehow the picture would never seem
convincing. I do not think it could have been a very passionate
affair. Passion was the last thing you would associate with George.
I used to watch them walking down the street, the girl slim and
vivid, swinging along with broad strides; George, rather flustered
and disturbed, pottering along by her side; like a performing bear
that is being led away from its bun. He did not appear to look at
her, and when she addressed him vivaciously he bent forward his
head and held his large ear close to her face. It was as though he
were timid of her vitality.</p>

<p>At first the spectacle amused me, but after a time it produced
in me another feeling.</p>

<p>"This girl is being thrown away on him. It's horrible. She's
much too good for George." And when I was away I was constantly
thinking of her, and dreading the day of the wedding, praying that
something would happen to prevent it. But, to my deep concern,
nothing did happen to prevent it, and they were duly married in
April.</p>

<p>They went for a short honeymoon to Brittany, and then returned
and occupied George's old <i>maisonnette</i> below me. The day
after their return I had to face a disturbing realization. I was
falling hopelessly in love with Maisie myself. I could not think of
George, or take any interest in him. I was always thinking of her.
Her face haunted me. Her charm and beauty, and the pathos of her
position, gripped me. I made up my mind that the only thing to do
was to go away. I went to Scotland, and on my return took a small
flat in another part of London. I wrote to George and gave him my
address, and wished him all possible luck. I said I hoped 'some
day' to pay them a visit, but if at any time I could be of service
would he let me know?</p>

<p>I cannot describe to you the anguish I experienced during the
following twelve months. I saw nothing of George or Maisie at all,
but the girl was ever present in my thoughts. I could not work. I
lived in a state of feverish restlessness. Time and again I was on
the point of breaking my resolve, but I managed to keep myself in
hand.</p>

<p>It was in the following June that I met Maisie herself, walking
down Regent Street. She looked pale and worried. Dark rings
encircled her eyes. She gave a little gasp when she saw me, and
clutched my hand. I tried to be formal, but she was obviously
laboring under some tense emotion.</p>

<p>"My flat is in Baker Street," I said. "Will you come and visit
me?"</p>

<p>She answered huskily, "Yes, I will come to-morrow afternoon.
Thank you."</p>

<p>She slipped away in the crowd. I spent a sleepless night. What
had happened? Of course, I could see it all. George had gone back
to bed. Having once secured her, his efforts had gradually flagged.
He had probably left his business&mdash;or been sacked&mdash;and
spent the day sleeping. The poor girl was probably living a life of
loneliness and utter poverty. What was I to do? All day long I
paced up and down my flat. I dreaded that she might not come. It
was just after four that the bell rang. I hastened to answer it
myself. It was she. I led her into the sitting-room and tried to be
formal and casual. I made some tea and chatted impersonally about
the weather and the news of the day. She hardly answered me.
Suddenly she buried her face in her hands and broke into tears. I
sprang to her and patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>"There, there!" I said. "What is it? Tell me all about it,
Maisie."</p>

<p>"I can't live with him. I can't live with him any longer," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that my heart gave a violent bump, not
entirely occasioned by contrition. I murmured as sympathetically as
I could, but with prophetic assurance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's gone back to bed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she managed to stammer. "It's not that. It's just the
opposite."</p>

<p>"Just the opposite!"</p>

<p>"He's so restless, so exhausting. Oh, dear! Yes, please, Mr.
Wargrave, give me a cup of tea, and I will tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>For a moment I wondered whether the poor girl's mental balance
had been upset. I poured her out the tea in silence. George
restless! George exhausting! Whatever did she mean? She sipped the
tea meditatively; then she dabbed her beautiful eyes and told me
the following remarkable story.</p>

<p>"It was all right at first, Mr. Wargrave. We were quite happy.
He was still&mdash;you know, very lazy, very sleepy. It all came
about gradually. Every week, however, he seemed to get a little
more active and vital. He began to sleep shorter hours and work
longer. He liked to be entertained in the evening or to go to a
theatre. On Sundays he would go for quite long walks. It went on
like that for months. Then they raised his position in the firm. He
seemed to open out. It was as though during all those years he had
spent in bed he had been hoarding up remarkable stores of energy.
And suddenly some demon of restlessness got possession of him. He
began to work frenziedly. At first he was pleasant to me; then he
became so busy he completely ignored me. At the end of six months
they made him manager of a big engineering works at Waltham Green.
One of the directors, a Mr. Sturge, said to me one day, 'This
husband of yours is a remarkable man. He is the most forceful
person we have ever employed. What has he been doing all these
years? Why haven't we heard of him before?' He would get up at six
in the morning, have a cold bath, and study for two hours before he
went off to work. He would work all day like a fury. They say he
was a perfect slave-driver in the works. Only last week he sacked a
man for taking a nap five minutes over his lunch hour. He would get
home about eight o'clock, have a hurried dinner, and then insist on
going to the opera or playing bridge. When we got back he would
read till two or three in the morning. Oh, Mr. Wargrave, he has got
worse and worse. He never sleeps at all. He terrifies me. On Sunday
it is just the same. He works all the morning. After lunch he
motors out to North wood and plays eighteen holes before tea and
eighteen after."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "Golf!"</p>

<p>"Golf, and science, and organization are his manias. They say
he's invented some wonderful labor-saving appliances on the plant,
and he's planning all kinds of future activities. The business of
the firm is increasing enormously. They pay him well, but he still
persists in living in that <i>maisonnette</i>. He says he's too
busy to move."</p>

<p>"Is he cruel to you?"</p>

<p>"If complete indifference and neglect is cruelty, he is most
certainly cruel. Sometimes he gives me a most curious look, as
though he hated me and yet he can't account for me! He allows me no
intimacy of any sort. If I plead with him he doesn't answer. I
believe he holds me responsible for all these dormant powers which
have got loose and which he cannot now control. I do not think his
work gives him any satisfaction. It is as though he were driven on
by some blind force. Oh, Mr. Wargrave, I can't go on. It is killing
me. I must run away and leave him."</p>

<p>"Maisie," I murmured, and I took her hand.</p>

<p>The immediate subsequent proceedings are not perhaps entirely
necessary to record in relating this story, which is essentially
George's story. The story of Maisie and myself could comfortably
fill a stout volume, but as it concerns two quite unremarkable
people, who were just human and workaday, I do not expect that you
would be interested to read it. In any case, we have no intention
of writing it, so do not be alarmed.</p>

<p>I can only tell you that during that year of her surprising
married life Maisie had thought of me not a little, and this
denouement rapidly brought things to a head. After this confession
we used to meet every day. We went for rambles, and picnics, and to
matinees; and, of course, that kind of thing cannot go on
indefinitely. We both detested the idea of an intrigue. And
eventually we decided that we would cut the Gordian knot and make a
full confession. Maisie left him and went to live with a married
sister.</p>

<p>That same morning I called on George. I arrived at the
<i>maisonnette</i> just before six o'clock, as I knew that that was
the most likely time to catch him. Without any preliminary ceremony
I made my way into the familiar bedroom. George was in bed. I stood
by the door and called out to him loudly: "George!"</p>

<p>Like a flash he was out of bed and standing in his pyjamas;
facing me. He had changed considerably. His face was lined and old,
but his eyes blazed with a fury of activity. He awed me. I
stammered out my confession.</p>

<p>"George, I'm awfully sorry, old chap. I have a confession to
make to you. It comes in the first place from Maisie. She has
decided that she cannot live with you any longer. She thinks you
have neglected her and treated her badly. She refuses to come back
to you under any circumstances. Indeed, she&mdash;she and
I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>I tailed off dismally, and looked at him. For a moment I thought
he was going to bear down on me. I know that if he had I should
have been supine. I should have stood there and let him slaughter
me. I felt completely overpowered by the force of his personality.
I believe I shivered. He hovered by the edge of the bed, then he
turned and looked out of the window. He stood there solemnly for
nearly a minute, then he emitted a profound sigh. Without more ado
he got back into bed. There was an immense upheaval of the sheets.
He seemed to be burrowing down into some vast and as yet unexplored
cave of comfort. He rolled and heaved, and at length became inert.
I stood there, waiting for my answer. Sparrows twittered outside on
the window box. I don't know how long I waited. I felt that I could
not go until he had spoken.</p>

<p>At length his voice came. It seemed to reach me across dim
centuries of memory, an old, tired, cosy, enormously contented,
sleep-encrusted voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'S 'll right," said the voice. "Tell Mrs. Chase she needn't
bring up my shaving water this morning."</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>London Discovers Uncle Abe
(article)</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Century Magazine</i>, February 1920</p>

<p>London has taken over the spirit of Abraham Lincoln and now
shares its influence with the United States. Historians, poets, and
dramatists write of the great American. All London, and soon all
England, will he happier and wiser in knowing about "the great
heart of humanity."</p>

<p>An event is happening in London which every American ought to
know of. It may not in itself appear to be of great importance, but
on reflection it becomes a matter of pregnant significance. In an
obscure suburb, buried away among shops and booths, is a small
theater with the somewhat grandiloquent title of the Lyric Opera
House. A year or so ago not one Londoner in ten thousand could have
told you where the Lyric Opera House was. Then one day some
enthusiasts from Birmingham, with a passion for reforming the
stage, came to London. Finding themselves crowded out of all the
West End theaters, where revues and pyjama farces were in complete
sway, they came across this obscure theater and put on a play. It
was a purely experimental play, the kind of thing that any
theatrical expert would have prophesied as being good for a few
matinees, or probably a week's run at a loss. The play concerned
the life of an American. It is true, it was a great&mdash;probably
the greatest American who ever lived. But that was all it was. It
could not be called a good play in any sense. It certainly had none
of the ingredients of a popular success. There was no plot, no
sensational development, very little humor, and, strangest of all,
no love interest. It just portrayed the character, and some of the
human episodes in the political career, of a rugged man.</p>

<p>But the Londoner, who is slow in the uptake, but persistent when
he wants a thing, gradually began to trace his footsteps, as though
compelled by some mesmeric force, in the direction of the Lyric
Opera House. To say that the play caught on would be too mild a way
of expressing the peculiar grip which the life of Abraham Lincoln
has got upon us. London has fallen under the spell of "Uncle Abe."
The thing has been an enormous popular success. It has been going
on months, and still every performance is crowded out. Only last
week a bishop drove up. He had come to town specially from the
country to see the play, and he could not get a seat! Now everybody
knows the Lyric Opera House and is anxious to direct you thither.
But it isn't only the box-office which interests us. The play has
been more than a popular success. It has been a symbol, an
inspiration.</p>

<p>The people who crowd the theater are not a clique of literary or
theatrical dilettante; they are the people. You see them sitting
there in rows,&mdash;the seats are all low-priced,&mdash;mixed up
and familiar, princes and publicans, bankers, bishops (I hope he
got a seat the next night), clerks and green-grocers, horsy-looking
men and poets, little shop girls and old duchesses. They are
peculiarly silent, thrilled, moved. If you ask them, they can't
tell you why, but they say, "It's wonderful," and they go away and
come again and again.</p>

<p>How much of this wonder may be due to the genius of Mr. John
Drinkwater, who wrote the play and produced it, or to the clever
company who interpret it, is difficult to determine. I have spoken
to hundreds of people who have been, and many have criticized the
acting or the producing or the play itself; but I have not met one
who did not think that somehow it was "wonderful" and they wanted
to go again. The solution may be that in the mind of Abraham
Lincoln we find a salve, healing the complicated disruption of our
own present troubles. The conditions are somewhat analogous. We
observe the reactions of our own distresses through this spectacle
of great simplicity. It is as though we had been groping in the
dark for something which we had lost, when a friend appears who
produces an electric torch, and we observe that that which we had
lost is lying at our feet. We recall the phenomena of our own
upheaval, the basic causes of war and civil strife. The greed and
intolerance of those in high places, the insincerity and chop-logic
of politicians, the sycophantic attitude of place-seekers, the
machinations of profiteers, the fear and cowardice and heroism of
the individual man, and through it all this one simple man, of
inflexible purpose, high courage, broad vision, and unbounded
humanity. His horror and loathing of war permeate the play. He is
incapable of bitterness and hatred. He can hate only an idea. He
represents to us what is best in us, the attitude we ourselves
would like to take in our best moments. When the dear old society
lady rejoices in the slaughter of many thousands of "these
disgusting rebels,"&mdash;we can almost hear her say "disgusting
Huns,"&mdash;the heart of Lincoln is as nearly stirred to hate as
it is capable of. He turns on her in a flood of scorn and orders
her from the house. That was not the spirit in which he plunged his
country into war. Men were dying that a broader humanity might
emerge. The colored man should be free, the brother of the white
man, not the slave. All men were equal in the sight of God, and all
men must obey the dictates of this human impulse. Let justice be
done though the heavens fall, but justice with mercy, and with your
eye always fixed upon the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>It was an American who toasted "Our country. In her intercourse
with foreign nations may she always be in the right; but our
country, right or wrong."</p>

<p>But Lincoln was bigger than that. And it is because we believe
that he was bigger than that that we rejoice in him. We do not
believe that he would have backed his country in what he believed
to be an unjust war. He would have been a rebel. He would rather
have died at the stake. One sees in him the birth of a force acting
socially rather than nationally. That is why in these days when
national issues are involved and confused, when they who, we are
told by our governments, are one day our friends and another day
our enemies, we turn to Lincoln as we would turn to a draft of
water at a surfeited banquet in an overheated room. And there dawns
upon us at the Lyric Opera House a new and comforting
generalization. It is this: there could never be serious trouble
between England and America, because the day is dawning when things
are acting socially rather than nationally. The workers of the
world are becoming as great a force as governments themselves,
indeed greater. It will no longer be possible to wave a flag, put
head-lines in the newspapers, and send a band into the street and
say, "We are at war!" Government is going to be by the people and
for the people. There might conceivably be some quite serious point
of dispute between the governments, but the people will require to
know all about it. And then there will be a national cleavage.
Parties will be formed on each side favoring the other country's
point of view. There will be no national unity in the old sense.
The world&mdash;or in any case, for the time being, <i>our</i>
world&mdash;will act socially.</p>

<p>That which is called "industrial unrest" is not a purely
material thing. It does not concern only work and wages. It is a
spiritual revolt. Five million men were slain on the battle-fields
of Europe, and nine tenths of those men were sent to their deaths
without being consulted or without fully understanding the
fundamental cause of the strife. And this holocaust has made the
people of these various countries suspicious. They are for the most
part patient, long-suffering people, good sportsmen, quite willing
to die in a good cause; but they are beginning to feel that if this
sort of thing is going to happen often, they would like to know all
about it. Indeed, they would like to be consulted. Incidentally,
they want to make it impossible to happen again.</p>

<p>The London cockney made as good showing in the war as any, and
he was in it from the very first. He is not very clever perhaps,
but he's no fool. He does'nt believe all the newspapers tell him.
The war has broadened his outlook considerably. He has rubbed
shoulders with every other national, white and colored, in all
parts of the world. Whereas before he may not have traveled farther
than from Putney to the Welsh Harp, or from Hendon to Brighton, now
he is familiar with France and Italy, Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia,
and India. He has boxed with Australians, made love to French
girls, and swapped cigarettes with German prisoners. Death has been
his near and familiar companion for four and a half years. And on
the top of it all he is thoroughly surfeited with <i>cant</i>.
These newspapers and old ladies and arm-chair patriots, phew!
Suddenly he finds himself listening to some one he understands, a
big and simple citizen like himself, albeit a foreigner. A fine old
boy, "Uncle Abe." No nonsense about him. He doesn't get tied up in
a knot with highfalutin rhetoric. He hasn't got one eye on the
enemy and the other on the next general election. He doesn't say
one thing and mean another. He's big, universal, and his spirit is
communicable.</p>

<p>This is what the cockney thinks, the cockney who has seen the
world and carried other men's burdens upon his back. And his
spirit, too, is communicable. That is why the dowager duchesses go,
too, and the war exploiters and the old clubmen and the arm-chair
patriots. They go and feel humbled, universal, as though their
spirit were being transposed from the minor key of their small
self-centered lives into a broader key of a great composition. They
cannot remain unmoved, and so, while they cannot explain it, they
say it's "wonderful."</p>

<p>Yes, London has fallen to "Uncle Abe." The curtain has come down
on the great drama, and our voices are hushed. We know that it is
too soon for its significance to come home to us. We are still
dazed and bewildered. The eager faces of the young men who will
never return are still with us. The sound of their laughter is
still fresh in our ears. In such a condition men cannot think or
forget or even remember. It will take a hundred years. And so they
dance and dance and dance, as though they were trying to readjust
the normal rhythm of human intercourse, so long a broken discord.
And when everything seems meaningless, what better occupation can
there be than dancing? In time the systole and the diastole will
resume its healthy beat. Beneath the hatred and malice and
misunderstanding we are learning to know that, as Nurse C a veil
discovered, "Patriotism is not enough." Beneath it all there
remains the great heart of humanity, the great heart of Lincoln,
beating for our eternal good. London is wiser and better and vastly
happier for her discovery of "Uncle Abe."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Heart-Whole</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Strand Magazine</i>, March 1922</p>

<p>It may be said of Isobel Bloom that in her Garden of Eden apples
were not sufficient. She demanded nectarines, pomegranates,
hot-house grapes, even crystallized fruit in boxes, tied up with
pink ribbons. She was that kind of woman, if you know what I mean.
You must not infer from this that she was a weak woman, easily
captive to the bow and spear of the most highly favoured hunter. It
is only that she was discriminating, critical, elusive,
paradoxical, ablative, passionate, romance-ridden, film-soaked,
shrewd, precocious, and devastating. To some people a wall is a
wall, and a glass of water a glass of water; but to Isobel this was
not, and never would be, the case. Her beauty had come with too
great a rush and too unexpectedly to allow her time to bow
acknowledgments to apparent phenomena. She had been a plain child
with thin legs, irregular features, and a too small nose. But at
the age of eighteen something suddenly seemed to happen. The legs
filled out and became extremely graceful. The features balanced
themselves. Then you saw that the nose wasn't a bit too small.
Nature had been preparing for this all the time. Her father, who
was the son of a man who had made a large fortune out of
lawn-mowers, said to his wife one evening, just after they had
returned from a six months' jaunt in Egypt:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Have you noticed Isobel?"</p>

<p>And his wife said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about her, darling?"</p>

<p>"She's suddenly turned into an extraordinarily beautiful
girl."</p>

<p>No harm in this. Fond parents indulge in these infra-familiar
platitudes; but Isobel had overheard the remark, and she rushed
upstaits to her bedroom and looked in the mirror. From that day
onwards a wall no longer became a wall or a glass of water a glass
of water to her. To make my meaning clearer, it may be as well to
labour this point a little. Everything is relative. When we say
that a wall is a wall we have to allow the fact that a wall is
something different to everyone. To one man it may be a prison, to
another a protection, to a third an eyesore; to a builder it's a
job, to a cat an ecstasy. To one man it will appeal as a commercial
proposition; to another as a romantic episode stirring the memory
of ancient architecture. Its symmetry will jag the nerves of some,
its irregularity offend the senses of another. On the other hand, a
dreamer may gaze into a three-walled garden for the best part of
his life, and the fact that it has three walls may make no
impression on his consciousness at all. Indeed, a wall, like any
other material thing, can be lived down, overlooked, or
ignored.</p>

<p>Human beings in a highly vitalized state are always unconscious
of any matter not immediately concerned with the frenzy which holds
them. For instance, a great actor declaiming a soliloquy from
"Hamlet" is entirely ignorant of the progress of his internal
digestive functioning; neither is his mind the least bit affected
by the physical processes going on in the electric light globes in
the footlights upon which his eyes may be fixed. Consequently
Isobel Bloom, abruptly transcended by the dazzling radiance of her
own beauty, and by its obvious effect upon her fellow-creatures,
saw things no longer in terms of actuality. She did not become
exactly vain. One cannot call vain a magnificent panther posing in
the sun, or an apple-tree in full bloom. Besides, her days were far
too crowded for vanity. It is only the idle who are vain.
Breathless romance began with the first twitter of the starlings on
her window-sill at dawn, and did not by any means end when she laid
her beautiful head on her pillow at night. Indeed, her dreams were
a very busy time. They were invariably concerned with daring
episodes of knight-errantry. She lived in the Middle Ages with a
large Daimler and frocks from Paris. She had so much to give, and
what she had was of such value that the utmost risks and sacrifices
must be demanded. Moreover, the weather must keep fine for it.</p>

<p>By the time she was twenty she had had seventeen proposals of
marriage, including two offer of an elopement with her father's
chauffeur. It was this that made her discriminating and critical.
Not that she did not admire Jules, the Belgian chauffeur, and
consider him a romantic figure, but that, at his second and more
urgent appeal for elopement, she had become painfully aware that he
had been eating garlic. With her shrewd sense she realized that
this discovery might not have been manifest till too late!</p>

<p>The curate never made any deep impression. He was of the
sporting parson breed, who had founded a boxing club in the
village. He actually made his third proposal to her with his left
eye discoloured by the effect of a pretty forearm jab from Beal,
the blacksmith. She was convinced that he came to her to be
mothered.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Abadam was middle-aged and enormously rich. He told
her the full story of his life. How he had been to school and to a
commercial college. How, when a child, a nurse had left him out in
a pram in the rain; so that to this day he was liable to fierce
attacks of cramp in the stomach; how he had in the end inherited a
sardine-canning factory from an uncle, and what an enormous success
he had made of it. How she, Isobel, was the first woman he had ever
loved&mdash;in quite the way he loved her. Whatever meagre chances
of success his courtship might have had were completely destroyed
by his abrupt refusal to dive into the artificial lake one chilly
September evening to rescue her fan. The implied cruelty of the
request to a man subject to attacks of cramp in the stomach never
impressed her; neither did his avowed willingness to "buy her ten
thousand fans to-morrow" have the slightest effect. He had missed
his chance.</p>

<p>Her other suitors included a lord, an Austrian pianist, an oil
magnate, an under-gardener, two medical students, a bone-setter,
and a sanitary engineer. But all these men, although having many
noble qualities, still lacked in some essential. And so at the age
of twenty-one we find her (see adjectives in opening paragraph)
unmarried, a little embittered, and with old age tapping at the
door.</p>

<p>You may aver that the particular nectarine, hothouse aspect of
Isobel would never have developed had it not been that her
grandfather had made a fortune out of lawn-mowers, and you are to a
certain extent right. A person to whom there is no difference
between a thousand pounds and three-halfpence is less liable to
appreciate the fact that a door is a door, and a glass of water a
glass of water, than the unhappy individual to whom three-halfpence
is a solid proposition, and a thousand pounds a fantastic
dream.</p>

<p>But this is not exactly Isobel's fault. She was an only child.
Her father was hypnotized by the discovery of her beauty. He used
to peep at her furtively out of the bathroom window, when she was
in the garden, and mutter: "Well, I'm hanged." He then regarded his
roly-poly figure in the mirror, twirled his little sandy moustache,
and added: "The age of miracles! The age of miracles!" This shows
the amazing egoism of man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bloom also regarded her daughter with astonishment, but the
revelation only brought her a kind of cosy sense of pleasure. With
laboured scrutiny she discovered the basis of all Isobel's
perfections in her own mirror. "Nature is wonderful," she thought;
but there was no darn miracle about it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that from the day on which
her parents returned from their trip down the Nile (during the
course of which Mr. Bloom had lost one hundred and sixty pounds at
bridge, and his wife had made twe hundred and twenty), they both
melted to Isobel. They subsided into a background. They became
merely a united fount of adulation and material supplies. In the
great scheme of her life they ceased to count, except as the
sleepers on the main line count to the Scotch Express. They made no
attempt to control, influence, or even annotate the procession of
suitors who began to form. As Mr. Bloom very wisely said: "She will
do as she likes."</p>

<p>But when her twenty-second birthday approached, and Isobel still
remained unmarried and unpledged, Mr. and Mrs. Bloom began to get
alarmed, and in halting phrases Mr. Bloom recounted to her the old
fable about the woman who went to collect faggots in a wood. When
he had finished Isobel pointed out to him that he had a smut on the
white slip of his waistcoat, and that the best people said
"faggot," not "faggit." She had not been listening to him. Her mind
was too occupied with the details of a crisis in her romantic
development. She was in love. For the first time she was in love,
and with the ill-luck which she was convinced had come to dog her
destiny for ever, she was in love with two men.</p>

<p>The realization had come to her in a flash that morning as she
was feeding the peacocks. What was she to do? Their names were
Jeremiah Jermy and Augustus Smallrage, and in order to develop
Isobel's story properly, it may be necessary to recount something
about these two men.</p>

<p>They were great friends, both wealthy, and both young. Jeremiah
Jermy was a tall, fair, aesthetic young man. He had been an officer
in the Stiffs, but had resigned his commission owing to a
difference with the colonel with regard to the right sauce to serve
with grey mullet. He was amiable and kind, could imitate the noise
of a steam saw or a lift, did very clever tricks with string and
matches, had a remarkable collection of cigar-bands, and was always
Cambridge in the Boat Race. The latter was a startling
characteristic, as he was up at Oxford for four years, and had
never even visited Cambridge.</p>

<p>Augustus Smallrage, on the other hand, was dark, rather stocky,
and essentially a sportsman. He had killed specimens of nearly
every living creature except man. (The exception, of course, does
not include coloured men or gamekeepers.) He played polo, squash
rackets, fives, badminton, billboard, pelota, and
beggar-my-neighbour. He was rather a silent man, but as a gymnast
he was unique. He would do the grand circle on the bough of an elm
tree in Mr. Bloom's park. He would walk the full length of the
terrace five times on his hands. Indeed, the attitude of being
upside down appeared to be as natural to him as an upright one. One
of his favourite methods of courting Isobel was to balance himself
on his head on the balustrade of the terrace outside her window.
Sometimes in the early morning she would peep out and behold him
balanced there with his legs wide apart and his eyes fixed
supplicatingly on her window.</p>

<p>She was enormously impressed. She liked to persuade herself that
he had been there all night, but the thought of the amount of blood
that must have rushed to his head disturbed her, and she would lean
out of the window and say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, so much."</p>

<p>Then he would spin round half-a-dozen times, come down, and go
in to breakfast. Jeremiah had no accomplishment so moving as that,
but he had other endearing qualities. His string and match tricks
denoted an intellectuality and imagination in which perhaps
Augustus was a trifle lacking. Isobel had wavered between these two
for the best part of a year, and that morning she realized that a
definite crisis had arisen. She could be happy with either.</p>

<p>We have said that she was disturbed. This is true, but the
disturbance was not entirely an unpleasant one. The capacity for
loving two men is rare, and it fitted well with her rich and
compendious nature. The romantic possibilities were not to be
frittered away. And so it came about that one day in June she sent
for them both. She chose the Pompeian room in her father's house on
Chelsea Embankment for the venue, and she wore a gown of
whortleberry crpe-de-Chine trimmed with a silk trimming the colour
of elephant's breath. When they had assembled, she walked
majestically to the window and pointed to the river and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look! the river flowing towards the open sea!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jeremiah. "That's right&mdash;the Thames."</p>

<p>Then she turned, and addressed them in these periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Augustus, Jeremiah, it's no good pretending. You know and I
know. The truth has got to be faced."</p>

<p>They both faced it.</p>

<p>"You have both sworn you love me, and that you wish to marry me.
Is that true?"</p>

<p>"It is true," they replied, hoarsely, and went down on their
knees.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; are you prepared to venture something for my
sake?"</p>

<p>"We are."</p>

<p>"Good! Then I have prepared a test, a simple, painless,
interesting test, and I am prepared to stand by the result."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>They looked up at her in a frenzy of anxiety.</p>

<p>"It is simple&mdash;very, very simple. You shall make a girdle
round the earth, starting from this room to-day. One shall go east,
and the other west. I will remain here. Whoever gets back to me
first, I will marry. Are you willing?"</p>

<p>"We are."</p>

<p>"Let us, then, draw lots as to who shall go West and who shall
go East."</p>

<p>She took two sheets of embossed note-paper, and on one she wrote
"West," and then she folded them up.</p>

<p>"But you haven't written on the other," said Augustus.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Jeremiah. "If one is West, the other
<i>must</i> be East."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Augustus, who was white to the lips.</p>

<p>Neither of the others replied to his inept remark, and Isobel
placed the two papers in a hat and shook them up. Then she turned
to Augustus and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shall draw in alphabetical order.
Augustus&mdash;first."</p>

<p>Augustus snatched the paper and opened it. He appeared
stupefied.</p>

<p>"I've drawn a blank," he said.</p>

<p>"That means you go East," replied Isobel.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I have drawn West!" exclaimed Jeremiah, who felt that
he was already triumphing over his opponent by a greater show of
intelligence. Isobel walked gracefully across the room and seated
herself in a chair of ebony and gold.</p>

<p>"I shall remain heart-whole," she said, dramatically. "I shall
wait here for you, for the first of you gentlemen who returns. You,
Augustus, go East. You understand, you may take any route you like,
use any conveyance you like, employ any means you like, but you
must make a complete circle round the earth. You, Jeremiah, will go
West. The same rules apply to you. My thoughts will be with you
both in whatever part of the world you are, and whatever adventures
befall you. Now go!"</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and shook hands. Then they
knelt for the last time before Isobel, and kissed her hand in turn.
When it came to the moment of departure, the advantage which
Jeremiah appeared to have gained by his more prehensile grip of the
details of the difficult problem Isobel had set them was, to an
extent, negatived by the action of Augustus. It seemed, indeed, as
though Augustus wished to show his contempt for purely theoretical
adventures and to establish the fact that he, in any case, was a
man of action. No sooner had he kissed the tips of Isobel's
'fingers than he leapt to the window and opened it. Without a
moment's hesitation he mounted the sill and slid down the
water-pipe, eventually alighting on the top of his car, which was
waiting below. Before Jeremiah had smoothed the nap of his silk hat
in the hall Augustus was half a mile on his way. Each man carried
away with him the vision of Isobel seated on her black-and-gold
throne, watching through the window for his return. Both were
convinced that thus she would remain until that fateful day.</p>

<p>But we must first of all deal with the actions of Jeremiah. When
he had brushed his silk hat he stepped slowly and thoughtfully out
into the sunshine. He was by no means eager or inspired by the
scheme. In the first place, he was an exceptionally bad sailor, and
to-morrow perhaps he would be on the broad Atlantic. As if this
were not sufficient, he was condemned to cross the Pacific, the
Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, every unfriendly sea that was ever
invented. He saw, moreover, that all the advantages would be with
Augustus, who was a good sailor and a flying man. He might quite
conceivably fly round the earth and be back in about a fortnight.
He visualized himself having an extremely uncomfortable and boring
time scrambling round the earth, and then on arriving back
discovering that Isobel had been on her honeymoon for some weeks.
Confound women! Why couldn't they be more sensible and simple?</p>

<p>And for Jeremiah there was another little fly in the ointment.
During the previous week he had met a girl in a tobacconist's shop.
Of course, she was nothing like Isobel, not so beautiful or
bewitching, but still&mdash;there she was, and for some mysterious
reason she haunted Jeremiah. She was a lovable, simple little thing
named Mary Cash. She was in any case&mdash;coupled with the thought
of unfriendly seas&mdash;sufficient to make Jeremiah hesitate as he
stood outside Isobel's house and blinked up at the sun. He was
about to amble off in the direction of Sloane Square, when he heard
his name called. For a few moments he could not determine whence
the call came, and then, looking up, he beheld Isobel leaning out
of the window. She beckoned to him to return.</p>

<p>"Um!" thought Jeremiah. "She is doing this to delay me. She
favours Augustus."</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and what might have proved the determining
five minutes in the great race was frittered away in the usual
formalities of entering the house and returning to the Pompeian
room. When at length he found himself alone with Isobel he was
conscious that a change had come over her. She held out her hands
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jerry, I have changed my mind. Directly Augustus disappeared
down the water-pipe I realized that it was you I loved."</p>

<p>Jeremiah gasped.</p>

<p>"But the race! The race round the earth!"</p>

<p>"Do not go, Jerry. I do not wish you to go. Let Augustus go by
himself, and before he returns we shall be married."</p>

<p>Jeremiah stared at her, and stared out of the window. His mind
for the fraction of a second fluttered to the girl in the
tobacconist's shop, but in the actual presence of Isobel no other
woman's memory could remain very vivid. He looked down at his
boots, and muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you think perhaps it seems just a teeny-weeny bit
unfair?"</p>

<p>"All's fair in love and war!" exclaimed Isobel, and then, after
a pause, added: "Besides, we can always say you got back
first."</p>

<p>Jeremiah could not see how this made it any less unfair, but the
ways of women are strange. He pictured Augustus already, perhaps,
half way to Hendon to pick up a Handley-Page. He thought of him
dashing round the earth, perhaps getting killed or dying from fever
in some remote land. Perhaps, after terrible privations, returning
to England and finding that the other two had been married all the
time. It did seem a little cruel, cruel and unnecessary. Why not
send him a wire?&mdash;"Race off Isobel favours me." But, on the
other hand, where was Augustus? It did not at all follow he had
gone to Hendon or even to Paris. He might try and get on the
Trans-Siberian Railway. Augustus was capable of anything. His
meditations on this theme were interrupted by Isobel, who threw her
arms round his neck and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you understand? It is you I love, Jerry?"</p>

<p>That put the semicolon on his fears and apprehensions; he took
her in his arms and behaved exactly as though he had won the race
round the earth.</p>

<p>"We will wait," said Isobel, when she could get her breath,
"till Augustus has got to Africa or China, or wherever it is he
passes through, and then we will get married quietly in Paris."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jeremiah. "That would be a nice, quiet,
inconspicuous spot."</p>

<p><br>
Neither of them had any idea as to how long it would take to get
round the earth, and at length Jeremiah called at Cook's in
Piccadilly and made inquiries. He found that with luck and by
taking express trains and specials, and perhaps flying a bit,
Augustus might accomplish it in five weeks, but it would more
probably be seven or eight. The conspirators decided to get married
in three weeks' time, and to return to Chelsea at the end of the
fifth weck, and Jeremiah was to pretend that he had just arrived.
Through a private detective agency Jeremiah, feeling rather
sheepish and guilty, tried to find out which way Augustus had gone,
but from the moment his car had vanished round the corner of Tite
Street they could find no trace of him at all, beyond the fact that
he had called at his bankers, and obtained a letter of credit for a
large sum.</p>

<p>This is almost a propaganda story. In any case, it has a deep
and far-reaching moral, demonstrating the fact that villainy always
reacts on itself, that treachery never goes unpunished, and that in
the end goodness and honour are worth while, and that beauty has no
call to hold itself superior to homely virtues. The plot hatched in
that diabolical manner by Isobel, and supported half-heartedly by
Jeremiah, was doomed from its very inception.</p>

<p>They got married secretly at a notary's office in St. Malo and
went to Dinard for their honeymoon. The marriage was a hopeless
failure. The trouble began because Jeremiah was always thinking
about the girl in the tobacconist's shop. Isobel, on the other
hand, got thoroughly bored with Jeremiah and with his interminable
string and match tricks. On the second evening he had exhausted his
repertoire of tricks and began all over again. Neither did the
imitations of a steam saw or a lift rouse her spirits aftef the
tenth repetition.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she thought. "All through life I am condemned
to listen to that wretched saw and lift and to watch the twiddlings
of those ridiculous pieces of string."</p>

<p>And, Jeremiah on his part, when watching Isobel powder her nose,
thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder how Mary Cash is. How simple and sweet she looked when
she handed me down that box of Golden Dawn navy-cut."</p>

<p>And he sighed. Neither of them mentioned Augustus, and yet he
occupied their thoughts in very divergent ways. They had been at
Dinard a week, and they were sitting one evening outside a
<i>caf</i>, listening to the band. They had not spoken for an
hour. At last Jeremiah took out a box of matches and began to break
off the ends. With an impatient gesture Isobel swept the box off
the table.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Not again. I can't stand it."</p>

<p>Jeremiah picked up the broken matches (matches are very
expensive in France) and put them back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said. "I realize that you don't love me any
more, Isobel."</p>

<p>She leant across the table and pressed his hand.</p>

<p>"It is more than that," she answered. "I realize that I never
have loved you. I was wrong. It is Augustus I love. It came to me
in a flash this morning when you were shaving. I'm not angry with
you, Jerry; it's not your fault. You have good qualities&mdash;your
imitation of the saw is amazing&mdash;but, as a man, you do not
come up to my ideal."</p>

<p>"No," he replied, hoarsely. "It is best, then, that we
part."</p>

<p>Wealth and influence can accomplish many things. Even the law
can be jostled and jogged by the fortunate individual with the deep
purse. Their divorce was rushed through at breathless speed. Isobel
had her reasons for this.</p>

<p>On the last day of the fifth week Isobel was once again seated
in the Pompeian room on Chelsea Embankment, awaiting the return of
Augustus. As for Jeremiah, within a month of his release he had
married the girl from the tobacconist's shop, and they went out to
the Hampstead Garden Suburb, and were never heard of again.</p>

<p><br>
But to return to Isobel...there she waited. To her annoyance,
Augustus did not appear. She went to bed at last, but left a purple
shaded lamp burning and the window open. (She knew Augustus would
come that way.) Also she set an old family retainer to watch, with
instructions to call her immediately the head of Augustus appeared
above the sill. But the night passed, and the following day, and
the next night, and the whole week, two weeks, three weeks.</p>

<p>Twelve weeks had passed since Augustus set out to circumnavigate
the earth, and on the last night of the twelfth week, Isobel looked
up at the star-lit sky and said to herself:</p>

<p>"This is a wash-out. He has been drowned or killed. To-morrow I
shall go back to pa and ma, and then I shall take the veil. Yes, I
shall go into a nunnery in some vine-clad corner of Italy, away
from the cruel world. Perhaps I had better wait till after Henley,
and perhaps Newmarket, but go I assuredly will."</p>

<p>She sighed and thought of a new arrangement of a frock that
would be just suitable for the river. She was about to put out the
light and retire, when suddenly she heard her name called. She
glanced at the window. It was he.</p>

<p>Augustus clambered through and went down upon his knees.</p>

<p>"I am too late," he said.</p>

<p>Isobel sank back in her chair and closed her eyes. The moment
was too exquisite to hurry. Her cavalier! The Middle Ages became a
back number. She muttered, soulfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Augustus!"</p>

<p>She then realized that he was wet through, and that his clothes
were all in rags. He looked at her sheepishly and
repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am too late! Alas!"</p>

<p>"Then she said in her deep, quiet voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. You are the first."</p>

<p>"What!" almost yelled Augustus.</p>

<p>"You are the first. Jeremiah has not yet returned."</p>

<p>"I am the first! I am the first! Jeremiah has not yet
returned!"</p>

<p>Augustus appeared to be beside himself, but he made no attempt
to advance towards her. He continued to kneel there, looking
incredibly nonplussed. Poor fellow! She must try to help him. His
privations had probably affected his brain, never the sturdiest
portion of his anatomy.</p>

<p>"You are wet, Augustus."</p>

<p>"Yes. I was shipwrecked."</p>

<p>"How awful! And you came straight to me without changing your
clothes!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but too late! Even then&mdash;too late!"</p>

<p>"No, you don't seem to understand, Augustus. Jeremiah has not
returned. I have been waiting here for you&mdash;heart-whole!"</p>

<p>Augustus shook himself like a dog, and the water splashed all
over the beautiful Pompeian carpet. At last he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. I cannot take advantage of my oldest friend. Perhaps
he&mdash;perhaps he missed his train somewhere. I have been too
lucky. Everything went right&mdash;trains, steamers, buses,
aeroplanes, everything. No, I cannot do it, Chrystabel."</p>

<p>"My name is Isobel. Have you forgotten; Augustus? Tell me the
story of your wanderings. Come, kneel beside me."</p>

<p>"No, I am too, wet, too&mdash;unworthy. I was shipwrecked,
nearly eaten by sharks, lost in a jungle in Africa, captured by
brigands. It has been awful, but it was quicker than I expected.
Poor old Jerry! Poor old Jerry! Where is he? My greatest friend.
And perhaps through me we have sent him to destruction."</p>

<p>"All's fair in love and war," murmured Isobel, aptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, it isn't. Neither in love nor in war. There's a
limit. Certain things aren't done, don't you know."</p>

<p>"It was a fair race. I don't understand you, Augustus. Did we
not all agree? Come, you are distraught. Let me get you a change of
clothes from the butler, and then warm yourself at the fire, and
have a hot meal. The race is to the swift, the battle to the
strong."</p>

<p>"But he could have got round the earth in a rowing boat in three
months."</p>

<p>Isobel came down from her throne and held out her arms.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might have, Augustus, dear. You are strong. It is
strength I love. Come."</p>

<p>"No, no, Pm not strong. I'm as weak as the deuce. I'm unworthy
of you. I'm a worm. I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;off!"</p>

<p>And before Isobel had had time to anticipate his action he had
leapt to the window and was sliding down the water-pipe.</p>

<p>"Home!" he yelled to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The drive to Kensington Gardens only occupied ten minutes.
Augustus let himself in and ran upstairs. He opened a bedroom door.
A pretty, fair-haired woman was sitting up in bed, reading an
illustrated paper. For the sake of the propriety of this journal,
let me hasten to add that she was his wife.</p>

<p>"Gee! whats up?" she exclaimed. "You look scared!"'</p>

<p>"He hadn't got back!"</p>

<p>"What! You mean to say that the other guy hadn't got round the
world in three months?"</p>

<p>"No. Phew! It was an experience! I had the greatest difficulty
to get away. She swallowed it all about the shipwreck and the
brigands."</p>

<p>The girl in the bed doubled up with laughter.</p>

<p>"I know what it was. I guess the other feller didn't remain
heart-whole either."</p>

<p>All of which requires a certain amount of explanation.</p>

<p><br>
It is necessary to go back to the first departure of Augustus. To
describe it briefly it is only necessary to say that he left the
house in Chelsea in such a fever of anxiety to race round the earth
that he did not devote sufficient thought to the essential details
of the competition. He found that there was a big liner leaving for
New Yotk that night, and he caught it by the skin of his teeth. He
had been three days at sea before he realized that <i>he was going
round the world the wrong way</i>! It probably all came about
through their giving him a blank, instead of a paper on which it
was definitely stated that he had to go East.</p>

<p>The realization staggered him. It was too late. There was no
means of leaving the ship. They would not reach New York for a
week. Assuming he caught a boat back at once, this would give
Jeremiah a fortnight's start. Augustus was desolate, and one
evening he confessed the whole story to Maisie Denver, the daughter
of an American dentist. Her sympathy and homely charm were an
enormous help to him. In two days' time he began to look at her,
and then he realized that she, indeed, was the woman of his
destiny. She set him no difficult problem to do. She just loved him
quietly and effectively. She was certainly very impressed by some
of his feats, but she did not demand them of him. For instance,
when he stood on his head on the deck rail, she clapped her hands,
and exclaimed to her father:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My! Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>As her father was a portly old gentleman in the early sixties,
you must understand that the remark was not issued as a challenge,
but only as a term of approbation. They got married in New York,
and Augustus was bewildered with happiness. At the same time the
affair of the competition worried him. Jeremiah was his greatest
friend. One had to play the game. Some things aren't done, don't
you know. It was Maisie's suggestion that was ultimately
adopted&mdash;a harmless compromise. To return too late, when the
other fellow had had plenty of time to get round the earth twice.
It was also her idea about the shipwreck and the brigands. Women
are thorough. No wonder she laughed in bed.</p>

<p>And so to-day you find both Jeremiah and Augustus happily
married, and a long life of usefulness and entertainment stretched
out before them.</p>

<p><br>
But what of Isobel? Alas! She is now rapidly approaching her
twenty-fourth year, and remains a lonely woman. Thus do we see how
our evil actions come back on us. She had bought all her outfit for
the nunnery, but decided eventually to wait another season&mdash;or
two. She was last seen lunching at the Carlton with a bishop. The
bishop was drinking port, and Isobel was helping herself to a
nectarine. Our aunt, who was seated at the next table, and has
astonishingly good hearing, said that there was nothing Biblical
about the remarks that the bishop was making to her. She had
cherry-brandy with her coffee, and was wearing a frock that no
"really nice woman" would wish to wear in the daytime, nor even in
the evening. And so, oh! sisters of Isobel, beware! Nemesis lurks
in the stones of these exotic fruits. We all have our Garden of
Eden. Let me implore you, as you wander thither&mdash;be content
with the homely apple, lest in due course you find yourself in
similar case to that of Isobel Bloom.</p>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>The Perfect Murder</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>The Strand Magazine</i> Oct 1926</p>

<p>One evening in November two brothers were seated in a little
caf in the Rue de la Roquette discussing murders. The evening
papers lay in front of them, and they all contained a lurid account
of a shocking affair in the Landes district, where a
charcoal-burner had killed his wife and two children with a
hatchet. From discussing this murder in particular they went on to
discussing murder in general.</p>

<p>'I've never yet read a murder case without being impressed by
the extraordinary clumsiness of it,' remarked Paul, the younger
brother. 'Here's this fellow murders his victims with his own
hatchet, leaves his hat behind in the shed, and arrives at a
village hard by with blood on his boots.'</p>

<p>'They lose their heads,' said Henri, the elder. 'In cases like
that they are mentally unbalanced, hardly responsible for their
actions.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Paul, 'but what impresses me is&mdash;what a lot
of murders must be done by people who take trouble, who leave not a
trace behind.'</p>

<p>Henri shrugged his shoulders. 'I shouldn't think it was so easy,
old boy; there's always something that crops up.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! I'll guarantee there are thousands done every year.
If you are living with anyone, for instance, it must be the easiest
thing in the world to murder them.'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'Oh, some kind of accident&mdash;and then you go screaming into
the street, "Oh, my poor wife! Help!" You burst into tears, and
everyone consoles you. I read of a woman somewhere who murdered her
husband by leaving the window near the bed open at night when he
was suffering from pneumonia. Who's going to suspect a case like
that? Instead of that, people must always select revolvers, or
knives, or go and buy poison at the chemist's across the way.'</p>

<p>'It sounds as though you were contemplating a murder yourself,'
laughed Henri.</p>

<p>'Well, you never know,' answered Paul; 'circumstances might
arise when a murder would be the only way out of a difficulty. If
ever my time comes I shall take a lot of trouble about it. I
promise you I shall leave no trace behind.'</p>

<p>As Henri glanced at his brother making this remark he was struck
by the fact that there was indeed nothing irreconcilable between
the idea of a murder and the idea of Paul doing it. He was a big,
saturnine-looking gentleman with a sallow, dissolute face, framed
in a black square beard and swathes of untidy grey hair. His
profession was that of a traveller in cheap jewellery, and his
business dealings were not always of the straightest. Henri
shuddered. With his own puny physique, bad health, and vacillating
will, he was always dominated by his younger brother. He himself
was a clerk in a drapery store, and he had a wife and three
children. Paul was unmarried.</p>

<p>The brothers saw a good deal of each other, and were very
intimate. But the word friendship would be an extravagant term to
apply to their relationship. They were both always hard up, and
they borrowed money from each other when every other source
failed.</p>

<p>They had no other relatives except a very old uncle and aunt who
lived at Chantilly. This uncle and aunt, whose name was
Taillandier, were fairly well off, but they would have little to do
with the two nephews. They were occasionally invited there to
dinner, but neither Paul nor Henri ever succeeded in extracting a
franc out of Uncle Robert. He was a very religious man,
hard-fisted, cantankerous, and intolerant. His wife was a little
more pliable. She was in effect an eccentric. She had spasms of
generosity, during which periods both the brothers had at times
managed to get money out of her. But these were rare occasions.
Moreover, the old man kept her so short of cash that she found it
difficult to help her nephews even if she desired to.</p>

<p>As stated, the discussion between the two brothers occurred in
November. It was presumably forgotten by both of them immediately
afterwards. And indeed there is no reason to believe that it would
ever have recurred, except for certain events which followed the
sudden death of Uncle Robert in the February of the following
year.</p>

<p>In the meantime the affairs of both Paul and Henri had gone
disastrously. Paul had been detected in a dishonest transaction
over a paste trinket, and had just been released from a period of
imprisonment. The knowledge of this had not reached his uncle
before his death. Henri's wife had had another baby, and had been
very ill. He was more in debt than ever.</p>

<p>The news of the uncle's death came as a gleam of hope in the
darkness of despair. What kind of will had he left? Knowing their
uncle, each was convinced that, however it was framed, there was
likely to be little or nothing for them. However, the old villain
might have left them a thousand or two. And in any case, if the
money was all left to the wife, here was a possible field of
plunder. It need hardly be said that they repaired with all haste
to the funeral, and even with greater alacrity to the lawyer's
reading of the will.</p>

<p>The will contained surprises both encouraging and discouraging.
In the first place the old man left a considerably larger fortune
than anyone could have anticipated. In the second place all the
money and securities were carefully tied up, and placed under the
control of trustees. There were large bequests to religious
charities, whilst the residue was held in trust for his wife. But
so far as the brothers were concerned the surprise came at the end.
On her death this residue was still to be held in trust, but a
portion of the interest was to be divided between Henri and Paul,
and on their death to go to the Church. The old man had recognised
a certain call of the blood after all!</p>

<p>They both behaved with tact and discretion at the funeral, and
were extremely sympathetic and solicitous towards Aunt Rosalie, who
was too absorbed with her own trouble to take much notice of them.
It was only when it came to the reading of the will that their
avidity and interest outraged perhaps the strict canons of good
taste. It was Paul who managed to get it clear from the notary what
the exact amount would probably be. Making allowances for
fluctuations, accidents, and acts of God, on the death of Mme
Taillandier the two brothers would inherit something between eight
and ten thousand francs a year each. She was now eighty-two and
very frail.</p>

<p>The brothers celebrated the good news with a carouse up in
Montmartre. Naturally their chief topic of conversation was how
long the old bird would keep on her perch. In any case, it could
not be many years. With any luck it might be only a few weeks. The
fortune seemed blinding. It would mean comfort and security to the
end of their days. The rejoicings were mixed with recriminations
against the old man for his stinginess. Why couldn't he have left
them a lump sum down now? Why did he want to waste all this good
gold on the Church? Why all this trustee business?</p>

<p>There was little they could do but await developments. Except
that in the meantime&mdash;after a decent interval&mdash;they might
try and touch the old lady for a bit. They parted, and the next day
set about their business in cheerier spirits.</p>

<p>For a time they were extremely tactful. They made formal calls
on Aunt Rosalie, inquiring after her health, and offering their
services in any capacity whatsoever. But at the end of a month
Henri called hurriedly one morning, and after the usual professions
of solicitude asked his aunt if she could possibly lend him one
hundred and twenty francs to pay the doctor who had attended his
wife and baby. She lent him forty, grumbling at his foolishness at
having children he could not afford to keep. A week later came Paul
with a story about being robbed by a client. He wanted a hundred.
She lent him ten.</p>

<p>When these appeals had been repeated three or four times, and
received similar treatment&mdash;and sometimes no treatment at
all&mdash;the old lady began to get annoyed. She was becoming more
and more eccentric. She now had a companion, an angular,
middle-aged woman named Mme Chavanne, who appeared like a
protecting goddess. Sometimes when the brothers called Mme Chavanne
would say that Mme Taillandier was too unwell to see anyone. If
this news had been true it would have been good news indeed, but
the brothers suspected that it was all prearranged. Two years went
by, and they both began to despair.</p>

<p>'She may live to a hundred,' said Paul.</p>

<p>'We shall die of old age first,' grumbled Henri.</p>

<p>It was difficult to borrow money on the strength of the will. In
the first place their friends were more of the borrowing than the
lending class. And anyone who had a little was suspicious of the
story, and wanted all kinds of securities. It was Paul who first
thought of going to an insurance company to try to raise money on
the reversionary interest. They did succeed in the end in getting
an insurance company to advance them two thousand francs each, but
the negotiations took five months to complete, and by the time they
had insured their lives, paid the lawyer's fees and paid for the
various deeds and stamps, and signed some thirty or forty forms,
each man only received a little over a thousand francs, which was
quickly lost in paying accrued debts and squandering the remainder.
Their hopes were raised by the dismissal of Mme Chavanne, only to
be lowered again by the arrival of an even more aggressive
companion. The companions came and went with startling rapidity.
None of them could stand for any time the old lady's eccentricity
and ill-temper. The whole of the staff was always being changed.
The only one who remained loyal all through was the portly cook,
Ernestine. Even this may have been due to the fact that she never
came in touch with her mistress. She was an excellent cook, and she
never moved from the kitchen. Moreover, the cooking required by Mme
Taillandier was of the simplest nature, and she seldom entertained.
And she hardly ever left her apartment. Any complaints that were
made were made through the housekeeper, and the complaints and
their retaliations became mellowed in the process; for Ernestine
also had a temper of her own.</p>

<p>Nearly another year passed before what appeared to Paul to be a
mild stroke of good fortune came his way. Things had been going
from bad to worse. Neither of the brothers was in a position to
lend a sou to the other. Henri's family was becoming a greater
drag, and people were not buying Paul's trinkets.</p>

<p>One day, during an interview with his aunt&mdash;he had been
trying to borrow more money&mdash;he fainted in her presence. It is
difficult to know what it was about this act which affected the old
lady, but she ordered him to be put to bed in one of the rooms of
the villa. Possibly she jumped to the conclusion that he had
fainted from lack of food&mdash;which was not true&mdash;Paul never
went without food and drink&mdash;and she suddenly realised that
after all he was her husband's sister's son. He must certainly have
looked pathetic, this white-faced man, well past middle age, and
broken in life. Whatever it was, she showed a broad streak of
compassion for him. She ordered her servants to look after him, and
to allow him to remain until she countermanded the order.</p>

<p>Paul, who had certainly felt faint, but quickly seized the
occasion to make it as dramatic as possible, saw in this an
opportunity to wheedle his way into his aunt's favours. His
behaviour was exemplary. The next morning, looking very white and
shaky, he visited her, and asked her to allow him to go, as he had
no idea of abusing her hospitality. If he had taken up the opposite
attitude she would probably have turned him out, but because he
suggested going she ordered him to stop. During the daytime he went
about his dubious business, but he continued to return there at
night to sleep, and to enjoy a good dinner cooked by the admirable
Ernestine. He was in clover.</p>

<p>Henri was naturally envious when he heard of his brother's good
fortune. And Paul was fearful that Henri would spoil the whole game
by going and throwing a fit himself in the presence of the aunt.
But this, of course, would have been too obvious and foolish for
even Henri to consider seriously. And he racked his brains for some
means of inveigling the old lady. Every plan he put forth, however,
Paul sat upon. He was quite comfortable himself, and he didn't see
the point of his brother butting in.</p>

<p>'Besides,' he said, 'she may turn me out any day. Then you can
have your shot.'</p>

<p>They quarrelled about this, and did not see each other for some
time. One would have thought that Henri's appeal to Mme Taillandier
would have been stronger than Paul's. He was a struggling
individual, with a wife and four children. Paul was a notorious
ne'er-do-well, and he had no attachments. Nevertheless the old lady
continued to support Paul. Perhaps it was because he was a big man,
and she liked big men. Her husband had been a man of fine physique.
Henri was puny, and she despised him. She had never had children of
her own, and she disliked children. She was always upbraiding Henri
and his wife for their fecundity. Any attempt to pander to her
emotions through the sentiment of childhood failed. She would not
have the children in her house. And any small acts of charity which
she bestowed upon them seemed to be done more with the idea of
giving her an opportunity to inflict her sarcasm and venom upon
them than out of kindness of heart.</p>

<p>In Paul, on the other hand, she seemed to find something
slightly attractive. She sometimes sent for him, and he, all
agog&mdash;expecting to get his notice to quit&mdash;would be
agreeably surprised to find that, on the contrary, she had some
little commission she wished him to execute. And you may rest
assured that he never failed to make a few francs out of all these
occasions. The notice to quit did not come. It may be&mdash;poor
deluded woman!&mdash;that she regarded him as some kind of
protection. He was in any case the only 'man' who slept under her
roof.</p>

<p>At first she seldom spoke to him, but as time went on she would
sometimes send for him to relieve her loneliness. Nothing could
have been more ingratiating than Paul's manners in these
circumstances. He talked expansively about politics, knowing
beforehand his aunt's views, and just what she would like him to
say. Her eyesight was very bad, and he would read her the news of
the day, and tell her what was happening in Paris. He humoured her
every whim. He was astute enough to see that it would be foolish
and dangerous to attempt to borrow money for the moment. He was
biding his time, and trying to think out the most profitable plan
of campaign. There was no immediate hurry. His bed was comfortable,
and Ernestine's cooking was excellent.</p>

<p>In another year's time he had established himself as quite one
of the permanent household. He was consulted about the servants,
and the doctors, and the management of the house, everything except
the control of money, which was jealously guarded by a firm of
lawyers. Many a time he would curse his uncle's foresight. The old
man's spirit seemed to be hovering in the dim recesses of the
over-crowded rooms, mocking him. For the old lady, eccentric and
foolish in many ways, kept a strict check upon her dividends. It
was her absorbing interest in life, that and an old grey perroquet,
which she treated like a child. Its name was Anna, and it used to
walk up and down her table at meal-times and feed off her own
plate. Finding himself so firmly entrenched, Paul's assurance
gradually increased. He began to treat his aunt as an equal, and
sometimes even to contradict her, and she did not seem to resent
it.</p>

<p>In the meantime Henri was eating his heart out with jealousy and
sullen rage. The whole thing was unfair. He occasionally saw Paul,
who boasted openly of his strong position in the Taillandier
household, and he would not believe that Paul was not getting money
out of the old lady as well as board and lodging. With no
additional expenses Paul was better dressed than he used to be, and
he looked fatter and better in health. All&mdash;or nearly
all&mdash;of Henri's appeals, although pitched in a most pathetic
key, were rebuffed. He felt a bitter hatred against his aunt, his
brother, and life in general. If only she would die! What was the
good of life to a woman at eighty-five or six? And there was
he&mdash;four young children, clamouring for food, and clothes, and
the ordinary decent comforts. And there was Paul, idling his days
away at cafs and his nights at cabarets&mdash;nothing to do, and
no responsibilities.</p>

<p>Meeting Paul one day he said:</p>

<p>'I say, old boy, couldn't you spring me a hundred francs? I
haven't the money to pay my rent next week.'</p>

<p>'She gives me nothing,' replied Paul.</p>

<p>Henri did not believe this, but it would be undiplomatic to
quarrel. He said:</p>

<p>'Aren't there&mdash;isn't there some little thing lying about
the villa you could slip in your pocket? We could sell it, see? Go
shares. I'm desperately pushed.'</p>

<p>Paul looked down his nose. Name of a pig! Did Henri think he had
never thought of that? Many and many a time the temptation had come
to him. But no; every few months people came from the lawyer's
office, and the inventory of the whole household was checked. The
servants could not be suspected. They were not selected without
irreproachable characters. If he were suspected&mdash;well, all
kinds of unpleasant things might crop up. Oh, no, he was too well
off where he was. The game was to lie in wait. The old lady simply
must die soon. She had even been complaining of her chest that
morning. She was always playing with the perroquet. Somehow this
bird got on Paul's nerves. He wanted to wring its neck. He imitated
the way she would say: 'There's a pretty lady! Oh, my sweet!
Another nice grape for my little one. There's a pretty lady!' He
told Henri all about this, and the elder brother went on his way
with a grunt that only conveyed doubt and suspicion.</p>

<p>In view of this position it seemed strange that in the end it
was Paul who was directly responsible for the dnouement in the
Taillandier household. His success went to his rather weak head
like wine. He began to swagger and bluster and abuse his aunt's
hospitality. And, curiously enough, the more he advanced the
further she withdrew. The eccentric old lady seemed to be losing
her powers of resistance so far as he was concerned. And he began
to borrow small sums of money from her, and, as she acquiesced so
readily, to increase his demands. He let his travelling business
go, and sometimes he would get lost for days at a time. He would
spend his time at the races, and drinking with doubtful
acquaintances in obscure cafs. Sometimes he won, but in the
majority of cases he lost. He ran up bills and got into debt. By
cajoling small sums out of his aunt he kept his debtors at bay for
nearly nine months.</p>

<p>But one evening he came to see Henri in a great state of
distress. His face, which had taken on a healthier glow when he
first went to live with his aunt, had become puffy and livid. His
eyes were bloodshot.</p>

<p>'Old boy,' he said, 'I'm at my wits' end. I've got to find seven
thousand francs by the twenty-first of the month, or they're going
to foreclose. How do you stand? I'll pay you back.'</p>

<p>To try to borrow money from Henri was like appealing to the
desert for a cooling draught. He also had to find money by the
twenty-first, and he was overdrawn at the bank. They exchanged
confidences, and in their mutual distress they felt sorry for each
other and for themselves. It was a November evening, and the rain
was driving along the boulevards in fitful gusts. After trudging a
long way they turned into a little caf in the Rue de la Roquette,
and sat down and ordered two cognacs. The caf was almost deserted.
A few men in mackintoshes were scattered around reading the evening
papers. They sat at a marble table in the corner and tried to think
of ways and means. But after a time a silence fell between them.
There seemed nothing more to suggest. They could hear the rain
beating on the skylight. An old man four tables away was poring
over La Patrie.</p>

<p>Suddenly Henri looked furtively around the room and clutched his
brother's arm.</p>

<p>'Paul!' he whispered.</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'Do you remember&mdash;it has all come back to
me&mdash;suddenly&mdash;one night, a night something like
this&mdash;it must be five or six years ago&mdash;we were seated
here in this same caf&mdash;do you remember?'</p>

<p>'No. I don't remember. What was it?'</p>

<p>'It was the night of that murder in the Landes district. We got
talking about&mdash;don't you remember?'</p>

<p>Paul scratched his temple and sipped the cognac. Henri leant
closer to him.</p>

<p>'You said&mdash;you said that if you lived with anyone, it was
the easiest thing in the world to murder them. An accident, you
know. And you go screaming into the street&mdash;'</p>

<p>Paul started, and stared at his brother, who continued:</p>

<p>'You said that if ever you&mdash;you had to do it, you would
guarantee that you would take every trouble. You wouldn't leave a
trace behind.'</p>

<p>Paul was acting. He pretended to half remember, to half
understand. But his eyes narrowed. Imbecile! Hadn't he been through
it all in imagination a hundred times? Hadn't he already been
planning and scheming an act for which his brother would reap half
the benefit? Nevertheless he was staggered. He never imagined that
the suggestion would come from Henri. He was secretly relieved. If
Henri was to receive half the benefit, let him also share half the
responsibilities. The risk in any case would be wholly his. He
grinned enigmatically, and they put their heads together. And so in
that dim corner of the caf was planned the perfect murder.</p>

<p>Coming up against the actual proposition, Paul had long since
realised that the affair was not so easy of accomplishment as he
had so airily suggested. For the thing must be done without
violence, without clues, without trace. Such ideas as leaving the
window open at night were out of the question, as the companion
slept in the same room. Moreover, the old lady was quite capable of
getting out of bed and shutting it herself if she felt a draught.
Some kind of accident? Yes, but what? Suppose she slipped and broke
her neck when Paul was in the room. It would be altogether too
suspicious. Besides, she would probably only partially break her
neck. She would regain sufficient consciousness to tell. To drown
her in her bath? The door was always locked or the companion
hovering around.</p>

<p>'You've always got to remember,' whispered Paul, 'if any
suspicion falls on me, there's the motive. There's a strong motive
why I should&mdash;it's got to be absolutely untraceable. I don't
care if some people do suspect afterwards&mdash;when we've got the
money.'</p>

<p>'What about her food?'</p>

<p>'The food is cooked by Ernestine, and the companion serves it.
Besides, suppose I got a chance to tamper with the food, how am I
going to get hold of&mdash;you know?'</p>

<p>'Weed-killer?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I should be in a pretty position if they traced the fact
that I had bought weed-killer. You might buy some and let me have a
little on the quiet.'</p>

<p>Henri turned pale. 'No, no; the motive applies to me too. They'd
get us both.'</p>

<p>When the two pleasant gentlemen parted at midnight their plans
were still very immature, but they arranged to meet the following
evening. It was the thirteenth of the month. To save the situation
the deed must be accomplished within eight days. Of course they
wouldn't get the money at once, but, knowing the circumstances,
creditors would be willing to wait. When they met the following
evening in the Caf des Sentiers, Paul appeared flushed and
excited, and Henri was pale and on edge. He hadn't slept. He wanted
to wash the whole thing out.</p>

<p>'And sell up your home, I suppose?' sneered Paul. 'Listen, my
little cabbage. I've got it. Don't distress yourself. You proposed
this last night. I've been thinking about it and watching for
months. Ernestine is a good cook, and very methodical. Oh, very
methodical! She does everything every day in the same way exactly
to schedule. My apartment is on the same floor, so I am able to
appreciate her punctuality and exactness. The old woman eats
sparingly and according to routine. One night she has fish. The
next night she has a souffl made with two eggs. Fish, souffl,
fish, souffl, regular as the beat of a clock. Now listen. After
lunch every day Ernestine washes up the plates and pans. After that
she prepares roughly the evening meal. If it is a fish night, she
prepares the fish ready to pop into the pan. If it is a souffl
night, she beats up two eggs and puts them ready in a basin. Having
done that, she changes her frock, powders her nose, and goes over
to the convent to see her sister who is working there. She is away
an hour and a half. She returns punctually at four o'clock. You
could set your watch by her movements.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It is difficult to insert what I propose in fish, but I don't
see any difficulty in dropping it into two beaten-up eggs, and
giving an extra twist to the egg-whisk, or whatever they call
it.'</p>

<p>Henri's face was quite grey.</p>

<p>'But&mdash;but&mdash;Paul, how are you going to get hold of
the&mdash;poison?'</p>

<p>'Who said anything about poison?'</p>

<p>'Well, but what?'</p>

<p>'That's where you come in.'</p>

<p>'I!'</p>

<p>'Yes, you're in it too, aren't you? You get half the spoils,
don't you? Why shouldn't you&mdash;some time to-morrow when your
wife's out&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Just grind up a piece of glass.'</p>

<p>'Glass!'</p>

<p>'Yes, you've heard of glass, haven't you? An ordinary piece of
broken wineglass will do. Grind it up as fine as a powder, the
finer the better, the finer the more&mdash;effective.'</p>

<p>Henri gasped. No, no, he couldn't do this thing. Very well,
then; if he was such a coward Paul would have to do it himself. And
perhaps when the time came Henri would also be too frightened to
draw his dividends. Perhaps he would like to make them over to his
dear brother Paul? Come, it was only a little thing to do. Eight
days to the twenty-first. To-morrow, fish day, but Wednesday would
be souffl. So easy, so untraceable, so safe.</p>

<p>'But you,' whined Henri, 'they will suspect you.'</p>

<p>'Even if they do they can prove nothing. But in order to avoid
this unpleasantness I propose to leave home soon after breakfast. I
shall return at a quarter-past three, letting myself in through the
stable yard. The stables, as you know, are not used. There is no
one else on that floor. Ernestine is upstairs. She only comes down
to answer the front-door bell. I shall be in and out of the house
within five minutes, and I shan't return till late at night, when
perhaps&mdash;I may be too late to render assistance.'</p>

<p>Henri was terribly agitated. On one hand was&mdash;just murder,
a thing he had never connected himself with in his life. On the
other hand was comfort for himself and his family, an experience he
had given up hoping for. It was in any case not exactly murder on
his part. It was Paul's murder. At the same time, knowing all about
it, being an accessory before the fact, it would seem contemptible
to a degree to put the whole onus on Paul. Grinding up a piece of
glass was such a little thing. It couldn't possibly incriminate
him. Nobody could ever prove that he'd done it. But it was a
terrible step to take.</p>

<p>'Have another cognac, my little cabbage.'</p>

<p>It was Paul's voice that jerked him back to actuality. He said:
'All right, yes, yes,' but whether this referred to the cognac or
to the act of grinding up a piece of glass he hardly knew
himself.</p>

<p>From that moment to twenty-four hours later, when he handed over
a white packet to his brother across the same table at the Caf des
Sentiers, Henri seemed to be in a nightmarish dream. He had no
recollection of how he had passed the time. He seemed to pass from
that last cognac to this one, and the interval was a blank.</p>

<p>'Fish to-day, souffl to-morrow,' he heard Paul chuckling.
'Brother, you have done your work well.'</p>

<p>When Paul went he wanted to call after him to come back, but he
was frightened of the sound of his own voice. He was terribly
frightened. He went to bed very late and could not sleep. The next
morning he awoke with a headache, and he got his wife to telegraph
to the office to say that he was too ill to come. He lay in bed all
day, visualising over and over and over again the possible events
of the evening.</p>

<p>Paul would be caught. Someone would catch him actually putting
the powder into the eggs. He would be arrested. Paul would give him
away. Why did Paul say it was so easy to murder anyone if you lived
with them? It wasn't easy at all. The whole thing was chock-a-block
with dangers and pitfalls. Pitfalls! At half-past three he started
up in bed. He had a vision of himself and Paul being guillotined
side by side! He must stop it at any cost. He began to get up. Then
he realised that it was already too late. The deed had been done.
Paul had said that he would be in and out of the house within five
minutes at three-fifteen&mdash;a quarter of an hour ago! Where was
Paul? Would he be coming to see him? He was going to spend the
evening out somewhere, 'returning late at night.'</p>

<p>He dressed feverishly. There was still time. He could call at
his aunt's. Rush down to the kitchen, seize the basin of beaten-up
eggs, and throw them away. But where? How? By the time he got there
Ernestine would have returned. She would want to know all about it.
The egg mixture would be examined, analysed. God in Heaven! It was
too late! The thing would have to go on, and he suffer and
wait.</p>

<p>Having dressed, he went out after saying to his wife:</p>

<p>'It's all right. It's going to be all right,' not exactly
knowing what he meant. He walked rapidly along the streets, with no
fixed destination in his mind. He found himself in the caf in the
Rue de la Roquette, where the idea was first conceived, where he
had reminded his brother.</p>

<p>He sat there drinking, waiting for the hours to pass.</p>

<p>Souffl day, and the old lady dined at seven! It was now not
quite five. He hoped Paul would turn up. A stranger tried to engage
him in conversation. The stranger apparently had some grievance
against a railway company. He wanted to tell him all the details
about a contract for rivets, over which he had been disappointed.
Henri didn't understand a word he was talking about. He didn't
listen. He wanted the stranger to drop down dead, or vanish into
thin air. At last he called the waiter and paid for his reckoning,
indicated by a small pile of saucers. From there he walked rapidly
to the Caf des Sentiers, looking for Paul. He was not there. Six
o'clock. One hour more. He could not keep still. He paid and went
on again, calling at caf after caf. A quarter to seven. Pray God
that she threw it away. Had he ground it fine enough?</p>

<p>Five minutes to seven. Seven o'clock. Now. He picked up his hat
and went again. The brandy had gone to his head. At half-past seven
he laughed recklessly. After all, what was the good of life to this
old woman of eighty-six? He tried to convince himself that he had
done it for the sake of his wife and children. He tried to
concentrate on the future, how he could manage on eight or ten
thousand francs a year. He would give notice at the office, be rude
to people who had been bullying him for years&mdash;that old
blackguard Mocquin!</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he was drunk, torpid, and indifferent. The whole
thing was over for good or ill. What did it matter? He terribly
wanted to see Paul, but he was too tired to care very much. The
irrevocable step had been taken. He went home to bed and fell into
a heavy drunken sleep.</p>

<p>'Henri! Henri! Wake up! What is the matter with you?'</p>

<p>His wife was shaking him. He blinked his way into a partial
condition of consciousness. November sunlight was pouring into the
room.</p>

<p>'It's late, isn't it?' he said, involuntarily.</p>

<p>'It's past eight. You'll be late at the office. You didn't go
yesterday. If you go on like this you'll get the sack, and then
what shall we do?'</p>

<p>Slowly the recollection of last night's events came back to
him.</p>

<p>'There's nothing to worry about,' he said. 'I'm too ill to go
to-day. Send them another telegram. It'll be all right.'</p>

<p>His wife looked at him searchingly. 'You've been drinking,' she
said. 'Oh, you men! God knows what will become of us.'</p>

<p>She appeared to be weeping in her apron. It struck him forcibly
at that instant how provoking and small women are. Here was
Jeannette crying over her petty troubles. Whereas he&mdash;</p>

<p>The whole thing was becoming vivid again. Where was Paul? What
had happened? Was it at all likely that he could go down to an
office on a day like this, a day that was to decide his fate?</p>

<p>He groaned, and elaborated rather pathetically his imaginary
ailments, anything to keep this woman quiet. She left him at last,
and he lay there waiting for something to happen. The hours passed.
What would be the first intimation? Paul or the gendarmes? Thoughts
of the latter stirred him to a state of fevered activity. About
midday he arose, dressed, and went out. He told his wife he was
going to the office, but he had no intention of doing so. He went
and drank coffee at a place up in the Marais. He was terrified of
his old haunts. He wandered from place to place, uncertain how to
act. Late in the afternoon he entered a caf in the Rue Alibert. At
a kiosk outside he bought a late edition of an afternoon newspaper.
He sat down, ordered a drink and opened the newspaper. He glanced
at the central news page, and as his eye absorbed one paragraph he
unconsciously uttered a low scream. The paragraph was as
follows:</p>

<p class="letter">MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT CHANTILLY<br>
<br>
<i>A mysterious affair occurred at Chantilly this morning. A
middle-aged man, named Paul Denoyel, complained of pains in the
stomach after eating an omelette. He died soon after in great
agony. He was staying with his aunt, Mme Taillandier. No other
members of the household were affected. The matter is to be
inquired into.</i></p>

<p>The rest was a dream. He was only vaguely conscious of the
events which followed. He wandered through it all, the instinct of
self-preservation bidding him hold his tongue in all circumstances.
He knew nothing. He had seen nothing. He had a visionary
recollection of a plump, weeping Ernestine, at the inquest,
enlarging upon the eccentricities of her mistress. A queer woman,
who would brook no contradiction. He heard a lot about the fish day
and the souffl day, and how the old lady insisted that this was a
fish day, and that she had had a souffl the day before. You could
not argue with her when she was like that. And Ernestine had beaten
up the eggs all ready for the souffl&mdash;most provoking! But
Ernestine was a good cook, of method and economy. She wasted
nothing. What should she do with the eggs? Why, of course, Mr Paul,
who since he had come to live there was never content with a
<i>caf complet</i>. He must have a breakfast, like these English
and other foreigners do. She made him an omelette, which he ate
heartily.</p>

<p>Then the beaten-up eggs with their deadly mixture were intended
