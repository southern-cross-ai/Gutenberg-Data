  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MY first case! with what an agreeable thrill a professional
  man repeats the words to himself. With most men I believe it is as it was
  with me, not the case that he intrigues for and expects to get but something
  quite different, that drops out of Heaven unexpected and undeserved like most
  of the good things of life.</p>

  <p>Every now and then in an expansive moment I tell the story of my case, or
  part of it, whereupon something like the following invariably succeeds: "Why
  don't you write it down?"</p>

  <p>"I never learned the trade of writing."</p>

  <p>"But detective stories are so popular!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, because the detective is a romantic figure, a hero, gifted with
  almost superhuman keenness and infallibility. Nobody ever accused me of being
  romantic. I am only an ordinary fellow who plugs away like any other business
  man. Every day I am up against it; I fall down; some crook turns a trick on
  me. What kind of a story would that make?"</p>

  <p>"But that's what people want nowadays, the real thing, stories of the
  streets day by day."</p>

  <p>Well, I have succumbed. Here goes for better or for worse.</p>

  <p>Before beginning I should explain that though it was my first case I was
  no longer in the first bloom of youth. I was along in the thirties before I
  got my start and had lost a deal of hair from my cranium. This enabled me to
  pass for ten years older if I wished to, and still with the assistance of my
  friend Oscar Nilson the wig-maker I could make a presentable figure of youth
  and innocence.</p>

  <p>During my earlier days I had been a clerk in a railway freight office, a
  poor slave with only my dreams to keep me going. My father had no sympathy
  with my aspirations to be a detective. He was a close-mouthed and a
  close-fisted man. But when he died, after having been kept on scanty rations
  for years, the old lady and I found ourselves quite comfortably off.</p>

  <p>I promptly shook the dust of the freight office from my feet and set about
  carrying some of the dreams into effect. I rented a little office on Fortieth
  street (twenty dollars a month), furnished it discreetly, and had my name
  painted in neat characters on the frosted glass of the door: "B. Enderby" no
  more. Lord! how proud I was of the outfit.</p>

  <p>I bought a fireproof document file for cases, and had some note-paper and
  cards printed in the same neat style:</p>

  <p class="sign">B. ENDERBY<br>
  Confidential Investigator</p>

  <p><br>
  You see I wished to avoid the sensational. I was not looking for any common
  divorce evidence business. Since I had enough to exist on, I was determined
  to wait for important, high- priced, kid-glove cases.</p>

  <p>And I waited more than a year in fact. But it was a delightful time!
  Fellows were always dropping in to smoke and chin. My little office became
  like our club. You see I had missed all this when I was a boy. Any youngster
  who has ever been speeded up in a big clerical office will understand how
  good it was. Meanwhile I studied crime in all its aspects.</p>

  <p>I worked, too, at another ambition which I shared with a few million of my
  fellow-creatures, viz.: to write a successful play. I started a dozen and
  finished one. I thought it was a wonder of brilliancy then. I have learned
  better. In pursuance of this aim I had to attend the theatre a good deal, and
  from the top gallery I learned something about actors and actresses if not
  how to write a great play.</p>

  <p>I mention the play-writing for it was that which brought me my first case.
  I used to haunt the office of a certain prominent play-broker who was always
  promising to read my play and never did. One afternoon in the upstairs
  corridor of the building where she had her offices I came face to face with
  the famous Irma Hamerton.</p>

  <p>Nowadays Irma is merely a tradition of loveliness and grace. Theatregoers
  of this date have nothing like her to rejoice their eyes. Then, to us humble
  fellows she stood for the rarest essence of life, the ideal, the unattainable
  call it what you like. Tall, slender and dark, with a voice that played on
  your heartstrings, she was one of the fortunate ones of earth. She had always
  been a star, always an idol of the public. Not only did I and my gang never
  miss a show in which she appeared, but we would sit up half the night
  afterwards talking about her. None of us naturally had ever dreamed of seeing
  her face to face.</p>

  <p>We met at a corner of the corridor, and almost collided. I forgot my
  manners entirely. My eyes almost popped out of my head. I wished to fix that
  moment in my life forever. Imagine my confusion when I saw that she was
  crying, that glorious creature! actually the tears were running down her soft
  cheeks like any common woman's. Do you wonder that a kind of convulsion took
  place inside me?</p>

  <p>Seeing me, she quickly turned her head, but it was too late, I had already
  seen them stealing like diamonds down her cheeks. I stared at her like a
  clown, and like a clown I blurted out without thinking:</p>

  <p>"Oh, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>She didn't answer me, of course. She merely hurried faster down the hall,
  and turned the next corner.</p>

  <p>When I realised what I had done I felt like butting my silly head through
  one of the glass partitions that lined the corridor. I called myself all the
  names in my vocabulary. I clean forgot my own errand in the building, and
  went back to my office muttering to myself in the streets like a lunatic.</p>

  <p>I was glad no one dropped in. In my mind I went over the scene of the
  meeting a hundred times I suppose, and made up what I ought to have said and
  done, more ridiculous I expect than what had happened. What bothered me was
  that she would think I was just a common fresh guy. I couldn't rest under
  that. So I started to write her a note. I wrote half a dozen and tore them
  up. The one I sent ran like this: I blush to think of it now.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Miss Irma Hamerton</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">The undersigned met you in the corridor of the Manhattan
  Theatre Building this afternoon about three. You seemed to be in distress,
  and I was so surprised I forgot myself and addressed you. I beg that you will
  accept my apology for the seeming rudeness. I have seen you in all your
  plays, many of them several times over, and I have received so much pleasure
  from your acting, and I respect you so highly that it is very painful to me
  to think that I may have added to your distress by my rudeness. I assure you
  that it was only clumsiness, and not intentional rudeness.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours respectfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">B. Enderby</span>.</p>

  <p><br>
  The instant after I had posted this letter I would have given half I
  possessed to get it back again. It suddenly occurred to me that it would only
  make matters worse. Either it would seem like an impertinent attempt to pry
  into her private affairs, or a bold move to follow up my original rudeness. A
  real gentleman would not have said anything about the tears, I told myself.
  My cheeks got hot, but it was too late to recall the letter. I was thoroughly
  miserable. I did not tell any of my friends what had happened.</p>

  <p>That night I went alone to see her play. Lost in her part of course and
  hidden under her makeup she betrayed nothing. There was always a suggestion
  of sadness about her, even in comedy. When that lovely deep voice trembled, a
  corresponding shiver went up and down your spine.</p>

  <p>I thought about her all the way home. My detective instinct was aroused. I
  tried to figure out what could be her trouble. There are only four kinds of
  really desperate trouble: ill- health, death, loss of money, and unrequited
  love. To look at her in the daylight without make-up was enough to dispose of
  the first. It was said that she had no close relatives, therefore she
  couldn't have lost any recently. As for money, surely with her earning
  capacity she had no need to trouble about that. Finally, how could it be an
  affair of the heart? Was there a man alive who would not have cast himself at
  her feet if she had turned a warm glance in his direction? Rich, successful
  and adored as she was, I had to give it up.</p>

  <p>About five o'clock the next afternoon the surprise of my life was
  administered to me. I received large, square, buff-coloured envelope with a
  brown border, and written upon with brown ink in immense, angular characters.
  On opening it my hand trembled with a delicious foreboding of what was
  inside, meanwhile better sense was telling me not to be a fool. It contained
  a card on which was written:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Miss Irma Hamerton will be glad to see Mr. B. Enderby if
  it will be convenient for him to call at the Hotel Rotterdam at noon on
  Thursday."</p>

  <p><br>
  For a moment I stared at it, dazed. Then I went up in the air. I did a sort
  of war-dance around the office. Finally I rushed out to the most fashionable
  outfitters to get a new suit before closing time. Thursday was the next
  day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD never been inside that exclusive of exclusive hotels,
  the Rotterdam. I confess that my knees were a little infirm as I went through
  the swing doors, and passed before the nonchalant, indifferent eyes of the
  handsome footmen in blue liveries. "Ahh, they're only overgrown bell-hops!" I
  told myself encouragingly, and fixed the Marquis behind the desk with a
  haughty stare.</p>

  <p>Walking in a dream I presently found myself being shown into a corner room
  high up in the building. I was left there alone, and I had a chance to look
  around. I had never seen anything like it, except on the stage. It was
  decorated in what I think they call the Empire style, with walls of white
  panelled wood, picked out with gold, and pretty, curiously shaped furniture.
  Everywhere there were great bunches of pink roses, picked that morning, you
  could see, with petals still moist. It smelled like Heaven might.</p>

  <p>That was all I had time to take in when the door opened, and she entered.
  She was wearing a pink lacy sort of thing that went with the roses. She
  didn't mind me, of course. She was merely polite and casual. But just the
  same I could see that she was deeply troubled about something. Trouble makes
  a woman's eyes big. Makes a beautiful woman twice as beautiful.</p>

  <p>She went to the point as straight as a bullet.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are wondering why I sent for you?"</p>

  <p>I confessed that I was.</p>

  <p>"It was the heading on your letter paper. What do you mean by
  'confidential investigator', a detective?"</p>

  <p>"Something a little better than an ordinary detective, I hope."</p>

  <p>She switched to another track. "Why did you write to me?"</p>

  <p>This took me by surprise. "There was no reason except what the letter
  said," I stammered.</p>

  <p>Several other questions followed, by which I saw she was trying to get a
  line on me. I offered her references. She accepted them inattentively.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter so much what other people think of you," she said. "I
  have to make up my mind about you for myself. Tell me more about
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"I'm not much of a hand at the brass instruments," I said. "Please ask me
  questions."</p>

  <p>This seemed to please her. After some further inquiries she said simply:
  "I wrote to you because it seemed to me from your letter that you had a good
  heart. I need that perhaps more than detective skill. I live in a blaze of
  publicity. I am surrounded by flatterers. The pushing, thick-skinned sort of
  people force themselves close to me, and the kind that I like avoid me, I
  fear. I am not sure of whom I can trust. I am very sure that if I put my
  business in the hands of the regular people it would soon become a matter of
  common knowledge."</p>

  <p>Her simplicity and sadness affected me deeply. I could do nothing but
  protest my honesty and my devotion.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," she said at last. "Are you very busy at present?"</p>

  <p>"Tolerably," I said with a busy air. It would never have done to let her
  think otherwise.</p>

  <p>"I would like you to take my case," she said with an enchanting note of
  appeal, "but it would have to be on the condition that you attended to it
  yourself, solely. I would have to ask you to agree not to delegate any part
  of it to even the most trusted of your employees."</p>

  <p>This was easy, since I didn't have any.</p>

  <p>"You must, please, further agree not to take any steps without consulting
  me in advance, and you must not mind perhaps I might call the whole thing off
  at any moment. But of course I would pay you."</p>

  <p>I quickly agreed to the conditions.</p>

  <p>"I have been robbed of a pearl necklace," she said with an air of infinite
  sadness.</p>

  <p>I did not need to be told that there was more in this than the ordinary
  actress' stolen jewels case. Irma Hamerton didn't need that kind of
  advertising. She was morbidly anxious that there should be no advertising in
  this.</p>

  <p>"It was a single strand of sixty-seven black pearls ranging in size from a
  currant down to a pea. They were perfectly matched, and each stone had a
  curious, bluish cast, which is, I believe, quite rare. As jewels go nowadays,
  it was not an exceptionally valuable necklace, worth about twenty-six
  thousand dollars. It represented my entire savings. I have a passion for
  pearls. These were exceptionally perfect and beautiful. They were the result
  of years of search and selection. Jewellers call them blue pearls. I will
  show you what they looked like."</p>

  <p>She went into the adjoining room for a moment, returning with a string of
  dusky, gleaming pearls hanging from her hand. They were lovely things. My
  unaccustomed eyes could not distinguish the blue in them until she pointed it
  out. It was like the last gleam of light in the evening sky.</p>

  <p>"The lost necklace was exactly like this," she said.</p>

  <p>"Had you two?" I asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>She smiled a little. "These are artificial."</p>

  <p>I suppose I looked like the fool I felt.</p>

  <p>"A very natural mistake," she said. "Some time ago my jeweler advised me
  not to wear the real pearls on the stage, so I had this made by Roberts. The
  resemblance was so perfect that I could scarcely tell the difference myself.
  It was only by wearing them that I could be sure."</p>

  <p>"By wearing them?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"The warmth of my body caused the real pearls to gleam with a deeper
  lustre."</p>

  <p>"Lucky pearls!" I thought.</p>

  <p>"They almost seemed alive," she went on with a kind of passionate regret.
  "The artificial pearls show no change, of course. And they have to be renewed
  in a short time."</p>

  <p>I asked for the circumstances of the robbery.</p>

  <p>"It was at the theatre," she said. "It occurred on the night of February
  14th."</p>

  <p>"Six weeks ago!" I exclaimed in dismay. "The trail is cold!"</p>

  <p>"I know," she said deprecatingly. "I do not expect a miracle."</p>

  <p>I asked her to go on.</p>

  <p>"I had an impulse to wear the genuine pearls that night. I got them out of
  the safe deposit vault in the afternoon. When I saw the real and the
  artificial together I was afraid of making a mistake, so I made a little
  scratch on the clasp of the real strand. I wear them in the first act. I have
  to leave them off in the second act, when I appear in a nurse's uniform, also
  in the third when I am supposed to be ill. In the fourth act I wear them
  again.</p>

  <p>"On the night in question I wore the real pearls in the first act. I am
  sure of that, because they were glowing wonderfully when I took them off as
  if there was a tiny fire in each stone. I put them in the pocket of the
  nurse's uniform and carried them on the stage with me during the second act.
  In the third act I was obliged to leave them in my dressing-room, because in
  this act I am shown in bed. But I thought they would be safe in the pocket of
  the dress I took off."</p>

  <p>"The instant I returned to my dressing-room, I got them out and put them
  on, suspecting nothing wrong. It was not until after the final curtain that
  upon taking them off, I was struck by their dullness. I looked for my little
  mark on the clasp. It was not there. I found I had two strings of artificial
  pearls."</p>

  <p>I asked her the obvious questions. "Did you have any special reason for
  wearing the genuine pearls that night?"</p>

  <p>"None, except that I loved them. I loved to handle them. They were so
  alive! I was afraid they might lose their life if I never wore them."</p>

  <p>Somehow, I was not fully satisfied with this answer. But for the present I
  let it go.</p>

  <p>"Was any one with you when you got them out of the safety deposit box?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I was quite alone."</p>

  <p>"Did any one know you were wearing them that night?"</p>

  <p>"No one."</p>

  <p>"Were there any strangers on the stage?"</p>

  <p>"No. My manager at my request is very particular as to that. I have been
  so annoyed by well-meaning people. No one is admitted. In this production the
  working force behind is small. I can give you the name of every person who
  was on the stage that night."</p>

  <p>"Has any one connected with the company left since then?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Who has the entree to your dressing-room while you are on the stage?"</p>

  <p>"Only my maid. But she is not expected to remain there every moment.
  Indeed, on the night in question I remember seeing her watching the scene
  from the first entrance."</p>

  <p>"During which time your room was unlocked?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely. But the door to it was immediately behind her."</p>

  <p>"Have you any reason to suspect her?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. She's been with me four years. Still, I do not except her
  from your investigation."</p>

  <p>"Does she know of your loss?"</p>

  <p>"No one in the world knows of it but you and I."</p>

  <p>"And the thief," I added.</p>

  <p>She winced. I was unable to ascribe a reason for it.</p>

  <p>"Do you care to tell me why you waited six weeks before deciding to look
  for the thief?" I asked as gently as possible.</p>

  <p>"My jeweller who is also an old friend, has secured three more blue
  pearls," she answered quickly. "He has asked me for the necklace, so that he
  can add them to it. I cannot put him off much longer without confessing that
  I have lost it."</p>

  <p>"But shouldn't we tell him that it has been stolen?" I asked
  surprised.</p>

  <p>She energetically shook her head.</p>

  <p>"But jewellers have an organisation for the recovery of stolen jewels," I
  persisted. "The only way we can prevent the thief from realising on the
  pearls is by having the loss published throughout the trade."</p>

  <p>"I can't consent to that," she said with painfully compressed lips. "I
  want you to make your investigation first."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me who is your jeweller?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Alfred Mount."</p>

  <p>"If you could only tell me why he must not be told," I insinuated.</p>

  <p>She still shook her head. "A woman's reason," she murmured, avoiding my
  glance.</p>

  <p>"You know, of course, how you increase my difficulties by withholding part
  of your confidence."</p>

  <p>There was a little tremble in her lovely throat. "Don't make me sorry I
  asked you to help me," she said.</p>

  <p>I bowed.</p>

  <p>"See what you can do in spite of it," she said wistfully.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I NEED not take the space to put down all the operations of
  my early reasoning on the case. I had plenty to think about. But every avenue
  my thoughts followed was blocked sooner or later by a blank wall. Never in my
  whole experience have I been asked to take up such a blind trail and this was
  my first case, remember. Six weeks lost beyond recall! It was
  discouraging.</p>

  <p>I narrowed myself down to two main theories:</p>

  <p>(a) The pearls had been stolen by experienced specialists after long and
  careful plotting or,</p>

  <p>(b) They had been picked up on impulse by a man or woman dazzled by their
  beauty. In this case the thief would most likely hoard them and gloat over
  them in secret.</p>

  <p>Not the least puzzling factor in the case was my client herself. It was
  clear that she had been passionately attached to her pearls; she spoke of
  them always in almost a poetic strain. Yet there was a personal note of
  anguish in her grief which even the loss of her treasure was not sufficient
  to explain. She was a quiet woman. And strangest of all, she seemed to be
  more bent on finding out who had taken them, than on getting them back again.
  She had waited six weeks before acting at all, and now she hedged me around
  with so many conditions that the prospect of success was nil.</p>

  <p>I had an intuition which warned me that if I wished to remain friends with
  her I had better be careful whom I accused of the crime. It was a puzzler
  whichever way you looked at it. However, an investigator must not allow
  himself to dwell on the hopelessness of his whole tangle, but must set to
  work on a thread at a time. Whichever way it turned out, I was to have the
  delight for a long time to come of seeing her frequently.</p>

  <p>I was there again the next afternoon. This day I remember the room was
  fragrant with the scent of great bowls of violets. The lovely dark-haired
  mistress of the place looked queenly in a dress of purple and silver. As
  always when there were a number of people around she was composed in manner,
  one might say a little haughty.</p>

  <p>There was quite a crowd. It included a middle-aged lady, a Mrs. Bleecker,
  a little over-dressed for her age and envious- looking. She, it transpired,
  was Miss Hamerton's companion or chaperon. The only other woman was a sister
  star, a handsome, blonde woman older than Miss Hamerton, very affectionate
  and catty. I have forgotten her name. The men were of various types. Among
  them I remember the editor of a prominent newspaper, a well-known playwright
  and Mr. Roland Quarles. The latter was Miss Hamerton's leading man. He looked
  quite as handsome and young off the stage as on, but seemed morose.</p>

  <p>Miss Hamerton introduced me all around in her casual way, and left me to
  sink or swim by my own efforts. None of the people put themselves out to be
  agreeable to me. I could see that each was wondering jealously where I came
  in. However, since I had a right to be there, I didn't let it trouble me.
  This is life! I told myself, and kept my eyes and ears open. I was not long
  in discovering that these "brilliant" people chattered about as foolishly as
  the humblest I knew. Only my beautiful young lady was always dignified and
  wistful. She let others do the talking.</p>

  <p>I stubbornly outstayed them all. The men very reluctantly left me in
  possession of the field. As for the lady companion I saw in her eye that she
  was determined to learn what I had come for. However, Miss Hamerton coolly
  disposed of her by asking her to entertain a newcomer in the next room while
  she talked business with me.</p>

  <p>These people wearied her. She relaxed when they had gone. She said to me:
  "I had you shown right up because I want my friends to become accustomed to
  seeing you. I hope you did not mind."</p>

  <p>I replied that I was delighted.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to account for you in some way," she went on, "or their
  curiosity will run riot. What would you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let them suppose that I am a playwright whose work you are interested
  in."</p>

  <p>She accepted the idea. How delightful it was for me to share secrets with
  her!</p>

  <p>My particular purpose in making this call was to urge her again to take
  the jeweller into her confidence. I pointed out to her that we could hope to
  do nothing unless we blocked the thief from disposing of the pearls. Very
  reluctantly she finally consented, stipulating, however, that the jeweller
  must be told that she had just discovered her loss. I explained to her that
  we must look back to make sure that the jewels had not already been offered
  for sale, but on this point she stood firm. She gave me a note of
  introduction to Mr. Alfred Mount.</p>

  <p>I delivered it the following morning. At this time Mount's was the very
  last word in fashion. It was a smallish store but most richly fitted up, on
  one of the best corners of the avenue, up near the cathedral. Every one of
  the salesmen had the air of a younger son of the aristocracy. They dealt only
  in precious stones, none of your common stuff like gold or silver.</p>

  <p>I was shown into a private office at the back, a gem of a private office,
  exquisite and simple. And in Mr. Alfred Mount I saw that I had a notable man.
  One guessed that he would have been a big man in any line. So far I knew him
  only as one of the city's leading jewellers. By degrees I learned that his
  interests were widespread.</p>

  <p>He was a man of about fifty who looked younger, owing to his flashing dark
  eyes, and his lips, full and crimson as a youth's. In a general way he had a
  foreign look, though you couldn't exactly place him as a Frenchman, an
  Italian or a Spaniard. It was only, I suppose, that he wore his black hair
  and curly beard a little more luxuriantly than a good American. His manner
  was of the whole world.</p>

  <p>My involuntary first impression was dead against the man. He was too much
  in character with the strange little orchid that decorated his buttonhole.
  Later I decided that this was only my Anglo-Saxon narrowness. True, he kept a
  guard on his bright eyes, and his red lips were firmly closed but do we not
  all have to train our features? He was a jeweller who earned his bread by
  kow-towing to the rich. My own face was not an open book, yet I considered
  myself a fairly honest creature.</p>

  <p>He read my letter of introduction which stated that I would explain my
  business to him. Upon his asking what that was I told him quietly that Miss
  Hamerton had been robbed of her pearls.</p>

  <p>He started in his chair, and pierced me through and through with those
  brilliant black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Give me the facts!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>I did so.</p>

  <p>"But you," he said impatiently, "I don't know you."</p>

  <p>I offered him my card, and explained that Miss Hamerton had retained my
  services.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a few moments, chewing his moustache. It was impossible
  to guess what was going on behind the mask of his features. Suddenly he
  started to cross-question me like a criminal lawyer. How long had I been in
  business? Was I accustomed to handling big cases? Had I any financial
  standing? What references could I give? And so on, and so on. My patience
  finally gave way under it. "I beg your pardon," I said stiffly. "I recognise
  the right of only one person to examine me in this manner. That is my
  client."</p>

  <p>He pulled himself together, and, I must say, apologised handsomely. Like
  all big men he was often surprisingly frank. "Forgive me," he said winningly.
  "You are quite right. I am terribly upset by your news. I forgot myself. I
  confess, too, I am hurt that Miss Hamerton should have acted in this matter
  without first consulting me. I am a very old friend."</p>

  <p>I was glad she had done so, for something told me I never should have got
  the job from him. I did not tell him how she had come to engage me, though he
  gave me several openings to do so.</p>

  <p>"I am not a narrow man," he said in his best manner. "I will not hold it
  against you. Only show me that you are the man for the job, and I will aid
  you with all my power."</p>

  <p>I accepted the olive branch. "I spoke too hastily myself," I returned. "I
  shall be glad to tell you anything you want to know about myself."</p>

  <p>We basked in the rays of mutual politeness for a while. Still that
  instinctive dislike of the man would not quite down. He asked no more
  personal questions.</p>

  <p>"Have the police been notified?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hamerton imposes absolute secrecy."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he said quickly. "That is wise."</p>

  <p>I had my doubts of it, but I didn't air them.</p>

  <p>"Have you any clues?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None as yet."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"To publish the loss through the channels of the trade, with the request
  that if any attempt is made to dispose of the pearls we should instantly be
  notified. The owner's name, and the circumstances of the robbery must be kept
  secret."</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said, making a memo on a pad. "I will attend to it at
  once, and discreetly. Is there anything else I can do?"</p>

  <p>"I hoped that with your knowledge of jewels and the jewel market you could
  give me something to work on," I said.</p>

  <p>"All I know is at your command," said he. He talked at length about jewels
  and jewel thieves, but it was all in generalities. There was nothing that I
  could get my teeth into. He gave it as his opinion that the pearls were
  already on their way abroad, perhaps to India.</p>

  <p>"Then you think that the robbery was engineered by experts?"</p>

  <p>He spread out his expressive hands. "How can I tell?"</p>

  <p>We parted with mutual expressions of good will. I said. "I expect I shall
  have to come often to you for help."</p>

  <p>"I expect you to," he said earnestly. "I want you to. Myself and my
  establishment are at your service. Let no question of expense hamper
  you."</p>

  <p>I found later that he really meant this. I was, however, very reluctant to
  draw on him.</p>

  <p>When I saw Miss Hamerton the next day I asked her a question or two
  concerning Mr. Alfred Mount with the object of finding out if he were really
  such an old friend as he made out.</p>

  <p>"I have always known him," she said simply. "That I happen to buy things
  from him is merely incidental. He was a friend of my father's and he is a
  very good friend to me. He has proved it more than once."</p>

  <p>I was tempted to ask: "Then why were you so reluctant to take him into
  your confidence?" But I reflected that since she had already refused to tell
  me, I had better keep my mouth shut, and find out otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mount asked if we had notified the police," I said, merely to see how
  she would take it.</p>

  <p>I regretted it. Her expression of pain and terror went to my heart. She
  was no longer the remote and lovely goddess, but only a suffering woman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did not, you have not?" she stammered.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," I said quickly. "I knew you didn't wish it."</p>

  <p>She turned away to recover herself. What was I to make of it? One would
  almost have said that she was a party to the theft of her own jewels.</p>

  <p>And yet only a few minutes later she burst out in a passionate plea to me
  to discover the thief.</p>

  <p>"It tortures me!" she cried, 'the suspense, the uncertainty! This
  atmosphere of doubt and suspicion is suffocating! I wish I never had had any
  pearls! I wish I were a farmer's daughter or a mill girl! Please, please
  settle it one way or the other. I shall never have a quiet sleep until I
  know!"</p>

  <p>"Know what?" I asked quietly.</p>

  <p>But she made believe not to have heard me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I SPENT the next two or three days in quiet work here and
  there. The most considerable advance I made was in picking an acquaintance
  with McArdle, the property man of Miss Hamerton's company. Watching the stage
  door I discovered that the working- force behind the scenes frequented the
  back room of a saloon on Sixth avenue for lunch after the show. The rest was
  easy. By the third night McArdle and I were on quite a confidential
  footing.</p>

  <p>From him I heard any amount of gossip. McArdle was of the garrulous,
  emotional type and very free with his opinions. The star was the only one he
  spared. From his talk I got the principal members of the company fixed in my
  mind. Beside Mr. Quarles there was George Casanova, the heavy man, a
  well-known actor but, according to McArdle, a loud-mouthed, empty braggart,
  and Richard Richards, the character heavy, a silly old fool, he said,
  devoured by vanity. Among the women the next in importance after the star was
  Miss Beulah Maddox, the heavy lady, who in the opinion of my amiable
  informant giggled and ogled like a sewing- machine girl, and she forty if she
  was a day.</p>

  <p>Discreet questioning satisfied me that McArdle was quite unaware that a
  robbery had been committed in the theatre. If he didn't know it, certainly it
  was not known.</p>

  <p>Out of bushels of gossip I sifted now and then a grain of valuable
  information. He informed me that Roland Quarles was in love with the star.
  For some reason that I could not fathom he was especially bitter against the
  young leading man. He would rail against him by the hour, but there seemed to
  be no solid basis for his dislike.</p>

  <p>"Does she favour him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Nah!" he said. "She's got too much sense. He's a four- flusher, a
  counter-jumper, a hall-room boy! Lord! the airs he gives himself you'd think
  he had a million a year! He's a tail- ender with her, and he knows it. He's
  sore."</p>

  <p>"Who seems to be ahead of him?" I asked with strong curiosity.</p>

  <p>"There's a dozen regulars," said McArdle. "Two Pittsburgh millionaires, a
  newspaper editor, a playwright and so on. But if you ask me, the jeweller is
  ahead in the running."</p>

  <p>"The jeweller?" I said, pricking up my ears.</p>

  <p>"Spanish looking gent with whiskers," said McArdle. "Keeps a swell joint
  on the avenue. Mount, his name is. He's a wise guy, does the old family
  friend act, see? He's a liberal feller. I hope he gets her."</p>

  <p>This bit of information gave me food for thought. I thought it explained
  my intuitive dislike of Mount. The thought of that old fellow presuming to
  court the exquisite Irma made me hot under the collar.</p>

  <p>I went to the store of Roberts, the manufacturer of artificial pearls.
  This place was as well-known in its way as Mount's, since Roberts had sued
  the Duke of Downshire and the public had learned that the pearls His Grace
  had presented to Miss Van Alstine on the occasion of their marriage were
  phony. It also was a very fancy establishment but like its wares, on a much
  less expensive scale.</p>

  <p>I fell in with a sociable and talkative young salesman, who at my request
  showed me a whole tray full of pearl necklaces. Among them I spotted another
  replica of Miss Hamerton's beautiful string.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" I asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Blue pearls," he rattled off. "Latest smart novelty. A hit. Mrs. Minturn
  Vesey had one sent up only yesterday. She wore it to the opera last
  night."</p>

  <p>"There isn't such a thing really as a blue pearl, is there?" I asked
  idly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. These are copies of genuine stones like all our stock. Some
  time ago a customer sent in the real necklace to have it copied, like they
  all do. This was such a rarity Mr. Roberts had a pattern made and put them on
  sale. It's a winner!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't want a thing everybody had bought," I said.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean everybody," he said. "But just a few of the very smartest.
  It's too expensive for everybody. Seven hundred and fifty. The original is
  priceless."</p>

  <p>"How many have you sold?"</p>

  <p>"About ten."</p>

  <p>"Who else bought them?"</p>

  <p>He reeled off a string of fashionable names.</p>

  <p>"That's only six."</p>

  <p>"The others were sold over the counter."</p>

  <p>The affable youngster was a little aggrieved when I left without
  buying.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mount was both surprised and deeply chagrined when I told him that
  exact replicas of Miss Hamerton's pearls were to be had at Roberts' by
  anybody with the price. He didn't see how he could stop it either. It
  appeared there was a standing feud between Roberts and the fashionable
  jewellers, in which Roberts had somewhat the advantage because the regular
  trade was obliged to employ him. No one else could make such artificial
  pearls.</p>

  <p>With Mr. Mount's assistance I had the sales of the replicas quietly
  traced. Nothing resulted from this. All but two of the sales were to persons
  above suspicion. These two had been sold over the counter, one to a man, one
  to a woman, and as the transactions were over two months old, I could not get
  a working description of the buyers.</p>

  <p>On another occasion I went into Dunsany's, the largest and best-known
  jewelry store in America, if not in the world, and asked to see some one who
  could give me some information about pearls. I was steered up to a large,
  pale gentleman wearing glasses, very elegantly dressed, of course. I put on
  my most youthful and engaging manner. I heard him addressed as Mr. Freer.</p>

  <p>"Look here," I said, "I expect you'll want to have me thrown out for
  bothering you, but I'm in a hole."</p>

  <p>My smile disarmed him. "What can I do for you?" he asked impressively.</p>

  <p>"I'm a fiction writer," I said. "I'm writing a story about blue pearls,
  and somebody told me there was no such thing. Was he right?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the black pearl has a bluish light in it," said Mr. Freer. "But
  it would take an expert to distinguish it. Such pearls are called blue pearls
  in the trade."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you haven't got one you could show me?" I said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "They rarely come into the market. There is only one
  place in New York where they may be found."</p>

  <p>"And that is?"</p>

  <p>"Mount's. Mr. Alfred Mount has a hobby for collecting them. Naturally when
  a blue pearl appears it is generally offered first to him. You'd better go to
  see him. He knows more about blue pearls than any man in the world."</p>

  <p>"One more question?" I said cajolingly, "in my story I have to imagine the
  existence of a necklace of sixty-seven blue pearls ranging in size from a
  currant down to a pea, all perfectly matched, perfect in form and lustre. If
  there was such a thing what would it be worth?"</p>

  <p>When I described the necklace I received a mild shock, for the pale eyes
  of the man who was watching me suddenly contracted like a frightened
  animal's. The muscles of his large pale face never moved, but I saw the eyes
  bolt. He smiled stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say," he said. "Its value would be fabulous."</p>

  <p>"But give me some idea," I said, "just for the sake of the story."</p>

  <p>He moistened his lips. "Oh, say half a million," he said. "It would not be
  too much."</p>

  <p>I swallowed my astonishment, and thanked him, and made my way out.</p>

  <p>Here was more food for cogitation. Why should a few idle questions throw
  the pearl expert at Dunsany's into such visible agitation? I had to give it
  up. Perhaps it was a twinge of indigestion or a troublesome corn. Anyhow I
  lost sight of it in the greater discovery. Half a million for the necklace,
  and Miss Hamerton had told me that buying it pearl by pearl it had cost her
  little more than twenty-five thousand!</p>

  <p><br>
  Meanwhile there was an idea going through my head that I had not quite nerve
  enough to open to my client. It must be remembered that though I was making
  strides, I was still green at my business. I was not nearly so sure of myself
  as my manner might have led you to suppose. To my great joy Miss Hamerton
  herself broached the subject.</p>

  <p>One afternoon she said, apropos of nothing that had gone before: "I'm
  sorry now that I introduced you to my friends. Though I do not see how I
  could have seen you without their knowing it."</p>

  <p>"Why sorry?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She went on with charming diffidence how was one to resist her when she
  pleaded with an humble air: "I have thought if it would not tie you down too
  closely that you might take a minor role in my company."</p>

  <p>My heart leaped but of course I was not going to betray my eagerness if I
  could help it.</p>

  <p>"As to your friends having seen me," I said, 'that doesn't make any
  difference. Disguise is part of my business."</p>

  <p>"Then will you?" she eagerly asked.</p>

  <p>I made believe to consider it doubtfully. "It would tie me down!" I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hope you can arrange it!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Could it be managed without exciting comment in the company?"</p>

  <p>"Easily. I have thought it all out. I have an assistant stage manager who
  plays a small part. By increasing his duties behind, I can in a perfectly
  natural way make it necessary to engage somebody to play his bit. I shall not
  appear in the matter."</p>

  <p>"I have had no experience," I objected.</p>

  <p>"I will coach you."</p>

  <p>Could I resist that?</p>

  <p>"It would be better to put in an operative."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! No one but you!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll manage it somehow," I said.</p>

  <p>She sighed with relief, and started that moment to coach me.</p>

  <p>"You are a thug, a desperate character. You appear in only one scene, a
  cellar dimly lighted, so you will not be conspicuous from in front. You must
  practise speaking in a throaty, husky growl."</p>

  <p>In order to prolong the delightful lessons I made out to be a little
  stupider than I was.</p>

  <p>I was engaged the next day but one through a well-known theatrical agent
  where Miss Hamerton had instructed me to apply for a job. Just how she
  contrived it I can't say, but I know I came into the company without anybody
  suspecting that it was upon the star's recommendation. In the theatre, of
  course, she ignored me.</p>

  <p>Two nights later I made my debut. Mine was such a very small part no one
  in the company paid any attention to me, but for me it was a big occasion, I
  can tell you. In the way of business I have faced death on several occasions
  with a quieter heart than I had upon first marching out into view of that
  thousand-headed creature across the footlights. With the usual egotism of the
  amateur I was sure they were all waiting to guy me. But they didn't. I spoke
  my half dozen lines without disaster. I felt as if the real me was sitting up
  in the flies watching his body act down below. Indeed, I could write several
  chapters upon my sensations that night, but as somebody else has said, that
  is another story.</p>

  <p>What is more important is the discovery of my first piece of evidence.</p>

  <p>At the end of the performance I was crossing the quiet stage on my way out
  of the theatre, when I saw a group of stage-hands and some of the minor
  members of the company by the stage-door with their heads together over a
  piece of paper. I joined the group, taking care not to bring myself forward;
  another happened along, and he asked for me: "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Richards answered: "McArdle here found a piece of paper on the stage with
  funny writing on it. It's a mystery like."</p>

  <p>"Let's have a squint at it," said the newcomer.</p>

  <p>I looked over his shoulder. It was a single sheet of cheap note-paper of
  the style they call 'dimity'. It had evidently been torn from a pad. It
  seemed to be the last of several sheets of a letter, and it was written in a
  cryptogram which made my mouth water. I may say that I have a passion for
  this kind of a puzzle. I give it as I first saw it:</p><br>

  <p style="margin-left:66%">J.</p>

  <p>I had no proof on beholding this meaningless assortment of letters that it
  had anything to do with my case, but I had a hunch. The question was how to
  get possession of it without showing my hand. I kept silent for a while, and
  let the discussion rage as to the proper way to translate it.</p>

  <p>My excitable friend McArdle (who did not know me, of course, in my present
  character), naturally as the finder of the paper took a leading part in the
  discussion. The principals of the company had not yet emerged from their
  dressing-rooms. My opportunity came when McArdle stated in his positive way
  that it was a code, and that it was not possible to translate it without
  having the codebook.</p>

  <p>"A code is generally regular words," I suggested mildly, as became the
  newest and humblest member of the company. "Nobody would ever think up these
  crazy combinations of letters. I should say it was a cryptogram."</p>

  <p>McArdle wouldn't acknowledge that he didn't know what a cryptogram was,
  but somebody else asked.</p>

  <p>"Substituting one letter for another according to a numerical key," I
  said. "Easy enough to translate it if you can hit on the key."</p>

  <p>One thing led to another and soon came the inevitable challenge.</p>

  <p>"Bet you a dollar you can't read it!" cried McArdle.</p>

  <p>I hung back until the whole crowd joined him in taunting me.</p>

  <p>"Put up or shut up!" cried McArdle.</p>

  <p>The upshot was that we each deposited a dollar with old Tom the
  door-keeper, and I took the paper home. It was the most ingenious and
  difficult cryptogram I ever tackled. The sun was up before I got it. It was a
  richer prize than I had hoped for. Here it is:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Disposed of and your share of the money is here whenever
  you want to get it. I strongly advise you not to leave the company. You say
  she has not discovered her loss. All right. But these phony pearls soon lose
  their lustre. She might get on to it the same night you hand in your
  resignation. Then good- night. I'll be back Monday. J."[*]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* For the benefit of those of curious minds I will give
  the key to the cryptogram. The simplest form of this kind of puzzle is that
  in which every letter has a certain other letter to stand for it. It may be
  the one before it, the one after it, or a purely arbitrary substitution. In
  any case the same letter always has the same alias. That is child's play to
  solve. I soon discovered that I was faced by something more complex. Observe
  that in one place "night" appears as EA&amp;BO, whereas in the next line it
  is FBACP. "Company" masqueraded in this extraordinary form:
  &amp;MW&amp;M&amp;L. Here was a jawbreaker! To make a long story short I
  discovered after hundreds of experiments that the first letter of the first
  word of each sentence was ten letters in advance of the one set down; the
  second letter eleven letters ahead, and so on up to twenty- five, then begin
  over from ten. With each sentence however short the writer began afresh from
  ten. He added to the complications by including the character &amp; as the
  twenty- seventh letter of the alphabet. The fragmentary sentence at the top
  of the page held me up for a long time until I discovered that the first
  letter was twenty-three numbers in advance of the right one. Several mistakes
  on the part of the writer added to my difficulties.]</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN my experience I have found in adopting a disguise that it
  is no less important to change the character than the personal appearance. As
  the new member of Miss Hamerton's company I called myself William Faxon. I
  appeared as a shabby, genteel little fellow with lanky hair and glasses. The
  glasses were removed only when I went on the stage in the dark scene. On top
  of my bald spot I wore a kind of transformation that my friend Oscar Nilson
  furnished. It combed into my own hair, was sprinkled with grey and made me
  look like a man on the shady side of forty somewhat in need of a barber. The
  character I assumed was that of a gentle, friendly little party who agreed
  with everybody. The people of the company mostly despised me and made me a
  receptacle for their egotistical outpourings. They little guessed how they
  bored me.</p>

  <p>When I joined the company it had been agreed between Miss Hamerton and I
  that thereafter she had better come to the office to hear my reports. It was
  her custom to call nearly every afternoon about five. She insisted on hearing
  every detail of my activities, and listened to the story from day to day with
  the same anxious interest.</p>

  <p>Since she had first broken out in my presence she seemed not to mind to
  show her feelings to me. Indeed I guessed that it was a kind of relief to the
  high-strung woman who was always in the limelight, to let herself go a
  little. Her implied confidence was very gratifying to me. She never gave me
  the key to her anxiety in so many words, but by this time I was beginning to
  guess the explanation, as I suppose you are, too.</p>

  <p>When I had deciphered the cryptogram I went to bed in high satisfaction. I
  knew then that I was on the right track. The man (or woman) I was after was
  in Miss Hamerton's company. I slept until afternoon. Miss Hamerton had
  expected not to come that day so I called her up to say I had news. She said
  she couldn't come, but the coast was clear, and could I come to her?</p>

  <p>I found her pale and distrait. "Not bad news?" she asked apprehensively.
  "I'm not equal to it!"</p>

  <p>"But how do I know what is bad and good to you?" I objected.</p>

  <p>She ignored the complaint.</p>

  <p>When I explained the circumstances of the finding of the cryptogram, and
  showed her my translation I received another surprise. A sigh escaped her; an
  expression of beatific relief and gladness came into her face. The roses
  returned to her cheeks. She jumped up.</p>

  <p>"You're a welcome messenger!" she cried. "Oh, I'm happy now! I won't worry
  any more! I know!"</p>

  <p>I suppose I looked blank. She laughed at me. "Don't mind me!" she begged.
  "You're on the right track! You'll soon know everything!"</p>

  <p>She moved around the room humming to herself like a happy girl. She buried
  her face in a bowl of roses and caressed them tenderly. "If I knew who had
  sent them," I thought, "perhaps it would give me a clue." But what had the
  cryptogram to do with it?</p>

  <p>Suddenly to my surprise she said: "Stay and have dinner with me here, Mr.
  Enderby. I was going to a party, but I will send regrets. I don't want to be
  with any of them! I'm so happy! I would either have to hide it, or explain
  it. I want to be myself for a while."</p>

  <p>I did not require much persuasion. It was like dining in Fairyland! By
  tacit consent we avoided any reference to the case. I shall never forget that
  hour as long as I live. We were alone, for the unpleasant Mrs. Bleecker
  thinking that Miss Hamerton was dining out, had gone off to some friends of
  hers.</p>

  <p>Afterwards I went home to disguise myself, and then proceeded to the
  theatre. I had already photographed the cryptogram, and put the negative in
  my safe. McArdle was lying in wait for me, and I allowed him to drag it out
  of me, that I had not been able to translate it. He collected the stakes in
  high glee.</p>

  <p>The paper was passed from hand to hand until it literally fell to pieces.
  No one could make anything of it of course. I encouraged the talk and helped
  circulate the paper, and watched from behind my innocent pieces of
  window-glass for some one to betray himself. But I saw nothing. The
  conviction was forced on me that I had a mighty clever one to deal with.</p>

  <p>During my long waits I loitered from dressing-room to dressing-room, and
  let them talk. As opportunities presented themselves I quietly searched for
  the first page of that letter, though I supposed it had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Eighteen actors and actresses and a working force of six comprised the
  field of my explorations. However, the fact that punctuation played a part in
  the cryptogram not to speak of the choice of words convinced me that both the
  writer and reader of it must be persons of a certain education, so I
  eliminated the illiterates. This reduced me at one stroke to five men and
  four women. Of these two of the men were obviously too silly and vain to have
  carried out such a nervy piece of work, while one of the women was a dear old
  lady who had been on the stage for half a century, and another was a bit of
  dandelion fluff. These exclusions left me with five, to wit: Roland Quarles,
  George Casanova, Kenton Milbourne, Beulah Maddox and Mary Gray.</p>

  <p>Roland Quarles I have already mentioned. Both he and Casanova were actors
  of established reputations who had been in receipt of handsome salaries for
  some seasons. I scarcely considered them. Milbourne was my dark horse. He was
  a hatchet-faced individual, homely, uninteresting, unhealthy-looking. His
  fancy name sat on him strangely. He looked like a John Doe or a Joe Williams.
  Miss Maddox was a large woman of the gushing-hysterical type; Miss Gray a
  quiet well-bred girl who kept to herself.</p>

  <p>While I concentrated on those named, I did not, however, overlook the
  doings of the others. With all the men I was soon on excellent terms but the
  women baffled me. Women naturally despise a man of the kind I made out to be.
  You can't win a woman's confidence without making love to her, and that was
  out of my line.</p>

  <p>On Thursday night of the week after I joined, Miss Beauchamp, who played a
  maid's part, spoiled a scene of Miss Hamerton's by missing her cue. It was
  not the first offence, and she was fired on the spot. This girl was the bit
  of fluff I have mentioned. The occasion suggested an opportunity to me. There
  was no time to be lost so I went to Miss Hamerton at once. In my humble,
  shabby character I meekly bespoke the part for a "friend." Miss Hamerton was
  startled. She said she would consider it.</p>

  <p>I had no sooner got home that night than she called me up to ask what I
  had meant. I did not want to argue with her over the telephone, so I asked
  her to see me next morning. She said she would come to my office as soon as
  she had breakfasted. Using all my powers of persuasion it took me more than
  an hour to win her consent to my putting a woman operative in the vacant
  part. Not only did I have to have a woman in the company, I told her, but I
  needed an assistant outside. Not by working twenty-four hours a day could I
  track down all the clues that opened up. She would never have given in, I
  believe, had it not been for the mysterious comfort she had found in the
  cryptogram.</p>

  <p>The rehearsal was called for three and I had barely time to get hold of my
  girl.</p>

  <p>This brings me to Sadie Farrell, a very important character in my
  story.</p>

  <p>I had been keeping company with her for a short while. At least I
  considered that I did, though she denied it. She scorned me. That was her
  way. Sadie had always lived at home. Her father and mother were dead now, and
  she lived with her sister. Like all home girls she was crazy to see a bit of
  life. Her heart was set on being a high-class detective. That was the only
  hold I had over her. I had promised her that the first time I had occasion to
  engage a woman operative, I would take her.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Sadie was full of curiosity concerning Miss Hamerton, whose
  praises I was always singing. She was never jealous though. Sadie had a wise
  little head, and she knew the difference between the feeling I had for that
  wonderful woman, and for her darling self.</p>

  <p>Sadie was at home when I got there. "What, you!" she said, making out to
  be bored to death. "I thought I was going to have a peaceful afternoon."</p>

  <p>I couldn't resist teasing her a little. "Cheer up," I said. "I'm going
  right away again. I thought maybe you'd like to come out with me."</p>

  <p>"On a week day!" she said scornfully. "Run along with you, man, I've got
  something better to do."</p>

  <p>"I bet I can make you come," I said.</p>

  <p>She tossed her head. "You know very well you can't make me do
  anything."</p>

  <p>"I bet you a dollar I can make you come."</p>

  <p>She smelled a mouse. "What are you getting at?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to take you to the theatre."</p>

  <p>"It's too late for a matinee."</p>

  <p>"How about a rehearsal?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled. "A rehearsal! Wouldn't that be wonderful! Oh, you're
  only fooling me."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I said, "Miss Hamerton herself invited you."</p>

  <p>"Miss Hamerton! Shall I see her?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. And what's more, you are the person to be rehearsed."</p>

  <p>She simply stared at me.</p>

  <p>"She offers you a small part in her company," I drawled.</p>

  <p>"Me!" said the amazed Sadie. "Why how-how did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"Well you see, I have come to the point where I need an operative in the
  company, and I got her to take you."</p>

  <p>"When is it?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Three o'clock," I said. It was then twenty minutes to.</p>

  <p>Sadie rushed to me and gave my arms a little squeeze. "Oh, Ben, you
  darling fool!" she cried, and ran for her hat before I could follow up my
  advantage.</p>

  <p>On the way down town I coached her in what she must do. She mustn't let it
  be suspected that she had never acted before. She must tell the stage manager
  she had been sent by Mrs. Mendoza, the agent. She must ask forty dollars a
  week and come down to thirty. She must make out that the part was much
  inferior to those she had been playing. After the rehearsal she was to come
  to my office, where Miss Hamerton would meet us, and give her a lesson in
  making up.</p>

  <p>Sadie simply nodded her wise little head like a bird and said nothing.
  Only at the prospect of receiving instruction from the wonderful Irma
  Hamerton herself, did her eyes gleam again. I didn't have time then to tell
  her what she had to know about the case. I let her get out at the station
  nearest the theatre, while I went on to my office. It was safer, of course,
  for me not to appear at the rehearsal as Sadie's sponsor.</p>

  <p>I had no doubt of Sadie's acquitting herself credit-ably. If I had had, no
  matter what my personal feelings were, I would not have employed her in this
  case. But she was as wise as she was pretty. Under those scornful airs she
  was as true as steel and she had the rare faculty of keeping a close tongue
  in her head.</p>

  <p>Sadie had a sort of Frenchy look, long, narrow eyes and pointed chin. This
  just happened to suit the part of the maid in the play. If I had looked a
  month I could not have found a better girl, not to speak of the pleasure I
  anticipated in working side by side with my own girl. Moreover, I was hoping
  by my conduct of the case to force Sadie to admit that I was not quite such a
  bonehead as she liked to make out.</p>

  <p>Everything went off as planned. Sadie I heard, made a good impression at
  rehearsal, and at a nod from Miss Hamerton, the stage manager engaged her.
  Miss Hamerton told me afterwards that Sadie went through the rehearsal like
  an old stager. They arrived at my office separately, and the lesson in making
  up was given. Miss Hamerton laid herself out to be kind to Sadie. I think she
  scented a romance. Anyhow, inside five minutes Sadie was hers body and soul.
  Like me, she would have stopped at nothing to serve her.</p>

  <p>After that I told Sadie all the facts in the case. In her woman's way of
  reasoning she arrived at the same conclusion that I had reached after my
  style.</p>

  <p>"It's the work of a clever gang," she said. "They have put a member,
  perhaps more than one in the company."</p>

  <p>"But what a lot of trouble to take," I objected, "since the necklace was
  not known to be of any great value."</p>

  <p>"Somebody knew."</p>

  <p>"If they knew about blue pearls they must also have known that Mount was
  the only buyer."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they were shipped to India," she said. "I suspect that East Indians
  have forgotten more about pearls than Mr. Mount ever knew."</p>

  <p>The very first time she appeared on the stage, Sadie justified my
  confidence in her powers. Notwithstanding the excitement of making her debut,
  she managed to keep her wits about her. Women are wonderful that way. During
  her only scene on the stage she had to wait at one side for a few minutes.
  While she stood there close to the canvas scene she heard a bit of a
  conversation on the other side of it. Unfortunately she had not been in the
  company long enough to recognise the voices.</p>

  <p>A man said. "Yes, sir, forty thousand dollars."</p>

  <p>"Go way!" was the reply. "How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I saw it entered in his bank book. I was in his dressing- room, and I saw
  it on the table. When he went out I looked in it out of curiosity. He
  deposited forty thousand dollars last week."</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose he got it?"</p>

  <p>"Search me."</p>

  <p>"Some fellows have all the luck, don't they?"</p>

  <p>Then the voices passed out of hearing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE not mentioned Mr. Alfred Mount lately though I saw
  him often on matters connected with the case. He was an interesting
  character. It was only by degrees that I realised what an extraordinary man I
  had to deal with. After our first meeting his manner towards me completely
  changed. He appeared to be sorry for his brusqueness on that occasion. Now he
  was all frankness and friendliness. Nothing crude, you understand, just the
  air of one man of the world towards another. I could not help but feel
  flattered by it.</p>

  <p>While we worked together so amicably the mutual antagonism remained. I
  knew he still resented Miss Hamerton's having employed me without consulting
  him, and I believed that he was working independently. For my part, you may
  be sure, I told him nothing but what I had to. I found no little pleasure in
  blocking his subtle questioning by my air of clumsy innocence. I told him
  nothing about the cryptogram.</p>

  <p>I never called at his office again. Sometimes he dropped into mine, his
  bright eyes wandering all around, but more often I called on him at his
  apartment over the store. For he occupied the second floor of the beautiful
  little building which housed his business. There was however nothing of the
  old-fashioned shop-keeper about his place. I never saw such splendour before
  or since. But it took you a while to realise that it was splendour, for there
  was nothing showy or garish. Everything he possessed was the choicest of its
  kind in the world. Even with my limited knowledge, when I stopped to figure
  up the value of what I saw, I was staggered. I saw enough at different times
  to furnish several millionaires.</p>

  <p>Mount had a strange love for his treasures in which there was nothing of
  the usual self-glorification of millionaires. He had a modest, almost a
  tender, way of referring to his things, of handling them. I learned quite a
  lot about tapestries, rugs, Chinese porcelains, enamels, ivories and gold
  workmanship from his talk. He did not care for paintings.</p>

  <p>"Too insistent," he said. "Paintings will not merge."</p>

  <p>The man was full of queer sayings, which he would drawl out with an eye to
  the effect he was creating on you.</p>

  <p>He never allowed daylight to penetrate to his principal room, a great hall
  two stories high, lined with priceless tapestries.</p>

  <p>"Daylight is rude and unmanageable," he said. "Artificial light I can
  order to suit my mood."</p>

  <p>Another odd thing was his antipathy to red. That colour almost never
  appeared in his treasures. In the tapestries greens predominated; the rugs
  were mostly old blues and yellows. The great room never looked quite the
  same. Sometimes it was completely metamorphosed over night. I understood from
  something he let fall that the other floors of the building were stored with
  his treasures. He had them brought down and arranged according to his fancy.
  The only servant ever visible was a silent Hindoo, who sometimes appeared in
  gorgeous Eastern costume, encrusted with jewels. It occurred to me that that
  was how his master ought to dress. The sober clothes of a business man,
  however elegant, were out of place on Mount. Long afterwards I learned that
  it was his custom when alone to array himself like an Eastern potentate, but
  I never saw him dressed that way.</p>

  <p>One day, to see what he would say, I asked him point blank what was the
  value of Miss Hamerton's lost pearls.</p>

  <p>He consulted a note-book. "She paid me at different times exactly
  twenty-five thousand, seven hundred for them."</p>

  <p>"I know," I said quietly. "But what was their value?"</p>

  <p>He bored me through and through with his jetty eyes before answering.
  Finally he smiled he had a charming smile when he chose, and spread out his
  hands in token of surrender. His hands were too white and beautiful for a
  man's.</p>

  <p>"I see you know the truth," he said. "Well I am in your hands. I hope you
  will keep the secret. Only a great deal of unhappiness could result from its
  becoming known."</p>

  <p>"I shall not tell," I said. "But how much are they worth."</p>

  <p>"I really couldn't say," he said frankly. "There is nothing like them in
  the world, nothing to measure them by, I mean. It would depend simply on how
  far the purchaser could go."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't they be difficult to dispose of?"</p>

  <p>"Very. That is our hope in the present situation."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose the thief knew what he was getting?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. To distinguish the blue cast is a fad of my own. They
  ordinarily go with the black pearls."</p>

  <p>Later he returned to the subject of his own accord. "Since you have
  learned or guessed so much, I should tell you the whole story, for fear you
  might have a doubt of Miss Hamerton."</p>

  <p>"No danger of that," I said quickly.</p>

  <p>He looked at me strangely. I suppose he was wondering if I presumed to
  rival him there. He immediately went on smoothly: "She, of course, has no
  suspicion of the true value of the pearls. Nor does she guess that they were
  in my possession for years. I let her have them one or two at a time. Do you
  blame me?" He spread out his expressive hands again.</p>

  <p>"They are the most beautiful pearls in all the world," he murmured softly,
  "the fruit of all my knowledge and my patience. Pearls in a case are not
  pearls. Only when they lie on the warm bosom of a woman are pearls really
  pearls. I wished to have the pleasure of seeing Irma Miss Hamerton wearing
  them. I could not give them to her. So I devised this innocent deception.
  Wouldn't you have done the same?"</p>

  <p>Maybe I would. Anyhow I didn't feel called upon to argue the matter with
  him, so I kept my mouth shut.</p>

  <p>His long eyes narrowed. "If you had seen her wear the real pearls you
  would understand better," he said dreamily. "They glowed as if with pleasure
  in their situation. Her skin is so tender that the veins give it a delicate
  bluish cast exactly matched by my exquisite pearls!"</p>

  <p>To me there was something, what would you say, something delicately
  indecent, in the way Mount spoke of Miss Hamerton. It made me indignant deep
  down. But I said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I am a fool about precious stones," he went on with that disarming smile.
  "No shop-keeper has any right to indulge in a personal passion for his wares.
  Pearls come first with me, then diamonds. Would you like to see my
  diamonds?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for any answer he disappeared into the next room. I heard
  the ring of a burglar-proof lock. Presently he returned bearing a little
  black velvet cushion on which lay a necklet of gleaming fire.</p>

  <p>"I am no miser," he said smiling. "Quantity does not appeal to me, nor
  mere bigness. Only quality. This is my whole collection, seventy-two stones,
  the result of thirty years' search for perfection."</p>

  <p>I gazed at the fiery spots speechlessly. Before taking this case I had
  never thought much of precious stones. They had seemed like pretty things to
  me, and useless. But upon looking at these I could understand Miss Hamerton's
  reference to her pearls as living things. These diamonds were
  alive-devilishly alive. They twinkled up at Mount like complaisant little
  slaves outvying each other to flatter their master. The sheer beauty of them
  caught at the breast. Their fire bit into a man's soul. Seeing it, I could
  understand the ancient lusts to rob and murder for bits of stone like
  these.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they lovely?" Mount murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, like a snake," I blurted out.</p>

  <p>He laughed. "That feeling seems strange to me. I love them."</p>

  <p>"Put them away!" I said.</p>

  <p>He continued to laugh. He caressed the diamonds with his long, white
  fingers. "Wouldn't you like to see Miss Hamerton wear them?" he asked
  softly.</p>

  <p>"No, by God!" I cried. "She's a good woman."</p>

  <p>He laughed more than ever. It was a kind of Oriental laugh, soft,
  unwholesome. "I'm afraid you suffer from the Puritan confusion of the ideas
  of beauty and evil," he said.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I do," I said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Some other time I will show you my emeralds and sapphires," he said.</p>

  <p>I hated the things, yet I was eager to see them. That shows the effect
  they had on you. I was struck by his omission of rubies.</p>

  <p>"How about rubies?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He shivered. "I do not care for rubies. They are an ugly color."</p>

  <p>I welcomed the chill, raw air of the street after that scented chamber.
  After the elegant collector of jewels my crude and commonplace
  fellow-citizens seemed all that was honest and sturdy. I was proud of them.
  Yet I enjoyed going to Mount's rooms, too. One could count on being thrilled
  one way or another.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS time went on I dismissed the women of the company from my
  calculations though I still kept an eye on them through Sadie. Of the men I
  had most to do with two, Roland Quarles and Kenton Milbourne, the first
  because I liked him, and the second because I didn't.</p>

  <p>Though I had no evidence against him, the idea that Milbourne was the
  thief had little by little fixed itself in my mind. It was largely a process
  of elimination. All the others had proved to my satisfaction one way or
  another that they couldn't have committed the robbery. With the exception of
  Quarles, none of them had the brains to conceive of such a plan, or to hide
  it afterwards. I didn't know if Milbourne had the brains, indeed the more I
  went with him the less I knew. Yet he did not seem to have a guard over
  himself. I laid several ingenious little traps to get a sight of his
  bank-book, but did not succeed in finding out even if he possessed such a
  thing.</p>

  <p>Milbourne was a pasty, hatchet-faced individual, very precise and
  conscientious in his manner, and exceedingly talkative. That was what put me
  off. He talked all the time, but I learned nothing from it. With his sharp,
  foxy features and narrow-set eyes he had the look of a crook right enough,
  but after all looks are not so important as disposition, and this heavy,
  dull-witted, verbose fellow was the epitome of respectability. He was not at
  all popular in the company, principally, I fancy, because of his over-nicety.
  He bragged of the number of baths he took. He was not "a good fellow". He
  never joked nor carried on with the crowd. In the play he took the part of a
  brutal thug, a sort of Bill Sykes, and played it well though there was
  nothing in his appearance to suggest the part. He was the fox, not the
  bull-dog. Imagine a man with the appearance of a fox and the voice of a sheep
  and you have Milbourne.</p>

  <p>Shortly after I joined the company I was allotted to share his
  dressing-room. He told me that he had requested the stage-manager to make the
  change, because he objected to the personal habits of his former roommate. So
  I had every opportunity to observe him. A lot of good it did me. He talked me
  to sleep. He would recite all the news of the day which I had just read for
  myself, and commented on it like a country newspaper. You couldn't stop
  him.</p>

  <p>Roland Quarles I cultivated for a different reason. I did not suspect him.
  As a popular leading juvenile his life for years had been lived in the public
  eye and there was no reason in the world save pure cussedness why he should
  be a thief. I liked him. I was working hard, but one can't be a detective
  every waking minute. I sought out Roland to forget my work. I had started
  disinterestedly with the whole company, but I gradually came to feel an
  affection for Roland, principally because, much to my surprise, he seemed to
  like me.</p>

  <p>I have said he was a morose young man. Such was my first impression. He
  did not make friends easily. He was hated by all the men of the company,
  because he despised their foolish conceit, and took no pains to hide it. But
  the women liked him, I may say all women were attracted to him. He did not
  plume himself on this, it was a matter of great embarrassment to him. He
  avoided them no less than the men.</p>

  <p>He was exceedingly good-looking and graceful, and there was not the
  slightest consciousness of it in his bearing. In that among young actors he
  stood alone. He had a sort of proud, reserved, bitter air, or as a novelist
  would say, he seemed to cherish a secret sorrow. His mail at the theatre was
  enormous. He used to stuff it in his pocket without looking at it.</p>

  <p>I got my first insight into his character from his treatment of me. Of the
  entire company he and Milbourne were the only members who never made my meek
  insignificance a target for unkind wit. Of them all only this high and mighty
  young man never tried to make me feel my insignificance. For a while he
  ignored me, but it seemed to strike him at last that I was being put upon by
  the others, whereupon in an unassuming way he began to make little overtures
  of friendship. I was charmed.</p>

  <p>One night after the show he offered me a cigar at the stage door, and we
  walked down the street smoking and chatting until our ways parted. He was not
  on during the second act, and after my brief scene I got in the habit of
  stopping a while in his room before I went up to change. He had good sense.
  It was worth while talking to him. We became very friendly. He was only a
  year or two younger than I, but to me he seemed like a mere kid.</p>

  <p>One night in the middle of our talk he said: "You're not like an actor.
  You're human."</p>

  <p>"Don't you like actors?" I asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It's a rotten business for men," he said bitterly. "It unsexes them. But
  here I am! What am I to do about it?"</p>

  <p>I learned as I knew him better that the popular young actor,
  notwithstanding the adulation of women or perhaps because of it, led an
  exemplary life. The dazzling palaces of the Great White Way knew him not. It
  was his custom to go home after the show, have a bite to eat in solitude, and
  read until he turned in.</p>

  <p>One night he invited me to accompany him home. He had a modest flat in the
  Gramercy Square neighbourhood with an adoring old woman to look after him.
  The cheerful fire, the shaded lamp, the capacious easy chair, gave me a new
  conception of bachelor comfort. Books were a feature of the place.</p>

  <p>"Pretty snug, eh?" he said, following my admiring eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're not like an actor either," said I.</p>

  <p>He laughed. "After the theatre this is like Heaven!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you chuck it?" I asked. "You're young."</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "Who wants to give an actor a regular job?"</p>

  <p>We had scrambled eggs and sausages. I stayed for a couple of hours talking
  about the abstract questions that young men loved to discuss. When I left he
  was as much of an enigma to me as when I arrived. He was willing to talk
  about anything under the sun except himself. Without appearing to, he foiled
  all my attempts to draw him out.</p>

  <p>Hard upon this growing friendship it was a shock to learn from Sadie as a
  result of her work during the days, that it was Roland Quarles who had
  deposited forty thousand dollars in his bank.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" I said in my first surprise.</p>

  <p>"I got it direct from the bank," she said. "It was the Second National. He
  deposited forty thousand in cash on April Sixth."</p>

  <p>My heart sunk.</p>

  <p>"But that doesn't prove that he stole the pearls," said Sadie. She shared
  my liking for the young fellow.</p>

  <p>"I hope not," I said gloomily. "But if it wasn't he then our promising
  clue is no good."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he won it on the Stock Exchange."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't explain the cash. No broker pays in cash."</p>

  <p>"Well I can think of ten good reasons why he couldn't have done it," Sadie
  said obstinately. She had too warm a heart, perhaps, to make an ideal
  investigator.</p>

  <p>That night Roland asked me home to supper again. This was about a week
  after the first occasion. The old woman had gone to bed and he cooked creamed
  oysters in a chafing-dish, while I looked at the paper.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be nice to have white hands waiting at home to do that for
  you?" I suggested teasingly.</p>

  <p>"Never for me!" he said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"What I can have I don't want. What I want I can never have."</p>

  <p>"You never can tell," I said encouragingly. I was thinking what a superb
  couple the handsome young pair made on the stage. It seemed low to
  cross-examine him while he was preparing to feed me, but there was no help
  for it.</p>

  <p>"The market is off again," I said carelessly. "Chance for somebody to make
  money."</p>

  <p>"How can you make money when the market is going down," he said
  innocently.</p>

  <p>If the innocence was assumed it was mighty well done. However, I told
  myself his business was acting.</p>

  <p>"By selling short," I said.</p>

  <p>"I never understood that operation."</p>

  <p>I explained it.</p>

  <p>"Too complicated for me," he said. "I consider the whole business
  immoral."</p>

  <p>I agreed, and switched to talk of solid, permanent investments. He
  immediately looked interested.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know something about such matters," he said. "Suppose a man
  had a little money to invest, what would you advise?"</p>

  <p>"Your savings?" I asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Lord! I couldn't save anything. No, I have a friend who has a few
  thousand surplus."</p>

  <p>Being anxious to believe well of him I snatched at this straw. Maybe a
  friend had entrusted him with money to invest. Hardly likely though, and
  still more unlikely that it would be handed over in cash. I gave him some
  good advice, and the subject was dropped.</p>

  <p>Later we got to talking about acting again. He said in his bitter way: "I
  shall soon be out of it now, one way or the other."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean to leave the stage at the close of this engagement or before."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"God knows!" he said with his laugh. "Go to the devil, I expect."</p>

  <p>I couldn't get anything else out of him. It was all mysterious enough. He
  sounded utterly reckless when you got below the surface, but somehow it was
  not the recklessness of a crook.</p>

  <p>Worse was to follow.</p>

  <p>First, however, I must put down how the situation stood with Milbourne,
  because I shall not return to him for some time. Kenton Milbourne! I have to
  smile every time I write it, the fancy appellation was so unsuitable to the
  tallow-cheeked, hatchet-faced talker who bore it. I believed Milbourne had
  stolen the pearls, and I worked hard to justify my belief, but without being
  able to lay anything bare against him.</p>

  <p>Every night he talked me to a standstill. He seemed to be a man totally
  devoid of individuality, temperament, a mere windbag. But I told myself that
  dullness is the favourite and most effective disguise of a sharper. His talk
  was a little too dull to be natural, and once in a while I received an
  impression that he was anything but dull.</p>

  <p>One night I said to him as Roland had said to me: "You don't seem like an
  actor. How did you get into this business?"</p>

  <p>"Drifted into it," he said. "Always knew I could act, but was too busy
  with other things. I had an attack of typhoid in Sydney four years ago which
  shattered my health. When I was getting better a friend gave me the part of a
  human monster to play, just to help me pass the time. I made a wonderful hit
  in it. They wouldn't let me stop. Since then I've never been idle. I haven't
  any conceit, so they offer me the horrible parts."</p>

  <p>"Sydney?" I said.</p>

  <p>"I was raised in Australia. I came to America last Fall because there was
  a wider field for my art."</p>

  <p>I put this down in my mind as a lie. I do not know Australia but I suppose
  they have their own peculiarities of speech, and this man talked good New
  York. I asked idly what parts he had played in Australia. He named three or
  four and I made careful mental notes of them. I thought I had him there.</p>

  <p>The next day I consulted old files of an Australian stage paper in the
  rooms of the Actors' Society. To my chagrin I found his name, Kenton
  Milbourne, listed in the casts of the very plays he had mentioned. I was far
  from being convinced of his genuineness, however. I wrote to Australia for
  further information.</p>

  <p>Under cover of my meek and gentle air, I continued to watch him close. I
  could have sworn he was not aware of it, which shows how you may fool
  yourself. His apparent stupidity still blocked me. But one night when he
  lifted the tray of his trunk I saw the edge of a book underneath.</p>

  <p>"Anything good to read?" I said, picking it up before he could stop
  me.</p>

  <p>A peculiar look chased across his face, which was anything but stupidity.
  The title of the book was: "The World's Famous Jewels."</p>

  <p>"Aha! my man!" I thought. I dropped it, saying: "That's not in my
  line."</p>

  <p>This was how matters stood when things began to happen which drove all
  thought of Kenton Milbourne out of my mind.</p>

  <p>The next day Sadie came into the office to report, looking so confoundedly
  pretty that it drove the detective business clean out of my mind for the
  moment. What with her thirty dollars a week from the theatre and her
  additional salary as operative (which Miss Hamerton insisted on her taking)
  Sadie was in affluent circumstances, and for the first time in her life she
  was able to dress as a pretty girl ought. With her Spring hat and suit, her
  dainty gloves and boots, all from the best shops, she was as smart a little
  lady as you'd find from one end of the Avenue to the other.</p>

  <p>"You look sweet enough to eat!" I said, grinning at her like a Cheshire
  cat.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out!" she said with her high and mighty air. "It's business hours.
  I'm operative S.F."</p>

  <p>"What's that for, swell figure?"</p>

  <p>"Wait till after the whistle blows."</p>

  <p>"After hours you're Miss Covington the actress, and I'm not allowed to
  know you."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's Sunday."</p>

  <p>"But this is only Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"I've got to respect my boss, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"What if I kissed you anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"I'd box your ears!" she said quick as lightning.</p>

  <p>And she would. I sighed, and came back to earth. It was not that I was
  afraid of the box on the ears, but she was right, and I knew it. As soon as I
  started that line of talk I resigned my proper place as the boss of the
  establishment.</p>

  <p>"What's new?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I found out something interesting to-day," she said. "Miss Hamerton's in
  love with Roland Quarles."</p>

  <p>"I guessed that long ago," I said calmly.</p>

  <p>Sadie was much taken aback. Evidently she had expected to stun me. "You
  never said anything about it," she said pouting.</p>

  <p>"I left it for you to find out for yourself."</p>

  <p>"She never believed he had anything to do with the robbery," Sadie said
  with a touch of defiance.</p>

  <p>"Then why was she so distressed in the beginning?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there was something that would have looked like evidence to a man,"
  said Sadie scornfully. "So naturally she didn't want to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you?" I asked, a little huffed at the thought that Sadie was
  getting deeper in the confidence of my client than I.</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-day. She didn't tell me about her feelings, of course. I guessed
  that part."</p>

  <p>"What is this mysterious thing?"</p>

  <p>"She only told me because since she saw the cryptogram she knows there
  couldn't be anything in it."</p>

  <p>This was getting denser instead of more clear. "What was there about the
  cryptogram that eased her mind?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"She knows that it couldn't have been written to Roland Quarles because he
  has no idea of leaving the company."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hasn't he!" I thought to myself. How strangely loving women reason.
  Aloud I said: "Now for the thing that a mere man would have considered
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Don't try to be sarcastic," said Sadie. "It doesn't suit you."</p>

  <p>"Who's forgetting that I'm the boss now?" I said severely.</p>

  <p>She made a face at me and went on: "It seems that Miss Hamerton and Roland
  Quarles had a bet on about the pearls."</p>

  <p>This was something new. I pricked up my ears.</p>

  <p>"She laughed at him because he thought he knew something about jewels, and
  she says he scarcely knows a pearl from an opal. They argued about it, and
  she finally bet him a box of cigars against a box of gloves that he wouldn't
  be able to tell when she wore the genuine pearls. That is how she came to
  wear them the night they were stolen."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But he has never spoken about it since. She believes that he has
  forgotten all about the bet."</p>

  <p>I walked up and down the room considering what this meant.</p>

  <p>"You needn't look like that," said Sadie. "We know he didn't do it.
  Wouldn't he have paid his bet if he had?"</p>

  <p>"It seems so," I said. I didn't know what to believe.</p>

  <p>"There's another reason," said Sadie, "sufficient for a woman."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"He's in love with her. He's making love to her now. He couldn't do that
  if he had robbed her."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I said grimly. "If he could rob her, I suspect he could
  make love to her."</p>

  <p>That night at the theatre I devoted my attention pretty exclusively to
  Quarles. God knows I was not anxious to ruin the young fellow, but Sadie's
  communication taken in connection with the cryptogram and that mysterious
  cash deposit was beginning to look like pretty strong evidence. This being my
  first case, I attached more importance to "evidence" than I would now.</p>

  <p>I was in his dressing-room when he left to go on for the third act. He had
  only a short scene at the beginning, and as he went out, he asked me to wait
  till he came off.</p>

  <p>I watched him go with a sinking heart for I hated to do what I had to do.
  He was so handsome, so graceful, and with that burden on his breast, so
  invariably kind to me, I felt like a wretch. Nevertheless, I told myself for
  the sake of all of us I had to discover the painful secret he was hiding.</p>

  <p>I knew exactly how long I had before he would return. I swung the door
  almost shut, as if the wind had blown it, and made a rapid, thorough search.
  There was a pile of letters on his dressing-table as yet unopened. Nothing
  suspicious there. Nothing in the drawers of his dressing-table. There was no
  trunk in the room. His street coat was on a form hanging from a hook. I
  frisked the pockets. There was a handful of letters, papers in the breast
  pocket. Shuffling them over I came upon a sheet of 'dimity' note-paper
  without an envelope. Opening it I beheld a communication in cryptogram
  exactly like the other.</p>

  <p>I could hear the voices on the stage. Roland was about to come off. I
  hastily returned all the papers to his pocket as I had found them, except the
  cryptogram. That I put in my own pocket. When he came in we picked up our
  conversation where we had dropped it.</p>

  <p>As soon as I got home I made haste to translate my find. I had saved the
  numerical key I used before. I instantly found that it fitted this
  communication also. This is what I got:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"I. has known of her loss for a couple of weeks. She has put
  two detectives in the company. Faxon and the girl Covington. I have this
  straight. Watch yourself. J."</p>

  <p><br>
  So this is why Quarles cultivated my friendship! I thought, feeling all the
  bitterness of finding myself betrayed. I could no longer doubt my evidence.
  My friendly feelings for the young fellow were curdled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WOKE up next morning with a leaden weight on my breast. I
  had no zest in the day which bore with it the necessity of telling Miss
  Hamerton what I had learned. I put off the evil moment as long as possible.
  During the morning Sadie came into the office for instructions. I had not the
  heart to tell her. I sent her over to Newark on a wild goose chase in
  connection with some of McArdle's activities.</p>

  <p>I was not expecting Miss Hamerton that afternoon. At three I called her up
  and said that I had something important to report. She said she was expecting
  some one later, and did not want to go out. Could I come to her? This pleased
  me, for since I had to strike her down it was more merciful to do it at home.
  I went.</p>

  <p>She had never looked lovelier. Her room was a bower of Spring flowers, and
  she in a pale yellow dress was like the fairest daffodil among them. She was
  full of happiness, her cheeks glowing, her eyes sparkling. It did not make my
  task any easier. I angrily rebelled from it. But she was already asking me
  what was the matter.</p>

  <p>I told her bunglingly enough, God knows, of the second cryptogram and
  where I had found it. It crushed her like a flower trodden underfoot.
  Presently, however, she began to fight. "The first thing the thief would do
  when he found himself under surveillance," she faltered, "would be to try to
  divert your attention to some one else."</p>

  <p>"He would hardly choose one ordinarily so far above suspicion as the
  leading man," I said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"He may have known, since he knows so much, that you were already
  suspicious of Ro&mdash;of the other." She could not get his name out.</p>

  <p>I felt like the criminal myself, trying to convince her against her heart.
  "Taken by itself the letter would not be conclusive, but with the other
  things..."</p>

  <p>"What other things?"</p>

  <p>"Well, his provoking you by a bet to wear the genuine pearls."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in that," she said quickly "If he had had an ulterior
  motive he would have spoken of the bet since. He would have lost it, wouldn't
  he, to keep us from suspecting?"</p>

  <p>I conceded the reasonableness of this taken by itself. "But his bank
  account?"</p>

  <p>"Bank account?" she repeated, startled. We had not told her of this.</p>

  <p>"On April sixth Mr. Quarles deposited forty thousand dollars in cash in
  the Second National Bank."</p>

  <p>All the light went out of her face. "Oh! Are you sure?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I have seen the entry in his pass-book. I verified it at the bank."</p>

  <p>Her heart still fought for him. "But my necklace was worth only
  twenty-five thousand. And a thief would never be able to realise the full
  value of it."</p>

  <p>I shrugged. Naturally I did not care to add to her unhappiness by telling
  her that the pearls were worth half a million. She thought from my shrug that
  I meant to convey that if her lover had been guilty of one theft, why not
  others?</p>

  <p>It crushed her anew. She had no more fight left in her. She sank back dead
  white and bereft of motion. "He's coming here," she whispered. "What shall I
  say to him? What shall I say?"</p>

  <p>"Don't see him," I cried.</p>

  <p>"I must. I promised."</p>

  <p>I sat there, I don't know for how long, staring at the carpet like a
  clown. The telephone rang and we both jumped as at a pistol shot. I offered
  to answer it, but she waved me back. She went to the instrument falteringly
  but I was surprised at the steadiness of her voice. "What is it?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Let him come up," she said firmly.</p>

  <p>By her stricken white face I knew who it was. I jumped up in a kind of
  panic. "I will have myself carried up to the roof garden so I won't meet
  him," I said.</p>

  <p>"No, please," she murmured. "I want you here."</p>

  <p>"But he must not meet me!" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Wait in the next room." Her voice broke piteously. "Oh, I must have some
  one here some one I can trust!"</p>

  <p>What was I to do? I obeyed very unwillingly. As soon as he entered I found
  that the transom over the door was open, and I could hear everything that
  passed between them. Of all the difficult things that have been forced on me
  in the way of business, that half hour's eavesdropping was as bad as any.</p>

  <p>He must have been highly wrought up because he apparently never noticed
  her state. His very first speech was tragically unfortunate. He spoke in a
  harsh strained voice as if the painful thing he had kept hidden so long was
  breaking out in spite of him.</p>

  <p>"Irma, how soon can you replace me in the cast?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" she murmured. I could imagine the painful start she suppressed.</p>

  <p>"I want to get out. I can't stand it any longer."</p>

  <p>"But why?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I hate acting! It is not a man's work."</p>

  <p>"Have you just discovered it?" she asked with a little note of scorn very
  painful to hear.</p>

  <p>"No," he said gloomily, "I've always known. If I had been left to myself I
  never would have acted. But I came of a family of actors. I was brought up to
  it. I kept on because it was all I knew. It is only since I have acted with
  you that it has become more than I can bear."</p>

  <p>"Why, with me?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Because I love you!" he said in a harsh, abrupt voice.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The sound was no more than a painful catch in her breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't tell me I'm a presumptuous fool," he burst out. "I know
  it already. You don't know the height of my presumption yet. I love you! The
  silly make-believe of love that I have to go through every night with you
  drives me mad! I love you! I am ashamed to make my living by exhibiting a
  pretence of love!"</p>

  <p>"It was your father's profession and your mother's," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"They were the real thing," he said gloomily. "They had a genuine call.
  They loved their work. I hark back to an earlier strain, I guess. I have no
  feeling for art to make it worth while. I hate the tinsel and show and
  make-believe. I want to lead a real life with you!"</p>

  <p>No man has any right to hear another man bare his heart like this. I went
  to the open window and leaned out. I had forgotten Roland's supposed guilt.
  My instinct told me that a guilty man could not have spoken like this.</p>

  <p>Even on the window-sill though I tried not to hear, an occasional word
  reached me. We were so high up that little of the street noises reached us.
  Bye and bye I heard Roland say "money" and I was drawn back into the room.
  This, I felt, it was my business to hear.</p>

  <p>He was still pleading with his heart in his voice.</p>

  <p>"A month ago I would just have left without saying anything to you. I
  don't even know that I am fit for anything else but acting. I could not ask
  you to give it up without having something else to offer you. I suffer so to
  see you on the stage. To see your name, your person, your doings all public
  property drives me wild! I cannot stand seeing you show your lovely self to
  the applause of those vulgar fools!"</p>

  <p>"You are mad!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I know, but I have had a stroke of luck!"</p>

  <p>"Luck?"</p>

  <p>"I have come into some money. Oh, nothing much, but enough to give me a
  start in some new country if you could come with me! Oh, I am a fool to think
  it. But I had to tell you I loved you. You would be quite justified in
  laughing, and showing me the door. But I love you! It seemed cowardly to go
  away without telling you."</p>

  <p>"You are asking me to give up my profession?" she murmured unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I ask nothing. I expect nothing. But if you could! You'd have to give it
  up. It would kill me otherwise. I could stand better having none of you than
  half." He laughed harshly. "Am I not ridiculous? Tell me to go."</p>

  <p>"I am not so enamoured of make-believe either," she murmured.</p>

  <p>She was weakening! I trembled for her. This wretched business had to be
  cleared up before they could hope for any happiness.</p>

  <p>"If I loved you I could give it up," she whispered, "but I am not
  sure."</p>

  <p>It was like a glimpse of Heaven to him. "Irma!" He cried her name over and
  over brokenly. "My dear love! Then there is a chance I never expected! Oh!
  don't raise me up only to cast me down lower than before!"</p>

  <p>I went to the window-sill again and leaned out.</p>

  <p>There I was still when she came in. She was trembling and breathing
  fast.</p>

  <p>"He has gone," she said.</p>

  <p>She led me back into the outer room. She noticed that the transom was
  open. "You heard?" she said startled.</p>

  <p>"Some," I said uncomfortably. "More than I wanted to."</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she said.</p>

  <p>"Have you promised to marry him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I have promised nothing. I asked for time."</p>

  <p>"Good!" I said involuntarily.</p>

  <p>She looked at me startled. "You heard!" she said defiantly. "Were they the
  words of a guilty man?"</p>

  <p>"Not if I know anything about human nature," I said promptly.</p>

  <p>The sweetest gratitude lighted up her face. "Oh, thank you!" she said. She
  was very near tears. Anything else would be unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"Give me one day more," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"No! No!" she cried with surprising energy. "I will not carry this tragic
  farce any further. I hate the pearls now. I would not wear them if I did get
  them back. They are gone. Let them go!"</p>

  <p>"But Miss Hamerton..." I persisted.</p>

  <p>"Not another word!" she cried. "My mind is made up!"</p>

  <p>"I must speak," I said doggedly. "Because you as much as said you depended
  on getting honest advice from me. You can't stop now. If you marry Mr.
  Quarles, the fact that you have suspected him though it was only for a moment
  will haunt you all your life. No marriage is a bed of roses. When trouble
  does come your grim spectre will invariably rise and mock you. It must be
  definitely laid in its grave before you can marry the man."</p>

  <p>The bold style of my speech made her pause. I had never spoken to her in
  that way before. She eyed me frowning.</p>

  <p>"I hope you know it's not the job I'm after," I went on. "I never had work
  to do that I enjoyed less. But you put it up to me to give you honest
  advice."</p>

  <p>"I can't spy on the man I love," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"You can't marry the man you suspect," I returned.</p>

  <p>"I don't suspect him."</p>

  <p>"The suspicious circumstances are not yet explained."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, I'll send for him to come back, and he will explain
  them."</p>

  <p>I had a flash of insight into the character of my young friend. "No!" I
  cried. "If he knew that you had ever suspected him, he would never forgive
  you."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want me to do?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Give me twenty-four hours to produce proofs of his innocence."</p>

  <p>She gave in with a gesture.</p>

  <p>Leaving Miss Hamerton I walked twice around Bryant Square to put my
  thoughts in order. I wished to believe in Roland's innocence almost as
  ardently as she did, but I had to force myself to keep an open mind. A fixed
  idea one way or the other is fatal to any investigator. So I argued against
  him for a while to strike a balance. I told myself there was a type of man
  who would stop at absolutely nothing to secure the woman he desired. In the
  bottom of my heart, like anybody else, I had a sneaking admiration for the
  type.</p>

  <p>True, I had never heard of a man robbing a woman in order to secure the
  means to support her. Still, human psychology is an amazing thing. You never
  can tell! I reminded myself of all the other times I had been brought face to
  face with the apparently impossible. Particularly is human nature ingenious
  in justifying itself.</p>

  <p>I finally made up my mind to search Roland's apartment that night. On my
  previous visits I had marked a little safe there. Surely it must contain some
  conclusive evidence one way or the other. What I hoped to find was some
  natural and honest explanation of the sum of money he had received.</p>

  <p>Around the theatre that night Roland and I were as friendly as usual. The
  shadow was somewhat lifted from his dark eyes. They burned with an expectant
  fire. An extraordinary restlessness possessed him. For all he said he hated
  it, that time anyway, he outdid himself in playing his role. As far as I
  could see, he and Irma held no communications outside the play.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of the plan I had made, I insisted on his supping with me
  that night. I was free to leave the theatre after the second act, so I went
  on ahead to order the supper I said. He was to meet me at the Thespis club at
  half-past eleven. I did order the supper there, then hurried on to his flat,
  arriving some time before his customary hour of coming from the theatre.</p>

  <p>His old housekeeper having seen me in his company on several occasions
  expressed no surprise at my coming. I said I would wait for him, and she left
  me to my own devices in the front room. I satisfied myself that she had gone
  to her own room on the other side of the kitchen, three doors away, then I
  set to work.</p>

  <p>I had brought a bunch of skeleton keys and a set of miniature
  housebreaking tools. I didn't require them, for I found that the little safe
  had one of the earliest and simplest forms of a lock. Part of my
  apprenticeship had been spent in learning how to open such locks merely by
  listening to the fall of the tumblers as one turned the knob. All that was
  required was patience. It was a little after ten. Supposing that Roland
  waited for me at the Thespis club only half an hour, I had two hours in which
  to work. It was painfully exciting. I had my first glimpse of the point of
  view of a housebreaker.</p>

  <p>The safe door swung open at last. I looked inside with a beating heart. It
  contained but little; a diary, which I left for the moment; a wallet
  containing a sum of money, a bundle of papers enclosed by an elastic band. I
  went over the papers hastily; they consisted of insurance policies,
  theatrical contracts and business letters of old dates which had nothing
  whatever to do with my case.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a little locked drawer to investigate. After a
  number of tries I fixed a key that would open it. The first thing I saw was a
  number of pieces of men's jewelry that Roland doubtless used for stage
  properties. The second thing I saw was a beautiful little antique box made of
  some sweet-smelling wood which contained several notes in Irma's handwriting
  and some withered flowers. The third and last thing was a seal leather case
  such as jewellers display. Upon pressing the spring the cover flew back and I
  saw lying on a bed of white velvet a string of wonderful dusky pearls.</p>

  <p>For many moments I gazed at them in stupid astonishment. God knows what I
  expected to find. Certainly not that. What did it mean? It looked just the
  same as the string Miss Hamerton had showed me. I counted them. There were
  sixty-seven pearls. Was it another of Roberts' replicas? Perhaps Roland had
  bought it and stowed it away for sentimental reasons. That seemed pretty far-
  fetched.</p>

  <p>I carried it to the electric light. There I could see the blue cast like
  the last gleam of light in the twilight sky. The bits of stone had a
  wonderful fire, life. An instinct told me they were genuine pearls. But if
  they were it must be the string, for Mount had said there ere no others. I
  remembered that Miss Hamerton had told me she had made a little scratch on
  the clasp and I eagerly looked for it. There was a kind of mark there. At
  this point I shook my head and gave up speculating.</p>

  <p>I slipped the case in my pocket, locked the drawer and locked the safe
  again. I switched off the lights and let myself quietly out of the flat.</p>

  <p>I decided to go to the Thespis club as if nothing had happened. I was not
  at all anxious to meet Roland until I knew where I stood, but I reflected
  that if I failed him it might rouse his suspicions and precipitate a
  catastrophe before I was ready for it. There was not much danger that he
  would look in his safe that night if I kept him late. His housekeeper would
  tell him I had been there, but I could explain that. In the morning I would
  have him watched.</p>

  <p>Roland was at the club when I arrived. "I've been at your rooms," I said
  instantly. "I had an idea I was to wait for you there. But I got thinking it
  over and decided I had made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"You've got a memory like a colander," he said good-naturedly. "Better do
  something about it."</p>

  <p>We sat down to our supper. Roland was in for him, extraordinary spirits.
  All the while we ate, drank and joked I was wondering in the back of my head
  what kind of a change would come over his grim, dark, laughing face if he
  knew what I had in my pocket.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FEW would envy me my task next morning. I called up Miss
  Hamerton merely saying that I would come to the hotel half an hour later.
  Sadie came in, but having kept from her what had already happened, I could
  not tell her this. I was not obliged to tell her all the developments of the
  case, of course, but she had a moral right to my confidence, and so I felt
  guilty and wretched every way. Sadie I knew would be terribly cut up by the
  way things were tending, and I had not the heart to face it, with what I had
  to go through later.</p>

  <p>Miss Hamerton received me with great bright eyes that looked out of her
  white face like stars at dawn. The instant she caught sight of my face she
  said: "You have news?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good or bad?" she whispered breathlessly.</p>

  <p>There was no use beating around the bush. "Bad," I said bluntly.</p>

  <p>A hand went to her breast. "Tell me quickly."</p>

  <p>I drew out the case. She gave no sign of recognising it. I snapped it
  open. "Is this the lost necklace?" I asked.</p>

  <p>With a little cry, she seized upon it, examined the pearls, breathed upon
  them, looked at the clasp. "Yes! Yes!" she exclaimed, joy struggling in her
  face with an underlying terror. "Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"Out of a safe in Mr. Quarles' flat."</p>

  <p>She looked at me, stricken stupid.</p>

  <p>I had to repeat the words.</p>

  <p>"Oh! you would not deceive me?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God it were not true!" I cried.</p>

  <p>"In his room his room!" she muttered. Suddenly she sank down in a crumpled
  white heap on the floor.</p>

  <p>I gathered her up in my arms and laid her on the sofa. I called Mrs.
  Bleecker, who came running, accompanied by Irma's maid. A senseless scene of
  confusion followed. The foolish women roused half the hotel with their
  outcries. I myself, carried the beautiful, inanimate girl into her bedroom.
  For me it was holy ground. It was almost as bare as a convent cell. It
  pleased me to find that she instinctively rejected luxury on retiring to her
  last stronghold. I laid her on her bed the pillow was no whiter than the
  cheek it bore, and returned to the outer room to await the issue. All this
  time, I must tell you, Mrs. Bleecker was relieving her feelings by abusing
  me. From the first I had apprehended hatred in that lady.</p>

  <p>I waited a few minutes, feeling very unnecessary, and wondering if I would
  not do better to return to my office, when Mrs. Bleecker came back, and with
  a very ill grace said that Miss Hamerton wanted to know if it was convenient
  for me to wait a little while until she was able to see me, and would I
  please say whatever was necessary to people who called. I almost wept upon
  receiving this message. I sent back word that I would stay all day if she
  wanted me. Mrs. Bleecker glared at me, almost beside herself with defeated
  curiosity. I had the necklace safe in my pocket and she was without a clue to
  what had happened.</p>

  <p>So there I was established as Miss Hamerton's representative. Everybody
  took orders from me, and wondered who I was. The word had spread like
  wildfire that the famous star had been taken ill, and the telephone rang
  continuously. I finally told the hotel people what to say, and ordered it
  disconnected. I had a couple of boys stationed in the corridor to keep people
  from the door. I sent for two doctors, not that Irma was in any need of
  medical attention, but I wished to have the support of a professional
  bulletin. I told them what I thought necessary. They were discreet men.</p>

  <p>Miss Hamerton had no close relatives, and I could not see the sense of
  sending for any others. I forbade Mrs. Bleecker to telegraph them. In a case
  of this kind solitude is the best, the most merciful treatment for the
  sufferer. As it was I pitied the poor girl having to endure the officious
  ministrations of her inquisitive servants, but I did not feel justified in
  interfering there.</p>

  <p>Only two men were allowed past the guard in the corridor, Mr. Maurice
  Metz, the famous theatrical manager, and Mr. Alfred Mount. The former stormed
  about the room like a wilful child. His pocketbook was hard hit. I was firm.
  He could not see Miss Hamerton, he must be satisfied with my report. Miss
  Hamerton had suffered a nervous breakdown-with that phrase we guarded her
  piteous secret-and it would be out of the question for her to act for weeks
  to come. It was her wish that the company be paid off and disbanded.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I speak for Miss Hamerton," I said with a shrug. I remembered how humbly
  I had besieged this man's door with my play a few weeks since, and now I was
  turning him down.</p>

  <p>To satisfy him I had Mrs. Bleecker in. He demanded of her who I was.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she snapped.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless she had to bear me out. Miss Hamerton had sent word that the
  company was to be paid off with two weeks' salary, and the amount charged to
  her. I referred Mr. Metz to the doctors. They impressed him with medical
  phrases he didn't understand. He finally departed talking to himself and
  waving his hands.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mount, of course, was very different. He came in all suave sympathy,
  anxious to uphold me in every way. I had wished to see him for a special
  purpose. I couldn't allow the possibility of a ghastly mistake being
  made.</p>

  <p>I produced the fateful little seal leather box, and snapped it open again.
  "Are these the lost pearls?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The man had wonderful self-control. No muscle of his face changed. Only
  his black eyes flamed up. He took the case quietly, but those eyes pounced on
  the pearls like their prey, and wolfed them one by one. He returned the case
  to me. A curious smile wreathed the corners of his voluptuous mouth.</p>

  <p>"Those are the pearls," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"You are sure?"</p>

  <p>"Sure?" He spread out his hands. "There are no other such pearls in the
  world." I returned the case to my pocket. "Where did you find them?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"At present I am not free to say how they were recovered," I replied. "No
  doubt Miss Hamerton will give it out later."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," he said with a compassionate air. "I suppose there
  will be no prosecution."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," I said blandly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it would be better never to speak of the matter to her?" he said
  softly.</p>

  <p>I shrugged. I wasn't going to let him get any change out of me.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow it's a triumph for you," he said graciously. "Allow me to
  congratulate you."</p>

  <p>Was there a faint ring of irony in his words? In either case I never felt
  less triumphant. What booted it to return her jewels if I had broken her
  heart? I bowed my acknowledgement.</p>

  <p>As he left he said: "Come and see me sometimes, though the case is closed.
  You are too valuable a man for me to lose sight of."</p>

  <p>I bowed again, mutely registering a resolve to ask him a thumping figure
  if he ever did require my services.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I had the reporters to deal with. I have a strong fellow-feeling
  for the boys. As a class they are the most human lot of fellows I know. They
  do not make the rotten conditions of their business. But they certainly are
  the devil to deal with when they get you on the defensive. They seemed to
  spread through that hotel like quicksilver, bribing the bell-boys, the maids,
  even the waiter who brought up my dinner. If we had not been on the eleventh
  story I should have expected to find them peeping in the windows.</p>

  <p>I did not dare see them myself. In my anomalous position they would have
  made a monkey of me. In my mind's eye I could see the story of the mysterious
  stranger who claimed to represent Miss Hamerton, etc., etc. I had to take
  every precaution, too, to keep them from that fool of a Mrs. Bleecker. I
  carefully drilled the doctors in what they should say, and then sent them
  down to their fate. They came off better than I expected. Of course the lurid
  tales did appear next day, but they were away beside the mark. Nothing
  approaching the truth was ever published.</p>

  <p>A little before five everybody had gone, and I was alone in the
  sitting-room gazing out of the window and indulging in gloomy enough
  thoughts, when I heard the door behind me open. I turned with a sigh,
  expecting fresh complaints and demands from the old harridan. But there was
  Irma trying to smile at me. She was wearing a white negligee affair that made
  her look like a fragile lily. She walked with a firm step, but her face
  shocked me. It looked dead. The eyes open, were infinitely more ghastly than
  when I had laid her down with them closed. Mrs. Bleecker and the maid
  followed, buzzing around her. She seemed to have reached the limits of her
  patience with them.</p>

  <p>"Let me be!" she said as sharply as I ever heard her speak. "I am
  perfectly well able to walk and to speak. Please go back to the bedroom. I
  have business to discuss with Mr. Enderby."</p>

  <p>They retired, bearing me no love in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"I must go away, quite by myself," she said, speaking at random. "Can you
  help me find a place, some place where nobody knows me? If I do not get away
  from these people they will drive me mad!"</p>

  <p>"I will find you a place," I said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'd better not go alone," she said. "If I could only find the
  right kind of person. I'm so terribly alone. That nice girl you brought into
  the company, Miss Farrell, do you think she would go with me?"</p>

  <p>There was something in this more painful than I can convey. "She'd jump at
  the chance," I said brusquely.</p>

  <p>"You have been so good to me," she said.</p>

  <p>"You can say that!" I said, astonished.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've not quite taken leave of my senses," she said bitterly. "If I
  had not known the truth, it would have been much worse."</p>

  <p>This struck me as extraordinary generosity in a woman who loved.</p>

  <p>"I have something else to ask of you," she said in the piteous beseeching
  way that made me want to cast myself at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Anything," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Quarles is coming here at five. Please see him and tell him-Oh! tell
  him anything you like, anything that will keep him from ever trying to see me
  again."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "You had better lose no time in getting out of this," I
  suggested. "Can you be ready by to-morrow morning?"</p>

  <p>"I will start packing now," she said. "It will give me something to
  do."</p>

  <p>How well I understood the hideous blankness that faced her.</p>

  <p>"Don't let those women bother you," I said. "Refer them to me."</p>

  <p>"They mean well," she said.</p>

  <p>"I will answer for Miss Farrell," I said. "She'll be here at nine
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She started to thank me again, but I would not let her go on. I really
  could not stand it.</p>

  <p>"Very well, you will see," she said with a smile, and left me.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards Roland Quarles came striding down the hall. I opened
  the door to him. He was astonished to find a strange man in the room. He did
  not recognise me without my Faxon makeup.</p>

  <p>"Enderby," I said in response to his enquiring glance. "You met me here
  once before."</p>

  <p>"What's this I hear downstairs about Miss Hamerton being sick?" he
  demanded anxiously.</p>

  <p>"She has had a nervous breakdown," I said.</p>

  <p>He was not deceived. "What does that mean?" he demanded. "She was quite
  well yesterday."</p>

  <p>I shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Can I see her?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to Mrs. Bleecker, then."</p>

  <p>"You can't see her, either."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded, as so many others had done.</p>

  <p>I gave him my card, hoping that he would take the hint, and save me
  further explanations.</p>

  <p>Not a bit of it. "Investigator? What does that mean? Detective?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" he cried irritably. "Why are you looking at me like
  a policeman?"</p>

  <p>"Look at me close," I said.</p>

  <p>He stared at me angry and puzzled. "I have seen you before more than
  once." Then his face changed. "Faxon!" he cried. "Is it Faxon?"</p>

  <p>"The same," I said.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>This parade of innocence began to exasperate me. "Do you need to ask?" I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake don't play with words," he burst out. "Tell me
  what's the matter and be done with it."</p>

  <p>"Miss Hamerton's pearl necklace was stolen from the theatre two months
  ago. She engaged me to recover it."</p>

  <p>"Her pearls! Stolen!" he ejaculated, amazed. I could not have asked to see
  it better done.</p>

  <p>"Do you still want me to go on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, drop the mystery!" he cried. "You fellows fatten on mystery!"</p>

  <p>"As Faxon in the theatre I was perfectly sincere in my friendship for
  you," I went on. "I liked you. But little by little, against my will, I was
  forced to believe that you were the thief."</p>

  <p>This touched him, but not quite in the way I expected. "Me? The thief?" he
  gasped and suddenly burst into harsh laughter. "How did you arrive at
  that?"</p>

  <p>I was no longer inclined to spare him. "In the first place you provoked a
  bet with Miss Hamerton which induced her to wear the real pearls on the night
  they were stolen."</p>

  <p>His face turned grave. "True," he said. "I forgot that. What else?"</p>

  <p>"On April sixth you deposited forty thousand dollars in cash in the Second
  National Bank."</p>

  <p>He paled. "Anything more?"</p>

  <p>"Do you care to explain where you got it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not to you," he said proudly. "Go on with your story."</p>

  <p>"My first clue was in the cryptic letter found on the stage."</p>

  <p>"I remember. You couldn't translate it."</p>

  <p>"But I did."</p>

  <p>"What's it got to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. But I found a second letter written in the same cryptogram and
  about the same matters in your pocket."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" he said.</p>

  <p>"If you want to see it it's at my office."</p>

  <p>"If you did find such a paper in my pocket it was planted there."</p>

  <p>"I should be glad to believe you were not the man," I said mildly.</p>

  <p>"Spare me your assurances," he said scornfully.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a while, thinking over what I had told him. Slowly
  horror grew in his face. "But but this is only a devilish combination of
  circumstances," he stammered. "You haven't proved anything."</p>

  <p>"The pearls have been recovered," I said.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he shot at me.</p>

  <p>"In your safe."</p>

  <p>His legs failed him suddenly. He half fell in a chair, staring at me
  witlessly. "Oh, my God!" he muttered huskily. "Those, hers!"</p>

  <p>I believe I smiled.</p>

  <p>"And you you have told her this story?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"That's what I was engaged for."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" he reiterated blankly. "What shall I do!"</p>

  <p>His agony was genuine enough. In spite of myself I was moved by it.
  "Better go," I said. "The matter will be hushed up, of course."</p>

  <p>"Hushed up!" he cried. "Never!"</p>

  <p>This theatrical pretence of innocence provoked me afresh. "Oh, get out!" I
  said. "And be thankful you're getting off so easily!"</p>

  <p>He paid no attention to me. "I must see her," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to gain by bluffing now?" I said impatiently. "You
  must see that the game is up."</p>

  <p>"I will not leave here without seeing her," he said with a kind of dull
  obstinacy.</p>

  <p>"You have me at a disadvantage," I said bitterly. "You know I can't have
  you thrown out without causing a scandal."</p>

  <p>He scarcely seemed to hear me. "I will go when she sends me," he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"All right, my patience is equal to yours," I said.</p>

  <p>So there we sat, he with his ghastly white face turned towards the door
  into the inner rooms, moistening his lips from time to time, I looking out of
  the window.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, Mrs. Bleecker came clucking in. She, knowing
  nothing, fell on Quarles' neck, so to speak, and told him all her troubles
  with sidelong shots at me.</p>

  <p>He paid little attention to her vapouring, only repeating in his ghastly,
  blank way: "I must see Irma."</p>

  <p>"Of course!" said Mrs. Bleecker. "I'll tell her you're here."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bleecker, as a friend, I advise you not to interfere," I said
  sternly.</p>

  <p>She went out, flouncing her skirts at me.</p>

  <p>To my surprise, Miss Hamerton presently came in. I cannot say what led her
  to do it, perhaps she was hoping against hope that he could defend himself.
  There was no sign of weakness in her now. Her face was as composed as marble.
  Mrs. Bleecker did not return.</p>

  <p>"Irma," he cried, "send this fellow away."</p>

  <p>I made haste to go, but she kept me. "Mr. Enderby must stay," she said.
  "He is your friend," she added.</p>

  <p>He made a gesture of despair. A hideous silence descended on the three of
  us.</p>

  <p>"You asked to see me," she said at last.</p>

  <p>"Irma, do you believe this of me?" he cried like a soul out of Hell.</p>

  <p>"I am willing to hear anything you have to say," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"What does evidence matter?" he cried. "Do you believe me capable of such
  a thing?"</p>

  <p>"Am I not forced to?" she said very low.</p>

  <p>His head dropped. I never saw such hopeless wretchedness in a man's face.
  I felt like an executioner.</p>

  <p>"Speak up!" I said sharply. "We are anxious to believe in you."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It doesn't matter," he said in a stifled voice. "I
  doubt if I could clear myself. Anyway I shan't try. It it is killed!"</p>

  <p>He bent a look of fathomless reproach on her. "Goodbye, Irma," he said
  quietly. "I'm glad I was the means of your getting your jewels back. I never
  knew they had been stolen."</p>

  <p>This to me was the purest exhibition of cheek I had ever met with. I was
  hard put to it to keep my hands off the man. If she had not been there! He
  went. And when I turned around Irma had gone back into the next room. I was
  angry through and through, and yet and yet! A nagging little doubt teased
  me.</p>

  <p>So ended, as I thought, the case of the blue pearls. Little did I suspect
  what was on the way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following day was a blue one for me, deprived of all the
  exciting activities of the past few weeks I was at a loss what to do with
  myself. Moreover, I was dissatisfied with the result of those activities. I
  had won out, so to speak, but my client had not. For her only tragic
  unhappiness had come of it. Meanwhile that little inner voice continued to
  whisper that I had not got to the bottom of the case. I could not put that
  young fellow's amazed and despairing face out of my mind. It did not fit into
  the theory of his guilt. On top of it all I had had a quarrel with Sadie the
  night before.</p>

  <p>About noon my uncomfortable thoughts were broken into by the entrance of
  Sadie herself with storm signals flying, to wit: a pair of flashing blue eyes
  and a red flag hoisted in either cheek. I had supposed that she was already
  on the way to Amityville with Miss Hamerton, where they were to stay at a
  sanatorium conducted by a doctor friend of mine.</p>

  <p>Before I could speak she exploded like a bomb in my office. "Ben, you've
  been a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" I said, blinking and looking precious like one, I expect.</p>

  <p>She repeated it with amplifications.</p>

  <p>"So you said last night," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"But I hadn't seen her then."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to the country?" I asked, hoping to create a
  diversion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, at two o'clock. But I had to see you first."</p>

  <p>"To tell me what you thought of me?"</p>

  <p>"To beg you to do something."</p>

  <p>"What is there to do?"</p>

  <p>"You have made a hideous mistake! Ruined both their lives!"</p>

  <p>I may have had my own doubts, but it wouldn't have been human to confess
  them in the face of an attack like this. "Easy, there!" I said sulkily. "Have
  you discovered any new evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, evidence!" she cried scornfully. "I know he couldn't have stolen her
  pearls, and in your heart you know it, too."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," I said sarcastically, "but in conducting my business I have to
  consult my head before my heart."</p>

  <p>"I know it!" she said bitterly. "That's why you've been a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Well, next time I'll consult a clairvoyant."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't try to be clever! It's too dreadful! If you had seen her! She
  will never act again. And he! he will likely kill himself, if he has not
  already done it."</p>

  <p>This struck a chill to my breast. Sadie had an intuitive sense that I
  could not afford to despise. At the same time having been called a fool, I
  couldn't back down.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what better he can do," I said hardily.</p>

  <p>"You can say that!" she said aghast. "You don't mean it!"</p>

  <p>A very real jealousy made me hot. That handsome young blackguard had all
  the women with him. "Are you in love with him, too?" I asked
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>It was a mistake. She had me there. "You're doing your best to make me,"
  she retorted.</p>

  <p>"What are you abusing me for?" I complained. "I did no more than what I
  was engaged to do."</p>

  <p>"She was distracted!" said Sadie. "She couldn't think for herself. She
  depended on you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I did the best I could for her," I said doggedly. "You seem to
  think that I enjoyed doing it. There is a perfect case against him."</p>

  <p>"There is not!" she said quickly. "Your own evidence that you set such a
  store by is full of holes!"</p>

  <p>I invited her to point them out.</p>

  <p>"One of your points against him is that he lately came into possession of
  a lot of money, presumably the proceeds of the theft. Yet you found the
  pearls on him, too. One fact contradicts the other."</p>

  <p>"How do I know what other activities he's been engaged in?"</p>

  <p>"You do not believe that."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," I said stiffly. "Permit me to know my own
  beliefs."</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't true it wouldn't anger you."</p>

  <p>"I am not angry." I smiled to prove it.</p>

  <p>"How can I talk to you if you act like such a child!" cried Sadie.</p>

  <p>"Never mind my actions. Stick to his."</p>

  <p>"You know very well that he could not have carried out several successful
  robberies without a lot of experience. His whole open life gives the lie to
  that. Have we not gone into every part of it?"</p>

  <p>"I know I found the pearls on him," I said doggedly. "They could not very
  well have been planted in a locked drawer in his own safe. He did not even
  claim that they were."</p>

  <p>She ignored this. "And that cryptogram," she went on, "I mean the first
  one. It didn't say so in so many words, but the inference was unmistakable
  that Miss Hamerton's pearls had been disposed of, and that part of the
  proceeds was waiting for the thief. How do you account for that?"</p>

  <p>I did not try to account for it. I pooh-poohed it. "He convicted himself,"
  I insisted. "We invited him, we begged him to explain. He could not."</p>

  <p>"Would not, you mean."</p>

  <p>"What's the difference?"</p>

  <p>She favoured me with an extraordinary glance of scorn. "And you set up to
  understand human nature!"</p>

  <p>"Well, let me have your understanding of it," I said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"He was in love with her," said Sadie. "I suppose you don't question
  that."</p>

  <p>"No, strange as it seems, I believe he was in love with her."</p>

  <p>"That makes goose eggs of all your fine reasoning! Reason all night and it
  wouldn't make sense. He might have stolen anybody else's pearls but never
  hers. It was she who wronged love in believing that he could. To find out
  that she suspected him killed his love dead. Losing that, what did he care
  about his reputation? If he does away with himself it will be not because he
  was accused of a theft, but because she killed his trust in her, and he
  doesn't care to live without it."</p>

  <p>I listened to all this with an affected smile of superiority, but it
  reached me. Every word that the unhappy Quarles had uttered fitted in with
  Sadie's theory.</p>

  <p>"Suppose some one accused you of stealing Miss Hamerton's purse to buy me
  a present," she went on, artfully changing her tone. "I would make a
  tremendous virtuous fuss, of course, but in my heart I couldn't love you any
  less, though you might not have the sense to know it. But if they said you
  had stolen my purse to buy me something, how I would laugh! It's too silly
  for words."</p>

  <p>I was rapidly weakening, but it was damnably hard to own up.</p>

  <p>"The same with this case. You think I'm in love with Quarles because I
  defend him. That's just like a man! The truth is, what hurts me is to see you
  deceive yourself, and then look fatuous about it."</p>

  <p>She was now wielding a double-edged sword. "But if the woman who loves him
  was deceived, surely I have some excuse," I said meekly.</p>

  <p>"That's the weakness of her character or the penalty of her position,
  whichever you like. She is so surrounded by flattery and meanness, it has
  taught her to suspect even her lover."</p>

  <p>"But how did the pearls get in his safe?" I cried, begging for mercy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It's a mystery. I'm only trying to show you that you
  haven't solved the mystery yet." Once more she changed her tone, the witch!
  "I'm so keen to have you make a great success of the case, Ben. And to help a
  little."</p>

  <p>That completed the rout of my forces. "Sadie, darling," I cried. "In my
  heart I feel the same as you. I would have given in at once if you hadn't
  begun by slapping my face!"</p>

  <p>There was a little private interlude here. Boss and operative were lost
  sight of.</p>

  <p>"Now let's get to work!" I said.</p>

  <p>"I hope it's not too late!" she said sadly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HASTENED down to Quarles' rooms near Gramercy Square. I
  found his old housekeeper in tears. My glimpse beyond her showed me that the
  place was partly dismantled. I found that she was half-heartedly packing. She
  did not know me without my Faxon makeup, and refused any information. I
  suspected that she had been forbidden to speak. However, by adroit and
  sympathetic questioning, and because the poor old soul was bursting with her
  troubles, it finally came out with a rush. She thought her master had lost
  his mind, he had acted so strangely, but such was her awe of him, she had not
  dared question his commands.</p>

  <p>All night long he had paced his bedroom and sitting-room, pausing only to
  burn papers and cherished mementos in the grate. When she had risen from her
  bed and timidly enquired if he were ill, he had harshly ordered her back to
  her room. There she had lain trembling until morning, grieving because she
  thought she had offended him.</p>

  <p>He had left his breakfast untasted. Afterwards he had called her to him,
  and in a voice and manner totally unlike his own, had announced that he was
  going away, and had given her instructions that terrified her. His furniture
  was to be sent to an auctioneer's under an assumed name, and was to be put up
  on the first sale day. She was to keep what it brought in lieu of wages. His
  clothes were to be sent to the Salvation Army. His jewelry and knick-knacks
  she might sell or keep as she chose. On second thoughts he had written out
  his instructions in the form of a letter to her in case any of her acts
  should be questioned. He had then called a taxi from the stable he usually
  patronised, and had departed without any baggage. This last fact alarmed her
  more than all the rest.</p>

  <p>All this read fatally clear. I was careful, however, to make light of it
  to the grief-stricken old woman. I assumed an authority which she willingly
  deferred to. I ordered her to put the rooms in order, and not to make any
  other move until she heard from me again. She was vastly cheered. What she
  dwelt on most tragically was the necessity of sending all his beautiful suits
  to the ragged crew who profited by the Salvation Army's benefactions.</p>

  <p>I found out from the taxi stable that Quarles had been driven to the
  Pennsylvania station. I got hold of his driver, a man frequently employed by
  him. He had remarked his strange appearance this morning. On reaching the
  station Quarles had asked the porter who opened the cab door what time the
  next train left for Baltimore. On learning that he had but three minutes to
  catch it, he had thrust a bill in the chauffeur's hand, and rushed away. This
  had been at ten o'clock; it was now nearly one. I had the same driver carry
  me to the station, where I telephoned Sadie, snatched a bite to eat, and
  caught the next express South.</p>

  <p>It was not the most cheerful journey I have taken. I had four hours to
  think over the tragic possibilities of my mistake, and it was small comfort
  to reflect that it was a natural mistake. Quarles, with his three hours'
  start had only too much time to put his purpose into effect. My only hope was
  that he might instinctively be led to wait until night. Darkness has an
  invincible attraction for desperate souls.</p>

  <p>Arriving in Baltimore I had the whole wide city to choose from, and not a
  clue. No chance of anybody's having marked him in the crowd that left the
  train there. However, I happened to know of a certain select hotel invariably
  patronised by the elite of the profession, and I went there on a chance. The
  clerk I saw did not know Mr. Quarles, but upon my describing him he said that
  such a young man had been in the hotel during the afternoon. He was not
  registered there. He recollected him because he had stopped at the desk to
  ask an unusual question. Did the clerk know where there was a taxidermist in
  town? Together they had looked up an address in the business directory, and
  the young man had departed. He had not returned.</p>

  <p>I hastened to the taxidermist's wondering greatly what could have been
  Quarles' errand in such a place. Casting back in my mind, I remembered having
  seen several little cases of mounted butterflies among his treasures. There
  was something pathetically innocent in the wide open trail the young fellow
  was leaving behind him. This surely was no experienced criminal.</p>

  <p>The store was kept by a benignant old man who somehow seemed to belong
  with the stuffed birds and pet dogs that lined the walls of his little place.
  I also saw many little frames of impaled beetles and butterflies such as I
  had seen in Quarles' rooms. The entire place had an old world look.</p>

  <p>The old fellow was a kindly, garrulous soul who required not the slightest
  pressure to set him talking. Quarles, it appeared, had made quite an
  impression on him. "A handsome young fellow!" he said, "and such a
  gentleman." Quarles, he said, had been attracted into his shop by the
  butterflies, and they had fallen into talk about butterfly hunting, of which
  sport both were devotees. Quarles had finally purchased three beautiful
  specimens of something with a terrible Latin name.</p>

  <p>As he was about to leave, Quarles had remarked that he was on his way out
  of town for a jaunt, and he had neglected to provide himself with any
  cyanide. It seems that cyanide is what they use to kill the insects. In all
  innocence the old man had furnished it, and his customer with one more
  question had departed. Where was there a second hand clothes dealer?</p>

  <p>Cyanide of potassium, deadliest of poisons! I hastened to the second hand
  store with a sickness at the heart.</p>

  <p>They remembered Quarles here, too. The story he had told here was that he
  wanted some worn old clothes to wear to a masquerade. He had been furnished
  with a complete outfit, hat, suit, shirt, socks and shoes. While things were
  being wrapped up, he had mentioned idly that he was a stranger in town, and
  he had a couple of hours to kill. He wanted to know of a trolley line that
  would take him out in the country. The storekeeper had recommended the
  Annapolis short line as the pleasantest ride on a mild evening.</p>

  <p>This had been about four, and it was now a little after six. I had caught
  up on him a little. I found that the cars left for Annapolis every half hour.
  By good luck the car which had left at four returned while I was waiting in
  the station. I interviewed the conductor. He remembered Quarles. His
  attention had been attracted to him because, although he held a ticket to
  Annapolis, he had suddenly risen and left the car at the Severn river bridge
  station. I took the six-thirty car for Annapolis. The conductor told me that
  the station at the bridge was used principally by summer residents who had
  their motor boats meet them here. At this season, early in May, there was but
  little business there. It was almost dark when I got off, a balmy, Spring
  evening. It was a lonely-looking spot. There was a little settlement up a
  hill, with a path from the station, but I guessed that if my man had been
  attracted by the loneliness of the situation, he would not go that way. I
  looked about. Crossing the track and climbing down to a deserted strip of
  beach beside the wide river, I found with my flashlight that a solitary
  person had gone that way before me. He was wearing a shapely shoe. This would
  surely be he. The tracks drew me along beside the river towards its mouth,
  which was in view. On the other side, farther down, sparkled the lights of
  the Naval Academy.</p>

  <p>Rounding a point, in a little cove hidden from the world, I found the
  remains of a fire on the sand. The embers were still glowing. Poking among
  them I found scraps of scorched felt and woollen cloth and bits of broken
  glass. Here obviously, Quarles had changed his clothes, and had destroyed the
  expensive garments he wore to the scene. Evidently he was counting on the
  fact that there is little trouble taken to establish the identity of a poorly
  dressed suicide. The glass was no doubt what remained of the case of
  butterflies he had bought. Some coins in the ashes added their mute testimony
  of his desperate intention.</p>

  <p>I hurried on. The footprints recommenced beyond the fire, their shape
  somewhat altered, for he had changed his shoes with the rest. His fine shoes
  he must have filled with stones and thrown in the river for I found no
  remains of leather in the fire. I hoped that with the time he had spent doing
  all this he would now be but a short distance ahead of me. Unfortunately half
  a minute-half of that-would be enough for him to accomplish his purpose.</p>

  <p>I came to the main road from Baltimore to Annapolis which crosses the
  Severn by another long bridge. Automobiles crossed it at intervals. Since the
  footprints were not resumed in the sand across the road it was clear he had
  turned into it one way or the other. The river seemed likeliest. I started
  out on the bridge, dreading most of all to hear a splash just out of my
  reach. It was now quite dark.</p>

  <p>Out in the middle of the bridge close to the draw I came upon a
  motionless, slouching figure with battered hat pulled down over the face.
  Notwithstanding the shapeless clothes the tall slenderness was unmistakable.
  He was leaning with his elbows on the guard rail regarding something that he
  held in one hand. The object caught a spark from the red light of the draw
  overhead. It was the vial of cyanide. My heart bounded with relief. I was in
  time but barely.</p>

  <p>"Quarles," I said softly.</p>

  <p>He straightened up with a terrified hissing intake of the breath. I turned
  the flashlight on myself to save lengthy explanations.</p>

  <p>"You" he said after a moment, in a low bitter tone. "God! must you dog me
  here!"</p>

  <p>"I am your friend," I said.</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Friend!" he said. "That's good!" Then his tone changed.
  "You'd better be on your way," he said threateningly. "I'm in no mood for
  fooling."</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to overtake you since noon," I said, merely to be saying
  something. An instinct told me there was nothing like a little conversation
  to let down a desperate man.</p>

  <p>"Why, in God's name?" he demanded. "What good am I to you now?"</p>

  <p>"I no longer believe you guilty."</p>

  <p>"I don't give a damn what you believe."</p>

  <p>"I want you to help me find the thief."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to me who took the pearls. She's got 'em back again. You'd
  better go on. I won't stand for any interference."</p>

  <p>"You won't do it now," I said confidently.</p>

  <p>"Won't I!"</p>

  <p>He made a move to uncork the little vial. I struck his wrist and it fell
  to the ground. We searched for it frantically in the dark. I had the light,
  and I saw it first. I put my heel on it, and ground the fragile, deadly thing
  into the planks of the bridge floor. He cursed me.</p>

  <p>"There is still the water," I said.</p>

  <p>"I'm a swimmer," he said sullenly. "I couldn't go down. I meant to climb
  on the rail and take the stuff, so it would look like drowning. But there are
  plenty of ways."</p>

  <p>"Be a man and live!" I said.</p>

  <p>He laughed again. "There's nothing in that cant for a man who's sick of
  the game."</p>

  <p>"Live for her sake," I hazarded. "She loves you."</p>

  <p>"You've mistaken your job, old man," he said with grim amusement. "You
  ought to be a playwright. Write her a play. She's a great actress. Yah! I'm
  sick of it! Love! There's no such thing. Not in women! This is real,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>I had got him talking. Something told me the crisis was past. I took a new
  tack.</p>

  <p>"She certainly has treated you badly," I said. "I don't wonder you're
  sore. I know just how you feel."</p>

  <p>He turned on me with clenched fist and a furious command to be silent.
  "It's no damned policeman's business what I feel!"</p>

  <p>"Revenge is sweet," I murmured.</p>

  <p>It brought him up all standing. In the dark I heard him breathing
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to crawl away like a cur and die in a hole?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why in Hell can't you let me alone?" he said fretfully. "What do you want
  to drag me back for?"</p>

  <p>I saw I had him going now. "Make her suffer," I urged. "The most perfect
  revenge in the world is yours if you want it, because she loves you."</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?"</p>

  <p>"Prove your innocence to her."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if I could," he said weakly. "I shouldn't know how to begin. I
  seem to be caught in a net."</p>

  <p>"I am offering to help you."</p>

  <p>"What's your game?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I've made a serious mistake," I said. "I've got my professional
  reputation to think of. Besides, I'm only human. I don't want to have your
  untimely end on my conscience."</p>

  <p>"It needn't be. I'm my own master."</p>

  <p>I decided to risk all on one throw. I laid a hand on his shoulder. "Look
  here," I said frankly. "You and I are not strangers. We took to each other
  from the first, though I happened to be wearing a disguise. I have suffered
  like the devil all day. Forgive me my part in yesterday's affair, and be my
  friend. Friendship isn't such a common thing in spite of all the talk about
  it. I should think you'd recognise the real thing when it's offered to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he grumbled. "I don't believe in friendship. I never had a real
  friend." But he didn't shake my hand off.</p>

  <p>"Try me."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, you've spoiled it for tonight, anyway. I'll listen to what
  you've got to say. Where can we go? I haven't a cent. And nothing but these
  filthy rags."</p>

  <p>"That's a trifle," I said joyfully. "I'll find a place."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE proceeded on across the bridge into the town of
  Annapolis. First I took Roland to a lunch room and commanded him to eat. I
  had a time getting him to swallow the first mouthful, but that once down, he
  developed a ravenous appetite. I suppose he had not eaten in thirty hours. It
  was comical to see how, with a stomachful of hot food inside him, a zest in
  living renewed itself. The more his resolution weakened, the louder he
  inveighed against life. But he had a sense of humour. He suddenly became
  conscious of the absurdity of his attitude, and we laughed together. From
  that moment he was safe, and he was mine. There is nothing to cement a
  friendship like laughter.</p>

  <p>Afterwards I got a room in an obscure hotel. Roland sat down on the edge
  of the bed, and proceeded to give me his version of the matters that
  perplexed me so. In the middle of a sentence he fell over and slept like a
  dead man. I stole out and telegraphed Sadie at Amityville that I had him safe
  and sound. Returning, I sat by the hour watching him. My heart was soft for
  the human creature I had snatched from the brink. He looked very boyish and
  appealing as he lay sleeping. He seemed years younger than I. I cannot tell
  you how glad I was to think that there was warmth in the young body, and
  sentience under the shut lids.</p>

  <p>Shortly after midnight he awoke as suddenly and thoroughly as he had
  fallen asleep. Then he wanted to talk. He was bursting with talk. I swallowed
  my yawns and set myself to listen. I let him talk in his own way, no
  questions. For a long time I listened to what I already knew, the tale of his
  jealous, hopeless passion for Irma. Sometimes he had suspected that she
  inclined towards him, but it seemed preposterous to ask her to give up her
  profession for him. On the other hand he knew he could not endure sharing his
  wife with the public. He had decided to go away without speaking and then the
  miraculous legacy had dropped from the skies.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about that," I commanded.</p>

  <p>"I promised not to tell," he said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter of life and death. Why was a promise exacted?"</p>

  <p>"To avoid publicity."</p>

  <p>"There will be none," I said. "I pledge myself to guard the secret as well
  as you could."</p>

  <p>"I destroyed the letter I got, with the others," he said. "But I read it
  so often I can give it to you almost word for word."</p>

  <p>"Too bad it was destroyed!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can verify the contents by the Amsterdam Trust Company who paid
  me the money."</p>

  <p>"But if you have a clear case what did you run for?" I asked amazed.</p>

  <p>"You will never understand," he said with a wry smile. "I seemed to die at
  that moment when I saw that Irma believed I was capable of robbing her. What
  did I care about my case?"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, my opinion of Sadie's perspicacity went up marvellously. "Go
  on," I said.</p>

  <p>I took down the letter from his dictation. It was written, he said, on
  expensive note-paper, without address, crest or seal, in a large and somewhat
  old-fashioned feminine hand.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Quarles</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">Although you have never heard of me I think of you as my
  dearest friend. I have followed your career from the time of your first
  appearance on the stage. I am one of those unfortunates who, condemned to
  live, are cut off from life. I watch life pass from behind my iron screen. It
  is you who, all unconscious, have supplied me with a dream to cheat my
  emptiness. I have warmed my cold hands at your fire.</p>

  <p class="letter">Now they tell me my release is at hand. I wish to show my
  gratitude to you in the only way that is possible to me. An artist's career
  is difficult and uncertain. I want to remove a little of the uncertainty from
  yours.</p>

  <p class="letter">I must avoid giving rise to silly gossip which would grieve
  my relatives. To avoid the publicity of probate I am making secret
  arrangements beforehand. An old friend will carry out my wishes for me when I
  am gone.</p>

  <p class="letter">The doctors give me a week longer. Upon my death this
  letter will be mailed to you. You will then hear from the Amsterdam Trust
  Company that a sum of money awaits your order. You will never know my name.
  But if you should let even the bare facts become known, some busybody would
  eventually connect them with my name, and unhappy gossip result. Therefore I
  ask you as a man of honour to keep the whole transaction locked in your
  breast."</p>

  <p><br>
  "That is all," said Roland. "It was signed: 'Your grateful friend.'"</p>

  <p>"Did you look in the recent obituaries for a clue?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he confessed. "There was none."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead with your story. We'll return to the letter later."</p>

  <p>"At first I thought it was a hoax," he resumed, "but sure enough, in two
  or three days I received a letter from the Trust Company asking me to call. I
  saw the President. He said that the sum of forty thousand dollars had been
  deposited with them to be turned over to me in cash. He said it had been
  bequeathed to me by one who desired to remain unknown. He said he did not
  know himself who my benefactor was. He had dealt with a lawyer. He said that
  there was but one condition attached to the legacy, namely that I give my
  word never to speak of the matter. I had met this Mr. Ambler the president,
  and he had seen me act, so there was no difficulty about identifying me. I
  left his office carrying the money, and carried it to my own bank to deposit.
  That is all there is to that."</p>

  <p>"Good!" I said. "The Amsterdam Trust Company is a solid institution, and
  the president a well-known man. They will still be there if we need
  them."</p>

  <p>"It mustn't get in the newspapers," he said nervously.</p>

  <p>"Trust me for that. I'm not going to make you break your word. Now about
  the bet you made with Miss Hamerton."</p>

  <p>He winced at the sound of her name. "There's no more in that than appears
  on the surface," he said irritably. "I couldn't have told the paste from the
  genuine. I wanted to give her a box of gloves. But she never claimed them,
  and I forgot about it."</p>

  <p>"The cryptogram you have already explained," said I.</p>

  <p>"I did not know there was such a paper in my pocket. Hold on," he cried
  suddenly, "about that bet. I have just remembered that I once had a talk
  about precious stones, pearls, with a man in the company."</p>

  <p>"Milbourne?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he took them. But it's going to be a job to prove it."</p>

  <p>"It was just a trifling conversation," Roland resumed, thinking hard. "I
  can't remember exactly. He marked the beauty and oddity of Miss Hamerton's
  necklace. I think he said he hoped that she did not risk wearing real pearls
  on the stage. That may have been to find out if I knew they were artificial.
  I told him she did not wear the real ones. There was more talk. He seemed to
  know about pearls, and I believe I asked him how to tell the real from the
  artificial. I never thought of it then, but looking back I see that it may
  have been that talk which gave me the idea of making a bet with her. Oh, I
  have been a fool!"</p>

  <p>"This is all interesting," I said, "but it doesn't give us anything solid
  to go on. Now for the main thing. How did the real pearls get in your
  safe?"</p>

  <p>Roland struck his forehead. "I have been everybody's dupe!" he
  groaned.</p>

  <p>"It's a part we all have to play occasionally," I said soothingly. "Go
  ahead."</p>

  <p>"About this time I began to get circular letters from a firm of jewellers
  called Jones and Sanford with an address on Maiden Lane, where all the
  jewellers used to be. They were facsimile letters, very well written."</p>

  <p>"The kind that are made to look like personal letters, but like false
  teeth, deceive nobody?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. I got one every few days. They were all to the effect that the
  writers as brokers, were prepared to sell precious stones at prices much
  under those asked by the big jewellers. There was a lot of rigmarole about
  saving on overhead charges, interest on valuable stocks and so on, about what
  you would expect in such letters. There were a lot of imposing- looking
  references, too."</p>

  <p>"At first I paid no attention to the letters; precious stones didn't
  interest me. But when I got all that money I began to read them. You see I-I
  wanted to make Irma a present, and I knew she loved pearls better than
  anything else in the world."</p>

  <p>I let a whistle of astonishment out of me. "Do you mean to say you bought
  Miss Hamerton's pearls with the idea of presenting her with them, to add to
  her collection?"</p>

  <p>He nodded shamefacedly. "I didn't know she had been robbed."</p>

  <p>"How long had you had them?"</p>

  <p>"Just a few days."</p>

  <p>He told me that he had asked Miss Hamerton to marry him, and intended the
  necklace for a wedding-gift if she consented.</p>

  <p>"You were a downy bird!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I tell you," he said. "They were a slick pair. You might have
  been taken in yourself."</p>

  <p>"Did they know you?" I asked, still full of amazement.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I paid for them by check, certified check."</p>

  <p>"Which they cashed within half an hour!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. I never enquired."</p>

  <p>"Sold Miss Hamerton's pearls back to Miss Hamerton's leading man!" I
  cried. "My boy, we have something out of the common in crooks to deal
  with!"</p>

  <p>"They had a well-furnished suite on an upper floor of a first- class
  office building," he resumed. "I was there three or four times. I saw other
  customers coming and going. Everything was business-like and all right
  looking. Even the stenographer had a prim New England air. They showed me all
  kinds of precious stones. I bit at the pearls because I recognised that they
  were the same kind Irma had. They asked eight thousand dollars for them."</p>

  <p>"You knew, didn't you, that Miss Hamerton's necklace was worth much more
  than that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I had been told hers were very fine and perfect. I supposed
  these to be not so good."</p>

  <p>"And so you paid your money on a chance, and took them home."</p>

  <p>"Not quite as fast as that. The jewellers seemed to take it as a matter of
  course that I would have the pearls examined by an expert before purchasing.
  They suggested that I take them up to Dunsany's."</p>

  <p>"Dunsany's!" I said amazed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Wasn't that enough to lull suspicion? Dunsany's is more than a
  jewelry store; it's a national institution."</p>

  <p>"But you never took them there?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I did," was the surprising answer. "Sanford and Jones' clerk went
  with me. We saw Mr. Freer, the firm's expert on pearls."</p>

  <p>I whistled again. Freer, the man at Dunsany's to whom I had told my little
  fiction of the fiction-writer, and who had looked so queer when I mentioned
  blue pearls!</p>

  <p>"Large gentleman, elegantly-dressed, with a face like a boiled
  dumpling?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" cried Roland. "Do you know him, too?"</p>

  <p>"Go on with your story!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Freer examined the pearls and told me they were genuine, and of good
  quality. He valued them at about twelve thousand dollars."</p>

  <p>"The devil he did!" I cried. "This case is spreading wider and wider.
  Freer is in the gang, too. To think of their having a picket in
  Dunsany's!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because he like everybody else in the trade had been informed that the
  only necklace of blue-black pearls in the world had been stolen. He knew,
  moreover, that it was worth-" But here prudence stopped my tongue.</p>

  <p>"Worth what?" asked Roland.</p>

  <p>"Well, much more than twelve thousand."</p>

  <p>"The only blue pearls in the world?" he said, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot about this necklace you don't know," I said smiling. "All
  in good time. Go on with your story."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all, isn't it?" said he. "At least you know the rest. Why
  these fellows were so careful of details, you will even find their imprint in
  gold inside the case. Jones and Sanford, such and such a number, Maiden
  Lane."</p>

  <p>"Hm! I have a case on my hands now!" I said meditatively. "It may take me
  six months or more to clean this up."</p>

  <p>"I'll work with you," he said.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I like you better every minute," I said, smiling at him.
  "But you'd make the worst detective in the world."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, maybe I would," he said.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to await the outcome of the case," I said. "We
  have the evidence right in hand to clear you. I'll lay it before Miss
  Hamerton to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>My young friend surprised me again. He leaped up with his dark eyes
  positively blazing. "You'll do nothing of the kind!" he cried passionately.
  "That affair is done, done for ever. If you interfere, I won't be responsible
  for the consequences. She has her pearls back. Let her be. My time will come
  when she reads of the capture and the trial of the real thieves in the public
  newspapers!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BACK in New York next day, I made haste to get to work on
  the half dozen clues with which Roland had furnished me.</p>

  <p>I may say in passing, though the visit had no important results, that I
  called on Mr. Ambler of the Amsterdam Trust Company. At first he declined to
  give me any information whatever, but when I hinted that a certain suspicion
  rested on Mr. Quarles, he corroborated Roland's story as far as he knew it.
  He declined to give me the name of the attorney who had brought the money to
  the bank. "My endorsement of Mr. Quarles' story should be amply sufficient to
  clear him," he said, with the air of a bank president.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," I said, bowing, and left.</p>

  <p>Since there appeared to be no immediate connection between Roland's legacy
  and the theft of the pearls, I let that go for the present.</p>

  <p>I went to the address of the jewellers on Maiden Lane, but found, as I
  expected, that the birds had flown. An irate renting agent aired his opinion
  of Messrs. Sanford and Jones, but could give me no information of their
  whereabouts. They had leased the offices for a year, and after five weeks'
  tenancy, quietly moved out.</p>

  <p>"Don't you ask references from prospective tenants?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They gave A1 references," he mourned.</p>

  <p>I took down the names of their references for future use. One of them was
  Mr. Freer of Dunsany and Company.</p>

  <p>My next call was upon Mr. Alfred Mount in his office behind the store of
  exquisite fashion. His greeting, while polite, was slightly cooler than of
  yore. As a man of the world, I was expected to gather from it, that our
  relations were now at an end. It warned me to be wary. I was already on my
  guard, because I knew that he hated Roland, and hoped to profit by his
  disgrace.</p>

  <p>"Anything new?" he asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Yes and no," I said. "I am not satisfied that we have got quite to the
  bottom of our case."</p>

  <p>"Do we ever get quite to the bottom of anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that Quarles was alone in this," I said as a feeler.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite," I said. "Just a feeling."</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I believe that expert jewel thieves made a tool of him," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said Mount, looking bored.</p>

  <p>"If so, it is much to the interest of your business to run them down. So I
  have come to ask for your co-operation."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," Mount replied with his indulgent, worldly smile, "the world
  is full of trouble. I do not try to escape my share; I face it like a man, or
  as near like a man as I can. But I never go searching for more. We have by
  your skill recovered the jewels. The reasons for not pursuing the matter any
  further are to me obvious. Better let well enough alone."</p>

  <p>I appeared to give in to him. "Maybe you're right. I thought I saw a
  chance to earn a little glory."</p>

  <p>"There will be plenty of opportunities for that," he said affably. "You
  can count on me."</p>

  <p>We parted in friendly fashion.</p>

  <p>So much for Mr. Alfred Mount. At least he would never be able to say later
  that I had not given him his chance.</p>

  <p>I went to the magnificent marble building which houses Dunsany and
  Company, and asked boldly for Mr. Walter Dunsany, great- grandson of the
  founder of the house, and its present head. I was admitted to him without
  difficulty. I found him a jeweller and a man of affairs of a type very
  different from him I had just come from. Mr. Dunsany was a simple, unassuming
  man, direct and outspoken. In short, a man's man. I was strongly attracted to
  him, and I may say without vanity that he seemed to like me. From the first
  he trusted me more than I had any right to expect.</p>

  <p>At this time he was a man of about forty-five years old, somewhat bald,
  and beginning to be corpulent, but with a humorous, eager, youthful glance.
  He glanced up from my card with a whimsical smile.</p>

  <p>"Confidential investigator? More trouble, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," I said. "Have you an employee named Freer, an expert on
  pearls."</p>

  <p>"I had until a few days ago."</p>

  <p>An exclamation of disappointment escaped me.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Freer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't know where he is?"</p>

  <p>"On his way back to Holland, I suppose. He came from there ten years ago.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"One more question first. I am assuming that you know that a certain
  famous necklace of blue pearls has been stolen?"</p>

  <p>"Mount's pearls? Certainly. Everybody in the trade was advised."</p>

  <p>"You are sure Freer knew?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. It was his business first."</p>

  <p>"Yet a week or so ago, that necklace was brought into your store by a man
  who was considering the purchase of it. He submitted it to Freer. Freer
  pronounced the stones genuine, and said that the necklace was worth about
  twelve thousand."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dunsany jumped up and paced the room agitatedly. "Freer!" he
  exclaimed. "Impossible! You are sure of your facts!"</p>

  <p>I described the operations of Messrs. Sanford and Jones.</p>

  <p>"Not impossible, I suppose," he said more quietly. "This sort of thing has
  happened to me before. I doubt if there was ever a time when I was not
  harboring some thief or another. They never steal from me, you understand.
  They are the pickets, the outposts, who watch where the jewels go, and report
  to Headquarters. But Freer! He had been with me ten years. He had an instinct
  for pearls!"</p>

  <p>"Headquarters?" I said eagerly. "Then you agree with me that there is an
  organised gang at work?"</p>

  <p>"That's no secret," he said. "Every jeweller knows that there is a kind of
  corporation of jewel thieves. It is probably ten years old, and better
  organised and administered than our own association."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you break it up?"</p>

  <p>"Break it up!" he echoed. "It is my dearest ambition! There has never been
  a meeting of our association but what I have urged with all my eloquence that
  we get together and break up the thief trust. They will not support me.
  Everybody suspects that he has spies in his establishment, perhaps like Freer
  in a responsible position. The crooks seem to have us where they want us.
  They have never robbed us, you see. There is a sort of unwritten agreement,
  you leave us alone and we'll leave you. The other men in the association say:
  'If our customers are careless with their jewels, we are not responsible.'
  But I say we are! These crooks have put us in a position where, if we do not
  go after them, we may be said to be in league with them."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mount is a member of the association, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Mount? Oh yes, he's the president. To give Mount credit I must say that
  he has always supported me in this matter, though not so warmly as I would
  have liked. But I am considered a fanatic."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you and he do it together?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He won't go into it without the backing of the Association."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go it alone?" I said. "You are powerful."</p>

  <p>He glanced at me sharply. "I will when I see my way," he said. "Such
  police officers and detectives as have happened to come under my observation
  have not seemed to me the right men for the job. When I find my man-"</p>

  <p>"Will you consider me as an applicant for the job?" I asked quietly.</p>

  <p>He studied me hard. "I should be difficult to satisfy," he said.</p>

  <p>"First of all as to references," I said. There were some good men who
  backed me. I gave him their names.</p>

  <p>"How about Mount?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have already applied to him for the job," I said frankly, "and was
  turned down. He is satisfied with the recovery of the pearls. As long as he
  has refused to go in, I think it would be better not to let him know about
  our plans. That, however, is up to you."</p>

  <p>"I shall not let him know," Mr. Dunsany said briefly.</p>

  <p>To make a long story short, I succeeded in satisfying Mr. Dunsany of my
  fitness to undertake the matter in hand. We concluded a defensive and
  offensive alliance. He let me understand that expense was to be no object. I
  saw him every day. We met at his club, which was as safe a place as we could
  find.</p>

  <p>I gave him my full confidence, of course. With Roland's consent I told him
  everything that had occurred up to that time. Mr. Dunsany for his part had a
  whole file of evidence that he had quietly collected. He turned it over to
  me. It was interesting, and in the end valuable, but it had nothing to do
  with the case of the blue pearls.</p>

  <p>We laid our plans with infinite care. There was no hurry now, and every
  move was planned in advance. Absolute secrecy was imperative. Mr. Dunsany and
  I agreed not to take a soul on earth into our confidence.</p>

  <p>It was necessary to hire a small army of operatives. I did not figure in
  this. I had Peter Keenan, an old friend of mine, who was not known generally
  among my friends, act for me. Peter was a faithful, conscientious soul, not
  at all brilliant. He hired a suite of offices on Forty-second street and set
  up the "International Detective Agency." Peter was the nominal head, and
  Sadie the real directress of this establishment. Here the operatives were
  hired and sent on their errands. Each did his little task knowing nothing of
  the general plan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mr. B. Enderby was to be found all day in his office on Fortieth
  street with his feet on the desk, chinning with his young friends or
  composing a new play. You see the second cryptogram led me to suspect that
  they were aware of my identity, and in case I were watched, as I surely would
  be, I desired to give the impression that I had dropped all activities in
  connection with jewels or jewel thieves. I communicated with Sadie by letter.
  Uncle Sam is at once the most public and the safest messenger. For
  emergencies we arranged a system of telephone calls.</p>

  <p>It would be a tedious task to set down all the routine work of the agency.
  There were mistakes, disappointments and blind trails without number. To
  begin with, Sadie was ordered to trace Freer, the pearl agent, also Sanford
  and Jones, the bogus jewellers, and any of their employees. All this entailed
  great labour, and it was absolutely barren of result. These people seemed to
  have vanished into thin air. In the case of Kenton Milbourne she was more
  successful. She wrote: "In my character of Miss Covington the actress, I
  called on several of the women of Miss Hamerton's company who gave me their
  addresses when we disbanded. From their gossip I learned without having to
  ask questions, that Kenton Milbourne has not disappeared. They have all met
  him on Broadway. He is apparently living the ordinary life of an actor out of
  a job, going around to the different agencies to list his name, etc. His
  address is No. West 49th street.</p>

  <p>"I have allotted three of our best men to keep Milbourne under
  surveillance. The first, D. B., who has been an actor, is working
  independently of the other two. He has engaged a room in the same house and
  will make friends with M. The other two operatives, A. N. and S. C, are to
  trail him turn and turn about."</p>

  <p>Thus the ground was laid out. Making my report in turn to Mr. Dunsany, I
  said: "It's all very well as far as it goes, but we must do some original
  work. Tracking the theft of Miss Hamerton's pearls is following a cold trail.
  Our work is destroyed by the fact that the jewels have been recovered. We
  must branch out."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Let us lay a tempting bait for a new robbery, and catch them
  red-handed."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>"Are you prepared to risk something choice in diamonds or pearls?"</p>

  <p>"Anything I have in stock."</p>

  <p>"Very well. First, however, we've got to get a man accepted into the
  inmost circle of the thief trust."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. WALTER DUNSANY and part of his family sailed for
  Liverpool on the following Wednesday. The fact was liberally commented on in
  the newspapers. A squad of reporters saw him off at the pier, and got a
  statement from him on the country's business prospects.</p>

  <p>I must offer my little tribute of admiration to Mr. Dunsany. I have yet to
  meet his equal for daring and gameness. Middle-aged men are not generally
  conspicuous for these qualities, and when they are rich into the bargain why,
  to hang on to what they've got is usually their highest aim. But Mr. Dunsany
  insisted on playing the role of danger in our projected drama. He eagerly
  accepted a part that the most hot-headed young adventurer might have quailed
  from. I would never have allowed him to go in ahead of me, but unluckily an
  expert knowledge of gems was required. That he had and I had not. He insisted
  anyway that I must be free for the general command of all our forces.</p>

  <p>Twelve days after Mr. Dunsany's departure, one John Mattingly, in
  appearance a sober, decent, elderly artisan, descended the second-class
  gangway of one of our speediest ocean ferry-boats, and went to Ellis Island
  with the other immigrants. Landed in due course at the foot of Manhattan
  Island, he gazed at the towering buildings with a wondering eye, and allowed
  himself to be guided to an humble hotel in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>I was not there to meet him for a very good reason, but later in the day I
  received a note apprising me of his arrival. Two days later I had another
  telling me that having presented letters of recommendation, he had been
  engaged in the gem-setting shops of Dunsany and Co. I cannot do better than
  quote from his own reports. Far from being the usual cut and dried affairs,
  they were little human documents of humorous observation.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 2</span></p>

  <p>Wednesday, June 3rd.</p>

  <p>The morning after I landed, according to our program, I went to Dunsany's
  to apply for a job. I wonder if any merchant before me ever had the
  experience of besieging the doors of his own shop in a like humble capacity.
  Probably not. I enjoyed the experience. As soon as I opened the door I began
  to learn things about my own place. I always thought that my democratic ideas
  encouraged my employees to treat me exactly like one of themselves, but I
  found that they did not quite. Walking through the aisles I perceived a new
  atmosphere, a casualness, an indifference in the salesmen which shocked me at
  first, then made me want to laugh. The joke was on me!</p>

  <p>My letter of recommendation, which I had written myself, naturally, gained
  me the entree to the present head of the firm, i.e., my son Edward. I
  approached his office with some nervousness. Here would be the first grand
  test of my disguise. Would the son recognise his father? And if he did, would
  he have the wit not to give me away before others? And if he did not, would I
  be able to keep my own face in the ludicrous situation?</p>

  <p>I should say that in the matter of disguise I have followed your
  instructions carefully. The wig or toupee or transformation with which you
  furnished me, completely changes my appearance. I have also applied the
  stubbly beard and short moustache as you showed me how to do. I am letting my
  own hair grow beneath and will soon be able to leave off the false, which
  will be a relief as it is both hot and sticky. In addition it occurred to me
  to leave aside certain dental work which cost me a lot of money. The result
  is startling, and very satisfactory to our purpose.</p>

  <p>My clothes I bought ready-made in a London emporium. Need I say more? The
  hat is a wonder, a sort of decrepit music-master affair of black felt. It is
  undoubtedly third or fourth hand or should I say fourth head? I took care to
  have it well fumigated.</p>

  <p>Eddie did not recognise me. He favoured me with some sharp glances which
  discomposed me not a little, but this was only natural caution in engaging an
  unknown man. In our business we have to be careful. I was well-pleased with
  Eddie's manner, succinct and business-like without a trace of arrogance. Much
  better than my own manner, I dare say.</p>

  <p>Eddie was plainly annoyed by the situation, nor could I blame him. It was,
  of course, very irregular. In effect we were breaking the alien labour law
  beside opening up the prospect of labour troubles in our own shop. I knew
  exactly what was passing in the boy's mind, and I was longing to reassure
  him. Instead I had to make believe to be slightly over-awed in the presence
  of my little boy!</p>

  <p>He had no choice in the matter, because I had virtually instructed him to
  employ this Mattingly. In addition to the letter of recommendation I had
  written him from London saying that I was sending such a man, an experienced
  jewel-setter, I had said, and had described Mattingly's appearance, so that
  he had no need to ask me to identify myself.</p>

  <p>Finally after asking a number of questions, to all of which I had the
  answers pat, Eddie engaged me. I followed him to an upper floor, hard put to
  it to keep from grinning at the idea of my boy showing me the way around the
  place. Fortunately the spectacles I wear help me to preserve an owl-like
  gravity.</p>

  <p>He took me to Ashley, the foreman of the gem-setting department. Ashley
  has been with us forty years. He is a surly, lovable old crab. It was under
  Ashley that I got my training in handicraft twenty-five years ago. Ashley
  regarded me with no favourable eye, but bowed to the mandate of the head of
  the firm, of course. He gave me a boy's work cleaning old settings, and kept
  a sharp watch on me. Later I succeeded in mollifying him a little by showing
  a certificate of good standing in the English jewellers' union, and by asking
  the name of the local secretary so that I could apply for membership
  here.</p>

  <p>He has not forgiven me, though, for being put in over the youngsters'
  heads. "A blank-blank furriner!" his irascible eye seems to say. I thought I
  had taken the measure of the old man's irascibility, having worked under him.
  And in late years I would have said: "Here is one man in my shop who is not
  afraid to speak his mind to me." But Eddie had not been gone five minutes
  before I found that Ashley had never spoken all of his mind to me. I found,
  too, that his irascibility had been tempered to the boss's son. The boss
  himself, masquerading as a meek, alien workman, now received the full benefit
  of it.</p>

  <p>I am glad I made the resolution before coming here not to let anything I
  might learn on the inside, apart from actual dishonesty, influence me in
  dealing with my men later. Already I confess my patience has been tried. I
  thought I was a radical myself, but I find I am way behind the times. There
  is one young fellow, Mullen by name, a hothead, a socialist, who exasperates
  me every time he opens his mouth. He is so sure that his crazy ideas are
  right! Yet he is none the worse workman for that. He and old Ashley are the
  leaders of the two elements in the shop, and I'm sorry to say the old man
  generally comes off second best in their verbal encounters.</p>

  <p>During one of their arguments the first day, I was much amused, and a
  little alarmed, when the talk turned on me.</p>

  <p>"You with your socialist talk!" cried Ashley to Mullen scornfully. "A man
  would think every boss was a horned devil! There's our old man now, what's
  the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know him," said Mullen with a leer. "We ain't on visiting
  terms."</p>

  <p>"He talks to us, simple and friendly, just like one of ourselves," said
  Ashley.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" cried Mullen. "It don't cost him nothin'! I ain't seen him give up
  nothin' but talk, though. That's what he keeps you quiet with, a little soft
  talk like strokin' the dog!"</p>

  <p>"He don't set up to be no more than a man like myself!" said my
  defender.</p>

  <p>"Sure, and he is no more!" cried the other. "I've got as good an appetite
  for my meals as him, and my kids is as strong and handsome as his. But there
  he is sailing across the ocean in a soot de luxe, and here am I sweating at
  his bench."</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" asked Ashley, whereat all the
  men on his side crowed.</p>

  <p>"Do?" cried Mullen. "I'm goin' to give him fair value for his wages,
  that's what I'm goin' to do. But I don't have to lick the hand that pats
  me!"</p>

  <p>"A man can do what he likes with his own, I guess," said Ashley.</p>

  <p>"Tain't his own!" was the surprising answer. "He didn't earn it, did he?
  It was the surplus that his dad made out of us workmen, and his granddad
  before him."</p>

  <p>"His granddad started as a workman like ourselves," said Ashley. "Only he
  was the best workman, so he went ahead."</p>

  <p>"I doubt that," said Mullen coolly. "Tain't the best workman that gets
  ahead, but the sharpest. Granddad was sharp enough to get ahead of the other
  workmen. All right, I say. Let him enjoy what he can get. But does that give
  his family the right to run us to the end of time?"</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked Ashley again. All his
  supporters laughed.</p>

  <p>Mullen turned to me unexpectedly. "What have you got to say about it,
  mate? You know what they think about such things across the water. Give us
  your ideas."</p>

  <p>"I don't know the boss," I said feebly. "How can I tell?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean him," said Mullen scornfully. "He's nothing but a rich man.
  I mean about labour and capital."</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Ah! they tame them over there just like they do here, I see," said
  Mullen, turning away.</p>

  <p>I would like to fire that fellow when I get out of this but, of course, in
  common decency I must not.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I suppose you are wondering what all this has to do with our
  case. Have patience with me. I am so absolutely alone in my new life, I must
  have somebody to air my thoughts to. The evenings are the hardest to put in.
  The club calls me with a siren voice. Eddie's wife is away, too, and I think
  of the boy dining alone. I wish we had taken him into our confidence, but I
  suppose it was wiser not to.</p>

  <p>I have changed my boarding-place. Couldn't stand the fare at Mrs.
  McMahon's. I am now at a French place-No. 22 West 29th street. It is humble
  enough to suit my altered station in life, but the cooking being French is
  not impossible. I have mitigated my lot by buying a jug of excellent Bordeaux
  at Bardin's, which I have with my dinner without exciting suspicion. I am
  aiming to get the name of a "character" which will enable me to do pretty
  much as I please.</p>

  <p>The only break I have made so far was upon the avenue yesterday. I was on
  my way home from work and my wits were wool- gathering. I was dreaming, I
  suppose, of where I would like to go for dinner. Along came Warner Macklin,
  an elegant old dandy and a club acquaintance of mine. Without thinking, I
  nodded to him as I would ordinarily. You should have seen his affronted
  stare. The old snob! Anyhow it testifies to the efficacy of my disguise.</p>

  <p>If you would like to look me over I will be walking up and down in front
  of the dairy lunch on Thirty-fourth street East of Sixth avenue at
  Twelve-thirty to-morrow, Thursday. J.M.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 4</span></p>

  <p>Tuesday, June 9th</p>

  <p>I have not written you since Saturday, because there was nothing new to
  report, and I didn't want to take up your time with any more discussions on
  Labor versus Capital. I am receiving a liberal education in these matters,
  very salutary. After working at my bench all day I find my point of view much
  changed. But I do not like that Mullen fellow!</p>

  <p>I am pretty well shaken into my job by now. The local union is considering
  my application for membership favourably, so I am not a bone of contention in
  the shop. But I hope there is something more exciting than this ahead.</p>

  <p>I have neither seen nor heard anything suspicious in any of my
  fellow-employees. I would be willing to swear they are all honest, but you
  have told me, others too, that I'm too ready to believe the best of my
  fellow-creatures, so I'm keeping an open mind.</p>

  <p>Today there was a little shake-up in the shop on account of vacations. I
  got a step up. Ashley put me at the bench where jewels are removed from old
  settings on orders to be reset. This is exactly what we need to carry out our
  plans, and it comes sooner than he hoped but not too soon for me. However, I
  do not mean to rush things, but will proceed with due caution.</p>

  <p>My heart still yearns every time I pass a first-class restaurant. J.M.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT this stage I cannot better carry my story forward than by
  continuing to quote from the reports of different operatives. To me these are
  fascinating documents. Their sober matter-of- factness is more thrilling than
  the most exciting yarn. With a wealth of seemingly irrelevant detail they
  build up a picture more convincing than any except those of a master of
  fiction. One has to be in the secret, of course. The operatives themselves
  are not supposed to know what it is all about, though they may guess a
  little. But to be in the secret of a case and to read the reports bearing on
  it from a hundred angles, gives one a strange sense of power.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of D.B.</span></p>

  <p>According to my instructions I applied for board at number West
  Forty-Ninth street, Mrs. Atwood, landlady. I gave my name as Winston Darnall,
  and made out I was a character actor just in from the road. I engaged the
  rear hall room top floor. The place is an ordinary actor's house,
  considerably run down. The landlady has only lately bought the business from
  another woman, so it hasn't got the familiar friendly air of a
  long-established place.</p>

  <p>At the supper table I recognised my man Kenton Milbourne from the
  description furnished. He's an unusual looking man-unusually homely. He
  doesn't keep to himself at all, like a fellow with something on his mind. He
  seems to be on good enough terms with the other boarders, but they keep out
  of his way because he's such a tiresome talker. There's one or two old
  fellows that go around with him. They sit in the parlour and talk by the hour
  about what dandy actors they are.</p>

  <p>Milbourne has the large front room on the third floor. As luck would have
  it, the hall room adjoining was vacant, and there is only a thin board
  partition between, because the hall-room was originally an alcove. But I
  judged this was too much of a good thing. I was afraid of taking the hall
  room for fear of putting M. wise. Maybe later, when we're friends I can
  move.</p>

  <p>I wasn't in any rush to pick up Milbourne. Thought I'd better wait awhile
  and give him a chance to make up to me. Meanwhile I jollied the landlady. She
  was a talker like all of them. Milbourne, it seems, is her pet. She holds him
  up as a model for the other boarders because he paid her four weeks board in
  advance when her rent fell due. This seems to indicate he means to stay a
  while.</p>

  <p>All the boarders look up to Milbourne with a kind of respect because he's
  just closed his season with a first-class company, while the rest are mostly
  with repertoire companies, and cheap road shows.</p>

  <p>The second night I was there, Milbourne braced me in the parlour. Looking
  for a new listener, I guess. He started in to tell me what a hit he made with
  the Irma Hamerton production. If this man is a crook he's the smoothest
  article I ever ran up against. Because he isn't smooth at all. He talks all
  the time about himself as simple as a child, but at that he don't tell you
  much. He's got a dull eye which don't seem to take in nothing, and he talks
  in a slow, monotonous way and says a thing over and over until you're
  doped.</p>

  <p>A couple of nights later some of the younger boarders were having a bit of
  a rough house in the parlour and M. asked me up to his room where we could
  talk in peace. His room was bare like. He don't show any photographs or
  pictures or gimcracks. Seems he never even unpacks his trunk. It was a big
  trunk even for an actor, and packed neat and full as a honeycomb. Whenever he
  wants a little thing he unlocks it, takes out what he's after, and locks it
  again, even though he's right in the room. The key is on a chain fastened to
  his waist-band.</p>

  <p>His talk was mostly about the Irma Hamerton company. He told me what he
  says is the rights of the story about her sickness, and the unexpected
  closing in the middle of good business. She was in love with her leading man,
  Roland Quarles, according to him. Nothing was too bad for him to say about
  Quarles.[*] I didn't take much stock in all this. It is the way a poor actor
  likes to talk about one who rises above him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* My operative went into considerable detail here as to
  Milbourne's opinion of Roland. Most of it I have deleted, since it was no
  more than meaningless abuse. B.E.]</p>

  <p>About Quarles and Miss Hamerton; Milbourne said that just as she was going
  to marry him she found out that he had a wife already. Without exactly saying
  so, he let on that it was he, Milbourne, who had put her wise to the young
  man. That's the way they go on. She had hysterics, he said, and broke up the
  show. As proof of his story, he said that Quarles had disappeared and nobody
  knew where he was, not even his old servant.</p>

  <p>As I talk more with Milbourne I see that he isn't so simple as he likes to
  make out. He has a way of sandwiching in little questions in his dull talk,
  that amounts to pretty effective cross-examining in the end. He didn't get
  anything on me though. My story hasn't any holes in it yet. I have an idea
  that I've had considerably more experience acting than he has. Sometimes he
  lets slip a clever remark that don't fit in with his character of a bonehead
  at all. For instance, we were talking about the Chatfield case that all the
  papers are full of now, and Milbourne says: "Put a police helmet on any man,
  and right away his brain seems to take the shape of it. Cops think as much
  alike as insects. Let a crook once get on to their way of thinking, and he
  can play with them like a ball on a rubber string."</p>

  <p>He let this out by accident. Afterwards he looked at me sharp to see if I
  had taken anything amiss. I never let on. I have been in this house a week
  now, and Milbourne and I are supposed to be quite intimate friends. Last
  night on my way up stairs I saw a light under his door, so I knocked. His
  door is always locked. He wasn't any too glad to see me, but he couldn't very
  well keep me out, because he hadn't started to undress yet. He was having a
  little supper: a bottle of a syrupy kind of wine and biscuits with some
  blackish stuff he said was caviare. I didn't take any. I marked the labels,
  and to-day I went into a swell store and inquired the prices. The wine was
  Imperial Tokay. It is $2.50 the small bottle. The caviare was $1.50 for a
  little pot. I give this for what it's worth. Seems funny if a man has a taste
  for such swell eats he should put up at a joint like Mrs. Atwood's.</p>

  <p class="cp">'<span class="smcap">Report of A.N.</span></p>

  <p>Operative S.C. and I were instructed to trail a certain K. Milbourne,
  supposed to be an actor, and report on his habits and his associates. We were
  furnished with his description, and sent to watch the building at No. West
  49th street, where he boards. This house is a few doors from Eighth Avenue.
  We kept watch from outside a corner saloon over the way. We turned up our
  collars and stood around like the regular corner loafers.</p>

  <p>At 10:05 A.M. our man came out and walked up the long block to Broadway.
  We followed across the street. He turned down Broadway with the crowd. We
  split up, one on one side of the street, one on the other. He often stopped
  in front of store windows, but didn't seem to mind the windows so much as to
  look sideways to see who was passing. He turned in at 1402 Broadway, a big
  office building. I slicked up and went after him. Went up in the same
  elevator. He gave everybody in the car a sharp look. Got out at the eighth
  floor, and went into an office marked: "Mrs. Mendoza: Theatrical Agency."</p>

  <p>I went back down-stairs to wait. This building has an entrance on Broadway
  and one on Thirty-ninth street. S. C. took the Broadway door, and I watched
  the side street. Forty minutes later or 11:15 he came out my door. He walked
  around into Broadway, and S. C. picked us up again. He took us down as far as
  Thirty-fourth, and then turned around and went back to Forty- second, without
  leaving Broadway or stopping anywhere. Turned West on Forty-second, and went
  into the office of the D. and E. Booking agency in the Forrest Theatre.
  Stayed twenty-five minutes. Came out and went down West side of Broadway. At
  Thirty- ninth street met an actor and stood with him twenty minutes talking
  loud, and looking around them the way they do, to see if anybody is noticing.
  The talk was all theatrical gossip which I was instructed not to report.</p>

  <p>Looked at his watch and went on down to the 36th-37th street block, where
  he walked up and down about seven times, stopping at each end to look in the
  same store window, and then coming back. We watched from a music store where
  we were making out to listen to the piano-player. At 12:50 he met a man as if
  by surprise. They greeted each other so loud everybody rubbered. But it was
  all a stall. Right away they came down to business and talked low and serious
  to each other. My partner and I brushed against them, but we couldn't hear
  much. Too much noise in the street.</p>

  <p>I heard Milbourne say: "The grub is rotten! More than flesh and blood."
  His friend replied: "My dear fellow, it's worth it, isn't it? Be reasonable.
  You're safe. We're all safe." The two of them turned North walking arm in
  arm, still talking low. At the Forty-ninth street corner they parted.
  Milbourne turned West, on his way home presumably, and his friend continued
  North. S. C. went with M. and I took after the stranger.</p>

  <p>He was a big fat man, but energetic. He looked like a theatrical manager
  or a promoter. He wore a silk hat and a cutaway coat which flapped out as he
  walked. He had very big feet which slapped the pavement loudly as he walked
  along in his energetic way. It was a regular fat man's walk, the knees giving
  a little with every step. Height about 5 foot 10: weight about 220: dark
  brown hair and eyes. Eyes with a bright, hard expression. Heavy brown
  moustache with curled ends. Carried a cigar in his mouth which he never
  lighted, but kept twisting around while he talked.</p>

  <p>At Fiftieth street he crossed over and went down the subway stair spry as
  a kid. Got on the first train: I took a seat in the adjoining car. At the
  next station, Columbus Circle, he suddenly jumped up and left the train. But
  I was with him. He stayed on the station platform. For a little while the two
  of us were alone there. He gave me a good hard look. When the next train came
  along he took it. I was in the next car again. At Seventy-Second street he
  got out again. This time he went up to the street. He stood on the corner for
  a while. I watched from behind the glass doors of the subway station. I
  thought he was waiting for somebody. But suddenly he made a run for a passing
  car. I had to hump myself to get on it, but I did.</p>

  <p>For near an hour we rode around, hopping from car to subway, and back to a
  car again, with a ride in a taxi in between. Of course I knew by this time
  that he was on to me, but I stuck, hoping for a bit of luck. Later at the
  Ninety-sixth street station he darted down the steps again, me a good second.
  This station is always crowded. A woman blocked me at the gate, and he gained
  a few seconds. There was an express train waiting. Just as I reached it the
  guard closed the door in my face. Fatty was just inside. As the train started
  he turned around and thumbed his nose at me. I felt cheap.</p>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report from Australia</span></p>

  <p>Melbourne, May 10th</p>

  <p>Referring to your inquiry of the 10th ultimo respecting one Kenton
  Milbourne said to be an actor formerly of this place, we beg to report as
  follows: You are in error in supposing that Kenton Milbourne formerly acted
  in Australia, and sailed for America last year. Mr. Milbourne is at present
  appearing as _____ in _____. The company is now touring the province of New
  South Wales. Mr. Milbourne has never been to America. We enclose one of his
  published pictures which you will see at a glance is not that of the same man
  whose picture you sent us.</p>

  <p>Mr. Milbourne is an actor of character parts, fairly well known in the
  profession here, though not of wide public reputation. His personal character
  is of the best. His real name is John Whittlesey, and he comes of respectable
  parents in moderate circumstances, still living in the town of Perth, Western
  Australia.</p>

  <p>As to the photograph you enclosed, we are informed by a friend of Mr.
  Milbourne's that this is undoubtedly Evan Whittlesey, younger brother of John
  and the black sheep of the family, who went to America ten years ago, after
  having been implicated in the robbery of Morton's Bank, Melbourne. No
  proceedings were ever taken against him. From the same informant we learn
  that no one in Australia has heard of Evan Whittlesey since he went away,
  except possibly his brother who is reticent on the subject, suggesting that
  what information he has of his brother is not perhaps creditable.</p>

  <p>At this writing we are unable to furnish any information regarding Evan
  Whittlesey's early life beyond what is contained in the general statement
  that he was "wild," that is to say, a trial to his parents and his
  respectable brother whose stage name he appears to have borrowed for his
  American activities. If you desire us to go to the expense of a thorough
  investigation of Evan Whittlesey's past, please authorise by cable. Trusting
  to be favoured with your future commands, etc.</p>

  <p><br>
  The next report from which I will quote is Sadie's. It contained an
  unpleasant surprise. In order to make it clear I must briefly explain the
  arrangements of the International Detective Bureau. We had three offices en
  suite on the sixth floor of a building on West Forty-Second street. The door
  of the first room faced the elevators, and upon it was lettered our sign.
  Within was a neat railing, behind which sat Peter Keenan the ostensible head
  of the establishment, and an ornamental stenographer. The door to the
  adjoining room was hidden behind a tall file.</p>

  <p>The second little room was supposed by the employees to be Keenan's
  private office, but in reality it was designed as a sanctum for Sadie. There
  was a telephone here by which she might talk to me in safety. Sadie had her
  own door on the corridor and was never seen in the front room.</p>

  <p>The third office which was at right angles to the first and second was
  intended for the operatives in general when we were obliged to have them in.
  They were not supposed to come in without being instructed to do so. The
  other operatives looked on Sadie as one of themselves, and considered Keenan
  the boss. The door to the third room opened on a side corridor so that the
  men were never seen around the front office.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of S.F. (Sadie Farrell)</span></p>

  <p>Last evening at 5:15 operative S. C. came into the office without
  instructions. He had been told like the others to mail in his reports, and
  keep in touch with Mr. Keenan by telephone. The excuse he gave was that the
  man he was trailing had led him around so fast and so far that it had used up
  all his money. I had Mr. Keenan give him some money and call him down, and
  thought no more about it. Unfortunately, it appears to-day that his
  disobedience has had very unfortunate results.</p>

  <p>This morning I heard loud talking in the front office. Mr. Keenan
  explained later that a queer old man had come in, and had told a long
  rambling story about being persecuted. It seems that he wanted to engage the
  agency to protect him. It seemed a natural enough thing&mdash;we have had
  these harmless cranks before. Mr. Keenan soothed him down by telling him we
  were too busy to do proper justice to his case, and referred him to the
  police station. Neither of us thought anything more about it.</p>

  <p>This afternoon shortly before five I heard the old man's voice again in
  the outer office. Mr. Keenan had stepped out to post some papers to you. The
  old man was excited, and I could hear by Miss Reilly's voice that she was
  very much frightened. So I went to her assistance. I saw a bent, old man in
  shabby black, with wild, straggly hair, broken teeth and red-rimmed eyes, a
  repulsive sight. The instant I laid eyes on him I saw that he was not very
  insane. His manner was both servile and threatening. It was like stage
  insanity, incoherent jabbering and wild gestures. The girl was frightened
  half out of her wits.</p>

  <p>I asked him what he wanted, and he calmed right down. His speech was
  unintelligible as if he had some of those tablets in his mouth that actors
  use to make their voice thick. He made no more trouble. He bowed and smirked
  and backed out of the door. The last thing I heard was a silly kind of laugh.
  By this time I was full of suspicions. He had quieted down much too quickly.
  Besides, there was something familiar about the horrible old man. I had Miss
  Reilly enquire of the elevator boys. They said the old man had been in three
  times. Last evening as well as twice today. Last night he came up in the
  elevator with operative S. C. Today, I believe, he hung around downstairs
  until he saw Mr. Keenan go out.</p>

  <p>S.C. called up about this time to report that Milbourne had not left his
  boarding-house all day. Mr. Keenan questioned the operative over the phone at
  my prompting, and we discovered that S.C. had no proof that Milbourne was in
  the house. We learned that S.C. had lost Milbourne about 3:30 yesterday among
  the several entrances to a department store. He had merely supposed that he
  had gone home later. I then ventured to call up Milbourne's boarding-house.
  If he had been there, I would, of course, have lost the connection, but he
  was not. His landlady told me that he had telephoned her yesterday afternoon
  that he had been called out of town, and not to expect him home until
  tonight. Which shows how little we can depend on these operatives. Since
  talking to this woman I have received D.B.'s report from inside the house,
  confirming what she told me.</p>

  <p>Puzzling over in my head what it could be that gave the old man a familiar
  look, I suddenly got it. Do you remember when Milbourne first joined Miss
  Hamerton's company he played the part of the old forger, afterwards given to
  Richards? The management thought Milbourne's conception was too realistic,
  but Milbourne himself was childishly proud of his makeup in that part. He
  showed us a photograph, do you remember? Well, that was the same old man,
  wrinkles, scraggly hair, mean smile and all. The same clothes.</p>

  <p>It is easy to figure out now what happened. After giving the operative the
  slip in the department store, Milbourne went to some friend's room or
  thieves' hangout and disguised himself. He then returned to the neighbourhood
  of the boarding-house on 49th street and watched the watchers there. When
  S.C. was relieved by A.N. at five, Milbourne followed S.C. into the office.
  He was smart enough to see on his first visit to-day that Mr. Keen was not
  the real head of the office, and so he bothered us until I betrayed myself.
  Hence the laugh when he went out.</p>

  <p>I need not say how sorry I am for the accident. I blame myself quite as
  much as S.C. Luck played right into Milbourne's hand this time. I see how
  important it is. He knows of the connection between you and I, consequently
  all your trouble to let it be supposed that you are out of the case goes for
  nothing now. I have replaced S.C. with the new man, W.J., who came so well
  recommended. I have put S.C. at clerical work. Shall I discharge him
  altogether?</p>

  <p class="cp">'<span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 5</span></p>

  <p>June 15th</p>

  <p>On Saturday afternoon after work according to your instructions I took one
  of the unset diamonds with which I am provided to M's pawnshop at No. Third
  Avenue. I was very glad to have the second act of the drama open, and the fun
  begin. To tell the truth, I am very weary of the work bench at Dunsany's this
  hot weather. If I ever return to my proper character I will have more
  sympathy for my workmen. I believe now that it is not poverty that makes the
  working classes restless so much as monotony.</p>

  <p>M's, as you know, is a large and prosperous three-ball establishment near
  Fifty-Seventh street. The proprietor is a youngish man, a typical
  pawn-broker, with eyes as hard and bright as shoe buttons. Such eyes I am
  sure, would look on at the murder of a parent unconcerned if there was
  anything in it. I believe you are right in your estimate of the man. Good as
  his legitimate business appears to be, he is no doubt not averse to the other
  kind if it looks safe.</p>

  <p>But he was afraid of me. He offered to lend me money on my diamond, but
  declined to purchase. He demanded to know how it had come into my possession.
  I replied with a long and affecting tale of the hardships of an immigrant
  couple, no longer young. It was our last bit of property, I said, the stone
  out of my wife's engagement ring. The ring itself she still wore with its
  empty setting. Such was the pathos of the tale that I almost succeeded in
  convincing myself that it was true. It didn't matter, of course, whether the
  pawnbroker believed it or not, but it had to be a good story on the face of
  it, because it would be fatal to my chances of success if I gave the
  impression of being a fool.</p>

  <p>The hard eyes gave no sign one way or another. One could hardly expect a
  pawnbroker to be moved by a hard luck story. He told me to come back on
  Monday at noon, and he would see what he could do for me.</p>

  <p>I hastened up there as soon as we were released for the lunch hour to-day.
  There were two men loitering in the store; men of the same kidney as the
  astute proprietor apparently, very sprucely dressed. M himself ignored me for
  the moment and this precious pair gave me the "once over" as they say. I
  could feel their eyes boring into me like gimlets. However, it is possible to
  be too sharp to be discerning. They were deceived. A scarcely perceptible
  sign passed between them and the pawnbroker, and the latter suddenly became
  aware of the existence of his shabby customer.</p>

  <p>He now showed me what he intended for a real friendly air. He couldn't buy
  my diamond himself, he said, but seeing he felt so sorry for me he would send
  me to a diamond broker he knew, who would do business with me if I satisfied
  him it was on the level. He gave me an address near by. I enclose the card,
  but neither the name nor the address means anything of course. I went there
  at once, risking a call down from the foreman if I was late getting back to
  the shop.</p>

  <p>It was a room on the second floor of a typical Third avenue house, shop
  below, furnished rooms above, and the elevated road pounding by the windows.
  Evidently there had been a hasty attempt to make it look like an office; a
  desk had been brought in and the bed removed. Behind the desk sat a fat man
  rolling a cigar between his thick lips, and trying to look as if he were not
  expecting me. He looked prosperous in a common way, with his silk hat on the
  back of his head, and his immense gaping cutaway. His face was red and what
  passes for good-humoured with little pig eyes lost in fat. A huge moustache
  with curled ends, decorated it, the kind of moustache that I thought even New
  York politicians had given up nowadays. In a phrase, the man looked like a
  ward leader of fifteen years ago. The most characteristic thing about him was
  his bustling energy, unusual in one so fat.</p>

  <p>This alleged diamond broker was making out to be very much occupied with
  business. He kept me waiting a while. As soon as he took the diamond in his
  hand I saw that he knew nothing about stones. He didn't even have a glass to
  examine it. Evidently the word had been passed to him that it was all right.
  But if he knew nothing about diamonds, he was well experienced in humanity.
  He put me through a gruelling cross-examination which I supported as best I
  could. My delicate problem was to lead him to suspect I was a crook, without
  letting him think I was a fool. To this end I elaborated the story of my old
  wife's engagement ring. He listened to it with a leer in his little eyes, as
  much as to say: "Pretty good old fellow! But you needn't take all that
  trouble with me!"</p>

  <p>He expressed himself as satisfied, and we passed to the discussion of the
  price. I asked something near the stone's real value. He laughed, and offered
  me a fifth of that. We were presently hotly engaged in humankind's first
  game, bargaining. He loved it. Unfortunately I was handicapped by the
  necessity of getting back to work. We agreed on a price which was about a
  quarter of the stone's value. No doubt he would have had more respect for me
  if I had held out longer. He paid me out of an enormous roll of greasy
  bills.</p>

  <p>I was sorry to see the stone go. It was a good one, nearly two carats. It
  was not safe of course to mark it in any visible way, but I have had this and
  the other decoy diamonds carefully described and photographed, so that we
  will have no difficulty in identifying them later. As I was about to leave he
  shook my hand in friendly fashion, and still with that indescribable leer,
  expressed a hope that he might do further business together.</p>

  <p>I mumbled something about a pair of earrings. "Good!" he said. "Let me see
  them. Even if you don't want to let me have them, I'll appraise them for you
  so you won't get cheated. Come to me. I'm looking for a better office, so
  you'll find me gone from here. What's your address? I'll let you hear from
  me."</p>

  <p>I declined to give it.</p>

  <p>"Cautious, eh?" he laughed uproariously. "You needn't mind <i>me</i>!
  M&mdash; (the pawnbroker) will tell you where you can find me."</p>

  <p>I got back to my work just in time to avoid a fine.</p>

  <p>J.M.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 6</span></p>

  <p>June 18th</p>

  <p>I suspected that I might be trailed from the alleged diamond broker's
  office back to my work, and I hoped that I might be. Evidently I was
  yesterday. On my way to my luncheon place on Thirty-Fourth street I ran into
  my fat friend. He came towards me with his coat-tails flying. He has very
  large feet which slap the pavement resoundingly. His knees give a little
  which furnishes an undulatory motion, a roll to his walk.</p>

  <p>He hailed me blithely, and immediately announced that he was looking for a
  bite to eat. Somewhat sullenly, for I did not wish to appear too glad to see
  him, I confessed that I was on the same errand, and we turned into the dairy
  restaurant together. He laid himself out to win my liking. His loud, jolly,
  fat-man ways provide a cover for a considerable astuteness. It was my game to
  make out that I was startled to be found in that neighbourhood, and that my
  conscience was none too good. It was his game to put me at my ease and have
  it understood that everything went between friends. Nothing was said,
  however, about his business or mine.</p>

  <p>I stuck to my lately-arrived immigrant story, and he sympathised with my
  lonesomeness in a strange land. He was a bachelor, he said, and often
  lonesome himself. This line led presently to an invitation for me to join him
  last night for a little sociability at the Turtle Bay Caf on Lexington
  Avenue. I accepted it. I am sure by his eagerness to cultivate my
  acquaintance that he knows I work in Dunsany's.</p>

  <p>I met him at eight o'clock, and we secured a little table to ourselves in
  a sort of alcove. The Turtle Bay is just one of the usual saloons, mahogany,
  plate glass and electric lights. The principal lure of such places is the
  dazzling flood of light they cast on the pavement. They have discovered the
  subtle psychological appeal of light. Away with night and its terrors!</p>

  <p>My fat friend was liberally hospitable. I allowed my suspicious sullen
  manner to be charmed away by degrees. In a way he is really entertaining with
  his gross humour and rude vitality. I suppose any one can charm when they
  have a mind to. The cloven hoof, however, peeped out in his brutal snarls at
  the newsies and beggars who came to our table. On the whole I enjoyed myself.
  It was a lot better than mooning in my wretched room, or wandering the sultry
  streets thinking of the cool and comfortable club.</p>

  <p>The will being good on both sides we got along famously. No actual
  confidences have passed between us yet, but we are ripe for them. As we
  mellowed together I allowed it to peep out that I had a bitter grudge against
  society, and would stop at nothing to feed it. He enthusiastically applauded
  my sentiments. "Life is a bank!" he said, "that's got to be busted into if a
  man wants to enjoy any of the good things!"</p>

  <p>I am to call him George Pawling. We have a date to meet at the Turtle Bay
  again to-morrow night. I hinted that I might have another diamond or two. I
  was glad to hear from you that this man is undoubtedly one of the gang. So I
  am on the right track!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I DON'T want to give you too much of the operatives'
  reports. I tell myself it is not to be expected anybody would have the same
  absorbing interest that I have in all the ramifications of the case. So I
  will go on with my story in the ordinary way.</p>

  <p>After the catastrophe, it will be remembered, Miss Hamerton and Sadie had
  gone into the country to a little retreat I chose for them. After a day or
  two Sadie, seeing that Miss Hamerton could be left alone, would in fact be
  better alone, returned, and took up her work on the case as has been seen.
  Later, that is about the first of June, Miss Hamerton was so far recovered as
  to be able to go to Southampton, and open her cottage for the season. Now,
  towards the end of the month, I learned that she had come to town for a few
  days to talk over next season's plans with her manager. All of which was
  encouraging as far as her health and spirits were concerned. But thinking of
  my friend Roland, I was not anxious to see her recover too quickly. I had
  kept my promise to him, and Miss Hamerton was unaware that I was still busy
  on her case.</p>

  <p>I was shy about going to see her. My feeling was, considering her position
  and mine, that if she wished to keep up the connection she ought to give me
  some sign. I confess I was a little hurt that I had not received any.</p>

  <p>One day as I was returning to the office after lunch I met her strolling
  up the avenue with Mount. When I caught sight of her the whole street
  brightened for me with her loveliness. I watched her coming for half a block
  before she saw me. She seemed well; she had a good colour, and her face was
  vivacious more vivacious than it used to be, a little too vivacious. She
  seemed to have become aware of the necessity of vivacity. When she laughed
  her eyes were sombre.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in a strange bright blue; few women could have carried off
  that dazzling colour so well, with coral red at her girdle and on her hat.
  She walked through the crowd with the beautiful unconsciousness that was part
  of her stage training. The staring, the whispering, the craning of necks
  neither troubled nor pleased her. Alfred Mount, who was no child in the
  world, could not quite hide his pride at being seen with her. He, too, was
  gorgeously arrayed, a little too well-dressed for a man of his age. But I had
  to grant his youthful air, and good looks.</p>

  <p>I raised my hat, and was for keeping on, but she stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to pass me by?" she cried with charming
  reproachfulness.</p>

  <p>I became as proud and conceited as Mount, thus to be singled out by her.
  Everybody stared at me. Mount's greeting was affable and chilly like winter
  sunshine. I fell into step beside them.</p>

  <p>"Why haven't you been to see me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you let me know you were in town?" I countered.</p>

  <p>"I didn't like to bother one so busy," she said.</p>

  <p>This to me from her! I walked on air.</p>

  <p>"How is business, Enderby?" Mount asked in a faintly sneering tone.</p>

  <p>"Poor," I said calmly. "Everybody appears to be behaving themselves."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said he.</p>

  <p>"What stories he could tell us if he would!" my dear lady said
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>I smiled, as I suppose was expected of me. Little did she suspect that the
  only case I had was hers. We walked on chatting idly. What was said wouldn't
  be worth repeating, I expect, even if I could remember it. For me the mere
  sound of her voice was enough.</p>

  <p>There was no mention of the unhappy things that were past. We were all
  engaged in a tacit conspiracy to look forward. She told me of the new play
  that was proposed for her. She insisted that I must read it before the matter
  was finally determined.</p>

  <p>"You have such wonderful good sense!" she said. "And not at all affected
  by the actor's point of view."</p>

  <p>Mount's face looked a little pinched at this warm praise. I wondered, had
  he been consulted about the play? If he really honoured me with his jealousy
  he was foolish. I did not dream of aspiring to be anything more than her
  honest, faithful friend. Sadie, I hoped, was my destined mate while Irma
  Hamerton was why she was the sun over us all. Sadie herself felt the same
  towards her as I did. On the other hand I was jealous of Mount. I considered
  him presumptuous to aspire to our sun, as he plainly did. He wasn't half good
  enough-half? he wasn't worthy to tie her shoe. Besides, I was anxious about
  Roland.</p>

  <p>At Forty-second street they were turning West to the theatre district, and
  I bade them goodbye. Miss Hamerton covered me with confusion by asking me to
  dine with her at her hotel the same night.</p>

  <p>"Is it to be a party?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," she said. "Nobody but Alfred."</p>

  <p>This "Alfred" was new. It had always been "Mr. Mount." It set my teeth on
  edge.</p>

  <p>I accepted and left them.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served in her exquisite little drawing-room now loaded with
  sweet peas. For some reason that I have forgotten, the tiresome old Mrs.
  Bleecker was not in evidence; still I did not have a good time. I believe
  none of us had. "Alfred" still stuck in my crop. I reflected jealously, that
  if it had not been for the accidental meeting with me, Mount would have been
  alone with her. No doubt he was thinking of that, too. Everything from hors
  d'oeuvres to chartreuse was exquisite, but I had no zest in it. It was
  "Alfred" this and "Alfred" that. Really it seemed as if my dear lady was
  rubbing it in. I suppose that was her delicate way of letting me know of her
  intentions. I fancied I perceived a certain apprehensiveness in her as to how
  I was going to take it. Perhaps I flattered myself. Anyhow it was enough to
  make the angels weep. She was not in the least in love with him, she could
  not have been, but after the way of dear, ignorant women she was trying to
  persuade herself that she was. Hence the "Alfreds." I thought of my
  passionate young friend eating his heart out in a hall bedroom and my food
  choked me.</p>

  <p>Irma made some half laughing reference to the relief of being freed from
  Mrs. Bleecker's presence.</p>

  <p>"If she bothers you why don't you let her go?" said Mount.</p>

  <p>"Poor soul! What would she do?" said Irma. "She'd never get another
  situation, she's so disagreeable. Besides, I don't know that I could do any
  better."</p>

  <p>"Hardly worth while," said Mount. "You won't need a chaperon much
  longer."</p>

  <p>This was plain enough. It killed conversation for a moment or two. I was
  sure Irma sent an imploring glance in my direction, but I kept my eyes on my
  plate. Was it imploring me not to judge her, or imploring me to support her
  in what she meant to do, or imploring me to save her from it? How was a man
  to tell? I am sure she would have been glad if I had forced the question into
  the open, but I didn't know how to do it. True, I could have dropped a bomb
  in the middle of the table that would have shattered Mount's hopes, merely by
  telling what I knew of Roland. But my lips were sealed by my promise to
  him.</p>

  <p>Mount made some facetious remark at which we laughed and fled from the
  disconcerting subject. But it seemed as if we could not avoid it for long.
  The most innocent line of conversation had a way of landing us squarely in
  front of it. As when Irma said: "Have you heard that Beulah Maddox has
  started again to get a divorce?" Miss Maddox had been the heavy woman in our
  company.</p>

  <p>"That is the eleventh time she has started proceedings, isn't it?" said
  I.</p>

  <p>"Constant in inconstancy!" murmured Mount.</p>

  <p>"Miss Maddox's emotions are like soap-bubbles," I said.</p>

  <p>"Do you think women are fickle?" Irma asked with a direct look in which
  there was something very painful.</p>

  <p>I, thinking of poor Roland agonizing over his shorthand book until after
  midnight every night, could not help but shrug slightly.</p>

  <p>"If they are it's the men's fault!" said Irma bitterly. "The men I have
  known would make constancy in women an indication of imbecility!" So there we
  were again!</p>

  <p>"Funny, isn't it," drawled Mount, "how the sexes have no use for each
  other, yet love stories still sell." We laughed again. You had to admit Mount
  was a good man at a dinner table.</p>

  <p>I excused myself early on the plea of business, and went direct to Roland.
  Here I find I am a little ahead of my story, for I have not told you of his
  present circumstances.</p>

  <p>Roland had forsworn the stage. In this, as in everything else, he was an
  extremist, and he had cut himself off absolutely from his former life. People
  were always deceived by Roland's quietness. That composed face and
  indifferent manner concealed a capacity for white hot passion. As a matter of
  fact, I suppose, really passionate people are always like this, they couldn't
  live with themselves else, but we are blind to it. Roland had the spirit of a
  fanatic. He was always torturing himself one way or another. You couldn't
  help being fond of him he was so noble and so silly.</p>

  <p>Now, if you please, he had sold everything he possessed, and with the
  proceeds had pensioned off his old servant with an annuity. The mysterious
  legacy which had counted so against him, he had turned over to me with
  instructions to use it in bringing the thieves of Irma's pearls to justice. I
  couldn't very well refuse the money without confessing that Walter Dunsany
  was backing me, and no one in the world, not even Sadie, was to know of the
  relations between Mr. Dunsany and me, besides, if I hadn't taken it he would
  have done something more foolish with it. So I was holding it in trust.</p>

  <p>Having divested himself literally of every cent, Roland set about finding
  a job. Among his old acquaintances there were several prominent men who would
  have been glad to put him in the way of a good berth, but of course he would
  not apply to them. I could have done something for him myself, but he would
  not let me. He wanted to stand on his own bottom, he said. He set about
  answering advertisements, and visiting employment bureaus like any green lad
  from the country.</p>

  <p>Roland with his romantic good looks could not be insignificant in any
  sphere however humble. He had some quaint experiences. More than once he had
  to fall back on his good looks to save himself, as he thought, from
  starvation. He served as a demonstrator for a while, and another time as a
  model. Roland used to say at this time that he hated his good looks, and I
  really think he meant it.</p>

  <p>He finally landed a job as assistant bookkeeper and invoice clerk with a
  coffee importer on Water street. How he hypnotised them into believing he
  could keep books I can't say. His salary was ten dollars a week, and he lived
  within it, which you will grant was something of a change for the late
  darling of the matinees. He had a hall bedroom on East Seventeenth street,
  and ate outside. In the evenings he boned shorthand. His idea was to become
  first an expert law stenographer, and finally to study law. I found him as
  usual in the wretched little room, bending over the shorthand manual with a
  green shade over his eyes. I was his only visitor in those days. He was
  thinner than of yore, not so harassed perhaps, but grimmer. There were deep
  hawklike lines from his proud nose to the corners of his bitter lips. It made
  me savage to see him wasting his splendid youth in this fashion.</p>

  <p>"I've just had dinner with Irma," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said calmly. You never could get any change out of Roland.
  Whatever he felt he never dropped that hawk mask.</p>

  <p>"Mount was there."</p>

  <p>"Charming fellow, Mount."</p>

  <p>"Do you like him?" I asked amazed.</p>

  <p>"I neither like him nor dislike him," he said evenly. "He's a charming
  fellow, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's the tag they put on him," I said impatiently.</p>

  <p>He returned his attention to the shorthand book. This unnatural pretence
  of indifference exasperated me beyond bearing.</p>

  <p>"I believe they're preparing to get married," I said brutally.</p>

  <p>"We expected that, didn't we?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you care?"</p>

  <p>"Not overmuch."</p>

  <p>I knew he lied.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to put on this pretence with me for?" I demanded. "If
  you were really as callous and unfeeling as you make out I wouldn't bother
  with you."</p>

  <p>He merely smiled.</p>

  <p>I was determined to rouse him. "She doesn't love him," I said.</p>

  <p>"He's rich," he returned with a sneer.</p>

  <p>All the time I was trying to goad him I was getting more worked up myself.
  "That's not it!" I answered angrily. "Nobody knows it better than you. She's
  sound to the core. It's only your black temper that sees evil in her!"</p>

  <p>"Then how do you explain Mount?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's her instinct," I said. "It would be any good woman's instinct.
  She's trying to persuade herself that she loves him to fill the horrible
  emptiness of her heart since you failed her."</p>

  <p>"I fail her?" he said with his eyebrows making two peaks.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. You have no right to allow her to go on thinking that you are
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"I don't care to go into that again," he said with his immovable
  stubbornness.</p>

  <p>"If there is a catastrophe it will be your fault," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Really, as I've told you often, you've missed your vocation, Ben," he
  said with his bitter smile. "You're so romantic. Let's change the
  subject."</p>

  <p>"I won't," I cried. "I'm glad I'm romantic, if that's what it is. I love
  her a sight better than you ever did, because I have no hopes there myself. I
  am thinking of her. You think of nothing but yourself and your childish
  pride!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo, Ben!" he said mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand aside and see her marry Mount. He's too old. There's an
  evil spot in him some place that I can't put my finger on."</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"I came to you to get you to let me off my promise to say nothing."</p>

  <p>That roused him as nothing else could. He sprang up, his face dark with
  passion. He actually threatened me with his fist.</p>

  <p>"You swore to me!" he cried. "By God! if you break your oath!"</p>

  <p>"Keep your hair on," I said. "Am I not here asking you to let me off?"</p>

  <p>"I will not let you off," he said. "This is my affair, and mine only."</p>

  <p>"How about her?" I put in.</p>

  <p>He did not hear me.</p>

  <p>"You mean to be my friend, but friendship has no right to dictate another
  man's private affairs. I lead my life as I have to. You lead yours. No
  interference. That's the only way we can be friends. The only way you can
  help me in this is by bringing the thieves to book."</p>

  <p>"But that's going to be a long chase," I groaned. "Meanwhile Mount is
  making hay. What's the use of publishing the truth if the mischief is already
  done?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "If she can bring herself to marry Mount!"</p>

  <p>The self-sufficiency of a passionate young man! I could almost have wept
  at my helplessness against his obstinacy. "Be fair!" I cried. "It is our
  experience, our knowledge of men that warns us against Mount. How can she
  tell?"</p>

  <p>"This does no good," he muttered.</p>

  <p>In his bitter wrongheadedness I believe that he almost wished that Irma
  might find out her mistake too late. But I would not give up, though I felt
  it was useless. "What happiness can there be for any of us if Irma comes to
  grief?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake drop it!" he cried painfully. "What's the good of
  tearing open these old sores. You're off on the wrong tack. I've told you
  often enough. What if you did tell her I was innocent, and she turned back to
  me? That would be worse. I have nothing for her. I don't believe in her.
  She's dead to me. You can't revive that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," I said. "It would be more merciful never to tell her
  that you are innocent."</p>

  <p>That touched him. "Oh!" he said sharply taken aback. "A man doesn't like
  to dwell under that sort of accusation!" He quickly recovered himself. "Just
  as you think best," he said hardily.</p>

  <p>But let him make believe all he liked, the one little glimpse had
  convinced me that he was human after all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was on the way home from Roland's room in the dark and
  silent side streets that I first discovered I was being trailed. Since
  receiving Sadie's report of Milbourne's visit to her office I had expected
  this. It troubled me little. My position as commander-in-chief kept me behind
  the lines, and they would not learn much by following me. My mail I got from
  the post-office myself, and our telephone conversations as a rule would not
  have conveyed anything to an outsider, if he did succeed in intercepting
  them. At the same time it was annoying to know oneself watched. I wondered if
  there was any advantage to be gained from a counter stroke. Since they had
  succeeded in bringing me into the open, I had a mind to take an open shot at
  them. I began to lay my plans forthwith.</p>

  <p>My shadow picked me up as I issued from my house next morning. He waited
  outside the restaurant where I had my breakfast and accompanied me to the
  office. Looking out of my office window I could actually see him sitting on a
  bench in Bryant Park opposite. He was a slender young man with an unwholesome
  complexion and mean, sharp eyes, a 'sleuth' of the cheapest type. I wondered
  somewhat since they thought me worth following, that they had not chosen a
  better instrument than that.</p>

  <p>He had a good long wait, for I sent out for sandwiches at lunch time. At
  two o'clock he was relieved by a man, considerably beefier but not a bit more
  intelligent-looking. It apparently had not occurred to either of them to
  investigate if I was watching them.</p>

  <p>I determined to reach back at my enemies through their own spy. Having
  telephoned Sadie to have two good men meet me at the New Amsterdam Hotel at
  five-thirty, I sallied forth. My shadow resumed his attendance at my heels in
  the most obvious way. What kind of a fool did he think I was! It was child's
  play to shake him off. I merely went through the drugstore in the Times
  Building and downstairs to the subway station. I crossed under the tracks,
  mixed in the crowd on the uptown platform, and ascended to the street again.
  I saw my gum-shoe artist no more.</p>

  <p>I met the two men Sadie sent me, gave them their instructions and went
  home. My only fear now was that I might not be able to find my trailer again.
  But bye and bye to my satisfaction I saw the beefy one loafing across the
  street. I went out and dined well, while he looked through the restaurant
  window. I took in a show, letting him cool his heels outside the theatre and
  afterwards I treated myself to one of old Adam's rabbits and a mug of ale. It
  was near midnight when I was through with that and the time was ripe for my
  little comedy. I wended my way towards the office with gum-shoes hard on my
  trail.</p>

  <p>The little building where I have my office is given over entirely to
  business, and is closed for the night at ten o'clock. Like the other tenants,
  I am provided with a latchkey, in case I have to get in after hours. I am
  often there late, but I have never met any of the other tenants at night.</p>

  <p>It all went through as on roller bearings. I walked down Fortieth street
  softly whistling "Mighty Lak' a Rose," which was my signal to the two men.
  They were posted in the shadow of the last doorway I had to pass before
  turning into my own. The block is a quiet one at that hour.</p>

  <p>I let myself into my building and waited just inside the door. When
  gum-shoes came along all unsuspicious, my two friends jumped him, and holding
  his mouth, hustled him in after me, before he well knew what had struck him.
  We improvised a gag out of a handkerchief, and carried him upstairs to my
  office. The fellow did not even kick.</p>

  <p>We dumped him in a chair and turned on the lights. Then we stood off, and
  the three of us burst out laughing simultaneously. You never saw a more
  comical sight than the expression of that poor bloodhound who suddenly found
  himself treed by his quarry! I now had no further use for the two men, so I
  tipped them and they left us. I locked the door after them and put the key in
  my pocket. I told my prisoner he might unfasten his gag, and I sat down at my
  desk facing him. On the desk I prominently displayed a wicked-looking
  automatic. I had no idea of using it, but it made a potent argument.</p>

  <p>Having laughed at the man I felt almost friendly towards him. I offered
  him a cigar. He ignored it, and I put it away. "What do you mean by this
  outrage!" he demanded.</p>

  <p>I laughed afresh. "Come off, Jack!" I said. "You must think I'm a downy
  chick."</p>

  <p>At that he climbed down, and asked for the cigar quite humbly. "What do
  you want of me?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Just a little heart to heart talk," I said grinning.</p>

  <p>"You can't make me talk," he growled.</p>

  <p>I played with the revolver. "There's not a soul in the building but
  ourselves," I said offhand. The janitor lived on the top floor, but I
  supposed he didn't know that.</p>

  <p>He wilted right down. He had no nerve at all. "I ain't got nothin' against
  you personally," he whined. "I only got my living to make the same as
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Who hired you to trail me?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what guy's got it in for you," he stammered. "Honest, I only
  got my orders from the office."</p>

  <p>"What office?"</p>

  <p>"If you queer me there I'll lose my job. I'm a married man with two
  children."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell them I put a gun to your head."</p>

  <p>"Aw, let me go. I ain't got nothin' against you."</p>

  <p>I picked up the gun. "Come across! Who hired you."</p>

  <p>"The Detective Agency," he stuttered.</p>

  <p>He named one of the largest Agencies in town. Of course, I didn't know but
  what he was lying, but I meant to find out before I let him go. I turned a
  threatening scowl on him, and let my hand stray towards the gun again.</p>

  <p>"I want the truth," I said.</p>

  <p>He watched my hand like one hypnotised. Little drops of sweat broke out on
  his forehead. "For God's sake, Mister!" he chattered. "For God's sake! I'm
  telling you the truth. I'm only a poor operative. I don't know who wants to
  get you!"</p>

  <p>"You'll have to prove it," I said.</p>

  <p>"Call up the Agency," he stuttered. "They're open all night. My name is
  Atterbury. I'm number 68."</p>

  <p>The instrument was at my hand. I got the number, and was presently
  answered by a brash young voice demanding to know what I wanted.</p>

  <p>"This is B. Enderby," I said, "of number West 40th Street. Have you got an
  operative working for you named Atterbury, number 68 on your books?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know you," returned the voice. "We don't give any information
  over the phone. Call around and let us look you over." He hung up.</p>

  <p>This little passage made me downright hot, and I suppose it showed in my
  face when I looked at the detective again.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what's the matter?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"They refuse to identify you."</p>

  <p>He became still paler and clammier if that were possible. "Let me let me
  call them," he stammered.</p>

  <p>I shoved the instrument towards him and waited. When he got his number he
  fell all over himself trying to explain. "Who is this, Dixon? Oh, Jones.
  Jones for God's sake! this is Atterbury. Square me, can't you? This guy
  Enderby, I mean Mr. Enderby's got me sewed up in his office. He's got me
  covered for God's sake, square me! Or I'm a goner!"</p>

  <p>He shoved the instrument towards me. I kept one hand on my gun, inwardly I
  was shaking with laughter. "This is Enderby again," I said into the
  transmitter. "Now you have the situation. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"I know you!" cried the brash voice, now thoroughly scared. "I've got your
  name and number. If anything happens to our man we've got you dead to
  rights."</p>

  <p>"Sure," I said laughing. "You identify him, then?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, I do! And if anything happens to him-"</p>

  <p>"That's all I wanted to know," I said. "Goodbye." And this time I did the
  hanging up.</p>

  <p>I got up and unlocked the door. "Get!" I said to Mr. Atterbury. "If you
  take my advice, old man, you'll go into some other line." He made grand time
  on the stairs.</p>

  <p><br>
  The head of the &mdash; Detective Agency was Dongan, a well-known and able
  man, once the head of the New York Detective Bureau. He belonged to a school
  of investigation different from mine, but I respected his ability and I knew
  him to be above reproach. I was sure in this situation I could not do better
  than go direct to him. I called next morning.</p>

  <p>"So you're in the same line?" he said looking at my card.</p>

  <p>"That accounts for my business with you," I replied.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't your people told you what happened in my office last night?"</p>

  <p>"No. Explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"We are in the same line. Hunting down crooks. The supposition is that we
  handle only clean business."</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?" he demanded scowling.</p>

  <p>"I came to ask you to explain why you're tracking me in the legitimate
  pursuit of my business. You will agree, I think, that it looks fishy."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about it," he said crossly. "I don't know you."</p>

  <p>"I will wait while you enquire," I said mildly.</p>

  <p>He went into his outer office. In about five minutes he returned bringing
  a younger man.</p>

  <p>"Well, you seem to have the goods on us, Enderby," he said ruefully. "It
  was a small job and I was not consulted."</p>

  <p>"Our client never told us you were a detective," said the other man.</p>

  <p>"I will make the excuses," said his employer dryly. "Describe the man who
  engaged us to trail Mr. Enderby."</p>

  <p>"Gave his name as Lawlor. Fleshy man about forty-five years old. Red face,
  big black or dark brown moustache. Wears a cutaway coat and silk hat, very
  active in his movements."</p>

  <p>"Has unusually large feet," I added, "which he slaps down in a peculiar
  way when he walks."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," said the young man, surprised. "You know him?"</p>

  <p>"Not so well as I would like to," I said dryly. "What address did he give
  you?"</p>

  <p>"We haven't got his address?"</p>

  <p>"Where were your reports to be sent?"</p>

  <p>The young man consulted a card. "Box 229, Station W, New York."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's something," I said, and rose. "When you report to him please
  don't mention that I've been in."</p>

  <p>"There will be no more reports," said Dongan shortly. "We'll return his
  money."</p>

  <p>"If you want to make up to me for the trouble you've put me to, make him
  one more report," I suggested. "Simply tell him that upon learning that I was
  a detective, Mr. Dongan directed that the business be refused."</p>

  <p>"I will do that," Dongan said.</p>

  <p>"When would you ordinarily report to him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"This morning," the young man replied. I guessed from his foolish
  expression that a lurid account of the last night's proceedings had already
  been written.</p>

  <p>"Good!" I said. "Will you please send it right off? I want to watch the
  letter box."</p>

  <p>Dongan agreed.</p>

  <p>I hastened to Oscar Nilson's shop. An hour or so later I issued from under
  his hands, as perfect a specimen of the snuffy old man, the shabby genteel,
  as you could have found in any public reading-room from Chatham Square to
  Cooper Union. Oscar is a wonder.</p>

  <p>By noon I was at Station W, which is away uptown on Columbus avenue.
  Peeping through the glass front of Box 229 I saw that the letter from Dongan
  had not yet arrived, at least the box was empty. A little while later I had
  the satisfaction of seeing the letter with the Detective Agency imprint on
  the corner shoot into the box.</p>

  <p>For a weary two hours thereafter I made believe to amuse myself with the
  store windows of the block, up and down, both sides. Since I was the very
  picture of a harmless old loafer, my movements attracted no notice. At last
  he hove in view on foot. There was no danger of overlooking this man in a
  crowd. I spotted him nearly two blocks away. He came dipping down the street
  with his vast cutaway spread to the breeze and his feet slapping the
  pavements, just as the different operatives had described him. With a shape
  and peculiarities so marked, a crook must needs be doubly clever to keep out
  of the toils. I suspected I was up against a good one. There was little of
  the crook in his appearance. His fat, rosy face bore an expression of good
  will to all men.</p>

  <p>He issued out of the post-office with the open letter in his hand, and
  looking not quite so good-natured. He started North again, still on foot.
  Walking at that rate it was impossible for an apparently decrepit old man to
  keep up his character, so I was presently obliged to get on a car. It was an
  open car and I could keep track of him for several blocks. Indeed, with the
  stops, we travelled very little faster than he did. When I got too far ahead,
  I got off and let him overtake me.</p>

  <p>He turned West on One Hundredth street and disappeared in a cheap
  apartment house, one of a long row. When I came abreast of the stoop I saw
  him in the vestibule, poking his fat fingers in one of the letter boxes.
  Marking the position of the box I passed on.</p>

  <p>Returning presently, I saw that the box belonged to Apartment 14. The name
  upon it was R. Winters. I do not, however, mean to tax your brain with any
  more of Fatty's innumerable aliases. From one of the reports I learned that
  his nickname was "Jumbo." Hereafter I shall call him that.</p>

  <p>I loafed up and down the street debating my next move. It is a crowded
  street and I was not conspicuous. Many an old dodderer walks up and down
  watching the children's games with a vague glance. I was very keen to have a
  look at the inside of Apartment 14. Thinking of Irma and Roland and the
  necessity of accomplishing something quickly, I am afraid I was not content
  to act with the caution that Mr. Dunsany and I had agreed was necessary. The
  most obvious suggestion was to send Jumbo a fake telegram, calling him out.
  But in that case, when he discovered the sell he would know that I was on to
  him. I wanted to be sure of a case against him first.</p>

  <p>While I was still pondering the matter, Jumbo issued forth again
  accompanied this time by a woman of his own age and type who might have been
  his wife. From the style of her dress I judged that they were off on an
  expedition, and my heart beat high. I made sure that they were really leaving
  the neighbourhood, by seeing them on an Amsterdam avenue car bound
  downtown.</p>

  <p>Returning, I rang the bell in the vestibule several times to make sure
  there was no one else at home. The latch never clicked. I took advantage of
  some one's coming out to enter, and climbed the stairs until I came to the
  door marked 14. I knocked without receiving any answer. The doors of these
  flats are childishly easy to open unless the tenant puts on a special lock.
  In this case it had not been done. A calling card properly manipulated did
  the trick. I found myself inside.</p>

  <p>I shall not go into a lengthy description of the place because there was
  nothing to describe. It was an ordinary flat of four small rooms, and from
  the look of it might have been outfitted complete by an installment house.
  There was nothing to suggest the taste of the owners, at least not until you
  came to the kitchen. Here there was an immense ice chest crammed with the
  choicest and most expensive eatables and drinkables. That was where their
  hearts lay! There was also a great store of fine liquors and cigars.</p>

  <p>One bit of evidence rewarded my search, and only one. There were no
  letters, no papers, not a scrap of writing of any kind, except two lines on a
  piece of paper which I found under the blotting-pad of the cheap little desk
  by the sitting-room window. It had evidently slipped under and had been
  forgotten. A clever crook, of course, is no cleverer than an honest man. He
  is sure to make a little slip somewhere. In the two lines of writing I once
  more beheld the famous cryptogram. I pocketed it in high satisfaction.</p>

  <p>I had got as far in my search as the imitation Japanese vases on the
  mantelpiece. I was peeping inside one of them when I heard a slight sound
  behind me. I turned around and beheld Jumbo swelling and purpling with silent
  rage in the doorway. I confess I was a good deal shaken by the apparition,
  though I managed to put down the vase with a good appearance of composure. He
  had stolen in as noiselessly as a cat. No matter how clear one's conscience
  may be, one is taken at a disadvantage discovered in the posture of a
  burglar.</p>

  <p>For a while we looked at each other in silence. I cautiously reassured
  myself that my gun was safe in my pocket. I saw that Jumbo was making a
  tremendous effort to hold himself in, and I realised that he had more to fear
  from a showdown than I had. I began to breathe more easily. I had taken off
  my hat for coolness, and the wig was sewn inside the band. He obviously knew
  me. Perhaps it was as well for me. If he had supposed me an ordinary sneak
  thief he might have struck me down from behind with a blow of that mighty
  fist.</p>

  <p>He began to swear at me thickly and softly. I remember wondering if he
  were going to have an apoplectic seizure, and hoping he wouldn't because it
  would spoil my case.</p>

  <p>"I have you covered from my pocket," I warned him, in case his feelings
  got the better of his judgment.</p>

  <p>"Yah! I'm not going to touch you!" he snarled. "I don't have to." He got
  his rage under partial control. "Go ahead and finish looking," he said with a
  grim sort of humour.</p>

  <p>"I have finished," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, what did you find?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"You're dead right you didn't find nothing," he triumphantly retorted,
  "because there ain't nothing to find! I'm straight, I am! I don't fear
  nobody. I don't know what you think you're after, but I'll tell you this, I'm
  sick of this spying business! I warn you to drop it, or I'll crush you as I
  would a fly! Who are you, you amateur! I know all about you. You ain't got
  nothin' behind you. You're a four-flusher, a cheap skate! Keep away from me
  or I'll make you sorry you set up to be a sleuth!"</p>

  <p>All this had quite the opposite effect of what was intended. As soon as
  Jumbo began to brag and blow, something told he was not in the least to be
  feared. However, for my own purposes, I assumed an air of confusion, and
  looked longingly toward the door behind him. He was not at all anxious to
  detain me. He circled away from the door, keeping his front carefully turned
  towards me. I in turn backed out of the door, and he slammed it shut.</p>

  <p>As soon as I got home I made haste to translate my find. It proved to even
  more important than I had hoped.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Received of Jumbo six thousand cash, three thousand stock
  as my share of the blue pearls. <span class="smcap">Evan</span>."</p>

  <p><br>
  I allowed myself a little feeling of triumph. You will remember I had learned
  that Kenton Milbourne's name was Whittlesey. As for the mention of blue
  pearls, there were no others but Irma's in the world. This amounted to real
  prima facie evidence then, the first bit I had secured. Would they find out
  that it was in my possession? It must have been temporarily mislaid, they
  were in all other things so careful. After my visit perhaps Jumbo would begin
  to think back. I was not left long in doubt as to the matter. They struck at
  with a boldness and skill I was little prepared for.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 9</span></p>

  <p>June 25th.</p>

  <p>To-day as I came out of the work-people's entrance to Dunsany's at noon
  Jumbo passed by on the sidewalk. He tipped a scarcely perceptible wink, and
  kept on, as I was with my fellow workmen. I suppose that he wished to catch
  me in the act, so to speak. In other words he wants to have it understood
  between us that he knows I work there. It is a step towards more confidential
  communications.</p>

  <p>We met as usual to-night at the Turtle Bay Cafe, but something had
  happened in the meantime, because Jumbo was glum and sour. I made believe not
  to notice it. After he had a drink or two he volunteered the reason.</p>

  <p>"A fellow broke into my rooms to-day, a sneak thief," he said.</p>

  <p>"What did you do to him?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I half killed him and let him go. He didn't get anything."</p>

  <p>This was obviously no explanation of his worried air. I continued to
  question him about the affair with a friend's natural curiosity, but he
  suddenly became suspicious, so I let it drop. I do not know if this has
  anything to do with your other activities, but I give it for what it's
  worth.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening when Jumbo's good-humour was somewhat restored, he
  referred to our noon meeting in a facetious way.</p>

  <p>"Thought you said you were out of a job," he said:</p>

  <p>I made believe to be somewhat confused. "Ahh, I wasn't going to tell
  everything I knew to a stranger," I said.</p>

  <p>He hastened to commend me, and affected a certain admiration of my
  astuteness. "You're a deep one, English! I bet you could teach me a trick or
  two!" Have I mentioned that "English" is becoming my monaker?</p>

  <p>By this time it is thoroughly understood between Jumbo and I that we are
  both "good sports," i.e. dependably crooked. It saves a lot of bluffing on
  both sides.</p>

  <p>Jumbo asked what my job was at Dunsany's. I explained I handled all the
  stuff that was sent in to be reset, my particular job being to remove the
  jewels from their old settings before handing them on to the expert
  craftsmen.</p>

  <p>"What a chance!" said Jumbo wistfully. "But I suppose they have you
  watched."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," I said, and I went on to explain all the precautions against
  theft and loss, "but, of course..."</p>

  <p>Here I made believe to be overtaken by caution.</p>

  <p>Jumbo's little eyes glistened. "Of course what?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>I tried to turn the subject, which only increased his eagerness. He kept
  after me.</p>

  <p>"If a man knew the trick of making paste diamonds," I suggested, "and
  could substitute one occasionally! Of course he'd have to make them himself.
  It wouldn't be safe to buy them."</p>

  <p>Jumbo whistled softly. "Can you make them?" he asked. I confessed that I
  could.</p>

  <p>"But wouldn't the fellows get on to you, I mean the experts you hand the
  jewels on to?"</p>

  <p>I have already told you, Jumbo knows next to nothing about diamonds, so I
  felt safe enough in my romancing. "Not likely," I said. "Paste jewels are
  first rate imitations at first. It's only after a while that they lose their
  lustre. Of course, if I was found out, I'd pass the buck to the fellow who
  gave them to me. After the new work is returned to the customer there's no
  danger until the work has to be cleaned or repaired."</p>

  <p>"How could a fellow keep all the different sizes and cuttings handy in his
  pocket?" Jumbo asked.</p>

  <p>"In his pocket!" I said scornfully. "He'd be spotted the first day! You
  make the job last overnight, see? Weigh, measure and test the stone you want,
  and bring the phony stone to match it next morning."</p>

  <p>Jumbo was breathing hard in his excitement. I suppose he saw an endless
  vista of profits, the risk all mine. "But ain't the stones all cut
  different?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Say, you want to know as much as I do," I said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>He fawned on me. "You're dead right, 'boe. That's your private
  affair."</p>

  <p>After we had another drink or two I made believe to drop my guard
  completely. I left out the ifs and the coulds and admitted that my game at
  Dunsany's was as I had described it. To prove it I brought out a couple of
  beautiful unset diamonds, which completed the conquest of Jumbo.</p>

  <p>"It's a cinch! a cinch!" he cried. "A couple of good men could make fifty
  thousand a year easy and safe. Fifty thousand after the commission was taken
  out."</p>

  <p>"What commission?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-three and a third per cent to them that disposes of the stones,"
  said Jumbo evasively.</p>

  <p>I thought it wiser not to question Jumbo any farther in that direction at
  present.</p>

  <p>Jumbo went on enthusiastically. "You and me'll be pardners! This is our
  little private graft. We won't let anybody else in, see? You on the inside,
  me out, we were made for each other!"</p>

  <p>The coyer I made out to be, the more friendly was Jumbo. Finally, coming
  down to practical matters, he asked what the stones were worth. I told him
  the market value.</p>

  <p>"Of course I can't get anything like near that," he said. "But I'll make
  the best dicker I can. I'll let you know before I close with them."</p>

  <p>After some more persuasion I finally handed over the stones. I knew he
  wouldn't play false as long as he thought there were larger gains in
  prospect. We haggled for an hour over the division of the profits. I
  passionately refused to consider fifty-fifty, since the work and the risk
  were all mine. Half a dozen times the budding partnership seemed about to
  end. We finally agreed on sixty and forty. By holding out as I did, I believe
  I have lulled Jumbo's suspicions forever.</p>

  <p>The compact was cemented with a drink. We talked on about diamonds, and I
  saw a new idea form and grow in Jumbo's little swimming eyes. Studying me
  speculatively, he put through a lengthy cross-examination concerning my
  knowledge of precious stones.</p>

  <p>"You're one of these here experts yourself, ain't you?" he said at last. I
  modestly accepted the designation.</p>

  <p>"What did you leave England for?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What's past is past," I said, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said hastily. "I don't want to pry into your affairs." He
  changed the subject, but I could see him still chewing over the same idea,
  whatever it was.</p>

  <p>We were sitting as usual at one of the little tables down the side of the
  barroom. Jumbo excused himself for a few minutes. When he came back he talked
  about one thing and another, but it was manifestly to gain time. glanced at
  the door from time to time. I wondered what was saving for me. At about ten
  o'clock, a man came into the place alone, and went to the bar without,
  apparently, looking at us.</p>

  <p>"Why there's Foxy!" cried Jumbo in great surprise. He hailed his friend,
  and had him join us at our table. They overdid the casual meeting a little. I
  began to suspect that Jumbo had telephoned this man to come and join us, and
  I waited with no little curiosity to see what would come of it. The newcomer
  was a man of Jumbo's age, but looking much younger because he was slender and
  well built.</p>

  <p>He was one of the plainest men I have ever seen but not in the sense of
  being repulsive, just plain. He was a blonde with ashy, colourless hair, and
  features of the 'hatchet' type, that is to say sharp nose, narrow, retreating
  forehead, with the hair beginning some distance back. 'Foxy' didn't seem to
  fit him very well, because he looked heavy-witted, stupid, but perhaps he can
  be sharp enough when he wants. He had a dull, verbose style of talk, and a
  conceited air like a third-rate actor.</p>

  <p>Jumbo informed with a scarcely concealed leer that Foxy was a "good
  fellow," in other words a crook like ourselves. Verily, words come to strange
  passes!</p>

  <p>Presently we got to talking about diamonds again, and Jumbo in his
  character of the broker, exhibited the two he had just obtained from me. He
  did not, however, in my hearing say where he had got them. A look at was a
  sufficient hint to say nothing about our compact. Presently I began to
  realise that Foxy in his heavier way was putting through a sharper
  examination than Jumbo's. My opinion of hatchet-face's cleverness went up
  several points.</p>

  <p>This exhibited a considerable theoretical knowledge of diamonds as of one
  who might have read up on the subject. For instance he knew the
  characteristics, the weight and the ownership of the world-famous stones. He
  had, however, nothing of the eye-to-eye knowledge of the experienced
  jeweller. I apparently passed his examination satisfactorily. He glanced at
  Jumbo in a meaning way, and the latter said: "Look ahere, English, you ought
  to be able to make a good thing on the side by appraising diamonds."</p>

  <p>My heart jumped at the possibilities this opened up. Was I about to land
  the job of diamond expert to the gang? "The profession's overcrowded," I said
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I could put you in the way of a job occasionally," said Jumbo. "Some
  fellows Foxy and me knows would be glad to pay for a little advice about
  buying and selling stones."</p>

  <p>I began to hope that the end of our labours might be in sight. But the
  next question dashed me a little.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;?" Foxy asked, naming one of
  the most prominent society women in New York. Of course I had, she is one of
  my best customers.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>He gave some details of her history which would have astonished
  Cora&mdash;if could she have heard them. "She has a fine string of
  sparklers," he remarked in conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Has she?" I said innocently. I had sold them to her.</p>

  <p>"She's at Newport now," said Foxy casually.</p>

  <p>"Hell! what's the use of beating round the bush!" said Jumbo in his hearty
  way. "Ain't we all friends together? It's worth a nice little sum to you,
  English, if you can find out and report if it's the genuine stones that she
  wears around town up there."</p>

  <p>"But I can't leave my job," I objected.</p>

  <p>"Sure, he can't leave his job," said Jumbo at once.</p>

  <p>"He can go up on Saturday night's boat, and come back Sunday, can't he?"
  said Foxy.</p>

  <p>The matter was so arranged. I suppose I am in for it next Saturday. Will
  you see that Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is warned in some manner? In the meantime I
  am to be taken to see the "friends" that buy and sell diamonds. Here's hoping
  that this may prove to be the grand headquarters of the gang.</p>

  <p>When we left the place, Jumbo excusing himself, pulled Foxy aside, and
  held a brief, whispered consultation with him, which boded ill for
  somebody.</p>

  <p>Their faces were distorted with anger. Foxy took the west- bound
  cross-town car, and we walked over to the subway.</p>

  <p>Jumbo, anxious, I suppose, to make me feel that I had not been left out of
  anything, said: "Me and Frank had a little trouble to-day. There's a bull
  poking his nose into our private business."</p>

  <p>Hoping to hear more, I heartily joined with him in consigning the whole
  race of "bulls" to perdition.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is only an amateur-like," said Jumbo. "He's running a little
  private graft of his own. He ain't dangerous. Me and Foxy's got it fixed to
  trim him nicely."</p>

  <p>This was all I could get. I mention it, thinking that it may be of
  interest to you. I suppose if either of my worthy friends ever suspected that
  I was not a "good fellow," my life would not be worth a jack-straw. The same
  menace lurks behind Jumbo's swimming pig-eyes, and Foxy's dull ones. But I am
  enjoying the spice of danger. The only thing that irks me are the tiresome
  hours at my work bench in Dunsany's. I'll be glad when the game becomes
  livelier. This is life!</p>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of A.N.</span></p>

  <p>June 25th.</p>

  <p>K. Milbourne came out of his boarding-house at 9:20 to-night. Walked East
  to Seventh avenue, North on Seventh to Fifty-eighth street, and East to a
  resort near Third Avenue called "Under the Greenwood Tree," This is a saloon
  and restaurant with a large open air garden in the rear where a band
  plays.</p>

  <p>I waited outside upwards of an hour. Then I went in to see if I held my
  man safe. I found there was a back entrance from the garden out to
  Fifty-ninth street, and he was gone. I'm sorry, but 'accidents will happen!'
  I returned to the boarding house.</p>

  <p>Milbourne came home at 11:35. and judging from the light in his room, went
  directly to bed.</p>

  <p>A.N.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as I had read the two foregoing reports which
  reached in the first mail, I called up Sadie for the purpose of telling her
  to have the operative A. N. transferred to some other duty, as he had
  obviously outlived his usefulness where Milbourne was concerned. This was the
  day following my encounter with Jumbo in his flat.</p>

  <p>Keenan answered the phone and said Sadie had just gone out after reading
  her mail. She had told him she didn't know how long she would be. We did not
  take Keenan very far into our confidence. He knew he was not clever, poor
  fellow, and did not mind his exclusion.</p>

  <p>His words made me vaguely uneasy, for I knew of nothing to take Sadie out
  that morning, and she was very scrupulous about letting know before embarking
  on anything new. However, there was nothing to do until I heard from her. I
  plunged into the work awaiting me. That was considerable. I only giving you
  an occasional report or part of a report which helps on the story a little.
  There were dozens of other lines we were obliged to follow that never
  returned us anything for our work. The office end of my business is the part
  I like least.</p>

  <p>At noon I called the other office again. Sadie had not come in, said
  Keenan, nor had she sent any word. I was downright anxious by this time.
  Sadie must know that I would call her up, I told myself. Surely she would
  never stay away so long without sending in word, unless she were prevented. I
  called up her sister with whom she lived. They had not heard from her there
  since she had left as usual that morning.</p>

  <p>I spent a horrible afternoon, condemned to inaction, while my brain busied
  itself suggesting all the dreadful things that might have happened. Curiously
  enough I thought only of the ordinary accidents of the streets. The truth
  never occurred to me.</p>

  <p>The blow descended about half-past four. Terrible as it was it was like
  relief to hear anything. It came in the form of a special delivery letter,
  mailed as in irony from Station W. Within were two lines more of that damned
  cryptogram, thus:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">SP JAH FUXLJG QCXQ WYE DFB&amp;U OWK MZM&amp;YW SY EUS
  UYHJL FVDH QMWZCDBK QBC YB UOWX.</p>

  <p><br>
  Meaning:</p>

  <p>"If you return what you stole yesterday in the first mail to- morrow all
  will be well."</p>

  <p>On the back of the paper was written another message:</p>

  <p>"They have got me, Ben. Save me!"</p>

  <p>This went to my breast like a knife. It was unquestionably Sadie's
  handwriting. The wild words were so unlike my clever self-contained girl it
  broke me all up. For a while I could not think, could not plan. I could only
  reproach myself for having put one so dear to me in danger.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for humans, old habits of work reassert themselves
  automatically. My brain screwed itself down upon the hardest problem of my
  career. There was not the slightest use in flying up to the flat on One
  Hundredth street. There would be no one there. Neither could I call on the
  police for aid without precipitating the catastrophe. If Sadie was to be
  saved it must be by unaided wits.</p>

  <p>I thought of Mr. Dunsany with hope and gratitude. In him I had a line on
  the gang they did not as yet suspect. I immediately called up Dunsany's and
  asked if I might speak to Mattingly in the jewel-setting department. It was a
  risky thing to do, but I had no choice. Knowing how the gang watched
  Dunsany's, it would have been suicidal for me to have gone there to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>I finally heard his voice at the other end of the wire. "This is Enderby,"
  I said. "Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "what is it?"</p>

  <p>I had to bear in mind the possibility of a curious switchboard operator in
  Dunsany's listening on the 'wire.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to meet your friends tonight?" I asked in ordinary
  tones.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "same as usual."</p>

  <p>"Those fellows have played a trick on me," I said. "They have copped my
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Not Sadie!" he said aghast.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "It's a deuce of a note, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He took the hint, and his voice steadied. "What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Find out if you can without giving yourself away where they have put
  her."</p>

  <p>"I'll try. Where can I meet you?"</p>

  <p>"We can't meet. But watch out for my friend Joe the taxi- driver. He
  stands outside your joint up on Lexington avenue. The number of his licence
  is 11018. It's painted on the side lamps."</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Mr. Dunsany.</p>

  <p><br>
  I cannot give a very clear account of the next hour or two. It was like a
  nightmare. I knew a young fellow that drove a taxi which he hired from a big
  garage by the day. I was depending on him to help out. I had often employed
  him. I searched him out, taking suitable precautions against being trailed.
  He agreed to hire his cab for the night and I went to his room to change
  clothes with him. The visored cap in itself was a pretty good disguise. I had
  made an engagement by telephone with my good friend Oscar Nilson, and he
  fixed up so my own mother wouldn't have known me.</p>

  <p>In my anxious eagerness I arrived at the Turtle Bay Cafe long before the
  hour. None of the men I was looking for had arrived, and I was compelled to
  drive around the streets for another half hour or more. I turned the little
  flag on the meter, to avoid taking any business. Once more I had a drink at
  the bar without seeing any of my men. The third time I returned I caught a
  glimpse of Mr. Dunsany's face at one of the tables, and I waited outside as
  if for a fare who had gone in for a drink.</p>

  <p>After a while I could stand it no longer. My torturing curiosity drove me
  inside. I went to the bar, taking care not to look towards the alcove where
  the three sat. I found I could see them in the mirror without turning my
  head. Mr. Dunsany, or "English," as I shall call him, and "Foxy" each
  presented a side view, while Jumbo, seated farthest within the alcove, faced
  me. Foxy was Milbourne, as you have already guessed.</p>

  <p>All the alcoves down the side of the room were fully occupied. Even if I
  had been able to secure a place in either of the adjoining compartments, I
  doubt if I could have heard any of my men's talk. They had their heads very
  close together. There was an infernal racket in the place. I had to content
  myself with watching Jumbo's lips, wishing vainly that I might read them. I
  had to be careful not to seem to stare, for at any moment he might raise his
  eyes and meet mine in the mirror. My face was revealed in every line by the
  strong lights behind the bar.</p>

  <p>As far as I could make out Jumbo and Foxy were trying to urge something on
  English to which he resisted. His reluctance was so well done I could not
  decide if it were real or assumed. Once more I was compelled to pay tribute
  to my friend and assistant. What a lucky chance it was that had led me to
  him. He was a wonder!</p>

  <p>The other two were an ugly-looking pair at that moment, the one face gross
  and mean, the other sharp and mean. They had dropped their masks. I wondered
  now how I could have thought even for a moment that Milbourne was stupid. His
  long nose, his close- set eyes, the whole eager thrust-forward of his gaunt
  face suggested the evil intelligence of the devil himself. Not for nothing
  was this man called Foxy.</p>

  <p>After a while they seemed to come to an understanding. Jumbo sat back and,
  putting his hand in his pocket, looked around for the waiter. I made a quiet
  exit to my cab outside where I waited for the turn of events.</p>

  <p>They must have had another drink for it was still some moments before they
  issued from between the swinging doors. I saw English's eyes go at once to
  the number on my side lamps, which he read off with visible satisfaction. He
  gave a fleeting glance as I sat nodding on the driver's seat. English was
  making out to show the effects of his liquor a little. The other two were
  cold sober.</p>

  <p>"Say, boys," said English, "let's taxi it up; I'll blow."</p>

  <p>I made believe to come to life, hearing that, hopping out touched my cap
  and opened the door. Foxy frowned and held back. "What's the use?" he
  grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Aw, come on," said English. "I ain't had an auto ride since I landed."
  His slightly foolish air was beautifully done.</p>

  <p>Neither Jumbo nor Foxy liked the idea, but they liked less calling
  attention to themselves by a discussion in the street. So they all piled in.
  Jumbo gave a number on Lexington avenue which would be about half a mile
  North of where we then were.</p>

  <p>There was a hole in the front glass at my ear for the purpose of allowing
  fare to communicate with driver. With the noise of the engine, however, I
  could hear no more than the sound of their voices. It seemed to that both
  Foxy and Jumbo were admonishing English not to drink so much if he couldn't
  carry it better.</p>

  <p>I found my number on a smallish brown stone dwelling facing the great
  sunken railway yards, and drew up before it. It was one of a long row of
  houses, all exactly alike. As my fares climbed out, English said to Jumbo:
  How long will we be in here?"</p>

  <p>"Not long," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Then wait," said English to me. A glance of intelligence passed between
  us.</p>

  <p>"You must like to throw your money away," grumbled Foxy, as they mounted
  the steps.</p>

  <p>They were admitted by a negro man-servant. I examined the surroundings
  more particularly. The excavating of the great yards opposite has damaged the
  neighbourhood as a residential district and the tidy little houses were
  somewhat fallen from their genteel estate. Small, cheap shops had opened in
  one or two of the basements, and beauty parlours, or dry-cleaning
  establishments on the parlour floors. Only one or two houses of the row
  retained a self-respecting air, and of these the house I waited before was
  one. The stone stoop had been renovated, the door handles were brightly
  polished, and the windows cleaned. Simple, artistic curtains showed within.
  In fact it had all the earmarks of the dwelling of a well-to-do old-fashioned
  family which had refused to give up its old home when the first breath of
  disfavour fell upon the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>I should further explain that the houses were three story and basement
  structures with mansard roofs over the cornices. At the corner of the street,
  that is to say three doors from where my cab was standing, there was a new
  building four stories high, which contained a brightly lighted cafe on the
  street level and rooms above. In other words what New Yorkers call a Raines'
  Law Hotel.</p>

  <p>The three men remained inside the house about forty-five minutes, I
  suppose. It seemed like three times that space to me, waiting. They appeared
  at last, talking in slightly heightened tones, which suggested that they had
  partaken of spirituous refreshment inside. Their talk as far as I could hear
  it was all in respectful praise of a lady they had just left. She was a "good
  fellow," a "wise one," "long-headed." At the cab door they hesitated a moment
  as if in doubt of their next move.</p>

  <p>"It's early," said Jumbo. "Let's go back to the Turtle Bay." The others
  agreed.</p>

  <p>English let them get in first. "Back to the Turtle Bay," he said to me.
  His lips added soundlessly: "She is here!"</p>

  <p>When they got out again, English paid off. His expressive eyes said
  clearly that he wished to speak to me further. The others stood close, and we
  dared not take any risk.</p>

  <p>I thanked him, touching my cap. "Any time you want me, gen'lemen, call up
  Plaza 6771," I said. They went inside.</p>

  <p>I had given the first telephone number that came into my head. It was that
  of an artist friend of mine who had a studio apartment on Fifty-ninth street.
  I hastened up there in the car, and routed him out of bed. Artists are used
  to these interruptions. I had a little difficulty, however, in making myself
  known to a man half asleep. He was decent about it, though, gave me tobacco,
  and telling to myself comfortable, went back to bed.</p>

  <p>In an hour or so the telephone bell rang, and to my joy I heard English's
  voice on the wire. "This you?" he said. We named no names.</p>

  <p>"I get you," I said. "Fire away."</p>

  <p>He plunged right into his story and though plainly labouring under
  excitement, was admirably clear and succinct.</p>

  <p>"She is confined in that house. She was lured there this morning by a
  forged letter from you instructing her to go there for certain evidence. I
  did not see her. I understood from their talk that so far she is all
  right."</p>

  <p>"The house is occupied by a woman they call Lorina or Mrs. Mansfield.
  Handsome, blonde woman of forty; great force of character. She is a member of
  the gang, perhaps the leader of it. Anyway, they all defer to her. She has a
  better head than either Jumbo or Foxy. I was taken there to-night for the
  purpose of having her size up. Apparently she approved of me."</p>

  <p>"I understood that the girl is safe until to-morrow morning. Then they
  plan," his voice began to shake here, "to to do away with her."</p>

  <p>"Unless I come across with the paper they want?" I interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Whether you do or not," he said grimly. "They have no intention of
  letting her go. They plan to get you, too, to- morrow."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I was not consulted."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"The-the job they are trying to force on me," he faltered, "is to dispose
  of her body. They chose me because I was not suspected by you, not followed.
  I am to carry it out of the house piecemeal. Oh! it's horrible!"</p>

  <p>"Steady!" I said. "I promise you that won't be necessary. Any more
  particulars?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Mansfield lives alone," he went on. "She has three coloured
  servants, two maids and a man."</p>

  <p>"Did you find out where they slept?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The two maids on the top floor in the front room, the man somewhere
  in the basement."</p>

  <p>"Are they in the gang?"</p>

  <p>"No. They do not know that Miss Farrell is in the house. But the man, I
  understood, could be depended on absolutely. Which means that he is ready for
  any black deed. He is as ugly and strong as a gorilla."</p>

  <p>"What about the other internal arrangements of the house?"</p>

  <p>"On the first floor there is a parlour in front, dining-room and pantry
  behind. On the second floor the front room is a sitting-room or office. The
  telephone is here. Mrs. Mansfield sleeps in the rear room on this floor.
  Between her bedroom and the office there is an interior room, and that is
  where Miss Farrell is confined. This can be entered only through Mrs.
  Mansfield's bedroom."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice the locks on the doors?"</p>

  <p>"No. There was nothing out of the common. On the front door a Yale lock of
  the ordinary pattern."</p>

  <p>"Anything more?"</p>

  <p>"One thing. Mrs. Mansfield goes armed. She has a small automatic pistol
  with a silencer which is evidently her favourite toy. I hope I got what you
  wanted. They were at me every minute. I could not look around much."</p>

  <p>"No one could have done better!" I said heartily.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Where are you?"</p>

  <p>"In my own boarding-house. The party at the Turtle Bay soon broke up. The
  telephone here is in the restaurant in the basement, and everybody sleeps
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>"You had better stay at home until morning," I said, after thinking a
  moment. "It is very likely that they are having you watched to-night."</p>

  <p>"But I must do something. I couldn't sleep."</p>

  <p>There is really nothing you can do now. Stay where you can hear the
  telephone and I'll call you if I need you. I'll call you anyway when I get
  her out safe. If you do not hear from me by say, three o'clock, go to police
  headquarters, tell them all the circumstances, and have the house surrounded
  and forced."</p>

  <p>"I understand."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning if all goes well, you must go to work as usual. I don't
  mean that we shall lose all our work so far if I can help it. They must not
  suspect you."</p>

  <p>"Don't take too big a chance, Ben, the girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. The girl is worth fifty cases to me. But I mean to save
  both."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WENT home for some things I needed, and in less than half
  an hour after the telephone talk I was back in front of the Lexington avenue
  house, still at the wheel of my taxi. I had, however, changed my clothes in
  the meantime. I did not want the chauffeur's uniform I had worn earlier to
  figure in any description that might be circulated in the gang.</p>

  <p>Passing the house slowly I surveyed it from pavement to roof. All the
  windows were dark. The basement windows were open, but were protected as is
  customary by heavy bars. The first floor and the second floor windows were
  closed. The two windows on the top floor which were above the cornice, stood
  open.</p>

  <p>Turning the corner, I came to a stop outside the rear door of the saloon I
  have mentioned. It was after the legal closing hour, but they were serving
  drinks in the back room. I went in and ordered a beer. The desk and the hotel
  register were in this room. You entered from a narrow lobby from which rose
  the steep stairs. I paid for my drink and took it. Choosing a moment when the
  waiter was in the bar, I rose to leave. In the lobby I turned to the right
  instead of the left and mounted the stairs. There was no one to question
  me.</p>

  <p>In one side pocket I carried a small but efficient kit of tools, in the
  other a bottle of chloroform and a roll of cotton. My pistol was in my hip
  pocket. I went up the three flights without meeting any one, lighted by a red
  globe on each landing. There was a fourth flight ending at a closed door
  which I figured must give on the roof. It was bolted on the inside, of
  course, and I presently found myself out under the stars.</p>

  <p>This building, you will remember, was half a story higher than the row of
  dwellings which adjoined it. It was therefore a drop of only six feet from
  the parapet of one roof to the parapet of the other. Easy enough to go; a
  little more difficult perhaps to return that way. From the parapet I stepped
  noiselessly to the roof of the first dwelling, and crossed the two
  intervening roofs to the house I meant to enter. I had nearly two hours
  before Mr. Dunsany would put the police in motion, ample time, I judged.
  Probably the first few minutes in the house would decide success or
  failure.</p>

  <p>There was a flat scuttle in the roof which, as I expected, was fastened
  from within. I could have opened it with my tools, but it seemed to me
  quicker and safer to enter by one of the windows in the mansard. In any case
  I would have to deal with the maids on that floor, and it was likely they
  slept behind locked doors.</p>

  <p>The cornice made a wide, flat ledge in front of these windows. It was a
  simple task to let myself down the sloping mansard to the ledge and creep to
  the window. Had I been seen from the pavement across the way it would have
  ruined all, but the street was deserted as far as I could see up and down.
  There were no houses opposite.</p>

  <p>Pausing with my head inside the window I heard heavy breathing from the
  back of the room. I cautiously let myself in. I could distinguish two
  breathings side by side, and knew that both were sleeping in the same bed. I
  got out my cotton and chloroform. Fortunately for me, negroes are generally
  heavy sleepers. I let each breathe in the fumes before the cotton touched her
  face. They drifted away with scarcely a movement.</p>

  <p>I left the saturated cotton on their faces without any cone to retain the
  fumes. In this way they could not take any injury. The potency of the drug
  would soon be dissipated in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>It was a hot night and the door of their room stood open. I didn't see
  until too late, that a chair been placed against the door to prevent the
  draft from the window slamming it. I stumbled over the chair. It made little
  noise, but the jar caused me to drop the precious bottle, and before I
  recovered it the contents was wasted. This was a serious loss.</p>

  <p>I crept down the first flight of stairs. This landed on the floor where
  the mistress slept. As I approached the door of her room a shrill yapping
  started up inside. I cursed the animal under my breath. English had not told
  that the kept a dog. It made things twice as difficult. The noise sounded
  through the house loud enough, it seemed to me, to wake the dead. I heard
  somebody move inside the room, and I hastened down the next flight of stairs,
  and crouched at the back of the hall outside the dining-room door.</p>

  <p>Over my head I heard the bedroom door unlocked, and presently the upper
  hall was flooded with light. I was safely out of reach of its rays. I offered
  up a silent prayer that the lady would not be moved to descend the stairs,
  for I pictured her carrying the automatic with the silencer. True, I had my
  own gun, but for obvious reasons I was averse to firing it.</p>

  <p>She did not come down. The dog apparently was satisfied that all was well,
  and ceased his yapping. From his voice I judged the animal to be a
  Pomeranian.</p>

  <p>Mistress and dog finally returned to the bedroom and the door was locked
  again. She left the light burning in the upstairs hall. With the dog and the
  lock on the door my problem was no easy one. I had to enter that way before I
  could reach my girl.</p>

  <p>Before attempting to deal with the mistress it seemed to me necessary to
  dispose of the negro in the basement. I went on downstairs not at all
  relishing the prospect. There were swing doors both at the top and the bottom
  of the basement stairs which had to be opened with infinite caution to avoid
  a squeak. On the stairs between it was as dark as Erebus. On every step I
  half expected to find the gorilla-like creature crouching in wait for me, but
  when I finally edged through the lower door I was reassured by the sound of a
  rumbling snore. The dog had not awakened him.</p>

  <p>He slept in the front room. This had originally been the dining-room of
  the house. I cautiously opened the door and looked in. A certain amount of
  light came through the area windows from the street lamps. The negro's bed
  was against the wall between me and the windows. These were the windows which
  were heavily barred outside.</p>

  <p>When I saw the bars and felt the door which was a heavy hardwood affair,
  and had a key in it, I thought it would be sufficient to lock the man in. You
  see I was pretty well assured that none of these people would care to make a
  racket. However, there was another door leading to the pantry, thence to the
  kitchen. This had no lock on it, and I was compelled to find another means of
  confining him.</p>

  <p>Exploring the rear of the basement I came across a trunk in the back hall
  with a stout strap around it. This I softly removed and appropriated. Going
  on through the kitchen out into the yard I found stout clothesline stretched
  from side to side. I cut down several lengths of it.</p>

  <p>While I was in the yard I made an important discovery respecting the lay
  of the back of the house. The lower story extended out some fifteen feet
  above the upper floors. The mistress' windows therefore opened on a flat
  extension roof. These windows were opened and unbarred. There was no light
  within the room.</p>

  <p>I returned with the strap and the lengths of rope to the negro's
  sleeping-room. He was still snoring vociferously. He lay on his back with his
  brawny arms flung above his head like an infant, and his great chest rose
  like a billow with every inhalation. The bed was a small iron one with low
  head and foot. It looked strong, but I knew that these things were generally
  of flimsy construction.</p>

  <p>First I laid my gun on the floor where I could snatch it up at need. Then
  with infinite care I passed my long trunk strap under the bed and over his
  ankles, and drew it close, but not tight. This was intended for a merely
  temporary entanglement. He never stirred. I made a noose out of one of the
  pieces of rope and passed it carefully, carefully over his two hands. During
  this he began to stir. The snores were interrupted. I passed the rope around
  the iron bar at the head of the bed, and as he came fully awake I gave it a
  sharp jerk binding his hands hard and fast. I knotted the rope.</p>

  <p>I flung a pillow over his head, and sat on it to still any cries while I
  made a permanent job of trussing him up. His great frame heaved and plunged
  on the bed in a paroxysm of brutish terror, finding himself bound. You have
  seen a cat with a rope around it. Imagine a mad creature thirty times the
  bulk of a cat. But everything held. The bed rocked and bounced on the floor,
  but there were four closed doors between me and the woman sleeping upstairs,
  and I hoped the sound might not carry.</p>

  <p>It was all over in a moment or two. The ropes were ready to my hand. Every
  time he heaved up I passed a fresh turn under him. Presently I had him bound
  so tight he could not move a muscle. True to the character of his race, he
  gave up the struggle all at once and lay inert. There was a moment in which
  he might have cried out when I changed the pillow for a gag made out of the
  sheet, but by that time he was gasping for breath. I knotted the gag firmly
  between his teeth. Smothered groans issued from under it. I went over all the
  ropes twice to make sure nothing could slip. I expected, of course, that he
  would wriggle out in the end, but I only needed a little while.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding further I gave my stretched nerves a moment or two to
  relax. The big task was still to come. Finally I stole upstairs again. When I
  closed the doors behind me I could no longer hear the negro's smothered
  groans. The house was perfectly quiet. As I softly crept up on all fours
  stair to stair I was busily debating how to open the attack. Locked door,
  silent gun and dog made the odds heavy against me.</p>

  <p>By the time I was half way up the main stairway I had made a plan. Rising
  to my feet I mounted the rest of the way with a firm tread. Instantly the
  little dog inside broke into a frantic barking. I heard his mistress spring
  out of bed. I hastily unscrewed the electric light bulb, and throwing a leg
  over the banisters slid noiselessly down to the first floor again. As before
  I sought the security of the back hall.</p>

  <p>She unhesitatingly opened the door-she was a bold one. I heard her catch
  her breath to find the hall in darkness. Her hand shot out, I heard the click
  of the switch, but of course there was no light. Instantly she began
  shooting. The light "ping" of her weapon had an inexpressibly deadly sound.
  The bullets thudded viciously into wood and plaster. From the direction of
  the latter sounds, she was shooting along the upper hall and down the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>I knew she had ten shots, not more, and I counted them. After the tenth,
  running forward in the hall, I set up a horrid groaning. She was silent
  above. I kept up the groaning, and threshed about on the floor alongside the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she came running down. This was what I had prayed she might do.
  She reached the switch in the lower hall and light flared out. Instantly I
  sprang up the outside of the stairway, vaulted over the banisters and stood
  half way up the stairs, cutting her off, I hoped, from additional
  ammunition.</p>

  <p>She stood at the foot of the stairs gun in hand, glaring up at me. I saw a
  large, handsome woman with a rope of coarse blonde hair as thick as my wrist
  hanging down her back and eyes like lambent blue flames. By her snarl I saw
  that I had the advantage for the moment, but her eyes never quailed. To give
  her her due she was as bold as a lion. I know of few other women of her age
  who would look handsome under the circumstances. She was wearing a pink
  negligee robe over her nightdress. Her feet were bare, they were pretty feet,
  too. The little dog sheltered himself behind her skirts barking madly. I saw
  the woman glance down the hall. No doubt she was wondering why the noise
  didn't bring the negro.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she demanded in a high and mighty tone.</p>

  <p>"Never mind what I want," I returned. "Do what I tell you."</p>

  <p>"If you let me go to my room I'll give you what money I have," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"And load up again," I said smiling.</p>

  <p>"You can watch me. I have two hundred dollars in the house. It's all you
  get, anyway."</p>

  <p>"That's not what I came for."</p>

  <p>By that she knew me. She bared her fine white teeth and raised her
  gun.</p>

  <p>"It's empty," I said laughing. "I counted the shots."</p>

  <p>She swore with heartfelt bitterness like a man.</p>

  <p>I drew my own gun. "This one is loaded," I said. I descended a step or two
  to enforce my orders. I pointed the gun at her. "Open the front door!" I
  commanded. "Go into the vestibule and close it behind you."</p>

  <p>My purpose was to lock her between the two sets of doors while I searched
  for Sadie. She scowled at me sullenly, and for a moment I thought I had her
  beaten; she seemed about to obey. But reflecting perhaps that I didn't want
  to bring in outsiders any more than she, she took a chance. Suddenly putting
  down her head she ran like a deer for the rear hall, the little dog
  whimpering in terror at her heels.</p>

  <p>The door at the head of the basement stairs banged open and she plunged
  down, calling on her servant. I had to make a quick decision. The way was
  presumably open to Sadie, but there were plenty of knives in the kitchen and
  if she liberated the man I would have to fight my way out of the house
  against the two of them. I ran after her. A rough house in the basement
  followed, doors slamming, chairs overturned, and the ceaseless yelping of the
  dog.</p>

  <p>She ran into the front room, saw the negro's predicament, and ran back
  through the pantries to the kitchen. I was close at her heels. She knew just
  where to find her knife, and she was out of the room again by the other door
  before I could stop her. She ran back through the hall to the front room,
  slamming both doors in my face to delay me. She tried to lock the second
  door, but I got my foot in it.</p>

  <p>She flung herself on the negro, sawing at his bonds with the knife.
  Fortunately there was some light in this room. I dragged her off the bed. I
  had only one arm free on account of the gun. She tore herself free from me,
  and turning, came at me stabbing with the knife. I thought my last hour had
  come. I fired over her head. She ran out of the room.</p>

  <p>I stopped to look at my prisoner's bonds. I found them intact. In bending
  over him my foot struck something on the floor. I picked up her gun. She had
  been obliged to drop it in order to use the knife. I ran after her. As I put
  foot on the upper stairs I heard her slam her bedroom door and turn the key.
  So there I had my work to do all over but not quite all, for I had the gun
  now, and it was hardly likely she would have another.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAMMERED on the door with the butt of my revolver a little
  noise more or less scarcely mattered now, and commanded her to open it.</p>

  <p>She was not so easily to be intimidated. Through the door she consigned me
  to the nether world. "If you break in the door I'll croak the girl," she
  threatened.</p>

  <p>I believed her capable of it. Remembering the knife she carried, I
  shuddered. We spent some moments in exchanging amenities through the door. I
  wished to keep her occupied, while I threshed around in my head for some
  expedient to trap her.</p>

  <p>"All right!" I cried, giving the door a final rattle. "I'll get the poker
  from the furnace."</p>

  <p>She laughed tauntingly.</p>

  <p>Of course I had no such intention. I had suddenly remembered the open
  windows on the roof of the extension. It seemed easier to drop from above
  than climb from below, so I went upstairs.</p>

  <p>The room over Mrs. Mansfield's bedroom was unlocked and untenanted. I took
  off my shoes at the threshold, and crept across with painful care to avoid
  giving her warning below. Unfortunately the windows were closed. I lost
  precious time opening one of them a fraction of an inch at a time. Finally I
  was able to lean out. She had lighted up her room. I could see the glow on
  the sill below. To my great satisfaction I saw that she had pulled down the
  blinds, without, however, closing the window under me. For while I looked the
  blind swayed out a little in the draft. Evidently the possibility of an
  attack from that side had not occurred to her.</p>

  <p>It was a drop of about fourteen feet from the window sill on which I
  leaned to the roof of the extension below. I dared not risk it. Even suppose
  I escaped injury, the noise of my fall would warn her, and the moments it
  would take me to recover my balance might give her time to execute her foul
  plan. I believed that she had my girl locked in the inner room (else I should
  surely have heard from Sadie). This would give me one second, while she was
  unlocking the door but only one second.</p>

  <p>The bed in the room I was in was made up. Always with the same precautions
  of silence I fashioned a rope sufficiently long out of the two sheets and the
  cotton spread. I fastened the end of the rope to the leg of a heavy bureau
  beside the window, and carefully paid it out over the sill. Before trusting
  myself to it I planned every movement in advance.</p>

  <p>I must let myself down face to the building, I decided, until I had almost
  reached the roof. Then I must drop, and with the reflex of the same movement
  spring into the woman's room. It worked all right. I was already inside when
  she turned around. It was well that it was so, because the door into the
  inner room stood wide. I saw my girl lying on a couch. Like a flash the woman
  had the lights out. Quick as a cat she was through the door, knife in hand.
  But I had got my bearings with that one glimpse. I was hard upon her. I flung
  my arms around her from behind, pinioning her close. I dragged her back into
  the outer room. She was surprisingly strong for a woman, but I was just a
  little stronger. She spit out curses like an angry cat.</p>

  <p>I dragged her across the room to where the switch was. I had to take an
  arm from her to search for it. She renewed her struggles. It took half a
  dozen attempts. Once she escaped me altogether. She still had the knife. I do
  not know how I managed to escape injury. She slit my coat with it. At last I
  got the blessed light turned on. She was still jabbing at me with the knife,
  but I could see what I was doing now. The little dog fastened his teeth in my
  ankle. I kicked him across the room.</p>

  <p>Between the two doors I have mentioned there was a third door, which
  evidently gave on a closet. It had a key in it. I dragged my captive to it,
  and somehow managed to get it open. I flung her in, knife and all, slammed
  the door, locked it, and leaned against the frame sobbing for breath. I was
  half blinded by the sweat in my eyes. The woman was all in, too, or I never
  should have got the door closed. For a while she lay where she had fallen
  without sound or movement. When his mistress disappeared the dog ran under
  the bed. His little pipe was now so hoarse he could scarcely make himself
  heard.</p>

  <p>Presently the woman recovered her forces. Springing up, she hurled herself
  against the door with as much force as she could gather in that narrow space.
  The door opened out, and the lock was a flimsy one. I saw that I couldn't
  keep her there for long. I ran into the inner room.</p>

  <p>My dearest girl was lying on a couch, fully dressed and unfettered, but
  strangely inert, stupefied. I was terrified by her aspect. However, her body
  was warm and she was breathing, though not naturally. She was not wholly
  unconscious. Her head moved on the pillow, and her misty eyes sought mine
  with a faint returning gleam of sentience. Obviously she had been drugged,
  and the effect was just now beginning to wear off.</p>

  <p>I could not stop to restore her there. I gathered her up in my arms,
  snatched up her hat which was lying near, and ran out through the bedroom. I
  had no more than got the bedroom door locked behind me, when the door of the
  closet burst open, and the woman fell out into the room. She immediately
  threw herself against the other door, but as regarded that, my mind was
  easier. It was a much heavier affair, and it opened towards her. I need not
  point out that there is a considerable difference, between bursting a door
  out, and pulling it in.</p>

  <p>I carried my precious burden down the stairs, murmuring phrases in her ear
  that I did not know I had at my command. She commenced to weep, a very
  encouraging sign. I believe I wept with her. She was dearer to me than my
  life.</p>

  <p>I paused at the front door to try to bring her to somewhat before
  venturing out into the street, unfortunately there was no water within reach.
  I was afraid to take much time. The woman upstairs had obtained some kind of
  a weapon with which she was battering the door. In her insane passion she had
  forgotten all considerations of prudence. She finally managed to split one of
  the panels; the key, however, was safe in my pocket. She hurled imprecations
  after us.</p>

  <p>I opened the outer door a little, and the fresh air revived my dearest
  girl marvellously. Presently she was able to stand with a little assistance.
  Her first conscious act was to pin on her hat with a piteous assumption of
  her usually composed manner. For a long time she could not speak, but she
  knew me now, and leaned on me trustfully.</p>

  <p>I knew how best to reach her. "Brace up!" I whispered urgently. "Pull
  yourself together. I need you. Show me what you can do!"</p>

  <p>She smiled as much as to say she was ready for anything. Such was her
  temper.</p>

  <p>We went out, closing both doors behind us. I fully expected to see a knot
  of the curious on the steps, attracted by the strange sounds from within. But
  the street was still empty. There must be a lot of strange things happening
  that no one ever knows of. We did not meet anybody until we got around the
  corner. Here a policeman stood idly swinging his club and staring at the
  taxicab, speculating no doubt on the mystery of its apparent abandonment and
  wondering what he ought to do about it. The back room of the saloon was now
  closed.</p>

  <p>I saluted him, inwardly praying that he would not be led to look down at
  my feet. I had managed to keep my cap through all vicissitudes, but I had no
  shoes on. I briskly opened the door, and helped Sadie in.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, Miss," said I.</p>

  <p>Then I ran completely around the car to avoid the bluecoat, and cranked
  her. Even then I could hear in the stillness the muffled sound of the woman's
  blows on the door. The policeman was apparently unaware of anything amiss.
  Fortunately my engine popped at the first turn. The policeman's suspicions of
  me were gathering, but he was a slow-thinking specimen.</p>

  <p>"Hold on a minute, fellow," he said at last.</p>

  <p>The car was then in motion, and I made believe not to hear him. Apparently
  he did not think it worth while to raise an alarm. I cannot tell you with
  what a feeling of thankfulness I left that neighbourhood behind me.</p>

  <p>I took Sadie direct to her sister's. We found that young woman in a pretty
  state of fluster. She was of an emotional type, very different from the
  matter-of-fact Sadie. Maybe she didn't give it to me for leading her darling
  into danger! But I was happy enough to be able to take it with a grin.</p>

  <p>Sadie by this time could speak for herself. She took my part. I telephoned
  from here to English at his boarding-house as I had agreed. I still had more
  than half an hour to the good.</p>

  <p>He gave a restrained whoop when he heard my voice. "You've got her!" he
  cried. "You're both all right?"</p>

  <p>"Right as rain!"</p>

  <p>"Ben, you're a wonder!"</p>

  <p>At that moment I was quite prepared to believe it.</p>

  <p>"How did you manage it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Can't tell you now. The game is only starting."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"Go to bed. Above all keep them from suspecting you. The whole case
  depends on you now. I will write you care of Dunsany's on Monday."</p>

  <p>"Take care of yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Same to you!"</p>

  <p>Warning the girls to be ready to start for the country in an hour, I
  borrowed a pair of brother-in-law's shoes and returned the taxi to its
  garage. I then went home and washed and dressed myself in my own clothes.
  Afterwards I got out my own little car and went back for Sadie. By this time
  the dawn was breaking. It was Sunday.</p>

  <p>I found Sadie quite her own self again, and flatly rebellious at being
  ordered to give up the game and retire to the country. In vain I explained to
  her that these people had their backs against the wall now, and that our
  lives were not worth a farthing dip if they ever caught sight of us. Sister
  was now on my side, not, however, without a few back shots at the one who had
  first got her Sadie into the crooks' bad books. It was not until I said that
  I was myself going to lie low for a while that Sadie gave in. I'm afraid at
  that, that her opinion of me suffered a fall for the time being.</p>

  <p>The dearest girl was furious when she learned that I had almost been
  frightened out of my wits by the message from her they had sent me, so much
  so that I had been prepared to drop the whole case to save her.</p>

  <p>"That was what they were after!" she cried. "I had to write it, of course,
  because she held a pistol to my head. But I was sure you would understand. If
  I had thought for a moment that you would let it interfere with the case I
  would have let her shoot."</p>

  <p>I shuddered. One did not know whether to praise or blame such game folly.
  However, I registered a little vow privately not to let Sadie's enthusiasm
  lead her into danger again. Meanwhile I hugged her right there with sister
  looking on. She promptly slapped my face but not so hard as usual.</p>

  <p>I took the sisters to that same little sanatorium at Amityville, Long
  Island, where Sadie had been before with Miss Hamerton. The doctor-proprietor
  was an old friend of mine. A single warning word to him, and I knew they
  would be as safe as I could guard them myself.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding Sadie's violent objections (she said she had been lured to
  Amityville under false pretenses), I motored right back to town. I did intend
  to lay off for a day or two but I had to put my office in order first. It was
  about eight o'clock when I got back to Manhattan. I put up my car and had an
  excellent breakfast. I thought if I was going to be plugged it might as well
  be on a full stomach. I did not deceive myself as to the risk I ran in
  visiting my office, but it was absolutely necessary for me to secure certain
  papers and destroy others.</p>

  <p>I took a taxi down and ordered the man to wait. I cleaned everything up in
  case the place should be entered during my absence. What papers I meant to
  take with me I deposited in a satchel, and took the precaution of strapping
  it to my wrist. Then I locked up and returned down stairs. I found that my
  chauffeur had moved away from the doorway a little, consequently I was
  exposed for a moment or two on the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>It was sufficient. I heard that deadly little "ping" and simultaneously a
  sound like a slap on bare flesh. I did not know I was hit, but I fell down.
  Then a pain like the searing of a hot iron passed through my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I'm shot!" I cried involuntarily.</p>

  <p>I realised that I was not seriously hurt. However, I had no mind to get up
  and make myself a target for more. I made believe to close my eyes, and lay
  still. My mind worked with a strange clearness. I saw the woman across the
  street. She was poorly dressed with a shawl over her head, but I recognised
  the stature and the curves of my antagonist of the night before.</p>

  <p>The usual gaping crowd gathered. Nobody had heard the shot but me. While
  all eyes were directed on me the woman coolly walked away across the park,
  tossing the gun into the middle of a bush as she went. I said nothing. It was
  no part of my game to have her arrested.</p>

  <p>I suspected that the openmouthed crowd surrounding me was full of spies,
  so I made out to be worse hurt than I was, groaning and writhing a little.
  The wound helped me out by bleeding profusely. One youth with an evil face
  made to take my satchel as if to relieve me. The strap frustrated his humane
  purpose. He was afraid to proceed further under that circle of eyes.</p>

  <p>Somebody had telephoned for an ambulance, and presently it came clanging
  up with a fresh crowd in its train. The white clad surgeon bent over me.</p>

  <p>"I am not badly hurt," I whispered to him, "but please take me away
  quickly out of this mob."</p>

  <p>I was carried to Bellevue Hospital where I engaged a private room. My
  wound, a slight affair, was cauterised I had in mind the possibility of
  poison, and dressed. Afterwards I enjoyed my first sleep in twenty-four
  hours. I had left instructions that no one was to be admitted to see me, and
  that no information regarding my condition was to be given out.</p>

  <p>By the next day I was quite myself again. I had already seen the
  reporters, and by the exercise of persuasion and diplomacy had managed to
  keep the affair from being unduly exploited in the papers. The police, good
  fellows, were hard at work on the case, but they could hardly be expected to
  accomplish anything without the evidence which I did not intend to let them
  have. The doctors who hate to see any one escape out of their hands so easily
  did their best to persuade me to stop a while in the hospital and 'rest' but
  how could I rest with so much to do outside?</p>

  <p>Having decided that I must leave the hospital, it was a matter of
  considerable concern to me how this was to be effected without exposing
  myself to a fresh danger. I had received a disguised telephone message from
  English to the effect that they were waiting for me. I decided to confide in
  the visiting surgeon, an understanding man.</p>

  <p>"Sir," I said, "I am a private detective. I have a gang of crooks almost
  ready to be rounded up. Knowing it, they are desperate. That is the
  explanation of the attack on me. Now the chances are that the instant I step
  outside the hospital I'll stop another bullet. What would you do if you were
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Call on the police," he said, of course.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that without exploding my charges prematurely."</p>

  <p>As I said, he was an understanding man. He didn't bother me with a lot of
  questions, but took the case as he found it. After thinking a while, he
  said:</p>

  <p>"How would it do if I had you transferred in an ambulance to my private
  clinic on I Street. You see, you'll be loaded on out of sight in the hospital
  yard here, and you will be driven right inside my place to be unloaded. You
  lie flat in the ambulance and no one can see inside without climbing on the
  step, and a surgeon sits there."</p>

  <p>"Fine!" I said. "You're a man of resource." He gave the order, and it was
  so done. Arrived at his private hospital I dressed myself in street clothes,
  borrowing a coat to replace my bloody one, and calling a taxi, had myself
  carried to Oscar Nilson's shop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE mentioned, I believe, that Oscar Nilson was a wig-
  maker, the best in New York. His little shop on a quiet side street North of
  Madison Square is quaint enough to be the setting of an old-fashioned play.
  The walls are lined with old cuts of historical personages and famous
  Thespians as historical personages, all with particular attention to their
  hirsute features. On the counter stands a row of forms, each bearing some
  extraordinary kind of scalp. Oscar deals in make-up as a side line and the
  air bears the intoxicating odour of grease paint and cold cream.</p>

  <p>Oscar's business is chiefly with the theatrical profession, but many an
  old beau and fading belle have found out that he knows more about restoring
  youth than the more fashionable beautifiers. Oscar loves his business. His
  knowledge, historical, artistic, scientific, is immense but all in terms of
  human hair. He can tell you offhand how Napoleon wore his in 1803 or any
  other year of his career, and will make you an exact sketch of the toupee
  ordered by the Duke of Wellington when his fell out.</p>

  <p>Oscar himself, strangely enough, or perhaps naturally, has next to no hair
  of his own, merely a little mousy fringe above the ears. He has a jolly
  rubicund face and is held in high affection and esteem by his customers. He
  flatters me by taking a particular interest in my custom. I am the only one
  of his clients in the criminal line.</p>

  <p>He led me into one of the little cubicles where the trying-on takes place,
  and stood off to observe me from between narrowed lids.</p>

  <p>"What will it be now?" he said. "I was sorry to read of your
  accident."</p>

  <p>"A mere trifle. What would you suggest? It must stand sunlight and shadow,
  and be something I can keep up for a while if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Let me think! Your head and face offer a good starting-point for so many
  creations!"</p>

  <p>"In other words the Lord left me unfinished," I said, teasingly.</p>

  <p>"Not at all! I meant that in your case there were no awkward malformations
  to be overcome."</p>

  <p>From which it will be seen that Oscar is a diplomat.</p>

  <p>"What would you say to a South American gentleman?" he asked. "New York is
  full of them in the summer."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "No time to bone up a Spanish accent."</p>

  <p>"An officer of a liner on shore leave."</p>

  <p>"On shore they look like anybody else."</p>

  <p>"Well then, how about an Armenian fruit peddler?"</p>

  <p>"That would restrict my activities too much. I must be able to go
  anywhere."</p>

  <p>"I see you have an idea of your own," he said. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"We've used several roughneck disguises," I said. "Suppose you fix me up
  as a swell this time. I have a mind to stop at a fashionable hotel."</p>

  <p>"The very thing!" cried Oscar. "A curled toupee, slightly silvered; a wash
  for the skin to give an interesting pallor; a little touching up about the
  eyes for an expression of world weariness; waxed moustache, monocle..."</p>

  <p>"Easy! The burning-glass would give me dead away. You have to be born to
  that."</p>

  <p>"Well you don't have to have the monocle," said Oscar regretfully. "But
  it's very aristocratic." The costume must be exquisitely appointed-it will be
  expensive."</p>

  <p>"Expense is no object in this case," I said.</p>

  <p>He set to work and an hour later I left his shop a changed man. In the
  event of such a contingency I had already secured from Mr. Dunsany the name
  of his tailor, and I now left him a rush order for several suits. Meanwhile I
  bought the best I could ready made. I went to the most fashionable outfitters
  and invested heavily. Until they displayed their stock here, I had no idea
  that men might indulge such extravagant tastes. All this was to be sent to
  the Hotel Rotterdam where I engaged an expensive suite. I believed that it
  would be the last place in town where the gang would think of looking for
  me.</p>

  <p>I wished to persuade them that I had been scared off. After having the
  cryptogram receipt photographed, I returned it in a plain envelope to Jumbo's
  flat. By telephone I instructed Keenan to discharge all the operatives, close
  the Forty-second street office and advertise it for rent. This place had
  outlived its usefulness. Jumbo, Foxy, et al., had proved themselves more than
  a match for such operatives as could be hired.</p>

  <p>This done, I went out to Amityville to spend a day with Sadie. I had
  promised to lay off for a little, and anyway I had to wait until my new
  clothes were done before being seen around town. After the mad excitement of
  the past few days, we spent a heavenly peaceful interlude under the oaks of
  my friend's big place.</p>

  <p>While I was out there an interesting report from my sole remaining
  operative arrived.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 10</span></p>

  <p>June 27th.</p>

  <p>As soon as I heard that you and S.F. were all right I went to bed as you
  instructed. It seemed to me that I had scarcely fallen asleep when I was
  awakened by my landlady at my door to say that a man wanted to see me. It was
  no more than daybreak then. Hard upon her knock Jumbo entered the room. I had
  barely time to pull on my false hair and fix it. Hereafter I shall have to
  sleep in it.</p>

  <p>Jumbo was in a state of no little excitement. He gave me his version of
  what had happened. Lorina, having apparently just escaped from her room, had
  called him up about half an hour before. I am not sure but that Jumbo came to
  me because she had suggested a suspicion of me. However, I think it more
  likely that he just wanted moral support. He was badly frightened. Jumbo for
  all his bluff, is not a strong character. He is dependent both on Foxy and on
  the woman, and now seems disposed to lean on me. If he was suspicious my
  sleepiness and bad-temper upon being awakened must have reassured him.</p>

  <p>I dressed and we went right up to the Lexington Avenue house. Being
  Sunday, I had the day to myself. Mrs. Mansfield had gone out leaving word
  that we were to wait until she came in or telephoned. The maids believed that
  she had gone to consult the police. These two were full of highly-coloured
  accounts of the supposed robbery of the night before. The hulking black man,
  however, was silent and sullen. He knew. I wonder what you did to him. I
  don't think I ever saw a more repulsive human creature or one more
  powerful.</p>

  <p>Foxy arrived shortly after we did. I am now admitted to terms of the
  closest equality by these two. The understanding is that each knows enough to
  the discredit of the others to ensure faithfulness all around. We all chafed
  at the enforced inaction, but dared not go against Lorina's instructions. She
  is the boss. The other two half expected the police to descend on the house
  momentarily.</p>

  <p>About ten o'clock Mrs. Mansfield returned in a taxi-cab. This taxi, by the
  way, is her property and the driver is one of the gang. The woman was
  handsomely dressed without disguise of any kind.</p>

  <p>We had a conference in the sitting-room upstairs. Mrs. Mansfield gave us
  some further details of the previous night. As soon as she succeeded in
  breaking out of her room after telephoning to Jumbo and Foxy she hastened up
  to S. F.'s house, also to your place, both of which addresses she knew. She
  said that she was disguised, so she must have some place outside where she
  changes her clothes. She found she was too late at both places. You had
  carried off S. F. in your automobile.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mansfield then went down to Fortieth street. From the park opposite,
  she watched your office for four hours. You got inside too quick for her, she
  said, but when you came out she potted you. Her eyes gleamed like a devil's
  as she said it. Fancy how my heart went down.</p>

  <p>She had then changed her clothes and come straight home. She couldn't tell
  how seriously she had wounded you. A general prayer went around the table
  that it would be your finish. She said we should hear presently.</p>

  <p>She seems to have an unlimited number of men subject to her orders. While
  she waited for you at your office she had sent for several, and posted them
  near. They mixed in the crowd that surrounded you when you fell. One of them
  had been instructed to make away with your satchel. Another was to follow the
  ambulance to the hospital. A third was to recover her gun after the
  excitement was over and return it to her.</p>

  <p>The first of these, an evil-looking young black-guard, came in while we
  talked. He reported no success. The satchel was strapped to your wrist, he
  said, and when he started to unfasten it the crowd began to murmur. He said
  that you had been shot in the shoulder, and had been carried to Bellevue. He
  gave it as his opinion that you were not as badly hurt as you made out. This
  cheered me greatly. Bitter disappointment was expressed around the table.</p>

  <p>Later another of Lorina's men reported by telephone that he had learned
  through an orderly in the hospital that you had suffered only a slight flesh
  wound, and would be able to leave the hospital next day. On hearing this she
  gave her orders to have every exit from the hospital watched. Instructions
  were to shoot to kill. If it can be found out in advance what time you are
  going to leave, she means to be on hand herself.</p>

  <p>As soon as I could get out without exciting suspicion, I sent you a
  warning by telephone.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 11</span></p>

  <p>June 28th.</p>

  <p>Today I had to go to my work as usual, so I didn't see any of the gang
  until night. In our present state of excitement and uncertainty we have
  abandoned the Turtle Bay as a meeting place. I found my partners in anything
  but a good humour.</p>

  <p>In the first place they had learned through the friendly orderly that in
  spite of all their measures, you had been safely spirited out of the hospital
  in an ambulance. It was learned by way of the ambulance driver that you had
  been carried to Dr.'s private hospital. It was then too late to do anything.
  By the time they got there, you had left, and the town had swallowed you
  up.</p>

  <p>The entire strength of the gang, excepting me, has been devoted all day to
  picking up your trail, so far without any success. They have watched all your
  usual haunts, your flat, your restaurant, S. F.'s home and your office on
  Fortieth street. Foxy brought in word that the International Bureau on
  Forty-Second street had been closed, and all the operatives discharged. He
  trailed Keenan, the supposed manager, to the office of the Railway, where he
  was reengaged for his old position.</p>

  <p>Jumbo came in with the information that the piece of evidence which they
  regarded as of such importance had been returned to him. I don't know what
  this was. Lorina, examining it, said that it appeared to have the remains of
  paste on the corners, and that you had probably had it photographed.</p>

  <p>Foxy gave it as his opinion that you had been scared off. "We know there
  is no one backing him," said he. "He has no financial resources. He can't
  keep it up."</p>

  <p>Lorina would have none of it. Her eyes become incandescent with hatred
  when your name is mentioned now. "Don't you believe it," she snarled. "That
  man will never give up. I have seen his face and I know! He's a bull-dog. He
  will never rest until he has pulled us down, unless we stop him with a
  bullet."</p>

  <p>Jumbo became panicky. His suggestion was for the gang to scatter and lie
  low for the time being.</p>

  <p>Lorina scorned him. She proceeded to point out to us all just where you
  stood. She appeared to know as well as you do. Her insight is uncanny. You
  have no case, she said, except possibly against Foxy. You are too conceited
  to be satisfied with one. You will not strike until you have a chance of
  landing the whole gang.</p>

  <p>"But how about the kidnapping?" asked Jumbo.</p>

  <p>"The police would have been here before this if Enderby wanted to proceed
  on that," she said. "Why, he watched me walk away after I shot him; and never
  said a word. No, I tell you he hasn't got the evidence yet, and we're safe
  until he gets it. He's aiming to make a grand haul of the whole gang
  together, and get his name in the headlines."</p>

  <p>The others were considerably impressed. They asked for instructions.</p>

  <p>"We've got to go on just as we are," said Lorina. "Foxy must keep the room
  on Forty-Ninth street, Jumbo the flat on One Hundredth street, and I stay
  here. Let everybody go about freely, and meet here as usual, that is, all
  except English. English mustn't come here again. Enderby isn't on to him
  yet.</p>

  <p>"Enderby, if I have the right dope, will lie low for a few days and then
  thinking that we are lulled to security, will quietly start to work again.
  That's why we must keep our present hangouts. He's got to come to one of them
  to pick us up, and then we'll have him."</p>

  <p>This woman is a wonder in her way. Fortunately, there is one fact that
  spoils all her reasoning-your humble servant.</p>

  <p>As we broke up she said a significant thing. "Lord! the conceit of the
  man, thinking he can break up the gang! Why if he did land all of us it
  wouldn't make any difference. He hasn't got within a mile of the real
  boss!"</p>

  <p>Being excited she spoke more recklessly than usual. So it appears that our
  work perhaps is just beginning!</p>

  <p>J.M.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON Wednesday morning I motored to town and took up my
  residence in the Hotel Rotterdam. I hardly knew myself amidst such grandeur.
  For several days the situation remained in status quo. I learned from
  English's daily reports that Lorina and her gang were still waiting for my
  first move. I, for my part, was determined to make them move first.</p>

  <p>Only one of his reports gave me anything to do. I quote from it:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Among all the men who come and go in this den of crooks
  there is one that has particularly excited my interest and compassion. It is
  an extremely good-looking boy of eighteen or thereabouts whom I know simply
  as Blondy. He seems so like a normal boy, jolly, frank and mischievous, that
  I keep wondering how he fell into Lorina's clutches. He reminds me of my boy
  Eddie at his age. Lorina has him thoroughly intimidated. She is more
  overbearing with him than the others. He seems not to be trusted very far,
  but is used as errand boy and spy. His extreme good looks and ingenuous air,
  make him valuable to them I fancy.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Blondy's instinct seems to have led him to make friends
  with me, though as far as he knows I am no better than the rest. At any rate
  we have had a few talks together and feel quite intimate. Without any
  suggestion from me, he has kept this from the others. It is quite
  touching.</p>

  <p class="quote">"I would like very much to get the boy out of this before
  the grand catastrophe. I'm sure he's worth saving. Naturally in my position I
  can't undertake any missionary work. Could you with safety arrange for some
  one to get hold of the boy? He tells me that he lives at the Adelphi
  Association House, No. West 125th street. Apparently it is a
  semi-philanthropic club or boarding- house for young men. He passes there by
  the name of Ralph Manly."</p>

  <p><br>
  I was in almost as unfavorable a position for undertaking "missionary work"
  as Mr. Dunsany. After thinking the matter over I decided to again ask the
  help of the famous surgeon who had befriended me in the hospital. I called at
  his office for the ostensible purpose of consulting him as to my health. When
  I was alone with him in his consulting room I made myself known. Being a
  human kind of man, notwithstanding his eminence, he was interested in the
  dramatic and mysterious elements of my story. Far from abusing me for taking
  up his valuable time, he expressed himself as very willing to help save the
  boy.</p>

  <p>We consulted a directory of charities in his office, and he found that he
  was acquainted with several men on the board of managers of the Adelphi
  Association. This offered an opening. He promised to proceed with the
  greatest caution, and promised to write to me at my hotel if he had any
  luck.</p>

  <p>Three days later I heard from him as follows:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"I took my friend on the Adelphi board partly into my
  confidence, and between him and the doctor employed by the association to
  safeguard the health of the boys, the matter was easily arranged. The
  doctor's regular weekly visit to the institution fell yesterday. He saw the
  boy, and making believe to be struck by something in his appearance, put him
  through an examination. He hinted to the boy that he was in rather a bad way,
  and instructed him to report to my office for advice this morning.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The young fellow showed up in a very sober state of mind.
  He is really as sound as a dollar, but for the present I am keeping him
  anxious without being too explicit. He appears to be quite as attractive a
  youth as your friend said. I am very much interested, but am not yet prepared
  to make up my mind about him. He is coming to-morrow at two-thirty. If it is
  convenient for you to be here, I will arrange a meeting as if by
  accident."</p>

  <p><br>
  Needless to say, I was at the doctor's office at the time specified. I found
  the blonde boy already waiting among other patients in the outer office. It
  was easy to recognise him from Mr. Dunsany's description. He was better than
  merely good- looking; he had nice eyes. He was dressed a little too showily
  as is natural to a boy of that age when he is allowed to consult his own
  taste exclusively.</p>

  <p>There happened to be a vacant chair beside him and I took it. Presently I
  addressed some friendly commonplace to him. He responded naturally. Evidently
  he was accustomed to having people like him. Soon we were talking away like
  old friends. I was more and more taken with him. Primarily, it was his good
  looks, of course, the universal safe-conduct, but in addition to that I was
  strongly affected by a quality of wistfulness in the boy's glance, of which
  he himself was quite unconscious. Surely, I said to myself, a boy of his age
  had no business to be carrying around a secret sorrow. The doctor, issuing
  from his consulting room, saw us hobnobbing together, and allowed us to wait
  until everybody else had been attended to.</p>

  <p>He had me into the consulting room first. "Well, what do you think of
  him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am charmed," I said. "There are no two words about it."</p>

  <p>"So was I," he said, "but I didn't want to raise your hopes too high in my
  letter."</p>

  <p>After discussing a little what we would do with him, we had the boy
  in.</p>

  <p>"Ralph, my friend, Mr. Boardman, wished to be regularly introduced," said
  the doctor.</p>

  <p>Boardman was the name I had taken in my present disguise.</p>

  <p>The boy shook hands nicely, he was neither too bashful, nor too brash, and
  some facetious remarks were made all around.</p>

  <p>"I tell Boardman," said the doctor, 'that if he had done his duty by his
  country and had had half a dozen sons like you he would have no time to be
  worrying about his appendix now."</p>

  <p>"Has your father got half a dozen like you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>An expression of pain ran across the boy's face. "I have no brothers," he
  said. "My father is dead."</p>

  <p>"Well, since you're a fatherless son, and I'm a son-less father with an
  appendix, perhaps we can cheer each other up a little," I said. "Will you
  have dinner with me at my hotel tonight?"</p>

  <p>Boys never see anything suspicious in sudden overtures of friendship.
  Ralph accepted, blushing with pleasure.</p>

  <p>The dinner was a great success. I don't know which of us was the better
  entertained. My young friend's prattle, ingenuous, boastful, light-headed,
  renewed my own boyhood. It was rather painful though to see one naturally so
  frank, obliged to pull up when he found himself approaching dangerous ground.
  Then he would glance at me to see if I had noticed anything.</p>

  <p>I had him several times after that. It was a risk, of course, but one must
  take risks. At the same time I was pretty sure from Mr. Dunsany's reports
  that Ralph never talked of his outside affairs to any of the gang. At least
  he never told Mr. Dunsany anything about his dinners with Mr. Boardman at the
  Rotterdam, and he was friendly with him.</p>

  <p>The denouement of this incident really belongs a little later in my story,
  but for the sake of continuity I will give it here.</p>

  <p>I soon saw that I would have no difficulty in winning Ralph's full
  confidence. His gratitude for friendliness was very affecting. I could see
  that he often wished to bare his painful secret. I let him take his own time
  about it.</p>

  <p>It was the doctor's offering him a position in a friend's office that
  brought matters to a head. Ralph refused it with a painful air. He could give
  no reason for it to the doctor. Afterwards when I had him alone with me I saw
  that it was coming.</p>

  <p>"That certainly was decent of Dr. &mdash;&mdash;," he said diffidently. "I
  don't know why he's so good to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're not a bad sort of boy," I said lightly.</p>

  <p>"You, too," he said shyly. "Especially you. I I never had a man friend
  before."</p>

  <p>I smiled encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you wonder why I couldn't take the position?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"That's your affair."</p>

  <p>"But I want to tell you. I I wouldn't be allowed to take it. I am not a
  free agent."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we could help you to be one," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe you wouldn't want to have anything more to do with
  me. Oh, there's a lot I want to tell you!" he cried imploringly. "But I don't
  know how you'll take it."</p>

  <p>"Try me."</p>

  <p>"Would you-would you kick me out," he said, agitated and breathless, "if
  you knew that my dad had committed a forgery, if you knew that he had died in
  prison?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no," I said calmly, "I suspect you were not responsible for
  that."</p>

  <p>A sigh of relief escaped him. "You are kind! But that's only the
  beginning," he went on. "But I feel I can tell you now. I'm in an awful hole.
  I suppose you will think I'm a weak character for not trying to get out of it
  more, and I am weak, but I didn't know what to do!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," I said.</p>

  <p>And he did; all about Lorina and Foxy and Jumbo as he knew them. They
  didn't trust him far. He knew nothing of their actual operations, but his
  honest young heart told him they were crooks. Lorina held him under a spell
  of terror. He had not up to this time been able to conceive of the idea of
  escaping her. There are those who would blame the boy, I have no doubt, but I
  am not one of them. I have seen too often that a mind which may afterwards
  become strong and self-reliant is at Ralph's age fatally subservient to older
  minds. Those who would blame him should remember that until he met the doctor
  and me he had not a disinterested friend in the world. They must grant that
  he instantly reacted to kindness and decent feelings.</p>

  <p>"How did you first get into this mess?" I asked, strongly curious.</p>

  <p>"I'd have to tell you my whole life to explain that."</p>

  <p>"Fire away."</p>

  <p>I will give you Ralph's story somewhat abridged.</p>

  <p>"My mother died when I was a baby," he said. "I do not remember her. My
  father and I lived alone with servants who were always changing. We did not
  seem to catch on with people. I mean, we didn't seem to have friends like
  everybody had. I thought this was strange when I was little. My father was
  quite an old man, but we got along pretty well. He was what they called a
  handwriting expert. He wrote books about handwriting. Lawyers consulted him,
  and he gave evidence at trials."</p>

  <p>"What was his name?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"David Andrus."</p>

  <p>Now I remembered the trial of David Andrus, so I was in a position to
  check up that part of Ralph's story.</p>

  <p>"I was twelve years old," he went on, "when Mrs. Mansfield first began
  coming to our apartment. I don't know where or how my father met her, of
  course. He knew her pretty well already when I first saw her. At first she
  was kind to me, and brought me things, and I was fond of her. I told myself
  we had a friend like anybody else now. I used to brag about her in
  school.</p>

  <p>"Bye and bye I found out, I don't know how, that she was a sham, that her
  kindness meant nothing. Little by little I began to hate her, though I was
  careful not to let her see it, for I was afraid of her cold blue eye. Besides
  my father became more and more crazy about her. He seemed to lose his good
  sense as far as she was concerned. She could make him do anything she wanted.
  Children see more than they are supposed to.</p>

  <p>"It is three years now since the crash came. I was fourteen then. One day
  my father was arrested and taken to the Tombs. Mrs. Mansfield took me to her
  house, not the same one she has now. She treated me all right, but I hated
  her. Young as I was I held her responsible. I didn't see much of her. I don't
  know if you remember the trial?"</p>

  <p>"Something of it," said I.</p>

  <p>"The papers were full of it. I was not allowed to attend, but, of course,
  I got hold of all the papers. They said that my father had got hold of blank
  stock certificates by corrupting young clerks, and had then forged signatures
  to them and sold them on the stock market. He was sentenced to Sing Sing for
  seven years. They took me to see him before he was sent away. He had aged
  twenty years. He wasn't able to say much to me."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Mansfield told me I must change my name, and sent me to a good
  school in Connecticut. She paid the bills. I was pretty happy there, though
  this thing was always hanging over my head. In the summers I was sent away to
  a boy's camp in the mountains. Mrs. Mansfield told me nobody was allowed to
  see my father or to write to him and I believed her. So it was the same to me
  as if he had died.</p>

  <p>"One day last winter in school I received a letter signed 'Well-Wisher,'
  asking me to meet the writer at a certain spot in the school woods that
  afternoon. Naturally I was excited by the mystery and all that. I was scared,
  too. But I went. I didn't tell anybody."</p>

  <p>"I found a queer customer waiting for me. A man about fifty with
  close-cropped hair. He told me right off that he was just out of Sing Sing.
  Why hadn't I ever come to see my dad, he asked. He said it was pitiful the
  way he pined for me."</p>

  <p>"I stammered out that I didn't know anybody could see him. He told me
  about the visiting days. 'Anyhow you could have written,'" he said.</p>

  <p>"He never wrote to me," I said.</p>

  <p>"Sure, doesn't he write to you every writing day! He has read me the
  letters. Elegant letters."</p>

  <p>"I never got them!" I said.</p>

  <p>"That's why I came," he said. "Dave said he thought that woman had come
  between you."</p>

  <p>"The old fellow told me how to address a letter to my father, and he gave
  me money to go to Sing Sing when I could. I had an allowance from Mrs.
  Mansfield, but not enough for that. I wrote to my father that night."</p>

  <p>"It was Easter before I had the chance to see my father. I made out to
  Mrs. Mansfield that the school closed a day later than it did, and I used
  that day to go to Sing Sing. My father was in the infirmary. I scarcely
  recognised him. They let me stay all day. Even I could see that he was
  dying."</p>

  <p>"For the first time I heard the truth of the case. It was Mrs. Mansfield
  who had got the certificates out of the young clerks, and had brought them to
  my father to be filled in. When they were found out she carried on so, that
  he took the whole thing on himself. He thought he might as well, since he had
  to go to jail anyway, and he knew he would die there. Besides she promised
  him to have me educated and looked after. He had no one else to leave me
  with. At that time he still believed in her.</p>

  <p>"But in the prison he met men who knew about her of old. My father was not
  the first she had been the means of landing in jail. It was then my father
  began to be afraid for me, and managed to send me word.</p>

  <p>"He died in April. Mrs. Mansfield immediately took me out of school. She
  told me my father was dead, and that it was time I went to work. I think she
  must have learned by her spies that I had been to see my father, for she no
  longer took the trouble to put on a good face. Now it was, do this or that or
  it will be the worse for you. When I saw how all the other men gave in to
  her, I was afraid to resist. I hated her, but what could I do? I had no one
  to go to. I had no experience. I wasn't sure of myself. The understanding up
  there is that Lorina could reach you wherever you went. And if you did
  anything to cross her, look out! She has spies everywhere!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder why she didn't turn you adrift altogether?" I said.</p>

  <p>"I think I am useful to them because I look honest," the boy said
  wretchedly. "I run errands for them, but I never know what it's all
  about."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard talk up there of a boss greater than Mrs. Mansfield?"
  I asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "But only vague talk. I've never seen him."</p>

  <p>"Does she have you watched?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. She thinks she has me where she wants me. But if she suspected
  anything..."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't come here again," I said.</p>

  <p>His face fell absurdly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not kicking you out," I said smiling. "I shall keep in touch with
  you. Would you like to see this woman go to jail?"</p>

  <p>"Would I?" he cried, jumping up. Words failed him. "Oh! Oh, just try me,
  that's all!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to put her there," I said. "And you shall help me. But we
  must be careful."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the meantime Lorina Mansfield, weary of the inaction I
  had forced on her, or persuaded perhaps that I had dropped the pursuit,
  boldly resumed her designs on Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s diamond necklace. For
  convenience's sake I shall call this lady Mrs. Levering. He real name is one
  to conjure with in America.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dunsany or "English" reported that he had been detailed to go to
  Newport on Saturday to spy on the lady, and what should he do about it? The
  plucky gentleman who never hesitated to put himself in danger, became uneasy
  when it was a question of actually committing a crime.</p>

  <p>We arranged a chat over the telephone, and I gave him the best reasons for
  going ahead with the scheme. We had so much to talk over that I told him I
  would go up to New England by a different route, and if he was not spied upon
  he could come to me at Providence early on Sunday and we could go over
  everything. All the time we had been working together we had never exchanged
  a word face to face in our natural characters.</p>

  <p>We succeeded in pulling off the meeting. Mr. Dunsany assured me he had not
  been followed. We laid out our plan of campaign. I convinced him that the
  quickest and surest way to land the whole gang would be to allow them, even
  to assist them, to carry out a robbery from start to finish. "Let them steal
  Mrs. Levering's jewels," I said, "let them get clean away with them. We'll
  return them later."</p>

  <p>"Suppose some one gets hurt," he said nervously.</p>

  <p>"Not likely," I said. "They play too safe a game. We will be on our
  guard."</p>

  <p>He agreed with me, but said if we fell down on the case he would feel
  obliged to give her another necklace of equal value. This was a matter of
  $90,000.</p>

  <p>"We are not going to fall down on it," I said.</p>

  <p>What followed can best be told by Mr. Dunsany's reports.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 15</span></p>

  <p>Newport, Sunday, July 4th.</p>

  <p>My patience was rewarded shortly before noon to-day by the sight of Mrs.
  Levering walking to the Casino accompanied by a gallant gentleman unknown to
  me. She did not notice me, of course. If I had been in my own person, I
  warrant she would not have passed me so indifferently. What marvellous
  faculty is it that enables a lady to know without looking at a man whether he
  is worth looking at?</p>

  <p>I soon satisfied myself that she was wearing her veritable diamonds.
  Foolish woman! When I sold them to her I warned her not to exhibit them in
  public. At the time there was a lot of gossip about what Levering paid me for
  the necklace, and I suppose every thief in the country has it on his list.
  But Cora Levering was always feather-headed.</p>

  <p>I telegraphed to Lorina in the code we had agreed on, and had my dinner
  while I waited for her answer. It came presently, instructing me to meet her
  in a certain hotel in Providence tomorrow, two-thirty. Tomorrow being a
  holiday, I am not expected at Dunsany's. This means that I have to put in a
  long, empty twenty-four hours here. The place is full of my friends eating
  and drinking themselves black in the face, while I have to stay at a
  fourth-rate hotel.</p>

  <p>To-morrow night there is going to be a great entertainment at Fernhurst,
  one of the palaces on the cliffs.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 16</span></p>

  <p>Newport, July 5th, 9 P.M.</p>

  <p>All is set for the drama to-night, and I am nervously awaiting my cue.
  Heaven knows what the next few hours may bring forth! When you read this it
  may be up to you to get me out of jail. If we pull it off all right I have no
  doubt the newspapers will say, as they always do, that the robbery gave
  evidence of long and careful planning, whereas it was all fixed up in a few
  minutes.</p>

  <p>I went over to Providence today shortly before the hour set by Lorina, and
  found Foxy waiting at the hotel she named. Lorina herself, he said, was in
  Newport looking over the ground, and would be back directly. It seems that
  hearing of the affair at Fernhurst they had determined to turn the trick the
  same night.</p>

  <p>Lorina came bringing a good-looking, well-dressed young fellow whom she
  introduced to the crowd as Frank. He was evidently a youngster of the
  fashionable world, one cannot mistake the little ear-marks. He has a look of
  the family; one of the younger sons, maybe, whom drink and the devil have
  done for. At any rate, he is completely under Lorina's thumb like the
  rest.</p>

  <p>Lorina was playing the part of a traveller in books-religious books, if
  you please! She dressed the business woman plain and handsome, and had
  engaged a private sitting-room for the day to show her samples. There was
  actually a whole trunk full of sample books. I suppose she passed us off as
  her agents or customers.</p>

  <p>She had us all in the sitting-room together, besides Frank, Foxy and
  myself, there was a fourth man whom I recognised as her chauffeur. His name
  is Jim. She proceeded to lay out her campaign in the most matter-of-fact way
  without wasting a word. It might have been the sales-manager instructing the
  drummers in the Fall line. Nobody seemed nervous except Frank, who was
  apparently new at the game.</p>

  <p>The entertainment at Fernhurst provided our opportunity. It appeared that
  Frank was well acquainted with Mrs. Levering, and that by Lorina's
  instructions he had been particularly cultivating her society of late. He was
  to be the decoy. Furthermore, he drew for us, with rather a shaky hand, a
  plan of the house and grounds at Fernhurst, showing the location of roads,
  paths, benches, shrubbery, etc. Lorina used this plan in issuing her
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"Dancing is to begin at nine-thirty," she said, "but all the guests will
  not have arrived until nearly midnight. So we will fix on midnight to turn
  the trick, or as soon after as possible. We have decided on this bench that I
  have marked with a cross for the spot. Get its position well fixed in your
  mind, all of you. It is quite a way from the house you see, few, if any, of
  the dancers will go so far. It is off the main paths. It is near the street
  fence, but is hidden from the street by this dense shrubbery behind it.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Levering has promised Frank the first dance after she arrives. He
  will then make an engagement with her for another dance to fall just before
  midnight as near as he can figure it, and after dancing with her the second
  time will take her out to this bench. Foxy and English will already be in
  hiding in the shrubbery behind the bench. Foxy has an invitation to the
  affair, and he will go in evening dress and mix with the guests until he sees
  Frank dancing with Mrs. Levering the second time. He will then go out of the
  house and conceal himself in the shrubbery. English will already be waiting
  there. English must be there by eleven to make sure. English wears his
  ordinary clothes, and slips in by the service entrance to the grounds, marked
  on the plan here. Once inside the gates he must make his way under cover to
  the shrubbery behind the bench. English will carry an old overcoat for Foxy
  which will be provided. There will be a mask in one side pocket, a cap in the
  other. As soon as you two meet, Foxy will put on the things.</p>

  <p>"Now as to the actual trick. It is perfectly simple. Frank is keeping Mrs.
  Levering in conversation on the bench. Foxy sneaks up behind with the
  nippers, cuts the necklace, and tosses it back to English, who remains in the
  bushes.</p>

  <p>"The woman will scream, of course. Foxy will stand up and show himself,
  and run in this direction, that is, towards the house. Frank will take after
  him for a way, and then go back to the woman. Foxy will double around this
  shrubbery that conceals the stable entrance. As soon as he is out of sight of
  the woman he will throw off the cap, mask and coat, and go back to Mrs.
  Levering as one of the first attracted by her cries. If she does not cry out,
  he can mix with the crowd in the house until he has a chance to make a
  getaway. Meanwhile, English lies quiet in the shrubbery until the excitement
  has passed out of the vicinity. Then he slips out by the service gate, the
  same way he went in. Jim will be waiting with the car about five hundred feet
  beyond the service entrance, towards town. We have been over this ground.
  There is a big clump of rhododendrons inside the sidewalk at this point.</p>

  <p>"English, without stopping, will toss the necklace inside the car. But if
  he is pursued he had better drop it among the rhododendrons. Mind you,
  English, if there's anybody after you, don't make any throwing motion with
  your arm. If there is a chase Jim can join in it, and help English make his
  getaway. Later he can return and get the diamonds. English takes the trolley
  to Providence, and the owl train back to New York. Jim secretes the diamonds
  in the secret pocket in the car, and waits for Foxy. If Foxy is pursued,
  however, he must not lead them to the car. Jim waits until one-thirty. If
  Foxy has not arrived, he takes the car to the Atlantic garage. You, Jim, ask
  them to let you sleep in it, see? as you're expecting a call from your
  master. Foxy can get the car from the garage any time after that."</p>

  <p>Lorina went over all this twice. At the end she consulted her watch. "If
  any of you want to have anything explained, speak up. I've got to catch the
  four o'clock back to town."</p>

  <p>Frank was the only one who had any objection to raise to the arrangements.
  "Look here," said he, "this will queer me for good with that lot, even if
  they can't fasten anything on me."</p>

  <p>Lorina fixed him with her hard blue eye. "How?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I used to be known as a runner. They'll think it funny I wasn't able to
  catch Foxy."</p>

  <p>"Catch him then," said Lorina coolly. "Struggle with him. He will throw
  you off. That will let you out, won't it? Rehearse it now."</p>

  <p>It was a grim kind of play. Everybody took it quite seriously. A sofa was
  placed to represent the fateful bench. Lorina and Frank took seats on it.
  Lorina tied a piece of string around her neck to represent the necklace. Foxy
  and I crouched in the rear. Foxy crept forward, snipped the string and tossed
  it back to me. His implement was a pair of heavy nail clippers such as
  manicures use. Then as Foxy made off, Frank flung himself upon him, they
  struggled and Frank was thrown to the ground.</p>

  <p>All this was gone over again and again. Some buttons were tied on the
  piece of string, so that it would carry when it was thrown back to me. Foxy's
  stage experience proved serviceable. He acted as director, showing Frank how
  to tackle him, and how to fall without hurting himself. Lorina's depiction of
  the startled woman was admirable. The whole scene would have been funny if it
  hadn't been so grim. None of them seemed to be aware of any humour in the
  proceedings but me. Jim, who did not take part in the scene, acted as critic.
  He stood off making suggestions.</p>

  <p>Finally, Lorina announced that it was only ten minutes to train time, and
  hustled us out. She said Frank and Foxy might go off by themselves and
  practice if they felt it necessary. We scattered. I returned to the little
  hotel in Newport where I had taken a room. I have not seen any of them
  since.</p>

  <p>It is now nine-thirty and I am waiting in my hotel until it is time for me
  to go out to Fernhurst. I will post this to you on the way, so that in case
  anything happens you will at least be in full possession of our plans. I
  believe I was not cut out for a life of crime. It is too madly exciting. As
  the hour draws close my knees show an inclination to knock together, and my
  teeth to chatter.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch26"

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 17</span></p>

  <p>Providence, 11.30 A.M.</p>

  <p>When I got to the service gate of Fernhurst I found it guarded by two men,
  detectives unmistakably. This was disconcerting. I passed on. They bored me
  through with their gimlet eyes and I broke out in a gentle sweat all over.
  Presently, however, I realised it was but their professional manner of
  looking at anybody who was not well dressed, and I calmed down.</p>

  <p>It filled me with a kind of terror to think that I might be prevented from
  carrying out my part of the evening's entertainment, so you will see I was
  well worked up to it by this time. I went around the block and prepared to
  try again. On my way towards the service gate I had the luck to fall in with
  a crowd of waiters clearly bound for the show and it was no trouble at all to
  mix in with them. My makeup was of the same general style as theirs. We
  passed through the gate without question.</p>

  <p>Once inside I began to lag behind the bunch, and presently slipped away in
  the darkness. I reached my specified hiding-place in the shrubbery behind the
  bench without further adventure. The place had been so carefully mapped,
  there was no possibility of mistaking it.</p>

  <p>I had to wait over an hour for Foxy. It was not a pleasant time. Lorina's
  plan seemed perfect, but you never can tell. And my inexperience in this line
  was such that I didn't feel overmuch confidence in myself should an emergency
  arise. Not far behind me I could hear the steady procession of motors
  bringing guests to the party. In the distance I could hear the music. They
  had picked their spot well. In all that time no one passed that way.</p>

  <p>In the end Foxy's coming gave me a great start. Creeping through the
  bushes without the rustle of a leaf, he was beside me before I heard him
  coming. He was dressed in the height of fashion. I caught a gleam of a
  monocle dangling against his white waistcoat. I silently passed him over the
  coat I had brought, and standing in a little open space, he put it on
  together with the cap and mask. Then we crouched down side by side under the
  leaves, with the back of the bench in plain view before us. Foxy laid the
  nippers on the ground ready to his hand. We did not speak to each other.</p>

  <p>Bye and bye we heard voices approaching, and my poor heart set up a
  tremendous how-de-do. On the other hand something told me Foxy was enjoying
  it. Mrs. Levering and the young man called Frank came strolling dimly into
  view. I was nearly suffocating with excitement.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," Frank said.</p>

  <p>"How cosy!" she sang.</p>

  <p>"Shall we sit down?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Let's!" said she. "I'll have a cigarette."</p>

  <p>They sat. Frank presently struck a match. If she had looked over her
  shoulder she would have seen the glare faintly reflected from our white
  faces. I stole a look at Foxy's ratlike profile. He had shoved up the mask.
  His teeth were bared. He was amused at the prospect of a little scandalous
  eavesdropping. Merciful Heavens! what a face!</p>

  <p>I need not report the further conversation of the two on the bench. It was
  merely silly. Frank's voice was trembling. I suppose she ascribed that to the
  violence of his feelings for her. She is a fool. Foxy gave them a good while
  to their talk. Meanwhile I suffered agonies of suspense, and Frank no doubt
  worse. I at least could see when the blow was going to fall, but he could
  not. Not until Mrs. Levering said she must go back, but not really meaning it
  yet, did Foxy pull down the mask and creep forward. I held my breath.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if it were all accomplished in a single movement. Foxy rose
  to his knees behind the woman, snipped the shining thing around her neck and
  there it was lying at my knees. I mechanically dropped it in my pocket.</p>

  <p>She did not scream. In that, at least, she showed blood. "My necklace!"
  she gasped, jumping up, hand to throat. "Gone!"</p>

  <p>In Frank's little choking cry one heard the snapping of the frightful
  tension he had been under.</p>

  <p>Foxy, bent almost double, started up from behind the bench, and headed
  diagonally across the path. Another gasping cry, not loud, broke from the
  woman. "There he is!"</p>

  <p>Frank flung himself on the back of the runner, and they rolled over on the
  ground, all exactly as I had seen it rehearsed a dozen times in the hotel
  room. They sprang up, grappled, swayed and finally Frank was flung with
  apparently great violence to the ground. Foxy disappeared.</p>

  <p>Frank struggled to his feet, seemingly hurt. He attempted to stagger in
  the direction the fugitive had taken, but Mrs. Levering clung to him. One may
  suppose he was not sorry to be prevented.</p>

  <p>At this moment the tragic farce was interrupted by the entrance of an
  actor not on the bill. This was a man with an electric flash, a detective to
  all appearances. I suppose they had them posted about the grounds, and this
  man had heard the disturbance, slight though it was. The flash terrified me.
  I softly and precipitately retired under the leaves into the thickest of the
  shrubbery.</p>

  <p>"I have been robbed!" I heard Mrs. Levering gasp. "My diamond necklace! He
  came from there. He went that way."</p>

  <p>The detective threw his light around. Fortunately for me I had put a
  screen of leaves in front of me. I was not disposed to linger in the
  neighbourhood. I ran along close to the fence where there was a narrow open
  space. As I passed out of hearing, I heard others come running up. Excitement
  runs like electricity. I had no doubt that Foxy in immaculate evening dress,
  was among the first to reach the scene. I took care to survey the service
  gate from a discreet distance before presenting myself there. It was well
  that I did so. I saw that it was closed, and the two men still on guard. Not
  knowing at what instant an alarm might be raised behind me, I dared not apply
  to them with any tale however ingenious. Those diamonds were red hot in my
  pocket. On the other hand, I would have to retrace my steps nearly a quarter
  of a mile to reach the main entrance, and I was not suitably dressed to be
  seen there. I could not climb the fence at any point, for it was a smooth,
  high iron affair, moreover, the street outside was brightly lighted. I knew
  nothing about the cliff side of the grounds.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I felt decidedly panicky. Before my mind's eye
  headlines in the next day's papers were vividly emblazoned:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">WELL-KNOWN JEWELLER STEALS THE DIAMONDS HE SOLD</p>

  <p><br>
  or something like that. Finally I recollected that the road to the service
  entrance of Fernhurst ran quite close to the boundary of the next estate. I
  determined to try that way.</p>

  <p>To reach the boundary I was obliged to make a long detour. Still there
  were no sounds behind me to indicate that an alarm had been raised, at any
  rate a public alarm. The line between the two estates was marked by a thorn
  hedge and a wire fence. Choosing a dark spot I managed to struggle through
  without receiving any serious damage. I finally gained the street through the
  service gate of this place.</p>

  <p>This brought me out beyond the point where Jim was to be stationed with
  the motor car, and I had to retrace my steps. The car was in the appointed
  spot. Jim was on the front seat with his head craned in the other direction
  whence he expected me. I gave him a little signal. He was much troubled to
  see me come from that way thinking the plan had fallen through, but was
  reassured no doubt by the fall of the necklace on the floor of his car. I was
  thankful to be rid of the cursed thing.</p>

  <p>There were several cars standing across the street, with their chauffeurs
  chatting together, and I was afraid of attracting attention to myself or to
  Jim by turning back at that moment. I kept on. I was startled half out of my
  wits when a motor patrol wagon full of police came flying up the street past
  me. It turned in at the service gate of Fernhurst ahead. Since I was
  travelling in that direction I had to keep on.</p>

  <p>A man stepped out as I approached. Seizing my shoulder he swung me half
  around so that the light fell on my face. "What are you doing here?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>I thought it was all up with me. "I just wanted to have a look at the
  swells," I stammered.</p>

  <p>Another man joined him. "Hold this guy," said the first. While the second
  man kept a hand twisted in my collar, the first one frisked me expeditiously.
  I had taken care, of course, not to have anything on me. But the side pocket
  of my coat was still hot from the diamonds.</p>

  <p>Finding nothing the man growled an order for my release. The second man
  spun me around, and propelled me towards town with a shove. "Get the H! out
  of here!" said he.</p>

  <p>And I did.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 18</span></p>

  <p>New York, July 6th, Midnight.</p>

  <p>I have just returned from a celebration up at Lorina's house. Everybody
  made a clean getaway last night, and the diamonds are safe in Lorina's desk,
  so the gang made merry. The newspaper stories of the affair caused us the
  greatest amusement. The police, as you have seen, are very wide of the mark.
  Of us all, only Frank has fallen under suspicion. It appears that I was right
  in my guess as to his identity. The affair will ruin him socially, though it
  is not likely to lead to his arrest. I can't say that I feel sorry for the
  youth. Of all the parts in this sordid drama, Frank, the decoy played the
  most contemptible.</p>

  <p>In the general loosening of tongues tonight I have some rather interesting
  matter to report. When I arrived at the house all the gang except Lorina were
  in the dining-room. Spencer, the negro, told me she was up in the office, so
  I went upstairs to make my report. The office door was open a crack, and as I
  was about to knock I heard Lorina's voice within. She was talking over the
  telephone. The first sound of her voice froze me where I stood in
  astonishment. The tone was that of a woman distracted by love and longing.
  Think of it, Lorina!</p>

  <p>I heard her say: "I'll do anything you tell me. But I want to see you. I
  must see you sometimes, dearie. What is the use of all this working and
  worrying, what am I doing it for if you never even let me see you? I can't
  stand it. I can't go on. I won't stand it!"</p>

  <p>Do you wonder that I was amazed?</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and she went on in a broken, humbled tone: "No I
  didn't mean that. I will obey you. You always know best. But don't be so hard
  on me. Please, dearie, please!"</p>

  <p>At this point Foxy came running upstairs. I was caught rather
  awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I came upstairs to report to Mrs. Mansfield," I said, "but I don't like
  to disturb her. She seems to be having a private conversation."</p>

  <p>He listened at the door for a moment, then pulled me away.</p>

  <p>"Beat it!" said he. "She's talking to the boss. She'd kill us if she found
  us here."</p>

  <p>One other thing that I had heard Lorina say was: "Then I'll keep the coal
  here, until I hear from you again."</p>

  <p>"Coal" or "white coal" is their slang for diamonds, so I suppose she meant
  the necklace.</p>

  <p>I returned downstairs full of speculations regarding this wonderful and
  mysterious "boss." What kind of man must he be, thus to bring the imperious
  Lorina who commands us like slaves, to her knees?</p>

  <p>Frank was not present at the party in the dining-room. He is not a regular
  member of the gang. Besides Foxy, Jumbo, Jim the chauffeur and myself, there
  were several of the younger fellows, but not Blondy, I am glad to say, for I
  should not like to see that nice boy drinking. Lorina appeared only once or
  twice and then but for a moment. The lady's gaiety was forced. However, she
  was liberal in her hospitality. Champagne flowed like water.</p>

  <p>Jumbo got very drunk and even Foxy drank enough to make him indiscreet. It
  was then that interesting ancient history was retold. It would astonish you
  to see Foxy at such moments. There is nothing about him of the dull, prosy
  bore that he ordinarily affects.</p>

  <p>Jumbo was toasting him with maudlin praise. "Drink to Foxy, fellows!" he
  cried. "There's the lad that brings home the bacon! The slickest, smoothest
  article of them all!"</p>

  <p>Foxy took it as no more than his due.</p>

  <p>"Say, Foxy," asked another admirer, "what was the hardest trick you ever
  turned?"</p>

  <p>Naturally I have to let others ask these questions. Curiosity on my part
  would be prejudicial to my health. I am on the qui vive for the replies,
  though.</p>

  <p>"Oh, six months ago, when I lifted an actress' pearls," drawled Foxy.</p>

  <p>Fancy how I pricked up my ears.</p>

  <p>"Tell us about it," said the same youngster.</p>

  <p>All the young ones sit at Foxy's feet, you understand.</p>

  <p>Foxy was nothing loath. "Elegant pearls," he said reminiscently, "blue
  pearls, they called them, though I couldn't see the blue. But fine and
  choice! It was a long operation. I had to take a job acting in her company a
  couple of months beforehand. You see she kept the real pearls in a safety
  deposit box, and wore a phony string, which added to our difficulties. First
  I had to persuade her to wear the real pearls one night."</p>

  <p>"How did you do that?" somebody asked.</p>

  <p>"I egged on the leading man to make a bet with her that he could tell the
  real from the phony."</p>

  <p>"Was he in with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed. Innocent as a lamb. He didn't know that I put the idea in his
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Foxy is a wonder to manage!" put in Jumbo.</p>

  <p>"After the bet was made, we had the actress trailed every day until she
  went to the bank and got out her pearls. Then we knew she would wear them
  that night. She wore them in the first act. In the second she had on a
  nurse's costume, and had to leave them off. My next job was to get her maid
  out of the dressing-room during the second act. I managed this by having it
  gossiped around the company that the star was going to introduce some new
  business that night, and so the maid went out to look on, see? So I went in
  her dressing-room..."</p>

  <p>"How did you get in?" asked someone.</p>

  <p>"Walked in straight as if I had a good right to. There was no other way. I
  frisked the room, but could only find one string of pearls. You see, I
  counted on two, the phony and the real. I couldn't tell which was which. I
  had arranged to have a fellow who was in with us, a pearl expert, call on me
  between the acts. I saw him at the stage door, and showed him the string I
  had. He said they were phony. So I had to do it all over.</p>

  <p>"During the third act, however, luck was with me. The actress' maid, not
  having seen anything new in the second act, left the dressing-room of her own
  accord to watch the scene. I went in again. This time I found the real thing
  in a pocket of the petticoat she had worn in the second act. I left the phony
  string in its place."</p>

  <p>"And they never got on to you!" said his admirer.</p>

  <p>"Nah! That was where Enderby came in. He fixed the crime on the young
  leading man and broke up the show. Lord! I laughed. It let me out, too. I was
  sick of the fool business of acting every night. It wasn't till lately that
  Enderby got it in his head that he'd made a mistake. It's too late now. The
  pearls have been sold and the swag divided."</p>

  <p>Jumbo took a hand in the tale at this point. "Let me tell you the joke
  about selling the pearls," said he. "Me and Slim Foley set up an elegant
  office on Maiden Lane, with stenographers and office boys and all, everything
  swell. We were brokers in precious stones, see? We sent out decoy letters to
  the leading man Foxy mentioned, and I'm blest if we didn't sell him the
  string of pearls back again. Then he gave them to the actress, the fool, and
  she fired him and bust up the company."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," said the young fellow, "what did you want to
  sell them to him for? Risky business I should say."</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," said Jumbo with a shrug. "Orders from higher up."</p>

  <p>This suggests a new line of thought, doesn't it?</p>

  <p>During one of Lorina's brief visits to the dining-room, she was pleased to
  commend me for my work last night. She asked me to come to her downtown
  office tomorrow afternoon as soon as I finished work. I enclose the card she
  gave me with her address. Subtle irony, eh?</p>

  <p>To-morrow night I'll report on what happens there.</p>

  <p>J.M.</p>

  <p>The card enclosed by Mr. Dunsany read:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">THE EARNEST WORKERS PUBLISHING CO.,<br>
  No.&mdash; Fifth Avenue, New York.<br>
  Mrs. Lorina Mansfield, Manager.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 19</span></p>

  <p>New York, July 7th. The number on Fifth Avenue given me was not a great
  distance from Dunsany's and I was there by 5:15 this afternoon. It is one of
  the older office buildings and is filled with the most respectable tenants,
  mostly firms engaged in some form of religious business: publishers, mission
  boards, church supplies, etc. It is amusing to think of Lorina in such
  company.</p>

  <p>Lorina's office, of course, was no whit less respectable in appearance
  than a hundred others in the building. There was a respectable elderly
  stenographer, a subdued office boy, and Lorina herself playing her part of
  the saleswoman of religious literature in a starched shirt waist. She waved
  me to a seat beside her desk, and started right in to sell me a consignment
  of tracts. I confess I was a bit dazed by the scene.</p>

  <p>At five-thirty the respectable stenographer and the subdued office-boy
  asked her humbly if she desired them any further, and upon receiving a
  negative departed. When the door closed behind them Lorina yawned, stretched,
  and swore softly, to take the religious taste out of her mouth, I suppose. I
  laughed, but she didn't like it. I have discovered that laughter makes these
  people uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out!" she said frowning.</p>

  <p>I apologised.</p>

  <p>"English," she said, "Jumbo told me that you would be glad to get a little
  extra work as a diamond expert."</p>

  <p>I nodded, wondering what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"There's a friend of mine a jewel-broker next door," she went on, nodding
  towards the adjoining room. "His business is so full of risks from thieves,
  you know, that he decided the best way to fool them would be to take an
  humble little office in this building without so much as an extra lock on the
  door to give warning."</p>

  <p>Lorina only handed out this line of talk to save her face. I was not
  expected to believe it. These people are never frank with each other, even
  when there's nothing to be gained by bluffing. It is only when the men have
  been drinking that things are called by their right names.</p>

  <p>"My friend needs an assistant, a diamond expert," Lorina continued. "For a
  couple of months now, he's been at his wit's end to find a man he could
  trust. Jumbo said you were just the man for the job so I recommended you, and
  my friend told me to bring you around."</p>

  <p>I nodded sagely to all this palaver. "Am I to give up my job at
  Dunsany's?" I asked, hoping that the answer would be in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "That's a good thing, too. This new job will only take an
  hour or two in the evenings and on Saturday afternoons."</p>

  <p>She arose and tapped in a peculiar way on the door that led into the
  adjoining office. Some one got up within, and unlocked and opened it.
  Fortunately as a result of all that has happened during the past few weeks I
  have my nerves under strict control, for I got a shock. There stood Freer,
  the missing ex-head of my pearl department!</p>

  <p>We were introduced. Freer saw nothing suspicious in my aspect. There was a
  lot of palaver which I will not tire you with. The upshot of it was that I
  was engaged to assist my late assistant at a handsome salary. For the present
  I was to work from 5:15 to 6:30 every evening, as well as Saturday
  afternoons, and Sunday mornings if necessary.</p>

  <p>"I do not like to work late at night," said Freer nervously. "It attracts
  attention."</p>

  <p>Freer undertook then and there to explain my duties. "My work is with the
  pearls," he said, "and the diamond end of the business has been neglected
  since I lost my last assistant two months ago."</p>

  <p>"He died," remarked Lorina with a peculiar look at me.</p>

  <p>I got her meaning.</p>

  <p>Against one wall of Freer's office was a large letter file with drawers
  that pulled out, and a shutter to pull down over the whole at night, and
  lock. It was built entirely of steel, as the modern custom is. Freer pulled
  out one of the drawers but instead of letters inside, my amazed eyes beheld a
  heap of gleaming diamond jewelry. There were necklaces, dog-collars,
  lavallieres, pins, bracelets, rings. I wondered if the thirty-odd remaining
  drawers were filled with like treasures, and made a breathless mental
  computation of their value-millions! It was a modern burlesque of the scene
  in Aladdin's cave!</p>

  <p>Freer, referring to the drawer he held open said: "These are consignments
  of diamonds lately received, which I have not had the time to inventory. You
  see each article is tagged with a number. You are to take them in numerical
  order, enter a careful description and valuation in a journal, then demount
  the stones, weigh them, grade them and put them in stock."</p>

  <p>He opened several other drawers which contained princely treasures of
  unset diamonds lying on white cotton. They were carefully graded according to
  size, colour, quality. Here apparently is the loot of years past. I could not
  begin to give any estimate of its value. I have not seen the pearls yet.</p>

  <p>"The other part of your work," Freer went on, "will be to fill the orders
  for diamonds that are received." He showed me several order slips, evidently
  from the phraseology, made out by experienced jewellers, but bearing no
  shipping directions.</p>

  <p>"Am I to send these orders out?" I asked with a simple air.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Enter the orders in the order book, fill them from
  stock, and turn them over to me."</p>

  <p>"Mind you do not carry your work to the window," put in Lorina
  sharply.</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mind you do not leave anything about at night," added Freer, "no tools,
  no papers. The women come in here to clean after we are gone."</p>

  <p>He showed me where the tools of my trade were kept. In addition to
  everything else needful, in a locked cabinet there is a beautiful little
  electric crucible for melting down gold and platinum.</p>

  <p>I immediately set to work under the eyes of Lorina and Freer. You can
  imagine in what excitement I now write this. Our work is done! or almost
  done, for we have not yet got a line on that mysterious and terrible "boss."
  For a moment I thought it might be Freer, but he is as subservient to Lorina
  as the rest. Man! Man! What a haul we shall make if there is no slip! We must
  do our best of course to ensure complete success, but I beg of you not to
  risk too far what we have in our grasp, in the hope of getting more. I
  confess I am a little scared by the magnitude of the developments today. Do
  not wait too long before delivering your master stroke!</p>

  <p>J.M.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO resume my own part in these matters, you can conceive
  what a great responsibility devolved upon me in the light of these two last
  reports. I did not have to have Mr. Dunsany remind me of it. I was like a
  player in a close game who holds the best card. The question was when to play
  it. One may easily hold one's trumps too long. Still I could not bear to show
  my hand without the assurance of taking the king, i.e., the "boss."</p>

  <p>So I still held off, though the tension was frightful, particularly on
  poor Dunsany. In every subsequent report he begged me to strike, and take our
  chance of getting our man through the disclosures sure to be made in the
  general crash. There was more up on this game than cards were ever played
  for.</p>

  <p>In the meantime I was straining every nerve to pick up a clue to the
  "boss." I knew that we must get him in the end if we could hold off long
  enough. I arranged a meeting with the boy Blondy, and cross-examined him for
  hours. The poor youngster was only too anxious to tell me what he knew, but
  he could not help me.</p>

  <p>He said that Lorina never sent any of the men to the boss. All
  communications between them were made without the aid of a third party. Some
  of the men, he said, affected to believe that the boss was a myth invented by
  Lorina to keep them in awe. I had, however, good reason in my reports to know
  that the boss was a real man.</p>

  <p>I put the most skilful woman operative I could procure on Lorina's trail.
  It appeared, however, from her first report that Lorina was instantly aware
  of being watched, and fooled the operative at her pleasure. Thus she became a
  danger to me instead of a help, since Lorina with her infernal cleverness
  might very easily have found a way to intercept our communications. So I
  discharged the operative two days after I hired her.</p>

  <p>In justice to Mr. Dunsany, who hourly ran such a terrible risk, I now took
  the police into my confidence. The chief of the detective bureau at this time
  was Lanman, a man I had always respected for his contempt of spectacular
  methods and his strong sense. I went to see him.</p>

  <p>He did not know me, of course. He listened to my story with an incredulous
  grin. He has an aspect as grim and forbidding as a granite cliff. But as I
  piled up my evidence, and read from Mr. Dunsany's report, I shook the cliff.
  I had the satisfaction of seeing the granite betray excitement.</p>

  <p>When I was done he was convinced. He was frankly envious of my luck in
  obtaining such a case, and of my success with it, but he showed a disposition
  to play absolutely fair. I had been afraid that he might try to rob me of the
  fruits of my success with the public.</p>

  <p>Lanman agreed that it was best to hold off for a day or two longer in the
  hope of getting the "boss." In the meantime he secured a room at Fifth avenue
  on the same floor where Lorina had her offices, and there every day during
  the hours while Mr. Dunsany was at work, waited six men within call. We next
  secured quarters in the little hotel three doors from Lorina's house, and
  every night ten of Lanman's men were domiciled there. Signals were agreed on
  in case of need.</p>

  <p>Matters stood thus at the end of the week whose beginning had witnessed
  the Newport robbery. On Friday morning Irma Hamerton came to town again. I
  witnessed her arrival in the lobby of the Rotterdam, which you will remember
  was her hotel before it had been mine. Every one sat up and stared. She was
  as lovely as only herself, but I thought, looked harassed. Mount was
  attending her like a shadow, smoother, more elegant and more complacent than
  ever.</p>

  <p>With a fanciful, sentimental feeling I had engaged rooms on the same floor
  of the hotel as Irma's. Her suite was rented by the year. During the morning
  as I went to and fro in the corridor of the eleventh floor, I could not help
  but notice an unusual stir in the neighbourhood of Irma's rooms. Messengers
  were flying, packages arriving, and the switchboard busy.</p>

  <p>There is a telephone switchboard on each floor of the Rotterdam, opposite
  the elevators. In addition to answering the calls, the operator is supposed
  to keep an eye on things generally. While I was waiting for the elevator I
  asked the girl on our floor what was the cause of the excitement. She said
  she didn't know, but said it with a simper and a toss of the head that added
  to my uneasiness. Downstairs I asked the clerk with whom I was on friendly
  terms, but with no better success.</p>

  <p>While I was hanging around the lobby, Irma and Mount came down. They took
  a taxi at the door. Following a sudden impulse I engaged the next in line,
  and ordered the driver to follow them. They led me through the maze of
  downtown traffic direct to the Municipal Building. They disappeared in the
  bureau of Marriage Licenses, and my worst fears were confirmed.</p>

  <p>This time I determined to act without consulting my passionate, headstrong
  friend. I hastened back to the hotel. I had evidence that the ceremony was to
  be performed there, most likely the same afternoon. I wrote Irma a note
  begging her to see me privately on a matter of the greatest importance. I
  signed it with my assumed name Boardman, but I had worded it in such a way
  that she would know it was from me. Moreover she knew my handwriting. I sent
  it to her room in advance of her return. There was a chance of course that
  some one else might open it, but I knew she made a general practice of
  opening her own letters.</p>

  <p>A little before two o'clock, I got a summons and hastened to her suite.
  She started back dubiously at the sight of me, but I soon identified myself.
  She was alone. The room was filled with orange blossoms. The scent sickened
  me.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Mount?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I sent him away for an hour," she answered, blushing.</p>

  <p>"Are we quite alone?"</p>

  <p>"Bella and Marie are in my bedroom. That is two rooms away."</p>

  <p>Bella was Mrs. Bleecker; Marie her maid.</p>

  <p>"Laying out your wedding-dress, I suppose," said I.</p>

  <p>She started and blushed deeply. "You know?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Is it a secret?"</p>

  <p>"Not from you. I didn't know where to reach you by phone."</p>

  <p>There was a somewhat painful silence. I did not feel inclined to make
  things easy for her.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you aren't you going to congratulate me?" she murmured at
  last.</p>

  <p>"No," I said bluntly.</p>

  <p>She looked at me full of surprise and pain, like a hurt child, but I was
  hurt, too, and impenitent.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Irma, how could you?" I cried at last. It was the first time I had
  ever addressed her so. At the moment neither of us noticed it.</p>

  <p>My question confused her. "I I don't know," was her strange answer.</p>

  <p>Presently she recovered herself somewhat. "Why shouldn't I?" she demanded,
  showing fight.</p>

  <p>I shrugged. "I don't know. I have no reasons. You should be guided by your
  instinct."</p>

  <p>"He is good to me," she said defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, he sees his interest."</p>

  <p>I can't remember all that was said on both sides. The conversation was
  sufficiently painful. She was no match for me. Finally she began to
  tremble.</p>

  <p>"Why did you leave me?" she faltered. "I asked you to help me. You have
  avoided me all these weeks. I needed you. It's cruel and useless for you to
  come now, when it is too late and and"</p>

  <p>"I have been working for you!" I cried. "I thought I could trust your
  instinct."</p>

  <p>"I had no intention of marrying at first," she said. "You saw a while ago
  what was coming. Why didn't you speak then if you had anything to say. It's
  too late now."</p>

  <p>"It's never too late if you have a doubt," I cried.</p>

  <p>"But he Alfred will be here at four," she stammered, "and the clergyman
  and my friends-"</p>

  <p>"Let Alfred go away again," I said coolly.</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened like a frightened child's. "I dare not!" she whispered.
  "You don't know! He is a terrible man!"</p>

  <p>"I'll back you up," I said.</p>

  <p>"No! No!" she cried. "I will not! I cannot! Please go!"</p>

  <p>I took a new tack.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask me the result of my work the last few weeks?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>I had brought for the purpose, that report of Mr. Dunsany's in which Foxy
  had told how the theft of Irma's pearls had been accomplished. I explained to
  Irma how this report had been secured, and then I read it to her. Joy and
  horror struggled together in her face.</p>

  <p>"You knew this long ago!" she cried accusingly. "Why didn't you tell me
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Roland forbade it. I am breaking my word to him in telling you now."</p>

  <p>"He no longer cares then what I think!"</p>

  <p>I shrugged.</p>

  <p>She walked up and down the room like one distraught.</p>

  <p>"Knowing that Roland is innocent would you dare to marry Mount?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It is too late!" she cried.</p>

  <p>At this moment we were warned by a sound in the next room to pull
  ourselves together. The door opened and Mrs. Bleecker's fawning countenance
  appeared in the opening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," she said, cringing. "I didn't know you were still
  engaged." She did not withdraw, however, but favoured me with a good, long
  stare.</p>

  <p>I never saw the gentle Irma so angry. "Leave the room!" she commanded. "I
  told you I was not to be disturbed!"</p>

  <p>If she had always taken the same tone with that woman it would have been
  better for her. Mrs. Bleecker precipitately retired. Irma continued to pace
  the floor. "What shall I do?" she murmured, twisting her hands together. "I
  have not the strength to face him out."</p>

  <p>"Don't try," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Beat it," I said in homely slang.</p>

  <p>A gleam of light, of mischief appeared in her tortured face. "But how?
  where? Will you go with me?" she cried breathlessly. "What will I do about
  the women here? What explanation shall I make?"</p>

  <p>"One thing at a time!" I protested. "Make no explanation. You are your own
  mistress. If you like you can leave Alfred a note saying you have changed
  your mind. As to the women..."</p>

  <p>"I can trust Marie."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Send Mrs. Bleecker out on an errand. No trouble to invent an
  errand at this juncture. You can be gone when she returns."</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Matters are rapidly approaching a crisis," I said. "I
  must stay on the job."</p>

  <p>"But where will I go?"</p>

  <p>"That's up to you. I can only offer a suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Yes! Yes! Don't tease me."</p>

  <p>"You have a difficult time ahead of you. I think you need a man's
  support."</p>

  <p>A crimson tide swept up from her neck.</p>

  <p>"I would put on my oldest and plainest suit," I went on wickedly, "and go
  register at some quiet little hotel, the last place they would think of
  looking for you. I will give you the name of such a place. At five-thirty
  this afternoon I would go to a certain horrible cheap little restaurant known
  as the American Cafe, which is on Third avenue near Sixteenth street.
  Half-past five, remember, and just see what happens."</p>

  <p>"If you would only come with me-I mean as far as the door," she murmured
  in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Too risky," I said. "Mind I do not guarantee anything in any event. It's
  up to you. A certain young friend of ours has the pride of Lucifer, and you
  have made a ghastly wound in it. You will have to humble yourself
  shockingly."</p>

  <p>In her present mood I saw she was quite ready to do that.</p>

  <p>"This is what I'm counting on," I went on. "Pride is pretty poor fare. Let
  him act as high and mighty as he likes, he's really starving for all that
  makes life worth living. The unexpected sight of you ought to be like a feast
  to his eyes. I'm hoping he'll fall to, before his damnable pride has a chance
  to bring up reserves. One thing more. If anything prevents him from supping
  there as usual, he lives at &mdash; East Seventeenth street."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure he loves me still?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Not at all sure," I said coolly. "You'll have to go and find out. If
  you've lost him, you've lost a lover that was worth a woman's while."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER I had seen Irma safely out of the Rotterdam (I thought
  she looked more adorable in her plain black dress and modest hat than in all
  her finery), I went back to my own rooms in the hotel. I was expecting a
  telephone report from a man whom I had sent to pick up what he could at the
  garage where Lorina stored her car. Meanwhile I gave myself up to the joy of
  picturing Mrs. Bleecker's dismay when she returned from her hypothetical
  errand, and Mount's black rage when he dropped in at four to be married and
  found himself minus a bride. I had always suspected that Mount concealed
  tigerish tendencies under his too-smooth exterior.</p>

  <p>By and by my telephone did ring, but it was not the man I expected. An
  agitated young voice hailed me over the wire, which I had some difficulty in
  recognising as Blondy's. He was so excited I could not make head or tail of
  his message. When I got him straightened out it ran something like this:</p>

  <p>"I have just been at Mrs. Mansfield's office, I mean the downtown office.
  She told me last night to come to-day as she had a package to be taken to a
  man at the Hotel Madagascar. I was sitting beside her desk and she was
  writing a letter to go with the package, when the telephone bell rang. She
  knows how to talk over the telephone without giving anything away. All she
  said was 'yes' and 'no' and 'repeat that,' but I saw that it was important
  because her face changed and her eyes glittered. When she looks like that it
  means danger.</p>

  <p>"She was talking to a woman called Bella.</p>

  <p>"She made some notes on a pad. As soon as she rang off she jumped up. She
  said she was called out and told me I needn't wait because she wouldn't send
  the package until tomorrow. When she turned to get her hat I managed to catch
  a glimpse of the notes she had put down. She had written:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Elegantly-dressed man of fifty.<br>
  Silvery toupee, waxed moustache, pale face.<br>
  Brown suit, waistcoat edged with white.<br>
  White spats, white gloves.<br>
  Expensive Panama hat, fancy band green and red.<br>
  Room 1104."</p>

  <p><br>
  "This is your description, and this is the number of your room. I was scared
  when I saw the expression of her face. She sent me home. She left at the same
  time, and took a taxi at the door. She carries her gun in a kind of pocket in
  her skirt. Look out for her!"</p>

  <p>"I get you, old boy!" I cried. "You've done me a good turn and I shan't
  forget it. Don't you worry."</p>

  <p>I hung up the receiver, and did a little thinking. I was struck by the
  name of the woman who had called Lorina up, Bella. It is not a very common
  name. It was Mrs. Bleecker's name. Was this a new thread in my extraordinary
  tangle?</p>

  <p>It was decidedly awkward to have my disguise laid bare just at this
  moment. However, forewarned is forearmed. I set about putting my affairs in
  order. I did not know whether Lorina would visit the Rotterdam or not, but I
  was sure she would not do so without making her usual careful arrangements,
  and not probably, without disguising herself, all of which would take time. I
  gave myself an hour, anyway.</p>

  <p>I gathered my papers together, and despatched those of them I valued to
  Dr. &mdash;&mdash;-, who had been so good to me already. I wrote notes to Mr.
  Dunsany, Blondy and other agents instructing them to send their reports in
  the care of Oscar Nilson until they heard from me again. All the beautiful
  sartorial effects I had to leave behind me. Maybe I could redeem them later
  if they were not sold by the hotel to pay my bill.</p>

  <p>It was close upon four and I supposed the wedding-guests were gathering,
  when my telephone summoned me again.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sadie Farrell is calling," said the voice at the other end.</p>

  <p>My heart jumped, but simultaneously Caution held up a warning finger. "One
  moment," I answered.</p>

  <p>I did some rapid thinking. I did not keep the girl waiting an appreciable
  moment, but in that time I thought a whole chapter, as one may do in a
  crisis. Not Sadie! Better sense instantly told me she would never come to my
  hotel. She had a more exalted notion of what was due her. Lorina, of course.
  She had used the most obvious expedient of reaching my rooms. I had three
  alternatives:</p>

  <p>(a) To deny myself to her. But in that case I would virtually be besieged
  in the hotel.</p>

  <p>(b) To see her downstairs. She would hardly take a shot at me in the
  crowded lobby but she might very well have some half- crazed youth there to
  do it for her.</p>

  <p>(c) To have her upstairs, where she could not pass any signals outside. I
  had two rooms.</p>

  <p>"Please have Miss Farrell come upstairs," I said over the phone.</p>

  <p>I had one of the best suites at the Rotterdam, a corner room which was my
  parlour, and a bedroom. I put the key to the parlour door in my pocket,
  retired into the bedroom, and locked the communicating door. Presently I
  heard the bell-boy's knock on the parlour door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" I sang out.</p>

  <p>Through the door I heard the sounds of two people entering my parlour.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Sadie!" I cried. "Make yourself at home. I'll be dressed in a
  jiffy!"</p>

  <p>An indistinguishable murmur answered me. This was certainly not my
  Sadie.</p>

  <p>The bell-boy went out, and I heard him retiring down the hall. I gave him
  time to get out of the way, then I slipped out of the bedroom into the hall,
  key to the other room in hand. I inserted it ever so softly in the parlour
  door, and turned it. But she heard! She rushed to the door and shook it. By
  that time I was around the corner of the corridor.</p>

  <p>The telephone girl looked at me somewhat curiously as I pressed the
  elevator button, but did not quite like to question me. She knew, of course,
  that a caller had just been shown into my room.</p>

  <p>"I'll be back in a minute," I said carelessly.</p>

  <p>Just then I saw the number of my room-1104-displayed on the switchboard.
  Lorina had rushed to the phone.</p>

  <p>"Is there a drugstore in the hotel?" I asked the girl at random, to
  distract her attention.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. There is one opposite the Thirty-fourth street entrance."</p>

  <p>The elevator was approaching my floor. I needed one more second to make my
  getaway. "Is it a reliable place?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Conway's," she said, holding the plug ready in her hand, "one of the
  largest in town."</p>

  <p>The elevator door was now open, and I stepped aboard. The operator shoved
  the plug in, and answered the call. I was carried down.</p>

  <p>I could not tell, of course, what form Lorina's appeal for help would
  take. In case she might telephone to have me intercepted in the lobby, I took
  the precaution to get off at the mezzanine floor. I passed around the gallery
  to the other side of the building, and gained the street without
  interference. So there I was safe, but once more homeless.</p>

  <p>A gaily-dressed couple left the hotel immediately in front of me. The
  woman was talking rather excitedly. Reaching the pavement I saw that the
  talker was Miss Beulah Maddox, late of Irma's company. Of course! No
  difficulty in guessing what she was excited about. They turned West on
  Thirty-fourth street. I was bound in the same direction. I heard her say: "Of
  course nobody believes she's sick. What can be the matter?"</p>

  <p>"They've had a row I suppose," replied her companion.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen steps farther along, they met another couple likewise
  gloriously arrayed. I did not know these two, but it required little
  perspicacity to guess that they too belonged to the profession. Miss Maddox
  greeted them with a squeal of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dears!" It was risky, but I could not forbear stopping a moment to
  listen. I made out to be looking for a taxi. "What do you think?" cried Miss
  Maddox. "There's no use your going any farther! There isn't going to be any
  wedding!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows. Another extraordinary caprice of Irma's! Everybody is told
  at the desk that she is ill, and the ceremony postponed, but of course that's
  only an excuse. I had a glimpse of Mr. Mount and he looked simply furious, my
  dear!"</p>

  <p>And so on! And so on! A taxi drew up and I jumped in.</p>

  <p>I had myself taken to Oscar's shop, and in one of the little cubicles, the
  distinguishing marks of the elegant Mr. Boardman, late of the Rotterdam, were
  removed. It would have been fun to adopt another swell makeup and go back to
  the Rotterdam to see what was happening, but it was too risky. It was safer
  for me to play an humble character now.</p>

  <p>Oscar provided me with a longish mop of black hair, and a pair of heavy
  black eyebrows. He went out himself to get me the rough clothes I needed. An
  hour after I had gone into his shop I came out again, a typical
  representative of tough young New York. The Hudson Dusters would not have
  rejected me.</p>

  <p>It was now nearly half-past five. The hands of the clock reminded me of
  the meeting that I had arranged to bring about at that hour. My heart was
  very keen for the success of this meeting, yet I was full of uncomfortable
  doubts. Now that I had changed my character I felt that I might safely go and
  see how things turned out, so I turned my steps in the direction of the
  American Cafe on Third avenue.</p>

  <p>When I got there Roland was already eating his supper. No sign of Irma
  yet. The American is one of those older lunch rooms where they have long
  mahogany tables each decorated with a row of sugar bowls and sauce bottles
  with squirt tops. In such places one of the squirt tops still gives "pepper
  sauce" though I never saw anybody use it. There was a double row of long
  tables with a lane between. Roland had the wall seat of the first table on
  the right. His shorthand book was propped against a vinegar bottle, and he
  studied it while he fed himself.</p>

  <p>I took a seat two removes from him on the same side of the table. He paid
  no attention to me. I took this distance, because if Irma came I didn't want
  to hear too much. No one was likely to sit between us, so long as there were
  whole tables vacant. It was a little early for the supper hour, and there
  were few in the place.</p>

  <p>I ordered the piece de resistance of such places, viz.: a plate of beef
  stew. Roland was almost through his supper, and I wondered apprehensively if
  Irma meant to exercise her woman's prerogative of being late. Perhaps her
  nerve had failed her, and she would not come. She had burned her bridges
  though. What else could she do but come? From time to time I glanced in my
  young friend's face. It was pale and drawn. Verily, I thought, his infernal
  pride was sapping his youth.</p>

  <p>Then I saw Irma and my heart set up a great beating. It's a risky thing to
  presume to play Providence to a pair of young souls, one of whom is as
  explosive as gun-cotton. What was going to happen? Irma was hovering about
  outside. She glanced in the place nervously. Unfortunately there was no other
  woman eating there at the moment, though women did come to the place. Irma
  walked on. Had she given up? My heart sunk. No, presently she came strolling
  back. She meant to wait for him outside. I approved her good sense. Plainly
  dressed though she was, her entrance into that place would have created a
  sensation.</p>

  <p>Roland, all unconscious of what was in store, got up, slipped the book in
  his pocket, paid his score with an abstracted air, and went out. He never
  looked at me. His brain was full of shorthand symbols.</p>

  <p>I followed him at once, though I had but started my supper. Nobody cared
  so long as I paid.</p>

  <p>I was just in time to see them come face to face on the pavement
  outside.</p>

  <p>"Roland!" she whispered with the loveliest smile surely that ever bedecked
  the human countenance; wistful, supplicating and tender.</p>

  <p>He started back as if he had been shot, and gazed at her with a kind of
  horror. He did not speak. I expect he could not. Passersby stared at them
  curiously. Irma lowered her head, and slipping her hand inside his arm with
  affecting confidence, drew him forward away from the stares. Still he did not
  speak. He was oblivious to the passersby, and to everything else but her. He
  gazed at her like a man in a trance, his dark eyes full of a passionate
  hunger. She only spoke once more. Raising her eyes to his she moved her lips.
  I could read them.</p>

  <p>"I love you," she whispered.</p>

  <p>His lips began to tremble. Where were all his proud vows then? She drew
  him around the corner into the quieter side street. She was weeping now. When
  she looked at him I could see the bright drops. They were more potent than
  any words she could have spoken. Roland suddenly came to life. He stopped
  short, flung an arm around her, turned up her face and kissed her mouth,
  careless if all New York saw.</p>

  <p>So that was all right.</p>

  <p>The sight induced me to take the first train out to Amityville where I
  might dine and spend the evening with my dear girl. We were much mystified
  upon receiving a telegram during the evening signed by my name. To my
  astonishment I saw English and Freer on the train returning from Amityville.
  The explanation of all this was forthcoming in the morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning as soon as Oscar opened his shop, I was on hand
  to get my mail. I found that big things had happened during the
  night.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Report of J.M. No. 23</span></p>

  <p>Lorina's House</p>

  <p>Saturday, July 9th, 3 A.M.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate that this should be the first night of our association
  that we are out of touch with each other. I sent home an hour ago to see if
  there was any word from you. I got your letter, but that only gives me the
  address of the wig-maker's shop which is, of course, closed until morning. I
  have to remain on watch here, and I cannot make the hours pass better than by
  writing you an account of all that has happened. It will save time when we
  meet.</p>

  <p>I have done the best I could. I followed your instructions to the letter.
  I do not see how I could have acted differently. I hope you will not blame
  me.</p>

  <p>As soon as I was through work at Dunsany's this afternoon, I went down to
  No. &mdash; Fifth avenue as usual, to continue my inventory of the gang's
  diamonds. Freer is always there when I am, of course. He's not a bad sort of
  fellow. There's something sorrowful about him. I think he would prefer on the
  whole to lead an honest life. He speaks of having an expensive family to
  keep.</p>

  <p>As soon as Lorina's stenographer and office boy went home, she came into
  our room as she usually does. This evening she was in a state of excitement.
  She had evidently been holding herself in some time. The air was lurid with
  the fire and brimstone she used in apostrophising you. If hate could be sent
  by wireless you'd be dead this minute, my friend.</p>

  <p>I gathered she had learned during the day that you were at the Rotterdam.
  But when she went around there with her silencer, you turned the tables on
  her somehow and not only got away again, but left her in a very humiliating
  position. Bully for you!</p>

  <p>"He's slipped through my fingers for the moment!" she went on, "but I've
  got a line on his girl again. I'll fix her to- night."</p>

  <p>My heart went down at this piece of news.</p>

  <p>"She's at a sanatorium at Amityville," Lorina went on. "I got a servant
  into the house, and I know her habits. I won't take any chances this time.
  This is a job for you, English."</p>

  <p>Fancy my feelings! I had no time to think. Yet I had to say something, and
  quickly, too. I said the natural thing.</p>

  <p>"I won't do it!" I cried. "I am working for you night and day as it is,
  good work, too! I didn't engage for murder a woman too. I won't do it! I'm
  done with you all!"</p>

  <p>And I flung down my tools.</p>

  <p>Lorina took this outburst calmly. She is accustomed to it no doubt. She
  merely looked at Freer, and he got between me and the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't be simple-minded, English," she said contemptuously. "This is no
  child's game, that you can refuse to play if you don't like the rules. You're
  in it for bad or for worse, like the rest of us. And I have the means of
  enforcing my orders!"</p>

  <p>"Not that!" I begged.</p>

  <p>"It was agreed long ago that this woman and this man have got to be put
  out of the way. You're the only one of the crowd that hasn't been tested out,
  and the other boys are complaining. Here's your chance to make good. You
  understand there's no alternative. You're a valuable man to us, but...!"</p>

  <p>I can give you no idea of the effect with which she said this. She is a
  terrible woman. Her eyes were like points of ice. Meanwhile I was thinking
  hard. If I did not go, she would undoubtedly find some one else. I might be
  prevented from warning you. I could not warn Sadie direct, because you had
  never given me her address. In the end I agreed.</p>

  <p>Lorina smiled on me.</p>

  <p>"What are my instructions?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The girl is at Dr. &mdash;&mdash;'s sanatorium," said Lorina. "You should
  not get out there before dark, so the seven-thirty train will be the best.
  There is a train back from Amityville a little after ten which will land you
  in town before midnight."</p>

  <p>She then told me how to reach the sanatorium, and described the layout of
  the grounds.</p>

  <p>"My report says that the Farrell girl keeps close to the house during the
  day," she went on, "and walks out at night. Her favourite spot is a pool at
  the bottom of the lawn, which is surrounded by juniper trees. There is a
  bench at the southerly side of the pool that she always visits. It is near
  the public road, and will be no trouble for you to reach. The thick growth of
  young trees makes plenty of cover."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do when she comes?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Lorina turned her back on me a moment. When she faced around she handed me
  an automatic pistol with a curious cylinder affixed to the end of the
  barrel.</p>

  <p>"Use this," she said. "It makes no sound."</p>

  <p>I slipped it in my pocket.</p>

  <p>"Freer will go with you," said Lorina.</p>

  <p>This seemed fatal to my hopes I had to keep command of my face though. I
  made believe it was a matter of indifference. To give Freer credit, he did
  not appear to relish the assignment, but he dared not object either.</p>

  <p>"As soon as you get back you will both come direct to my house," said
  Lorina.</p>

  <p>Such were our instructions.</p>

  <p>We went to take the seven-thirty train as ordered. As Freer never left my
  side I had no opportunity to call you up. I know now that you weren't at the
  hotel anyway. In the station Freer went to buy the tickets. I waited on a
  bench in plain sight of him. Next to me sat a nice, sensible looking girl,
  and I had an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Will you send a telegram for me?" I asked smiling at her.</p>

  <p>Naturally she was somewhat taken aback. "What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't look so surprised," I said, smiling still. "There's a man watching
  me. He mustn't know. It's terribly important a question of a life,
  maybe."</p>

  <p>I was lucky in my girl. She had an adventurous spirit. She smiled back.
  "Who to?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Have you got a good memory?"</p>

  <p>"First-rate."</p>

  <p>"Miss Farrell, care Doctor's Sanatorium, Amityville."</p>

  <p>"I have it."</p>

  <p>"Just say: 'Do not leave the house to-night.'"</p>

  <p>"Right. Signature?"</p>

  <p>"B. Enderby. You'll find the money to pay for it on the seat when I get
  up."</p>

  <p>Freer, having secured the tickets, now came towards us. I met him half
  way. He looked at me hard.</p>

  <p>"I made a friend," I said, grinning as men do.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said sourly. "I shouldn't think you'd be in the humour
  now."</p>

  <p>I went out to the train with him, giving an amorous backward glance
  towards the girl. An hour and a half later we were crouching among the young
  juniper trees at the edge of Dr. &mdash;&mdash;-'s pond. I was reminded of
  that other night in Newport. Certainly I have led a full life this past week.
  Once more I waited with my heart in my throat fancying that I heard her
  approach in all the little sounds of night. Freer was no happier than I, I
  believe. While we waited in the dark I quietly unloaded the magazine of the
  pistol to guard against accidents.</p>

  <p>Once we did hear steps approaching along one of the paths, and held our
  breaths. But they passed in another direction. If she had come, my plan was
  to secure Freer with her assistance, if she were not too frightened. But she
  did not come.</p>

  <p>Freer had a tiny electric flash with which he consulted his watch from
  time to time. He said at last: "We can just make the train. It's the only
  train to-night."</p>

  <p>"Come on," I said. "It isn't our fault if she didn't come."</p>

  <p>"Thank God she didn't!" he said involuntarily.</p>

  <p>I shook hands with him. He was a traitor to me, and a thief, but I forgot
  it at the moment.</p>

  <p>The trip home was without incident. We got up to Lorina's shortly after
  midnight. The whole gang was there: Foxy, Jumbo, Jim, Blondy, several of the
  young fellows, a dozen in all besides Freer and me. They were all gambling in
  the dining-room. Lorina jumped up at the sight of us.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"No good," I said. "The girl never came."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said Lorina. That was all.</p>

  <p>It struck me that she must have known already that we had failed.</p>

  <p>Lorina asked for her pistol, and I handed it over.</p>

  <p>"Boys," said Lorina, "we'll go up to the office and have a council. I was
  just waiting for these two to come in. We've got to decide what we're going
  to do about this bull Enderby. He's active again."</p>

  <p>There was something in the tone of this speech, or in the look which
  accompanied it, that caused the scalp behind my ears to draw and tingle. I
  began to wonder if I had not risked too much in venturing back into the
  lion's den this night. However, it was too late for regrets. I put the best
  face on it I could.</p>

  <p>We trooped upstairs. Some of the boys had been drinking. There was a good
  bit of noise. The office as I have already explained is the front room on the
  second floor. It extends the width of the house, and it has three windows.
  That on the left is over the portico and stoop.</p>

  <p>At the right of the room is a large flat-topped desk. Lorina sat at it
  with her back to the fireplace. She motioned me to a seat at her right. The
  men lounged in chairs about, some of them with their elbows on the desk.
  Lorina ordered the door closed. I was wondering if I'd ever leave that room
  alive.</p>

  <p>Lorina rapped on the desk for attention. "Boys," she said bluntly, "we've
  got a spy among us."</p>

  <p>Instantly every pair of eyes turned on me. I jumped up. My back was in the
  corner. I bluffed them as best I could.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" I cried. "I didn't ask you to take me in.
  You came after me. You gave me your work to do. Haven't I done it? Didn't I
  deliver the goods at Newport? Didn't I undertake a nasty bit of work tonight?
  Ask Freer there. And now you turn on me!"</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet!" commanded Lorina. "You'll have your hearing."</p>

  <p>To the men she said: "For a week I've known there was a leak somewhere,
  and I wanted to test him. I gave him a job out at Amityville, and I sent
  Freer with him. I had an agent in the house out there. Well, he didn't pull
  the job off."</p>

  <p>"Was that my fault?" I cried. "Ask Freer."</p>

  <p>She turned to Freer. "How about it?"</p>

  <p>"I-I didn't see anything," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Were you with him all the time?"</p>

  <p>"He was never out of my sight."</p>

  <p>"Be careful how you answer," she said, "or I'll believe you're in with
  him."</p>

  <p>Freer's face was pale and sweaty. "Well well he flirted with a girl in the
  station. I couldn't hear what he said because I was buying the tickets. It
  looked all right."</p>

  <p>"Looked all right!" snarled Lorina. "You fool! One of Enderby's spies
  tracked you!"</p>

  <p>"I swear we weren't trailed!" cried Freer. "I watched particularly."</p>

  <p>"What time was that?"</p>

  <p>"About quarter past seven."</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock a telegram was delivered at the Sanatorium," said
  Lorina. "My agent called me up. It said: 'Do not leave the house to-night,'
  and was signed 'B. Enderby.'"</p>

  <p>The gang looked at me with a new hatred.</p>

  <p>Lorina laughed harshly. "Oh, this isn't Enderby," she said. "Enderby was
  at the Sanatorium tonight seeing his girl. We had the two of them together,
  and this traitor double-crossed us!"</p>

  <p>They began to move threateningly towards my corner.</p>

  <p>"Keep back!" cried Lorina. "Let's hear what he has to say first."</p>

  <p>I licked my dry lips and did the best I could for myself. "You've got no
  proof!" I cried. "How could I have sent a telegram. I was never out of
  Freer's sight. Why should I have signed it Enderby if Enderby was out there?
  You all know I'm no bull, but a workman at Dunsany's. I can account for every
  minute of my time since Jumbo first picked me up!"</p>

  <p>Lorina was nearer me than any of the men. She took a step forward. I
  guarded my face. But that was not her point of attack. Her hand shot out, and
  the wig was snatched from my head. There I stood with my bare poll. The jig
  was up.</p>

  <p>A loud laugh broke from the men-jackals' laughter, before tearing their
  prey. A different kind of sound came from Freer.</p>

  <p>"My God! it's Mr. Dunsany!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Lorina.</p>

  <p>"Walter Dunsany," he repeated, staring as if he saw a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" she demanded of me.</p>

  <p>I felt as if the worst were over now. A sudden calmness descended on me.
  It was a sort of relief to be able to be myself. "Quite true," I said.</p>

  <p>"What's your game?" she demanded scowling.</p>

  <p>"Do you need to ask?"</p>

  <p>There was a commotion among the men. I heard different exclamations and
  demands. Some were for despatching me on the spot; one suggested I be held
  for a million dollars' ransom.</p>

  <p>Lorina turned on the last speaker. "You fool!" she cried. "Ten millions
  wouldn't save him! He gets a perpetual lodging in my cellar!"</p>

  <p>Cries of approval, more laughter greeted this.</p>

  <p>From her dress Lorina drew the gun I had given her a little while before.
  "Hands up!" she commanded.</p>

  <p>Now I knew it was not loaded, and I had a loaded gun in my pocket. But so
  had every other man there, and all had more practice in drawing their weapons
  than I. So I thought it best to obey. Up went my hands.</p>

  <p>"Foxy, Jim, frisk him!" said Lorina.</p>

  <p>They found the gun, and flung it on the desk. Lorina dropped it in the
  middle drawer. There was nothing else incriminating upon me.</p>

  <p>"Down on the floor with him!" cried somebody.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Lorina. "We'll see what we can find out first."</p>

  <p>I caught at the little straw of hope that showed. "Send them out and I'll
  talk freely," I muttered. "I've no mind to be shot when I'm not looking."</p>

  <p>Overconfidence betrayed her. With a gun in her hand she felt herself more
  than a match for any unarmed man. By a fatal oversight she never looked to
  see if her weapon was loaded. She didn't trust that mob very far, as I knew,
  and perhaps she thought I might have something to say which it was better
  they shouldn't hear. They grumbled, but she was absolute mistress there. She
  ordered them out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," she said. "Wait outside. Do not come in unless I call
  you."</p>

  <p>If I could get that door locked, and get my gun back! I crept along the
  wall opposite the windows a little at a time. Lorina made no serious attempt
  to stop me, because there was no possible escape on that side of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"What have you got to tell me?" she said.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?" I parried. Every second I could gain was
  precious.</p>

  <p>"Stand still!" she commanded. "Where is Enderby tonight?"</p>

  <p>"At the Sanatorium, you said."</p>

  <p>"He returned on the same train you did."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it. I wish I had."</p>

  <p>"Well, where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"At the Rotterdam, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"He has not come back there. I have the place watched."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't know where he is."</p>

  <p>"You lie! Where do you have your meetings?"</p>

  <p>"We have never met but once since I've been on the case."</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to believe that? Stand still!"</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you believe it or not. It's the truth."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I was moving a few inches at a time around the wall towards the
  door the men had gone out by. Since Lorina knew the dozen of them were just
  outside the door, indeed we could hear them, she cared little. My hands were
  still elevated of course.</p>

  <p>"How do you communicate with him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"By letter or telephone."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"At the Rotterdam."</p>

  <p>Her eyes glittered. "I've had enough of this fooling," she said. "If
  you've got anything that's worth my while you'd better say it. My finger's
  impatient."</p>

  <p>I needed a few seconds yet. I adopted a whining tone. "Why should I split
  on Enderby? You're going to croak me anyway. What'll you do for me if I
  tell?"</p>

  <p>"For the last time, tell me what you know, or I'll hand you over to the
  boys!" said Lorina.</p>

  <p>I had reached the door now. The key was in it. I had calculated every move
  in advance. Down came my hands, I turned the key, and flung it out of the
  open window. Lorina began to shoot. The gun makes so little noise at any time
  that she had pulled the trigger several times before she realised it was not
  loaded. By that time I was half way back to the desk. I got the drawer open
  and my hand on my gun, as she leaped on my back. I flung her off.</p>

  <p>She was crying for help by this time. The men outside tried the door, then
  flung themselves against it. It could not hold long against that weight. But
  I needed only a few seconds. I reached the window over the portico. Somehow
  or other I slid down a pillar to the steps. As soon as my feet touched
  something solid I fired three shots in the air. This was the prearranged
  signal to the men in the hotel.</p>

  <p>I vaulted over the balustrade, and crouched in the area way of the
  adjoining house out of range of any shots from the windows. Foxy undertook to
  follow me. As he dropped to the stoop I shot him in the legs. He fell in a
  heap. The others looking out, thought better of imitating him.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the men came running out of the hotel, and Lorina's
  gang disappeared like magic from the windows. But as it had been arranged
  that some of the detectives were to approach over the back fences, and others
  by the roof, I had no fear they would escape us.</p>

  <p>The rest is soon told. When we broke in the door we heard Lorina
  commanding the men not to shoot. As the police crowded into the hall, she
  came towards us head up, and with superb insolence demanded to know the
  meaning of the outrage. I'm afraid I indulged in rude laughter.</p>

  <p>The police were amply provided with handcuffs. We secured the prisoners
  two by two, searched them, and carted them off in the patrol wagon that was
  summoned by telephone. The bag was Lorina, Jumbo, Foxy (not seriously
  wounded), Jim, Freer, seven other men and the three negroes. Blondy escaped
  in safety according to your instructions. There was much mystification
  expressed, since the house was guarded front, rear and roof, and every corner
  of the interior was searched. Of course, I made a great fuss about it.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant of police reported the haul to Inspector Lanman, who
  arrived bye and bye with other high police officials in an automobile. You
  ought to have been there too. I was wild at my inability to get hold of you.
  I used all the eloquence at my command appealing to Lanman not to disturb
  anything in the house, and not to have the prisoners questioned until we
  could get hold of you. He agreed.</p>

  <p>I am remaining here in the house to see that his orders in that connection
  are obeyed, and also on the chance that other members of the gang may come
  in. We have all of them that matter though except the grand boss.
  Unfortunately the noise of this capture will give him warning, but I have
  done the best I could. Lorina's other establishment is well-guarded, but will
  not be broken into until morning. Come quickly when you get this.</p>

  <p>Walter Dunsany. (J.M. no longer.)</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE tremendous popular excitement that followed on the
  capture of Lorina and her gang does not help on my story, so I will pass over
  it quickly. The haul we made in the modern cave of Aladdin staggered the
  public imagination. Much against Mr. Dunsany's advice, the jewels were
  publicly exhibited in police headquarters for three days.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dunsany and I were elevated into the position of newspaper heroes. He
  at least deserved it, but I doubt if he enjoyed his honours. I know I didn't
  enjoy what fell to me. I couldn't help but think if we had only been able to
  hush up this noise for twenty-four hours, maybe the grand boss of the outfit
  might have walked into our welcoming arms.</p>

  <p>I will simply say that a thorough combing of Lorina's house, and of her
  offices, revealed not the slightest bit of evidence leading to the man we
  sought. She was a wonder at covering her tracks. In the midst of all the
  popular praises I was discouraged. There was nothing as far as I could see to
  prevent the organiser of the gang from presently organising another.
  Meanwhile I was in hourly expectation of receiving his compliments in the
  shape of a bullet.</p>

  <p>I had one small hope left, and that was in Blondy. The fact of his escape
  had been duly published, and I was praying that Lorina, deprived now of any
  better instrument might be led to use him. I carefully stayed away from the
  boy, keeping in touch with him by letter and phone. I would not, of course,
  put him up to communicating with Lorina. That would instantly have aroused
  her suspicions. Any move must come from her. I append some of Blondy's
  letters.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">July 10th.</span></p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Enderby:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">The house was pinched last night, as you know by this time.
  I had gone to the back room on the third floor by myself because I thought
  they were going to murder a man in the office, and I was sickened by it. I
  don't know if he got away or not. I suppose the whole story will be in the
  evening papers. Anyhow I heard the three shots outside, which you told me
  would be the signal, so I beat it up the ladder to the scuttle. You told me
  if any one else tried to get out that way, I was to let them go on ahead of
  me and hide in the hall closet, but I was all alone. There was a deuce of a
  racket downstairs. The servants in the front room were hollering, but they
  didn't come out. I got out on the roof and met the detectives coming over
  from the hotel. They grabbed me and threw a light in my face. Seeing who it
  was they let me go. I was glad. I was afraid maybe you had forgotten to give
  them instructions. I went down to the street through the hotel, and chased
  home as quick as I could. According to your instructions I shall go on living
  here as usual until I hear from you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours respectfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Ralph Andrus</span>.</p>

  <p><br>
  For nearly a week nothing of any importance happened. Then I received
  this:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">July 16th</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Enderby</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I called you up this morning to tell you about the lawyer
  coming to the association rooms to see me. This afternoon I went down to his
  office as you told me I should. The fellow said he was one of the lawyers
  hired by Mrs. Mansfield to defend her, and she had given him my name to see
  if I would make a witness on her side at the trial. Then he put me through a
  cross-examination that lasted a couple of hours. I was kind of flustered by
  it, because I didn't know how you would have wanted me to answer his
  questions. But you told me if I didn't know what to say to tell the truth. So
  I did. The only time I lied was when he asked me how I got out of the house
  that night. I said when I got out on the roof I saw the officers coming, and
  hid behind a chimney till they passed. It seems I didn't know enough about
  the gang one way or another to make any difference. The lawyer told me to
  keep my mouth shut if I wanted to stay out of trouble, gave me a couple of
  dollars and sent me home. I hope I handled this matter right.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours respectfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">R.A.</span></p>

  <p><br>
  The lawyer Blondy referred to was a junior partner in one of the best-known
  firms engaged in criminal cases. It had been announced that this firm had
  been retained by Lorina. Since the lawyer had approached the boy openly there
  could be no doubt but that he himself was acting in good faith. I could not
  but feel though that there was something behind this visit, because, of
  course, Lorina knew that Blondy could tell next to nothing about her affairs,
  and that little not to her credit.</p>

  <p>I finally decided that she must have used the young lawyer as a kind of
  cat's-paw to discover Blondy's situation and present disposition towards
  herself. If I was right there would no doubt be developments presently. I
  awaited the event in no little anxiety.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, three days later Blondy called me up to tell me he had just
  received a long letter from Lorina that I ought to read at once. I arranged
  to meet him in an hour at the office of the doctor who had first brought us
  together. He was instructed to make sure that he was not followed there.
  Lorina's letter enclosed a second letter. The enclosure was not sealed. The
  friendly tone of the first so different from Lorina's attitude towards him
  out of jail, excited the boy's derision. It read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Blondy</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I am so glad you made your getaway. The lawyer told me
  about it. You certainly were lucky. He tells me you are broke. I have been
  worrying about this. He will take this letter out to post, but he doesn't
  know what I am going to say to you. That's between ourselves. I know I can
  count on you not to split on a pal. Burn this as soon as you get the contents
  fixed in your mind.</p>

  <p class="letter">I can't send you anything from here, because these devils
  have stripped me. They have even taken my keys, so I can't send and get into
  my safety deposit box for funds. But if you will help me, I'll be in a
  position to do something handsome for you. I have a duplicate set of keys
  that nobody knows about, and I want you to get them for me.</p>

  <p class="letter">I enclose a letter to Mrs. Bradford who is the janitress of
  the house at No. East Fifty-Ninth street. I kept a room there that I could go
  to when I wanted to be quiet. Read the enclosed letter then seal it so she
  will think you don't know what's in it. Do everything just as the letter
  says. Don't forget that my name is Mrs. Watkins to this woman. You will find
  fifty dollars in my pocketbook there. Give her thirty for the rent and ten
  for herself. You keep the other ten. Get a receipt for the rent.</p>

  <p class="letter">The keys are in the pocketbook. Be very careful of them. In
  a few days a man will call you up and ask you if you have them. You ask him
  his name, and he will say Thomas Wilkinson. Then he will tell you what to do,
  and you must obey him exactly. As soon as he gets the keys and can open my
  box he will send you five thousand dollars in bills, which will set you up in
  business or give you a good time, whichever you like. If this turns out all
  right there will be a chance for you to make other good things out of the
  crowd.</p>

  <p class="letter">I enclose the combination to the safe on a separate
  slip.</p>

  <p class="letter">Take care of yourself,</p>

  <p class="letter">With love,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Lorina</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S. You mustn't think from my letter to Mrs. B. that I do
  not trust you. That's just to stall her off.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">L</span>.</p>

  <p><br>
  The enclosure was a masterpiece.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Bradford:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">I have been taken real sick, threatened with nervous
  prostration they say. I have had to go to Dr. &mdash;&mdash;-'s sanatorium at
  Amityville. Don't know how long I'll be here. Now Mrs. Bradford, I'm in a fix
  because I've lost my keys. I keep duplicates in my safe, and so I'm sending
  my nephew to you with this to get them. He has wavy, blond hair and blue
  eyes, and nice white teeth. He slurs his rs a little when he talks like a
  child. So he will call you Mrs. B'adfo'd. These details will identify him to
  you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Please let him into my room with your passkey, and remain
  with him while he is there. Not but what he is a good boy, but boys will be
  boys you know. Don't let him see this. I have given him the combination of my
  safe. Inside is an old handbag with fifty dollars in it and a bunch of keys.
  He will give you thirty dollars of it for the rent, and ten for your trouble.
  Nothing else in the safe must be touched. Thanking you for your trouble,</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely, (Mrs.) Elizabeth Watkins.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S. I hope your rheumatism is better.'</p>

  <p><br>
  I made copies of the letters and the safe combination, and told Blondy to go
  ahead and do exactly as he had been told. I suspected from Lorina's care that
  the little safe would make interesting disclosures. However, I could get into
  it some other time. I was inclined to believe her story about the safety
  deposit box. Like all first-class liars she wove truth into her lies when she
  could. I was hoping, while scarcely daring to hope, that in a matter of such
  vital importance she would not dare trust any one short of the "boss"
  himself. If he would only come after the keys!</p>

  <p>Next day I got the following letter from Blondy.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Enderby</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I did everything just as the letter said. Mrs. Bradford was
  a suspicious kind of woman. She lived in a cellar kind of place below the
  street level. She asked me about a thousand questions before she would let me
  in. But I wasn't afraid of her. Suspicious people are generally easy to
  fool.</p>

  <p class="letter">No. &mdash; East Fifty-Ninth street is an old building that
  is let out in stores and studios. Mrs. Mansfield's room was second floor
  rear. I couldn't look around much the old woman watched me so close. It was
  just an ordinary furnished room, nothing rich like the Lexington avenue
  house. There was an alcove with a bed in it. The only thing funny was the
  number of trunks standing around. I counted seven of them. They had covers
  and cushions on them.</p>

  <p class="letter">The safe was a little one. I opened it all right. There was
  nothing in the main part but a lot of papers and the little satchel. There
  was an inside locked compartment. After I locked the safe again the old woman
  made me destroy the combination before her eyes. I paid her the money, put
  the keys in my pocket, and she hustled me out. That's all.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours respectfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">R.A.</span></p>

  <p><br>
  Pretty good observation for eighteen years old!</p>

  <p>After this followed a period of strained anxiety for me. I could not stay
  near Blondy, of course, and I was afraid the man we hoped to get might
  circumvent him in some way. Maybe instead of telephoning him he would call on
  him in person. Blondy was instructed of course in that event to hang on to
  him like grim death, but how could I expect a boy of his age to get the
  better of an astute crook?</p>

  <p>However, this fear proved groundless. On Thursday morning about eleven
  Blondy called me up. I instantly knew by his breathlessness that something
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"'Guy just called up,'" said Blondy. "'He said: 'Have you got the keys?' I
  came back: 'Who are you?'"</p>

  <p>"'Thomas Wilkinson.'"</p>

  <p>"'O.K.,' said I. Then he started in quick to give me my instructions."</p>

  <p>"I must take the twelve noon train from the Long Island Terminal for
  Greenwood City. I get off at Greenwood City and walk one block North to
  Suffolk avenue which is the main street of the village. I turn to the right
  on Suffolk which is to say turn East or away from New York, and keep straight
  on right out of town to the wide, empty stretch of land that they call
  Ringstead Plains. I have to walk about two miles out this road. Half a mile
  beyond the last house there's a locust tree beside the road. He said I
  couldn't miss it because it was the only tree standing by itself as far as
  you could see. Motor cars pass up and down the road frequently. But I must
  not accept a ride if it's offered to me. I must sit down under this tree as
  if I was tired and stay there ten minutes or so, until anybody who may have
  seen me stop there will have passed out of sight. Then I am to leave the keys
  on the ground behind the tree and walk back to Greenwood City, and take the
  first train for New York. If he gets the keys all right, he said he would
  send the money in a package by mail tomorrow."</p>

  <p>I made notes of all this while the boy was speaking.</p>

  <p>"Is it all right?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Fine!" I said.</p>

  <p>"But the twelve o'clock train! It's quarter past eleven now. I wanted to
  put him off to give you more time, but you said do exactly what he said."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," I said. "Run along and get your train. Follow your
  instructions exactly and leave the rest to me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TIME was very precious, but I allowed myself a few minutes
  for hard, concentrated thought. I believed that Blondy would be under
  surveillance from the time he left the Association rooms until he reached the
  appointed spot. Evidently my man was aware of the advantage to himself of
  rushing the thing through, and it was likely the keys would be picked up
  within a few minutes of the time they were dropped. At any rate he would
  surely come after them by daylight, for night would make an ambush easy.
  Therefore it was up to me to make my preparations before the boy got there.
  Not very easy when he was already about to start.</p>

  <p>My man had had several days in which to find the spot near New York best
  suited to his purpose. From Blondy's description the place he had chosen must
  be bare of cover in miles. "Thomas Wilkinson" would come in an automobile,
  naturally, and if anything in the vicinity aroused his suspicions he would
  not stop. I could not hope to pick him out among all who passed. It was a
  tough problem.</p>

  <p>I called up Lanman the chief of the detective bureau. Nowadays I commanded
  the respect of these people.</p>

  <p>"Look here," I said, "we have a chance to take the boss of the thief trust
  this afternoon, if we strike like lightning."</p>

  <p>"Shoot!" said he.</p>

  <p>"First, send me quick a high-powered automobile with a nervy chauffeur and
  two operatives. Have them pick me up at the Southwest corner of Second avenue
  and 59th street, Queensboro bridge plaza."</p>

  <p>"Right!"</p>

  <p>"Next get together five other good cars without any distinctive marks.
  Come yourself in one of them, and bring a dozen good men. Meet me&mdash;let
  me see&mdash;What town is there near Greenwood City, Long Island, but not on
  the same road?"</p>

  <p>"Ringstead, two miles South."</p>

  <p>"Know a hotel there?"</p>

  <p>"Mitchell's a road house."</p>

  <p>"Good. Have your five cars proceed to Mitchell's by different roads as
  quickly as possible. I may not be able to come there to you, but wait there
  for further instructions by telephone."</p>

  <p>"O.K.," he said. "We'll be on the way in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"One thing more. Bring a good pair of field glasses."</p>

  <p>I took my own binoculars and a gun. On the way to the meeting- place I
  bought a road map of Long Island. The car was already waiting for me at the
  spot named. Lanman was a man after my own heart.</p>

  <p>We made quick time. I was provided with a police badge in case any of the
  local constables should object to our rate of travel. On the road I studied
  my map and got the lay of the land in my head.</p>

  <p>It was twelve-five when we reached Greenwood City, or fifty minutes before
  the train was due. As we passed the railway station I saw a car already
  waiting there, and I wondered idly if that would have anything to do with my
  case. It was a very distinguished-looking car of a foreign make with a dark
  green body of the style the French call coupe de ville. It seemed a little
  odd that any one should choose to ride in a closed car in such hot weather.
  An irreproachable chauffeur and footman waited near.</p>

  <p>We turned into Suffolk street, and hastened on out of town out to
  Ringstead Plains. It was all just as Blondy had given it to me over the
  phone. There was the last house at the edge of the plain, and half a mile
  ahead stood the lonely locust tree beside the road. The house looked as if it
  might belong to a small farmer or market gardener. There was a small barn
  behind it. Ahead of us there was no other habitation visible as far as we
  could see.</p>

  <p>We kept on. It is a well-known motor road, and we passed cars from time to
  time. Earlier and later it would be quite crowded I expect, but this was one
  of the quietest hours. About three- quarters of a mile beyond the locust tree
  there was a wood that I had my eye on. It was not of very great extent, but
  showed a dense growth of young trees.</p>

  <p>Reaching it, I found to my great satisfaction that there was a rough wagon
  track leading away among the trees, I had the chauffeur turn in there. There
  was no other car in view at the moment. Within a few yards the wagon track
  curved a little, and we were lost to view from the road. I got out and made
  my way to the edge of the trees. From this point I found I could overlook the
  locust tree with the aid of my binoculars.</p>

  <p>This was all I wanted. I gave the order to return to Greenwood City. A
  little further in the wood there was a clearing sufficient to enable us to
  turn. One gets over the ground quickly in a car, and when we got back to
  Greenwood we still had twenty- five minutes before the train was due. This
  place, by the way, is not a city at all, but merely a village embowered in
  trees. The handsome green car was still waiting at the station. I went to a
  hotel to telephone.</p>

  <p>To my joy I got Lanman on the phone without delay.</p>

  <p>"I am here at Mitchell's with three of the cars," he said. "The other two
  were sent by a slightly longer route. They will be here directly."</p>

  <p>"Take three cars and proceed by the shortest route to Greenwood City," I
  said. "Make haste because I expect my man on the train from town in twenty
  minutes, and you must get through the village before he arrives."</p>

  <p>"We can be there in five," said Lanman.</p>

  <p>"Turn to the right on Suffolk street and proceed out on the plains. A mile
  and a half out of town you come to the last house. It is a grey house without
  any trees around it; there is a small barn behind it. Stop there and put up
  your cars in the barn in such a way that you can run them out quickly. I
  don't know the people in the house. I have no reason to believe that they
  have any connection with the man we want, but you'll have to use your
  judgment."</p>

  <p>I went on to explain to him just what Blondy was going to do, and how I
  expected our man to turn up shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>"The East windows of the house overlook the locust tree," I went on.
  "Station yourself at one of them with your glasses, and you will be able to
  see whatever happens at the tree."</p>

  <p>"I get you," he said. "What about the other two cars? One of them is just
  turning into the yard now."</p>

  <p>"Let them leave Ringstead by Merton Street," I said, consulting my map,
  "and proceed East to the Joppa Pike; thence North to the Suffolk pike and
  turn back towards Greenwood City. About two miles and a half before reaching
  the village, more than a mile beyond the house where you will be, there is a
  small wood on the left hand side of the road. There is a wagon track leading
  into it. They are to turn in there and they will find me a little way
  inside."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Lanman. "The last car is coming now."</p>

  <p>"Listen," I said. "Our man without doubt will come in a car. After he
  picks up the keys I expect he will keep on in the road. In which case he
  falls into my hands. But if he should turn around and go back it's up to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Lanman grimly.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later I was back at my observation post at the edge of the
  wood. I had not been there long when through my glasses I saw a car turn into
  the farmer's place. A second and a third car followed at short intervals. In
  a quarter of an hour the first police car joined me, and a few minutes
  afterward the second. Each contained two men in addition to the
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>We turned the cars around and stationed them in line where, though they
  were invisible from the high road, they could run out upon it in a few
  seconds. The other side of the highway was fenced. Having completed our
  arrangements, there was nothing to do for a while, and I told the men to take
  it easy.</p>

  <p>According to my calculations Blondy would appear in view about one-thirty.
  It was a long walk from the station and a hot day. Exactly on schedule I saw
  a speck in the distance which presently resolved itself through the glasses
  into the figure of a solitary pedestrian. As he neared the tree I saw that it
  was Blondy. So far so good.</p>

  <p>I was lying on the ground at the edge of the little wood with the glasses
  steadied on a fallen trunk. The whole flat plain was spread before me. The
  cars were about thirty yards behind me, each chauffeur at his wheel. Between
  me and them I had the four men stationed at intervals so I could pass a
  whispered order back.</p>

  <p>While Blondy was covering the space between the house and the locust tree
  a green car hove in view behind him, which I presently recognised from the
  irreproachable chauffeur and footman as the coupe de ville. It overtook the
  walking figure, and came on up the road, past the wood, and past us. I
  wondered if our man was now inside.</p>

  <p>Blondy reached the tree at last. I suspected that he welcomed the shade.
  It seemed perfectly natural for him to sit down under it. He remained there
  ten minutes. Several cars passed to and fro and one of them stopped. This
  puzzled me for a moment, but I supposed that it was merely some good
  Samaritan who offered the perspiring boy a lift. While Blondy was sitting
  there the green car went back. I was pretty sure now that it contained our
  quarry.</p>

  <p>At last Blondy got up and started back. These periods of waiting try a
  man's nerves. Mine were pretty well on edge by this time. It seemed to take
  an age for the boy to retrace his steps over the visible part of the road.
  About two hundred yards beyond the farmhouse there was a bend in it which
  concealed the rest from my view. A minute or two after Blondy disappeared
  from my sight, the big green car again hove into view around the bend. My
  heart hit up a few extra beats.</p>

  <p>"Get ready," I sent word along the line.</p>

  <p>To my great disappointment it did not stop at the tree. It came on, and
  passed the wood again with the loud purr of new tires. However, I explained
  it to myself by the fact that there was another car in view at the moment. I
  set myself to wait in the expectation of his return.</p>

  <p>In five minutes return he did, but this time there was a car close behind,
  and once more he passed out of sight without stopping. I hoped that Lanman
  had marked the passing and repassing of the fashionable car.</p>

  <p>It was now past two o'clock, and the hottest part of the day was coming
  on. A haze of heat undulated shimmeringly over the plain. Our tempers
  suffered. There in the little wood we were in the shade, it is true, but
  there was not a breath of air stirring, and the mosquitoes were busily plying
  their trade. The men breathed hard, and wiped their faces. At first they had
  taken their coats off, but finding the insects could bite through their
  shirt-sleeves they had put them on again. I had thrown off my hot wig. A
  disguise was unnecessary now.</p>

  <p>Once more the green car turned into sight beyond the farmhouse. This time
  the road was empty and my heart beat hopefully. Sure enough it stopped
  opposite the locust tree. "Start your engines," I whispered along the
  line.</p>

  <p>A man alighted from the coupe and walked to the tree. A Panama hat shaded
  his face and I could not get a good look at it. He walked around the tree and
  seemed to be gazing up in its branches, as well as looking down at the roots.
  I could not understand this evolution, still I was pretty sure that I saw him
  stoop and pick something up.</p>

  <p>He returned to his car, and it started forward.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," I said to my men.</p>

  <p>They knew what they had to do. I lingered a moment to see whether he was
  going to turn around or come on. He came straight, faster than he had been
  travelling. I ran after my cars.</p>

  <p>According to instructions they moved out in line across the road,
  completely blocking it. I timed it as closely as I could, but unfortunately
  the road was perfectly straight. With the appearance of the first car out of
  the wood, the green car took the alarm. We heard the screech of the brakes.
  They came to a stop in a cloud of dust. Those town cars can turn almost in
  their own length. Around they went and back with the exhaust opened wide.</p>

  <p>We jumped aboard our cars and as soon as we could disentangle ourselves
  took after them. They were half a mile away when we got straightened out. Now
  if only Lanman did not fail me!</p>

  <p>To my joy, away ahead I saw the police cars slowly move one, two, three
  across the road. We had him trapped! Once more the green car stopped in a
  cloud of dust. Lanman and I approaching from opposite directions, reached it
  simultaneously. We had our guns out.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" the angry, frightened chauffeur cried.</p>

  <p>We paid small attention to him. I and my gun looked into the coupe
  together. Lanman ran around to the other door. In the corner of the seat I
  saw, exquisite, immaculate Alfred Mount!</p>

  <p>"You!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"You!" I cried.</p>

  <p>Of the two I was the more surprised. For the moment I was incapable of
  moving.</p>

  <p>He did not speak again, nor attempt to get up. Through the front window of
  the coupe he saw the small crowd of detectives gathering. The light died out
  of those bright, black eyes. He clapped the back of his hand to his mouth as
  you have seen women do in moments of despair. The hand dropped nervelessly in
  his lap. Before my eyes his face turned livid. His body stiffened out in a
  horrible brief spasm, and he fell over sideways on the seat dead!</p>

  <p>My eyes and Lanman's were glued alike in horror to the corpse. The left
  hand, a hand too elegant for a man's, had now dropped to the floor. A glance
  at it explained the tragedy. An immense flat emerald on the ring finger was
  sprung back revealing a tiny cup beneath. The chief and I looked at each
  other in understanding. We were recalled to practical matters by the
  imperious tooting of a horn up the road. One oncoming chauffeur naturally
  objected to the barricade of automobiles. Lanman and I alike dreaded the
  irruption of foolish curiosity-seekers. At a word from me he hustled the
  detectives into their respective cars, and got them straightened out. They
  were all ordered back to headquarters. All this happened within a few
  moments. I don't believe any of the detectives realised that the man was
  dead.</p>

  <p>None of the engines had stopped, and we quickly had the road clear. Lanman
  and I thought so much alike in this crisis that it was hardly necessary to
  talk. We got into the coupe with its ghastly burden and without touching it,
  sat down on the two little seats facing it. A glance at the police badge was
  sufficient for the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Your master has had a stroke," I said to him. "Take us to his home as
  soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Lanman nodded his approval.</p>

  <p>When we got Mount's body to his rooms, we sent for his doctor, one of the
  most famous practitioners in town, also for the commissioner of police and
  for Mr. Walter Dunsany.</p>

  <p>When the five of us were gathered together, we consulted, and finally put
  it up to the commissioner to decide what ought to be done in the interests of
  good citizenship. After listening to me, to Mr. Dunsany and to the doctor,
  all of whom felt the same, though for different reasons, he voted with us. We
  agreed that Mount had taken the best way out under the circumstances. None of
  us wanted to drag his dead body through the mire. As much of the loot as
  could be recovered was already recovered. None of us wanted to see any more
  scandal aired in the newspapers. Therefore it was given out that Mr. Mount
  had committed suicide while motoring in the country, and no cause for the act
  was assigned. Of course I told Roland and Irma the truth, so that no shadow
  might dim their future happiness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LITTLE more remains to be told. For weeks afterwards the
  case was threshed out in the newspapers, but nothing was brought out that you
  do not already know. No suspicion attached to Mount's chauffeur and footman.
  They had met him at the Greenwood City station according to orders. He had
  exclaimed at the beauty of Ringstead Plains, and they thought that was why he
  had himself carried back and forth so many times. On the last journey he had
  remarked the locust tree, speaking of the rarity of the species, and had
  ordered them to stop so that he could examine it. They knew nothing about
  trees, of course. They had not seen him pick up the keys.</p>

  <p>The news of Mount's death took all the fight out of Lorina. Whatever human
  feeling there was in that woman was all for him. It appeared that her
  devotion to him was so abject, that she was even willing to help him in his
  plotting to secure Irma for his wife.</p>

  <p>The thieves were sent up for terms more or less corresponding to the
  degrees of their guilt. Lorina and Foxy are still there. Jumbo is out now,
  and professes to have reformed. He seems to bear me no malice, and
  occasionally braces me for a small loan. One of the gang, Bella Bleecker,
  escaped for lack of evidence. I knew that she was one of Lorina's creatures,
  whom Mount had placed near Irma as a spy, but there was nothing to connect
  her with the thefts.</p>

  <p>There was one mysterious feature of the case which the trial did not clear
  up, i.e., the source of Roland's handsome legacy. I had my suspicions but no
  proof. Mount's doctor was one of his executors and I was permitted to examine
  the dead man's papers. I found that on the last day of March previous he had
  drawn $40,000 in cash.</p>

  <p>This was pretty conclusive, but there was a link of evidence still
  missing. Continuing a search of Mount's effects I found a receipted bill from
  an obscure lawyer for legal services rendered about this time. I looked the
  man up. He proved to be a seedy, servile little creature, one of the
  desperate hangers-on of the outer fringe of a respectable profession. Mount
  being dead and no longer a possible employer it was easy to make the lawyer
  talk.</p>

  <p>Whether or not he knew what he was doing, I can't say. He claimed that
  Mount had told him he wished to do something for a worthy young fellow who
  was too proud to accept anything from him direct. He then laid out the scheme
  of the mysterious, unhappy lady who was supposed to have died leaving Roland
  Quarles her fortune. Mount, the lawyer said, supplied the ingenious letter
  that was sent to Roland. The lawyer carried the money to the trust
  company.</p>

  <p>This information dissipated the last bit of mystery. The more I thought
  over it the more I marvelled at Mount. Certainly there was something
  magnificent in his villainies. Fancy giving your rival forty thousand dollars
  in order to ruin him! It was clear now why the order had come down from above
  to Jumbo to sell Irma's pearls to Roland at a reduced price. I wonder if ever
  a more devilish plot was hatched by one man to ruin another. And how nearly
  it had succeeded. Mount had shown the devil's own cunning in playing on the
  weak spots in Irma and in Roland.</p>

  <p>The period of the trial was a hateful time for all of us. Our own
  happiness was not to be thought of until that ordeal was over. A blessed
  peace descended on us when the last verdict was rendered.</p>

  <p>The blissful event occurred in October. Irma and Roland insisted that
  Sadie and I must be married at the same time they were.</p>

  <p>The double event took place in the Little Church Around the Corner. Only
  Mr. Dunsany, Blondy, the Doctor and a few others were present. We all felt as
  if we had had enough publicity to last us the rest of our lives.</p>

  <p>Roland insisted on returning the balance of his legacy to the Mount
  estate. I thought he had the best reason in the world for hanging on to it,
  but that was Roland. He actually wanted Irma to turn over her pearls to the
  executors, less what she had paid for them, but we all fought him on that.
  She had purchased them fairly, I insisted, and if Mount had named too low a
  price that was his affair. He gave in when I pointed out that was the cause
  of her giving up a lucrative profession, and he had no right to deprive her
  of her property also.</p>

  <p>The famous blue pearls were sold. Part of the proceeds was devoted to the
  purchase of a fine old manor and a farm on the Eastern shore of Maryland.
  Roland and Irma have forsaken the footlights forever. Farming is their true
  vocation, they say, and nothing could ever tempt them back.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dunsany has ever remained my firm friend. He insisted on rewarding me
  very handsomely for my work on the great case, though I considered the
  reputation it brought me enough. The honour seems likely to last me as long
  as I am able to work. With the money Sadie and I decided to buy a smaller
  place adjoining our friends. Sadie has turned farmer, too.</p>

  <p>I can't be there as much as I would like. After the dust and danger of my
  work it is like Heaven to run down home. At first Sadie objected strenuously
  to this arrangement. She said she expected to continue to help me with my
  work. That was what she married me for, she said. But the one fright was
  enough for me. I don't hear so much about her desire now. Sadie has other
  things to occupy her mind. Yes, three of them.</p>
