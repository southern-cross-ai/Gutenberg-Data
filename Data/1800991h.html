<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; SUNDOWN</h2>

<p class="first">EVE LEVERAGE came out of the hotel like a
boy&mdash;swiftly, carelessly, and her lips pursed in the
attitude of whistling. Her gray eyes quested along the street
with a level expectancy; her tip-tilted nose made a wrinkling
gesture against the hot sun. Two gangling punchers who seemed to
have collapsed to semi-consciousness on the porch steps gathered
themselves together foot by foot and rose before her, muttering,
"G'mornin', Miss Eve," in unison. Eve's thoughtful preoccupation
vanished before a frank, glinting smile. "Hello, Pete. Hello,
Buck. Busy as usual, I see." Then she stopped so abruptly that
one of the men threw out his hand, thinking she was about to trip
on the steps. Eve never noticed the gesture. Her glance, going on
down the street, had reached its mark. David Denver appeared
through the crowd and strolled leisurely forward. A coral pink
appeared on Eve's cheeks; she looked again at Messrs. Buck Meems
and Pete Wango, and she looked into her purse.</p>

<p>"What became of that letter?" she asked these two shiftless
sons of the prairie. "I had it in my hands just a moment
ago."</p>

<p>The gentlemen flinched, as if accused of stealing it. Wango,
having a chew in his mouth, remained stolidly dumb. But Meems was
a more versatile man and made a stab at intelligent conversation.
"Was it&mdash;uh&mdash;important, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"You have no idea," said Eve mysteriously. "Now, I've got to
find it." She turned to the door, cast a quick look around, and
stopped half inside the opening to watch Denver; to her the
street, dusty and sprawling and hot, had become suddenly
eventful.</p>

<p>David Denver&mdash;Black Dave Denver&mdash;approached in
comfortable idleness. He had his hat tipped back and his face
turned toward Cal Steele who walked alongside and told some kind
of a story with much gesturing of arm. Denver nodded, the somber
gravity of his features lighting up. Rather wistfully the girl
wished she knew the kind of a story Cal Steele related, for there
were few people who could make Dave Denver smile. Steele, in
fact, was almost the only man who had the power of lifting Denver
out of those strange and darkly taciturn moods that so often
descended upon him.</p>

<p>The two of them stopped. Al Niland came across to join in, and
presently Steve Steers emerged from Grogan's Western Star. So the
four of them drew together as they inevitably did when in the
same neighborhood. Dissimilar in so many respects and sharply
varied in personalities, there yet was some common quality that
cemented a deep friendship between them. The girl often had
wondered about it, and at this moment she puzzled over the
problem again. Al Niland was a lawyer who liked to take poor
men's cases and fight with an ironical energy. Steve Steers was a
roving puncher who, though welcome on any ranch, preferred to
ride free and solitary through the hills. Cal Steele owned a
small outfit near Dave Denver's D Slash ranch, and of the group
this man was the most brilliant, the most volatile, and the most
prodigal of his energy and talents. They were all young, and they
were all fighters. But the girl, seeking deeper reasons, knew
some deeper trait was shared by them. They were restless,
nonconforming men; each a strong individualist and without
illusions. Dave Denver's streak of clear-sighted grimness could
be found likewise in the others.</p>

<p>The girl sighed a little as she saw Denver's smile fade and
his bold features settle. The others were grinning amiably at
some wild tale told by Steve Steers; but Denver's moment of
forgetfulness was past, and he reverted again to the stormy,
unsettled side of his nature. The first hot sun of the young year
reached nooning and flashed down on the shackling, paint
blistered buildings of the town, on the pine false fronts, on the
whitewashed 'dobe walls, on the stone turret of the courthouse,
on the drawn curtains of the second-story windows. A dinner bell
rang. Buck Meems was drawling at his partner.</p>

<p>"'S funny thing, Pete. Ev'body considers Denver a big man. You
do, I do, ev'body does. But look at him standin' beside Al
Niland, not an inch taller ner a pound heavier. Al ain't more'n
five feet eleven, and he don't weigh a hunnerd-seventy on the
hocks. See what I mean? Denver ain't rully a big man when yuh git
him among others. It's only when he's off by hisself that he
looks like a young house movin' down the street. Funny, ain't it,
Pete?"</p>

<p>"I could die of laughin'," muttered the drowsing Wango. "Ever
have him slap yuh on the back?"</p>

<p>"Nuh."</p>

<p>"Take a try sometime and see if they's anything humorous about
that."</p>

<p>Buck Meems was not a man lightly to cast aside an idea. He
pursued this one doggedly, his mind almost audibly creaking from
the strain of unaccustomed thinking. "Reason he looms so big
alone is because we sorter expect him to be big. Git my idee,
Pete? I mean big things is done by big men in a big sorter way.
Folla me?"</p>

<p>"I'm limpin' after yuh," admitted Pete.</p>

<p>"He's big," insisted Buck Meems, attempting to wring the last
drop of significance from his thought, "because even though he
ain't actually big nev'less he's big on account o' the big way he
does big&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gawd's sake," groaned Wango, "roll over and get it offen yore
chest."</p>

<p>Meems, silenced, brooded darkly. "I bet," he finally
announced, "that if somebody put a bullet in yore coco it'd
rattle like a nickel in a tin cup. Le's eat."</p>

<p>"Why, thanks fer offerin' to pay my dinner," said Wango and
rose instantly.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about&mdash;" exploded Meems and became
conscious of the girl's presence. The two stalked past her into
the hotel, and she heard the murmur of their argument floating
back. Denver broke away from his friends and sauntered on, at
which the rose color on Eve Leverage's cheeks began to deepen.
She moved casually across the porch. Denver turned in and met her
with a slow lift of his hat. The girl, who knew this man's temper
better than he would ever realize, saw the small crinkling
furrows of pleasure spring around his eyes, and because of that
signal her chin lifted gayly.</p>

<p>"This is a Thursday," he mused in an even, drawling voice,
"and what brings you to town during the middle of the week?"</p>

<p>"Dad had business, so I rode along with him. But," and she
assumed a mock deference, "if you don't want me in Sundown I
shall of course get right in the wagon and drive home."</p>

<p>"Not a good idea," he decided. "You were meant to be right on
this spot at this minute to cheer a dull man on a dull day."</p>

<p>"The king speaks," sighed Eve, "and the poor maid trembles in
fear. What is your will, my good and great lord?"</p>

<p>He put his head aside and scowled at her. "That," he
reflected, "has all the earmarks of a muffled knock. Little girls
ought to have more respect for age."</p>

<p>"Oh, my training has all been wrong, Mister Denver. But don't
you think it's almost time for you to throw away the notion I'm
still a little girl? You've been thinking that for ten years.
People do grow."</p>

<p>He studied her with perfect gravity and over so long a period
that she began to lose her cool ease of manner. This man could
make a mask of his face, and one seldom knew if he were serious
or if behind the ruggedly modeled features there lay a soft
laugh.</p>

<p>"You might be surprised," he observed finally, "just how often
I change my mind about you, Eve."</p>

<p>"Now that's interesting. Tell me more."</p>

<p>"Just like a woman. Do you ever eat?"</p>

<p>"I have been known to."</p>

<p>"Well, you look hungry right now, and I feel charitable."</p>

<p>"I shall eat a great deal and run up a big bill," she warned
him. "And you must order a whole jar of pickles for me. I expect
that of gentlemen who take me to dine."</p>

<p>"Pickles for a grown lady," agreed Dave Denver solemnly and
followed her into the dining room. They took a table in one
corner and watched a hungry Sundown citizenry file through the
door. Denver's glance roamed across the room, and Eve,
experiencing a queer twinge of feeling that was half pride and
half jealousy, saw that one of the waitresses had abandoned the
big table and was coming over. Somehow this man had the power of
creating loyalty. Men spoke to him in passing by, spoke to him
with that soft slurring courtesy of equal to equal. His three
strong friends sauntered in; but though there was room at the
table for them, they only nodded and passed on to another, giving
him the privacy he seemed to desire. Colonel Fear Langdell paused
a moment, bowed at Eve, and spoke quietly to Dave Denver.
"Meeting of the Association at two, Dave." Denver nodded, and
Langdell walked away, a thin, straight ramrod of a man, quite
conscious of his power. Eve, eating with the unashamed vigor of
youth, knew that it was not every man nor many men for whom Fear
Langdell would take extra steps; and this thought brought out
another. No matter what company Dave Denver was in, and no matter
how quietly he sat back, the effect of his presence would be felt
as it was in the dining room.</p>

<p>Remembering Buck Meems's talk, she studied Denver candidly.
The puncher was right. Denver was not overly large. Her own
father was as tall and as heavy. The comparison somehow surprised
her, for she had always thought of Denver as being much the
bulkier. The difference, she discovered, lay elsewhere&mdash;in
Denver's big-boned wrists, in his sweep of shoulders, in the
unsymmetrical boldness of his face. A scar shaped like a crescent
lay on one dark cheek, black hair ran rebelliously along his
head, and his eyes sat deep, violet eyes with flecks of other
coloring in them. There lay the difference&mdash;there was the
seat of that power which stamped him so definitely.</p>

<p>"When you get through with the inquest," he drawled, "I'd like
to know the verdict."</p>

<p>She caught herself and looked down. "Apparently you read
minds, David."</p>

<p>The shadows left his features; humor flashed from his eyes.
"No, but I can read little girls' faces."</p>

<p>"Big girl in this case."</p>

<p>"Big girl it is, then." He leaned forward. "Why are you so
all-fired anxious to grow up?"</p>

<p>"I have already grown up. I am twenty and as old and wise as I
ever shall be. You ought to know that about women."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Where would I be getting my information?"</p>

<p>"I have been told you were rather successful with women," said
Eve looking squarely at him. The shot struck him dead on. The
deeply set eyes turned stormy and then swiftly cleared.</p>

<p>"Believe nothing you hear and only half of what you see," he
replied enigmatically. "And that doesn't sound good, coming from
you, Eve."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddlesticks!" exclaimed the girl. "Do you think I am a
little dummy wrapped up in five yards of cloth? But I suppose I
must be meek or get sent away from the table."</p>

<p>He chuckled. "I reckon you have grown up, for you've learned
the trick of drawing a man off the trail. I asked you what was
your all-fired hurry to blossom out as a lady. Ain't there grief
enough in this world without hurryin' to meet it?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Eve, far more sober than she had been thus
far, "I shall not tell you. Someday possibly you may learn for
yourself."</p>

<p>"After I get more education?" he countered grimly.</p>

<p>Eve's father, Jake Leverage, came into the dining room and
walked over to them. "One o' you two is in bad company," he
observed amiably, "but I wouldn't swear which." He sat down and
reached for a platter. "Goin' to beef much stuff this spring,
Dave?"</p>

<p>"No. Market's too shot. Hold over until later."</p>

<p>"When a man talks that independent I reco'nize he ain't got
any mortgages to worry about," grunted Leverage, parting his
whiskers.</p>

<p>"I let the bankers do that worryin'," was Denver's dry
response. "They seem to thrive and get rich doin' it, so why not
let 'em?"</p>

<p>"You allus was a hand to run your own show," agreed Leverage.
"But the more immediate question is, have you lost any stock
through strange disappearance?"</p>

<p>"Rustlers don't seem to like my beef, Jake."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well, yore lucky. I don't know what this country's
comin' to. Somethin's got to be done to somebody. I ain't
mentionin' any names but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know of any names you might mention?"</p>

<p>Leverage looked a little uncomfortable, and Eve watched Denver
with a wrinkle of thought on her forehead.</p>

<p>"Folks can do some pretty close guessin'," grunted Leverage.
"And when fifteen-twenty people guess the same I'd say there must
be a foundation o' fact. You goin' to the Association
meetin'?"</p>

<p>"I'll listen in," assented Denver idly.</p>

<p>"There's got to be more'n just listenin' this time. You know
as well as I do that this sort of horseplay can't go on. It comes
right down to a proposition of who is goin' to run this country,
the roughs and the toughs or the ranchers. It is a fine state of
affairs when honest men raise beef for crooks to steal. I ain't
in business for my health, ner I don't propose to play Santy
Claus for Mister&mdash;" He checked himself from indiscretion and
reddened.</p>

<p>"I see you have a particular gentleman in mind," suggested
Denver.</p>

<p>"And his whole damned ring," added Leverage stoutly. "It's up
to us to play a little game of root, hawg, or die."</p>

<p>"Takes three things to hang a man," opined Denver. "You've got
to catch him, convict him, and find a big enough rope to hold
him."</p>

<p>"The second item can be allowed as done right now. A good-
sized posse can do the other two. I'll go so far as to furnish
the rope myself. But you don't seem totally sold on the idee,
Dave. Don't it mean nothin' to you? It had oughta. Yore eatin'
pie from the same dish as the rest of us ranchers. It ain't no
time to back and fill."</p>

<p>Denver looked at Eve, once more displaying the old temper of
somber disbelief. "I believe in playin' my game and lettin' the
other man play his. If the time comes when I've got a chore to do
against a rustler I'll do it alone without askin' for help. Half
of the big cattlemen in this county got their start by means of a
quick rope and a careless brandin' iron. Now that these same
dudes have got rich and turned honest they send up a tinhorn
squawk every time they lose a calf. Let 'em haze their own
rustlers instead of puttin' the chore on others."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you hang a proved rustler?" demanded Leverage.</p>

<p>"I'd have to think about it," was Denver's slow reply. "A man
would have to be considerably smaller and meaner than
me&mdash;which is sayin' considerable&mdash;before I'd want to
haul him out on a limb."</p>

<p>Leverage shook his head. "Hate to hear you say that. It's
worse than a case of some fellow nibblin' a few head here and a
few head there. It's organized outlawry we're goin' to have to
fight. Root, hawg, or die. We run our business or they run us. I
ain't able to get very soft-hearted over a crook under them
circumstances."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to be pinched before I shout," drawled
Denver, eyes following across the dining room. A man came in with
a printed broadside and tacked it to the wall; black type
announced to Sundown city the following entertainment:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">LOLA MONTEREY!<br>
AND THE WESTERN OPERA COMPANY<br>
WILL PRESENT AT OUR OPERA HOUSE<br>
THIS EVENING<br>
AN OLD FAVORITE<br>
CAVALIER OF SPAIN!<br>
<br>
LOLA, SUNDOWN'S OWN SINGING BEAUTY,<br>
COMES BACK TO HER BIRTHPLACE<br>
AFTER A TRIUMPHAL TOUR<br>
OF EUROPE TO PLEASE THE FOLKS<br>
OF THE OLD HOMETOWN TONIGHT!</p>

<p><br>
Jake Leverage scanned the notice. "They sure got the country
plastered with them notices. I see 'em on every juniper shrub
along the road. Been three years since we saw Lola in a play,
ain't it, Eve? What's she want to come back to this sun-cooked
scope of alkali-crusted land for, anyhow? I got no admiration for
foreign places like Yurrup, but if I was a gal with Lola's
talents I sure wouldn't waste no time around here. I'd go away
and stay away."</p>

<p>Eve tried to catch her father's attention, but he went on
blandly. "A great girl. I'm no hand for this fa-so-la music as a
rule, but it was a genuine pleasure to sit back in the old Palace
and hear her sing. Yes, sir. Well, I reckon you got to go to
that, uh, Eve?"</p>

<p>He turned to his daughter and received in full measure the
impact of her warning glance. She shook her head slightly, at
which the old man muttered under his breath and combed back his
mustache to drink the rest of his coffee. Eve's clear face seemed
sharp and troubled as she watched Dave Denver. He had turned to
the notice and was staring at it, all features caught up in a
brooding, stormy expression. For a time he appeared to forget all
others in the room, to forget that there were people around who
might be interested in observing his reaction to Lola Monterey's
name. Eve lowered her eyes to the table, knowing very well how
many quick and covert glances were thrown toward Dave Denver.
Lola was back, bringing with her a breath of the old story and
the old gossip.</p>

<p>Denver squared himself to the table and reached for his
cigarette papers. "Yeah," he observed casually, "she always had a
fine voice. The outside world was her place."</p>

<p>"Then why should she come back?" Leverage wanted to know and
received a kick on his booted leg under the table.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say," mused Denver. "Probably Lola doesn't know
herself. That's the way she does things."</p>

<p>"All wimmen's alike," grunted Leverage and scowled on his
daughter. His leg hurt.</p>

<p>Outside was the jangle and clatter of the Ysabel Junction
stage making the right-angle turn from Prairie Street to Main. By
common consent the people in the dining room adjourned dinner and
headed for the door. Denver walked behind Leverage and Eve; the
girl, never knowing why she should let herself say such a thing,
spoke over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Old times for you, David. Aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>She was instantly sorry, and a little ashamed when she heard
Denver's slow answer come gently forward.</p>

<p>"You've convinced me you're no longer a little girl, Eve. I'm
not sure I like the change."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Little girls are more charitable minded than big ones."</p>

<p>They were on the porch. The stages&mdash;there were three of
them this trip instead of one&mdash;veered up to the hotel porch
and stopped. Some courteous citizen opened the door of the front
coach and lifted his hat. A woman stepped daintily down, and
there was a flash of even teeth as she smiled on the crowd. Eve's
small fists tightened; she threw a glance behind her, but Dave
Denver had disappeared from the porch and was not to be seen. Eve
thought Lola Monterey's eyes went through the ranks of the
assembled Sundowners with more than passing interest, but if the
woman was disappointed she was too accomplished an actress to
reveal it. Old man Leverage muttered, "By Jodey, the girl's
pretty, Eve. She's got beyond Sundown."</p>

<p>Eve nodded, a small ache in her heart. The tempestuous,
flamboyant dance-hall girl of three years ago had returned from
her conquests with the veneer of fine manners and proud self-
confidence. Her jet-black hair bobbed in the sun, and the slim,
pointed face, showing the satin smoothness of Spanish blood, had
the stirring dignity of actual beauty. Moving up the steps with
the same lithe grace that had brought her out of poverty and mean
surroundings, she paused, swung around, and smiled again on
Sundown. Soft and husky words fell into the silence with a queer
vitality.</p>

<p>"I am home&mdash;and glad."</p>

<p>Then she passed into the hotel, the rest of the opera company
following after. A traveling salesman, calling heartily to his
friends, swept past. And at the end of the procession strolled an
extremely tall man with the jaw and the nose and the eye of
England. He seemed weary, bored, puzzled. At the door he paused
to ask a plaintive question of a bystander, and those nearest him
caught the full fragrance of a broad and richly blurred speech
freshly blown from Albion's misty shores.</p>

<p>"I say, my friend, one of my bally braces has burst a
stitching. Can you direct me to the local haberdashery?"</p>

<p>The crowd was dissolving. Leverage turned on his daughter. "I
reckon you'll be wantin' to see the show tonight, uh?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Eve, "but why in the world did you mention it in
front of David? It made me feel as small as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good grief, why?" demanded the astonished Leverage. "It ain't
a crime."</p>

<p>"Do you think I want him to believe I was fishing for an
invitation? And you shouldn't have mentioned Lola around him,
Dad."</p>

<p>Leverage shook his head. "Wimmen beat me. Danged if they
don't. Now a kid like you has got to go and join the ranks. Well,
we'll stay over then."</p>

<p>"We'll go right home," said Eve, "so I can get into some
clothes. Folks don't go to shows in gingham dresses, and there's
Mother."</p>

<p>"Imagine that," grinned Leverage. "Well, don't forget that the
most important ceremony you been through so far, which was bein'
born, didn't call for no clothes at all. And I have et with three
Senators and a governor with nothin' better than overalls on
which had a red flannel patch in the seat. But you can go home
and come back, though Ma won't want to come. I know better'n to
argue. Wait till I get Joe Peake to take you in a rig. I got to
stay over for the Association meetin'."</p>

<p>Eve smiled at her father and strolled down the street, leaving
the porch deserted except for two lackadaisical gentlemen who
somehow had witnessed all the recent excitement from the
comfortable vantage point of the porch rockers.</p>

<p>"Buck," said Wango, "whut's that brace business which the
Englishman was cryin' over?"</p>

<p>"I heard somewhere that those fellas called suspenders
braces," replied Meems.</p>

<p>"Hell, ain't that peculiar? And whut's a habadashery,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Your turn to guess," drawled Meems. "I done my share."</p>

<p>"Well," growled Wango, "he ain't a-gunta git by with no
foreign hooch-a-ma-cooch like that around here."</p>

<p>"Lola sure has got pritty," reflected Meems.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Reckon Denver figgers so."</p>

<p>"Shut up," admonished Meems without heat. "Don't drag in dead
cats."</p>

<p>"Ain't you a moral son of a gun? Pardon me for chewin' tobacco
in yore presence. But what I'm wonderin' is how the stage got
through without excitement today. Yuh know, they's supposed to be
money in the Wells-Fargo box this trip."</p>

<p>"Don't be mellerdramatic, Wango. Who'd bring money into a
joint like Sundown?"</p>

<p>"I heard," said Meems lazily. "Well, mebbe Lou Redmain was
asleep at the switch."</p>

<p>Buck Meems rose from the depths of the rocker and stared at
his partner with a penetrating eye and said very coldly, "Was I
you, Pete, I'd git me some packthread and sew up that four-
cornered thing yuh call a mouth."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," stated Meems succinctly. "It's too hard to git
partners, an' I don't want yuh shot down until I git back what
yuh owe me. As for the gent whose name yuh was so careless as to
mention out loud&mdash;don't do it no more. You don't know him.
You never heard of him, see? Let yore betters worry about that
business. You and me is humble folks with an itch to keep on
breathin'."</p>

<p>"Trouble's comin', nev'less," maintained Wango.</p>

<p>"Comin' hell a-riot," agreed Meems. "That's what the
Association is meetin' for. That's why yuh see Dave Denver
stalkin' around the streets lookin' about as hard as I ever saw
him. But you and me is out of it, see? Or have I got to spell the
words?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," breathed Wango and cast a sidewise glance at his
partner. "How about a drink?"</p>

<p>"Thanks for the invite," said Meems, and rose instantly.</p>

<p>"I never said nothin' about an invite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it was nice of yuh to offer to pay my way," broke in
Meems firmly. "Come on."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; STORM WARNING</h2>

<p class="first">DAVE DENVER and Al Niland stood at one corner of
Grogan's hundred-foot bar and downed an after-dinner whisky neat,
as was the custom. The men of Sundown drifted in, took their
liquor, and swapped unhurried talk. Denver looked around the
room, nodding here and there at ranchers he hadn't seen during
the winter. Niland leaned closer.</p>

<p>"Did you see the same fellow I happened to see get off the
third stage?"</p>

<p>"Stinger Dann?"</p>

<p>"The same," grunted Niland. "Since when's he taken to payin'
fare?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's run all his good horses to death," suggested
Denver.</p>

<p>"Somebody's doin' a lot of night ridin', that's certain,"
mused Niland. "It's a funny thing how this county reacts to the
hint of trouble. All winter we've been quiet. Nothing's happened
much. All of a sudden folks get a little skittish and quit
talkin' out loud. The underground telegraph starts workin'. Look
around the room and see how many men are swappin' conversation
real close together and tryin' to appear aboveboard. I never saw
the signs fail. Pretty soon something will break loose."</p>

<p>"Which brings us back to Stinger Dann," drawled Denver. "He's
enterin' for his liquor. Where's he been the last few weeks?"</p>

<p>Niland spared a short, quick glance at a man with a burly
frame and raw-red cheeks cruising toward the bar; Stinger Dann
was scowling straight ahead and paying heed to nobody, as was his
characteristic way of moving through life.</p>

<p>"Looks nowhere and sees everything," muttered Niland. "I don't
know where he's been holin' up, Dave. You tell me where Redmain's
been, and I'll tell you where Dann's been. Same place. He's
probably here to cover the interests of his beloved chief in the
Association meeting."</p>

<p>Dave Denver chuckled. "That would be just the nervy thing Lou
Redmain might think of."</p>

<p>"There was some trouble over beyond Sky Peak a week ago. Will
Wire's men ran into lead one night when they was crosscuttin'
their range for home."</p>

<p>Denver considered the news thoughtfully. "That's gettin' a
little closer to Sundown, ain't it? Usually the boys do their
stealin' farther off."</p>

<p>"The time may come when we'll have to do some shootin' on our
own account," prophesied Niland.</p>

<p>"Let's wait till the wolf howls first. All I seem to hear at
present is a lot of bear talk. Enter Mister Steers, looking very
sad. Which foot did the horse step on, Steve?"</p>

<p>"Aw, hell," grunted Steve and reached for a bottle.</p>

<p>"Expressive but vague," was Niland's ironic comment. "Somebody
must of hurt your feelin's to the extent of offerin' you a
job."</p>

<p>The compact, sandy-haired Steve Steers drank his potion and
shuddered. "I don't never seem to get a break, men. Consider this
item. I shore want to take in the show tonight, just for old
time's sake. But Debbie's off up in Mogul country with her folks
on a visit so I can't take her. And if I dared go to see Lola
Monterey alone I never would hear the last of it. Nossir, I never
seem to get a break."</p>

<p>"Wear false whiskers," suggested Niland.</p>

<p>"They'd fall off," mournfully remarked Steve Steers. "That's
my luck. And somebody like Miz Jim Coldfoot would see me and go
tell Debbie."</p>

<p>"Love," reflected Niland judicially, "is a mighty purifier of
mortal man."</p>

<p>Denver, standing slightly aside and watching Steve out of
grave eyes, drawled idly, "Depends on the man, Al. I reckon love
would have to be some stronger than hydrochloric acid to purify
Steve."</p>

<p>"Love," said Mister Steers. "Ha-ha."</p>

<p>Niland winked discreetly at Denver. "After you're married,
Steve, it'll be better."</p>

<p>"Or worse," groaned Steve. "Let's have another drink of this
here panther spit."</p>

<p>Stinger Dann was walking flat-footedly away from the bar. In
the center of the room he threw a quick glance back to where Dave
Denver stood, and his rude, cold eyes seemed to contain a
definite challenge. So marked was the gesture that a lull came to
Grogan's saloon, and two men standing beyond Dann moved out of
range. Denver never stirred. A flare of stronger light flickered
up to meet the gunman's challenge, and the rugged features
hardened perceptibly. Dann moved on and left the saloon.</p>

<p>"That had all the earmarks of an opening play," said Niland
quietly. "Didn't I tell you things was smokin' up
hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Let 'em smoke," mused Denver. "I'm mindin' my own business
and having a good time doing it. Maybe I won't always be doin'
that, but we'll wait and see."</p>

<p>Cal Steele rolled into the saloon. He marched up to his
partners with a flashing, nervous smile. "Well, congratulate
me."</p>

<p>"Where yuh been?" demanded Steve Steers.</p>

<p>"Reviving some very pleasant memories," said Steele. He poured
himself a drink and tipped the glass to the rest, standing quite
erect; undeniably he had a carriage and a polish to him the
others lacked. Somewhere along an unknown and carefully concealed
past he had lived in gentle and scholarly surroundings, and the
reflection of it was on his manners, his acts, and on the
features that so easily shifted from high gayety to most bitter
cynicism. "I drink, boys, to beauty, to talent, to the eternal
flame that is woman&mdash;to Lola Monterey!"</p>

<p>Both Niland and Steers looked a little anxiously at the
unsmiling Denver. But he nodded his head. "As usual, Cal, you get
closer to the actual truth than any man I ever knew. You have
described Lola. She is just that."</p>

<p>Cal put down his glass and laid an arm on Denver's shoulder.
"And what good does truth do pie, or fine talk? You spoil the
game for all of us, Dave. She sent me here. She wants to see
you."</p>

<p>Denver's eyes smiled. "And that is a command."</p>

<p>"Association meetin' in a few minutes," grumbled Niland,
frowning at Steele.</p>

<p>"I'll see you there," said Denver and went out. Niland spoke
his mind to Steele. "Been better if you hadn't brought such a
message. Dave ain't the man to cool his feet in Lola's string.
They ain't the same kind of people at all."</p>

<p>But Cal Steele shook his head thoughtfully. "I know Lola.
She's my kind. Up in the clouds, down in the mud, never still,
never happy, easy angered, easy hurt. And"&mdash;he looked
up&mdash;"though she is the most selfish woman in the world, she
would give her life for a man she wanted to love. Sounds a little
odd, doesn't it, boys? I know. She's my kind. And I happen to
know she wants Dave."</p>

<p>"Get out," snorted Steve.</p>

<p>"She told you?" asked Niland skeptically.</p>

<p>"I'm not blind," murmured Cal Steele, face darkly shadowed.
"Though I wish I were sometimes. I want her myself. Damned funny,
isn't it? Let's drink to Dave and Lola."</p>

<p>Some of the more impatient ranchers were already aiming for
the opera house, which had been designated as the meeting place
for the Association, when David Denver swung toward the hotel. He
heard one of them say rather angrily, "I don't give a damn who it
is or how strong his wild bunch may be, we've got to stop it.
There's too many people riding around in the dark. If they ain't
disposed to sleep at night, then, by the eternal, we'd better
give 'em somethin' that'll induce a permanent sleep." But this
party seemed the only talkative one; the others were moodily
silent, saving their words for formal delivery. Denver's glance
swept Sundown slowly and deliberately as he advanced, and his
mind registered this and that detail with a photographic
distinctness that would, in moments of leisure, serve to help him
build up his shrewd judgment of people and events. Stinger Dann
had taken post against a wall of the Palace, shaded by the
overhanging gallery. By the stable the Ysabel Junction stage was
making up for a return trip. Eve Leverage stepped boyishly out of
a dry-goods store and smiled at the world. Denver went into the
hotel and climbed the stairs with a cloudy restlessness on his
cheeks. Swinging down the hall he paused at Number One&mdash;the
best room of the house&mdash;and heard Lola humming huskily
inside. For one long interval he stared at the floor; then
knocked. The humming stopped, the girl's voice rose with an
eager, throaty "come in." Denver pushed the door before him,
stepped through, and closed it.</p>

<p>He could not realize as he paused there, studying her with
half a frown, rebellious hair tousled on his head, and a somber
flare of emotion in the deep wells of his eyes, that he was the
exact and unchanged picture of the man she had carried with her
for three years; nor could he know that his blunt, "Here I am,
Lola," was the exact phrase she felt David Denver would greet her
with. But he did know that the old-time belle of the Palace had
become a mature beauty. She stood in the center of the room, fine
lacework clinging to her breast, jet hair tied severely back, and
her lips pursed upon a smile or a cry. A mature beauty, yet still
the same vital Lola Monterey, still with a queer, unfathomed glow
in those eyes dusted with velvet coloring. She tipped her chin,
laughed softly, and then caught her lip between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Here you are, David. You were scowling when I went away. You
are scowling now. Is that all you have for me?"</p>

<p>"I suppose other men have told you that you're beautiful,
Lola?"</p>

<p>"I suppose. But I have never listened to men as I listen to
you. You know that."</p>

<p>"Then I'll say it. Something's rounded you out. There's
something inside that body of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Misery, maybe. They say it is good for people." She came over
to him, brushed her finger tips across her own mouth and placed
them on Denver's cheeks. "From me to you. That is my
welcome&mdash;as I think you know it would always be. I have
heard a thousand gallant speeches from men whose gallantry I
doubted. It is good to know one man I never have to
doubt&mdash;and wouldn't doubt even if I had reason. Come, sit
down." She put an arm through his elbow and led him to a chair,
then crossed and sat facing him.</p>

<p>"You have not changed," she went on swiftly. "And I'm
glad&mdash;and sorry."</p>

<p>His face cleared and a piece of a smile came to his eyes.
"That sounds just like you."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it nice to come home and find the same landmarks?
That makes me happy. But you are still stormy, still unhappy,
still savage with yourself. That makes me sad."</p>

<p>"Let's talk about you for a change, Lola."</p>

<p>She shook her slim head so vigorously that the jade earrings
danced against the satin of her skin. "Let other men talk about
me. You and I&mdash;we will talk about you. You know about
me&mdash;all about me. There is nothing to add for these three
years. I am still that hungry little girl of the Palace whose
body never grew up to her temper. You have prospered, David?"</p>

<p>"The ranch has grown," he admitted.</p>

<p>"You have a big ranch house now, facing down Starlight
Canyon&mdash;and you sit on the porch at night and look across
the prairie, alone."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" demanded Denver.</p>

<p>"I made Cal Steele tell me everything that had happened to you
in three years. I know about that scar on your cheek, I know
about the arm you broke, the battles you have fought. So I have
the history of David Denver, cattleman, gentleman. From poor Cal,
who wanted to talk of himself and me."</p>

<p>"Cal," said Denver, "is the best friend I ever hope to have.
He's in love with you, Lola. You couldn't find a better
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her swift smile interrupted him. "You will not get rid of me
that easy, David!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the old temper returned to him. His big hands closed.
"Why did you run away, Lola?"</p>

<p>The answer came swift and straight. "Because I loved you too
much!"</p>

<p>"Then why in God's name have you returned?"</p>

<p>"Because," said she just above a whisper, "because I loved you
too much."</p>

<p>"We were better off apart. All the struggle and
misery&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instantly she was fire and flame. "Don't I know? You were born
to hurt me. You always will. And I will always try to find a
smile in your unhappy eyes! Always, even when you have cut my
pride to pieces! I am just a beggar, asking for something I think
I never will get! Lola Monterey doing that! David, my dear,
there's no woman born who will ever be able to hold you. No woman
will ever be able to smooth away that sadness and bitterness.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>She caught her breath and watched him. He said nothing; only
looked steadily back to her.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but I have been able to make you forget yourself and
think of me, just for little spells of time. I can lift you to
me, make you smile. That is enough for me&mdash;it is more than
another woman has done. You see&mdash;I still hope."</p>

<p>He rose, speaking gently. "I reckon I'd cut off my arm rather
than hear you say that. You've got beyond Sundown now, Lola.
Tonight you'll play for us. Tomorrow you'll be gone. And that
will be the end, for us. I'll not be seeing you again. I remember
Lola Monterey of the Palace, and I don't think I want to see Lola
Monterey of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will be there tonight, David," she broke in softly. "I
know you better."</p>

<p>"If so, I'll not be near enough to say goodbye. So I'll say it
now."</p>

<p>But she shook her head. "No. Tonight I sing. Tomorrow the
company goes on without me. I am staying here, David. I have
thought about it for a year. It is arranged. I think I might go
higher still in my work. I love it. But I love something else
better, and so Sundown is home for me again."</p>

<p>"You are making a mistake."</p>

<p>She came toward the door and touched his arm with the tip of
her fingers. "I am always making them, David. I always will.
Didn't I say I was a beggar? Beggars cannot be choosers. When I
am hurt, which is so often, I must smile and think that I came
from nothing and should be glad. Who wants to see Lola Monterey
crying? But I often wonder what happiness is like. Perhaps some
day I shall know, perhaps not. Now go along. And, tonight, when
you hear me sing, remember that I sing to you."</p>

<p>The gentle pressure of her fingers put him in the hall. He had
a glimpse of her velvet eyes, round and shining, and then the
door closed, and he walked heavily down the stairs to the street.
Somebody spoke to him. Colonel Fear Langdell dropped in step,
talking crisply. "Let's get the ball rolling. I have been waiting
around for you. Expect you to influence a great many of the weak
hearted, Dave. In fact, I expect you to take the leadership in a
disagreeable chore. Men will ride for you who wouldn't ride for
anybody else."</p>

<p>The two passed into the opera house, and thus engaged Denver
failed to see Eve Leverage pass in a rig driven by Joe Peake. But
Eve had seen him come out of the hotel just as she had seen him
go in previously. And she knew where he had spent the intervening
minutes. Sitting very straight and sober beside Peake, she stared
bleakly across the sloping hills, saying to herself over and over
again, "That old story about them is true. It is true, all of it.
But what difference does it make? I don't care&mdash;I don't
care! I can't find fault with David!"</p>

<p>There were about sixty men in the opera house, part of them
owners, part of them foremen, and a few belonging to the more
responsible trading element of Sundown. Niland and Steele and
Steers were sitting together, and as Denver took a seat beside
them Niland bent a rather ironic glance at him. "The vested
interests of this county," he whispered cynically, "are on their
ears. Bet you ten dollars Langdell mentions the sacred rights of
the Constitution and the sanctity of property." Dave Denver
nodded and swept the assembled men gravely. They were not talking
much; they were sitting rather stiffly upright, jaws set and arms
folded. This was the attitude of people who already had settled
their minds and arrived at conclusions. Denver knew that no
matter what argument developed and no matter what minority
opposition rose, the Association would come to but one decision.
That thought caused him to frown stubbornly. It was a part of his
lonely, rebellious nature to despise mass action. He hated the
manner in which the big cattlemen had so cannily and insistently
pressed their will on the rank and file, had brought pressure to
bear upon the smaller owners, had circulated rumors and hair-
raising tales about outlawry until the whole region, from Sky
Peak to the Rim and from Ysabel Flats to the Mogul Hills was
astir with fear and excitement. His dominant individualism
detested all this, and he stared unfavorably at Colonel Fear
Langdell as the latter rose on the stage and lifted a rather
imperious hand.</p>

<p>"This being a special meeting of the Association," said
Langdell in a cold clipped voice, "I suggest we dispense with
roll call and minutes."</p>

<p>The motion was put and passed. Al Niland moved restlessly and
grunted. He had crossed swords with Langdell, also a lawyer, in
court many times, and he had little love for the man. Langdell,
involved in all kinds of land deals and commercial enterprises,
never failed to represent the close conservatism of the county
and seldom let an opportunity pass to call Niland a firebrand.
Standing on the stage, stiff and spare and confident, Langdell
turned his sharp, shrewd face around the hall to build up an
expectant silence. Into this silence he placed his words like
sharp javelins.</p>

<p>"Perhaps as presiding officer I ought not assume the right of
expressing the purpose of this meeting. But I feel we are all
conscious that the sense of the meeting is to come immediately to
one question and settle it for once and all. And I shall take the
liberty of saying that question is&mdash;what are we going to do
about the damnable and increasingly arrogant banditry of the
crooked elements that infest Yellow Hill County? For two years we
have sat still and let outlawry grow under the false sentiment
that every man is entitled to his fling before settlin' down. I
say false sentiment because those kind of men never settle down.
Property is property whether fixed in a building or moving on
hoof. The owner's right is absolute and never should be violated.
What is the record for the past two years? Four men shot down,
approximately a thousand head of stock lost, banditry organized,
and every trail and stage road in the county made unsafe for
peaceable riders. There have been three stage hold-ups and one
driver murdered because he had the guts to resist, and I say we
ought to build a monument to that kind of a fellow. Instead of
that, what do we do? We catch a few isolated rustlers, a
sentimental jury tries them and lets them out to rustle again.
Well, what are we going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"He forgot the Constitution," whispered Niland humorously. Cal
Steele slumped in his seat with closed eyes and a faint boredom
on his face. Fleabite Wilgus, enormously wealthy operator of the
Gate ranch, was on his feet and talking in a whining voice few
could hear. Threadbare and dirty, he appeared to worse advantage
than the most shiftless rider around Sundown. One of his phrases
reached through the room.</p>

<p>"I'm a kindly man, as everybody knows. But if I had my way I'd
give no shrift to a caught rustler, and I wouldn't waste the time
of bringin' him to jail. That's me."</p>

<p>Steve Steers leaned indignantly forward and muttered. "Kindly,
is he? Say, I worked on his spread a week and I wouldn't repeat
for all the money on God's footstool. Actually, he counted out
the sugar for the table and fired one cook for cookin' three
slices extra bacon."</p>

<p>"My boy," said Niland sardonically, "you don't understand the
humble duty of a wealthy man toward his wealth. It's a sacred
trust."</p>

<p>Leverage was up and wasting no words. Everybody liked Leverage
and listened carefully. "When I was twenty years younger in this
country we didn't have any law, and we did have a pack of trouble
makers. There was just one way of gettin' at the solution, which
was rope and gun. I'm frank to say I didn't much like it, for
some fairly good men got strung up with the bad ones, and I was
mighty glad to see the legal way come to Yellow Hill. I still
prefer the legal way&mdash;when it works. But it don't seem to be
workin' very good now, and it hasn't for some time. I cast no
reflections on judges or law officers, but I'm frank to say there
always seems to be one man on a jury who'll hang it and I've got
my own private opinions as to how that occurs. So, since
influences outside the law get around justice, my belief is that
influences outside the law must bring justice back. In case that
ain't plain enough, I mean vigilantes!"</p>

<p>There was a sharp and instant applause. Somebody yelled, "And
hangin' on the spot of capture!"</p>

<p>Leverage looked thoughtful. "I suppose so. I dislike takin'
life thataway. But one or two heavy doses of medicine will go a
long way toward doin' away with the necessity of a ridin'
committee. After that, let us confine our job to catchin' and
provin' a rustler guilty, and let the court pronounce
sentence."</p>

<p>Fee, of the Flying F spoke briefly. Short-ridge, another large
owner, was just as brief but a great deal more vehement. Then
there was a lull in which Fear Langdell waited for further war
talk. Denver realized that Langdell expected some fighting speech
that would weld everybody together and actually put the vigilante
proposal into enthusiastic commission. Leverage, by his slight
touch of reasonable hesitancy, had just missed setting off the
spark, and the increasing delay served somehow to dampen the
meeting. Langdell looked about to find the proper man. His eyes
lighted on Denver.</p>

<p>"Dave, you've been silent a long while. Get up and say your
mind."</p>

<p>"I'm listenin'," drawled Denver.</p>

<p>"Let others do the listenin'," countered Langdell impatiently.
"We expect you to talk."</p>

<p>Denver rose, feeling the eyes of his three partners boring
into him curiously. Niland had turned nervous, and Steve Steers
hitched forward; but Cal Steele had a queerly set cast to his
cheeks and had dropped his pose of sleepiness.</p>

<p>"Maybe you expect me to talk," stated Denver coolly, "but you
can't expect me to follow the piper. I'm not built that way.
Granting most of your bear talk to be true, and granting the
necessity for fighting back, I'm sorry to say I can't see this
vigilante stuff and won't be a party to it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" snapped Langdell angrily.</p>

<p>"If a man rustled me," went on Dave, "I'd personally go out
and hunt him, and I'd personally settle the account. I wouldn't
ask anybody else to do it. I wouldn't shove such a chore on the
shoulders of a whole community. I wouldn't ask another man to be
my catspaw, and I'm damned if I'll be catspaw for a few men who
are well able to keep their own range clean."</p>

<p>"Afraid of lead, uh?" demanded Langdell sarcastically.</p>

<p>"You know my record better," said Dave softly, "and I take
exception to the remark. Are you willing to stand accountable for
it, Colonel Langdell?"</p>

<p>The drawling question fell flatly across the utter silence.
Rather abruptly Langdell made amends. "I did not mean that
personally, Denver. But you make a mistake. This is not a one-man
affair. The whole country is interested."</p>

<p>"I'm not. None of my beefs been borrowed. For that matter,
nobody within ten miles of Sundown's been bothered. The night
ridin' so far is all across Sky Peak. Why don't the gentlemen
yonder do their own hangin'? I say I don't understand all the
steam and smoke certain parties have been throwin' out lately.
This vigilante business is too dangerous. Ridin' committees never
know when to quit, and they don't always use good judgment. I'll
admit the stage robberies hit nearer home&mdash;but that is
distinctly a matter for the sheriff. And if the present one
doesn't work, why not get another? That's also a matter that gets
me to wonderin'."</p>

<p>A voice from the back of the room boomed out. "By God, I don't
know as I'll accept them remarks, Denver!"</p>

<p>It was the sheriff, Magnus Ortez. Denver turned to him.
"You're a public official and open to public discussion, Ortez.
And I never make a remark I'm not willing to stand by."</p>

<p>He had touched off the long-suppressed anger of the aggrieved
ranchers and the warlike ones. The opera house began to sing with
the rising clamor. Here and there Denver saw men who sat still
and refused to join, but he felt he had played into Langdell's
hand unconsciously, had served as a whip. Langdell was tightly
triumphant and shouted another question:</p>

<p>"You believe in coddlin' these outlaws, uh? You believe in
lettin' crookedness get by?"</p>

<p>"I believe in mindin' my own business until other people won't
let me. I run my affairs. Let others do the same. As for crooks,
that's an open question. Quite a few very respectable citizens in
the West made their strictly honest fortune out of a half-dozen
stray cattle. I don't consider myself any fit judge of honesty.
Put up a million dollars for the man able to take it&mdash;and
who will be so damned honest then? You wanted to hear me
talk&mdash;and you got your wish."</p>

<p>"I move," shouted a voice, "we establish a vigilante committee
and name a leader who is to choose his own men, work in his own
way, and receive our full sanction and support!"</p>

<p>"Second!"</p>

<p>"Vote it!"</p>

<p>They rose to vote. Denver and his three partners kept their
seats: Steers a little awkward but absolutely loyal to Denver;
Niland contemptuous of the whole affair; Cal Steele with his eyes
closed and his face entirely passive. Niland muttered, "They are
as crazy as loons!"</p>

<p>"Passed!" shouted Langdell. "And I make this motion, even if
it is not my place to do so! I move Jake Leverage to be ridin'
boss of the vigilantes with absolute authority and all our
resources to call on!"</p>

<p>"Vote it!"</p>

<p>Leverage's voice rose futilely against the rising tumult. The
Association, with at last a course of aggressiveness suggested,
let itself go.</p>

<p>"Stampede!" whooped Niland, grinning.</p>

<p>"Everything said about outlaws here today is right," muttered
Denver, "but there's something rotten about it, and I can't seem
to get straightened out. All I know is I'll be no party to
it."</p>

<p>Cal Steele opened his eyes and said briefly, "You're right,
Dave."</p>

<p>"I do what you boys do," affirmed Steers. "All the same to
me."</p>

<p>The clamor subsided. Leverage was on his feet. "I didn't ask
for this," he said. "I don't like the responsibility, either. But
I'm not the kind to bellyache and then lay down when my hand's
called. All I want to say is I'll go through to the best of my
ability, and I'll gather my men. I want your support. And I don't
want any of you fellows to be unfriendly with me, even if you
don't approve my course. I'll be as fair as I can."</p>

<p>"As fair as the pack will let him be," muttered Denver, and
turned out of the hall. "I hate to see old Jake Leverage the
goat," he told the others when they came abreast of him.</p>

<p>An elderly man hurried up and spoke quietly to Denver. "I'd of
gone in if you had," said he. "But you changed my mind, as well
as a few others. So just remember, you've got support."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Denver and studied the street.</p>

<p>Stinger Dann still stood under the Palace gallery, sullen and
indifferent. The sight of him roused Denver's thoughts to a
different angle, and he began to look more carefully about him.
There was a strange rider loitering by the blacksmith shop, and
another man he knew only by reputation posted at Grogan's. The
arrangement of the three drew his brows together.</p>

<p>"I think it's time for a drink," suggested Niland.</p>

<p>Cal Steele roused himself from his distrait moodiness. "Any
time's time for a drink."</p>

<p>Meems and Wango were conferring earnestly at the entrance to
Grogan's, and Meems winked heavily at Denver. "It ain't possible,
it ain't even natural, but the fact remains, nev'less."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Denver, "I'll bite. What is it?"</p>

<p>"That Englishman's got a name that's the original stem-winder
of all monickers I ever heard. It takes two to git a bit on it.
Ready, Pete?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh, shoot!"</p>

<p>Meems drew a deep breath. "Almaric&mdash;"</p>

<p>"St. Jennifer&mdash;" lisped Wango in turn.</p>

<p>"Crvecoeur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nightingale!"</p>

<p>Cal Steele repeated it rather gently to himself. "Almaric St.
Jennifer Crvecoeur Nightingale. His father and mother loved him.
Where'd you find out, Buck?"</p>

<p>"It's on the hotel register," asseverated Meems. "Took two
lines to get it all in."</p>

<p>"I think," crooned Cal Steele, "we shall have to conduct a
surgical operation on that name and get it down to homely Western
proportions. He may stay with us a while, and I doubt if Sundown
could clamp its jaws around the original." He closed his eyes a
moment, smiling faintly. "Yes, indeed. The inevitable contraction
would be&mdash;Jenny's Nighty."</p>

<p>The group howled. Denver chuckled and looked up at the mention
of his name. Dr. Williamson drew alongside the walk with his
buckboard. "Dave, you going toward your ranch pretty soon?"</p>

<p>"I thought I might stay over here tonight," replied Denver.
"But if there's anything you want just ask it."</p>

<p>The doctor, weathered and lined with the years of his service,
took a decent chew of tobacco. "Well, one of Fee's riders was
coming along Copperhead River and saw old man Jesson across the
stream. Jesson spelled 'doctor' in the air with his hands, the
river makin' too much noise to hear a thing. So the rider came
right to me. I calculate it's Jesson's wife needing me. It's
about time. Copperhead's pretty high, and I might not be able to
ford it, but I don't want to waste time by taking the twenty-mile
detour to the bridge. If I could get some help I
might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right with you," said Denver, and motioned for Steve Steers.
"Let's sift. We'll be back in time for the show."</p>

<p>Together they crossed to the stable for their horses and then
followed Doc Williamson down Prairie Street to the rolling ridges
beyond. Denver looked back once. Stinger Dann was staring at him.
The two others&mdash;those Denver had noticed stationed by the
stable and Grogan's&mdash;were drifting toward the gunman. Some
sort of signal passed between the three. Then they disappeared
into the Palace.</p>

<p>"Layin' for somebody," mused Denver. His jaws hardened.
"Possibly me. They shall have their chance tonight."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE ROARING
COPPERHEAD</h2>

<p class="first">PRAIRIE STREET emerged from Sundown and became
the Ysabel Junction stage road winding south to the steel ribbon
that made a dividing line between the rolling contours of Yellow
Hill County and the open immensity of the lower prairies. Also in
that direction, leagues ahead, was the state capital; Sundowners
occasionally visited the capital and came back with the feeling
they had been on a long journey, such being the isolation of the
land. The stage road, already turning to powdered dust from the
early spring sunshine, had not been fashioned by men who cared
much for easy grades; it went straightaway up the slopes and
coasted directly down into the numerous little valleys. Where so
bold an attack was impossible, it zigzagged weirdly along cliff
faces or shot around high rock points. But always it took the
short way in preference to the easy one, a matter-of-fact
reminder that here horses were cheaper than time.</p>

<p>Dr. Williamson knew his country very well after thirty years
of practice in it. Sitting taciturnly in the buggy seat, coat
tails flapping, he put the team to a stiff trot and covered the
distance. About five miles from town he abandoned the stage road
for a stock trail that wavered up along the backbone of a pine-
studded ridge; this threatened to peter out presently, but the
good doctor only took another morsel of tobacco and drove ahead.
A windfall lay across the way; he looked sharply to either side
for an alternative trail and, failing to find it, whipped the
horses over the obstruction, buggy springing violently. Ahead was
a steep climb. Without comment Denver spurred beside the rig,
shook his loop over an angle iron on the dashboard, and towed the
vehicle to the crest. From this eminence many small valleys and
holes were to be seen puckered between the rising ridges. Cattle
grazed along the lush areas, a line cabin stood here and there,
and far below a patch of river surface flashed in the afternoon
sun. There was no distinct trail downward, but the trees were
thin and the ground open. Denver dropped back, rope still holding
the buggy, to act as a drag, and the doctor drove down with a
sort of reckless wisdom, choosing his openings on the run,
vehicle teetering and hubs scraping against tree trunks.
Presently a road shot around the hill, and the doctor took it.
Denver cast off; the party set ahead on the run. Copperhead River
and Copperhead Valley lay below, and in five more minutes of
headlong driving Dr. Williamson drew up to the very margin of the
water and stepped stiffly down. Across the river was a cabin, and
out on the bank a man moved back and forth, wringing his hands.
"It's Miz Jesson, all right," grunted the doctor. "I told her a
month ago she ought to move into Sundown for this event."</p>

<p>"River's a little wild," said Denver dubiously.</p>

<p>"So the Fee man told me," observed Williamson. "But the
detour's too long. I'd be too late. There's a baby bein' born
yonder, and we got to cross."</p>

<p>"That's different," was Denver's laconic reply. He ran his
eyes along the turbulent stream. Normally this particular spot
was a safe and shallow ford with sloping sandy sides. Today the
Copperhead, swollen by rain and melting snow, came charging out
of its upper gorges and threw itself turbulently across what once
had been a slack area. Even as they watched, the teeth of the
current bit out vast chunks of the bank and swept them down.
Jesson was apparently shouting at the top of his voice and making
no impression against the sheering, crackling sound of the
current.</p>

<p>"Damned if I see how it's any different," was Steve Steers's
gloomy thought. "It ain't fordable."</p>

<p>Denver's attention stopped at a cottonwood beside him. "If we
could tie a rope to one of the upper branches of that
tree&mdash;and get the rope yonder&mdash;you might be able to
slide to Jesson monkey fashion, Doc."</p>

<p>"Try it," said Williamson. "I carry fifty foot of rope in the
buggy."</p>

<p>Steve Steers got that piece and joined it to his own rope.
Denver made another tie with his. "That's about a hundred and
fifty feet to operate on."</p>

<p>"Why anchor this end clear up the tree?" questioned Steve.
"More solid down at the base."</p>

<p>"Got to keep it out of the water," said Denver. "Once the
current catches the bight of this line it'll jerk the eye teeth
out of the man that tries to hold it. Shin up."</p>

<p>Steve took an end of the combined rope, shinnied halfway up
the cottonwood, and made it stoutly secure. Denver, meanwhile,
had advanced to the water's edge and was coiling part of the free
end for a throw. Jesson waved his hands and stepped a few feet
into the river. Denver swung the loop mightily and let go. Jesson
jumped, but the line fell short and was whipped downstream.
Denver swore softly, wading farther from shore while Steve hauled
the rope back and handed it out to his partner. The lash of the
current curled around Denver's hips, and he rocked with the
impact. Jesson had advanced as far as he dared. Once again Denver
put his whole strength into the cast&mdash;and knew that he had
failed. Jesson stumbled and clawed for dry ground, shaking his
head like a crazy man. Steve hauled in the dripping rope and said
nothing. Denver got back to shore and stared across to the cabin
so near and still so unattainable. Misery lived in that cabin;
life flickered while the iron claw of nature pressed
destructively down. Once again Denver found himself fighting
against the primal, brute forces of the land as he had been doing
all the years, and once again the black temper of the man came
whipping across his face, and his violet eyes flared with the
morose desire to check and defeat that overwhelming, inevitable
power under the shadow of which all men walked. Burning sun,
blizzard, miring mud, snow-choked trails, thirst,
starvation&mdash;he had fought these things doggedly, and now he
found the same grim, impersonal enemy in front of him again,
shaped as a swollen river.</p>

<p>He swung up to his saddle and reached for the coil of rope.
"I'll try a little farther out," he told Steve.</p>

<p>"We're not gettin' much of anywhere. It's too long a
toss."</p>

<p>A rider came loping down the road, followed a short cut, and
advanced on the group. Steve muttered something under his breath,
but Denver nodded gravely. The newcomer was slim, willowy; a
black hat shaded a dark, triangular face&mdash;rather expressive
face with sleepy, watchful eyes. Those eyes took in the scene,
detail by detail. A pleasant voice drawled.</p>

<p>"Howdy, boys. What's the caper?"</p>

<p>"River to cross, Lou," said Denver and pushed his horse into
the stream. The animal bunched and halted. Denver set his spurs
and forced it on until the curling surface rose to the beast's
belly. Jesson was posted again. Denver canted his body to get a
long sweep into his throw, shot the rope high and swift, and felt
his mount lose footing. There was nothing to do but let the
animal have free head; it had been overbalanced by the current
and, fighting for a hold on the slippery gravel, it swung and
slowly slid down the stream. The current lifted it bodily, and
then, in the space of a moment, man and horse were so much
helpless drift in the angry flood.</p>

<p>"Easy now," muttered Denver and put a little pressure into one
knee. The horse responded, pointing its head toward the sliding
shore. Steve was racing abreast; the newcomer shot past, shaking
out his rope. Denver lifted one arm as a target for that throw,
but at the same instant a contrary boil of the river shunted his
mount circularly toward the bank. Denver felt the pony strike
bottom, slide, and get a surer grip. Cautiously he worked out of
it and reached land. The newcomer shook his head.</p>

<p>"Bad situation."</p>

<p>"Listen," grunted Steve, "use yore head. Once yuh get beyond
depth yuh might as well sing a hymn. We got to dope another way
of crossin' this drink."</p>

<p>"I'd offer to take a throw," put in the newcomer, "but if you
can't reach it I can't do any better."</p>

<p>"Comin' from you, Lou," remarked Denver, "that's
handsome."</p>

<p>"Just so. I hate to admit any man's better than me."</p>

<p>Denver rode back to the cottonwood and signaled Jesson. By
considerable wigwagging he conveyed the idea he wanted Jesson to
saddle a horse and bring it to the river; Jesson nodded and ran
back behind the cabin. Denver dismounted, removing his own
saddle.</p>

<p>"Now what?" asked Steve.</p>

<p>"Got another idea. I almost made that throw. Another five feet
and the thing's done."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" was Steve's skeptical reply. "Another five feet and
yore sunk. Don't consider it."</p>

<p>Denver studied the river. "There's an offsetting current right
above us. If a man rode into it he'd be carried out a
considerable distance&mdash;close enough to make a sure toss of
the rope."</p>

<p>Steve stared at his partner. The newcomer rode away to inspect
the possibilities. Steve cleared his throat. "Tell you what,
Dave. Yore throwin' arm is some weary. Supposin' I do the water-
walkin' act yuh got in mind."</p>

<p>"You climb up in that cottonwood and keep an eye on the
rope."</p>

<p>The newcomer rode back. "It'll carry you down the river pretty
fast, Dave."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll ride along the bank with a loop shook out."</p>

<p>"Obliged, Lou," said Denver and rode bareback to the spot he
intended embarking from. Steve paid out the line to him, and then
both he and the newcomer placed themselves in a position to hold
it from the water. Jesson rode hurriedly down from the cabin.
Denver signaled his purpose, and Jesson pantomimed his
understanding. He made his horse breast into the current and
turned it broadside to Denver, lifting both hands above his
head.</p>

<p>Denver built his loop, at the same time holding the shore end
as high as he could. Steve and the newcomer watched him with
fixed attention; Williamson's leather cheeks were gravely clamped
around a section of tobacco. Denver eased the horse into the
water and made it go straight forward until its belly touched.
Immediately the pressure of the current shot the beast beyond
footing and Denver, gripping with his knees, began to swing the
loop. The far shore shot past with queer rapidity, the pony began
to roll, and the man knew that when he made his last throw he
would be too far off balance ever to recover. Jesson's upraised
arm came abreast, the loop went like a bullet; Denver, plunging
into the stream to keep from dragging against the bight, saw
Jesson catch and snub the loop in frenzied haste. Then Denver
went down like a rock with a roar and a rumble in his ears.</p>

<p>When he came up, strangling out water, he saw his horse's head
bobbing in the distance. He saw, too, a blurred and panoramic
strip of shore and Lou Redmain spurring along it. After that some
resurgent wave slapped him in the face, upset his coolness, and
sent him down; and all he knew was that his arms and feet were
struggling aimlessly against the smother of the river. He broke
the surface a second time and fought to maintain himself, no
longer finding the shore. White spearheads reared jaggedly, his
breath was shut off. Something struck him on the temple;
instinctively he hooked an arm above his head, feeling a counter
current pressing him back. He thought Redmain had missed, and he
made the attempt to clear his head and at least coast on the
surface; but the same counter current that had stopped him now
rolled him over, and he descended into the queer night of
drowning. And it was with a very dim consciousness that he felt a
tightening around his body and a stiff pressure. Purely by reflex
he wound his arms about the rope; and so was hauled ashore.</p>

<p>He was not out, but Williamson had him straddled and was
pressing the water of the Copperhead from his lungs. Presently
the hunger for air left, and he drew a full breath. Williamson
stood up. "All right, Dave. You did your job, now I'll do
mine."</p>

<p>"Think you can wangle acrost on that rope, Doc?" Steve Steers
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I'm seventy years old," stated Williamson, "and I've done
everything but the tight-rope act. I guess I'm not too old to do
that. But I'm damned if I'll come back the same way. I'll ride
one of Jesson's horses around by the bridge. Dave, you take my
team and buggy to your place, and I'll pick it up later."</p>

<p>While talking he had somehow lashed his pill bag to his chest.
Getting on his feet, Denver looked across the river. Jesson had
backed his horse from the water and, by paying out the rope, had
swung to a higher section of the shore. Thus, if the tension was
maintained, Williamson could cross dry. The doctor climbed in
front of Lou Redmain; the latter rode out into the river
underneath the rope. Williamson stood up, grasped the rope and
swung clear, feet and arms wrapped around it.</p>

<p>"I bet," said Steve Steers nervously, "he wishes he was closer
to his monkey ancestors."</p>

<p>Williamson, swinging beneath the rope, moved rapidly and by
degrees reached midstream. At this point the line let him down
until his pendant coat tails skipped on the surface of the racing
Copperhead. Jesson, keeping the far end snubbed around his saddle
horn, apparently did not dare to place too great a strain on the
rope; and he seemed to have some little trouble in holding his
horse steady. Williamson halted, advanced a few feet beyond the
middle point, and seemed to tire. So he stopped again while the
three watchers on the west shore stood profoundly silent. Then
the doctor crawled on, foot at a time, passed the most dangerous
spot and elected to drop down in the shallow edge of the river
rather than haul himself all the way to the high bank. He waded
ashore and without stopping ran into the cabin.</p>

<p>Lou Redmain reached for his cigarette papers, casting a short,
bright glance at Denver. "Doc," he muttered, "is all right."</p>

<p>"They ought to name the kid after him," stated Steve
solemnly.</p>

<p>Denver chuckled. "Half the kids in Yellow Hill are named after
him already."</p>

<p>"What is his first name, anyhow?" asked Steve.</p>

<p>"Stephen Burt Williamson."</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Steve. "Hell, them names is my names!"</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Denver. "And the doc brought you into this vale
of tears, likewise."</p>

<p>"I be damned!"</p>

<p>Jesson cast off the rope, and it snaked into the current.
Steve hauled it in. Jesson was pointing toward the south, on his
own side of the river, and Denver, looking in that direction,
found his horse grazing a half mile down. Jesson made some more
Indian talk and rode after the pony. "I'd figured it was fifty-
fifty with that brute," mused Denver. Lou Redmain idled, giving
Denver an opportunity to drawl his thanks. "I'm obliged. When
your loop hit me I'd took in about all the liquid I was able to
stand."</p>

<p>"Always glad to give you a hand," said Redmain politely. "Or
Williamson."</p>

<p>Steve wandered off to the buggy. Denver watched Redmain's face
when he put his sudden question. "Not toyin' to pry into your
affairs, Lou, but Stinger Dann's in Sundown this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Redmain enigmatically, "I sent him there.
Or perhaps he went of his own accord."</p>

<p>"He seems to be nursin' a grudge," went on Denver.</p>

<p>"I never knew him to be without one," said Redmain, lip
curling.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering," drawled Denver, "if he happened to be
pointed my way."</p>

<p>"I haven't put him on your trail," Redmain was quick to
answer.</p>

<p>"That's all I wanted to know."</p>

<p>But Redmain pressed the point. "I've got no reason or desire
to cause you trouble, Dave. And if that damned fool is figurin'
to get on the prod I'll yank him back into the bushes."</p>

<p>"Let him have his fun," said Denver soberly. "He always has
considered me to be his brand of poison, and it'd be just as well
to let him try his hand. I don't like to watch men circle around
me."</p>

<p>"He'll make no play against you," stated Redmain flatly. "In
the first place, he's got to do what I tell him. In the second
place, he's useful to me and I don't want him shot up."</p>

<p>"Yeah," mused Denver, "I always felt you regarded him as a
right bower."</p>

<p>Redmain gathered his reins. "Got to be traveling. By the way,
is that opera outfit in town?"</p>

<p>"Lola's there," said Denver quietly, "which is what you wanted
to know."</p>

<p>For a moment a dark, wild flash of emotion flamed in Redmain's
eyes, and the narrow face became taut and pale around the
nostrils: here was a killer, a man without compassion or
conscience emerging swiftly from a deceptive shell of manners.
But with equal swiftness Redmain recovered himself and stared
inscrutably down at Denver. Then he whirled and raced away from
the river, pony hoofs making a rapid tattoo over the ground.
Steve had mounted. Denver threw his saddle into the buggy, took
the seat, and started off. Together the partners angled into the
higher land. Purple crusted shadows folded about the ridges; the
team's clatter rang far along the still ravines. Night settled
down, bringing with it the pervading loneliness and mystery of a
country yet untamed.</p>

<p>This was a busy season of the year, but Denver earlier in the
day had given the crew leave to hit Sundown for the show and its
pursuant revelry. So when he drew into the long avenue of poplars
and came by the bunkhouse he found a strangely unnatural
stillness pervading home quarters. The crew had eaten beforehand
and departed, leaving behind only those recluse spirits who
seemed to enjoy solitude. One of these stopped his fiddle in the
dead center of a weird harmony and came out to take over the
team. Lights winked from the main-house, water bubbled
melodiously from a spring pipe, and the spiced scent of the hills
swirled across the yard. Denver left an order with the hand.</p>

<p>"My saddle's back of the buggy. Slap it on that gray gelding,
Shad."</p>

<p>Going to the house, Denver and Steve ate a quick snack; then
Steve stretched himself in a front-room chair while Denver shaved
and changed clothes. Rather facetiously the sandy-haired puncher
hailed the transformation.</p>

<p>"Doggone it, Dave, yore beginnin' to drift out of my class.
When a man barbecues his whiskers every day he ain't common folks
no more."</p>

<p>"Fellow ought to show a clean face at the opera house,
shouldn't he? You going?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm driftin' back to Sundown," opined Steve, "but I
ain't goin' to the show. Not by a jugful. Debbie would raise a
ruckus if she heard."</p>

<p>Denver chuckled over a cigarette. "For an engaged man you sure
take life serious. Why not wait until you get married before
assumin' this pallbearin' atmosphere?"</p>

<p>Steve's lazy, quizzical features were puckered solemnly. "You
don't know nothin' about it. When a man's married he knows where
he stands. The judge has thrown the book at him, the knot's tied,
and there ain't any question about it. Which I mean when a
fellow's married he's plumb arrived somewhere. But this
engagement business, what is it, anyhow? You ain't one thing and
you ain't another. One minute yore hot as hell, and the next
minute yore cold all over. You dunno what to say, what to do, or
how to act. Dave, it's awful."</p>

<p>"When's the ceremony going to be?"</p>

<p>"Hah!" snorted the perplexed Steve. "There's another item. How
in hell do I know? Listen, you got a great experience Comin' to
yuh, Dave. Before you pop the question yore high card. Nothin's
too good. You sit in the best parlor chair, the old man hands out
his best cigars, and the lady leans on yore arm as if she
couldn't do without yore big, handsome carcass. But
afterward&mdash;then what? All of a sudden you ain't nothin' but
a future husband. The girl gets a far-off cast to her eyes and
considers clothes and etiquette and such stuff; the old man
considers the expenses and don't pass out no more cigars. The
parlor chair's sent back to the attic, and nobody's got time to
talk to yuh atall. I don't know nothin' about it. I suppose I'll
get a notice some day to appear at such and such a church for the
event&mdash;and otherwise I'm just hangin' out on a limb waitin'
to be sawed down."</p>

<p>Denver spoke rather gently at his partner. "I wouldn't want
you to think I was casting any cold water on matrimony, and I
think Debbie Lunt's a fine girl. But I recall when you and I used
to ride fifty miles to a dance and have a pretty sizable time.
Also I recall the occasion when you and I switched all the teams
at Fee's barn raisin'. You seem to have lost some starch lately,
Steve."</p>

<p>"I ain't had an idea of my own since I proposed," reflected
Steve, weltering in gloom. "I thought that was sure a bright idea
at the time. I ain't so sure any more."</p>

<p>"Then why get married?" grunted Denver.</p>

<p>"Well, I figgers it out this way. How will life be thirty
years from now with Debbie? Terrible&mdash;awful. I shudders to
think of it. A bath every week, no smokin' in the house, no
liquor, no poker, no roamin'. No nothin'. It'll be, come here,
Steve, and go there, Steve, and, Steve, mind the mud on yore
shoes. Likewise, Steve, put a muffler on yore neck against the
cold and, Steve, dear, I will take care of yore month's pay, so
shell it over and don't bat them eyes on me like that. Oh, my
Gawd!"</p>

<p>"If that's the way you feel," stated Denver, "why not bunch
the proposition?"</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Steve, "I figgers that thisaway. How will life
be thirty years from now if I ain't got her? Hell, Dave, there
ain't any other woman who wants me. I'd be a single galoot.
Batchin' in a shanty full of holes. Mendin' my own socks and
cookin' my own beans. Nobody to talk to and nobody who gives a
damn what happens to me. Bein' old and useless without a fambly
is shore a sorrowful thing. So I considers. I shudders to think
of bein' married to Debbie and I shudders to consider I'll lose
her. Upon mature reflection I calculate I shudder hardest when I
think of losin' her. Therefore, marriage is the ticket."</p>

<p>"Ought to be glad you got it fought to a standstill," offered
Denver dryly.</p>

<p>"Yeah," muttered Steve and stared across the room. There was
an enormous lack of enthusiasm in his answer, a kind of mortal
weariness. "Oh, yeah. Uhuh."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Denver, leading out. They got their horses
and turned back on the trail. Beyond the poplars Denver stopped.
"Listen, I sort of want to get a little information for my own
personal use. Let's split here. You take the short way into town.
I'll go round by the toe of Starlight."</p>

<p>Steve Steers was alert. "Lookin' for anybody in
particular?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'd like to know if the population of Yellow Hill
County is shiftin' across the Copperhead tonight. Stinger Dann
has sort of put a bug in my bonnet."</p>

<p>"It's an idea," mused Steve, "and might bear fruit."</p>

<p>"Said fruit, if any, is for our own nourishment exclusively,"
warned Dave.</p>

<p>"I heard yuh the first time," stated Steve. "Let's slope. And
better hurry, or yuh won't get to show that shave."</p>

<p>He spurred on down the trail. Denver cut around his ranch
quarters, ascended a stiff pathway, and plunged into the sudden
gloom of a pine belt. The lights from D Slash winked and were cut
off; the pines spread away before an upland meadow swimming with
fog, and this tilted into a narrow ravine that struck straight
for leveler land to the south. Denver, with a comparatively free
trail in front, urged a more rapid pace.</p>

<p>As he traveled he reviewed the affair at Copperhead crossing.
Ever since that remote boyhood day when he became conscious for
the first time that the placid world held a thousand threats he
had been fighting savagely against the dominant elements. His
whole life had been fashioned and tempered by these struggles and
so now in manhood David Denver looked on the wild forces of
nature as a pagan would, endowing these forces almost with living
personalities. He had been fighting them too long to regard them
any other way. Thus he felt a grim sort of satisfaction in
knowing that he had whipped the river and won another engagement
in that everlasting skirmish with the earth. Yet when he
considered that but for the swift accuracy of Lou Redmain's
lariat he would now be nothing more than a bit of senseless
rubbish rolling along the turbid stream, all the rebellious
instincts in him rose up, and he scowled at the night.</p>

<p>"No man can survive a thousand chances," he thought to
himself, "and I've taken a great many already. Some day this
country will get me. Like it got my dad. Like it's got others. I
reckon I'll always be battling, and one of these times my foot is
going to slip. When that happens I'm gone."</p>

<p>But he knew he would never quit, never fail to throw his
strength into the contest.</p>

<p>He galloped down the incline with a slumbering shoulder of
Starlight Canyon on his left. The stage road came sweeping past,
and he turned into it, the gray gelding stretching out to a long
free gallop. Below and beyond the prairie lay like a calm ocean,
surface overlain with the misting fog. There was a moon somewhere
above, but its pale light refracting against the heaving banks of
atmosphere made only a shimmering corona that revealed nothing.
The thick air cut through his shirt, and all the dampened incense
of the countryside slid sluggishly across the highway. A coyote
barked, and away below the road the bell of some homesteader's
milk cow tinkled. Unconsciously Dave Denver's mood softened under
the spell of a world fermenting with new life.</p>

<p>He crossed an open bridge, the boom of his pony's shod hoofs
echoing away. Down a long and level grade he traveled, and up
another rise. At the throat of some dim gully he stopped,
dismounted, and applied a match to the wet side trail. But it was
blank of riding signs, and he went on; past Dead Axle Hill, along
the hairpin descent into Sundown Valley, and beside the
foreboding wall of Shoshone Dome. Somewhere in the distance he
caught the tremor of hasting riders; instantly he left the road
and paused in a black crevice of the dome. The sound swelled out
of the western side of the valley and suddenly dropped off.</p>

<p>"Comin' through the soft meadow stretch," he decided.</p>

<p>Presently the party achieved the sharper underfooting of the
road and swept forward. Denver leaned over and placed his hand
across the gelding's muzzle. Shadow and shadow flashed by, a bare
twenty feet removed; silent shadows riding two abreast and
swaying with the speed of their passage. Fire glinted from a
flailing hoof, and then these nocturnal birds of passage had
melted into the distance, and the reverberation was absorbed by
the vast night. Denver regained the road.</p>

<p>"They started from the Wells," he reflected, "not from
Sundown. And they're hell-bent for somewhere, as they usually
are. My guess was wrong. Redmain's already pulled them out of the
Sky Peak country. As always, when lightnin' strikes he's miles
away. A wise man if not a good one." So plunged in thought, he
let the gelding go and in a half hour picked up the lights of
Sundown. Music came from the opera house; the show already had
begun. He racked his horse in front of Grogan's and entered to
find Steve at the bar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; A GENTLEMAN'S
GAME</h2>

<p class="first">"NOTHIN'," said Steve softly.</p>

<p>"I had better luck," was Denver's rejoinder. Grogan himself,
an overbearing man with a spurious smile of good humor, came down
the bar, and Steve changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, go see the show, and what do I care? I'll play poker."
Then, remembering this was also one of those pastimes an engaged
man should not participate in, he hastily qualified. "I mean I
can spend a large evenin' lookin' on.</p>

<p>"It certainly sounds violent," jeered Denver and strolled out.
Instead of going directly across the street to the opera house,
he mixed rather casually with the tide of aimless punchers and so
was carried as far as the hotel porch. He stopped short of the
strong light coming out of that hostelry and stepped into the
mouth of an alley. A man drifted by, went up the hotel porch and
inside. Presently he came out and halted to light his cigarette;
by the glow of the match Denver saw puzzlement on the fellow's
features.</p>

<p>"I thought so," grunted Denver. "Same man that Stinger Dann
had posted by the stable this afternoon. Don't know him. Red-
main's got a lot of fresh blood in his band lately. Now what is
the present idea?"</p>

<p>The man crossed the street quickly and shouldered through the
crowd, dropping out of sight somewhere near the Palace. On
impulse Denver withdrew into obscurity, made a wide circle of
town, and crept through the back lots of the north side. He found
himself suddenly arrested by the half-open door of the opera
house; Lola Monterey was singing, and her tempestuous, throbbing
cadences swept away the years of her absence and brought him back
once more to the days when he had watched her dancing in the
Palace&mdash;a slim, scarlet figure cutting through the smoke
haze of the hall. Always, he recalled, there had been in her
songs something to remind him life was short and sad; always
there was that haunting appeal to stir him profoundly and the
direct glance of her dark, glowing eyes to set his own wild blood
racing.</p>

<p>Half angry, he drew himself away from the door. "Old times,
old ways. She's changed in some ways. She's no longer a hungry
little girl, half scared, half savage. She's fought her way up,
she's sure and confident&mdash;she's a matured woman. But her
heart is the same. Women like her never change that way."</p>

<p>A murmur of sound put all this introspection out of his head.
Somewhere in the farther blackness men were talking discreetly,
hurriedly. Rising on his toes Denver advanced, skirted the blind
wall of the Palace, paused beside the adjoining butcher shop, and
slid quietly near the last building in the north line. Below was
a harness shop; above was Colonel Fear Langdell's law office,
reached by an outside stairway. Boots scuffed against the steps.
There was more talk.</p>

<p>"...how in hell do I know?"</p>

<p>"Yuh ought to."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't. And there's apt to be a bullet in this for
somebody."</p>

<p>"Will be if yuh keep on blattin' our location to the wide
world. Now go on up there."</p>

<p>"Bad business, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"You do as I say or get out of the country, see? I thought you
was tough..."</p>

<p>Denver crouched to the ground, grimly amused; one of these
nighthawks was shuffling up the stairway toward Langdell's dark
office, prodded on by the taut sarcasm of the man below. "If
they're tryin' to set a trap for Langdell," he reflected,
"they're apt to find hard luck. He's had his eye teeth cut on
trick stuff."</p>

<p>The exploring one had arrived at the top landing. A knob
squealed. Silence settled down. Denver grinned in the darkness,
and his hand closed around a loose stone the size of a grape.
Rising in his tracks he tossed the stone toward the building and
dropped to the earth again as it struck and rattled down the
stairway, sounding like an avalanche in the utter quiet. The man
in Langdell's office ran out, made a clean jump, and hit the
ground with a belch of air.</p>

<p>"For Gawd's sake&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Both of them were running clumsily off. Denver hurried back to
the nearest alley and came out on the street in time to see
Stinger Dann go along the sidewalk with a mighty scowl on his
face; and a little afterward the man who had followed him to the
hotel appeared. Both of them drifted into Grogan's.</p>

<p>"Cheap way of havin' a good time," grunted Denver, trying to
fathom Dann's purpose. He walked to the opera house and put his
head inside the door, getting the attention of the nearest man in
the jammed lobby. "Dell, you seen Langdell in here?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh. Down front somewheres. Want him?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Denver retreating. The more he considered
the more he became interested. Stinger Dann was not a man to move
without purpose. So thinking, he ambled onward and ran into Jake
Leverage, who immediately pulled him out of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Want to see you, Dave."</p>

<p>"I'll lend you money, go on your bail, brand your strays, or
furnish character reference for you at the bank," drawled Dave,
"but nothing doing as far as this vigilante business is
concerned."</p>

<p>"I counted on you," stated Leverage gravely. "If I'm goin' to
be useful I've got to have support. You're interested in
this."</p>

<p>"I sang my song at the meetin'," returned Dave. "You heard the
tune and the words."</p>

<p>"Tell me straight," demanded Leverage, "what's the matter with
this business that you won't touch it? Your influence has kept
quite a few fellows out of it, and that ain't right."</p>

<p>"I don't like to trail with a herd just to have company," said
Dave. "And who do you think you're doing this dirty work for,
Jake?"</p>

<p>"For Yellow Hill&mdash;for the Association&mdash;for me and my
family," was Leverage's sober answer.</p>

<p>"And for a bunch of big fellows plenty able to shoulder their
own grief," added Dave. "It don't seem right. I hate to see you
draw down all the enmity of the wild bunch, which is just what
will happen when you hit 'em."</p>

<p>"What's right is right," responded Leverage, somewhat nettled.
"I won't back out of trouble."</p>

<p>"Good enough&mdash;but the big boys were damned quick to back
out of it and let you inherit the grief. No, sir. I'm not buyin'
any chips."</p>

<p>"Is that your whole reason?" pressed Leverage.</p>

<p>Denver hesitated and stared toward Grogan's, eyes narrowing
down in thought. "No-no, it isn't. But I never make a statement I
can't prove, and these other reasons of mine are beyond proof at
the present moment. I'll just say I'm not satisfied with the
layout. Let it go like that."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you this," remarked Leverage earnestly. "When the
scrappin' comes there won't be any neutrals. I foresee that.
Black or white is the colors. And don't let your slim hunches
maneuver you over to the wrong side. It'll cause you
trouble."</p>

<p>"In other words, I'm apt to get hazed down for mindin' my own
strict business?" Denver's face darkened. "That happens to be one
of the things about mob action I don't like. I'll take care of
myself, and I'll see that I am let alone. That applies to the
wild bunch, and that applies to any vigilante who tries to make
me swap opinions."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm afraid of," exclaimed Leverage. "I
have known you since you was a kid. You're as independent as a
hog on ice. You don't bend. And I foresee difficulties. I have
been through these rustlin' wars before. I know just what
happens. Everybody lines up, for or against. And if you stand
back somebody's going to suggest you're lined up with the
rustlers. Then it's too bad."</p>

<p>"The pack will howl at my heels, is that it?" suggested
Denver, rugged face somber and unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I foresee it."</p>

<p>"Then the pack will get a dose of lead," snapped Denver. "I
make no distinction between an outlaw who tries to steal my
cattle and a red-eyed fanatic who tries to change my mind for
me."</p>

<p>Leverage shook his head sadly and turned away. "No hard
feelin's, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Not between you and me, Jake. I'm just thinkin' of the
buzzards who will go hog-wild and want to shoot everybody on
sight."</p>

<p>Leverage moved away. Denver stood still, mastering his temper.
Of a sudden the even thread of life had become snarled with
knots. Standing aloof he became at once the target of both
factions. More than that, he found himself wondering how he
should deal with Jake Leverage, who was one of his best friends.
He knew things Leverage ought to know for the sake of personal
safety. Yet in telling Leverage he became a partisan of the
vigilantes. Rather irritably he headed for Grogan's and bought a
drink. Through the crowd he saw Steve sitting in at a poker game
and went over to find a seat; but the table was full, and so he
contented himself with looking on.</p>

<p>It was an odd company. Directly across from Steve was Stinger
Dann, who ventured a sullen half glance at Dave Denver and
snapped his cards together. Niland and Cal Steele were in the
game, and Buck Meems; and the sixth man was the newly arrived
Englishman, Almaric St. Jennifer Crvecoeur Nightingale, whose
ruddy cheeks and sky-blue eyes mirrored a certain puzzlement with
the game. Cal Steele, possessing under all circumstances the
manners of a gentleman, laid down his hand momentarily.</p>

<p>"You fellows ought to know each other. Nightingale, this is
Dave Denver, owner of a spread known as D Slash. Nightingale has
bought out the Bucket range from the administrator of old
Lindersleeve's estate, Dave."</p>

<p>Nightingale rose slowly and stretched his loose frame to
substantial height. The two shook hands. Nightingale's slurred
and casual "pleasure'm'sure," seemed lackluster, but his steady,
square glance contained something that struck Denver
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Any time you want advice or help," went on Steele, "go to
Denver. I pass the information on to you because I understand how
a newcomer feels. Was one myself, and I considered it a lucky
break to have had Dave to steer me through the early rough
spots." Then Steele smiled, fine handsome face lighting. "So if I
have taken the easy and evil road it is not because I didn't have
sound advice."</p>

<p>"We will now pray," drawled Denver. "You'll have to learn the
difference between that man's truthfulness and alleged humore,
Nightingale. I see you play our pastime."</p>

<p>Nightingale was dealing and doing it rather awkwardly. "Poker?
Well, y'know, I heard it was the thing out here, so I took pains
to purchase a book by a fella and read the rudiments.
Hoyle&mdash;that was the chappie's name. I read his strictures on
the game. Seems simple though entertainin'."</p>

<p>Eyebrows drooped around the circle of watchers. "Call it
that," grumbled Steve. "I got a different sentiment."</p>

<p>"See you slopped over on your resolution," accused Dave.</p>

<p>Steve thumped the table to indicate he could not open and
stared at Denver. "Yeah. Debbie come to town to see the show. How
in hell was I to know she was a-goin' to come? She sends for me.
I goes. I gets the hide blistered off me for not bein' cleaned up
and good clothes on. I asks yuh again, how was I to know? She
wouldn't let me take her to the show, wouldn't be seen walkin'
beside a dirty son of a gun like me. Cast me to the outer
shadders. Ha!"</p>

<p>Niland and Meems likewise passed, though Meems expressed
audible grief that he wasn't permitted to open on four good-
looking clubs. Steele shook his head; at which Stinger Dann,
calculating a pile of ante chips grown healthy by several
infertile rounds, shoved out a stiff opener. Nightingale studied
his cards for so long a time that Stinger Dann grew heavily
sarcastic.</p>

<p>"Didn't Hoyle tell yuh how to read the spots?"</p>

<p>Nightingale was apologetic and entered his chips with the air
of a man somewhat flustered. The percentage being rather sweet,
all the others took a flyer, and Nightingale slowly thumbed out
the draw cards. Niland had been prospecting, and he threw down
out of his turn, studying the Englishman with sharp attention as
if he were finding angles of the man that intrigued his legal
mind. Dann having opened, it was his first bet, and he was about
to shove out a stiff one when the Englishman exclaimed
plaintively:</p>

<p>"These ruddy sequences and combinations elude one damnably.
Let's stop a minute while I get this clear. Purely hypothetical
question, y'understand. I have no such hand, but just what
relative value do five of the same color and suit possess? Mind,
it's purely hypothetical."</p>

<p>Someone in the back of the crowd guffawed, at which Dann
bellowed irately: "If some of you damned monkeys don't quit
breathin' down my neck I'll bust yuh!" He drew back his tentative
bet and snapped at Nightingale. "Supposin' you bet."</p>

<p>"But, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The unique situation of which you speak," drawled Denver,
deriving considerable pleasure from the scene, "is known as a
flush and generally considered easy to look at. Among honest men,
such as these present, it tops a straight but not a full
house."</p>

<p>Dann's heavy eyes flicked dangerously across Denver's face and
settled on the Englishman. He, feeling the weight of both players
and spectators upon him, grew plainly flustered. "But I haven't
got a flush, gentlemen," he muttered and pushed a bet into the
center. Meems instantly laid down with an exaggerated politeness.
"I'll just take yore word for it, Nightingale. I won't contribute
to no painful knowledge." Cal Steele smiled broadly and likewise
threw his cards away. Dann studied the Englishman at length, more
and more belligerent. In the end he hurled his cards across the
table without so much as showing openers.</p>

<p>"Take the pot, you!" he snapped. "I despise playin' with a
beginner that's got fool luck!"</p>

<p>"Do I gather the stakes are mine?" asked Nightingale
humbly.</p>

<p>Dann swore brutally and brushed the chips into the
Englishman's lap at one violent sweep of his arm. The spectators
fell quite silent, some edging off from the table. Nightingale
seemed oblivious of the insult. "How odd," he remarked. "I
believe you thought I had a flush." And he laid down, face up,
five cards of no related poker value at all. Then he reached for
his fallen chips.</p>

<p>Cal Steele exploded in laughter. "You'll never work that one
again, Nightingale! But it was good acting while it lasted!" And
Niland nodded as if some guess he had made to himself was
verified. Stinger Dann swore again and reached over to tear
Nightingale's discarded hand into fragments. "Damn you,
Englishman, don't try to make a fool out of me!"</p>

<p>Denver's suddenly cold rebuke fell into the expectant quiet.
"Don't you know better than to haze a stranger, Dann?"</p>

<p>Dann, still seated, thrust his long jaw up at Denver. "Who
asked you to butt into this affair, Mister Denver?"</p>

<p>"I usually act on my own judgment, as you well know," replied
Denver coolly, "and I dislike Nightingale to think your poker
manners are the manners of Sundown in general."</p>

<p>"Pretty damn proud of yore manners, ain't you?" cried
Dann.</p>

<p>"They're better than yours, which is sayin' little
enough."</p>

<p>Dann's full cheeks slowly purpled, and his big neck began to
swell at the collar. "Maybe you'd like to give me a lesson," he
sneered.</p>

<p>"You might not like my price for teachin'," was Denver's level
reply. He had never stirred, never moved his fists from their
hooked position in his belt. All the sounds of Grogan's saloon
had ceased to the uttermost corners of the room; and as if by
invisible command the spectators drifted clear of the table,
leaving a wide alley down which the two men stared. Those sitting
at the table kept their places, very grave. Cal Steele's cheeks
slowly drained to pale gray, and he tried to catch Denver's
attention.</p>

<p>"When I pay you," shouted Dann, "it will be a long cold day!
You know my regards as to you! It's public knowledge and yores
for the havin'! Any time yuh want to take exception, just go
ahead!"</p>

<p>"My idea exactly," said Denver. "You've been stampin' around
Sundown all day tryin' to start something. What it may be I don't
know. But I'm tired of havin' to watch you. Takes up too much of
my time, and you're not worth it. It's a pretty cheap way of
gettin' a reputation for bein' a bad man&mdash;this business of
standin' on street corners and scowling at peaceful people. If
you are pointed my way, I suggest you get up from your chair and
start forward."</p>

<p>As quiet as the words were, each one of them fell across the
table like the lash of a whip and stung Dann's savage,
undisciplined temper. The kick of his foot against his chair shot
through the room, and his great body sprang forward. At the same
time Cal Steele leaped in front of him, crying, "Stop that!" and
Steele's hand plunged down to check Dann's draw. "Stop it! This
is no night for gunplay!"</p>

<p>Dann cursed wildly and by a heave of his shoulders threw
Steele aside; but the moment of attack was past. Denver's
unmoving position somehow took the edge off gunplay, as also did
his next drawling suggestion.</p>

<p>"You took a chance, Cal, but maybe you're right. However,
we've got to satisfy this amateur bad man before the night's
over. Unbuckle your belt, Dann, and I'll do the same. We'll give
the boys a treat."</p>

<p>Dann ripped his gun belt free and threw it aside, rolling out
from the table into the center of the room. Denver dropped his
own belt and moved to meet him. Somebody cried a suggestion that
fell on deaf ears. In the flash of a second Stinger Dann yelled,
"I'll kill you&mdash;I'll break your neck with my fists!" and
lunged into Denver. His bare head struck Denver on a shoulder
blade, and the sharp impact cracked across the circle; Denver's
upswinging fist smashed into Dann's lowered face, drove it back,
and set the gunman on his heels; and in that brief respite Denver
saw the common passions of mankind staring at him from all those
faces ringed around; savagery glittering out from gluttonous eyes
and flaring lips; fear pinching the cheeks of the craven hearted;
and the lust and carnivorous instincts of those who watched their
own desires to crush and kill being here played out second hand.
Then Dann ran in again, unmercifully beating down Denver's rapier
jabs, disregarding them, knocking them aside. He roared. His hot
breath belched in Denver's nostrils, and his black face became
two great bloodshot eyes. Denver felt his backbone snapping to
pressure; a stabbing weight stamped down the arch of his foot; he
was backheeled, overbalanced, and he went sprawling through the
air and struck the resilient flesh of those onlookers who were
baled into so tight a mass. A long rolling pain surged through
his body, and he saw blood, his blood, sprinkled on the floor.
Dann's brute roar challenged him. His head cleared, and he was
up, beating back another relentless rush.</p>

<p>Dann's face was a crimson, dripping disk, and Dann's arms
reached again for that bone-crushing grip. Denver stepped aside,
pounded at the gunman's face, crashed a blow into the gunman's
exposed temple, and swerved to attack again. The temple blow
confused Dann, and he stopped to find his opponent, head tipping
on the huge muscles of his neck. There was no more for Denver to
ask; he had turned tiger, he had unleashed all those wild, primal
impulses that stirred in him and were subdued by gentler rules of
society. Tonight he was no better than a man of the Stone Age,
and through the welter of this conflict the crimson target of
Dann's head, the shimmer of pale faces all around, the sharp
bursts of pain, the feel of a body giving way&mdash;through this
his mind ran clearly, sharply, exultantly. If he were no better
than a savage, then thank God he was still enough of one to meet
savagery and beat it down. Dann had found him uncertainly and
lumbered in. Denver heard himself laughing&mdash;the sound of it
like jagged metals conflicting. He struck aside the groping arms,
he pounded the staring face, ripped blows into the swaying body,
and sank his fist into a bull neck that rolled away from him and
sank down.</p>

<p>Like a man coming out of ether, he stood back to watch
Grogan's saloon and all roundabout objects grow clear. The mist
fell away; men became something more than blurred outlines, and
he was again David Denver instead of a body twisting and swerving
under the impulse of a stark, single-celled will. Dann rolled on
the floor and shuddered; climbed to his knees and gained his
feet. He looked apathetically at Denver, not yet clear
headed.</p>

<p>"I said the lesson in manners might cost you something,"
stated Denver. "My advice is you ride out of town and stay out
for a while."</p>

<p>"It's a mistake I ain't apt to repeat," muttered Dann without
emotion. "I never will use my fists on yuh again, Denver. I'll
set for you&mdash;don't make any mistake on the subject. But it
will be with a gun&mdash;remember it." Gradually the venom
returned to him. "Mebbe I paid a steep price, but, by God, you'll
regret this night's work the last day of your life! And on that
day I'll show yuh how a white man can rip the livin' heart out of
yuh and laugh when he does it!"</p>

<p>"When you ride tonight," said Denver, "take those two strays
you been nursin' along with you. They're around somewhere."</p>

<p>The crowd was disturbed by a man shouldering impatiently
through. It was Lou Redmain.</p>

<p>"You through with Dann?" he asked Denver. "Had your pleasure
with him?"</p>

<p>There was again in Grogan's dropping off of talk, a
premonitory chill. Denver nodded somberly. "I'm finished. He's
yours."</p>

<p>"Then," said Redmain, pointing a finger at Dann as he would
have beckoned a dog, "get out of town within two minutes. And if
you ever disobey my orders again I shall shoot you down. Go on,
get out." He confronted Denver. "I want you to know this is not
my doing. You've got my word on that point."</p>

<p>Dann rolled down the lane made for him and disappeared through
the door. Denver, knowing every word of his was witnessed and
would be carried far, spoke deliberately.</p>

<p>"Your word is good with me, Lou. When you give it I never
doubt it. I have nothing against you now. You are not my kind of
a man&mdash;you see things considerably different. The day may
come when we will have to scrap. Until then consider me as a
neutral minding my own business. I expect to mind my own
business; I expect others to allow me to mind my own business. If
they don't, that will be another story. Supposin' we drink on
that?"</p>

<p>"Agreeable," said Redmain. They walked to the bar. Grogan set
out the glasses and bottle, and in perfect silence they downed
the liquor. A slight flush appeared on Redmain's triangular face
as he turned to the crowd. Nodding again at Denver, he walked
quickly from the place. Talk sprang up on his departure like air
rushing into a vacuum. Nightingale came forward, with Steve
Steers and Steele and Niland. The Englishman's bright blue eyes
held some reserved, remote expression.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he drawled, "for the timely intervention. Y'know, I
gen'rally take care of my own sorrows. Would have done so this
evenin', but things moved so blasted fast that I scarcely had
puckered my mouth to say something than it was all over. I shall
have to be a little&mdash;er&mdash;quicker on the trigger, as it
were. Now, I wonder if the proper move in the circumstances isn't
to have a little spirituous stimulant? Not so?"</p>

<p>"Any time's time to drink," observed Cal Steele.</p>

<p>"My judgment is that your poker technique was derived from
other sources beside Hoyle," grinned Denver.</p>

<p>"I have played&mdash;a game or two," drawled Nightingale; and
it seemed to Denver that somewhere behind those remarkably azure
eyes there was a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>"Here's to sin," observed Steve Steers; and so they christened
a friendship.</p>

<p>"Do I look bad?" questioned Denver.</p>

<p>"Yore spine may be crooked," said Niland, "but he didn't reach
your face at all. However, that shirt will do you no further
good. Button up your coat."</p>

<p>"I will do same and depart," agreed Denver. "See you in
church."</p>

<p>"Stick around," adjured Steve. "The night's but a pup."</p>

<p>"It'll be a long-haired dog before you drag out of here," said
Denver and walked down the hall, stiff from the pounding he had
received. Nightingale looked thoughtfully at the rugged back and
made a quiet observation.</p>

<p>"A most cur'ous combination of dynamite, the irresist'ble
force, nine hungry leopards, and Vesuvius in eruption. I take it
he was rather angry with this Stinger Dann. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"That's approximately correct," chuckled Cal Steele.</p>

<p>"I like the beggar," stated Nightingale three drinks later,
"and trust the feeling may presently be reciprocated."</p>

<p>"Hold on," broke in Steve Steers coldly. "No man can say that
word in my presence. I want you to understand I'm a lady."</p>

<p>Denver walked out to his horse and led it down as far as the
hotel, where he discovered the Leverage family gathered. Jake
Leverage appealed to him. "I've got to stay over tonight, Dave,
and Ma is too tired to go back this evenin'. But Eve figgers she
wants to drift home."</p>

<p>"I'm heading that way," said Denver, "and came to offer my
company."</p>

<p>"It's three miles out of your way," observed Eve. "I can go
alone."</p>

<p>"Would it be the first time I took the long way home with you,
Eve?" drawled Denver. The girl blushed and drew up the collar of
her coat against the encroaching cold. Mrs. Leverage smiled
knowingly. The crowd, released from the show, eddied around them,
and there was a general shifting to make room on the porch. Lola
Monterey walked swiftly by, smiling through a pale and weary
face. Dave lifted his hat. Lola's husky "Goodnight, Dave" floated
gently over the assembled people; then she was gone. Dave tied
his pony to the Leverage buggy and helped Eve to the seat,
wrapping the robe about her feet. When he settled beside her and
gathered the reins she leaned nearer to him, to speak just above
a whisper.</p>

<p>"She's beautiful, David."</p>

<p>"I have always thought so," he replied, and looked more
closely at the clear, frank face turned up to him. "So are you,
Eve."</p>

<p>"I think," said she, smiling wistfully, "this is going to be
the nicest part of the evening."</p>

<p>He turned the buggy in the choked street and drew aside. Dr.
Williamson reined in on a borrowed horse, heavy eyed. "It was a
boy, Dave, and the Jessons said to thank you."</p>

<p>"Another young Stephen to buck the world, I reckon," mused
Dave.</p>

<p>Williamson looked at the pair with solemn approval. "Tuck the
robe higher on Eve's throat. It's raw tonight. Don't drive too
fast goin' home. It's a fine evenin'&mdash;for young people." As
he swung away he added another phrase. "No, they named the baby
David, which I thought fit and proper."</p>

<p>"The first David named after me," said Denver uncomfortably
and maneuvered down Prairie Street. The damp, swirling darkness
of the stage road absorbed them. Eve stirred slightly, and he put
his arm about her to catch up the robe&mdash;and left it
there.</p>

<p>"A brotherly interest, David?" asked Eve, softly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I'm not so sure of that, Eve."</p>

<p>"Well, it makes no difference. It helps to keep the cold
away."</p>

<p>He thought she was smiling to herself. So in comfortable
silence they jogged along.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE EASY EVIL
TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lola Monterey climbed the stairs and turned
toward her room a slim man in a black hat stepped from the
obscurity of the hall's end.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you, Lola," said he quietly.</p>

<p>The girl stopped with a breath of surprise. "Lou&mdash;you
come like a ghost."</p>

<p>He drew off his hat, smiling with pleasure. "A ghost out of
the past&mdash;a not pleasant past?" The dark and triangular face
of the man studied her with quick pride. She rested against the
wall, eyes half shut, passive. "I had to see you," he went
on.</p>

<p>She motioned to her door. "Go in, then. Five minutes, no
more."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I wouldn't do that. It's too late at
night."</p>

<p>"You have not changed," she observed gently. "You still
protect me."</p>

<p>"You've changed."</p>

<p>"For better or worse?"</p>

<p>"Better for you&mdash;worse for me. Once you were Peter
Monterey's daughter in a knockdown shack, and I fed you rustled
beef to keep that fire in your eyes. Now you are a fine lady and
past my help. Maybe you have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Never! Why should I forget? I am not ashamed of my past, Lou.
I am proud that this sand nourished me. There is only one thing
I'm not proud of."</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, sharp and intent.</p>

<p>"For ever leaving. Tell me, is David serious with Eve
Leverage?"</p>

<p>Redmain's expressive face darkened. "I wish to God I
knew!"</p>

<p>Her luminous eyes widened on him. "So&mdash;it is that way
with you?"</p>

<p>"It is," was his short answer. "I have wanted that girl since
she was out of pigtails. She doesn't know it. Nobody knows it but
you, chiquita. And you are keeping it to yourself."</p>

<p>"As you once kept my secrets," she promised him, "away back
when I was fighting to be a fine and great lady. Ah, Lou, I am
sorry for you. But he is not happy."</p>

<p>"Who, Dave? I suppose not. Neither am I, neither are you.
Neither is anybody in this world who's got mind enough to see how
crooked the whole game is and blood enough to fight back."</p>

<p>"You never have quarreled with him, Lou?" she asked, worry in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Never yet. I like the man as much as it is in me to like
anybody, which is say in' little."</p>

<p>"I never want you to quarrel with him."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows what's to come? Things
are pretty badly tangled in Yellow Hill. He and I step around
each other politely. How long that continues only God knows."</p>

<p>"You are bitter," she remarked. "What could happen that would
make you two have trouble?"</p>

<p>But he laughed shortly and changed the subject. "I had to see
you for a minute. One of the few things I look back on with
considerable satisfaction, Lola, is that I was a friend of yours
and never let you down. Reckon it'll be a long time
until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I am staying here. This is home for me from now on."</p>

<p>He said nothing for several moments, but his lips tightened as
he watched the changing color of her eyes. "I reckon," he said
finally, "we are all fools. But what of it? Well, I'll see you
again, then. Meantime, don't believe too much you hear about me.
Goodnight."</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Lou."</p>

<p>He went slowly down the stairs to the street. Families and
riding outfits were departing, leaving Sundown in the hands of
the more reckless spirits; Grogan's was noisy, and the Palace
piano, muted during the show, threw a rakish tune into the
semidarkness. The night marshal passed by, cast a quick glance at
Redmain, and spoke courteously. "Good-evenin' to you,
Redmain."</p>

<p>Redmain nodded, the curve of his Up increasingly sardonic. He
reached his horse, swung to the saddle, and went racking down
Prairie Street. As the lights of town winked out one by one
behind him he lifted his head and laughed bitterly. "By God,
life's funny enough to make a man cry. If she stays she'll find
out what I've turned into&mdash;she'll find out that from a plain
harum-scarum fellow I've got to be a crook, a rustler, a leader
of outlaws&mdash;a renegade with enough reputation to make the
night marshal act polite! I'd rather cut off my arm than to have
her know it&mdash;but she will. Eve Leverage already knows it.
Everybody I want to be friends with knows it. So now there ain't
a damned soul in the world I can mix with as an ordinary, decent
human bein'!"</p>

<p>He swept rapidly along the road, passing slower rigs that were
but shapeless outlines in the dark. Drowsy calls were thrown at
him but he kept still, both from pride and purpose; for with the
coming night he resumed the traits of his trade&mdash;secrecy,
swiftness, and vigilance. The knowledge he shifted roles so
abruptly added to the kindling fire of his temper.</p>

<p>"Nobody to blame but myself. I chose this business, and I
reckon I've prospered. Why have regrets? Why weaken now and fall
away from the big prizes? I despise a quitter; I hate a man that
will not live up to his talents whether crooked or honest. And if
there's no longer a soul in Yellow Hill I can trust or go to for
help&mdash;then why not throw overboard every damned last scruple
I've got and turn wolf? Why not?"</p>

<p>Unconsciously he had shouted that question into the night, and
the muffled echo came down the dripping side of Shoshone Dome
like the answer of fate. It stiffened him in the saddle as he
went racing onward; it roused his gambler's superstitions. These
black shadows, within which he spent so much of his life, had
replied. It was his dark destiny speaking, it was one clear call
in a career of uncertainty. Flashes of realization raced through
his agile mind; he was successful and powerful because he had
veered from set ways of honesty. He had cut through, he had gone
ahead, each step more daring and ruthless and confident. So there
was left him only one course&mdash;to carry this cold and swift
relentlessness of purpose to its ultimate conclusion. Trust no
one, bend to no one, never let his heart hold kindness, never let
his mind be bound by a promise.</p>

<p>He skimmed through the fog-damp countryside, ran by the toe of
Starlight and on into the southern reaches. At a point where the
stage road hit a direct and descending line into the open prairie
he slackened speed and turned up a lesser trail, winding between
the funereal gloom of overshadowing pines. A creek dashed down
grade, and the pitch of the trail sharpened. Light flashed
covertly at him from a summit cabin; somebody moved in front and
challenged softly:</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Dann here yet?"</p>

<p>"Waitin' for yuh."</p>

<p>He dismounted, led his horse slightly to one side of the
cabin, and went back, entering the place with a swift and
sidewise motion that exposed him very briefly to the outer world.
Two men sat beside a stove, and a third, Stinger Dann, lolled on
the adjacent bunk, holding his swollen head between his
hands.</p>

<p>"Next time," said Redmain, "you'll know better."</p>

<p>Dann rose. "Next time I'll kill him!"</p>

<p>"Not while you're in my outfit, Dann. You'll behave. You'll
take my orders, and you'll never lift a finger unless I say
so."</p>

<p>"Then," cried Dann, "I'll pull out of yore damned outfit!"</p>

<p>Redmain's eyes burned into Dann while the trembling moments
passed by. Dann's bulk overshadowed him, and Dann's evilly
stamped features made the slim chief seem juvenile by comparison.
Yet Lou Redmain's will swelled through that cramped cabin room
like sun's heat. "You will never leave my outfit, Dann. You threw
in with me voluntarily. I made you a partner in this business.
You know my secrets. There will never be any getting away for
you. You stick."</p>

<p>Dann squared himself defensively. The arrogant, bullying
strength in him crumbled before Redmain's superior power. "What
yuh tryin' to tell me? I'm a free man! I'm not no damned peon,
Lou! I come and I go!"</p>

<p>"Only when I tell you," droned Redmain, and the narrow face
moved with anger. "I say you stick or you take the consequences.
Make up your mind here and now. I've got a good medicine for herd
jumpers like you. Well, what is it to be?"</p>

<p>"I ain't m'self," muttered Dann. "I feel bad, I feel awful.
Don't haze me around like that. Can't a man blow off steam once
in a while?"</p>

<p>Redmain laughed contemptuously. "I'm glad we have settled it.
And I want you to understand this once and for all&mdash;never
cross Dave Denver, never make a play for him unless I give you
orders on the subject. What made you think your draw was as fast
as his, anyhow? Why, you fool, he can beat any man's bullet in
this country except mine. You'd be dead now if Cal Steele hadn't
stopped your play. And what were you doing in Sundown tonight? I
didn't tell you to be there."</p>

<p>"Just rode over from the Wells to have a little fun," mumbled
Dann, not meeting Red-main's glance.</p>

<p>"You lie," retorted the chief coolly. "You had some nutty idea
in your head. Trying to be tough on your own account. If you
didn't have my name standing behind you, Dann, somebody would
have put a bullet in that clumsy body of yours long ago. I'll
tolerate no more foolishness!"</p>

<p>Dann took the lashing in silence; the other two stared at the
floor. Redmain turned to one of them impatiently. "The job done,
Gus?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Gus. "We took twenty cows and calves, run 'em
acrost the bridge and stopped near the road. Now what?"</p>

<p>Redmain considered it briefly. "As soon as the travel from
Sundown slacks off, put the stuff over the road in a hurry and
drive into Tom's Hole. Dann, you go along with the bunch and camp
with them. Don't come back to the Wells until I send for you.
Tomorrow I want the calves branded and the cows blotted. Take
your time and do a good job."</p>

<p>"What brand yuh goin' to use this time?"</p>

<p>"Same we've been using lately." Redmain rolled a cigarette,
lips compressing. A flare of slight excitement moved across his
eyes. "So far, I have played a fifty-fifty game. Half crooked and
half honest. It's no good. I'm out for blood. You take one of
those cows and switch the brand to Denver's D Slash. Make a
bunglin' amateur job of it that anybody could see. Tomorrow night
drive it into Denver's range and leave it."</p>

<p>"Plantin' somethin' on him, huh?" was Dann's exclamation.</p>

<p>Voices rose outside the cabin. Redmain warned the others.
"Keep your mouths shut about this." Then the door opened, and
another man entered, smiling sleepily.</p>

<p>It was Cal Steele. "You're late," said Redmain.</p>

<p>"What of it?" drawled Steele. "I might have been still later.
I might not have come at all."</p>

<p>"In our business we've got to move fast," grunted Redmain.</p>

<p>"So you ascribe your success in life to the fact you are
always punctual," jeered Steele.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes," Redmain reminded him grimly, "may make the
difference of our bein' alive or hung. Don't forget that."</p>

<p>"Is it so important to be alive?" countered Steele wearily. He
pointed his finger at Dann and spoke with an angry accent. "As
for you, my friend, you nearly got your cursed head beat off, and
I wish Dave had finished the job. You'll have to get up earlier
to make a sucker out of that boy. What is more, if you had
plugged him I would have plugged you. I've said before I won't
stand for this crowd monkeyin' with Dave Denver. He is my best
friend. Though," and Steele turned morosely unpleasant, "he
wouldn't be if he knew what a double-faced misfit I really
am."</p>

<p>"So you find friendship begins to sour?" said Redmain.</p>

<p>"A man such as myself deserves no friends," Steele
muttered.</p>

<p>"Neither deserves them nor has them," replied Redmain. "I made
the same discovery tonight, Cal. So what does that leave us? Why,
kick all the fine sentiment overboard and be what we were meant
to be."</p>

<p>Steele frowned. "The logical outcome of that belief is
published notoriety and sooner or later a posse on our heels. And
a cottonwood tree for a springboard."</p>

<p>"They can't beat me. They've got nothing definite on me. Nor
on you."</p>

<p>"Nothing is secret forever," murmured Steele. "Public
notoriety will do for you or Dann, but I've got enough left in me
to need decent friends. Oh, well&mdash;what is the situation
now?"</p>

<p>"We took some beef tonight. It'll be changed over to your
brand tomorrow and be kept hidden until the new burns are healed.
Then we'll drive it to your range. Meanwhile I've got about
thirty head ready for you now. They've gone through the aging
process for two months. Tomorrow night I'll have them thrown into
your upper range. Better see to it all your riders are
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Be careful about that brand blotting," warned Steele. "I want
no slips."</p>

<p>"Gus is an expert," said Redmain. "You couldn't tell the
difference with a razor and a microscope. You're safe. Better
ship early this year. I need money."</p>

<p>"Whose stuff did you take tonight?"</p>

<p>"Fee's," returned Redmain. "Our last operation over beyond Sky
Peak. We're going to work this side durin' the year. That
Englishman don't know anything. I'm going to milk him dry."</p>

<p>"Dirty business," grunted Steele. "I like the fellow."</p>

<p>"Something you ought to've thought of a long time ago,"
retorted Redmain. "No chance to change now. You've got your hands
soiled."</p>

<p>"I think I know that better than you do," said Steele and rose
to leave. "You've heard about the Association going in for
vigilantes with Leverage at the head of 'em?"</p>

<p>Redmain laughed. "He couldn't catch a cold. I'll run him
ragged. The poor devil doesn't know&mdash;" Then he caught
himself. The two men exchanged significant glances. Steele
said:</p>

<p>"You're a careful cuss, and you've got brains. Don't overplay
your hand."</p>

<p>Redmain closed one fist and spoke with a suppressed exultance.
"I am going the limit, Steele!"</p>

<p>"Be careful. And leave Denver strictly alone. I'll string
along with you up to that point. Then I draw out. I won't be a
party to any doublecross of Dave." Steele went out. Redmain
stared at the other men for a long interval.</p>

<p>"Get going, all of you. And keep your mouths shut."</p>

<p>They departed, leaving him alone by the stove, wrapped in his
dark thoughts. One by one he explored the alleys of opportunity
before him; man by man he considered his outfit, the weak and the
strong, the faithful and the treacherous. And from there he began
to calculate the power of those ranged against him, his own
individual strength set beside that of other individuals and his
own outfit matched with the vigilantes. Never before had he let
his mind run free as tonight, and never before had he caught so
clear a view of the mastery that might be his if he were only
bold enough to strike quickly and hard. It flushed him, it fed
the latent ambition within him. Out of all this emerged his
conclusions. "Denver I shall some day have to meet. Steele will
never approve of what I aim to do. He must go down. Soon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; WHISPERING RANGE</h2>

<p class="first">OCCASIONALLY the women of the district answered
the vagrant call of social impulse, and this afternoon a dozen of
them were informally gathered together in the shade of the long
galleried Leverage porch. The sun, dipping westward, began to
desert the emerald ridges but still made a bright yellow glare in
the open prairie that rolled away from the foothills into the
dazzling distance. It was high time to pack up and go, but the
ladies lingered, some reluctant to depart, some waiting for the
men folk to come after them.</p>

<p>"Men," stated Mrs. Jim Coldfoot, biting off her thread, "are
all the same and none of 'em too good. When I look about Yellow
Hill and consider the specimens wearing pants I'm plumb reminded
of a rummage counter with all the good cloth already took."</p>

<p>The circle smiled, knowing Mrs. Jim Coldfoot well. Her heart
was sound, but her inquisitive mind pried into all things, her
ears missed nothing, and her tongue readily dealt in scandal.</p>

<p>"Well," observed a Mrs. Roberts gently, "I dare say some of
the poor dears would like to say the same of us."</p>

<p>"They're scared to," observed Mrs. Jim Coldfoot acidly. "All
they can do is look humble as pie, and mutter to themselves. Like
I've told Coldfoot time and again, if he's got any mutterin' to
do for land sakes go behind the woodshed and do it alone. You
can't teach 'em anything, you can't get 'em to admit anything.
And they'll lie for each other 'sif they belonged to a lodge.
Strange to me women can't stick together like that. Men call it
honor not to tell on the other fellow. I call it a universal
sense of guilt."</p>

<p>"What of it?" Mrs. Casper Flood wanted to know. "Women are
free to take men or leave them alone, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"We ain't got that much sense," retorted Mrs. Jim Coldfoot. "I
married Coldfoot because he pestered me to death. Sometimes I
think he's sorry for it, though heaven knows I'm good to
him."</p>

<p>One of the ladies hid her face behind a piece of quilt work
and coughed delicately. Deborah Lunt, who had returned from the
Sky Peak country, listened wide eyed to this devastatingly frank
comment of the older women. Distinctly a pretty girl, she had a
manner of drawing her mouth primly together when she was shocked
or displeased.</p>

<p>"I believe," said she emphatically, "a woman should not let a
man be too familiar. He won't respect her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jim Coldfoot peered over her glasses with quick interest.
"When you and Steve going to get married?"</p>

<p>Debbie flushed. "I don't&mdash;that is, the date isn't set
yet."</p>

<p>"Don't let him dangle too long or you'll lose him," advised
Mrs. Jim.</p>

<p>Debbie's flush deepened. "I wouldn't hold him a minute if he
didn't want to marry me. I'm not that kind."</p>

<p>"Ha," contradicted Mrs. Jim. "I've heard lots of 'em say that.
It ain't so. All of us sisters fight tooth and toe nail to get a
husband. Lessee, you've been engaged six months. No, six months
and a half. I recall when I heard the news. Well, that's time
enough to let anybody suffer. Ought to have your mind made up by
now. No matter how bad you think he is now, he'll be worse when
you look at him over the breakfast table with his whiskers in the
coffee."</p>

<p>Debbie's deepening flush became scarlet storm signals.
"There's nothing bad about him! He's a fine, good man!"</p>

<p>Eve, silent thus far, broke in smoothly. "Debbie, don't let
Mrs. Jim fluster you like that. She just loves to disturb
us."</p>

<p>"I've got ears and eyes," responded Mrs. Jim tersely. "Anyhow,
with Lola Monterey back, I wouldn't trust no man around the
corner. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ladies looked at Mrs. Jim with varying expressions of
warning and significance. Mrs. Casper Flood tried to change the
subject. "I heard the funniest story about&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Jim had the bit in her teeth and was not to be
stopped. "You can't make nothing out of nothing. Lola's the
daughter of a Spanish woman and a white man, which is bad. She
learned her trade in a dance hall, and that ain't any help to
her. She's been all over the world singing and Lord knows that's
nothing to brag about either. I'll admit she's got a way with
her, but good looks and nice clothes mean nothing to me even if
it does set every man under seventy on his ears."</p>

<p>"I think she is beautiful," said Eve quietly, feeling the
united scrutiny of the group.</p>

<p>"Ain't you worried?" challenged Mrs. Jim.</p>

<p>"Over what?" Eve asked innocently.</p>

<p>"Well, goodness sakes," exclaimed Mrs. Jim, "whose man is Dave
Denver, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Now, isn't it queer?&mdash;I have forgotten to ask him
that."</p>

<p>Approval of this faint rebuke fairly exuded from the other
women. But Mrs. Jim didn't know a rebuke from an invitation to
dinner. The restless brightness of her glance skittered over
Eve's boyish, half smiling countenance. And she plumped out an
eager question.</p>

<p>"Would you marry him at the chance?"</p>

<p>Eve laughed outright. "I never answer direct questions on
Tuesdays."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jim put away her knitting, seeing Coldfoot approaching
with a buggy. "Well," she sighed, "you're a good actor anyhow.
Though it ain't any of my business, I'll say I think you're crazy
if you're not interested in him. But if you are interested in him
there's enough between him and Lola Monterey to cause you many a
sleepless night. Girls, I just had an elegant time." She smiled
all around and turned to her husband, who waited in subdued
silence.</p>

<p>"You're late," said she with some asperity.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mama," agreed Coldfoot and snapped one of his
suspenders.</p>

<p>"Don't mumble at me with all that tobacco in your mouth. If
you've got to spit, then spit." She climbed vigorously into the
buggy and they went swaying out to the road. Mrs. Casper Flood
collapsed in her rocker and laughed so hard she almost cried.
Mrs. Roberts rose to end her visit. "After a scene like that,"
she remarked, "I always go home a better woman and cook something
special for the men. Nellie, are you riding with me?"</p>

<p>The group broke up. More buggies came down the road to claim
the errant housewives. Mrs. Casper Flood stepped to the saddle of
a waiting pony and went out of the yard on the gallop; and as the
last of them left a man rounded the bend of the ridge, sitting
slack and indolent, and pointed for the yard. Eve waved an arm at
which Debbie Lunt showed surprise.</p>

<p>"You've got awfully good eyes, Eve. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Dave."</p>

<p>"Well, no wonder." She wrinkled her pert nose impatiently. "If
Steve dawdled along like that when he knew I was waiting for him
I most certainly would lecture him."</p>

<p>"Not if Steve were Dave," said Eve softly, "and not if you
were me."</p>

<p>Dave cut across the yard and reined in beside the porch. He
did not immediately get down, but lifted his hat and studied the
two girls quizzically. "Now here is a picture worth travelin' to
see," he drawled. "But, hold on, it ain't quite perfect. One of
these fair damsels looks like she's too proud to scowl at me and
too stubborn to smile. Debbie, I ain't stolen your Stevie
boy."</p>

<p>Debbie flushed and tipped her chin defiantly. In her heart she
was a little afraid of Denver and a little jealous. The fear,
queerly enough, was the fear of a little girl facing a man whose
explosive fighting qualities had been talked about in the country
for years. Yet it was not altogether that; Debbie always
instinctively tried to cover her feelings when his deep and
direct and slightly ironic glance rested on her. She felt he was
reading her, prying out her intrinsic worth, and finding her
lacking. As for the jealousy, she hated the thought that anybody
had the power of swaying Steve Steers's loyalty and affection;
and she knew Denver had this power.</p>

<p>"You're making fun of me," said she, despising herself for
going on the defensive.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not me, Debbie. I never laugh at pretty girls. And
where is that human dynamo on wheels&mdash;in other words, Mister
Stephen Burt Steers?"</p>

<p>"He's supposed to be here now, to take me home," said Debbie
with a faint inflection of tartness. Dave looked lazily at Eve
and understanding passed between. Eve crooked her finger at
him.</p>

<p>"Get down and wait. I see a party coming off the prairie, and
Dad's probably in it."</p>

<p>"What makes you think I didn't come to see you instead of your
dad?" challenged Dave, stepping to the ground.</p>

<p>"I know you better."</p>

<p>"You don't know me at all," he grumbled and sat on the porch
steps. Debbie frowned vainly at the empty road and walked into
the house. Dave chuckled, and Eve winked at him. "No," pursued
Dave, "you don't know me at all. I may not be so doggone
brotherly. Maybe my intentions are honorable."</p>

<p>She had walked to a porch table. Her answer came over her
shoulder, cool and skeptical. "I'm sure your intentions are
honorable, Dave&mdash;whatever they may be and whichever way they
may be directed."</p>

<p>"That remark sounds simple," he mused, "but there's a delayed
punch in it."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Here's a cup of tea, stone cold but good for
thirst, anyhow."</p>

<p>He took it, stirred the sugar absently, and drank. Eve sat
down beside him. "I heard this afternoon why the Jessons named
the baby after you."</p>

<p>He colored a little, self-contained man as he was. "That fool
of a Steve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you know by now," she broke in quietly, "there's very
little you do that escapes Yellow Hill? People wonder about you
and talk about you&mdash;and they always will. I have heard other
things concerning you&mdash;about Dann and about&mdash;well, many
things."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jim Coldfoot must have been here," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I reckon it's impossible to keep folks from trying to guess
what they don't know," he muttered.</p>

<p>"No, Dave. But some of those guesses are kind." She drew a
breath and added wistfully, "Mine are."</p>

<p>"It's possible they oughtn't be too kind, Eve. I say that to
you&mdash;and never another soul&mdash;because I figure you ought
to know. Don't consider me too bad. Don't consider me too
good."</p>

<p>"Whatever you were, I doubt if it could change my opinion of
you," said she, and turned from the subject. "There's Dad and
some of the boys&mdash;and the Englishman."</p>

<p>The party trotted up. Leverage looked enormously grave and
disturbed; something had shaken his usual carriage. He got
heavily down and turned first to his daughter. "You see that some
sort of chuck is put on the table right off, Eve. I've got to go
out again. Dave, come over to the sheds with me. I want to speak
with you."</p>

<p>They walked away from the house. "I came up to tell you my men
have cut out about twenty of your drift," said Denver. "We're not
too pressed for help, and if you are short-handed I'll just keep
your stuff separate until the country's covered, then shoot it
over."</p>

<p>"Thanks," grunted Leverage and stopped, casting a glance back.
"Dave, I have feared this for a long while, and now it's come. An
open break between them and us, nothin' less. They've called our
challenge. They mean to make it a bloody mess. Lorn Rue was
killed sometime last night over on the Henry trail, about three
miles south of the Wells. We just found him an hour ago."</p>

<p>"He was one of your picked men?"</p>

<p>"He was. Somehow or other they knew he was and laid for him.
It just means this&mdash;there's a leak already in the
vigilantes. It means also that they've got the country so well
honeycombed that they catch every move we make. Rue was placed
carefully to watch the Wells; he went into the country after dead
dark. And still they got him! That bothers me.</p>

<p>"You had him in there to watch what the outlaws were going to
do?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to get a good fresh trail to follow," admitted
Leverage. "That's their nest. They go from the Wells to rustle,
and they come back to the Wells to carouse. It's the right place
to begin our attack. But," and Leverage ran a hand over his
harried cheeks, "my job is going to be plain useless if I can't
keep things secret."</p>

<p>"Find any tracks around him?"</p>

<p>Leverage shook his head. "He was right in the trail. All sorts
of old tracks and fresh tracks running up and down. Everything
mixed up; no help there."</p>

<p>"He must have run into something," reflected Denver, "and they
shot him to keep his mouth shut."</p>

<p>"We scouted the ground all ways from his body and didn't get a
smell."</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Denver. "If he got too close to some choice
spot of theirs they'd lug his body off a considerable distance
and drop it."</p>

<p>"I hadn't considered that," grunted Leverage. "Confound it, I
need a good man to go in there and scout."</p>

<p>"Rue was a good man&mdash;while he lasted," said Denver
moodily. "That's the hell of this vigilante business. Rue dies
because he's lookin' for somebody that took somebody else's
cattle. He didn't have a dime in the transaction. And the fellows
who ought to be fighting their own battles are sittin' down this
minute to a good dinner. It ain't right, Jake. Pretty soon
everybody will be livin' under gunshot law because the Fees and
the Clandrys and the Remingtons are either too afraid or too lazy
to take care of their own individual affairs. It's a rotten
business!"</p>

<p>"I hate to hear you talk thataway," protested Leverage. "It's
a common fight. If these rustlers hit the big ranchers and get
away with it they'll hit the little ones."</p>

<p>"The rustlers wouldn't get away with it if these aforesaid big
ranchers didn't hang back," retorted Denver.</p>

<p>"I wish you was in this with me," sighed Leverage. "There
ain't anybody else who could strike a warm trail like you."</p>

<p>Denver considered it silently, violet eyes bent on the
distance. "Rue was a friend of mine. I hate to see him go. It
ain't easy for me to consider that there'll be other friends
knocked down. And it ain't easy to consider that you yourself may
be the next."</p>

<p>"I'm in it and I'll stay in it," responded Leverage doggedly.
"I consider it a duty."</p>

<p>"Maybe I would, too, if I was able to satisfy myself as to the
exact beginnin' of this vigilante idea," mused Denver.</p>

<p>"Listen," broke in Leverage irritably, "are you tryin' to tell
me this whole vigilante business was started to throw a smoke
cloud over something crooked? Why, that's crazy. The Association
voted it. No single man got it going."</p>

<p>"There's always a beginning to an idea&mdash;usually in one
man's head," was Denver's thoughtful reply. "And I'd never fight
for any idea or any man unless I knew more about the preliminary
hocus-pocus. But what's the use of our arguin'? If it wouldn't be
violating any oath of secrecy, I wish you'd tell me where you
intended to concentrate your investigation."</p>

<p>"I'm going into the Sky Peak country."</p>

<p>Denver leaned forward. "I'll say this to you alone and nobody
else. Don't. The rustlers have pulled out of it."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Leverage.</p>

<p>Denver's face lightened. "Maybe I'm not a good enough citizen
to join in a public posse, Jake, but I'm at least good enough to
keep my ear on the ground. And for the love of heaven don't ride
alone in this country. Never. Daylight or dark."</p>

<p>Leverage shrugged his shoulders, and they turned back to the
house. The Englishman sat on the steps twirling his hat. When
Leverage went inside Nightingale looked at Denver. "Seems to be a
touch of the dismal in the air, which reminds me I need some of
that honest advice Cal Steele said you were duly competent to
render."</p>

<p>"Shoot," drawled Denver, noting another rider appear on the
far curve of the road. "I'm good at spendin' other people's money
and time."</p>

<p>"I find," said Nightingale, "I have inherited a crew along
with a ranch. Nice playful boys, but they seem to think
Englishmen are fair game for all sorts of sporty tricks. I also
have&mdash;or rather had&mdash;a foreman who took a sudden
dislike to the idea of workin' under a bloomin' foreigner. Rather
a queer egg. He is no longer with me."</p>

<p>"Mean you fired Toughy Pound?" asked Denver.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes. But somewhat informally."</p>

<p>Denver chuckled. "It'd be Toughy's style to walk out on you. A
hard number."</p>

<p>"He didn't walk out," casually corrected Nightingale. "He
limped out. Rather a queer custom you have hereabouts as to
discharging people. He stated that he was loath to leave unless
bounced three times on the seat of his pants, and wouldn't I
kindly attempt to do same."</p>

<p>"And so you did?" queried Denver, grinning broadly.</p>

<p>The Englishman flicked the ashes off his cigarette. "Well,
y'know, if that is the custom of the country, it's naturally up
to me to oblige. Not so? Therefore, to make the ceremony quite
effective and proper, I bounced him four times. Now I need a new
foreman. I will cheerfully bend to your suggestions."</p>

<p>Denver studied the approaching rider. "You want a good man, a
man that understands the country and the cattle business. You
want a fellow able to swing the work of the ranch on his own hook
and also able to polish off any scissorbill puncher. Also, and
most important, you want a fellow who is proud enough to do his
job without unnecessary advice from you."</p>

<p>"Is there such a man?" asked Nightingale. "If so, I'll give
him the bloomin' ranch and go fishin'."</p>

<p>"Behold the man," said Denver, pointing to the advancing
Steers. "He looks good, and he's better than he looks."</p>

<p>Steve Steers jingled across the yard, casting an apprehensive
glance through Leverage's front door.</p>

<p>"You got a job," announced Denver. Steve's countenance
expressed dismay. "Shucks, Dave, I just had a job. Where's
Debbie?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, you homely bunchgrass biter," stated Denver
firmly, "this is a job. You are now foreman of Mr. Nightingale's
Bucket outfit. Your pay is eighty dollars. You run the ranch and
everybody that's on it, high, wide, and handsome. No
interference. I'm responsible for the suggestion, and, by golly,
you've got to sweat!"</p>

<p>"Accept the nomination," said Steve.</p>

<p>"Seems settled," remarked Nightingale calmly and rose to
depart. "Now, ah, Steve&mdash;should I ask a few questions around
my ranch or call on you for an occasional pony to ride, I trust I
shan't be considered as intrudin'." With that he galloped
off.</p>

<p>Eve and Debbie Lunt came from the house. Debbie went to her
waiting mount and was seated in the saddle before the ambling
Steve could get around to help her. She looked sweetly at him and
with equal sweetness remarked:</p>

<p>"You're a little late, Steve."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Debbie," he muttered.</p>

<p>Together they rode away, Steve looking straight ahead, the
girl stiffly erect and silent. Watching them depart, Eve shook
her head. "That sounded too much like Mrs. Jim and her husband.
Debbie's not wise to carry on so, and Steve's not wise to let
her."</p>

<p>"The girl's not bad," reflected Dave, "but she figures she's
got to hold the whip on a man to make him mind. One of these days
she'll slap him a little too hard."</p>

<p>Eve was surprised at his accurate knowledge of Deborah Lunt
and said so. "I'm afraid you know more about women than you
ought, Dave. You're staying to supper?"</p>

<p>"Wish I could. But the day's almost gone, and I want to look
at a stretch of country before it gets too dark." He got astride
his horse, half puzzled, half smiling. "Eve, you're like the
drink habit on a man. Seems like I always calm down and forget
the grief of a weary world when you're around."</p>

<p>She put an arm around a porch post and lifted her face; some
small breath of wind ruffled the curling hair at her temples, and
suddenly a foreboding anxiety lay darkly in her eyes. "David, it
is none of my business, but you are too strong a man not to have
enemies. No matter how aloof you try to keep from the quarrel in
Yellow Hill, you will always be in danger. I know how you feel.
Dad's told me. And I'm not trying to change your mind. All I say
is you never will be able to keep free of trouble&mdash;and I
wish you would be a little more careful. These last few months I
have had a horrible feeling of things about to happen."</p>

<p>"I know," he agreed slowly. "And I hate to see your dad makin'
a target out of himself for other people. But remember this, Eve:
No matter how much I keep away from this business, I'm always
ready to help the Leverage family. If anything should happen to
your dad I'd never sleep until I found the man who was
responsible for it. I don't agree with the vigilante business,
and sometimes I actually can sympathize with these poor fools
makin' a living by stealing beef. But there's a line none of them
can step over, as far as I'm concerned. If they do, then I'll be
ridin'. Not with any committee, but on my own account."</p>

<p>"You don't have to tell me," said she. "I have known it a long
time. It's a queer thing to say, but sometimes at night I have
the feeling that you are not far away&mdash;out in the night
somewhere, taking care of us."</p>

<p>He looked sharply at her. "How long have you been thinking
that?" was his quick question.</p>

<p>"Oh, for the last three or four nights. Why?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Just wondered. See you later." Raising his
hat he cantered away. Eve rested against the post and watched him
go, with grave attention. Long after, when he reached the high
bend of the road and was about to swing from sight, he turned and
lifted an arm; and she answered the farewell hail with quick
pleasure. As he disappeared the last ray of sun drew away from
the hills, and purple twilight shaded the land. She turned
inside.</p>

<p>Dave Denver did not go directly home. Instead he paced along
the curving road for a few miles and left it to climb a tall
ridge adjoining. From the summit he commanded a good view of the
cupped-in pockets and the narrow valleys roundabout. Here was a
house, there a bunch of cattle, and occasionally a rider questing
down some trail. Yet as high up as he was he could not gain a
clear sweep of the hills; the broken land formed a thousand dark
and isolated patches, and ridges kept cutting in to shield
whatever went on yonder.</p>

<p>"Perfect layout for the wild bunch," reflected Denver.
"There's spots in this country yet unsurveyed and untouched."
Rolling a cigarette he considered Eve Leverage's last remark. The
intuitive truth in it had startled him; twice in the last few
nights he had made a night patrol around the Leverage section.
"Two things," he mused thoughtfully, "I never will understand if
I live to be a thousand. First, the whispers that cross this
country like light flashes. Second, the way of a woman's
mind."</p>

<p>There was but a brief interval of evening left him, and so he
brought his mind back to its original thought. To his right, or
east, ran the stage road; to his left and nine miles deeper in
this cut-up country, lay the Wells. At some point Redmain's
renegade riders, driving out of the Sky Peak country, had crossed
the highway and headed for the evil shell of a town that was
their stronghold. He wanted to find the marks of their path to
satisfy his own curiosity and to answer a question slowly forming
in his head.</p>

<p>"They were out on a hunt the other evenin'," he murmured.
"What did they take home with 'em? I might hit straight for the
Dome and look around; but I doubt if they'd return the same way
they came. That'd require too much ridin' on the stage road. My
guess is they cut over more southerly."</p>

<p>He pushed his horse down the rather steep slope and presently
was threading a tortuous trail that undulated from draw to ridge
and down into draw again. Rather roughly he paralleled the stage
road, curving as it curved, and all the while watching the soft
ground beneath. At every mark of travel he stopped to study and
reject it, and so pressed on until the waning light warned him.
Thereupon he abandoned the patient method and made a swift guess.
"If I was leadin' that bunch and on my way to the Wells I'd use
the alley of Sweet Creek&mdash;providin' I was bashful about
bein' seen."</p>

<p>Sweet Creek was on another tangent. He ran down a draw,
crossed the succeeding ridge via a meadow-like notch, and veered
his course. The tendrils of dusk were curling rapidly through the
trees and the ravines were awash with cobalt shadows. The breeze
stiffened; far up on the stage road he heard the groaning of
brake blocks; then he was confronted with fresh tracks in the
yielding earth. He reined in.</p>

<p>The tracks were made by a solitary beef followed by a lone
rider; they led out of the west&mdash;out of the Wells
direction&mdash;and seemed headed toward the east. This he
considered slowly. His own range was just over the stage road,
and from all indications one of his own riders had found a stray
and was pushing it back to proper territory. "But who would that
be?" Denver asked himself. "All the boys are workin' the
Copperhead side today."</p>

<p>He changed his mind about reaching Sweet Creek and pursued the
tracks as they went upward, crossed the road, and kept on. A
freighter's lantern winked from a hairpin turn of the road above
him; a creek purled and gurgled down the hillside. It was dark
then, and he had lost all clear sight of the spoor he was
tracing, but he kept going and never hesitated until there came a
place in the ravine where the trail forked. Dismounting, he
struck a match and cupped it to the earth. Rider and cow had
turned north; and north was the way to his own D Slash
quarters.</p>

<p>"Must be one of the boys," he decided. "But who the devil's
been straying away off here? If it ain't that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pungent odors told him he was not far behind the preceding
rider. Another mile, and he caught a faint sound in the
thickening fog. Reaching a high point, he had the wide mouth of
Starlight Canyon looming beside him; and at the head of that long
sweeping space were the blinking lights of his house. The sound
of advance travel was more distinct; in fact, it seemed to
approach him rather than follow ahead. Puzzled, he kept a steady
pace, not wishing to draw too swiftly upon one of his own riders.
In the darkness D Slash men were apt to be ticklish; he had
taught them to be so.</p>

<p>The rider seemed to be having trouble with his stray. The lash
of a quirt arrived distinctly, followed by a grunt of anger.
Brush cracked; quite without warning, cow and rider were dead
ahead. A horse whinnied.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" drawled Denver.</p>

<p>"What the hell&mdash;!"</p>

<p>A warning chill pricked at Denver's scalp. He announced his
name abruptly and pulled off the trail, then called again: "Who
are you?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; "THE SKY IS THE
LIMIT"</h2>

<p class="first">FOR answer he had the smash of a gunshot and the
flicker of muzzle light. The stray cow plunged deeper into the
brush. A second shot cracked his ears; and the weaving outline of
the unknown man came against him, striking him flank and flank.
An arm reached out and slashed at his coat, and for a moment
there was nothing but an aimless snarl of two horses bucking free
of each other and two men coming to grips. Denver's gun was out;
the unknown man pulled free and fired as Denver opened up. The
man screamed, and Denver saw his form sprawl out of the saddle
and strike ground, horse's feet plunging over him.</p>

<p>Denver jumped down and approached, hearing a mighty suction of
breath. After that silence fell; when he lit a match he saw a
dead man's face glaring up from the earth.</p>

<p>"Redmain rider," grunted Denver tonelessly. The trail quivered
with men racing out from home quarters. He stepped back and
waited until they were within hailing distance. Then called,
"Hold on, boys."</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"Ran into a snag. One of the wild bunch is on the ground here.
Look around the brush. He was driving a beef up the trail, and I
overtook him. I want to look at that beef."</p>

<p>They rounded the stray from the underbrush. Somebody closed in
and dropped a loop about the brute's neck. Denver went over and
lit a match, looking for the brand. When the light went out he
was swearing disgustedly at himself. "Why in the devil didn't I
take a tumble to that half an hour ago? It's a plant. They've
took one of Fee's critters and blotched my mark on it."</p>

<p>"Mighty awkward job," opined one of the men. "Too poor a
switch to fool anybody. Who is that fella?"</p>

<p>"Some stranger," said Denver. "Redmain's got a whole bunch of
new hands in his string this year. Pick him up and bring him to
the house."</p>

<p>"Then what, Dave?"</p>

<p>Denver was racing for quarters, the power of speech lost to
him. All that cool control which had carried him like a machine
through the encounter was gone. The black devils of his temper
clutched at his throat, poured fury through his veins, and made
of him a mad conscienceless killer. It stripped him of every last
kindly instinct, it tore away his sense of safety, it made the
muscles of his body tremble as in a spasm of pain. So he flung
himself off his horse and ran up the porch, not the David Denver
of normal life, not the responsible ranchman, nor the drawling
figure welcomed by men and loved by women. Not any of these now.
Tonight the dominant, long repressed instincts rode him
unmercifully. Tonight he was Black Dave Denver.</p>

<p>The blurred face of a hand appeared in his pathway. He swept
the man aside, he ripped out an order&mdash;"Get my saddle on the
gray gelding"&mdash;and tramped across the living room to where a
rack of guns stood. He unbuckled his belt and threw it aside; and
from a high peg he took down another belt and another gun. This
he hooked around him, lifting the weapon from its seat, throwing
out the cylinder and spinning it beneath the flare of those flame
flecked violet eyes.</p>

<p>There was a spell in that smoothly whirling metal that checked
the restlessness in him. For a long period of time he held the
gun in his hand, absorbed by the sinister beauty of it, eyes
running the barrel and touching the worn wood that had felt the
grip of his father before him as well as his own. It was an
instrument of last resort, that gun, and its muzzle had spoken
sentence in more than one trial of wills. This night Black Dave
Denver meant it to so speak again. With that thought he thumbed
in six cartridges, snapped the cylinder home, and dropped the
weapon lightly in its seat. Once or twice he lifted and settled
it, then turned the belt somewhat farther around. After that he
turned for the door. His foreman stood in the way, cautiously yet
stubbornly.</p>

<p>"We'll ride too," said Lyle Bonnet.</p>

<p>"You will get out of my road and stay out of it," snapped
Denver.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll foller."</p>

<p>"Stay behind."</p>

<p>"Listen, Dave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you what to do," said Denver. The foreman dropped his
glance and retreated. Denver strode to his horse, spurred up the
slope and down the trail he had just used, dipping into the
canyon and skirting the melody-making creek. At the road he swung
up the grade, gelding bunching beneath him; somewhere beyond the
summit of that particular ridge and in the utter darkness of the
night he entered a dismal side path and tipped downward. This
went west, clinging secretively to the pines and the remote
holes. Sweet Creek curved out of the unfathomed mystery,
paralleled Denver a mile, and then fell off, declining the
upthrust of another ridge that seemed to cast a more impenetrable
shadow into the world.</p>

<p>As he rode, going ever deeper into this wild land, he began to
collect himself. The first wild burst of passion wore away, the
fog of the night cut through and released his overwhelmed
critical faculties. Thus in a measure he lost some of that savage
desire to trample down and smash whoever was responsible for the
attempt to plant a switched brand on him. Not that his desire to
settle the matter was in anywise abated; but some of the urgency
of that desire fell away. Rather critically he surveyed his
course.</p>

<p>All roads led to the Wells, and all this night activity
emanated from the mind of one man&mdash;Lou Redmain's. Yet it was
conceivable that some other outlaw, working under the shadow of
Redmain's reputation, might have tried to plant the cow. It was
also conceivable that some far greater and hitherto unsuspected
authority lay behind the act. Denver had nothing to substantiate
the latter belief, but it had been working in his mind since the
inception of the vigilantes. Impalpable, without a shadow of fact
or incriminating deed, it was but another of those whispering
hints running abreast the wind.</p>

<p>"Somebody, disliking me and knowing my temper," he reflected,
"might have planted the cow. Figuring that if the vigilantes
found it I'd be hooked, or figuring that if I discovered it first
I'd make a play right square into Redmain. And that's what I'm
about to do."</p>

<p>The factor upsetting this idea was that one of Redmain's men
had been with the cow. Yet even Redmain could not count on the
utter loyalty of all his followers. Intrigue undermined every
faction, honest and dishonest.</p>

<p>Contradictory impressions came from all sides. There was no
clear path out of the tangled web; and Denver, understanding this
in his more logical state of mind, came to a decision.</p>

<p>"Whoever is behind it, Redmain or another, I reckon I won't be
fool enough to bust into a set play. Better to unravel this
business before swallowin' bait. That cow is just one small item
in some damned sight bigger plan of things."</p>

<p>The trail reached a crest and a blank wall of trees. At right
angles to it ran a broader alley through the forest&mdash;the
north and south Henry trail. Denver halted and put an ear against
the wind. After several moments he left the saddle and ran his
hands across the earth, feeling innumerable churned indentations
of travel. Not yet satisfied, he retreated a distance on the
Sweet Creek trace, got a match, and knelt close to the earth; the
exploding flare of light broke the pall but a brief instant and
was whipped out, yet in that length of time he had seen cattle
and pony tracks mixed together.</p>

<p>Crouched there he made his judgment. "They went toward
Copperhead the other night, took a bunch of stock and brought it
back here. They're up yonder in some lonesome and godforsaken
hole right now. Lorn Rue got too close to that spot, was killed,
and packed off. Now if I could poke my way into that
mess&mdash;"</p>

<p>He threw the inclination aside and resumed his saddle,
striking north on the Henry trail. Forty-five minutes later he
came down a slashed hillside and was met by a few dull lights
shining out of grotesquely huddled buildings. Presently he had
arrived at the end of a curving street along which eight or nine
forlorn and shaken structures faced each other, each seeming
about to slide off the steep slope. This was the Wells, once a
flush mining camp but now the nest of malcontents. A dreary, evil
spot with a pervading gloom hanging over it. Denver's eyes roamed
the street, seeing shadows detach themselves from odd apertures
and slide off. Pressing his lips together, he aimed in, arrived
at a breast-high porch and stepped over to it. Out of cracked and
grimy windows flickered dim lights, and through a set of swinging
doors floated a mixture of harsh sounds and unlovely smells. The
sounds began to fall off, chairs scraped, and somebody ran across
a squeaking floor. When he pushed the doors aside a still, quiet
scene was before him.</p>

<p>He never previously had paid the Wells a visit; nor was he
prepared for the drab, lackluster sullenness of this saloon. All
lights were pitched low, and the flutter of untrimmed wicks gave
to the fetid, smoke-ridden atmosphere a palpitating uneasiness. A
long bar ran across one end of the room; the rest of it held a
stove, many chairs, and a few decrepit tables. In this space
Denver's swift observation noted about thirty people, a half
dozen of which were women. And behind the bar stood a coal-black
giant whose palms pressed the weight of his torso downward on the
mahogany while he blinked at Denver. One of the women laughed,
the sound like a slap in Denver's face. He stepped aside and
spoke to the barkeep.</p>

<p>"Send for Redmain."</p>

<p>The barkeep held his answer for a long, insolent minute. "He
ain't here."</p>

<p>"You lie," said Denver evenly. "His horse stands outside. Send
for him."</p>

<p>"If you know so much, go get him y'self, mister."</p>

<p>"Tell him Dave Denver is down here and proposes to see
him."</p>

<p>The barkeep held his tongue. A girl slipped quietly out of a
door, and such was the silence that the noise of her heels going
up some invisible stairway echoed blankly back. The thick,
miasmatic breath of hostility rose all around him; he saw their
eyes glittering on him, he saw the predatory hunger of their
desire. Yet they said nothing and he stood posted against the
wall until another door opened and Lou Redmain came quietly
in.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Dave," said the man, triangular face blurred
in the haze.</p>

<p>"I reckon this is the chief's palace and these gentlemen and
ladies his principal people," observed Denver.</p>

<p>Redmain let the bite of that sarcasm go by unnoticed. "For my
purpose," said he softly, "they do me very well."</p>

<p>"One of 'em didn't," stated Denver, an increasing chill in his
words. "One of them ran a misbranded Fee cow onto my range and
made a bad job of it. He's of no further use to you."</p>

<p>The room began to rustle with repressed talk. "Bury the fool,
and I'll do you a return favor some day," said Redmain, still
unmoved.</p>

<p>Some of the heedless, reckless anger rose again in Denver. "Am
I to understand you're accepting the responsibility for that act,
Redmain?"</p>

<p>Redmain moved across the room. "Listen, Dave," he answered:
"there are considerable people who'd like to see either one of us
out of the road. Be pretty easy, wouldn't it, for any such person
to rig a thing like this?"</p>

<p>"He was your man."</p>

<p>"And if he was alive I'd kill him!" exclaimed Redmain, letting
go. The slim body swayed. "I gave you my word in Sundown I'd stay
clear of you! I meant that!"</p>

<p>"It was a Fee cow," added Denver.</p>

<p>Redmain's face shifted expression rapidly.</p>

<p>"Don't miss much, do you? Well, what if I have got some Fee
cows? I ain't got all of them. That critter could have come from
any other direction as well as from my territory."</p>

<p>"Could but didn't," was Denver's terse reply. "It came out of
this country."</p>

<p>Redmain stood silent, studying Denver closely. Presently he
shook his head. "That too is possible. I won't say I can trust
every man I've got. You know and I know that none of us can see
everything going on around here. From now on neither you nor I
can prevent cross plays. It won't get any better. It'll get
worse. Men are after me. And whether you know it or not, men are
after you. I have never been on your trail, and I repeat I never
will be on it."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I know your limit," said Denver
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I've got no limit. The sky's my limit."</p>

<p>"When a man talks like that," Denver shot back, "he draws the
line nowhere. And he'll respect nothing."</p>

<p>Redmain's face darkened. "You've got my word," he repeated. "I
recall you drank with me when no other cattleman in this county
would be seen in the same saloon with me."</p>

<p>"Let it be so," agreed Denver. "I came here to tell you,
however, that I am fully prepared to take care of myself and my
interests. If the time comes when your interests run counter to
mine then I can no longer stand aside."</p>

<p>"We will never fight over that," interposed Redmain
quickly.</p>

<p>But Denver broke bluntly through. "At your rate of speed it's
entirely possible we may lock horns."</p>

<p>"I should hate to see that day come."</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not. Men change; times change. I came here to
let you know exactly how I stand on the subject. One more thing,
Lou. If Leverage goes down and you are back of it, neither heaven
nor hell will be big enough for both of us."</p>

<p>"I doubt if heaven will see either of us. Hell is big enough
for all."</p>

<p>Their talk dropped suddenly off and tension of their meeting
began to oppress all others in the room to the point of
restlessness. Moments dragged by, the rugged and powerful Denver
looking down at Redmain's slighter figure with a driving
intentness the outlaw had never before experienced. Then Denver
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"If you disclaim responsibility for that business," was his
final word, "I'll accept it. I'm not joinin' the pack against you
because there's something tellin' me most of the time that but
for a turn of the card I might be in your shoes and you in mine.
However, when a man flies high, he covers considerable
territory&mdash;sometimes other people's. Consider it, Lou."</p>

<p>Redmain stood at the swinging doors, watching Denver pass out
and ride from the street. A pallor crept around his mouth and
nostrils and some dreadful storm of feeling shook him
terrifically. He turned on his heels, half ran across the room,
ripped open an inner door, and paused only to lift one hand at a
loitering henchman. The man came quickly into the half dark
hall.</p>

<p>"Go after him!" breathed Redmain.</p>

<p>"Get him, yuh mean."</p>

<p>"No, damn you, follow him! See where he goes!"</p>

<p>"Why not get him, chief?"</p>

<p>"Because I told you not to! Because I am not ready! Because I
don't want him killed around my territory! Get out of here!" And,
still shaken, he passed up the stairs to his room and tramped
around it endlessly while the rising clamor from the saloon came
brokenly to him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; JUDICIAL
MEASURES</h2>

<p class="first">"IF yuh want to see somethin' rich, ripe, and
rare," proclaimed Steve Steers, bursting into Grogan's, "come
over to the courthouse."</p>

<p>This being on a Saturday afternoon, Grogan's was crowded and
lively. The gentlemen to whom Steve addressed his
remarks&mdash;Denver, Steele, and the Englishman&mdash;were
considering the state of the nation at one corner of the bar, a
bottle conveniently disposed at their elbows.</p>

<p>"Nothing less than murder could interest anybody in Yellow
Hill these days," replied Cal Steele amiably. "Have a drink and
forget your sorrows."</p>

<p>"It's Fleabite Wilgus and his hoss," said Steve.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so in the first place?" drawled Denver. By
common consent the four of them grouped together and left the
saloon. Just outside all stepped aside and lifted their hats.
Lola Monterey walked past with a red parasol bobbing over her jet
hair; and her eyes, smiling impartially on them, came to
temporary rest on Dave.</p>

<p>"Supper at five, David."</p>

<p>He grinned. "I'll be there, Lola."</p>

<p>She passed on, and the men cut over to the courthouse, Cal
Steele grumbling. "How do you rate that, Mister Denver? Seems to
me the wicked have all the fun. Going to the dance?"</p>

<p>"Never heard about it."</p>

<p>"You will," prophesied Cal Steele. "It's next week at the
Copperhead school. Figure out which woman you're takin' so I can
ask the other."</p>

<p>They walked through the courthouse door and turned into the
judge's chamber, half filled with spectators. Crowding against
the wall, they saw Fleabite Wilgus leap to his feet and interrupt
a line of legal palaver. "I'm dummed if I make head er tail to
this. The true facts is, that's my horse and I mean to have
it."</p>

<p>"Keep your pants on," admonished John Coke, judge of Sundown's
justice court. "You're paying attorney fees to Langdell, so let
him do the talking. Now, Tuggs..."</p>

<p>Tuggs was an unhappy and impoverished appearing little man
past the prime of life. He moved his warped and calloused hands
rather helplessly around. "Well, they ain't much more to it,
Judge. I come to town and let my rig stand. When I walked outa
the New York Store Wilgus had unhitched my hoss and was leadin'
him away."</p>

<p>"My horse," said Wilgus in a subterranean mutter.</p>

<p>Tuggs swallowed and said nothing. Niland, who was representing
him, said, "All right, Tuggs. Go on. What then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I walks up to Wilgus and I says, 'Fleabite, you got no
call to monkey with other people's proputty that away. Gimme my
hoss.' I took holt of the headstall. Fleabite says, 'Git away,
it's my hoss!' Fleabite then belts me in the face and takes the
hoss away. So I had him arrested."</p>

<p>"A pretty pass," fumed Fleabite Wilgus, "when a skinny, no-
account runt like him can arrest a man able to buy him out ten
thousand times over. Ain't there no decent respeck fer social
standin' in this here community?"</p>

<p>Langdell frowned at his client and said, "Shush, you ain't
helpin' yourself." Facing the judge, he added, "Why carry it on?
Wilgus will admit he struck Tuggs and take the fine. In so far as
the horse is concerned, that's another case. If Tuggs will not
admit the animal to be Wilgus's horse, then we will start
replevin proceedings."</p>

<p>The judge leaned forward and nodded at Wilgus. "What makes you
think this to be your horse?"</p>

<p>Wilgus got up, a shambling, ragged man for all his wealth in
land and cattle. All about him was the air of narrow sharpness.
He spoke in a falsetto whine. "Well, they ain't nothin' to it. I
missed that horse four years ago and never heard of him since
till this mornin' when I saw Tuggs come to town. I spoke to Tuggs
about it, but he wouldn't give me no satisfaction. I will admit
bein' a little hasty, but it's my horse."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interposed Niland. "You missed that horse
four years ago? Now you run a pretty big horse ranch. How many of
the brutes have passed through your hands in those four
years?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say," mumbled Wilgus evasively. "Mebbe three-four
thousand."</p>

<p>"And you maintain you recognized this particular horse out of
four thousand, over an interval of four years?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Wilgus. "I never forgot a horse's face. Anyhow,
that was a particular horse. Sentiment attached to it. I
nourished that horse, I loved him like a pet."</p>

<p>Denver leaned near the Englishman, chuckling. "He'd sell his
grandmother down the river. Sentiment&mdash;shucks."</p>

<p>"What's all this got to do with an assault and battery case?"
protested Langdell. "Let's have the fine. We'll go into the other
matter later."</p>

<p>"I'm interested," said his honor. "I know Wilgus, I know
Tuggs, and I have recollections of the horse. This being a court
of first resort I consider it no less than my duty to go so far
afield as necessary in any case to prevent subsequent litigation.
Why should we embrace the thought of replevin when a simple face-
to-face parley might do away with such action? Tuggs, you
maintain it is your horse. Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I bought it from a trader," said Tuggs. "He ain't in the
country any more. That was two years ago. Maybe he's got a Wilgus
brand. Most hosses around here have. But he's got other brands
likewise. I paid money for the beast. He's mine."</p>

<p>"Hm," said the judge. "Sheriff, bring in the horse."</p>

<p>"Oh, now," protested Langdell, "he'll kick hell out of the
furniture."</p>

<p>The judge considered the objection briefly and ruled it out.
"Speaking from personal recollection of Tuggs's horse I would say
that if the beast is able to kick hell out of this court's
furniture, then he is not the horse I think he is. Bring him in,
Ortez."</p>

<p>Ortez, the sheriff, departed. In a little while the courtroom
heard a hollow, stumbling clatter, followed by the sheriffs
pleading voice. "Come on, boy, this ain't goin' to be hard.
Listen, you condemned lost soul, hold up yore head! Yeah, now
lift yore foot. Quit leanin' on me&mdash;yore supposed to be the
horse, not me! Well, I know yore tired, but what the hell am I to
do about it? Henry&mdash;Henry, for God's sake come over here and
get this damned brute off my chest!"</p>

<p>Presently Ortez came perspiring into the chamber, dragging a
long rope. Next in order was Henry, also hauling on the rope. And
finally Tuggs's horse limped through the door. Undoubtedly he was
a tired horse. Planting his feet wide apart he rolled his jaded
eyes and fetched a dismal groan. He was a wrinkled horse, a sway-
backed horse, a horse that embodied every disgraceful thing a
horse should not be. His ears flopped limply, his knees
interfered, and his lips quivered as if he were about to burst
out crying. Practically the only sign of life he displayed to the
incredulous courtroom was to sway toward the wall with the
presumable intent of leaning against it. Ortez warned the court
glumly.</p>

<p>"If you want any testimony from this horse yuh better take it
quick. I got to git him out of here afore he dies on me."</p>

<p>"That brings up a debatable point of fact," reflected Niland.
"Is he a horse?"</p>

<p>"Well," grunted Ortez, "they's horses and they's horses. This
is still another kind of horse."</p>

<p>"He must have been born old," added Niland. "Makes me tired to
look at him."</p>

<p>"If he were able to sit," said the court, "I'd offer him a
chair. Tuggs, is this the animal you use as a beast of
burden?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's all right," muttered Tuggs. "When I got him
hitched to a load on a level stretch I can ride in the wagon too.
Of course, I have to favor him a little. When we hit a mite of a
grade I walk. If the grade gets steep I push. I got to have a
horse, don't I?"</p>

<p>"What seems to be the record as to brands?" inquired the
court.</p>

<p>Ortez shook his head. "If there's any outfit which ain't put
their brand on this horse durin' the past thirty years I fail to
detect the absence. He's a walkin' directory."</p>

<p>Denver walked to the beast and ran his hand over one scarred
side. Cattleland brands its beef stock freely and without regard
for appearances, but a horse is marked as little as possible.
Starting just above the stifle, the customary branding spot,
Denver began to unravel the story of this jaded charger's
peregrinations. He had been a Fee horse, he had stayed a while
with Gallant at Flying G. Thence he had moved&mdash;all this
registered in burns that wandered up from stifle to hip and
thence outward along the flank&mdash;through Three Pines, Hogpen,
Double Ought, Thirty Ranch, Bar Y, Broken Jug, XL, Lazy UT, and
the Gate brand of Wilgus. Nor was there any order in the
arrangement of brands. They crowded together, overlapped, doubled
up&mdash;proving anything or nothing.</p>

<p>"Denver," called the court, "I'll designate you as expert
witness. What's your impression?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interposed Ortez. "There's two sides to a
horse. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Come over and read some
more."</p>

<p>Denver walked around the animal and chuckled. "My first
impression is that if there's any more branding to be done on
this horse you'll have to get another horse. All I can say now in
regard to the specimen before me is that he's better than sixteen
years old."</p>

<p>"Now, now," cut in Wilgus, "he ain't a day over twelve. He
just looks a little tired, that's all."</p>

<p>"Beg to differ. They quit using the Lazy UT brand sixteen
seasons ago. This horse has been places and seen things. In fact,
he's practically an original passenger of the Ark."</p>

<p>The horse leered at Denver's coat buttons, nibbled on one in a
spasmodic burst of energy, and sneezed. Ortez evidenced
alarm.</p>

<p>"Y'honor, this horse ain't himself at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was he ever?" interrupted Niland.</p>

<p>"&mdash;the crowd excites him. The air is bad. I got to get
this horse outa here. Henry, lend a hand."</p>

<p>Niland rose. "Considering the fact that ownership is going to
be difficult to determine, why not settle reasonably? Let Wilgus
make an offer for the horse. Tuggs would accept rather than go
through a long suit. If we could establish a fair
price&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This has got nothing to do with assault and battery,"
repeated Langdell.</p>

<p>"The mills of the gods grind exceedingly small," said the
judge. "If you're determined to get the assault and battery end
of it over with I'll oblige. Wilgus is fined twenty-five dollars.
Now let's see about this offer of sale. Wilgus wants the horse.
Tuggs will sell. Niland has suggested a price."</p>

<p>"Including rope and halter?" asked Langdell.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Niland. "A rope and halter represents
around six dollars. Are you buying hardware or horse? I offer the
horse as is, without gear, delivered on the streets of
Sundown."</p>

<p>"He might run away," objected Langdell.</p>

<p>The court frowned heavily on the attorney. "Mr. Langdell,
don't let your wild fancy get the best of you. Did you ever hear
of the horse running? Can you produce any living being who saw or
thought he saw in the aforementioned horse any inkling of a
desire to run away, either impulsively or after due deliberation?
Just what evidence can you adduce to prove that this horse is
even familiar with the act of running?"</p>

<p>Out of the crowd came a hollow assent. "True, brother."</p>

<p>"Well," considered Langdell, "we might go so far as to make an
offer&mdash;if you agree to deliver the horse at the Wilgus
ranch."</p>

<p>"Now, now," scoffed Niland. "It's eleven miles to that ranch.
I refuse to embark on any such hazardous experiment. The horse is
in delicate health."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, get together," adjured the court. "I think you
ought to make an attempt to strike an equitable balance."</p>

<p>Langdell whispered to Wilgus and came to a sudden decision.
"Very well. Give us five dollars, Niland, and we'll take the
horse off your hands."</p>

<p>Niland threw up his arms in disgust. "Have you forgotten the
horse is valuable?"</p>

<p>"For what?" jeered Langdell.</p>

<p>"Your client says so."</p>

<p>Wilgus half rose. "Sentimentally, understand. I wouldn't go so
fur as to say it was anything else."</p>

<p>Niland conferred with Tuggs. "Tuggs," he announced, "is ready
to let Wilgus give him twenty dollars cash or another sound horse
such as this one."</p>

<p>Langdell raised an unbelieving eyebrow; and even the court
seemed rather dashed. Rumors of difficulty drifted into the hall
of justice. The sheriff had piloted the horse as far as those
difficult steps and now was audibly preparing for the worst.
"Henry, don't stand down there thataway. If he starts a-goin' too
fast he'll crush yuh."</p>

<p>"Let's take him down rump first," suggested Henry.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! He'll break his back."</p>

<p>"All right. Head first she is."</p>

<p>"That ain't so good either. He's apt to bust his neck."</p>

<p>This defeated Henry; he grew sarcastic. "Hell's afire, how
many ways yuh think a horse can come downstairs? Listen, I'll get
a pint of oats and hold it here. That'll move him."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! You want this horse to faint right here?"</p>

<p>"Aw," exploded Henry, "give him a push and see what happens!"
The courtroom gathered that Henry was walking away, for the
sheriffs plaintive remonstrance rose to heaven.</p>

<p>"Now, Henry, don't leave me like this. I'm holdin' him up, and
I ain't able to let go!"</p>

<p>Wilgus rose from his seat. "You fellows are makin' a lot of
monkey business out of this deal. That's my horse, and I mean to
have him."</p>

<p>"You won't consider settlin' it?" queried Niland.</p>

<p>"I ain't a-goin' to pay a penny for what's already mine,"
stated Wilgus. "I'll allow he ain't pretty and couldn't drag a
feather, but it's the principle of the thing. If I got to sue to
get him, that's what I'm a-goin' to do."</p>

<p>"The province of the court is to see justice done," said the
judge, eyeing Wilgus. "Arbitration having failed, we shall now
see whose pound of flesh is whose. This is your legal right. Do
you intend to bring action?"</p>

<p>Wilgus muttered to Langdell, and the lawyer spoke for him. "We
do."</p>

<p>Ortez limped into the courtroom.</p>

<p>"I leaned him against Grover's stable and left him," was the
sheriff's weary reply.</p>

<p>"How did you get him down the steps?"</p>

<p>"He fell down. And I hope I never lay eyes on him again."</p>

<p>The judge frowned. "It won't do, Sheriff. The court now orders
you to take charge of the horse, pending determination of
ownership. Take him to Grover's stable. See that he lacks for
absolutely nothing in the way of food, attention, whatever
medical services as may be deemed necessary. In short, watch over
him with charity and compassion. Plaintiff Wilgus will post the
necessary bond. Next case."</p>

<p>Niland came up to Denver with Tuggs ambling forlornly behind.
"That means I ain't goin' to get use of my horse?" he wanted to
know. "But I got to have a horse."</p>

<p>"Never mind," soothed Niland. "Strictly speaking, Tuggs, you
never had a horse. You had an aged companion. Things will come
out all right."</p>

<p>But Tuggs was miserably downcast. "What'm I goin' to do for a
horse? Here's my rig in the middle of the street."</p>

<p>They had left the courtroom and were standing on the steps.
Niland looked sympathetically at his client and lifted his eyes
to Denver. Denver suddenly beckoned to a passing citizen.
"Grover, step here a minute, will you?"</p>

<p>Grover, the owner of Sundown's stable, walked over. Denver
explained the situation. "Everybody's got a horse but Tuggs, and
you've got this for the time bein'. Just you haul out a good
twelve-hundred-pound gelding and back it into Tuggs's rig. I'll
have one of my men bring in another for you."</p>

<p>"Done," said Grover and walked away. Tuggs sputtered
ineffectually.</p>

<p>"It's yours," cut in Denver, "and say no more about it."</p>

<p>The crowd eddied around them, and Tuggs was carried away.
Fleabite Wilgus came out, muttering to himself. Steve Steers
walked toward the hotel with a harried glance. Al Niland was
chuckling. "Oh, this is going to be some case, Dave. It will go
down in history. I ain't even started yet."</p>

<p>"What the devil are you driving at, Al?"</p>

<p>Al pointed at the departing Wilgus. "As an attorney I aim to
get a square deal for Tuggs. As a human being I aim to give that
miserable man the biggest kick in the pants he ever never got and
should have had."</p>

<p>Cal Steele walked out with Langdell and beckoned the two.
"Come along with us, will you? I want some witnesses to a
deal."</p>

<p>The four proceeded past the Palace to the street's end,
circled the last building, and climbed to Langdell's office.
Langdell pulled down the shades against a beating sun, and
reached for the inevitable bottle and glasses.</p>

<p>"I am of the belief," he told Niland, "this is going to be a
drawn-out case."</p>

<p>"It is big with possibilities," Niland gravely assured him,
"and fraught with consequences that may echo down the corridors
of time."</p>

<p>"It is my suspicion you're going to leave no stone unturned,"
proceeded Langdell.</p>

<p>"If I find any stone unturned," Niland assured him, "I'll fire
the stone turner."</p>

<p>"Justice must be done," stated Langdell, lifting his
glass.</p>

<p>"We shall do justice and others," cheerfully acquiesced
Niland, and they drank. Langdell settled in his chair, very
slightly smiling.</p>

<p>"As attorney for my client, a most worthy man," he drawled
dryly, "I shall check you at every turn, match you witness for
witness, dollar for dollar."</p>

<p>"By George, that's fine!" exclaimed Niland. "You know damned
well I don't like you, and you don't like me. But, reserving that
state of mind for the present, I'll say you're sometimes halfways
human."</p>

<p>Langdell flushed. "I suppose we must all have our fun before
we die, Niland. As for disliking you, I seldom let anybody become
so large in my mind as to spend time wasting emotion on him."</p>

<p>"Hah!" grunted Niland, sarcasm creeping into his words. "Now
you're mounting the ivory pedestal again. You ought to let your
humor out for air more often."</p>

<p>Denver sat back and studied these men through half-lidded
eyes. Niland never minced his words and never failed to sting
Fear Langdell with those short jabs of reckless, cynical truth.
Langdell stared back at his opponent, mouth pressed grimly
together, stiffly resentful. These were two absolutely opposite
kinds of men. Denver understood the openhanded Niland very well;
understood and sympathized with his friend's impulsive kindliness
and sharp brain. But he had never yet penetrated that well-
guarded mask Colonel Fear Langdell threw in front of his mind.
There was, he felt, always some remote thought, some deep feeling
moving secretively in Langdell's body.</p>

<p>"Well," broke in Cal Steele, "you fellows are out of court, so
why fight? All I wanted you two for was to witness an agreement
Langdell and I have drawn up. I'm selling him three hundred and
fifty head of stock."</p>

<p>"Sign here," said Langdell, shoving the conveyance over the
table and indicating the appropriate place. Niland dashed off his
name hurriedly. Dave followed suit.</p>

<p>"Why don't you market your own beef?" he asked Steele.</p>

<p>"Langdell ships five times as much as I do," replied Steele,
lazily accepting Langdell's check. "So I find it easier to take a
profit this way than to do my own shipping. As a matter of fact,
I'm going to go over to a feeder business one of these days. Buy,
feed, and sell to a shipper like the Colonel here. Good
business."</p>

<p>"Good for you, good for me," agreed Langdell. "Any time you
want to dicker again let me know."</p>

<p>"I'll be around in maybe two months," said Cal Steele and got
up. Leaving Langdell in his office, the three went back to the
street. At Grogan's Steele tipped his head suggestively. "Let's
damp down the dust, boys."</p>

<p>"Leave me out of it," drawled Denver. "I've got further
business. And by the way of a parting benediction I will gently
suggest this is no time to drink."</p>

<p>"Go with God," murmured Cal Steele indolently. "Any time's
time to drink. Make up your mind about this girl proposition,
Dave. I'm second best man, either way, understand. Come on, Al.
You haven't got religion yet."</p>

<p>Niland followed Steele into the saloon, and they took their
familiar corner at the bar, broaching a bottle. Niland studied
his friend critically. "You," he announced, "are a fool. Why
stand aside in favor of Dave? You know he hasn't got his mind set
on Lola."</p>

<p>"How do I know it? How do you know it?" Steele's face settled
to unusual soberness. "Tell me that."</p>

<p>"I know it because I know Dave," replied Niland emphatically.
"Maybe he hasn't got his mind made up. Maybe he's thinkin' back
to the time when he and Lola were a little younger, a little
wilder and more headstrong. Maybe he's wondering. But I know what
the answer will be. He'll swing to his own kind. Lola's one
thing. Dave's another. At heart, Cal, you're more her style than
Dave is."</p>

<p>Steele looked shrewdly at Niland. "That's not a bad guess. How
much do you know about me, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Niland said quickly, "I never pry into a man's life. You know
that. I take you for granted."</p>

<p>"Hm," muttered Steele. For quite an interval the two men stood
still. Then Steele spoke, rather abruptly, rather sadly.
"Nevertheless, a man can't keep himself hidden, even if he sealed
his mouth. Every act exposes him. As far as Dave is concerned,
I'd rather cut off my neck than hurt him. So I stay away. You
heard me tell him I was a second-choice man, didn't you? Well, I
am. As far as he's involved. I'll be that as long as I
live&mdash;gladly."</p>

<p>He had touched some deep vein of thought. Downing his glass,
he went on. "Some men have the power of drawing others. Not very
many. Dave has. Look at us. I've got more education than he has.
You've got a mind that cuts deeper and farther into truth than he
has. But what of it? Dave is a better man than both of us put
together. Why? Because he never varies from that burning light of
conscience. He never strays from himself, never seems to falter.
Time and again I've seen him come against some tough problem and
decide one way or the other without flinching. He thinks he's a
skeptic, as we are; that's one reason he likes us so well. But he
could no more be the sort of purposeless fool that I am than fly
to Mars. There's an enormous force driving him straight
ahead."</p>

<p>"Which brings us to another item," grunted Niland, favoring
the bottle. "He's bound to drive straight into opposition at the
rate things are balling up in Yellow Hill. His neutral stand
leaves him high and dry&mdash;right out in the daylight to be
shot at."</p>

<p>Steele's fine face was tremendously sober and oddly set.
"Listen, the most damnable visions keep coming to me, night after
night. Faces staring at me from behind a bloody film. Sounds
nutty, doesn't it? I have risen from a solid sleep with the
horrible thing right in my eyes. I have heard shots, and men
groaning. Sometimes the film thins out, and I think I see one of
those faces and recognize it as my own. Sometimes I think I see
Dave. Sometimes Lou Redmain. But when I reach out and am just on
the point of identifying them, the bloody haze falls down."</p>

<p>"Cut that out," admonished Niland, "or I'll get the
willies."</p>

<p>Steele's eyes were blackly brooding. "I've always been a
fellow to take things as they came along. Never worrying much.
Life's always been pretty easy, pretty full of sunshine. But for
two months, night and day, I have felt as if I were drifting
along toward darkness. I keep looking around me, and the sun's
there, and the stars are there&mdash;the world's just the same as
it always was. But still that ungodly black curtain keeps coming
nearer and I'm heading for it. What's behind it&mdash;who
knows?"</p>

<p>"Stop that," said Niland sharply. "You know what you need? You
need to go over to the Palace, get one of the girls to sit beside
you, and then drink hard."</p>

<p>"It's been tried before," said Steele and pulled himself out
of his stark mood with visible effort. "The kind of forgetfulness
one buys at the Palace only lasts so long. Well, I was born with
a silver spoon in my mouth, and fair pastures were mine by
heritage. But my star is a restless one and sometimes dark in the
sky. The brightest spot in this little flicker of existence that
is me comes from knowing I am a friend of Dave's. What's the
matter with that bottle&mdash;leakin'?"</p>

<p>"The Palace is across the street and three doors down," said
Niland.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; DARK HUNGERS</h2>

<p class="first">A FAMILIAR horse stood by Durbin's hardware
store. Denver, stopping on the instant, ran his glance along the
street and discovered Lou Redmain. The outlaw was posted in the
mouth of an alley, his attention riveted on the hotel porch.
Denver drew aside from the eddy of the crowd and found what held
Redmain's interest. Eve Leverage sat in a porch rocker with
Debbie Lunt and Steve Steers beside her.</p>

<p>Even with fifty feet intervening, Denver caught a change in
Redmain's dark and pointed face. The formal indifference was gone
and in its stead was an utter absorption. Unaccountably it
reminded Denver of a time in early boyhood when he had left his
father's house, climbed a distant ridge, and saw for the first
time the sweeping vastness of the prairie. It came back to him
even now, that shock of surprise upon finding a world he had
never known about, never dreamed of. All of an afternoon he had
lain on his stomach, swelling with vague desires. And it seemed
to him that Lou Redmain, staring across the street, might be
going through a like turmoil of spirit.</p>

<p>Denver shook his head and felt a pity for the man. All that
Redmain stood for was repulsive and hateful to Eve Leverage. That
dusty street might as well be a thousand miles wide, so great was
the gulf separating the minds of these two. Redmain could never
cross it. And Denver knew that Redmain recognized the fact; he
also knew that to Redmain this was bitter knowledge.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," grunted Denver. "Here he is, built like the rest
of us, with the same stuff in him&mdash;and still he never will
belong. And what makes the hurt still worse is to realize that
but for his own folly he might have been the kind of a fellow Eve
would like."</p>

<p>Thinking this, Denver was considerably jarred to see Redmain
suddenly square himself in the alley and walk straight for the
porch. He got to the steps and whipped off his hat before Eve saw
him. Steve Steers rose. Then Eve nodded her head, neither
friendly nor unfriendly. Denver caught himself from going
forward.</p>

<p>"Here, here, this is no better than eavesdroppin'. None of my
business." Turning, he went to the bank.</p>

<p>To Eve the meeting came with sharp unexpectedness. It was
impossible for her to like Lou Redmain. She abhorred outlawry as
only a woman can whose menfolk are exposed to the dangers of
outlaw violence. The black hints surrounding Redmain made her
shudder. Yet she met the situation with cool detachment,
inclining her head at this strange visitor whose eyes seemed to
burn into her. The wind ruffled his hair as he stood soldierlike
on the steps. Steve Steers cleared his throat impatiently, but
Redmain never noticed Steve.</p>

<p>"A pleasant day," said he, and Eve was surprised at the supple
melody of his voice.</p>

<p>"It has been nice," she replied.</p>

<p>He seemed to listen to her words rather than to the meaning of
them; and she felt the almost hungry impact of his glance. It
made her flush a little. Steve was quite still. Debbie held
herself scornfully back.</p>

<p>"I have been looking for your father," went on Lou Redmain.
"Will you tell him I have seen some of his strays away up behind
Sharon Springs?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Eve. "And I know he'd want me to thank you for
mentioning it."</p>

<p>"I already have my reward, Miss Eve."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Talking to you," he answered, inclining his head.</p>

<p>"It seems a slim reward to me," she reflected.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It is not possible for you to know what
things a lonely man finds pleasure in."</p>

<p>She let the silence pile up. Redmain shifted. "Doubtless you
will be going to the dance."</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>He appeared to brace himself, to take a deeper breath. "If I
came, I wonder if you might find it possible out of the kindness
of your heart to give me a dance."</p>

<p>She met the question squarely, holding his eyes. "I'm sorry,
Mr. Redmain, but I wouldn't want to. And I don't mean to hurt
your feelings."</p>

<p>He took the rejection impassively. "A man should never ask too
much of a world that gives very little." Then rather gently he
added, "You have not hurt my feelings. I quite understand."
Raising his hat, he turned quickly and walked away toward the
east end of town.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Debbie, "I should have slapped his face!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that," rebuked Eve, looking troubled. But the
trouble left her the next moment when Denver swung up to the
steps and took a chair. She wrinkled her nose at him. "I have
been advertising myself on this porch for one hour, David. What's
wrong with my charm?"</p>

<p>He chuckled. "Would have come earlier, but I saw somebody else
answerin' the ad, so I waited."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you come and break into it?" Debbie
asked.</p>

<p>"Like to give every man a chance," drawled Denver.</p>

<p>"Do you think he had much chance?" demanded Eve.</p>

<p>"No-o, but the poor fellow needs a little sunshine now and
then."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Debbie, "I think the men of this county are
scared to death of Lou Redmain."</p>

<p>Eve grew impatient. "Debbie, you can say more foolish, unwise
things!"</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Debbie, "everybody knows he's an outlaw, and
yet he walks into town like he owned it. Why isn't he
arrested?"</p>

<p>"Lack of proof," murmured Denver. "One of the funny things
about justice is you've got to establish guilt before you can
punish. On that score, Redmain's as free as the birds of
passage."</p>

<p>"Everybody knows he's guilty," said Debbie. "That's
enough."</p>

<p>"So you've joined the vigilantes," grinned Denver. But he
sobered quickly. "I doubt if he is ever arrested. I doubt if
Sundown jail ever sees him. He'll go like all outlaws
go&mdash;rough and sudden, out in the hills."</p>

<p>"Something ought to be done," insisted Debbie, not to be
shaken.</p>

<p>"Something will be done," Denver reassured her. "And the
result may surprise you as well as shock you."</p>

<p>"A large round fact and no mistake," chimed in Steve.</p>

<p>Debbie suppressed him with a single glance and rose. "Steve,
I'm going shopping. Come help me carry bundles." Denver watched
them depart with doubt on his face.</p>

<p>"She sure treats him rough, Eve."</p>

<p>"I think it's shameful. He stands everything from her."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Denver casually. "But there's just one thing
she doesn't know about Mister Stephen Burt Steers. When he
finally puts his foot down he does it firm enough to make the
welkin ring."</p>

<p>The two of them settled into comfortable silence, side by
side, while the sun slid to the west.</p>

<p>"Sunshine's nice," said he.</p>

<p>"But soon gone."</p>

<p>"Not while you're around, Eve."</p>

<p>"Sounds fishy," said Eve skeptically, "but I like it."</p>

<p>Lou Redmain went away from the hotel with clouded eyes. He
maintained a set face until, beyond the end of the street, he
swung to the north and climbed a wooded trail. And at that point,
no longer under inspection, he let the accumulated resentment
pour out of him.</p>

<p>"A pariah, an outcast! Not fit to be touched, not good enough
to be danced with! That is me&mdash;Lou Redmain! I could stand
hatred from her better than the pity she showed! Good God, am I
not a man like the rest? Haven't I got some decency in me she
could see and make allowances for? No, never! I took my trail,
and now I've got to travel it alone. I'm branded, and there is no
hope of change. Damn them all!"</p>

<p>Even then, swayed by fury, he looked cautiously about him and
ducked into a stand of pines. At the head of the trail stood a
small house, and he crept beside it guardedly until he saw Lola
Monterey standing in the kitchen. The door was open, and through
it came the soft, throaty hum of a song. He emerged from shelter
and swiftly crossed over. She heard him and turned to the door;
but the light in her eyes faded at sight of the man. And a
jealous, protective rage swept over his body.</p>

<p>"You were expectin' somebody. Who was it, Lola?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not you, Lou."</p>

<p>"No? What are you doing up here&mdash;what kind of a place are
you runnin'? By God, the last thing I'll let&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it! It is not your right to carry on so."</p>

<p>He choked down his bitterness. "I suppose not. But I took good
care of you once. I kept an eye on you. Seems like I'm still
tryin' to."</p>

<p>"Have I forgotten it?" she asked him. "What is the matter with
you? Here you come storming down as if you were mad."</p>

<p>"I reckon we're all mad," he muttered. "Anybody's mad to take
life seriously. Mad as hell."</p>

<p>"You have done something," she observed.</p>

<p>"So. I walked in front of Sundown and asked Eve Leverage for a
dance next week. What did I get? Pity!"</p>

<p>"Did you think she would dance with you, Lou?"</p>

<p>He stared at her. "Well, why not? What have you been hearin'
about me, Lola?"</p>

<p>"Many, many things. None of them good."</p>

<p>"And you believe them?"</p>

<p>"Look at me," said she softly, "and tell me none of these
stories are true."</p>

<p>He accepted the challenge, but of a sudden she was a blur
before his eyes, and he dropped his head, groaning. "Why should
I? Lola, you were one of the two people in the world I feared to
have know about me."</p>

<p>"So I must think of you as a man who once was gay and
impulsive and kind&mdash;and now is only a memory of that man.
Lou&mdash;what a fool you have been to throw away all that you
might have been!"</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" he muttered defiantly. "I
wasn't born to follow the herd. I was born to go the other
way&mdash;what is wrong in that? Who has the power of telling me
what is wrong? Nobody! The pack makes right&mdash;the pack makes
wrong! That's all. If I don't run with the pack I'm not ashamed.
I am my own law. I am as good as any!"</p>

<p>"You are trying to put glory on your weaknesses. I hate that
kind of a thing!"</p>

<p>"Who are you to talk?" he retorted.</p>

<p>He had struck her hard. She drew back, answering slowly,
sadly, "Whatever my faults may have been, Lou, they have hurt
only me. Never another soul in this world."</p>

<p>The drum of a woodpecker sounded sharp and clear in the late
afternoon. Redmain raised his hand with a queer gesture of
finality. "I saw it coming. Nothing could keep it from
you&mdash;about me. There isn't anybody left now who's got any
illusions as to the kind of a man I am."</p>

<p>"I remember the kind of a man you once were, Lou," she
reminded him.</p>

<p>"Three years ago," he broke in gruffly. "People don't stand
still. They go on. They're pushed on. I couldn't be that kind of
a fellow any more if I wanted. But the big thing is&mdash;I don't
want to."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you."</p>

<p>"I'm not!" he snapped. "The pack can't catch me, can't squeeze
me into its ideas and morals. It never will. Before I'm through
I'll show them all what a man can do of his free will."</p>

<p>"Lou, you must not say that."</p>

<p>He pursued his thought heedlessly. "I'll see you no more,
Lola. I'll never come to Sundown again. This is the last time my
welcome's any good here. Well, I'm sorry you know about me. But
I'm glad to remember there was a time&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw the gleam of a tear in her eyes as she faced him. Down
the trail was the sound of someone. Redmain retreated to the edge
of the trees. David Denver was approaching the house.</p>

<p>"Your man's comin', Lola," said he grimly. "Better take good
care of him. He thinks he's neutral, but he ain't. He couldn't be
if he wanted. I won't let him! It won't be long before we meet,
and then you'll have somethin' to cry about. Before God you
will!"</p>

<p>He ducked from sight. On a dead run he descended through the
trees, avoiding the trail, and aimed for Sundown's west end.</p>

<p>"I'll do no dancin' next week," he panted, "I won't be there!
But it is a dance none of 'em will ever forget. I'll see to that.
From now on I play this game for all it's worth. From now on let
them take care of themselves!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; MURDER AND MUSIC</h2>

<p class="first">THE Copperhead school was tonight the rendezvous
for every able-bodied man, woman, and child within forty miles.
Sounds of revelry emerged from every opening and floated across
frosty air; lights gleamed through every opening, and the brisk
melody of guitar and fiddle made lively rhythm. Men whooped
cheerfully, women laughed; and the movement of the crowd never
stopped, for Yellow Hill believed in playing with energy.</p>

<p>Copperhead school itself never could have held them all, but
there was no need of that. The school was only a minor appendage
built on to Casper Flood's enormous hay barn. Tonight the floor
was cleared, cleaned, and waxed, and if the footing was sometimes
rough nobody cared. All around the walls sat the matrons who no
longer found comfort in the actual struggle, the patriarchs who
secretly cherished a desire to shine as dancers and were
restrained by family opinion, and the children&mdash;many of whom
were sound asleep on improvised beds.</p>

<p>Midnight long since had passed, yet the dance went buoyantly
on. Carriages departed, riders came in. Out under a tree men
foregathered between dances to partake of cheer; and just inside
the door a clump of punchers formed the inevitable stag line. In
another corner of the barn stretched a mammoth table which
earlier in the evening had groaned under vast mounds of
sandwiches, fat hams, haunches of beef and cakes by the dozen. At
present it resembled the devastated field of a great battle. Yet
the folks still trooped to it, the hot coffee still steamed out
of the enormous blackened pots, and from somewhere food still was
fetched. And the music went on, and the dancers swirled under the
gleaming lights.</p>

<p>"The best dance," sighed Mrs. Casper Flood, "I ever remember.
Don't Dave and the Monterey girl look well? Seems like they
fit."</p>

<p>"Ha," said Mrs. Jim Coldfoot, who had been eyeing a dark
corner of the barn. "They had ought to fit. Been chasin' together
long enough. Who's he goin' to marry, I want to know? I notice he
pays his attention pretty evenly between the Monterey woman and
Eve. Why didn't he bring Eve to this dance 'stead of Lola
Monterey?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Dave?" inquired Mrs. Casper Flood
ironically.</p>

<p>"Would if I thought he'd tell," said Mrs. Jim, in no manner
abashed. "All I got to say is if Eve Leverage likes him and is
put out by his goin' with that other girl, then she keeps it well
hid, the little devil."</p>

<p>The music stopped with a flourish and couples began circling
for seats. By degrees intimate friends collected in small knots.
Presently Denver and Steele and Steers, with their partners,
gathered at the table. Niland came up and joined; and lastly the
Englishman arrived with one of the Fee girls. The Englishman,
alone of all that assemblage, was dressed in full evening habit.
His ruddy face was a burnished crimson above the utter whiteness
of a stiff shirt. He bowed and he bent with a scrupulous nicety.
He was urbanity and polish personified.</p>

<p>It was a tribute to Almaric St. Jennifer Crvecoeur
Nightingale that the circle at the table opened readily to admit
him; and it was a still greater tribute that this circle began to
cast humorous comment on his get-up. For when cattleland abandons
formality toward a man, that man is accepted.</p>

<p>"What I wish to know," demanded Niland, indicating the full
dress, "is do you pin it on or buckle it on?"</p>

<p>"Let's widen the inquiry," added Denver. "Do you step into it,
climb into it, or roll into it?"</p>

<p>"One acquires the knowledge by degrees," said Nightingale
gravely. "It takes ten years to learn the proper angle at which
to wear a top hat. Why, dear fellas, every curve and cut is
prescribed by tradition, hallowed by memory. What you see before
you is the cumulative sartorial wisdom of ten gen'rations of
Nightingales, most painfully acquired. Why, my great-great-great-
grandfather on the Jennifer side earned the Garter for no less a
service than showing His Majesty how to be seated in a chair
without wrinkling his tails. At Culloden, where one of my
ancestors commanded, the battle order was delayed ten hours till
swift couriers could find a daisy for this said revered ancestor
to wear in his buttonhole durin' the battle. And, mind you, the
enemy was so versed in etiquette it refused to attack us until my
sire had found the daisy."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sniffed Steve Steers suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," stated the Englishman, grave as a hanging
judge.</p>

<p>"Don't let them kid you, Nighty," broke in Steele. "I sported
one of those in the bygone years. It was a pleasure&mdash;as most
things were to me, then."</p>

<p>"I reckon you acquire a taste for it," reflected Denver, "like
olives or eggplant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jim Coldfoot was discovered on the edge of the circle,
aimlessly stabbing at food. It was apparent she meant to miss no
word exchanged by these people.</p>

<p>"I like to see men in dress suits," said Lola.</p>

<p>"I could think of nothing more charming," added Eve.</p>

<p>"Now, there!" exploded Niland. "Right there's the insidious
influence of the get-up. Nighty wears it, the women fall for it,
and pretty soon we'll all have to follow in line. I consider this
grave enough for the vigilantes."</p>

<p>"Supposing," suggested Denver, "we excuse ourselves for a
smoke and consider the state of affairs at mature length?"</p>

<p>"Is it just a smoke you want?" was Debbie Lunt's malicious
question. She looked at Steve, and he joined the departing men
uneasily, while the rest of the women laughed.</p>

<p>Out in the yard they assembled. There was a slight gurgle.
"What was that the Governor of South Ca'lina said to the Governor
of North Ca'lina?" asked Steve. "Personally I despise strong
drink, but my feet's hurtin' me awful."</p>

<p>"Don't see why they should," retorted Denver. "You been ridin'
around all evenin' on somebody else's feet."</p>

<p>"I'd kill any other man for that," growled Steve, and began to
cough. "Whoosh! Somebody hit me on the back 'afore I strangle.
Who kicked me in the stummick?"</p>

<p>The Englishman, not yet quite up to the group, was suddenly
plucked on the sleeve. A pair of shadows said "Shush!" in unison
and drew him away. "It's us, Meems and Wango. Yore a stranger in
the country and had ought to be introduced to somethin' nice.
Come right over here. By this wagon. Lean agin it while I get the
bottle. Don't want nobody else to see or they'd jest swamp
us."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began Nightingale and was pushed against the
wagon's side with cordial insistence.</p>

<p>"That's all right. Don't let yore gen'rosity get the best of
you. Wango and me believe we owe it to a stranger once, anyhow.
Here it is, the finest whisky money can buy. Take a drink. Take a
big drink. Hell, take two-three drinks and see if we ain't got
the best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," agreed Nightingale and accepted the bottle.
The partners crowded beside him, patted him on the back.
Nightingale lowered the bottle. "Is this what you are proud
of?"</p>

<p>"Ain't it the doggonedest, bestest&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Englishman belched magnificently. "I think your trust in
nature is jolly well misplaced. Thanks for the disinfectant, and
excuse me while I join my friends."</p>

<p>Meems and Wango waited until Nightingale had crossed the yard,
then turned toward their horses. "After that," said Meems, "I
think we better take our leave. Never know what a furriner will
do."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Wango. Together they swung to saddle and aimed
for the maw of Copperhead bridge. Wango spoke doubtfully. "Say,
Buck, do yuh think that was really funny?"</p>

<p>"Sure it was funny," insisted Meems. "I thought I'd die of
laughin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a long jump and run from any proof it's funny,"
gloomed Wango. "Supposin' he takes exception?"</p>

<p>"Ah, shucks, Englishmen don't get mad. They just look
pained."</p>

<p>"Well, mebbe it was funny."</p>

<p>"Sure it was funny. Haw, haw!"</p>

<p>"Damned if it wuzn't funny! Haw, haw, haw!"</p>

<p>The echo of this blank and hollow laughter ran back through
the covered bridge and dismally died. A rider came out of the Sky
Peak region, flailing down the sloping road. Meems and Wango,
chary birds, moved off the highway without comment and halted.
The rider ran past but drew to a walk at the bridge and went
quietly across. Meems and Wango proceeded onward.</p>

<p>"Make him out?" whispered Wango.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I saw."</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut your face. Yuh didn't see him atall, get me? You and me
don't know nothin'. And is happy as such."</p>

<p>"Gosh, we're ign'runt ain't we, Buck?"</p>

<p>"You bet. I misdoubt they's two fellas in the world that knows
as much as we do and is so plumb ign'runt."</p>

<p>Denver and his friends returned casually to the dance hall. It
was Steve Steers who, stepping around Nightingale, first saw what
had happened. Compressing his lips, he began to wigwag at the
others. The Englishman walked forward to his lady and bowed
ceremoniously; and by this time there were twenty people grinning
at him. The Englishman began to feel something wrong and swung
about, thus exposing his back to the length of the hall. Somebody
whooped joyously. Whereat Nightingale twisted his neck, and
looked among his friends.</p>

<p>"Do I," he demanded, "look odd?"</p>

<p>"Who've you been associatin' with lately?" Denver asked.</p>

<p>"Hm," breathed Nightingale. "Did those extr'ord'n'ary fellas,
Meems and Wango, have an ulterior motive?" He bowed again at his
lady and with a calmness that was iron-like shucked his coat to
expose all the bracing and lacing and scaffolding of his shirt.
He held up the back of the coat critically. Upon it clung a
square sheet of paper, damp with paste, and across the paper was
inscribed:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">FOR RENT OR HIRE<br>
SEE JAKE EPSTEIN<br>
NOBBY CLOTHIER.</p>
<br>

<p>"So they took me," observed Nightingale, ripping off the sign.
And though he maintained the utmost gravity, something like a
beam of laughter sparkled in his azure eyes.</p>

<p>The women were outraged. But Denver chuckled broadly. "Well,
we've got one point cleared up about that rig. He doesn't pin it
on; he buckles it on."</p>

<p>Cal Steele, smiling languidly, let his glance play around the
hall. His head jerked, and on the moment darkness came to his
face. Rather forcibly he recovered his smile and murmured to Eve,
"Just excuse me a minute." He strode out of the barn.</p>

<p>"Folks," said Eve, "in two or three hours it will be daylight.
Most of our men have a day's work ahead. Supposing we go
home."</p>

<p>"I think I do more work than anybody here," put in
Nightingale. "Keepin' out of my foreman's way."</p>

<p>Steve Steers flushed and appeared uncomfortable, as indeed he
had appeared most of the evening.</p>

<p>"Always was an officious rascal," drawled Denver. "The trouble
is to keep him on the job. Temperamental I mean."</p>

<p>"Ain't I among friends?" was Steve's plaintive groan.</p>

<p>Debbie started to defend him with tartness, but Cal Steele
returned and drew the circle's attention. Worry stamped his
cheeks. He spoke without the customary ease, almost jerking the
words out.</p>

<p>"This is bad. I've got to go home. Now. David, could I appeal
to you to see that Eve is taken care of? Eve, my dear, I'll make
up for this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all right," Eve assured him quickly.</p>

<p>Denver was watching his friend with sharp attention. "Want
help, Cal?"</p>

<p>"No. Not at all. But I've got to go."</p>

<p>It was Steve who had to crown his evening's misery by one
supremely inopportune remark.</p>

<p>"Well, yuh got two girls now, Dave. What you goin' to do with
'em?"</p>

<p>In itself the statement was harmless; but it brought to the
minds of all the long-standing question in Yellow Hill concerning
Dave and Lola and Eve. In the moment of dead silence Steve saw
his mistake and was practically paralyzed. He turned a dull red.
It was Eve, herself flushed, who bridged the strained scene.</p>

<p>"That's soon settled," said she coolly. "Let Lola come home
with me tonight."</p>

<p>"I would like that," replied Lola, dark eyes shining across at
Eve.</p>

<p>Cal Steele gave the group a short flickering smile. "Goodnight
to you all. I have had the evening of my life. And until we meet
again&mdash;bless you, my children."</p>

<p>Denver was plainly worried, and he started after Steele. "Sure
you don't want help, Cal?"</p>

<p>But Cal Steele shook his head. "Dave, old man, if I did I'd
come to you first of all." The inner strain of his thoughts aged
him; he stared at Denver like a man racked and wrung. "Just
remember that. I'd always come to you first&mdash;and last. So
long."</p>

<p>He disappeared, leaving behind the hint of trouble. Some of
the sparkle went from the party, and by common consent they
slowly paid their farewells and walked from the hall. Denver put
Eve and Lola in his rig and went over to intercept Steve.
"Listen, when you leave Debbie home, why not cut around by the
rock road to the ranch? Just to see if anything's on the
wing?"</p>

<p>"Can do," grunted Steve.</p>

<p>Dave hurried back and found his foreman, Lyle Bonnet,
loitering in the stag line. "Pick up what boys you find from the
outfit," he told Bonnet, "and take the straight tail to
Starlight. If you hear anything, have a look. Now, hustle."</p>

<p>He returned to the buggy, spread the robes around Lola and
Eve, and silently aimed for the Leverage ranch. In the course of
the ride he hardly spoke a dozen words, wrapped as he was in
uneasy thought. At the Leverage house he helped them down and
turned the buggy about. They stood on the porch a moment, the
fair, clear-minded, and boyish Eve beside Lola, who seemed to him
so often all fire and flame. It struck him queerly that these
two, opposites in character, should tonight be sharing the same
house. Eve's drowsy, practical, "Goodnight, Dave, go home and get
some sleep," made a pleasant melody in the night. Lola only said,
"Goodnight," in a slow whisper, but somehow it was in Dave's ear
all the way across the yard. In the main road he put the horse to
an urgent pace, the thought of Cal Steele's drawn face troubling
him.</p>

<p>Eve lighted a lamp and showed Lola to the guest room. "Sleep
as late as you please. I'll take you to town in the morning.
We've had a splendid evening, haven't we?"</p>

<p>Lola's dark eyes glowed. "Tonight you smoothed over the hard
truth, and I admired you more than ever I thought I would." She
threw back her head and acted out Steve's unfortunate sentence.
"'Well, you've got two girls now, Dave. What are you going to do
with them?' But David could not answer it if he wanted. He
doesn't know. Neither do you, nor I."</p>

<p>Eve seemed a little pale and tired. "I have been wanting to
ask you something for a long while. Did you find the three years'
absence to help any? With David?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Eve answered slowly. "If I thought my leaving for a time would
make any difference I'd go tomorrow."</p>

<p>"And come back on the next train for fear of losing," said
Lola. "I know."</p>

<p>"What would you do to please him?" asked Eve.</p>

<p>"You see me standing here. I could be a thousand pleasanter
places. There is your answer. I would go any place for him, do
anything. Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>Eve's body stiffened. The message in Lola's eyes, the blaze of
feeling repelled her. Lola laughed softly. "You wouldn't, would
you? You want to be discreet. You are afraid. You want things
without paying for them."</p>

<p>"That is not love," said Eve quickly.</p>

<p>"Not your kind. But it is my kind. Love is everything. Like
fire, like torture, like thirst. You must be half a savage to
know it. I'm half a savage. You're not."</p>

<p>"But it isn't love," repeated Eve, biting her lip.</p>

<p>"Not your kind," said Lola, a trace of scorn in her words.
"Let me tell you. David Denver is too strong a man to be held
completely by any one woman. He is kind, yet when the black mood
is on him he could double up his fist and destroy. He speaks
softly, yet always with a fire burning deep down in him. He will
never be happy, he will never find all that he wants in any one
woman. Yet my kind can hold him&mdash;for a little while. What I
must do to have him&mdash;that I'll do. But never, never will it
be enough. I throw myself away gladly. And in the end he will
destroy me. That is love. You know nothing about it. Go East,
where you won't be hurt."</p>

<p>"You don't know him at all," said Eve.</p>

<p>Lola's mood changed on the instant. "Of course I don't. If I
knew him&mdash;I could have him! You&mdash;what do you know that
I don't? Tell me that!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a little late for us to be talking so?" asked
Eve.</p>

<p>"You are very calm and very wise, aren't you? You are one
thing&mdash;I am another. Perhaps if both of our natures were in
one woman Dave would puzzle himself no longer."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Eve with a shadow on her face, "I think I am
two women&mdash;and one of them is like you, but never able to
come out and be seen. Goodnight."</p>

<p>Denver drove the buggy across his yard and unhitched, throwing
the horse into a corral. Lyle Bonnet came off the main house
porch.</p>

<p>"No developments?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Bonnet, sleepy-voiced. "There was a few shots
beyond Starlight about an hour ago. But I'd say it was some
galoot comin' home from the dance."</p>

<p>"I suppose," agreed Dave. "You better turn in."</p>

<p>As for himself, he crossed through the main room and settled
down on the south porch of the house. From this vantage point he
could, on a clear day, look down the sweep of Starlight canyon
and on into the open prairie for thirty miles or more. He liked
to sit here and feel that he was for a while above the heat of
the world. It gave him a sense of peace. But tonight he could not
summon back that peace. Cal Steele's face, strangely distorted,
kept rising before him. Yellow Hill was going to war, no doubt of
it. Riders were in the night and man's hand was set against man's
hand. Jake Leverage had not been at the dance, nor had Lou
Redmain. These men were busy elsewhere. And behind them were many
riders on the hunt.</p>

<p>"So it will be," he muttered. "And how long will I be able to
stay up here and mind my affairs? God knows. I despise posses
about as much as I despise outlaws. Who is to say whether the
hunted is so much blacker than the man hunting? Let every man
stand responsible for his acts, and let every man fight his own
fights. Yet that is something soon enough impossible to do. Then
what?"</p>

<p>Starlight throbbed with weaving, swirling shadows; the sky was
hidden behind the fog mist. The country seemed to lie uneasy.
Denver, who responded quickly to the primitive moods of the
earth, felt the shift and change as if the temperature had
dropped twenty degrees.</p>

<p>"I will fight my own fights," he said to himself. "No matter
whom it puts me against. I don't want to go against Redmain, but
if it must be then it shall be. All I ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stiffened and turned his head slightly to the wind. Above
the slow rustle of the night emerged a foreign disturbance. It
came from the upper trail&mdash;a tentative, cautious advance of
a horse. Denver slid his feet quietly beneath him, rose, and
slipped into the house. He dimmed the lamp and went out to the
yard, going on to the vague bulk of a pine trunk. There was a
rider just above the place; and that rider seemed to be turning
with considerable hesitation from one angle of the slope to
another. Denver waited patiently.</p>

<p>Then the horse stopped, but from the shadows came a weird
sobbing noise that shot a chill along Denver's nerves. He left
the tree and challenged. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>A trembling reply came back. "Dave&mdash;oh, Dave&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Cal!" shouted Denver, racing forward.</p>

<p>"Dave, my God, I'm shot to ribbons!"</p>

<p>Denver reached the horse as his friend started slipping from
the saddle. He caught Steele in his arms, feeling the warm blood
all along the man's clothes. "Cal, by all that's&mdash;! Hang
onto yourself! I'll have you layin' easy in a minute. Doc
Williamson will get here right away. Cal!"</p>

<p>Denver stumbled across the yard. The bunkhouse door sprang
open, and men ran out. Somebody dashed for the house and turned
up the lamp. Denver marched in, laid Steele on a couch, ripping
at the crimson wet shirt. But Steele rolled his head in negation
and opened his eyes, staring up at Denver.</p>

<p>"No use&mdash;doin' that.
I'm&mdash;shot&mdash;to&mdash;pieces."</p>

<p>Denver cursed bitterly. "Who did it, Cal? By the livin'
Christ, I'll rip the throat out of the man!"</p>

<p>Steele's lips began twitching. "I said I'd&mdash;come to
you&mdash;first or last, didn't I?" he murmured. "Tried to do you
a favor, old boy. Like you'd do me. Listen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was no more from Cal Steele then, nor ever would be.
His head slid forward, and the invisible hand of death reached
down to place the everlasting seal upon that fine face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; TRAILS</h2>

<p class="first">DAVE DENVER made his preparations in the dark
hour preceding dawn. He ordered the best horses saddled and
brought to the porch. He opened his gun locker and distributed
the rifles resting there, at the same time dividing his outfit
into three parts, one to patrol his range, one to return to work,
and one to ride under him. From the patrolling party he
dispatched a man to Sundown for Dr. Williamson and another to
Steele's ranch. The rest of that particular group he detailed to
various points in the hills. All ate a hurried breakfast. The
work party went off discontentedly; and when the first gray light
of morning broke through the fog he gathered his chosen riders,
mounted, and swung up the side of the ridge to trace the
hoofprints of Cal Steele's horse. Lyle Bonnet, traveling directly
behind, offered a brief suggestion.</p>

<p>"Better send somebody to tell Leverage. It's a matter for the
vigilantes."</p>

<p>Denver shook his head. "I'll never ask anybody else to do a
dirty chore I ought to do myself. And don't get it in your head,
Lyle, that I want anybody else to settle this. I'll find the
party who killed Cal&mdash;and I'll smile when I see him
dead."</p>

<p>The yielding earth bore the print of Steele's last ride for
better than two miles straight down the trail. At that point the
tracks swung into the slope of Starlight, crossed the bottom of
the canyon, and angled along the far side. Once Denver halted and
got down. Steele had fallen from the saddle. A carpet of leaves
was marked with the man's blood.</p>

<p>"He had a bad time gettin' back on," muttered Denver. "Don't
see how he ever made it. It's clear as day his strength was about
gone."</p>

<p>Beyond Starlight the trail went zigzagging through timber.
Denver advanced slowly. His friend seemed to have got lost and in
sheer despair given his horse free head. All through the timber
were places where the pony had circled, doubled on its own
course, and straightened again for the canyon. As the day
broadened Denver pushed deeper into the secretive glens and pine
reaches guarding the Copperhead watershed. Cal Steele's trail
began to straighten.</p>

<p>"Not far from the place now," said Denver. "See, he had
control of himself for a little while and managed to make a true
course."</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later Denver halted in an upland meadow and
pointed at the broken surface of the soil. Hoofmarks overran the
meadow and muddied it as if to blot out some sinister story that
had been there. Into this confused area ran the pony
tracks&mdash;and there were lost to distinct view.</p>

<p>"Here's where it happened," announced Denver, eyes flaring.
"Now let's see where all these night birds went afterward. Cut
back into the trees and circle. Keep out of the meadow or you'll
make the ground worse than it is."</p>

<p>Lyle Bonnet, already on the quest, jumped from his saddle and
bent over. "Here's a hat, Dave."</p>

<p>Denver rode over and took it. He looked briefly at the
sweatband. "Cal's," he said. And while the crew scouted off he
went back to the center of the meadow and tried to construct some
sort of a story. "Cal had warnin'," he reflected. "Somebody came
to the dance and tipped him off. Then he came here, smashed into
trouble, and made his last stand. Those shots Bonnet heard must
have been the ones that riddled him. They came from this
direction about a half hour or so after he left the dance. That
means he lost no time. Didn't hunt around but rode right into it.
In other words he knew where this bunch was&mdash;or the
messenger knew. And who was that messenger?"</p>

<p>Lyle Bonnet returned. "Must have been twenty men in the party.
They pulled the old Apache trick. Shot him to ribbons and then
scattered. There's a dozen or more tracks leadin' away to every
point of the compass."</p>

<p>"So," reflected Denver. "But before they could go away they
had to come. Must be some tracks pointing in."</p>

<p>"Yeah. They rode up from the Copperhead together, accordin' to
my judgment."</p>

<p>Denver studied Steele's hat. "Blood on it. Blood all over the
trail. A good man's blood waterin' this damned dark country. Come
on, we'll start trackin'. No use wastin' time here."</p>

<p>With the crew behind him, he swept across the meadow and
struck the inbound trail of the night party. It took him downhill
to the south-east. From the clots of mud spattering the brush he
knew that the group had come along at a fast clip. Come from
where? Presumably from the river. But there was extraordinarily
rough country along the river at this point, which brought him to
the possibility that the outlaws had dashed out of the Sky Peak
country and crossed the bridge. That as well seemed unlikely. The
dance hall was too close to the bridge to permit unobserved
passage of any large party during the evening.</p>

<p>Lyle Bonnet's shrewd mind had been going along much the same
line of reasoning. "They musta spurred out of the south, Dave,
and circled the schoolhouse at a distance."</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Denver. "But maybe they didn't. Maybe they
were on Steele's range, or Nightingale's range, and looped around
to the meadow. They were near enough this country at midnight for
some friend of Steele's to see them and give Cal a warning. That
meadow is on my range but close to Cal's. Maybe he got warning
they were rustling his stuff and rode off to take a hand. And
found them on my soil instead."</p>

<p>"Sounds unlikely," observed Bonnet. "It was awful dark last
night. Either he knew right where they were, or else they made a
powerful lot of noise. No trail he might have took to get home
would bring him near the meadow. What defeats me is why he didn't
let somebody know about it instead of ridin' off alone."</p>

<p>Denver shook his head, saying nothing. Cal Steele was a man of
moods and never quite fathomable. Mystery surrounded his last
hours, a part of the brooding mystery that of late hovered over
Yellow Hill County.</p>

<p>He drew in, having reached the gravel road connecting Sundown
Valley with the ranches along the Copperhead. At this point the
outlaw trail left the soft ground of the ridge and fell into the
road, merging with all the other prints of travel along it.</p>

<p>"They come from Steele's or Nightingale's all right," stated
Bonnet after a long inspection. "But that ain't what we want to
know. Our question is where they went afterward. How about
sendin' two-three boys back to the meadow and trackin' down some
of those departin' buzzards? Sooner or later we'd find where the
bunch come together again."</p>

<p>Denver rolled a cigarette. "No, there's an easier way, Lyle.
If it was just one man or two men we'd have to scout from the
beginnin' and unravel what we found. But when it's a mess of
twenty or more there ain't much doubt in my mind as to who we're
looking for. There ain't but one gang in Yellow Hill that
big."</p>

<p>"Meaning Lou Redmain," mused Bonnet. "If you consider doin'
what I think yuh are, then I'd say send somebody back for the
rest of the crew. Eight of us ain't enough."</p>

<p>For a still longer time Denver sat in the saddle, staring down
the road. He was arrived at last at that crisis to which he long
had hoped he never would come. To live and let live&mdash;such
was the very foundation of all his thoughts and acts. He wished
to have no part in judging what was good and what was bad. Yet
for all that he could not escape from the clear call of his
conscience. He would fight his own battles, he would justify his
friends. No matter if it meant the end of all peace, no matter if
it meant Yellow Hill was to be torn asunder and left aswirl with
powder smoke.</p>

<p>And so it would be when he turned the crew around and started
west on that road. He was too wise to believe differently.
Inevitably the force he represented would collide with the force
that Lou Redmain stood for; and in that conflict nobody could say
what result would arise. It was grim irony that he trembled on
the very margin of an act he had condemned at the Association
meeting. He had rejected the quasi-legal opportunity to strike at
Redmain and now was about to strike without the shadow of any
formal sanction. This was war, this was violence but one degree
above Redmain's own outlawry. No matter what background there
might be of rough-handed justice, that staring fact remained, and
David Denver was too candid with himself to avoid it.</p>

<p>Yet he had no wish to avoid it. Through many months he had
seen violence smoking up to some enormous culmination. Quite
clear-sightedly he had seen it and made known the fact that he
was not to be counted as a partisan unless the one and only one
proviso arose. Well, it had arisen. Cal Steele was dead. And
somewhere Lou Redmain was preparing to strike again. For with a
man who declares the sky to be his limit there could be no
halfway point, no line of decency. Redmain would go on, from one
piece of violence and banditry to another, with increasing
contempt of law. He would never stop&mdash;until he died. So the
problem lay clear and simple in David Denver's mind. He tossed
away his cigarette, turning to the crew.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'm responsible for whatever happens and whoever
gets hurt. You know what's ahead. I won't ask anybody to ride
with me that feels different. Sing out now before we start."</p>

<p>A short constrained silence followed. Lyle Bonnet raked the
men with sober eye and spoke for them. "Now that you've got that
ceremony off yore chest, let's waste no more time."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sound of a cavalcade came drumming around the bend. It was
Steele's crew with Hominy Hogg leading. The party halted.</p>

<p>"We was a-comin' around to meet yuh by Starlight," explained
Hominy. "What's the ticket?"</p>

<p>"We're crossing over Sundown Valley," said Denver.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better," grunted Hominy. "I thought you'd do
it. That's why we come loaded, all of us."</p>

<p>"Didn't you know about what happened before I sent a man
over?" queried Denver.</p>

<p>"Nope. Steele left around eight last night, alone. Said he'd
probably be home considerable late. That's the last we saw or
heard, till Ben come along with yore note."</p>

<p>"Didn't one of you fellows ride to the dance and give him a
message?" persisted Denver.</p>

<p>Hominy Hogg looked blank. "Nobody as I know about. Fact is,
none of our outfit went to the dance. Steele seemed to sorter
have trouble on his mind and told us to stick close to
quarters."</p>

<p>"I'd give a great deal to know who the man was," was Denver's
slow answer. "He led Cal to the slaughter&mdash;and disappeared.
You understand, boys, that we're starting something, and it may
be a long pull before we're finished. If anybody's got an idea
this is just a holiday he'd better drop out."</p>

<p>"Whud yuh suppose we come for?" countered Hominy. "This
business leads back to one gent. Go ahead. You do the thinkin'
and we'll do the shootin'. As long as it takes."</p>

<p>Denver reined his horse about and set off, the men pairing
behind. Around and down and up the twisting gravel road they
galloped, thirty-odd riders heavily armed and single minded. They
passed the mouth of Starlight and came into the Sundown-Ysabel
Junction stage road. They traversed the plank bridge at Sweet
Creek and labored along the hairpin turns, and so came at last to
the level stretch across which Shoshone Dome threw its shadow.
Here Denver turned over the soft meadows of Sundown Valley and
entered the dark land bordering the Wells.</p>

<p>All along this route Denver's mind kept plucking away at the
puzzle of Cal Steele's unknown informant. Who, other than one of
his own crew, would come hasting out of the night to warn him?
And, having done that, vanish from the picture? If this man had
known of the outlaws and had considered it important enough to
reach Cal Steele, why then did he not go back with Steele and
engage in the same fight? Perhaps he had done so. And escaped
when Steele fell. Then why was it that the man had not gone to
tell others instead of dropping from view? Had he been wounded
and crawled into some thicket to die? Or was the fellow some
traitorous friend of Steele's who had knowingly led the latter to
destruction? This was possible, though it seemed queer to Denver
that Steele would let himself easily into a trap. Steele had
lived in the country long enough to understand all the
tricks.</p>

<p>But over and above all these speculations one unexplainable
fact kept jarring every probable hypothesis. Steele had gone off
without help, without confiding in another. And he had gone off
in a seriously upset frame of mind. Only a disturbance of major
import could have placed that pallor and those lines on the easy-
going man's cheeks. Each time Denver reverted to that final scene
at the dance he was conscious of a strange chill, a premonition
of evil. His mind beat against the black curtain of uncertainty.
For a brief instant that curtain slipped aside, and Denver caught
sight of something that repelled and hardened him. He ripped out
an oath. Lyle Bonnet forged beside him swiftly.</p>

<p>"See somethin'?"</p>

<p>But Denver shook his head and set his jaws. He pulled himself
away from his painful thinking and with visible effort
concentrated his senses on the tangible world about him. He
experienced a sudden dread at allowing himself to tamper with
that concealing curtain again.</p>

<p>Lyle Bonnet was once more beside him. "You goin' to smash
right down, Dave? Or put a ring around 'em?"</p>

<p>Only then did Denver realize the full absorption of his
thoughts. He had covered five rugged miles almost sightlessly.
They were in a widening bay of the pines, a bay that entered a
scarred hillside clearing. And over there, slumbering under the
full sun, were the unlovely buildings of the Wells. Nothing moved
in the street, By common consent the party halted.</p>

<p>"Looks a little fishy to me," observed Bonnet. "Too damned
deserted. I'd hate to run into a pour of lead."</p>

<p>"Not even no smoke from the chimbleys," observed Hominy
Hogg.</p>

<p>Denver's nerves tightened, an acute clarity came to all his
senses. In that lull of time every detail of the sagging
buildings, the frowzy street, the scarred hillside registered
indelibly on his brain. He actually felt the quality of
suspended, breathless silence emanating from the place and the
almost animate glare of the windows facing him.</p>

<p>Denver made his disposition of forces quickly. "You take half
your men, Hominy, and circle for the top of that hillside. Then
walk out of the trees and straight down. Lyle and six others will
go to the right, curve clear around, and get set to come into the
street from that end. I'll wait here. Hominy's got the longest
trip. When he rides to view, the rest of us start
accordingly."</p>

<p>Hominy wanted to be absolutely sure of Denver's intent. "In
case they don't quite make up their minds to fight or be
peaceable, what's our cue?"</p>

<p>"If Redmain's yonder," said Denver, "there can be no question
what he'll do. He's burned his bridges and cut himself off.
Nothing left for him but fight it out."</p>

<p>"But in case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There ain't any other answer, for him or for us," broke in
Denver with sudden impatience. "Get going!"</p>

<p>The two parties filed through the trees; Denver waited with
cold patience. He had come to the Wells once before, ready to
cast up accounts. Lou Redmain had spoken softly, calling upon his
given word as a mark of friendship, yet all the while meaning not
a syllable of it. This day there would be none of that. The
outlaw chief had forfeited the right to make a promise. There
remained no solitary rule of human conduct by which he might
establish his faith. He had nothing left but his jungle
instincts, plus that lusting spark of domination that at once
made him far more dangerous than any other beast of prey. For,
while the lower animals obeyed the inevitable cycle of their
kind, a renegade man obeyed only his own impulses, and it was
impossible to tell what these impulses might be from hour to
hour.</p>

<p>The stark barrenness of the town challenged Denver's watchful
eyes. Methodically he swept every corner, every rubbish pile,
every shaded crevice. Some doors were shut, some swung ajar. The
street seemed cleared for ambush, yet if Redmain were hidden
there, no sign or portent rose to warn Denver. As he considered
this he looked aside and found Hominy's men advancing from the
high trees. At once he gathered his reins and walked into the
clearing, the following men spreading fan-wise to either side of
him. Hominy accelerated the pace and deployed his party to
command the Wells from behind. Lyle Bonnet, having less room to
maneuver on the far side of town, elected to speed up and so
reached the street in advance of the others. Denver spurred by
the first building and jumped to the high porch of the saloon.
Watchfulness gave way. He yelled suddenly. "Spread out! Smash
down the doors! Don't bunch up!" And he plunged into the saloon
one pace ahead of Lyle Bonnet, gun lifted to debate his entry.
The oncoming riders carried him a dozen feet before he hauled
short, surprised at what he found.</p>

<p>There was no opposition, no renegades ranked along the walls.
Behind the bar the black giant lolled, saying nothing. A dozen
oldish men and six or seven women clustered sullenly at the far
end of the place and stared back with apathetic hatred. Half
expecting trickery, he turned about. But he could hear the others
of his party running from building to building, calling down
their signals. Hominy roared a savage challenge. "Where is that
skunk-stinkin' pirate? Knock hell out o' the joint!" A woman
laughed, shrill and scornful.</p>

<p>"You better get up earlier in the mornin' to find anybody
here, Mister Denver!"</p>

<p>He swung on the drab group. "Well, where are they?"</p>

<p>"You'd like to know, wouldn't you?" retorted the woman. "Go
and find out!"</p>

<p>He aimed for a rear door, went through it at a stride, and
found himself in a hall. A stairway climbed to dim upper regions.
Bonnet and a few others pursued him.</p>

<p>"Careful," muttered Bonnet; "this is a damned fine
slaughterin' pen!"</p>

<p>Denver struck the banister with his gun barrel and listened to
the echo run blankly through upper emptiness. That seemed to
convince him. He sprang along the stairs three at a time, arrived
at the second-floor landing, and saw more doors yawning into a
hall. His men filed in either direction covering these dingy
rooms One room at the end seemed larger than the rest, and Denver
went in. The bed was made, and a trunk and some personal effects
indicated occupancy, but from the open bureau drawers and the
scattered tills of the trunk he guessed what Redmain had
done.</p>

<p>"They've scattered," he told the incoming Bonnet. "Took their
travelin' gear and departed. Redmain knows he never would be safe
a minute with this for headquarters."</p>

<p>He dropped the top of the trunk and stared at the "L. R."
burned in the wood ribs. Bonnet found grim amusement in that.
"The high card's own private roost, uh? By golly, he'll sleep in
harder places than this from now on."</p>

<p>Denver only heard part of his foreman's comment. He had found
half of a book page tacked to the wall with this fragment of
verse on it:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
Into this Universe, and Why Not Knowing<br>
Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;<br>
And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br>
I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.</p>

<p><br>
Denver ripped the page from the wall and crushed it in his
blackened fist. "The poor condemned fool! What couldn't a man
like that do with a drop of honest blood in his veins? Don't tell
me he can't tell what's right and what's wrong. He knows the
difference. He'll travel the crooked trail with fire in his heart
just because he knows the difference too damned well! And there's
the fellow who's going to be hunted like a rat, shot at, starved,
brought to stand, and knocked over! He knows better!"</p>

<p>A woman came, breathless and defiant, to the door; the same
one who had scorned him. There was still a trace of prettiness
about her. "Can't you keep your dirty hands off his things?" she
cried. "Get out of here! You'll never catch Lou Redmain by
prowling through his trunk! Leave it alone."</p>

<p>"It's your room, too, ma'm?" asked Denver.</p>

<p>"Well, what if it is?"</p>

<p>"My apologies," said Denver gravely. "I don't make it a habit
of enterin' a lady's room. Not even if it's about to be
destroyed." He passed her and went down the stairs.</p>

<p>She followed him. "What's the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>He crossed the saloon hall again and found Hominy waiting,
morose and restless. "Well, they ain't here, that's plumb clear.
What about these guineas left behind? Why not pack 'em to Sundown
and let the county treat 'em for a while? Otherwise they'll get
word to Redmain and tattle. When he comes back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't come back," broke in Denver softly.</p>

<p>"I ain't sure about that."</p>

<p>"No. He'll have nothing to come back to. We're putting him on
the country for good."</p>

<p>"What're you driving at?" insisted the woman.</p>

<p>Denver raised his voice to the uneasy camp followers of the
outlaw bunch. "You've got five minutes to pull your belongings
out of doors. I am burning the town."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idee," grunted Bonnet. "I never did burn a town
afore. Be somethin' new in a short but sweet life."</p>

<p>"Lou will kill you!" cried the woman.</p>

<p>"That's one of the two possibilities," said Denver. "The other
is that I may kill him. I reckon you'll only have about four
minutes left. It ain't my desire to burn any of your possibles,
so I'd suggest you hurry."</p>

<p>The rest of the riders followed him to the street. "Set fire
to four or five places at the same time," said Denver. "This
joint is dry as pitch, and it'll go in one quick roar."</p>

<p>"Ready?" inquired Bonnet.</p>

<p>"Give these poor devils their chance, Lyle."</p>

<p>The black barkeep walked from the saloon barehanded. "I come
here without nothin' and I'll leave without nothin'. Ain't takin'
no favors from you, Mister Denver."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," drawled Denver. "But maybe you'll do me one.
Maybe you'll take a message to Redmain for me."</p>

<p>"I do nothin' for you, Mister Denver. Never."</p>

<p>"Just as well. You'd be too slow. Now I see horses in that
barn yonder and a wagon. Hitch up the wagon and turn out the rest
of the animals."</p>

<p>The denizens of this condemned town straggled from the
buildings. Denver moved down to the end of the street and sat
quite still in the saddle. His attention reverted to the stable,
and he spoke casually to the nearest hand. "The big boy takes too
long to hitch a wagon. Go down there and let him smell the end of
your loop." Instead of one, three men galloped off to carry out
the chore. Denver felt the restlessness of his party, and he knew
they wanted to do the job and be away. But he tarried until he
thought all of the people had retrieved their possessions. They
came toward him, a shabby, disreputable set that stirred him to
faint pity. Aimlessly they milled at the street's end. Out of the
stable came the wagon and team, the giant lashing the beasts into
a dead run. He had three loops around his neck and three riders
spurring ahead, threatening momentarily to haul him out of the
vehicle. Denver raised his arm and the ropes slacked away. The
giant halted the wagon and rolled his eyes at Denver.</p>

<p>"'Fore God, you'll suffer fer this!"</p>

<p>"Somebody suffers," was Denver's laconic answer. He raised his
gun to the sky and fired a single shot in warning to whoever
might have loitered in the buildings. Then he called out to those
men waiting to apply the match. "Let her burn."</p>

<p>The woman who had enough spirit to defy him ran against his
horse. "You&mdash;you'll find a day to regret this!" she cried.
Of a sudden Denver bent down, one arm sweeping her aside. There
was the flat, startling report of a gun. The woman's right hand
was wrenched up, revealing the weapon. Denver seized it and threw
it far aside; and even then the tight calm remained on him.</p>

<p>"Can't say I blame you," he muttered. "Was I in your place I
reckon I'd do the same."</p>

<p>The smell of smoke drifted down the street. A sinuous tongue
of fire licked up a porch rail. The woman screamed at him.</p>

<p>"Now I know why they call you Black Dave! You call yourself a
man&mdash;and do this?"</p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded Denver.</p>

<p>"May!" said the woman, spitting it at him.</p>

<p>"A pretty name. The sort of a name that fitted the girl your
mother figured you'd be. There's pride still in you. You'd like
to kill me, wouldn't you? What for? For a man&mdash;a man not
worth an inch of your finger. You've lived in this ratty hole a
long spell, haven't you? No comforts, no safety, nothin'
cheerful. And all you've got to show for the bargain is that
bundle of clothes in your arm. You've been pretty badly
cheated."</p>

<p>"Who are you to talk?" she cried. "You're gloating because
you've hurt a few poor fools that can't hurt you back! You ought
to have the hide whipped off you!"</p>

<p>"I reckon the shoe begins to pinch," he replied. "You never
felt that way when your men folk rode back from killin' a man,
did you? You knew Lou Redmain was a killer, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"What of it? You're one yourself, you dog!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Denver slowly. "As black and dirty-handed
as any other. When a man starts on this business he swallows his
conscience and closes his mind. And before I'm finished you and
your kind, as well as a lot of other people, will consider me
worse than you ever considered another human bein'. This is war,
girl. And I'm deliberately forgettin' there ever was such a thing
as a white man in your tribe of cutthroats. Get in that wagon,
you people, and clear out of here. I don't care which way."</p>

<p>High flames shot from the pitch-dry buildings. The men who had
set the blaze dodged through the street, shielding themselves
from the increasing heat. Denver looked grimly at the black
giant.</p>

<p>"I said you'd be too slow. Redmain, wherever he is, will see
my message in a few minutes. Come on, boys."</p>

<p>He gathered his party and spurred up into timber. Lyle Bonnet
quartered down from a remote angle of the trees, where he had
been drawn by his ferreting curiosity.</p>

<p>"I think that outfit hit for the country back of Leverage's
place. Tracks indicate it."</p>

<p>"Well," snapped Hominy, "we've burned the rat out, anyhow.
That's one detail."</p>

<p>"Just one place we won't have to look for him," agreed Denver.
"But it's a long hunt yet. Redmain's got a talent for this
business. Close in here and listen to me careful. I want these
things done exactly like I tell you."</p>

<p>He looked behind. As they ran along the pine-cramped trail he
talked to Hominy and Bonnet in subdued phrases.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; FIRES AT NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">DENVER cantered down Prairie Street and racked
his horse before Grogan's around the middle of the afternoon.
Dismounting, he slipped the cinch of his saddle a trifle and
proceeded toward the saloon; but he was arrested on the threshold
by sound of his name. He swung to find Fear Langdell leaning out
of a second-story window.</p>

<p>"Dave, would you mind dropping up to my office a minute?"</p>

<p>Denver crossed the street and circled the last building on
that side. When he climbed the stairs and entered the hot little
cubicle he found Langdell pacing the floor. Without preliminaries
he broke into a kind of nervous talk entirely at variance with
his usual self-control.</p>

<p>"Good God, man, I haven't had a decent minute since your rider
came in with word that Steele was done up! Why, I talked to him
in this very room less than twenty-four hours ago. We discussed
our plans for the next few months. Now he's gone&mdash;like that.
Who killed him, Dave?"</p>

<p>"The ground was full of tracks," said Denver. "A big party.
Use your own judgment."</p>

<p>"You've made up your mind as to the killer, ain't you?"
insisted Langdell, stopping in the center of the room.</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Always a close-mouthed man, Dave," grunted Langdell. "You got
no call to be cagy with me. You know what I stand for. You know
my shoulder's to the wheel with Leverage."</p>

<p>"I'd still like you to use your own judgment," said Denver.
"My guess might be wrong."</p>

<p>"So?" retorted Langdell. "I observe you consider it a good
enough guess to act on it."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"That mess of no-accounts come in from the Wells. They'll be
kicked out of town before sun sets if I've anything to say."</p>

<p>"Let 'em alone, Fear. We're not fighting them. We're shootin'
for big game, not sparrows."</p>

<p>"So you fired the Wells?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Denver impassively.</p>

<p>Langdell threw his cigar out the window. "Ain't that a sort of
sweepin' thing to do?"</p>

<p>"If so," replied Denver, "I'm prepared to stand the
consequences. My way of doin' business is to make up my mind and
then move. I don't call a meetin' of the county and try to pass
the buck. If these big ranchers had stopped belly-achin' and done
their dirty chores long ago, Cal Steele would be alive
today."</p>

<p>Langdell's face turned sour. "For some queer reason," he
blurted out, "you set yourself against every idea I bring up. I'm
free to say I don't like it. I expect more of you, Dave."</p>

<p>"You expected me to lead the vigilantes once," pointed out
Denver. "But now that I do the logical thing, which is hit at
Redmain wherever I can, you back water. What do you want,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"I know, I know. But this is different. You're laying yourself
open to a charge of lawlessness."</p>

<p>"I don't see any particular legality in the acts of the
vigilantes," was Denver's cynical rejoinder.</p>

<p>"It's got the approval of every important rancher in Yellow
Hill," argued Langdell. "It's got the weight of the Association
behind it."</p>

<p>"Then my acts ought to have the same approval. I'm doing
neither less nor more than the vigilantes would do."</p>

<p>"Different altogether," insisted Langdell. "You're actin' as
an individual. If there was somebody mean enough to stand on due
form he could hook you bad at law."</p>

<p>"Was I you," drawled Denver, "I'd forget about law for a
while. It's been pretty feeble around here lately."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," exclaimed Langdell, "I was just trying to point
out something for your own protection. Now it looks like I'm
crawfishing on my published sentiments, which I'm not. But since
you intend to go after Redmain you ought to throw in with
Leverage."</p>

<p>"Disagree."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. More than that, I
know the kind of men riding with me. That's more than I can say
for the vigilantes. I still maintain some party or parties
unknown are grindin' axes with the vigilantes. I don't propose to
help 'em. I fight my own way."</p>

<p>"Of all the cursed nonsense!" broke in Langdell, shaking his
arm violently. "You ought to know better, Denver! You're the same
as questioning my honesty. Good Judas!"</p>

<p>A wagon and a group of riders came clattering down Prairie
Street. Denver rose and went to the window. Leverage, with a
dozen or more men, made a sort of escort to the wagon, which was
driven by Doc Williamson. In the bed of it lay a figure covered
with blankets. Denver turned sharply away.</p>

<p>"Never mind how I go about this business," he said. "The point
is, I'm after Redmain. And I'll get him if I go down in ruin.
Never think I won't!"</p>

<p>"Have it your own way," grunted Langdell. "Now that you've
burned out his quarters, what comes next?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered Denver.</p>

<p>"You mean you're not telling," corrected Langdell.</p>

<p>"Leave it like that if you want."</p>

<p>Langdell's cold, hard formality returned to him. Denver lifted
his shoulders and turned to leave, halting at the sound of
somebody coming rapidly up the stairs. Leverage walked into the
room. Seeing Denver, he nodded his head vigorously. "Good boy,
Dave. I hear you burned the Wells. Now we can work together.
Here, let me give you this confounded job of mine. I'm too old. I
think I've aged ten years in the last two weeks."</p>

<p>"You waste your breath," interrupted Langdell. "Dave wishes to
be the big toad in his own small puddle. He doubts the virtue of
everybody but himself."</p>

<p>"Maybe," was Denver's laconic reply. "Or maybe I ain't built
to dangle on the end of somebody's string. I'll leave the
Christian charity to you, Fear. You seem to be drippin' with
it."</p>

<p>Leverage caught the strained situation immediately. He had
entered the office expectantly, but when he saw Denver still to
be unchanged of opinion, that expectancy died. However, he made
haste to ease off the tension.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe I've got wind of Redmain now. I've been
ridin' fifteen and sixteen hours at a stretch. So's some of my
men. And we've got a smell."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Langdell with swift interest.</p>

<p>"Up behind my place. Across the Henry trail in the high
meadows. I got a rumor he's makin' a run for the valley tonight
with part of his bunch. I aim to ambush him, cut him off."</p>

<p>"Do it," snapped Langdell and pressed his lips together.</p>

<p>"Don't want to join me, Dave?" asked Leverage.</p>

<p>"I'm workin' it a little different," replied Denver. "Better
for us to go separate. But for your own sake, trust no rumor and
don't walk into any traps. Redmain's an Indian for that sort of
hocus-pocus."</p>

<p>"I guess I can take care of myself," answered Leverage, with a
trace of resentment.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Dave. "I won't presume to advise you again. May
see you tonight and may not. In either case, I'll be somewhere
around your territory."</p>

<p>"Don't let's ram into each other by mistake," warned
Leverage.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the door Denver paused and turned to catch
Fear Langdell's frosty, intent glance and so received the
definite knowledge of the man's personal antagonism to him. Going
back to the street he reflected on this. "Queer combination of
righteousness and bigotry. He despises anybody who don't track
with him."</p>

<p>They were taking Steele's body into Doc Williamson's place.
Denver veered off to Grogan's. A part of Leverage's men trailed
to the bar with him. It was quite apparent to him that they knew
about his recent activities and that they were anxious to find
out if he meant to throw in with the vigilantes. Range etiquette
forbade the open question, but it stood in their eyes,
nevertheless. And so, drinking and turning away, he answered it
in a roundabout fashion.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you boys," said he, and walked out of Grogan's.
Presently he was cantering from town.</p>

<p>He left dissatisfaction behind him. "What the hell's the
matter with that fella?" one of the vigilantes wanted to know.
"Too proud to talk to us?"</p>

<p>Another of the bunch was quick to defend Denver. "Keep yore
shirt on, Breed. He's got sense enough to keep his idees to
himself. If we'd quit publishin' our intentions to the world
mebbe we'd ketch a fish now and then. Don't worry about Dave
Denver. He's up to somethin', you bet."</p>

<p>Grogan lounged up to them. By and by he grunted. "Funny thing.
He comes right in, stays five minutes, and walks right out again.
Now, does that make sense?"</p>

<p>"If he didn't have a purpose," maintained Denver's defendant,
"he wouldn't 'a' been here. I know Dave."</p>

<p>"Well, what was his idee?" demanded Grogan.</p>

<p>"Yore guess is as good as mine," was the other man's abrupt
answer.</p>

<p>A slim, olive-colored little man emerged from the Palace,
climbed on a calico pony, and quietly left Sundown. He circled
the town, crossed the stage road a half mile behind the vanishing
Denver, and fell into a lesser trail. Twenty minutes later when
Denver was running along the flat stretch beyond Shoshone Dome
this fellow stood on a ridge and watched, and a little later
began a solitary game of distant stalking.</p>

<p><br>
Denver, meanwhile, was engaged in a mysterious game of his
own. A few miles beyond Shoshone Dome he drew beside the road,
dismounted, and went to a stump. He capsized a loose rock, and
found a piece of paper. There was a scribble of words on it. With
a pencil he added a line of his own, signed his initials and put
the paper back. After that he raced up and down the hairpin
curves until he arrived at the Sweet Creek bridge. Here again he
imitated his first performance under the timbers of the bridge;
and again travelled with the highway as it swooped into the
valley of Sundown. Presently he was at the mouth of Starlight.
But instead of turning for home he tarried to study the distant
reaches of the road. Cattle and men filled it yonder, emerging
from a hill trail. He advanced at a set pace and found a half-
dozen men from Fear Langdell's ranch driving approximately two
hundred head of stock to the south. Langdell's foreman came
up&mdash;a long, lean man with a cheerful drawl.</p>

<p>"We crossed yore territory, Dave," said the foreman. "Want to
cut this bunch for strays?"</p>

<p>"I'll just take a stand down the road a bit and watch 'em
pass," replied Denver. He went on a distance, drew aside, and
rolled a cigarette. The foreman followed him.</p>

<p>"Got goin' awful late. We won't make the railroad today. Nice
critters for the market, ain't they?"</p>

<p>Denver's glance went expertly through the passing line of
cattle, reading brands. Most of the stuff was in Langdell's own
original brand; but at odd intervals he saw steers Cal Steele had
sold to Langdell for shipping; recognizable as such by the
vent&mdash;a small replica of the owner's brand&mdash;each
carried on its hip. Denver suddenly dropped his cigarette and
crowded his pony into the stream of stock, coming abreast an
enormous brute with sweeping horns and a red blaze on an
otherwise cream head. He leaned down, passed his palm across the
brand, and looked carefully at the earmarks. When he withdrew
from the procession Langdell's foreman was once more beside
him.</p>

<p>"What's the caper, Dave? That's a Steele steer we bought last
week to ship."</p>

<p>"Ahuh. Just wanted to look closer at the ugly critter. Well, I
find nothing here belonging to me. See you later."</p>

<p>The outfit went by, the bawling and the shouting diminished
downgrade. As long as man or beast remained in sight Denver kept
his position, scarcely moving a muscle. But the cast of his face
slowly changed, lines deepening, lips compressing. Through his
mind raced an unpleasant truth. That steer had worn a Fee brand
last year. He was certain because he remembered finding the
animal strayed into his own stock. And he had driven it back
across the Copperhead bridge to Fee territory. No mistake about
that. Undeniably the same Fee beef now going to market with Cal
Steele's brand.</p>

<p>Of course such things honestly happened now and then.
Cattlemen sold to other cattlemen; or in adjusting occasional
cases of misbranding at roundup time they swapped beef to rectify
these errors. But what overthrew either of these possible
explanations was the fact that this particular steer had lost his
Fee brand. Steele's brand proclaimed to the wide world that the
steer had originated as a Steele beef. There was only one
answer&mdash;a switching of marks, a careful and expert
doctoring. His eyes had picked up no suspicious blurring; but his
inspecting palm had felt the slight roughness and variance of the
outer ridges. Even so, had he not known that steer by sight, he
would have passed it as a genuine Steele product. And since both
Steele and Fee used the same small underhack on the ears of their
cattle, the switch would pass any casual observer's
inspection.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath, wishing he had never seen the steer.
There were other explanations, he told himself. Yet common sense
kept insisting that no matter what explanation he might conjure
up to protect the memory of his friend, somebody's treachery was
at the bottom of this change. The black mystery of the country
had cast its shadow even over the man he loved above all
others.</p>

<p>He stiffened in the saddle. Brush swirled beside him. A body
shifted, out of sight, and a soft voice spoke to him. He caught
himself after the first sidewise glance and stared impassively
down the road.</p>

<p>"Joe Hollis saw riders passin' across the Henry trail from
where he was hid, Dave. He passed the word along the line. And
Lyle Bonnet placed Redmain's bunch in one of the high pockets
about seven miles west of Leverage's place. Seemed like they was
takin' it easy. Saddles off."</p>

<p>Denver spoke from the side of his mouth. "Go back. Collect the
boys where the Leverage back trail runs into the Henry. I'll be
along a couple hours after dark. But tell Lyle not to let 'em out
of his sight. If they move, follow. In such a case, leave one man
at the junction spot to meet me, and another one or two along the
line so I'll know where to come. Get going, and be careful.
There's somebody scouting me."</p>

<p>He spurred along the road to Starlight and went rapidly up.
Two miles in from the highway he saw a fresh track across the
soft earth and cut down the side of the canyon. The sun was
dipping over the western range when he cantered across the D
Slash yard and dismounted. He threw his horse into the corral and
joined the remnant of his crew at the supper table.</p>

<p>They had nothing to report, these restless home guards. They
had worked the lower corner of D Slash range and found everything
proper. Steve Steers had come along during the middle of the
afternoon with a small bunch of D Slash strays. They had told him
of Steele's death.</p>

<p>"And I thought he was a-goin' to shoot me when I spilled the
news," said Dan Russell. "Never saw a fella stiffen up thataway.
He wanted to know where you was, and I said I figgered mebbe
yuh'd be home to eat supper. He rode off like a bat outa hell.
Didn't bother to take four cows and beavertails we had fer
him."</p>

<p>Denver nodded. "Comes hard on him. He'd bunch any other job in
the world to join this chase. But he can't walk out on
Nightingale. I bet he's stampin' the earth."</p>

<p>"Well, now," put in Russell, "ain't it about time us fellas
got into this jam? Shucks, we're entitled to some fun. What's the
percentage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tonight," replied Denver, "you boys stick right here. Burn
all the lights on the place. Make lots of noise. Somebody stay in
the main house&mdash;as if it was me. Baldy, rope out the gelding
for me. Also, three-four of you get into the kitchen and help Si
slap up a mess of sandwiches. I'll be carryin' 'em back to the
bunch in the hills."</p>

<p>"How about knittin' some mufflers?" grunted Russell, full of
discontent. "If this ain't the damnedest&mdash;"</p>

<p>Steve Steers and Al Niland appeared at the dining-room door.
Denver got up from the table and walked back into the living room
with them, carefully closing the door.</p>

<p>"Missed you by ten minutes in Sundown," said Steve tersely. "I
never stopped ridin', once I got the news."</p>

<p>"Go back to your business, Steve."</p>

<p>"Is that all the advice you got for me?" challenged Steers.
"You ridin' tonight? Then so am I. And so is Al."</p>

<p>"Listen to reason. You can't leave Nightingale in the lurch.
Do you think this is just a one-night affair? It ain't. Nobody
knows when the last of it will come. You've got no business
slashin' around the hills, leavin' Nightingale's range wide open
to Redmain. You know it."</p>

<p>"So that's the way I stand by my friends, is it?" was Steve's
bitter retort.</p>

<p>"I guess I've got to hit from the shoulder," stated Denver.
"You've always been a wild-eyed buzzard. There never was a job
you wouldn't quit in a minute. Well, here's one time when you've
got to measure up to your job. It ain't a question of what you
want to do. It's a question of what comes first. You're foreman
of a ranch&mdash;and it's up to you to see it ain't robbed
poor."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, slap the spurs into me," grunted Steve petulantly.
"What's one Englishman's cows to me stacked up beside Cal Steele?
Oh, damnation, I reckon yore right!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, he is," broke in Niland. "There's more angles to this
Redmain business than just foggin' him. Maybe he wants everybody
to go on a wild-goose chase after him. Never any way of tellin'
what that quick mind of his is hatchin'."</p>

<p>"Just so," agreed Denver. "And that lets you out of any ridin'
for a while, too. I've got something I want you to do."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"I want you to nose around Sundown and find out how long
Steele had been sellin' stock to Fear Langdell."</p>

<p>The other two stared at Denver in an almost startled manner.
Steve Steers was puzzled; Al Niland's much sharper mind cut right
through to Denver's unspoken reason. But in spite of that and in
spite of the fact Denver was one of his closest friends, he
parried. "Why? What do you know about those transactions that
don't please you?"</p>

<p>Denver drew a long breath. "What do you know about them,
Al?"</p>

<p>Niland shook his head. "I never pried into Steele's affairs.
If you got anything on your mind, let's know it."</p>

<p>"Get away from bein' a lawyer for a minute," muttered Denver.
"I saw somethin' different on your face."</p>

<p>"I'd never judge a man by unsubstantiated thoughts," was
Niland's very slow answer. "Cal had a habit of goin' into fits of
depression sometimes. And he'd say a few flimsy things. But that
ain't anything to speak about."</p>

<p>Steve finally caught up with the train of thought. "Here,
here, you fellas, what you tryin' to cook up?"</p>

<p>"What I say must never be repeated," said Denver. "It must die
right here, understand? Never to be spoken again&mdash;even if it
takes perjury to cover it."</p>

<p>"That's unnecessary for you to say," Niland reminded him.</p>

<p>Denver came to a stand in front of them. "I found a steer in
Langdell's shipment this afternoon. It was one Steele had sold
him last week. It had Steele's original brand and Steele's vent
mark. No other brand. But last year it was a Fee cow. I
recognized it. No chance for mistake."</p>

<p>To a man in cattle country this needed no explanation at all.
Niland and Steers were dumbly silent. It was natural that Steers,
being absolutely loyal, should mirror shocked belief; and it was
equally natural that Niland, with his knowledge of human error,
should slowly nod his head. Through the open doors came a soft
wind. The crew strolled along the yard. The bell-like clarity of
an owl's hoot floated in. Denver went on: "I have figured this
thing backward and forward, and I continually come to a
conclusion I despise. There's other ways of explainin' it. There
might be a crook in Steele's crew who is plasterin' other
critters with the Steele brand for his own profit. But how would
such a fellow cash in? I don't see that. It's also possible
Redmain might have done the job in the hope it would be
discovered and so discredit Steele. Yet I doubt it. That switch
from Fee to Steele was absolutely an expert job. I wouldn't have
noticed it unless I'd personally hazed the cow last year."</p>

<p>"Well, then," broke in Niland, "what's the answer?"</p>

<p>"Whatever the answer," said Denver quickly, "we keep it to
ourselves. Forever. Cal Steele is dead, and he's entitled to his
clear reputation. He'll have it, if I've got to turn Yellow Hill
upside down. But somehow or other Redmain's in this. And I'd like
to know more about Fear Langdell's connection. Did he buy from
Cal Steele knowing about the blotting or not?"</p>

<p>Niland's face began to lighten up. "If I could nail that man
to the cross after all he's done in the name of justice I'd give
my seat in heaven! I wonder if that's why he filed his request
with the judge to act as executor to Steele's estate? To cover
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never say it," warned Denver. "But you've got to get in there
and find out, somehow."</p>

<p>One of the hands ambled through the front door. "Hawss is
ready for yuh, Dave." The owl's sentinel signal echoed again.
Denver lifted his head, becoming aware of the sound. "So you've
both got your work cut out," he went on. "We won't ever get the
whole story straight. Steele will never tell his part. Redmain's
beyond the talking stage. There's nothing left but to go after
him, never give him peace. That's what I propose to do.
As&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off and moved for the door. The hoot of the owl had
become too insistent. Crossing the porch he descended into the
darkness of the yard. The call came again, along the ridge.
Advancing toward it, he reached the grade. A question came
through the blanket of shadows. "Denver?"</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"It's us&mdash;Meems and Wango. We want to see yuh."</p>

<p>"Then come down here like white men. What's all this hocus-
pocus for?"</p>

<p>"Well," came Meems's solemn answer, "we got a decent respeck
fer our hides. We're comin'&mdash;but not into the lights. What
we got to say is private, is that a go?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>The two shuffled forward. "You'll keep the source o' this
inf'mation to y'self?" insisted Meems.</p>

<p>"I said I would."</p>

<p>"Yore word's enough with us. It ain't none of our business,
y'unnerstan'? But yore in this fight and it jest didn't seem
right holdin' back. Only, don't give us away, and don't ask us to
testify. When we're through talkin' we drift. See?"</p>

<p>"Get it out of your system," grunted Denver.</p>

<p>"We was just a-leavin' the dance last night when a fella come
ridin' outa the dark. We seen him go acrost the bridge and as fur
as the schoolhouse. He didn't come back that-away. But when we
heard about Steele we jest put one and one together. Mebbe it
makes two. Mebbe it was the gent that drawed Steele away from the
dance."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>Meems sighed and let the silence stretch out. "I'll speak the
name," said he finally, "and yore free to act on it. But yore the
only man in God's green footstool I'd do such a thing for. And
forget who told yuh."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Denver.</p>

<p>"It was Stinger Dann," muttered Meems; and as soon as the name
was spoken both men backed off and were lost to sight. Denver
heard them ride rapidly away.</p>

<p>As for himself, he strode to the house at half a run. Niland
and Steers both caught the blaze of light on his face and came
nearer.</p>

<p>"I have found the man who pulled Steele away from the dance.
It was Dann. Whatever Cal's connection with Redmain, I think he
started away from that schoolhouse with the idea of protecting my
stock. Remember, he was shot on my range&mdash;and Redmain's men
were there. Trying to protect me from that bunch of killers."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he'd have no truck with Dann or&mdash;" Steve
started to say, half-heartedly. But Niland broke in.</p>

<p>"There's part of the story. No matter how far into Redmain's
scheme he might have been, he'd still stick up for you or the
rest of us. Dammit, Dave, Redmain must have hooked him into this
dirty mess!"</p>

<p>"If I didn't think so," was Denver's sober reply, "I wouldn't
be riding now."</p>

<p>"Be doggone careful," grunted Steve Steers. "I hate this
business of me laggin' behind."</p>

<p>Denver was already on the gelding. He ran up the hillside to
the trail, went a few hundred yards along its familiar course,
and abruptly switched to a dim side trace. The ground buckled up
from ravine to ravine, and the dim stars gave him no sight.
Nevertheless, he pressed the gelding on, suddenly fell into the
Sundown-Ysabel Junction road, and settled to a long run. Down the
hairpin turns with steel flashing on gravel; over the Sweet Creek
bridge, on along the level stretch that led around to Starlight
and thence to the open prairie. Short of Starlight a mile he
veered to the right and went with equal rapidity through massed
pines. Then the gloom was broken by the wink of a ranch light,
and he rode up to Leverage's gate. The wheeze of the hinges was
like an alarm. Nearing the porch, he was challenged by an
invisible guard.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Denver. Where is Jake?"</p>

<p>"You tell me and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"Can you reach him?"</p>

<p>"Sorry."</p>

<p>The front door of the house opened. Eve stood framed in the
glowing yellow rectangle. "That you, David? Come in."</p>

<p>Denver stepped to the porch. "I reckon I haven't time. I'm
tryin' to find your dad." He heard the intake of her breath. "Is
it important?"</p>

<p>"Eve," called the unseen guard gruffly, "you shouldn't stand
in the light."</p>

<p>Dave drew her out, shut the door. "I consider it
important."</p>

<p>She dropped her voice. "He left here before
supper&mdash;alone. I think he's riding beyond the Henry trail
with the vigilantes. That's all I know."</p>

<p>Once more the guard's cautioning words cut in. "Yuh shouldn't
peddle no inf'mation to nobody, Eve. How do we know?"</p>

<p>But Eve had a temper of her own. "Clyde, will you hush! You're
covering too much territory."</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll pick up his tracks," said Denver. "I'm headin'
that way."</p>

<p>"David&mdash;there's something in the wind tonight?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Denver.</p>

<p>Her hand rested light as thistledown on his shoulder. "Oh,
David, if I were only a man! Not to shoot and destroy, but just
to be along. Anything is better than this uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. Your dad's got a big bunch with him."</p>

<p>"Do you think he is the only one I worry about?" asked the
girl softly.</p>

<p>"Bless you for that," muttered Denver. "I've always been a
hand to think I did very well ridin' the single trail. But when
you say somethin' real comfortin' like that to me it's mighty
pleasant. It sticks with me a long time. I guess a man never
realizes what loneliness is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bit off the rest of it and turned away. "No time to lose
now. Don't worry."</p>

<p>"You should never ride by yourself after dark," said Eve.</p>

<p>He was in the saddle. "If your dad comes back very soon tell
him Redmain's been located in a high meadow due east of here
about seven miles. Tell him to watch out for a trap. Redmain
never strikes direct. He's too tricky for that."</p>

<p>"And yourself, Dave?"</p>

<p>"I was told today," he said morosely, "that I was as much of a
savage as Redmain. I reckon I'll be all right. So-long till I see
you."</p>

<p>"So-long, David."</p>

<p>He cut around the house, and fell in with the western trail. A
few rods from Leverage's it began to warp with the rising slope.
The cleared meadows fell off, and he was riding once again in the
abysmal shades of the forest. And around ten o'clock of the night
he reached the Henry trail, feeling the presence of a man about
him. Quietly he let a phrase fall into the utter silence.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Denver?" questioned a husky voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Hank Munn."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Still up yonder to the west. We better drift."</p>

<p>"Lead off."</p>

<p>Munn came out of the trees, rode across the Henry trail and
proceeded due west, Denver following. The path was narrow,
extremely crooked, and overhung by branches that swooped down to
rake them as they passed. Munn put up with the tedious vagaries
of the path until a small clearing appeared. At that point he
swapped directions, hurried over the open space, and with another
sudden shift went down a glen soaked in fog. Water guttered
across stones. The horses splashed through a creek and attacked a
stiff bank with bunched muscles. Presently Munn halted in black
nowhere and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Munn forged on a few hundred yards. Again
he coughed. Out of the brush rode a sentry.</p>

<p>"Munn?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. What made yuh drag yore picket?"</p>

<p>No answer. Munn dropped back to second place as this new
outpost led them on. More turns, more offset alleys through the
pines, yet always climbing toward some high point; a high point
they abruptly came upon after a hundred yards of end-over-end
ascent. There was a murmured challenge ahead. Men closed in. Lyle
Bonnet spoke from a short distance. "Dave?"</p>

<p>"What've you got, Lyle?"</p>

<p>"Come over here. Here. Look off down yonder."</p>

<p>Denver crowded his horse beside Bonnet and saw, far below, a
point of flame shimmering through the rolling fog; rising and
falling and trembling with a queer, shutter-like effect.</p>

<p>"Redmain's camp," said Bonnet. "I been watchin' it better'n
four hours. Saw 'em movin' around until the fog came in. Can't
make out nothin' but the fire now. All the boys is here. And it's
up to you."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; SURROUNDED</h2>

<p class="first">"DONE any exploring down there?" Denver
asked.</p>

<p>"I got boys posted along the ridge here, but nobody's scouted
that bowl. I was afraid of losin' 'em, and I didn't want to bring
on no premature fightin'. They prob'ly got the brush speckled
with gents."</p>

<p>"Good enough. Munn, where are you? Drift along and collect the
bunch right here. I'm going down. Need another man."</p>

<p>"Right beside yuh," announced Bonnet.</p>

<p>Denver paused long enough to issue his orders. "If you fellows
hear one shot, come along. If you hear more than one shot, also
come along, but don't waste any time. Otherwise wait for us."</p>

<p>He turned from the ridge. Bonnet muttered. "A little to yore
left&mdash;there's a good way of gettin' below." Accordingly,
Denver slipped away from the main party, let himself down what
appeared to be a convenient alley, and immediately was plunged
into a black and solitary world. The avenue of approach shot one
way and another, drifting from high levels to water holes and
back again. Perceptibly the outlaw camp fire brightened and the
fog thinned. Bonnet breathed in his ear. "This is one of the two-
three entries to the bowl. They'd be apt to have it guarded."
Denver accepted the warning and abandoned the easy travel.
Curling around the trees, he circled the beacon fire until he
judged he had completed an approximate quarter turn. Bonnet's
wind rose and fell asthmatically; then Denver plunged forward in
long and staggered spurts. A thick rampart of trees shut out the
gleam of the fire. He halted once more, waiting for Bonnet to
catch up. Bonnet murmured, "Not far now," and Denver cut straight
through the trees to find himself on the smooth rim of the bowl.
Fifty yards off the camp blaze shot up with a brilliant cascade
of sparks. A man threw an armful of wood on it and quickly
retreated to outer darkness.</p>

<p>That move evoked a sudden suspicion in Denver's head. Where
were the horses and the men of Redmain's outfit? Certainly not
anywhere along this particular angle of the bowl. He touched
Bonnet's arm and began a swift march around the rim. He saw a man
crouching beside a horse. By degrees he came nearer. The man's
cigarette tip made a fitful glow; the horse stirred. For a long
time Denver kept his place, trying to penetrate the gloom behind
that man. But he saw nothing. To all intents and purposes that
fellow was a solitary watcher. And as the dragging minutes passed
Denver definitely accepted the belief. Redmain had posted a decoy
and fled.</p>

<p>There was but one conclusion to draw. Redmain somehow had
caught wind of the forces moving against him and was now playing
his own particular game under the black cloak of the night.
Denver stared at the fire guard. He touched Bonnet on the knee
and whispered, "Stay here." Curving with the tree line, he
arrived in the rear of the outlaw. A hundred feet intervened.
Stepping ahead in long, springing strides he reached the horse at
the moment it jerked up. The man sprang to his feet and grunted.
"Who's that?" Denver's gun leveled against him.</p>

<p>"Snap your elbows."</p>

<p>The outlaw swayed as if calling on his nerve. But the fighting
moment went winging by. He was lost, and he knew it. His hands
rose.</p>

<p>"Step this way," grunted Denver. "Turn around. Stand fast."
His free hand shot out and ripped the man's gun from its holster.
He tucked it behind his own belt. The outlaw jeered him with a
sudden revival of spirit.</p>

<p>"A hell of a lot of good this'll do yuh."</p>

<p>"You're lucky to be out of what's comin'. Anybody else around
here?"</p>

<p>"Think I'd tell if they was?" growled the outlaw.</p>

<p>"Just a catamount of wheels, ain't you," reflected Denver.
"Walk over to the fire where I can see you."</p>

<p>The outlaw obeyed. He had a strange face, and Denver commented
on it. "Another slick-eared gun fanner from other parts. Redmain
must have a young army."</p>

<p>"Big enough to whip the tar outa you, once ever yuh tackle
it," stated the outlaw coolly.</p>

<p>"We'll have a chance to find out soon enough," said Denver.
"But you'll have no part in the fun."</p>

<p>"The Sundown jail won't hold me," challenged the outlaw.</p>

<p>"Your ticket don't read that far," was Denver's laconic
answer. This stopped the outlaw dead. His teeth clicked together,
and the bones of his face sprang against the tightening skin.</p>

<p>"So that's yore style, uh?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"You seem to like the life. So don't bellyache over your pay.
Come on, Lyle. He's alone."</p>

<p>Bonnet came swiftly around the fire. "We better get organized,
Dave. How about shakin' this specimen down?"</p>

<p>"Where'd Redmain go?" demanded Denver, shooting the question
at the outlaw.</p>

<p>"I ain't sayin'."</p>

<p>"You've got a bare chance of escapin' the rope," Denver warned
him. "Talk up. Where'd he go?"</p>

<p>"I'll take my funeral and be damned to you! I don't squawk in
the first place, and in the second place I'd never expect no
mercy from Black Dave Denver even if I did tell. You take a long
run and jump for yoreself."</p>

<p>"My-my," said Bonnet. "How would you like a belt in the mug?
It might loosen your thoughts some."</p>

<p>The outlaw stood sullenly defiant. Denver brooded over him.
"Who told Redmain that Leverage came across the Henry trail
tonight lookin' for him?"</p>

<p>The outlaw flung up his head and laughed ironically. "Mebbe
you'd like to know what Redmain knows. I'll say&mdash;" Out of
the south came a sputter of shots. Denver cursed and raised his
gun to the sky, letting go a single bullet. Again the night wind
bore down echoes of trouble. This time the firing rose strongly
sustained. The outlaw wrenched himself backward, yelling.</p>

<p>"There's yore answer, damn yuh! We'll do what we please in
this country afore we're through!"</p>

<p>"What the devil!" snapped Bonnet, staring at Denver.</p>

<p>"Leverage," said the latter with an electric bitterness, "has
run into a trap." He fired again, threw out the weapon's
cylinder, and replaced the spent cartridges. Going to the
outlaw's horse, he untied the rope, and shook the loop over the
man. The outlaw protested. "Good God, don't tear me apart with
that string!"</p>

<p>Denver's men swarmed over the clearing. Hank Munn charged up
to the fire, leading the horses of Bonnet and Denver. Denver
beckoned the man. "You&mdash;take this buzzard we've caught and
herd him back to my ranch. Tell the boys to keep him."</p>

<p>"Why bother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got your walkin' papers," said Denver, stepping into
his saddle. Without warning he spurred into the timber. He fell
upon a trail and righted himself; the horse labored mightily. He
came to the summit and for a moment groped his way clumsily
through brushy underfooting. The horse saved him the necessity of
search, kicked clear, and reached a broader pathway. So he lined
out to the southward with his men strung behind; Bonnet's urgent
call to close up was echoed still farther back by Hominy
Hogg.</p>

<p>This was not the side of Yellow Hill with which he was very
familiar. He knew the terrain only in the sense that every rider
of cattleland has a rough contour map in his head of whatever
lies within fifty or a hundred miles of home range. His sense of
direction told him he traveled in a parallel line with the Henry
trail, which ran somewhere off in the eastern blackness; his ears
told him he was headed into the drawn-out fight yonder to the
south.</p>

<p>The firing came clearer, swelling to a pitched volume and
dying off to scattered volleys. From the changing tempo Denver
almost was able to see the fight&mdash;the sudden locking of
forces, the milling and the swirling, the abrupt buckling into
shelter, and the stealthy groping for advantage in the pitch-
black night. Redmain had timed his maneuvers perfectly. He could
only have done so through clear information as to the parties
moving against him. The fact that he had left a fire burning and
rode away to begin a pitched engagement was proof of it. Plainly
Leverage had moved into a trap and was now fighting for his life.
Leverage was an honest man, a plugger. But never for a minute
could he match the tricky touch-and-go brilliance of Lou Redmain.
It wasn't in the cards.</p>

<p>He was coursing down a long and straight grade. Lyle Bonnet
drew up, neck and tail, and shouted, "It ain't far now! I think
they're scrappin' near Peachey's Burn! If we keep on like this
we'll smack right into a crossfire! How about drawin' up just
before we hit it?"</p>

<p>Denver stiffened in his seat. All the while his straining ears
had been fastened to the sharp echoes; it came to him with a
shock that he was listening into a queer lull. The firing had
ceased. The gloom of the trail widened into a gray circle. Bonnet
called again. "This is that old hermit's clearin'. We're only a
half mile&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little clearing spilled over with sound. Horsemen smashed
out from yonder side. Denver cried, "Pull up!" and was surrounded
by his own men as they drove out of the trail. A gun's shattering
blast beat into his group. Denver shouted. "Leverage&mdash;stop
shootin'!" And from the growing mass of riders emerged a
challenge. "To hell with Leverage!" Followed by a pour of
lead.</p>

<p>"Redmain!" yelled Denver and spurred his horse. "Spread
out&mdash;let 'em have it!"</p>

<p>"Come and get it, Denver!"</p>

<p>It was mad, riotous confusion. He was jammed elbow and elbow
with his own men; Redmain's riders plunged on. He saw them
shifting rapidly across the cleared area; he opened a point-blank
fire, crying a warning. "Spread out&mdash;spread out!" Outlaw and
posse raced around the fringes of the meadow. Every man was on
his own, and in the center a dozen of them had met in a wicked
hand-to-hand encounter. He thought he heard Redmain, but wasn't
sure. Dann's bellow was too barbaric to be missed. He hauled his
pony out of the whirl and cut across.</p>

<p>"Come on, D Slash! Follow me!"</p>

<p>Right on the heels of the challenge a rider shot from the
massed and weaving figures and drove into him. The belch of
powder covered his face. He veered aside, firing at the bobbing
target. There was a yell, a terrible guttering of breath; rider
and horseman alike disappeared into the mle. Denver plunged on,
feeling his men behind. But the target he aimed for had shifted.
Shifted and given ground. Dann bellowed again, deeper in the
woods; and like phantoms Redmain's men slipped away through the
trees. Hominy Hogg spurred past Denver.</p>

<p>"I know this trail!" he bawled. "Come on!"</p>

<p>Denver heard Dann again, a few yards to the left; he galloped
between the clustered pine trunks and rammed a turning rider. An
arm reached out, slashed down, missed his head by an inch and
struck into his thigh with the barrel of a gun. He clamped the
gun in his left hand, beat back with his own weapon, and heard a
bone snap. His antagonist gasped and tried to fight clear. Both
horses pitched. Denver crooked his right elbow about a sagging
head and dragged the man bodily from the saddle; his left hand
ripped the fellow's weapon clear, and at that point he let the
man fall and spurred away.</p>

<p>The encounter had taken no more than two or three minutes, but
in that space of time both the pursued and the pursuers were far
ahead. Denver fought through the brush, ran into a fresh deadfall
whose branches would not let him pass over, and swung to skirt
it. Still he found no trail. An occasional shot drummed back.
Riders were drifting all over the country. Presently the horse
seemed to find a clear pathway and went along it. Denver
considered himself being pulled too far northward and attempted
to angle in the other direction. Each attempt brought him sooner
or later to some sort of a barrier. Back on the trail he decided
to return to the clearing and make a fresh start. He hauled about
and heard a rustling dead ahead. Another rider darkly barred his
path.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" said the man huskily.</p>

<p>Denver had the feeling a gun was trained on him. "You tell me
and I'll tell you," was his grim retort.</p>

<p>"I don't make yore voice."</p>

<p>"Maybe I've got a cold," muttered Denver, feeling his way
along. Any D Slash man would know his voice, though some of the
Steele outfit might not. The reverse was also true. It was
possible that this might be a Steele hand.</p>

<p>"Well, well," grunted the man, "we can't stay here all night.
Let's get it over with. You sing out and so will I. We done spent
enough time in these god-forsaken trees."</p>

<p>"Sounds to me," observed Denver, "that you don't like this
part of the country."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so&mdash;mebbe not. Depends. It's good for some people
and not so good for others."</p>

<p>"Come far?" asked Denver.</p>

<p>"In one way, yes. In another way, no."</p>

<p>"Had a square meal, lately?"</p>

<p>The man thought that one over carefully. "Brother, you got a
ketch in that. I eat now and then."</p>

<p>"Just what part of the country are we in?" pressed Denver.</p>

<p>"You want to know, or do you want to know if I know?" parried
the other.</p>

<p>"Let it ride. Your turn now, fella. If you got any ideas how
to break the ice let's hear 'em."</p>

<p>"How about you and me lightin' matches at the same time?"</p>

<p>"A good item," agreed Denver. "We'll count to ten and
strike."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if we will," said the man, suddenly changing his
mind. "You fell too quick. Must have somethin' up yore sleeve.
No, it's out. I tell you&mdash;supposin' we just natcherlly turn
about and ride in opposite directions?"</p>

<p>"You sure we want to go in them directions?"</p>

<p>"What directions?" said the man cautiously.</p>

<p>"What directions have you got?" drawled Denver.</p>

<p>"Good God, am I goin' nuts?"</p>

<p>"I'd have to know you better to tell." Denver shifted in his
saddle. He heard a creaking of leather, and finally an irritable
mumble. "What you doin' over there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, brother, nothing at all."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm doin', and I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Got your gun leveled on me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You lie like a horse," said Denver.</p>

<p>"Let it ride, then," said the other and began to swear.
"Supposin' I have? If I thought you was what I got an idea yuh
are, I'd knock yuh outa the saddle and no regrets. Yellow Clay
County&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denver let his arm drift down. It touched, gripped, and drew
the gun clear. He broke in softly. "You're one of Redmain's
imported gun slingers, mister."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The name of this county's Yellow Hill!"</p>

<p>The explanation all but cost him his life. A bullet bit at the
brim of his hat before his first shot blasted into the eddying
echo of the other. The shadow in front became but half a shadow,
the upper part melting down. He heard a stifled moan; the man's
horse bucked away and stopped. Denver advanced five yards, swung
down, and lit a match. The first flare of light was enough. And
there was a cropped sweat on his own face.</p>

<p>"High stakes for that gamble," he muttered, pinching out the
match. That was all. He turned his pony and started along the
trail. Every vestige of pursuit had died in the distance.
Somewhere Redmain's men were slipping through the trees,
collecting again, and somewhere his own riders were groping as
blindly as he was. At the end of five minutes he detected a fork
of the trail, and he took the one going south. It was a bad
guess; after some three hundred yards it stopped and jumped aside
like a jackrabbit. He accepted the offshoot wearily. So he
drifted, feeling himself sliding more to the north-west. After a
time he ceased to keep count with the changing trails; and when
he did that he automatically lost himself. Somewhere around one
or two in the morning he cast up his accounts mentally, drew into
the secretive brush, tied his horse short, and unsaddled. He
wrapped himself in the saddle blanket, gouged a channel to fit
his hips, and was soundly asleep.</p>

<p>The training of the range man will not let him sleep beyond
dawn; and his vitality springs freshly up after a few short hours
of rest, no matter how much physical punishment has gone before.
This is his birthright, and never does he lose it until the day
he forsakes the queer combination of sweaty drudgery and wild
freedom of cattleland and tries another trade. The regularity,
the comforts, and the pleasures of the city man may come to him.
But never again will he wake as Dave Denver did on this morning,
alive, buoyant, energy driving through him; and never will he see
through the same vision the first bright shafts of dawn transfix
the gray mists. For a thousand such mornings the outcast range
man may have cursed himself from his blankets; but looking back
upon that time he will wistfully know the best of himself was
left there.</p>

<p>Saddling, Denver took the trail again. To the south it was
still dark. But ahead and northward the country lightened up
rapidly. The trail widened, climbed considerably, and at last
left the trees altogether; and he found himself standing on the
rim of one of the innumerable small holes framed within the
hills. The trail dropped down without much ceremony to the floor
of the hole. A half mile onward the hole narrowed to a rocky
throat. He thought he saw a trail shooting up the ridge to the
right of this throat, but the fog, though diminishing, was still
thick enough to blur his view.</p>

<p>"Tom's Hole," he grunted. "Great guns, I've dragged my picket
halfway to the Moguls. Now, what to do? Straight back, or across
the hole?"</p>

<p>To retreat meant bucking a lot of rugged terrain that he knew
little enough about. But he was clear enough in his geography to
reflect that beyond the north end of the hole was an east-west
road which would carry him into Sundown Valley. His men also knew
the road, and it stood to reason that those who had lost contact
with the main party would probably drift that way as soon as they
oriented themselves. It was no use considering a scout through
the timber for them.</p>

<p>He knew some of his party had been hit, and it worried him.
Those who had been knocked out in the meadow would be taken care
of by now, for he remembered that, in the heat of the chase, he
had told somebody to stay behind. And Leverage would be coming
up. But he wanted to assemble the outfit and count noses.
Possibly he would have to scout the timber for a few missing
men.</p>

<p>Where Redmain was he had not the slightest idea. All his work
in establishing isolated pickets to check the trails had been
swept away and would have to be done over again. The first thing
was to get organized; and with that in mind he dipped down into
the hole as the tendrils of mist began to steam up from the earth
like smoke from volcanic fumaroles.</p>

<p>"The first trick belongs to Redmain," he reflected dourly. "He
juggled Leverage and me neat as you please, struck twice and got
away. There's a leak a mile wide somewhere on our side of the
fence. He knew all about Leverage's moves; and apparently he knew
about mine, or guessed well. None of my riders would go bad; some
of the Steele men might. I'll have to do some weeding. And I'll
have to play fox better."</p>

<p>He cantered across the bottom of the hole, aiming for the now
distinct trail at the far end. High on one rim he saw a doe
emerge from the trees; and the next minute he halted, correcting
his mistake. It was a small pony. From another angle a man
stepped out and lifted a rifle. The peace of the morning was
shattered by a rolling report. A jet of earth kicked up five
yards short of him.</p>

<p>He reached for his own rifle in the boot and jumped from the
saddle. The man lowered his gun. Another gun crack broke over the
hole. Flat on his belly Denver swept the circling rim, unable to
locate the second ambusher. Methodically he laid a line on the
first man and fired; but his target had dropped from view.
Another shot landed directly beneath his horse. Denver jumped
into the saddle and whirled to run back up the grade. Immediately
he saw it was blocked by three or four riders. He swung again and
sank his spurs, racing for the northern mouth of the hole. He was
a fair target, and the high rim seemed suddenly to sprout
marksmen. They opened at will, wasting lead all around him. Lying
flat in the saddle he flung his pony on toward protection of the
rocks and was within a hundred yards of them when he saw this
exit to be blocked as well.</p>

<p>A hat and gun popped into sight. Denver swerved, accepting the
only other course open, which was the trail that climbed steeply
beside the rocks. He let the horse have its head and pumped a
brace of bullets at the fellow. Twenty feet on up he commanded
the man's shelter and fired again. The gelding trembled with the
effort he put into the climb; Denver quit worrying about the
other guns trained on him from the rear. The man below, having no
means of security from the overhead Denver, began to scurry
blindly. The trail clung to the very edge of the cliff as it
ascended. A matter of fifty rods higher it leveled into the
ridge's summit. Denver grunted, "Go along, my boy, this is
another thing we just squeezed through," and looked behind him. A
small body of men were galloping in pursuit, sliding down the
trail he had shortly before taken. "How in the devil did I pass
through that mess of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The gelding faltered. Denver squared himself and found the
game lost. The top of the trail was blocked by waiting outlaws.
Distinctly he saw Dann's sullen, savage face glaring at him. In
such a place, with neither safe retreat nor safe advance
possible, Denver reverted to the elemental instincts that ruled
him. He raked the gelding cruelly, threw up his rifle and pumped
his remaining shells at them. Their horses pitched, a man
capsized&mdash;and that was all he ever saw of the scene. A
bullet struck the gelding; it stumbled, and Denver went vaulting
over the rim. He struck first on his shoulder and felt the cold
stream of pain shudder through his veins. Then, still conscious,
he went careening down the stiff slope, loose rock rattling
beside him. He heard one more shot. Then sound and light and
feeling departed altogether. He was at the bottom of the slope,
blood gouting from his head.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; STEVE</h2>

<p class="first">ABOUT a dozen of the Bucket punchers came riding
into Sundown during the middle of the morning, squired by
Nightingale himself and Steve Steers. Al Niland walked out of the
courthouse, lines of anxiety on his face.</p>

<p>"Well, heard anything yet?"</p>

<p>Steve shook his head. "We came by D Slash. There wasn't only a
few boys there. Denver ain't come back so far, nor any of the
bunch under him. Nobody's heard a thing."</p>

<p>"You know about Leverage?" queried Niland.</p>

<p>"Why, we met a fella on the road that told us somethin'. He
rammed into Redmain, as I got it, and didn't make out so well.
And took a little lead himself."</p>

<p>"Worse than that," interposed Niland. "He's halfway dead. Old
Jake thought he was sneakin' up on Redmain's wild ones when
Redmain smashed him just where Jake wasn't entertaining any
suspicions. The vigilantes buckled up for a minute, but Jake rode
right at Redmain's party, yelling for the rest to come along. He
took it plenty. May live and may not."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but that ain't what gets me so much. What in the name
o' Judas was the matter with these aforesaid vigilantes? Redmain
hit and run, didn't he? And they heard more firm' up above a
ways, didn't they? They mighta known it was Denver loopin' into
action. Why didn't they folla?"</p>

<p>"They stopped to pick up the pieces, I hear," said Niland.
"When they finally did follow there wasn't anything to be seen of
anybody except one D Slash fellow some cut up.</p>

<p>"Agh," snorted Steve disgustedly. "First time I lay eyes on
one of these vigilantes I'm going to tell him somethin' to make
his ears ring."</p>

<p>"Well, we ought to hear pretty soon," said Niland and jerked
his thumb at Grogan's. Steve looked to the Englishman
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Do as you please," said Nightingale. "I'll be over at the
Association meeting for a while. If by then we have no word about
Denver, we'll ride back to his ranch. And if there is still no
news, I wouldn't be surprised but what we took a little jog into
the country he disappeared through."</p>

<p>Steers and Niland watched him amble across the street. "He's
furrin," observed Steers, "but blamed if he ain't a human duck.
Been a-frettin' about this business all mornin'. I spend half my
time unroppin' him from the rope he essays to throw and the other
half tryin' to figure if his jokes is sad or funny. He actually
don't know enough about a cow to figure whether yuh carve out
beefsteak on the hoof and turn the critter loose again or what.
But he shore knows horses."</p>

<p>"How about that drink?" suggested Niland.</p>

<p>"You bet I will," agreed Steve, and turned around. In so doing
his eyes fell upon a feminine figure standing by the hotel porch.
Instantly something stabbed Steve Steers in the middle of the
back; or such was the impression Niland gathered from the look
that froze on the puncher's face. He swallowed hard, and mumbled.
"That is, no thanks. Got to see Debbie." And he trotted toward
the porch like a hound that had been whistled for. Niland sighed
and went into Grogan's alone.</p>

<p>Sundown quivered with tension. The news of Leverage's ill
fortune had reached town early, and shortly after a call went out
for a meeting of the Association. So now men rode in and walked
the streets uneasily; drifted together to exchange news. A man
had ridden down Prairie Street to scout the road. Earlier in the
morning a Leverage puncher had galloped in to summon Doc
Williamson, refusing to talk. And Doc had gone off with the man
hurriedly.</p>

<p>The practical defeat of the vigilantes shocked Sundown out of
its lazy calm. Lou Redmain ceased to be a minor factor in the
country; in one brief evening he had achieved notoriety, and when
the gathering men spoke of him it was with a lurking doubt mixed
with their profane anger. If he had whipped Leverage, if he had
so recruited the wild bunch that he could stand off an organized
force, who ruled Yellow Hill then? What was to prevent him from
instituting a guerrilla warfare from one isolated ranch to
another? The timid felt this immediately and began to fall
silent, lest the red mark of destruction be placed against them
and their habitations; and Sundown witnessed the drying up of
casual talk, the coming of an alien reserve. For always in a land
where the law goes to pieces the first rule is the rule of self-
preservation.</p>

<p>Al Niland was in Grogan's, brooding over this, turning other
matters as well darkly around his mind. Steele's death had made a
gap in the ranks of friendship that never would be filled. If
anything happened to Denver&mdash;Niland rejected the thought. He
simply could not tolerate the premise that disaster would ever
overtake Dave Denver. Other men might weaken or blunder, other
men might go crashing down to ruin and death. This was mortality.
But, logical as Niland was, he somehow could never bring himself
to accept Denver as ordinary. Denver always came crawling out
from the bottom of the wreckage, grinning cheerfully. In short,
Denver's career had created a legend of personal power that was
hard to shake off. Niland was analytical enough to realize this;
he knew also that nobody could look at Denver impartially. Men
either hated him or trusted and followed him with a kind of
fanatical zeal.</p>

<p>"Good God!" grunted Niland. "I'm conductin' a post mortem. All
I got to say is this'll be a sorry place if he's gone down the
chute. Which the Lord forbid!"</p>

<p>He turned from the bar and saw Steve Steers coming in. Steve
looked harried. Niland thought, "Debbie's pushed him just an inch
too far, and I'm sort of glad." Steve made straight for the bar
and slapped his palm resoundingly on the mahogany.</p>

<p>"Trot out the hog wash," he called. Grogan, who never liked
any such reference to his product, pushed bottle and glass toward
the puncher. "No law compellin' you to drink my liquor,
Steers."</p>

<p>Steve straightened. Honeyed softness caressed his words.
"Grogan, my lad, I have observed your lordly manner some
frequent, and I'm reminded of the horse that put on a shirt and
tried to eat off the parlor table. I pay for your booze, and I'm
entitled to pass judgment on it. If you got anything definite to
say to me, let's hear it."</p>

<p>Grogan stared, the rims of his eyes reddening. There was
cruelty in the man, plenty of it, and he never hesitated to cuff
a trouble maker out of his place. Yet he backed water in front of
Steve Steers. "Somebody must've stepped on yore foot, Mister
Steers."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, I feel like steppin' on somebody else's
foot. Al, you drinkin' with me? I despise drinkin' alone."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Niland. "But I thought you was temperamentally
opposed to liquor."</p>

<p>"Ha!" snorted Steve and took his jot without a quiver. "That's
the trouble with me. I ain't got a mind of my own any more. I
can't do nothin' without lookin' on the chart to see if it's
proper. Debbie issues orders. Her old lady tells me where to head
in. The old gent bites me off short. Even the eleven-year-old
mutt of a Lunt kid roots me on the shins. I'd like to haul off
four feet behind my breeches and spank him into next leap year.
But no. I'm just the swivel-eyed ape which hangs around the Lunt
house and gets pushed outa the road. Ha! Grogan, bring me a glass
that ain't half plugged up with scum. I want a drink."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I better leave you alone," reflected Niland.
"You'll foam any minute now."</p>

<p>"Hear anything new?" demanded Steers, drawing the bottle to
him.</p>

<p>"No. Don't even see any of the vigilantes in town."</p>

<p>Steers turned to face the room. "Vigilantes? Ain't that
somethin' to make yuh die laughin'? Hey, is there any of you
vigilantes in these premises? I'd shore like to see what great
big scrappin' hellions yuh are!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Without question he was on the warpath.
One of the Nightingale riders, seeing the foreman of the outfit
hell-bent for trouble, slipped quickly from the hall. Steers
raked the assembled citizens with a bright eye. "None present,
uh? Well, I reckon they must all be home in bed, nursin' their
busted arches. If I'd run as fast as they did to get away from
Lou Redmain I'd have busted arches, too. And what is more, I
wouldn't have nerve enough to come back to Sundown!"</p>

<p>Niland thoughtfully called Steve's attention to the empty
glass. "After a large statement like that you must be dry. There
was heat in the remarks. Presuming on the perquisites of
friendship I would suggest you have covered a scope of ground
somewhat wider than the spread of your elbows. Think it
over."</p>

<p>"Think? All I been doin' lately is thinkin'&mdash;about my
duty, about my responsibilities, about bein' a gentleman. What's
it brought me? Nothin' but grief. I wasn't made to think. I was
made to bust forth and do the first thing that came in my head.
What're all you dudes sittin' around for? Somebody run out and
see if they's news of Denver. You&mdash;over there. Git
goin'."</p>

<p>"Pretty soon you're going to need an armored battleship to get
out of this town whole," prophesied Niland.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Steve, dripping in sarcasm. "Ev'body's all
tuckered out from runnin'. Tie that, will yuh? Runnin' from Lou
Redmain, the kinky little belly-slashin' rat! Runnin' away from
him and leavin' a man in the lurch which none of 'em is good
enough to lick his shoes!"</p>

<p>Niland let out a small sigh of relief. Nightingale men were
slipping unobtrusively into the saloon. Steve had his bodyguard,
though he failed to realize it. He lowered his voice to
Niland.</p>

<p>"She said she'd turn me off like a crummy shirt if I ever got
drunk, Al. Yeah, Debbie said that. Now you just watch me. She's a
thousand times too good for a shif'less egg like me. I'm
unregenerate. She thinks she can straighten a crooked nail.
Dammit, I don't want to be improved. Just stay around and drink
now and then with me while I get drunk. Grogan, trot out another
bottle of that doctored dishwater."</p>

<p>"I've got no more time to drink, Steve. Something on tap."</p>

<p>"Any time's time to drink," said Steve, falling upon Cal
Steele's well remembered phrase. The two men stared at each other
as if the ghost of their friend stood lazy and smiling between
them. Steve's face was suddenly lined and heavy. "I know. You go
on. You're in no position to wallow in the mud with me. I'll get
somebody." He shoved himself away from the bar and concentrated
on the room. His finger stabbed out, and it may have been wholly
by accident that it fairly tagged two rather willing
characters&mdash;Meems and Wango. Possibly it was accident,
though the gentlemen in question seldom missed a free meal and
never had been known to refuse a drink.</p>

<p>"Come here!" bellowed Steers. "You two! Stand right beside me.
When I drink, you match me. See?"</p>

<p>"It ain't as hard as it sounds," said Buck Meems. "Mebbe you'd
better let us get evened up afore we start off."</p>

<p>Steers seemed to recognize them for the first time.
"Huh&mdash;the human sponges. Well it's all right. I'll know I'm
drunk when I see you road runners start wabblin'. Al&mdash;Al.
When you hear anything come right back and let me know."</p>

<p>Niland nodded, spoke quietly to one of the Nightingale
punchers, and walked out. What he said was, "Don't any of you
fellows cramp his style. He could just about lick the contents of
the saloon alone in his present state. Don't encourage him by
interfering."</p>

<p>Niland paused to scan the street for new arrivals and found
none. He crossed to Doc Williamson's office, but it was empty.
Lola Monterey came quickly from the New York grocery and wheeled
in front of him, whereat he lifted his hat and answered her
question before she asked it. "Not a word, Lola."</p>

<p>He saw her fists double up around a package. It made him offer
the old and well-worn assurance. "No news is good news. There
never was the hole Dave couldn't wiggle through."</p>

<p>"If you knew Lou Redmain as I do&mdash;" said she, and never
finished the sentence. He watched her walk away, and an odd flash
of thought came to him about the Biblical Mary and Martha. The
opera house doors were closed, and a puncher guarded them; on
impulse he used his right as an Association member and went in.
Fear Langdell slouched in a stage chair. A small rancher held the
floor, talking in a half-hearted sort of way.</p>

<p>"...I want you-all to realize we've got no militia to call on,
no rangers to drag in. Here we are, the biggest, roughest county
in the state, cut off from down country. We always have had to
fight our own battles, and we will now. Some of you smoke eaters
forget that these hills make perfect shelter for the wild bunch.
Just try and run 'em all down. If we'd gone about this with a
less heavy hand and a hell of a lot of less advertisement we
wouldn't of pushed the bad ones into a single herd where they can
do us the most damage. We are lookin' right square into no-law
country. Lou Redmain's got nothin' less than another Hole-in-the-
Wall bunch. And if you had lived in Wyoming like me you'd flinch
every time you thought about it. I figured Leverage would anyhow
keep things quiet by a show of force. But I had hopes Denver
would smash 'em once he made up his mind. There ain't anybody
else that could. If he's gone, I just don't know how I can face
the prospect of livin' on my place with the wife and kids. I just
don't..."</p>

<p>Niland left the hall in need of air. "So they're singin'
Dave's swan song. Well, they don't know the man!" But, going
along the courthouse corridor and back to his office he
remembered an odd thing Denver once had told him. It was about
how fast bad news swept over Yellow Hill County. Denver had
pointed to the sky and said, "It's one of those things I don't
try to explain. Call it the invisible telegraph, if you want. But
it comes through the air. I know it. I've felt it. The Indians
knew it too. The news of Custer's being wiped out traveled to
tribes three hundred miles south before a messenger could even
ride thirty miles. It's just another part of the mystery of this
country. Whispering Range&mdash;there never was a truer name.
Some days there's a pressure all around me that's like a
smotherin' blanket. I know better than to take chances on those
days. Somewhere there's an old medicine drum beating, and the
echo of it passes along."</p>

<p>Niland closed his office door, locked it, and threw the dark
reveries from his head with conscious effort. Impatiently he lit
his pipe, unlocked a drawer, and took therefrom a long leather
folder. Out of it he drew a broken sheet of paper, smoothed it on
the table, and bent his slim, rebellious face in scrutiny, as he
had done a dozen times in the last eight hours.</p>

<p>He had found it in an odd corner of Cal Steele's desk which he
had inspected after being appointed executor of the dead man's
estate. He would have set it aside as of no importance except
that in the back of his mind was the question Dave Denver had
planted there. He had been musing ever since over the figures
penned upon it. On the left margin apparently Steele had
indicated dates. In the center the figures obviously stood for
sums of money, and each one following its date. Niland had
concluded that these represented proceeds from cattle sales. But
what defied his logic was that to the right of each sum had been
set a figure 3 as a divisor, and still to the right of this
divisor was put down the exact third of the original sum. There
were a dozen such individual transactions over a period of about
a year.</p>

<p>Nothing in his subsequent searches quite satisfied him. There
were instruments of sale of stock between Steele and Fear
Langdell registered in the courthouse. Some of them closely
followed the dates on this sheet of paper. Others seemed not to.
Casual questioning had revealed no sale of cattle from Steele to
any other rancher in the district; but the cattleman had made
four moderate shipments to the Salt Lake yards during the year.
And that was all Niland had discovered.</p>

<p>Niland settled back and blew the smoke heavily across his
table. That figure 3 kept working through his head. Cal Steele
had no partners. He had no relatives in the country. Nothing in
his papers indicated kin or birthplace. Behind his arrival in
Yellow Hill were only silence and mystery; nor had Steele ever
broken it by spoken confidence. So then, why this three-part
division of money?</p>

<p>He put away his pipe with a quick gesture, placed the sheet of
paper in his pocket and rose. "Lord forgive me!" he muttered. "I
may be sorry for what I find." He went through the business of
unlocking and locking, passed to the street, and aimed for the
bank. A quick survey told him no news had arrived so far in
Sundown. And carrying his oppressive, foreboding fears with him,
he entered the bank and met Ed Storm, a blocky middle-aged man
who had inherited the institution from earlier members of the
family. Storm's assistant was also in the place. Niland nodded
briefly to the inner office and entered it. Storm came
afterward.</p>

<p>"You look," he observed, "like you were standing on the peak
of Ararat two days after the flood, with no grub in sight."</p>

<p>"Well, I feel like I'd been sent for and was only half
present. Ed, you know me pretty well, don't you? There ain't a
whole lot you don't fathom about me."</p>

<p>"This has all the earmarks of a touch," grinned Storm. "I've
seen you throw back five-inch trout and refuse to shoot a doe.
Nothing wrong with your moral integrity."</p>

<p>Niland failed to respond to the humor. He talked in jerky
phrases, seemingly far afield. "Ethics. We've all got our
professional ethics. They're fine things to start life with. Yet
I doubt if there's a professional man living who hasn't violated
his creed time and again. For admirable purposes, too. Man builds
up a pretty schedule of ideals&mdash;and life knocks it flatter
than a pancake. When I'm old and shot and look back down the
crooked trail I hacked out, I think I'll be kind of sad at the
fine thoughts I threw overboard. But I think I'll also hope to
hear somebody in the hereafter say, 'Well done, good and faithful
servant.'"</p>

<p>"Now that you're all wound up, toss the loop," said Ed
Storm.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask you some questions," went on Niland with a
rise of energy. "They're questions you could only properly answer
in court, but this is something that never will get to court. It
dies outside of sight. You understand, Ed? You know, too that I
have never blackmailed a man, never clubbed him down with any
information I've had against him."</p>

<p>"Fire away&mdash;and we'll see what we see, Al."</p>

<p>"All right. I'm not going to explain anything. If you get any
ideas on the subject from the way I bore in&mdash;that's under
your hat. First, did Lou Redmain ever have an account in this
bank?"</p>

<p>"That's easy. No."</p>

<p>"Did he ever cash any checks here&mdash;within the last
year?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Were any of those checks from Cal Steele?"</p>

<p>Storm arched his eyebrows. "No."</p>

<p>"From Fear Langdell?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>Niland paused, stared thoughtfully at the ceiling. "You've
cleared checks through the bank from Langdell to Steele for sale
of beef. I know that. But have you cleared any checks from Steele
to Langdell?"</p>

<p>"No-o," said Storm with a slight drag in the answer. Niland
studied the banker. Unconsciously he was exercising his habit as
an attorney of reading the qualifications and reservations behind
witnesses' answers.</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;was Cal Steele in the habit of drawing out large
sums of money at a time?"</p>

<p>"Cash&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Niland plunged into the opening swiftly.</p>

<p>"Right after receiving these checks from Langdell?"</p>

<p>Storm stopped to think. "Not necessarily on the same day or
week. But he was a hand to draw heavy whenever his balance got
substantially large. My one observation is that on the occasions
when he drew considerable cash he'd take a trip south to the
capital."</p>

<p>Niland's thoughts went off on this tangent. He was aware that
Cal Steele often went away for a few days. On the heels of this
reflection he tried to place Langdell's whereabouts at those
times and found himself doubtful.</p>

<p>"Does Langdell have a bank account at the capital, Ed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. That'd be necessary for him, considering all the
investments he's got scattered around."</p>

<p>"Well, after Steele made his trips to the capital, did you
ever observe Langdell switching money from the bank there to your
bank?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't answer that without looking into the records," said
Storm. He leaned forward in his chair, watching Niland. The
lawyer decided to test the meaning of Storm's attention.</p>

<p>"Anything you'd care to say to me, Ed, that might bear on the
subject?"</p>

<p>But Storm shook his head. "I'm just giving you straight yes or
no answers, Al."</p>

<p>Niland leaned back. "I'd give a great deal to see the written
record of Fear Langdell's check account durin' the last six
months. And it's criminal as hell to suggest it."</p>

<p>Storm rose without a word and left the room. A few minutes
later he came back with a sheaf of papers in his hand. He placed
them casually on his desk. "No, Al, I couldn't hand you
Langdell's records. That would open me up to all sorts of grief.
I'd never want to be placed on the witness stand and have to
confess that I verbally gave you any such dope. By the way, I've
got to go out front for about ten minutes. Just make yourself at
home, Al. I won't be back for ten minutes."</p>

<p>The two men swapped glances. Storm went out and closed the
door. Niland leaned forward. Those papers Storm had left on the
desk, he saw, were the ledger sheets and transit check records
concerning Langdell's account. He drew the crumpled slip from his
pocket. Occasionally his pencil touched and checked a figure; but
when, an exact ten minutes later, Storm returned, he found Niland
slouched idly in the chair. "Sorry I had to run out on you.
Anything else you want to know?"</p>

<p>"No," said Niland.</p>

<p>"Whatever has passed between us is confidential."</p>

<p>"I'd like the privilege of tellin' one man, Ed."</p>

<p>"Hell!" grunted Storm, frowning. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Denver," replied Niland, and added, "if he's alive."</p>

<p>"I trust you&mdash;I trust him. Now I'm going to wash my face
and hands."</p>

<p>"I've tried it at times," reflected Niland, getting up. "But
what's the use? Nobody can live a useful life without gettin'
dirty. What do you expect of Sundown? See you later, Ed."</p>

<p>On the street he found the scene changed somewhat. A great
many men were standing just outside Grogan's. Nobody was going in
and nobody coming out, but those by the doors seemed intently
interested at the sounds emerging. Thinking that Steve Steers had
developed a fight, he elbowed through the crowd and entered.
Steve was lecturing the room morosely.</p>

<p>"When I tell you buzzards to play cards, then yuh can do it,
and not a minute before. This always was a lousy joint, full of
petty ante grafters and run by a sticky-fingered mug who's got a
spine made o' yella soap. Meems, quit crawlin' against the
bar."</p>

<p>Niland came forward, and Steve stopped talking. Both of his
elbows were hooked against the bar; he swayed like a tree in a
heavy wind. The alcoholic stupor blurred his vision; he failed to
recognize Niland until the latter approached to arm's length.
Then Steve stiffened&mdash;and remembered.</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I had ought to of gone along," muttered Steve. "Ruther be
dead than wait like this. Have a drink, Al."</p>

<p>Niland shook his head. "How drunk do you have to be, Steve?
You're about paralyzed now."</p>

<p>"It ain't enough," sighed Steve. "Grogan, this bug-killer of
yores is either rotten poison or else yore miserable mug is
double. Always did know yuh to be two-faced."</p>

<p>Grogan leaned against the bottle shelf, breathing hard. One
palm lay against a blackjack on the shelf. "I had about enough
from you, Steers. My face is good enough for you, and my liquor
is straight."</p>

<p>"Both of which is neither," jeered Steve. "Layin' for me,
ain't yuh? Try it and I'll break yore back, you ox."</p>

<p>Meems and Wango went off in a sputtering argument. All
Grogan's free lunch platters were on the bar in front of them,
fearsomely raped. The litter of chicken bones and half bitten
sandwiches strewed the floor at their feet.</p>

<p>"Don't yuh eat nothin' but white meat?" demanded Wango. "I
been nibblin' on wings and necks till I c'd crow an' fly away.
Gimme a chanst."</p>

<p>"Thasso? Ev'time I reach I run into yore cussed arm. Git yore
fool head outa the platter. It ain't no bed."</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' yuh once an' all&mdash;quit throwin' yore bones
anunder my feet!"</p>

<p>"I alius&mdash;uck&mdash;throw scraps to the dawg, Wango."</p>

<p>"Don't throw no more bones anunder my feet!"</p>

<p>"He calls 'em feet!" cackled Meems.</p>

<p>Steve reached for the bottle. "Hit this, you sod busters.
Ain't there nothin' that'll stop yuh but arsenic?"</p>

<p>Meems shook with palsy as he drank. Wango paled and began to
shudder enormously. Both of his feet were inside the brass rail;
attempting to maneuver around, he began to wilt. His feet slid,
his knees buckled, his hind quarters struck the rail, bounced,
and settled to the floor. Meems, bereft of moral support, laid
his head on the bar. "I reckon&mdash;I done got ample," he
moaned. "My Gawd, what a night!"</p>

<p>Steve stared at the partners. "They never was no good and
never will be. But if they look like I think they look, then I
shore must be hog drunk." With a jerk of his arm he swallowed
what remained in his glass. "Now I got to take my punishment.
Stay here, Al, till I come back."</p>

<p>He batted the doors before him, glowered at the crowd, passed
through. Toward the hotel he rolled. There was sweat on his face
and a film over his eyes. Once he thought he would never make it
and slouched against a hitching rack; but a horse backed away
from him, and that roused sufficient anger to propel him to the
hotel porch. He couldn't see Debbie and he knew he never would be
able to master the stairs. So he dropped his anchor and
called.</p>

<p>"Debbie&mdash;oh, Debbie."</p>

<p>Then she was standing above him, silent and still. She held
her chin steady, but in a sudden passion of self-disgust he saw
that he had hurt her as no other soul had ever done. The deep
blue of her eyes was covered by a cloud. He had shamed her,
soiled her by coming out in the street and calling her name. The
damage was done, and for the rest of his life he would regret it.
Even so, he clung to his purpose.</p>

<p>"Debbie," said he, "I'm drunk."</p>

<p>Something else appeared in her eyes. She spoke softly and not
with the tart impatience to which he was accustomed. "I see that,
Steve. Maybe we have waited too long. On the first of the month
we'll be married. And you'll never drink again."</p>

<p>"What's that? Debbie&mdash;but, Debbie, yuh said&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was gone. Steve turned and plowed back to the saloon, on
through the crowd, on across the hall to the bar. And in front of
Al Niland he exploded.</p>

<p>"My God, Al, why don't wimmen make up their minds and stick to
it? Here I went and spent thirty dollars to get this
way&mdash;and it went for nothin'! Wimmen&mdash;why&mdash;!"</p>

<p>A running, rising murmur swept the saloon.</p>

<p>"Here's somebody! Clear that door&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Doc&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Denver&mdash;"</p>

<p>That last name was repeated again with a dying inflection. The
talk fell off. Steve turned slowly. The first face he saw was
that of Al Niland, set and pallid. Then he discovered a figure
framed in the doors, a tall, spare figure. Doc Williamson. Doc
passed a hand across his forehead and broke the hush.</p>

<p>"I guess you boys had better know it. Dave Denver is
dead."</p>

<p>All men are touched with queerness. Steve Steers pivoted on
his heels and faced Grogan behind the bar. He called Grogan a
name, a name than which there can be none worse when spoken as
Steve spoke it. Grogan leaped for his blackjack. Steve smashed
the man's head with a whisky bottle and flung the broken neck
after Grogan's sinking bulk. He saw nothing but red streaks of
fire, and it was an act of Providence that guided him through the
door. Fifteen minutes later one of the Nightingale men found him
stretched on the ground back of the Palace, stone sober. Crying
like a child.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; WHEN THE DARK GODS
CALL</h2>

<p class="first">A LONG gray column slid sinuously through the
green thicket and shot across the Sundown-Ysabel Junction road.
The last man in the column dismounted, erased the hoofmarks in
the dust with his coat, and caught up with the procession. Then
the column vanished through the ranking trees of the high ridge
near Starlight Canyon. Some minutes later it reached a commanding
summit, halted, and took rest. Lou Redmain rode off by himself to
where the road, the lower end of Sundown Valley, and the Leverage
home meadows were spread out before him. He tipped back his hat,
fingers tapering down a cigarette. Having lighted it and swung
one knee over the saddlehorn, he began a slow survey of the
country from north to south.</p>

<p>For all his apparent ease of posture, there was a wariness
about him, an animal restlessness. His clothes were streaked with
dirt; a dark stubble of beard ran from temple to jaw. Normally
Lou Redmain was almost like a woman in neatness and choice of
clothes. Now, unkempt and sullen for lack of sleep, his features
betrayed him. The willfulness, the faithlessness, the unbridled
appetites&mdash;these faults any man could see at a glance.
Redmain had never been anything else, nor anything better than he
was now.</p>

<p>Yet he had changed. Through the years he had been denied a
full fellowship with the range people. Hating these people
because of that, and hating himself because he understood better
than any living soul the rotten streaks in him, he had lived in
solitary rebellion, cursing a society he could not enter and
could not destroy. He had drifted to the Wells, despising the
brutally degraded human beings he necessarily was forced to call
his friends. The Wells became his town, the outlaws in it his
henchmen. So inevitably the passions guiding Lou Redmain led him
step by step into organized thievery. Now he stood on the summit
of the ridge, inflamed with the knowledge he had met the best
force society could launch against him and tricked it to defeat;
hardened and made desperately dangerous by knowing that in the
black night just gone he had forfeited every right to mercy and
publicly branded himself with the one brand no human being can
ever erase&mdash;murder.</p>

<p>His gaze traveled as far as the mouth of Starlight. A rider
emerged from Starlight, turning west; whoever it was, he went
slowly and seemed to sway in the saddle. Redmain whipped a pair
of glasses from his coat and bent them on the road for a long
interval. Perceptibly the corners of his mouth tightened. Then
obeying a cagy impulse, he ran the glasses along the trees
fringing Starlight's mouth and on ahead of the rider to where
dark angles of the hill country abutted upon the road. He
replaced the glasses, and went down to the resting men.</p>

<p>"Up and ride," said he, and spurred ahead without waiting. He
threaded the pines, swung to avoid an open meadow, and fell upon
a narrow trail. His men strung out, murmuring. He turned and
spoke with stinging calm. "Choke off that noise and quit
straggling."</p>

<p>Dann drew nearer. "Stage comin'?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," grunted Redmain. He departed from the trail so
unexpectedly that Dann shot past him and had to swing back. Some
hundred yards down a rocky glen Redmain paused and motioned the
party to collect. In front lay a screen of trees; just beyond was
the road. He had judged his distance well, for the sound of the
rider came around a point of rocks. Redmain tightened his grip on
the reins, motioned his men to stand fast, and suddenly shot out
of the pines. Eve Leverage, traveling slowly and slackly, saw
him. She roused herself to defensive action. The horse sprang
forward, her quirt flashed down. Redmain laughed, ran beside her,
and got a grip on her pony's bridle cheek piece. Never uttering a
sound, she slashed him desperately across the face with the
quirt, leaving her mark definitely on him before he jerked it out
of her hands. A queer, glittering grin stamped his features.</p>

<p>"Like to cut me, don't you? Words or quirt, it's all the same
to you."</p>

<p>"If I had a gun I'd kill you!"</p>

<p>"Considerin' the condition of the country," was his even
rejoinder, "you ought to carry one."</p>

<p>She was dead white. She had been crying. Her eyes were
blurred, her fists clenched, and she seemed to be fighting for
breath.</p>

<p>"You creeping, savage beast! Get away from me&mdash;I don't
want to touch you!"</p>

<p>"The good, nice people of Yellow Hill," said Redmain, coldly
bitter, "have taught you the proper lessons, I see."</p>

<p>"Keep your tongue off folks you're not fit to cringe in front
of! I pray God will strike you dead!"</p>

<p>"When your men folk go out to kill it's right and proper. When
I use my gun in self-protection I'm nothin' more to you than a
savage. Think straight. When the pack is out to destroy it's just
as crazy and inhuman as anything on earth. I'm fightin' to live
as I want to live! To be let alone&mdash;to keep from bein' broke
in the damned treadmill! What's wrong with that? I'm a man, and
I'm darin' to do what a lot of other men would like to do but
ain't got the courage! Because I don't want to follow the pack
and think as it thinks&mdash;because of that the pack outlaws me.
Makes me a target! I'm an animal&mdash;but they don't even give
me the benefit of a closed season like they would other animals.
No, I've got to be destroyed. And you condemn me for wantin' to
live!"</p>

<p>"I believe nothing you say!" cried Eve. "You slink in the
dark, stealing what belongs to other people! You shot my father,
never remembering that years ago he defended you and gave you
another chance after you had stolen some of his cows! And you
have killed a man who broke with all the ranchers in this country
because he wanted you to have every chance a human being could
have! A man who publicly said he believed in you&mdash;long after
you had lost the right to be believed! Stay away from
me&mdash;you're&mdash;you're unclean!"</p>

<p>He was still. But the words ripped him apart, destroyed the
sham glory he had built around his bloody acts. Fury leaped in
his eyes. "I thought you'd be comin' from Denver's. Been up there
to grieve over the hero of the hills, uh? He will never wear a
tin crown again!"</p>

<p>She lowered her head, turned it away from him. Redmain laughed
harshly at the agony he saw.</p>

<p>"Thought you was mighty kind in giving me your pity that day
in Sundown. I'll show you what I think of pity."</p>

<p>He wrapped her reins in his free arm. She struggled for them,
but Redmain slapped her hands away. "Stay still&mdash;or I'll
make you wish you never'd been born."</p>

<p>She slumped in the saddle. "Nothing can hurt me more than I've
been hurt," said she dully.</p>

<p>"Pretty talk," jeered Redmain and started west on the road. A
gesture of his arm brought the rest of the party from the trees.
Gathering speed, Redmain followed the road for a quarter mile and
then swept into the trees once more, this time on the south side.
Twenty minutes through the forest he paused and rode alone to a
break in the greenery. Leverage's ranch quarters drowsed in the
sunshine, here and there a puncher idling at chores. Redmain
beckoned the party to him and led it along a
circle&mdash;approaching the ranch from another quarter and
closing quietly in. Redmain took Eve's reins and muttered at the
waiting riders.</p>

<p>"No shooting unless it's necessary. Circle the house. Get all
hands out in the yard and strip 'em. Dann, you're in charge of
that. I'll be going inside. Torper, you watch the road for
anything coming this way. Let's go."</p>

<p>He shot into the clearing and bore down on the main house with
Eve beside him. A Leverage hand discovered the raid and yelled at
the top of his lungs. "Redmain!" Men sprang from all directions.
Dann boomed stridently.</p>

<p>"Cut that out or yuh'll shoot the girl! Pitch up, you galoots,
and do it quick!"</p>

<p>Redmain was sure enough of his strength to ride straight to
the porch, jump down, and haul Eve from her saddle. Mrs. Leverage
appeared in the doorway and screamed. She ran for her daughter,
striking at Redmain. The outlaw laughed and let the girl go. "Oh,
she's not hurt, woman. Where's Leverage?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Leverage backed away, spreading her arms across the door.
"Stay out of here! You've done enough harm!"</p>

<p>He pushed her aside. Knowing the arrangement of the house very
well, he went directly to Leverage's bedroom. The rancher lay
between the sheets, body battened up with pillows. When he saw
Redmain he turned his head very slightly, and his lids narrowed.
Mrs. Leverage ran over and put herself by the bed.</p>

<p>Redmain had a thin grin. "Got curious, Jake. Wanted to see
what I'd done to you. Next time you'll probably know enough to
mind yore own business. In the first place, you're too old to
take chances. Also, you ain't quite bright enough to get me. I've
known every move you made for two weeks."</p>

<p>"You wet-faced little rat!" snapped Mrs. Leverage. "Let Jake
alone! Get out of here and go away. I always did know you were
treacherous, but I thought you drew the line somewheres. What did
you come here for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"To let the Leverage family know I ride when and where I
please," droned Redmain. "Nothing's going to stop me."</p>

<p>"Well, you've made your brag. Now clear out."</p>

<p>"You don't get off that easy," said Redmain, showing his
vicious pleasure. "Jake was big-hearted enough to take the lead
in wipin' me out. Now I'm going to set an example for Yellow Hill
and show folks just what happens to men that try to hurt me."</p>

<p>He turned back to the porch. His men had collected the
Leverage hands and herded them against the corral bars. Dann came
out of the bunkhouse with an armful of plunder. Redmain stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Dann, drop that junk. I want everything moved from the
bunkhouse and piled in the yard. Pull all the machinery and
wagons out of the sheds. Get it together. Start a fire under it,
burn it to cinders. Toss on anything you see layin' about that's
worth a cent."</p>

<p>He paused and cocked his head aside, as if expecting to hear
the Leverage women ask for mercy; but silence held the house.
Dann grinned. "How about the furniture in the big house? How
about burnin' the whole shebang down? That's what they did to the
Wells."</p>

<p>Redmain shook his head. "Do what I told you, and make it
fast." He returned to the bedroom. "Guess you ain't so far gone,
Jake, but what you heard that. A little lesson in manners. It is
costin' you a nice sum to buck me."</p>

<p>Still nobody answered him. He broke out wrathfully. "And I
mean that lesson to circulate around! By Judas, I want it
understood from now on I'm to be let alone! I'm stronger than the
law in Yellow Hill! From now on I am the law in this county, and
I'll ride out in broad sight without hindrance. You will all
listen to me and like it!"</p>

<p>The crackle of flames sounded down the hall. Leverage's white
lips twitched. Mrs. Leverage leaned down and touched him. "Don't
you care, Jake," she murmured. But Eve ran out to the porch
swiftly to see. Redmain followed her and pointed to the fire
licking through the heaped-up possessions.</p>

<p>"That," he said, grinding the words together, "is what pity
does. Once I thought I'd risk anything and do anything for you. I
know better. I don't want you. If I did I'd drag you along. I'd
make you like the women at the Wells. Why should I bother? You're
no better than they are. I'll stick to the women at the Wells. At
least they're honest about it."</p>

<p>He strode from the porch, stepped into the saddle and motioned
his men to do likewise. When they had assembled he turned and
lifted his hat to Eve sardonically. "One more item. I won't even
give you the satisfaction of thinkin' I had to kill Denver
myself. I didn't. He didn't mean that much to me. I told Dann to
do it."</p>

<p>Eve swayed back from the door and put up her hand to a rifle
hanging inside. The outlaws had all turned out, and Dann's broad
back was the target on which she leveled her gun. She closed her
eyes, pulled the trigger, and flung the rifle defiantly to the
floor. Dann's horse swirled and bucked. On the instant the whole
party spread wide, guns raised. Lou Redmain charged his pony at
Dann just as the latter was lifting his revolver on Eve. He
knocked Dann aside, the gun exploded, and the shell ripped
through the porch wall. In another slashing arm sweep Redmain
forced his lieutenant's weapon down. "Get out of here&mdash;I'll
attend to this!"</p>

<p>"Let him shoot me!" cried Eve desperately. "Why stop at that
when you've done everything else?"</p>

<p>Redmain laughed. "Now I'll show you what will happen to the
Leverage crew if any of them ever fire on my outfit again!" He
spoke softly over his shoulder. A burst of shots crashed out. Eve
turned her head away. Then the renegades were racing off, leaving
Leverage's saddle stock slaughtered in the yard.</p>

<p>A half hour later Redmain, deep in the Copperhead country,
halted and gave his horses a chance to blow. A part of the bunch
threw themselves down as soon as they lighted. Redmain, cagy and
aloof, went on to an isolated point and kept his seat. Presently
a newcomer emerged from the west and rode along to Red-main's
covert.</p>

<p>"Well?" challenged Redmain.</p>

<p>"Not much doubt about it. If he wasn't killed outright in
Tom's Hole, then he died after they lugged him home. I crawled on
my stummick till I had sight of the whole D Slash premises. They
buried him just a little bit ago. I saw the coffin go down and
the earth cover it up."</p>

<p>Redmain nodded and called out to Dann. "Come on." So the
cavalcade strung after him, this time posting north through the
rugged defiles bordering the river, verging toward Sundown.
Redmain's glance began to reach ahead more impatiently. And
abruptly he lifted an arm by way of signal. The column halted. An
inconspicuous little man with swarthy features had been standing
athwart the trail in an attitude of long waiting. He came up
promptly.</p>

<p>"I was about to conclude," said he, "you wasn't goin' to make
it."</p>

<p>"I do what I say I'll do," jerked out Redmain morosely. "Sing
your piece."</p>

<p>"I was told to tell yuh," recited the little man tonelessly,
"that the Association busted up without no decision. The
vigilantes idee ain't goin' to be carried on. Nobody wants the
job of runnin' it. The little fellers won't join in. So the big
fellers have decided to organize their own ridin' committees to
cover their own ranges&mdash;nothin' more'n that."</p>

<p>Malicious satisfaction dawned on Redmain's face. "So I split
'em up. Just what I wanted to do. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"I was told to tell yuh to use yore judgment fer a few
days."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'm in the habit of doin' that pretty well,"
remarked Redmain dryly and somewhat irritably.</p>

<p>The swarthy messenger cast a sidewise glance at Dann. "Steers
has published his intention of goin' after yuh, Dann. He stood in
Grogan's and called you a number of names. He challenged yuh to
meet him anywhere, any time."</p>

<p>"Small potatoes," jeered Dann. "He figgers he's safe in
cussin' a man that ain't able to come out in the daylight and
meet him. And say, how does he know I kicked Denver over? That's
what I want to know."</p>

<p>"It's the dope around Sundown," added the messenger.</p>

<p>"News seems to get published awful sudden," grunted Dann. "To
hell with Steers. I ain't worried about him."</p>

<p>Redmain's silence began to be oppressive. He had his eyes
fixed calculatingly on Dann. Presently he spoke up. "That's an
idea. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not what?" Dann wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Go get him."</p>

<p>Dann turned defiant. "Yore runnin' this outfit, ain't yuh? Why
don't yuh do yore own shootin' once in a while? Have I got to do
all of it?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of Steers?" asked Redmain softly.</p>

<p>Dann jumped at the bait. "You know better'n that, Lou! I'm
afraid of nobody that walks!"</p>

<p>"Considerable territory," observed Redmain in the same cool
and cutting manner. "For instance, you sound like you might be
includin' me. Which of course you don't mean, do you, Dann?"</p>

<p>Dann held Redmain's eyes until his own turned bloodshot. The
messenger shifted uneasily. Redmain smiled with his lips. "You
didn't include me, did you, Dann?"</p>

<p>Dann shifted. "Let it go," he grunted and found an excuse to
look at his feet. "If yuh really want me to go get
Steers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. Go after him. Choose your time and your ground. But get
him. I want Yellow Hill to understand that I hear all these
challenges and that I call all bluffs. I mean to make it so this
county won't dare speak about me above a whisper. Go get
him."</p>

<p>He turned to the swarthy messenger and studied him in cool
detachment. The latter felt himself being dismissed and without
another word rode off. Redmain waited for a few moments and took
up his talk again with Dann.</p>

<p>"There's more to it. You'll create a sort of side show while
I'm up in the hills plannin' somethin' else. There's one more big
play comin' up. One more smash this country's goin' to suffer
from me. They tried to lick me&mdash;and couldn't. Now they
figger to let me alone. And they can't do that either. They went
too far. I remember every slight, every insult. I got all that
down on the books, and I intend to pay off. What did they do to
the Wells? Destroyed it! All right. I am going to destroy
Sundown, Dann! And then ride out of the country!"</p>

<p>"When?" was Dann's swift question.</p>

<p>"Never mind. You'll know soon enough. Get on your horse and
pull out. You've got the next three-four days to find Steers and
maneuver him into position. I'll be up in the country above
Sundown&mdash;out of sight and out of mind."</p>

<p>Dann turned back, got his horse, and rode west into the
timber. Redmain watched him go, a flare of cruelty on the
triangular face. He had told Dann two reasons for going after
Steers; but he had not told Dann the third reason. In short, he
wanted Dann to be shot down. The big man was becoming too
dangerous, too boastful, too much of a malcontent. He might
infect the others, he might turn treacherous. Steers, of course,
was not as good a shot as Dann, but once the big outlaw was sent
off alone he was apt to get foolish and betray himself&mdash;and
be trapped. In any event, Redmain meant the man should never
return to the party. If he did return he would never so much as
get off his horse. Thus definitely did Redmain erase Stinger Dann
from his plans. He signaled to the outfit and led away. The
column vanished through the green thicket.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; WHEN A MAN
THINKS</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a dead man, Dave Denver exhibited singular
symptoms. He lay on his bed at D Slash, a row of pillows propped
to either side. His head was encased in an enormous ball of
bandages that ran from crown to chest and exposed only a bruised
nose, a cut mouth, and a pair of rebellious eyes. One of his arms
was splinted all the way down, and nothing showed but the tips of
his fingers; and at present he twiddled them one at a time,
meanwhile muttering something about Sweet Adeline in a cracked
voice. This was an innovation; he hadn't tried it during the
preceding two days, but a man flat on his back will try anything
once. Sometimes the results are gratifying. In this instance it
brought Lyle Bonnet into the room on a dead run.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Dave?"</p>

<p>Denver didn't turn his head. He couldn't turn his head. But he
broke off singing. "Nothing! Why all the lather?"</p>

<p>"Great guns!" snorted Bonnet. "I heard yuh a-groanin' and a-
sobbin' and I thought yuh had a spasm."</p>

<p>"I was singing. No law against it."</p>

<p>"No-o," reflected Bonnet. "That is, not for actual bona-fide
singin'. Was I you, I believe I'd whistle instead."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," muttered Dave fretfully. "I just wanted to
see if my chest was in order. I guess it is. See them fingers? I
can move 'em. Nothin' busted down there. Wish Doc would come. I
want to get the verdict on this left arm. I wish I could get up
and move my legs."</p>

<p>"No, cut that out. Ain't I had grief enough without arguin'
with yuh? You got yore orders."</p>

<p>"Huh, I got no more say-so around this dump than a dish
washer," opined Denver. "Lyle, ever reflect on the wonders of
nature? No? Well, you ought. Improve your education. I have. See
that fly on the bedpost? That's Oscar. I reckon you've always
held the common misguided opinion that flies are hostile insects,
ain't you? Dead wrong, Lyle. Oscar loves me. If he's kissed me
once he's kissed me fifty times. And I suppose you hold that
flies are unclean animals? Ain't right. Oscar washes ever'
fifteen minutes. How do I know? Well, he takes a seat on my nose
to do his laundry. Regular ceremony about it. First he lifts his
left laig and bats himself on the nose. Then he makes a swipe at
his ears with the other laig&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Flies ain't got ears," remarked Bonnet glumly.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you folks was all haywire about flies? Biggest
ears you ever saw. When he sleeps he covers his eyes with 'em. He
turns himself around like a dog. On my nose, see? Two-three
times. Then he squats and drops anchor. After which he lops his
ears down. He's got a lullaby song, too. Kinda pretty in a flyish
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quit movin' yore head."</p>

<p>Denver groaned. "Some day I'm just naturally goin' to tie the
can to you, Lyle."</p>

<p>"I wish to Gawd yuh would," muttered Bonnet. "If I take much
more punishment I'll go batty. Ever since we pulled that fake
burial day before yesterday your friends have been droppin' in to
give me fits. Seems like everybody wanted to see yuh
dead&mdash;well, I mean they sorter wanted to say so-long before
we covered the coffin. I been told I had ought to of laid you out
like Exhibit A. I been told I should 'a' took you to Sundown's
cemetery. Steve Steers was so hog-wild when he come that I
figgered he was agoin' to shoot. It's a good thing I got Doc to
back me up, or I'd be accused of buryin' yuh alive."</p>

<p>"What's Doc tell 'em?"</p>

<p>"Tells 'em that if folks can't keep fresh beef from spoilin'
in this weather what do they expect of a defunct human
being?"</p>

<p>"A good answer," mused Denver, "but not nice."</p>

<p>"And here's another item," went on Bonnet. "I may be a hard
nut, but I can't stand by and listen to any more women
cryin'&mdash;like Eve did. Dave, I tell you I almost broke down
and told her the truth."</p>

<p>Denver raised his good arm. "I know&mdash;I know. I was just
as bad off, lyin' here and hearin' her out there. That's
something I'm going' to carry on my conscience a long time. I
don't know if she ever will forgive me when she finds out. Maybe
I didn't have any business keepin' her out of the secret. It was
cold blooded. But it seemed to me then&mdash;and it does
now&mdash;that there is no way of getting Lou Redmain in a trap
without throwin' him off completely. If he knows he's put
Leverage out of the way and me out of the way he'll be apt to
take longer chances. That's just what I want. And he won't be
spyin' around D Slash to see what I'm up to. I had to make the
idea of my being dead sound truthful. Redmain's no man's fool.
Supposin' he had run into Eve right afterward. Or supposin' he's
got spies around the Leverage place, as he probably has. If she
seems unconcerned about me he'll get suspicious right away. No, I
had to take the hard way, and may the Lord forgive me for doin'
it."</p>

<p>"You going to tell Steve?"</p>

<p>"Not today or tomorrow. If he's gone hog-wild, then that's the
best advertisement of my kickin' the bucket I could want. I'm not
worryin' over him. He can stand the gaff."</p>

<p>"How about Lola Monterey?"</p>

<p>There was so long a silence that Bonnet figured Denver hadn't
heard. Denver was staring blackly at the ceiling. After a while
he spoke, never answering the question&mdash;and Bonnet knew he
was not to mention the girl's name again. "Do you think we fooled
Hominy Hogg and the Steele bunch?"</p>

<p>"I'd say so," said Bonnet. "You got to figure that when all
those shots turned our attention toward Tom's Hole and we found
yuh lyin' in that mess of rocks, you was in no pretty shape. Of
course, yuh talked, but it wasn't no great shakes. So when we got
here and put yuh in the bedroom I think the Steele bunch
considered it a toss-up. Anyhow, when I walked out on the porch
and said yuh was gone, they rode home with a good imitation of
bein' sunk."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," revealed Denver, "I got the idea of
playing dead the minute I shook the fog out of my head and found
I was still kickin'. I wasn't hurt as much as I gave indications
of bein' in front of the bunch. I trust almost all of the Steele
bunch, but there's a chance some one of them might be playing
double. So I thought it best to carry out the idea. Therefore
there's nobody but my own crew who knows I'm alive. And we'll
keep it that way until I get wind of Redmain and have a chance of
running him down. Did you do what I told you?"</p>

<p>"About the men? Yeah. I explained the situation. Chester Mack,
Limerick Lane, and Gallup decided to play the part of havin' quit
the ranch. They're to hit Sundown and indicate the ranch is
breakin' up. Mack's to stay in town and keep his ears wide open.
I told Limerick to ride around the hills like he was lookin' for
work. Gallup is to get himself a pack horse and strike out on a
prospectin' trip&mdash;keepin' to the upper Copperhead. So that
covers that. What next?"</p>

<p>"You can't hang around the ranch too much, Lyle. There might
be renegades spyin' on us."</p>

<p>Bonnet frowned. "There is&mdash;or was. Lee was pokin' around
the east trees a little while ago and found where a fellow had
beaten down the grass and brush. Apparently watchin' the house.
Considerin' yore helpless I wasn't going to say anything about
it."</p>

<p>Denver thought about this for a period. "Redmain may be
nearby. Only one way to be sure. You start out in the morning as
if to round up the stock. Beat the country pretty well. Better
yet&mdash;send out some men tonight with cold grub. Put 'em where
they'll cover the trails. Same system we tried before. It worked
then, and it'll work now."</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh. Get out of here. Oscar's losin' his patience. Can't you
see him fiddlin' around?" But Bonnet had hardly departed when Doc
Williamson arrived. He cast a professional glance at Denver.
"Suppose you've been threshin' around the bed and cussin'
everybody. Your kind always does."</p>

<p>"If I ever get out of here I'll never look at that ceilin'
again. Going to paint it full of faces, so I can talk to 'em. Put
your face in the middle and give you the devil. Meet Oscar."</p>

<p>"Crazy as a loon," remarked Doc Williamson and threw back the
covers. "Now if this don't hurt, tell me. Otherwise keep
still."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing you've got Pete Atkins to take care of up
here, too," reflected Denver, "or I don't know how you'd manage
to keep up the story of me bein' dead. Yeah, that's my foot, all
right. No doubt about it."</p>

<p>"Think you're wise?" countered Williamson. "Givin' grief to a
lot of good people&mdash;and some in particular?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll pay for it later. It's a hard game, Doc, but
I've got to play it out."</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to play it out," agreed the Doc, "or this
county will be worse than when the Indians skulked through it.
Now, I'm going to get a little rough."</p>

<p>"What do you call what you been doin' so far?" Denver wanted
to know. He closed his eyes while Williamson lifted one foot and
another, turning the ankles, bending the knees, all the while his
sharp eyes probing Denver's face for pain. In ten minutes or so
he had worked up as far as the splinted arm; taking off the
bandages he continued his search, fingers gently insistent. Then
he was done; and he leaned back, eyes lighting. "Well, after
bouncing off every rock in Tom's Hole I still can't find any
bones busted. What'd you want a doctor for? Legs are sound, ribs
seem satisfactory, that arm's got a few pulled tendons, but
nothing more."</p>

<p>Denver considered he did very well in suppressing his wild
emotion of pleasure. "How about my head?"</p>

<p>"You got a gash in it big enough to drive a span of mules
through, right over the left ear. I washed so much grit out of it
the other day I thought I was prospectin'. What difference does
it make? Nobody in Yellow Hill uses a head often enough to count,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"So I can get up, uh?"</p>

<p>"Who said so?" grunted Doc, juggling some vile-looking pills
into a glass of water.</p>

<p>"Well, if I'm not hurt&mdash;"</p>

<p>Williamson clucked his tongue in disgust. "Listen, Dave, if
you were a horse I'd shoot you for bein' absolutely no good for
further service. But since you're a Denver&mdash;the blackest and
toughest breed of mortal fools I ever knew&mdash;I'll say you
stick on your back for a week. Then you can do what you please.
You will anyhow, so I might as well say it. Drink this, and don't
bellyache."</p>

<p>Denver obeyed, shuddering as he waved the empty glass away.
"You'll make me sick yet. But, listen, you cut that week down to
about three-four days, Doc. As a personal favor to me."</p>

<p>"I'm not God," said Williamson, closing his bag. "But I'll
drop around tomorrow and see if some packs and some massagin'
won't work a little of the bruise out of you. Now, get some
sleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep&mdash;I'm so full of sleep I'd float," grumbled Denver
fretfully. "Go on away and leave me alone."</p>

<p>Williamson paused in the doorway. "Well," he mused, "I'm glad
it wasn't worse." That was his only display of sentiment, his
only admission of the deep concern he had felt for a man he
loved. Closing the door quietly, he went out to treat Pete
Atkins, who had taken a bullet through his leg in the fight.</p>

<p>Denver stared at the ceiling, calculating his condition. A
week was a long time to be helpless while Lou Redmain raced
through the hills. If the renegade would just play 'possum for a
while, it would be all right. But the thought was not worth
entertaining. He knew Redmain. The man was a furnace of tempers.
He had tasted blood, and like all killers, low or high, he would
be lusting for more. Redmain had boasted on that night in the
Wells&mdash;it seemed months back&mdash;that the sky was his
limit. He wouldn't know enough to stop, and there was no
audacious scheme he would turn away from.</p>

<p>The fly, or one of its innumerable cousins, made a graceful
loop through the air and came to rest on Denver's nose. Denver
blew him away abstractedly. Then he lifted his sound right arm
and considered it. He had the means of defense left him. Or
attack either. One arm was better than no arm. And the right arm
was a little better than the left one, though he had been trained
from childhood to shoot with either. He waved it across from one
side to another, feeling the stiff and aching resistance of his
chest muscles. Changing tactics, he operated the member up and
down&mdash;and woke more muscles to discomfort. There seemed to
be no single square inch of his body free from hurt.</p>

<p>"Must of lit on all four sides at once," he gloomed. "I recall
Dann pluggin' my horse. I recall goin' down that slope like
somebody that'd been sent for in a hurry. I bounced. Yeah, I sure
did bounce. Anyhow, I faded to the sound of music and shootin'. I
bet Dann would have stood on top of the ridge and made a target
out of me all day long if the boys hadn't heard the ruction from
the trees and come along. I must have been within hailin'
distance of them that morning when I went into Tom's Hole.
There's another item Redmain had figured down to the seventh
decimal. He had it doped we'd come struggling out of the brush
and take the shortest road home. And so he planted himself. No,
by George, a week is too long. He'll be started on a campaign of
ruin before I'm up."</p>

<p>The renegade had uncanny perceptions of attack and defense.
Denver was candid enough to admit his own mind didn't move as
fast as Redmain's. Redmain was like a sharp sword, flashing in
and out while he, Dave Denver, was as slow moving as a bludgeon.
He didn't have the dash, the flair; he could only do as he always
had done: beat doggedly ahead, take punishment, and keep going
for the knockout blow. There was that difference between them;
and the fight would be so waged. Until one of them got in the
killing blow. No other end than that. A kill.</p>

<p>The fly made another landing. Denver looked cross-eyed at the
insect. "Oscar, I'm gettin' disgusted at you. Go play with your
own friends." And he made a swipe at his nose that flexed all the
mass of jangling ligaments in his body. He relaxed groaning.</p>

<p>Patience was not one of his virtues, and when Lyle Bonnet
brought in supper he was morose and irritable. "Roll me about
five hundred cigarettes, Lyle, and pile 'em on the table. I've
tried to do it one-handed and wasted three sacks of heifer
dust."</p>

<p>"Want me to spoon this nutriment into yuh?"</p>

<p>"No," rasped Denver, "I'll spill my own soup on my own
chin."</p>

<p>Bonnet chuckled. "What big teeth yuh got, Grammaw. Well, I'll
go eat and set half the crew to rollin' the aforesaid cigareets.
There just ain't nothin' we ain't bright enough to do in this
outfit."</p>

<p>"Go 'way and let me think."</p>

<p>Bonnet caught that one neatly. He raised a skeptical eyebrow.
"Well, that'll be something different, anyhow." Grinning broadly,
he departed.</p>

<p>When, an hour later, he returned, Denver lay silent on the
bed. So Bonnet put the cigarettes in a row, laid out a bunch of
matches, turned down the lamp, and tiptoed away with the dishes.
Denver, who only had his eyes closed, heard all this; and through
his morose discontent he felt a warm glow of affection. Bonnet
was as tough and devil-may-care as they made them; but he was a
man. In the middle of the night when he drowsed he faintly heard
the latch click and somebody come in for a moment.</p>

<p>Next morning he was cheerful for a little while. Bonnet
arrived to say he had sent out four of the outfit to settle down
in convenient locations; he was taking all the rest on the ranch
but five, to go out on the fake roundup.</p>

<p>"Why leave five here?"</p>

<p>Bonnet's reply was a little too casual. "Oh, just to hang
around."</p>

<p>Denver seized upon the suspicious manner instantly. "Spit it
out. You've got something in your coco."</p>

<p>"Shucks," grunted Bonnet and studied his cigarette. "Oh, well.
If yuh got to know, I'm leavin' 'em for protection. Redmain done
rode his bunch into Leverage's, scared the women, and made his
brag generally. Eve&mdash;by golly, I hand it to her&mdash;took a
pot shot at Dann, and Redmain burned a lot of stuff and killed
off the saddle stock. That's why."</p>

<p>Denver's body stiffened; the violet of his eyes began to
suffuse. Bonnet hurried on. "Doggone it, I knowed it would just
make things worse! Cut it out and calm down. No good bustin' an
artery. I give orders to the fellas stayin' behind. They camp on
the porch until I'm back."</p>

<p>Denver thought it out, mastered his hot rage. "I can see
what's smokin up now, Lyle. He'll never be satisfied at just
plain revenge. Lord have mercy on the people he chooses to hurt.
We've got to get busy. And we've got to have more men. Today you
angle over to Steele's. Talk to Hominy. Tell him you're short-
handed. Tell him the D Slash estate will stand back of the wages.
Argue five men out of him. These five&mdash;" and he named
them&mdash;"I know are absolutely to be trusted. When we get 'em
down here we can break the news."</p>

<p>"Good enough. Well, I'll have news by tonight."</p>

<p>"You better have," said Denver. Bonnet went out. Denver waited
until he heard the horses being saddled. Then he got into
action.</p>

<p>He swept away the bed covers and slowly drew his knees up,
working them cautiously. He put his good arm under him, turned
half over. He kicked half a dozen pillows to the floor, rolled on
his face, and settled his feet to the carpet. And again by the
aid of his useful arm he pushed himself straight.</p>

<p>His head throbbed, his knees quivered a little. But he was up,
and that was something to write home about. Supporting himself at
the bedside, he stared with a thin-lipped triumph at the familiar
walls. "Oscar," he grunted, "just take a look at this and tell
your children. Maybe I wouldn't pass as a civilized specimen with
my shirt tails a-flappin', but I guess a fellow's got a right to
wear underclothes in his own bedroom."</p>

<p>He sneezed, rousing a headache. Specks floated around the room
and disappeared. He steadied himself, waited for his vision to
clear, and decided it was time to do something else. So he put a
foot forward and aimed for the dresser. It was not bad at all,
excepting for a particular joint in his hip that seemed to bite
him at each step. Arriving at the dresser, he peered into the
mirror.</p>

<p>"Good God, is that a face?"</p>

<p>Within the cowling of bandages was half a forehead with a sort
of cross-hatched pattern of scars, a skinned nose, a pair of
puffy Ups, and two red-rimmed, groggy eyes. The eyes rolled
owlishly, turned puzzled, turned cold. Denver swung away. "I look
like I've been drunk since Lincoln was shot. Now, there's one
more important test. If I can sit in that chair without breakin'
my back&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swerved, making for the bed. The door opened, and Bonnet
stepped in with his mouth half open to speak. Denver stopped dead
and essayed a smile&mdash;a crooked, furtive smile as of a man
caught stealing chickens. Bonnet slammed the door behind him and
lifted the quirt dangling on his wrist.</p>

<p>"Damn you, Dave Denver," he cried, hard and angry, "get back
in that bed! Ain't there a lick of sense in your stubborn head?
What the devil do you think Williamson's makin' a long trip out
here for every day? Can't nobody tell you nothin'? Get back
there! Go on. I've got a ninety per cent notion to tie yuh
in."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right, I'm goin'," muttered Denver.
Getting down was harder work than rising. He made three futile
attempts to lift one foot and collapse gradually. Bonnet stood by
in stony silence. Denver swore and closed his mind to the
inevitable hurt; he swung his good shoulder to the bed and
pitched forward, rolling the rest of his body after. Very slowly
he clawed the quilts around him. "All right, Simon Legree," said
he, panting like an engine, "crack your whip and see if I
care."</p>

<p>"Listen, Dave, I want yore promise not to essay that stunt
again today. Either that or I don't budge. I'm gettin' all-fired
tired of playin' wet nurse, and I ain't goin' to see yuh do
anything that'll stretch it out. Do I get the promise?"</p>

<p>"You got it. What'd you come back for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Had a blamed good idea what you was up to. Saw the glitter in
yore eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll stay quiet today. But I'm a sound man, Lyle. And
tomorrow I aim to get on my hoofs again. Williamson's all wrong
about this week business. I can't wait a week."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I know Redmain too well. Hell's brewin' somewhere. I don't
know where, and I don't know how. But I know. There never was a
time of trouble in this country that I didn't get the whisper of
it. The old feelin'. Somethin' passin' through the air. Medicine
drums beatin'. And I'm just enough savage to feel it&mdash;hear
it. Go on, Lyle. I'll stay in bed today. But when I get well I'm
going to burn the cursed thing."</p>

<p>"Lay there, doggone yuh," said Bonnet, and went out.</p>

<p>"Either I fire that buzzard," decided Denver, "or I give him a
quarter interest in the ranch."</p>

<p>A steady ache throbbed through his body. He shut his eyes, but
that only seemed to bring him nearer the pain; so he opened them
again and stared at the ceiling. There was a drifting crack in
the plaster that reminded him a little bit of the Copperhead's
meandering course. The reverse turn would be about at the lower
falls. The first little offshoot was Butte Creek. Weeping Woman
fell in just above. But from that point the crack curved the
wrong way, and Denver had an impatient desire to get up to the
ceiling and correct the error. He closed his eyes again,
groaning. "If I ever get off my back I'll sleep on my stomach the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>Once he had thought this bedroom to be a pretty nice place.
After the dreary hours in it he decided he had never seen a more
barren room in all his days; and suddenly it occurred to him his
own life was equally barren. What sort of a game had he been
playing all these years&mdash;and where did it lead? What was he
fighting for, why was he building up the ranch? Who cared, other
than himself, whether he had a dime or a fortune? Always until
now the day and its work had been sufficient. His own energy had
carried him along, from the first flush of dawn until dark. Up
and away in the saddle, riding the trails, standing over the hot
brand fire, full in the brawl of the dusty, bellowing herds. Into
town to watch his accounts, to meet with the Association, to
drink and joke a while among men of his kind. And home to eat and
sleep. That was all the ranch house meant&mdash;a place to go to
and to depart from. Nothing more.</p>

<p>In such a day there was no time for reflection, no need of
long brown thoughts. Nor was he a man given to introspection. His
own vitality, his own love of rough life sufficed; the primitive
pleasure of feeling the rain slash his cheeks or the sight of the
sun exploding riotously into a crimson setting&mdash;these things
were enough for a pagan. They had filled his day.</p>

<p>Until now. The house was too quiet, too empty. The cook's
footfalls echoed too blankly. With a growing uneasiness he
reflected that his own career was much the same&mdash;full of
sounds echoing into blank corners. It surprised him to find he
had blank corners. He thought he had done very well by himself.
It surprised him to find this strange disquietude running through
his body. Actually it was like hunger, a hunger for something he
had never had&mdash;something he couldn't even place.</p>

<p>His turning thoughts skipped the gap, and he recalled the
evenings he now and then spent at Leverage's. Jake Leverage
seemed to mellow and take his ease inside the walls of that
pleasantly warm and comfortable house. No blank corners
there&mdash;none whatsoever. And in another abrupt jump Denver
saw Eve standing at the door, smiling out of her steady eyes, the
fragrance of perfume in her hair faintly crossing the shadowed
porch to perplex him. A serene, boyish figure with lurking
laughter about her; yet this was the Eve who had taken a gun to
fire on Dann. Denver closed his fists and glowered at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"That pack of dogs has got to be wiped off the earth," he
muttered. "They might have hurt her. I've been the Lord's worst
fool to stand aside all this time and let Redmain get enough
power in his hands to be able to do that. Leverage was right. It
didn't make any difference to him if there was crooked influences
back of the vigilante idea. He was fightin' to keep his women
safe. Bein' married, bein' a father made him see that. I didn't.
I'm just a half-wild rider, nothin' more. Good God, I wish I was
up!"</p>

<p>His head was so tangled with all this thinking that he lost
trace of what he was trying to unravel. He closed his eyes, and
the extra exertion of the morning put him to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, alert and startled, there was the sound of
singing out in the big room. A woman singing. He had no need to
guess; only Lola Monterey's voice carried that husky, infinitely
sad pitch&mdash;only Lola had the power of throwing herself into
words until the very air vibrated with her personality. The song
was in Spanish, and the melody of it seemed to blend all the
ancient wisdom of love and life and tragedy. It swayed
hauntingly, fell to a whisper, and rose like a clear call. And
suddenly broke off, to leave the silence bleak and tense. Denver
lay immovable. A quick step tapped over the big room's floor. She
spoke.</p>

<p>"David."</p>

<p>She was at his door, her hand brushing it lightly. Denver
watched the knob, suspended between a desire to call and the grim
need of being silent. But he never had the opportunity of
deciding. Lola cried, "David!" again. The door flew open. She
paused, tall and beautiful and supremely moved. Then she threw
herself into the room and fell beside him, head on his chest,
choking out her words.</p>

<p>"David&mdash;I sang to wherever you were! To call you back, my
love! And then I knew you were not dead!"</p>

<p>One of the hands appeared in the door and motioned
apologetically. "She jest wanted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out of here," said Dave. He put his hand on the jet and
shining head. Saying nothing for a while, knowing nothing ought
to be said. The pound of her heart lessened; the trembling of her
body died away, and it was as if she slept, hands tight on his
shoulders. He had no idea how long a time passed, for his
thoughts traveled the old bitter pathway backward, and he was
lost in a memory that was fire and flame, laughter and
quarrel&mdash;like sunlight flashing intermittently through storm
clouds. Then Lola sprang up, tipped her chin; and through the
film of tears her eyes were smiling.</p>

<p>"So I live always, David. From hurt to joy. Never even, never
serene. Why did you do it&mdash;why did you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I can't tell you, Lola. All I say now is
that when you go out of this house you've got to carry yourself
just the same as when you came in. Not by a single look or
thought or word must you be changed. I'm publicly dead&mdash;and
so I remain until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is only one reason," said Lola, whose eyes never left
his face. "You hope to get Lou Redmain."</p>

<p>He had no reply. Lola spoke swiftly. "Lou is deadly."</p>

<p>"I'm not exactly skimmed milk, Lola. Wasn't there a time when
you called me a hard man?"</p>

<p>"I know, but Lou never gave anybody a fair chance in all his
life&mdash;except me. There's something in him that warps every
good impulse. He will tell you he is your friend. He will
actually mean to be honest and fair and straight. But after a
little while he turns aside. I never realized that until I had
thought back from the very beginning of when I'd known him. He
tricked you up in the hills, didn't he? Dave, he will do it
again. And you'll go straight ahead, as you always do,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not with Redmain," grunted Denver. "I fight him as dirty as
he fights me. I expect nothin' and I give nothin'."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment. Then: "Does Eve know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord forgive me, no! She thinks I'm dead."</p>

<p>Very softly she added a question: "And how about me, David?
Did it occur to you I might be hurt too?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I've always hurt you, Lola."</p>

<p>"The light of day," said she in a half whisper, "died out."
But she shifted to gayety on the instant. "I must not carry on.
Who wants to see Lola Monterey in tears? Only women who are loved
can afford to show unhappiness. David, my dear, get well. You are
scowling because you can't be on your feet, because you are not
the old domineering David Denver."</p>

<p>"Not sure," he mused. "A man does some powerful thinkin', flat
on his back. The little round world don't look the same. Maybe
I've been a fool. Maybe I've rode alone too long. It's
lonely."</p>

<p>"Then there is hope for you," said she, her red lips dimpling
at the corners. "And perhaps some hope even for me." Leaning
swiftly down she kissed him. "For old times, David. Be good."</p>

<p>"You've got to forget I'm alive," he warned her. "You've got
to hide your feelings."</p>

<p>"What have I been an actress for all my life? Isn't that just
what I always must do&mdash;seem sad when I'm so happy I want to
cry out, and seem glad when there's nothing in me but an
ache?"</p>

<p>She went out, trailing grace and vivid color. And the room was
again four shabby walls.</p>

<p>Doc Williamson, returning in the late afternoon, found his
patient locked in gray rebellion.</p>

<p>"You've got to fix me up," said Denver. "What with?" was
Williamson's sarcastic rejoinder.</p>

<p>"What do I care? Use dope, or balin' wire, or an ax. But
you've got to do it. You're a doctor, ain't you? Then get
busy."</p>

<p>"For that," promised Williamson, "I'm going to rub you so hard
you'll yell like a dyin' Comanche."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Try and make me yell."</p>

<p>"Wait'll I get some hot and cold water."</p>

<p>Williamson was just rolling down his cuffs and looking rather
more tired than usual when Lyle Bonnet returned. Bonnet
grinned.</p>

<p>"Did yuh give him the works, Doc? That sucker bed this mornin'
and tried to walk."</p>

<p>"Sure, all lunatics are like that," said Williamson.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" was Denver's impatient interruption.</p>

<p>"The most important item is," reflected Bonnet, "that Steve
Steers has posted his intentions of gettin' Dann, and has
challenged Dann to meet him any place, at any time."</p>

<p>Denver swore in round, blistering phrases. "That damn idiot!
He can't do it&mdash;Dann's too fast for him. We've got to stop
it. Listen, you race a man over to Nightingale's. Use any excuse
to get Steve here. I'll break the news. I didn't want to do it
for another couple days, but we've got to haul him around, or
he'll get shot cold. Hurry up."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII&mdash;THE DUEL</h2>

<p class="first">STINGER DANN kicked the ashes of his small fire
together and ground them out. Sunlight streamed into the glade,
the odor of bacon and coffee lingered faintly on&mdash;and Red-
main's right-hand gunman greeted his fourth day of lone hunting
with an accumulated moroseness.</p>

<p>There were two sides to Dann, neither of them any credit to
him. In a pitched engagement, such as with the vigilantes and
Denver, he let himself go with an unreasoning and tigerish fury,
never considering safety, never slacking off in his desire to
destroy and inflict pain. But in this present affair with Steers
he was a different man altogether, stolidly patient enough to
wait all year for his chance, and avoiding every false move. He
might have forced the issue sooner, for he had seen Steve Steers
two or three times from afar, and he recognized the fact that
Steers was advertising his position and issuing a challenge. In
each instance Dann recoiled from the setting, thinking a trap to
exist, or considering the odds uneven. So he held back, waiting
for the time when Steers, tired of the crossplay, would become
reckless. Dann knew the occasion would arise. Because of that
belief he kept to the high levels, out of the traveled areas, and
changed locations each night. He had waited behind Shoshone Dome,
watching the stage road. He had taken a covert position near the
Copperhead bridge. Then, shifting his position, he had settled
down near Nightingale's ranch. But of all places this was the
least profitable. Steers was not using the ranch as a base.
Therefore Dann moved south of Starlight and took to his present
position, which was on a wooded butte commanding the end of
Sundown Valley, the stage road, a half dozen forking trails, and
the prairie.</p>

<p>He had another definite reason for holding off. Not being a
fool, he knew no man in Redmain's shoes was to be trusted; in
this illicit kind of a life it was dog eat dog, with no scruples
shown. During the hours of solitude it had been borne upon Dann
that he was practically stationed between two fires. No longer
did he have the mass protection of the wild bunch. He was on his
own, an isolated outlaw to be shot at. And what was to prevent
the bullet from coming out of the wrong
direction&mdash;Redmain's? Such things happened. He had been a
valuable man to Redmain, but the chief treated him scurvily.</p>

<p>"He's afraid of me," grunted Dann to himself, watching the
road below. "He's runnin' the bunch, and he don't want me to
interfere. Higher they get, the more nervous they get. I can
tell. He's took to watchin' his shadder&mdash;and that ain't
healthy for anybody that crosses his path. But I was a sucker to
leave. He meant somethin' by it. It wasn't just no case of
gettin' Steers. Anybody could get that washed-out runt. Why pick
me? Yeah, he had an idea, the slippery rat."</p>

<p>The sun rose higher, melting morning's dew. Three Leverage
riders came around one side of the butte, patrolled as far as
Starlight, and circled toward their ranch. Dann felt a strong
desire to scatter them with his rifle, such being the rankling,
surly state of his mind. And momentarily his resentment grew.</p>

<p>"I was a sucker to leave," he repeated. "Who's done all the
hard work for Lou Redmain? Me. He gets the credit. And still he
plays his own hand well enough to tell the wide world I shot
Denver. I had ought to of stayed. It was smokin' up to a fight
between me and him&mdash;and it only needed one bullet to settle
him. That's my crowd, not his. He's afraid of me, that's what.
Well, I'll get this job over with and go back. And we'll see
who's&mdash;"</p>

<p>His roving glance came to focus. Beyond Starlight, a rider
pursued the Sundown-Ysabel Junction road with a free gait. Dann
crouched closer to the earth, sidling a little to keep the
approaching man in view. He reached back for his rifle,
considered the distance from butte to road, and slowly sent the
bolt home on a shell. Tentatively he settled the gun to his
shoulder. But in the very act of rehearsing the forthcoming scene
he let the gun fall and scurried off to get a view of the reverse
slope. The Leverage riders were still in sight. Dann watched them
drift along, a scowl deepening on his red face. Then he returned
to his original location and swept the green timber on the far
side of the road, all the way up to the mouth of Starlight. That
canyon was a tricky stretch of country. Denver country with
Denver men in it; and the solitary rider had all that to his back
as he loped ahead.</p>

<p>It was Steve Steers. Dann had recognized him at the first far
glance. Steers rode with a peculiar flopping of elbows and a
distinct swaying in the saddle; moreover, Steers had a favorite
horse, colored like a blanket&mdash;a small horse that lifted his
feet high. Dann leveled his gun on Steers, still engaged in the
debate with himself. There was such a thing as missing his
target, considering the distance; there was also the ever present
possibility of a trap. Dann never forgot that item. And while he
tarried, keeping his sight on Steers, the latter went rocketing
through the throat of the hills, fell down the long grade, and
was beyond reach. Dann cursed slowly, flipping over the rifle's
safety. He watched Steers settle to a long straight course
southward.</p>

<p>"He's goin' to the Junction," decided Dann. "And that's the
chance I been waitin' for. Once he's out of these hills I know
blamed well there ain't anybody helpin' him. Now I got him just
like I want!"</p>

<p>He rode down the butte side, shot across the road, and gained
cover once more. Fifteen minutes later he appeared on the edge of
the prairie, away off to the left rear of Steers, who had become
a bobbing point in the distance. An arroyo stretched over the
undulating land like an avenue; into the protection of this Dann
descended, whipping his horse.</p>

<p>Steve Steers never rode abroad without unconsciously absorbing
the details of the land. This was range training. And recently he
had been especially vigilant because of his challenge to Dann.
Whether or not Dann was gunning for him, he couldn't tell, for in
all his roundabout riding during the last four days he had found
no sign of the burly outlaw. But today he crossed the prairie in
a fairly relaxed frame of mind. Outside of the broken stretch of
country called the Sugar Loaves half way to the Junction and the
Mogul canyon slightly farther on, there was no place for an
ambusher to hide. These two geographical man-traps he put behind
without accident. Once, quite a few miles to his left rear, he
had picked up a moving object and then rather suddenly lost it,
but it was like a ship sighting another ship down the horizon and
he paid scant attention. Two hours from Starlight he reined in at
the Junction and dismounted, a little dry, a little drowsy, and
expecting nothing. The only definite thoughts he had in mind
related to his errand, which was to send a telegram up to Salt
Lake to a certain gentleman who specialized in doing detective
work around stockyards. He had talked the matter over with
Niland, and they had agreed it might be illuminating to have the
man look into Fear Langdell's shipments as they arrived, more
especially studying the flesh side of the brands after the steers
had been skinned.</p>

<p>He walked toward the station house, contemplating the utter
desolation of this pin point upon the map. A dripping water tank
dominated Ysabel Junction, which was half the reason for there
being a railroad stop here at all. The other half rested on the
presence of a long series of cattle pens and loading chutes that
ran the full length of about eighteen hundred yards of siding.
There were also three bilious colored section shanties, now quite
empty of life, and a few flimsy sheds. And this was the scene.
Steve ambled through the open door of the station house with an
increasing sense of weariness. The telegraph clacked crisply
through the droning air, but when he passed from the waiting room
into the agent's combined office and living quarters he found
nobody present.</p>

<p>"A large and busy life," he reflected, easing himself into a
chair. "I'd go nuts if I didn't have nothin' to do but watch the
trains pass by. This and sheep herdin' is my idea of absolute
zero in human activity. Now I wonder where that gazook has done
gone and lost himself?"</p>

<p>He rolled a cigarette and tilted the chair against the wall,
considering it easier to wait than to go out and shout. A fly
buzzed around his head, and he closed his eyes. The telegraph
chattered companionably for a while, then fell silent. The world
was large, and there was plenty of time, a seasonable share of
which slid painlessly by before Steve took cognizance of it. The
telegraph rattled again, and though Steve knew absolutely nothing
about Morse code, he thought he detected a regular sequence in
the call. The reiteration of it made him slightly uneasy; rising,
he walked along the walls and studied the pictures tacked
profusely thereon, most of them women out of magazines. Some had
clothes on.</p>

<p>"Mama," grinned Steve, knocking back his hat, "come save your
son! This fella has got taste."</p>

<p>After a while even the undeniable novelty of art appreciation
waned. Steve considered. "His hat's here, his coat's here, and
so's his gun. There's his pipe. Well, I guess he's got more time
than I have, so I better look. Funny thing, but the less a man's
got to do the harder he is to find."</p>

<p>He went back through the waiting room and stepped to the
cindered runway. Not a soul stood against the hard bright day.
Outside of the Mexican houses and the open sheds there was no
place of refuge available to the agent. Steve began to resent the
cosmic indifference sweltering around him. He opened his mouth
and emitted a strident bellow.</p>

<p>"Hey!"</p>

<p>No reply. Not even an echo. It appeared there was no power
sufficiently strong to dent the overwhelming vacantness. Steve
considered the water tank thoughtfully. "Wonder if he climbed up
there to take a bath and couldn't get out? HEY!"</p>

<p>He swore mildly and started for the Mexican houses. "Well, if
I got to find him, I got to find him. But the type of help this
railroad company employs shore is scandalous." His boots ground
audibly into the cinders, then struck soft sand. The first
Mexican house lay a hundred yards down the track, while a short
fifty feet to the left stood the gaunt ribs of the first loading
pen. Steers reached for his tobacco and had grasped the package
in his fingers when a shaft of hard cold warning plunged through
the lethargy of his mind. His hand froze to the tobacco sack, his
feet faltered. But an impulse raced like lightning to his lagging
muscles, and he pressed on, keeping the same tempo. There could
be no turning back to the shelter of the station house now. He
was a broad, fair target, and no safety presented itself short of
the loading pen, which in that same interval had drawn a thousand
miles off. Sweat prickled his skin; then he was cold and
nerveless. He felt his face cracking under the strain of
maintaining it lazily indifferent. And the end window of the
nearest Mexican shanty stared at him like the eye of death.</p>

<p>"Trapped, yuh lousy fool!" he cried to himself. "One move out
of place and yore dead as a last year's snake skin! My God, why
don't yuh think! Now, now&mdash;keep goin'&mdash;a little
more&mdash;a little more! Don't run for it yet!
Don't&mdash;run&mdash;for&mdash;it&mdash;yet!" And while he kept
cautioning himself and throttling the impulse to panic it seemed
he was standing dead still. The apertures between the corral bars
were like so many mouths jeering at him. The silence of Ysabel
Junction had drawn to an awful thinness, ready to burst with a
roar like the crack of doom when Dann's gun spoke. And for every
yard he gained to safety there was also a yard shortened between
himself and the unseen weapon.</p>

<p>A small voice inside his brain said distinctly, "Now!" Steve
leaped aside, lunged for the corral, leaped again, and heard a
gun's fury booming out of the section house. He fell to the
ground, rolled against the base of the corral, sucking dust into
his lungs. Bullets ripped madly through the posts, knocked off
splinters, sent up sand sprays a foot beyond his head. Steve
weathered through it. The shots ran out. Dann cried furious from
the shanty, "Yuh wanted this, Steers! Stand up and get it!"</p>

<p>"No more shells in the rifle," thought Steve and jumped to his
feet. Dann leaped through the door of the shanty and crossed the
open area to the side of the corral before Steve could set
himself for an answer. The outlaw had resorted to his revolver;
he sent another bullet over the compound but it ripped the wood
behind Steve.</p>

<p>"That's one," muttered Steve and retreated to the back line of
the corrals. Dann was retreating also, ducking under the loading
chutes. Steve paralleled him. Dann stopped and dropped down.
Steve did likewise.</p>

<p>"If he's tryin' to draw me into them corrals," grunted Steve,
tasting sweat, "he's got another guess comin'. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He crawled on and came to a narrow alley. Dann was waiting
there and opened up again. Steve rolled back. "That's numbers two
and three&mdash;too close."</p>

<p>"Steers&mdash;I'll meet yuh out in the open, at yonder
end!"</p>

<p>Steers said nothing. He passed his arm into the open, drew the
fourth bullet, and heard Dann retreating again on the run.</p>

<p>"Tryin' to get far enough off to load&mdash;damn him!" He
delayed only a moment longer, or until he sighted Dann through
the bars. Rising, he took the alleyway on a gallop. Dann whirled
back, fired, and came to a stand. Steers thought, "He's got me
hipped again. He's all set and aimed. Well, what of it?" And he
fell out of the alley. Dann's last bullet ripped through the
fullness of Steve's coat; and then Steve stopped and faced Dann
directly.</p>

<p>"Steers," said Dann, throwing open the cylinder of his gun,
"I'm out of cartridges. If yuh want to be a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" was Steve's toneless answer. He lifted his weapon,
aimed, and fired.</p>

<p>Dann trembled, fell to his knees. He tried to hold himself up
by his hands. They gave way under him. He struck on a shoulder
point and tipped to his side. Steve walked up, looking at the
outlaw without the trace of feeling, with no more compassion or
consideration, than he would have given to a fallen leaf.</p>

<p>"Dyin', Dann?"</p>

<p>"Cashin' in&mdash;by God!" breathed Dann. All the ruddiness
faded before that final gray of death.</p>

<p>"Good. It won't be necessary to waste another shot. Die quick.
I despise lookin' at yuh."</p>

<p>"Framed," coughed Dann. "Me. I made a mistake.
Listen&mdash;I'll square it with Lou Redmain. Listen. He's goin'
to burn Sundown."</p>

<p>"When?" said Steve. But Dann was dead, and as his muscles gave
way and he settled on his stomach he seemed to shake his
head.</p>

<p>Steve turned around. The station agent stood half in and half
out of the Mexican shanty. Catching the scene he ran toward the
station, calling back, "Dann held me in there&mdash;and that
condemned key's been tappin' for half an hour!"</p>

<p>Going by the shanty, Steve saw Dann's horse also crowded
inside. He led it out and left it beside his own. Automatically
he reached up for his tobacco and then remembered he had flung it
down beside the corner of the corral. He went back; it had been a
full square sack once, but there was nothing left now but a few
shreds of fabric and a ball of tobacco bearing his finger marks.
He kicked it away and walked into the station. The agent's nerves
were jerking him around in a sort of St. Vitus's dance. "I'm
quittin'," he told Steve. "Feel bad? Of course I feel bad. You'd
feel bad, too, if you lived in a joint where nothin' moved except
your pulse&mdash;then all of a sudden something like this hit you
in the face. I'm through! Here&mdash;this just came over the
wire. You goin' to Sundown? Well, take it in. Save waitin' three
hours for the stage. It's to Ed Storm at the bank. He'll want to
know. Pay-day money shipment comin' to him."</p>

<p>Steve looked at the shaky symbols on the open sheet of paper.
There were only four of them, reading as follows:</p>
<br>

<p class="cp">
<span class="smcap">ABACUS SIN EULOGIZE HAROLD</span></p>
<br>

<p>"How do yuh know?" inquired Steve.</p>

<p>"Because I know. Now, what about that fellow&mdash;Dann?"</p>

<p>"Here's somethin' I want yuh to send over the wire for me,"
said Steve. "I wrote it down."</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;I won't stay around here with that body out
there! I won't touch him!"</p>

<p>"There's the message," said Steve, laying it on the agent's
table. "Here's two dollars. And if a thing like that upsets yuh,
friend, Yellow Hill is sure no place for you."</p>

<p>"Ain't you got any nerves?"</p>

<p>"Nerves?" grunted Steve. His voice began to grow thin on him.
"Yeah, but I ain't proud of 'em. They don't help atall. A man in
this country with nerves ain't got no more chance than a snowball
in hell."</p>

<p>"I almost went bughouse," said the agent, squirming in his
chair. "Him a pushin' me against the wall of that shanty with his
gun! Say, he was a cold cucumber! I heard you, and there I was,
not able to do a single thing but listen for you to die!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Steve, "it's pretty simple. You die or he dies.
And there ain't no great amount of time decidin' who is who. If
yuh live there's nothin' to worry about. Otherwise yuh can't
worry. Say, you got a drink around here, a drink of hard liquor?
No? All right, I reckon I can stagger home without it. I'm
leavin' Dann's pony. If the wild bunch don't come along tonight
the sheriff will. Send the message through."</p>

<p>He rolled out to his horse and turned north across the
prairie, eyes half closed to the glare of the sun. Unconsciously,
he began to sway in the saddle, moving his arm from side to side,
screwing up his face, touching the butt of his gun. Not until his
dragging spurs set the pony to curvetting did Steve realize what
he was doing; he quelled himself sternly.</p>

<p>"Here, here. This is all over with. Why fight the battle
again? He's dead. I'm alive. He missed me with twelve slugs, and
I killed him with one, which I never expected to do. He could
beat me to the play any day in the week, any hour in the day. If
he'd stood right out to plain sight, announced himself, and
walked forward on even ground, I'd be dead now. But no. He had to
make a sure thing out of it. He had to foller his sneakin',
treacherous nature. And so here I am, safe and sound&mdash;and a
million years old."</p>

<p>Lassitude crept through his body, he sat in the saddle like a
half-filled sack of meal. His cigarette had no taste to it, and
his senses refused to reach out into the world as they were wont
to do. Never in the twenty-five years of his life had he felt
more weary. "Gettin' a touch of the grippe," he surmised, not
knowing that in the few minutes of action by Ysabel Junction he
had used up the energy of a week's hard labor. And so sluggish
were his thoughts that he had passed Mogul Canyon before they
broke out of this furrow of reasoning into another.</p>

<p>"I never thought," he mused, "I could ever stand over a man
and find pleasure in watchin' him die. Never thought I'd ever
reach the point of holdin' a gun on him for a second shot in case
the first wasn't enough. Starin' at him with no more feelin' than
'sif he was a snake. Glad to see him go&mdash;and tellin' him so.
Man's got to be pretty far along to do a thing like that. I
reckon I must be different than I figgered I was. Worse or
better&mdash;the Lord knows. But I'll never ride as light and
easy. Not no more." And long afterward, as he entered the first
lip of the hills and felt the shadow of the pines fall on him, he
added, "What difference does it make? What good have I gone an'
done? Denver's no more. Redmain still rides&mdash;and here I
am."</p>

<p>He pulled himself from these dismal reflections with effort.
He was approaching Starlight, approaching a horseman who jogged
out of the timbered slopes of the canyon. The horseman stopped on
the road and turned, waiting. Steve considered this suspiciously
but kept his gait. Presently he discovered it was Lyle Bonnet.
Lyle lifted a hand and swept forward, reining abreast. Enormous
relief registered on his face.</p>

<p>"Yuh feather-footed, sword-swallerin' brush jumper. Where yuh
been? Where ain't yuh been? I been pokin' into every prairie-dog
hole, bear den, and holler stump in the country. I been lookin'
for yuh. Tell a man!"</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Steve and sat silent.</p>

<p>Lyle Bonnet looked at the man more closely. This was not the
same Steve. No flicker of harum-scarum humor moved in the pale
blue eyes, no drawling melody played through the answer. This
fellow who rested woodenly in the saddle and stared back
mirthlessly, mouth pinched together, was an uncomfortable
stranger; and Lyle Bonnet had the queer sensation of seeing
somebody who was Steve's counterpart.</p>

<p>"Yeah, there yuh are," grumbled Bonnet, "and I reckon it don't
mean nothin' to yuh that I've just naturally trotted the hocks
off six horses tryin' to locate yuh. Looks to me like yuh ain't
had no sleep since the Fourth of July, 1887. Where was yuh?"</p>

<p>"Doin' a chore," said Steve and again let the silence
fall.</p>

<p>"My, my," observed Bonnet. "Talkative cuss. Well, come on to
the ranch."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"There's been some developments," was Bonnet's evasive answer.
"In fact, there's a sorta meetin' to discuss topics of mutual
benefit and interest."</p>

<p>Steve considered it and nodded. "Let's go, then," was all he
said.</p>

<p>Bonnet led him up Starlight at a rapid clip. Once he drew away
from Steve and turned to discover the man lagging beside the
canyon, head lifted as if scanning the far ridge. But Steve came
on, and presently they arrived at the crest overlooking the D
Slash yard. Right beside the trail was the fresh rectangle of
earth marking Denver's false grave. Steve passed it hurriedly,
cheeks like stone, and trotted up to the house porch.</p>

<p>"Who's at this meetin'?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>Bonnet indicated the house negligently. "Go on in."</p>

<p>Steve pushed the door open, started to cross the sill, and
stopped like a man shot through the heart. Denver stood in the
center of the room, supporting himself with a cane; and Denver
attacked him instantly, bluntly, severely.</p>

<p>"Where in the name of common sense have you been? What
business have you got ridin' like a wild man through the country,
challengin' all the tough eggs as if you were Wild Bill in
person? Don't leer at me like that. It's a fine situation when a
man can't find his friends in time of need without sending a
posse out. Come in and shut the door."</p>

<p>Bonnet was directly behind Steve. Steve swung on his heels,
pushed Bonnet aside with a curse, and walked to the far end of
the porch. Bonnet went inside.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," he remarked, "as if you was goin' to get
both ears chawed off in a minute."</p>

<p>Denver grinned wryly. "Well, I had to say somethin' to take
the edge off this reunion, didn't I? I suppose he'll give me
fits, and I suppose I've got to grin and bear it."</p>

<p>A weird honking sound came from the porch. "What's that?"
demanded Bonnet, starting out.</p>

<p>Denver checked him. "No, stay here. Steve's just blowin' his
nose. Sentiment seems to affect his breathin'. Where'd you find
him?"</p>

<p>"Comin' out of the prairie, lookin' like Israel's last child,
like the sole survivor of the flood, like the fella who'd forgot
his name. What I mean, he was sorta that way, if yuh gather
me."</p>

<p>"In parts and by slow stages," grunted Denver. "Stick with me
and don't let him strike a cripple. Here he comes."</p>

<p>Steve stood in the doorway, thumbs hooked in his belt. His
face was drawn together in an enormous scowl.</p>

<p>"So yuh come back, Mister Denver?" he stated coldly. "They
didn't have no wings in heaven yore size, and hell wouldn't let
yuh in. Just a big overgrown practical joker, that's what. My,
my, I thought I'd die of laughin' when I heard you'd kicked the
bucket. Listen, Denver, you got no title to have any friends. In
so far as I'm concerned yuh might just as well climb back in the
grave. Imagine a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's his voice," opined Denver, nodding to Bonnet. "But that
face ain't familiar."</p>

<p>"Never mind my face," snapped Steve. "Yores won't bear much
daylight, Mister Denver."</p>

<p>"Think of that, Bonnet," grieved Dave. "Think of that kind of
talk from a man I practically raised from poverty."</p>

<p>Steve yelled, "What in the name o' Jupiter did yuh go and do
it for?"</p>

<p>Denver smiled&mdash;a rare and warming smile that drew the
resentment out of Steve like a poultice. "I know it hurts. But
somebody had to be hurt. I wanted it thoroughly advertised around
this country I was dead. And I think you made a pretty good
advertisement."</p>

<p>"So I wasn't to be trusted?" Steve grumbled. "You had a part
to play, Steve."</p>

<p>"Never do that again," warned the puncher.</p>

<p>"You hear? Never do that again."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Denver. "I'm lucky to get off like that.
But what's this foolishness I hear about you?"</p>

<p>"That's more of the part I was to play," retorted Steve.</p>

<p>"Well, don't go gunning for Dann," admonished Denver. "When we
take him into camp it will be along with the rest."</p>

<p>"You won't never take him to camp, Dave," said Steve
gently.</p>

<p>Bonnet and Denver looked more closely at Steve. Bonnet said,
"Say, was that why yuh come up from the prairie lookin' like yu'd
swallowed a lemon?"</p>

<p>"You met him?" challenged Denver.</p>

<p>"Yeah," muttered Steve. "At Ysabel Junction. He laid a trap,
and I walked into it like a fool kid. He took twelve shots. I got
him with one. And laughed in his face when he died."</p>

<p>Quiet came to the room. Denver tapped his cane on the floor,
lips compressing. "You took a whale of a chance, Steve," he said
finally.</p>

<p>"Consider that next time you play dead on me," replied Steve.
Then his puckered face was swept up in a grin. He walked forward
and struck Denver on the chest. "Yuh wildcat, they got to use
dynamite to remove yuh from this mortal map! Well, here I
am&mdash;and what's next?"</p>

<p>Denver smiled again. "Bonnet, here's our Stevie back home
again."</p>

<p>"Listen," added Steve, "I got somethin' to say. Dann died
thinkin' Redmain had framed him. So he squealed, and you can take
it for what it may be worth. He said Redmain was plannin' to hit
Sundown and burn it to the sills."</p>

<p>"When?" demanded Denver and Bonnet in unison.</p>

<p>"He died on me and didn't tell."</p>

<p>Denver limped around the room. "I wish I knew where Redmain
was hiding. None of the boys are able to pick up a smell. We've
got to find out. We've got to do it, in a hurry. Burn Sundown? If
that's in his head, he'll never stop short of fillin' his
promise. Not Lou Redmain. He'll destroy right and left."</p>

<p>Steve put a hand in his coat pocket and pulled out the station
agent's telegram. For a moment he puzzled over it. "Oh, yeah," he
murmured. "I've got to drag into town with this. Agent said it
was somethin' for Ed Storm. Money comin' in for the pay
days."</p>

<p>Denver stopped in his tracks. "When?"</p>

<p>"This is code, but the agent seemed to know. He said
Saturday."</p>

<p>Denver drew a deep breath. "All right. If we can't find
Redmain's date of attack, we'll make one. We'll make it worth his
while to come in on Saturday&mdash;after the money arrives. You
go give the message to Ed. Then go get a few drinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>Steve lifted a protesting hand. "I never want to see liquor
any more."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Get a few drinks and let your tongue waggle. Mention
about the money in Grogan's. Mention the date. The news will get
to Redmain. Never worry about that. And it'll be all the bait he
needs to set off his raid."</p>

<p>"Then what?" insisted Steve.</p>

<p>"Then you go back to Nightingale's and mind your business
until I send you word to come. When I do, waste no time."</p>

<p>"What'm I goin' to tell Ed Storm? He won't like it."</p>

<p>"Al Niland knows Storm. Have Al explain."</p>

<p>"Explain what?" Steve wanted to know. "And do yuh put the job
of tellin' Al yore still alive on me? Ain't I had trouble
aplenty?"</p>

<p>"Tell Al the whole story. But get him off in a private place
to do it. Then, when he stops swearin', you tell him this: He is
to go to Storm, explain that the news of the shipment has leaked.
He is to ask Storm to take absolutely no step toward extra
defense of the bank, nor to take any measure that would draw
suspicion. Everything is to go on as before. But when Redmain
comes to town that day, I will be there&mdash;with men."</p>

<p>Bonnet broke in. "That's drawin' things down to a fine point,
Dave. Supposin' Redmain don't wait for the money to get to the
bank. Supposin' he holds up the stage out in the hills?"</p>

<p>"If he has set his mind to destroy Sundown," said Denver, "he
will do it. And it's my belief he'd wait until the money was in
the bank and so be able to kill two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"Burnin' Sundown sounds to me like the dream of a wild man,"
said Bonnet. "I don't see how he figures to have the chance of a
one-armed Chinaman."</p>

<p>"He will ride into town with more than thirty men," Denver
answered. "Who would try to stop him?"</p>

<p>Steve agreed. "An organized party always has got the bulge.
People in town will sit tight and say nothin'&mdash;hopin' the
trouble will blow over."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Denver. "They will be covered in a hurry.
Redmain will hit the bank, drop a half dozen matches and be on
his way. And when a substantial fire starts through those
buildings Sundown is gone."</p>

<p>"I still think yore drawin' things too fine," objected Bonnet.
"A single leak&mdash;and blooey for us."</p>

<p>"It will be a gamble," said Denver, eyes narrowing. "But
that's the best we can do. If we don't do it I'm afraid of the
consequences. Better ride, Steve. It's gettin' late. And try to
look sad."</p>

<p>"That ain't hard," opined Steve, "considerin' I got to tell
Niland yore alive."</p>

<p>Bonnet still doubted.</p>

<p>"And how you goin' to get near Sundown on Saturday without
bein' seen?"</p>

<p>"That's the gamble," replied Denver.</p>

<p>"I know a bigger one," reflected Bonnet. "Which is you tryin'
to fight in your present shape. Foolish."</p>

<p>"Forty-eight hours from now I'll be a well man," stated
Denver.</p>

<p>"And mebbe stone dead on the forty-ninth," said Bonnet
moodily. "This fella Redmain never answers to reason. That's why
I think somethin's haywire in all this schemin'. It don't sound
right."</p>

<p>Denver shrugged his shoulders. "Either Redmain's makin' a
mistake or I am. We'll soon find out."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE MISTAKE</h2>

<p class="first">The little man of the olive skin who faded so
successfully into the background of Sundown sat on a bench by the
Palace and smoked his black paper cigarette puff at a time. He
looked up to the large stars, thinking whatever sly and secretive
thoughts his little head permitted; and he looked again to the
dusty, lamp-patterned street and saw Steve Steers enter town.
Very carefully the little man pinched out his smoke, crouched
back, and waited. Steers went directly to the bank, tapped on the
window, and was let in; five minutes later Steers came out,
teetered between the restaurant and Grogan's, and succumbed to
obvious temptation. The little man rose, crossed the street by a
dark lane, and followed into the saloon, slouching against a
wall. Steers was drinking. Beside him stood Al Niland, another
citizen the little man found time to watch. The two were talking.
The little man sidled forward.</p>

<p>"Can't I drink?" Steve was asking Niland.</p>

<p>"Don't baptize yourself in it again," warned Niland.</p>

<p>Grogan leaned over the bar in his striped silk shirt sleeves.
"As a personal favor to me, Steers, go light on the liquor and
I'll supply it free."</p>

<p>"It ain't worth the price, even gratis," observed Steve and
won for himself a black regard. "Money in the bank. I wonder who
gets it all?"</p>

<p>"What money?" asked Niland.</p>

<p>"I'm a regular Wells-Fargo messenger," muttered Steve
mysteriously. "I brought a telegram today from the Junction to
Storm. Code, accordin' to the station agent. Money comin' to the
bank."</p>

<p>"Don't spend any of it here," warned Grogan. "That last
jamboree won't bear repeatin'. I took all I ever will from you.
We'll consider the slate clean. But don't try it no more. Just
accept the advice of a kindly spirit. What money was you talkin'
about?"</p>

<p>"Fatherly," grunted Steve. "You'd put a knife in me if yuh
could, Grogan. I know. But don't worry. I didn't say it was my
money, did I? It's the bank's, or will be when it comes
Saturday."</p>

<p>Niland found a dozen interested listeners roundabout. He
jogged Steve's elbow. "You've got no right peddlin' the contents
of private telegrams, Steve. That applies double to bank affairs.
Don't you know? Hush up and come get a steak."</p>

<p>"What's the harm?" Steve wanted to know. "Bank's a public
institution. Money's common currency."</p>

<p>"Just so," agreed Niland. "Sometimes too commonly current.
Ever hear the story about the man that held up the stage? Listen,
are you coming after that steak or do I bring it to you in a
sling shot?"</p>

<p>There was some friendly wrangling between them. The little man
drank his glass down to the last neat drop, paid for it, and slid
out of Grogan's just as inconspicuously as he had entered. On the
street he paused to relight his black paper cigarette. Impulse,
or perhaps a cautious desire to check what he heard, turned him
toward the bank. Passing it he squinted through the window and
saw Ed Storm locking up; a little farther on he drifted against
Steve's horse and tentatively rubbed the animal's chest, feeling
the crust of sweat and dirt. With these gleanings he drifted down
an alley, skirted the back of the Palace and ascended upon
Langdell's stairway. He listened, applied his eye to the keyhole,
tapped discreetly. Langdell didn't call but the little man
entered anyhow, with one swift and sliding motion.</p>

<p>Langdell looked up from his desk. The little man murmured,
"You want me, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"No. Get out. I'm busy."</p>

<p>"Thought you wanted me."</p>

<p>Langdell straightened, slipped off his eyeshade and motioned
the little man to stand farther from the windows. "Well, if
you've got something let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" parried the little man and fastened a hungry
glance on Langdell's bottle locker. It seemed to be a ceremony
Langdell had to endure. He nodded his head and the little man
indulged himself in a full glass. "But I do know somethin'," he
added. "Steers is in town."</p>

<p>"Not worth the drink," said Langdell. "I'd found it out myself
soon enough."</p>

<p>"Him and Niland has got their heads together at Grogan's."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"Steers is publishin' the fact he carried a telegram to Ed
Storm. Money bein' shipped in Saturday."</p>

<p>"That telegram," grunted Langdell, "is always in code. How
does he know? What right's he got to talk about it if he does
know? Blabbin' is a fool caper. It's the bank's business."</p>

<p>"I thought I'd tell."</p>

<p>"Well, don't keep runnin' to me with stuff I can't use."</p>

<p>"You don't want me to see Redmain pretty soon?" persisted the
little man.</p>

<p>"No," said Langdell. "Get out." He swung his chair back to the
desk and bent his head. His pen made a flourish and stopped in
the air; kicking the chair around again he stared at the little
man who stood like a shadow in the corner. "What put that in your
mind?" snapped Langdell.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Don't bluff. You know Redmain very well, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not bein' allowed to talk much," said the little man, "I use
my eyes and ears considerable."</p>

<p>"You think he'd try that?"</p>

<p>"He's et raw meat and likes the taste of it," averred the
little man. "He might try this, if he was told to. Mebbe would
anyhow, told to or not."</p>

<p>"You're too cursed wise," said Langdell, frowning. "You know
too much."</p>

<p>"If you want him to, I had better go see him. If you don't
want him to, I better see him also. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>Langdell rose and poured himself a drink; when he lifted his
face a cold, sea-green light flashed against the lamp rays. "He's
eaten too much raw meat to be of much use to me these days. I'll
have to talk to him. Say nothing about the money. Tell him I'll
be at the Fish Creek crossing Friday. He's to be there."</p>

<p>"I thought you might want to see him," said the little man and
slipped away. The door closed soundlessly, leaving Langdell in
the center of the room, frowning at his empty glass.</p>

<p>As for the little man, he found his horse in a back shed and
rode out of Sundown. Twice he turned, shifted direction, and
curled back on his trail. He came to a bridge but avoided it and
forded the creek at a dark eddy. More than an hour from Sundown
he caught the flicker of camp light and approached it directly.
There was no hesitation about him, no groping. One moment he
stood in the dangerous outer darkness; next moment he was
stepping down from the saddle beside the fire, gravely eying the
men who sprang up.</p>

<p>"The chief?" he murmured, comforting himself with a cigarette.
There was a long delay. Men murmured; a soft call went out. Boots
slid around the little man; Redmain stepped into sight.</p>

<p>"Some of these days," said Redmain, "you're going to get shot
so full of holes you won't hold baled hay. You sift in here too
easy. How did you know I'd changed camp?"</p>

<p>"I knew," said the little man and held his peace.</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"This is news," said the little man. "There is money coming to
the bank. And a certain person wants to see you at the Fish Creek
crossin'."</p>

<p>"He told you to tell me about the money?" demanded Redmain,
interest sharpening his face.</p>

<p>"No. I'm tellin' you about the money. You want to know things,
don't you?"</p>

<p>Redmain put out his arm and hauled the little man nearer the
light. He studied the passive face carefully. "You're a nosey
little rat. Who told you about any money?"</p>

<p>"Overheard Steers tellin' it," remarked the little man. "He
brought a message from the Junction to Storm at the bank. It was
in the saloon. Steers was drinkin' a little."</p>

<p>"Pay-day money," reflected Redmain and seemed to harden with
suspicion. "But what's Steers got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say. I felt his horse. Seemed likely he'd come from
the Junction, though. Horse crusted some with sweat and prairie
grit."</p>

<p>"When is this to be?"</p>

<p>"Money comes Friday. He wants to see you at Fish Creek
crossin' Saturday."</p>

<p>Redmain moved his head. The little man got on his horse and
merged with the night, not realizing he had twisted his
dates.</p>

<p>Redmain stood by the fire a long while afterward, looking into
the heart of the flickering coals. "I don't trust him, and I
don't trust Langdell," he muttered. "I don't trust anybody. But
if that is true, by the livin' Judas, I'll wring Sundown dry
before I set it ablaze. Here&mdash;Hugo, Slats, Mexico&mdash;come
over here. I want you to ride tonight."</p>

<p>The men came nearer. Redmain spoke in quick phrases. "If this
is bait, I'll find out. One of you camp near Nightingale's all
day tomorrow and until Friday afternoon. Keep an eye open for
riders movin' away. Hugo, do that. Slats, same around the Denver
outfit. Mexico, ride on the hill above Sundown and see if that
joint gets heavy with any undue population."</p>

<p>"Leverage?" queried one of the men.</p>

<p>"Leverage's out," stated Redmain. "And I'll do the thinkin'
for this camp. Go on, you men. If it's straight, we're due for a
young fortune&mdash;and a bonfire like you never have seen
before!"</p>

<p>"How do yuh feel?" inquired Lyle Bonnet, facing Denver in the
big room of the D Slash house.</p>

<p>"That's the fourth time you've asked me in the last half
hour," said Denver. "I look sound, don't I? Well, that's the way
I feel."</p>

<p>"I wish yuh didn't limp thataway," muttered Bonnet, "and I
wish that left arm wasn't tied in no sling. It's bound to affect
yore speed."</p>

<p>"If you keep harpin' on disaster much longer, Lyle, I'll tie
crpe on your arm. Stop squintin' out of the window. What do you
see, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"A blamed dark day," gloomed Bonnet. "It's goin' to rain
before night. That mebbe don't mean a thing, but it's funny it
should cloud up just before we move against Redmain."</p>

<p>"The sooner dark falls tonight the better."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Say, do yuh realize that this is Friday and it falls on
the thirteenth? I ain't got a lick of superstition in me, but I
don't see the necessity of goin' outa our way to borrow
trouble."</p>

<p>"Get out of here before you break down and cry," said Denver.
He looked at his watch. "Time to roll the ball. I guess we're
organized right. There's ten men along the Copperhead on roundup.
Seven out draggin' the Little Bull Canyon for strays. Four left
here. Five scouting for sign of Redmain. That's twenty-six. The
three boys that took their walkin' papers brings it to twenty-
nine. All of 'em nicely scattered. That's the big point, Lyle. We
can't go toward Sundown in a bunch. You managed to get word to
the fellows on scout?"</p>

<p>"They're to drift toward Sundown," said Lyle Bonnet, "and meet
in the timber back of Lola Monterey's house. Ahuh."</p>

<p>"That's right. The seven in Little Bull Canyon will wait until
dusk and ride for the same place. But the bunch on the Copperhead
will come to the ranch, eat supper, and walk around the yard.
Then sift off one by one. We can get away with that. If anybody's
watchin' us from the brush they won't be the wiser, for there'll
be about five to stay behind and act as a sort of blind. We
should all be behind Lola's house by eight o'clock and ready to
move."</p>

<p>"Leavin' them five behind pulls us down to twenty-four,"
observed Bonnet. "And if I can't get in touch with Gallup and
Limerick Lane durin' the afternoon that'll reduce us to twenty-
two. Ain't enough."</p>

<p>"Plenty, if things go right," returned Denver.</p>

<p>"Supposin' things don't go right," Bonnet wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of anything absolutely sure and certain in
this crooked universe, Lyle?"</p>

<p>"Death an' taxes," grumbled Bonnet. "And the trickiness of Lou
Redmain."</p>

<p>"Time for you to pull out. When you get to the Copperhead,
send one man over to Nightingale's and tell Steve to be behind
Sundown by seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"That helps," said Bonnet. "How are yuh feelin'?"</p>

<p>"Get out of here!"</p>

<p>Bonnet departed. Denver took up a slow tramp about the room,
trying to work the stiffness from his muscles; trying to suppress
the wild impatience feeding into his veins.</p>

<p>Hank Munn, who had been dispatched by Lyle Bonnet to warn
Steve, reached Nightingale's about noon and found the home part
of the crew eating. Both Nightingale and Steve were at the table
and Munn drew up a chair willingly. Not until he had quieted his
appetite and risen from the table did he speak of business, and
then it was in a very casual way.</p>

<p>"We got nine o' yore strays held out for yuh, Steve."</p>

<p>"I'll send a couple hands right over," said Steve and idly
walked with Munn to the latter's horse. Munn swung up, observed
that they were beyond earshot, and murmured, "Denver says to be
in the little clearin' above Lola Monterey's house around seven
o'clock tonight. That's all." And he rode away.</p>

<p>Steve built himself a cigarette and walked for the porch. En
route, he called two of his men over and told them to lope after
the strays. Then he settled himself on the porch steps and waited
until Nightingale came from the table.</p>

<p>"I think," mused Steve, "I had ought to hit Sundown this
aft'noon."</p>

<p>"You're the boss," agreed Nightingale.</p>

<p>"I mebbe won't be back till late."</p>

<p>Nightingale stuffed his pipe, azure glance flickering along
the back of the foreman's neck. "The world will meanwhile toss
along its accustomed orbit," he observed.</p>

<p>"In fact, I dunno just when I will be back."</p>

<p>Nightingale's match waved gently across the pipe bowl. There
was a prolonged silence. "One would infer," the Englishman
presently reflected, "that the nature of your business is vague
to the border of doubt."</p>

<p>"Ahuh," said Steve. "Just so, only more so."</p>

<p>"One is led to wonder," proceeded the Englishman with the same
indifferent calm, "whether or not there might be some mystical
connection between the D Slash gentleman's arrival and your
departure."</p>

<p>"Was it that plain?" grunted Steve, turning to his boss. Alarm
showed on his face.</p>

<p>"Not so," said the Englishman. "I was merely applying the
ineluctable law of physics. Action and reaction. The little
pebble dropped into the pool produces ripples that run their
concentric course."</p>

<p>"No doubt yore right," agreed Steve. "Anyhow, it sounds like
it ought to be somethin' swell."</p>

<p>"Old fellow," said the Englishman, "don't be so dashed shy.
Y'know, you are not as hard to read as a Babylonian tablet. Two
and two do not always make four, but it is a safe thing to count
it so. I should not wish to pry into your affairs, but I will
remind you I liked Denver. And I've had no huntin', no fishin'
durin' the age of an extr'ord'n'ly mature coon."</p>

<p>Steve faced the Englishman. "All right. I'll say it. Denver
ain't dead."</p>

<p>"My sacred aunt," said Nightingale, hauling the pipe from his
mouth. The ruddy angular face did not bend to every passing
emotion, and it scarcely showed astonishment now; but there was a
brightening of the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I said worse than that when I found out," said Steve. "Well,
he ain't dead. He's only played 'possum to throw Redmain off. And
he's got a plan to get Lou. It ain't for me to say how or when.
Only, I'm ridin' to Sundown, and yuh'll see me when yuh see me."
The Englishman carefully knocked out his ashes, rose to his full
length, and turned into the house. "Ad interim," he called back,
"remain as you were."</p>

<p>Steve gloomed into the distance. "Some of these days I'm goin'
to get a toe holt on one o' them outlandish words and pin it to
the mat. Meanwhile I just look intelligent and hope he ain't
swearin' at me. It goes to show how ignorant folks can be. Here I
been all these years thinkin' Englishmen talked the same language
as us."</p>

<p>Nightingale returned, hat on, and gun strapped to his hip.
"All we need to complete this tale of border warfare is a set of
heathenish bagpipes. You may like it or not, my estimable
superintendent, but whither thou goest I shall follow. Lead
on."</p>

<p>Steve got up. "Mr. Nightingale, this ain't goin' to be no
joke. God only knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The disposition of Providence," said the Englishman gravely,
"is not to be questioned. One prays and follows the light of
conscience."</p>

<p>Steve got in the saddle. Nightingale swung beside him, and
together they cantered north-west. Steve found his first
admiration of the man strongly kindled. He never pretended to
understand the Bucket owner's moods. Humor and gravity were too
closely blended; the man's thoughts were too contained, never
breaking out into the broad wild fancies of the range. Sometimes
Steve was certain Nightingale caught very little of what went on;
and at other times, such as the present one, he had the
uncomfortable feeling the cattleman's aloof indifference covered
a sharp and penetrating mind. But, nevertheless, Steve usually
felt at ease with Nightingale, for something about the Englishman
kept reminding him of Denver.</p>

<p>They ran down the trail without a word between them, crossed
the open flats of the upper Bucket range, and went over the Helen
Creek ford. Beyond a ridge they pursued a broad wagon leading by
Lunt's home quarters. Steve intended to turn aside, but abreast
the house he heard his name called in that crisp, assured manner
so familiar. Instantly he checked in. Nightingale overran him and
looked questioningly back. Steve grinned and muttered, "Be with
yuh in a minute," and cantered to the ranch gate.</p>

<p>Debbie Lunt came down the path, her pretty, sharply defined
face studying him.</p>

<p>"Were you going by without stopping in?"</p>

<p>"Sort of busy today, Debbie."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen you since the afternoon in Sundown."</p>

<p>"Been all over the map meanwhile."</p>

<p>"Apparently so," said Debbie. "I sent Bill over yesterday, but
you weren't around."</p>

<p>"Whistled for Rover but he wouldn't come, uh?"</p>

<p>"That's not funny, Steve," said Debbie with increasing force.
"I don't like that kind of humor, if you meant it as humor. If it
was sarcasm, you ought to be ashamed. I wanted to see you
yesterday. I have heard something. Can't you come to the house a
minute?"</p>

<p>Steve shifted in the saddle, looked at Nightingale waiting in
the distance, and shook his head. "Debbie, I can't do it
now."</p>

<p>Debbie moved her shoulders impatiently. "I suppose I shouldn't
insist. But you will have to listen to me. Steve, I have heard a
horrible story, and I don't believe it. Dad was in Sundown
yesterday and somebody told him a ghastly lie. That you had shot
Dann."</p>

<p>Steve waited. Debbie kept her eyes on him and finally said,
"Well?"</p>

<p>"No lie. I shot him."</p>

<p>"Steve!"</p>

<p>She drew back, put a hand to her face; and suddenly the color
on her cheeks faded. She stared at him as if he were a stranger.
A quick breath came out of her. "I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I told you, Debbie."</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve! Why&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because I said I would," answered Steve. The girl clenched
her palms together&mdash;a sign he knew of old, a sign he
dreaded. Debbie's anger cut deep.</p>

<p>"Because of Dave Denver?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"So you dirtied your hands, made a killer out of
yourself&mdash;because of him! What right does a dead man have to
make you do a thing like that? I know he was your friend! What of
it? I never liked him, and I don't now! The man despised me! And
he could wrap you around his finger any time he chose! A friend!
How far do you go for your friends?"</p>

<p>Steve sat like a rock, taking the punishment without a change
of expression. "As far as a friend would go for me. As far as
Dave would have gone&mdash;which was all the way to hell if I'd
asked him."</p>

<p>"You thought more of Denver than you thought of me!" cried
Debbie. "You do now!"</p>

<p>"If you'd think straight," replied Steve, "you wouldn't say
that. It's the same as sayin' a beefsteak tastes better than a
rose smells. The things ain't the same."</p>

<p>She flung back her head. "We must fight this out, Steve! We
must settle it! I'll be expecting you for supper tonight."</p>

<p>Steve sighed. "Debbie, it seems like yore askin' me to do
things today I can't. I'll be in Sundown tonight."</p>

<p>Debbie looked away, stormy eyed. She bit her lips, moved
restlessly. "I suppose I must wait, then. If it is ranch business
it comes before me. At least I'm glad to know you've got business
to keep you from running idle through the hills."</p>

<p>Steve said nothing, and Debbie challenged him swiftly. "It is
ranch business, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He seemed to debate his answer. "I ain't in the habit of
lyin'. No, it's not."</p>

<p>There was only one alternative in so far as Debbie was
concerned. "Does it have anything to do with Denver&mdash;or
Redmain?"</p>

<p>"Right now," said Steve, "I can't answer you, Debbie. Next
time I come back I will."</p>

<p>"Then it does!" exclaimed Debbie. "You are going down there to
mix up in Denver's quarrels again! Steve, I refuse to let you!
The man's dead! Lou Redmain's done nothing to you! You've no
business keeping up the fight. I refuse to let you, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>Very slowly Steve answered: "I reckon you don't own the right
to tell me whether I can go or stay, Debbie."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?" Debbie drew herself together. "Listen to me,
Steve! If you don't come back here for supper you need never come
back at all!"</p>

<p>A slow, brick-red mantle crawled up Steve's neck. "Mean that,
Debbie?"</p>

<p>"You know I mean it! You be here!"</p>

<p>Steve startled her into stiff silence by the changed pitch of
his talk. "You fool girl, I wish the Lord had given yuh enough
sense to get in outa the rain. I've been pushed around, led
around, shoved around by you and yore family until it's a wonder
I still wear pants. Who ever told you a man could be cussed into
shape? It's about time you learned your limits. I'm no Santy
Claus, and I'm no Lord Fauntleroy. There's lots of things about
me dead wrong, and I've got sense enough to know it. As regards
them, you can have your say any day in the week. But when it's a
question of how I conduct myself with men, how far I'm to ride,
when I'm to draw out, what I'm to say, neither you nor any other
woman that breathes has got the right of tellin' me a thing. I do
my work, I'll take care of my own conscience without help. And I
don't propose to be humbled in my own estimation or go around
with Jim Coldfoot's whipped-dog air. You seem to want a dummy for
a husband. Ain't you satisfied to be a woman without tryin' to be
a man likewise? Who taught you how to treat a man, anyhow? Yuh
been actin' like a nine-year-old girl who was afraid somebody was
goin' to steal her dolly. Grow up and get some average common
sense. You've sorta indicated durin' the last six months that
'most everything about me was haywire. All right, I admit it.
I've had to do a man's work ever since I was ten years old, and
Yellow Hill is no place to get the education of a scholar and a
gentleman. As for Dave Denver, he's a better man than me any
time, any place. And I owe him too blamed much to let the Lunt
family interfere, which includes yore maw and paw, yore brothers
and sisters, yore aunts and uncles and cousins, and all the rest
of the tribe which has offered free advice on my conduct. If I'm
the total loss yuh seem to think, I'll relieve you of the burden
here and now. Don't expect me tonight or any other night. Ma'm,
I'll bid you good-day."</p>

<p>He tipped his hat, turned, and spurred off. Nightingale joined
him, and they galloped across the meadow. As the trees reached
out to close them in Steve looked around; Debbie still stood by
the gate, crying. Steve groaned, said, "Aw, hell!" and shot past
the astonished Englishman.</p>

<p>They reached town near the middle of the afternoon, racking
their horses in front of the hotel. Nightingale cocked his blue
eyes on Steve for further information.</p>

<p>"I tell you," decided Steve. "You better bed down somewhere so
not to draw too much attention. Nothin's booked to happen till
after seven."</p>

<p>"Well enough," said the Englishman. "I shall get whatever
newspapers are available and settle right yonder in the porch
rocking chair for some leisurely reading. Give me the appropriate
gesture when you are ready."</p>

<p>"Read?" grunted Steve, whose increasing nervous tension would
not let him be still. "Imagine that!"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," murmured Nightingale, sauntering away. "People
have been known to do it."</p>

<p>Steve rolled to the nearest building wall and leaned against
it. Under the pretext of building a smoke he ran his glance from
one end of the street to the other. Sundown seemed unduly empty
until he caught partial sight of a crowd inside the courthouse.
Promptly he strolled across and went in, his entry marked by a
sharp gavel tap. The judge was speaking.</p>

<p>"...Thus with all the evidence before me, I am bound to render
decision. Litigants will remember that while the broad and noble
structure of the law incorporates and irradiates the sum of human
wisdom and human error of the toiling centuries, it is not meet
to say that it represents always infallible justice. The law is
both an embodiment of common sense and arbitrary rule, without
which confusion would reign sans end. The law is an increasingly
crystallized thing, a thing of tangible substance, form, and
shape. The forms of the law are, as it were, the ribs which hold
in the essence of the social body, and if, perchance, some of
that essence should trickle through those ribs and fall wasted to
the receptive earth, we can only say that nothing conceived by
mortal man is perfect, and nothing conceived by mortal man will
ever cover the infinite vagaries of social experience and the
multitudinous variations of human conduct. With that in mind this
court made the attempt to bring plaintiff and defendant into
harmony before trial. Failing, this action ensued, dragging its
weary lucubrations over the diurnal face of the calendar."</p>

<p>The court paused and scratched its judicial nose.</p>

<p>Up from the packed and stricken silence wavered a faint
cry.</p>

<p>"True, brother, true."</p>

<p>Sheriff Ortez leaned against Steve and whispered, "All this
fer a six-dollar pony on the aidge of nervous breakdown. Nobuddy
can say the judge ain't give 'em their money's worth."</p>

<p>"In re Wilgus versus Tuggs," stated the court, "concerning the
identity and ownership of one male horse of problematical age,
unknown antecedents, and endless branding, we find for the
plaintiff. So entered."</p>

<p>Wilgus rose grinning from his seat and yelled. "I said it was
my hoss all the time and I could of told you in the beginning!
What's mine's mine, and I'll have it! Let that be a lesson to
you, Tuggs!"</p>

<p>The gavel slammed down. "Five dollars for contempt of this
court," said the judge.</p>

<p>Wilgus subsided, muttering. Fear Langdell rose. "Your honor,
may I thank you for the just verdict? To my client this
represents a sweeping corroboration of a principle. And now I
should like to present the bill of costs, to be entered against
the defendant for payment."</p>

<p>"You bet," mumbled Wilgus. "He lost. Let him pay."</p>

<p>"The clerk will read the bill of costs," said the court.</p>

<p>The clerk accepted the statement from Langdell, shifted his
tobacco and read without emotion.</p>

<p>"'...Do swear the following items have been personally and
beforehand paid by plaintiff, as follows:</p>

<p class="first">

<p><br>
The court looked at Al Niland, found no objections, and said,
"So entered."</p>

<p>Wilgus could be heard again, murmuring his shocked surprise to
Langdell. "Great guns, Fear, you sure did lay it out. I told yuh
to go ahead, but I never did think it would come that high.
Supposin' I'd lost and had to pay?"</p>

<p>All through the courtroom was a mutter of discontent. The
gallery gods found this an unhappy ending to the thus far
splendid entertainment. Tuggs sat miserably downcast. But Al
Niland rose, smiling in that tight and gleaming manner Sundown
knew presaged trouble. The silence became absolute again. Niland
cleared his throat and made a generous gesture toward Wilgus. "I
congratulate you in having won a victory of principle. To such a
man of principle as all Yellow Hill knows you to be, the verdict
must be especially pleasing. There seems at this juncture nothing
for the defendant to do but pay the bill and bear up. In so far
as Tuggs is able to do these things he will. Fortunately we spent
very little on the case, having little to spend. I think our
costs will run about twelve dollars. A kind friend of Tuggs's was
generous enough to pay this. As to the bill just rendered by the
plaintiff, we will willingly pay all that we are able, and to
that end Tuggs has itemized for me a list of all his earthly
possessions. They include, two blankets, three quilts, some
dishes, the suits of clothes he wears, a mouth organ, and one
valise. Estimated value, five dollars at forced sale, excluding
the suit of clothes, which by law he is entitled to keep.
Therefore, your honor, we will pay over the five dollars readily,
leaving Mr. Wilgus out of pocket only $411.12."</p>

<p>The ensuing roar almost lifted the ceiling of the room. The
judge stood up and banged his gavel viciously; and above all this
turmoil and fury rose the agonized screech of Fleabite Wilgus.
"I'll see about that! It ain't so! I won't stand a penny of it!
I'll slap an attachment, a lien on every gol-blasted thing he's
got! There's stock&mdash;there's implements&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Silence in this court!" bellowed the judge.</p>

<p>"You can't skin me!" cried Wilgus, and shook his fist at the
judge. "You neither, you mealy-mouthed son-of-a-gun!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars for contempt!" said his honor.</p>

<p>Niland still stood and still smiled. His answering words
quieted the room. "For a man of principle, Mr. Wilgus, you should
not object to the price. If you can find anything to attach other
than the aforementioned articles, go to it. Tuggs rents the place
he lives on. He rents the implements, the harness, the very wood
he lights his fire with. He had five head of milk stock, which by
strange coincidence he sold twenty-four hours before the papers
in this suit were filed. He has one horse, loaned to him by the
late David Denver. Other than that he has nothing. The horse you
might have bought for twenty dollars now costs you better than
four hundred. It's the principle of the thing, Mr. Wilgus."</p>

<p>Wilgus shook his fist at his attorney. "Yore a fine lawyer!
Why didn't you tell me he didn't have nothin'? What made you run
up them bills so high, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Through all this Langdell had remained aloof and very faintly
amused. He stopped Wilgus curtly. "I said you might be better off
buying the horse, Wilgus. I said you would gain nothing
otherwise. Please be kind enough to stop moving your fist in my
face!"</p>

<p>"You paid them bills out of your own pocket!" shouted Wilgus.
"Just try and get any money outa me! You'll see!"</p>

<p>"The money," said Langdell, so quietly that only the front
rows heard it, "has already been deducted from the sum I owe you
on livestock purchases. Including my attorney's fee of $150. Stop
scolding your own lawyer, you fool."</p>

<p>Wilgus extricated himself from the fore part of the courtroom
and started out. At that same moment Grover, the livery stable
man, came in.</p>

<p>"Y'honor," he called, "whose horse have I got, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Turn it over to Wilgus," directed the court.</p>

<p>"Fine enough," grunted Grover. "Git yuh a team, Wilgus, and
drag him outa my place. He died on me, twenty minutes ago."</p>

<p>The courtroom became a weird scene of thirty or more men
collapsing on the benches; and the howling laughter started a
runaway down Main Street.</p>

<p>Steve shouldered to the street, for the moment at ease in
mind. Langdell emerged with graven irony; then Wilgus came
leaping after, stopped Langdell, and cursed him. "Listen, you!
I'll have yuh disbarred for this! Don't think I won't!"</p>

<p>"I have wound up my affairs with you, Wilgus," said Langdell,
cold as ice. "I wish to have no more to do with you. You
disregarded my first advice. I took your case in doubt. Now that
it is over I am free to say I'm not sorry at the result. I
despise your hypocritical manner, you dirty codger. Take this
warning from me: If ever you address me again in the same terms
you have just used, I shall challenge you on the street. Get out
of here!"</p>

<p>Wilgus glared at him and shambled swiftly off. The last
Sundown saw of the man was a pair of coat tails streaming down
Prairie Street on top of a fast traveling horse. Langdell drew
out a handkerchief, wiped a fleck of dust from his sleeve, and
turned in the direction of his office, throwing a non-committal
glance at Steve. Directly afterward Niland strolled through the
courthouse door. And then the ominous weight of oncoming events
dropped down on Steve's shoulders with an actual physical hurt.
Niland's eyes warned him. Together they walked as far as the
hotel.</p>

<p>"Anything more?" murmured Niland.</p>

<p>"He's collectin' the boys. Seven o'clock up behind Lola
Monterey's."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"No instructions. Wait till then and duck up there."</p>

<p>"Careful&mdash;careful," said Niland. "There's Redmain men in
this town. Not his riders, but sympathizers. What's Dave aim to
do?"</p>

<p>"Have to ask him. I wish I had a drink."</p>

<p>"Not now," said Niland quickly. "By the Lord, this thing
either goes off right, or it'll be the worst mess ever come to
pass. Frankly, I'm nervous. How does he figure to hold twenty or
more men just outside of Sundown all of tonight and most of
tomorrow without being seen? That's just the kind of a situation
Redmain loves."</p>

<p>"I know. What time is it?"</p>

<p>Niland looked at his watch. "Four-thirty."</p>

<p>Steve let out an enormous breath. "Great guns&mdash;"</p>

<p>Both of them drew up by the hotel. A rider came in slowly.</p>

<p>"Limerick Lane," muttered Steve. "And he either knows
somethin' we ought to know, or we know somethin' he ought."</p>

<p>"I'm going back to the office. Shouldn't be herdin' up like
this. See you later."</p>

<p>Niland turned away. Limerick edged his horse toward the
sidewalk and looked down at Steve.</p>

<p>"Got a match?"</p>

<p>Steve supplied it. Limerick lighted his cigarette and tossed
the match away with an easy glance all around the street. "What
you know these days, Steve?"</p>

<p>"That ain't the question," grunted Steve. "I know what you
know, up to noon today. What comes next?"</p>

<p>Limerick grinned cheerfully for the benefit of the world, but
his quiet words expressed trouble. "That's it. I thought you was
in this. I ain't got in touch with Bonnet for two days. I found
somethin' a few hours back, and I'm afraid to take the risk of
ridin' over to the ranch and bein' traced. I ain't supposed to
belong to D Slash any more. Those hard nuts have got the country
speckled with eyes. What'm I goin' to do?"</p>

<p>The street darkened unaccountably; Limerick's body grew gray.
Steve looked up to a sky filling with black; a far-off clap of
thunder sent its running warning across the heavens.</p>

<p>"What's your information?" inquired Steve, more and more
uneasy.</p>

<p>"Just about two hours ago I cut across an old worn-out trail
north of here. A whole slew of tracks on it, warm enough to cook
eggs. I think it was Redmain, borin' for the south at a fast
clip. Understand? South is D Slash, Nightingale's, Steele's,
Leverage's. Hell, south might be anything."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Steve earnestly, "you ease out of here slow and
put the prod after you get into the trees. Dave ought to know
that. He's figgered Redmain different."</p>

<p>"I was told not to go back there," mused Limerick. "I was told
to stick here and pass word to any D Slash man I saw."</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;you go. And don't let any dust settle on
yuh, Limerick. Denver will be on his way here in another
hour!"</p>

<p>Limerick considered it, forgetting to smile. "I suppose," he
muttered. "Well, I'll have to get a drink and make a stab at
lookin' lazy for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"If you can manage anythin' resemblin' a look o' laziness,"
said Steve, "yore a better man than me. I got a case o' swamp
fever right now."</p>

<p>Limerick nodded and rode off. Steve felt a heavy drop of rain
strike his hat. Nightingale was on the porch, buried in the folds
of a paper. Steve drew himself together and headed for the
restaurant. "If Redmain's caught wind of anything and intends to
catch Dave on the flank again&mdash;" He cursed under his breath.
"I don't dare move for fear of upsettin' the apple cart. It's
Dave's game, and I got to stick tight!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE MEDICINE DRUM
SPEAKS</h2>

<p class="first">THAT first small clap of thunder heard in
Sundown reached also to D Slash. Standing behind a window, Denver
saw the vortex of the storm swing in from the prairie. The
vanguard of rain pattered on the porch roof, and then day had
prematurely gone. At five o'clock the lamps were lighted. At
half-past, when Doc Williamson came, the world was quite dark,
and a wet, tempestuous night had set in. Williamson shook off his
slicker and stood a moment by the open fire, regarding
Denver.</p>

<p>"We also serve," he said with calm humor, "who only ride
around and get soaked. You look like you're up to something."</p>

<p>Denver nodded. "This left arm of mine's no good, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not for a month, Dave."</p>

<p>"Then I want you to bandage it tight to my chest. Tight enough
so I can't move it. I don't want it in my road."</p>

<p>Williamson opened his bag. "All right, Dave. This is a very
funny world&mdash;and that's the full sum of knowledge I have
gained in sixty some years. Seems little enough. Must be some
order about this universe, but it's hard to find. Maybe Yellow
Hill's outside the scheme of things. Sit down."</p>

<p>Neither Denver nor Williamson said anything during the
bandaging and prying about. Later, as the doctor was putting on
his slicker, the crew returned from the Copperhead. Bonnet
entered, water cascading from him. "So far, so good," he
commented. "But no signs. And no more to be had now."</p>

<p>"Get your supper," said Denver. Bonnet went out, leaving
Williamson standing thoughtfully in the center of the room.
Something in the mind of this weathered shepherd moved toward
expression but never came out. Denver broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You'll be going to Leverage's next?"</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>Denver reached into his pocket and handed Williamson a letter.
"Will you give this to Eve? Something I want her to know."</p>

<p>Williamson accepted it incuriously.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll not hand it to her until I am ready to leave
the Leverage home. I have no wish to see her face when she reads
it, Dave."</p>

<p>"I know," said Denver. "That's one of the things on my
conscience. I reckon I've got a lot of things to answer for. And
may soon stand in need of answerin'."</p>

<p>"Bad as that?"</p>

<p>Denver pointed toward the outside. A far-off flash of
lightning threw a faint glow through the window; the long,
rolling blast of thunder rocketed across the pit of night. "Hear
that, Doc? Medicine drums talking." Standing across from
Williamson, he seemed to swell with the dark fires of his inner
nature; seemed to grow taller, more somber. The cheek bones of
his rugged face stood out; his tousled head gleamed in a black
radiance. Light flashed from his eyes as he turned his head, and
then they were pools of shadow in the deep recesses. "Nothing of
very much importance has ever happened in this country that I
haven't felt coming. This troubled land seems to use me as a
sounding board. It's been like that too many times. I've heard it
one way or another&mdash;like that thunder out there, or the
sound of the Copperhead on the rise, or in the absolute silence
of a summer night. Invisible telegraph. Medicine drums. Whatever
you please to call it. But the warning is there&mdash;as it is
now. I've lived too close to the country, and I've fought it too
long to ever make a mistake about its temper. I'm about half a
savage, I guess."</p>

<p>"Personal warning?" asked Williamson quietly.</p>

<p>"No-no, I can't draw it that fine. But a man can sometimes
feel the bulk of something ahead of him, the premonition of
events about to happen. I will say this to you, Doc. Redmain and
I have been pointing at each other over a pretty long time, and I
would be willing to swear in absolute sincerity that one of us
will die at the hands of the other. I'm not upset over it.
There's the fact, neither more nor less. I'm not even overly
curious about the result. It's just one of those things a man's
got to face and take in his stride. What comes will come. I've
had about as many lucky breaks of fortune as anybody could
expect; there's always a time when the break goes the other way.
It's always been my belief that the country would some day get
me. Whether Redmain's the instrument to do it or not, I don't
know. But wherever he is, the man's dangerous."</p>

<p>"Agreed on that point," said Williamson. He sighed and looked
wistfully at the fire. "Some of these days I think I'll retire,
sit a week in front of a blaze like that and give in."</p>

<p>"Don't do it for a few days yet," drawled Denver. "You've got
customers comin' up."</p>

<p>"New ones, I hope, if there must be any at all. I get tired of
going over my old patches. That applies to you. Be careful."</p>

<p>He went out and was lost in the driving elements. Denver
walked to the gun case, slipped the black-holstered gun from its
peg. The last time he had reached for it, he remembered, he had
been like a furnace, ablaze with the desire to kill. Tonight no
similar whirlwind of emotion moved him. Rather he was gripped by
a sense of being inevitably pushed on toward a long-prepared-for
crisis of his life&mdash;a crisis made not by man but by a force
beyond man's control. It was as if the finger of destiny in
writing out the chart of his life had reached a point and the
voice behind that finger had said, "Here David Denver reaches a
turn. We will wait and see, nor write more till then." Wedging
one end of the belt between his hip and the wall, he buckled it
and shook the gun to its rightful position. Bonnet came back.</p>

<p>"I started the boys off already, one by one. They're about
half gone. Not a chance of anybody seein' down here tonight."</p>

<p>"Good enough," said Denver. "But we'll keep to the original
idea of spreadin' them out. And five will stay behind."</p>

<p>"Arranged for. Yore horse is under the shed."</p>

<p>"All right. You'd better drift."</p>

<p>Bonnet nodded impassively and left. Denver went to the
fireplace, kicked back a log, and entered his bedroom. He rather
awkwardly pulled on his slicker and turned out the lamp. A side
door led him to the porch, beyond the flare of kitchen lights. So
he stood for several minutes, catching here and there the dim
figure of one or another man shifting away from the yard.
Presently he crossed through the rain to his waiting horse,
climbed to the saddle and fared into the night.</p>

<p>All along the road he was wrapped in the same untouched calm;
all along it his thoughts revolved about the certainties of his
life. Here a regret and there a glow of deep pride; past and
present running queerly together. A song of Lola's in the old
days, still carrying to his inner ear the vibration of her
feeling. The still fresh memory of a time far back when he had
walked blindly down the dusk-ridden road feeling the grip of his
father's hand, hearing his father say, "She's gone now, Son, and
we'll just have to get along somehow." Eve's level eyes shining
at him in lazy humor or in soberness, but always straight and
clear. And through all these images, like a recurring thread
breaking across a pattern, moved the figure of Redmain: of
Redmain forever facing him with a flare of hatred, with passion
and lust to kill on the triangular face. Thus Denver rode north
while wind and rain whipped through the forest and the shuttering
lightning flashes revealed a tormented world. And so he caught
the lights of Sundown all blurred and glimmering from the
southern ridge. Working around, he aimed at the bright window of
Lola's cabin, passed back of it, and came within the silent
circle of his own men. Bonnet's voice checked off names
sibilantly; occasionally a groping rider challenged softly.
Otherwise nobody spoke. Time dragged; Denver's eyes held to
Lola's windows, and when her shadow passed across them he
struggled with memories he had long before willed to be
buried.</p>

<p>Somebody said, "Steve&mdash;and Niland. Dave come yet?"</p>

<p>"Here," muttered Denver.</p>

<p>They were afoot, and they steadied themselves beside his
horse. He dismounted. "Listen," said Steve, "did Limerick Lane
get to you?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Steve. "About four he came to town. He
had located Redmain's tracks&mdash;fresh and headed south."</p>

<p>Denver said nothing. Steve prompted him. "Don't that mean
nothin' to yuh, Dave? It means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It might mean anything, Steve," murmured Denver. "It might
mean he's caught wind, as he did before. It might mean he's off
to burn the lower end of the country. It might mean I've got no
more ranch now than a jackrabbit. Or it might mean he's in
Sundown at present, waitin' for me. No man knows what Lou Redmain
holds in his head."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you figure on?" interjected Niland.</p>

<p>Once again the silence fell. But when Denver broke it Niland
recalled what Cal Steele had said on a certain day in Grogan's.
"While you and I doubt ourselves, Dave never falters. He drives
ahead, and nothing will stop him." Standing there in the
miserable night, filled with foreboding and half fear, Al Niland
felt the supporting, comforting power of Denver's presence and
words.</p>

<p>"Do what I have planned to do," Denver was saying. "It seemed
a good idea yesterday, and it seems good now. I can't play up to
Lou Redmain's feints, I can't expect to read his mind. It moves
too fast for me. We'll go ahead per schedule."</p>

<p>Bonnet called the roll again and announced the result. "We're
all here, Dave."</p>

<p>"Crowd around," said Denver, and waited a brief moment. "Now,
this is it. We are going to drift into Sundown on foot, few at a
time and without being seen. We are going to crawl into a dozen
hidin' places I have in mind, stay there all of tonight and all
of tomorrow&mdash;until Redmain shows up. Not a sound, not a move
until then. When Redmain and his party enters Sundown and are
completely between the two rows of buildings, Niland will walk to
the courthouse firebell and ring it. At that stage we move in and
go to work. I depend on this being carried out. Not a stray move
in those hiding places. There must be no giveaway. And, Al,
you'll have to stay close to your office during this time in
order to reach that bell. Is it understood?"</p>

<p>A murmur of assent ran round the circle. Denver went on,
pairing off men, naming the places he wanted them. "Munn and
Jackson, you will go to the back of the empty bakeshop, climb to
the second-story front room. Nick and Bonnet, Phil Blaney and
Phil Jewel, you four hit the hay loft of the stable. Be careful
about that. Grover's night man is half deaf, but his sight's
good." He ran through the list, ending with a lone and youthful
puncher by the name of Kalispell. "Sorry, Kalispell, but you've
got the worst job in the lot. You're to bunch up the horses and
take them all the way back to the ranch."</p>

<p>Kalispell made no comment, and the darkness hid his feelings.
Denver said, "Munn and Jackson go first. Keep out of the light,
keep off the trail. We'll start the next pair in a couple
minutes."</p>

<p>Boots sloshed through the mud, and for one brief moment the
forms of the departing punchers stood against Lola Monterey's
house light. Niland spoke to Denver hardly above a whisper. "I
found something about Lang&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denver drew him away. "Considering what other name is mixed up
with him, be careful."</p>

<p>"You'll never prove this in any court," said Niland, "but
there were three men in the deal. You and I know the one we've
been worryin' about. Sorry, but it seems to be so. Langdell's the
second. As for Redmain, I have no written evidence of his being
the third, but what difference does that make? It works out."</p>

<p>Denver said, "Wait a minute," and walked back to the huddled
punchers. "Four for the barn, go ahead," said he, then returned
to Niland. "All right. But how did you make this?"</p>

<p>"A slip of paper in the desk of&mdash;the man we liked. It had
figures, representing cattle money. These figures are usually
divided by three. I went to Storm. I asked him as his friend to
answer certain questions. Never mind what he did or didn't
answer, or how I got my information, but Langdell's
account&mdash;in the bank at the state capital&mdash;shows where
one of these thirds went."</p>

<p>"Al, you are certain enough of that to hang him on it?"</p>

<p>Niland's reply was short. "Yes, or I'd say nothing now."</p>

<p>Denver took Niland by the shoulder. "If we get through this,
Al, we'll take care of him. Damn his heart, he'll get off easy
because we can't do anything to drag in the name of a better man
than he'll ever be. Come on. We're too slow."</p>

<p>He closed up to the punchers again. "All right. About six of
you this time."</p>

<p>"I'll pull out too," said Niland.</p>

<p>"Go ahead. You know what you're to do."</p>

<p>The wind brought up from the town muted fragments of piano
music out of the Palace. Denver listened for it, with nothing
better to do and no other means of keeping from his mind the
descending chilling feeling of disaster. Lola crossed the window
again, and from her chimney shot a shower of sparks that streamed
instantly askew and were snuffed out. The smell of wood smoke
came on; a crashing reverberation shook the sky. Steve's voice
was faint and seemingly distant. "The Lord's horses shore are
runnin' away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Out of Sundown rose the report of a sudden firing.</p>

<p>It struck Denver like the blow of a sledge, and he stood
rooted in his boots, saying, "It's Redmain, and he's caught me
again. My men are scattered all over hell." Then he was racing
down the slope, rage searing him at the thought of once more
being tricked&mdash;that battering rage of a solid fighter
maddened beyond belief by the jabs and slashes and swift parrying
of an always elusive antagonist. He cursed his way through the
trees, never realizing what black epithets he hurled ahead of
him. Steve ran beside him and yelled, "Go slow, Dave, go slow!"
The remnant of his men came after, slipping in the soft mud of
the trail, breathing hard at his heels. He passed Lola's house as
the door sprang open. She was in the doorway, a swaying
silhouette calling into the uncertain darkness. On down the grade
he ran, veering to catch the end of the street, Steve repeating
again and again, "Dave, damn yore soul, go slow!" Firing beat
more heavily out of the town, seeming strongest by Grogan's.
Considering this he swung again and came up to the back of the
Palace. Without a word he sprang down the alley, knocked some
fugitive townsman flat to the earth, and reached the street.</p>

<p>He checked himself, his men spreading to either side. Steve
muttered, "Good God, the town's lousy with 'em! Watch out,
they're in the Palace, too!"</p>

<p>The outlaw bunch had split into sections. They were by the
hotel, by Grogan's, in the shadow of the courthouse; they flashed
across the lanes of light and into blackness again, they made
swift forays, turned and charged back; and the crackling
detonation of the guns drowned all else. Muzzle lights flickered
weirdly. A woman in the Palace screamed. The report of two shots
shuddered through the door of the place; a man rode out of it,
straight against Denver. Denver lifted his weapon and emptied the
saddle, while starting toward Grogan's.</p>

<p>"Knock down that fellow on Prairie!" he shouted. "And come
on!"</p>

<p>The courthouse bell clanged violently. From the east end of
town Redmain's men swept along in close-packed ranks. Denver and
his followers were in the dead center of the street, facing the
charge; there they stood, pouring fire into the massed target.
Horses went down; riders careened, jammed up, and cursed clear.
Steve's voice lifted wildly, ran through Sundown like a tocsin of
battle, and from the yawning mouth of Grover's stable came Lyle
Bonnet's reply. The plunging Redmain riders swept forward. Denver
leaped aside, taking deliberate aim. Glass shattered on the porch
roof of the bakeshop, and the crash of a timed volley sailed over
his head, beating at the whirling horsemen; a rider fell to the
ground and knocked Denver flat. Denver rose and pointed his gun
to the mud. But the man was dead.</p>

<p>The renegades veered into the protection of Prairie Street and
turned. Back they swept, raking the walks. At the same time the
courthouse corridors flung out the hollow booming of some
solitary duel; then Redmain's men were dismounted by the hotel
and there making a stand. Denver considered the situation
briefly. Behind him was clear ground. Prairie Street was empty
and the Palace quiet. Two doors to his right front lay Grogan's
saloon, as still as a grave. Across, on his other flank, the
courthouse duel had dropped to significant silence. So then
Redmain had elected to draw back to the west end of town and
fight from a stationary position. And behind that screen of guns
was Ed Storm's bank with the door wide open.</p>

<p>A lull fell, both parties were recoiling for breath; shots
rang between the buildings sporadically. Munn and Jackson jumped
from the bakeshop second story and landed in the mud.</p>

<p>"Get down," muttered Denver. His own men were lined in the
black angles of either street side. Bonnet's party, in the
stable, kept up a sultry, persistent fusillade. On the far side
of the renegades some isolated D Slash man was potting away. Rain
sluiced down in great ropes; a pale blue flare of lightning
fitfully illumined the town, and he saw Redmain's henchmen
crouched by the hotel. In the succeeding deep dark the play of
shots rose higher. Denver came to a decision.</p>

<p>"Come on, D Slash!"</p>

<p>Bonnet's party caught the idea instantly and opened a stiff
covering fire on the porch. Denver ran along the walk; D Slash
fighters sprang out of their shelters and ran with him. Steve's
answering yell emerged from the courthouse opposite. The gunplay
from the stable stopped suddenly, and Denver heard the converging
tramp of their boots as he plunged over the loose boards. A solid
row of muzzle lights flickered from the porch; the blast of the
volley cracked his drums. All around him was the racking reply of
his men. Steve shouted, and the challenge caught hold and carried
D Slash onward against the porch.</p>

<p>"Back side!" cried Denver. "They've left the hotel! Don't go
down that alley! Go around!"</p>

<p>He raced forward, then whirled and cut out of the crowd. A
figure had crossed the yellow lane of the bank light. Reaching
the door, he saw a black Stetson rise suddenly from behind the
counter. Redmain faced him. Redmain saw him, and Redmain's gun
raked the door. Denver drew aside and hooked his weapon around
the sill, answering. A door slammed in the rear. Redmain had
fled.</p>

<p>Denver hurled himself in, vaulted the counter, smashed out the
wall lamp with a passing blow of the gun barrel, and ripped the
door open, stepping aside again. A single slug splintered the
sill by him. He pitched through, crouched in the absolute
darkness. Redmain's boots sloshed through soft ground. The man
was laughing bitterly; and then ceased to laugh. The sound of his
steps died.</p>

<p>Denver marked the last point he had heard them and stumbled
through a pile of junk. He cut himself on a snarl of barbed wire,
cleared it, and aimed into the dripping trees. Over Sundown's
housetops came the staccato and ragged echo of the fighting;
dying to lesser anger. Denver stopped again, hearing nothing from
the foreground. He went on, cleared the trees, and tramped up the
trail to Lola's. Her lights shone out through the crystal beads
of rain; her door opened, and a man passed through. Denver cursed
out Redmain's name and lunged on. He heard Lola crying even above
the rush of the storm, and when he reached the door he wrenched
it wide and sprang forward without thought of the trap awaiting
him. Redmain was backing away slowly, his gun raised. Every
feature on that triangular face was distorted to a point almost
past recognition: a bloodless, demoniac face with flaring eyes
pouring out the amassed and brooding hatred of a lifetime. Lola
screamed. "David, watch!" and sprang out of her corner, hands
stretched forth as if to check the inevitable bullet. Redmain
shouted, "Damn you, there will be no mistake this time!" The
small room shuddered to the explosions following, and the
lamplight guttered down to a choked, dismal glow. Lola was on her
knees, both hands slipping away from Denver.</p>

<p>"Lola!" cried Dave. "My God, what have&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The light flared. Lou Redmain lay dead beyond the stove. Lola
swayed against Denver's body, speaking softly.</p>

<p>"What other way could there be for me, David?"</p>

<p>"Lola, hold on to me!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't pick me up. There's no time. I want to
say&mdash;" She stopped. The pale oval of her face tipped back,
and the soft mass of her hair rested in his arm. She closed her
eyes, lips parting, and he thought she was slipping silently
away. But she roused after a moment, and from the deeps of her
being glowed that vibrant, haunting emotion he knew so well. It
was as if by that glance she gave to him all that remained worth
giving; telling him again of the changeless flame of love that
always had been for him and would so remain to eternity. Denver
shook the mist from his eyes, bent over and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I pay for my sins, David," she murmured. "But I am not sad.
Beloved, goodbye." When she died there was the curve of a smile
on her lips.</p>

<p>Denver remembered carrying her to the bed; remembered catching
up Redmain in his one good arm and throwing the outlaw into the
mud beyond her door; and remembered closing that door on the sad,
sweet silence pervading the room. But there was a passage of time
in that night which seemed blank; and when he called himself back
from the depths he stood at the street end of Sundown, the water
coursing over his bare head. Very quietly and definitely he
placed all the treasure she had given him into a chamber of his
heart and locked it....</p>

<p>There was no more firing in Sundown. The lights flared high
again and people of the town roamed restlessly through the
street. D Slash men came lagging back from the southern edge of
town. Steve ran out of the hotel, calling anxiously, "Dave?"</p>

<p>"Here, Steve."</p>

<p>Steve turned like a terrier. "Where yuh been?"</p>

<p>"Settling accounts with Redmain, Steve."</p>

<p>Steve said nothing for a minute. A vast sigh came out of him,
and presently he began to talk like a parrot. "Well, that is
those and them there. We collared about three quarters of 'em.
The rest won't stop runnin' short of Old Mexico. The jail's
full."</p>

<p>"That ends one part of our job," said Denver. "Now let the
jury take care of the wild bunch. Where's Niland?"</p>

<p>"In the hotel," said Steve and grinned. "Look behind yuh. See
all them chairs piled up? Nightingale was readin' on the porch
when Redmain come in. After the fireworks started, the Englishman
hauled all that furniture beside the hotel and forted up. I
counted seventeen empty shells on the ground. And where do yuh
suppose he is now? He found a paper in the hotel he hadn't read.
So that's what he's doin'. Imagine it!"</p>

<p>"Steve," asked Denver, after a long pause, "who got hurt?"</p>

<p>"Munn," said the puncher slowly. "Some others got hit. But
Munn&mdash;he's gone."</p>

<p>They found no more to say. Niland walked across the hotel
porch. Denver went over and called him. "There's another thing
left for us to do, Al."</p>

<p>"I saw him go to Grogan's," said Niland. He swung beside
Denver, and the two started for the saloon. But before reaching
it they discovered Langdell coming from the courthouse; he
paused, looked around, and went into the stable. Niland and
Denver followed. Langdell came out in time to confront them. It
brought him to an abrupt halt; the lean face tipped back as if
better to watch. "Where's Redmain?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Dead, Fear," answered Denver. "But it won't help you
any."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Denver."</p>

<p>"For reasons you know as well as we do," stated Denver, "the
less said the better. We'll stand behind the name of a good man
and do nothing to dirty it. You are getting off easy. Leave town
in ten hours and don't come back ever."</p>

<p>Langdell smiled, cold and thin. "I have bluffed some in my
time, and I recognize a bluff when I see it."</p>

<p>"There will be no court action," was Denver's even rejoinder.
"Does that penetrate your crooked head? If not, look about and
see what's been happening to other crooks tonight. I said, leave
town. Never step inside the lines of this county again."</p>

<p>Langdell stood still. A pair of horsemen galloped up Prairie
and into Main. Denver turned. Williamson was passing by, and
beside him rode Eve Leverage. They were looking straight ahead
and so missed seeing him, but Denver watched Eve until she had
dismounted and gone into the hotel, and when he shifted his
attention back to Langdell it was with impatience.</p>

<p>"That's time enough."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Langdell. He passed them as if they were non-
existent and walked to his office. Niland spoke irritably.</p>

<p>"It's a damned shame we can't hook him harder. There goes the
brains of the wild bunch."</p>

<p>"It's not in the power of human beings to produce full
justice," reflected Denver. "That's in the hands of a better
judge."</p>

<p>"So be it," agreed Niland. "I'll say now what I wouldn't
ordinarily say&mdash;and probably never will say again. It was a
lonely day for me, Dave, when I heard you were dead."</p>

<p>Denver put his hand on Niland's shoulder. "I've always been
blessed with fine friends, Al. May it continue to the end of the
chapter." They stood a moment, studying each other, a little
embarrassed. Denver turned away. "There's an empty place in the
circle, Al. I'm suggesting a name for it."</p>

<p>Niland chuckled and supplied that name. "Almaric St. Jennifer
Crvecoeur Nightingale. I vote yes."</p>

<p>Denver walked to the hotel with a quickening pace. Steve was
in the doorway talking to a youth in no humble tones. "Bill, I
don't like you. That clear? Yore Debbie's brother, but I don't
like you. And I won't like yuh until you change yore
manners."</p>

<p>"Listen," pleaded Bill, "what've I got to do with it? Debbie
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She told me to tell you she was waitin' for you, any time and
any place. That it didn't make any difference to her."</p>

<p>"I ain't comin' up to any geedee Lunt supper table," was
Steve's flat refusal.</p>

<p>"She said she didn't expect you'd want to," agreed Bill. "You
tell me where you want her to come. Shucks, Mr.
Steers&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denver broke in. "Steve, get out of the doorway and I won't
have to listen to your family troubles."</p>

<p>But Steve didn't move. "All right, Bill. Tell her this. Tell
her I'm awful doggoned sorry for what I said. But I meant it then
and I mean it now. Tell her she can be the boss inside the house
and I'll be boss outside the house. And the house is my house.
Tell her to pack a grip and come down here tomorrow morning and
we'll be married. Tell her not to bring any of her relations,
near or remote. Tell her I'm sorry she sees anything in me worth
marryin', but glad she does. Now get out of here, you little pup,
and I don't want to see no more of yuh for about a month. Mebbe
I'll get to like yuh meanwhile."</p>

<p>"She'll be here," said Bill and hurried away. Steve frowned at
Denver. "Am I right&mdash;or am I right?"</p>

<p>"I'll love her like a sister," said Denver, "if she'll let
me."</p>

<p>"Say," exclaimed Steve eagerly, "I'll tell her that! Only, be
doggone shore it don't get beyond the stage o' brotherly
interest. Great guns, I thought I'd lost her!"</p>

<p>Denver, moved by impatience, went into the hotel lobby.
Through the crowd he saw Eve&mdash;and through that same lane Eve
saw him. She rose from her chair, faced him, and stood gravely
waiting. Denver crossed the room. Williamson came out of an inner
door, and Dave, checking his stride, spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"Doc, I want you to go to Lola's cabin."</p>

<p>Williamson looked sad. "Is she hurt?"</p>

<p>"I want you to take care of her&mdash;for the last time."</p>

<p>Williamson showed shock. Eve stepped forward with a quick
intake of breath. "Dave!"</p>

<p>Denver nodded and said nothing. Williamson's mouth compressed,
and he walked away slowly.</p>

<p>"She was so beautiful," said Eve. "Beautiful and&mdash;a
woman."</p>

<p>Denver lifted his head. Eve's features were clear in the
lamplight; clear and honest. Some veil of reserve lifted from her
eyes and he saw the deep promise in them.</p>

<p>"I meant what I said in that letter, Eve."</p>

<p>"If I had not believed it, Dave, I should not be here. But
because I do believe it, nothing on earth could keep me
away!"</p>

<p>"I'm a Denver," he mused, "a black Denver. But if you'll have
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all I ask for," said Eve, and suddenly light came to
her eyes, vital and glowing.</p>
